SHIELDED REGENERATION HEATING ELEMENT<br>
FOR A PARTICULATE FILTER<br>
STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT RIGHTS<br>
[0001] Certain of the subject matter of the present application was<br>
developed under Contract Number DE-FC-04-03 AL67635 awarded by the<br>
Department of Energy. The U.S. government has certain rights in this<br>
invention.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to particulate filters and more<br>
particularly to regeneration techniques of the same.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The background description provided herein is for the<br>
purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the<br>
presently named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background<br>
section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as<br>
prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as<br>
prior art against the present disclosure.<br>
[0004] A diesel combustion cycle produces particulates that are<br>
typically filtered from a diesel exhaust gas by a particulate filter (PF). The PF<br>
is disposed in an exhaust system of a corresponding diesel engine. The PF<br>
reduces emissions of particulate matter (soot) that is generated during a<br>
heterogeneous combustion process. Over time, the PF becomes full and<br>
trapped diesel particulates must be removed. During a regeneration process,<br>
the diesel particulates are burned within the PF.<br><br>
2<br>
[0005] An engine control system can estimate the particulate<br>
accumulation and determine when the filter needs regeneration. Once it is<br>
determined that the filter is full or filled to a predetermined level of particulate,<br>
the control system enables regeneration by modifying the combustion process<br>
and/or injecting fuel into the exhaust system. The fuel is injected into the<br>
exhaust stream after a main combustion event. The post-injected fuel is<br>
combusted over one or more catalysts of the PF. The heat released during<br>
combustion of the injected fuel on the catalysts increases the exhaust<br>
temperature, which burns the trapped soot particles in the PF. The elevated<br>
exhaust temperatures initiate oxidation of the stored soot within the PF. This<br>
approach, however, can result in higher temperature excursions than desired,<br>
which can be detrimental to exhaust system components including the PF.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[G006] Accordingly, an exhaust system that processes exhaust<br>
generated by an engine to regenerate a particulate filter is provided. The<br>
system includes a particulate filter (PF) that is disposed downstream from and<br>
that filters particulates within the exhaust. A heating element heats particulate<br>
matter in the PF. A catalyst substrate is disposed upstream from the heating<br>
element and oxidizes the exhaust prior to reception by the heating element.<br>
[0007]	In other features, an exhaust system that processes<br>
exhaust generated by an engine to regenerate a particulate filter is provided.<br>
The system includes a PF that is disposed downstream of and that filters<br>
particulates within the exhaust. A heating element heats particulate matter in<br>
the Pf . A flow converter is disposed upstream from the heating element and<br>
converts turbulent exhaust flow to laminar exhaust flow prior to reception by<br>
the heating element.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0017] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and<br>
Is in no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For<br>
purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings<br>
to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term module refers to an<br>
Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a<br>
processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or<br>
more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or<br><br>
4<br>
other suitable components that provide the described functionality. As used<br>
herein, the phrase at least one of A, B, and C should be construed to mean a<br>
logical (A or B or C), using a non-exclusive logical or. It should be understood<br>
that steps within a method may be executed in different order without altering<br>
the principles of the present disclosure.<br>
[0018] Referring now to Figure 1, a cross-sectional view of a portion<br>
10 of a particulate filter (PF) is shown. The PF includes multiple inlet<br>
cells/channels 12 and outlet cells/channels 14, which have associated<br>
channel walls 16. The inlet channels 12 have inlets 18 and the outlet<br>
channels 14 have outlets 20. The inlet channels 12 are in an alternating<br>
arrangement relative to the outlet channels 14. The inlet channels 12 have<br>
outlet piugs 22 and the outlet channels 14 have inlet plugs 24. The outlet<br>
plugs 22 and the inlet plugs 24 may be integrally formed as part of the walls<br>
16. The walls 16 perform as filters for an entering engine exhaust, designated<br>
by arrow 26. The exhaust 26 enters the inlets 18 and passes from the inlet<br>
channels 12 to the outlet channels 14 through the walls 16. The channei<br>
walls 16 prevent particle matter 30 from entering the outlet channels 14 and<br>
thus collects in the inlet channels 12 against the channel walls 16.<br>
[0019] To remove the collected particle matter or soot 30, inlet<br>
regions 40 proximate to the inlets 18 are heated. When the exhaust 26 is<br>
heated in the inlet region 40, the collected particle matter in that region<br>
ignites. The flame generated from the burning of the particle matter travels<br>
along and within the associated inlet channels of the PF. This heating may be<br>
generated via an electrical interface, such as one or more heating elements,<br>
as described in more detail below. The heating is accomplished with minimal<br>
electrical power. The heating provides uniform heat distribution and limited<br>
peak temperatures within the PF, thereby preventing damage to the PF. The<br>
heating may be performed during a low fuel consumption regeneration cycle.<br>
In other words, a minimal amount of fuel may be injected in the exhaust<br>
system and/or PF system during regeneration of the PF.<br><br>
5<br>
[0020] Referring now to FIG. 2, a graph illustrating a temperature<br>
profile within the length of a catalyst substrate or PF during a cold start<br>
emission test is shown. The catalyst substrate has multiple catalyst bricks,<br>
which are coupled in series. A contact point between a front catalyst brick<br>
and a rear catalyst brick is represented by a spike in temperature differences<br>
at 0.05m. The spike is caused by a misalignment between channels of the<br>
catalyst bricks. Multiple curves 50 are shown and represent time in seconds,<br>
as provided by the key 52. The curves 50 provide a relationship between the<br>
difference in Tgas and TSOiid for the PF versus channel length or position along<br>
the longitudinal length of the channel. Tgas is the temperature of the exhaust<br>
and Tsolld is the temperature of the substrate.<br>
[0021] As can be seen from the graph, a large temperature loss<br>
occurs at a front surface of the PF, due to turbulent heat transfer at the inlets<br>
of the PF or cell entrance locations. The front surface corresponds with<br>
channel length 0. The hot exhaust gas heats up the front surface of the PF<br>
where the flow is highly turbulent. The hot exhaust gas heats the front<br>
surface until a thermal equilibrium is met over time. Since the flow of the<br>
exhaust becomes laminar a short distance down the channels of the PF, the<br>
heat transfer loss decreases. Thus, the rear surface of the PF, where the<br>
exhaust flow is laminar, experiences a gradual change in temperature with<br>
time. The Tgas/TS0lid temperature difference approaches 0 near the rear<br>
surface. For this reason, the rear surface experiences smaller thermal losses<br>
than the front surface.<br>
[0022] Thus, a heating element is used to raise the temperature of<br>
the substrate to oxidize the soot on the front surface. This prevents heating<br>
element energy loss due to convective heating of the exhaust gas, which then<br>
flows thru the substrate walls and out "clean" cold outlet channels thereof.<br><br>
6<br>
[0023] When a PF heating element is used to heat the front surface<br>
of the PF, the temperature of the heating element is increased to exceed an<br>
ignition point of the soot. Heating a front surface of a PF to a hot enough<br>
temperature that allows particulate matter to burn creates a flame front that<br>
propagates down or longitudinally along the channel of the PF cleaning the<br>
soot from the filter. The PF may be formed of electrically resistive material,<br>
which provides an efficient technique to generate heat. However, thermal<br>
losses to a cooler exhaust gas, as well as radiant heat loss to metal exhaust<br>
pipes increases the electrical power used to meet desired ignition<br>
temperatures. When the heating element receives turbulent exhaust flow, a<br>
significant amount of heat loss is exhibited, which reduces the temperature of<br>
the heating element. A large portion of this heat loss is radiant heat loss.<br>
[0024] Radiant heat loss is energy emitted from a high temperature<br>
object and is usually infrared light. Since particulate matter requires high<br>
temperatures for combustion, the radiant heat losses are a significant source<br>
of lost energy. The Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the power loss due to<br>
radiant energy is proportional to the fourth power of a temperature difference<br>
between emitting and absorbing surfaces, ie: QUAD ~ A ( Tn4 7  ). QUAD is<br>
radiant heat loss, A is the Stefan-Boltzmann law constant, TH is the<br>
temperature of the heating element, and T L is the temperature of the exhaust<br>
gases and/or other components near the heating element. Because the<br>
heating element temperature needed to initiate soot burn is high, the heating<br>
surface radiant heat loss associated with the heating element is high.<br>
[0025] To contain or reflect this radiant energy and utilize this<br>
energy to facilitate the burning of the soot, catalyst substrate/flow converter<br>
implementations are used, as described below. To achieve high heating<br>
element temperatures needed for soot ignition, with minimum electrical power,<br>
convective losses to exhaust gas flow are minimized. This is done by<br>
converting turbulent exhaust flow to laminar exhaust flow. A flow converter<br>
converts turbulent flow into laminar flow prior to reception by a heating<br>
element. In the below described embodiments, radiant energy losses are<br><br>
7<br>
reduced by allowing the radiant energy to reflect and/or be contained on a<br>
surface of a shielding substrate near a heating element. Hence conductive<br>
heat losses to an exhaust piping are reduced, and the radiant energy is<br>
contained near the heating element itself. The stated energy reflection and<br>
containment significantly improves the electrical efficiency of regenerating a<br>
PP.<br>
[0026] Referring now to FIG. 3, a functional block diagram of an<br>
exemplary diesel engine system 70 including an exhaust PF system 72 is<br>
shown. It is appreciated that the diesel engine system 70 is merely exemplary<br>
in nature and that the zone heated particulate filter regeneration system<br>
described herein can be implemented in various engine systems that have a<br>
particulate filter. Such engine systems may include, but are not limited to,<br>
gasoline direct injection engine systems and homogeneous charge<br>
compression ignition engine systems.<br>
[0027] The engine system 70 includes a diesel engine 71, an intake<br>
manifold 74, a common rail fuel injection system 76 and an exhaust system<br>
78. The engine 71 combusts an air and fuel mixture to produce drive torque.<br>
The exemplary engine 71 includes eight cylinders 80 configured in adjacent<br>
cylinder banks 82, 84 in V-type layout. Although Figure 3 depicts eight<br>
cylinders (N = 8), it can be appreciated that the engine 71 may include<br>
additional or fewer cylinders 80. For example, engines having 2, 4, 5, 6, 8,<br>
10, 12 and 16 cylinders are contemplated. It is also anticipated that the<br>
particulate filter regeneration control of the present invention can be<br>
implemented in an inline-type or another type of cylinder configuration.<br>
[0028] Air is drawn into the intake manifold 74 through a throttle (not<br>
shown). Air is drawn into the cylinders 80 from the intake manifold 74 and is<br>
compressed therein. Fuel is injected into cylinder 80 by the common rail<br>
injection system 76 and the heat of the compressed air ignites the air/fuel<br>
mixture. The exhaust gases are exhausted from the cylinders 80 into the<br>
exhaust system 78. In some instances, the engine system 70 can include a<br>
turbocharger that uses an exhaust driven turbine 86 to drive a compressor 87<br><br>
8<br>
that compresses the air entering the intake manifold 74. The compressed air<br>
typically passes through an air cooler (not shown) before entering into the<br>
intake manifold 74.<br>
[0029] The exhaust system 78 includes exhaust manifolds 88, 90,<br>
exhaust conduits 92, 94, and 96, and the PF system 72, which for the<br>
embodiment shown may be referred to as a diesel PF system. The exhaust<br>
manifolds 88, 90 direct the exhaust exiting corresponding cylinder banks 82,<br>
84 into the exhaust conduits 92, 94. Optionally, an EGR valve (not shown) re-<br>
circulates a portion of the exhaust back into the intake manifold 82. The<br>
remainder of the exhaust is directed into the turbocharger 78 to drive a<br>
turbine. The turbine facilitates the compression of the fresh air received from<br>
the intake manifold 74. A combined exhaust stream flows from the<br>
turbocharger through the exhaust conduit 96 and the PF system 72.<br>
[0030] The PF system 72 includes a catalyst substrate/flow<br>
converter 100, such as a diesel oxidizing catalyst (DOC), a heating element<br>
102 and a PF 104. The PF 104 is shown as a diesel particle filter (DPF) for<br>
the stated embodiment. The PF system 72 filters particulates from the<br>
combined exhaust stream from the exhaust conduits 92, 94 prior to entering<br>
the atmosphere. The flow converter 100 performs as a heat shield and<br>
oxidizes the exhaust based on the post combustion air/fuel ratio. The amount<br>
of oxidation increases the temperature of the exhaust.' The heating element<br>
102 increases the temperature of the front surface of the PF 104 prior to the<br>
exhaust entering the DPF 104, which initiates burning of the collected soot<br>
therein The DPF 104 receives exhaust from the flow converter 100 and<br>
filters soot particulates present in the exhaust. In one embodiment, the flow<br>
converter 100 includes and/or is an open cell/channel substrate and the DPF<br>
104 includes and/or is a closed cell/channel substrate. The flow converter<br>
100 has an internal flow through configuration whereas the DPF 104 performs<br>
as a filter. The flow converter 100 and the DPF 104 may be formed of<br>
ceramic material, a silicon carbide material, a metallic material, or other<br>
suitable materials.<br><br>
9<br>
[0031] Use of the flow converter 100, alleviates the above-described<br>
radiant thermal losses and maintains laminar exhaust flow on the heating<br>
element 102. The flow converter 100 converts turbulent exhaust flow into<br>
laminar exhaust flow prior to reception by the heating element 102. This<br>
improves the heating element efficiency by allowing laminar exhaust flow over<br>
the surfaces of the heating element 102.<br>
[0032] A control module 110 regulates operation of the system 70<br>
according to the oxygen based particulate filter regeneration method of the<br>
present invention. The system 70 may include various sensors 111, such as<br>
temperature sensors, air flow sensors, air-fuel sensors, and other sensors for<br>
status determination and control of the system 70. The control module 110<br>
determines when regeneration is needed and controls engine operation to<br>
allow regeneration to occur. Based on status signals received from the<br>
sensors, the control module 110 controls engine operation at regeneration<br>
levels throughout the regeneration process.<br>
[0033] A control module 110 controls the engine 71 and PF<br>
regeneration based on various sensed information. More specifically, the<br>
control module 110 estimates loading of the DPF 104. When the estimated<br>
loading achieves a threshold level (e.g., 5 grams/liter of particulate matter)<br>
and the exhaust flow rate is within a desired range. Current is controlled to<br>
the DPF 104 and provided via the control module 110 and a power source<br>
112 to initiate the regeneration process. The current from the power source<br>
may be supplied directly to the DPF 104, as shown, or supplied to the control<br>
module 110 prior to being received by the DPF 104. The duration of the<br>
regeneration process varies based upon the amount of particulate matter<br>
within 'he DPF 104. It is anticipated, that the regeneration process can iast<br>
between 2-6 minutes. Current is only applied, however, during an initial<br>
portion of the regeneration process. More specifically, the electric energy<br>
heats a front surface 114 of the DPF 104 for a threshold period (e.g., 1 - 2<br>
minutes). Exhaust passing through the front surface 114 is heated. The<br>
remainder of the regeneration process is achieved using the heat generated<br><br>
10<br>
by combustion of particulate matter present near the front surface 114 or by<br>
the heated exhaust passing through the DPF 104. For a further explanation<br>
or examples of zoning and heating element control see U.S. patent serial<br>
application No.11/233450 filed on March 22, 2006 and entitled, "Zoned<br>
Heated Inlet Ignited Diesel Particulate Filter Regeneration", which is<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.<br>
[0034] Referring now to FIG. 4, a perspective view of an example<br>
grid/heating element 120, as applied to a front surface 122 of a PF 124 is<br>
shown. The heating element 120 may be of various shapes and sizes and<br>
arranged in various configurations and patterns. For example, the width W of<br>
the heating element or conductive path thereof may vary per application.<br>
Although the heating element 120, as shown, has a single positive connector<br>
126 and a single negative connector 128, it may have any number of<br>
connectors. Also, any number of heating elements may be incorporated. As<br>
another example, each connector pair and heating element and/or segmented<br>
portion [hereof may be associated with a particular coverage zone on the front<br>
surface 122. Heating of the front surface 122 via multiple zones reduces the<br>
electrical impact on a PF system during regeneration. Each zone can be<br>
heated separately by supplying power to a pathway of resistive material<br>
located within each zone. In one embodiment, the heating element 120 is<br>
formed from a sheet of electrically resistive material, such as a metallic<br>
materia!, an example of which is stainless steel. The heating element may bo<br>
stamped, milled, cut using a waterjet cutting machine, or formed using some<br>
other suitable technigue.<br>
[0035] By dividing the front surface 122 into multiple heated zones,<br>
the material of the heating element 120 can be dispersed more uniformly to<br>
evenly heat the front surface 122. This minimizes the cross-sectional area of<br>
a particular heated area and broadens soot combustion to adjacent channels.<br>
As a result, the total particulate matter consumed is maximized, while the<br>
amount of initially heated area and the amount of electrical power used for<br>
such heating is minimized. Within each zone, it is also appreciated that the<br><br>
11<br>
heating element 120 may form resistive pathways or bands of material. The<br>
resistive pathways may be porous or have holes for exhaust flow<br>
therethrough. It is further appreciated that each of the zones may be heated<br>
sequentially, simultaneously, or selectively on an as needed basis.<br>
[0036] Referring now to FIGs. 3 and 4, the control module 110<br>
controls the heating of each zone individually. Switches 130, when<br>
incorporated, may be selectively activated and deactivated to allow current to<br>
flow to each zone. For example, voltage is supplied via the power source 112<br>
to the switches 130.<br>
[0037] Referring now to FIG. 5, a cross-sectional side view of a PF<br>
system 150 is shown. The PF system 150, as shown includes a flow<br>
converter 152, a grid 154 and a PF 156, which are coupled in series. The<br>
flow converter 152, the grid 154 and the PF 156 are butted to each other and<br>
are held in place via a mat 158, which in turn is held by a housing 160.<br>
During the manufacturing of the PF system 150 the flow converter 152, the<br>
grid 154 and the PF 156 are butted together and held in place. This assures<br>
that the grid 154 is held between the flow converter 152 and the PF 156. The<br>
mat 158, which is a semi-soft flexible sleeve, is wrapped around and tightly<br>
holds the flow converter 152, the grid 154 and the PF 156. The mat 158 is<br>
then enclosed within the housing 160, which may be a welded can, as shown.<br>
The mat 158 may be formed of an insulating material, such as vermiculite or<br>
other insulating material.<br>
[0038] The PF system 150 also includes electrical contact terminals<br>
170, which are coupled to the grid 154. A connector 172 connects insulated<br>
wires 174 via pins 175 to the terminals 170. Electrical energy is supplied via<br>
the wires 174 to each of the terminals 170. The connector 172 is coupled to<br>
the housing 160. The terminals 170 are sealed to the mat 158 via a high<br>
temperature conductive seal 176.<br><br>
12<br>
[0039] Note that the grid 154 may also be attached to the flow<br>
converter 152 or the PF 156. The heating element 154 may be attached to<br>
the flow converter 152 or the PF 156 using various fasteners and/or fastening<br>
techniques. The attaching of the grid 154 to the flow converter 152 or the PF<br>
156 controls movement of the heating element 154 when current is applied<br>
thereto. When temperature of the heating element 154 increases, the<br>
material of the heating element 154 expands. Since the heating element 154<br>
may have a maximum operating temperature of approximately between 700-<br>
1000°C, the heating element 154 or portions thereof may exhibit a significant<br>
amount of shape change or lateral movement. The expansion movement is<br>
within the laterally planar section of the PF system 150 in which it is<br>
positioned. The use of fasteners aids in preventing or limiting such<br>
movement. The fasteners also prevent short circuits between adjacent<br>
portions of the heating element. In one embodiment, the fasteners are placed<br>
along the heating element or resistive/conductive path thereof at<br>
predetermined intervals, such as 2-5 centimeter intervals. Examples of such<br>
attachment are described with respect to the embodiments of FIGs. 6 and 7.<br>
The fasteners may be in the form of pins, barbed pins, plugs, tabs, clips, etc.<br>
The fasteners may be formed of metal or other suitable materials.<br>
[0040] The PF 156 may be a monolith particulate trap and includes<br>
alternating inlet cells/channels 184 and outlet cells/channels 186. The<br>
cells/channels 184, 186 extend axially along the PF 156. Walls 188 of the PF<br>
156 may include a porous ceramic honeycomb wall of cordierite material. It is<br>
appreciated that any ceramic comb material is considered within the scope of<br>
the present invention. Adjacent channels are alternatively plugged at each<br>
end as shown at 190. This forces the diesel aerosol through the porous<br>
substrate walls which act as a mechanical filter. Particulate matter is<br>
deposited within the inlet channels 184 and exhaust exits through the outlet<br>
channels 186. Soot particles 192 flow into the PF 156 and are trapped<br>
therein.<br><br>
13<br>
[0041] The flow converter 152 is configured similar to the PF 156.<br>
However, the flow converter does not have endplugs and is thus in a flow<br>
through configuration. The flow converter 152 may undergo one or more<br>
various processes to improve the radiant reflective properties thereof. For<br>
example, the flow converter 152 may be metallically coated. The flow<br>
converter 152 may perform as or be replaced with a radiant energy reflector<br>
block. A radiant energy reflector block may be sized and located the same as<br>
the flow converter 152. The radiant energy reflector block reflects radiant<br>
energy. The radiant energy reflector block may provide a turbulent flow<br>
exchange as opposed to a turbulent to laminar flow exchange, ihe flow<br>
converter/radiant energy reflector block may be of various sizes, shapes and<br>
configurations. Although not shown, the flow converter has channels similar<br>
to the channels 184, 186, in which the below described fasteners may attach.<br>
The grid 154 attaches to the rear surface 194 of the flow converter 152.<br>
[0042] Although the following FIGs. 6 and 7 are described primarily<br>
with respect to the attachment of a heating element to a PF, the heating<br>
element may be attached to other catalyst substrates or to a flow converter<br>
using similar techniques.<br>
[0043] Referring now to FIG. 6, a close-up cross-sectional side view<br>
of a portion 200 of a PF 202 illustrating an example heating element fastener<br>
204 is shown. A pathway section 206 of a heating element pathway of a<br>
heating element 207 is shown over a front surface 208 of the PF 202. The<br>
heating element 207 is held onto the front surface 208 via one or more<br>
fasteners, such as the fastener 204. The fastener 204 may be integrally<br>
formed as part of the pathway section 206 and be inserted into an inlet 210 of<br>
a channel 212. The fastener 204 may be shaped or formed to allow easy<br>
assembly, but difficult disassembly. For example, the fastener 204 may be a<br>
barbed tab as shown or take on some other form. The fastener 204 may not<br>
completely plug the inlet 210 and thus may allow for exhaust flow<br>
therethrough. An opening 214 is shown through which exhaust may flow. As<br><br>
14<br>
such, the fastener 204 may wick heat into the channel 212, which further<br>
facilitates the burning of the soot therein.<br>
[0044] Referring now to FIG. 7, a close-up cross-sectional side view<br>
of a portion 220 of a PF 222 illustrating example heating element fasteners<br>
224 is shown. A pathway section 226 of a heating element pathway of a<br>
heating element 227 is shown over a front surface 228 of the PF 222. The<br>
heating element pathway is held onto the front surface 228 via the fasteners<br>
224, which are shown as pins. The fasteners 224 may be inserted into or<br>
attached to endplugs 230 of outlet channels 232 of the PF 222. The fasteners<br>
224 may also be created and/or formed as part of the endplugs 230. The<br>
fasteners 224 may be embedded into the PF 222, as shown, and allow for the<br>
attachment of the heating element pathway. The heating element pathway<br>
may be snapped under ends 234 of the fasteners 224. Note that the heating<br>
element pathway may be porous and allow for exhaust flow therethrough, as<br>
shown As an alternative, the heating element pathway may be arranged on<br>
the PF, such that the inlet channel openings are positioned between pathway<br>
sections.<br>
[0045] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the<br>
foregoing description that the broad teachings of the disclosure can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure includes<br>
