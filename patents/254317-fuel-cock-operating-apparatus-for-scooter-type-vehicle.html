COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10, rule 13]<br>
       "FUEL COCK OPERATING APPARATUS FOR SCOOTER TYPE VEHICLE"<br>
HONDA MOTOR CO., LTD., a corporation of Japan having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br>
[retailed Description of the invention] [0001]<br>
[Technical Field to which the Invention Pertains]<br>
The present invention relates to a fuel cock<br>
operating apparatus for a scooter type vehicle.<br>
[0002]	,<br>
[Prior Art]	/<br>
  2 <br><br>
In a conventional fuel cock operating apparatus, a fuel cock of a fuel tank disposed on the lower side in a motorcycle is operated in a remote mode by  operating an operating portion disposed on the upper side in the motorcycle (see, for example, Patent Reference 1). [0003]<br>
[Patent Reference 1]<br>
Japanese Utility Model Publication No. Hei 8-4397 (pp. 2-3, FIG. 1) [0004]<br>
Patent Reference 1 will be described in detail, referring to the drawings.<br>
FIG. 15 is an illustration of a fuel cock operating apparatus for a motorcycle according to the prior art (a copy of FIG. 1 in Patent Reference 1).<br>
The fuel cock operating apparatus is of the type in which a fuel cock 4 disposed on the lower side in the motorcycle is operated by an operating handle 14 disposed on the upper side in the motorcycle.  Push-pull wires 19, 19 are laid between an operating pulley 13 (see FIG. 2 in the publication) at the operating handle 14 and an action pulley 10 at the fuel cock 4, whereby the system can be operable without stooping, and operability of the system can be enhanced. [0005]<br>
3<br><br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the fuel cock operating apparatus shown in FIG. 15, however, at the time of operating the operating handle 14, it is necessary to first release a lock mechanism (not shown) at a seat 1 by use of a key, then to hold the seat 1 in the state of being oscillated upwards, to operate the operating handle 14, and thereafter to close the seat 1.  Thus, it takes time to put the key out and in and to open and close the seat 1.<br>
In addition, where the operating handle 14 is disposed on the lower side of the seat 1, the open space on the lower side of the seat 1 is reduced due to the presence of the operating handle 14, resulting in that a luggage box portion cannot be provided on the lower side of the seat 1 or the volume of the luggage box portion provided on the lower side of the seat 1 would be reduced. [0006]<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a fuel cock operating apparatus for a scooter type vehicle which ensures that a large-volume luggage box can be secured on the lower side of a seat and enhancement of operability of an  operating lever can be contrived. [0007] [Means for Solving the Problems]<br><br><br>
                         4<br><br>
In order to attain the above object, claim 1 resides in a fuel cock operating apparatus for a scooter type vehicle including a low-floor type floor provided between a steering handle and a seat, a luggage box provided at a front portion on the lower side of the seat, a fuel tank provided at a rear portion on the lower side of the seat, a fuel cock provided at a lower portion of the fuel tank, the fuel cock being provided with a first pulley for opening and closing the fuel cock, a second pulley provided on the front side of the first pulley, a wire laid between the first and second pulleys, and an operating lever integrally attached to the second pulley, the fuel cock being operable by operating the operating lever, wherein the operating lever and the second pulley are disposed at levels higher than the low-floor type floor a.nd   on   the lower side of the luggage box. [0008]<br>
With the luggage box provided at a front portion on the lower side of the seat and with the operating lever disposed on the lower side of the luggage box, an open space for making it possible to enlarge the volume of the luggage box under the seat is obtained. [0009J<br>
Claim 2 is characterized in that the operating lever and the second pulley are attached to the side of a<br>
5<br><br>
vehicle body frame, the vehicle body frame, the operating lever, the second pulley, the luggage box and the fuel tank are collectively covered with a vehicle body cover, and the vehicle body cover is provided with a lever operating opening for operating the operating lever therethrough. [0010]<br>
Since the operating lever disposed near the lever operating opening in the vehicle body cover is operated directly by hand, the operating lever can be operated without need  to put a key for releasing a lock mechanism for the seat out and in or to open and close the seat, so that operability of the operating lever is enhanced. [0011]<br>
Claim 3 is characterized in that a rear portion of the vehicle body cover is connected to a vehicle body frame through a hinge so that the vehicle body cover is an open-front type cover, and the operating lever is disposed on the inside of the turning locus of the lower end of the opening in the vehicle body cover so as not to hamper opening and closing motions of the vehicle body cover. [0012]<br>
At the time of providing the operating lever inside the vehicle body cover, if the operating lever is<br>
6<br><br>
projected beyond the outside surface of the vehicle body cover, operability of the operating lever is enhanced, but the vehicle body cover interferes with the operating lever at the time of opening the vehicle body cover.  In consideration of this problem, the operating lever is sunk to such a position as not to hamper the opening and closing motions of the vehicle body.cover, to contrive enhancement of the operability of the operating lever and securing of the opening and closing of the vehicle body cover. [0013]<br>
Claim 4 is characterized in that the luggage box and the vehicle body cover are attached to a stay provided on the front side of a rear grip.<br>
It is contrived to enhance the strength of the vehicle body cover united with the luggage box by the stay and to enhance the strength of the rear grip. [0014] [Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>

As has been described above, the central portion of<br><br>
                                                      21 <br>
the body unit 28 has an attached structure in which the luggage box 22 and the rear cover 37 are integrally assembled with the stud bolts 157, 157 welded to the lugs 155,   155 of the rear grip 26,   and these three component parts are fixed to the brackets 84, 84 of the upper first cross member 32c of the vehicle body frame 11 with the opening/closing bolts 158, 158.  On the other hand, at the time of detachment, the opening/closing bolts 158, 158 and the bolt 22a (see FIG. 6) at a front lower portion of the luggage box 22 are removed (by opening the seat 23) , whereby the three component parts can be turned in an integrated state, namely, in the state of the body unit 28.<br>
[0041]<br>
FIG. 14 is a view illustrating the opening and closing of the vehicle body cover covering the operating lever according to the present invention.  The body unit 28 as the vehicle body cover is an open-front type cover in which a rear portion of the body unit (vehicle body cover) 28 is connected to the vehicle body frame 11 through the hinge 27, whereby the body unit (vehicle body cover) 2 8 is turned upwards and downwards (in the directions of arrows © and ©) with the hinge 27 as a center.<br>
The  operating lever 78 inside the body unit 28 is<br><br>
                                                   22 <br>
provided at such a position as not to hamper the opening and closing motions (in the directions (D and ©) of the body unit 28, as has been described above. [0042]<br>
Next, the point of the process of opening and closing the body unit 28 will be described briefly.<br>
First, the seat 23 is opened, the bolt 22a (see FIG. 6) for fixing the bottom of the luggage box 22 to the vehicle body frame 11 and the opening/closing bolts 158, 158 for fixing the central portion of the body unit 2 8 are removed, and the seat 23 is closed.  Subsequently, the rear cover 37 is opened as indicated by arrow ©.  In other words, the body unit 27 is turned upwards (in the direction of arrow ©) . [0043]<br>
Functions of the fuel cock operating apparatus for a scooter type vehicle as described above will be described below.<br>
The operating lever 7 8 and the second pulley 77 are disposed at levels higher than the low-floor type floor 36, as shown in FIG. 6, and on the lower side of the luggage box 22, as shown in FIG. 1.  Therefore, a luggage box 22 with such a large volume as to be capable of containing a large thing such as a helmet can be secured under the seat 23.<br><br><br><br><br>
   23 <br>
[0044]<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, the operating lever 7 8 and the second pulley 77 are mounted to the vehicle body frame 11, the vehicle body frame 11 and the operating lever 78 are collectively covered with the body unit 28 serving as the vehicle body cover, and the rear cover 3 7 of the body unit 28 is provided with the lever operating opening 82 for operating the operating lever 7 8 therethrough. Therefore, the operating lever 7 8 can be operated without need to put a key for releasing the lock mechanism for the seat out and in or to open and close the seat, and enhancement of operability of the operating lever 7 8 can be contrived. [0045]<br>
In addition, since the operating lever 7 8 and the second pulley 77 are mounted to the vehicle body frame 11 and the operating lever 78 is covered with the rear cover 37 of the body unit 28, the rear cover 37 is prevented from projecting largely, and rideability for the rider can be maintained. [0046]<br>
As shown in FIG. 14, a rear portion of the body unit 28 as the vehicle body cover is connected to the vehicle body frame 11 through the hinge 27, whereby the body unit 28 is made to be an open-front type cover, and<br><br><br><br><br>
                                                        24 <br>
the operating lever 78 is provided at such a position as not to hamper the opening and closing motions of the body unit 28.  Therefore, the body unit (vehicle body cover) 28 can be opened, even though the operating lever 7 8 is disposed at a level higher than the low-floor type floor 3 6 shown in FIG. 1 and on the lower side of the luggage box 22. [0047]<br>
Since the luggage box 2 2 and the rear cover 3 7 in FIG. 10 are attached to the sub-frame 151 provided on the front side of the rear grip 26, it is possible to enhance the strength of the body unit 28 integrated with the luggage box 2 2 by the sub-frame 151, and to contrive enhancement of the strength of the rear grip. [0048]<br>
Incidentally, the open and closed positions, i.e., the "OFF", "ON" and "RES" positions of the operating lever 78 in FIG. 9 shown in the mode of carrying out the present invention are mere examples; the open and closed positions of the operating lever 78 may be only "OFF" and "ON" positions.  Therefore, the open and closed positions of the operating lever 7 8 are arbitrary.<br>
The "OFF", "ON" and "RES" positions of the first pulley 51 and the fuel cock 48 in FIG. 3 are also arbitrary.<br>
25<br><br>
The shape of the tank-side bracket 52 and   the shape of the operating-side bracket 7 6 are arbitrary.<br>
Also, a lid may be provided for closing the lever operating opening 82 for operating the operating lever 78 therethrough. [0049] [Effects of the Invention]<br>
