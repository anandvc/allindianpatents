The  invention  relates  to  a  method  of producing  a casing  in  a  borehole  formed  in  an  underground  formation, the  borehole  being  for  example  a  wellboxe  for  the production  of  oil,   gas  or  water.   Conventionally,   when such  wellbore  is  created,   a  number  of  casings  are installed  in  the  borehole  to  prevent  collapse  of  the borehole  wall   and  to  prevent  undesired  outflow  of drilling  fluid  into  the   formation  or  inflow  of   fluid  from the   formation  into  the  borehole.   The  borehole  is  drilled in  intervals  whereby  a  casing  which  is  to  be  installed  in a  lower  borehole   interval   is  lowered  through  a  previously installed  casing  of  an  upper  borehole  interval.   As  a consequence  of  this  procedure  the  casing  of  the  lower interval   is  of  smaller  diameter  than  the  casing  of  the upper  interval.   Thus,   the  casings  are  in  a  nested arrangement  with  ca-sing  diameters  decreasing  in  downward direction.   Cement  annuli  are  provided  between  the  outer surfaces  of  the  casings   and  the  borehole  wall  to  seal  the casings   from  the  borehole  wall.  As  a  consequence  of  this nested  arrangement  a  relatively  large  borehole  diameter is  required  at  the  upper  part  of  the  wellbore.   Such  a large  borehole  diameter  involves  increased  costs  due  to heavy  casing  handling  equipment,   large  drill  bits  and increased  volumes  of  drilling  fluid  and  drill  cuttings. Moreover,   increased  drilling", rig  time  is   involved  due  to required  cement  pumping  and  cement  hardening.<br>
International  patent  application  WO  93/25799 discloses  a  method  of  creating  a  casing  in  a  section  of  a borehole  formed  in  an  underground  formation,   wherein  a tubular  element  in  the   form  of  a  casing  is  installed within  the  section  of  the  borehole,   and  radially  expanded<br><br>
using  an  expansion  mandrel.   Expansion  of  the  casing continues  until  the  casing  contacts  the  borehole  wall  and elastically  deforms  the  surrounding  rock  formation. Optionally,   when  washouts  occur  in  the  borehole  wall during  drilling,   or  when  brittle  formations  are encountered  during  drilling,   cement  is  pumped  in  an annular  space  around  the  casing  at  the  location  of  such washout  or  brittle  formation.<br>
Although  the  known  method  overcomes  the  problem  of conventional  casings  whereby  the  diameter  of  subsequent casing  sections  decreases  in  downward  direction,   there remains  a  need  for  a  method  of  creating  a  casing  in  a borehole,   whereby  a  lower  load  is  required  to  expand  the tubular  element,   and  whereby  an  improved  sealing  between the  casing  and  the  surrounding  earth  formation  is achieved.<br>
In  WO  93/25800  is  disclosed  an  application  of  a production  liner  in  a  borehole,   which  production  liner  is provided  with  longitudinally  overlapping  openings  and  is radially  expanded  in  the  borehole.   The  production  liner serves  as  a  strainer  during  production  of  hydrocarbon fluid  flowing  from  the  surrounding  earth  formation through  the  openings,   into  the  liner.   It  is  essential  for this  production  liner  that  fluid  communication  is maintained  between  the  interior  of  the  liner  and  the surrounding  earth  formation,   i.e.   it  is  essential  that the  occurrence  of  a  sealing  between  the  production  liner and  the  surrounding  formation  is  avoided.   This  is contrary  to  the  object  of  the  present  invention  which  is aimed  at  providing  an  improved  sealing  between  the  casing and  the  surrounding  earth  formation.   It  is  another  object of  the  invention    to  provide  a  method  of  creating  a casing  having  an  improved  collapse  resistance.  A  further object  of  the  invention  is  to  provide  a  method  of creating  a  casing  which  allows  a  smaller  difference  in<br><br>
borehole  diameter  between  an  upper  interval  and  a  lower interval  of  the  borehole.<br>
In  accordance  with  the  invention  there  is  provided  a method  of producing  a  casing  in  a  borehole   formed  in  an underground  formation,   the  method  comprising  the  steps of:<br>
(a)	installing  a  tubular  liner  in  the  borehole,   the  liner being  radially  expandable  in  the  borehole  whereby  the liner  during  its  radial  expansion  has  a  plurality  of openings  which  are  overlapping  in  the  longitudinal direction  of  the  liner;<br>
(b)	radially  expanding  the  liner  in  the  borehole;   and<br>
(c)	either  before  or  after  step   (b),   installing  a  body  of hardenable   fluidic  sealing  material   in  the  borehole  so that  the  sealing  material   fills  said  openings  and  thereby substantially  closes   said  openings,   the  sealing  material being  selected  so  as   to  harden  in  said  openings   and thereby  increasing  the  compressive   strength  of  the   liner.<br>
Thus  the  method  of  the  invention  allows  application of  casing  sections  of  uniform  diameter  so  that  a  nested arrangement  of  subsequent  casing  sections  as   in conventional  casing  schemes  can  be  avoided.   With  the method  of  the   invention  a  reliable  sealing  between  the liner  and  the  borehole  wall   is  achieved  while  the openings  of  the  liner  allow  a  large  radial  expansion  of the  liner.   After  hardening  of  the  sealing  material,   the liner  with  the  openings   filled  with  sealing  material forms  a  continuous  reinforced  wellbore  casing.   The  liner is  suitably  made  of  steel,   and  can  be  provided  for example  in  the  form  of  jointed  liner  sections  or  reeled.<br>
Furthermore  a  significantly  lower  radial   force   is required  to  expand  the  liner  than  the   force  required  to expand  the  solid  casing  of  the  known  method.<br>
An  additional  advantage  of  the  method  of  the invention  is  that  the  liner  after  expansion  thereof  has  a<br><br>
larger  final  diameter  than  the  diameter  of  an  expansion tool  which  is  applied.   The  difference  between  the permanent  final  diameter  and  the  largest  diameter  of  the expansion  tool  is  referred  to  as  permanent  surplus expansion.<br>
Suitably  the  body  of  sealing  material  is  installed  in the  borehole  after  radially  expanding  the  liner..<br>
Additional  strength  of  the  liner  is  achieved  by providing  the  body  of  sealing  material  with  reinforcing fibres.<br>
In  case  a  part  of  said  body  of  sealing  material remains  in  the  interior  of  the  liner,   said  part  is suitably  removed  from  said  interior  after  expansion  of the  liner,   for  example  by  drilling  away  said  part  of  the body  of  sealing  material  after  the  sealing  material  has hardened.<br>
The  liner  can  be  radially  expanded  until  it  contacts the  borehole  wall,   or  alternatively  until  an  annular space  between  the  liner  and  the  borehole  wall  remains whereby  the  body  of  hardenable  fluidic  sealing  material extends  into  said  annular  space.<br>
The  invention  will  be  further  described  by  way  of example  and  in  more  detail  with  reference  to  the accompanying  drawings,   in  which:<br>
Figure  1  shows  schematically  a  longitudinal  cross-section  of  a  borehole  having  an  uncased  section  that  has to  be  provided  with  a  casing  including  a  liner  provided with  longitudinally  overlapping  openings;   and<br>
Figure  2  shows  part  of  Figure  1,   wherein  a  part  of the  liner  has  been  expanded.<br>
In  Figure  1  is  shown  the  lower  part  of  a  borehole  1 drilled  in  an  underground  formation  2.   The  borehole  1  has a  cased  section  5,   wherein  the  borehole  1  is  provided with  a  casing  6  secured  to  the  wall  of  the  borehole  1  by means  of  a  layer  of  cement  7,   and  an  uncased  section  10.<br><br>
In  the  uncased  section  10  of  borehole  1  a  steel  liner 11  provided  with  longitudinally  overlapping  openings  has been  lowered  to  a  selected  position,   in  this  case  the  end of  the  casing  6.   The  openings  of  the  liner  have  been provided  in  the  form  of  longitudinal  slots  12,   so  that the  liner  11  forms  a  slotted  liner  with  overlapping longitudinal  slots  12.   For  the  sake  of  clarity  not  all slots  12  have  been  provided  with  a  reference  numeral.   The upper  end  of  the  slotted  liner  11  has  been  fixed  to  the lower  end  of  the  casing  6  by  means  of  a  suitable connecting  means   (not  shown).<br>
In  a  next  step,   a  hardenable  sealing  material  in  the form  of  cement  mixed  with  fibers   (not  shown)   is  inserted into  the  slotted  liner  11.   The  cement  forms  a  body  of cement  13  in  the  borehole  1,   whereby  part  of  the  cement flows  through  the  slots  12  of  the  liner  11  and  around  the lower  end  of  the  slotted  liner  11  into  an  annular  space 14  between  the  slotted  liner  11  and  the  wall  of  the borehole  1,   and  another  part  of  the  cement  remains  in  the interior  of  the  slotted  liner  11.<br>
Having  inserted  the  cement  in  the  borehole  1,   the slotted  liner  11  is  expanded  using  an  expansion  mandrel 15.   The  slotted  liner  11  has  been  lowered  at  the  lower end  of  string  16  resting  on  the  expansion  mandrel  15.   To expand  the  slotted  liner  11  the  expansion  mandrel  15  is moved  upwardly  through  the  slotted  liner  11  by  pulling  on string  16.   The  expansion  mandrel   15  is  tapered  in  the direction  in  which  the  mandrel  15  is  moved  through  the slotted  liner  11,   in  this  case  the  expansion  mandrel   15 is  an  upwardly  tapering  expansion  mandrel.   The  expansion mandrel  15  has  a  largest  diameter  which  is  larger  than the  inner  diameter  of  the  slotted  liner  11.<br>
Figure  2  shows  the  slotted  liner  11   in  partly expanded  form,   wherein  the  lower  part  of  the  slotted liner  has  been  expanded.   The  same  features  as  shown  in<br><br>
Figure  1  have  the  same  reference  numerals.   The  slots deform  to  openings  designated  with  reference  numeral  12. As  the  expansion  mandrel   15  moves  through  the  slotted liner  11,   cement  present  in  the  interior  of  the  slotted liner  11  is  squeezed  by  the  expansion  mandrel  15  through the  slots  12  into  the  annular  space  14.   Since  furthermore the  annular  space  14  becomes  smaller  due  to  the  expansion of  the  liner  11,   the  cement  is    squeezed  against  the  wall of  the  borehole  1,   and  the  expanded  liner  11  becomes adequately  embedded  in  the  cement.<br>
After  the  slotted  liner  11  has  been  radially  expanded to  its  full  length,   the  cement  of  the  body  of  cement  13 is  allowed  to  harden  so  that  a  steel  reinforced  cement casing  is  achieved,   whereby  the  fibers  provide  additional reinforcement  to  the  casing.  Any  part  of  the  body  of hardened  cement  13  which  may  remain  in  the  interior  of the  slotted  liner  11  can  be  removed  therefrom  by  lowering a  drill  string   (not  shown)   into  the  slotted  liner  11  and drilling  away  such  part  of  the  body  of  cement  13.   The steel  reinforced  casing  thus  obtained  prevents  collapse of  the  rock  formation  surrounding  the  borehole  1  and protects  the  rock  formation  from  fracturing  due  to  high wellbore  pressures  which  may  occur  during  drilling further   (deeper)   borehole  sections.  A  further  advantage of  the  steel  reinforced  cement  casing  is  that  the  steel liner  protects  the  cement  from  wear  during  drilling  of such  further  borehole  sections.<br>
Instead  of  moving  the  expansion  mandrel  upwardly through  the  liner,   the  expansion  mandrel  can alternatively  be  moved  downwardly  through  the  liner during  expansion  thereof.   In  a  further  alternative embodiment,   a  contractible  and  expandable  mandrel  is applied.   First  the  liner  is  lowered  in  the  borehole  and subsequently  fixed,   whereafter  the  expansion  mandrel  in contracted  form  is  lowered  through  the  liner.   The<br><br>
expansion  mandrel  is  then  expanded  and  pulled  upwardly  so as  to  expand  the  liner.<br>
The  method  according  to  the  invention  can  be  applied in  a  vertical  borehole  section,   a  deviated  borehole section,   or  in  a  horizontal  borehole  section.<br>
Instead  of  applying  the  tapered  expansion  mandrel described  above,   an  expansion  mandrel  provided  with rollers  can  be  applied,   which  rollers  are  capable  of rolling  along  the  inner  surface  of  the  liner  when  the mandrel  is  rotated,   whereby  the  mandrel  is  simultaneously rotated  and  axially  moved  through  the  liner.<br>
In  a  further  alternative  embodiment,   the  expansion mandrel  forms  a  hydraulic  expansion  tool  which  is radially  inflated  upon  provision  of  a  selected  fluid pressure  to  the  tool,   and  whereby  step   (b)   of  the  method according  to  the  invention  comprises  providing  said selected  pressure  to  the  tool.<br>
Any  suitable  hardenable  sealing  material  can  be applied  to  form  the  body  of  sealing  material,   for  example cement,   such  as  conventionally  used  Portland  cement  or blast  furnace  slag  cement,   or  a  resin  such  as  an  epoxy resin.  Also  any  suitable  resin  which  cures  upon  contact with  a  curing  agent  can  be  used,   for  example  by  providing the  liner  internally  or  externally  with  a  first  layer  of resin  and  a  second  layer  of  curing  agent  whereby  during expansion  of  the  liner  the  two  layers  are  squeezed  into the  openings  of  the  liner  and  become  intermixed  so  that the  curing  agent  induces  the  resin  to  cure.<br>
The  sealing  material  can  be  inserted  into  the  annular space  between  the  liner  and  the  borehole  wall  by circulating  the  sealing  material  through  the  liner, around  the  lower  end  of  the  slotted  liner,   and  into  the annular  space.  Alternatively  the  sealing  material  can  be circulated  in  the  reverse  direction,   i.e.   through  the<br><br>
annular  space,   around  the  lower  end  of  the  liner,   and into  the  liner.<br>
In  the  foregoing  description  the  liner  is  provided with  a  plurality  of  slots,   whereby  during  radial expansion  of  the  liner  the  slot  widens  so  as  to  form  the openings.   If  it  is  required  to  pump  fluid  through  the liner  before  radial  expansion  thereof,     the  slots  can  be sealed  before  such  radial  expansion  of  the  liner  takes place,   for  example  by  means  of  polyurethane  sealing material.<br>
In  an  alternative  embodiment  the  liner  is  provided with  a  plurality  of  sections  of  reduced  wall-thickness, whereby  during  radial  expansion  of  the  liner  each  section of  reduced  wall-thickness  shears  so  as  to  form  one  of said  openings.   For  example,   each  section  of  reduced  wall-thickness  can  be  in  the  form  of  a  groove  provided  in  the wall  of  the  liner.   Preferably  each  groove  extends  in  the longitudinal  direction  of  the  liner.<br><br><br>
