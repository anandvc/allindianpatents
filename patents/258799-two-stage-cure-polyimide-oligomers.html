RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial<br>
No. 10/931,070, ftied August 30, 2004, which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 60/499,849, filed September 2, 2003.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]	The present invention generally relates to a method for using citraconic<br>
anhydride and itaconic anhydride as addition cure end caps in reactions for forming<br>
polyamic acid oligomers and polyimide oligomers. The present invention also generally<br>
relates to prepregs and high temperature adhesives made from Hie resulting oligomers,'<br>
as well as, high temperature, low void volume, fiber-reinforced composites made from the<br>
prepregs.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0003]	Fiber-reinforced composite materials, which are made up of reinforcing<br>
fibers and matrix resins, are lightweight and have excellent mechanical properties. As<br>
such, these composite materials nave been widely used in a variety of structural and non-<br>
structural applications such as aerospace, automotive, infra-structure repair, marine,<br>
military, and sporting goods or other consumer products that must have sufficient<br>
toughness and impact resistance to endure many years of harsh service.<br>
[0004]	Epoxy resins, and to a lesser extent, unsaturated polyester resins, vinyl<br>
ester resins, phenol resins, and polyimide resins, have been employed as matrix resins in<br>
fiber-reinforced composite materials. The use of composite materials having polyimide<br>
resin matrices is increasing, however, where these materials are now recognized as<br>
preferred structural materials in aerospace applications, because of their lightweight and<br>
load-bearing characteristics and their oxidative stability at elevated temperatures.<br>
[0005]	Various methods or techniques such as prepreg, hand lay-up, filament<br>
winding, pull-trusion, resin transfer molding (RTM) and resin infusion (Rl), have been<br>
used to produce fiber-reinforced composite materials.<br>
[0006]	Current technologies for making prepreg and composites from polyimides<br>
utilize solutions from the poly(amide) acids of these resins. Poiy(amide) add solutions<br>
are processed into prepreg with various reinforcing fibers. These poiy(amide) acid<br>
solutions are of low solids contents and high viscosity. Therefore, the processing of these<br><br>
types of solutions requires overcoming significant problems such as solvent management<br>
and good fiber wet out from the high viscosity solutions. The resultant prepreg typically<br>
requires residual solvent contents of 20 to 25% by weight (approximately 2-3% water<br>
from thermal imidization reaction) for adequate tack and drape. This residual solvent must<br>
then be removed during the composite cure cycle. This material is hand-laid into<br>
composites which makes working with this type of material very labor intensive and<br>
costly.<br>
[0007]	One example of a prior art prepreg solution that when processed into<br>
prepreg with suitable reinforcing fibers yielded a high temperature resistant composite,<br>
was first marketed in the 1960s under the trade designation SKYBOND by Monsanto<br>
Corporation, 800 N. Lindbergh Blvd., St. Louis, Missouri 63167: The SKYBOND prepreg<br>
solution was prepared by prereacting 3,3',4,4'-benzophenonetetracarboxylic dianhydride<br>
(BTDA) with ethanol using NMP as the solvent. Then, either m-phenylenediamine (MPD)<br>
or 4,4'-methylenedianiline (MDA) was added to the solution. No endcapping agent was<br>
employed. It was (and continues to be) difficult to fabricate low void composites using<br>
this type of chemistry. One of the reasons offered for this difficulty has been that during<br>
the cure process branching can occur by the reaction of amine end-groups with the<br>
bridging carbonyl group of the BTDA moiety leading to branching and intractability of the<br>
matrix resin.<br>
[0008]	The processability (and thus end-use applications) of these polyimides has<br>
 been improved by lowering molecular weight and by using reactive endcapping agents to<br>
produce thermosetting polyimides.<br>
[0009]	Originally developed in the 1970s for military aircraft applications, these<br>
thermosetting polyimides are produced by dissolving an aromatic diamine, a dialkyl ester<br>
of tetracarboxylic acid and a monofunctional nadic ester endcapping agent in a solvent<br>
(e.g., alcohol).<br>
[0010]	The best known of these early thermosetting polyimides is PMR-15, which<br>
is shorthand for in-situ polymerization of monomer reactants. These thermosetting<br>
polyimides (/.e.t benzophenone dianhydride//methylenedianiline//nadic anhydride) were<br>
originally developed at NASA Lewis for military aircraft engines and airframes, undergo<br>
crosslinking at 250 째C to 300 째C (482 째F to 572 째F), and demonstrate good thermal and<br>
mechanical properties. PMR-15 thermosetting polyimides, however, contain the<br>
hazardous compound methylenedianiline (MDA), which raises health and safety<br>
concerns.<br><br>
[0011]	PMR-15 cures with a condensation reaction, which means that water and<br>
alcohol are evolved and given off from the polymer chain during cure. PMR-15 does not<br>
give a clean two-stage cure. In particular, PMR-15 crosslinks while volatiles are being<br>
removed and decomposes during cure to evolve cyclopentadiene. Moreover, the volume<br>
of solvent removed such as water, methanol and cyclopentadiene, produces voids in the<br>
final composite in an amount equal to greater than 2 percent (%) of the volume of the<br>
composite.<br>
[0012]	A direct PMR-15 replacement with very similar chemistry but using less<br>
toxic monomers is the nadic end-capped polyimides RP-46. These thermosetting<br>
polyimides (i.e., benzophenone dianhydride//3,4-oxydianiline//nadic anhydride), like PMR-<br>
15, cure with a condensation reaction. The two-stage cure is not a clean two-stage cure.<br>
Moreover, the resulting composite contains voids in an amount of greater than 2 % of the<br>
volume of the composite.<br>
[0013]	Other non-MDA containing polyimides include PETI {i.e., phenylethynyl<br>
terminated imide) resins, which represent a different polyimide chemistry. These resins<br>
were developed to address the need for structural matrix resins that could provide higher<br>
temperature performance and longer-term thermoxidative stability. While more expensive<br>
than PMR-type materials, these high temperature resins, which cure in an addition<br>
reaction without volatile evolution, can be used to produce substantially void-free<br>
composites. Unfortunately, these resins require extremely high cure temperatures of<br>
around 375 째C/707 째F. which are very close to the degradation temperature of these<br>
resins. In addition, such high cure temperatures may necessitate specialized autoclave<br>
or press equipment for some manufacturers.<br>
[0014]	A need therefore exists for polyamic acid and polyimide oligomers for use<br>
in making adhesives and prepreg, where the polyimide oligomers provide a clean two-<br>
stage cure at temperatures of less than or equal to about 370 째C.<br>
[0015]	It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide such polyamic<br>
acid and polyimide oligomers.<br>
[0016]	It is another object to provide solutions suitable for use as prepreg<br>
solutions or as high temperature adhesives, which contain one or more of the above-<br>
described oligomers and an organic solvent.<br>
[0017]	It is yet another object of the present invention to provide high<br>
temperature, low void volume, fiber-reinforced composites prepared from prepregs made<br>
using the inventive prepreg solutions.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0018]	The present invention therefore provides a method for using citraconic<br>
anhydride and itaconic anhydride, the method comprising using these materials as<br>
addition cure end caps in reactions for forming polyamic acid oligomers and polyimide<br>
oligomers.<br>
[0019]	The present invention also provides a polyamic acid oligomer, which is<br>
obtained by reacting one or more aromatic dianhydrides, one or more aromatic diamines,<br>
and one or more addition cure end caps selected from the group of citraconic anhydride<br>
and itaconic anhydride.<br>
[0020]	Also provided by way of the present invention is a two-stage cure<br>
polyimide oligomer, which is obtained by condensing the polyamic acid oligomer<br>
described above.<br>
[0021]	The present invention also provides a solution suitable for use as a<br>
prepreg solution or as a high temperature adhesive, which contains the above-described .<br>
polyamic acid oligomer and/or polyimide oligomer, and an organic solvent.<br>
[0022]	The invention further provides a high temperature, low void volume, fiber-<br>
reinforced composite material which may be obtained by curing a prepreg in which a<br>
fibrous reinforcing material is impregnated with the above-described prepreg solution.<br>
[0023]	Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent to one of<br>
ordinary skill from the following detailed description.<br>
[0024]	Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein<br>
have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to<br>
which this invention belongs. Ail publications, patent applications, patents and other<br>
references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In case of<br>
conflict, the present specification, including definitions, will control. In addition, the<br>
materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0025]	By way of the present invention, novel addition cure end caps for two-<br>
stage cure polyimides have been identified. The novel end caps, namely, citraconic<br>
anhydride (CA) and itaconic anhydride (IA), allow for the manufacture of very low void<br>
volume composites from polyimide impregnated prepreg using a simple cure schedule.<br>
As noted above, the evolution of cure volatiles from condensation cure polyimide resins is<br>
well known as a limiting factor in the use of polyimides in structural composites. The<br>
present invention solves this problem by providing novel addition cure end caps that<br><br>
possess the correct reactivity to allow volatiles to be removed during composite<br>
manufacture. The novel end caps also control molecular weight and act as cr'osslinkers at<br>
higher temperatures.<br>
[0026]	The polyamic acid oligomer of the present invention is obtained by reacting<br>
one or more aromatic dianhydrides, one or more aromatic diamines, and one or more<br>
addition cure end caps selected from the group of citraconic anhydride and itaconic<br>
anhydride.<br>
[0027]	Aromatic dianhydrides deemed suitable for use in preparing the inventive<br>
polyamic acid oligomer are dianhydrides that generally have more than one aromatic ring<br>
in the structure, such as those dianhydrides represented by the following formula (I)<br><br>
or by the following general formula (II)<br><br>
where Z represents -CO-, -O-, -SOr, or a direct bond. The aromatic dianhydride having<br>
the structure (I) is 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (pyromellitic dianhydride or<br>
PMDA), while aromatic dianhydrides having the structure (II) include 3,3',4,4'-<br>
biphenyltetracarboxylic	dianhydride	(BPDA),	2,2'-bis[4-(3,4-<br>
dicarboxyphenoxy)phenyl]propane dianhydride (BPADA), 1,1',2,2'-benzophenone<br>
tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA), 4,4-oxydiphthalic anhydride (OPDA), and 3,3',4,4'-<br>
diphenylsulfone tetracarboxylic diandydride (DSDA).<br>
[0028]	One or more dianhydrides are used to prepare the inventive polyamic acid<br>
oligomer. When two dianhydrides are used, the first dianhydride (e.g., BTDA) is<br>
preferably present in an amount ranging from about 5 to about 40 % by wt (more<br><br>
preferably, from about 10 to about 25 % by wt., and most preferably, from about 20 to<br>
about 25 % by wt.). based on the total weight of the dianhydrides, while the second<br>
dianhydride (e.g., BPDA) is preferably present in an amount ranging from about 95 to<br>
about 60 % by wt. (more preferably, from about 90 to about 75 % by wt., most preferably,<br>
from about 80 to about 75 % by wt.), based on the total weight of the dianhydrides.<br>
[0029]	Aromatic diamines deemed suitable for use in the present invention are<br>
diamines that generally have at least one ether linkage in the structure, such as 3,4'-<br>
oxydianiline (3,4'-ODA), 4,4'-oxydianiline (4,4'-ODA), m-phenylenediamine (m-PDA), 2,2'-<br>
bis[4-(4-aminophenoxy)phenyi]propane (BAPP), bis[4-(3-aminophenoxy)phenyl]suffone<br>
(BAPS-M),	1,3-bis(3-aminophenoxy)benzene	(APB),	and	1,3-bis(4-<br>
aminophenoxy)benzene (TPE-R).<br>
[0030]	One or more diamines are used to prepare the inventive polyamic acid<br>
oligomer. When two diamines are used, it is preferred that at least one diamine have one<br>
or more oxygen linkages and that this diamine be present in an amount of at least about<br>
50 % by wt., based on the total weight of the diamines.<br>
[0031]	In select embodiments, the aromatic diamine(s) is used in combination<br>
with a rubber component. Suitable rubber components include, but are not limited to,<br>
amine terminated rubbers. In a preferred embodiment, an amine-terminated silicone<br>
rubber (SR) is used to prepare the inventive oligomers. In this preferred embodiment, the<br>
rubber is present in an amount of less than about 30 % by wt, and more preferably in an<br>
amount of less than about 20 % by wt., based on the total weight of the aromatic<br>
diamine(s) and rubber component.<br>
[0032]	Addition cure end caps suitable for use in preparing the inventive polyamic<br>
acid oligomer are selected from the group of methyl maleic anhydride (citraconic<br>
anhydride) and 2-methylenesuccinic anhydride (itaconic anhydride). As will be described<br>
in more detail below, these addition cure end caps serve to control volatiles during cure.<br>
[0033]	The preparation of the polyamic acid oligomer, in accordance with the<br>
teachings of the present invention, basically comprises:<br>
(1)	charging at least one dianhydride {e.g., BPDA) and at least one diamine<br>
(e.g., BAPP) to separate reaction vessels;<br>
(2)	adding quantities of a suitable solvent (e.g., 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone<br>
(NMP)) to each reaction vessel to form a slurry or solution of dianhydride(s)<br>
in one vessel, and a slurry or solution of diamine(s) in the other vessel,<br><br>
(3)	heating the slurry or solution contained in each reaction vessel to a<br>
temperature ranging from about 50 to about 120 째C to dissolve the<br>
dianhydride(s) and the diamine(s);<br>
(4)	cooling the solutions contained in each reaction vessel to ambient or room<br>
temperature;<br>
(5)	slowly adding the dianhydride solution to the diamine solution over a period<br>
of time ranging from about 10 to about 60 minutes;<br>
(6)	adding a solution of addition cure end cap(s) (e.g., citraconic anhydride<br>
(CA) in NMP) to the reaction vessel; and<br>
(7)	stirring the solution for a period of time ranging from about 15 to about 120<br>
minutes to form an amic acid solution, wherein, the molar ratio of<br>
dianhydride(s) to diamine(s) to addition cure end cap(s) in the amic acid<br>
solution ranges from about 1.0/1.95/2.10 to about 1.0/2.1/2.0.<br>
[0034]	By way of the present invention, it has been discovered that by slowly<br>
adding the dissolved dianhydride reactant to the dissolved diamine reactant, while<br>
controlling the reaction temperature, the molecular weight of the resulting resin is reduced<br>
causing an advantageous reduction in its melting point and melt viscosity.<br>
[0035]	Solvents suitable for use in the present inventive method include amide-<br>
based solvents such as NMP, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-demethylformamide and N-<br>
methylcaprolactam, among which NMP and N.N-dimethylacetamide are preferred.<br>
[0036] The molar ratio of dianhydride to diamine to addition cure end cap is such<br>
that stirring the solution forms low molecular weight prepolymers having at least one end<br>
cap radical and suitable for chain extension and crosslinking to form polyimides that have<br>
a melting point of less than about 250 째C, and a melt viscosity at 250 째C of less than<br>
about 25000 cps. Typically the prepolymers have a weight average molecular weight of<br>
less than about 10000 grams per mole (g/mol), and generally less than about 5000 g/mol.<br>
[0037]	In a preferred embodiment, the molar ratio of<br>
dianhydride(s):diamine(s):addition cure end cap(s) is 1.0/2.0/2.01, and more preferably<br>
the molar ratio is n/n+1/2.<br>
[0038]	The polyimide oligomer or resin of the present invention is obtained by<br>
imidizing the polyamic acid oligomer by chemical or thermal means to cause dehydration<br>
and cyclization to occur. In one embodiment, the synthesis of the polyimide oligomer in<br>
the form of an imide powder is carried out via chemical imidization in which a strong acid<br>
and an azeotropic agent are used to promote ring closure and to remove azeotropic<br>
water, respectively. In a preferred embodiment, a strong acid such as methane sulfonic<br><br>
add is employed as a catalyst arid azeotropic water removed by use of a tertiary amine<br>
co-solvent such as toluene. More specifically, the imide powder is prepared by:<br>
(1)	placing from about 20 to about 40 % by wt. (preferably from about<br>
25 to about 35 % by wt.) of the amic acid solution and from about 80<br>
to about 60 % by wt. (preferably from about 75 to about 65 % by<br>
wt.) of an azeotropic agent (e.g., toluene) in a reaction vessel;<br>
(2)	charging from about 0.05 to about 0.5 % by wt. (preferably from<br>
about 0.1 to about 0.2 % by wt) of a strong acid catalyst (e.g.,<br>
methane sulfonic acid) to the reaction vessel to form a mixture;<br>
(3)	heating the mixture in the reaction vessel to a temperature of from<br>
about 100 to about 130 째C (preferably, from about 120 to about 125<br>
째C) for from about 2 to about 6 hours;<br>
(4)	cooling the mixture to ambient or room temperature;<br>
(5)	removing the azeotropic agent from the reaction vessel; and<br>
(6)	isolating and recovering the solids or imide powder from the<br>
remaining solution contained in the reaction vessel.<br>
[0039]	By way of the present invention, it has been further discovered that the<br>
strong acid and the azeotropic agent, when used in the amounts noted above, serve to<br>
effectively control ring closure temperature. More- specifically, the strong acid causes<br>
more water to be generated, while the azeotropic agent decreases the reflux point of the<br>
system.<br>
[0040]	Particularly advantageous polyimide oligomers or resins are provided<br>
when the oligomer is prepared by reacting BPDA or BTDA with a diamine selected from<br>
the group of 3,4'-ODA, 4,4'-ODA, BAPP and APB. and end-capping any remaining amine<br>
groups with either CA or IA. For example, the following oligomers (among others) are<br>
contemplated by the present invention:<br>
(i) BPDA//3,4'-ODA/BAPP//CA;<br>
(ii) BPDA//4,4'-ODA/BAPP//CA;<br>
(iii) BTDA//3,4'-ODA/BAPP//CA;<br>
(iv) BPDA//3,4,-ODA/m-APB//CA; and<br>
(v) BPDA//3,4,-ODA/BAPP//IA.<br>
[0041]	Solutions contemplated by the present invention which are suitable for use<br>
as a prepreg solution or as an adhesive contain the above-described polyamic acid<br>
oligomer and/or polyimide oligomer, and an organic solvent. In a preferred embodiment,<br>
the concentration of oligomers in the solution is greater than or equal to about 25 wt. %<br><br>
(preferably, from about 25 to about 40 wt. %), and the viscosity of the solution ranges<br>
from about 10 to about 140 poise (preferably, from about 25 to about 70 poise).<br>
[0042]	Prepregs for composites may be made by the conventional method of<br>
impregnating a suitable fabric or other reinforcement with the above-described prepreg<br>
solution.<br>
[0043]	Prepregs for composites may also be made by interleaving layers of fabric<br>
with layers of a resin film comprising the inventive oligomers, and then subjecting the<br>
resultant stack of interleaved materials to a simple cure schedule or cycle, as detailed<br>
below.<br>
[0044]	According to a further alternative, the inventive oligomers can be spun into<br>
fibers, and woven with fibers of reinforcing material to produce a prepreg. This prepreg is<br>
cured in a manner comparable to the method of forming a composite from interleaved<br>
oligomer film and fabric layers.<br>
[0045]	Polymer powder impregnation methods or techniques may also be used to<br>
prepare the prepregs. In one such solventless method or technique, dry powder is<br>
impregnated into a fiber bundle by causing the fiber bundle to spread, thereby allowing<br>
the powder to disperse within the fiber bundle, and then allowing the fiber bundle to<br>
contract to hold the powder in place. The impregnated fiber bundle may then be passed<br>
through an oven to prepare a prepreg.<br>
[0046]	The low void volume composites of the present invention may be<br>
manufactured from the polyimide impregnated prepreg using conventional methods or<br>
techniques (e.g., hot pressing techniques) and a simple cure schedule.<br>
[0047]	As noted above, the polyimide oligomers or resins of the present invention<br>
cure at temperatures of less than or equal to about 370 째C (preferably, less than or equal<br>
to about 350 째C) by an addition reaction rather than a condensation reaction, thus<br>
controlling volatiles during cure. The cure temperature of the inventive polyimide<br>
oligomers or resins is lower than that noted above for PETI resins.<br>
[0048]	The cure schedule or cycle for the composites of the present invention is<br>
composed of two stages: a first stage for volatile removal followed by consolidation; and<br>
a second stage for full cure. Preferably, in the first stage, the temperature of the prepreg<br>
would be increased to about 250 째C by, for example, a hot-pressing machine and kept at<br>
this temperature for from about 1 to about 4 hours to effect volatile removal. Pressure<br>
would then be applied to the prepreg by the hot-pressing machine to effect consolidation<br>
and thus to remove voids, the pressure increasing from about 4.2 to about 6.0<br>
megapascals (MPa). Simultaneously, the temperature of the prepreg would be increased<br><br>
to about 350 oC. In the second stage, the temperature of the consolidated prepreg would<br>
be maintained at 350 째C for from about 1 to about 4 hours, to effect crosslinking via a<br>
nonvolatile producing reaction.<br>
[0049]	The polyimide oligomers or resins with novel addition cure end caps of the<br>
present invention maintain a low enough viscosity (i.e., less than or equal to 2500 poise)<br>
during the first stage of the two-stage cure cycle thereby allowing for effective removal of<br>
volatiles followed by consolidation of the composite to remove voids. During the second<br>
stage of the two-stage cure cycle, crosslinking takes place by way of a nonvolatile<br>
producing reaction. In other words, the polyimide oligomers or resins of the present<br>
invention give a "clean" two stage cure.<br>
[0050]	The resulting high temperature composites of the present invention<br>
demonstrate a combination of desirable properties after cure that render them suitable for<br>
use in a wide variety of applications such as aerospace, military, and infra-structure repair<br>
applications. More specifically, these high temperature composites exhibit a use<br>
temperature of greater than about 200 째C, and further exhibit a Ta ranging from about 210<br>
째C to about 300 째C (preferably from about 210 째C to about 275 째C), flexural strength<br>
(ASTM D-790) ranging from about 400 to about 1200 MPa, toughness, microcrack<br>
resistance, solvent and moisture resistance, damage tolerance, and good retention.of<br>
mechanical properties under hot/wet conditions.<br>
[0051]	The inventive composites also have a low void volume. By "low void<br>
volume" it is meant that the composite has a void volume, i.e. the volume of the<br>
composite which is air space, of from about 1 to about 2 (preferably, from about 0.5 to<br>
about 1.5, more preferably, from about 0.5 to about 1.0) percent (%) of the volume of the<br>
composite. The void volume of the inventive composites is lower than that noted above<br>
for the PMR-15 and RP-46 composites.<br>
[0052]	Reinforcing fibers suitable for use in the inventive composite include<br>
carbon fibers, glass fibers, and quartz fibers.<br>
[0053]	The solution of the present invention may also be used as an adhesive<br>
allowing for substantially void-free bonding of large areas and thus the production of<br>
substantially void-free laminates. By way of example, materials such as carbon or glass<br>
fabrics may be laminated together by applying the inventive solution to the fabric<br>
surfaces, assembling the fabric layers, and then subjecting the assembled layers to the<br>
two-stage cure schedule or cycle described above. As will be readily appreciated by<br>
those skilled in the art, debonding problems attributed to volatile evolution during cure of<br>
prior art polyimide laminates are solved by the present invention.<br><br>

preparation of the BPDA/CA//3,4'-ODA/BAPP prepreg solution and composites were also<br>
used to prepare the remaining prepreg solutions and composites of Examples 9 to 17 in<br>
this EXAMPLES section.<br>
Examples 1 to 8<br>
BPDA/CA(83/34)//3,4'-ODA/BAPP(85/15)<br>
[0057]	In Examples 1 to 8, components 3,4-ODA (34.000 g, 0.170 mol), BAPP<br>
(12.300 g, 0.030 mol) and NMP (104.15g) were added to a 500 milliliter (ml) three-neck<br>
flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a heater. The resulting mixture was<br>
completely dissolved to from a solution. BPDA (48.804 g, 0.166 mol) was dispersed in<br>
NMP (104.15g) and the resulting dispersion was added to the solution in the three-neck<br>
flask. The resulting mixture was then stirred at a rate of 80 revolutions per minute (rpm)<br>
at 60 째C for 8 hours to provide a solution. Finally, a solution of CA (7.616 g, 0.068 mol) in<br>
NMP (10.0g) was added to the solution in the three-neck flask and the resulting mixture<br>

Materials") were then impregnated with the prepreg solution urider the following<br>
conditions: Each sheet was wetted with the prepreg solution and then dried at 80 째C for<br>
20 minutes. Each sheet was then re-wetted with the prepreg solution and dried again at<br>
80 째C for 20 minutes. The dried sheets were then imidized according to the following<br>

pressing machine manufactured by Toyo Seiki Seisaku-sho, Ltd. (model no. MP-SCH)<br>
and subjected to an initial pressure of 4.2 megapascals (MPa) and a cure regimen as<br>
described in Table 1 below. The initial pressure increased to 5 to 6 MPa over time as the<br>

percent of cured resin to the sum of cured resin and carbon fabric ([cured resin]/{[cured<br>
resin] + [carbon fabric]}) of the resulting composites ranged from 30 to 35 wt.%. Once<br>

avg = 826). The surface of each composite (with the exception of the Example 7<br>
composite) was smooth, indicating good resin flow and a good processing window. Also,<br>
the glass transition temperatures of these composites (Tg avg = 227 째C) were tow, and in<br>

of 64 poise. The composite test results are shown in Table 2.<br><br><br>
[0061]	Example 9 showed an acceptable level of flexural strength, but had a<br>
somewhat rough surface indicating less than optimal resin flow. The glass transition<br>
temperature of this composite was higher than the average of the above Examples 1 to 8.<br>
Examples 10 to 13<br>
BPDA/CA(80/40)//4,4'-ODA/BAPP(50/50)<br>
[0062]	In these Examples, the ratios of aromatic dianhydride to end cap and<br>
aromatic diamine 4,4'-ODA to aromatic diamine BAPP were changed to 80/40 and 50/50,<br>
respectively. The prepreg solution had a solids content of 30 wt. % and a viscosity of 28<br>
poise. The composite test results are shown in Table 3.<br><br>
[0063]	Examples 10 to 13 showed high levels of flexural strength (flexural strength<br>
avg = 765). The surface of each composite was smooth, indicating good resin flow and a<br>
good processing window. Also, the glass transition temperatures of these composites<br>
(Tg avg = 219 째C) were slightly lower than the previous Examples as well as lower than<br>
that obtained for films cast from the same prepreg solution.<br><br>
Examples 14 and 15<br>
BTDA/CA(83/34)//3,4'-ODA/BAPP(85/15)<br>
[0064]	Instead of the aromatic dianhydride BPDA used in Examples 1 to 8, these<br>
Examples used aromatic dianhydride BTDA. The prepreg solution had a solids content of<br>
30 wt. % and a viscosity of 32 poise. The composite test results are shown in Table 4.<br><br>
[0065]	Examples 14 and 15 also showed high levels of flexural strength (flexural<br>
strength avg= 718), but had somewhat rough surfaces indicating less than optimal resin<br>
flow. The glass transition temperatures of these composites (Tg avg = 248 째C) were<br>
slightly higher than the average of the above Examples 1 to 8.<br>
Example 16<br>
BPDA/CA(83/34)//3,4'-ODA/m-APB(85/15)<br>

Example used aromatic diamine m-APB. The prepreg solution had a solids content of 30<br>
wt. % and a viscosity of 33 poise. The composite test results are shown in Table 5.<br><br>
[0067]	Example 16 showed high levels of flexural strength. The surface of this<br>
composite was smooth, indicating good resin flow and a good processing window. Also,<br>
the glass transition temperature of this composite was lower than the average glass<br>
transition temperatures obtained for previous Examples as well as lower than that<br>
obtained for films cast from the same prepreg solution.<br><br>
Example 17<br>

well as lower than that obtained for films cast from the same prepreg solution.<br>
[0070]	The above-referenced Examples demonstrate that the polyamic acid<br>
oligomers and polyimtde oligomers prepared in accordance with the teachings of the<br>
present invention have low Tgs and good processing windows, while the inventive<br>
composites exhibit good flexural properties in the form of high flexural strength.<br>
