VARIANT FORMS OF URATE OXIDASE AND USE THEREOF<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] The present application claims priority to and benefit of U.S. provisional application Serial No.: 60/670,573, filed on April 11, 2005, the disclosure of which is being incorporated by reference herein.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to genetically modified proteins with uricolytic activity. More specifically, the invention relates to proteins comprising truncated urate oxidases and methods for producing them.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] The terms urate oxidase and uricase are used herein interchangeably. Urate oxidases (uricases; E.C. 1.7.3.3) are enzymes which catalyze the oxidation of uric acid to a more soluble product, allantoin, a purine metabolite that is more readily excreted. Humans do not produce enzymatically active uricase, as a result of several mutations in the gene for uricase acquired during the evolution of higher primates. Wu, X, et al., (1992) J Mol Evol 34:78-84, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As a consequence, in susceptible individuals, excessive concentrations of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia) can lead to painful arthritis (gout), disfiguring urate deposits (tophi) and renal failure. In some affected individuals, available drugs such as allopurinol (an inhibitor of uric acid synthesis) produce treatment-limiting adverse effects or do not relieve these conditions adequately. Hande, KR, et al, (1984) Am J Med 76:47-56; Fam, AG, (1990) Bailliere's Clin Rheumatol 4:177-192, each incorporated herein by<br><br>
Attorney's Docket No.: BTG-002PC<br>

reference in its entirety. Injections of uricase can decrease hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria, at least transiently. Since uricase is a foreign protein in humans, even the first injection of the unmodified protein from Aspergillus flavus has induced anaphylactic reactions in several percent of treated patients (Pui, C-H, et al, (1997) Leukemia 11:1813-1816, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), and immunologic responses limit its utility for chronic or intermittent treatment. Donadio, D, et al, (1981) Nouv Presse Med 10:711-712; Leaustic, M, et al, (1983) Rev Rhum Mal Osteoartic 50:553-554, each incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[0004] The sub-optimal performance of available treatments for hyperuricemia has been recognized for several decades. Kissel, P, et al, (1968) Nature 217:72-7'4, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Similarly, the possibility that certain groups of patients with severe gout might benefit from a safe and effective form of injectable uricase has been recognized for many-years. Davis, FF, et al, (1978) in GB Broun, et al, (Eds.) Enzyme Engineering, Vol. 4 (pp. 169-173) New York, Plenum Press; Nishimura, H, et al, (1979) Enzyme 24:261-264; Nishimura, H, et al, (1981) Enzyme 26:49-53; Davis, S, et al, (1981) Lancet 2(8241):281-283; Abuchowski, A, et al, (1981) J Pharmacol Exp Ther 219:352-354; Chen, RH-L, et al, (1981) Biochim Biophys Acta 660:293-298; Chua, CC, et al, (1988) Ann Int Med 109:114-117; Greenberg, ML, et al, (1989) Anal Biochem 176:290-293, each incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Uricases derived from animal organs are nearly insoluble in solvents that are compatible with safe administration by injection. U.S. Patent No. 3,616,231, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Certain uricases derived from plants or from microorganisms are more soluble in medically acceptable solvents. However, injection of the microbial enzymes quickly induces immunological responses that can lead to life-threatening allergic reactions or to inactivation and/or accelerated clearance of the uricase from the circulation. Donadio, et al, (1981); Leaustic, et al, (1983). Enzymes based on the deduced amino acid sequences of uricases from mammals,<br><br>

including pig and baboon, or from insects, such as, for example, Drosophila melanogaster or Drosophilapseudoobscura (Wallrath, LL, et al, (1990) Mol Cell Biol 10:5114-5127, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), have not been suitable candidates for clinical use, due to problems of immunogenicity and insolubility at physiological pH.<br>
[0005] Previously, investigators have used injected uricase to catalyze the conversion of uric acid to allantoin in vivo. See Pui, et al, (1997). This is the basis for the use in France and Italy of<br>
uricase from the fungus Aspergillus flavus (Uricozyme®) to prevent or temporarily correct the hyperuricemia associated with cytotoxic therapy for hematologic malignancies and to transiently reduce severe hyperuricemia in patients with gout. Potaux, L, et al, (1975) Nouv Presse Med 4:1109-1112; Legoux, R, et al, (1992) J Biol Chem 267:8565-8570; U.S. Patents 5,382,518 and 5,541,098, each incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Because of its short circulating<br>
lifetime, Uricozyme® requires daily injections. Furthermore, it is not well suited for long-term therapy because of its immunogenicity.<br>
[0006] Certain uricases are useful for preparing conjugates with poly(ethylene glycol) or poly(ethylene oxide) (both referred to as PEG) to produce therapeutically efficacious forms of uricase having increased protein half-life and reduced immunogenicity. U.S. Patents 4,179,337, 4,766,106, 4,847,325, and 6,576,235; U.S. Patent Application Publication US2003/0082786A1, each incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Conjugates of uricase with polymers other than PEG have also been described. U.S. Patent 4,460,683, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[0007] In nearly all of the reported attempts to PEGylate uricase (i.e. to covalently couple PEG to uricase), the PEG is attached primarily to amino groups, including the amino-terminal residue and the available lysine residues. In the uricases commonly used, the total number of<br><br>
Attorney's Docket No.: BTG-002PC<br>
-4-<br>
lysines in each of the four identical subunits is between 25 (Aspergillus flavus (U.S. Patent 5,382,518, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety)) and 29 (pig (Wu, X, et al., (1989) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 86:9412-9416, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety)). Some of the lysines are unavailable for PEGylation in the native conformation of the enzyme. The most common approach to reducing the immunogenicity of uricase has been to couple large numbers of strands of low molecular weight PEG. This has invariably resulted in large decreases in the enzymatic activity of the resultant conjugates.<br>
[0008] A single intravenous injection of a preparation of Candida utilis uricase coupled to 5 kDa PEG reduced serum urate to undetectable levels in five human subjects whose average pre-injection serum urate concentration is 6.2 mg/dl, which is within the normal range. Davis, et al, (1981). The subjects were given an additional injection four weeks later, but their responses were not reported. No antibodies to uricase were detected following the second (and last) injection, using a relatively insensitive gel diffusion assay. This reference reported no results from chronic or subchronic treatments of human patients or experimental animals.<br>
[0009] A preparation of uricase from Arthrobacter protoformiae coupled to 5 kDa PEG was used to temporarily control hyperuricemia in a single patient with lymphoma whose pre-injection serum urate concentration is 15 mg/dL. Chua, et al., (1988). Because of the critical condition of the patient and the short duration of treatment (four injections during 14 days), it is not possible to evaluate the long-term efficacy or safety of the conjugate.<br>
[0010] Improved protection from immune recognition is enabled by modifying each uricase subunit with 2-10 strands of high molecular weight PEG (&gt;5 kD - 120 kD) Saifer, et al. (U.S. Patent 6,576,235; (1994) Adv Exp Med Biol 366:377-387, each incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). This strategy enabled retention of &gt;75% enzymatic activity of uricase from<br><br>
Attorney's Docket No.: BTG-002PC<br>
-5-<br>
various species, following PEGylation, enhanced the circulating life of uricase, and enabled repeated injection of the enzyme without eliciting antibodies in mice and rabbits.<br>
[0011] Hershfield and Kelly (International Patent Publication WO 00/08196; U.S. Application No. 60/095,489, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) developed means for providing recombinant uricase proteins of mammalian species with optimal numbers of PEGylation sites. They used PCR techniques to increase the number of available lysine residues at selected points on the enzyme which is designed to enable reduced recognition by the immune system, after subsequent PEGylation, while substantially retaining the enzyme's uricolytic activity. Some of their uricase proteins are truncated at the carboxy and/or amino termini. They do not provide for directing other specific genetically-induced alterations in the protein.<br>
[0012] In this application, the term "immunogenicity" refers to the induction of an immune response by an injected preparation of PEG-modified or unmodified uricase (the antigen), while "antigenicity" refers to the reaction of an antigen with preexisting antibodies. Collectively, antigenicity and immunogenicity are referred to as "immunoreactivity." In previous studies of PEG-uricase, immunoreactivity is assessed by a variety of methods, including: 1) the reaction in vitro of PEG-uricase with preformed antibodies; 2) measurements of induced antibody synthesis; and 3) accelerated clearance rates after repeated injections.<br>
[0013] Previous attempts to eliminate the immunogenicity of uricases from several sources by coupling various numbers of strands of PEG through various linkers have met with limited success. PEG-uricases were first disclosed by FF Davis and by Y Inada and their colleagues. Davis, et al., (1978); U.S. Patent 4,179,337; Nishimura, et al., (1979); Japanese Patents 55-99189 and 62-55079, each incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The conjugate disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,179,337 is synthesized by reacting uricase of unspecified origin with a 2,000-fold<br><br>
Attorney's Docket No.: BTG-002PC<br>
-6-<br>
molar excess of 750 dalton PEG, indicating that a large number of polymer molecules is likely to have been attached to each uricase subunit. U.S. Patent 4,179,337 discloses the coupling of either PEG or poly(propylene glycol) with molecular weights of 500 to 20,000 daltons, preferably about 500 to 5,000 daltons, to provide active, water-soluble, non-immunogenic conjugates of various polypeptide hormones and enzymes including oxidoreductases, of which uricase is one of three examples. In addition, U.S. Patent 4,179,337 emphasizes the coupling of 10 to 100 polymer strands per molecule of enzyme, and the retention of at least 40% of enzymatic activity. No test results were reported for the extent of coupling of PEG to the available amino groups of uricase, the residual specific uricolytic activity, or the immunoreactivity of the conjugate.<br>
[0014] In previous publications, significant decreases in uricolytic activity measured in vitro were caused by coupling various numbers of strands of PEG to uricase from Candida utilis. Coupling a large number of strands of 5 kDa PEG to porcine liver uricase gave similar results, as described in both the Chen publication and a symposium report by the same group. Chen, et al., (1981); Davis, et al., (1978).<br>
[0015] In seven previous studies, the immunoreactivity of uricase is reported to be decreased by PEGylation and was eliminated in five other studies. In three of the latter five studies, the elimination of immunoreactivity is associated with profound decreases in uricolytic activity - to at most 15%, 28%, or 45% of the initial activity. Nishimura, et al., (1979) (15% activity); Chen, et al., (1981) (28% activity); Nishimura, et al., (1981) (45% activity). In the fourth report, PEG is reported to be coupled to 61% of the available lysine residues, but the residual specific activity is not stated. Abuchowski, et al., (1981). However, a research team that included two of the same scientists and used the same methods reported elsewhere that this extent of coupling left residual activity of only 23-28%. Chen, et al., (1981). The 1981 publications of Abuchowski et al., and<br><br>
Attorney's Docket No.: BTG-002PC<br>
-7-<br>
Chen et al., indicate that to reduce the immunogenicity of uricase substantially. PEG must be coupled to approximately 60% of the available lysine residues. The fifth publication in which the immunoreactivity of uricase is reported to have been eliminated does not disclose the extent of PEG coupling, the residual uricolytic activity, or the nature of the PEG-protein linkage. Veronese, FM, et al., (1997) in JM Harris, et al., (Eds.), Poly(ethylene glycol) Chemistry and Biological Applications. ACS Symposium Series 680 (pp. 182-192) Washington, DC: American Chemical Society, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[0016] Conjugation of PEG to a smaller fraction of the lysine residues in uricase reduced but did not eliminate its immunoreactivity in experimental animals. Tsuji, J, et al., (1985) Int J Immunopharmacol 7:725-730, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety (28-45% of the amino groups coupled); Yasuda, Y, et al., (1990) Chem Pharm Bull 38:2053-2056, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety (38% of the amino groups coupled). The residual uricolytic activities of the corresponding adducts ranged from 
[0017] A PEGylated preparation of uricase from Candida utilis that is safely administered twice to each of five humans is reported to have retained only 11% of its initial activity. Davis, et al., (1981). Several years later, PEG-modified uricase from Arthrobacter protoformiae was administered four times to one patient with advanced lymphoma and severe hyperuricemia. Chua, et al., (1988). While the residual activity of that enzyme preparation was not measured, Chua, et al., demonstrated the absence of anti-uricase antibodies in the patient's serum 26 days after the first PEG-uricase injection, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).<br><br>
Attorney's Docket No.: BTG-002PC<br>
-8-<br>
[0018] Previous studies of PEGylated uricase show that catalytic activity is markedly depressed by coupling a sufficient number of strands of PEG to decrease its immunoreactivity substantially. Furthermore, most previous preparations of PEG-uricase are synthesized using PEG activated with cyanuric chloride, a triazine derivative (2,4,6-trichloro-l,3,5-triazine) that has been shown to introduce new antigenic determinants and to induce the formation of antibodies in rabbits. Tsuji, et al., (1985).<br>
[0019] Japanese Patent No. 3-148298 to A Sano, et al., incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, discloses modified proteins, including uricase, derivatized with PEG having a molecular weight of 1-12 kDa that show reduced antigenicity and "improved prolonged" action, and methods of making such derivatized peptides. However, there are no disclosures regarding strand counts, enzyme assays, biological tests or the meaning of "improved prolonged." Japanese Patents 55-99189 and 62-55079, each incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, both to Y Inada, disclose uricase conjugates prepared with PEG-triazine or bis-PEG-triazine (denoted as PEG2), respectively. See Nishimura, et al., (1979 and 1981). In the first type of<br>
conjugate, the molecular weights of the PEGs are 2 kDa and 5 kDa, while in the second, only 5 kDa PEG is used. Nishimura, et ah, (1979) reported the recovery of 15% of the uricolytic activity after modification of 43% of the available lysines with linear 5 kDa PEG, while Nishimura, et al, (1981) reported the recovery of 31% or 45% of the uricolytic activity after modification of 46% or 36% of the lysines, respectively, with PEG2.<br>
[0020] Previously studied uricase proteins were either natural or recombinant proteins. However, studies using SDS-PAGE and/or Western techniques revealed the presence of unexpected low molecular weight peptides which appear to be degradation products and increase<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0038] Previous studies teach that when a significant reduction in the immunogenicity and/or antigenicity of uricase is achieved by PEGylation, it is invariably associated with a substantial loss of uricolytic activity. The safety, convenience and cost-effectiveness of biopharmaceuticals are all adversely impacted by decreases in their potencies and the resultant need to increase the administered dose. Thus, there is a need for a safe and effective alternative means for lowering elevated levels of uric acid in body fluids, including blood. The present invention provides a<br><br>
Attorney's Docket No.: BTG-002PC<br>
- 14-<br>
mutant recombinant uricase, wherein the uricase has been truncated by 1 - 20 amino acids at either the amino terminus or the carboxy terminus, or both, and substantially retains uricolytic activity of the naturally occurring uricase.<br>
[0039] Uricase, as used herein, includes individual subunits, as well as the tetramer, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
[0040] Mutated uricase, as used herein, refers to uricase molecules having amino acids exchanged with other amino acids.<br>
[0041] A conservative mutation, as used herein, is a mutation of one or more amino acids, at or around a position, that does not substantially alter the protein's behavior. In a preferred embodiment, the uricase comprising at least one conservative mutation has the same uricase activity as does uricase without such mutation. In alternate embodiments, the uricase comprising at least one conservative mutation has substantially the same uricase activity, within 5% of the activity, within 10% of the activity, or within 30% of the activity of uricase without such mutation.<br>
[0042] Conservative amino acid substitution is defined as a change in the amino acid composition by way of changing amino acids of a peptide, polypeptide or protein, or fragment thereof. In particular embodiments, the uricase has one, two, three or four conservative mutations. The substitution is of amino acids with generally similar properties (e.g., acidic, basic, aromatic, size, positively or negatively charged, polar, non-polar) such that the substitutions do not substantially alter peptide, polypeptide or protein characteristics (e.g., charge, IEF, affinity, avidity, conformation, solubility) or activity. Typical substitutions that<br><br>
Attorney's Docket No.: BTG-002PC<br>
-15-<br>
may be performed for such conservative amino acid substitution may be among the groups of amino acids as follows:<br>
[0043] glycine (G), alanine (A), valine (V), leucine (L) and isoleucine (I)<br>
[0044] aspartic acid (D) and glutamic acid (E)<br>
[0045] alanine (A), serine (S) and threonine (T)<br>
[0046] histidine (H), lysine (K) and arginine (R)<br>
[0047] asparagine (N) and glutamine (Q)<br>
[0048] phenylalanine (F), tyrosine (Y) and tryptophan (W)<br>
[0049] The protein having one or more conservative substitutions retains its structural<br>
stability and can catalyze a reaction even though its DNA sequence is not the same as that of the<br>
original protein.<br>
[0050] Truncated uricase, as used herein, refers to uricase molecules having shortened primary amino acid sequences. Amongst the possible truncations are truncations at or around the amino and/or carboxy termini. Specific truncations of this type may be such that the ultimate amino acids (those of the amino and/or carboxy terminus) of the naturally occurring protein are present in the truncated protein. Amino terminal truncations may begin at position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. Preferably, the amino terminal truncations begin at position 2, thereby leaving the amino terminal methionine. This methionine may be removed by post-translational modification. In particular embodiments, the amino terminal methionine is removed after the uricase is produced. In a particular embodiment, the methionine is removed by endogenous bacterial aminopeptidase.<br>
[0051] A truncated uricase, with respect to the full length sequence, has one or more amino acid sequences excluded. A protein comprising a truncated uricase may include any amino acid sequence in addition to the truncated uricase sequence, but does not include a protein comprising<br><br>
Attorney's Docket No.: BTG-002PC<br>
-16-<br>
a uricase sequence containing any additional sequential wild type amino acid sequence. In other words, a protein comprising a truncated uricase wherein the truncation begins at position 6 (i.e., the truncated uricase begins at position 7) does not have, immediately upstream from the truncated uricase, whatever amino acid that the wild type uricase has at position 6.<br>
[0052] Unless otherwise indicated by specific reference to another sequence or a particular SEQ ID NO., reference to the numbered positions of the amino acids of the uricases described herein is made with respect to the numbering of the amino acids of the pig uricase sequence. The amino acid sequence of pig uricase and the numbered positions of the amino acids comprising that sequence may be found in Figure 3. As used herein, reference to amino acids or nucleic acids "from position X to position Y" means the contiguous sequence beginning at position X and ending at position Y, including the amino acids or nucleic acids at both positions X and Y.<br>
[0053] Uricase genes and proteins have been identified in several mammalian species, for example, pig, baboon, rat, rabbit, mouse, and rhesus monkey. The sequences of various uricase proteins are described herein by reference to their public data base accession numbers, as follows: gi|50403728|sp|P25689; gi|20513634|dbj|BAB91555.1; gi| 17661 O|gbjAAA35395.1; gi|20513654|dbj|BAB91557.1; gi|47523606|ref|NP_999435.1; gi|6678509|ref|NP_033500.1; gi|57463|emb|CAA31490.1; gi|20127395|ref|NP_446220.1; gi|137107|sp|Pl 1645; gi|51458661|ref|XP_497688.1; gi|207619|gb|AAA42318.1; gi|26340770|dbj|BAC34047.1; and gi|57459|emb|CAA30378.1.

This mutation surprisingly does not significantly alter the uricase activity of the protein.<br>
[0058] In an embodiment of the invention, amino acids at or around any of amino acids 7, 46, and 291, and 301 are mutated. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, amino acids 7, 46, and 291, and 301, themselves, are mutated.<br><br>

[0059] In particular embodiments, the protein is encoded by a nucleic acid that encodes an N-terminal methionine. Preferably, the N-terminal methionine is followed by a codon that allows for removal of this N-terminal methionine by bacterial methionine aminopeptidase (MAP). (Ben-Bassat and Bauer (1987) Nature 326:315, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Amino acids allowing the most complete removal of the N-terminal methionine are alanine, glycine, proline, serine, and threonine.<br>
[0060] In an embodiment of the invention, the amino acids at or around positions 7 and/or 46 are substituted by threonine. Surprisingly, the enzymatic activity of truncated uricases prepared with these mutations is similar to that of the non-truncated enzyme. In a further embodiment of the invention, the amino acid mutations comprise threonine, threonine, lysine, and serine, at positions 7, 46, 291, and 301, respectively.<br>
[0061] The truncated mammalian uricases disclosed herein may further comprise a methionine at the amino terminus.

[0080] The subject invention provides a method for producing the nucleic acid sequence, comprising modification by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) techniques of a nucleic acid sequence encoding a nontruncated uricase. One skilled in the art knows that a desired nucleic acid sequence is prepared by PCR via synthetic oligonucleotide primers, which are complementary to regions of the target DNA (one for each strand) to be amplified. The primers are added to the target DNA (that need not be pure), in the presence of excess deoxynucleotides and Taq polymerase, a heat stable DNA polymerase. In a series (typically 30) of temperature cycles, the target DNA is repeatedly denatured (around 90°C), annealed to the primers (typically at 50-60°C) and a daughter strand extended from the primers (72°C). As the daughter strands themselves act as templates for subsequent cycles, DNA fragments matching both primers are amplified exponentially, rather than linearly.<br>

[0101] In an embodiment of the invention, the composition of uricase is used for reducing uric acid in a biological fluid comprising blood.<br>
[0102] Also provided are novel nucleic acid molecules encoding uricase polypeptides. The manipulations which result in their production are well known to the one of skill in the art. For example, uricase nucleic acid sequences can be modified by any of numerous strategies known in the art (Maniatis, T., 1990, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2d ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.). The sequence can be cleaved at appropriate sites with restriction endonuclease(s), followed by further enzymatic modification if desired, isolated, and ligated in vitro. In the production of the gene encoding a uricase, care should be taken to ensure that the modified gene remains within the appropriate translational reading frame, uninterrupted by translational stop signals. Additionally, the uricase-encoding nucleic acid sequence can be mutated in vitro or in vivo, to create and/or destroy translation, initiation, and/or termination sequences, or to create variations in coding regions and/or form new restriction<br><br>

endonuclease sites or destroy preexisting ones, to facilitate further in vitro modification. Any technique for mutagenesis known in the art can be used, including but not limited to, in vitro site-directed mutagenesis (Hutchinson, C, et al., 1978, J. Biol. Chem 253:6551), use of TAB® linkers (Pharmacia), etc.<br>
[0103] The nucleotide sequence coding for a uricase protein can be inserted into an appropriate expression vector, i.e., a vector which contains the necessary elements for the transcription and translation of the inserted protein-coding sequence. A variety of host-vector systems may be utilized to express the protein-coding sequence. These include but are not limited to mammalian cell systems infected with virus (e.g., vaccinia virus, adenovirus, etc.); insect cell systems infected with virus (e.g., baculovirus); microorganisms such as yeast containing yeast vectors, or bacteria transformed with bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA, or cosmid DNA. The expression elements of these vectors vary in their strengths and specificities. Depending on the host-vector system utilized, any one of a number of suitable transcription and translation elements may be used.<br>
[0104] Any of the methods known for the insertion of DNA fragments into a vector may be used to construct expression vectors containing a chimeric gene consisting of appropriate transcriptional/translational control signals and the protein coding sequences. These methods may include in vitro recombinant DNA and synthetic techniques and in vivo recombinations (genetic recombination). Expression of nucleic acid sequence encoding uricase protein may be regulated by a second nucleic acid sequence so that uricase protein is expressed in a host transformed with the recombinant DNA molecule. For example, expression of uricase may be controlled by any promoter/enhancer element known in the art. Promoters which may be used to control uricase expression include, but are not limited to, the SV40 early promoter region<br><br>

(Bernoist and Chambon, 1981, Nature 290:304-310), the promoter contained in the 3' long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus (Yamamoto, et al., 1980, Cell 22:787-797), the herpes thymidine kinase promoter (Wagner et al., 1981, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78:144-1445), the regulatory sequences of the met allothionine gene (Brinster et al., 1982, Nature 296:39-42); prokaryotic expression vectors such as the |3-lactamase promoter (Villa-Kamaroff, et al., 1978, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75:3727-3731), the tac promoter (DeBoer, et al., 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80:21-25), and the osmB promoter. In particular embodiments, the nucleic acid comprises a nucleic acid sequence encoding the uricase operatively linked to a heterologous promoter.<br>
[0105] Once a particular recombinant DNA molecule comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding is prepared and isolated, several methods known in the art may be used to propagate it. Once a suitable host system and growth conditions are established, recombinant expression vectors can be propagated and prepared in quantity. As previously explained, the expression vectors which can be used include, but are not limited to, the following vectors or their derivatives: human or animal viruses such as vaccinia virus or adenovirus; insect viruses such as baculovirus; yeast vectors; bacteriophage vectors (e.g., lambda), and plasmid and cosmid DNA vectors, to name but a few.<br>
[0106] In addition, a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Expression from certain promoters can be elevated in the presence of certain inducers; thus, expression of the genetically engineered uricase protein may be controlled. Furthermore, different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the translational and post-translational processing and modification (e.g., glycosylation, cleavage) of proteins.

cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the desired modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. Different vector/host expression systems may effect processing reactions such as proteolytic cleavages to different extents.<br>
[0107] In particular embodiments of the invention, expression of uricase in E. coli is preferably performed using vectors which comprise the osmB promoter.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1. Construction Of Gene And Expression Plasmid For Uricase Expression [0108] Recombinant porcine uricase (urate oxidase), Pig-KS-AN (amino terminus truncated<br>
pig uricase protein replacing amino acids 291 and 301 with lysine and serine, respectively) was expressed in E. coli K-12 strain W3110 F-. A series of plasmids was constructed culminating in pOUR-P-AN-ks-1, which upon transformation of the E. coli host cells was capable of directing efficient expression of uricase.<br>
Isolation And Subcloning Of Uricase cDNA From Pig And Baboon Liver [0109] Uricase cDNAs were prepared from pig and baboon livers by isolation and<br>
subcloning of the relevant RNA. Total cellular RNA was extracted from pig and baboon livers (Erlich, H. A. (1989). PCR Technology; Principles and Application for DNA Amplification; Sambrook, J., et al. (1989). Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd edition; Ausubel, F. M. et al. (1998). Current protocols in molecular Biology), then reverse-transcribed using the First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Pharmacia Biotech). PCR amplification was performed using Taq DNA polymerase (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies).<br>
[0110] The synthetic oligonucleotide primers used for PCR amplification of pig and baboon urate oxidases (uricase) are shown in Table 1.<br><br>

[0111] Restriction enzyme sequences, introduced at the ends of the primers and shown in lowercase in Table 1, were sense EcoRI and Ncol (pig and baboon) and anti-sense Ncol, Hindlll and Xbal (pig), Xbal and Ncol (baboon). In the baboon sense primer, the third codon GAC (aspartic acid) present in baboon uricase was replaced with CAC (histidine), the codon that is present at this position in the coding sequence of the human urate oxidase pseudogene. The recombinant baboon uricase construct generated using these primers is named D3H Baboon Uricase.<br>
[0112] The pig uricase PCR product was digested with EcoRI and Hindlll and cloned into pUC18 to create pUC18 - Pig Uricase. The D3H Baboon Uricase PCR product was cloned directly into pCR™II vector, using TA Cloning™ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), creating pCR™II -D3H Baboon Uricase.<br><br>

[0113] Ligated cDNAs were used to transform E. coli strain XL 1-Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Plasmid DNA containing cloned uricase cDNA was prepared, and clones which possess the published uricase DNA coding sequences (except for the D3H substitution in baboon uricase, shown in Table 1) were selected and isolated. In the pCR™II - D3H Baboon Uricase clone chosen, the pCR™II sequences were next to the uricase stop codon, resulting from deletion of sequences introduced by PCR. As a consequence, the Xbal and Ncol restriction sites from the 3' untranslated region were eliminated, thus allowing directional cloning using Ncol at the 5' end of the PCR product and BamHI which is derived from the pCR™II vector.<br>
Subcloning Of Uricase cDNA Into pET Expression Vectors<br>
Baboon Uricase Subcloning<br>
[0114] The D3H baboon cDNA containing full length uricase coding sequence was<br>
introduced into pET-3d expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). The pCR™II - D3H Baboon Uricase was digested with Ncol and BamHI, and the 960 bp fragment was isolated. The expression plasmid pET-3d was digested with Ncol and BamHI, and the 4600 bp fragment was isolated. The two fragments were ligated to create pET-3d-D3H-Baboon.<br>
Pig-Baboon Chimera Uricase Subcloning<br>
[0115] Pig-baboon chimera (PBC) uricase was constructed in order to gain higher<br>
expression, stability, and activity of the recombinant gene. PBC was constructed by isolating the 4936 bp Ncol-Apal fragment from pET-3d-D3H-Baboon clone and ligating the isolated fragment with the 624 bp Ncol-Apal fragment isolated from pUCl 8 -Pig Uricase, resulting in the formation of pET-3d-PBC. The PBC uricase cDNA consists of the pig uricase codons 1-225 joined in-frame to codons 226-304 of baboon uricase.<br><br>

Pig-KS Uricase Subcloning<br>
[0116] Pig-KS uricase was constructed in order to add one lysine residue, which may<br>
provide an additional PEGylation site. KS refers to the amino acid insert of lysine into pig uricase, at position 291, in place of arginine (R291K). In addition, the threonine at position 301 was replaced with serine (T301S). The PigKS uricase plasmid was constructed by isolating the 4696 bp Ncol-Ndel fragment of pET-3d-D3H-Baboon, and then it was ligated with the 864 bp Ncol-Ndel fragment isolated from pUC18 - Pig Uricase, resulting in the formation of pET-3d-PigKS. The resulting PigKS uricase sequence consists of the pig uricase codons 1-288 joined in-frame to codons 289-304 of baboon uricase.<br>
Subcloning Of Uricase Sequence Under The Regulation Of The osmB Promoter<br>
[0117] The uricase gene was subcloned into an expression vector containing the osmB<br>
promoter (following the teaching of Unites States Patent No. 5,795,776, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). This vector enabled induction of protein expression in response to high osmotic pressure or culture aging. The expression plasmid pMFOA-18 contained the osmB promoter, a ribosomal binding site sequence (rbs) and a transcription terminator sequence (ter). It confers ampicillin resistance (AmpR) and expresses the recombinant human acetylcholine esterase (AChE).<br>
Subcloning Of D3H-Baboon Uricase<br>
[0118] The plasmid pMFOA-18 was digested with Ncol and BamHI, and the large fragment<br>
was isolated. The construct pET-3d-D3H-Baboon was digested with Ncol and BamHI and the 960 bp fragment, which included the D3H Baboon Uricase gene is isolated. These two fragments were ligated to create pMFOU18.<br>
[0119] The expression plasmid pMFXT133 contained the osmB promoter, a rbs (E. coli deo operon), ter (E. coli TrypA), the recombinant factor Xa inhibitor polypeptide (Fxal), and it conferred the tetracycline resistance gene (TetR). The baboon uricase gene was inserted into this<br><br>

plasmid in order to exchange the antibiotic resistance genes. The plasmid pMF0U18 was digested with Ncol, filled-in, then it was digested with Xhol, and a 1030 bp fragment was isolated. The plasmid pMFXT133 was digested with Ndel, filled-in, then it was digested with Xhol, and the large fragment was isolated. The two fragments were ligated to create the baboon uricase expression vector, pURBA16.<br>
Subcloning Of The Pig Baboon Chimera Uricase<br>
[0120] The plasmid pURBA16 was digested with Apal and AlwNI, and the 2320 bp<br>
fragment was isolated. The plasmid pMFXT133 was digested with Ndel, filled-in, then it was digested with AlwNI, and the 620 bp fragment was isolated. The construct pET-3d-PBC was digested with Xbal, filled-in, then it was digested with Apal, and the 710 bp fragment was isolated. The three fragments were ligated to create pUR-PB, a plasmid that expressed PBC uricase under the control of osmB promoter and rbs as well as the T7 rbs, which was derived from the pET-3d vector.<br>
[0121] The T7 rbs was excised in an additional step. pUR-PB was digested with Ncol, filled-in, then digested with AlwNI, and the 3000 bp fragment was isolated. The plasmid pMFXT133 was digested with Ndel, filled in and then digested with AlwNI, and the 620 bp fragment was isolated. The two fragments were ligated to form pDUR-PB, which expresses PBC under the control of the osmB promoter.<br>
Construction Of pOUR-PB-ANC<br>
[0122] Several changes were introduced into the uricase cDNA, which resulted in a<br>
substantial increase in the recombinant enzyme stability. Plasmid pOUR-PBC-ANC was constructed, in which the N-terminal six-residue maturation peptide and the tri-peptide at the C-terminus, which function in vivo as peroxysomal targeting signal, were both removed. This was<br><br>

carried out by utilizing PBC sequence in plasmid pDUR-PB and the specific oligonucleotide primers listed in Table 2, using PCR amplification.<br>
Table 2. Primers for PCR Amplification of PBC-ANC Uricase<br><br>
[0123] The restriction enzyme sequences introduced at the ends of the primers shown in bold and the non-coding regions are shown in lowercase in Table 2. Ndel is sense and Xbal is anti-sense. The anti-sense primer was also used to eliminate an internal Ndel restriction site by introducing a point mutation (underlined) which did not affect the amino acid sequence, and thus, facilitated subcloning by using Ndel.<br>
[0124] The 900 base-pair fragment generated by PCR amplification of pDUR-PB was cleaved with Ndel and Xbal and isolated. The obtained fragment was then inserted into a deo expression plasmid pDBAST-RAT-N, which harbors the deo-PlP2 promoter and rbs derived from E. coli and constitutively expresses human recombinant insulin precursor. The plasmid was digested with Ndel and Xbal and the 4035 bp fragment was isolated and ligated to the PBC-uricase PCR product. The resulting construct, pDUR-PB-ANC, was used to transform E. coli K-12 S733 (F- cytR strA) that expressed a high level of active truncated uricase. [0125] The doubly truncated PBC-ANC sequence was also expressed under the control of osmB promoter. The plasmid pDUR-PB-ANC was digested with AlwNI - Ndel, and the 3459 bp<br><br>

fragment was isolated. The plasmid pMFXT133, described above, was digested with Ndel -AlwNI, and the 660 bp fragment was isolated. The fragments were then ligated to create pOUR-PB-ANC, which was introduced into E. coli K-12 strain W3110 F" and expressed high level of active truncated uricase.<br>
Construction Of The Uricase Expression Plasmid pOUR-P-AN-ks-1<br>
[0126] This plasmid was constructed in order to improve the activity and stability of the<br>
recombinant enzyme. Pig-KS-AN uricase was truncated at the N-terminus only (AN), where the six-residue N-terminal maturation peptide was removed, and contained the mutations S46T, R291K and T301S. At position 46, there was a threonine residue instead of serine due to a conservative mutation that occurred during PCR amplification and cloning. At position 291, lysine replaced arginine, and at position 301, serine was inserted instead of threonine. Both were derived from the baboon uricase sequence. The modifications of R291K and T301S are designated KS, and discussed above. The extra lysine residue provided an additional potential PEGylation site.<br>
[0127] To construct pOUR-P-AN-ks-1 (Figure 1), the plasmid pOUR-PB-ANC was digested with Apal - Xbal, and the 3873 bp fragment was isolated. The plasmid pET-3d-PKS (construction shown in Figure 4) was digested with Apal - Spel, and the 270 bp fragment was isolated. Spel cleavage left a 5' CTAG extension that was efficiently ligated to DNA fragments generated by Xbal. The two fragments were ligated to create pOUR-P-AN-ks-1. After ligation, the Spel and Xbal recognition sites were lost (their site is shown in parenthesis in Figure 9). The construct pOUR-P-AN-ks-1 was introduced into E. coli K-12 strain W3110 F", prototrophic, ATCC # 27325. The resulting Pig-KS-AN uricase, expressed under the control of osmB promoter, yielded high levels of recombinant enzyme having superior activity and stability.<br><br>

[0128] Figure 1 illustrates the structure of plasmid pOUR-P-AN-ks-1. Numbers next to restriction sites indicate nucleotide position, relative to Haell site, designated as 1; restriction sites that were lost during cloning are marked in parenthesis. Plasmid pOUR-P-AN-ks-1, encoding Pig-KS-AN uricase is 4143 base pairs (bp) long and comprised the following elements:<br>
1.	A DNA fragment, 113 bp long, spanning from nucleotide number 1 to Ndel site<br>
(at position 113), which includes the osmB promoter and ribosome binding site<br>
(rbs).<br>
2.	A DNA fragment, 932 bp long, spanning from Ndel (at position 113) to<br>
Spel/Xbal junction (at position 1045), which includes: 900 bp of Pig-KS-AN<br>

amino acids 291 and 301 with lysine and serine, respectively, are replaced)<br>
coding region and 32 bp flanking sequence derived from pCR™ II, from the TA<br>
cloning site upstream to the Spel/Xbal restriction site.<br>
3.	A 25 bp multiple cloning sites sequence (MCS) from Spel/Xbal junction (at<br>
position 1045) to Hindlll (at position 1070).<br>
4.	A synthetic 40 bp oligonucleotide containing the TrpA transcription terminator<br>
(ter) with Hindlll (at position 1070) and Aatll (at position 1110) ends.<br>
5.	A DNA fragment, 1519 bp long, spanning from Aatll (at position 1110) to<br>
Mscl/Scal (at position 2629) sites on pBR322 that includes the tetracycline<br>
resistance gene (TetR).<br>
6.	A DNA fragment, 1514 bp long, spanning from Seal (at position 2629) to Haell<br>
(at position 4143) sites on pBR322 that includes the origin of DNA replication.<br>

sequence. Following the initiator methionine residue, a threonine was inserted in place of the aspartic acid of the pig uricase sequence. This threonine residue enabled the removal of methionine by bacterial aminopeptidase. The gap in the amino acid sequence illustrates the deleted N-terminal maturation peptide. The restriction sites that were used for the various steps of subcloning of the different uricase sequences (Apal, Ndel, BamHI, EcoRI and Spel) are indicated. The 3' untranslated sequence, shown in lowercase letters, was derived from pCR™II sequence. The translation stop codon is indicated by an asterisk.<br>
[0130] Figure 3 shows alignment of the amino acid sequences of the various recombinant uricase sequences. The upper line represents the pig uricase, which included the full amino acid sequence. The second line is the sequence of the doubly truncated pig-baboon chimera uricase (PBC-ANC). The third line shows the sequence of Pig-KS-AN uricase, that is only truncated at the N-terminus and contained the mutations S46T and the amino acid changes R291K and T301S, both reflecting the baboon origin of the carboxy terminus of the uricase coding sequence. The asterisks indicate the positions in which there are differences in amino acids in the Pig-KS-AN as compared to the published pig uricase sequence; the circles indicate positions in which there are differences in amino acids in Pig-KS-AN compared to PBC-AN, the pig-baboon chimera; and dashed lines indicate deletion of amino acids.<br>
[0131] cDNA for native baboon, pig, and rabbit uricase with the Y97H mutation, and the pig/baboon chimera (PBC) were constructed for cloning into E. coli. Clones expressing high levels of the uricase variants were constructed and selected such that all are W3110 F" E. coli, and expression is regulated by osmB. Plasmid DNAs were isolated, verified by DNA sequencing and restriction enzyme analysis, and cells were cultured.<br>
[0132] Construction of the truncated uricases, including pig-AN and Pig-KS-AN was done by cross-ligation between PBC-ANC and Pig-KS, following cleavage with restriction<br><br>

endonucleases Apal and Xbal, and Apal plus Spel, respectively. It is reasonable that these truncated mutants would retain activity, since the N-terminal six residues, the "maturation peptide" (1-2), and the C-terminal tri-peptide, "peroxisomal targeting signal" (3-5), do not have functions which significantly affect enzymatic activity, and it is possible that these sequences may be immunogenic. Clones expressing very high levels of the uricase variants were selected.<br>
Example 2. Transformation Of The Expression Plasmid Into A Bacterial Host Cell<br>
[0133] The expression plasmid, pOUR-P-AN-ks-1, was introduced into E. coli K-12 strain<br>
W3110 F. Bacterial cells were prepared for transformation involved growth to mid log phase in Luria broth (LB), then cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in cold water, and suspended in 10% glycerol, in water, at a concentration of about 3xl010 cells per ml. The cells were stored in aliquots, at -70°C. Plasmid DNA was precipitated in ethanol and dissolved in water.<br>
[0134] Bacterial cells and plasmid DNA were mixed, and transformation was done by the high voltage electroporation method using Gene Pulser II from BIO-RAD (Trevors et al (1992). Electrotransformation of bacteria by plasmid DNA, in Guide to Electroporation and Electrofusion (D.C. Chang, B. M. Chassy, J. A. Saunders and A. E. Sowers, eds.), pp. 265-290, Academic Press Inc., San Diego, Hanahan et al (1991) Meth. Enzymol., 204. 63-113). Transformed cells were suspended in SOC medium (2% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 10 mM NaCl, 2.5mM KC1, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MgSO4, 20 mM glucose), incubated, at 37°C, for 1 hour and selected for tetracycline resistance. A high expresser clone was selected.<br>
Example 3. Recombinant Uricase Preparation<br>
[0135] Bacteria such as those transformed (see above) were cultured in medium containing<br>
glucose; pH was maintained at 7.2 ± 0.2, at approximately 37°C.<br><br>

-39-<br>
[0136] Towards the last 5-6 hours of cultivation, the medium was supplemented with KC1 to a final concentration of 0.3M. Cultivation was continued to allow uricase accumulation. [0137] Recombinant uricase accumulated within bacterial cells as an insoluble precipitate similar to inclusion bodies (IBs). The cell suspension was washed by centrifugation and suspended in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0 and 10 mM EDTA and brought to a final volume of approximately 40 times the dry cell weight.<br>
[0138] Recombinant uricase-containing IBs, were isolated by centrifugation following disruption of bacterial cells using lysozyme and high pressure. Treatment with lysozyme (2000-3000 units/ml) was done for 16-20 hours at pH 8.0 and 7 ± 3°C, while mixing. The pellet was washed with water and stored at -20°C until use.<br>
[0139] The enriched IBs were further processed after suspending in 50 mM NaHCO3 buffer, pH 10.3+0.1. The suspension was incubated overnight, at room temperature, to allow solubilization of the IB-derived uricase, and subsequently clarified by centrifugation. [0140] Uricase was further purified by several chromatography steps. Initially, chromatography was done on a Q-Sepharose FF column. The loaded column was washed with bicarbonate buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, and uricase was eluted with bicarbonate buffer, containing 250 mM NaCl. Then, Xanthine-agarose resin (Sigma) was used to remove minor impurities from the uricase preparation. The Q-Sepharose FF eluate was diluted with 50 mM glycine buffer, pH 10.3±0.1, to a protein concentration of approximately 0.25 mg/ml and loaded. The column was washed with bicarbonate buffer, pH 10.3±0.1, containing 100 mM NaCl, and uricase was eluted with the same buffer supplemented with 60 uM xanthine. At this stage, the uricase was repurified by Q-Sepharose chromatography to remove aggregated forms.<br><br>

[0141] The purity of each uricase preparation is greater than 95%, as determined by size exclusion chromatography. Less than 0.5% aggregated forms are detected in each preparation using a Superdex 200 column.<br>

Example 4. Characteristics Of Recombinant Uricases<br>
SDS-PAGE<br>
[0143] SDS-PAGE analysis of the highly purified uricase variants (Figure 4) revealed a<br>
rather distinctive pattern. The samples were stored at 4°C, in carbonate buffer, pH 10.3, for up to several months. The full-length variants, Pig, Pig-KS, and PBC, show accumulation of two major degradation products having molecular weights of about 20 and 15kD. This observation suggests that at least a single nick split the uricase subunit molecule. A different degradation pattern is detected in the amino terminal shortened clones and also in the rabbit uricase, but at a lower proportion. The amino terminus of the rabbit resembles that of the shortened clones. The amino terminal sequences of the uricase fragments generated during purification and storage were determined.<br><br>
Attorney's Docket No.: BTG-002PC<br>
-41 -<br>
Peptide Sequencing<br>
[0144] N-terminal sequencing of bulk uricase preparations was done using the Edman<br>
degradation method. Ten cycles were performed. Recombinant Pig uricase (full length clone) generated a greater abundance of degradation fragments compared to Pig-KS-AN. The deduced sites of cleavage leading to the degradation fragments are as follows:<br>
1) Major site at position 168 having the sequence:<br>
-QSG ↓ FEGFI-<br>
2) Minor site at position 142 having the sequence:<br>
--IRN ↓ GPPVI-<br>
[0145] The above sequences do not suggest any known proteolytic cleavage. Nevertheless, cleavage could arise from either proteolysis or some chemical reaction. The amino-truncated uricases are surprisingly more stable than the non-amino truncated uricases. PBC-ANC also had stability similar to the other AN molecules and less than non-amino-truncated PBC.<br>
Potency<br>
[0146] Activity of uricase was measured by a UV method. Enzymatic reaction rate was<br>
determined by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 292 nm resulting from the oxidation of uric acid to allantoin. One activity unit is defined as the quantity of uricase required to oxidize one umole of uric acid per minute, at 25°C, at the specified conditions. Uricase potency is expressed in activity units per mg protein (U/mg).<br>
[0147] The extinction coefficient of 1 mM uric acid at 292 nm is 12.2 mM-1 cm-1. Therefore, oxidation of 1 umole of uric acid per ml reaction mixture resulted in a decrease in absorbance of 12.2 mA292. The absorbance change with time (AA292 per minute) was derived from the linear portion of the curve.<br><br>

-42-<br>
[0148] Protein concentration was determined using a modified Bradford method (Macart and Gerbaut (1982) Clin Chim Acta 122:93-101). The specific activity (potency) of uricase was calculated by dividing the activity in U/ml with protein concentration in mg/ml. The enzymatic activity results of the various recombinant uricases are summarized in Table 4. The results of commercial preparations are included in this table as reference values. It is apparent from these results that truncation of uricase proteins has no significant effect on their enzymatic activity. Table 4.

Example 5. Conjugation Of Uricase With m-PEG (PEGylation)<br>
[0150] Pig-KS-AN Uricase was conjugated using m-PEG-NPC (monomethoxy-<br>
poly(ethylene glycol)-nitrophenyl carbonate). Conditions resulting in 2 - 12 strands of 5, 10, or 20 kD PEG per uricase subunit were established. m-PEG-NPC was gradually added to the protein solution. After PEG addition was concluded, the uricase / m-PEG-NPC reaction mixture was then incubated at 2-8°C for 16-18 hours, until maximal unbound m-PEG strands were conjugated to uricase.<br>
[0151] The number of PEG strands per PEG-uricase monomer was determined by Superose 6 size exclusion chromatography (SEC), using PEG and uricase standards. The number of bound PEG strands per subunit was determined by the following equation:<br>

measured at 220 nm); a protein curve (measured by RI); and PEG curve (measured by RI). Then, the PEG-uricase samples were analyzed using the same system. The resulting UV and RI peak area values of the experimental samples were used to calculate the concentrations of the PEG and protein relative to the calibration curves. The index of 3.42 is the ratio between the molecular weight of uricase monomer (34,192 Daltons) to that of the 10 kD PEG. [0153] Attached PEG improved the solubility of uricase in solutions having physiological pH values. Table 5 provides an indication of the variability between batches of PEGylated Pig-KS-AN uricase product. In general, there is an inverse relation between the number of PEG strands attached and retained specific activity (SA) of the enzyme.<br>

Example 6. PEGylation of uricase with 1000 D and 100,000 D PEG<br>
[0154] Pig-KS-AN Uricase was conjugated using 1000 D and 100,000 D m-PEG-NPC as<br>
described in Example 5. Conditions resulting in 2 - 11 strands of PEG per uricase subunit were used. After PEG addition was concluded, the uricase/m-PEG-NPC reaction mixture was then<br><br>

[0155] The number of PEG strands per PEG-uricase monomer was determined as described<br>
above.<br>
[0156] Attached PEG improved the solubility of uricase in solutions having physiological pH<br>

Example 7. Pharmacokinetics Of Pig-KS-AN Uricase Conjugated With PEG [0157] Biological experiments were undertaken in order to determine the optimal extent and<br>
size of PEGylation needed to provide therapeutic benefit.<br>
[0158] Pharmacokinetic studies in rats, using i.v. injections of 0.4 mg (2U) per kg body weight of unmodified uricase, administered at day 1 and day 8, yielded a circulating half life of about 10 minutes. However, studies of the clearance rate in rats with 2-11x10kD PEG-Pig-KS-AN uricase, after as many as 9 weekly injections, indicated that clearance did not depend on the number of PEG strands (within this range) and remained relatively constant throughout the study period (see Table 6; with a half-life of about 30 hours). The week-to-week differences are within experimental error. This same pattern is apparent after nine injections of the 10x5kD PEG, and 10x20kD PEG - uricase conjugates. The results indicated that regardless of the extent of uricase PEGylation, in this range, similar biological effects were observed in the rat model.<br><br>

[0160] Rats received weekly i.v. injections of 0.4 mg per kilogram body weight of Pig-KS-AN uricase modified as indicated in the table. Each group initially comprised 15 rats, which were alternately bled in subgroups of 5. Several rats died during the study due to the anesthesia. Half-lives were determined by measuring uricase activity (colorimetric assay) in plasma samples collected at 5 minutes, and 6, 24 and 48 hours post injection.

[0162] Bioavailability studies with 6x5 kD PEG- Pig-KS-AN uricase in rabbits indicate that, after the first injection, the circulation half-life is 98.2 ± 1.8 hours (i.v.), and the bioavailability after i.m. and subcutaneous (s.c.) injections was 71% and 52%, respectively. However, significant anti-uricase antibody titers were detected, after the second i.m. and s.c. injections, in all of the rabbits, and clearance was accelerated following subsequent injections. Injections of rats with the same conjugate resulted in a half-life of 26±1.6 hours (i.v.), and the bioavailability after i.m. and s.c. injections was 33% and 22%, respectively.<br>
[0163] Studies in rats, with 9x10 kD PEG- Pig-KS-AN uricase indicate that the circulation half-life after the first injection is 42.4 hours (i.v.), and the bioavailability, after i.m. and s.c. injections, was 28.9% and 14.5%, respectively (see Figure 5 and Table 7). After the fourth injection, the circulation half-life was 32.1 ± 2.4 hours and the bioavailability, after the i.m. and s.c. injections was 26.1% and 14.9%, respectively.<br>
[0164] Similar pharmacokinetic studies, in rabbits, with 9x10 kD PEG-Pig-KS-AN uricase indicate that no accelerated clearance was observed following injection of this conjugate (4 biweekly injections were administered). In these animals, the circulation half-life after the first injection was 88.5 hours (i.v.), and the bioavailability, after i.m. and s.c. injections, was 98.3% and 84.4%, respectively (see Figure 6 and Table 7). After the fourth injection the circulation half-life was 141. 1±15.4 hours and the bioavailability, after the i.m. and s.c. injections was 85% and 83%, respectively.<br>
[0165] Similar studies with 9x10 kD PEG-Pig-KS-AN were done to assess the bioavailability in beagles (2 males and 2 females in each group). A circulation half-life of 70±l 1.7 hours was recorded after the first i.v. injection, and the bioavailability, after the i.m. and s.c. injections was 69.5% and 50.4%, respectively (see Figure 7 and Table 7).<br><br>

[0166] Studies with 9x10 kD PEG-Pig-KS-AN preparations were done using pigs. Three animals per group were used for administration via the i.v., s.c. and i.m. routes. A circulation half-life of 178±24 hours was recorded after the first i.v. injection, and the bioavailability, after the i.m. and s.c. injections was 71.6% and 76.8%, respectively (see Figure 8 and Table 7).

[0167] Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) studies were done after iodination of 9x1 OkD PEG-Pig-KS-AN uricase by the Bolton &amp; Hunter method with I25I. The labeled conjugate was injected into 7 groups of 4 rats each (2 males and 2 females). Distribution of radioactivity was analyzed after 1 hour and every 24 hours for 7 days (except day 5). Each group, in its turn, was sacrificed and the different organs were excised and analyzed. The seventh group was kept in a metabolic cage, from which the urine and feces were collected. The distribution of the material throughout the animal's body was evaluated by measuring the total radioactivity in each organ, and the fraction of counts (kidney, liver, lung, and spleen) that were available for precipitation with TCA (i.e. protein bound, normalized to the organ size). Of the organs that were excised, none had a higher specific radioactivity than the others, thus no<br><br>

significant accumulation was seen for instance in the liver or kidney. 70% of the radioactivity was excreted by day 7.<br>
Example 8. Clinical Trial Results<br>
[0168] A randomized, open-label, multicenter, parallel group study was performed to assess<br>
the urate response, and pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of PEG-uricase (Puricase®, Savient Pharmaceuticals) in human patients with hyperuricemia and severe gout who were unresponsive to or intolerant of conventional therapy. The mean duration of disease was 14 years and 70 percent of the study population had one or more tophi.<br>
[0169] In the study, 41 patients (mean age of 58.1 years) were randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with intravenous PEG-uricase at one of four dose regimens: 4 mg every two weeks (7 patients); 8 mg every two weeks (8 patients); 8 mg every four weeks (13 patients); or 12 mg every four weeks (13 patients). Plasma uricase activity and urate levels were measured at defined intervals. Pharmacokinetic parameters, mean plasma urate concentration and the percentage of time that plasma urate was less than or equal to 6 mg/dL were derived from analyses of the uricase activities and urate levels.<br>
[0170] Patients who received 8 mg of PEG-uricase every two weeks had the greatest reduction in PUA with levels below 6 mg/dL 92 percent of the treatment time (pre-treatment plasma urate of 9.1 mg/dL vs. mean plasma urate of 1.4 mg/dL over 12 weeks). [0171] Substantial and sustained lower plasma urate levels were also observed in the other PEG-uricase treatment dosing groups: PUA below 6 mg/ml 86 percent of the treatment time in the 8 mg every four weeks group (pre-treatment plasma urate of 9.1 mg/dL vs. mean plasma urate of 2.6mg/dL over 12 weeks); PUA below 6 mg/ml 84 percent of the treatment time in the 12 mg every four weeks group (pre-treatment plasma urate of 8.5 mg/dL vs. mean plasma urate of 2.6 mg/dL over 12 weeks); and PUA below 6 mg/ml 73 percent of the treatment time in the 4<br><br>

mg every two weeks group (pre-treatment plasma urate of 7.6 mg/dL vs. mean plasma urate of 4.2 mg/dL over 12 weeks).<br>
[0172] The maximum percent decrease in plasma uric acid from baseline within the first 24 hours of PEG-uricase dosing was 72% for subjects receiving 4 mg / 2 weeks (p equals .0002); 94% for subjects receiving 8 mg / 2 weeks (p less than .0001); 87% for subjects receiving 8 mg / 4 weeks (p less than .0001); and 93% for subjects receiving 12 mg / 4 weeks (p less than .0001). [0173] The percent decrease in plasma uric acid from baseline over the 12-week treatment period was 38% for subjects receiving 4 mg / 2 weeks (p equals .0002); 86% for subjects receiving 8 mg / 2 weeks (p less than .0001); 58% for subjects receiving 8 mg / 4 weeks (p equals .0003); and 67% for subjects receiving 12 mg / 4 weeks (p less than .0001). [0174] Surprisingly, some subjects receiving PEG-uricase experienced an infusion related adverse event, i.e., an infusion reaction. These reactions occurred in 14% of the total infusions.
