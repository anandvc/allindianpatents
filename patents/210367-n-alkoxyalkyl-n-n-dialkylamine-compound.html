DESCRIPTION<br>
N-ALKOXYALKYL-N,N-DIALKYLAMINE DERIVATIVES OR<br>
SALTS THEREOF AND AGENTS FOR TREATING<br>
NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES COMPRISING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to novel N-alkoxyalkyl-N,N-dialkylamine derivatives or salts thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Dementia is classified into cerebrovascular dementia and neurodegenerative dementia, and a variety of agents such as ameliorants of cerebral circulation, ameliorants of cerebral function, etc. are used for treating these diseases.<br>
The 1,2-ethanediol derivatives or salts thereof described in JP-A-3-232830 and JP-A-4-95070 are useful as the ameliorants of cerebral function, among which especially preferable is (R)-1-(benzo[b]thiophen-5-yl)-2-[2-(N,N-diethylamino)ethoxy]ethanol hydrochloride (hereinafter referred to as T-588).<br>
Among the neurodegenerative dementia, the most popular is Alzheimer's disease (hereinafter referred to as AD), which is characterized by appearance of senile plaque of which the main component<br><br>
2<br>
is an amyloid ß protein (hereinafter referred to as Aß) derived from a ß amyloid precursor protein [Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Vol. 120, Page 885 (1984)].<br>
Ap is considered to deposit on the nerve cells or blood vessels and to cause a symptom of dementia, etc. [Annual Review of Cell Biology, Vol. 10, Page 373 (1994)].<br>
Further, it has also been reported that Aß itself causes the apoptosis of cultured nerve cells (shrinkage of cell volume, a cell death, via the expression of gene, characterized by fragmentation of DNA) [Brain Research, Vol. 661, Page 147 (1994); Molecular Neurobiology, Vol. 10, Page 19 (1995)].<br>
On the other hand, a rise in the quantity of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (hereinafter referred to as HNE) in the brain of AD patients has been reported [American Journal of Pathology, Vol. 150, Page 437 (1997)], and it has also been reported that HNE takes part in the cell death of cultured nerve cells caused by AP through intermediation of peroxidation of lipids [The Journal of Neuroscience, Vol. 17, Page 1046 (1997)].<br>
It has also been reported that a cell death is caused if HNE is applied to upon cultured nerve cells, and that this cell death is apoptosis [The Journal of Neuroscience, Vol. 17, Page 5089 (1997)].<br>
Further, a possibility that HNE is produced by an oxidation stress in various neurodegenerative<br><br>
3 diseases and the HNE exerts damage to nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.  For example, a rise in the quantity of HNE has been reported in the brain of patients of the Parkinson's disease [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 93, Page 2696 (1996)], and in the spinal cord of patients of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [Annals of Neurology, Vol. 44, Page 696 (1998)].<br>
For these reasons, agents for controlling the neurocytotoxicity caused by Ap and HNE are being studied for treating the neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc.<br>
Now, it is well known that neurotrophic factors such as a nerve growth factor (NGF) affecting the growth and regeneration of nerves exist in living organisms.<br>
The neurotrophic factors are reported to interact not only to the central nervous diseases such as Alzheimer's disease but also to the peripheral nervous diseases such as diabetic neuropathy, drug-induced neuropathy, etc., and attempts are being made to use the neurotrophic factors for treatment of these diseases [Nou to Shinkei, Vol. 43, No. 12, Page 1101<br>
(1991)].<br>
Further, it has been reported that the impairment in the neuronal conduction in model animals with crushed sciatic nerve can be ameliorated by the<br><br>
4 regeneration of nerves promoted by NGF [Microsurgery, Vol. 16, Page 547 (1995)].  However, since neurotrophic factor is a protein of high molecular weight, there are many unsolved technical problems to apply it to nervous diseases.<br>
Thus, it is demanded to develop a low molecular weight compound which is the same in function as the neurotrophic factor.<br>
T-588 which is useful as a cerebral function ameliorant exhibits a protective action on the nerve cell death caused by Ap [Society for Neuroscience, Abstracts, Vol. 24, No. 1, Page 228 (1998)], and further has an activity of reinforcing the function of NGF (W096/12717), and is useful as an agent for treating the diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems.  However, a low molecular compound having yet stronger nerve cell-protecting and nerve regeneration-promoting activities with an intense anti-hypoxic activity is awaited.<br>

Next, the pharmacological activities of the<br>
typical compounds of the present invention will be described.<br><br>
75 [Anti-hypoxic Activity]<br>
A test compound (100 mg/kg) dissolved in distilled water is orally administered to ddY male mice of 5-6 weeks age (6-10 heads per group).  Thirty minutes after the administration, each mouse was introduced into a glass vessel, and a gas mixture consisting of 4% of oxygen and 96% of nitrogen was passed through the glass vessel at a rate of 5 L/minute.  The period of the time from the beginning of sending the gas to the death of the animal was measured.<br>
To the control group, only distilled water was orally given.  Anti-hypoxic activity of test compound was calculated according to the following equation:<br>
(Survival time of mouse in administered group)  (Survival time of mouse in control group) x 100 (%) As the result, the hypoxic activities were as follows: the compound of Example 10: 170%, the compound of Example 13: 160%, the compound of Example 16: 158%, the compound of Example 20: 155%, the compound of Example 31: 248%, the compound of Example 49: 173%, the compound of Example 53: 200%, the compound of Example 68: 202%, the compound of Example 70: 213%, the compound of Example 76: 194%,<br><br>
76 the compound of Example 101: 187%, the compound of Example 102: 210%, the compound of Example 144: 250%, the compound of Example 158: 179%.<br>
[Nerve-regeneration Promoting Activity]<br>
The test was carried out according to the description of Experimental Neurology, Vol. 140, Page 198 (1996).<br>
SD rats (male, 6 weeks age, body weight 160-200 g) were anesthetized with Pentobarbital.  The left sciatic nerve was exposed from the upper femoral muscular texture and peeled off from the surrounding texture, while taking care so as to give no injury to the muscular fiber.<br>
By means of a needle holder with a flattened and smoothed contact surface, the sciatic nerve was pressed and crushed for a period of 90 seconds in a zone extending over about 10 mm from the branched part and having a width of 1.5 mm at the central portion. The crushed zone was marked with a thread at the end of neurilemma, and the operated portion was sutured.  One hour after the crushing, a test compound dissolved in physiological salt solution was administered intra-abdominally at a dosage of 10 mg/kg.  Thereafter, the same administration as above was repeated twice per day far 5 days.<br>
Six days after the operation, the operated<br><br>
77 portion was again opened under an anesthesia using Pentobarbital to expose the sciatic nerve, and a forceps was made to contact to the nerve from a position about 25 mm distant from the crushed part. The forceps was slowly moved toward the crushed part until a reflex reaction appeared.  The distance between the portion exhibiting reflex and the crushed portion was measured, and regarded as a regeneration distance. To the control group, only a saline was given.<br>
The sciatic nerve regeneration rate of the test compound was calculated according to the following equation:<br>
(Regeneration distance in administration group) ÷ (Regeneration distance in control group) x 100 (%) As a result, the regeneration rates of sciatic nerve were as follows:<br>
the compound of Example 10: 117%, the compound of Example 16: 115%, the compound of Example 27: 126%.<br>
[An activity of inhibiting the Ap-induced nerve cell<br>
death]<br>
The effect of inhibiting the death of cultured nerve cell induced by Ap was examined by a modification of the method described in Brain Research, Vol. 639, Page 240 (1994).<br>
Cerebral cortex excised from the brain of an embryo of Wistar rat (embryonal age 17-19 days) was cut<br><br>
78 into small pieces and then treated with trypsin to dissociate the nerve cells.  The cells were spread onto a 48-well tissue-culture plate at a rate of lx105 cells per well, and cultured under a condition of 5% carbon dioxide, 37°C, in a Dulbecco modified Eagle medium to which B27 additives (product of GIBCO BRL) and 3.6 mg/mL glucose were added.<br>
When the cultured had been continued for 12-13 days, a solution of potassium chloride was added so as to give a final concentration of 25 mmol/L, immediately after which a test agent was added.  Twenty four hours after addition of the test agent, Ap {25-35 peptide residues) dissolved in distilled water was added so as to give a final concentration of 20 fimol/L. Twenty four hours after addition of Ap, the medium was changed to a medium prepared by adding test compound to Dulbecco modified Eagle medium to which B27 and 3.6 mg/mL glucose were added.<br>
The inhibitory activity of test agent on the cultured nerve cell death was expressed by using the activity of inhibiting the decrease of MTT reducing ability as an index.  That is, 48 hours after changing the medium, MTT assay developed by Mossmann [Journal of Immunological Methods, Vol. 65, Page 55 (1983)] was carried out, and the inhibition rate (%) of the agent on the decrease of MTT assay value induced by Aß was calculated.<br><br>
79<br>
Inhibition rate =<br>
[ (Aß + MTT assay value of agent-added group) -(MTT assay value of Ap-added group)] ÷ [MTT assay value of no addition group -MTT assay value of Aß-added group] x 100<br>
As a result, at a concentration of 0.1 µM, the inhibition rates were as follows:<br>
the compound of Example 68: 28%, the compound of Example 119: 39%, the compound of Example 137: 37%.<br>
[Activity of inhibiting the HNE-induced nerve cell death]<br>
The protecting effect against the death of cultured nerve cells induced by HNE was examined by a modification of the method described in the Journal of Neuroscience, Vol. 17, Page 5089 (1997).<br>
Cerebral cortex excised from the brain of an embryo of Wistar rat (embryonal age 17-19 days) was cut into small pieces and then treated with trypsin to dissociate the nerve cells.  The cells were spread onto a 48-well tissue-culture plate at a rate of 5xl05 cells per well, and cultured under a condition of 5% carbon dioxide, 37°C, in a Dulbecco modified Eagle medium to which 10% fetal calf serum and 3.6 mg/mL glucose were<br>
added.<br>
In order to inhibit the proliferation of glia<br>
cells, cytosine arabinoside was added so as to give a<br><br>
80<br>
final concentration of 10 µmol/L, from the day one after starting the culture.  When the culture had been continued for 2 days, the medium was changed to a Dulbecco modified Eagle medium to which 10% fetal calf serum and 3.6 mg/mL glucose were added.  When the culture had been continued for 7-8 days, a test agent was added, after which HNE was immediately added so as to give a final concentration of 25 µmol/L.<br>
The inhibitory activity of an agent on the cultured nerve cell death was decreased by using the inhibitory activity on the depression of MTT reducing ability as an index.  That is, 24 hours after addition of a test agent, MTT assay [Journal of Immunological Methods, Vol. 65, Page 55 (1983)] developed by Mossmann was carried out, based on which inhibitory rate (%) of the agent on the decrease of MTT assay induced by HNE was calculated. Inhibitory rate [MTT assay value of (HNE+agent)-added group) - (MTT assay value of HNE-added group)] ÷   (MTT assay value of no addition group -<br>
MTT assay value of HNE-added group)] x 100 As a result, at a concentration of 0.1 ?M, the inhibitory rates were as follows:<br>
the compound of Example 10: 58%, the compound of Example 20: 69%, the compound of Example 68: 57%, the compound of Example 76: 49%,<br><br>
81 the compound of Example 105: 31%.<br>
