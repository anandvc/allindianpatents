Such compound microscopes as illustrated in accompanying figure 1 usually comprise of a objective closer to the object to be viewed and an eye piece serving as view point of the magnified image of the object, said objective and eye piece being connected through a body tube and an extended tube, a slide table mounted with respect to said base portion of the microscope providing for accommodating and positioning of the object to be viewed thereunder said objective, diffused light source further provided thereunder said slide table for viewing the object. The optical parts of the compound microscope are the said objective and the said eye piece. The focal length of the objective is very small while that of the eye piece is somewhat larger. The principle of the magnification achieved in such compound microscope are as discussed hereunder with relation to accompanying figure 2.<br>
A small obj ect (PQ) placed j ust beyond the first focal plane (Fo1) of the objective provided for a real magnified and inverted image (P1Q1) . For distinct vision the distance (Dt) of the final image (P2Q2) form the eye piece is approximately 25cm while for normal vision the distance is infinity. In such system, the distance of separation (g) between the objective image (P1Q1) and the second focal plane (Fo) of the objective is maintained greater than or equal to the distance of separation (FoFe') between the two adjacent focal points of the objective of the eye piece.<br>
1<br><br>
The magnification achieved through such conventional compound microscope is as detailed hereunder :<br><br><br><br>
= mo x me<br>

As illustrated in said figures 12A &amp; 12B the view finder is shown hinged with respect to the support plate extending from said height adjusting means at point (D) . In accordance with an aspect of the invention the view finder can have plurality of view points of different magnifying capacity. In said figure 12A, references A &amp; C, show two distinct view points with different magnification capacity. Accordingly while magnification of one capacity can be viewed by pointing the view finder (A) towards the aperture on the housing, the magnification of other mangitude can be view by rotating the view finder about the hinge axis at point £B) positioned the view point (C) above the aperture on the top surface. In such manner it is possible to provide plurality of view points of the different magnification capacity in a single view finder for extended and varied application.<br>
Reference is now invited to Fig. 13 which illustrates the magnifying process of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 13 shows the diagram of its working principle.<br>
AB is an object placed near its view point 0. Then an magnified image A, B can be seen by the eye E placed closer to the view point 0. all kinds of optical errors can be minimise due to very small aperture of the plate. Suppose for distinct vision of an object AB is formed a high magnified image A, B, at a distance 'X' from the point 0.<br>
12<br><br>
Then,<br><br>
For example in the embodiment of the view finder of the invention according to Figure 1 with the following components specification the magnification achieved is as discussed hereunder :<br>
Thickness of metal plate      = 1.2 mm. Diameter of transparent sphere = 1.00 mm Thickness of thin glass plate = 0.2 mm Refractive index (u) of sphere = 1.62 Diameter of top aperture      = 0.9 mm Diameter of bottom aperture    = 0.8 mm.<br>
In  the  above mentioned process  very  high magnification  is possible without using any conventional objective and eye piece.<br>
If we assume both the side of view point surrounded by AIR<br>
13<br><br><br><br><br><br>
14<br><br><br>
It is thus possible by way of the present invention to provide for a miniature size micro microscope having high magnification capacity which would be light weight, portable and thus have extensive and wide application. In particular, the micro microscope of the invention can be used for various high magnification optical devices such as astronomical telescopes etc. Importantly, the micro microscope utilizes simple constructional gadgets which readily available making its provisions simple and cost effective. While the micro microscope of the invention is described with relation to non-limiting exemplary embodiments hereinbefore, the novel construction of the micro microscope can be of various other embodiments not specifically dealt with herein and all such variation and the scope of the invention should cover such variations within the ambit of the present disclosure of the micro microscope.<br>
