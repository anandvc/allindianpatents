				<td>INHIBITORS OF CRUZIPAIN AND OTHER CYSTEINE PROTEASES<br>
T<br>
HIS INVENTION relates to compounds which are inhibitors of the protease cruzipain, a gene product of the Tiypanosoma cruzi parasite. In particular, the invention provides compounds that are useful for the therapeutic treatment of Tiypanosoma cnizi infection, to the use of these compounds, and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising them. Furthermore, this invention relates to compounds which are inhibitors across a broad range of cysteine proteases, to the use of these compounds, and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising them. Such compounds are useful for the therapeutic treatment of diseases in which participation of a cysteine protease is implicated.<br>
The trypanosomal family of parasites have a substantial worldwide impact on human and animal healthcare (McKerrow, J. H., et al, Ann. Rev. Microbiol. 47, 821-853, 1993). One parasite of this family, Trypanosoma cruzi, is the causative agent of Chagas' disease, which affects in excess of twenty million people annually in Latin and South America, is the leading cause of heart disease in these regions and results in more than 45,000 deaths per annum (Centers for Disease Control and prevention website). In addition, with the increase in migration of the infected population from rural to urban sites and movements from South and Central America into North America, the infection is spreading via blood transfusions, and at birth. The present treatments of choice for Tiypanosoma cruzi infection, nifurtimox and benznidazole (an NADH fumarate reductase inhibitor, Turrens, JF, et al, Mol Biochem Parasitol, 82(1), 125-9, 1996) are at best moderately successful, achieving ~60% cure during the acute phase of infection (see Docampo, R. Curr. Pham. Design, 7, 1157-1164, 2001 for a general discussion) whilst not being prescribed at all during the chronic phase where cardiomyopathy associated heart failure often occurs (Kirchhoff, L. V. New Engl. J. Med., 329, 639-644,1993). Additionally, these two drugs have serious adverse toxic effects, requiring close medical, supervision during treatment, and have been shown to induce chromosomal damage in chagastic infants (Gorla, N. B. et al, Mutat. Res. 206, 217-220, 1988). Therefore, a strong medical need exists for new effective drugs for the chemo therapeutic treatment si Tiypanosoma cruzi infection.<br>
Classically, the identification of enzymes found to be crucial for the establishment or propagation of an infectious disease has been instrumental in the development of successful drugs such as antivirals (e.g. HIV aspartyl protease inhibitors) and anti-bacterials (e.g. pMactam antibiotics). The search for a similar Achilles heel in parasitic infections has examined numerous enzymes (e.g. parasitic dihydrofolate reductase, see Chowdhury, S. F. et al, J. Med. Chem., 42(21), 4300-4312, 1999; trypanothione reductase, see Li, Z. et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 11 (2), 251-254, 2001; parasitic glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, see Aranov, A. M. et al, J. Med. Chem., 41(24), 4790-4799, 1998). A particularly promising area of research has identified the role of cysteine proteases, encoded by the parasite, that play a pivotal role during the life cycle of the parasite (McKerrow, J. H., et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem., 7, 639-644, 1999). Proteases form a substantial group of biological molecules winch to date constitute approximately 2% of all the gene products identified following analysis of several genome sequencing programmes (e.g. see Southan, C. J. Pept. Sci, 6, 453-458, 2000). Proteases have evolved to participate in an enormous range of biological processes, mediating their effect by cleavage of peptide amide bonds within the myriad of proteins found hi nature. This hydrolytic action is performed by initially recognising, then binding to, particular three-dimensional electronic surfaces displayed by a protein, which aligns the bond for cleavage precisely within the protease.catalytic site. Catalytic hydrolysis then commences through nucleophilic attack of the amide bond to be cleaved either via an amino acid side-chain of the protease itself, or through the action of a water molecule that is bound to and activated by the protease. Proteases in which the attacking nucleophile is the thiol side-chain of a Cys residue are known as cysteine proteases. The general classification of 'cysteine protease' contains many members found across a wide range of organisms from viruses, bacteria, protozoa, plants and fungi to mammals.<br>
Biological investigation of Trypanosoma cruzi infection has highlighted a number of specific enzymes that are crucial for the progression of the parasite's life cycle. One such enzyme, cruzipain, a cathepsin L-like cysteine protease, is a clear therapeutic<br>
target for the treatment of Chagas' disease ((a) Cazzulo, J. J. et al, Cwr. Pharm. Des. 7, 1143-1156, 2001; (b) Caffrey, C. R. etal, Cwr. Drug Targets, 1, 155-162, 2000). Although the precise biological role of cruzipain within the parasite's life cycle remains unclear, elevated cruzipain messenger RNA levels in the epimastigote developmental stage indicate a role in the nutritional degradation of host-molecules in lysosomal-like vesicles (Engel, J. C. et al, J. Cell. Sci, 111, 597-606,1998). The validation of cruzipain as a viable therapeutic target has been achieved with increasing levels of complexity. Addition of a general cysteine protease inhibitor, Z-Phe-Ala-FMK to Tiypanosoma cmzz-infected mammalian cell cultures blocked replication and differentiation of the parasite, thus arresting the parasite life cycle (Harth, G., et al, Mol Biochem. Parasitol 58, 17-24, 1993). Administration of a vinyl sulphone-based inhibitor in a Tiypanosoma crwzz-infected murine animal model not only rescued the mice from lethal infections, but also produced a complete recovery (Engel, J. C. et al, J. Exp. Med, 188(4), 725-734,1998). Numerous other in vivo studies have confirmed that infections with alternative parasites such as Leishmania major (Selzer, P. M. et al, Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 96, 11015-11022,1999), Schistosoma mansoni and Plasmodiumfalciparium (Olson, J. E. et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem., 7, 633-638, 1999) can be halted or cured by treatment with cysteine protease inhibitors.<br>
A variety of synthetic approaches have been described towards the design of cruzipain inhibitors. However, although providing a biological 'proof-of-principle' for the treatment of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, current inhibitors exhibit a number of biochemical and physical properties that may preclude their clinical development (e.g. see (a) Brinen, L. S. et al, Structure, 8, 831-840, 2000, peptidomimetic vinyl sulphones, possible adverse mammalian cell toxicity (see McKerrow, J. H. and Engel, J. unpublished results cited in Scheldt, K. A. et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem, 6, 2477-2494, 1998); (b) Du, X. et al, Chem. Biol, 7, 733-742, 2000, aryl ureas, generally with low uM activity, and high ClogP values, thus poor aqueous solubility and probably low oral bioavailability; (c) Roush, W. R. et al, Tetrahedron, 56, 9747-9762, 2000, peptidyl epoxysuccinates, irreversible inhibitors, with potent activity verses house-keeping mammalian proteases such as cathepsin B; (d) Li, R. et al,<br>
Bioorg. Med. Chem. 4(9), 1421-1427, 1996, bisarylacylhydrazides and chalcones, polyhydroxylated aromatics; (e) US6143931, WO 9846559, non-peptide a-ketoamides). Of the many different approaches to enzyme inhibition to date, only the cruzipain protease inhibitors have proven effective in curing disease-related animal models of Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Therefore, a clear medical need exists to progress these 'proof-of-principle' findings towards clinical candidates, suitable for human use, through the discovery of more efficacious cruzipain inhibitors that have a desirable combination of potency, selectivity, low toxicity and optimised pharmacokinetic parameters.<br>
Cruzipain and indeed many other crucial parasitic proteases belong to the papain-like CA Cl family and have close structural mammalian homologues. Cysteine proteases are classified into 'clans' based upon a similarity in the three-dimensional structure or a conserved arrangement of catalytic residues within the protease primary sequence. Additionally, 'clans' are further classified into 'families' in which each protease shares a statistically significant relationship with other members when comparing the portions of amino acid sequence which constitute the parts responsible for the protease activity (see Barrett, AJ et al, in 'Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes', Eds. Barrett, A. J., Rawlings, N. D., and Woessner, J. F. Publ. Academic Press, 1998, for a thorough discussion). To date, cysteine proteases have been classified into five clans, CA, CB, CC, CD and CE (Barrett, A. J. et al, 1998). A protease from the tropical papaya fruit 'papain' forms the foundation of clan CA, which currently contains over 80 distinct and complete entries in various sequence databases, with many more expected from the current genome sequencing efforts. Proteases of clan CA/family Cl have been implicated in a multitude of disease processes e.g. human proteases such as cathepsin K (osteoporosis), cathepsin S (autoimmune disorders), cathepsin L (metastases) or parasitic proteases such as falcipain (malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum), cruzipain (Trypanosoma cruzi infection). Recently a bacterial protease, staphylopain (S. aureus infection) has also been tentatively assigned to clan CA. X-ray crystallographic structures are available for a range of the above mentioned proteases in complex with a range of inhibitors e.g. papain (PDB entries, Ipad, Ipe6, Ipip, Ipop, 4pad, 5pad, 6pad, Ippp, Ithe, Icsb,<br>
Ihuc), cathepsin K (lauO, Iau2, Iau3, Iau4, latk, Imem, Ibgo, layw, layu), cathepsin L (Ics8), cathepsin S (currently on-hold, but published McGrath, M. E. et al, Protein Science, 7, 1294-1302,1998), cruzain (a recombinant form of cruzipain see Eakin, A. E. et al, 268(9), 6115-6118, 1993) (lewp, laim, 2aim, 1F29, 1F2A, 1F2B, 1F2C), staphylopain (Icv8). Each of the structures displays a similar overall active-site topology, as would be expected by their 'clan' and 'family' classification and such structural similarity exemplifies one aspect of the difficulties involved in discovering a selective inhibitor of cruzipain suitable for human use. However, subtle differences in terms of the depth and intricate shape of the active site groove of each CA Cl protease are evident, which may be exploited for selective inhibitor design. Additionally, many of the current substrate-based inhibitor complexes of CA Cl family proteases show a series of conserved hydrogen bonds between the inhibitor and the protease backbone, which contribute significantly to inhibitor potency. Primarily a bidentate hydrogen-bond is observed between the protease Gly66 (C=O)/ inhibitor N-H and the protease Gly66(NH)/inhibitor (C=O), where the inhibitor (C=O) and (NH) are provided by an amino acid residue NHCHRCO that constitutes the S2 sub-site binding element within the inhibitor (see Berger, A. and Schecter, I. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. [Biol.J, 257.249-264,1970 for a description of protease binding site nomenclature). A further hydrogen-bond between the protease main-chain (C=O) of asparagine or aspartic acid (158 to 163, residue number varies between proteases) and an inhibitor (N-H) is often observed, where the inhibitor (N-H) is provided by the SI sub-site binding element within the inhibitor. Thus, the motif X-NHCHRCO-NH-Y is widely observed amongst the prior art substrate-based inhibitors of CA Cl proteases.<br>
In the prior art, the development of cysteine protease inhibitors for human use has recently been an area of intense activity. Considering the CA Cl family members, particular emphasis has been placed upon the development of inhibitors of human cathepsins, primarily cathepsin K (osteoporosis), cathepsin S (autoimmune disorders) and cathepsin L (metastases), through the use of peptide and peptidomimetic nitriles (e.g. see WO-A-0109910, WO-A-0051998, WO-A-0119816, WO-A-9924460, WO-A-0049008, WO-A-0048992, WO-A-0049007, WO-A-0130772, WO-A-0055125,<br>
WO-A-0055126, WO-A-0119808, WO-A-0149288, WO-A-0147886), linear and cyclic peptide and peptidomimetic ketones (e.g. see Veber, D. F. and Thompson, S. K., Cuir. Opin. Diiig Discovery Dev., 3(4), 362-369,2000, WO-A-0170232, WO-A-0178734, WO-A-0009653, WO-A-0069855, WO-A-0029408, WO-A-0134153 to WO-A-0134160,   WO-A-0029408,   WO-A-9964399,   WO-A-9805336,   WO-A-9850533),   ketoheterocycles   (e.g.   see  WO-A-0055144,   WO-A-0055124)   and monobactams (e.g. see WO-A-0059881, WO-A-9948911, WO-A-0109169). The prior art describes potent in vitro inhibitors, but also highlights the many difficulties in developing a human therapeutic. For example, WO-A-9850533 and WO-A-0029408 describe compounds that may be referred to as cyclic ketones and are inhibitors of cysteine proteases with a particular reference towards papain family proteases and as a most preferred embodiment, cathepsin K. WO-A-9850533 describes compounds subsequently detailed in the literature as potent inhibitors of cathepsin K with good oral bioavailability (Witherington, J., 'Tetrahydrofurans as Selective Cathepsin K Inhibitors', RSC meeting, Burlington House, London, 1999). The compounds of WO-A-9850533 were reported to bind to cathepsin K through the formation of a reversible covalent bond between the tetrahydrofuran carbonyl and the active site catalytic cysteine residue (Witherington, J., 1999). Additionally, the same cyclic ketone compounds are described in WO-A-9953039 as part of a wide-ranging description of inhibitors of cysteine proteases associated with parasitic diseases, with particular reference to the treatment of malaria by inhibition of falcipain. However, subsequent literature describes the cyclic ketone compounds of WO-A-9850533 to be unsuitable for further development or for full pharmacokinetic evaluation due to a physiochemical property of the inhibitors, the poor chiral stability of the ct-aminoketone chiral centre (Marquis, R. W. et al, J. Med. Chem., 44(5), 725-736, 2001). WO-A-0069855 describes compounds that may also be referred to as cyclic ketones with particular reference towards inhibition of cathepsin S. The compounds of WO-A-0069855 are considered to be an advance on compounds of WO-A-9850533 due to the presence of the p-substituent on the cyclic ketone ring system that provides chiral stability to the ct-carbon of the cyclic ketone ring system. However, the compounds of WO-A-0069855 and indeed those of WO-A-9850533 describe a requirement for the presence of the potential hydrogen-bonding motif X-<br>
KHCHRCQ-NH-Y that is widely observed amongst the prior art substrate-based inhibitors of CA Cl proteases.<br>
It has now been discovered that certain compounds, defined by general formulae (I)<br>
and (II), are potent and selective cruzipain protease inhibitors which are useful in the<br>
treatment of Trypanosoma cmzi infection. Other compounds defined by general<br>
formulae (I) and (II) are protease inhibitors across a broad range of CA Cl cysteine<br>
proteases and compounds useful in the treatment of diseases caused by cysteine<br>
proteases. Compounds described by general formulae (I) and (II) do not contain the<br>
X-NHCHRCO-NH-Y motif that is widely observed amongst the prior art substrate-<br>
based inhibitors of CA Cl proteases, yet surprisingly compounds defined by general<br>
formulae (I) and (II) retain good potency. The present invention provides substituted<br>

Considering all of the above examples, it is also intended to include the oxidised analogues of capping groups that contain a readily oxidised nitrogen to give the N-oxide or a readily oxidised sulphur to give the sulphone. The following structures are illustrative examples;To those skilled in the practices of organic chemistry, compounds of general formulae (I) and (II) may be readily synthesised by a number of chemical strategies, performed either in solution or on the solid phase (see Atherton, E. and Sheppard, R. C. In 'Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach', Oxford University Press, Oxford, U.K. 1989, for a general review of solid phase synthesis principles). The solid phase strategy is attractive in being able to generate many thousands of analogues, typically on a 5-100mg scale, through established parallel synthesis methodologies (e.g. see (a) Bastos, M.; Maeji, N. J.; Abeles, R. H. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 92,6738-6742,1995).<br>
Therefore, one strategy for the synthesis of compounds of general formulae (I) and (El) comprises:-<br>
(a)	Preparation of an appropriately functionalised and protected bi-cyclic ketone<br>
building block in solution.<br>
(b)	Attachment of the building block (a) to the solid phase through a linker that is<br>
stable to the conditions of synthesis, but readily labile to cleavage at the end of a<br>
synthesis (see James, I. W., Tetrahedron, 55(Report N9- 489), 4855-4946, 1999,<br>
for examples of the 'linker' function as applied to solid phase synthesis).<br>
(c)	Solid phase organic chemistry (see Brown, R. D. /. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans.1,<br>
19, 3293-3320,1998), to construct the remainder of the molecule.<br>
(d)	Compound cleavage from the solid phase into solution.<br>
(e)	Cleavage work-up and compound analysis.<br>
The first stage in a synthesis of compounds of general formulae (I) and (II) is the preparation in solution of a functionalised and protected building block. A typical scheme towards the tetrahydrofuro[3^-6]pyrrol-3-one (19) is detailed in Scheme 1. The following descriptions detailed in Schemes 1-13 could equally be applied using alternative scaffolds of general formulae (I) and (II).<br><br>
Scheme 1. (a) 'BuOCOCl, NMM, DCM, -15°C, lOmins, under argon, (b) Diazomethane in diethyl ether, -15°C to RT over Ihr. (c) Acetic acid (d) LiCl (lOeq) in 80%aq acetic acid, 5°C to RT over Ihr.<br>
FmOC(O) denotes the well known amine protecting group 9-fluorenyl methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc, see Atherton, E. and Sheppard, R. C., 1989) and Tg' denotes either a free hydroxyl or an hydroxyl protecting group such as tertJoutyl ether. In the illustrated case, condensation with diazomethane provides R1 = H. Although formation of the diazoketone is clearly observed at Ihr reaction, an overall improvement in isolated yield is obtained by leaving the reaction with ethereal diazomethane for 24hr.<br>
Considering step (a), synthesis may commence from suitably protected p-hydroxyproline (17) (or protected (3-hydroxypipecolic acid), which are accessible through a variety of literature methods e.g. (a) Heffher, R. J., et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 114, 10181-10189, 1992; (b) Hughes, P. Cardy, J., /. Org. Chem, 54, 3260-3264, 1989, (c) Hefmer, R. J, Jouille, M. M., Tet. Lett, 30, 7021-7024, 1989, (d) Ewing, W. R., Jouille, M. M., Heterocydes, 27, 2843-2850, 1988. (e) Kolodziej, S. A., Marshall, G. R., Int. J. Pept. Prot. Res., 48, 274-280, 1996, (f) Evans, D. A., Weber, A, E., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 109. 7151-7157, 1987, (g) Langlois, N., Rakotondradany, F., Tetmhedron, 56, 2437-2448, 2000, (h) Sugisaki, C. H., et al, Tet. Lett., 39, 3413-3416, 1998, (i) Greek, C., et al, Tet. Lett, 37, 2031-, 1996, (j) Agami, C., et al, Tet. Lett., 37, 4001 -, 1996.<br>
Activation of the suitably protected p-hydroxyproline (17) via isobutyl chloroformate mixed anhydride, followed by condensation with diazomethane, yields the diazomethylketone intermediates (18). Treatment of diazomethylketone intermediates (18) with lithium chloride in aqueous acetic acid provides the protected tetrahydroforo[3,2-6]pyrrol-3-one (19). Introduction of simple R1 substituents may be achieved by condensation of activated (17) with alternatives to diazomethane such as diazoethane (R1 = CHs), or 1-phenyloxydiazoethane (R1 =<br>
The protected building blocks (synthesis exemplified by the tetrahydrofuro[3,2-&amp;]-pyrrol-3-one (19)) detailed in Scheme 1 may be utilised in a solid phase synthesis of inhibitor molecules (steps (b) to (e)). Step (b), the solid phase linkage of an aldehyde or ketone, has previously been described by a variety of methods (e.g. see (a) James, I. W., 1999, (b) Lee, A., Huang, L., Ellman, J. A., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 121(43), 9907-9914, 1999, (c) Murphy, A. M., et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 114, 3156-3157, 1992). A suitable method amenable to the reversible linkage of an alkyl ketone functionality such as (19) is through a combination of the previously described chemistries. The semicarbazide, 4-[[(hydrazinocarbonyl)amino]methyl]cyclohexane carboxylic acid. trifluoroacetate (20) (Murphy, A. M., et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 114, 3156-3157,<br>
1992), may be utilised as illustrated in Scheme 2, exemplified by linkage of the tetrahydrofuro[3,2-6]pyrrol-3-one(19).<br><br>
Scheme 2. (a) (19) in 90% EtOH / H2O / 1.5eq NaOAc / 4-[[(hydrazinocarbonyl)amino]methyl]-cyclohexane carboxylic acid-trifluoroacetate (20), 2hr reflux, (b) 3eq construct (21) / 3eq HBTU / 3eq HOBt / 6eqNMM, NH2-SOUDD PHASE, DMF, RT, o/n. (c) 20% piperidine / DMF, 30mins. (d) Range of chemistries to introduce U-V-W-X-Y (e) TFA / H20 (95:5, v/v), RT, 2hr<br>
Construct (21) is prepared through reaction of the linker molecule (20) and the tetrahydrofuro[3,2-£]pyrrol-3-one (19) by reflux in aqueous ethanol / sodium acetate. Standard solid phase techniques (e.g. see Atherton, E. and Sheppard, R. C., 1989) are used to anchor the construct to an amino-functionalised solid phase through the free carboxylic acid functionality of (21), providing the loaded construct (22).<br>
Loaded construct (22) may be reacted with a wide range of carboxylic acids available commercially or in the literature, to introduce the left-hand portion 'U-V-W-X-Y' in general formula (I). In the simplest example, the entire left hand portion of an inhibitor of general formula (I) comprises a capped aminoacid (Scheme 3), providing for example analogues of general formula (I) where R12 = 'H', (X)0 = '-', (W)n = 'NH', R16 = 'H', n = 1, (V)m = 'CO', m = 1 and U = aryl<br>
40eq NMM, DMF, o/n (c) 5eq carboxylic acid / 5eq HBTU / 5eq HOBt / lOeq NMM, DMF, RT, o/n (d) TFA / H20 (95:5, v/v), RT, 2hr.<br>
Alternatively, carboxylic acids can be prepared in solution by traditional organic chemistry methods and coupled to construct (22) on the solid phase (Schemes 4-8). For example (Scheme 4), treatment in solution of an amino acid, exemplified by (24) with sodium nitrite / t^SCU, provides the a-hydroxyacid, exemplified by (25) (Degerbeck, F. et al, J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. J, 11-14,1993). Treatment of cc-hydroxyacid, (25) with sodium hydride in a dimethylformamide / dichloromethane mixture followed by addition of benzyl bromide, provides IRS-benzyloxy-S-cyclohexylpropionic acid (26). Coupling of (26) to the solid phase construct (22) followed by cleavage, provides (27), an example of general formula (I) where R12 -'H', (X)0 = '-', (W)n = 'O', n = 1, (V)m = 'CH2', i.e. R17, R18 = 'H', m * 1 and U =<br>
phenyl. To those skilled in the practices of organic synthesis, a wide variety of aminoacids such as (24) may be converted to the corresponding a-hydroxyacid such as (25) following the general conditions detailed. Additionally, benzylbromide may be replaced by any reasonable Ar-CR17R18-halide, providing many variations of carboxylic acid (26) following the general conditions detailed. In certain instances, it may be advantageous to temporarily protect the carboxylic acid as the methyl ester (for example compound (32), Scheme 6) prior to reaction with the alkylhalide. The ester intermediate is then simply hydrolysed to acid (26). Analogues of (27), exploring a wide range of (V)m and U in general formula (I) may be prepared through the general conditions detailed in Scheme 4. Since the final synthetic step involves a trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) mediated cleavage of the solid phase bound compound,<br>
analogues where the substituted ether is labile to TFA may be prepared in solution by an alternative route (see Scheme 11).<br><br>
Scheme 4. (a)NaNO2 / H2SO4,0°C-»RT, 2hr (b) 2.3eqNaH, 1:1 DMF /DCM, 1.4eqbenzylbromide, o/n (c) 20% piperidine / DMF, SOmins. (d) lOeq (26) / lOeq HBTU / lOeq HOBt / 20eq NMM, DMF, RT, o/n (e) TFA / H2O (95:5, v/v), RT, 2hr.<br>
Alternatively, coupling of construct (22) (following removal of Fmoc) with the ct-hydroxyacid (25), provides a versatile solid phase bound intermediate' Y' substituent in general formula (I) that may be reacted with many reagents. For example, the o&gt; hydroxyl can be reacted under Mitsunobu conditions (Hughes, D. L. Org. React.(N.Y), 42, 335-656, 1992) to give ethers (i.e. X = '-', W = 'O', in general formula (I)) (see Grabowska, U. et al, J. Comb. Chem., 2(5), 475-490, 2000, for an example of Mitsunobu reaction on the solid phase). Alternatively, the a-hydroxyl can be reacted with a carbamoyl chloride to give a carbamate (i.e. X = '-', W = *O', V = 'NHC(O)', in general formula (I)).<br>
Alternatively, (Scheme 5), treatment in solution of an ammo acid, exemplified by (24) with sodium nitrite / H2S04 / potassium bromide provides the a-bromoacid, exemplified by (28) (Souers, A. J. et al, Synthesis, 4, 583-585,1999) with retention of configuration. Treatment of a-bromoacid (28) with an alkylthiol exemplified by 4-^rt-butylphenylmethanethiol (29) in dimethylformamide / triemylamine, provides<br>
25r-(4-tert-butylbenzylsulfanyl)-4-methylpropionic acid (30), with inversion of configuration. Coupling of (30) to the solid phase construct (22) followed by cleavage, provides (31), an example of general formula (I) where R12 = 'H', (X)0 = '-', (W)n = 'S', n = 1, (V)m = 'CH2', i.e. R17, R18 = 'H', m = 1 and U = 4-tert-butylphenyl. To those skilled in the practices of organic synthesis, a wide variety of aminoacids such as (24) may be converted to the corresponding a-bromoacid such as (28) following the general conditions detailed. Additionally, starting with the S-isomer of (24) gives the S-bromoacid analogue of (28) and jR-thioether analogue of (30). Additionally, (4-ter/-butylphenyl)methanethiol (29) may be replaced by any reasonable Ar-CR17R18-SH, providing many variations of carboxylic acid (30) following the general conditions detailed. Thus analogues of (31) exploring a wide range of (V)m and U in general formula (I) may be prepared through the general conditions detailed in Scheme 5.<br><br>

Alternatively, coupling of construct (22) (following removal of Fmoc) with an a-bromoacid e.g. (28), provides a versatile intermediate 'Y' substituent hi general formula (I) that may be reacted with many reagents. For example, the a-bromide can be displaced with nucleophiles e.g. alcohols, thiols, carbanions etc, to give ethers (i.e. X = '-', W = 'O', in general formula (I)), thioethers (i.e. X = '-', W = 'S', in general<br>
formula (I)). The thioethers may optionally be oxidised to the sulphone (see Scheme 9, i.e. X = '-', W = 'SO2', in general formula (I)) (see Grabowska, U. et al, J. Comb. Chem., 2(5), 475-490, 2000, for an example of bromide displacement and tbioether oxidation on the solid phase).<br>
Alternatively, (Scheme 6), treatment of an a-hydroxyacid, exemplified by (25) with trimethylsilylchloride and methanol provides the methyl ester (32). Activation of the free hydroxyl to the chloroformate with phosgene in dichloromethane followed by addition of morpholine, then hydrolysis, provides morpholine-4-carboxylic acid-15-carboxy-2-cyclohexyl ethyl ester (33). Coupling of (33) to the solid phase construct (22) followed by cleavage, provides (34), an example of general formula (I) where R12 = 'H', (X)0 = '-', (W)n = 'O', n = 1, (V)m = 'CO' and U = morpholino. To those skilled in the practices of organic synthesis, a wide variety of a-hydroxyacid esters such as (32) could be converted to the activated chloroformate following the general conditions detailed. Additionally, morpholine may be replaced by any reasonable amine, providing many variations of carboxylic acid (33) following the general conditions detailed. Thus analogues of (34) exploring a wide range of (V)m and U in general formula (I) may be prepared through the general conditions detailed in Scheme 6.<br>
Altematively, (Scheme 7), a wide range of alkylsuccinate esters exemplified by 2R-cydohexylmethylsuccinic acid 1-methyl ester (35) are commercially available or readily prepared by known methods (see (a) Azam et al, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1, 621-, 1996; (b) Evans et al, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1, 103, 2127, 1981; (c) Oikawa et al, Tet. Lett, 37, 6169,1996). Carboxyl activation of alkylsuccinate ester<br>
(35)	followed by addition of morpholine in dimethylformamide and subsequent ester<br>
hydroylsis, provides 2/?-cyclohexylmethyl-4-morpholin-4-yl-4-oxo-butyric acid (36).<br>
Coupling of (36) to the solid phase construct (22) followed by cleavage, provides<br>
(37), an example of general formula (I) where R12 = 'H', (X)0 = 'CH2' i.e. R14, R15 =<br>
'H', o=l, (W)n = 'CO', n = 1, (V)m = '-' and U = morpholino. To those skilled in<br>
the practices of organic synthesis, a wide variety of alkylsuccinate esters such as (35)<br>
may be prepared and converted to the corresponding substituted alkylsuccinate acid<br>
such as (36) following the general conditions detailed. Additionally, morpholine may<br>
be replaced by any reasonable amine, providing many variations of carboxylic acid<br>
(36)	following the general conditions detailed. Thus analogues of (37) exploring a<br>
wide range of (X)0, (V)m and U in general formula (I) may be prepared through the<br>
general co<br>

Alternatively, (Scheme 8), a wide range of biarylalkylacetic acids, exemplified by 2&amp;S-biphenyl-3-yl-4-methylpentanoic acid (39) are readily available by known methods (see (a) DesJarlais, R. L. et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 120. 9114-9115,1998; (b) Oballa, R. M. et al, WO 0149288). Coupling of biarylalkylacetic acid (39) to the solid phase construct (22) followed by cleavage, provides (40), an example of general formula (I) where R12 = 'H', (X)0 = '-', (W)n = '-', (V)m = '-' and U = m-biphenyl. To those skilled in the practices of organic synthesis, a wide variety of biarylalkylacetic acids such as (39) may be prepared by alkylation of the a-anion of the free acid analogue of (38), which in turn is prepared by Suzuki coupling of phenylboronic acid and 3-bromophenylacetic acid methyl ester. Phenylboronic acid may be replaced by a wide range of arylboronic acids in the Suzuki coupling, providing many variations of carboxylic acid (39) following the general conditions detailed. Thus analogues of (40) exploring a wide range of group 'U' in general formula (I) may be prepared through the general conditions detailed in Scheme 8.<br>
Scheme 8. (a) LiOH in H2O / dioxan, 0°C (b) LLDA, THF, 2-methylpropenylbromide. ii. Pd/C, EtOH, H2 (c) 20% piperidine / DMF, 30mins. (d) lOeq (39) / lOeq HBTU / lOeq HOBt / 20eq NMM, DMF, RT, o/n (e) TFA / H2O (95:5, v/v), RT, 2hr.<br>
Many other possibilities for solid phase organic chemistry (e.g. see Brown, R. D. J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. 1, 19, 3293-3320, 1998, for a review of recent SPOC publications) can be used to derivatise construct (22) towards compounds of general formula (I) (and similarly, through the appropriate loaded derivative, compounds of general formula (II)). For example, the left-hand portion 'U-V-W-X-Y1 in general formulae (I) can be partially constructed in solution, coupled to construct (22) and further modified on the solid phase. For example (Scheme 9), a simple extension of Scheme 5 is through the oxidation of the intermediate solid phase bound species, with m-chloroperbenzoic acid in dichloromethane prior to cleavage, to give the sulphone analogue (42). Commencing from a variation of carboxylic acid (30), 3-cyclohexyl-25-(furan-2-ylmethylsulfanyl)propionic acid (41), sulphone (42) is prepared, an example of general formula (I) where R12 = 'H', (X)0 = '-', (W)n = 'S02', n = 1, (V)m = 'CH2', i.e. R17, R18 = 'H', m = 1 and U = 2-furanyL As described in Scheme 5, many variations of carboxylic acid (30) may be prepared following the general conditions detailed e.g. (41). Thus analogues of (42) exploring a wide range of (V)m and U in general formula (I) may be prepared through the general conditions detailed in Schemes 5 and 9.<br>
Compounds of general formulae (I) and (II) are finally released from the solid phase by treatment with trifhioroacetic acid / water, followed by evaporation, lyophylis and standard analytical characterisation.<br>
A second strategy for the synthesis of compounds of general formulae (I) and (II) comprises:-<br>
(a)	Preparation     of    an     appropriately     functionalised     and     protected<br>
tetrahydrofuro[3,2-6]pyrrol-3-one,	tetrahydrothieno[3,2-£]pyrrol-3-one,<br>
hexahydropyrrolo[3,2-6] pyrrol-3-one, hexahydrocyclopenta[fc]pyrrol-6-one,<br>
tetrahydrofuro[3,2-c]pyrazol-6-one,      tetrahydrothienop^-cjpyrazol-e-one,<br>
hexahydropyrrolo[3,2-c]pyrazol-6-one,    hexahydrocyclopentapyrazol-6-one,<br>
hexahydrofuro[3,2-fc]pyridin-3-one,      hexahydrothieno[3,2-&amp;]pyridin-3-one,<br>
octahydropyrrolo[3,2-6] pyridin-3-one, octahydrocyclopenta[6]pyridin-7-one,<br>
hexahydrofuro[3,2-c]pyridazin-7-one,      hexahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridazm-7-<br>
one,                       octahydropyrrolo[3,2-c]pyridazin-7-one	or<br>
octahydrocyclopenta[c]pyrida2in-7-one building block in solution.<br>
Preferred protecting groups for solution phase chemistry are the Na-terf-<br>
butoxycarbonyl group and the Na-benzyloxycarbonyl group.<br>
(b)	Standard organic chemistry methods for the conversion of building block (a)<br>
towards compounds of general formulae (I) and (II).<br>
In the simplest example, the entire left hand portion of an inhibitor of general formulae (I) and (II) can be prepared in solution by traditional organic chemistry methods and coupled to building block (a) (see Scheme 10 exemplified by preparation and use of the 3-oxo-hexahydrofuro[3,2-6]pyrrole-4-carboxyUc acid tert-butyl ester (45)).<br>
cheme 10. (a) 'BuOCOCl, NMM, DCM, -15°C, lOmins, under argon, (b) Diazomethane in diethyl ether, -15°C to RT over 24hr. (c) Acetic acid (d) Lid (lOeq) in 80%aq acetic acid, 5°C to RT over Ihr. (e) 4M HCI in dioxan, 0°C, 2hrs. (f) Pre-prepared U-V-W-X-Y-COOH / activation e.g. HATU / HOAt / NMM, DMF, RT, o/n.<br>
The general strategy detailed in Scheme 10 is particularly useful when the compound of general formula (I) contains a substituent that is labile to trifluoroacetic acid, this being the final reagent used in each of the solid phase Schemes 4-9. For example (Scheme 11), treatment in solution of a-hydroxyacid (47) with sodium hydride in a dimethylformamide / dichloromethane mixture followed by addition of 4-tert-butylbenzyl bromide, provides 2J?5'-(4-rer?-butylbenzyloxy)-4-methylpentanoic acid (48). Coupling of (48) to hydrochloride salt (46), provides (49), an example of general formula (I) where R12 = 'H', (X)0 = '-', (W)n = 'O', n = 1, (V)m = 'CH2', i.e. R17, R18 = 'H', m = 1 and U = 4-tert-butylphenyl. To those skilled in the practices of organic synthesis, 4-tert-butylbenzyl bromide may be replaced by any reasonable Ar-CR17R18-halide, providing many variations of carboxylic acid (48) under the conditions shown. Thus analogues of (49) exploring a wide range of (V)m and U in general formula (I) may be prepared through the conditions detailed in Scheme 11.<br>

A third strategy for the synthesis of compounds of general formulae (I) and (II) where the addition of U-V-W-X-Y to the protected building block involves multistep organic reactions comprises:-<br>
(a)	Preparation     of    an     appropriately     functionalised     and    protected<br>
tetrahydrofuro[3,2-&amp;]pyrrol-3-one,	tetrahydrothieno[3,2-fe]pyrrol-3-one,<br>
hexahydropyrrolo[3,2-6]pyrrol-3-one,   hexahydrocyclopenta[&amp;]pyrrol-6-one,<br>
tetrahydrofuro[3,2-c]pyrazol-6-one,      tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyrazol-6-one,<br>
hexahyd^opyrrolo[332Tc]pyrazol-6-one,    hexahydrocyclopentapyrazol-6-one,<br>
hexahydrofuro[3,2-i]pyridin-3-one,      hexahydrothieno[3,2-&amp;]pyridin-3-one,<br>
octahydropyrrolo[3,2-i] pyridin-3-one, octahydrocyclopenta[i]pyridin-7-one,<br>
hexahydrofuro[3j2-c]pyridazin-7-one.,      hexahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridazin-7-<br>
one,    octahydropyrroloCS^-clpyridazin^-one    or    octahydrocyclopenta[c]<br>
pyridazin-7-one building block in solution.<br>
Preferred  protecting groups for solution phase chemistry are the Na,-tert-butoxycarbonyl     group     and     the     Na-benzyloxycarbonyl     group.<br>
(b)	Protection of the ketone functionality of the tetrahydrofuro[3,2-6]pyrrol-3-<br>
one, tetrahydrothieno[3,2-6]pyrrol-3-one, hexahydropyrrolo[332-6]pyrrol-3-<br>

one, tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyrazol-6-one, hexahydropyrrolo[3,2-c]pyrazol-6-one, hexahydrocyclopentapyrazol-6-one, hexahydrofuro[3,2-&amp;]pyridin-3-one, hexahydrothieno[3,2-&amp;]pyridin-3-one, octahydropyrrolo[3,2-&amp;]pyridin-3-one, octahydrocyclopenta[6]pyridin-7-one, hexahydrofuro[3,2-c]pyridazin-7-one, hexaliydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridazin-7-one, octahydropyrrolo[3,2-c]pyridazin-7-one or octahydrocyclopenta[c]pyridazin-7-one building block e.g. as a dimethylacetal. Alternatively, the ketone may be reduced to the achiral secondary alcohols and re-oxidised as the final synthetic step.<br>
(c)	Standard organic chemistry methods for the conversion of building block (b)<br>
towards compounds of general formulae (I) and (II).<br>
(d)	Intermediates may be prepared in solution, followed by coupling to building<br>
block (b) and further derivitisation towards compounds of general formulae<br>
(I) and (II) (see Scheme 12 exemplified by preparation and use of the 3-<br>
hydroxyhexahydrofuro[3,2-6]pyrrole-4-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester (50)).<br>
Alternatively, depending upon the types of chemistry used to construct the left hand side U-V-W-X-Y of compounds of general formula (I) and (II), the ketone may require protection e.g. as the dimethyl acetal. Such a method is detailed and exemplified in Scheme 13 by the preparation and use of 3,3-dimethoxyhexahydrofur<br>

The invention extends to novel intermediates as described above, and to processes for preparing compounds of general formulae (I) or (II) from each of their immediate precursors. In turn, processes for preparing intermediates from their immediate precursors also form part of the invention.<br>
Compounds of general formulae (I) and (II) are useful both as laboratory tools and as<br>
^<br>
therapeutic agents. In the laboratory certain compounds of the invention are useful in establishing whether a known or newly discovered cysteine protease contributes a critical or at least significant biochemical function during the establishment or progression of a disease state, a process commonly referred to as 'target validation' .<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of validating a known or putative cysteine protease inhibitor as a therapeutic target, the method comprising:<br>
(a)	assessing the in vitro binding of a compound as described above to an isolated<br>
known or putative cysteine protease, providing a measure of potency; and optionally,<br>
one or more of the steps of:<br>
(b)	assessing the binding of the compound to closely related homologous proteases<br>
of the target and general house-keeping proteases (e.g. trypsin) to provides a measure<br>
of selectivity;<br>
(c)	monitoring a cell-based functional marker of a particular cysteine protease<br>
activity, in the presence of the compound; and<br>
(d)	monitoring an animal model-based functional marker of a particular cysteine<br>
protease activity in the presence of the compound.<br>
The invention therefore provides a method of validating a known or putative cysteine protease inhibitor as a therapeutic target. Differing approaches and levels of complexity are appropriate to the effective inhibition and 'validation' of a particular target. In the first instance, the method comprises assessing the in viti'o binding of a compound of general formulae (I) or (II) to an isolated known or putative cysteine protease, providing a measure of 'potency'. An additional assessment of the binding of a compound of general formulae (I) or (IT) to closely related homologous proteases of the target and general house-keeping proteases (e.g. trypsin) provides a measure of 'selectivity'. A second level of complexity may be assessed by monitoring a cell-based functional marker of a particular cysteine protease activity, in the presence of a compound of general formulae (I) or (II). For example, a 'human osteoclast resorption assay' has been utilised as a cell-based secondary in vifro testing system for monitoring the activity of cathepsin K and the biochemical effect of protease inhibitors (e.g. see WO-A-9850533). An 'MHC-II processing - T-cell<br><br>
-119-<br>
activation assay' has been utilised as a cell-based secondary in vitro testing system for monitoring the activity of cathepsin S and the biochemical effect of protease inhibitors (Shi, G-P., et at, Immunity, 10, 197-206,1999). When investigating viral or bacterial infections such a marker could simply be a functional assessment of viral (e.g. count of mRNA copies) or bacterial loading and assessing the biochemical effect of protease inhibitors. A third level of complexity may be assessed by monitoring an animal model-based functional marker of a particular cysteine protease activity, in the presence of a compound of general formulae (I) or (II). For example, murine models of Leishmania infection, P. vinckei infection, malaria (inhibition of falcipain) and T. cnizi infection (cruzipain), indicate that inhibition of cysteine proteases that play a key role in pathogen propagation is effective in arresting disease symptoms, 'validating' said targets.<br>
The invention therefore extends to the use of a compound of general formulae (I) or (H) in the validation of a known or putative cysteine protease inhibitor as a therapeutic target.<br>
Compounds of general formulae (I) and (II) are useful for the in vivo treatment or prevention of diseases in which participation of a cysteine protease is implicated.<br>
According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a compound of general formulae (I) or (II) for use in medicine, especially for preventing or treating diseases in which the disease pathology may be modified by inhibiting a cysteine protease.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the invention, there is provided the use of a compound of general formulae (I) or (II) in the preparation of a medicament for preventing or treating diseases in which the disease pathology may be modified by inhibiting a cysteine protease.<br>
Certain cysteine proteases function in the normal physiological process of protein degradation in animals, including humans, e.g. in the degradation of connective tissue. However, elevated levels of these eirzymes in the body can result in<br><br>
jathological conditions leading to disease. Thus, cysteine proteases have been mplicated in various disease states, including but not limited to, infections by °neumocystis carinii, Trypsanoma cruzi, Trypsanoma brucei brucei and Criihidia <usiculata as well in osteoporosis autoimmunity schistosomiasis malaria rumour metastasis metachromatic leukodystrophy muscular dystrophy amytrophy and the like. see wo-a-9404172 ep-a-0603873 references cited both of them. additionally a secreted bacterial cysteine protease from s. aureus called staphylopain has been implicated virulence factor j. et al. biol. chem></usiculata>
The invention is useful in the prevention and/or treatment of each of the disease states mentioned or implied above. The present invention also is useful in a methods of treatment or prevention of diseases caused by pathological levels of cysteine proteases, particularly cysteine proteases of the papain superfamily, which methods comprise administering to an animal, particularly a mammal, most particularly a human, in need thereof a compound of the present invention. The present invention particularly provides methods for treating diseases in which cysteine proteases are implicated, including infections by Pneumocystis carinii, Trypsanoma cntzi, Trypsanoma brucei, Leishmania mexicana, Clostridium histofyticum, Staphylococcus aureus, foot-and-mouth disease virus and Criihidia fusiculata; as well as in osteoporosis, autoimmunity, schistosomiasis, malaria, tumour metastasis, metachromatic leukodystrophy, muscular dystrophy and amytrophy.<br>
Inhibitors of cruzipain, particularly cruzipain-specific compounds, are useful for the treatment of Chagas' disease.<br>
In accordance with this invention, an effective amount of a compound of general formulae (I) or (H) may be administered to inhibit the protease implicated with a particular condition or disease. Of course, this dosage amount will further be modified according to the type of administration of the compound. For example, to achieve an "effective amount" for acute therapy, parenteral administration of a compound of general formulae (I) or (II) is preferred. An intravenous infusion of the<br><br>
compound in 5% dextrose in water or normal saline, or a similar formulation with suitable excipients, is most effective, although an intramuscular bolus injection is also useful. Typically, the parenteral dose will be about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg; preferably between 0.1 and 20 mg/kg, in a manner to maintain the concentration of drug in the plasma at a concentration effective to inhibit a cysteine protease. The compounds may be administered one to four times daily at a level to achieve a total daily dose of about 0.4 to about 400 mg/kg/day. The precise amount of an inventive -compound which is therapeutically effective, and the route by which such compound is best administered, is readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art by comparing the blood level of the agent to the concentration required to have a therapeutic effect. Prodrugs of compounds of the present invention may be prepared by any suitable method. For those compounds in which the prodrug moiety is. a .ketone functionality, specifically ketals and/or hemiacetals, the conversion may be effected in accordance with conventional methods.<br>
The compounds of this invention may also be administered orally to the patient, in a manner such that the concentration of drug is sufficient to inhibit bone resorption or to achieve any other therapeutic indication as disclosed herein. Typically, a pharmaceutical composition containing the compound is administered at an oral dose of between about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg in a manner consistent with the condition of the patient. Preferably the oral dose would be about 0.5 to about 20 mg/kg.<br>
No unacceptable toxicological effects are expected when compounds of the present invention are administered in accordance with the present invention. The compounds of this invention, which may have good bioavailability, may be tested in one of several biological assays to determine the concentration of a compound which is required to have a given pharmacological effect.<br>
According to a fifth aspect of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition comprising one or more compounds of general formulae (I) or (II) and a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier. Other active<br>
materials may also be present, as may be considered appropriate or advisable for the disease or condition being treated or prevented.<br>
The carrier, or, if more than one be present, each of the carriers, must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient.<br>
The formulations include those suitable for rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal) administration, but preferably the formulation is an orally administered formulation. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form, e.g. tablets and sustained release capsules, and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy.<br>
Such methods include the step of bringing into association the above defined active agent with the carrier. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active agent with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product. The invention extends to methods for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising bringing a compound of general formulae (I) or (II) in conjunction or association with a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier or vehicle.<br>
Formulations for oral administration in the present invention may be presented as: discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active agent; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension of the active agent in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion; or as a bolus etc.<br>
For compositions for oral administration (e.g. tablets and capsules), the term "acceptable carrier" includes vehicles such as common excipients e.g. binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, polyvinylpyrrolidone (Povidone), methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sucrose and starch; fillers and carriers, for example<br>
com starch, gelatin, lactose, sucrose, microcrystalline cellulose, kaolin, mannitol, dicalcium phosphate, sodium chloride and alginic acid; and lubricants such as magnesium stearate, sodium stearate and other metallic stearates, glycerol stearate stearic acid, silicone fluid, talc waxes, oils and colloidal silica. Flavouring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, cherry flavouring and the like can also be used. It may be desirable to add a colouring agent to make the dosage form readily identifiable. Tablets may also be coated by methods well known in the art. A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active agent in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface-active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may be optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active agent.<br>
Other formulations suitable for oral administration include lozenges comprising the active agent hi a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active agent in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active agent in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>
Parenteral formulations will generally be sterile.<br>
According to a sixth aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition as described above, the process comprising bringing the active compound(s) into association with the carrier, for example by admixture.<br>
Preferred features for each aspect of the invention are as for each other aspect mutatis mutandis.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated with the following examples:<br>
Solution Phase Chemistry - General Methods<br>
All solvents were purchased from ROMIL Ltd (Waterbeach, Cambridge, UK) at SpS or Hi-Dry grade unless otherwise stated. General peptide synthesis reagents were obtained from Chem-Impex Intl. Inc. (Wood Dale IL 60191. USA). Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on pre-coated plates (Merck aluminium sheets silica 60 F254, part no. 5554). Visualisation of compounds was achieved under ultraviolet light (254nm) or by using an appropriate staining reagent. Flash column purification was performed on silica gel 60 (Merck 9385). All analytical HPLC were obtained on Phenomenex Jupiter C4, 5ji, 300A, 250 x 4.6mm, using mixtures of solvent A = 0.1 %aq trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and solvent B = 90% acetonitrile /10% solvent A on automated Agilent systems with 215 and / or 254nm UV detection. Unless otherwise stated a gradient of 10 - 90% B in A over 25 minutes at 1.5mL / min was performed for full analytical HPLC analysis. HPLC-MS analysis was performed on an Agilent 1100 series LC/MSD, using automated Agilent HPLC systems, with a gradient of 10 - 90% B in A over 10 minutes on Phenomenex Columbus Cg, 5|i, 300A, 50 x 2.0mm at 0.4mL / min. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were obtained on a Bruker DPX400 (400MHz 1H frequency; QXI probe) in the solvents and temperature indicated. Chemical shifts are expressed in parts per million (5) and are referenced to residual signals of the solvent. Coupling constants (J) are expressed in Hz.<br>
Solid Phase Chemistry - General Methods<br>
Example inhibitors (1-156) were prepared through a combination of solution and solid phase Fmoc-based chemistries (see 'Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis', Atherton, E. and Sheppard, R. C., IRL Press Ltd, Oxford, UK, 1989, for a general description). An appropriately protected and functionalised building block was prepared in solution (e.g. general compound (19), Scheme 1), then reversibly attached to the solid phase through an appropriate linker. Rounds of coupling / deprotection / chemical modification e.g. oxidation were then performed until the full length<br>
desired molecule was complete (Scheme 2). Example inhibitors (1-156) were then released (cleaved) from the solid phase, analysed, purified and assayed for inhibition verses a range of proteases.<br>
Generally, multipins (polyamide 1.2 -&gt; lOjimole loadings, see www.mimotopes.com) were used for the solid phase synthesis, although any suitable solid phase surface could be chosen. In general, the 1.2|imole gears were used to provide small scale crude examples for preliminary screening, whilst the 10 ^mole crowns were used for scale-up synthesis and purification of preferred examples. Standard coupling and Fmoc deprotection methods were employed (see Grabowska, U. et al, J. Comb. Chem. 2(5), 475-490, 2000. for a thorough description of solid phase multipin methodologies).<br>
Preparation of Initial Assembly<br>
Building Block-linker constructs (e.g.(21), typically lOOmg to 2g) were carboxyl activated with 2-(lH-benzotriazole-l-yl)-l,l,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluoro phosphate (HBTU, 1 mole equivalent), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole.hydrate (HOST, 1 mole equivalent) and N-methyhnorpholine (NMM, 2 mole equivalents) in dimethylformamide (DMF, typically 1 to lOmL) for 5 minutes. Ammo functionalised DA/MDA crowns or HEMA gears (lOjjmole per crown / 1.2umole per gear, 0.33 mole equivalent of total surface amino functionalisation compared to activated construct) were added, followed by additional DMF to cover the solid phase surface. The loading reaction was left overnight. Following overnight loading, crowns / gears were taken through standard cycles washing, Fmoc deprotection and loading quantification (see Grabowska, U. et al) to provide loaded Building Block-linker constructs (e.g.(22)). Analysis indicated virtually quantitative loading in all examples.<br>
Coupling Cycles<br>
The coupling of standard Fmoc-aminoacids (10 or 20 mole equivalent) were performed via carboxyl activated with 2-(lH4&gt;enzotriazole-l-yl)-l,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluoro phosphate (HBTU, 10 or 20mole equivalent), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole.hydrate (HOBT, 10 or 20mole equivalent) and N-methylmorpholine (NMM, 20 or 40mole equivalents) in dimethylformamide, with pre-activation for 5 minutes. Activated species were dispensed to the appropriate wells of a polypropylene 96-well plate (Beckman, ImL wells, 500}iL solution per well for crowns or 250fj,L solution per well for gears) in a pattern required for synthesis. Loaded free arnino Building Block-linker constructs (e.g.(22)) were added and the coupling reaction left overnight. Following overnight coupling, crowns / gears were taken through standard cycles washing and Fmoc deprotection (see Grabowska, U. et al). Identical activation and coupling conditions were used for the coupling of a range of carboxylic acids (R-COOH). Alternatively, chloroformates e.g. morpholine-4-carbonylchloride (lOmole equivalent), were coupled in DMF with the addition of NMM (lOmole equivalents).<br>
Acidolytic Cleavage Cycle<br>
A mixture of 95% TFA / 5% water was pre-dispensed into two polystyrene 96-well plates (Beckman, ImL wells, 600uL solution per well for crowns or 300uL solution per well for gears) in a pattern corresponding to that of the synthesis. The completed multipin assembly was added to the first plate (mother plate), the block covered in tin foil and cleaved for 2 hours. The cleaved multipin assembly was then removed from the first plate and added to the second plate (washing plate) for 15 minutes. The spent multipin assembly was then discarded and the mother / washing plates evaporated on an HT-4 GeneVac plate evaporator.<br>
Analysis and Purification of Cleaved Examples<br>
(a) Ex 1.2umole Gears. lOOuL dirnethylsulphoxide (DMSO) was added to each post cleaved and dried washing plate well, thoroughly mixed, transferred to the corresponding post cleaved and dried mother plate well and again thoroughly<br>
mixed. lOuL of this DMSO solution was diluted to lOOuL with a 90% acetonitrile /10% 0.1 %aq TFA mixture. 20uL aliquots were analysed by HPLC-MS and full analytical HPLC. In each case the crude example molecules gave the expected [M + H]+ ion and an HPLC peak at &gt; 80% (by 215nm UV analysis). This provided an approximately lOmM DMSO stock solution of good quality crude examples for preliminary protease inhibitory screening.<br>
(b)	Ex lOfimole Crowns. SOOuL of a 90% acetonitrile / 10% 0.1 %aq TFA mixture<br>
was added to each washing plate well, thoroughly mixed, transferred to the<br>
corresponding mother plate well and again thoroughly mixed. 5uL of this<br>
solution was diluted to lOOuL with a 90% acetonitrile / 10% 0.1%aq TFA<br>
mixture. 20uL aliquots were analysed by HPLC-MS and full analytical HPLC. In<br>
each case the crude example molecules gave the expected [M + H]+ ion and an<br>
HPLC peak at &gt; 80% (by 215nm UV analysis). The polystyrene blocks<br>
containing crude examples were then lyophilised.<br>
(c)	Individual examples (ex (b)) were re-dissolved in a 1 :1 mixture of 0.1% aq TFA<br>
/ acetonitrile (ImL) and purified by semi-preparative HPLC (Phenomenex Jupiter<br>
C4, 5\i, 300A, 250 x 10mm, a 25-90% B in A gradient over 25mins, 4.0mL/min,<br>
215nm UV detection). Fractions were lyophilised into pre-tarred glass sample<br>
vials to provide purified examples (typically 2 to 4mg, 40 to 80% yield).<br>
(d)	Purified examples were dissolved hi an appropriate volume of DMSO to provide<br>
a lOmM stock solution, for accurate protease inhibitory screening.<br>

Following the general details from Scheme 1, the required bicycle building block (3a5,6aZ?) 3-oxo-hexahydrofuro[3,2-6]pyrrole~4-carboxylic acid 9J?-fluoren-9-yl methyl ester (19) was prepared in 8 steps as follows.<br>

Trans-3-hydroxy-L-proline (10.Og, 76.3mmole) was added to a vigorously stirred, ice-cooled solution of sodium carbonate (16.90g, 160.2mmole) in water (lOOmL). 1,4-Dioxan (75mL) was added providing an opaque but mobile mixture. 9-Fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (20.3 Ig, SOmmole) in 1,4-dioxan (75mL) was added over Ihr, then the ice-cooling removed and the mixture stirred at RT for an additional 2hr. Additional water (300mL) was added, the reaction mixture washed with chloroform (2 x 250mL) and the combined organic layers discarded. The aqueous phase was acidified with IN HC1 to ~ pH 2, providing a thick opaque mixture. The acidified aqueous mixture was extracted with chloroform (2 x SOOmL) and the now clear aqueous phase discarded. The opaque combined chloroform layers were dried (Na2SC&gt;4), filtered and reduced in vacuo to provide batch 1 (5.70g). The residual precipitate (a mixture of product and drying agent) was triturated with hot methanol (2 x 250mL) and the combined methanol solutions reduced in vacuo to provide batch 2 (10.25g). Batch 1 and 2 were individually analysed by TLC (single UV spot, Rf = 0.15, 20% MeOH in CHC13), and HPLC-MS (single main UV peak with Rt = 7.069mins, 354.2 [M + H]+, 376.2 [M + Na]+) and found to be identical, giving a combined yield of 15.95g (45.2mmole, 59.2%).

Triphenylphosphine (2.76g, 10.5mmole, TPP) was dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran (75mL), under a nitrogen blanket with stirring and ice-cooled. Diisopropylazodicarboxylate (2.12g, 2.07mL, lO.Smmole, DIAD) was added dropwise over ISmins to give a precipitous white mixture.

EXAMPLE A. Assays for Cysteine Protease Activity<br>
The compounds of this invention may be tested in one of a number of literature based biochemical assays that are designed to elucidate the characteristics of compound inhibition. The data from these types of assays enables compound potency and the rates of reaction to be measured and quantified. This information, either alone or in combination with other information, would allow the amount of compound required to produce a given pharmacological effect to be determined.<br>
General materials and methods<br>
Unless otherwise stated, all general chemicals and biochemicals were purchased from either the Sigma Chemical Company, Poole, Dorset, U.K. or from Fisher Scientific UK, Loughborough, Leicestershire, U.K. Absorbance assays were carried out in flat-bottomed 96-well plates (Spectra; Greiner Bio-One Ltd., Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, U.K.) using a SpectraMax PLUS384 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Crawley, U.K.). Fluorescence high throughput assays were carried out in either 384-well microtitre plates (Corning Costar 3705 plates, Fisher Scientific) or 96-well CU' bottomed Microfluor Wl microtitre plates (Thermo Labsystems, Ashford, Middlesex, U.K.). Fluorescence assays were monitored using a SpectraMax Gemini fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices). For substrates employing either a 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) or a 7-amino-4-nifluoromethylcoumarin (AFC) fluorophore, assays were monitored at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and an emission wavelength of 450 nm and the fluorescence plate reader calibrated with AMC. For substrates employing a 3-amino-benzoyl (Abz) fluorophore, assays were monitored at an excitation wavelength of 310 nm and an emission wavelength of 445 nm; the fluorescence plate reader calibrated with 3-amino-benzamide (Fluka). Unless otherwise indicated, all the peptidase substrates<br>
were purchased from Bachem UK, St. Helens, Merseyside, UK. Substrates utilizing fluorescence resonance energy transfer methodology (i.e. FRET-based substrates) were synthesized at Incenta Limited using published methods (Atherton &amp; Sheppard, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, IRL Press, Oxford, U.K., 1989) and employed Abz (2-aminobenzoyl) as the fluorescence donor and 3-nitro-tyrosine [TyrCNOa)] as the fluorescence quencher (Meldal, M. and Breddam, K.,Anal. Biochem., 195,141-147, 1991). Hydroxyethylpiperazine ethanesulfonate (HEPES), tris-hydroxylro ethyl aminomethane (tris) base, bis-tris-propane and all the biological detergents (e.g. CHAPS, zwittergents, etc.) were purchased from CN Biosciences UK, Beeston, Nottinghamshire, U.K. Glycerol was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, U.K. Stock solutions of substrate or inhibitor were made up to 10 mM in 100 % dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (Rathburns, Glasgow, U.K.) and diluted as appropriately required. In all cases the DMSO concentration in the assays was maintained at less than 1% (vol./vol.).<br>
Assay protocols were based on literature precedent (Tablel; Barrett, A.J., Rawlings, N.D. and Woessner, J.F., 1998, Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes, Academic Press, London and references therein) and modified as required to suit local assay protocols. Enzyme was added as required to initiate the reaction and the activity, as judged by the change in fluorescence upon conversion of substrate to product, was monitored over time. All assays were carried out at 25±1°C.<br>

The rate of conversion of substrate to product was derived from the slope of the increase La fluorescence monitored continuously over time.<br>
Measurement of the apparent macroscopic binding (Michaelis) constants CKMapp) for substrates<br>
The apparent macroscopic binding constant (KMBPP) for each substrate was calculated, from the dependence of enzyme activity as a function of substrate concentration. The observed rates were plotted on the ordinate against the related substrate concentration on the abscissa and the data fitted by direct regression analysis (Prism v 3.02; GraphPad, San Diego, USA) using Equation 1 (Comish-Bowden, A. Fundamentals of enzyme kinetics Portland Press; 1995, 93-128.).<br>
In Equation 1 'V is the observed initial rate, 'Fmaxapp' is the observed maximum activity at saturating substrate concentration, '£iviapp' is the apparent macroscopic binding (Michaelis) constant for the substrate, '[S0]' is the initial substrate concentration.<br>
Measurement of the inhibition constants<br>
The apparent inhibition constant (Kj) for each compound was determined on the basis that inhibition was reversible and occurred by a pure-competitive mechanism. The K\ values were calculated, from the dependence of enzyme activity as a function of inhibitor concentration, by direct regression analysis (Prism v 3.02) using Equation 2 (Cornish-Bowden, A., 1995.).<br><br><br>
In Equation 2 'vi' is the observed residual activity, 'Fmaxap!" is the observed maximum activity (i.e. in the absence of inhibitor), '^Mapp&gt; is the apparent macroscopic binding (Michaelis) constant for the substrate, e[S]' is the initial substrate concentration, 1K\ is the apparent dissociation constant and '[I]' is the inhibitor concentration.<br>
In situations where the apparent dissociation constant (£iapp) approached the enzyme concentrations, the £iapp values were calculated using a quadratic solution in the form described by Equation 3 (Morrison, J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci.,_l, 102-105, 1982; Morrison, J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Act^ 185, 269-286, 1969; Stone, S.R. and Hofsteenge, J. Biochemistry, 25,4622-4628,1986).<br><br>
In Equation 3 'vi' is the observed residual activity, 'F' is the difference between the maximum activity (i.e. in the absence of inhibitor) and minimum enzyme activity, CE0' is the total enzyme concentration, '^Tjapp' is the apparent dissociation constant and '!„' is the inhibitor concentration. Curves were fitted by non-linear regression<br>
analysis (Prism) using a fixed value for the enzyme concentration. Equation 4 was used to account for the substrate kinetics, where 'Ki is the inhibition constant, '[S0]' is the initial substrate concentration and 'j5rMapp' is the apparent macroscopic binding (Michaelis) constant for the substrate (Morrison, 1982).<br>
The second-order rate of reaction of inhibitor with enzyme<br>
Where applicable, the concentration dependence of the observed rate of reaction (^obs) of each compound with enzyme was analysed by determining the rate of enzyme inactivation under pseudo-first order conditions in the presence of substrate (Morrison, J.F., TIBS, 102-105,1982; Tian, W.X. and Tsou, C.L., Biochemistry, 21, 1028-1032, 1982; Morrison, IF. and Walsh, C.T., from Meister (Ed.), Advances in Enzymol., 61, 201-301,1988; Tsou, C.L., from Meister (Ed.), Advances in Enzymol, 6\j 381-436,1988;). Assays were carried out by addition of various concentrations of inhibitor to assay buffer containing substrate. Assays were initiated by the addition of enzyme to the reaction mixture and the change in fluorescence monitored over time. During the course of the assay less than 10% of the substrate was consumed.<br>
The activity fluorescence progress curves were fitted by non-linear regression analysis (Prism) using Eq. 5 (Morrison, 1969; Morrison, 1982); where T' is the fluorescence response, 't' is time, 'v0' is the initial velocity, 'vs' is the equilibrium steady-state velocity, 'A:0bs' is the observed pseudo first-order rate constant and 'D' is the intercept at time zero (i.e. the ordinate displacement of the curve). The second order rate constant was obtained from the slope of the line of a plot of &amp;0bS versus the inhibitor concentration (i.e. &amp;0bs/[I]). To correct for substrate kinetics, Eq. 6 was used, where '[S0]' is the iniitial substrate concentration and 'jK"Mapp' is the apparent macroscopic binding (Michaelis) constant for the substrate.<br>
Compounds of the invention were tested by the above described assays and observed to exhibit cruzipain inhibitory activity or inhibitory activity against an alternative CA Cl cysteine protease with an in vitro Ki inhibitory constant of less than or equal to 100|aM. Exemplary inhibition data for a number of example compounds of the invention are given in table 2.<br>
