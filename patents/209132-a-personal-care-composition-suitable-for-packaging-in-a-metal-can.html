Title of the invention<br>
A personal care composition suitable for packaging in a metal can<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1913 of Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai-400 020, State of Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification (particularly) describes the nature of this invention (and the manner in which it is to be performed)<br><br>
A PERSONAL CARE COMPOSITION SUITABLE FOR <br>
PACKGING IN A METAL CAN<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention concerns sprayable hair treatment<br>
such as hair styling mousses and mousse shampoos, dispensed<br>
from pressurisable metal cans.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Spray car.s such as pumps or aerosols are widely used as delivery systems for hair treatment products.  The problem of can corrosion is becoming particularly apparent as the transition to water-based formulations takes place for cost and environmental reasons.<br>
In an attempt to overcome this problem, aluminium cans have been employed.  Unfortunately, these materials are not as economical as ordinary tin-plated steel.  Furthermore, aluminium cans can also be susceptible to corrosion.<br>
Corrosion is manifest as,   tor  example, unsightly rust and, for aerosol formulations, loss of propellent.  Moreover, oxidation car. transform formulation components, such as those  constituting the fragrance, with consequential adverse effects on odour.  When corrosion is severe enough it, may ultimately cause leaking of the can in addition 10 contamination of the aerosol oroduct inside.<br><br>
In tin-plated cans, some amount of protection against corrosion is afforded by the tin, especially in the absence of any significant amount of water.  However, produce forms such as mousses, e.g. styling mousses or aerosol shampoos will typically contain a significant amount of water. Furthermore, even for systems traditionally based on organic solvents rather than water, such as hairsprays, environmental concerns and cost considerations have forced replacement of the organic solvent with, at least in part, water.<br>
furthermore, pressurised cans require valves, which are inherently more susceptible to corrosion than the body of the can itself, since the valve material is necessarily highly stressed during the process of assembly, making it a focus for corrosive attack.<br>
As described in Boulden, "Corrosion  Inhibitors for Water-Based Aerosol  Formulations",   Spray Technology and Marketing April 1993, the problem of corrosion has been a barrier to the introduction of many water-based aerosol formulations, even in aluminium containers, and  there is no generally applicable solution to this problem.<br>
Recafort, "Preventing Corrosion,   in  Aqueous  Based Aerosols", Spray Technology and Marketing December 1995, outlines the main approaches to minimising corrosion from fluids inside an aerosol container, of which one is the inclusion of corrosion inhibitors.  The article describes some typical examples of the different types cf corrosion inhibitors (ohosphates, silicates, bicarbonates and amines; and gives<br><br>
screening results for a range of inhibitors tested individually.  It is mentioned that the "optimum corrosion fix" would involve, Inzer  alia,   the utilisation of a synergistic combination of inhibitors simultaneously, but there is no specific guidance given on what the chemical constituents of such a combination might be.<br>
Examples of systems which have been found to be effective for corrosion inhibition in hairsprays are ammonium hydroxide, and a combination of sodium benzoate and cyclohexamine.  Further examples are described in the following patents:<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,604,226 discloses an inhibitor system comprising a mixture of an amine neutralised phosphate ester and a volatile amine, the latter selected from cyclohexamine, morpholine and isopropylamine.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,584,021 describes related technology wherein the inhibitor system is a mixture of nitroalkane and an amine neutralised phosphate ester.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,263,275  reports a hydroalcoholic, pressurised hairsoray composition wherein the anticorrosion agent is a phosphate salt cf a quaternary ammonium compound.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,343,731 discloses ammonium benzoate as an effective corrosion inhibitor for steel can packages containing sprayble heir treacent products particularly hairsoravs.  The ammonium benzoate is oreferably employed in<br><br>
combination with ammonium hydroxide, since this combination is said to deliver-more than just an additive effect.<br>
US Pat. Mo. 4,573,569 describes a mousse hair product which comprises a long chain nonionic ester which is said to reduce corrosivity when used in combination with corrosion inhibitors.<br>
US Pat. No. 5,462,727 describes an aqueous hair spray composition having a corrosion inhibitor consisting essentially of C.05-5% of an alkyl benzoate and O.Cl-5% of an organic borate.<br>
WO 95/14528 discloses the use of certain bis-oxazolidine compounds as  corrosion inhibitors.<br>
We have now found that a combination of a benzoate salt and an oxazolidine provides exceptionally effective corrosion inhibition.  Surprisingly, the combination delivers more than just an additive effect.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

Shamcco Comoositions<br>
■ ■ -The corrcsion-inhibiting additive of the present invention is particularly useful with shampoo compositions.<br>
Such compositions are generally characterised by containing at least one surfactant, to provide a cleansing benefit. Surfactant may also be present as emuisifier for amulsified<br><br>
conditioning agents which may be present in the shampoo, such as silicones.<br>
Further surfactant(s) will be present as an additional cleansing ingredient if sufficient for cleansing purposes i not provided as the emulsifier for the emulsified conditioning agents.  This further cleansing surfactant may be the same surfactant as the emulsifier, or may be different.<br>
Suitable emulsifiers are well known in the art and include anionic and nonionic surfactants.  Examples of anionic surfactants used as emulsifiers are alkylarylsulphonates, e.g., sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate, alkyl sulphates e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate, alkyl ether sulphates, e.g., sodium lauryl ether sulphate nEO, where n is from 1 to 20 alkylphenol ether sulphates, e.g., octylphenol ether sulphate nEO where n is from 1 to 20, and sulphosuccinates, e.g., sodium dioctylsulphosuccinate.<br>
Examples of nonionic surfactants used as emulsifiers are alkylphenol ethoxylates, e.g., nonylphenol ethoxylate nEO, where, n is from 1 to, 50,. alcahal ethoxyiates, e...g,.., lauryl alcohol nEO, where n is from 1 to 50, ester ethoxyiates, e.g., polyoxyethylene monostearate where the number of oxyethylene units is from 1 to 30.<br>
Cleansing surfactants are typically selected from anionic, nonicnic, amphoteric and zwitterionic surfactants, and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
Suitable anionic cleansing surfactants for compositions of the invention include, the alkyl sulphates, alkyl ether sulphates, alkaryl sulphonates, alkanoyl isethionates, alkyl succinates, alkyl sulphosuccinates, N-alkoyl sarcosinates, alkyl phosphates, alkyl ether phosphates, alkyl ether carboxylates, alpha-olefin sulphonates and acyl methyl taurates, especially their sodium, magnesium ammonium and mono-, di- and triethanolamine salts.

The total amount of surfactant (including any used as  emuisifier for the conditioning agent) is generally from 1<br>
to 50%, preferably from 5 to 30%, more preferably from 10%  to 25%, by total weight cf surfactant based on total weight  of the shampoo composition.<br>
r<br><br>
  The shampoo composition will typically comprise a   predominantly aqueous carrier, water forming the continuous   phase in which any particles of water-insoluble conditioning  agent are dispersed.  Water is generally present in an<br>
 amount of from 10 to 99%, preferably from 20 to 80%, more  preferably from 4 0 to 75%, by total weight cf water based on  total weight of the shampoo composition.<br>
 A particularly preferred product form according- to the  invention is an aerosol shampoo mousse based on surfactant  and water as described above and further containing an  aerostl orooeliant.  This agent is responsible for excelling<br><br>
the other materials from the container and forming the mousse character.<br>
The propellant gas can be any liquefiable gas conventionally used for aerosol containers.  Examples of suitable propellents include dimethyl ether, propane, n-butane and isobutane, used singly or admixed.  Other examples of propellents are nitrogen, carbon dioxide, compressed air and fluorohydrocarbons such as the material sold by Du Pone under the trade name DYMEL® 152a.<br>
The amount of the propellent gases is governed by normal factors well known in the aerosol art.  For mousses the level of propellent is generally from about 1 to about 15%, optimally from about 2 to about 10% for creamy foam and good sensory feel.<br>

Corrosion Testing<br>
Formulations were made up from the control formulation described above, using various corrosion inhibitors, as fellows:<br><br>
Test Formula  Formulation<br>
Control       Control formulation only<br>
A	Control formulation + 1.0%<br>
CRODASINIC® LS30   (Sodium lauryl<br>
sarcosinate, ex Croda Chemicals Ltd)<br>
B	Control formulation +1.0%<br>
CRODASINIC® 0 (Oleoyl sarcosine, ex<br>
Croda Chemicals Ltd)<br>
C	Control formulation + 1.0% DEHYQUART®<br>
SP (Quaternium-52, ex Kenkel)<br>
D	Control formulation +1.0% WITCONOL®<br>
14 (Poiyglyceryl-4 oieate, ex Witco)<br>
E	Control formulation + l.G% 0XA3AN®A<br>
(Dimethyl oxazolidone ex Angus Chemie<br>
GmbH)<br>
The corrosion test involved immersing a valve cup in the test formula and storage testing at 50°C.  The valve cup was tin-plate having an epoxypnenolic external lacquer and a 200 micron P? laminate on the interior.<br>
The results showed significant corrosion of the valve cup after 2 weeks storage for all :he test formulas except test formula E.  The valve cup immersed in -est formula E showed no signs of corrosion even afcer 5 weeks s-orage under the same conditions.<br><br><br>
A further corrosion test was conducted using the control and test formula E. Steel-based can components having various types of coating were immersed in the test formula and soaked for 3 months at room temperature.  The results are shown in the following table:<br><br>
Coding for corrosion results:<br>
5	Perfect - no visible change<br>
4	Some colour change apparent<br>
3	Marked colour change apparent<br>
2	Visible points of corrosion<br>
i	Obvious corrosion<br>
It was noted that in all the tests using the control, the formula became discoloured (rust coloured) and lost viscosity, whereas in ail the tests using test formula E,<br><br>
the test formula did not show discoloration and maintained viscosity.<br>
A third test was conducted using a pressurised system.  A tin-plate can with a PET laminate body and Ferrolite© components was filled with test formula and charged with propellant (4.0% Drivosol© 2.7, ex Huls).  The test formulas used were the control and a test formula F, corresponding to the control formula with the addition of 0.10% OXABAN0A.<br>
The cans were stored for 3 months in a horizontal position at 37°C and 50°C respectively.  After this period, visual signs of corrosion were seen in one of the components in the presence of the control formula.  In contrast, no such change was evident in the presence of test formula F.<br><br>
