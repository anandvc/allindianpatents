METHOD AND DEVICE FOR GRINDING HOT, WET RAW MATERIAL<br>
The invention relates to a method for grinding hot, wet raw material according to the<br>
preamble of claim 1 and to a device for grinding hot, wet raw material according to the<br>
preamble of claim 15.<br>
The invention particularly applies to the cement industry for grinding and simultaneously<br>
drying raw materials, such as cement clinker, slag and aggregates.<br>
It is known that for such mill drying processes vertical mills with integrated or mounted<br>
classifiers, particularly Loesche-type air-swept roller mills, are particularly suitable.<br>
Grinding systems with vertical mills can be operated in compound with rotary kilns and<br>
in addition the waste gases from the heat exchanger and clinker cooler process can be<br>
used for mill drying and for the pneumatic conveying of the milled material.<br>
DE 198 36 323 C2 describes methods and plants for the production of cement using a<br>
vertical mill.<br><br>
New page 2<br>
Besides the mill drying of raw powder in an air-swept roller mill, DE-AS 23 61 060 dis-<br>
closes cooling grinding of cement clinker in an air-swept roller mill downstream of a ro-<br>
tary tubular kiln.<br>
"US patent 4,597,537 discloses a vertical mill having an integrated classifier and a mill<br>
housing constructed in a defined manner. For improving classifier efficiency, fitted ele-<br>
ments are located in the vicinity of the upper grinding area and upstream of the classi-<br>
fier and influence the grinding material-fluid flow. In the vicinity of the classifier there are<br>
also tangential gas supplies with which the gas flow in the classifier is regulated. In the<br>
wall of the grit cone is provided a further gas supply for the supply of hot gas, in order to<br>
bring about a separation of fine particles adhering to the coarse particles with respect to<br>
the latter and the return thereof to the classifying area.<br>
For the grinding of slag and mixed cements use is advantageously made of modified<br>
Loesche-type roller mills, which can be referred to as 2+2 or 3+3 roller mills. In these<br>
vertical mills use is made of roller pairs, in each case comprising a precompressing<br>
roller or S-roller (slave roller) and a grinding roller, or M-roller (master roller) (EP 406<br>
644 B1).<br><br>
New page 2a<br>
When grinding raw material, such as cement clinker, slag and aggregates, the raw ma-<br>
terial components have different moisture contents and/or different temperatures. Hot<br>
cement clinker, which can have temperatures of 120Â° C and higher, is ground in cement<br>
plants on increasing the capacity of the rotary kilns and when the existing capacity of<br>
the clinker cooler is not adequate and/or if the clinker storage in silos or outside storage<br>
does not provide an adequate aftercooling time up to the time of grinding, which can<br>
particularly arise with on-line production.<br>
When grinding hot cement clinker in vertical mills with slag and wet aggregates the nec-<br>
essary cooling and drying gases deteriorate in their function as carrying gases. Drying<br>
gas or hot gas must be supplied at an adequately high temperature and volume, so that<br>
the drying process can take place quickly during grinding. The cooling gas, particularly<br>
fresh air, is admixed in regulated manner to the hot gas at corresponding feed tempera-<br>
tures, particularly of the cement clinker or slag.<br><br>
3<br>
In order to achieve the desired gas and product temperature downstream of the classi-<br>
fier, it is often necessary to inject water into the grinding chamber, e.g. into the coarse<br>
material circulation zone. The disadvantages are an increased energy demand due to<br>
the necessary cooling water evaporation, a deterioration of the cement quality and in-<br>
creased wear to the grinding parts, together with an increased energy demand at the ~<br>
mill motor.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a method and a device for the simultaneous<br>
grinding and drying of hot, wet raw material in a vertical mill, so as to ensure an opti-<br>
mum throughput capacity and energy saving and at the same time an improvement in<br>
the product quality, particularly in the case of mixed cements.<br>
With respect to the method the object is achieved through the features of claim 1 and<br>
with respect to the device by the features of claim 15. Appropriate and advantageous<br>
developments are contained in the subclaims and the description relative to the draw-<br>
ings.<br>
It is a fundamental idea of the inventive method to achieve a high grinding/drying effi-<br>
ciency, in that the temperature level of the hot gas, which is supplied to the mill via the<br>
nozzle ring or vane ring, is so adjusted that the milling and drying speeds are the same.<br>
This can lead to a maximum milling throughput capacity with a minimum electrical po-<br>
wer consumption of the mill, classifier and blower motors.<br><br>
New page 4<br>
According to the invention hot gas is supplied with a gas inlet temperature which, apart<br>
from taking account of the raw material temperature, is significantly determined by the<br>
moisture content of the raw material component with the highest moisture level. Accord-<br>
ing to the invention, for regulating the predetermined classifier outlet temperature of the<br>
gas-product mixture, as the cooling medium a cooling gas is introduced into the vertical<br>
mill above the nozzle ring and separately from the hot gas and is admixed with the<br>
ground material-gas mixture.<br>
An injection of water as the coolant is replaced or at least significantly reduced by the<br>
supply of a cooling gas, particularly fresh air from the environment. This leads to the<br>
advantage of saving heating energy due to the no longer necessary or reduced cooling<br>
water evaporation.<br>
It is advantageous that through the subdivision of the mill gas volume or carrying gas<br>
into hot gas, which is supplied to the lower part of the mill, and cooling gas which is<br>
supplied to the upper part of the mill, the simultaneous grinding and drying is deter-<br>
mined by the hot gas supplied here. Due to the high gas inlet temperatures in the lower<br>
area of the upper part of the mill a simultaneous grinding and raw material drying and<br>
therefore an optimum mill throughput capacity are possible. Simultaneously, due to the<br>
replacement of cooling water by cooling gas, particularly by fresh air or at least partially<br>
cooled air, in an energy-optimum manner the necessary product and gas temperature<br>
can be regulated after the mill and can advantageously be 
By obviating cooling water injection or injecting only significantly reduced cooling water<br>
quantities, there is a heating energy economy and simultaneously an improvement to<br><br>
New page 5<br>
the product quality. In addition, there are process advantages for downstream plant<br>
equipment, such as bag filters and blowers.<br>
It is appropriate to operate the grinding system with vertical mill, classifier and filter with<br>
a mill fan or blower, which produces a necessary volume flow. Generally the grinding<br>
system is vacuum-operated, so that advantageously ambient air can be sucked as cool-<br>
ing gas into the upper mill area.<br>
As a function of the feed temperature of the raw material components and the moisture<br>
content, it can be appropriate to supply the vertical mill with hot gas at an inlet tempera-<br>
ture &gt; 180Â° C, e.g. approximately 230Â° C.<br>
It has been found that a subdivision of the overall mill volume or the carrying gas in<br>
such a way that up to 70% of the volume flow is supplied as hot gas to the lower part of<br>
the mill and up to 30% as cooling gas, particularly fresh air, to the upper part of the mill,<br>
is advantageous for optimizing the mill drying efficiency of a cement clinker and slag<br>
grinding and supplied aggregates. The total gas quantity of the vertical mill is regulated<br>
by a mill fan action and measurements downstream of the filter.<br>
Appropriately the cooling gas is introduced into the upper mill part with a swirling flow<br>
into the grinding area corresponding to the rising grinding material-gas mixture. Relative<br>
to the grinding rollers rolling on the grinding pan and optionally present slave rollers, it is<br>
appropriate to have the supply of cooling gas in an area between the grinding rollers or<br>
between a grinding roller and a slave roller.<br><br>
New page 6<br>
It is also advantageous to measure the hot gas inlet temperature upstream of the verti-<br>
cal mill and to regulate it by a hot gas generator and/or by a gas supply from neighbour-<br>
ing processes, e.g. from a clinker cooler, and/or by the return of waste gases down-<br>
stream of the filter and mill fan.<br>
The inventive device for grinding hot, wet raw material, particularly cement clinker, slag<br>
and aggregates, has a grinding system with a vertical mill, a classifier and a feed line for<br>
hot gas, as well as at least one supply device for a cooling medium for regulating a pre-<br>
determined gas and product temperature downstream of the classifier, the supply de-<br>
vices being designed for a cooling gas, preferably fresh air from the environment and<br>
above the nozzle ring and positioned upstream of the classifier in the upper mill part and<br>
between the grinding rollers or between the grinding rollers and slave rollers.<br>
Appropriately the supply devices are swirl boxes equipped with adjustable swirl flaps for<br>
regulating the cooling air quantities as a function of the desired temperature value<br>
downstream of the classifier.<br><br>
New page 6a<br>
Downstream of the classifier the grinding system has a filter, e.g. a bag filter, and a<br>
downstream mill fan, which with a relatively high suction capacity ensures a vacuum or<br>
suction operation in the mill, classifier and filter and advantageously permits an intake<br>
into the upper part of the mill of ambient air. Optionally there can be an additional blo-<br>
wer for the cooling gas supply.<br>
Appropriately there is a controlled system for cooling gas supply, in which the gas and<br>
product temperature downstream of the classifier is a controlled variable.<br><br>
7<br>
Combined with said controlled system advantageously there is a second controlled sys-<br>
tem, which controls the hot gas quantity and temperature in the vertical mill. The con-<br>
trolled variables can be the maximum moisture content of a raw material component<br>
and the hot gas temperature in the feed line to the vertical mill.<br>
Appropriately the swirl flaps of the swirl boxes are set up for a tangential cooling gas<br>
supply to ensure that the cooling gas has virtually the same flow direction as the rising<br>
grinding material-gas mixture.<br>
The invention is described in greater detail hereinafter relative to embodiments and with<br>
reference to the attached highly diagrammatic drawings, wherein show:<br>
Fig. 1	A plant diagram for a device according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 2	A plan view of the grinding pan of an inventive vertical mill.<br>
Fig. 3	A plan view of the grinding pan of an inventive 2+2 roller mill.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a grinding system with an inventive vertical mill 2 in the form here of a<br>
Loesche-type air-swept roller mill and having an integrated classifier 6. In highly dia-<br>
grammatic manner is shown a supply of hot gas 4 via a hot gas feed line 14 in the lower<br>
mill part 3 and a supply of cooling gas 8 in the upper mill part 5. There is a separate<br>
supply, particularly of max 70% hot gas 4 and max 30% cooling gas 8 to the grinding<br>
area 7. The hot gas 4 and cooling gas 8 form the supporting or carrying gas for the mill<br>
drying process.<br>
The hot gas 4 is in per se known manner supplied by means of a nozzle or vane ring<br>
(not shown) surrounding a grinding pan in the lower mill part 3 and is used for the drying<br>
of the raw materials, e.g. cement clinker, slag and wet aggregates (not shown) supplied<br>
via a not shown feed mechanism, as well as proportionally the pneumatic conveying of<br>
the grinding material-gas mixture into the classifier 6.<br>
A temperature measuring device 21 is positioned upstream of the vertical mill 2 in the<br>
hot gas feed line 14 for controlling the hot gas supply, and as a function of the quantity,<br>
wetness and temperature of the supplied raw material components and the predeter-<br>
mined gas and product temperature downstream of the classifier 6, the temperature and<br>
volume of the hot gas 4 are controlled.<br><br>
8<br>
The hot gas line 14 is connected to a return line 20 for the waste gas from filter 11,<br>
which is connected downstream of the vertical mill 2 with classifier 6, so that part of the<br>
waste gas can be admixed with the hot gas 4 from a hot gas generator 17.<br>
The hot gas 4 fed to the vertical mill 2 together with the cooling gas 8 supplied to the<br>
upper mill part 5 and which is in particular fresh or ambient air, forms the carrying gas<br>
with which the grinding material is conveyed in the rising grinding material-gas mixture -<br>
to the classifier 6 and via a connecting line 22 to filter 11.<br>
A mill fan 12 downstream of filter 11 has the necessary suction capacity and ensures a<br>
vacuum in vertical mill 2, classifier 6 and filter 11, so that advantageously the cooling air<br>
8 necessary for a predetermined gas and product temperature downstream of the clas-<br>
sifier 6 can be sucked in. The cooling air 8 passes via supply devices 18, which are lo-<br>
cated in or on the mill housing 13 of the upper mill part 5, into the grinding area or<br>
chamber 7.<br>
A controlled system with a temperature measuring device 23 is positioned downstream<br>
of classifier 6 in connecting line 23 for controlling the cooling gas or fresh air supply.<br>
In order in the case of particularly high raw material, e.g. cement clinker inlet tempera-<br>
tures to ensure the desired gas and product temperature downstream of the classifier, a<br>
cooling water supply 19 is provided in grinding area 7. However, the controllable water<br>
injection is greatly reduced and is essentially replaced by the fresh air supply in the up-<br>
per mill part 5.<br>
Fig. 2 shows in highly diagrammatic form the arrangement of supply devices 18 for the<br>
cooling gas 8 in the upper mill part.<br>
Here the supply devices 8 are swirl boxes, whose swirl flaps can be set for a controlled<br>
tangential supply or swirling flow corresponding to the rising grinding material-gas flow<br>
in grinding area 7 (fig. 1).<br>
On a grinding pan 10 roll two grinding rollers 15 and in the area between the grinding<br>
rollers 15 are provided two swirl boxes 18 as supply devices for fresh air 8 in or on mill<br>
housing 13 (cf. fig. 1).<br><br>
-9-<br>
Fig. 3 shows in highly diagrammatic form a detail of a 2+2 roller mill, in which two grind-<br>
ing rollers 15 and two slave rollers 16 roll on a grinding pan 10. Between each slave<br>
roller 16 and each grinding roller 15 are provided in the upper mill part 5 supply devices<br>
18 for a controlled supply of the.cooling gas 8 corresponding to the swirling flow of the<br>
rising grinding material-gas mixture.<br><br>
