				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention in general relates to the field of network management and in particular to the configuration of network elements through Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). More specifically the present invention relates to a method for avoiding conflicts in an SNMP configuration employing multiple methods.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Routers and other systems generally provide more than one configuration tools such as Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Command Line Interface (CLI), Web application etc. to configure the system modules. Configuration conflict is quite likely when different configuration methods are provided in a system, which paves the way for simultaneous configuration to exist. Inconsistencies happen quite often when many configuration methods are employed and multiple administrators are deployed. This poses a challenge in configuration management and configuration recovery in case of system crash.<br>
The present invention pertains to the configuration of network elements through Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), which is a set of network management standards for IP-based inter networks. SNMP includes a protocol, a database-structure specification, and a set of management data objects, and SNMP implementations typically consist of a management application running on one or more network management systems (NMSs), and agent applications, usually executing in firmware on various network devices.<br>
SNMP obtains information from the network through a Management Information Base (MIB). MIB is a database of code blocks called MIB objects wherein each MIB object controls one specific function, such as counting how many bytes are transmitted through an agent's port. The MIB object consists of MIB variables, which define the MIB object name, description, and default value.<br>
An effective remedy to prevention of conflicts is still a confounding problem to experts in this field. The present invention proposes a method for avoiding conflicts in an SNMP configuration employing multiple methods. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore the primary object of the present invention to provide a configuration lock to avoid configuration conflicts in SNMP<br>
It is another object of the present invention to allow only one configuration method at time to avoid conflict with the help of proper locking mechanisms.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to acquire or release a configuration lock using AgentX notification messages.<br>
Accordingly the invention provides a method for avoiding conflicts in an SNMP configuration employing multiple methods with the help of a configuration lock mechanism controlled using AgentX notification messages to ensure that only one configuration method is serving at a time, wherein SNMP maintains a private Management Information Base (MIB) Object Identifier (OID) to keep track of the status of the configuration lock, the method comprising<br>
a)	checking the current value of the configuration lock in the MIB upon receiving an AgentX notification message at the registered OID of SNMP from an aspiring method;<br>
b)	assigning the configuration lock a unique number representative of the above said method after ascertaining there is no other configuration<br>
method in process;<br>
c)	denying access to all other configuration methods until the above said method is officiating; and<br>
d)	releasing the configuration lock after confirming the intention of the officiating method to relinquish the control.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the present invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 depicts a scenario of configuration conflict in accordance with the existing art;<br>
Figure 2 depicts operation of the present invention according to one embodiment<br>
of the present invention. Figure 3 depicts operation of the present invention according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Figure 4 depicts operation of the present invention according to another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however<br>
that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description is not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However, in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Figure 1 depicts a scenario of configuration conflict in accordance with the existing art where SNMP and some other configuration method (for example CLI) performs set operation on module X simultaneously thus producing inconsistencies in module X's configuration.<br>
The present invention proposes a locking mechanism which can limit the system configuration to one method at a time and thereby avoiding configuration conflicts. The lock mechanism is implemented in SNMP daemon and other configuration methods. The mechanism uses the AgentX notification messages to acquire or free the configuration lock. According to this scheme:<br>
•	Every Configuration method shall send an AgentX Configuration- Lock Notification/Trap to SNMP to acquire the configuration lock before configuring any daemon.<br>
•	SNMP maintains the configuration lock internally by implementing a private MIB OID. The values for the OID can be as follows:<br>
Every configuration method sends a notification message to SNMP on its registered OID. After receiving the notification message, SNMP checks the value of the configuration lock. A value of zero implies that no configuration is in progress. Hence, the lock can be assigned to the requesting configuration method. SNMP sets the configuration lock value equal to the OID of the requesting configuration method.<br>
To release a lock, a configuration method sends a notification message to SNMP at OID=zero. If the notification message is originated by the configuration method that currently possesses the configuration lock, the lock is released and SUCCESS response is sent to the requesting configuration method. Otherwise, an ERROR response is sent.<br>
Figure 2 depicts operation of the present invention according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention. SNMP maintains the configuration lock in its process memory. The lock is initialized to zero, which means that at that time no configuration method is configuring the system. When the user tries to configure the system though configuration method (ID=n), the configuration method sends an AgentX notification message to SNMP at its registered OID. After receiving the notification message, SNMP checks the current value of the configuration lock. In this case, it is zero, which means that no configuration is in process, hence SNMP updates the configuration lock value to 'n\ and sends SUCCESS response to configuration method (ID=n). Once the configuration method (ID=n) receives a successful response to its notification, it starts configuring the daemon X in the system.<br>
When the configuration through configuration method (ID=n) is in process, SNMP gets a configuration request from user. It checks the value of the configuration lock. Since it is not zero, it sends an error response to the user.<br>
Once the configuration method (ID=n) finishes configuring daemon X, it sends a notification message to SNMP at OID=zero. After verifying that the configuration release request has come from the module which currently holds the lock, SNMP releases the lock by resetting its value to zero, and sends a SUCCESS response to the requestor.<br>
When the user tries to configure the system through SNMP again, SNMP checks the value of the configuration lock, which is zero. Hence, it acquires the lock by setting its value to one, and completes the configuration command issued by the user. Once the configuration is finished, SNMP releases the lock by resetting the configuration lock value to zero.<br>
Figure 3 depicts operation of the present invention according to another embodiment of the present invention. The lock is initialized to zero, which implies that at that time no configuration method is configuring the system. When the user tries to configure the system though configuration method (ID=Y), the configuration method sends an AgentX notification message to SNMP at configuration OID=Y. After receiving the notification, SNMP checks the current value of the configuration lock. In this case, it is zero, which means that no configuration is in process, hence SNMP updates the configuration lock value to 'Y\ and sends SUCCESS in response to configuration method (ID=Y). Once the configuration method (ID=Y) receives a successful response to its notification, it starts configuring the daemon X in the system.<br>
When the configuration through configuration method (ID=Y) is in process, configuration method (ID=X) gets a configuration request from user. Configuration method (ID=X) sends an AgentX notification message to SNMP at its registered OID. Upon receiving the request, SNMP checks the value of the configuration lock. Since it is non-zero, it sends an ERROR response to configuration method (ID=X), indicating that system configuration is in progress through some other configuration method. Upon receiving the ERROR response from SNMP, the configuration method (ID=X) sends an ERROR response to the user, thus avoiding a configuration conflict.<br>
Figure 4 depicts operation of the present invention according to yet another embodiment of the present invention. The lock is initialized to zero, which means that at that time no configuration method is configuring the system. When SNMP gets a user request for system configuration, it checks the value of the configuration lock. Since it is zero, SNMP acquires the lock by setting its value to one. SNMP then starts performing the system configuration.<br>
In the meantime, configuration method (ID=N) gets a configuration request from user. Configuration method (ID=N) sends an AgentX notification message to<br>
SNMP at configuration OID=N. Upon receiving the request, SNMP checks the value of the configuration iock. Since it is non-zero, it sends an ERROR response to configuration method (ID=N), indicating that system configuration is in progress through some other configuration method. Upon receiving the ERROR response from SNMP, the configuration method (ID=N) sends an error message to the user, thus avoiding a configuration conflict.<br>
Once SNMP finished the system configuration, it releases the lock by resetting its value to zero.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from. <br>
GLOSSARY OF TERMS AND DEFINITIONS THEREOF SNMP<br>
SNMP is simple network management protocol. SNMP is a standard for gathering statistical data about network traffic and the behavior of network components. SNMP uses management information bases (MIBs), which define what information is available from any manageable network device. CLI<br>
CLI is Command Line Interface. CLI provides a user a visual prompt where commands can be issued to configure a particular application in a system. MIB<br>
Management information base (MIB) is a formal description of a set of network objects that can be managed using the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). The format of the MIB is defined as part of the SNMP. (All other MIBs are extensions of this basic management information base.)<br><br><br><br><br>
