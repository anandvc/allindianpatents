				<td>AGENTS FOR PREVENTING AND TREATING DISORDERS INVOLVING MODULATION OF THE RYR RECEPTORS<br>
[001]   This invention was made with government support under NIH Grant No. PO1 HL 67849-01. As such, the United States government may have certain rights in this invention. This application claims priority to U.S. patent application serial number 11/212,413, filed on August 25, 2005.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[002]   This invention relates to compounds and their use to treat and prevent disorders and diseases associated with the RyR receptors that regulate calcium channel functioning in cells. More particularly, the invention discloses compounds that are related to 1,4-benzothiazepines and are useful to treat cardiac and skeletal muscular disorders. The invention also discloses pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds and articles of manufacture comprising the pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[003]   The sarcoplasmic reticulurn (SR) is a structure in cells that functions, among other things, as a specialized intracellular calcium (Ca2+) store. Channels in the SR called ryanodine receptors (RyRs) open and close to regulate the release of Ca2+ from the SR into the intracellular cytoplasm of the cell. Release of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm from the SR increases cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. Open probability (Po) of the RyR receptor refers to the likelihood that the RyR channel is open at any given moment, and therefore capable of releasing Ca2+ into the cytoplasm from the SR.<br>
[004]   There are three types of ryanodine receptors, all of which are highly-related Ca2+ channels: RyRl, RyR2, and RyR3. RyRl is found predominantly in skeletal muscle as well as other tissues, RyR2 is found predominantly in the heart as well as other tissues, and RyR3 is found in the brain as well as other tissues. The RyR channels are formed by four RyR polypeptides in association with four FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs), specifically FKBP12 (calstabinl) and FKBP12.6 (calstabin2). Calstabinl binds to RyRl, calstabin2 binds to RyR2, and calstabinl binds to RyR3. The FKBP proteins (calstabinl and calstabin2) bind to the RyR channel (one molecule per RyR subunit), stabilize RyR-channel functioning, and facilitate coupled gating between neighboring RyR channels, thereby preventing abnormal activation of the channel during the channel's closed state.<br>
 <br>
[005]   Besides the calstabin binding proteins, protein kinase A (PKA) also binds to the cytoplasmic surface of the RyR receptors. PICA phosphorylation of the RyR receptors causes partial dissociation of calstabins from RyRs. Dissociation of calstabin from RyR causes increased open probability of RyR, and therefore increased Ca + release from the SR into the intracellular cytoplasm.<br>
[006]   Ca2+ release from the SR in skeletal muscle cells and heart cells is a key physiological mechanism that controls muscle performance, because increased concentration of Ca   in the intracellular cytoplasm causes contraction of the muscle.<br>
[007]   Excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in skeletal muscles involves electrical depolarization of the plasma membrane in the transverse tubule (T-tubule), which activates voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCCs). LTCCs trigger Ca2+ release from the SR through physical interaction with RyRl. The resulting increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration induces actin-myosin interaction and muscle contraction. To enable relaxation, intracellular Ca2+ is pumped back into the SR via SR Ca2+-ATPase pumps (SERCAs), which is regulated by phospholamban (PLB) depending on the muscle fiber type.<br>
[008]   It has been shown that disease forms that result in sustained activation of the sympathetic nervous system and increased plasma catecholarnine levels cause maladaptive activation of intracellular stress pathways resulting in destabilization of the RyRl channel closed state and intracellular Ca2+ leak. SR Ca2+ leak via RyRl channels was found to deplete intracellular SR calcium stores, to increase compensatory energy consumption, and to result in significant acceleration of muscle fatigue. The stress-induced muscle defect permanently reduces isolated muscle and in vivo performance particularly in situations of increased demand.<br>
[009]   It also has been shown that destabilization of the RyRl closed state occurs under pathologic conditions of increased sympathetic activation and involves depletion of the stabilizing calstabinl (FKBP12) channel subunit. Proof-of-principle experiments have shown that PKA activation as an end effector of the sympathetic nervous systems increases RyRl PKA phosphorylation at Ser-2843 which decreases the binding affinity of calstabinl to RyRl and increases channel open probability.<br>
[010]   In cardiac striated muscle, RyR2 is the major Ca2+- release channel required for EC coupling and muscle contraction. During EC coupling, depolarization of the cardiac-muscle cell membrane during phase zero of the action potential activates voltage-gated Ca2+<br>
 <br>
channels. Ca2+ influx through the open voltage-gated channels in turn initiates Ca2+ release from the SR via RyR2. This process is known as Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. The RyR2-mediated, Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release then activates the contractile proteins in the cardiac cell, resulting in cardiac muscle contraction.<br>
[Oil]   Phosphorylation of cardiac RyR2 by PKA is an important part of the "fight or flight" response that increases cardiac EC coupling gain by augmenting the amount of Ca2+ released for a given trigger. This signaling pathway provides a mechanism by which activation of the sympathetic nervous system, in response to stress, results in increased cardiac output. PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 increases the open probability of the channel by dissociating calstabin2 (FKBP12.6) from the channel complex, This, in turn, increases the sensitivity of RyR2 to Ca2+-dependent activation.<br>
[012]   Despite advances in treatment, heart failure remains an important cause of mortality in Western countries. An important hallmark of heart failure is reduced myocardial contractility. In heart failure, contractile abnormalities result, in part, from alterations in the signaling pathway that allows the cardiac action potential to trigger Ca2+ release via RyR2 channels and muscle contraction. In particular, in failing hearts, the amplitude of the whole-cell Ca2+ transient is decreased and the duration prolonged.<br>
[013]   Cardiac arrhythmia., a common feature of heart failure, results in many of the deaths associated with the disease. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in humans, and represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Structural and electrical remodeling - including shortening of atrial refractoriness, loss of rate-related adaptation of refractoriness, and shortening of the wavelength of re-entrant wavelets - accompany sustained tachycardia. This remodeling is likely important in the development, maintenance and progression of atrial fibrillation. Studies suggest that calcium handling plays a role in electrical remodeling in atrial fibrillation.<br>
[014]   Approximately 50% of all patients with heart disease die from fatal cardiac arrhythmias. In some cases, a ventricular arrhythmia in the heart is rapidly fatal - a phenomenon referred to as "sudden cardiac death" (SCD). Fatal ventricular arrhythmias and SCD also occur in young, otherwise-healthy individuals who are not known to have structural heart disease. In fact, ventricular arrhythmia is the most common cause of sudden death in otherwise-healthy individuals.<br>
 <br>
[015]   Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited disorder in individuals with structurally normal hearts. It is characterized by stress-induced ventricular tachycardia - a lethal arrhythmia that causes SCD. hi subjects with CPVT, physical exertion and/or stress induce bidirectional and/or polymorphic ventricular tachycardias that lead to SCD even in the absence of detectable structural heart disease. CPVT is predominantly inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion. Individuals with CPVT have ventricular arrhythmias when subjected to exercise, but do not develop arrhythmias at rest. Studies have identified mutations in the human RyR2 gene, on chromosome Iq42-q43, in individuals with CPVT.<br>
[016]   Failing hearts (e.g., in patients with heart failure and in animal models of heart failure) are characterized by a maladaptive response that includes chronic hyperadrenergic stimulation. In heart failure, chronic beta-adrenergic stimulation is associated with the activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart, which, through coupling with G-proteins, activate adenylyl cyclase and thereby increase intracellular cAMP concentration. CAMP activates cAMP-dependent PKA, which has been shown to induce hyperphosphorylation of RyR2. Thus, chronic heart failure is a chronic hyperadrenergic state that results in several pathologic consequences, including PICA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2.<br>
[017]   The PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 has been proposed as a factor contributing to depressed contractile function and arrhythmogenesis in heart failure. Consistent with this hypothesis, PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 in failing hearts has been demonstrated, in vivo, both in animal models and in patients with heart failure undergoing cardiac transplantation.<br>
[018]   In failing hearts, the hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 by PKA induces the dissociation of FKBP12.6 (calstabin2) from the RyR2 channel, This causes marked changes in the biophysical properties of the RyR2 channel, including increased open probability (Po) due to an increased sensitivity to Ca~+-dependent activation; destabilization of the channel, resulting in sub conductance states; and impaired coupled gating of the channels, resulting in defective EC coupling and cardiac dysfunction. Thus, PKA-hyperphosphorylated RyR2 is very sensitive to low-level Ca2+ stimulation, and this.manifests itself as a diastolic SR Ca2+ leak through the PKA hyperphosphorylated RyR2 channel.<br>
[019]   The maladaptive response to stress in heart failure results in depletion of FKBP 12.6 from the channel macromolecular complex. This leads to a shift to the left in the sensitivity<br>
 <br>
of RyR2 to Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, resulting in channels that are more active at low-to-moderate Ca2+ concentrations. Over time, the increased "leak" through RyR2 results in resetting of the SR Ca2"1" content to a lower level, which in turn reduces EC coupling gain and contributes to impaired systolic contractility.<br>
[020]   Additionally, a subpopulation of RyR2 that are particularly "leaky" can release SR Ca2+ during the resting phase of the cardiac cycle, diastole. This results in depolarizations of the cardiomyocyte membrane known as delayed after-depolarizations (DADs), which are known to trigger fatal ventricular cardiac arrhythmias.<br>
[021]   In patients with CPVT mutations in their RyR2 and otherwise structurally-normal hearts, a similar phenomenon is at work. Specifically, it is known that exercise and stress induce the release of catecholamines that activate beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart. Activation of the beta-adrenergic receptors leads to PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 channels. Evidence also suggests that the PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 resulting from beta-adrenergic-receptor activation renders mutated RyR2 channels more likely to open in the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle, increasing the likelihood of arrhythmias.<br>
[022]   Cardiac arrhythmias are known to be associated with diastolic SR Ca2+ leaks in patients with CPVT mutations in their RyR2 and otherwise structurally-normal hearts. In these cases, the most common mechanism for induction and maintenance of ventricular tachycardia is abnormal automaticity. One form of abnormal automaticity, known as triggered arrhythmia, is associated with aberrant release of SR Ca2+, which initiates DADs. DADs are abnormal depolarizations in cardiomyocytes that occur after repolarization of a cardiac action potential. The molecular basis for the abnormal SR Ca2+ release that results in DADs has not been fully elucidated. However, DADs are known to be blocked by ryanodine, providing evidence that RyR2 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of this aberrant Ca2+ release.<br>
[023]   U.S. Patent No. 6,489,125 discusses JTV-519 (4-[3-(4-benzylpiperidin-l-yl)propionyl]-7-methoxy-2,3,435-tetrahydro-l,4-be]izothiazepinemonohydrochloride; also known as k201 or ICP-Calstan 100), a l,4-benzothiazepines as a new modulator of RyR calcium-ion channels.<br>
[024]   Co-pending application U.S. Serial No. 10/763,498 discusses RyR2 as a target for treating and preventing heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and cardiac arrhythmias that cause exercise-induced sudden cardiac death (SCD). RyR2 channels<br>
 <br>
with 7 different CPVT mutations (e.g., S2246L, R2474S, N4104K, R4497C, P2328S, Q4201R, V4653F) were found to have functional defects that resulted in channels that became leaky (i.e., a calcium leak) when stimulated during exercise. The mechanism for the VT in CPVT has been demonstrated to be the same as the mechanism for VT in heart failure.<br>
[025]   It has been shown that exercise-induced arrhythmias and sudden death (in patients with CPVT) result from a reduced affinity of FKBP12.6 (calstabin2) for RyR2. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that exercise activates RyR2 as a result of phosphorylation by adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein Icinase (PKA). Mutant RyR2 channels, which had normal function in planar lipid bilayers under basal conditions, were more sensitive to activation by PKA phosphorylation - exhibiting increased activity (open probability) and prolonged open states, as compared with wild-type channels. In addition, PKA-phosphorylated mutant RyR2 channels were resistant to inhibition by Mg2+, a physiological inhibitor of the channel, and showed reduced binding to FKBP12.6 (aka calstabin2, which stabilizes the channel in the closed state). These findings indicate that, during exercise, when the RyR2 are PKA-phosphorylated, the mutant CPVT channels are more likely to open in the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle (diastole), increasing the likelihood of arrhythmias triggered by SR Ca2+ leak.<br>
[026]   Additionally, co-pending U.S. Patent Application No. 09/288,606 discusses a method for regulating contraction of a subject's heart by administering a compound that regulates PICA phosphorylation of an RyR2 receptor and specifically decreases PKA phosphorylation. Co-pending U.S. Patent Application No. 10/608,723 also discusses a method for treating and prophylaxis for atrial tachyarrhythmia and exercise and stress-induced arrhythmias by administration of an agent which inhibits PKA phosphorylation of RyR2.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[027]   In view of the foregoing, there is a need to identify new agents effective for treating or preventing disorders and diseases associated with the RyR receptors that regulate calcium channel functioning in cells, including skeletal muscular disorders and diseases and especially cardiac disorders and diseases. More particularly, a need remains to identify new compounds that can be used to treat RyR associated disorders by, for example, repairing the leak inRyR channels, and enhancing binding of FKBP proteins (calstabinl and calstabin2) to PKA-phosphorylated RyR, and to mutant RyR that otherwise have reduced affinity for, or do not bind to, FKBP 12 and FKBP 12.6. Embodiments of the invention solve some or all of these needs.<br>

Moreover, the compounds of the invention normalize gating of mutant RyR channels, including CPVT-associated mutant RyR2 channels, by increasing FKBP12 (calstabinl) and FKBP12.6 (calstabin2) binding affinity. Therefore, the compounds of the invention revent disorders and conditions involving modulation of the RyR receptors, particularly the RyRl and RyR2 receptors. Examples of such disorders and conditions include, without limitation, cardiac disorders and diseases, skeletal muscular disorders and diseases, cognitive disorders and diseases, malignant hyperthermia, diabetes, and sudden infant death syndrome. Cardiac disorder and diseases include, but are not limited to, irregular heartbeat disorders and diseases; exercise-induced irregular heartbeat disorders and diseases; sudden cardiac death; exercise-induced sudden cardiac death; congestive heart failure; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and high blood pressure. Irregular heartbeat disorders and diseases include and exercise-induced irregular heartbeat disorders and diseases include, but are not limited to, atrial and ventricular arrhythmia; atrial and ventricular fibrillation; atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmia; atrial and ventricular tachycardia; catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT); and exercise-induced variants thereof.

Cognitive disorders and diseases include, but are not limited to, Alzheimer's Disease, forms of memory loss, and age-dependent memory<br>
 <br>
loss. The compounds of the invention treat these disorders and conditions by increasing FKBP12 (calstabinl)-RyRl binding affinity and increasing FKBP12.6 (calstabin2)-RyR2 binding affinity.<br>
[0200] In accordance with the foregoing, the present invention provides a method for limiting or preventing a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP (calstabin) hi cells of a subject. As used herein, "RyR" includes RyRl, RyR2, and RyR3. Additionally, FKBP includes both FKBP 12 (calstabinl) and FKBP 12.6 (calstabin2). "RyR-bound FKBP" therefore refers to RyRl-bound FKBP12 (calstabinl), RyR2-bound FKBP12.6 (calstabin2), and RyR3-bound FKBP 12 (calstabinl).<br>
[0201] As used herein, "RyR" also includes a "RyR protein" and a "RyR analogue." A"RyR analogue" is a functional variant of the RyR protein, having RyR biological activity, that has 60% or greater amino-acid-sequence homology with the RyR protein. The RyR of the present invention are unphosphorylated, phosphorylated (e.g., by PKA), or hyperphosphorylated (e.g., by PKA). As further used herein, the term "RyR biological activity" refers to the activity of a protein or peptide that demonstrates an ability to associate physically with, or bind with, FKBP12 (calstabinl) m the case of RyRl and RyR3, and FKBP12.6 (calstabin2) in the case of RyR2 (i.e., binding of approximately two fold or, approximately five fold, above the background binding of a negative control), under the conditions of the assays described herein.<br>
[0202] As used herein, "FKBP" includes both an "FKBP protein" and an "FKBP analogue," whether it be FKBP12 (calstabinl) or FKBP12.6 (calstabin2). Unless otherwise indicated herein, "protein" shall include a protein, protein domain, polypeptide, or peptide, and any fragment thereof. An "FKBP analogue" is a functional variant of the FKBP protein, having FKBP biological activity, that has 60% or greater amino-acid-sequence homology with the FKBP protein, whether it be FKBP 12 (calstabinl) or FKBP12.6 (calstabin2).    As further used herein, the term "FKBP biological activity" refers to the activity of a protein or peptide that demonstrates an ability to associate physically with, or bind with, unphosphorylated or non-hyperphosphorylated RyR2 (i.e., binding of approximately two fold, or approximately five fold, above the background binding of a negative control), under the conditions of the assays described herein.<br>
[0203] FKBP binds to the RyR channel, one molecule per RyR subunit. Accordingly, as used herein, the term "RyR-bound FKBP" includes a molecule of an FKBP 12 (calstabinl)<br>
 <br>
protein that is bound to an RyRl protein subunit or a tetramer of FKBP12 that is in association with a tetramer of RyRl, a molecule of FKBP12.6 (calstabin2) protein that is bound to an RyR2 protein subunit or a tetramer of FKBP12.6 that is in association with a tetramer of RyR2, and a molecule of an FKBP12 (calstabinl) protein that is bound to an RyR3 protein subunit or a tetramer of FKBP12 that is in association with a tetramer of RyR3. Therefore, "RyR-bound FKBP" refers to "RyRl-bound FKBP12," "RyR2-bound FKBP12.6," and "RyR3-bound FKBP12."<br>
[0204] In accordance with the method of the present invention, a "decrease" or "disorder" in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in cells of a subject refers to a detectable decrease, diminution or reduction in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in cells of the subject. Such a decrease is limited or prevented in cells of a subject when the decrease is in any way halted, hindered, impeded, obstructed or reduced by the administration of compounds of the invention, such that the level of RyR-bound FKBP in cells of the subject is higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of the administered compound.<br>
[0205] The level of RyR-bound FKBP in a subject is detected by standard assays and techniques, including those readily determined from the known art (e.g., immunological techniques, hybridization analysis, immunoprecipitation, Western-blot analysis, fluorescence imaging techniques and/or radiation detection, etc.), as well as any assays and detection methods disclosed herein. For example, protein is isolated and purified from cells of a subject using standard methods known in the art, including, without limitation, extraction from the cells (e.g., with a detergent that solubilizes the protein) where necessary, followed by affinity purification on a column, chromatography (e.g., FTLC and HPLC), immunoprecipitation (with an antibody), and precipitation (e.g., with isopropanol and a reagent such as Trizol). Isolation and purification of the protein is followed by electrophoresis (e.g., on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel). A decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in a subject, or the limiting or prevention thereof, is determined by comparing the amount of RyR-bound FKBP detected prior to the administration of JTV-519 or a compound of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, 1-1 or I-m, (in accordance with methods described below) with the amount detected a suitable time after administration of the compound.<br>
[0206] A decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in cells of a subject is limited or prevented, for example, by inhibiting dissociation of FKBP and RyR in cells of the subject; by increasing binding between FKBP and RyR in cells of the subject; or by stabilizing the<br>
 <br>
RyR-FKBP complex in cells of a subject. As used herein, the term "inhibiting dissociation" includes blocking, decreasing, inhibiting, limiting or preventing the physical dissociation or separation of an FKBP subunit from an RyR.molecule in cells of the subject, and blocking, decreasing, inhibiting, limiting or preventing the physical dissociation or separation of an RyR molecule from an FKBP subunit in cells of the subject. As further used herein, the term "increasing binding" includes enhancing, increasing, or improving the ability of phosphorylated RyR to associate physically with FKBP (e.g., binding of approximately two fold or, approximately five fold, above the background binding of a negative control) in cells of the subject and enhancing, increasing or improving the ability of FKBP to associate physically with phosphorylated RyR (e.g., binding of approximately two fold, or, approximately five fold, above the background binding of a negative control) in cells of the subject. Additionally, a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in cells of a subject is limited or prevented by directly decreasing the level of phosphorylated RyR in cells of the subject or by indirectly decreasing the level of phosphorylated RyR in the cells (e.g., by targeting an enzyme (such as PKA) or another endogenous molecule that regulates or modulates the functions or levels of phosphorylated RyR in the cells). In one embodiment, the level of phosphorylated RyR hi the cells is decreased by at least 10% in the method of the present invention. In another embodiment, the level of phosphorylated RyR is decreased by at least 20%.<br>
[0207] The subject of the present invention are in vitro and in vivo systems, including, without limitation, isolated or cultured cells or tissues, non-cell in vitro assay systems and an animal (e.g., an amphibian, a bird, a fish, a mammal, a marsupial, a human, a domestic animal (such as a cat, dog, monkey, mouse or rat) or a commercial animal (such as a cow or pig)).<br>
[0208] The cells of a subject include striated muscle cells, A striated muscle is a muscle in which the repeating units (sarcomeres) of the contractile myofibrils are arranged in registry throughout the cell, resulting in transverse or oblique striations that are observed at the level of a light microscope. Examples of striated muscle cells include, without limitation, voluntary (skeletal) muscle cells and cardiac muscle cells. In one embodiment, the cell used in the method of the present invention is a human cardiac muscle cell. As used herein, the term "cardiac muscle cell" includes cardiac muscle fibers, such as those found in the myocardium of the heart. Cardiac muscle fibers are composed of chains of contiguous heart-muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, joined end to end at intercalated disks. These disks possess<br>
 <br>
two kinds of cell junctions: expanded desmosomes extending along their transverse portions, and gap junctions, the largest of which lie along their longitudinal portions.<br>
[0209] A decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP is limited or prevented in cells of a subject by administering the compounds of the invention to the subject; this would also permit contact between cells of the subject and the compounds of the invention. The compounds of the invention are modulators of calcium-ion channels. In addition to regulating Ca2+ levels in myocardial cells, the compounds of the invention modulate the Na current and the inward-rectifier K4 current in cells, such as guinea pig ventricular cells, and inhibits the delayed-rectifier K+ current in cells, such as guinea pig atrial cells.<br>

[0211] The pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention are prepared by methods well-known in the pharmaceutical arts. For example, the compounds of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, I-l or I-m, are brought into association with a carrier and/or diluent, as a suspension or solution. Optionally, one or more accessory ingredients (e.g., buffers, flavoring agents, surface active agents, and the like) also are added. The choice of<br>
 <br>
carrier is determined by the solubility and chemical nature of the compounds, chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.<br>
[0212] The compounds of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, 1-1 or I-m, are administered to a subject by contacting target cells (e.g., cardiac muscle cells) in vivo in the subject with the compounds. The compounds are contacted with (e.g., introduced into) cells of the subject using known techniques utilized for the introduction and administration of proteins, nucleic acids and other drugs. Examples of methods for contacting the cells with (i.e., treating the cells with) the compounds of the invention include, without limitation, absorption, electroporation, immersion, injection, introduction, liposome delivery, transfection, transfusion, vectors and other drug-delivery vehicles and methods. When the target cells are localized to a particular portion of a subject, it is desirable to introduce the compounds of the invention directly to the cells, by injection or by some other means (e.g., by introducing the compounds into the blood or another body fluid). The target cells are contained in tissue of a subject and are detected by standard detection methods readily determined from the known art, examples of which include, without limitation, immunological techniques (e.g., immunoliistochemical staining), fluorescence imaging techniques, and microscopic techniques.<br>

In one embodiment, the agent is adiminstered to the subject by way of delivery to the subject's muscles including, but not limited to, the subject's cardiac muscles. In an embodiment, the agent is administered to the subject by way of targeted delivery to cardiac muscle cells via a catheter inserted into the subject's heart.<br>

Such a formulation is prepared by dissolving a solid active ingredient hi water containing physiologically-compatible substances, such as sodium chloride, glycine and the like, and having a buffered pH compatible with physiological conditions, so as to produce an aqueous solution, then rendering said solution sterile. The formulation is presented in unit or multi-dose containers, such as sealed ampoules or vials.

[0216] For transdermal administration, the compounds of the invention are combined with skin penetration enhancers, such as propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, isopropanol., ethanol, oleic acid, 7V-methylpyrrolidone and the like, which increase the permeability of the skin to the compounds of the invention and permit the compounds to penetrate through the skin and into the bloodstream. The compound/enhancer compositions also may be further combined with a polymeric substance, such as ethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, ethylene/vinylacetate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and the like, to provide the composition in gel form, which are dissolved in a solvent, such as methylene chloride, evaporated to the desired viscosity and then applied to backing material to provide a patch.<br>
[0217] In some embodiments, the composition is in unit dose form such as a tablet, capsule or single-dose vial. Suitable unit doses, i.e., therapeutically effective amounts, can be determined during clinical trials designed appropriately for each of the conditions for which administration of a chosen compound is indicated and will, of course, vary depending on the desired clinical endpoint.

Uses<br>
[0219] The present invention provides a new range of therapeutic treatments for patients with various disorders involving modulation of the RyR receptors, particularly skeletal muscular disorders (RyRl), cardiac (RyR2) disorders, and cognitive (RyR3) disorders.<br>
[0220] hi one embodiment of the present invention, the subject has not yet developed a disorder, such as cardiac disorders (e.g., exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia). In another embodiment of the present invention, the subject is in need of treatment for a disorder, including a cardiac disorder.<br>
[0221] Various disorders that the compounds of the invention treat or prevent include, but are not limited to, cardiac disorders and diseases, skeletal muscular disorders and diseases, cognitive disorders and diseases, malignant hyperthermia, diabetes, and sudden infant death<br>
 <br>
syndrome. Cardiac disorder and diseases include, but are not limited to, irregular heartbeat disorders and diseases; exercise-induced irregular heartbeat disorders and diseases; sudden cardiac death; exercise-induced sudden cardiac death; congestive heart failure; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and high blood pressure. Irregular heartbeat disorders and diseases include and exercise-induced irregular heartbeat disorders and diseases include, but are not limited to, atrial and ventricular arrhythmia; atrial and ventricular fibrillation; atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmia; atrial and ventricular tachycardia; catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT); and exercise-induced variants thereof. Skeletal muscular disorder and diseases include, but are not limited to, skeletal muscle fatigue, exercise-induced skeletal muscle fatigue, muscular dystrophy, bladder disorders, and incontinence. Cognitive disorders and diseases include, but are not limited to, Alzheimer's Disease, forms of memory loss, and age-dependent memory loss.   One skilled in the art will recognize still other diseases, including but not limited to muscular and cardiac disorders, that the compounds of the invention can be useful to treat, in accordance with the information provided herein.<br>
[0222] The amount of compounds of the invention effective to limit or prevent a decrease in the level of RyR2-bound FKBP12.6 in the subject is an amount effective to prevent exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia in the subject. Cardiac arrhythmia is a disturbance of the electrical activity of the heart that manifests as an abnormality in heart rate or heart rhythm. As used herein, an amount of compounds of the invention "effective to prevent exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia" includes an amount of compounds of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-lc, 1-1 and I-in, effective to prevent the development of the clinical impairment or symptoms of the exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia (e.g., palpitations, fainting, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death). The amount of the compounds effective to prevent exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia in a subject will vary depending upon the particular factors of each case, including the type of exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia, the subject's weight, the severity of the subject's condition, and the mode of administration of the compounds. This amount is readily determined by the skilled artisan, based upon known procedures, including clinical trials, and methods disclosed herein, hi one embodiment, the amount of the compounds of the invention effective to prevent the exercise-induced cardiac aniiythmia is an amount effective to prevent exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in the subject, In another embodiment, the<br>
 <br>
compounds of the invention prevent exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia and exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in the subject.<br>
[0223] Because of its ability to stabilize RyR-bound FKBP and maintain and restore balance in the context of dynamic PKA phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of RyR, the compounds of the invention are also useful in treating a subject who has already experienced clinical symptoms of these various disorders. For example, if the symptoms of the disorder are observed in the subject early enough, the compounds of Formula 1,1-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, 1-1 and I-m, are effective in limiting or preventing a further decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in the subject.<br>
[0224] Additionally, the subject of the present invention is a candidate for exercise-induced cardiac disorders, such as exercise-induced cardiac arrhthmia. Exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia is a heart condition (e.g., a ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, including any that leads to sudden cardiac death) that develops during/after a subject has undergone physical exercise. A "candidate" for an exercise-induced cardiac disorder is a subject who is known to be, or is believed to be, or is suspected of being, at risk for developing a cardiac disorder during/after physical exercise. Examples of candidates for exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia include, without limitation, an animal/person known to have catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT); an animal/person suspected of having CPVT; and an animal/person who is known to be, or is believed to be, or is suspected of being at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmia during/after physical exercise, and who is about to exercise, is currently exercising or has just completed exercise. As discussed above, CPVT is an inherited disorder in individuals with structurally-nonnal hearts. It is characterized by stress-induced ventricular tachycardia - a lethal arrhythmia mat causes sudden cardiac death. In subjects with CPVT, physical exertion and/or stress induce bidirectional and/or polymorphic ventricular tachycardias that lead to sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the absence of detectable structural heart disease. Individuals with CPVT have ventricular arrhythmias when subjected to exercise, but do not develop arrhythmias at rest.<br>
[0225] Accordingly, in still another embodiment of the present invention, the subject has been exercising, or is currently exercising, and has developed an exercise-induced disorder. In this case, the amount of the compounds of the invention effective to limit or prevent a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in the subject is an amount of compound effective to treat the exercise-induced disorder in the subject. As used herein, an amount of compounds of the invention "effective to treat an exercise-induced disorder" includes an<br>
 <br>
amount of a compound of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, 1-1 or I-m, effective to alleviate or ameliorate the clinical impairment or symptoms of the exercise-induced disorder (e.g., in. the case of cardiac arrhythmia, palpitations, fainting, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden cardiac death). The amount of the compounds of the invention effective to treat an exercise-induced disorder in a subject will vary depending upon the particular factors of each case, including the type of exercise-induced disorder, the subject's weight, the severity of the subject's condition, and the mode of administration of the compounds. This amount is readily determined by the skilled artisan, based upon known procedures, including clinical trials, and methods disclosed herein. In one embodiment, the compounds of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, 1-1 and I-m, treat exercise-induced disorders in the subject.<br>
[0226] The present invention further provides a method for treating exercise-induced disorders in a subject. The method comprises administering the compounds of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, 1-1 or I-m, to the subject in an amount effective to treat the exercise-induced disorder in the subject. A suitable amount of the compounds effective to treat, for example, exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia in the subject ranges from about 5 mg/kg/day to about 20 mg/kg/day, and/or is an amount sufficient to achieve plasma levels ranging from about 300 ng/ml to about 1000 ng/ml. The present invention also provides a method for preventing an exercise-induced disorder in a subject. The method comprises administering the compounds of the invention to the subject in an amount effective to prevent the exercise-induced disorder in the subject. A suitable amount of the compounds of the invention effective to prevent the exercise-induced disorder in the subject ranges from about 5 mg/kg/day to about 20 mg/kg/day, and/or is an amount sufficient to achieve plasma levels ranging from about 300 ng/ml to about 1000 ng/ml. Additionally, the present invention provides a method for preventing exercise-induced disorders in a subject. The method comprises administering the compounds of the invention to the subject in an amount effective to prevent an exercise-induced disorder in the subject. A suitable amount of the compounds of the invention effective to prevent an exercise-induced disorder in the subject ranges from about 5 mg/kg/day to about 20 mg/kg/day, and/or is an amount sufficient to achieve plasma levels ranging from about 300 ng/ml to about 1000 ng/ml.<br>
[0227] Additionally, the compounds prevent irregular heartbeat disorders in subjects with heterozygous defects in the FKBP12.6 gene.<br>
 <br>
[0228] The compounds of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, 1-1 and I-m, can be used alone, in combination with each other, or in combination with other agents that have cardiovascular activity including, but not limited to, diuretics, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, antiarrhythmics, inotropic agents, chronotropic agents, a and p blockers, angiotensin inhibitors and vasodilators. Further, such combinations of the compounds of the present invention and other cardiovascular agents are administered separately or in conjunction. In addition, the administration of one element of the combination is prior to, concurrent to or subsequent to the administration of other agent(s).<br>
[0229] In various embodiments of the above-described methods, the exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia in the subject is associated with VT. In some embodiments, the VT is CPVT. In other embodiments of these methods, the subject is a candidate for exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia, including candidates for exercise-induced sudden cardiac death.<br>
[0230] In view of the foregoing methods, the present invention also provides use of the compounds of the invention in a method for limiting or preventing a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in a subject who is a candidate for a disorder. The present invention also provides use of the compounds of the invention in a method for treating or preventing a muscular disorder in a subject. Furthermore, the present invention provides use of the compounds of the invention in a method for preventing treating or preventing exercise-induced muscular disorders in a subject.<br>
[0231] Accordingly, the present invention further provides a method for assaying the effects of the compounds of the invention in preventing disorders and diseases associated with the RyR receptors. The method comprises the steps of: (a) obtaining or generating a culture of cells containing RyR; (b) contacting the cells with one or more of the compounds of the invention; (c) exposing the cells to one or more conditions known to increase phosphorylation of RyR in cells; and (d) determining if the one or more compounds of the invention limits or prevents a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in the cells. As used herein, a cell "containing RyR" is a cell in which RyR, including RyRl, RyR2, and RyR3, or a derivative or homologue thereof, is naturally expressed or naturally occurs. Conditions known to increase phosphorylation of RyR in cells include, without limitation, PICA.<br>
[0232] In the method of the present invention, cells are contacted with one or more of the compounds of the invention by any of the standard methods of effecting contact between drugs/agents and cells, including any modes of introduction and administration described<br>
 <br>
herein. The level of RyEL-bound FKBP in the cell is measured or detected by known procedures, including any of the methods, molecular procedures and assays known to one of skill in the art or described herein. In one embodiment of the present invention, the one or more compounds of the invention limits or prevents a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in the cells.<br>
[0233] RyR, including RyRl; RyR2, and RyR3, has been implicated in a number of biological events in cells. For example, it has been shown that RyR2 channels play an important role in EC coupling and contractility in cardiac muscle cells. Therefore, it is clear that preventive drugs designed to limit or prevent a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in cells, particularly RyR2-bound FOB 12.6 in cardiac muscle cells, are useful in the regulation of a number of RyR-associated biological events, including EC coupling and contractility. Thus, the one or more compounds of the invention are evaluated for effect on EC coupling and contractility in cells, particularly cardiac muscle cells, and therefore, usefulness for preventing exercise-induced sudden cardiac death.<br>
[0234] Accordingly, the method of the present invention further comprises the steps of contacting one or more compounds of the invention with a culture of cells containing RyR; and determining if the one or more compounds has an effect on an RyR-associated biological event in the cells. As used herein, a "RyR-associated biological event" includes a biochemical or physiological process in which RyR levels or activity have been implicated. As disclosed herein, examples of RyR-associated biological events include, without limitation, EC coupling and contractility in cardiac muscle cells. According to this method of the present invention, the one or more compounds are contacted with one or more cells (such as cardiac muscle cells) in vitro. For example, a culture of the cells is incubated with a preparation containing the one or more compounds of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, 1-1 or I-m. The compounds' effect on a RyR-associated biological event then is assessed by any biological assays or methods known in the art, including immunoblotting, single-channel recordings and any others disclosed herein.<br>
[0235] The present invention is further directed to one or more compounds of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c31-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, 1-1 or I-m, identified by the above-described identification method, as well as a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or diluen!. The compounds are useful for preventing exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in a subject, and for treating or preventing other RyR-associated conditions. As used herein, a "RyR-associated condition" is a<br>
 <br>
condition, disease, or disorder in which RyR level or activity has been implicated, and includes an RyR-associated biological event The RyR-associated condition is treated or prevented in the subject by administering to the subject an amount of the compound effective to treat or prevent the RyR-associated condition in the subject. This amount is readily determined by one skilled in the art. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for preventing exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in a subject, by administering the one or more compounds of the invention to the subject in an amount effective to prevent the exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in the subject.<br>
[0236] The present invention also provides an in vivo method for assaying the effectiveness of the compounds of the invention in preventing disorders and diseases associated with the RyR recpetors. The method comprises the steps of: (a) obtaining or generating an animal containing RyR; (b) administering one or more of the compounds of the invention to the animal; (c) exposing the animal to one or more conditions known to increase phosphorylation of RyR in cells; and (d) determining the extent the compound limits or prevents a decrease in the level of RyR-bound FKBP in the animal. The method further comprises the steps of: (e) administering one or more of the compounds of the invention to an animal containing RyR; and (f) determining the extent of the effect of the compound on a RyR-associated biological event in the animal. Also provided is a pharmaceutical composition comprising this compound; and a method for preventing exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in a subject, by administering this compound to the subject in an amount effective to prevent the exercise-induced sudden cardiac death in the subject.<br>
[0237] It has been demonstrated that compounds which block PKA activation would be expected to reduce the activation of the RyR channel, resulting in less release of calcium into the cell. Compounds that bind to the RyR channel at the FKBP binding site, but do not come off the channel when the channel is phosphorylated by PICA, would also be expected to decrease the activity of the channel in response to PKA activation or other triggers that activate the RyR channel. Such compounds would also result in less calcium release into the cell.<br>
[0238] By way of example, the diagnostic assays screen for the release of calcium into cells via the RyR channel, using calcium-sensitive fluorescent dyes (e.g., Fluo-3, Fura-2, and the like). Cells are loaded with the fluorescent dye of choice, then stimulated with RyR activators to determine the reduction of the calcium-dependent fluorescent signal (Brillantes, et al, Stabilization of calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor) function by FK506-<br>
 <br>
binding protein. Cell, 77:513-23,1994; Gillo, et al., Calcium entry during induced differentiation in murine erythroleukemia cells. Blood, 81:783-92,1993; Jayaraman, et al, Regulation of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor by tyrosine phosphorylation. Science, 272:1492-94, 1996). Calcium-dependent fluorescent: signals are monitored with a photomultiplier tube, and analyzed with appropriate software. This assay can easily be automated to screen the compounds of the invention using multi-well dishes.<br>
[0239] To demonstrate that the compounds of inhibit the PKA-dependent activation of RyR-mediated intracellular calcium release, an assay involves the expression of recombinant RyR channels in a heterologous expression system, such as Sf9, HEK293, or CHO cells. RyR could also be co-expressed with beta-adrenergic receptors. This would permit assessment of the effect of compounds of the invention on RyR activation, in response to addition of beta-adrenergic receptor agonists.<br>
[0240] The level of PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 which correlates with the degree of heart failure also is assayed and then used to determine the efficacy of the one or more compounds of the invention to block the PKA phosphorylation of the RyR2 channel. Such an assay is based on the use of antibodies that are specific for the RyR2 protein. For example, the RyR2-channel protein is immunoprecipitated and then back-phosphorylated with PKA and [gamma32P]-ATP. The amount of radioactive [32P] label that is transferred to the RyR2 protein then is measured using a phosphorimager (Marx, et al, PKA phosphorylation dissociates FKBP12.6 from the calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor): defective regulation in failing hearts. Cell, 101:365-76, 2000).<br>
[0241] Another assay of the compounds of the invention involves use of a phosphoepitope-specific antibody that detects RyRl that is PKA phosphorylated on Ser 2843 or RyR2 that is PKA phosphorylated on Ser 2809. Immunoblotting with such an antibody can be used to assess efficacy of these compounds for therapy for heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Additionally, RyR2 S2809A and RyR2 S2809D knock-in mice are used to assess efficacy of therapy for heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Such mice further provide evidence that PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 is a contributing factor in heart failure and cardiac^ arrhythmias by showing that the RyR2 S2809A mutation inhibits heart failure and arrhythmias, and that the RyR2 S2809D mutation worsens heart failure and arrhythmias.<br>
[0242] Therefore, in a specific embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating heart failure, atrial fibrillation or exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmia, comprising<br>
 <br>
administering to an animal in need thereof, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound selected from the compounds of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, 1-1 and I-m.<br>
[0243] Intracellular Ca2+ leak is proposed as a principal mediator of depressed muscle performance and dystrophic muscle remodeling. Muscular dystrophies are heterogeneous hereditary diseases characterized by weakness and progressive muscle wasting. Of all forms of muscular dystrophies involving the dystrophin-associated protein complex (referred to as dystrophinopathies), Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is one of the most frequent genetic diseases (X-linked; 1 in 3,500 boys) with death usually occurring before age 30 by respiratory and/or cardiac failure in high numbers of patients. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) represents a milder form of the disease associated with a reduction in the amount or expression of a truncated form of the dystrophin protein whereas Duchenne patients have been characterized by complete absence or very low levels of dystrophin. Duchenne and Becker's muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) are caused by mutations in the gene encoding the 427-kDa cytoskeletal protein dystrophin. However, with increasing age in BMD cardiac symptoms are more common than in DMD patients and do not correlate with skeletal muscle symptoms. Since genetic screening will not eliminative DMD due to a high incidence of sporadic cases, an effective therapy is highly desirable. DMD/BMD have been consistently associated with disturbed intracellular calcium metabolism. Because alterations of intracellTilar Ca2+ concentrations in DMD myofibers are believed to represent a central pathogenic mechanism, development of a therapeutic intervention that prevents intracellular Ca2+ abnormalities as a cause of skeletal muscle degeneration is highly desirable.<br>
[0244] It is well established that lack of dystrophin expression is the primary genetic defect in DMD and BMD. However, the key mechanism leading to progressive muscle damage is largely unknown. It has been suggested that elevations of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]j) under resting conditions directly contributed to toxic muscle cell (myofiber) damage and concurrent activation of Ca2+-dependent proteases. Since calpain activity is increased in necrotic muscle fibers of mdx mice and calpain dysfunction contributes to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, preventing activation of calcium-dependent proteases by inhibiting intracellular Ca~+ elevations represents a strategy to prevent muscle wasting in DMD. Significant differences in [Ca2+]; between normal and dystrophic muscles have been reported in myotubes and animal models including the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse. Intracellular<br>
 <br>
Ca2+ elevations are prevented by administration of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formula I, I-a, I-b, I-c, I-d, I-e, I-f, I-g, I-h, I-i, I-j, I-k, 1-1 or I-m.<br>

Efficacy Demonstrations<br>
[0342] As demonstrated by Figure 1, embodiments A, B, C, and D, S36 is more potent at increasing the binding of FKBP12.6 and RyR2 than JTV-519 and does not block the L-type Ca2+ channel (Ica.L) or HERG K+ channel (Ikr). In embodiment A, PICA phosphorylated<br>
 <br>
RyR2 is generated as follows: cardiac SR membrane preparations (5µl, 50 µg) are added to a total of 100µl of kinase buffer (8 mM MgCl2,10 mM EGTA, 50 mM Tris-PIPES, pH 6.8) containing 100 µM MgATP and 40 units of PICA, and incubated at room temperature. Samples are centrifuged at 95,000 g for 10 min and the pellets are washed three times in 0.2 ml imidazole buffer. The final pellets are pooled and resuspended in imidazole buffer (final concentration = 10µg /µ1). To test for the FKBP12.6 rebinding efficiency of JTV-519, PICA phosphorylated cardiac SR (50 mg) is incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with the test compounds and 250 nM FKBP12.6 in 10 mM imidizol buffer, pH 7.0, Samples then are centrifuged at 100,000 g for 10 minutes and pellets washed 3 times with imidizol buffer. After washing, proteins are size-fractionated on 15% PAGE. Immunoblots are developed using an anti-FICBP antibody (1:3,000 dilution). The amount of rebinding is quantified using densitometry of Western blots and is compared to the amount of FKBP associated with RyR in non-phosphorylated SR. EC5o's for the compounds are determined by generating FKBP binding data using concentrations of compounds ranging from 0.5-1000 nM. In embodiment B, currents through L-type Ca2+ channels in isolated mouse cardiomyocytes are recorded using whole-cell patch clamp recording conditions with Ba + as the charge carrier. The extracellular solution contains (in mM): N-methyl-D-glucamine, 125; BaCl2, 20; CsCl, 5; MgCl2, 1; HEPES, 10; glucose, 5; pH 7.4 (HC1). The intracellular solution contains (in mM): CsCl, 60; CaCl2, 1; EGTA, 11; MgCl2, 1; K2ATP, 5; HEPES, 10; aspartic acid, 50; pH 7.4 (CsOH). Under these conditions, it is expected that the measured current was carried by<br>
fjBa   primarily through L-type calcium channels which is referred to as Ica,L- Drugs are applied by a local solution changer and reach the cell membrane within 1 s. The effects of nifedipine and S36 are tested with 20 ms long voltage-clamp steps to +10 or +20 mV (peak of current-voltage relation for each individual cell) from holding potentials of-80 mV or -40 mV. In embodiment C, the voltage-dependence of L-type Ca2+ current blocked by JTV-519 (1 µM) and S36 (1µM) are measured and presented.<br>
[0343] As demonstrated by Figure 2, embodiments A, B, C, and D, S36 prevents exercise-induced sudden cardiac death at lower plasma levels compared with JTV-519. In embodiment A are shown representative ECGs of an untreated FKBP12.6+/-mouse and JTV519-treated FKBP12.6+/~ and FKBPU.6'" mice. Mice are treated with 0.5 mg JTV-519/per kilogram of body weight per hour for 7 days with an implanted osmotic mini-pump. JTV-519 has no effect on resting heart rate or other ECG parameters such as heart rate (HR). In embodiment B are shown sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia recorded by telemetry in an untreated FKBP12.6+/- mouse (upper tracing) subjected to exercise testing, immediately followed by injection with 0.5 mg epinepnrine per kilogram of body weight. Representative telemetry ECG recording of a JTV-519-treated FKBP 12.6+/- mouse following the same protocol is shown in the bottom tracing. In embodiment C are shown numbers of mice with cardiac death (left), sustained VTs (&gt;10 beats, middle), and nonsustained VTs (3 to 10 arrhythmogenic beats, right) in experimental groups of mice subjected to exercise testing and injection with 0.5 mg/kg epinephrine. In embodiment D, the dose-dependence of pharmacological effects of JTV-519 and S3 6 is shown. Plasma levels of 1 µM JTV519 prevent cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in FKBP12.6+/-mice. Plasma levels of 1 µM and 0.02 µM S36 also prevent cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in FKBP12.6+/-mice.<br>
[0344] As demonstrated by Figure 3, rycal prevents the development of acute heart failure post-myocardial infarction. Placebo-treated or rycal (100 nM or 200 nM plasma concentrations)-treated mice are subjected to permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery resulting in myocardial infarction. Rycal significantly improves fractional shortening assessed by M-mode echocardiography 2 weeks post-myocardial infarction, compared with placebo.<br>
[0345] As demonstrated by Figure 4, S3 6 improves cardiac function in chronic heart failure post-myocardial infarction. Wild-type mice are subjected to permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery resulting in myocardial infarction. Seven days following myocardial infartion, mice are treated with S36 (plasma concentration 200 nM) or placebo. Heart weight to body weight (HWXBW) ratios and pressure-volume loops quantifications (dP/dt, slope of the maximum derivative of change in systolic pressure over time) show reverse remodeling and improved cardiac contractility in S36-treated mice compared with placebo.<br>
[0346] Figure 5 is a summary graph of EC50 values of JTV-519 and compounds S1-S67 disclosed herein. The FKBP12.6 rebinding assay described above is used to determine the amount of FKBP12.6 binding to PKA-phosphorylated RyR2 at various concentrations (0.5 -1000 nM) of the compounds shown. EC50 values are calculated using Michaelis-Menten curve fitting.<br>
[0347] As demonstrated by Figure 6, embodiments A, B, and C, rycal normalizes CPVT-associated RyR2-P2328S channel function and structure. In embodiment A are shown<br>
  <br>
representative single-channel current traces of unphosphorylated RyR2-P2328S and PKA-phosphorylated RyR2-WT treated with rycal showing no influence of JTV-519 on baseline channel function. However, in PICA phosphorylated RyR2-P2328S, as shown in embodiment<br>
B, rycal normalizes the single channel closed state to levels approaching those seen in embodiment A, reducing the open probability from 14.4% to 0.3% following administration<br>
of 0.1 µmol/L rycal. Insets in embodiments A and B show channel openings &gt;1 pA at a higher resolution. Embodiment C shows immunoblot analysis of calstabin-2 binding of RyR2-<br>
in the presence or absence of PKA and 0.1 umol/L rycal, as indicated. RyR2-P2328S is<br>
is immunoprecipitated and in vitro PKA was phosphorylated as described above.<br>
[0348] As demonstrated by Figure 1, embodiments A and B, treatment with JTV-519 reduces PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 in mice with heart failure. Equivalent amounts of RyR2 are immunoprecipitated with an antibody against RyR2 (top blot). Representative immunoblots (embodiment A) and bar graphs (embodiment B) show the amount of PKA phosphorylated RyR2 at Ser-2S08 bound to RyR2 in wild-type and calstabin2(FKBP12.6)+/- mice. Treatment with JTV-519 (0.5 mg/kg/h) for 28 days post-myocardial infarction reduces PKA-phosphorylation of RyR2, presumably due to reverse cardiac remodeling, in wildtype but not calstabin-2 (FKBP12.6)+/- mice.<br>
[0349] As demonstrated by Figure 8, embodiments A and B, mice in which cardiac RyR2 cannot be PKA phosphorylated (RyR2-S2808 A knockin. mice) have improved cardiac function following myocardial infarction. Shown in embodiment A is the quantification of M-mode echocardiograms showing improved ejection fraction in RyR2-S2808A knockin mice compared with wildtype 28 days following permanent coronary artery ligation. Shown in embodiments B and C are pressure-volume loop quantifications showing (embodiment B) improved cardiac contractility and decreased cardiac dilation (embodiment C) in RyR2-S2808A knockin mice compared with wildtype following myocardial infarction.<br>
[0350] Figure 9, embodiments A, B, C, and D demonstrate the effect of JTV-519 on calstabin2 affinity to RyR2 in haploinsufficient calstabin2 (FKBP12.6)+/- mice after exercise. The average probability that RyR2 channels will be open in calstabin2+/- mice subjected to exercise were significantly increased compared to those of channels from exercised wild type (control; calstabin2+/+) mice, which are predominately closed under conditions that simulate diastole in the heart. As shown in embodiments C and D, treatment of exercised calstabin2+/-mice with JTV-519 significantly reduced the channel open probability (P0) compared with that of channels from exercised mice that were not treated, consistent with increased amounts of calstabin2 in the RyR2 channel complex. Therefore, JTV-519 increases the binding affinity of calstabin2 to RyR2. In contrast, JTV-519 treatmentof exercised Calstabin2"/~ deficient mice did not result in channels with a low P0, indicating that the presence of calstabin2 is necessary for JTV-519 effects which are documented as binding of calstabin2 to RyR2.<br>
[0351] Figure 10, embodiments A, B, C, D, E, and F demonstrate, respectively, normalized RyR2 channel gating and increased calstabin2 binding to RyR2 channels after treatment with JTV-519. The immunoblots in embodiments A and B show the amounts of RyR2 and calstabin2 associated with immunoprecipitated RyR2 after incubation with the indicated concentrations of JTV-519 for, respectively, wild-type RyR2 (RyR2-WT) channels and RyR2-S2809D. The binding curves in embodiment C demonstrate that JTV-519 significantly increases the affinity of calstabin2 for PKA-phosphorylated RyR2 channels. The results also show that depletion of calstabin2 from the RyR2 macromolecular complex which is associated with increased RyR2 open probability, ventricular tachycardias, and sudden cardiac death in haploinsufficient calstabrn2+/~ mice is reversed by treatment with JTV-519. Therefore, the JTV-519 and related compounds prevent disorders and conditions associated with the RyR2 receptors,<br>
[0352] As shown in Figure 11, embodiments A, B, C, D, and E RyRl channel functioning is increased and normalized in mdx (dystrophin deficient) mice treated with JTV-519. In Figure 11, channel openings are represented as upward deflections; 'c' indicates the closed state; and 4 pA current open amplitude is indicated by dash. Upper traces represent 5 sees and lower traces 500 ms; dotted lines indicate subconductance states.<br>
[0353] Embodiment A of Figure 11 shows a single channel current trace of RyRl from soleus muscle of control (wild-type) mouse under resting conditions (cytoplasmic Ca24 150 nM). As seen, RyRl is predominantly closed. Embodiment C of Figure 11 shows that RyRl channel function in mdx mouse shows significantly increased open probability, increased average open, and decreased average closed dwell times, To and Tc, respectively. Increased<br>
Po in mdx mice is consistent with intracellular Ca 2+  leak. The amplitude histograms in embodiments B, D, and F show multiple subconductance states consistent with calstabinl (FKBP12) depletion in RyRl from mdx soleus muscle. Embodiment E of Figure 11 shows an mdx mouse treated with 1.0 µM JTV-519. As seen, the RyRl channels JTV-519-treated mouse demonstrates normal activity that is not significantly different from untreated wild-<br>
 <br>
type trace, thereby indicating that JTV-519 can normalize RyRl channel function in mdx mice.<br>
[0354] The data of Figure 11 are consistent with intracellular SR Ca2+ leak via RyRl channels as the cause of increased cytosolic Ca2+ leak in skeletal muscles from mdx (dystrophin deficient) mice.<br>
[0355] Figure 12, embodiments A and B, demonstrate that mdx skeletal muscle has normal levels of RyRl PKA phosphorylation, but depleted levels of calstabinl. The imrnunoblots in embodiment A show that mdx type mice have depeleted levels of calstabinl compared to a control (wild-type) mouse. The summary bar graphs of embodiment B show that the mdx mouse, nevertheless, has an equivalent level of PKA-phosphorylation. Therefore, it is concluded that calstabinl depeletion is a defect that is consistent with the intracellular Ca2+ leak observed in skeletal muscle cells from mdx mice and myofibers from human mutation earners. Intracellular SR Ca2+ leak is likely to contribute to myofiber death and wasting of muscle mass by toxic intracellular Ca2+ overload and activation of proteases.<br>
[0356] Figure 13, embodiments A, B, and C, demonstrates that SR Ca2+ leak at the subcellular level in skeletal muscles of animals with heart failure is detectable. Life quality and prognosis in heart failure (HF) patients is severely decreased due to skeletal muscle dysfunction (e.g., shortness of breath due to diaphragmatic weakness, and exercise intolerance due to limb skeletal muscle fatigue) in addition to depressed cardiac function. Dysregulation of intracellular SR Ca2+ release is a pathogenic mechanism underlying skeletal muscle dysfunction in HF. HF in animals causes significantly accelerates intrinsic skeletal muscle fatigue.<br>

Embodiment C shows the relative distribution of the spatio-temporal properties of the Ca2+ sparks. Charts indicate 25, 50, 75 percentiles, the horizontal lines indicate the range from 1-99% of the distribution.

[0359] In summary, JTV-519 treatment improved skeletal muscle fatigability in heart failure animals in vivo. Interestingly, in calstabin2~l~ knockout mice, fatigue times were also significantly improved in JTV519 treated mice, suggesting that the beneficial effects on isolated skeletal muscle function depend on calstabinl and not calstabin2 binding to RyRl. Indeed, calstabinl appeal's to be the only isoform of functional significance expressed in skeletal muscles.<br>
[0360] Figure 15, embodiments A and B, demonstrates that in a mouse model of post-myocardial infarction heart failure, RyRl in soleus muscle is also PKA-hyperphosphorylated. Both in wild-type and calstabin2    mice, JTV-519 increased binding of calstabinl to RyRl in soleus muscle, suggesting that JTV-519 improves skeletal muscle fatigability by normalizing calstabinl rebinding to the channel complex. Equivalent amounts of RyRl were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against RyRl. Embodiment A provides bar graphs show the amount of PICA, phosphorylation of RyRl at Ser-2844 in mice (corresponding to human Ser-2843). The significant decrease of RyRl PICA phosphorylation in JTV519 treated wild-type animals is likely resulting from beneficial cardiac effects and secondary reduction of sympathetic nervous activity. Embodiment B are bar graphs showing the amount of calstabinl bound to RyRl from wild-type or calstabin2~'~ mice treated with JTV519 or placebo. Mice were treated with JTV519 by implantable osmotic minipumps using a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day. In summary, JTV-519 treatment resulted in a highly significant increase of calstabinl in the RyRl complex in soleus muscles in vivo.<br>
[0361] Figure 16, embodiments A, B, C, and D demonstrates that calstabinl rebinding to RyRl by JTV519 normalizes abnormal or leaky RyRl channel function in vivo. In embodiments A and C are shown RyRl single-channel tracings at 150 nM cytoplasmic Ca2+ representing resting conditions in skeletal muscle for wild-type mice treated with placebo and JTV-519. JTV-519 treatment of mice with heart failure and increased muscle fatigue normalized RyRl channel gating in skeletal muscle in vivo. Channel openings are upward, the dash indicates the full level of channel opening (4 pA), the dotted lines indicate<br>

For the amplitude histograms in embodiment B and D, amplitude is represented on the x axis, and events indicates the number of channel openings. Po, To and Tc values correspond to the representative traces. Treatment as indicated on top of traces. Inset shows higher resolution of open states.<br>
[0362] In summary, the data shows that in vivo JTV519 treatment normalizes skeletal muscle function and RyRl channel dysfunction consistent with preventing intracellular SR Ca24" leak as a cause of increased skeletal muscle fatigue.<br>
[0363] Figure 17 demonstrate that JTV-519 also increases the binding affinity of calstabinl for RyRl in. skeletal muscle in vivo. This probably explains why JTV519 treated mice with heart failure have increased levels of calstabinl bound to RyRl in soleus muscle. In embodiment A, equivalent amounts of skeletal RyRl or cardiac RyR2 were immunoprecipitated, PKA phosphorylated and incubated with calstabinl or calstabin2 at increasing concentrations of JTV519, respectively. Sediment represents only calstabin bound to RyR. Immunoblotting showed that &gt;50 nM of JTV519 increased the binding affinity of calstabin for RyR. The graphs of embodiment B further demonstrate that PKA phosphorylation of RyRl reduced the affinity of calstabinl for RyRl (open circles), whereas treatment with JTV519 (filled circles) restored the binding affinity of calstabinl for RyRl to that of non-PKA phosphorylated RyRl (open squares).<br>
[0364] Figure 18, embodiment A, B, C, and D demonstrates that Ser-2843 is the unique PKA phosphorylation site in skeletal RyRl channels. (A) Representative single channel traces of wild-type RyRl, (B) effect of exogenous PKA phosphorylation of RyRl (wt RyRl-P), (C) PKA does not affect RyRl-S2843A that contains a non-functional PKA phosphorylation site. Since PKA does not increase RyRl-S2843A activity, Ser-2843 appears to constitute the unique PICA phosphorylation site in RyRl channels in skeletal muscle. Accordingly, (D) constitutively phosphorylated RyRl-S2843D mimics exogenous PKA phosphorylation shown in (B) confirming that Ser-2843 is the unique PKA phosphorylation site in skeletal RyRl channels. RyRl single channel recordings in planar lipid bilayers show activity of the channels at 150 nM [Ca'!+]c,j (cytosolic side) with 1 mM ATP. Recordings were at 0 mV, closed state of the channels as indicated by 'c', and channel openings are upward deflections. All point amplitude histograms are shown on the right. Open probability (P0) and mean closed (Tc) and open (To) dwell times are indicated above each channel tracing.<br>
 <br>
[0365] Figure 19, embodiments A and B, demonstrates the depletion of stabilizing calstabinl and PICA hyperphosphorylation of RyRl channels from sustained exercise. Aerobic exercise can be defined as a form of physical exercise that increases the heart rate and enhances oxygen intake to improve performance. Examples of aerobic exercise are running, cycling, and swimming. During the study of Figure 19, mice were challenged by aerobic exercise (forced swimming) for 90 mins twice daily. The animals were accustomed to swimming in preliminary training sessions: day -3 twice 30 mins, day -2 twice 45 mins, day -1 twice 60 mins, day 0 and following twice 90 mins. Mice were then exercised for 1, 7, or 21 additional, consecutive days for 90 mins twice daily. Between swimming sessions separated by a 4 hour rest period the mice are kept warm and given food and water. An adjustable-current water pool was used to exercise mice by swimming. An acrylic pool (90 cm long x 45 cm wide x 45 cm deep) filled with water to a depth of 25 cm was used. A current in the pool was generated with a pump. The current speed during the swimming session was at a constant speed of 11/min flow rate. The water temperature was maintained at 34°C with an electric heater. Age- and weight-matched mice were used to exclude differences in buoyancy from body fat.<br>
[0366] Using forced swimming as an efficient protocol to increase skeletal muscle aerobic capacity in mice, the composition and phosphorylation status of the skeletal RyRl channel complex have been investigated. Unexpectedly, after 3 weeks of 90 mins swimming twice daily, C57B16 wild-type mice showed significantly increased RyRl phosphorylation by PICA<br>
<br>
while Ca2+  -calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylation was not changed indicating specificity of the stress pathway RyRl protein expression was stable, however, RyRl channels were depleted of the stabilizing subunit calstabinl (FKBP12). It has been shown that RyRl hyperphosphorylation and calstabinl depletion are consistent with leaky RyRl channels that cause intracellular SR Ca2+ leak.<br>
[0367] RyRl channels eire PICA hyperphosphorylated and depleted of the stabilizing calstabinl subunit after 3 weeks of 90 mins swimming twice daily. As seen in Embodiment A, the immunoprecipitated RyRl macromolecular channel complex shows increased PICA phosphorylation at Ser-2844 (corresponding to human RyRl-Ser-2843) whereas CaMKII phosphorylation at Ser-2849 (corresponding to human RyRl-Ser-2848) is unchanged. Concomitant with increased RyRl-Ser-2844 PICA hyperphosphorylation, calstabinl is depleted from the channel complex. As seen in embodiment B, normalization of phosphorylation and calstabinl content to four subunits of the tetrameric channel complex<br>
 <br>
shows a significant in increase in PKA phosphorylation and depletion of the stabilizing calstabinl subunit. Control, non-exercised mice; swim, mice exercised 90 mins twice daily for 3 weeks (preliminary data). P 
[0368] Figure 20, embodiments A and B, demonstrate that PKA phosphorylation increases for increasing durations of sustained exercise. To investigate the influence of the duration of sustained exercise on the RyRl Ca2+ release channel defect, mice were exposed to swimming for 1, 7, or 21 days followed by immediate sacrifice. Longer exposure to sustained exercise results in a significant increase of RyRl PKA hyperphosphorylation beginning at 7 days and saturating at 21 days.<br>
[0369] In Figure 20, embodiment A, the immunoprecipitated RyRl channel complex shows significantly and above physiologic levels increased PKA phosphorylation at Ser-2844 (corresponding to human. RyRl-Ser-2843) after 7 days of swimming exercise. In Figure 20, embodiment B5 inormalization of RyR2-Ser-2844 phosphorylation within the tetrameric channel complex documents a significant increase in PKA phosphorylation. *, P 
[0370] hi summary, the data of Figure 20 shows that sustained exercise results in significantly increased RyRl phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) which contributes to depletion of the stabilizing calstabinl subunit from the channel complex as the cause of a gain-of-function defect.<br>
[0371] Figure 21 provides data showing that showing mat chronically increased sympathetic stimulation of skeletal muscles, results in RyRl-dependent intracellular Ca2"1" leak and significantly increased muscle fatigue. What is the functional consequence of chronically increased RyRl PKA hyperphosphorylation? As shown in Figure 21 for mice and rats with heart failure from myocardial infarction, chronic RyRl PICA hyperphosphorylation results in increased muscle fatigue.<br>
[0372] hi embodiment A, it can be seen that heart failure skeletal muscle fatigues earlier than control. Rat soleus muscle (n =5 control, n = 8 HF) was mounted in a tissue bath to assess contractile function. Representative fatigue time tracing is shown for control and HF skeletal muscles. Bar graph shows mean (± S.D.) time to 40% fatigue. *, P 
 <br>
demonstrates the correlation between time to fatigue and RyRl PICA phosphorylation (r = 0.88) in rat skeletal muscle from sham and heart failure animals. Muscle function and RyRl PKA phosphorylation were assessed using contralateral soleus muscles from each animal.<br>
[0373] In summary, Figure 21 provides data showing that sustained exercise causes RyRl PKA hyperphosphorylation and calstabinl depletion, and Figure 21 shows that the identical defect occurs in disease forms with increased sympathetic activity causing intracellular SR Ca2+leak and significantly accelerated skeletal muscle fatigue.<br>
[0374] An additional problem during sustained exercise and stress is skeletal muscle degeneration further contributing to decreased skeletal muscle performance. To assess structural changes during sustained exercise, histologic changes in the fast-twitch muscles of mice exposed to 3 weeks of exercise by swimming have been characterized. Results are shown in Figure 22. Cross-sections of the mouse M. extensor digitorum longus (EDL) showed histologic changes consistent with myofiber degeneration from intracellular Ca overload from defective RyRl channels. Therefore sustained exercise for 90 mins twice daily triggers a dystrophic phenotype in EDL muscles of normal C57B16 mice.<br>
[0375]  Trichrome stain shows packed myofibers of similar cross-sectional dimension in non-exercised control (WT) mice (left). Three weeks swimming results in myofiber degeneration and interstitial collagen deposits with irregular fiber sizes. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) stain indicates nuclear changes and myofiber death.. These changes are consistent with dystrophic remodeling.<br>
[0376] The rapid delayed rectifier potassium channel (I(Kr)) is important for repolarization of the cardiac action potential. FJERG is the pore-forming subunit of the I(Kr) channel. Suppression of I(Kr) function, for example as a side-effect of a drug or the result of a mutation in hERG, can lead to long-QT (LQT) syndrome, which is associated with increased risk of life-threatening aiThythmias. The compounds of the present invention exhibit a lower level of hERG blocking activity than JTV-519, as demonstrated in Figures 23 - 43. Thus, the compounds of the present invention are expected to be less toxic and/or exhibit fewer side effects than JTV-519.<br>
[0377] Figures 23 to 26 illustrate the effect of the compound ARM036 (also referred to as S36) and ARM036-Na (a sodium salt of ARM036) on hERG currents.<br>
[0378] Figure 23 shows a typical hERG voltage-clamp current recording before (control) and after application of ARM036 at l00µM. The voltage pulse protocol used to activate the<br>
 <br>
hERG currents is illustrated below the current trace. It can be seen that, following activation by the conditioning prepiilse (to +20 mV), partial repolarization (-50 mV test pulse) of the membrane evoked a large, slowly decaying outward tail current. Application of ARM036 minimally reduced the outward tail current in a concentration- and time-dependent manner.<br>

High-throughput screening method<br>
[0403] In addition to the compounds disclosed herein, other compounds can be discovered that are capable of modulating calcium ion channel activity, in particular those channels related to the RyR series of cacliurn ion channels. Provided herein is a highly-efficient assay for high-throughput screening of other compounds that are capable of modulating calcium ion channel activity.<br>
[0404] By way of example, and as shown in Example 5 below, a highly-efficient assay for high-throughput screening for small molecules is developed by immobilizing FKBP, either FKBP12 or FKBP12.6 (e.g., wild-type FKBP12.6 or a fusion protein, such as GST-FKBP12.6) onto a 96-well plate coated with glutathione, using standard procedures. PKA-<br>
phosphorylated ryanodine receptor (RyR), specifically RyRl or RyR3 in the case of FKBP12 and RyR2 in the case of FKBP12.6, is loaded onto the FKBP-coated plate, and incubated with compounds at various concentrations (10-100 nM) for 30 min. Thereafter, the plate is washed to remove the unbound RyR, and then incubated with anti-RyR antibody (e.g., for 30 min). The plate is washed again to remove unbound anti-RyR antibody, and then treated with florescent-labeled secondary antibody. The plate is read by an automatic fluorescent plate reader for binding activity.<br>
|0405] Alternatively, RyR is PKA-phosphorylated in the presence of 32P-ATP. Radioactive PKA-phosphorylated RyR is loaded onto an FKBP-coated, 96-well plate, in the presence of JTV-519 analogues and other compounds at various concentrations (10-100 nM) for 30 min. The plate is washed to remove the unbound radiolabeled RyR, and then read by an automatic plate reader. PKA-phosphorylated RyR also is coated to the plate, and incubated with 32S-labeled FKBP in the presence of the compounds.<br>
[0406] The present invention is described in the following Examples, which are set forth to aid in the understanding of the invention and should not be construed to limit in any way the scope of the invention as defined in the claims which follow thereafter.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1 - RyR2 PKA PHOSPHORYLATION AND FKBP 12.6 BINDING<br>
[0407] Cardiac SR membranes are prepared, as previously described (Marx, et al, PKA phosphorylation dissociates FKBP 12.6 from the calcium release channel (lyanodine receptor): defective regulation in failing hearts. Cell, 101:365-76, 2000; Kaftan, et al., Effects of rapamycin on ryanodine receptor/Ca^-release channels from cardiac muscle. Circ. Res., 78:990-97, 1996). 35S-labelled FKBP12.6 was generated using the TNT™ Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system from Promega (Madison, WI). [3H] ryanodine binding is used to quantify RyR2 levels. 100 jag of microsomes are diluted in 100 ul of 10-mM imidazole buffer (pH 6.8), incubated with 250-nM (final concentration) [35S]-FKBP12.6 at 37°C for 60 min, then quenched with 500 ul of ice-cold imidazole buffer. Samples are centrifuged at 100,000 g for 10 min and washed three times in imidazole buffer. The amount of bound [35S]-FKBP12.6 is determined by liquid scintillation counting of the pellet.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 - MMUNOBLOTS<br>
[0408] Immunoblotting of microsomes (50 |ig) is performed as described, with anti-FKBP12/12.6 (1:1,000), anti-RyR-5029 (1:3,000) (Jayaraman, et al., FK506 binding protein associated with the calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor). J. Biol. Chem., 267:9474-77, 1992), or anti-phosprioRyR2-P2809 (1 :5,000) for 1 h at room temperature (Reiken, et al, Beta-blockers restore calcium release channel function and improve cardiac muscle performance in human heart failure. Circulation, 107:2459-66, 2003). The P2S09-phosphoepitope-specific anti-RyR2 antibody is an affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibody, custom-made by Zyrned Laboratories (San Francisco, CA) using the peptide, CRTRRI-(pS)-QTSQ, which corresponds to RyR2 PKA-phosphorylated at Ser2809. After incubation with HRP -labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000 dilution; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), the blots are developed using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ).<br>
EXAMPLE 3 - SINGLE-CHANNEL RECORDINGS<br>
[0409] Single-channel recordings of native RyR2 from mouse hearts, or recombinant RyR2, are acquired under voltage-clamp conditions at 0 mV, as previously described (Marx, et al, PKA phosphorylation dissociates FKBP12.6 from the calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor): defective regulation hi failing hearts. Cell, 101:365-76,2000). Symmetric solutions used for channel recordings are: trans compartment - HEPES, 250 rnmol/L; Ba(OH)2, 53 mmol/L (in some experiments, Ba(OH)2 is replaced by Ca(OH)2); pH 7.35; and cis compartment - HEPES, 250 mmol/L; Tris-base; 125 rnmol/L; EOT A, 1.0 mmol/L; and z, 0.5 mmol/L; pH 7.35. Unless otherwise indicated, single-channels recordings are<br>
made in the presence of 1 50-nM [Ca2+] and 1 ,0-mM [Mg2+] in the cis compartment. Ryanodine (5 rtiM) is applied to the cis compartment to confirm identity of all channels. Data is analyzed from digitized current recordings using Fetchan software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). All data is expressed as mean ± SE, The unpaired Student's t-testis used for statistical comparison of mean values between experiments. A value ofp

(Scheme Removed)<br>
[0419] Synthesis of S36 and S57 (Scheme 8): To a stirred solution of S26 (O.SSg, 4.4mmol) and pyridine (0.70g, 8.8mmol) in CH2Cl2 (50 ml) at 0°C is added drop-wise methyl chlorooxoacetate (0.8 lg, 6.6mmol). The reaction mixture is stirred at 0°C for 2 hours then washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate, IN HC1, and water. Silica gel column chromatography provides S57 as a white solid (l.lg, 90% yield). S57 (1 .lg, 3.9mmol) is dissolved inmethanol (10ml) and then a solution of sodium hydroxide (0.3g, 7.5mmol) in water (10ml) is added. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for one hour. After solvent is removed, the residue is dissolved in water (10 ml) and washed with ether (2x1 Oml). The aqueous phase is acidified with IN HC1 to pH=2. The product is extracted with CH2C12 (2x1 Oml). Removal of solvent yields product S36 as a white solid (l.Og, yield 100%). The product can be further purified by recrystalization. S38 is similarly synthesized (see Structure List).<br>
[0420] Synthesis of S43, S44, S45 and S59 (Scheme 8): S36 (150mg, 0.56mmol) is treated with thionyl chloride (5ml) at room temperature overnight. After removal of the excess thionyl chloride, the crude product S36-C1 is dissolved in CH2Cl2 (10ml) and, to this solution, mono-Boc protected cystamine and pyridine (0.2ml, 196mg, 2.48mmol) are added at 0°C. The reaction mixture is stirred at 0°C for one hour and at room temperature overnight and quenched with saturated sodium bicarbonate. The organic phase is separated and the solvent is removed to give intermediate S36-cystamine, which is purified by SiC&gt;2 column chromatography in 80% yield. Deprotection of the Boc-group is achieved with trifluoroacetic acid in CH2Cl2, and the deprotected S36-cystamine is used for the synthesis of S43 and S45 by reaction with NHS-activated ester of azido compounds. Yield is 75% for S43 and 80% for S45.<br>
 <br>
[0421] S44 is synthesized as a by-product of the following reaction: S36 (50rng, 0.19rnmol) is treated with thionyl chloride (2ml) at room temperature overnight. After removal of the excess of thionyl chloride, the crude product is dissolved in CH2Cl2 (5ml).

Each concentration was tested in at least three cells (n &gt; 3). 90 nM Cisapride (commercially available from TOCRIS Bioscience) was used as a positive control for hERG blockade. For recording, cells were transferred to the recording chamber and supervised with vehicle control solution. The patch pipette solution for whole cell recording contained 130 rnM potassium aspartate, 5 mM MgC12, 5 mM EGTA, 4 mM ATP and 10 mM HEPES. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. The pipette solution was prepared in batches, aliquoted, and stored frozen. A fresh aliquot was thawed and used each day. Patch pipettes were made from glass capillary tubing using a P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). A commercial patch clamp amplifier was used for whole cell recordings. Before digitization, current records were low-pass filtered at one-fifth of the sampling frequency.<br>
[0467] Onset and steady stae block of hERG current was measured using a pulse pattern with fixed amplitudes (conditioning prepulse: +20 mV for 2 seconds; test pulse: _50 mV for 2 seconds) repeated at 10 second intervals, from a holding potential of-80 mV. Peak tail current was measured during the 2 second step to _50 mV. A steady state was maintained for at least 30 seconds before applying the test compound or the positive control. Peak tail current was monitored until a new steady state was achieved. Test compound concentrations were applied cumulatively in ascending order without washout between applications.<br>
[0468] Data acquisition and analysis was performed using the suite of pCLAMP (Vre. 8.2) programs (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Steady state was defined by the limiting constant rate of change with time (linear time dependence). The steady state before and after application of the test or control compounds was used to calculate the percentage of current inhibited at each concentration. Concentratioon-response data were fit to an equation of the form:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
 [0469] where [Test] is the concentration of the test compound, IC50 (inhibitory concentration 50) is the concentration of the test compound producing half-maximal inhibition, N is the Hill coefficient, and % Block is the percentage of hERG current inhibited at each concentration of the test compound. Nonlinear squares fits were solved with, the Solver add-in for Excel 2000 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). For some compounds it was not possible to determine the ICso because the highest concentration of the test compound used did not block the hERG channel by 50% or more.<br>
 <br>
EXAMPLE 7 - EFFECT OF VARIOUS COMPOUNDS ON hERG CURRENTS<br>
[0470] Multiple compounds of the invention were tested for their effects on hERG currents. The compounds tested were: ARM036-Na ARM047, ARM04S, ARM050, ARM057, ARM064, ARM074, ARM075, ARM076, ARM077, ARM101, ARM102, ARM103, ARM104, ARM106, AEM107 and ARM26. Byway of comparison, the effect of JTV-519 (referred to in the figures as ARMOXX) on hERG currents was also tested. Electrophysiological recordings were made using the PatchXpress 7000A (Molecular Devices) automatic parallel patch clamp system. Each compound was tested at 0.01, 0.1, 1 and lOmM, with each concentration tested in 2 cells (n &gt; 2). The duration of exposure to each test concentration was 5 minutes. Other aspects of the experimental protocols were essentially similar to those described in Example 6. For some compounds it was not possible to determine the IC50 because the highest concentration of the test compound used did not block the hERG channel by 50% or more.<br>
