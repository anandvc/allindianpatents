				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The branched C3.6alkyl groups or unbranched Ci^alkyl groups can be further substituted with hydroxyl groups or cyano groups. Preferably, the alkyl groups are not further substituted.<br>
The invention also provides a process for preparing compounds of the formula (I). The invention's compounds of the formula (I) can be prepared in conventional processes under conventional conditions.<br>
In the process of the invention, compounds of the formula (II)<br><br>
which are known from the literature or synthesized as per Bull. Soc. Chim. France 1974, 641-648, are conventionally diazotized and coupled onto two equivalents of a compound of the formula (III)<br><br>
where the substituents are each as defined above. The diamine is cooled down to 0 -10°C or preferably to 0 - 5°C and diazotized by addition of nitrosylsulphuric acid. Thereafter, the diazotized amine is allowed to react with the compound (III), preferably in aqueous solution.<br>
The dyes of the formula (I) can be isolated from the reaction medium as per known processes, for example by salting out with an alkali metal salt, filtration and drying, if appropriate under reduced pressure at elevated temperature.<br>
Depending on the reaction and/or isolation conditions, the dyes of the formula (I) can be obtained as free acid, as salt or as mixed salt which contains for example one or more cations selected from alkali metal ions, for example the sodium ion, or an ammonium<br><br>
ion or alkylammonium cation, for example mono-, di- or trimethyl- or -ethylammonium cations. The dye can be converted by conventional techniques from the free acid into a salt or into a mixed salt or vice versa or from one salt form into another. If desired, the dyes can be further purified by diafiltration, in which case unwanted salts and synthesis by-products are separated from the crude anionic dye. In diafiltration, the crude dye is forced through a semipermeable membrane under an applied pressure to remove salts and synthesis by-products and partly remove water.<br>
The dyes of the formula (I) and their salts are particularly suitable for dyeing or printing fibrous material consisting of natural or synthetic polyamides in red to violet shades. The dyes of the formula (I) and their salts are suitable for producing InkJet printing inks and for using these InkJet printing inks to print fibrous material which consists of natural or synthetic polyamides or cellulose (paper for example).<br>
The invention accordingly provides from another aspect for the use of the dyes of the formula (I), their salts and mixtures for dyeing and/or printing fibrous materials consisting of natural or synthetic polyamides. A further aspect is the production of InkJet printing inks and their use for printing fibrous materials consisting of natural or synthetic polyamides.<br>
Dyeing is carried out as per known processes, see for example the dyeing processes described in Ullmanns Encyklopadie der technischen Chemie, 4th Edition, 1982, Volume 22, pages 658-673 or in the book by M. Peter and H.K. Rouette, Grundlagen der Textilveredlung, 13th Edition, 1989, pages 535-556 and 566-574. Preference is given to dyeing in the exhaust process at a temperature of 30 to 140°C, more preferably 80 to 120°C and most preferably at a temperature of 80 to 100°C, and at a liquor ratio in the range from 3:1 to 40:1.<br>
The substrate to be dyed can be present in the form of yarn, woven fabric, loop-formingly knitted fabric or carpet for example. Fully fashioned dyeings are even permanently possible on delicate substrates, examples being lambswool, cashmere,<br><br>
alpaca and mohair. The dyes of the invention are particularly useful for dyeing fine-denier fibres (microfibres).<br>
The dyes according to the present invention and their salts are highly compatible with known acid dyes. Accordingly, the dyes of the formula (I), their salts or mixtures can be used alone in a dyeing or printing process or else as a component in a combination shade dyeing or printing composition together with other acid dyes of the same class, i.e. with acid dyes possessing comparable dyeing properties, such as for example fastness properties and exhaustion rates from the dyebath onto the substrate. The dyes of the present invention can be used in particular together with certain other dyes having suitable chromophores. The ratio in which the dyes are present in a combination shade dyeing or printing composition is dictated by the hue to be obtained.<br>
The novel dyes of the formula (I), as stated above, are very useful for dyeing natural and synthetic polyamides, i.e. wool, silk and all nylon types, on each of which dyeings having a high fastness level, especially good light fastness and good wet fastnesses (washing, alkaline perspiration) are obtained. The dyes of the formula (I) and their salts have a high rate of exhaustion. The ability of the dyes of the formula (I) and their salt to build up is likewise very good. On-tone dyeings on the identified substrates are of outstanding quality. All dyeings moreover have a constant hue under artificial light. Furthermore, the fastness to decating and boiling is good.<br>
One decisive advantage of the novel dyes is that they are metal free and provide very level dyeings.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be used as an individual dye or else, owing to their good compatibility, as a combination element with other dyes of the same class having comparable dyeing properties, for example with regard to general fastnesses, exhaustion value, etc. The combination shade dyeings obtained have similar fastnesses to dyeings with the individual dye.<br><br>
The invention's dyes of the formula (I) can also be used as red components in trichromatic dyeing or printing. Trichromatic dyeing or printing can utilize all customary and known dyeing and printing processes, such as for example the continuous process, exhaustion process, foam dyeing process and Ink-Jet process.<br>
The composition of the individual dye components in the trichromatic dye mixture used in the process of the invention depends on the desired hue. A brown hue for example preferably utilizes 55 - 65% by weight of a yellow component, 20 - 30% by weight of the invention's red component and 10 - 20% by weight of a blue component.<br>
The yellow component, as described above, can consist of a single component or of a mixture of different red individual components conforming to the formula (I). Preference is given to double and triple combinations. When a red individual component consisting of just one red component of the formula (HI) is to be used, it should not account for more than 50% by weight of the trichromatic dye mixture.<br>
Particularly preferred blue and/or yellow components are described in WO2002/46318.<br>
In the examples which follow, parts and percentages are by weight and temperatures are reported in degrees Celsius.<br>
Preparation Example 1<br>
31.2 parts of the diamine of the structure<br><br>
are suspended at 50°C in 500 parts of 85% phosphoric acid and 200 parts of acetic acid. The suspension is cooled down to 0 - 5°C and diazotized by addition of 67 parts of 40% nitrosylsulphuric acid. Excess nitrite is destroyed with urea after one hour.<br><br>
61.2 parts of N-ethyl-N-benzylaminobeii2ene-34-sulphonic acid are dissolved in 500 parts of water and 30% caustic soda at pH 9. 300 parts of ice are added to cool down to 0°C before the diazo compound is metered in at not more than 5°C over an hour. The dye suspension obtained is heated to 70°C and filtered off.<br>
The residue is dissolved at 70°C in 1500 parts of water with caustic soda at pH 10. The dye is reprecipitated by addition of 50 parts of sodium chloride and 2000 parts of alcohol and filtered. It conforms to the structure<br><br>
and dyes polyamides and wool in a red hue with a high build-up capacity. The dyeings have excellent wet fastnesses and good light fastness.<br>
^max (dimethylformamide: water 1:1 (weight/weight) + 0.2 weight-% ammonium acetate): 536 nm<br>
The following dyes can be prepared similarly to Preparation Example 1 (The ^max were measured in a dimethylformamide with water in 1:1 ratio (weight/weight) + 0.2 weight-% ammonium acetate (dimethylformamide: water 1:1 w/w + 0.2 wt.-% ammonium acetate):<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
