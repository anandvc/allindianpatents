				<td>Process<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing 4-{4-[({[4-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)-<br>
phenyl]amino}carbonyl)amino]phenoxy}-A-methylpyridine-2-carboxaiTiide and its tosylate salt.<br>
The tosylate salt of 4-{4-[({[4-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]amino}carbonyl)aminoJphenoxy}-<br>
jV-methylpyridine-2-carboxamide is mentioned in WO 03/068228 and WO 03/047579 and corresponds<br>
to the compound of the formula (1):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
WO 03/068228 relates, inter alia, to the use of the compound of the formula (1) for treating disorders<br>
in which angiogenesis plays an important role, for example in tumor growth. WO 03/047579<br>
relates to arylureas in combination with cytotoxic or cytostatic compounds for treating cancer.<br>
The compound 4-!4-[({[4-Chlor-3-(trifluormethyl)phenyl]amino}carbonyl)amino]phenoxy}--Nmethylpyridine-<br>
2-carboxamide is described in WO 00/42012 and corresponds to the compound of<br>
the formula (II):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The compounds disclosed in WO 00/42012 and salts thereof, for example tosylates, are described<br>
there as inhibitors of the enzyme Raf kinase and can be used to treat disorders, for example cancer.<br>
Both WO 00/42012 and Bankston et al. (Organic Process Research &amp; Development, 2002, 6, 777-<br>
781) describe a process for preparing compound (11), which is illustrated in the following scheme:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In the first step, picolinic acid is used, by reacting in thionyl chloride with addition of dimethylformamide,<br>
to prepare (he acid chloride salt of the formula (HI). In a second stage, this is reacted<br>
with methylamine to give the methylamide of the formula (IV), the methylamine being used dissolved<br>
in tetrahydrofuran. The subsequent reaction in dimethylformamide with 4-aminophenol<br>
with addition of potassium tert-butoxide and potassium carbonate affords the ether of the formula<br>
(V) which is isolated by extraction and converted by further reaction with 4-chloro-3-lrifluoromethylphenyl<br>
isocyanate in methylene chloride to the compound of the formula (II).<br>
While the process disclosed by the prior art is effective for preparing the compound of the formula<br>
(II), when preparing this compound on an industrial scale, followed by the preparation of the compound<br>
of formula (I), factors such as product yields and process efficiency, safety and economy are<br>
very significant as they are in any commercial process.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing the compound of the formula<br>
(11) and its tosylate salt on the industrial scale (kilogram to metric tonnes range) which satisfies<br>
the criteria which apply in production and especially in the preparation of Pharmaceuticals,<br>
and provides improvements in purity, environmental compatibility, industrial employability, safety<br>
aspects and volume yield. This object is achieved by the present invention.<br>
In the inventive preparation of the compound of the formula (I) a high solubility of the compound<br>
of the formula (11) and therefore high volume yield is achieved by addition of water and/or by precharging<br>
the reaction vessel with a definite amount of p-toluenesulfonic acid. Thus, pursuant to<br>
GMF production a clarifying filtration is enabled.<br>
In the inventive preparation of the compound of the formula (II) by reacting the compound of the<br>
formula (V) with 4-chloro-3-trifluoromethyIphenyl isocyanate, it is possible, for example, to dispense<br>
with the methylene chloride solvent and to shorten the reaction time.<br>
In the inventive preparation of the compound of the formula (V) by reacting the compound of the<br>
formula (IV) with 4-aminophenol, it is possible, compared to the prior art process, to avoid a technically<br>
costly and inconvenient extraction step, to distinctly increase the volume yield, to obtain<br>
the product with a higher purity by isolation and purification via its dihydrochloride salt and, if<br>
appropriate, to dispense with the use of dimethylformamide. Surprisingly, it is possible, compared<br>
to the prior art, also to dispense with the use of potassium carbonate.<br>
In the inventive preparation of the compound of the formula (IV) by reacting the compound of the<br>
formula (111) with rnethylamine, surprisingly it is possible to use an aqueous solution in spite of the<br>
presence of the acid cloride of formula (III). In addition compared to the prior art process, for example,<br>
the workup is simplified.<br>
In the inventive preparation of the compound of the formula (III) from 2-picolinic acid, it is possible,<br>
compared to the prior art process, to better control the course of the reaction and thus increase<br>
safety in this reaction, in particular on the industrial scale. Due to the addition of bromide compounds<br>
it is possible to dispense with the use of dimethylformamide in thionyl chloride which can<br>
form dimethylcarbamoyl chloride. It is possible likewise to dipense with an isolation of the corrosive<br>
product. The overall yield of the process according to the invention over three stages starting<br>
from 2-picolinic acid up to the compound of the formula (V) is increased compared to the prior art<br>
process.<br>
The present invention provides a process for preparing the compound of the formula (I) which<br>
comprises, in a first step, reacting the compound of the formula (V) with 4-chloro-3-trifluoromethylphenyl<br>
isocyanate in a nonchlorinated organic solvent, inert toward isocyanates, at a temperature<br>
above 15Â°C to give the compound of the formula (II) and, in a second step, admixing the<br>
compound of the formula (II) with p-toluenesulfonic acid.<br>
Preparation of the compound of the formula (I):<br>
The present invention comprises a process for preparing the compound of the formula (I) by<br>
reacting the compound of the formula (II) with p-toluenesulfonic acid, wherein the reaction is<br>
effected in a polar solvent at a reaction temperature of from 40Â°C up to the reflux temperature of<br>
the solvent used.<br>
The inventive preparation of the compound of the formula (I) is effected by reacting the compound<br>
of the formula (11) with p-toluenesulfonic acid in a polar solvent at a reaction temperature of, for<br>
example, from 40Â°C up to the reflux temperature of the solvent used, preferably at from 50Â°C up to<br>
the reflux temperature of the solvent used, more preferably at from 50Â°C to 90Â°C. In order to<br>
improve the solubility of the compound of the formula (II), if appropriate, to enable a clarifying<br>
filtration and to reduce the amount of solvent, so that the compound of the formula (II) is kept in<br>
solution, the compound of the formula (II) is first reacted with less than 1 mol, preferably with<br>
from 0.10 to 0.7 mol, more preferably with from 0.13 to 0.4 mol, of p-toluenesulfonic acid, based<br>
in each case on 1 mol of the compound of the formula (II). The preferred areas of the amount of<br>
firstly admixed p-toluenesulfonic acid can vary marginally dependent on the solvent used. If<br>
appropriate, water, preferably 12 to 14% water based on amount of organic solvent, can be<br>
admixed. Subsequently, the reaction mixture is brought to reaction temperature and is, if<br>
appropriate, filtered. Afterward, the remaining amount of the required amount of p-toluenesulfonic<br>
acid is added. Optionally, the reaction mixture is admixed with seed crystals of the compound of<br>
the formula (1) and cooled. The compound of the formula (I) is finally isolated by crystallization<br>
and filtration. If water was added to the reaction mixture, the yield of the compound of formula <br>
can be increased by removing water, for example by destination, and/or by addition of polar<br>
solvent. Thereafter the water content in the reaction mixture is equal or less than 5%. The<br>
compound of the formula (II) may, if appropriate, be used in the form of the crude product from<br>
the preceding stage or in the form of a solution or suspension, for example dissolved in ethyl<br>
acetate or tetrahydrofuran.<br>
In the inventive preparation of the compound of the formula (I) by admixing the compound of the<br>
formula (IJ) with p-toluenesulfonic acid, water is added to the reaction mixture and, if appropriate,<br>
a clarifying filtration is conducted.<br>
Particular preference is given to initially charging the compound of the formula (II) in a polar<br>
solvent and to adding the p-toluenesulfonic acid, if appropriate dissolved or suspended in a polar<br>
solvent.<br>
p-Toluenesulfonic acid may be used either in anhydrous form or in the form of hydrates.<br>
Preference is given to using p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate.<br>
The amount of p-toluenesulfonic acid required for the inventive preparation of the compound of<br>
the formula (I) is greater than or equal to 1 mol, preferably from 1 to 3 mol, more preferably from<br>
1 to 1.5 mol, based in each case on 1 mol of the compound of the formula (II). The concentration<br>
of the compound of the formula (II) in the reaction mixture is, for example, from 5 to 30,<br>
preferably from 5 to 15, percent by weight. The concentration of p-toluenesulfonic acid in the<br>
reaction mixture is, for example, from 1 to 15, preferably from 2 to 10, percent by weight.<br>
Suitable polar solvents in the inventive preparation of the compound of the formula (I) are, for<br>
example, organic solvents containing at-least one hydroxyl group, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate or<br>
mixtures of the solvents mentioned. Preferred solvents are methanol, ethanol, n-propanol,<br>
isopropanol, n-bulanol, sec-butanol, isobutanol, n-pentanol, glycerol, ethylene glycol, dioxane,<br>
dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate or mixtures of the solvents mentioned. Particular<br>
preference is given to ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, isopropanol, ethyl acetate or mixtures of the<br>
solvents mentioned.<br>
In order to increase the solubility of the reaction mixture and reduce the amount of solvent and<br>
thus increase the volume yield, surprisingly it is possible to add a definite amount of water to the<br>
solvent used. This is she more surprisingly because the compound of the formula (I) and the<br>
compound of the formula (II) are both poor soluble in water alone (each 
25Â°C). When water is added to the solvent, preference is given to attaining a solvent/water ratio of,<br>
for example, from 4:1 to 60:1, preferably from 6:1 to 55:1. However, the amount of water should<br>
not be so large that the crystallization of the compound of the formula (I) is prevented. Otherwise<br>
water can be removed, for example, by destination. Preferably the water content at crystallization<br>
is equal or less then 5%.<br>
Preparation of the compound of the formula (11):<br>
The present invention additionally comprises a process for preparing the compound of the formula<br>
(II) by reacting the compound of the formula (V) with 4-chloro-3-trifluoromethylphenyl isocyanate,<br>
wherein the reaction is effected in a nonchlorinated organic solvent, inert toward isocyanates.<br>
The inventive reaction of the compound of the formula (V) with the commercially available <br>
chloro-3-trifluoromethylphenyl isocyanate to give the compound of the formula (II) is effected at a<br>
temperature above 15Â°C and below 70Â°C, for example at a temperature of from 20Â°C to 60Â°C,<br>
preferably at from 25Â°C to 60Â°C, more preferably at from 30Â°C to 60Â°C. Preference is given to<br>
initially charging the compound of the formula (V) at a temperature of from 20Â°C to 60Â°C, more<br>
preferably at from 30Â°C to 50Â°C, in a suitable organic solvent, and to admixing with 4-chloro-3-<br>
trifluoromethylphenyl isocyanate, if appropriate dissolved or suspended in a suitable solvent, in<br>
such a way that the reaction temperature does not exceed 70Â°C, preferably 65Â°C, more preferably<br>
60Â°C. If appropriate, the crude product of the compound of the formula (II) is used in the following<br>
stage dissolved or suspended in a suitable solvent, preferably in tetrahydrofuran or ethyl acetate.<br>
The compound of the formula (II) is isolated preferably by crystallization from the reaction mixture,<br>
by cooling the reaction mixture, for example, to a temperature of from -10 to 40Â°C, preferably<br>
from 0 to 30Â°C, more preferably from 10 to 25Â°C.<br>
Suitable organic solvents in the reaction of the compound of the formula (V) with 4-chloro-3-<br>
trifluoromethylphenyl isocyanate to give the compound of the formula (II) are nonchlorinated or-<br>
ganic solvents which are inert toward isocyanates, preferably tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, dioxane,<br>
methyl tert-butyl ether, dimethoxyethane or mixtures of the solvents mentioned. Particular<br>
preference is given to ethyl acetate or tetrahydrofuran.<br>
4-Chloro-3-trifluoromethylphenyl isocyanate is used in an amount of from 0.9 to 5 mol, preferably<br>
from 1 to 3 mol, more preferably from 1 to 2 mol, based in each case on 1 mole of the compound of<br>
the formula (V). The concentration of 4-chloro-3-trifluoromethylphenyl isocyanate in the reaction<br>
mixture is from 5 to 30 percent by weight, preferably from 10 to 20 percent by weight, and the<br>
concentration of the compound of the formula (V) in the reaction mixture is from 5 to 30 percent<br>
by weight, preferably from 10 to 20 percent by weight.<br>
It is possible to use the compound of the formula (II) in solution in the following stage without any<br>
further work-up or isolation.<br>
Preparation of the compound of the formula (V):<br>
Variant A:<br>
The present invention likewise comprises a process for preparing the compound of the formula (V)<br>

of the formula (V) in the presence of a base in a suitable solvent at a temperature of from 25Â°C up<br>
to the reflux temperature of the solvent, preferably at from 60 to 110Â°C, within from 1 to 12 hours,<br>
preferably within from 1 to 7 hours, more preferably within from 1 to 4 hours. For example, it is<br>
cooled to from 0 to 30Â°C, preferably to from 5 to 25Â°C. In order to achieve a higher purity,<br>
compared to the prior art, of the compound of the formula (V), the acid salt of the compound of the<br>
formula (V) is first precipitated, isolated, dissolved again, admixed with a base, and then the<br>
compound of the formula (V) is isolated by crystallization.<br>
Particular preference is given to precipitating the acid salt of the compound of the formula (V) by<br>

by adding an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, and isolated by crystallizing the compound of<br>
the formula (V).<br>
In order to enable satisfactory crystallization of the acid salt of the compound of the formula (V),<br>
the weight ratio, after addition of tetrahydrofuran, between solvent used and tetrahydrofuran is<br>

percent by weight.<br>

Stage 1:<br>
4-Criloropyridine-2-carbonyl chloride hydrochloride<br>
Method la:<br>
2-Picolinic acid (60 kg, 487 mol) is suspended in chlorobenzene (85 kg) and heated to 70Â°C. Thionyl<br>
chloride (262.5 kg, 2206 mol) is added to such a degree that the gas evolution (mainly SC&gt;2 and<br>
HC1) can be controlled efficiently. After stirring at 70Â°C for 1 hour, gaseous hydrogen bromide (6<br>
kg, 74 mol) is passed into the reaction vessel over 1 h . The reaction mixture is then heated to 90Â°C<br>
and stirred for 13 h. After cooling to 30Â°C, excess thionyl chloride and the majority of the chlorobenzene<br>
are distilled off under reduced pressure (final vacuum 50 mbar at jacket temperature<br>
75Â°C). Toluene (120 kg) is added and the vacuum distillation is repeated (final vacuum 50 mbar at<br>
jacket temperature 75Â°C) in order to remove thionyl chloride still remaining and the majority of<br>
the toluene. Alter toluene has again been added (225 kg), the crude 4-chloropyridine-2-carbonyl<br>
chloride hydrochloride is used in the next stage as the toluene solution.<br>
Method Jl&gt;:<br>
2-Picolinic acid (60 kg, 487 mol) is suspended in chlorobenzene (85 kg) and thionyl bromide<br>
(5.1 kg, 25 mol) is added. After heating to 72Â°C, thionyl chloride (200 kg, 168 1 mol) is added<br>
to such a degree that the gas evolution (mainly SO2 and HC1) can be controlled efficiently. The<br>
reaction mixture is subsequently heated to 90Â°C and stirred for 13 h. After cooling to 20Â°C, excess<br>
thionyl chloride and the majority of the chlorobenzene are distilled off under reduced pressure<br>
(final vacuum 50 mbar at jacket temperature 75Â°C). Toluene (120 kg) is added and the vacuum<br>
distillation is repeated (final vacuum 50 mbar at jacket temperature 75Â°C), in order to remove thionyl<br>
chloride slill remaining and the majority of the toluene. After toluene has been added again<br>
(225 kg), the crude 4-chloropyridine-2-carbonyl chloride hydrochloride is used in the next stage as<br>
the toluene solution.<br>
Method Ic:<br>
2-Picolinic acid (28.3 kg, 230 mol) and sodium bromide (3.8 kg, 37 mol) are suspended in chlorobenzene<br>
(40 kg). After heating to 50Â°C, thionyl chloride (94.5 kg, 794 mol) is added to such a degree<br>
that the gas evolution (mainly SO2 and HC1) can be controlled efficiently. The reaction mixture<br>
is subsequently heated to 85Â°C and stirred for 19 h. After cooling to 20Â°C, excess thionyl<br>
chloride and the majority of the chlorobenzene are distilled off under reduced pressure (final vacuum<br>
50 mbar at jacket temperature 75Â°C). Toluene (62 kg) is added and the vacuum distillation is<br>
repeated (final vacuum 50 mbar at jacket temperature 75Â°C), in order to remove thionyl chloride<br>
still remaining and the majority of trie toluene. After toluene has been added again (80 kg), the<br>
crude 4-chloropyridine-2-carbonyl chloride hydrochloride is used in the next stage as the toluene<br>
solution.<br>
Stage 2:<br>
A reaction vessel is laden with methylamine as a 40% aqueous solution (117 kg, 1507 mol of methylamine).<br>
Water (97.5 kg) is added and the solution is cooled to -5Â°C. A solution of the crude 4-<br>
chloropyridine-2-carbonyl chloride hydrochloride (approx. 330 kg, including toluene, obtained<br>
from 60 kg of 2-picolinic acid by the process detailed in stage 1 / method la) in toluene is added to<br>
such a degree that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not exceed 30Â°C. After stirring<br>
further at 20Â°C, for 1 h, the insoluble constituents are filtered out of the reaction mixture. After the<br>
phases have been separated, the organic phase is washed with water (90 kg). For better phase separation,<br>
5 kg of sodium chloride are added. The majority of the toluene is distilled out of the organic<br>
phase under reduced pressure (final vacuum 40 mbar at jacket temperature 95Â°C). The crude 4-<br>
chloro-/V-methylpyridine-2-carboxamide is thus obtained as an orange- to dark brown-colored oil<br>
and is used in the next stage without further purification.<br>
The crude product may be purified via the hydrochloride salt and isolated:<br>
37% hydrochloric acid (354 g, 3.59 mol) is added with stirring to a solution of the crude 4-chloroyV-<br>
methylpyridine-2-carboxamide (500 g, 2.93 mol) in acetone (2 kg) to such a degree that the temperature<br>
of the reaction mixture does not exceed 40Â°C. After cooling to approx. 5Â°C, stirring is<br>
continued for I h. The product is filtered off, washed with acetone (580 g) and dried under reduced<br>

degree that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not exceed 25Â°C. After stirring further for<br>
I h, the precipitated product is filtered off and washed with tetrahydrofuran (300 kg). After the<br>
still-moist product has been dissolved in water (920 kg), the pH of the mixture is adjusted to from<br>
pH 3 to 3.5 at 20Â°C by adding 22.5% sodium hydroxide solution (70.7 kg, 398 mol). The mixture<br>
is seeded with the title compound (0.5 kg), and the addition of 22.5% sodium hydroxide solution<br>
(50 kg, 281 mol) is continued until a pH of from 6 to 7 has been attained. The suspension is stirred<br>
