DIFLUOROMETHANESULFONYLJ ANILIDE DERIVATIVES USEFUL AS HERBICIDES<br>
The present invention relates to novel difluoromethanesulfonamide derivatives, to process for their preparation and to their use as herbicides.<br>
It has been already known that certain sulfonamide derivatives show an action as herbicide (for example, WO 93/09099, WO 96/41799, Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 60562/1999 and Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 44546 £000).<br>
In developing a herbicide, a problem of controlling weeds which express resistance against existing herbicides, for example, SU resistant weeds (sulfonylurea resistant weeds) has been recently taken up as one of the important subjects.   The development of an herbicide, that can control these resistant weeds and other annual and perennial weeds at the same time with a single ingredient, has been requested.<br>
According to the invention there have been found the following compounds of formula (I)<br><br><br>
wherein<br>
X represents halogen,<br>
Y represents CH or N,<br>
R1 represents hydrogen, and<br>
R2 represents hydrogen or hydroxy, or<br>
R1 and R2 together with the carbon atom to which they are bonded may form<br>
C=0.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I), according to the invention, can be<br>
obtained by a process in which<br>
a)	compounds of the formula (II)<br><br><br>
wherein<br>
X, Y, R1 and R2 have the same definition as aforementioned, are reacted with difluoromethanesulfonyl chloride in the presence of inert solvents, and if appropriate, in the presence of an acid binding agent, or<br>

The above-mentioned active compounds are known herbicides described in "Pesticide Manual" published in 2000 by British Crop Protect Council.<br><br>
Further, when the active compounds of the formula (I), according to the present invention, are mixed with safeners, phytotoxicity is reduced by the mixing and a broader weed controlling spectrum is provided and the application as a selective herbicide can be broadened.<br>
As said safeners there can be mentioned, for example, the following compounds represented by generic names or development codes:<br>
AD-67, BAS-145138, benoxacor, cloquintocet-mexyl, cyometrinil, 2,4-D, DKA-24, dichlormid, dymron, fenclorim, fenchlorazole-ethyl, flurazole, fluxofenim, flurazole, isoxadifen-ethyl, mefenpyr-diethyl, MG-191, naphthalic anhydride, oxavetrinil, PPG-1292, R-29148, etc.<br>
The above-mentioned safeners are also described in "Pesticide Manual" published in 2000 by British Crop Protect Council.<br>
Moreover, it is possible to further mix the above-mentioned safeners to a mixed herbicide composition consisting of the compounds of the formula (I), according to the present, invention and an above-mentioned herbicide.   By the mixing phytotoxicity is reduced and a broader weed controlling spectrum is provided and the application as a selective herbicide can be broadened.<br>
Surprisingly, some of the mixed herbicide compositions consisting of a compound of the present invention and a known herbicide and/or safener can show synergistic effects.<br>
In case of using the active compounds of the formula (I) they can be directly used as such or used in formulation forms such as ready-to-use solutions, emulsifiable concentrates, tablets, suspensions, powders, pastes or granules, or<br><br>
used in use forms prepared by further dilution.   The active compounds of the present invention can be applied by means of, for example, watering, spraying, atomizing, granule application, etc.<br>
The active compounds of the formula (I) can be used at any stages before and after germination of plants.   They can be also mixed into the soil before sowing.<br>
The application amount of the active compounds of the formula (I) can be<br>
varied in a substantial range.   It is fundamentally different depending upon the	'<br>
properties of effects to be desired.   In case of using as herbicide, there can be mentioned application amounts in the range of, for example, about 0.0001 to about 4 kg, preferably about 0.01 to about 3 kg as active compound per hectare.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and cultivars, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and cultivars obtained by genetic engineering, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the cultivars which are in each case commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. Cultivars are to be understood as meaning plants having certain properties ("traits") and which have been obtained  by conventional  breeding, by mutagenesis or by<br><br>
recombinant DNAtechniques. They can be varieties, bio- or genotypes.<br>
Depending on the plant species or cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions which can be used according to the invention also in combination with other agrochemically active compounds, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering) which are preferably treated according to the invention include all plants which, in the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly advantageous useful properties ("traits") to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are a better<br><br>
defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against insects by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CrylllA, CrylllB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are also particularly emphasized are the increased defence of the plants to fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize, cotton, soya beans), KnockOut® (for example maize), StarLink®<br><br>
(for example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylurea, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to cultivars having these genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, which plants will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly advantageous manner with the compounds of the formula (I) or the active compound mixtures according to the invention where in addition to the effective control of the weeds, the above-mentioned synergistic effects with the transgenic plants or plant cultivators occur. The preferred ranges stated above for the active compounds or mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the compounds or mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>
Then further specific examples of the preparation and application of the compounds of the formula (I) according to present invention, will be shown by the following examples.   The present invention, however, should not be restricted only to them in any way.<br><br>
