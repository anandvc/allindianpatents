				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a concentrated liquid fungicidal<br>
composition comprising a fungicidally acceptable carrier and<br>
(a) at least one azole derivative of formula 1<br>
in which <br>
R1 and R2 each independently represent hydrogen atom or an<br>
optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl or alkadienyl group;<br>
R3 represents a halogen atom or an optionally substituted alkyl,<br>
alkenyl, alkynyl, alkadienyl, alkoxy or aryl group; and<br>
A represents a nitrogen atom or a CH group;<br>
or one of the salts or addition products thereof; which exists in<br>
dissolved form; and<br>
(b) one or more additional fungicidal active ingredients, which exist as a<br>
suspension of fine particles.<br>
The fungicidal compounds of formula 1 which are utilizable in the <br>
present invention are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,938,792. <br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,393,770 discloses concentrated fungicidal<br>
compositions comprising compounds of formula 1 and solubilizing agents<br>
and suggests the addition of different fungicidally active ingredients,<br>
including dithianon, fenpropimorph and chlorothalonil, to the tank mix of a<br>
compound of formula 1 to combat diseases caused by Erysiphe graminis<br>
fsp tritici.<br>
Until now, there have been no concentrated liquid co-formulations<br>
comprising a compound of formula 1 and a second fungicidally active<br>
ingredient. Heretofore, in the preparation of co-formulations comprising a<br>
compound of formula 1, a solubilizing agent and a second fungicidally<br>
active ingredient, a homogeneous or stable homogeneous formulation<br>
could not be obtained due to the interaction between the second active<br>
ingredient and the solubilizing agent. However, a combination of<br>
solubilized compound of formula 1 with finely dispersed particles of the<br>
second fungicidal active ingredient is essential to achieve the highest<br>
possible fungicidal activity of said preparation.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that a fungicidal composition which<br>
comprises a compound of formula 1, a second fungicidally active<br>
ingredient, a polar organic solvent, a solubilizing agent, and a dispersing<br>
agent, which has the capability to adsorb irreversibly on the surfaces of<br>
hydrophobic particles suspended in water or polar organic solvents, forms<br>
a stable suspension of particles of the second fungicidally active ingredient<br>
in a solution of the compound of formula I in a liquid mixture of the other<br>
components. Further, it has been found that the physical states of the<br>
active ingredients are maintained even after these formulations are diluted<br>
in water, thus affording sprayable dilutions containing the solubilized<br>
compound of formula I and fine particles of the second active ingredient.<br>
Moreover, there is no suggestion in the prior art that such<br>
formulations can advantageously be used for controlling cereal diseases<br>
such as Septoria spp.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention concerns a concentrated liquid fungicidal<br>
composition comprising a fungicidally acceptable carrier and<br>
(a) at least one compound of formula I, or one of the salts or addition<br>
products thereof, which exists in solubilized form;<br>
(b) one or more additional fungicidally active ingredients, which exist as<br>
a suspension of fine particles;<br>
(c) a solubilizing agent; and<br>
(d) a dispersing agent, which has the capability to adsorb irreversibly on<br>
the surfaces of hydrophobic particles suspended in water or polar<br>
organic solvents.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is a concentrated fungicidal<br>
composition comprising a fungicidally acceptable carrier and/or surface<br>
active agent and synergistically effective amounts of<br>
(a) at least one azoLe derivative of formula 1 as defined above;<br>
(b) chlorothalonil or kresoxim-methyl and<br>
(c) a solubilizing agent.<br>
The present invention also includes a method for controlling<br>
phytopathogenic fungi which comprises the application of synergistically<br>
effective amounts of at least one compound of formula I and chlorothalonil<br>
or kresoxim-methyl in the presence of a solubilizing agent.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A composition according to the invention preferably contains from<br>
0.5 % to 95 %, preferably 15 % to 70 %, in particular 25 % to 50 %, by<br>
weight (w/w) of the active ingredients.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the liquid co-formulation<br>
of the present invention comprises<br>
0.5 to 10 %, preferably 1 to 7 %, by weight of an azole derivative<br>
of formula I;<br>
15 to 60 %, preferably 20 to 40 %, by weight of at least one<br>
second fungicidally active ingredient;<br>
10 to 50 %, preferably 15 to 35 % by weight of a solubilizing<br>
agent,<br>
0.1 to 5 %, preferably 0.2 to 2 %, by weight of one or more<br>
dispersing agents, one of which has the capability to adsorb<br>
irreversibly on the surfaces of hydrophobic particles<br>
suspended in water or polar organic solvents,<br>
0.1 to 5 %, preferably 0.5 to 2.5 %, by weight a foam breaking<br>
agent;<br>
5 to 30 %, preferably 7.5 to 25 %, by weight of a water miscible<br>
or partially water miscible organic solvent;<br>
0.01 to 0.5 % by weight of a preservative;<br>
0.05 to 1 %, in particular 0.1 to 0.6 %, by weight of a structuring<br>
agent; and<br>
- optionally, 5 to 40 %, in particular 10 to 35 %, by weight of<br>
water;<br>
and the sum of all ingredients in the composition is 100 %.<br>
Preferred azoles of formula I are those wherein<br>
A represents a nitrogen atom;<br>
R1 and R2 represent a C1-6 alkyl group, preferably a methyl group; and<br>
R3 is attached in the para-position and represents a fluoro or chloro atom<br>
or a C1-6 haloalkyl group.<br>
A particularly preferred compound for use in the present invention is<br>
metconazole, having the formula IA,<br><br>
which is described in The Pesticide Manual, 11th Edition, The British Crop<br>
Protection Council and The Royal Society of Chemistry, 1997, (hereinbelow<br>
abbreviated as "Pesticide Manual"), page 803.<br>
The compound of formula I, due to the basic nature of the azole ring,<br>
is capable of forming salts or addition products with inorganic or organic<br>
acids or metal ions. Examples of inorganic acids which form salts are the<br>
hydrohalides such as hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid<br>
and hydroiodic acid, and additionally, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and<br>
nitric acid. Suitable organic acids are those such as formic acid and<br>
alkanoic acids such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid<br>
and propionic acid, and additionally, glycolic acid, lactic acid, succinic acid,<br>
citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, oxalic acid, alkylsulfonic acids,<br>
arylsulfonic acids, alkylphosponic acids, arylphosphonic acids, in which<br>
the alkyl and aryl moieties are optionally substituted, as for example para-<br>
toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, para-phenoxybenzoic acid, 2-<br>
acetoxybenzoic acid or the like.<br>
The ions of the metals which represent soft Lewis acids suitable for<br>
forming addition products are preferably ions of chromium, manganese,<br>
iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, calcium, magnesium, aluminium,<br>
stannum and lead.<br>
However, the active ingredients of formula I and the second<br>
fungicidal active ingredient are preferably applied as such.<br>
The second fungicidal compound is, as a rule, a water immiscible<br>
organic, in particular, an aromatic solid compound, which has a melting<br>
point of at least 60 °C, preferably between 70 and 280 °C.<br>
The second fungicidal compound can be, for example, one which is<br>
capable of combating diseases of cereals (e.g., wheat and barley) such as<br>
those caused by Erysiphe, Puccinia, Septoria, Gibberella,<br>
Rhynchosporium and Helminthosporium spp., seed and soil borne<br>
diseases and downy and powdery mildews on vines, early and late blight<br>
on solanaceous crops and vegetables, powdery mildew and scab on<br>
apples and brassica diseases etc. These mixtures of fungicides provide a<br>
broader spectrum of activity than the compound of general formula I alone.<br>

Chlorothalonil is the common name of 2,4,5,6-tetrachloro-1,3-<br>
benzenedicarbonitrile of formula,<br><br>
which is described in "The Pesticide Manual", page 227.<br>
Kresoxim-methyl is the common name of methyl (E)-2-methoximino-<br>
[2-(tolyloxymethyl)phenyl]acetate of formula,<br>
which is described in "The Pesticide Manual", page 743.<br>
The in-tank mixtures of metconazole and chlorothalonil disclosed by<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,393,770 do not show synergistic effects.<br>
Surprisingly, a strong synergy between azoles of formula I and<br>
chlorothalonil in greenhouse trials is found when these compounds are<br>
co-formulated and when the activity of these co-formulations is compared<br>
with that of the commercial CARAMB® 60 g/l SL metconazole formulation<br>
and with the activity of a commercial DACONIL® 500 g/l SC chlorothalonil<br>
formulation. In addition, strong synergy between azoles of formula I and<br>
kresoxim-methyl in the presence of a solubilizing agent in greenhouse<br>
trials is found when these compounds are in-tank mixed and when the<br>
activity of these tank mix is compared with that of the commercial<br>
CARAMBA® 60 g/l SL metconazole formulation and with the activity of a<br>
commercial 500 g/kg WG kresoxim-methyl formulation. The solo<br>
compounds and the co-formulated materials are applied in curative trials<br>
to wheat powdery mildew and in protective trials to control wheat diseases<br>
in particular Septoria spp. All applications are carried on a per hectare<br>
basis with a track sprayer so to simulate practical conditions.<br>
A mixture of fungicides shows synergistic effect if the fungicidal<br>
activity of the mixture is larger than the sum of activities of the separately<br>
applied compounds (See Colby, S.R., "Calculating synergistic and<br>
antagonistic response of herbicide combinations", Weeds 15, pp. 20-22<br>
(1967)).<br>
If the actual efficacy (E) exceeds the expected (calculated) one (EE),<br>
the mixture displays a synergistic effect.<br>
The compositions of the present invention comprise compounds of<br>
formula I and chlorothalonil applied together, in synergistically effective<br>
amounts. When so applied, they exhibit an extraordinary efficacy against a<br>
broad range of phytopathogenic fungi, in particular against fungi from the<br>
classes Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes, Phycomycetes and<br>
Deuteromycetes. They are systemic and may be applied as leaf or soil<br>
fungicide or in seed treatment.<br>
The mixture according to the invention may be preferably applied for<br>
controlling the following phytopathogenic fungal species of the genera:<br>
Alternaria, Ascochyta, Botrytis, Cercospora, Colletotrichum, Erysiphe<br>
(Blumeria), Elsinoe, Fusarium, Gibberella, Guignardia, Helminthosporium,<br>
Hemileia, Monilinia, Mycosphaerella, Nectria, Pythium, Phytophthora,<br>
Plasmopara, Podosphaera, Pseudocercosporella, Pseudoperonospora,<br>
Puccinia, Pyrenophora, Pyricularia, Rhizoctonia, Rhynchosporium,<br>
Sclerotinia, Sclerotium, Septoria, Sphaerotheca, Tilletia, Typhula, Uncinula,<br>
Uromyces, Ustilago, Venturia, Verticllium and others. The miixture<br>
according to the present invention is particularly suitable for the control of<br>
Septoria nodorum, Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici, Blumeria graminis f.sp.<br>
hordeï, Puccinia hordeï", Rhynchosporium secalis, Helminthosporium<br>
gramineum, Mycosphaerella pinodes, Botrytis cinera and Uromyces pisi.<br>
The application rate of the compound of formula I according to this<br>
invention is usually in the range of 1 to 500 grams of active ingredient per<br>
hectare (g a.i./ha), with rates between 15 to 200 g a.i./ha often achieving<br>
satisfactory control. The optimal rate for a specific application will depend<br>
on the crop(s) under cultivation and the predominant species of infesting<br>
fungus, and may be readily determined by established biological tests<br>
known to those skilled in the art.<br>
In general, the preferred application rate of the second fungicidal<br>
active ingredient according to this invention, in particular, chlorothalonil or<br>
kresoxim-methyl, is in the range of 20 to 5000 g a.i./ha, and preferably is 50<br>
to 1500 g a.i./ha.<br>
The optimal rate for the second fungicidal compound, in particular,<br>
chlorothalonil, will, however, depend on the crop(s) under cultivation and<br>
the level of infestation by the fungus, and can readily be determined by<br>
established biological tests.<br>
The ratio (by weight) of the compound of formula I to the second<br>
fungicidal compound, for instance, metconazole to chlorothalonil or<br>
kresoxim-methyl, is as a rule, from 1:200 to 2:1. The preferred ratio of<br>
metconazole:chlorothalonil or metconazole:kresoxim-methyl may vary, e.g.,<br>
from about 1:100 to about 1:1, in particular from about 1:20 to about 1:5.<br>
Typically, this results in the liquid formulation containing from about 0.5 to<br>
10% by weight of the compound of formula I and 15-60% by weight of the<br>
second fungicidally active compound.<br>
The active compounds will be formulated together in a suitable ratio<br>
according to the present invention, together with usual carriers. The<br>
fungicidally acceptable carriers are liquid carriers, preferably water<br>
miscible or partially water miscible organic solvents or a mixture thereof<br>
with water. Mixtures of water miscible solvents and water are preferred. In a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention, the weight ratio of the water<br>
miscible solvent to water is in the range of from 1 : 5 to 5:1, preferably from<br>
1:2 to 2:1, in particular from 1:1.25 to 1.25 to 1.<br>
The water-miscible or partially water-miscible organic solvents<br>
utilized in the compositions of the present invention may be alcohols and<br>
glycols as well as their ethers and esters, e.g. ethanol, propanol, butanol,<br>
pentanol, benzylalcohol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, ketones such as<br>
methylethylketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, preferably N-<br>
alkyl pyrrolidones such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N-n-octyl-2-pyrrolidone<br>
or N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone, or lactones such as ?-butyrolactone and, in<br>
particular, propylene glycol. Mixtures of different water-miscible or partially<br>
water-miscible organic solvents are often suitable.<br>
The solubilizing agent utilized in the present invention is preferably a<br>
surfactant that is an alkoxylate of aliphatic alcohols. A preferred alkoxylate<br>
of an aliphatic alcohol is based on alkoxy units having 2 carbon atoms,<br>
thus being an ethoxylate or 2 and 3 carbon atoms, thus being a mixed<br>
ethoxylate/propoxylate. In a preferred aliphatic alcohol alkoxylate, the<br>
alkoxylate chain may have at least 5 alkoxy moieties, suitably from 5 to 25<br>
alkoxy moities, preferably 5 to 15, and, most preferably, 5 to 9. The alcohol<br>
moiety is, as a rule, derived from a C9-18 aliphatic alcohol. Preferred<br>
alcohols are at least 50 % by weight primary and at least 50 % by weight<br>
straight chain alcohols and with at least 50 % by weight having one hydroxy<br>
group. Typically, the solubilizing agent is present in amounts of about 10-<br>
50% by weight of the formulation.<br>
Particularly preferred solubilizing agents are those such as<br>
NEODOL® (formerly DOBANOL®) alcohol ethoxylates available from Shell<br>
Chemical Co. Ltd. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
weight ratio of the solubilizing agent to the compound of formula I is in the<br>
range of from 5:1 to 20:1, preferably from 5:1 to 15:1.<br>
The dispersing agent, which has the capability to adsorb irreversibly<br>
on the surfaces of hydrophobic particles suspended in water or polar<br>
organic solvents, is preferably selected from the group of polymeric<br>
surfactants, preferably surface active acrylic graft copolymers (such as<br>
those sold under the tradename ATLOX®) or from the group of polymeric<br>
naphthalene sulfonates. Additional dispersing agents which can be<br>
utilized in the present invention are the commercially available salts of<br>
polyaryl alkoxylate phosphate esters, particularly the sodium, potassium<br>
and ammonium salts thereof, with preferred salts being the potassium<br>
salts sold under the tradename SOPROPHOR®)<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the weight ratio<br>
of the dispersing agent to the additional fungicidal active ingredient is in<br>
the range of from 1:50 to 1:300, preferably from 1:100 to 1:150. Typically,<br>
the dispersing agent is present in an amount of about 0.1 to 5% by weight<br>
of the composition.<br>
Preferred are the liquid formulations which comprise the following<br>
constituents:<br>
a water miscible organic solvent,<br>
- an azole derivative of formula I, in particular metconazole;<br>
at least one second fungicidally active ingredient; in particular<br>
chlorothalonil or kresoxim-methyl,<br>
a solubilizing agent, e.g., an alkoxylate of an aliphatic alcohol<br>
being an ethoxylate or a mixed ethoxylate/propoxylate<br>
composed of 5 to 25 alkoxy moieties, in particular NEODOL®<br>
alcohol ethoxylates, (commercially available from Shell<br>
Chemical Co. Ltd.); and<br>
one or more dispersing agents, which have the capability to<br>
adsorb irreversibly on the surfaces of hydrophobic particles<br>
suspended in water or polar organic solvents, preferably<br>
selected from the group of surface active acrylic graft<br>
copolymers, such as ATLOX® 4913 (commercially available<br>
from ICI Surfactants), and polymeric naphthalene sulfonates,<br>
such as SUPRAGIL® MNS 90 (commercially available from<br>
Rhodia, formerly Rhone-Poulenc);<br>
- a foam breaking agent, in particular a mixture of<br>
perfluoroalkyphosphonic acids and/or perfluoroalkylphosphinic<br>
acids, in particular, Defoamer® SF or Fluowett® PL 80,<br>
(commercially available from Clariant GmbH); and<br>
optionally water.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the mean<br>
particle size of the component (b), in particular, chlorothalonil, contained in<br>
the formulation is less than 3.0 µm, preferably 1.3 to 2.7 µm, in particular<br>
1.5 to 2.5 µm. Typically, such sizing is accomplished using conventional<br>
milling apparatus.<br>
The formulations of the present invention represent a stable<br>
suspension of particles of the second fungicidally active ingredient, in<br>
particular, chlorothalonil, in a solution of the compound of formula I, in<br>
particular, metconazole, in a liquid mixture of the other components. The<br>
sedimentation behavior of the formulations according to the present<br>
invention upon storage under practical condition is acceptable. The<br>
physical states of the active ingredients are maintained after these<br>
formulations are diluted in water, i.e., the resultant spray dilutions contain<br>
solubilized metconazole and fine particles of chlorothalonil without<br>
interfering phase separation. The combination of solubilized metconazole<br>
and finely dispersed particles of chlorothalonil is essential in order to<br>
achieve the highest possible fungicidal activity of said preparation.<br>
A method of preparing such a composition is also provided which<br>
comprises bringing a compound of formula I and a second fungicidal<br>
active ingredient, in particular, chlorothalonil, as defined above, into<br>
association with at least one carrier. It is also envisaged that different<br>
isomers or mixtures of isomers may have different levels or spectra of<br>
activity and thus compositions may comprise individual isomers or<br>
mixtures of isomers.<br>
The carrier in a composition according to the invention is any liquid<br>
material with which the active ingredient is formulated to facilitate<br>
application to the locus to be treated, which may, for example, be a plant,<br>
seed or soil, or to facilitate storage, transport or handling. The<br>
compositions may be manufactured into the liquid concentrates, by well-<br>
established procedures. These procedures include intensive mixing<br>
and/or milling of the active ingredients with other substances, such as<br>
solvents, surface active compounds (surfactants), and optionally solid<br>
and/or liquid auxiliaries and/or adjuvants. The form of application such as<br>
spraying, atomizing, dispersing or pouring may be chosen like the<br>
compositions according to the desired objectives and the given<br>
circumstances.<br>
Pesticidal compositions are often formulated and transported in a<br>
concentrated form which is subsequently diluted by the user before<br>
application. The presence of small amounts of a carrier which is a<br>
surfactant facilitates this process of dilution. Thus, preferably at least one<br>
compound of the carrier in a composition according to the invention is a<br>
surfactant. For example, the composition may contain at two or more<br>
carriers, at least one of which is a surfactant. Surfactants may be nonionic,<br>
anionic, cationic or zwitterionic substances with good dispersing,<br>
emulsifying and wetting properties depending on the nature of the<br>
compound according to general formula I to be formulated. Surfactants<br>
may also be mixtures of individual surfactants.<br>
The compositions of the invention may also contain other additives<br>
such as defoamers, preservatives, corrosion inhibitors, stabilizers,<br>
structuring agents, penetrants and stickers, and water or an organic liquid<br>
in which the active ingredient is substantially insoluble; certain organic<br>
solids or inorganic salts may be present dissolved in the formulation to<br>
assist in preventing sedimentation and crystalization or as antifreeze<br>
agents for water. Suitable preservatives include the antimicrobial sodium<br>
1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one, sold under the tradename Proxel®. Suitable<br>
structuring agents are clays, such as the attapalgite clays sold under the<br>
Attagel® tradename.<br>
The biological activity of the active ingredient can also be increased by<br>
including an adjuvant in the spray dilution. An adjuvant is defined here as a<br>
substance which can increase the biological activity of an active ingredient<br>
but is not itself significantly biologically active. The adjuvant can either be<br>
included in the formulation as a coformulant or carrier, or can be added to<br>
the spray tank together with the formulation containing the active ingredient.<br>
As a commodity the compositions may preferably be in a<br>
concentrated form whereas the end user generally employs diluted<br>
compositions. The compositions may be diluted to a concentration down to<br>
0.001% of active ingredient. The doses usually are in the range from 0.01<br>
to 10 kg a.i./ha.<br>
Examples of formulations according to the invention are:<br>
Formulation A is prepared by dissolving metconazole in propylene glycol<br>
and Neodol 91-6 (pre-mix I), mixing together the other ingredients with a<br>
high shear mixer (pre-mix II) and mixing together pre-mix I and pre-mix II.<br>
Formulation B is prepared by dissolving metconazole in propylene glycol<br>
and Neodol 91-6 (pre-mix I), mixing together the other ingredients with a<br>
high shear mixer, subsequently reducing the particle size of chlorothalonil<br>
by bead milling to a mean particle size of 1.5 - 2.5 µm (pre-mix II) and<br>
mixing together pre-mix I and pre-mix II.<br><br>
Formulation C is prepared according to the same procedure as<br>
Formulation A.<br>
The components of the formulations A, B and C are available from<br>
the following sources:<br>
1) available from ICI Surfactants<br>
2) available from Shell Chemical CO., Ltd.<br>
3) available from Rhodia<br>
4) available from Clariant GmbH<br>
5) available from Zeneca<br>
6) available from Engelhard Corp.<br>
The phase separation of the formulations A and B has been<br>
examined as follows:<br>
The formulation have been stored 8 weeks at different temperatures or at a<br>
temperature cycle between 0 and 35 °C (0/35), respectively. The<br>
supernatant liquid (s.I.) has been assessed visually, and reported as a<br>
volume percentage. The sediment (sed.) has been assessed by the<br>
careful introduction of a glass rod into the container and found to be<br>
moderate (mo) or in traces (tr) only. The results of this assessment is<br>
given in the following table I.<br><br>
As commodity the compositions according to the present invention<br>
are in a concentrated form whereas the end-user generally employs<br>
diluted compositions. The compositions may be diluted to a concentration<br>
of 0.001 % of active ingredients.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a method of increasing the yields<br>
of crops which are infected by diseases caused by fungi, preferably<br>
Ascomycete fungi, in particular Blumeria graminis, Botrytis cinerea and<br>
Mycosphaerella or Basidiomycote fungi, in particular Puccinia hordei and<br>
Uromyces pisi which comprises protecting the crop against diseases<br>
caused by these fungi or treating the infected plants or the medium in<br>
which they grow with an effective amount of a diluted fungicidal<br>
composition according to the invention, in particular comprising<br>
metconazole and chlorothalonil or kresoxim-methyl, in combination with a<br>
solubilizing agent.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the yields of barley which is protected<br>
against powdery mildew and/or rust and the yields of protein peas which<br>
are protected against leaf spot, grey mold and or rust can be increased<br>
with the aid of the method according to the present invention.<br>
The following examples illustrate specific embodiments of the<br>
present invention; however, the invention is not limited to the embodiments<br>
so illustrated, but includes the entire scope of the appended claims.<br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
Effect of CARAMBA® (60 g/l metconazole), DACONIL® (500 g/l<br>
chlorothalonil), and a metconazole/chlorothalonil 30/375 g/l SC co-<br>
formulations (Formulation C) against cereal diseases.<br>
Example 1<br>
Efficacy (% control in bold) of CARAMBA and DACONIL at various dose<br>
rates in comparison to rates of the metconazole/chlorothalonil co-<br>
formulation (Formulation C) against wheat Septoria nodorum in a 3 days<br>
residual test (sprayed with an even-spray-nozzle in a track sprayer 3 days<br>
before inoculation with the pathogen).<br>
Evaluation<br>
Evaluation was carried out by assessing the percentage of infected leaf<br>
area of each of the 4 replicates. The activity in % was calculated using the<br>
ABBOTT formula:<br>
The results are shown in Table II, in which the experimental efficacy is<br>
given in bold figures and the expected value is given in brackets in italic<br>
figures:<br>
Table II<br>
It is clear from the results that, against wheat Septoria nodorum, both the<br>
solo products were inactive at the tested dose rates whereas the co-<br>
formulation had efficacies of 29-71% control in the dose range tested<br>
which suggests strong synergy.<br>
Example 2<br>
Efficacy (% control in bold) of CARAMBA and DACONIL at various dose<br>
rates in comparison to rates of the co-formulated<br>
metconazole/chlorothalonil 30/375 g/l SC (Formulation C) against wheat<br>
powdery mildew in a 2 days curative test (sprayed with an even-spray-<br>
nozzle in a track sprayer 2 days after inoculating the crop with the<br>
pathogen).<br>
The results are shown in Table III, in which the experimental efficacy is<br>
given in bold figures and the expected value is given in brackets in italic<br>
figures:<br>
Table III<br>
Against wheat powdery mildew, chlorothalonil was inactive, and a higher<br>
dose of metconazole, e.g. 5.6 g ai/ha, was less active than a lower dose of<br>
co-formulated metconazole (3.8 g ai/ha) plus chlorothalonil (47 g ai/ha) -<br>
the combination had an efficacy of 95% disease control whereas the<br>
expected efficacy of the higher doses of the combination would have been<br>
less than 70% control. These results clearly indicate the synergy of the<br>
combinations.<br>
Example 3<br>
Leaf Spot and Grey Mold on Protein Peas<br>
Lingot® is a commercially available WG formulation comprising 50 % by<br>
weight of chlorothalonil and 16.7 % by weight of vinchlozolin and<br>
