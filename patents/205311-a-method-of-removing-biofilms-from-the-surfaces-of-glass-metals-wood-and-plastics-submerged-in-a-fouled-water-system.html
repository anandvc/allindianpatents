				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to the field of water treatment technologies and, more particularly, to a method of removing biofilms from surfaces subrnexged-in.a fouled water system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Biofoulinq has always.been problematic in industrial water systems, such as cooling towers, heat exchangers and air washers, because it can adversely affect heat transfer efficiency and fluid frictional resistance, thereby subsequently reducing production rates.  In addition, biofouling also plays an important role in microbiologically influenced corrosion.<br>
The presence of microorganisms in industrial waters cannot be totally eliminated, even with the excessive use of chemical biocides.  The most common way to control biofouling is through the application of toxic chemical biocides such as chlorine, bromine, isothiazolones, glutaraldehyde or other antimicrobials.  These biocides are added in an attempt to kill both planktonic and attached microorganisms.<br>
Some microorganisms attach to inert surfaces forming aggregates with a complex matrix consisting'of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS).  This consortium of attached microorganisms and the associated EPS is commonly referred to as a biofilm.  Biocides have difficulty penetrating biofilms and removing them from surfaces.  Although excessive biocide dosages may be able to control biofouling, the presence of biocides in effluent waters is usually environmentally unacceptable.<br>
Mechanical treatments including scrapers, sponge balls, or "pigs" are also commonly used to remove<br><br>
WO 00/48946	PCT/US00/01140<br>
biofilms.  Acids, chelants and dispersants are likewise considered to be effective in causing the detachment of deposited materials.  In addition, sidestream filtration devices, which continuously process 1-5% of the system water, have drawn increased interest lately.. Nevertheless, these approaches are, either too labor intensive and/or expensive.<br>
Dispersants are sometimes applied along with biocides to enhance antimicrobial efficacy in industrial waters.  The dispersants used in these applications will hereinafter be referred to as "biodispersants." . Most biodispersants currently available on the market; such as block copolymer or terpolymer, have high molecular weights ranging from 1,000 to 15,000,000.  These biodispersants attract fine foulant particles onto polymeric chains and form fluffy particles that are more readily detached from the fouled surfaces.  It is also believed that these surface active compounds can increase the diffusion of biocide into the biofilm, and subsequently cause biofilm detachment.<br>
To date, biodispersants have not been used effectively without supplementation with biocides.  As the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations and global concerns of biocide usage become more prevalent, high performance biodispersants having low toxicity are needed to control biofouling either with or without the addition of chemical biocides.<br>
Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a method of removing biofilms from surfaces submerged in water using a biodispersant which is effective both alone and with the use of a biocide.  It would also be desirable to utilize a biodispersant which is biodegradable and has a low toxicity.  It would furthermore be desirable to employ a biodispersant which<br>

/O 00/48946	PCT/US00/01140<br>
does not affect corrosion and scale inhibition programs used in industrial water treatment.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The method of the invention, calls for adding to a fouled water system an alkyl polyglycoside having the chemical formula:<br><br>
wherein R is a Ce-Cl6 alkyl chain and D? is from 0 to 3 carbohydrate units.<br>
This method efficiently and effectively removes biofilms from surfaces submerged in the fouled water system.  The method is also environmentally acceptable and economically appealing because the use of biocides can be minimized or eliminated, and the biodispersant utilized in the practice of the invention is biodegradable and has a low toxicity.  Moreover, the method does not affect corrosion and scale inhibitor programs used in industrial water treatment.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present: invention is directed to a method of removing biofilms from surfaces submerged in a fouled water system.  In accordance with this invention, an alkyl.polyglycoside (APG) having the chemical formula:<br>
3<br><br><br>
wherein R is a C?-C16 alkyl chain and the degree of polymerization (DP) is from 0 to 3 carbohydrate units, is added to the water system.  Preferably, the alkyl chain is linear and the DP is from about 1.1 to 1.5.<br>
Glucopon9 225 and Burco® NPS-225 <c c10 glucopon c16 and are commercially-available apg products which may be used in the practice of invention. glucopon8 available from henkel corporation ambler pa burco product is burlington chemical co. inc. nc it believed that other suppliers can also present></c>
It is preferred that the amount of APG which is added to the wate'r system be in the range of about 0.1 ppm to about 10 ppm based on active ingredient, with about 1 ppm to about 10 ppm being most preferred.  APG can be added to the water system by any conventional method, i.e., by slug, intermittently or continuously.<br>
A biocide may also optionally be added to the water system in accordance with the practice of this invention. The biocide may be added by any conventional method<br>
- 4-<br><br>
WO 00/48946	PCT/US00/01 140<br>
either   separately   or   in   combination   with   APG.     .-The biocides   which   may   be   used   in   the   practice   of   the   present invention   include   oxidizing   biocides   such   as   chlorine-based  biocides,   bromine-based  biocides,   peracetic   acid, hydrogen  peroxide   and   ozone;   and  non-oxidizing  biocides such   as   isothiazolone,   glutaraldehyde  and   quaternary amine   compounds.      The   amount  of  biocide   added   to   the water   system   is   dependent   upon   the   particular   water treatment   application   and   is   generally.known   to   those skilled  in   the  art.      However,   it  should  be   noted   that   the required  amount  of  biocide   is  minimized  when   used   in combination  with  APG.<br>
In  accordance   with  the  method  of  this   invention, biofilms   are   removed  from  all  types   of   submerged surfaces,   e.g.,   glass,   metals,   wood  and  plastics.<br>
The   method   of   the   present   invention   may   be   used   in an   industrial   water  system  or  a  recreational   water system.     The   types   of     industrial  water   systems   in  which APG   can  be   employed   include,_but are not limited to, cooling   water   systems,   air   wasners,   evaporative condensers,   pasteurizers,air scrubbers,   produce sanitizer   streams,    fire  protection  water   systems   and  heat exchanger   tubes.<br>
The   types   of   recreational  water   systems   in  which  APG can  be  utilized include,. but are not limited to, decorative   fountains   and   full-body  immersion   systems   such as   swimming  pools,    spas  and  hot   tubs.<br>
The  present   invention   takes  advantage  of   the detergency   and  dispersancy  of  APG   for  use   as   a biodxspersant.     It  was  surprisingly  found  that  when APG was   added   to  a   fouled  water   system,   biofilms   were effectively   removed   from  the   submerged   surfaces.      The   APG biodispersant   described   herein   exhibited   superior performance   as   compared   to   other   commercially-available<br>
- 5 -<br><br>
WO 00/48946	PCT/US00/01140<br>
biodispersants, and biofilm removal was achieved both with and without the addition of chemical biocides.  It should be noted that when APG is used- lower amounts of toxic biocides are needed to achieve the same level of control.  In addition, APG offers a low or non-toxic means to control biofouling and APG is biodegradable, thereby providing an environmentally-acceptable approach to water treatment.  Moreover, the use of APG does not affect corrosion and scale inhibitor programs used in industrial water treatment.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are intended to be<br>
illustrative of the present invention and to teach one of ordinary skill how to make and use the invention.  These examples are not intended to limit the invention or its protection in any way.<br>
The biofilms used in the following Examples were generated from a mixed microbial consortium isolated from a cooling water deposit.  The devices used to house the test bacterial biofilms were continuous flow stirred tank bioreactors.  Both laminar and turbulent, flow conditions were tested for product performance.  Synthetic cooling water [400 ppm Ca, 200 ppm Mg, 400 ppm M alkalinity (all based on CaCO3 ) ] was used as make-up for the bioreactors. Bacterial biofilms were grown on glass and stainless steel surfaces for 96 hours at room temperature in order to reach steady state conditions.  The thickness of the biofilms was approximately 500pm.<br>
The biofilms were then treated by continuously applying biodispersant for 24 hours in an attempt to remove the biofilms from the substrata.  The area densities of the bacterial biofilms were measured with a protein assay.  The biomass was expressed as ug protein per cm2.  The effectiveness of biofilm removal was<br>
- 6 -<br><br>
WO 00/48946	PCT/US00/0 11 40<br>
determined by biomass loss during the treatment period. Conventional plate counts on tryptone glucose extract (TGE} agar were also employed to measure the viability of the bacterial population.  The viable cell density of the biofilm bacteria was expressed as colony forming units (CFU) per cm2 biofilm.<br>
Example 1<br>
Several surfactants were tested in laboratory biofilm reactors to evaluate their biofilm removal activities.  Biomass removal activities of the biodispersants against  bacterial biofilms were measured after 2 4 hours of continuous treatment.  The APG tested was Glucopon® 425 (a mixture of C8, C10 and C12-16 , a nonionic surfactant.  NALCO® 7348, a nonionic ethylene oxide/propylene oxide (EO/PO) block copolymer, was also evaluated.  The anionic surfactants used in this example were diphenyl disulfonate (Dowfax® available from Dow Chemical Company of Midland, MI) , linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) and sodium octane sulfonate.  A commercial biofilm cleaning product sold under the name Ultra-Kleen (available from the Sterilex Corporation of Owing Mills, MD) was tested.  A cationic surfactant'; dimethyl amide polymer (DMAD), commercially sold by Buckman Laboratories, of Memphis, TN was also included in this example.  As shown below in Table 1, the biofilm removal for APG was significantly higher than for any of the other products tested.<br>
- 7 -<br><br><br>
Note that a zero value was assigned if the attached biomass or the viable bacteria levels increased in the bioreactor.  This phenomenon occurred if the biodispersant was ineffective.<br>
Example 2<br>
The effects of APG on corrosion rates were conducted with 4.5 ppm sodium tolyltriazole, 20 ppm 2-phosphonobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid (PBTC) and 18 ppm terpolymer of acrylic<br>
acid/acrylamide/sulfomethylacrylamide.  The test water chemistry and alkalinity were maintained at 360 ppm CaCl2, 200 ppm MgSO4 and 220 ppm NaHCO3-  The pH was maintained at 8.7 and the temperature was set at 55°C.  The APG concentration was 10 ppm.  The tests were run in duplicate for 40 hours, and the corrosion rates were determined by electrochemical parameters.  The addition of APG .did not adversely affect corrosion control, as indicated by the low corrosion rates shown below in Table 2.<br>
-8 -<br><br><br>
Example 3<br>
The effects of APG on scale formation were evaluated.  Scale formation was determined by a solubility stress test which was run at 50°C.  The scale inhibitors used in this study were 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid (HEDP) and 2-phosphonobutane-l,2, 4-tricarboxylic acid (PBTC) .<br>
The scale formation, indicated by the low percent recovery of soluble Ca2+ after two hours, was .slightly higher at 400 ppm CaCO3 or Ca2+/HCO3 with 10 ppm APG in the system.  APG did not affect scale formation when the calcium levels were raised to 600 ppm.  Overall, as shown in Table 3, there was no significant difference on the scale formation either with or without APG applied at 10 ppm.<br><br><br>
Example 4<br>
Synergism between APG and a stabilized bromine-based oxidizing biocide was determined with the calculation described by F.C. Kull, P.C. Eisman, H.D. Sylwestrowicz and R.L. Mayer, Applied Microbiology, vol. 9, pages 538-541, (1961) usinq the relationship:<br><br>
where:<br>
Qa = quantity of APG, acting alone, producing an endpoint.<br>
Qb = quantity of biocide, acting alone, producing an endpoint.<br>
QA - quantity of APG in mixture, producing an endpoint.<br>
QB = quantity of biocide in mixture, producing an endpoint.<br>
-10-<br><br>
WO 00/48946	PCT/US00//01140<br>
If the Synergy Index is  
- 1, it indicates additivity &gt; 1, it indicates antagonism<br>
Instead of using the conventional plate enumeration method, a bacterial luminescent test was employed to calculate the endpoints.  A decrease in light emission depends on toxicant concentration in the test and is used to calculate the relative toxicity unit (RLU) .  This test gives rapid and sensitive detection of toxicants compared to conventional minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays.  Table 4 lists the synergy indices of several combinations of APG and stabilized bromine-based biocide (STB) tested in the laboratory.  The concentrations expressed are mg/L for APG as active ingredient and mg/L as total chlorine for STB.  The results shown in Table 4 demonstrate that all the APG/STB combinations tested were synergistic.  It should be noted that APG by itself did not show significant toxicity to reduce bioluminescence readings.  However, when combined with the biocides, APG dramatically improved the antimicrobial activity.<br><br>
