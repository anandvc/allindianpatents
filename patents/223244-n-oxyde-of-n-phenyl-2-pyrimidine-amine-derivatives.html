In view of the close relationship between the novel compounds in free form and in the form of their salts, including those salts that can be used as intermediates, for example in the purification or identification of the novel compounds, hereinbefore and hereinafter any reference to the free compounds is to be understood as referring also to the corresponding salts, as appropriate and expedient.<br>
A compound of formula I or II possesses valuable pharmacological properties and may, for example, be used as an anti-tumour agent, as an agent to treat atherosclerosis, as an agent to treat restenosis, as an anti-leukemic agent for the prevention of transplantation-induced disorders, such as obliterative bronchiolitis, and/or for preventing the invasion of warm¬blooded animal cells by certain bacteria, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis.<br>
The phosphorylation of proteins has long been known as an essential step in the differentiation and division of cells. Phosphorylation is catalysed by protein kinases subdivided into serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases. The tyrosine kinases include PDGF (Platelet-derived Growth Factor) receptor tyrosine kinase.<br>
PDGF is a very commonly occurring growth factor, which plays an important role both in normal growth and also in pathological cell proliferation, such as is seen in carcinogenesis and in diseases of the smooth-muscle cells of blood vessels, for example in atherosclerosis and thrombosis.<br>
The inhibition of PDGF-stimulated receptor tyrosine kinase activity in vitro is measured in PDGF receptor immune complexes of A431 cells, as described by E. Andrejauskas-Buchdunger and U. Regenass in Cancer Research 52, 5353-5358 (1992). A compound of formula I or II inhibits PDGF-dependent acellular receptor phosphorylation. The inhibition of PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase is measured in a microtitre ELISA assay (cf Trinks et al., J. Med. Chem. 37, 1015-27 (1994).<br>
The inhibition of PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase makes a compound of formula I or II also suitable for the treatment of tumour diseases, such as gliomas, sarcomas, prostate tumours, and tumours of the colon, breast, and ovary.<br><br>
A compound of formula I or II also inhibits cellular processes involving the so-called stem-cell factor (SCF, also known as the c-Kit ligand or steel factor), such as SCF receptor (Kit) autophosphorylation and the SCF-stimulated activation of MAPK kinase (mitogen-activated protein kinase).<br>
In particular, a.compound of formula I or II inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of c-Kit. This can be shown in a tyrosine kinase inhibition assay using the cytopiasmatic kinase domain of c-Kit. The assay is performed as follows: The baculovirus donor vector pFbacGOl (GIBCO) is used to generate a recombinant baculovirus that expresses the amino acid region amino acids 544-976 of the cytoplasmic kinase domains of human c-Kit. The coding sequences for the cytoplasmic domain of c-Kit is amplified by PCR from a human uterus c-DNA library (Clontech). The amplified DNA fragment and the pFbacGOl vector are made compatible for ligation by digestion with BamH1 and EcoRI. Ligation of these DNA fragments results in the baculovirus donor plasmid c-Kit. The production of the viruses, the expression of proteins in Sf9 cells and the purification of the GST-fused proteins are performed as follows: Production of virus: Transfer vector (pFbacGOl-c-Kit) containing the c-Kit kinase domain is transfected into the DHIOBac cell line (GIBCO) and the transfected cells are plated on selective agar plates. Colonies without insertion of the fusion sequence into the viral genome (carried by the bacteria) are blue. Single white colonies are picked and viral DNA (bacmid) is isolated from the bacteria by standard plasmid purification procedures. Sf9 cells or Sf21 cells (American Type Culture Collection) are then transfected in 25 cm2 flasks with the viral DNA using Cellfectin reagent.<br>
Determination of small scale protein expression in Sf9 cells: Virus containing media is collected from the transfected cell culture and used for infection to increase its titre. Virus containing media obtained after two rounds of infection is used for large-scale protein expression. For large-scale protein expression 100 cm2 round tissue culture plates are seeded with 5 x 107 cells/plate and infected with 1 mL of virus-containing media (approx. 5 MOIs). After 3 days the cells are scraped off the plate and centrifuged at 500 rpm for 5 min. Cell pellets from 10-20, 100 cm2 plates, are resuspended in 50 mL of ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF). The cells are stirred on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at 5000 rpms for 20 min. Purification of GST-tagged protein: The centrifuged cell lysate is loaded onto a 2 mL glutathione-sepharose column (Pharmacia) and washed three times with 10 mL of 25 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 200 mM NaCI. The GST-tagged protein is eluted<br><br>
by 10 applications (1 mL each) of 25 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 10 mM reduced-glutathione, 100 mM NaCI, 1 mM DTT, 10 % Glycerol and stored at -70°C.<br>
Kinase assay. Tyrosine protein kinase assays with purified GST-c-Kit are carried out in a final volume of 30 fil_ containing 200-1800 ng of enzyme protein (depending on the specific activity), 20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.6, 3 mM MnCI2, 3 mM MgCI2,' 1 mM DTT, 10 uM Na3V04, 5 ug/mL poly(Glu.Tyr) 4:1, 1 % DMSO, 1.0 uM ATP and 0.1 ^Ci [y33 P] ATP. The activity is assayed in the presence or absence of inhibitors, by measuring the incorporation of 33P from [y33P] ATP into the poly(Glu.Tyr) 4:1 substrate. The assay (30 \A.) is carried out in 96-well plates at ambient temperature for 20 min under conditions described below and terminated by the addition of 20 (iL of 125 mM EDTA. Subsequently, 40 /J.L of the reaction mixture is transferred onto Immobilon-PVDF membrane (Miliipore, Bedford, MA, USA) previously soaked for 5 min with methanol, rinsed with water, then soaked for 5 min with 0.5 % H3P04 and mounted on vacuum manifold with disconnected vacuum source. After spotting all samples, vacuum is connected and each well rinsed with 200 fiL 0.5 % H3P04. Membranes are removed and washed 4 x on a shaker with 1.0 % H3P04 and once with ethanol. Membranes are counted after drying at ambient temperature, mounting in Packard TopCount 96-well frame, and addition of 10 ^L/well of Microscint TM (Packard). IC50 values are calculated by linear regression analysis of the percentage inhibition of each compound in duplicate, at four concentrations (usually 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 ,uM). One unit of protein kinase activity is defined as 1 nmole of 33P ATP transferred from [y33P] ATP to the substrate protein per minute per mg of protein at 37 °C.<br>
A compound of formula I or II inhibits also the autophosphorylation of SCF receptor (and c-Kit, a proto-oncogen). Inhibition of the autophosphorylation of the SCF receptor can be measured using e.g. M07e cells, a human promegakaryocytic leukaemia cell line which depends on SCF for proliferation. They are obtained from Grover Bagby, Oregon Health Sciences University, USA. The cells are cultivated in RPMI 1649 medium supplemented with 10 FBS and 2.5 ng/ml GC-CMF. GM-SCF and SCF are commercially available. Serum-deprived M07e cells are prepared and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C with the test substance before being stimulated with recombinant SCF for 10 min at 37 °C. Identical quantities of cell lysates are analysed by Western blot using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies (Buchdunger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci (USA) 92, 2558-62 (1995)). The immunodecorated proteins are detected by means of the ECL Western blotting system from Amersham (Amersham, UK).<br><br>
On the basis of the described properties, a compound of formula I or fl may be used not only .as a tumour-inhibiting substance, for example in small cell lung cancer, but also as an agent to treat non-malignant proliferative disorders, such as atherosclerosis, thrombosis, psoriasis, scleroderma, and fibrosis, as well as for the protection of stem cells, for example to combat the haemotoxic effect of chemotherapeutic agents, such as 5-fluoruracil, and in asthma. It may especially be used for the treatment of diseases which respond to an inhibition of the PDGF receptor kinase.<br>
In addition, a compound of formula I or II prevents the development of multidrug resistance in cancer therapy with other chemotherapeutic agents or abolishes a pre-existing resistance to other chemotherapeutic agents. Also regardless of the effect described hereinbefore, a compound of formula I or II may be used to advantage in combination with other antitumour agents, such as especially other c-Kit inhibitors and inhibitors of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) receptor or c-Src activity.<br>
Also Abl kinase, especially v-Abl kinase, is inhibited by a compound of formula I or II. The inhibition of v-Abl tyrosine kinase is determined by the methods of N. Lydon et a/., Oncogene Research 5, 161-173 (1990) and J. F. Geissier ef a/., Cancer Research 52, 4492-8 (1992). In those methods [Val5]-angiotensin II and [y -32P]-ATP are used as substrates.<br>
By analogy, a compound of formula I or II also inhibits Bcr-Abl kinase (see Nature Medicine 2, 561-566 (1996)) and is thus suitable for the treatment of Bcr-Abl-positive cancer and tumour diseases, such as leukaemias (especially chronic myeloid leukaemia and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, where especially apoptotic mechanisms of action are found), and also shows effects on the subgroup of leukaemic stem cells as well as potential for the purification of these cells in vitro after removal of said cells (for example, bone marrow removal) and reimplantation of the cells once they have been cleared of cancer cells (for example, reimplantation of purified bone marrow cells).<br>
Test for activity against c-Abl protein tyrosine kinase. The test is conducted as a filter binding assay as follows: The His-tagged kinase domain of c-Abl is cloned and expressed in the baculovirus/Sf9 system as described by Bhat era/., J. Biol. Chem. 272, 16170-5 (1997). A protein of 37 kD (c-Abl kinase) is purified by a two-step procedure over a cobalt metal chelate column followed by an anion exchange column with a yield of 1-2 mg/L of Sf9 cells.<br><br>
The purity of the c-Abl kinase is &gt;90% as judged by SDS-PAGE after Coomassie blue staining. The assay contains: c-Abl kinase (50 ng), 20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCI2, 10 pM Na3V04, 1 mM DTT and 0.06 uCi/assay [y33 Pj-ATP (5 uM ATP) using 30 pg/mL poly-Ala, Glu,Lys,Tyr-6:2:5:1 (Poly-AEKY, Sigma P1152) in the presence of 1% DMSO, total volume of 30 uL Reactions are terminated by adding 10 pL of 250 mM EDTA, and 30 pL of the reaction mixture is transferred onto Immobilon-PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) previously soaked for 5 min with methanol, rinsed with water, then soaked for 5 min with 0.5% H3PO4 and mounted on vacuum manifold with disconnected vacuum source. After spotting all samples, vacuum is connected and each well rinsed with 200 uL 0.5 % H3P04. Membranes are removed and washed on a shaker with 0.5% H3PO4 (4 times) and once with ethanol. Membranes are counted after drying at ambient temperature, mounting in Packard TopCount 96-well frame, and addition of 10 pL/well of Microscint TM (Packard).<br>
Test for activity against Bcr-Abl. The murine myeloid progenitor cell line 32Dcl3 transfected with the p210 Bcr-Abl expression vector pGDp210Bcr/Abl (32D-bcr/abl) was obtained from J. Griffin (Dana Faber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA). The cells express the fusion Bcr-Abl protein with a constitutively active Abl kinase and proliferate growth factor independent. The cells are expanded in RPMI 1640 (AMIMED), 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine (Gibco) (..complete medium"), and a working stock is prepared by freezing aliquots of 2 x 106 cells per vial in freezing medium (95% FCS, 5% DMSO (SIGMA)). After thawing, the cells are used during maximally 10-12 passages for the experiments.<br>
For cellular assays, compounds are dissolved in DMSO and diluted with complete medium to yield a starting concentration of 10 uM followed by preparation of serial 3-fold dilutions in complete medium. 200'000 32D-Bcr/Abl cells in 50 uL complete medium are seeded per well in 96 well round bottom tissue culture plates. 50 uL per well of serial 3-fold dilutions of the test compound are added to the cells in triplicates. Untreated cells are used as control. The compound is incubated together with the cells for 90 min at 37°C, 5% C02, followed by centrifugation of the tissue culture plates at 1300 rpm (Beckman GPR centrifuge) and removal of the supernatants by careful aspiration taking care not to remove any of the pelleted cells. The cell pellets are lysed by addition of 150 pL lysis buffer (50 mM Tris/HCI, pH 7.4, 150 mM sodium chloride, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% NP-40, 2 mM sodium ortho-vanadate, 1 mM PMSF, 50 pg/mL aprotinin and 80 pg/mL leupeptin) and either used immediately for the ELISA or stored frozen in the plates at -20°C until usage.<br><br>
Black ELISA plates (Packard HTRF-96 black plates) are precoated over night at 4°C with 50 ng/well of the rabbit polyclonal anti-abl-SH3 domain Ab 06-466 from Upstate in 50 uL PBS. After washing 3 times with 200 uL/well PBS containing 0.05% Tween20 (PBST) and 0.5% TopBlock (Juro), residual protein binding sites are blocked with 200 uL/well PBST, 3% TopBlock for 4 h at room temperature followed by incubation with 50 uL lysates of untreated or compound-treated cells (20 ug total protein per well) for 3-4 h at 4°C. After 3 washings, 50 uL/well anti-phosphotyrosine Ab PY20(AP) labeled with alkaline phosphatase (Zymed) diluted to 0.2 ug/mL in blocking buffer is added and incubated over night (4°C). For all incubation steps the plates are covered with plate sealers (Costar). Finally, the plates are washed another three times with washing buffer and once with deionized water before addition of 90 uL/well of the AP-substrate CDPStar RTU with Emerald II. The plates, now sealed with Packard TopSeal™-A plate sealers, are incubated for 45 min at room temperature in the dark and luminescence is quantified by measuring counts per second (CPS) with a Packard Top Count Microplate Scintillation Counter (Top Count). The difference between the ELISA-readout (CPS) obtained for with the lysates of the untreated 32D-Bcr/Abl cells and the readout for the assay-background (all components, but without cell lysate) is calculated and taken as 100% reflecting the constitutively phosphorylated Bcr-Abl protein present in these cells. The activity of the compound on the Bcr-Abl kinase activity is expressed as percent reduction of the Bcr-Abl phosphorylation. The values for the IC50 and IC90 are determined from the dose response curves by graphical extrapolation.<br>
Test for activity against mutant Bcr-Abl: The activity of compounds on the M351T mutant Bcr-Abl kinase activity is assessed as described above, except that 32Dcl3 cells transfected with mutant Bcr-Abl jn place of p210 Bcr-Abl are utilised.<br>
c-Raf-1 protein kinase assay: Recombinant c-Raf-1 protein is obtained by triple infection of Sf21 cells with GST-c-Raf-1 recombinant baculovirus together with v-Src and v-Ras recombinant baculoviruses that are required for active c-Raf-1 kinase production (Williams et a/., PNAS 1992; 89:2922-6). Active Ras (v-Ras) is required to recruit c-Raf-1 to the cell membrane and v-Src to phosphorylate c-Raf-1 to fully activate it. Cells are seeded at 2.5 x 107 cells per 150 mm dish and allowed to attach to a 150 mm dish for 1 hr at RT. Media (SF900II containing 10 % FBS) is aspirated and recombinant baculovirus GST-c-Raf-1, v-Ras and v-Src are added at MO I of 3.0, 2.5 and 2.5, respectively, in a total volume of 4-<br><br>
5 ml_. Cells are incubated for 1 hr at RT and then 15 mL of medium is added. Infected cells are incubated for 48-72 hr at 27"C. Infected Sf21 cells are scraped and collected into a 50 mL tube and centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C at 1100 g in a Sorvall centrifuge. The cell pellet is washed once with ice cold PBS and lysed with 0.6 mL lysis buffer per 2.5 x 107 cells. Complete lysis of cells is achieved after 10 min on ice with occasional pipetting. The cell lysates are centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C at 14,500 g in a Sorvall centrifuge with SS-34 rotor and the supernatant is transferred to a fresh tube and stored at -80°C. c-Raf-1 is purified from cell lysates using 100 uL of packed glutathione-sepharose 4B beads equilibrated in ice cold PBS per 2.5 x 107 cells. GST-c-Raf-1 is allowed to bind to the beads at 4°C for 1 hr with rocking. Bound GST-c-Raf-1 with beads is transferred to a column. The column is washed once with lysis buffer and twice with ice cold Tris buffered saline. Ice cold elution buffer is added and column flow is stopped to allow the free glutathione to disrupt the interaction of GST-c-Raf-1 with glutathione sepharose beads. Fractions (1 mL) are collected into pre-chilled tubes. Each tube contains 10 % glycerol (final concentration) to maintain kinase activity during freeze thaw cycles. Purified fractions of GST-c-Raf-1 kinase protein are stored at-80°C.<br>
IKB is used as substrate for the c-Raf-1 kinase. IKB is expressed in bacteria as a His-tagged protein BL21. LysS bacteria containing the IKB plasmid are grown to an OD600 of 0.6 in LB medium, then induced to express the IKB with IPTG (final concentration of 1 mM) for 3 hrs at 37°C and then bacteria are lysed by sonication (microtip limit setting for 3 times at 1 min each in sonication buffer [50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA] and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 min. The supernatant is mixed with ammonium sulfate to give a final concentration of 30 %. This mixture is rocked for 15 min at 4 C then spun at 10,000 g for 15 min. The pellet is resuspended in binding buffer (Novagen) containing 10 mM BSA. This solution is applied to Ni-agarose (Novagen) and washed according to the Novagen manual. IKB is eluted from the column using elution buffer (0.4 M imidazole, 0.2 M NaCI, 8 mM Tris pH 7.9). Fractions containing protein are dialysed in 50 mM Tris pH 8, 1 mM DTT. The activity of c-Raf-1 protein kinase is assayed in the presence or absence of inhibitors, by measuring the incorporation of 33P from [y33P] ATP into IKB. The assay is carried out in 96-well plates at ambient temperature for 60 min. It contains (total volume of 30 uL): c-Raf-1 kinase (400 ng), 25 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCI2, 5 mM MnCI2, 10 uM Na3V04, 1 mM DTT and 0.3 uCi/assay [y33 P]-ATP (10 uM ATP) using 600 ng IKB in the presence of 1 % DMSO. Reactions are terminated by adding 10 uL of 250 mM EDTA and 30 uL of the reaction mixture is transferred onto Immobilon-PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA,<br><br>
USA) previously soaked for 5 min with methanol, rinsed with water, then soaked for 5 min with 0.5 % H3PO4 and mounted on vacuum manifold with disconnected vacuum source. After spotting all samples, vacuum is connected and each well rinsed with 200 ul_ 0.5 % H3P04. Membranes are removed and washed 4 x on a shaker with 0.5 % H3P04, once with ethanol. Membranes are counted after drying at ambient temperature, mounting in Packard TopCount 96-well frame, and addition of 10 uL/well of Microscint TM (Packard).<br>
It has also been surprisingly discovered that our compounds of formula I or II have an unexpected potential to serve as hypoxia-selective products due to bio-reduction (deoxygenation) in the cell especially in the tumours and in the brain. Hypoxia-activated pro¬drugs are especially useful in cancer therapy since severe hypoxia occurs in solid tumour tissue or in the brain. Hypoxic cells can be exploited for therapy by non-toxic, hypoxia-activated pro-drugs. Thus because of the net reduction of the N-oxide moiety, there is an higher uptake of compounds of formula I or II in the tumours or in the brain and an accumulation of the reduced form of the compounds of formula I or II in the tumours or brain.<br>
Another advantage of the compounds of formula I or II, is superior effects to carrier-mediated efflux over compound A (by a saturable system, probably P-gp). Consequences of this less pronounced efflux is;<br>
-	a greater absorption<br>
-	higher drug levels in the brain and<br>
-	higher drug levels in the tumour.<br>
This effect on P-gp and transport mechanism may be demonstrated as follows:<br>
Caco-2 cell monolayers grown on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) filters (FalconTM) for 21-25 days are used for transport experiments. The flux of compounds across Caco-2 cell monolayers grown on PET filters as well as across PET filters alone without Caco-2 cells (for system validation) in the presence and absence of the potent efflux pump inhibitors CsA and Verapamil, respectively, are determined as follows: Prior to the transport experiment, the culture medium in the acceptor compartment (0.2 ml for apical and 1.0 ml for basolateral sides) is replaced with acceptor solution (HBSS, when relevant containing the inhibitor of interest) preincubated at 37°C. To start the experiment, the medium in the donor compartment (0.35 ml for apical and 1.15 ml for basolateral sides) is replaced with donor<br><br>
solution (compound in HBSS, when relevant containing inhibitor of interest) preincubated at 37°C. Aliquots of 150 pi are removed from the donor and the acceptor side after about 1 and 120 minutes. Transport experiments in both apical-to-basolateral and basolateral-to-apical directions are performed in triplicate at 37°C in an incubator without shaking.<br>
Furthermore, the plasma protein binding of the compounds of formula I or II is superior with regard to free fraction and/or association with plasma proteins (e.g. albumin, a-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG)), to that observed with compound A. A lower extent of association to AAG results in less pronounced variability of free fraction of N-oxides and also has an effect of free fraction of compound A compounds. At the clinically relevant dose of 400 mg daily dose (concentrations of 900-2600 ng/mL of compound A), the free fraction of compound A ranges from 4 to 5%. Using erythrocyte partitioning, compound A was mainly found associated with albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG). The fraction associated with lipoproteins and gamma globulins was 
The free (or unbound) fraction of compounds of formula I or II is determined by the ultracentrifugation method which was used also for compound A (see European patent application No. 1250140 or International patent application WO 01/47507 filed on 22/12/2000). Solutions of human serum albumin (40 g/L) and a-1-acid glycoprotein (1 g/L) will be prepared in Soerensen buffer pH 7.4 containing 0.9% NaCI (w/v). 30 pL of the compounds of formula I or II stock solutions are directly spiked into 3 ml_ of the protein solutions to get the intended final concentrations of 300-5000 ng/mL compounds of formula I or II (ethanol final concentration 0.5%, factor 1:200). After incubation for 30 min at 37°C under constant gentle agitation, the spiked protein samples (n=3/4) are centrifuged at 200'000 g for'at least 5 hours h at 37°C (centrifuge with a fixed angle rotor) using thick-walled polycarbonate centrifuge tubes. The spin is stopped without braking. The concentration of compounds of formula I or II are determined after incubation (before centrifugation) and after centrifugation in the supernatant.<br>
The pharmacokinetics of the compounds of formula I or II are advantageous over compound A with regard to Cmax (highest observed concentration in plasma in units mass/volume), half-live (refers to the time after administration of the drug to observe a diminution of one half of the measured pharmacological response; In one aspect, the half-life<br><br>
is enhanced when the half-life is increased by at least 50%) or AUC (plasma concentrations over time, as defined by the Area Under the Curve (AUC) in units of mass-time/volume) in plasma as a matter of transport mechanism (e.g. P-gp).. This advantageous pharmacokinetics is shown by giving to animals (e.g. rats) a single dose of compounds of formula I or II (one group of animals will be treated intravenously and one group of animals will be treated per orally). Blood is taken at selected time points (e.g. 0.083 min (iv: intra venous) and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 h after iv or po (per orally dosing). Plasma is prepared immediately by centrifugation of blood. Unchanged compounds of formula I or II and compound A are measured in plasma using HPLC/UV detection or LC-MS.<br>
Furthermore, the reduced plasma protein binding of the compounds of formula I or II to plasma proteins can cause an increase in the apparent volume of distribution due to higher fraction of unbound drug (fu). Advantageously, the distribution of the compounds of formula I or II into organs and tissues (including the brain) is different from that of compound A. This can be shown as follows.<br>
-	Compounds of formula I or II and compound A in brain of mice or rats upon dosing<br>
with non-radiolabelled N-oxide.<br>
Animals (e.g. mice or rats) receive a single dose of compounds of formula I or II (one group of animals is treated intravenously and one group of animals is treated per orally). Animals are sacrificed at selected time points (e.g. 0.083 min (iv) and 1, 8, 24 and 48 h after iv or po dosing). Brain of treated animals are taken, homogenates of brain are prepared and samples are prepared (e.g. extraction of homogenate with organic solvent such as methanol, acetonitrile or others) for analysis (HPLC/UV or LC-MS) of compounds of formula I or II and compound A. Concentrations of compounds of formula I or II and compound A in brain and plasma is measured for determination of ratio brain/plasma.<br>
-	Distribution of radioactive substance(s) in mice or rats upon dosing with radiolabelled<br>
N-oxide.<br>
For the tissue distribution study, e.g. 10 mg/kg po of radiolabelled N-oxide (e.g. [14C]-label; 100 nCi/kg b.w. ) is administered to animals. The uptake / distribution of radioactive substance(s) throughout the body of the animal is investigated using quantitative whole-body autoradioluminography (QWABL). The animals arer sacrificed at selected time points and frozen in a mixture of dry-ice and hexane at approx. -75°C. Frozen animals are embedded<br><br>
in a pre-cooled 2% aqueous gel of Na-CMC, at approx. -75°C; . 40 urn thick sections are obtained at ca. -20°C in a CryoMacrocut cryomicrotome (Leica Instr. GmbH, D-Nussloch). Dehydration of sections take place during 24-60 h at -23°C in the cryomicrotome. Sections exposure to BAS III Imaging plates (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., J-Tokyo) for 1 day at room temperature in a lead shielding box to minimize the increase of the background. The duration of exposure allows detection of ca. 2 dpm/mg, i.e. the radioactivity concentration corresponding to ca. 0.2-0.4% of the total radioactive dose if the radioactivity was evenly distributed throughout the body. Scan is performed in a Fuji BAS 2000 TR phosphor imager, immediately after the end of the exposure, under controlled light conditions, at a 100 jim scanning step with a 1024 gradation. Image analysis is done as follows: The resulting photostimulated light data files are corrected by subtracting the background, processed electronically with the help of a MCID/M4 (3.0 Rev. 1.3) image analyzer (Imaging Research, St. Catherines, Ontario, Canada) and automatically converted into radioactivity concentrations using a 1st degree polynomial calibration curve obtained from a radioactive blood scale processed under similar conditions as the samples. Detection (LD) and quantitation (QL) limits are determined by LD = mean of background (n=10) + 3 SD; QL = 3 LD.<br>
The size of the measurement areas are the same as that of each blood standard of the blood scale used to set the calibration curve. Image files processed using the Adobe Photoshop® software.<br>
For distribution of total radioactive substance(s) Using QWABL only half of the treated animal are used which makes possible to use organs or tissues for determination of unchanged N-oxide and/or compound A in selected samples using HPLC/UV or HPLC-radioactivity and/orLC-MS.<br>
Compounds of formula I or II have also less affinity to CYP450s [1, 2], because of N-oxides which are more polar. These enzymes are metabolizing most of the drugs on the market. Less affinity translates to smaller drug/drug interaction potential. Especially the blocking of a basic nitrogen like in a piperazine/pyridine moiety reduce the affinity to CYP2D6 an enzyme which binds substrates especially by ionic interaction with the aspartate residue which requires a basic moiety like the nitrogen in the piperazine'ring system. A pool out of ten different human liver microsomes are incubated with all cofactors necessary for their metabolic activity (NADPH ) with defined marker substrates for the respective CYP450 isozyme specific activity. The potential inhibitor is added with increasing concentrations and<br><br>
the metabolic reactions are evaluated by the corresponding analytical method (LC/MS, HPLC, Fluorescence). The conversion rate without inhibitor is set to 100 % and the inhibition rate is evaluated as the concentration of inhibitor needed to suppress 50 % of the conversion (IC50). The following marker substrates are used:<br><br><br><br>
In addition, a compound of formula I or II shows useful effects in the treatment of disorders arising as a result of transplantation, for example, allogenic transplantation, especially tissue rejection, such as especially obliterative bronchiolitis (OB), i.e. a chronic rejection of allogenic lung transplants. In contrast to patients without OB, those with OB often show an elevated PDGF concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. If a compound of formula I or II is administered to rats with tracheal allogenic transplants, for example in a dose of 50 mg/kg i.p., it can be shown after removal of 10 transplants per group after 10 and 30 days for morphometric analysis of possible epithelial lesions and occlusion of the airways, and investigation for immunohistochemical pathways of action that, although a compound of formula I or II has no significant effect on epithelial necrosis or infiltration by inflammatory cells, it does markedly reduce fibroproliferation and occlusion of the lumen compared with controls. Synergistic effects with other immunomodulatory or anti-inflammatory substances are possible, for example when used in combination with cyclosporin A (CsA), rapamycin, or ascomycin, or immunosuppressant analogues thereof, for example cyclosporin G, FK-506 or comparable compounds; corticosteroids; cyclophosphamide; azathioprine; methotrexate; brequinar; leflunomide; mizoribine; mycophenolic acid; mycophenolate mofetil; 15-deoxyspergualin; immunsuppressant antibodies, especially monoclonal antibodies for leucocyte receptors, for example MHC, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD7, CD25, CD28, B7, CD45, CD58 or their ligands; or other immunomodulatory compounds, such as CTLA4lg. If CsA (1 mg/kg s.c.),.for example, is combined with a compound of formula I or II (50 mg/kg), synergism may be observed.<br>
A compound of formula I or II is also effective in diseases associated with vascular smooth-muscle cell migration and proliferation (where PDGF and PDGF receptor often also play a role), such as restenosis and atherosclerosis. These effects and the consequences thereof for the proliferation or migration of vascular smooth-muscle cells in vitro and in vivo can be demonstrated by administration of a compound of formula I or II and also by investigating its effect on the thickening of the vascular intima following mechanical injury in vivo.<br><br>
A compound of formula I or II is used in 0.1 N HCI or DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM for in vitro studies. The stock solution is further diluted with cell culture medium and used in concentrations of 10 to 0.1 ^M for the experiments. For in vivo administration, a compound of formula I or II is dissolved for example in DMSO at a concentration of 200 mg/ml and then diluted 1:20 with 1% Tween in 0.9% saline solution. After sonication, a clear solution is obtained. The stock solutions are prepared fresh each day before administration. (The compound of formula I or II may also be dissolved simply in deionised water for oral administration or in 0.9% saline solution for parenteral administration). Administration is carried out 24 hours before the operation. A compound of formula I or II is administered to rats in one dose of 50 mg/kg i.p. per day for the entire observation period. Control rats are given the same formulation but without the presence of a compound of formula I or II. Oral administration is also possible.<br>
Primary cultures of smooth-muscle aorta cells are isolated from 9 to 11-day-old DA (AG-B4, RT1a) rat aorta using a modification of the method described by Thyberg et al. (see Differentiation 25, 156-67 (1983)). The aorta is opened by means of a longitudinal incision and the endothelium carefully removed. The adventitia and the tunica media are separated, and the tunica media is digested with 0.1% collagenase and DNAse in phosphate-buffered physiological saline for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells are centrifuged, suspended in culture medium, and then allowed to grow on plastic vials. The primary cells are used for the experiments after passages 2 to 6. Subcultures are kept in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmol/ml glutamine, 100 mmol/ml streptomycin, and 100 lU/ml penicillin. For identification purposes, the cells are left to grow on glass slide covers and stained immunohistochemically using an anti-d-actin antibody obtained from smooth-muscle cells (see below).<br>
The migration of smooth-muscle cells is quantified in vitro using a Transwell cell culture insert (Costar, Cambridge, MA) whose upper and lower compartments are separated by a polycarbonate membrane of 8 ^m pore size. The cells (100 (xl at a concentration of 1 million cells/ml) are exposed in the upper compartment. After 2 hours, 60 ng/ml PDGF-BB or PDGF-AA (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) is added to the lower compartment, supplemented with 0.5% fetal calf serum and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and the test compound of formula I or II is added in concentrations of 3, 1, 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01, and 0.003 |j.M. To measure fibronectin-dependent migration, the Transwell chambers are<br><br>
covered with fibronectin at a concentration of 10 fig/ml for 24 h at 4 °C (human cellular fibronectin, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). After 24 hours' migration, the filters are removed, fixed in methanol, and stained with Mayer's haematoxylin and eosin. The migrated cells on the lower side of the filter membrane are determined by counting the specified sectional fields on the filters with the aid of a light microscope with a magnification of 400x. The inhibition of migration is quantified in terms of the percentage of cells versus with the control. To exclude the possibility of a toxic effect, the viability of the cells is tested by incorporation of 3H-thymidine in DMEM, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. An inhibition of migration induced by PDGF-AA and especially by PDGF-BB is observed with a compound of formula I or II.<br>
Experimental animals: the aorta and carotid artery of male Wistar rats (purchased from the Laboratory Animal Centre of the University of Helsinki, Finland) are denuded. The rats are anaesthetised with 240 mg/kg chloral hydrate i.p. and Buprenorphine (Temgesic, Reckitt &amp; Coleman, Hull, UK) is administered for perioperative and postoperative alleviation of pain. All animals are given human care in keeping with the "Principles of Laboratory Animal Care" and the "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals" of the NIH (NIH Publication 86-23, revised 1985). Rats weighing 200-300 g were used for the denudation procedure. The left common carotid artery is denuded of endothelium through the intraluminal passage of a 2F embolectomy catheter (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Santa Ana, CA, 27). To remove the endothelium, the catheter is passed through the lumen three times, inflated with 0.2 ml air. The external carotid is ligated after removal of the catheter and the wound closed. The histological changes are evaluated by reference to sections of mid-carotid 4 days after denudation. The thoracic aorta is denuded of endothelium using a 2F Fogarty arterial embolectomy catheter. The catheter is inserted into the thoracic aorta via the left iliac artery, inflated with 0.'2 ml air, and passed through the lumen five times to remove the endothelium. The iliac artery is then ligated. Three times (3, 7 and 14 days) are selected for evaluation of the histological changes.<br>
To quantify the proliferating cells, 3 different procedures are used for labelling the cells with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) after denudation of the rat carotid. In this model, the media cell proliferation begins 24 h after denudation; cells in the intima first appear after 72-96 hours. To quantify the proliferation of smooth-muscle cells before the appearance of cells in the intima, 0.1 ml BrdU-labelling reagent (ZYMED, San Francisco, CA) is administered i.v.<br><br>
during the postoperative period of 0 to 72 h post-denudation (in total 0.1 ml 6 times). To quantify the proliferation during the initial wave of migration, the rats were given 3 x 0.1 ml BrdU-labelling reagent at 8-hour intervals over a period of 72-96 hours after the operation. To quantify the proliferation at the end of the initial wave of migration, a third group of rats is given a pulsed dose of 0.3 ml BrdU three hours before sacrifice.<br>
Histological samples are fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde solution for 4 h for embedding in paraffin. Morphological changes are evaluated from paraffin sections stained with Mayer's haematoxylin-eosin. The cell counts of different vessel sections are calculated at a magnification of 400x. To identify cells in culture and cells appearing in the neo-intima within four days of the denudation injury, immunohistochemical staining of acetone-fixed samples is carried out using an anti-cc-actin antibody obtained from smooth-muscle cells (Bio-Makor, Rehovot, Israel). Primary smooth-muscle cells are identified on acetone-fixed glass cover slides using the same staining method. The sections are incubated with the primary antibody (dilution 1:2000), washed, and incubated consecutively with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit-antimouse-lg and goat-antirabbit-lg, followed by treatment with substrate solution with the chromogen 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazol and hydrogen peroxide. BrdU stains are prepared from paraffin sections using a primary mouse antibody (Bu20a, Dako, A/S, Denmark) and the Vectastain Elite ABC-Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burliname, CA). The sections are deparaffinised and treated by microwave at 500 W (2 x 5 min in 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 6), followed by treatment with 95% formamide in 0.15 M trisodium citrate for 45 min at 70 °C. Antibody dilutions are prepared according to the manufacturer's specifications. The sections are counterstained with Mayer's haematoxylin and eosin, and positive cells are counted separately for the initima, media, and adventitia.<br>
In the carotid of treated animals, a significant decrease is found in the cell count for smooth-muscle cells. The adventitia and the media showed a significant reduction in the cell count. As a result of a compound of formula I or II, a slight decrease in the absolute number of BrdU-labelled cells is seen in the intima, media, and adventitia during the first two labelling periods (0-72 and 72-96 h), and after 93-96 h a decrease in the number of labelled cells is seen in all compartments. Decreases in the number of smooth-muscle cells are likewise found in the aorta-denuded animals.<br><br>
According to these findings, a compound of formula I or II can thus inhibit the proliferation, and especially the migration, of vascular smooth-muscle cells.<br>
A compound of formula I or II is also capable of inhibiting angiogenesis. This may be demonstrated as follows: a chamber containing agar (0.8%) and heparin (2 U/ml) with or without growth factor (VEGF 3 fig/ml, PDGF 1 ^g/ml or bFGF 0.3 (ig/ml) is implanted subcutaneously into normal mice (C57 BL/6). A compound of formula I or II is administered orally in a dose showing good anti-tumour activity in a nude mouse xenotransplant model. Dosing is started one day before implantation of the chambers. The chambers are removed after 5 days. The angiogenic efficacy is quantified by measuring both the vascularised tissue which has grown around the implant and the blood content of this tissue (external blood). The blood is determined by measuring the haemoglobin. Although the vessels do not grow into the agar, the agar becomes intensely red if an antiangiogenic effect is present. If a compound inhibits the increase in blood that is induced by the growth factor, this is seen as an indication that the compound in question is blocking the angiogenic effect of the growth factor concerned. Inhibition of the weight but not the volume of blood suggests an effect on the proliferation of fibroblasts. A suppression of the control response suggests an inhibition of wound healing. At an oral dose of 50 mg/kg once daily, a compound of formula I or II inhibits the angiogenic effect of all three growth factors (VEGF, PDFG, bFGF).<br>
Interestingly, it was found that 4-[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-methyl]-W-{4-hydroxymethyl-3-[[4-(3-pyridinyl)-2-pyrimidinyl]-amino]-phenyl}-benzamide, 4-[(4-methyl-4-oxido-1-piperazinyl)-methyl]-A/-{4-methyl-3-[[4-(3-pyridinyl)-2-pyrimidinyl]-amino]-phenyl}-benzamide and 4-[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-methyl]-/V-[4-methyl-3-[[4-(1-oxido-3-pyridinyl)-2-pyrimidinyl]-amino]-phenylj-benzamide represent metabolites of A/-[4-methyl-3-(4-pyridin-3-yl-pyrimidin-2-ylamino)-phenyl]-4-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-benzamide (STI571 or imatinib, hereinafter compound A) which can be found in the human body upon administration of compound A.

and, if so desired, a compound of formula I or II obtained by process a) or b) is converted into another compound of formula I or II, an obtained free compound of formula I or II is converted into a salt, an obtained salt of a compound of formula I or II is converted into the free compound or another salt, and/or a mixture of isomeric compounds of formula I or II is separated into the individual isomers.<br>
In a most preferred embodiment, compounds of formula I or II are in a substantially pure form.<br>
The term "substantially pure" is understood in the context of the present invention to mean substantially free of biological material such as found in the blood, especially less than 10%, preferably less than 1%, and most preferably free of such biological material.<br>
Description of the process variants<br>
A suitable oxidizing agent for converting a compound obtained by process a) or b) into a N-oxide of formula I or II is preferably hydrogen peroxide or a suitable peracid, for example a suitable perbenzoic acid, such as especially m-chloro-perbenzoic acid. The reaction is carried out in an inert solvent, for example a halogenated hydrocarbon, such as dichloromethahe, at temperatures of approximately from -20 °C to the boiling point of the solvent in question, in general below +100 °C. If hydrogen peroxide is used as the oxidizing agent, the reaction is preferably carried out in water at about room temperature. The desired N-oxide can then be purified using conventional methods such as e.g. column chromatography or recrystallisation.<br>
On the other hand, the N-oxides of formula I or II may be prepared according to the process described in the preceding paragraph by already oxidizing the starting materials used in the synthesis of compounds of formula I or II.<br><br>
Regarding process a):<br>
The reaction between a compound of formula ill and a compound of formula IV preferably takes place in a suitable inert solvent, especially A/,/V-dimethylformamide, in the presence of propylphosphonic anhydride (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) and a base such as especially triethylamine, preferably at room temperature.<br>
Regarding process b):<br>
The reaction between a compound of formula V and a compound of formula IV preferably<br>
takes place in a suitable inert solvent, especially alcohols, e.g. lower alcohols such as<br>
especially ethanol, at elevated temperature, preferably near the boiling temperature of the<br>
solvent employed.<br>
Halo present in a compound of formula V is e.g. fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo, preferably<br>
chloro.<br>
Additional process steps<br>
In the additional process steps, carried out as desired, functional groups of the starting compounds which should not take part in the reaction may be present in unprotected form or may be protected for example by one or more protecting groups. The protecting groups are then wholly or partly removed according to one of the known methods. Protecting groups, and the manner in which they are introduced and removed are described, for example, in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Plenum Press, London, New York 1973, and in "Methoden derorganischen Chemie", Houben-Weyl, 4th edition, Vol. 15/1, Georg-Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart 1974 and in Theodora W. Greene, "Protective Grpups in Organic Synthesis", John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York 1981. A characteristic of protecting groups is that they can be removed readily, i.e. without the occurrence of undesired secondary reactions, for example by solvolysis, reduction, photolysis or alternatively under physiological conditions.<br>
The end products of formula I or II may however also contain substituents that can also be used as protecting groups in starting materials for the preparation of other end products of formula I or II. Thus, within the scope of this text, only a readily removable group that is not a constituent of the particular desired end product of formula I is designated a "protecting group", unless the context indicates otherwise.<br><br>
General process conditions<br>
All process steps described here can be carried out under known reaction conditions, preferably under those specifically mentioned, in the absence of or usually in the presence of solvents or diluents, preferably those that are inert to the reagents used and able to dissolve them, in the absence or presence of catalysts, condensing agents or neutralising agents, for<br>
example ion exchangers, typically cation exchangers, for example in the protonated (H+-) form, depending on the type of reaction and/or reactants at reduced, normal, or elevated temperature, for example in the range from -100 °C to about 190 °C, preferably from about -80 °C to about 150 °C, for example at -80 to -60 °C, at RT, at -20 to 40 °C, at 0 to 100 °C or at the boiling point of the solvent used, under atmospheric pressure or in a closed vessel, if need be under pressure, and/or in an inert, for example an argon or nitrogen, atmosphere.<br>
The invention relates also to those embodiments of the process in which one starts from a compound obtainable at any stage as an intermediate and carries out the missing steps, or breaks off the process at any stage, or forms a starting material under the reaction conditions, or uses said starting material in the form of a reactive derivative or salt, or produces a compound obtainable by means of the process according to the invention under those process conditions, and further processes the said compound in situ. In the preferred embodiment, one starts from those starting materials which lead to the compounds described hereinabove as preferred.<br>

A stirred solution of 2-amino-4-nitrobenzoic acid (Aldrich; 18.2 g, 100 mmol) in dry THF (500 mL) at 20°C, is treated with a solution of borane-THF complex (BH3-THF; Fluka; 100 mL of 1.0 M), dropwise over 45 min to regulate the gas evolution. The mixture is then heated at 65°C for 2 h. The stirred mixture is then cooled to 0°C, treated with water (20 mL) and warmed to RT. Upon the cessation of gas evolution, hydrochloric acid (20 mL of 12 M) is added and the mixture is then heated at 65°C for 30 min. The cooled mixture is then concentrated to a volume of circa 150 mL by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure to give a suspension. The suspension is filtered and the precipitate is redissolved in ethyl acetate (500 m'L) and washed with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate (2 x 150 mL).

The mixture is then stirred at 100°C for 15 h to give a solution, which is then cooled to RT and treated with ethyl acetate (200 mL).
