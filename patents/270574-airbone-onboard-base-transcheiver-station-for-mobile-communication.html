TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention refers to a base station, BTS, and a method for a BTS, for a cellular<br>
communication system comprising a user equipment, UE, onboard an aircraft<br>
being at a predetermined altitude, and a terrestrial network.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In the field of mobile communication systems it is known to use mobile telephones<br>
(cellular phones) and other devices using means for wireless communication,<br>
hereinafter abbreviated UE for User Equipment. The UE has an omni directional<br>
antenna sending out signals in a spherical pattern to a terrestrial network. The<br>
terrestrial network is built up from a number of cells managed by a number of<br>
base stations connected to ground antennas covering each cell. The ground<br>
antennas are normally not omni directional, but restricted to an azimuth angle<br>
giving a horizontal sector and an altitude angle giving a vertical sector.<br>
The UEs communicate with that base station having the best communication<br>
parameters for the moment. When the communication parameters are altered for<br>
the worse, for example when the UE moves away from the base station and<br>
migrates to another cell, the UE moves from the weaker base station to a<br>
neighbouring base station with better communication parameters.<br><br>
Cellular networks are sustained by a pattern of adjacent cells of radio coverage.<br>
First generation (1G) systems, such as NMT, AMPS, etc. and second generation<br>
(2G) system, such as GSM, utilize different frequencies to separate neighboring<br>
cells whereas UMTS apply logical coding to achieve cell separation. The reason<br>
for using different frequencies and codes respectively is to minimise interference<br>
problems for UEs in neighbouring cells.<br>
However, the numbers of frequencies are limited why the cellular pattern has to<br>
be repeated in a larger area, in order to use the same frequency a number of<br>
times.<br>
When a UE is used onboard an aircraft a problem occurs when the plane is at a<br>
distance from the ground because the line of sight from above is so wide that a<br>
signal from the UE engages/interferes with a number of cells using the same<br>
frequency. For example, if a person onboard an aircraft at an altitude above<br>
3000m turns on his cellular phone, the omni directional antenna will send in at<br>
least the direction of sight and will thus finally engage/interfere with a number of<br>
different cells using the same frequency or code. This causes the above<br>
mentioned problem with interference for a number of UEs in the terrestrial network<br>
and may therefore out voice utilized frequency/timeslot combinations in a large<br>
region of the network, also at distances far outside the normal GSM cell radius.<br>
Furthermore, it is a waste of recourses to use or block the same frequency in a<br>
number of different cells in order to perform the same task. Yet further problems<br>
occur if the cells engaged are owned by different network managers. Similar<br>
problems occur if a passenger has forgotten to turn off the cellular phone. The<br>
cellular phone then communicates to a number of cells in order to announce its<br>
position and to roam in on new network operators.<br>
Today there is no method to prevent a mobile from initiating access to any<br>
network it has previously been granted access to (on a national/operator level). If<br>
the home operator has a roaming agreement with an operator in another country<br>
the UE may then be able to interconnect anywhere while within radio coverage of<br>
that operator's network.<br><br>
Even without this approval, all GSM UEs, shall be allowed to make emergency<br>
calls in any network while within coverage, why some interaction will take place<br>
unless measures are made.<br>
There are also situations when a government, the operator of the network or<br>
others, like to prevent a UE to interact with other networks than a dedicated<br>
access point or access points.<br>
Therefore, there is a desire for a better communication system that can control<br>
communication/traffic to and from a UE in an aircraft, giving no or minimised<br>
interference problems in the terrestrial network.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The invention refers to a base station (hereinafter called BTS) for a cellular<br>
communication system comprising a user equipment (hereinafter called UE)<br>
onboard an aircraft being at a predetermined altitude and a terrestrial network.<br>
The invention is characterised in that the BTS is arranged to be an airborne<br>
onboard BTS comprising a screening device generating a first signal being<br>
matched to screen a second signal from the terrestrial network at a predetermined<br>
altitude. The onboard BTS also comprises a signal generator generating a third<br>
signal being stronger than the first signal and/or the second signal. The onboard<br>
BTS is arranged to establish a communication link with the UE via the third signal<br>
In a first embodiment, "matched" refers to the first signal having a first effect in a<br>
first frequency band being matched to screen the second signal having a second<br>
effect in a second frequency band. The first frequency band is equal to or greater<br>
than the second frequency band.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the third signal has a third effect and a third<br>
frequency band being at least partly or completely within the first frequency band<br>
of the first signal.<br>
The communication link is established because the third effect of the third signal is<br>
greater than the first effect and/or because the third effect being greater than the<br>
second effect.<br><br>
The invention also refers to a method for a communication system.<br>
One effect of the invention is that the first signal screens the second signal so that<br>
the UE cannot establish a communication link directly to the terrestrial network.<br>
The UE cannot therefore home in on a certain frequency within the frequency<br>
band of the second signal. This is an advantage since the use of UEs onboard the<br>
aircraft will not disturb the terrestrial network by engaging a number of cells being<br>
based on the same frequency or coding. However, if the UE can trace an<br>
acceptable cell, the UE will adapt to the frequency used in the cell. Therefore, an<br>
initial match is not prerequisite for interference to appear.<br>
Hence, without the inventive communication system all traffic would be carried<br>
though to the terrestrial networks, with major radio interference for all terrestrial<br>
UEs as a result. The onboard BTS according to the invention thus provides a fine<br>
instrument to locally control the traffic transmission channels without inter-working<br>
with all networks in the potentially affected terrestrial region.<br>
Another advantage is that neither the terrestrial network nor the onboard UE have<br>
to be altered in order to avoid the above stated problem. Hence, the fourth signal<br>
is the normal signal being generated in the UE.<br>
The invention according to the first embodiment may be used in all existing<br>
terrestrial networks such as AMPS/D-AMPS, GSM, cdma/CDMA 2000 and UMTS,<br>
i.e. all existing 1G, 2G, 3G, 3,5 and possibly also future 4G systems. All frequency<br>
channels at these bands are screened to force the UE to move to a dedicated<br>
band with allowed access channels supported by the onboard BTS. The dedicated<br>
band may be a narrow band within the screened band or a different band.<br>
The onboard BTS may comprise a signal detection device that detects the second<br>
signal from the terrestrial network. The information is utilized by the onboard<br>
device when determining the signal strength and frequency of the first signal.<br>
However, the onboard BTS may lack a detection device, but may instead be<br><br>
programmed for certain events, i.e. the first signal has a signal strength and<br>
frequency already set for different events. The onboard BTS may then be<br>
controlled to use different modes dependent on the event at hand. The onboard<br>
BTS may be controlled both manually and automatically.<br>
The third signal has a predetermined effect in a predetermined frequency band<br>
when leaving the onboard BTS so that the ratio between the third signal and the<br>
second signal and or the third signal and the first signal corresponds at least to<br>
the minimum requirement for signal to noise ratio (s/n) accepted by the UE in<br>
order to establish a communication link.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the first signal covers the entire frequency<br>
spectrum used by the terrestrial network. This may be implemented by the<br>
onboard BTS sending out the first signal in the form of a pulsed signal with a<br>
repetition interval being short enough to generate a number of pulses for all<br>
frequency channels within one time slot. The accumulated pulses within one time<br>
slot have enough energy to screen the second signal such that the signal to noise<br>
ratio becomes too low in order to establish a communication link. However, the<br>
screening device may send out a continuous signal covering all frequency<br>
channels used by the terrestrial system.<br>
The invention is intended to be used during the following scenario. When the<br>
aircraft is on the ground and ready to take off, all passengers are asked to turn off<br>
their communication devices, i.e. UEs, such as mobile phones and computers<br>
comprising communication equipment. When the aircraft is airborne at a certain<br>
altitude, the screening device is turned on and the onboard passengers are<br>
allowed to turn their UEs on. When the UEs are turned on, the screening device<br>
has generated the first signal screening all signals (the second signal) from the<br>
terrestrial network thereby disturbing the UEs reception of the terrestrial second<br>
signal necessary to make/initiate direct contact with the terrestrial network. The<br>
signal generator generates the third signal being stronger than the first signal<br>
(and/or the second signal) and at a certain frequency or frequencies. The UEs are<br>
searching for a signal with acceptable signal to noise ratio and homes in on the<br>
third signal. The onboard BTS thus creates an onboard cell in which the UEs may<br><br>
be used. The system is preferably arranged so that the crew can start the<br>
screening device without the onboard BTS signal generator being active. This<br>
causes the possibility to block all UEs from being able to communicate. The signal<br>
generator may then independently be switched on and switched off when traffic is<br>
to be allowed or prohibited respectively.<br>
The onboard BTS is preferably connected to an onboard antenna in the form of a<br>
leaky cable extending in the longitudinal direction of the aircraft and in the vicinity<br>
of a passenger using a UE. This short distance between the UE and the antenna<br>
gives the possibility to keep the power of the first and third signals at a minimum.<br>
The onboard BTS is connected to a satellite link handling traffic between the<br>
aircraft and dedicated base stations in the terrestrial network. The onboard BTS<br>
thereby mediates traffic between the terrestrial network and the UEs via the<br>
satellite link. The satellite link comprises an onboard satellite antenna sending<br>
signals to a satellite positioned at a higher level than the aircraft. The satellite<br>
communicates with the dedicated bases station. The satellite link may comprise a<br>
modem between the onboard BTS and the satellite. The communication between<br>
the onboard BTS and the modem may be based on A-bis (Interface between BSC<br>
and BTS in GSM) or IP (Internet protocol). The satellite link may be exchanged to<br>
a link between an onboard antenna directed to the ground communicating with a<br>
dedicated base station or base stations.<br>
Below are two examples of how the invention may be used in a GSM based<br>
terrestrial network. The examples shall not be considered limiting for the invention,<br>
but as a mere intention to further explain the invention<br>
First Example:<br>
The GSM frequencies are evenly distributed over the GSM 900, GSM 1800 and<br>
over the GSM 1900 bands. A cell normally uses between 2 and 12 different<br>
frequencies.<br>
When the aircraft is at an altitude of 3000m the second signal has lost<br>
approximately 107dB because of the transport through the air and 10 dB because<br><br>
of the signal penetrating the wall of the aircraft. Additional losses are caused by<br>
the vertical antenna gain of the terrestrial BTS. The signal strength in the aircraft<br>
of the received second signal from the terrestrial network is about -95dBm after<br>
the above mentioned losses. The signal strength of the first signal is set to +15dB<br>
above the received terrestrial second signal strength and the third signal is<br>
defined to a signal strength of additionally +15dB, i.e. approximately 30dB margin<br>
to the second signal.<br>
The screening device generates the first signal comprising all the necessary<br>
frequencies and with an effect of about 3 dBm per 200KHz when entering the<br>
antenna system. The third signal may have an initial effect of up to 35W/45dBm<br>
when entering the antenna system coupled to the onboard BTS. For the case<br>
with 15 dB margin to the first signal it is sufficient with an initial effect of 18 dBm<br>
when entering the antenna system.<br>
The UE has a threshold for the signal to noise ratio (s/n) of at least 7 dB in order<br>
to establish a communication link with the onboard BTS. In the case where the<br>
first signal has an effect of about 3 dBm, and with the chosen 15 dB additional<br>
strength compared to the first signal, the third signal has an effect of at least<br>
18dBm. The effect is dependent on frequency and bandwidth.<br>
However, if the level of the second signal strength is known exactly, and since the<br>
s/n ratio must be 7dB for the UE to accept the signal, the first signal could have a<br>
signal strength being less than the signal strength of the second signal, namely<br>
down to 7 dB but not below the second signal strength, for example 6.5 dB below<br>
the second signal. The third signal must then add at least 7 dB to the second<br>
signal in the aircraft.<br>
Therefore, suitable levels of the first signal have been shown to be between 0 to<br>
12 dBm when entering the antenna, dependent on the type of aircraft construction<br>
due to the fact that, the larger the aircraft the longer the antenna and the greater<br>
the losses.<br><br>
The UE cannot transmit a signal below 0 dBm why this level is the starting point<br>
for received signal in the terrestrial network from the UE.<br>
Second example:<br>
The example discusses a worst case estimate of the interference level at the<br>
onboard BTS and the terrestrial system using GSM 1800 and isotropic antennas.<br>
A terrestrial BTS transmits normally at 30 dBm (1W) to 60 dBm in the horizontal<br>
plane. The resulting energy level at distance of 3 km has been measured to -85<br>
dBm. The aircraft chassis adds another 10 dB of shielding, resulting in a -95 dBm<br>
signal level from the terrestrial BTS inside the cabin.<br>
The screening device will be configured to exceed this level with about 15 dB, i.e.<br>
the onboard UE shall perceive a first signal level of -80 dBm. The required effect<br>
of the first signal from the onboard BTS per frequency channel fed into the leaky<br>
antenna cable are calculated by compensating for the antenna coupling Loss (73<br>
dB for one antenna) and the antenna cable alternation (4 dB) resulting in -3 dBm.<br>
This effect, being the worst case, is reduced by 10 dB due to shielding of the<br>
chassis and the free space loss lost in traversing to ground (107 dB) and the<br>
results is -120 dBm impact on the terrestrial network from the screening device.<br>
The onboard BTS will transmit the third signal at a level that is received by the UE<br>
at an additional 15 dB above the first signal, i.e. -65 dBm. Similar to the screening<br>
device ground impact calculation above the impact at ground from the third signal<br>
equals -105 dBm.<br>
To prevent the UE to initiate calls with the UE maximum signal level, i.e. +30 dBm,<br>
the onboard BTS will be configured to limit the UE to its minimum signal level, i.e.<br>
0 dBm. This configuration is done in a BSC in a terrestrial system and is fed to the<br>
UE in the third signal. The BSC communicates with the onboard BTS via a<br>
dedicated route, for example, a satellite communication link. The BSC may be<br>
placed in any location suitable for the purpose of managing one or a number of<br>
onboard BTS in the air. Reception at ground would be about 0 dBm (UE output) -<br><br>
10 dB (aircraft chassis) - 107 dB (air transmission lost over 3000 m) = -117 dBm.<br>
From this the negative antenna gain of the terrestrial BTS should be deducted.<br>
The impact from the third signal is normally so weak that it is drowned in the<br>
background noise at the terrestrial level.<br>
The conclusion from this calculation is that the mutual impact on terrestrial and<br>
onboard networks is neglectable as long as the screening device prevents the<br>
onboard UEs to gain direct access to the terrestrial network.<br>
The total effect required by the screening device and the signal generator may<br>
also be concluded from the above. First the losses in antenna near components (6<br>
dB) have to be taken in account. The resulting screening device (first signal) and<br>
signal generator (third signal) output power are 3 respective 18 dBm per<br>
frequency channel. The screening device will transmit on the full GSM 900 and<br>
GSM 1800 bands (124 + 375) 499 frequency channels adding (10xLog499) 27.0<br>
dB resulting in 30 dBm total screening device output power in the first signal. In<br>
one example, the signal generator in the onboard BTS will only transmit at three<br>
or less frequency channels (4.8 dB) resulting in 22.8 dBm onboard BTS output<br>
power of the third signal. However, the signal generator may generate a third<br>
signal comprising more frequency channels than three and the BTS output power<br>
must then be enhanced accordingly.<br>
The above mentioned parameters are different for different aircrafts, different<br>
terrestrial systems, different altitudes, etc, why the inventive onboard BTS have to<br>
be adapted accordingly.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the first signal does not cover the entire<br>
frequency band corresponding to the second signal, but only a part of the<br>
frequency band.<br>
In a second embodiment of the invention, the screening device is arranged to<br>
generate a pulsed first signal being matched to screen a control channel in the<br>
second signal in the cellular network.<br><br>
Here "screen" refers to the first signal being transmitted in the same region where<br>
the second signal is transmitted such that the first signal is superposed onto at<br>
least that part of the second signal comprising the control channel thereby<br>
disturbing the information in the control channel. If the information is disturbed the<br>
UE cannot read the information and cannot therefore establish a connection.<br>
Here "match" refers to the screening device being fed information on the second<br>
signal in the form of duration, effect, repetition interval and position of the control<br>
channel in the second signal, and from that information calculating and generating<br>
the pulsed first signal with a suitable pulse interval and repetition interval and<br>
effect so that the pulsed first signal disturbs the second signal during that time<br>
period the control channel is transmitted in the network.<br>
One benefit of the embodiment is that only a part of the second signal needs to be<br>
blocked in order to prevent the UE to establish a connection with the network.<br>
Therefore the screening device does not have to be used continuously. On the<br>
contrary the screening device generates the first signal in the form of one pulse<br>
with a predetermined pulse interval and at a predetermined repetition interval. The<br>
predetermined pulse interval and the predetermined repetition interval shall be set<br>
such that the control channel is blocked. The screening device thus uses only a<br>
fraction of the duration of the second signal. The benefit of this embodiment thus<br>
lies in the screening device being less power consuming and may, for the same<br>
power usage, thus be utilised at a higher degree than a continuous screening<br>
device by generating a number of different pulses for screening of additional<br>
signals from the network.<br>
In a GSM based communication system the pulsed first signal has a first effect in<br>
a first frequency band utilised by the UE and the network. The first effect in the<br>
first signal is matched to screen the control channel in the second signal.<br>
In GSM, a frequency band is divided, using a FDMA scheme, into a number of<br>
carrier frequencies with 25-30khZ bandwidth being spaced one from each other<br>
by a 200 khz frequency band measured from the apex of the 25-30 KHz<br><br>
bandwidth. Each carrier frequency is then divided in time using a TDMA scheme.<br>
This scheme splits the radio channel into 8 time slots. A time slot is the unit of<br>
time in a TDMA system, and it lasts approximately 0.577 ms. A TDMA frame is<br>
formed with 8 time slots and lasts, consequently, 4.616 ms. Each of the eight time<br>
slots, that form a TDMA frame, are then assigned to a single user. However, in<br>
GPRS it is possible for a user to obtain a number of time slots in order to get<br>
access to increased data rate. Each TDMA designates one time slot to a control<br>
channel in the form of a BCH and designates the rest of the time slots to traffic<br>
channels TCH and control channels in the form of CCCH and/or DCCH. It is only<br>
the BCH that needs to be disturbed in order to prevent traffic. The BCH burst<br>
length is also referred to as a BCH batch. Three different types of BCHs can be<br>
distinguished<br>
BCHs are used, by the BTS (here a transceiver), to provide the UE with the<br>
sufficient information it needs to synchronize with the network. The BCH burst<br>
length extends over 5 and 1/8 TDMA frames and consequently 23.657 ms long<br>
The BCH burst length is also referred to as a BCH batch. Three different types of<br>
BCHs can be distinguished:<br>
•	The Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH), which gives to the UE the<br>
parameters needed in order to identify and access the network<br>
•	The Synchronization Channel (SCH), which gives to the UE the training<br>
sequence needed in order to demodulate the information transmitted by the<br>
base station<br>
•	The Frequency-Correction Channel (FCCH), which supplies the UE with<br>
the frequency reference of the system in order to synchronize it with the<br>
network<br>
In order to prevent GSM traffic it is only necessary to screen frequency channels<br>
transmitting any of the BCH.<br>
Furthermore, theoretically only frequency channels transmitting the BCH batch<br>
needs to be screened in order for the receiving UE to be prevented from initiating<br>
network connection due to the low quality of the received signal. Theoretically this<br><br>
can be achieved by the screening device being time synchronized with the<br>
network and where the first signal has pulse interval of one time slot and a<br>
repetition interval being identical to the BCH burst length.<br>
However, since the screening device is not necessarily time synchronized with the<br>
network, the first signal needs a theoretical minimum pulse interval of 4.616 ms<br>
(eight Time Slots) in order to secure screening of one full, or parts of two, BCH<br>
Time Slots. With BCH burst length that equals 23.657 ms the screening device<br>
must transmit periodically with a period time not exceeding 23.5 ms to secure not<br>
to risk any BCH batch to pass through intact.<br>
However, testing has shown an optimal screening effect when the pulse interval in<br>
the first signal is at least 7 ms with a repetition interval of maximum 23.5 ms.<br>
The screening device can utilize the silent time of the duty cycle to screen<br>
additional frequency channels and thereby increase the screening capability of the<br>
screening device by a factor about three compared to continuous screening. A<br>
further advantage is that the screening device can use 70% additional effect<br>
compared to the continuous screening or, for the same effect as the continuous<br>
signal, use 70% less power and thus giving 70% additional useful life when<br>
running on battery. One additional advantage is that the 70% power saving gives<br>
the possibility to increase the output signal three times with the same useful life as<br>
a continuously operated screening device.<br>
Another advantage of the embodiment is that the source of the screening device<br>
will also be more difficult to track and locate due to the intermittent signalling.<br>
To sum up, it is possible to screen the second signal continuously, according to<br>
the first embodiment, by sending the first signal as a continuous signal interfering<br>
with the second signal in its entirety, or to use a pulsed first signal according to the<br>
second embodiment, with all the advantages stated above.<br>
One effect of the invention is that the first signal screens the second signal so that<br>
the UE cannot establish a communication link and cannot therefore home in on a<br>
certain frequency within the frequency band of the second signal.<br><br>
At present, the 2G GSM frequencies are evenly distributed over the GSM-1800<br>
and over the GSM-1900 bands. A cell normally uses between 2 and 12 different<br>
frequencies.<br>
The invention is not limited to a GSM based system, but may be used on different<br>
systems using a second signal with a BCH batch (BCH burst length) different<br>
number of time slots with different duration and different number of control<br>
channels. The invention must then be adapted by altering the pulse interval and<br>
the pulse repetition interval in the first signal accordingly.<br>
For example, the screening device may be used in a CDMA (Code Division<br>
Multiple Access) system using codes to identify connections. The screening<br>
device must here be matched to generate a first signal with a pulse length and<br>
repetition interval matching the corresponding control channel.<br>
In a CDMA based communication system the first signal is matched to disturb the<br>
pilot signal and may comprise a code. The pilot signal in a CDMA based system<br>
corresponds to the BCH batch in the TDMA based GSM system. However, in a<br>
CDMA based system the BCH batch may be in a different form than the above<br>
stated, and the control channel in such a signal is disturbed with a pulsed signal.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the screening device is arranged to generate<br>
the pulsed first signal with a pulse length being of the same length or at least of<br>
the same length as the pulse length of the control channel and with a repetition<br>
interval less than the BCH batch for the communication system in question.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the screening device is arranged to<br>
generate the pulsed first signal with a pulse length being of the same length or at<br>
least of the same length as the pulse length of the control channel and with a<br>
repetition interval identical to the repetition interval of at least one control channel<br>
within a broadcast channel burst length.<br><br><br>
In the two latter embodiments, the above mentioned advantages are maintained.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the screening device may be comprised<br>
in a BTS transmitting the second signal, i.e. in a terrestrial network. The benefit of<br>
this solution is that the communication between the UE and the BTS may be<br>
controlled by the screening device without any changes being made in the second<br>
signal.<br>
In yet a further embodiment of the invention, the screening device comprises a<br>
detection device that detects and analyses the second signal. The onboard BTS<br>
uses the information in order to match the first signal to screen the second signal<br>
and to give the third signal such configuration that the UE can distinguish the third<br>
signal from the first and second signals.<br>
The third signal may comprise information intended for the control of the UE.<br>
Examples of such information is maximum transfer unit that limits the output effect<br>
of the UE and maximum timing advance (TA) giving the UE information on how<br>
large the cell logically is.<br>

EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 schematically shows a base station BTS (hereinafter called BTS)<br>
according to the invention onboard an aircraft 1 at an altitude overlooking a part of<br>
a terrestrial network comprising cells C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6 and C7 in a<br>
reoccurring pattern. The cell frequency plan is such that adjacent cells are not<br>
using the same frequencies in order to minimize disturbances from other cells<br>
using the same frequency. The onboard BTS comprises a screening device 2 and<br>
a signal generator 3. The onboard BTS is connected to a satellite link comprising<br>
a satellite antenna 4, a satellite 5 and a dedicated bases station 6 in the terrestrial<br>
network. Onboard the areoplane 1 is a UE comprising an omni directional<br>
antenna. In figure 1 the line of sight for the UE is shown as a cone 7. The UE may<br>
potentially communicate with all the cells C1-C7 within the cone 7.<br>
Figure 2 schematically shows a traffic scheme in a network comprising the<br>
onboard BTS and the UE according to figure 1.<br>
The onboard BTS comprises the screening device 2 generating the first signal S1<br>
and the signal generator 3 generating the third signal S3. The Terrestrial network<br>
transmits the second signal S2 being possible for the UE to receive. The UE also<br>
transmits a fourth signal S4 in an omni directional pattern. However, the fourth<br>
signal is not strong enough to interfere with the terrestrial network, but the<br>
communication is established between the onboard BTS and the UE via the third<br>
signal S3 and the fourth signal S4. The onboard BTS also transmits a fifth signal<br>
S5 intended to be linked to the terrestrial network. The onboard BTS also receives<br>
a sixth signal S6 from the terrestrial network. The fifth and sixth signals form a<br><br>
communication link between the onboard BTS a dedicated terrestrial BTS, and<br>
ultimately a communication link between the UEs and the terrestrial<br>
communication system.<br>
The BTS transmit signals by use of a transmitting unit (not shown) and receives<br>
signals by use of a receiving unit (not shown).<br>
Figure 3 schematically shows a signal to noise ratio (hereinafter called s/n)<br>
scheme between two cells operated by two terrestrially bound BTS.<br>
The terrestrial network is designed to handle a certain s/n. If two adjacent GSM<br>
cells would use the same frequency there would be a region, a "dead zone",<br>
where both cells have too low s/n to operate.<br>
Furthermore, figure 3 shows that the signal strength decreases in air since the s/n<br>
decreases with distance. This is utilised in the invention since the UE has to<br>
receive a signal with an s/n over a predetermined threshold in order to establish a<br>
connection. The screening device in the onboard BTS generates the first signal<br>
that increases the noise so that the s/n becomes below the threshold. Since the<br>
second signal from the terrestrial network has been decreased on its way to the<br>
aircraft, the screening device only has to generate a correspondingly weak first<br>
signal in order to decrease the s/n below the threshold. The weak first signal S1<br>
does not disturb the terrestrial network because it decreases in strength on its way<br>
from the aircraft 1 to the ground so that when it reaches the base stations in the<br>
terrestrial network, the first signal S1 does not add much or no noise to the signals<br>
close to the ground.<br>
Figure 4 schematically shows a frequency to power diagram according to the<br>
present invention for the signals in the aircraft. Figure 4 shows that the second<br>
signal S2, coming from the terrestrial network, comprises three frequency bands<br>
S2F1-S2F3. The screening device 2 in the onboard BTS generates a first signal<br>
S1 comprising three frequency bands S1F1-S1F3 corresponding to the three<br>
frequency bands S2F1-S2F3 in the second signal S2 and thus screens the<br>
second signal S2.<br><br>
Figure 4 also shows that the signal generator 3 generates a third signal S3<br>
comprising three frequencies S3F1-S3F3 within one of the three frequency bands<br>
S1F1-S1F3. The third signal S3 is stronger than the first and the second signal<br>
S1, S2 thereby generating an s/n above the threshold. The second signal S2 has<br>
attenuated on its way from the ground and into the aircraft. The third signal S3<br>
only has to be strong enough to give an s/n over the threshold in the aircraft and<br>
does not have to be as strong as the second signal S2 on the ground. Therefore,<br>
the third signal S3 does not disturb the terrestrial network because it decreases in<br>
strength on its way from the aircraft to the ground so that when it reaches the<br>
base stations in the terrestrial network the third signal does not add much or no<br>
noise to the signals close to the ground.<br>
The signal traffic thus becomes directed to a dedicated access point in the aircraft<br>
so that interaction with any other network is prevented.<br>
Figure 5 schematically shows a BCH batch 8 transmission pattern in a GSM<br>
based system. The transmission pattern should be read from left to right and from<br>
the top to the bottom row by row. In figure 5 the BCH batch 8 is also shown as a<br>
sequence of time slots below the transmission pattern.<br>
GSM is a TDMA technique with multiple frequency channels. Each frequency<br>
channel is divided into a TDMA frame comprising eight time slots, assigned to<br>
control channels or traffic channels (half rate or full rate TCH). The control<br>
channels comprise BCH, CCCH and DCCH, but it is only the BCH that needs to<br>
be disturbed. Each time slot is 0.577ms long and the BCH burst length is 5 and<br>
1/8 TDMA frames and consequently 23.657 ms long.<br>
Each TDMA cell designates one time slot to a control channel in the form of a<br>
BCH and designates seven time slots as traffic channels TCH. BCH channels are<br>
used, by the BTS, to provide the UE with the sufficient information it needs to<br>
synchronize with the network. The BCH burst length extends over 5 and 1/8<br>
TDMA frames and is consequently 23.657 ms long. The BCH burst length is also<br>
referred to as a BCH batch. Three different types of BCHs can be distinguished:<br><br>
the BCCH depicted with the letter B; the SCH depicted with the letter S, and<br>
FCCH depicted with the letter F.<br>
In order to prevent GSM traffic it is only necessary to screen frequency channels<br>
transmitting any of the BCH.<br>
Figure 6 schematically shows the first signal S1 from the inventive screening<br>
device superposed on the second signal S2 being a GSM transmission according<br>
to figure 5. In figure 6, the synchronization channel S is screened by the pulsed<br>
first signal S1. With a BCH batch 8 burst length that equals 23.657 ms the<br>
screening device 2 periodically transmits a pulse with a pulse length being at least<br>
7 ms and with a repetition interval not exceeding 23.5 ms. The first signal S1 also<br>
has an effect matching the effect of the second signal such that the signal to noise<br>
ration becomes low enough for the UE to disregard the information in the control<br>
channel. The features of the pulsed first signal S1 hinders that any BCH batch 8<br>
pass through intact.<br>
In this embodiment, the third signal S3 is generated according to the embodiment<br>
described in connection to fig. 4. The third signal is stronger than the first signal<br>
S1 and the second signal S2 and thus becomes the choice for the UE when trying<br>
to establish a communication link.<br><br><br>
