				<td>Method for producing alkylanilides from halobenzene derivatives<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing known fungicidally active alkylanilides from 2-alkylhaloaromatics and heterocyclylamides.<br>
EP-A-0 824 099 and WO-A-03010149 disclose that alkylanilides are obtained by reacting the appropriate acid chloride with the appropriate alkylaniline derivative.<br>
Both preparation and handling of the acid chlorides and the preparation of the alkylanilides are associated with a considerable level of technical complexity. For example, the acid chlorides have to be purified before the reaction by a time-consuming and costly distillation step.<br>
The anilines are prepared typically, as described in WO-A-3074491, by a complicated synthesis from the corresponding bromoaromatics and benzophenone imine or at temperatures of 150°C and pressures of from 75 to 85 bar with ammonia gas, as described in WO-A-06061226.<br>
Alkylanilines, however, frequently exhibit toxic properties and are potentially mutagenic.<br>
The prior art discloses that aryl halides can be reacted with amides under palladium or copper catalysis to give alkylanilides (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002,124, 7420).<br>
It is frequently found, however, that metal-catalyzed reactions with heterocycles which can function as chelating ligands are inhibited. Furthermore, ortho-substituted haloaromatics are sterically hindered for a halogen exchange.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process for simple and selective preparation of alkylanilides, which does not have the disadvantages described in the prior art.<br>
Surprisingly, conditions have been found under which heterocyclylamides can be reacted efficiently with ortho-substituted haloaromatics.<br>
The present invention thus provides a process for preparing alkylanilides of the formula (I)<br><br>

(Scheme I)<br>
In connection with the present invention, the term "halogen" (X) encompasses elements which are selected from the group consisting of fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, preference being given to using chlorine and bromine, and particular preference to using bromine.<br>
Optionally   substituted   radicals   may  be   mono-   or  polysubstituted,   where  the<br>
substituents may be the same or different in the case of polysubstitutions.<br>
The definition "C1-C6-alkyl" encompasses the largest range for an alkyl radical defined herein. SpeC1fically, this definition encompasses the meanings of methyl, ethyl, n-, isopropyl, n-, iso-, sec-, tert-butyl, and in each case all isomeric pentyls and hexyls.<br>
The definition "C2-C6-alkenyl" encompasses the largest range for an alkenyl radical defined herein. SpeC1fically, this definition encompasses the meanings of ethenyl, n-, isopropenyl, n-, iso-, sec-, tert-butenyl, and in each case all isomeric pentenyls and hexenyls.<br>
The inventive compounds can optionally be used as mixtures of different possible isomeric forms, espeC1ally of stereoisomers, for example E and Z, threo and erythro, and also optical isomers, and if appropriate also of tautomers. It is possible to use both the E and the Z isomers, and also the threo and erythro isomers, and also the optical isomers, any mixtures of these isomers, and also the possible tautomeric forms.<br>
The haloalkylbenzenes required are known in the prior art, for example from WO-A-03074491, or can be prepared by known methods by Friedel-Crafts alkylation or electrophilic aromatic halogenation.<br>
A further possibility is that of reacting 2-halobenzaldehydes with Wittig reagents, in which case the propenone derivatives thus obtained, as described in WO-A-03 074491, can be converted to cyclopropyl compounds.<br>
Other possibilities are the hydroxyalkylation of aromatics or metalated aromatics with ketones or aC1d chlorides and, respectively, the subsequent elimination and reduction thereof. Proceeding from 1,2-dibromobenzene, this is illustrated by way of example in scheme (II):<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED <br><br>
Alternatively, it is also possible to obtain the halogen compounds in question from aniline derivatives by diazotization and Sandmeyer reaction.<br>
According to the present invention, the haloalkylbenzene of the formula (IX)<br><br>
in which X is a halogen atom, espeC1ally Br, is a preferred reactant.<br>
Only some of the aC1d amides required are known, and they can be obtained from known aC1d halides, aC1ds, esters or nitriles by known reactions.<br>
This will be illustrated by the following example according to scheme (III):<br><br>
(FORMULA REMOVED<br><br>
The nitrogen source used may be aqueous or gaseous ammonia or one of its salts, for example ammonium acetate or sodium amide.<br>
Useful solvents for the preparation of the aC1d amides include all solvents which are stable under the reaction conditions, for example ethers such as THF, 2-methyl-THF, dioxane, methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE), diethylene glycol, diethoxymethane, dimethoxymethane; aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, benzene; aliphatic hydrocarbons such as petroleum ether, heptane, hexane, methylcyclohexane, cyclohexane; dimethylformamide (DMF); dimethylacetamide; N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP); dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), acetonitrile; butyronitrile; water; ketones such as acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK); alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol.<br>
For the inventive reaction of the aC1d amide with the halobenzene derivative, metal catalysts are used. For this purpose, palladium and copper in all oxidation states are useful, for example in metallic form or in the form of salts.<br>
According to the present invention, for example, Pd(OAc)2, Pd(OH)2, PdCb,<br>
Pd(acac)2 (acac = acetylacetonate), Pd(NO3)2, Pd(dba)2, Pd2dba3, (dba -<br>
dibenzylideneacetone),	dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II),<br>
Pd(CH3CN)2Cl2, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), Pd/C or palladium nanoparticles, Cul, CuCl, CuSCN, Cu2O, CuO, CuCl2, CuSO4, CuBr, CuBr2, Cu2S, Cu(OAc)2, Cu(acac)2 are suitable, preference being given to using the copper compounds or mixtures thereof.<br>
According to the present invention, the catalysts are used in catalytic amounts. This means that the metal catalysts are used in concentrations of from 0.01 to 50.0 mol%, preferably of 1.0 to 20.0 mol%, based on the carboxamides of the formula (II).<br>
The inventive reaction is preferably performed in the presence of ligands.<br>
In the case of palladium catalysis, suitable ligands are, for example, selected from the group of carbene and phosphine ligands, particular preference being given to using xantphos and tris(t-butyl)phosphine.<br>
In the case of copper catalysis, suitable ligands are, for example, selected from the group consisting of diamines, for example N,N"-dimethyl-1,2-cyclohexanediamine (C1s or trans, racemic or as an enantiomer), NjN'-dimethylethylenediamine, ethylenediamine, N-methylethylenediamine, N-butylethylenediamine, N,N,N"-trimethylethylenediamine or else 1,10-phenanthroline, ethylenediaminetetraacetic aC1d, tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride, tris(3,6-trioxaheptyl)amine (TDA-1), particular<br>
preference being given to using N,N'-dimethyl-1,2-cyclohexanediamine.<br>
The ligands are added to the metal catalyst in such a ratio that the desired catalytic action occurs.<br>
According to the present invention, the ratio of ligand to metal catalyst is between 0.5 to 10 equivalents, preferably between 1 to 5 equivalents.<br>
The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of bases. Useful examples include alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides such as KOH, NaOH, Ca(OH)2, fluorides such as KF, phosphates such as K3PO4, and carbonates such as potash, soda, cesium carbonate or phosphazene bases, alkoxides such as sodium tert-butoxide, or phenoxides such as sodium phenoxide.<br>
According to the present invention, the bases are used in concentrations of from 0.5 to 5 equivalents, preferably from 1.0 to 3 equivalents, based on the carboxamides of the formula (II).<br>
The inventive reaction of the aC1d amide with the halobenzene derivative is preferably carried out in a solvent.<br>
The solvents used are preferably dioxane, THF, diglyme, toluene, xylene, DMF.<br>
According to the present invention, the aC1d amides and the halobenzene derivatives are reacted with one another in an equimolar ratio. In an alternative embodiment, the halobenzene derivative can also be used in excess, for example as a solvent.<br>
According to the invention, the aC1d amides are reacted with the halobenzene derivatives at temperatures in the range from 20 to 200°C, preferably from 70 to 150°C.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, carboxamides of the formula (V) are reacted with compounds of the formula (X)<br>
in which the X radical is a halogen<br>
to give carboxamides of the formula (XI)<br>

N-[2-(l,3-Dimethylbutyl)phenyl]-5-fluoro-l,3-dimethyl-lH-pyrazole-4-carboxamide<br>
A mixture of 0.221 g (1.16 mmol) of copper iodide, 3.21 g (23.22 mmol) of potash<br>
and 2.189 g of 5-fluoro-l,3-dimethyl-lH-pyrazole-4-carboxamide is admixed under<br>
argon with 330 mg (2.322 mmol) of N,N"-dimethyl-1,2-cyclohexanediamine, 2.8 g<br>
(11.6 mmol) of l-bromo-2-(l,3-dimethylbutyl)benzene and 30 ml of toluene. After<br>
boiling under reflux for one day, the mixture is poured onto water and 10 ml of a 5%<br>
EDTA solution. Subsequently, the mixture is extracted three times with ethyl acetate<br>
and concentrated by evaporation under reduced pressure. The oily residue is dissolved<br>
in toluene and stirred into n-hexane. After the preC1pitated crystals have been filtered<br>
off with suction, 3.3 g (89% of the theoretical yield) of N-[2-(l,3-<br>
