COATING COMPOSITION COMPRISING AN ALKOXYSILANE,<br>
A POLYSILOXANE, AND A PLUALITY OF PARTICLES<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]   The present invention relates generally to coating compositions comprising an<br>
alkoxysilane, a polysiloxane, and a plurality of particles.<br>
Background Information<br>
[0002]   Color-plus-clear coating systems, which involve the application of a colored or<br>
pigmented basecoat to a substrate followed by appUcation of a transparent or clear top coat<br>
(clearcoat) over the basecoat, are typically used as original finishes for automobiles<br>
manufactured in the automotive OEM industry. These color-plus-clear systems possess<br>
outstanding appearance properties such as gloss and distinctness of image due in large part to<br>
the clearcoat.<br>
[0003]   Because the clearcoat is the outermost coating layer on such a coating system, it is<br>
susceptible to damage from numerous environmental elements. These elements include acidic<br>
precipitation, exposure to ultraviolet radiation from sunlight, high relative humidity and<br>
temperatures, and defects due to impact with small, hard objects resulting in chipping and<br>
scratching of the coating surface.<br>
[0004]   Typically, a clearcoat having a harder more highly crosslinked film may exhibit<br>
improved scratch resistance, but it is much more susceptible to chipping and/or thermal<br>
cracking due to embrittlement of the film resulting from a high crosslink density. A softer,<br>
less crosslinked film, while not prone to chipping or thermal cracking, is susceptible to<br>
scratching, water spotting and acid etch due to a low crosslink density of the cured film.<br>
There is, accordingly, a need for an improved clearcoat.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0005]   In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a coating composition comprising:<br>
(a) a compound comprising a reactive group of structure (I)<br>
(I)	-X-SiR"x(0R')3-z<br>
wherein X is a hydrocarbon chain; wherein x = 0 to 2 and z = 0 to 2; wherein each R' and R" comprise independently hydrogen, a halogen, an amide, a hydrocarbon chain, carboxy, alkoxy, a hydrocarbon chain comprising a heteroatom, and/or a hydrocarbon chain<br>
 <br>
2 comprising a carbonyl group; and wherein when x is 2, then each R" may be the same or different; and wherein when z is 0 or 1, then each R' may be the same or different;<br>
(b)	a polysiloxane comprising a reactive functional group that comprises at least one<br>
of the following structural units (II):<br>
(II)	R*„R^mSiO(4-„-m)/2<br>
wherein R^ is hydrogen, hydroxyl, a hydrocarbon group, or a sUoxane chain; R^ comprises a functional group; and wherein m and n fulfill the requirements of 0<n and wherein when n> 1, then each R' may be the same or different; and wherein when m &gt;1, then each R^ may be the isame or different;<br>
(c)	a reactant comprising a functional group that is reactive with component (b); and<br>
(d)	a plurality of particles selected from inorganic particles, composite particles and mixtures thereof.<br>

The polyepoxide can be an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic polyepoxide or mixtures of any of the foregoing. Nonlimiting examples of polyepoxides suitable for use include epoxy functional acrylic copolymers prepared from at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer having at least one epoxy group, for example glycidyl (meth)acrylate and allyl glycidyl ether, and one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers which have no epoxy functionality.

Component (d):<br>
[0042] As stated above, the coating composition of the present invention comprises a pliu-ality of particles. In certain embodiments, the particles have an average particle size less than 50 microns prior to incorporation into the composition.

[0046] As used herein, the term "inorganic material" means any material that is not an organic material.<br>
[0047] As used herein, the term "composite material" means a combination of two or more differing materials. The particles formed from composite materials generally have a hardness at their surface that is different from the hardness of the internal portions of the particle beneath its surface.

 <br>
15 [0053]   In certain embodiments, the particles have a hardness value that is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,657,001, column 20, line 64, to column 22, line 4, the cited portion of which is being incorporated herein by reference.<br>

In other embodiments, however, an additional curing agent, which is only reactive with the reactive functional group of the fihn-forming polymer, may be added to the coating composition of the present invention. Suitable curing agents that can be used include those described above in connection with component (c). In certain embodiments, the curing agent described in this paragraph may be the same or diflferent from the curing agent described above.<br>
[0057] In an embodiment of the present invention, the additional polymer having at least one reactive functional group, if employed, is generally present, when added to the other components in the composition, in an amount ranging form 1 weight percent to 90 weight percent, such as from 2 weight percent to 80 weight percent, from 5 weight percent to 60 weight percent, or from 10 weight percent to 50 weight percent, based on the total weight of the resin soUds of the coating composition. Other Components:<br>
 <br>
16 [0058] The coating composition described herein may further comprise additional ingredients such as colorants. As used herein, the term "colorant" means any substance that imparts color and/or other opacity and/or other visual effect to the composition. The colorant can be added to the coating in any suitable form, such as discrete particles, dispersions, solutions and/or flakes (e.g., aluminum flakes). A single colorant or a mixtvu-e of two or more colorants can be used in the coating composition described herem.<br>
[0059] Example colorants include pigments, dyes and tints, such as those used in the paint industry and/or listed in the Dry Color Manufacturers Association (DCMA), as well as special effect compositions. A colorant may include, for example, a finely divided solid " powder that is insoluble but wettable under the conditions of use. A colorant can be organic or inorganic and can be agglomerated or non-agglomerated. Colorants can be incorporated into the coatings by use of a grind vehicle, such as an acrylic grind vehicle, the use of which will be familiar to one skilled in the art.<br>
[0060] Example pigments and/or pigment compositions include, but are not limited to, carbazole dioxazine crude pigment, azo, monoazo, disazo, naphthol AS, salt type (lakes), benzimidazolone, condensation, metal complex, isoindolinone, isoindoline and polycyclic phthalocyanine, quinacridone, perylene, perinone, diketopyrrolo pyrrole, thioindigo, anthraquinone, indanthrone, anthrapyrimidine, flavanthrone, pyranthrone, anthanthrone, dioxazine, triarylcarbonium, quinophthalone pigments, diketo pyrrolo pyrrole red ("DPPBO red"), titanium dioxide, carbon black, or mixtures thereof. The terms "pigment" and "colored filler" can be used interchangeably.<br>
[0061] Example dyes include, but are not limited to, those that are solvent and/or aqueous based such as phthalo green or blue, iron oxide, bismuth vanadate, anthraquinone, perylene, aluminum and quinacridone.<br>
[0062] Example tints include, but are not Umited to, pigments dispersed in water-based or water miscible carriers such as AQUA-CHEM 896 commercially available from Degussa, Inc., CHARISMA COLORANTS and MAXITONER INDUSTRIAL COLORANTS commercially available from Accurate Dispersions division of Eastman Chemical, Inc. [0063] As noted above, the colorant can be in the form of a dispersion including, but not limited to, a nanoparticle dispersion. Nanoparticle dispersions can include one or more highly dispersed nanoparticle colorants and/or colorant particles that produce a desired visible color and/or opacity and/or visual effect. Nanoparticle dispersions can include colorants such as pigments or dyes having a particle size of less than 150 nm, such as less than 70 nm, or less than 30 nm. Nanoparticles can be produced by milling stock organic or<br>
 <br>
17 inorganic pigments with grinding media having a particle size of less than 0.5 mm. Example nanoparticle dispersions and methods for making them are identified in U.S. Patent No. 6,875,800. Nanoparticle dispersions can also be produced by crystallization, precipitation, gas phase condensation, and chemical attrition (i.e., partial dissolution). In order to minimize re-agglomeration of nanoparticles within the coating, a dispersion of resin-coated nanoparticles can be used. As used herein, a "dispersion of resin-coated nanoparticles" refers to a continuous phase in which discreet "composite microparticles", which comprise a nanoparticle and a resin coating on the nanoparticle, is dispersed. Example dispersions of resin-coated nanoparticles and methods for making them are identified in United States Patent AppUcation Publication 2005/0287348, U.S. Provisional AppUcation No. 60/482,167, and United States Patent Application Serial No. 11/337,062,<br>
[0064] Example special effect compositions that may be used include pigments and/or compositions that produce one or more appearance effects such as reflectance, pearlescence, metallic sheen, phosphorescence, fluorescence, photochromism, photosensitivity, thermochromism, goniochromism and/or color-change. Additional special effect compositions can provide other perceptible properties, such as opacity or texture. In a non-limiting embodiment, special effect compositions can produce a color shift, such that the color of the coating changes when the coating is viewed at different angles. Example color effect compositions are identified in U.S. Patent No. 6,894,086. Additional color effect compositions can include transparent coated mica and/or synthetic mica, coated siUca, coated alumina, a transparent liquid crystal pigment, a liquid crystal coating, and/or any composition wherein interference results from a refractive index differential within the material and not because of the refractive index differential between the surface of the material and the air. [0065] In certain non-limiting embodiments, a photosensitive composition and/or photochromic composition, which reversibly alters its color when exposed to one or more light sources, can be used in the coating composition described herein. Photochromic and/or photosensitive compositions can be activated by exposure to radiation of a specified wavelength. When the composition becomes excited, the molecular structure is changed and the altered structure exhibits a new color that is different from the original color of the con^osition. When the exposure to radiation is removed, the photochromic and/or photosensitive composition can return to a state of rest, in which the original color of the composition returns. In one non-Umiting embodiment, the photochromic and/or photosensitive composition can be colorless in a non-excited state and exhibit a color in an excited state.  Full color-change can appear within milliseconds to several minutes, such as<br>
 <br>
18<br>
from 20 seconds to 60 seconds. Example photochromic and/or photosensitive compositions include photochromic dyes.<br>
[0066] In a non-limiting embodiment, the photosensitive composition and/or photochromic composition can be associated with and/or at least partially bound to, such as by covalent bonding, a polymer and/or polymeric materials of a polymerizable component. In contrast to some coatings in which the photosensitive composition may migrate out of the coating and crystallize into the substrate, the photosensitive composition and/or photochromic composition associated with and/or at least partially bound to a polymer and/or polymerizable component in accordance with a non-Umiting embodiment of the present invention, have minimal migration out of the coating. Example photosensitive compositions and/or photochromic compositions and methods for making them are identified in U.S. Application Serial No. 10/892,919.<br>
[0067] In general, the colorant can be present in any amount sufficient to impart the desired visual and/or color effect. The colorant may comprise from 1.0 to 65 weight percent of the present compositions, such as from 3 to 40 weight percent or 5 to 35 weight percent, with weight percent based on the total weight of the compositions.<br>
[0068] The coating compositions can comprise other optional materials well known in the art of formulated surface coatings, such as plasticizers, anti-oxidants, hindered amine light stabilizers, UV light absorbers and stabilizers, surfactants, flow control agents, thixotropic agents such as bentonite clay, pigments, fillers, organic cosolvents, catalysts, including phosphonic acids and other customary auxiliaries.<br>
[0069] Suitable catalysts that may be used include acid and basic catalyst known to those skilled in the art. Lewis acid and base catalysts, as well as organic acid and base catalysts, may be utilized in the present invention. For example, tin naphthenate, tin benzoate, tin octoate, tin butyrate, dibutyltin dilaurate, dibutyltin diacetate, dibutyltin oxide, lead octoate, aluminum ethyl acetoactetate, zirconium ethyl acetoacetate, and unblocked and blocked versions of dinonylnaphthalene disulfonic acid, dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, alkyl acid phosphate, phenyl acid phosphate, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), triethylamine, guanine, pyridine, tetramethylguanidine, phosphonic and diphosphonic diesters, and the various blocked versions of the catalysts mentioned above.<br>
[0070] In addition to the materials described above, the coating composition can also comprise an organic solvent.   Suitable organic solvents that can be used in the coating<br>
 <br>
19<br>
composition include any of those listed in the preceding paragraphs as well as butyl acetate, xylene, methyl ethyl ketone, or combinations thereof. Physical Properties:<br>
[0071] In certain embodiments, the coating composition of the present invention, after appUcation to a substrate and after curing, demonstrates a 20° gloss retention of at least 80%, such as greater than 90% (e.g., 90% to 95%), when subjected to ABRASION TESTING METHOD 1. The test begins by measuring the 20° gloss of the cured coating ("original gloss") , which has been applied onto a substrate, prior to subjecting the coated substrate to the Amtec-Kistler Car Wash Test DIN 55668. For each of the ABRASION TESTING METHODS described herein, the gloss measurement is taken by using a gloss meter such as the NOVO GLOSS-GARDCO gloss meter (avaUable from Paul N. Gardner Co. of Pompano Beach, Florida). After the gloss measurement is obtained, the coated substrate is then subjected to 10 cycles of the Amtec-Kistler Car Wash Test. After the 10 cycles are complete, the 20° gloss of the coating is again measured ("gloss after mar"). The 20° gloss retention of the coating is determined using formula (I) below:<br>
(I)<br>
(gloss after mar/original gloss) x 100 = gloss retention<br>
[0072] In certain embodiments, the coating composition of the present invention, after appUcation to a substrate and after curing, can demonstrate a 20° gloss retention of at least 70% (e.g., from 75% to 80%), such as greater than 80%, or greater than 90%, when subjected to ABRASION TESTING METHOD 2. ABRASION TESTING METHOD 2 is conducted in the same manner as ABRASION TESTING METHOD 1 but for the fact that the coated substrate is subjected to 40 cycles of the Amtec-Kistler Car Wash Test as opposed to 10 cycles.<br>
[0073] In certain, the coating composition of the present invention, after being applied to a substrate as a coating and after curing, can demonstrate a 20° gloss retention of at least 80%, such as greater than 90% (e.g., 90% to 95%), when subjected to DRY ABRASION TESTING METHOD I. In the DRY ABRASION TESTING METHOD 1, a cured coating on a substrate is subjected to testing by first measuring the 20° gloss of the coating ("original gloss"). The coating is then linearly scratched with a weighted abrasive paper for ten double rubs using an Atlas AATCC CROCKMETER, Model CM-5 (available from Atlas Electric Devices   Company   of Chicago,   Illinois).      The   abrasive  paper  used   is   3M  28IQ<br>
 <br>
20 WETORDRY™ PRODUCTION™ 9 micron poUshing paper sheets, which are commerciaUy available from 3M Company of St. Paul, Minnesota. After scratching, the coated substrate is heated to a substrate temperature of 35 to 60°C for a duration of from 10 seconds up to overnight using any appropriate heat source such as a thermal or convection oven, Uquid (i.e, warm water), heat gun, heat lamp, sunlight, other IR sources, hotroom and the like, and afterwards the 20° gloss ("gloss after mar") is again measured. A coating will pass the DRY ABRASION TESTING METHOD 1 if it retains at least 60% of its original 20° gloss. Gloss retention is measured as described in formula (I) above.<br>
Coating System [0074] The coating composition described above may be applied alone or as part of a coating system that can be deposited onto a number of different substrates. The coating system typically comprises a number of coating layers. A coating layer is typically formed when a coating composition that is deposited onto the substrate is substantially cured by methods known in the art (e.g., by thermal heating). It is noted that the coating composition described above can be used in one or more of the coating layers described in the following paragraphs.<br>
[0075] Suitable substrates that can be coated with the coating composition comprising the polymer include, without Umitation, metal substrates, metal alloy substrates, substrates that have been metallized, such as nickel plated plastic, and/or plastic substrates. In some embodiments, the metal or metal alloy can be aluminum and/or steel. For example, the steel substrate could be cold rolled steel, electrogalvanized steel, and/or hot dipped galvanized steel. Moreover, in some embodiments, the substrate may comprise a portion of a vehicle such as a vehicular body {e.g., without Umitation, door, body panel, trunk deck Ud, roof panel, hood, and/or roof) and/or a vehicular frame. As used herein, "vehicle" or variations thereof includes, but is not limited to, civilian, commercial, and military land vehicles such as cars, motorcycles, and trucks. It will also be understood that, in some embodiments, the substrate may be pretreated with a pretreatment solution, such as a zinc phosphate solution as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,793,867 and 5,588,989 or not pretreated with a pretreatment solution.<br>
[0076] In a conventional coating system used in the automotive industry, a pretreated substrate is coated with an electrodepositable coating composition. Suitable electrodepositable coating compositions that may be used include those described in U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2009/0042060. After the electrodepositable coating composition is cured, a primer-surfacer coating composition is applied onto a least a portion of the electrodepositable<br>
 <br>
21<br>
coating composition. The primer-surfacer coating composition is typically applied to the electrodepositable coating layer and cured prior to a subsequent coating composition being applied over the primer-surfacer coating composition. However, it should be noted that in some embodiments, the substrate is not coated with an electrodepositable coating composition. Accordingly, in these embodiments, the primer-surfacer coating composition is applied directly onto the substrate.<br>
[0077] The primer-surfacer layer that results from the primer-surfacer coating composition serves to enhance chip resistance of subsequently applied coating layers (e.g., color imparting coating composition and/or substantially clear coating composition) as well as to aid in the appearance of the subsequently applied layers. As used herein, "primer-surfacer" refers to a primer composition for use under a subsequently applied coating composition, and includes such materials as thermoplastic and/or crosslinking (e.g., thermosetting) film-forming resins generally known in the art of organic coating compositions. Suitable primers and primer-surfacer coating compositions include spray applied primers, as are known to those skilled in the art. Examples of suitable primers include several available from PPG Industries, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pa., as DPX-1791, DPX-1804, DSPX-1537, GPXH-5379, OPP-2645, PCV-70118, and 1177-225A. Another suitable primer-surfacer coating composition that can be utilized in the present invention is the primer-surfacer described in U.S. Pat. Application No. 11/773,482.<br>
[0078] it should be noted that in some embodiments, the primer-surfacer coating composition is not used in the coating system. Therefore, a color imparting basecoat coating composition can be applied directly onto the cured electrodepositable coating composition. [0079] In some embodiments, a color imparting coating composition (hereinafter, "basecoat") is deposited onto at least a portion of the primer surfacer coating layer (if present). Any basecoat coating composition known in the art may be used in the present invention. It should be noted that these basecoat coating compositions typically comprise a colorant.<br>
[0080] In certain embodiments, the present invention can be used in a substantially clear coating composition (hereinafter, "clearcoat"), which is deposited onto at least a portion of the basecoat coating layer. As used herein, a "substantially clear" coating layer is substantially transparent and not opaque. In certain embodiments, the substantially clear coating composition can comprise a colorant but not in an amount such as to render the clear coating composition opaque (not substantially transparent) after it has been cured.<br>
 <br>
22 [0081] In some embodiments, a first portion of particles (e.g., component (d)), such as silica particles, is present in a surface region of the cured composition in a concentration which is higher than a concentration of a second portion of particles which is present in a bulk region of the cured clear coating composition (i.e., clearcoat layer). In certain instances, the BYK Haze value of the cured composition is less than 50, can be less than 35, and is often less than 20 as measured using a BYK Haze Gloss meter available from BYK Chemie USA. It should also be appreciated that, in certain embodiments, the clearcoat layer can also comprise a polymer network, which comprises the residue of an aUcoxysilane compound (e.g., component (a)). In some embodiments, the polymer network is formed through the hydrolysis reaction of the alkoxysilane compound with itself. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the clearcoat layer comprises a high concentration of silica particles in the surface region of the clearcoat layer while further comprising not only the polymer network described in the preceding sentence, but also a crosslinked network formed from the reaction of an isocyanate curing agent (e.g., component (c)) with the hydroxyl groups of a polysiloxanes (e.g., component (b)). While not wishing to be bound by a particular theory, it is believed that in some embodiments, the polymer network formed from component (a) can interpenetrate between the crosslinked network formed from the reaction of components (c) and (b) thereby increasing the physical properties of the resulting clearcoat layer. Alternatively, in embodiments wherein the coating composition further comprises a film-forming material (e.g., component (e)), such an acrylic polyol, then it is believed that the polymer network can interpenetrate between the crosslinked network formed from the reaction of component (c) and (b) in addition to the crosslinked network formed from the reaction of component (c) with (e).<br>
[0082] As used herein "surface region" of the cured composition means the region which is generally parallel to the exposed air-surface of the coated substrate and which has thickness generally extending perpendicularly from the surface of the cured coating to a depth ranging from at least 20 nanometers to 150 nanometers beneath the exposed surface. In certain embodiments, this thickness of the surface region ranges from at least 20 nanometers to 100 nanometers, and can range from at least 20 nanometers to 50 nanometers. As used herein, "bulk region" of the cured composition means the region which extends beneath the surface region and which is generally parallel to the surface of the coated substrate. The bulk region has a thickness extending from its interface with the surface region through the cured coating to the substrate or coating layer beneath the cured composition.<br>
 <br>
23 [0083] In embodiments of the present invention in which the particles have an average particle size greater than 50 nanometers, the thickness of the surface region generally extends perpendicularly from the surface of the cured coating to a depth equal to three times the average particle size of the particles, and this surface can extend to a depth equal to two times the average particle size of the particles.<br>
[0084] The concentration of particles in the cured coating can be characterized in a variety of ways such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,657,001, column 47, lines 12-60, the cited portion which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
