				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process to produce low ash clean coal from<br>
high ash coal/non coking coals which is used for pulverized coal injection in blast<br>
furnaces, power generation in thermal power plants and any other value added<br>
application requiring low ash coat.<br>
More particularly the present invention relates to produce low ash coal for coke<br>
making by physical and chemical cleaning of high ash content coal on<br>
characterize evaluation of the cleansed coal to be processed for coke making.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
WITH PRIOR ART DIFFICULTIES<br>
Coal is a major fossil fuel that meets about 60% of the world's commercial<br>
energy demand. Known resources of coal and other solid carbonaceous fuel<br>
materials in the world are far greater than the known resources of petroleum and<br>
natural gas combined. Despite this enormous abundance of coal and related<br>
solid carbonaceous materials, reliance on these resources, particularly coal, as<br>
primary sources of energy, has been discouraged for the most part. The<br>
variability of cheaper, cleaner burning, more easily retrievable and transportable<br>
fuels, such as petroleum and natural gas, has in the past, cast coal to a largely<br>
supporting role in the energy field.<br><br><br>
Furthermore, coal is not a uniform substance but rather a mixture of<br>
combustible, metamorphic plant remains that varies in both physical and<br>
chemical composition. Ash producing substance, sulfur, and other materials may<br>
be present in amounts as high as sixty percent. Coal ash is the residue resulting<br>
from non-combustible acidic and basic components in the coal. The major acidic<br>
components are SiO2 and AI2O3. Basic components include magnesium oxide,<br>
calcium oxide, sodium oxide, potassium oxide, and hematite (Fe2O3). Acidic<br>
components also include phosphates and sulfates. Ash, as determined in coal<br>
analysis, may be defined as the noncombustible residue that remains when coal<br>
is burned. The ash forming materials occurring in coal are of two kinds:<br>
extraneous mineral matter and inherent ash. The extraneous mineral matter is<br>
composed mainly of clay and shale minerals, calcite, pyrite or marcasite and<br>
lesser chloride and fluoride minerals. Inherent ash includes inorganic elements<br>
combined with the organic part of the coal, the origin of which is the plant<br>
material from which the coal was formed. Inherent ash displays a reasonably<br>
uniform, essentially molecular distribution throughout the coal mass. Inherent<br>
ash seldom exceed 2 or 3 percent of the weight of the coal. The lower the<br>
inherent ash in the coal, the more reasonable of a reduction in the ash can be<br>
expected.<br><br><br>
Most of the coals are associated with mineral matter, which makes it unsuitable<br>
for efficient utilization, such as carbonisation, gasification, combustion, or<br>
liquefaction. Coking industries, and especially, blast furnaces, are more sensitive<br>
to high-ash contents in coals. As a result, enormous efforts are being extended<br>
to make coal and related solid carbonaceous materials equivalent or better<br>
sources of energy, than petroleum or natural gas. In the case of coal, for<br>
example, much of this effort is directed to overcoming the environmental<br>
problems associated with its production, transportation and combustion.<br>
Furthermore, numerous techniques have been explored and developed to make<br>
coal cleaner, more suitable for burning and more readily transportable.<br>
Regardless of the form in which the coal is ultimately employed, the coal or coal<br>
combustion products must be cleaned because they contain substantial amounts<br>
of sulfur, nitrogen compounds and mineral matter, including significant quantities<br>
of metal impurities like, aluminosilicates, metal oxides, metal pyrites, metal<br>
sulfates, etc. If coal is to be accepted as a primary energy source, it must be<br>
cleaned to prevent pollution of the environment either by cleaning the<br>
combustion products of the coal or cleaning the coal prior of burning.<br>
Accordingly, physical as well as chemical coal cleaning (benefidation) processes<br>
have been explored. In general, physical coal cleaning processes involve<br>
pulverizing the coal to release the impurities, wherein the fineness of the coal<br><br><br>
generally governs the degree to which the impurities are released. However,<br>
because the costs of preparing the coal rise exponentially with the amount of<br>
fines to be treated, there is an economic optimum in size reduction. Moreover,<br>
grinding coal even to extremely fine sizes may not be effective in removing all<br>
the impurities. Based on the physical properties that effect the separation of the<br>
coal from the impurities, physical coal cleaning methods are generally divided<br>
into four categories: gravity, flotation, magnetic and electrical.<br>
In contrast to physical coal cleaning, chemical coal cleaning techniques are in a<br>
very early stage of development. As far as Indian scenario is concerned, most of<br>
the coals present in India are of drift origin and low grade having high mineral<br>
matter contents varying from 5% to greater than 50%. Moreover, the mineral<br>
matter is finely disseminated inside the coal matrix and is at times firmly bound.<br>
Again, since washability characteristics of Indian coal is not good, it is difficult to<br>
remove the mineral matter from coal by conventional physical coal washing<br>
techniques based on specific gravity difference such as heavy media, dense<br>
media etc. Hence, physical methods of beneficiation, such as heavy media and<br>
froth floatation, are of limited use for applications in coal beneficiation to<br>
produce low ash coals for metallurgical coke making and power generation.<br>
Conventional methods of physical beneficiation separate the coal into clean coal<br>
(15-30 %), middling and rejects. The yields of clean coal are at the cost of the<br>
loss of coal in middlings, and rejects which is considerable. Hence, this present<br><br><br>
novel coal cleaning technique of Indian coals using chemicals to leach out the<br>
minerals to obtain clean, demineralized coal has been explored in details.<br>
Chemical leaching of coal is a technology to produce ultra clean coal where the<br>
ash content of clean coal is as low as ~ 1.0% basing on mineralogical<br>
composition of the feed coal. There are potential use of this ultra clean coal<br>
both as a fuel and nonfuel. Conventional chemical leaching processes have been<br>
explored mostly for thermal and non-coking coals. However, the present work<br>
on chemical cleaning process was aimed towards developing a process to<br>
produce low ash coal for coke making with high yield. An effort was made to<br>
decrease the ash content of high ash Indian coals up to ~ 5 % in clean coal<br>
without deteriorating the coking properties. The process has been established in<br>
laboratory scale as well as in bench scale.<br>
In the case of the chemical leaching processes for removing ash from coal, the<br>
inorganic substances constituting the ash content of coal are reacted with<br>
chemical agents and separated from the coal for removal. Various chemicals are<br>
used for the chemical beneficiation process. Some of these chemicals will have a<br>
tendency to dissolve certain inorganic constituents preferentially to others and<br>
the actual chemical to be used may depend upon the inorganic content of the<br>
carbonaceous material which is fed to the process.<br><br><br>
Following the end of World War II, it was learned that German coal processing<br>
plants treated coal with aqueous sodium hydroxide at elevated temperatures and<br>
pressures, and thereafter extracted the coal with aqueous hydrochloric acid. The<br>
process reduced the sulfur and ash content of the coal. (Crawford, BIOS Final<br>
Report No. 522, item No. 30, Feb, 19, 1946, British Intelligence Objectives Sub-<br>
Committee, London (A.T.I. - 118668, Central Documents Office, Wright-<br>
Patterson Airforce Base, Dayton, Ohio). Subsequently, the U.S. Bureau of mines<br>
evaluated a similar process for treating coal, involving leaching with aqueous<br>
sodium hydroxide at 225° C, both with and without a final stage extraction with<br>
aqueous hydrochloric acid. In a report made by Reggel et al in 1972, it was<br>
concluded that the sequence of sodium hydroxide treatment and hydrochloric<br>
acid extraction removed most of the mineral matter originally present in the coal.<br>
Am. Chem. Soc. Div. of fuel chem. Preprints, 17 (1): 44-48. Battelle Memorial<br>
Institute had developed a similar process, which is described in Stambaugh et al<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,055,400 of 1977. An aqueous alkaline slurry of coal is heated<br>
at an elevated temperature and pressure to leach out sulfur and mineral matter.<br>
The Battelle process may optionally include last stage extraction with aqueous<br>
acid to reduce the final ash content. (Stambaugh et al, Hydrocarbon Processing,<br>
54 (7): 115-116 (1975)). An alternative process has undergone extensive<br>
development at Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa. The "Ames" process uses<br>
oxidative desulphurisation in aqueous slurry of sodium carbonate. Typical<br><br><br>
conditions are 0.2 M Na2CO3 at an oxygen partial pressure of about 4<br>
atmosphere and temperatures of 120-140° C for 1-2 hours. This development<br>
was reviewed in detail by Dr. T.D. Wheelock in 1981. (Chem. Eng. Commun.,<br>
12:137-159). In one representative test, using temperatures of 120-140° C, the<br>
total sulfur content of the coal was reduced 70% and the pyritic sulfur content<br>
was reduced 78%. (Wheelock (1981), above cited, at pages 148-149).<br>
In general, chemical leaching processes can be classified into the following four<br>
categories.<br>
1.	Dissolving with an acid<br>
2.	Dissolving with an alkali<br>
3.	Oxidation with air, nitrogen dioxide or the like, followed by dissolving with<br>
an acid or alkali<br>
4.	Treatment with hydrofluoric acid or hydrogen fluoride gas<br>
Such processes are known as processes for removing ash from coal or coke<br>
(Japanese Patent Publication No. 466/1942), a process for removing sulfur and<br>
ash from coals (Japanese Patent Publication No. 23711/1971) and a coal<br>
deashing process (Japanese Patent Disclosure No. 133487/1980). The processes<br>
(1) and (2) with use of an acid or alkali are practiced usually with the application<br><br><br>
of pressure and heat to dissolve the metallic components for the removal of ash.<br>
When practiced under moderate conditions, these processes were almost unable<br>
to achieve any ash removing effect and are therefore not suitable as deashing<br>
processes. The process (3) wherein oxidation is followed by an acid or alkali<br>
treatment is the same as the processes (1) and (2) in principle and is such that<br>
the FeS2 components which are difficult to dissolve are first oxidized and<br>
thereafter dissolved. With the process (4) wherein hydrofluoric acid or hydrogen<br>
fluoride gas is used for treatment, coal is treated with hydrogen fluoride gas<br>
since SiO2 is not easily soluble in acids or alkalis to separate Si in the form of<br>
gaseous SiF4 to achieve a deashing effect. However, the use of hydrofluoric acid<br>
or hydrogen fluoride gas, which is highly toxic and corrosive, involves many<br>
difficulties. Thus an actually effective and useful process for removing ash from<br>
coal still remains to be developed although the deashing of coal is a very<br>
important technique for the effective use of coal.<br>
The patent literature is replete with chemical coal beneficiation processes. For<br>
example, U.S. Patent No. 4, 424,062 discloses a process for chemically removing<br>
ash from coal by immersing ash containing coal in an aqueous solution<br>
containing hydrochloric acid or citric acid in combination with acidic ammonium<br>
fluoride. U.S. Patent No. 3,993,455 discloses a process for removing mineral<br>
matter from coal by the treatment of the coal with aqueous alkali such as sodium<br><br><br>
hydroxide, followed by acidification with strong acid. Similarly, U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,055,400 discloses a method of extracting sulfur and ash from coal by mixing<br>
the coal with an aqueous alkaline solution, such as ammonium carbonate.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,071,328 discloses a method of removing sulfur from coal by<br>
first hydrogenating the coal and the hydrogenated coal is subsequently contacted<br>
with an aqueous inorganic acid solution. U.S. Patent No. 4,127,390 discloses a<br>
process for reducing the sulfur content of coal by treatment with an aqueous<br>
sodium chloride solution. U.S. Patent No. 4,134,737 discloses a process for the<br>
production of beneficiated coal wherein the coal is digested in caustic, then<br>
treated in mineral acid and then treated in nitric acid.<br>
U.S Patent No. 4,083,940 discloses a process for cleaning coal by contacting the<br>
coal with an aqueous leaching solution containing nitric and hydrofluoric acid.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,169,710 discloses comminuting and cleaning coal of sulfur and<br>
ash by contacting the coal with a hydrogen halide, such as HF (aqueous and/or<br>
anhydrous).<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,408,999 discloses beneficiating coal by subjecting the coal to<br>
electromagnetic radiation in the presence of a strong inorganic acid, such as<br>
hydrofluoric acid. In turn, U.S. Patent No. 4,305,726 discloses a chemical<br><br><br>
method of treating coal to remove ash and sulfur comprising treating the coal<br>
with hydrochloric and hypochlorous acid in the presence of ferric and ferrous<br>
sulfate, while U.S. Patent No. 4,328,002 discloses a method of treating coal to<br>
remove ash and sulfur involving preconditioning coal particles in the presence of<br>
an aqueous solution of an oxidant, such as H2O2 or HF, washing the so-treated<br>
coal, treating the washed coal with further oxidant and then passivating the coal<br>
with for example, an ammonium salt and then neutralizing with alkali metal<br>
hydroxide.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,516,980 discloses a process for producing low-ash, low sulfur<br>
coal by a two-stage alkaline treatment using sodium carbonate or bicarbonate as<br>
the reagent. The alkaline treated coal is then extracted with aqueous mineral<br>
acid; and U.S. Patent No. 3,998,604 discloses a coal demineralization process<br>
whereby ground coal is treated with aqueous acid, such as HCI, H2SO4 or H2CO3<br>
and then subjected to froth flotation in the presence of a gas selected from<br>
CI2,SO2, or CO2.<br>
In general, many inorganic acids can be used in the process of chemical<br>
leaching. Normally, the inorganic acid will be a strong acid such as hydrochloric<br>
acid, sulfuric acid, hydrofluoric acid, or nitric acid. Some of these acids will have<br>
a tendency to dissolve certain inorganic constituents preferentially to others and<br><br><br>
the actual acid used may depend upon the inorganic content of the<br>
carbonaceous material which is fed to the process. For example, hydrofluoric<br>
acid would be used when it is desired to remove silica. Hydrochloric acid or<br>
sulfuric acid alone may be used when it is desired to remove substantial portions<br>
of sulfur and other inorganic constituents. In general, the use of nitric acid is<br>
less desirable since it tends to oxidize the carbonaceous material. In some cases<br>
it may be preferable to use a mixture of acids in order to obtain complete<br>
solubilisation of the inorganic constituents. A combination of hydrochloric acid,<br>
nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid has been found to be a particularly effective<br>
mixture of acids.<br>
In general, it is preferable to use the acids in their strongest concentrations;<br>
however, in some cases more dilute aqueous solutions of the acids may be used.<br>
The actual amount of acid solution utilized is not critical as long as there is a<br>
sufficient amount present to retain the dissolved mineral matter in solution. But<br>
also most of these have got some disadvantages. For example, although HCI has<br>
been found effective in the removal of certain types of mineral matter from coal,<br>
processes that utilize HCI in any form run the risk of chlorinating the aromatic<br>
and heteroaromatic organic matrix found in coal. The chlorine cannot be<br>
removed from the chlorinated coals by simple washing or drying under vacuum.<br>
The corrosiveness of Chlorine liberated from combusted coal is well known. On<br><br><br>
the other hand, while it is also known that HF is very effective in removing silica<br>
and alumina from coal, it is not so effective in removing divalent alkali metals,<br>
such as calcium and magnesium. Furthermore, as also evidenced above, several<br>
prior art processes utilize oxidizing acids such as HNO3 and H2SO4. Although<br>
they may aid in the removal of mineral matter, they are also very capable of<br>
oxidizing the organic coal matrix, thereby decreasing the amount of volatile<br>
matter and the heating value of the coal.<br>
Several such processes have been developed. Besides, the amount and rate of<br>
removal of mineral matter from coal during chemical leaching process depend on<br>
various parameters such as type of mineral matter, percentage of mineral<br>
matter, porosity of coal, rank of coal, size of coal, reagents used for dissolution,<br>
time of dissolution, temperature, pressure etc.<br>
The present work on chemical cleaning process was aimed towards developing a<br>
process to produce low ash coal for coke making with high yield from high ash<br>
Indian coals. An effort was made to decrease the ash content up to ~ 5% in<br>
clean coal without deteriorating the coking properties. The process has been<br>
developed keeping in mind the high ash content and finely disseminated mineral<br>
matter content typical of Indian coals.<br><br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Leaching or solid extraction is done to dissolve mineral matter in coal using a<br>
solvent. The acidic and /or basic components present in mineral matter react<br>
with the solvents, gets dissolved and then removed. The present invention is a<br>
process of treating coals crushed to -30 to -72 BS mesh size (-0.25 to -0.50 mm)<br>
of fine clean coal obtained from flotation circuit coal for removal of ash-forming<br>
mineral which includes the steps of treating the coal in an aqueous alkaline<br>
solution at an elevated temperature under atmospheric pressure followed by<br>
reaction/extraction with an aqueous acidic solution. This is a process to produce<br>
low ash (~ 5% ash) clean coal for coke making from high ash Indian coals with<br>
80-85% yield. Known processes to produce low ash clean coal have been<br>
developed mostly for power plant and other uses. In the present invention, the<br>
process has been developed and evaluated for coke making. The process has<br>
been established in laboratory scale as well as in bench scale where up to 2 kg of<br>
coal can be treated. Besides, Present invention is a step towards making<br>
chemical leaching process economically feasible for coke making.<br>
The present invention will be better understood from the following description<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings in which<br><br><br>
Figure 1 represents photograph of experimental setup<br>
for the process in Laboratory scale.<br>
Figure 2 represents schematic diagram of experimental<br>
setup for the process in laboratory Scale.<br>
Figure 3 represents photograph of experimental setup<br>
for the process in bench scale.<br>
Figure 4 represents schematic diagram of experimental<br>
setup for the process in bench scale.<br>
The process was initially tried in laboratory scale. After successful<br>
experimentation and encouraging results, the process was also established using<br>
a bench scale unit where up to 2 kg of coal can be treated. In the first part of<br>
the description below, the methodology and results for the laboratory scale<br>
experimentations have been described. In the later part, the experimental<br>
procedure for the process using a bench scale reactor along with the test results<br>
has been stated.<br>
Laboratory Scale:<br><br><br>
Methodology of the claimed Process<br>
West Bokaro fine clean coal was taken initially as a feed sample to this process.<br>
This fine clean coal is generated in West Bokaro coal washery through froth<br>
flotation process. The feed sample can be taken directly as obtained after froth<br>
flotation treatment or can be crushed to -30 to -72 BS mesh size (-0.025 mm) for<br>
improving the kinetics of the process. Ash content of this coal sample was<br>
15.0%. This West Bokaro fine clean coal is referred herein as feed coal and the<br>
clean coal produced from this process is referred herein as Product. The major<br>
minerals normally found in coals are silicates or shales, quartz and / or<br>
sandstone, pyrites and carbonates such as siderites and ankerites. It has been<br>
found that even at 373° K using dilute to moderately concentrated NaOH<br>
solution, kaolin is converted into a crystalline sodium derivative i.e.<br>
Na2O.Al2O3.1.8SiO2. The solubility of this sodium-aluminium-silicate derivative is<br>
not very high in alkali solutions but it is fairly soluble in dilute alkali followed by<br>
washing with mineral acid.<br>
Sample Preparation:<br>
Small amount (around 50-200 g) of coal was taken through coning quartering<br>
method from the received West Bokaro fine clean coal. This coal sample was<br><br><br>
dried in an oven at 105° C. After drying the coal sample was cooled in a<br>
desiccator.<br>
Chemicals used<br>
The experiments were carried out with various chemicals initially. However,<br>
since the presence of acidic compounds like silica and alumina in Indian coals are<br>
significantly higher, some chemicals tend to behave better than other chemicals.<br>
Treating such coals using diute aqueous NaOH solution under mild conditions at<br>
atmospheric pressure followed by acid leaching / washing results in substantial<br>
demineralization of the coal. The alkali and acid used can be recovered for re-<br>
use. This affords a convenient method for coal demineralization. Commercially<br>
available sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in combination with sulphuric acid (H2SO4)<br>
and HCI were used in the present method.<br>
The treatment process<br>
The experiments for chemical leaching of captive coals were carried out using<br>
the experimental setup as shown in Figures 1 and 2. The equipment assembly<br>
consisted of a three-necked 1000 ml round bottom flask, which is the reactor<br>
(B). The main centre neck was utilized for assembling the motor and the<br>
attached stirrer (D). The speed of the motor for stirring was controlled through<br><br><br>
a variac. A condenser (C) was connected to one of the other two necks which,<br>
in turn, was connected to a conical flask with water (F) for trapping the volatile<br>
gases generated during the reaction. The third neck (E) is used to facilitate<br>
addition of reagents using a dropping funnel and also to monitor the<br>
temperature of the reaction bath using a thermometer. Rotamantle (A) was the<br>
source of heat input for the reactor to raise the temperature to the reaction<br>
temperature of 80-85° C. This rotamantle does a two-fold job of controlling the<br>
temperature as well as speed of the stirring (when the magnetic stirrer is used).<br>
Both these parameters can be controlled through the variacs.<br>
The experiments for chemical leaching were carried out in the reactor assembly<br>
using two steps. In the first step, feed coals (5-50 gm) were treated with<br>
varying concentration (10-50%) of alkali (NaOH) (100-500 ml) at 80 - 85° C<br>
under reflux with or without stirring for particular length of time (1.5-5.0 hr) in<br>
the three-necked round bottom flask (B). The treated coal is then washed<br>
repeatedly with water and / or HCI (100ml - 300 ml) and then dried. The<br>
washed alkali treated coal (10-50 gm) is then reacted with 10-20% H2SO4 / HCI<br>
(100-500 ml) for 1.0-4.0 hr keeping the same condition as described above.<br>
Then, the treated coal is filtered, washed with water and dried before sending<br>
for their chemical, rheological and petrographical properties.<br><br><br>
Results obtained in laboratory Scale Exterimentation<br>
The chemical leaching technology is available. The most important factor for the<br>
successful commercialization of the chemical cleaning of coal to produce low ash<br>
coal for coke making is the cost involved. The process described here is simple<br>
as it operates under mild conditions under atmospheric pressure. The cost of<br>
chemicals needed, particularly the alkali and acid, would make the process<br>
unattractive. Hence, efficient methods of regeneration, recovery and recycling of<br>
both alkali and acid have been suggested here. Some changes have been made<br>
towards optimizing the whole process and minimizing the cost involved. The<br>
process has been for West Bokaro fine clean coal. This invention is valid for<br>
other coals as well.<br>
The experiments for chemical leaching of coal to remove mineral matter were<br>
conducted various levels of reagent concentration, coal weight, coal to solution<br>
ratio and type of washing (only water or water and 10% HCI combined<br>
together). The samples were analyzed for ash, volatile matter, alkali content<br>
(Na2O &amp; K2O), ash constituents (Fe, CaO, SiO2, Al2O3, MgO, MnO, TiO2,<br>
phosphorous, Sulphur etc.), calorific value (kcal/kg), Crucible Swelling Number<br>
(CSN) and petrographical analysis {Reactive (Vitrinite+Semi-Vitrinite+Exinite),<br>
Inerts (Inertinite+Mineral matter) and Average Vitrinite Reflectance etc.}. Test<br><br>
results for West Bokaro fine clean coal (Table 1) are exemplified to express the<br>
effectiveness of this process and with improved result table 1 shows the test<br>
results with West Bokaro fine clean coal before and after the chemical treatment<br>
process.<br><br><br>
The chemical leaching in the first step, feed coals were treated also with Na2Co3<br>
followed by treatment with H2SO4 or by Nacl followed by H2SO4.<br>
The test results are exemplified in that case in Table 2 as follows.<br><br>
From the above tests results, it is clear that significant amount of<br>
demineralization takes place incase of WB fine clean coal during the alkali and<br>
acid leaching and acid washing steps. The same process steps were tried for<br>
Jamadoba fine clean coal, and West Bokaro run-of-mine (ROM) coal as well.<br><br>
Few important test results are depicted below in Table 3. Invention was<br>
validated in all the three cases which ensure that this process can be used for<br>
other high ash coals as well.<br>
Table 3: Test results with Jamadoba fine clean Coal and West Bokaro<br>
Run-of mine (ROM) coal before and after the chemical treatment<br>
process<br><br>
Alkali treatment, depending on coals mineralogical composition, concentration<br>
and treatment time, may either decrease or increase the ash content. The gain<br>
in ash content or decrease in degree of demineralization of the coal samples with<br><br>
increase in alkali concentration is attributed to sodium aluminosilicate formation.<br>
The ash reduction is due to dissolution of sulphate and other water-soluble<br>
components present in the coal samples. Alkali also reacts with silica and<br>
alumina in clay and other silica and alumina-bearing materials present in the coal<br>
forming soluble silicates and aluminates as per the following simplified reactions.<br><br>
The concentrations of silicate and aluminate ions in the solution gradually<br>
increase with alkali concentration and treatment time till the same exceed the<br>
solubility product of sparingly soluble sodium aluminosilicates. The later is<br>
precipitated as per the following simplified reaction:<br><br>
The gel may convert either to zeolite or felspathoid like sodalite, nosalite etc.<br>
depending on the alkali concentration. In literature, it has been reported that<br>
formation of insoluble sodium complex takes place during leaching of some high<br>
ash coal. Some researchers observed formation of hydroxy-sodalite<br>
Na6[AIO2]6(SiO2)6.xNaOH. (8 - 2X)H2O on treatment of kaolinite and illite type of<br>
clay with sodium hydroxide solution. Continuous decrease in ash removal or<br><br>
gain in ash with alkali concentration and reaction period is therefore attributed to<br>
progressive precipitation and accumulation of aluminosilicates. This can happen<br>
when more and more amount of silica and alumina from the coal dissolves out.<br>
With the negative effect of alkali concentration on removal of mineral matter<br>
being more with few coals, it may be presumed that these coals contain larger<br>
amount of alkali soluble silica and alumina than coals where ash reduction takes<br>
place even at higher level of alkali concentration. Demineralisation by alkali<br>
alone or followed by acid depend on the nature of the coal. The cation exchange<br>
capacity (CEC) of some of the alkali-treated coal samples continuously increases<br>
with alkali concentration suggesting continuous accumulation of sodium<br>
aluminosilicate. Sodium aluminosilicates can entrap water molecules, alkali and<br>
soluble salt, and the sodium ions in it are exchangeable. The alkali treatment<br>
also leads to removal of considerable amount of inorganic sulphur from the coal<br>
samples. The following reaction takes place during the alkali leaching:<br><br>
Digestion of the coal samples in water indicates that sulphate leaching takes<br>
place over a long period. The pH of the medium gradually decreases during<br>
digestion and it is accompanied by small increase in the amount of dissolved<br><br>
.<br>
iron. This also confirms loss of some sulphur through oxidation of pyrite. Similar<br>
reactions take place during the leaching steps which results in reduction in ash<br>
content of the coal samples.<br>
Mineral acids are effective in deminerallsation of coals to different extent.<br>
However, the best results are obtained when it is combined with alkali treatment.<br>
Sulphuric acid treatment or hydrochloric acid washing of the alkali treated coal<br>
results in significant reduction of mineral matter. The ash reduction is more than<br>
that achieved with non-treated coal and is obviously due to formation of<br>
additional acid soluble components during alkali treatment. The alkali treatment<br>
results in formation and precipitation of sodium aluminosilicates gel as explained,<br>
which subsequently undergoes decomposition and solubilisation in presence of<br>
acid soluble forming salts. The reduction in ash content on acid treatment of the<br>
alkali treated coal was found to increase with increase in concentration of alkali.<br>
This is attributed to increase in dissolution of silica and alumina and<br>
consequently amount of aluminosilicate formation.<br>
A positive change is noticed in the Alumina (Al2O3) to Silica (SiO2) ratio which<br>
plays an important role during the steel making process. Alumina to silica ratio<br>
reduced from 0.45 to ~ 0.33 suggesting percentage removal of alumina being<br>
more that that of silica. There is no significant change in the phosphorous<br><br><br>
content of the coal samples after the first step where the treatment is done only<br>
with alkali. However, a sharp decrease in phosphorous content is noticed after<br>
acid treatment. There is no significant change in the alkali content either after<br>
alkali treatment or after the acid treatment or acid wash steps proving there is<br>
no accumulation of Na2O or K2O during the process. A marginal reduction in<br>
sulphur content is also observed after the alkali and acid treatment. The sulphur<br>
content of WB and Jamadoba fine clean coals are not very high, which suggests<br>
most of the inorganic sulphur may already have been removed during the<br>
physical coal cleaning processes and hence the scope for removal of inorganic<br>
sulphur during the alkali-acid leaching process is low. The sulphur present may<br>
be of organic origin which is very difficult to leach out or remove. The increase<br>
in calorific value is expected because the decrease in mineral matter content of<br>
the coal samples due to leaching is associated with an increase in fixed carbon<br>
content which adds to the heating value.<br>
To study the influence of alkali-acid leaching process on captive coals, the<br>
Crucible Swelling Number (CSN) of the coal samples after the alkali and acid<br>
treatment were determined. The results suggest that CSN of WB fine clean<br>
coal (6.5) improves to 7.5 after H2SO4/HCI treatment when followed by NaOH<br>
treatment. This shows coal washings with aqueous acids have been effective in<br>
improving coking properties of coals. The process hence can be especially very<br><br><br>
effective for the conversion of lower-ranking coals including subbituminous coals.<br>
Even some of their inert minerals can be converted into fusible or reactive forms<br>
through the removal of ion-exchangeable cations. Addition of alkali aiso acts in a<br>
similar way by affecting the macromolecular structure of coal. However,<br>
structural change of coals in terms of such aggregate form of macromolecules,<br>
pores, and reactivity of oxygen functional groups by such pretreatment have not<br>
been fully clarified. Additives of inorganic substance (alkali/acid etc.) can<br>
influence the thermoplastic properties but the effect depends on the nature of<br>
the additive used, amount added and also on the structure of the parent coal.<br>
The WB fine clean coal samples before and after the chemical leaching are also<br>
evaluated for their petrographical properties. As expected, because of the<br>
reduction in mineral matter content of the coal samples after leaching, there is<br>
an increase in total reactives content and a decrease in total inerts content.<br>
Reductionin Inertinite content is seen in addition to the reduction in mineral<br>
matter contents. There is no significant change in the Avg. Vitrinite Reflectance<br>
(Ro) and vitrinite distribution (V9-V13)/petrographical make up.<br>

Methodology of the claimed Process<br><br><br>
Here also, West Bokaro fine clean coal (different sample than that was used in<br>
laboratory scale) was taken as a feed sample to this process initially. This fine<br>
clean coal is generated in West Bokaro coal washery through froth flotation<br>
process. The feed sample can be taken directly as obtained after froth flotation<br>
treatment or can be crushed to -72 BS mesh size (-0.025mm) for improving the<br>
kinetics of the process. Ash content of this coal sample was 13.1%. This West<br>
Bokaro fine clean coal is referred as feed coal and the clean coal produced from<br>
this process is referred as Product.<br>
Sample Preparation:<br>
1-2 kg of coal was taken through coning quartering method from the received<br>
West Bokaro fine clean coal. This coal sample was dried in an oven at 105° C to<br>
110° C.<br>
Chemicals Used:<br>
The experiments were carried out with various chemicals initially. However,<br>
since the presence of acidic compounds like silica and alumina in Indian coals are<br>
significantly higher, some chemicals tend to behave better than other chemicals.<br>
Treating such coals using dilute aqueous NaOH solution under mild conditions at<br>
atmospheric pressure followed by acid leaching/washing results in substantial<br><br><br>
demineralisation of the coal. The alkali and acid used can be recovered for re-<br>
use. This affords a convenient method for coal demineralization. Commercially<br>
available sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in combination with sulphuric acid (H2SO4)<br>
and HCI were used in the present method.<br>
The treatment process<br>
The manner of control of operation at reaction chamber through DAS, Host<br>
computer, TC and TT is described below.<br>
The bench scale unit consists of a batch reactor (1) of nearly 23 litres capacity<br>
with heating arrangements, condenser (2) with provision for reflux, the data<br>
acquisition and control system (DAS) - 3, sparkler horizontal filter (5). The<br>
reactor is heated with four heating coils of 1-kilowatt capacity each which are<br>
fitted outside the circumference of the reactor. A stirrer (6), which extends up to<br>
nearly 2 inch from the bottom of the reactor is fixed at the middle. A D.C. motor<br>
runs the stirrer and its speed can be measured using a sensor, which is mounted<br>
in front of the stirrer. It gives the stirrer speed by magnetic induction principle.<br>
The maximum rpm can go up to ~ 1500 and it can be controlled using a variac.<br>
However, the stirrer is usually operated at around 600 - 900 rpm. Prepared<br>
reagents are kept inside bottles at a height from the reactor from where those<br><br><br>
are fed to the reactor using a manifold, pipes and connectors. There is facility<br>
for filling the reactor with coal slurry using pipes.<br>
Three resistance temperature detectors (RTD) (not shown) are mounted at<br>
bottom and 4 inch and 8 inch from the bottom of the reactor. The resistance<br>
temperature detectors (RTD) at the bottom is connected to the PID controller (7)<br>
via a temperature transmitter TT (8) through which the temperature inside the<br>
reactor can be controlled using relay switches connected to the heaters. The<br>
four relay switches can also be controlled manually by switching the relays on or<br>
off. Remaining two RTDs are connected to the data acquisition module (3)<br>
through a signal conditioning element.<br>
There is a sensor (energy meter) (not shown) to sense the amount of current<br>
passing through the "Live wire" which provides electricity supply to the four<br>
heating coils. The output from this device (current data) is send to host<br>
computer (4).<br>
The temperature data from data acquisition module as well as controller, energy<br>
data etc can be seen on the host computer (4) through a graphical user interface<br>
developed particularly for this set up. The data acquisition modules, PID<br>
controller, signal conditioning elements, 24 V battery, variac and display unit of<br>
stirrer etc are placed inside a panel.<br><br><br>
The experiments for chemical leaching were carried out in the reactor assembly<br>
using two steps. In the first step, feed coals (1-2 kg) were treated with varying<br>
concentration (10-50%) of alkali (NaOH) (10 lit) or Na2CO3 / Nacl at varying<br>
temperatures under refulx with stirring for particular length of time (1.5-7.0 hr)<br>
in the bench scale reactor described above. The treated coal is then washed<br>
repeatedly with water and/or HCI and then dried. The washed alkali treated coal<br>
(10-50gm) is then reacted with 10-20% H2SO4/HCI for 1.0-5.0 hr keeping the<br>
same condition as described above. Then, the treated coal is filtered, washed<br>
with water and dried before sending for their chemical, rheological and<br>
petrographical properties.<br>
The coal to slurry ratio is maintained at 1:10 or 1:5 keeping the total volume 10<br>
liters. The moment the feed is fed to the reactor, the stirrer and the data<br>
acquisition system are switched on. The readings are checked in the host<br>
computer using the GUI to ensure the proper working of the sensors. Once<br>
checked, the datas are capture using the save command which saves the data to<br>
a text file.<br>
At the start of the experiment all the four heaters are switched on. Any of the<br>
four heaters can be switched on or off basing on requirement. For example,<br><br><br>
once the set point is reached, the set temperature can be controlled using only<br>
one heater. During the test, intermediate samples can be collected any time<br>
from the sampling pipe present at the bottom of the reactor. Different amount<br>
of sample can be collected at various length of time during the test basing on<br>
subsequent analysis to be one with the samples. The samples collected can be<br>
washed with water and/or 10-20% HCI/H2SO4 solution. These samples are dried<br>
and analyzed for various properties.<br>
After the completion of the experiment, the remaining sample present inside the<br>
reactor is taken out from the bottom and filtered using the sparkler horizontal<br>
filter. The filter cake is dried inside a drying oven and analyzed for various<br>
properties. Multi-stage experiments as well as intermediate dosing experiments<br>
were also carried out using the experimental set up.<br>
The experiments for chemical leaching of coal to remove mineral matter were<br>
conducted at various levels of reagent concentration, coal weight, coal to<br>
solution ratio and type of washing (only water or water and 10-20% H2SO4/HCI<br>
combined together). The samples were analyzed for ash, volatile matter, alkali<br>
content (Na2O &amp; K2O), ash constituents (Fe, CaO, SiO2, Al2O3, MgO, MnO, TiO2,<br>
phosphorous, and Sulphur etc.), calorific value (kcal/kg) and Crucible Swelling<br>
Number (CSN) etc. Using this set up when chemical treatment of West Bokaro<br>
fine clean coal were carried out, the ash content reduced from 13.1 % to nearly<br><br><br>
5.0%. All the test results obtained were similar to those obtained with the<br>
laboratory scale set up. The crucible swelling number (CSN) improved from 6.5<br>
to 7.5. Nearly 50% silica and 75% alumina can be removed from coal using this<br>
process. The alkali content in the product remained nearly same as that of the<br>
feed.<br>
Experiments were also carried out for Jamadoba fine clean coal, West Bokaro<br>
run-of-mine (ROM) coal, West Bokaro Middling samples. Invention was validated<br>
in all the four cases which prove that this process can be used for other coals as<br>
well. Detail thermodynamic and kinetic study as well as energy requirement for<br>
this process was evaluated using the bench scale unit. This will help in<br>
optimization as well as scaling up the chemical leaching process to commercial<br>
scale and low ash coal can be produced economically for coke making.<br>
Despite the incongruity of the words 'ultra clean' and 'coal', they can't help but<br>
resonate when coupled together. The most important factor for the successful<br>
commercialization of the chemical cleaning of coal to produce low ash coal is the<br>
cost involved. The process is simple as it operates under mild conditions under<br>
atmospheric pressure, but the cost of chemicals needed, particularly the alkali<br>
and acid, would make the process unattractive. Hence, efficient methods of<br>
regeneration, recovery and recycling of both alkali and acid are suggested here.<br>
The dissolved minerals after chemical leaching can be precipitated as gypsum<br><br>
and aluminium silicates, which can be used in the building and ceramics<br>
industries, white the alkalis/acids can be regenerated for reuse. Alkali can be<br>
regenerated by reacting with lime, where as acid can be regenerated by<br>
distillation or by treating the silicic acid produced with gypsum.<br><br>
The regenerated alkali can be concentrated to desired level using a multiple<br>
effect evaporator. The acid treatment process can be eliminated here by just the<br>
acid washing step as both produce product with almost same level of ash<br>
content which will substantially reduce the process operating cost and acid<br>
regeneration difficulty.<br>

various modifications, alterations and adaptations are possible within the scope<br>
and ambit of the invention as defined in the encompassed appended claims.<br><br><br>
