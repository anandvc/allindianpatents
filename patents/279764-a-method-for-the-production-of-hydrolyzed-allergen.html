				<td>A method for the production of hvdrolyzed allergen<br>
The present invention is related to a method for the production of extracts of natural allergens, peptides from these extracts and allergen extracts obtainable by the new method.<br>
Common allergens are pollens, house dust mites, moulds, drugs, foods and animal hair and dander.<br>
The most common allergy diseases are rhinitis, asthma and atopic dermatitis. Allergic asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder. Symptomatic treatment of allergic disorders is effected by use of antihistaminics, G-antogonists and corticosteroids.<br>
Furthermore, the so called "specific" immunotherapy is based on a hyposensitization. Typically patients are administered with subcutaneous injection of the specific offending allergens. Treatment is started with small allergen doses and the doses are increased. Treatment is typically maintained for several years. This type of treatment suffers from pure patient compliance and has been questioned due to safety reasons because a patient can suffer from severe anaphylactic reactions.<br>
In addition to methods comprising repeated subcutaneous injections there are also oral hyposensitization methods.<br>
US 4,822,611 discloses a method for treating allergies comprising oral treatment with allergens. It describes the use of commercially available "bulk" allergenic extracts showing batch-to-batch variation and differences in extracts from different manufactures. The preparation of these extracts is not described.<br>
GB 1 247 614 discloses a method of extracting an allergen. The aim of this method is to have a more complete and effective allergenic extract by including all extractable components of the allergen.<br>
US 5,770,698 discloses a process for purifying extracts of allergenically active proteins. The spectrum of figure 2 does not present a peak at 280nm- This implies that the extract contains significant amount on non-protein impurities. WO 99/22762 discloses a similar method, therefore, the product comprises large amounts of non-protein impurities, too.<br>
On the other hand, there has been a tendency to develop highly specific preparations based on single epitopes. For example, WO 00/58349 discloses an isolated and purified peptide comprising a leucin positioned two peptide bonds away from a tyrosine/arginine pair. These peptides can be used to prepare a pharmaceutical composition to accomplish treatment or prophylaxis, in this case especially directed to canine allergy in dogs.<br>
On the one hand, methods are used to purify a specifically identified single allergenic molecule. On the other hand, people are trying to produce allergenic extracts as complete as possible.<br>
According to the first alternative, it is always possible that the allergen preparation lacks the relevant epitopes to induce tolerance in a determined patient. The second alternative has a drawback of batch-to-batch variability and of the presence of compounds able to trigger immune response like DNA molecules, carbohydrates, lipids of complexes thereof.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to overcome at least some of the drawbacks of prior art, especially to provide antigens from natural allergens with a significant reduced capability to trigger allergenicity reaction compared to the crude allergen extract but able to stimulate T-cells as well.<br>
The problem is solved by the provision of methods for preparing an allergen extract comprising most of the protein containing parts of an allergen extract but with a reduced, preferably very low content of non-protein components such as nucleic acids, lipids, sugars and the like.<br>
The extracts prepared according to the invention are superior to extracts of prior art, especially do they show a reproducible composition of proteins but are not purified to a single epitope.<br>
The method for the production of the allergen extract of the present invention comprises the steps of<br>
a)	extracting a natural source of allergens comprising allergenic proteins to form an extract,<br>
b)	purifying of said extract to remove non-protein components to form a purified extract<br>
c)	denaturating said purified extract to form a purified denaturated extract,<br>
said purified denaturated extract comprising proteins, wherein the most abundant (w/w) proteins, forming together at least 60% (w/w) of all proteins, are at least two proteins, and all proteins represent at least 60% (w/w) of the dry weight of the purified denaturated extract.<br>
This method is referred to as method I.<br>
In contrast to the methods of prior art, the method of the present invention produces allergen extracts which comprise predominantly proteins without purifying the extract to a single peptide or protein.<br>
In contrast to the products of prior art the products of the invention have following advantages:<br>
-	Immunogenic substances other than proteins are substantially removed<br>
-	The natural allergen extract is able to stimulate T-cell with the reduced ability to trigger immediate allergic reaction (basophile activation, mast cell de-granulation)<br>
As starting materials different natural occurring allergens can be used. Typical natural starting materials are milk, venom, egg, weed, grass, tree, shrub, flower, vegetable, grain, fungi, fruit, berry, nut, seed, bean, fish, shellfish, seafood, meat,<br>
spices, insect, mite, mould, animal, pigeon tick, worm, soft coral, animal dander, nematode, Hevea brasiliensis, and mixtures thereof.<br>
After extraction of the material, the extract is purified to remove non-protein components such as sugars, lipids, nucleic acids and the like. Typical, several different proteins are present in the protein fraction of the purified extract.<br>
According to prior art, one protein is purified and the other remaining proteins are "impurities".<br>
In contrast thereto, it is the aim of the present invention to purify the proteins together. The relative amounts of the proteins in the purified extract can be easily measured using methods like SDS-PAGE followed by densitometry.<br>
For 60% of total weight of the proteins, it is necessary to combine the two most dominant proteins at least, i.e. no single protein is 60% (w/w) or more of all proteins. More preferably, 60% of all proteins are formed by the at least 3 dominant proteins, preferably by the at least 4 dominant proteins and more preferably by at least 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 proteins.<br>
For example, there are the following proteins:<br>
<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
The most dominant proteins forming together at least 60% (~ 60% or more) are proteins 3+1 (34+27=61%).<br>
Furthermore, the total protein content of the purified extract is at least 60% by weight, preferably the content is at least 70% by weight or 80% by weight, more preferably 90% by weight of the purified extract.<br>
Extraction is preferably performed with aqueous solutions. Suitable salts are salts such as but not restricted to carbonate, bicarbonate, phosphate, acetate, TRIS and HEPES.<br>
Also in contrast to many other extraction methods, it is preferred that the amount of extraction medium is comparatively large, i.e. at least 20 times the weight of the natural source of allergens, preferably 100 time the weight or more.<br>
Purifying of the extract may be performed by one or more of the following:<br>
-	ion exchange chromatography steps (including anion exchange chromatography and cation exchange chromatography),<br>
-	size exclusion chromatography step (also called gel filtration),<br>
-	precipitation steps,<br>
-	hydrophobic interaction chromatography steps,<br>
-	pseudo-affinity and affinity chromatographies and/or<br>
-	diafiltration.<br>
In a preferred embodiment ion exchange chromatography is used wherein in case of a cation exchanger the loading solution has a pH between the pKa of the acidic function of the cation exchanger and the pKa of the protein having the lowest pKa of the proteins in the extract. In case of an anion exchanger the pH is between the pKa of the basic function of the anion exchanger and the pKa of the protein having the highest pKa of the proteins constituting the extract.<br>
Through this method all proteins bind to the ion exchanger while the neutral impurities and the impurities with the same charge as the ion exchange resin will be removed.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, at least one purification step is performed with a solution comprising one or more of a tenside and/or a denaturating agent. The tenside may be non-ionic, anionic, cationic or amphoteric. Suitable denaturating agents are chaotropic agents, reducing agents and mixtures thereof. Suitable<br>
denaturating agents are for example urea, guanidinium chloride, ethylene glycol, isopropanol. A suitable concentration of urea is 3 M or more, preferably 4 M or more. A suitable concentration of guanidinium is preferably 2 M, preferably 3 M or more. A suitable concentration of ethylene glycol and/or isopropanol is 5% or more, more preferably 10% or more, up to 20% by weight.<br>
In some cases, the production of the purified extract according to the method I of the invention is sufficient. Extracts of this type may be used to produce ex vivo I in vivo and in vitro diagnosis, prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of allergic diseases. A further embodiment of the present invention is a method for the production of an allergen hydrolysate, either from extracts according to method I or from any other source. If the extract comes from any other source of purified allergens than method I, one preliminary step of denaturation is required in order to improve digestibility.<br>
The method (method II) comprises the steps of<br>
a)	hydrolysing a denaturated allergen to form an allergen hydrolysate,<br>
b)	purifying said allergen hydrolysate to remove peptides with a molecular weight above 10,000 Da and below 1,000 Da in order to obtain a purified hydrolysate wherein 70%, more preferably 80% of the peptides are between 10,000 Da and 1,000 Da.<br>
The advantages of the product obtained thereby are that the peptides are the digestion result of denaturated proteins. Due to a specified size calibration they have a reduced potency to induce immediate allergic reaction and proinflammatory reaction as well.<br>
Denaturating, if necessary is preferably performed in the presence of chaotropic agents, reducing agents or mixtures thereof. Suitable chaotropic agents are for example urea and guanidinium chloride. Typical reducing agents are for example dithiotriethol, B-mercaptoethanol, thio-glycerol and mixtures thereof.<br>
The hydrolysing step is typically performed with an enzyme. Suitable enzymes are for example pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin. This hydrolyzing step can be performed in the presence of a chaotropic agent, preferably urea or guanidinium chloride, too. During hydrolysing the concentration of urea and guanidinium chloride should be below 4 M, preferably below 3M.<br>
In step b) of method II, peptides with a molecular weight larger than 10,000 Da or smaller than 1,000 Da, are removed.<br>
The peptides of the purified hydrolysate, therefore, comprise peptides with a molecular weights between 1,000 and 10,000 Da. Suitable methods for removing large or small peptides are ultrafiltration and size exclusion chromatography. Again this size exclusion chromatography may be performed in the presence of a chaotropic agents, for example urea, guanidinium chloride, ethylene glycol, iso-propanol and mixtures thereof.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention is an allergen extract obtainable by methods I of the present invention. Typically also in this extract the most dominant proteins by weight, which form together at least 60% by weight of all the proteins, are at least 2 proteins, preferably at least 3 or 4 proteins or more preferred at least 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 proteins. The purity is seen by a Optical Density 260nm: Optical Density 280nm-ratio of 
A further embodiment is an allergen hydrolysate obtainable by method II. It can be used for<br>
-	in vivo diagnosis of allergic diseases: prick tests, intracutaneous injections, conjonctival, sniff and inhalation tests<br>
-	ex vivo and in vitro diagnosis of allergic diseases: ELISA kits or standards to be used in tests<br>
- Prophylatic and therapeutic treatments of allergic diseases: vaccine for de-sensitization/hyposensitization treatments and modulation of immune response with/without adjuvant combination.<br>
The allergen extract of the present invention can be used for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition and/or food composition for inducing tolerance. Induction of tolerance can be used to cure or prevent allergic reactions.<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising the allergen extract of the present invention either in complete form or in hydrolyzed form. Additionally, pharmaceutical composition may comprise one or more of the following substances: nucleoside triphosphates, nucleoside diphosphates, nucleoside monophosphates, nucleic acids, peptide nucleic acids, nucleosides or analogs thereof, immunosuppressive cytokines, compounds inducing expression of immunoproteasomes, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or analogs thereof, lipopolysaccharides, endotoxins, heat shock proteins, thioredoxin with either NADPH or NADP-thioredoxin reductase, dithiothreitol, adrenergic receptor agonists such as salbutanol, adrenergic receptor antagonists such as butoxamine, compounds that regulate the expression of the adhesion molecule ICAM-1, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, y-L-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl-glycine (reduced L-glutathione), alpha-2-macroglobulins, inducers for Foxp3 gene expression, flavonoids, isoflavonoids, pterocarpanoids, stilbenes such as resveratrol, tachykinin receptor antagonists, chymase inhibitors, vaccine adjuvant like CpG or MPL or tolerogenic adjuvant like zymosan, beta-l,3-glucan, regulatory T-cell inducer, a muco-adhesive agent for attaching the particle to the intestinal mucosal lining such as a plant lectin, zinc, zinc salts, polysaccharides, vitamins and bacterial lysates.<br>
Based on the source of natural allergens in the composition may comprise allergens selected among pollen allergens, milk allergens, venom allergens, egg allergens, weed allergens, grass allergens, tree allergens, shrub allergens, flower allergens, vegetable allergens, grain allergens, fungi allergens, fruit allergens, berry allergens, nut allergens, seed allergens, bean allergens, fish allergens, shellfish allergens, seafood allergens, meat allergens, spices allergens, insect allergens, mite alter-<br>

Blood samples from pollen allergic volunteers were incubated with increasing concentrations (0, 1, 10, 100 and 1000 ng/ml) of either pollen crude extract, pollen purified proteins and pollen purified peptides. gp53 protein expression was measured by flow cytometry with gating on IgE-positive leukocytes. Results are expressed as % of gp53 positive cells in activated cells (mean ± deviation of 2 determinations).<br>
Figure 10: Stimulation of human PBMC proliferation bv pollen proteins and pollen peptides. Human PBMC purified from pollen allergic volunteers were incubated 5 days at 37°C in the presence of increasing concentrations (10 30 and 90 ug/ml) of pollen proteins or pollen peptides. [3H]-Thymidine was added to the cell culture for 16 hours and the incorporation of [3H]-Thymidine was measured with a beta counter using the principle of liquid scintillation. Results are expressed as mean of 5 determinations. The method of the present invention is further exemplified by the following, non-limiting examples.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1: Extraction<br>
1% (w/v) pollen {Lolium perenne from ALLERGON) was added to sodium bicarbonate (12.5 mM) and incubated 2 h under stirring. The solution was then clarified and filtrated by adding celite (ACROS) at 2% (w/v) and passing through a 0.2 urn filter. This sample constitutes the crude extract.<br>
The presence of allergens in the extract was analyzed by western blotting using pollen allergic patient sera. IgG and IgE epitopes are visualised with anti-human IgG or IgE antibodies.<br>
As shown on figure 1 and 2, there are two major allergens in the extract.<br>
The said crude extract was acidified to pH 3.0 and Tween 20 (0.1%, v/v) was added. This sample constitutes the acidified extract.<br>
Example 2: Purification of allergen proteins<br>
The allergen extract was purified by:<br>
-	Cation exchange chromatography<br>
A sartobind S" membrane (SARTORIUS) was equilibrated with 28x Bed volume (Bv) of sodium bicarbonate 12.5 mM, citrate 30 mM, pH 3.0, Tween 20 0.1% (v/v). The said acidified extract was loaded on the equilibrated membrane. The column was washed first with 35x Bv of sodium bicarbonate 12.5 mM, citrate 30 mM, pH 3.0, Tween 20 0.1% (v/v) and then washed with 42x Bv of sodium bicarbonate 12.5 mM, citrate 30 mM, pH 3.0. The proteins were eluted with carbonate 0.1 M, sodium chloride 0.5 M, pH 9.15. The presence of proteins was followed the OD at 280 nm. The fractions of interest were pooled.<br>
-	Ammonium sulfate precipitation<br>
This step was performed at 0-4°C.<br>
A quantity of ammonium sulfate to reach 90% of saturation was added to the product under stirring. The stirring was stopped after the complete dissolution of the salt. The suspension was incubated overnight and centrifuged 2 times during 15 min at 10,000 g. The supernatant was each time carefully discarded.<br>
-	Denaturation<br>
The pellets were resuspended at 9 mg/ml in urea 6 M, DTT 10 mM, Tris.HCI 0.1 M, pH 8.0 and incubated at 37°C for 1 h.<br>
-	Size    exclusion    chromatography    on    G25    resin    (fine    Sephadex    from<br>
AMERSHAM)<br>
The denatured sample was loaded on the column and the proteins were eluted with Tris.HCI 25 mM, urea 1.5 M, pH 8.0.<br>
The presence of proteins was followed by the OD measurement at 280 nm The fractions of interest were pooled to constitute the purifed denaturated allergen extract.<br>
The purified allergen extract was further analysed. The protein content (BCA Assay) and the dry weight were determined in order to evaluate the protein purity. The purification efficiency was also followed by the removal of carbohydrates (Orcinol test) and by the decrease of the ratio OD26o / OD28o.<br>
Table 1: Removal of non-protein components to form a purified extract<br>
<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
As shown in table 1, the purification process allows<br>
-	The increase of the percentage of proteins in the extract from ~ 15% to 80%<br>
-	The OD26o/OD28o ratio to tends towards 0.5 characterizing a pure protein<br>
-   A significant removal of carbohydrates (the residual content could represent the carbohydrate moiety of the proteins).<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a typical SDS-PAGE profile obtained for the purified denatu-rated allergen extract. As can be seen, 6 proteins represent at least 60% of the total weight of the proteins in the purified extract.<br>
Example 3: Hydrolysis of denatured allergen extract<br>
The extract was hydrolyzed using the following protocol :<br>
The said purified allergen extract was acidified to pH 2.0. The digestion was performed at 2.5 mg/ml of pollen proteins and 1 Eu. Ph. U of pepsin (MERCK) for 337 mg of proteins, at 37°C, during 2 h.<br>
Figure 5 shows a comparison between the purified extract (lane 2) and the hydrolyzed extract (lane 3). As can be seen, high molecular weight proteins corresponding to denatured undigested proteins have disappeared after the incubation with pepsin.<br>
Example 4: Purification<br>
In order to eliminate the peptides with a MW &gt; 10,000 Da and MW 
-	Size exclusion chromatography on G50 resin (fine Sephadex from AMERSHAM) 16.5 % (v/v) of isopropanol and 0.1 M of NaCI were added to the hydrolysate. This sample was immediately loaded on a G50 column. The peptides were elu-ted and the fractions containing the peptides (MW 
-	Diafiltration on IkDa membrane (ultrafiltation cassette Omega PES from PALL) The  peptides  were  concentrated   10  x,   diafiltrated   against  10  volumes  of Tris.HCI 50 mM pH 7.4 and finally concentrated 2.5 x. This sample constitutes the purified allergen hydrolysate.<br>
The efficiency of the purification was controlled by size exclusion HPLC. A BioSep-SEC S2000 column (PHENOMENEX) was equilibrated with Na2HPO„ 50 mM - SDS 0.5% (w/v) pH 6.8 at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The peptides were detected at 214 nm.<br>
The 10 kDa and 1 kDa limits were calculated from a calibration curve as exemplified in figure 7.<br>
As shown on figure 8, peptides with a molecular weight between 1,000 Da and 10,000 Da represent about 75% of all peptides in the purified hydrolysate.<br>
Example 5: Decrease of allergenicity<br>
Allergenicity properties of the pollen crude extract (according to example 1), purified pollen proteins (according to example 2) and purified pollen peptides (according to example 4) were assessed by measuring their capacity to induce basophile degranulation.<br>
The test was performed in vitro on fresh human blood samples from pollen allergic volunteers incubated with increasing concentrations of pollen crude extract, purified proteins and purified peptides. Basophile degranulation was assessed by measuring, by flow cytometric method, the expression of the gp53 protein marker on the cell membrane of activated cells (i.e. IgE positive cells). This protein is normally present within the membrane of the granules in resting cells and appears on the cell surface upon cell activation (due to the fusion of the granule membrane with the cytoplasmic membrane). It therefore becomes detectable by labeled specific anti-gp53 antibodies. As shown on figure 9, purified peptides are about 30x less allergenic than purified proteins and lOOx less allergenic than pollen crude extract.<br>
Example 6 : Immunogenicity of the pollen proteins and pollen peptides<br>
The immunogenicity of the allergen proteins and peptides was studied by measuring their ability to stimulate human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation.<br>
PBMC purified from blood sample from "pollen-allergic" volunteers by density gradient centrifugation were cultured 5 days in 96-well plates in the presence of increasing concentrations of pollen proteins and pollen peptides. On day 5, [3H]-Thymidine was added to the cell culture and the plates were further incubated at 37°C for 16 hours. Incorporation of [3H]-Thymidine was measured with a beta counter using the principle of liquid scintillation.<br>
Pollen proteins (according to example 2) and pollen peptides (according to example 4) stimulate the proliferation of human PBMC in a dose concentration dependant way. Proliferation induced by allergen peptides is slightly lower than that observed in response to proteins. These results show that the process of peptide production conserves most of the epitopes of the allergen implicated in T cell activation.<br>
