3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION:<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in<br>
which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]      This application claims priority under 35 U.S.G. " 19 (a) from Korean Patent Application No. 10-2008-0016469, filed on February 22, 2008, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of  the invention<br>
[0002]      The present invention relates to an image forming apparatus, and more particularly, to a developing device in. an image forming, apparatus having, the same.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
[0003]      An forming apparatus, such as, for example, a printer, a photocopier, a facsimile machine, a multifunction peripheral, or the like, performs printing of images using developer.    After repeated printing operations, the developer may be used up, and thus may need to be replenished.<br>
[0004]      To replenish, a developing cartridge containing storing the developer therein may need to be replaced. However, the developing cartridge may also include other components, such as, e.g., a developing roller and/or a supply roller, which may have relatively longer useful life.    Replacement of the developing cartridge for the purpose of developer replenishment may thus be uneconomical.<br>
[0005]      The present applicants have contemporaneously herewith suggested a separable type developing cartridge with a removable developer cartridge that allows the developer to be replenished with replacement of only the removable developer cartridge.    However, ,while the removable developer cartridge may alleviate the need for unnecessary replacement of the entire developing cartridge, the replacement of the removable developer cartridge may become messy as remaining developer often leaks<br>

[0087] The first transfer opening ] 22 serves as an outlet through which the developer is discharged from the developer cartridge 121. and the second transfer opening 116 serves as an inlet through which the developer flows into the developing cartridge 110.<br>
[0088]      The developer cartridge 121 may have a developer transfer member 124 rotatably formed therein to transfer the developer from the developer cartridge 121 to the supply path Tl through the first transfer opening 122.<br>
[0089]      The collecting path T2 may include third and fourth transfer openings 117 and 123, which are formed in the developing cartridge 110 and in the developer cartridge 121, respectively, such that they face, and fluidly communicate with, each other if the developer cartridge 121 is mounted in the developing cartridge 110.<br>
[0090]      The third transfer opening 117 serves as the waste developer outlet, through which the waste developer is discharged from the developing cartridge 110, and the fourth transfer opening 123 serves as the waste developer inlet, through which the waste developer flows into the developer cartridge 121.<br>
[0091]      The waste developer is developer that has been cleaned off the photoconductive medium 20 by the cleaning blade 21, and, as shown in FIGS 2 and 3, is transferred to the collecting path T2 by waste developer transferring mechanism 22. The waste developer transferring mechanism 22 may include a waste developer transfer member 23 and a waste developer transfer pipe 24.<br>
[0092]      According to an embodiment, the supply path Tl and the collecting path T2 are formed in the proximity of the entering or leading end and an exiting or trailing end of the developer cartridge 121, respectively, with reference to the mounting direction of the developer cartridge 121.<br>
[0093]      The shutter units 130 opens the developer transfer paths Tl and T2 only if the developer cartridge 121 is mounted in the developing cartridge 110. That is, the shutter units 130 opens both the supply path Tl and the collecting path T2 if the developer cartridge 121 is mounted in the developing<br>
17<br><br>
cartridge 110, and conversely, closes both of them if the developer cartridge 121 is removed from the developing cartridge 1 ] 0.<br>
[0094] As shown in FIGS. 5A through 10, the shutter unit 130 includes first through fourth shutter members 131, 132, 133, 134 corresponding to the first through fourth transfer openings 122, 116, 117, 123.<br>
♦<br>
[0095]      More specifically, as shown in FIGS. 5A through 6C, the first and the second shutter members 131, 132 are disposed in the developer cartridge 121 and the developing cartridge 110, respectively, to open and close the first and the second transfer openings 122 and 116, respectively.    As shown in FIGS. 8A through 9, the third and the fourth shutter members 133 and 134 are disposed in the developing cartridge 110 and the developer cartridge 121, respectively, to open and close the third and the fourth transfer openings 117 and 123, respectively.<br>
[0096]      The first, the second, and the fourth shutter members 131, 132, 134 open the first, the second, and the fourth transfer openings 122, 116, 123 if the developer cartridge 121 is mounted in the mounting recess 110a of the developing cartridge 110 in the first direction Rl. Also, the third shutter member 133 opens the third transfer opening 116 if the developing cartridge 110 is mounted in the image forming apparatus body 10 in the second direction R2.<br>
[0097]      The first through fourth shutter members 131, 132, 133, 134 described above are elastically supported by first through fourth elastic members 135, 136, 137, 138, respectively, in directions of closing the first through the fourth transfer openings 122, 116, 117, 123.<br>
[0098]      As shown in FIGS. 5Athrough 6C, when the developer cartridge 121 is mounted in the developing cartridge 110, the first shutter member 131 is prevented from moving further in the direction Rl by the locking projection 131b formed in the proximity of the second transfer opening 116 of the developing cartridge 110, thereby opening the first transfer opening 122 . That is, although the developer<br>
18<br><br>
cartridge 121 moves in the first direction Rl, the first shutter member 131 is interfered by the locking projection 131b, and does not move In the first direction Rl such that the first transfer opening 122 ofthe developer cartridge 121 is opened.<br>
[0099]      The end of he first shutter member 131, which is brought into contact with the locking projection 131b. is bent toward the developing cartridge 110 while the other end is supported by the first elastic member 135.<br>
[00100]    On the locking projection 131b is disposed a guide lever 140 which is rotated by the interference from the developer cartridge 121, and which assists the first shutter member 131 in opening and closing the first transfer opening 122. The guide lever 140 includes first and second wings 141 and 142 rotating about a rotary shaft 140a and a pressure protrusion 143.<br>
[00101]    The first wing 141 is rotated by the bent end of the first shutter member 131 in the first direction Rl, and, as shown in FIG. 5C, has a length such that the first wing 141 is brought into contact with the bottom 121c of the developer cartridge 121 facing the developing cartridge 110.<br>
[00102]   The second wing 142 may have a shorter length than that of the first wing 141, and may be spaced from the first wing 141 at a predetermined angle. Therefore, the second wing 142 is not brought into contact with the bottom 121c ofthe developer cartridge 121 when rotated to the position shown in FIG 5C.<br>
[00103]    The pressure protrusion 143 protrudes from the second wing 142 and presses the one end of the first shutter member 131 in the first direction Rl if the first wing 141 is brought into contact with the bottom ofthe developer cartridge 121.<br>
[00104]    As shown in FIGS. 5A through 5C, the second shutter member 132 is interfered by a leading end 121a of the eveloper cartridge 121 with reference to the first direction Rl, and thus moves in the first direction Rl, thereby opening the second transfer opening 116.<br>
19<br><br>
to the mounting direction R1 by means of a locking protrusion 134a formed on the developing cartridge 310, thereby opening the fourth opening 123.<br>
[00109]    Hereinafter, operations of opening and closing the supply path and the collecting path between the developing cartridge and the developer cartridge of the image forming apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 2 through 10.<br>
[00110]    Referring to FIG. 4, if the developer cartridge 121 enters the mounting recess 110a of the developing cartridge 110 in the direction Rl, as shown in FIGS. 5A through 5C, the bent end 131a of the first shutter member 131 is brought into contact with the locking projection 131b and thus is prevented from entering further in the first direction Rl. At this time, the bent end 131a of the first shutter member 131 is also brought into contact with the first wing 141 of the guide lever 140 and thus rotates the first wing 141 in the first direction Rl as shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B.<br>
[00111]    Although the first shutter member 131 is prevented from moving further in the first direction Rl by the locking projection 131b, the developer cartridge 121 continues to enter in the first direction Rl and thus moves the second shutter member 132 which is in contact with the leading end 121a of the developer cartridge 121 in the first direction Rl.<br>
[00112]    Consequently, as shown in FIG. 5C, the first and the second transfer openings 122 are 116 are opened by the first and the second shutter members 131 and 132 such that the supply path Tl for transferring the developer from the developer cartridge 121 to the developing cartridge 110 is open.<br>
[00113]    The first wing 141, which has rotated in contact with one end of the first shutter member 131 in the first direction Rl, is in contact with the bottom of the developer cartridge 121 and is prevented from rotating in the first direction Rl as shown in FIG 5C. Accordingly, the one end of the first shutter member 131 is released from the contact with the first wing 141, and, instead, is brought into contact with the pressure protrusion 143 protruding from the second wing 142 spaced from the first wing 141 by a<br>
21<br><br>
predetermined angle.<br>
[00114]   Consequently, the bent end 131 a of the first shutter member131fixedly at the location between the locking projection 131b and the pressure protrusion 143 such  the first shutter member 131 is fixed at the position of opening the first transfer opening 122:,<br>
[00115]    Ifthe developer cartridge 121 further enters the mounting recess 110a in the first direction Rl. as shown in FIGS. 7 through 8B, the fourth shutter member 134 is brought into contact with the locking protrusion 134a formed on the developing cartridge 110, and thus movesn the direction R3 opposite the mounting direction Rl, thereby opening the fourth transfer opening 123.<br>
[00116]    If the developer cartridge 121 is completely mounted in the developing cartridge 110, the first, the second, and the fourth transfer openings 122, 116 and 123 are a by the first, the second and the fourth shutter members 131. 132 and 134, respectively.<br>
[00117]    Subsequently as shown in FIGS. 9 and 10, the developing cartridge 110 enters the image forming apparatus body 10 in the second direction R2 with the developerridge 121 mounted therein. At this time, the interference member 133a protruding from the thir shutter member 133 to protrude from the developing cartridge 110 is brought into contact with the irimageing apparatus body 10, thereby moving the third shutter member 133 in the first direction R1  The third transfer opening 116 becomes open by the third shutter member 133 such that the develop supply path Tl and the collecting path T2 between the developer cartridge 121 and the developing cartridge 110 are all open.<br>
[00118]    According to the above-described configuration, the first and the second shutter members 131 and 132 open the first and the second transfer openings 122 and 116 jn sequence in association with the mounting operation of the developer cartridge 121, and then, the .fourth transfer opening 123 of the developer cartridge 121 is opened by the fourth shutter member 134 After that, as the developing cartridge 110 is mounted in the image forming apparatus body 10, the third transfer opening 117 is<br>
22<br><br>
opened by the third shutter member ] 33 such that the developer collecting path T2 is finally opened. That is. the shutter units 130 opens the developer supply path T1 first, and then opens the developer collecting path 12.<br>
[00119]    If the developer in the developer cartridge 121 is exhausted, and needed to be replaced, as shown in FIG. 10, the developing cartridge 110 is dismounted from the image forming apparatus body 10 in a direction R4 opposite to the second direction R2. at which time, the interference member 133a is released from the interference force from the image forming apparatus body 10 such that the interference member 133a is restored to an initial position by an elastic force of the third elastic member 137. Accordingly, the third shutter member 133 closes the third transfer opening 116 in association with the movement of the interference member 133a.<br>
[00120]    From the developing cartridge 110 dismounted from the image forming apparatus body 10, the developer cartridge 121 may be removed in the direction R3 opposite to the mounting direction Rl. At this time, the first, the second, and the fourth shutter members 131, 132 and 134, being free from the mounting force between the developer cartridge 121 and the developing cartridge 110, are released from the contacts with respect to the locking projection 131b, the leading end 121a of the developer cartridge 121, and the locking protrusion 134a, respectively.    Accordingly, the first, the second, and the fourth shutter members 131, 132 and 134 are restored into their respective initial positions by elastic bias from the first, the second and the fourth elastic members 135, 136 and 138.<br>
[00121]    A recovering force of the second elastic member 136 for restoring the second shutter member 132 is exerted in the direction R3 opposite to the mounting direction R1 of the developer cartridge 121, assisting in the dismounting the developer cartridge 121 from the developing cartridge 110.<br>
[00122]    As the developer cartridge 121 is removed in the direction R3, as shown in FIGS. 6A through 6C, the pressure protrusion 143 of the guide lever 140 presses and supports the bent end of the first shutter member 131 in the first direction Rl until the first wing 141 is released from the contact with the<br>
23<br><br>
bottom of the developing cartridge 121. Consequently, the pulling by the guide lever 140 of first shutter member 131 in the first direction Rl, in addition to the recovering force of the first elastic member 135 toward the first direction Rl, acts to completely close the first transfer opening 122.<br>
[00123]    The contact force between the pressure protrusion 143 andthe first shutter member 13 is maintained until the first wing 141 becomes free from the contact force with respect to the bottom 121c of the developer cartridge 121, and is rotated by the inclined surface l32a of the second shutter member 132 in the opposite direction of the mounting direction Rl to release the bent end 131a of the first shutter member 131 from the pressure protrusion 143.    As shown in FIG. 6c as the developer cartridge 121 moves further in the direction R3, the inclined surface 132a of the Second shutter member 132 interferes with, and further rotates, the first wing 141 in the direction R3, thereby restoring the guide lever 140 to the initial position.<br>
[00124]   According to the configuration described above, as the developing cartridge 110 is dismounted from the image forming apparatus body 10, the third transfer opening 117 of the developing cartridge 110 is first closed by the third shutter member 133. And when the developer cartridge 121 is dismounted from the developing cartridge 110, the fourth transfer opening 123 is closed by the fourth shutter member 134 and then the first and the second transfer openings 122 and 116 are closed by the first and the second shutter members 131 and 132. That is, as the developer cartridge 121 isdismountedthe developer collecting path T2 is closed first and then the developer supply path T1is closed<br>
[00125]    FIGS. 11 and 12 illustrate an image forming apparatus according to another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[00126]    A developing device 200 of an image forming apparatus isaccording to this embodiment is similar to the developing device 100 of the image forming apparatus ofpreviously described embodiment in that it includes a developing cartridge, a developer containing unit120, and a shutter 130.    The elements similar to those of the previously embodiment are assigneq with the same reference numerals,<br>
24<br><br>
and were previously described with reference to FIGS. 1 through 10.<br>
[00127]    The developing device 200 according to this embodiment includes a waste developer container 221. which does not contain developer for supplying to the developing cartridge 110, but has a structure for collecting waste developer discharged from the developing cartridge 110. Unlike the developer cartridge 121 of the previous embodiment, the waste developer container 221 includes only a collecting path T2 as the developer transfer path.<br>
[00128]    The developing device 200 may have a quantity of developer in the developing cartridge sufficient for printing a number of printing medium. Once the developer available in the developing cartridge 110 is used up, a developer cartridge 121 as illustrated in the previous embodiments, e.g., may be mounted in the mounting recess 110a of the developing cartridge 110, replacing the waste developer container 221.<br>
[00129]    If the waste developer container 221 including only the collecting path T2 is mounted in the developing cartridge 110, third and fourth transfer openings 117 and123 are formed in the developing cartridge 110 and the waste developer container 221, respectively, to open and close the collecting path T2. Correspondingly, the shutter unit 130 includes third and fourth shutter members 133 and 134 disposed in the developing cartridge 110 and the waste developer container 221, respectively, to open and close the third and the fourth transfer openings 117 and 123.<br>
[00130]    As described in the forgoing embodiment, the third and the fourth shutter members 133 and 134 opens the third and the fourth transfer openings 117 and 123, respectively as the developing cartridge 110 is mounted in the image forming apparatus body 10 and the waste developer container 221 is mounted in the developing cartridge 10. Also, the third and the fourth shutter members 133 and 134 are elastically supported by third and fourth elastic members 137 and 138 in directions of closing the third and the fourth transfer openings 117 and 123.<br>
25<br><br>
[00131]    The third and the fourth shutter members 133 and 134 are interfered by the image forming apparatus body 10 and by a locking protrusion I34a formed on the developing cartridge 110, respectively. and thus are made to move in the direction Rl. thereby opening the third and the fourth transfer openings 117 and 123.<br>
[00132]    Operations of opening and closing the collecting path T2 of the developing device 200 of the image forming apparatus 1 according to the embodiment shown in. FIGS 11 and 12 are similar to the operations of opening and closing the collecting path T2 of the developing device 100 according to the embodiment described earlier, and thus detailed descriptions thereof will not be repeated.<br>
[00133]    According to the exemplary embodiments of the present invention, since only the developer containing unit 120 is dismounted from the developing cartridge 110 for the purpose of developer replenishment, the image forming apparatus can be used economically.<br>
[00134]    Also, since the transfer path for the developer is selectively opened and closed in association with operations of mounting and dismounting the developer cartridge 121 containing the developer and/or the waste developer container 221 in and from the developing cartridge 110, a developer leak may be reduced during the replacement. Therefore, contaminations due to developer leak may be prevented.<br>
