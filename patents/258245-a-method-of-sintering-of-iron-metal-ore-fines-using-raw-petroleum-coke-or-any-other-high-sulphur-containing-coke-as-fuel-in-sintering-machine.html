FiE LD OF THE INVENTION;<br>
The subject invention relates to a method of sintering iron ore fines using raw petroleum coke or any other high sulphur containing coke as fuel in a sintering machine on characterize evaluation of corrosion in main gas pipe line.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In a sintering process for metal ore fines or iron ore fines associated with a sintering machine a sinter mix comprising of iron ore fines, crushed flux and a solid fuel in the form of crushed coke breeze, the mix known as green mix is charged onto a moving grate ignited through ID fan air sucked through the green mix bed. The top layer of the green mix feed is ignited as it enters the ignition furnace. Due to effect of suction and presence of coke particles in the mix the flame produced at the top layer, moves vertically downward clue to<br><br>
combustion of coke particles in the green mix while the grate moves horizontally.<br>
The said agglomerating processes are carried through combustion of gaseous products, calcinations and reduction of ore fines generating waste gases. The waste gases on its way from the sinter bed to the atmosphere pass through gas pipe line, Electro-Static-Precipitator (ESP) and chimney. Such waste gases normally contain Co, C02r N2/ NOx, SOx, moisture and dust particulates.<br>
For efficient utilization of heat from air, dusts and waste gases and corrosion prevention in pipe lines the sintering processes are controlled by process variables, such as pressure of air draft, temperature of ignition and gas velocity.<br>
US Patents 4, 067, 727; 4, 065, 295; 4, 023, 960; 3, 963, 481; 3,<br>
909, 189; 3, 704, 525; 3, 649, 244; 3, 339,053; 3, 211,441; 3, 194,<br>
546; 2, 758, 063; 2, 672, 412 have disclosed control steps of higher<br>
pressure over a lesser area in a purging zone, maintaining a	<br><br>
relationship of the speed of strand sintering machine with temperature of collected waste gas, temperature of waste gas, air recirculation circuits for efficient heat exchange of hot air in sinter region and cool air, sensing continuously temperature of waste gases resulting from the combustion at plurality of locations along the path of material and using the datas for determining material temperature profile, along a selected or entire length between the charging and dumping stations, by continuously adjusting speed of material movement in relation to the temperature profile, controlling speed of sintering pallet, an ore feeder and a cooler, controlling weight of material fed to the grate to hold the burn-through point at any set location, control of air draft sequentially to eliminate sulphur content of sulphide ore to prepare sintered product to be smelted in a blast furnace or the like. US Patent nos. 3, 975, 185; 3, 909, 189; 4, 023, 960 have taught how waste gases are cleaned by different process steps.<br>
US Patent Nos. 3,819,360; 3,975, 185 have disclosed how sintering can be enhanced by adding to the ore Fines double salt of potash-magnesia and lignosulfonate.<br><br>
None of the above prior references have disclosed anything of controlling sintering processes dealing with corrosion aspect on main gas pipe line, which problem has long standing demand of industry to be solved, for undisturbed and optimized production of concentration of ores by sintering.<br>
The proposed invention has been aimed to remove the aforesaid difficulty in a complete different mode of approach still unknown in the state of art to control sintering operation without any problem of corrosion in any associated parts of sintering viz gas pipe line, by using sulphur containing fuel in the sintering mix.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION;<br>
For the fast growing steel industry to meet the demand of versatile uses in industry, construction and domestic uses the metallurgical grade coke breeze Is an essential ingredient for utilization of Iron ore fines by sintering. Coke breeze, the conventional trim fuel for sinter making will be scare in near future. Therefore, an alternate fuel to<br><br>
coke breeze Is an immediate cause of concern to meet the challenge of steel Industry for optimized utilization of Iron ore fines derived during ore processing and fine particles captured during iron production or other metals production.<br>
The proposed invention under the said circumstances of steel and metal producing industry has taught of using Raw Petroleum Coke (RPC) as an alternative trimming fuel for Coke Breeze (CB). RPC contain significant amount of sulphur as compared to CB. RPC contain sulphur in organic form and release S02 at high temperature. Sulphur di oxide has tendency to form sulphuric acid which leads to acid corrosion in main gas pipe line.<br>
According to one object of the invention is to determine permissible corrosion rate at main gas pipe line of a sintering machine using RPC as a trimming fuel.<br>
Another object of the invention is to mix in the green mix sintering granulated lime stone and dolomite, which are transformed (calcined)<br><br>
to CaO and MgO at high temperature and deposited on the inside surface of the gas pipe line at the discharging end to act as a good sorbant to adsorb sulphur di oxide.<br>
A still another object of the invention is to maintain corrosion rate at the discharging end of main gas pipe line at a comparable rate with that of CB used as a fuel in the green mix.<br>
A yet another object of the invention is to maintain corrosion rate at the discharge end of gas pipe line at minimum when the fuel In green mix is a high sulphur containing material including RPC.<br>
A further objective of the invention is to study acid corrosion on main pipe line when RPC is used as alternate trimming fuel as partial replacement of CB.<br>
A still further objective of the invention is to exploit the higher calorific value and lower ash content of RPC in sintering process.<br><br>
A still yet another objective of the Invention Is to measure corrosion rates at different locations of main gas pipe line by maintaining steel plate coupons at those locations. With the above objectives in the proposed invention the green mix iron ore/metal ore fines with flux (lime stone and dolomite) and fuels are preweighesd and dlmenstonally designed steel plate coupons are kept at different locations in gas pipe line in sinter plant when CB and RPC are used as trimming fuel and corrosion rates are measured for both the mix separately using CB and RPC as fuel.<br>
According to the invention there is provided a method of sintering of iron /metal ore fines using raw petroleum coke (RPC) or any other high sulphur containing coke as a trimming fuel in a sintering machine comprising the steps of<br>
- admixing in wt% a base mix (iron/metal ore fines) - 63-80%, flux as limestone, dolomite and, lime - 10-13%, CB/RPC as fuel 2.5-3.5%, and the balance being combination of water and revert materials as hot return<br><br>
and cold return fines, the amount of revert material being around 6%,<br>
-	charging the green mix in the sinter bed of the sintering machine,<br>
-	sintering the mix at conventional temperature maintained in sintering process to form a sinter,<br>
-	keeping steel plate coupons at different locations of the main gas pipe line,<br>
-	maintaining permissible corrosion rates within 2.705 to 3.192 at the discharging end of the main gas pipe line, producing sintered mass without resulting any corrosion in any parts of the sintering machine as evaluated through measurement of corrosion rates of the steel plate coupons kept at different locations of the main gas pipe line.<br>
The present invention will be better understood from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings in which<br><br>
Figure 1 represents schematically a conventional sintering machine wherein the green fix formed with coke breeze or RPC is changed into the moving grate of sintering machine, sintered and waste gas released through chimney via ESP (Electro Static Precipitator) and Figure 2 represents the front view of sinter bed, wind box and main gas pipe line of sinter plant.<br>
Figure 1 depicts the green mix formed from base mix (iron/metal ore fines) limestone and magnesite, lime, fuel (CR or RPC), hot return fines and cold return fines through the Feed Supply and passed through a moisturizer and charged in the sinter bed (b) by the charger (a). The moving sinter bed from left to right is supplied with draft air through wind Box (c) and is ignited through burning of fuel in the green mix. The dust laden gas produced from the combustion in sinter bed is fed to ESP (e) for collection of iron/metal particulates and the residual gas is released through a chimney (g) via waste fan<br>
(f)<br><br>
Figure 2 depicts the position of steel plate coupons at: different locations (1 to 15) In gas pipe line In sinter plant when CB and RPC are used as trimming fuels.<br>
On completion of sintering operation the coupons at 12 location of main gas pipe line are collected and corrosion rates are measured for those coupons.<br>
A comparative test datas of corrosion rates at different locations of main gas pipe line using CB and RPC as fuels are given in the following Table - 1.<br>
Table 1 Corrosion rate data at different location in main gas pipe line<br><br><br>
It has been observed that the reaction products due to corrosion formed on steel surface near charging end were bigger in size with higher iron/metal content and lower in Calcium, Magnesium, Oxygen, Chlorine, Aluminum and sulphur content. On the contrary, the reaction products formed on the coupon exposed near discharging end were smaller in size with comparatively lower iron/metal content and higher Calcium, Magnesium, Oxygen, Chlorine, Aluminum and Sulphur content. Samples collected near charging end show Goethite and Hematite as reaction products formed at the steel surface where as samples collected from the middle portion of the main gas pipe line showed presence of Hematite only.<br>
On the other hand Hematite, Magnetite, Caminite, Spurrite, Sylvite and Mullite compounds were detected on the steel surface near discharging as a result of high temperature.<br>
It has been observed that gases such as C02, S02 and Cl2 released from the sinter mix at high temperature is absorbed by Lime, Magnesia and Alumina powder deposited on the steel surface and<br><br>
subsequently converted to complex compounds such as Caminite, Spurrite, Sylvite, Mulllte.<br>
It Is thus clearly observed from the said test datas that sintering operation of iron/metal ore fines can be efficiently and optimisingly performed in a conventional sintering plant without any corrosion problem even using higher sulphur containing fuel with the green mix charged in the sinter bed on adsorption by sorbent MgO, CaO, AI2O3 deposited at the discharge end of main gas pipe line adsorbing maximum sulphur dioxide generated in the sintering process and the rest residual sulphur di oxide is removed with the waste gas in a permissible range via higher gas velocity provided by the waste fan.<br>
Moisture content in the carrier gas near WB15 is. observed maximum near charging end of the main gas pipe line as 
 <br>
moisture, the moisture and temperature of carrier gas thus maintaining inverse relationship.<br>
The proposed invention as narrated herein should not be read and construed in a restrictive manner, as various modifications, alterations of gas velocity, temperature of sinter bed and waste gases pressure of draft air and adaptations accordingly are possible with the scope and ambit of the invention as defined in the encompassed appended claims.<br><br>
