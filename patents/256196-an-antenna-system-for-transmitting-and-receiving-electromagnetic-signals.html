				<td>ANTENNA ARRANGEMENT AND GLAZING FURNISHED WITH SUCH AN<br>
ANTENNA ARRANGEMENT<br>
The invention pertains to an antenna arrangement for<br>
transmitting and receiving electromagnetic signals as<br>
well as to glazings furnished with such antenna<br>
arrangements.<br>
The receiving and transmitting of electromagnetic waves<br>
call particularly upon crossed-dipole antennas. Such an<br>
antenna is known, for example, from Patent<br>
DE 699 05 436 T2. The drawback of this crosse d-dipole<br>
antenna resides in the fact that it exhibits an<br>
excessive height for certain applications.<br>
If a small height is necessary, the antennas used in<br>
the art of high frequencies are frequently so -called<br>
patch antennas with which the antenna proper is<br>
composed of a patch. With such antennas, the patch and<br>
the feed cab le have to frequently exhibit the same<br>
layered structure, which amounts to saying that the<br>
material of the substrate and the height of the<br>
substrate are identical for the supply cable and the<br>
patch. In this case it is difficult to find a good<br>
compromise between the requirements imposed on the feed<br>
cable, it should neither transmit nor receive, and on<br>
the antenna itself, it should transmit or receive as<br>
well as possible.<br>
In the technical field of traffic flow , devices which<br>
demand wireless communication are being employed more<br>
and more often. Communication applications of this type<br>
are, for example, centralized traffic guidance or<br>
electronic toll collection (ETC). The frequency used<br>
for these applications is generally of the order of 5.8<br>
GHz (microwave frequ encies) . The antennas for these<br>
frequencies are also called DSRC antennas (standing for<br>
Dedicated Short Range Communication). In the field of<br>
ETC, an onboard DSRC unit (OBU On-Board Unit) for motor<br><br>
vehicles is known from Patent US 6 421 017 B1. This OBU<br>
comprises an antenna and a control unit for<br>
communication with transmitter/receiver devices that<br>
are disposed along the path travelled. The innovation<br>
according to the above American patent resides in the<br>
fact that the OBU is modified in such a way that it c an<br>
be installed on the dashboard at a given distance from<br>
the windscreen. This makes it possible to avoid the<br>
characteristics of the antenna being too dispersed on<br>
account of the various gaps between the antenna and the<br>
glazing following inaccurate mountin g. The drawback<br>
with this arrangement is that the location of mounting<br>
of the OBU is not variable. Another drawback appears<br>
when a glazing has to be covered with a layer<br>
reflecting electromagnetic waves. In this case, data<br>
transmission is possible only if a corresponding<br>
communication window is provided in the coating. The<br>
manufacture of such a communication window is however<br>
frequently tied to increased complexity and increased<br>
cost.<br>
An object of the invention is to provide an antenna<br>
arrangement which exhibits small outside dimensions and<br>
which may be mounted without difficulty in a given<br>
position.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention firstly proposes an<br>
antenna arrangement for transmitting and receiving<br>
electromagnetic signals, the antenna arrangement<br>
comprising:<br>
a flat carrier substrate made of dielectric<br>
material,<br>
a first conducting track applied to a surface of<br>
the carrier substrate, the first conducting track<br>
possessing at one end a point of contact so as to<br>
gather thereat or inject thereat the signals and a<br>
first dipole at the opposite end,<br>
a second conducting track applied to the other<br>
surface of the carrier substrate,<br><br>
the second conducting track possessing at one end<br>
a point of contact so as to gather thereat or<br>
inject thereat the signals and a second dipole at<br>
the opposite end, and<br>
the first and the second dipoles forming a crossed<br>
dipole.<br>
According to the invention, the antenna arrangement is<br>
thus composed of a flat substrate that does not conduct<br>
electricity, for example a film, on the m ain surfaces<br>
of which are disposed two conducting bands that act as<br>
signal lines.<br>
One of the ends of each of them is configured so as to<br>
be able to establish a link with another electronic<br>
component or with another signal line.<br>
The other corresponding en d of the conducting bands<br>
terminates as two folded parts that form the poles of a<br>
dipole.<br>
On account of its configuration, the antenna is<br>
globally very flat.<br>
The dipoles that are derived from the two conducting<br>
bands are in perpendicular projection with respect to<br>
one another so as to form a crossed dipole.<br>
The two poles of each dipole are preferably<br>
perpendicular to one another and the two dipoles<br>
themselves are preferably pivoted by 180Â° with respect<br>
to one another.<br>
Furthermore, if the support or subs trate used is a<br>
film, the antenna arrangement is additionally flexible.<br>
This considerably simplifies mounting on, in or against<br>
a carrier structure.<br><br>
The dimensions of the conducting sections that<br>
constitute the structure of the antenna are matched in<br>
a known manner to the frequency of operation and to the<br>
passband of the global system by integrating the<br>
surrounding medium.<br>
To match the impedances or the characteristic<br>
impedances of the dipole and of the conducting bands,<br>
it is preferable to use a so -called Î»/4 transformer<br>
between the antenna zone proper and the part of the<br>
conducting band which gets linked to the dipole and<br>
which serves for the transmission of the signal. The<br>
Î»/4 transformer is a section of conducting band whose<br>
characteristic impedance is adjusted so as to be able<br>
to obtain transmission with the least possible losses<br>
of the signals received or transmitted in the<br>
conducting bands which are linked thereto. The<br>
characteristic impedances are thus matched to one<br>
another. The Î»/4 transformer its elf and the conducting<br>
band that gets linked thereto are embodied in the form<br>
of a so -called strip line which is characterized in<br>
that the conducting bands disposed on the opposite<br>
faces of the carrier substrate coincide. The strip line<br>
is thus a bipolar 1 ine comprising conducting bands<br>
which coincide and are preferably spaced close<br>
together.<br>
The line losses in the conducting bands dispose d the<br>
one on the other of the two sides of the substrate may<br>
be reduced if the sections of the two conduc ting bands<br>
used only for the carriage of the signal exhibit<br>
different widths, this amounting to saying that a so<br>
called microband line is produced. The longitudinal<br>
axes of the two conducting bands here run parallel and<br>
preferably coincide. The electromagnetic field produced<br>
between the conducting bands is then limited in its<br>
dimensions in such a way as to decrease a radiation.<br><br>
It is preferable for the transition between the strip<br>
line and the conducting bands that get linked thereto<br>
and serve only for the transmission of the signal<br>
(microband line for example) not to be made abruptly<br>
with a jump in the width of the conductor. Preferably,<br>
a transition line with gradual adaptation of the width<br>
is made so as to avoid unwanted reflections and thus<br>
signal nulling and damping . The gradual transition is<br>
generally effected with an adaptation element often<br>
called a "taper balun", or else may also be for example<br>
a wide section of trapezoidal form.<br>
In certain cases, it may turn out to be judicious to<br>
shield the conducting tracks, that is to say to protect<br>
the signal transmission pathways against the influence<br>
of the electromagnetic radiation acting from the<br>
outside. This shielding may be obtained, for example,<br>
via additional bands of electrically conducting<br>
material above and below the conductor of the signal<br>
proper. These additional conducting tracks are of<br>
course galvanically insulated from the signal<br>
conductors. This insulation may be achieved by means of<br>
an intermediate layer of the same dielectric substrate<br>
which acts as support or by other measures, for example<br>
by providing an intermediate layer of insulating<br>
varnish. The shielding lines may be earthed to improve<br>
the performance of the shielding.<br>
Copper has proved its worth as material for the<br>
conducting tracks, on the one hand because it possesses<br>
a good conductivity and on the other hand because it is<br>
easy to implement. It is quite obviously possible to<br>
use other appropriate conducting materials, for example<br>
metals such as tin, silver or gold.<br>
The electrical insulating suppo rt may be composed of<br>
polyimide, for example, this material is also<br>
frequently used as support for flat cables. It is<br>
however, also possible to use any other appropriate<br><br>
material, as long as it exhibits the necessary<br>
properties, in particular good dielectric properties,<br>
perhaps the possibility of being implemented in the<br>
form of a film and the possibility of applying<br>
conducting structures thereto.<br>
The transmission of signals at high frequency may give<br>
rise to relatively severe line losses and/or losses by<br>
radiation, thereby making it necessary for the link<br>
lines connected to the antenna arrangement to be<br>
designed for the corresponding application so that the<br>
losses are minimal. If it is necessary to have an<br>
interface if possible universal or standardized be tween<br>
the antenna arrangement and a processing apparatus such<br>
as an OBU installed some distance from this<br>
arrangement, the high-frequency signal signals may<br>
then, in accordance with the invention, already be<br>
converted into a baseband, that is to say into s ignals<br>
of lower-frequency signal , with the aid of an<br>
electronic circuit in immediate proximity to or on the<br>
antenna arrangement itself. These may be conveyed to<br>
the processing apparatus with low losses, even over<br>
great distances.<br>
The said electronic circuit may be composed of discrete<br>
and/or integrated electronic components ( IC), for <br>
example according to DE , 198 56 663 C2 or <br>
DE 101 29 664 C2 . The state of the art makes it<br>
possible to fabricate such electronic circuits in a<br>
very flat form so that they may be mounted without<br>
additional provisions on a thin and/or flexible carrier<br>
substrate (for example according to DE 100 02 777 C1) .<br>
In addition to the frequency converter, the electronic<br>
circuit may also contain an amplifier, a tuner and/or<br>
other processing elements.<br>
The flat antenna structure according to the invention<br>
is particularly suitable for mounting on glazings of<br>
buildings or of vehicles. Specifically, on account of<br><br>
its flat form, the antenna arrangement in accordance<br>
with the invention may be applied very discreetly to a<br>
flat object such as a glazing.<br>
The flexible antenna structure in the case of the use<br>
of a flexible film is particularly suitable for<br>
mounting on glazings of buildings or of vehicles.<br>
Specifically, its flexible structure allows it als o to<br>
be mounted without difficultly on a curved glazing. The<br>
antenna arrangement according to the invention can in<br>
particular be easily glued.<br>
The glazings used may be monolithic, that is to say<br>
composed of a single pane, or also multilayer, composed<br>
of s everal panes and/or films. The panes may be<br>
essentially transparent, made of glass or plastic, be<br>
flat or curved. A pane may be furnished with one or<br>
more films, two panes or more may be joined together by<br>
means of an adhesive layer or an adhesive film.<br>
By virtue of the above -described properties, the<br>
antenna arrangement may easily be glued to a main<br>
surface of a glazing.<br>
In the case of multilayer structures, for example when<br>
using a laminated glass glazing, the flat antenna<br>
arrangement in its entirety or in part may also be<br>
disposed inside the sandwich structure.<br>
The carrier substrate zone furnished with the points of<br>
contact may protrude laterally from the sandwich<br>
structure and possibly be folded around the lateral<br>
edge of the glazing. Linking to an ad ditional signal<br>
line or to passive or active electrical networks is<br>
thus easy to achieve.<br>
In a first embodiment of the invention with a<br>
multilayer or monolithic glazing, the zone of the<br>
antenna arrangement with the dipoles is mounted on one<br><br>
of the free ma in surfaces of the glazing, the zone of<br>
the antenna arrangement with the points of contact<br>
intended to gather and/or to inject the s ignals is<br>
mounted on the other main surface of the glazing, and<br>
the carrier substrate is passed around the peripheral<br>
surface of the glazing.<br>
In a second embodiment of the invention using a<br>
multilayer glazing, the zone of the antenna arrangement<br>
with the dipoles is disposed between two of the layers<br>
of the glazing, the zone of the antenna arrangement<br>
with the points of contact intended to gather and/or to<br>
inject the signals is mounted on one of the two free<br>
main surfaces of the glazing and the carrier substrate<br>
is passed around the peripheral surface of at least one<br>
of the layers of the glazing.<br>
When the carrier substrate is p assed around a lateral<br>
edge of the glazing, it may turn out to be advantageous<br>
to furnish the peripheral edge of the monolithic pane<br>
or, in the case of a sandwich pane structure, of one or<br>
more individual panes in this zone with a recess or<br>
with a hollow (see for example Patent EP 0 593 940 B1) .<br>
This makes it possible to guarantee that the carrier<br>
substrate does not overstep the initial contour of the<br>
glazing. Damage during transport or during handling may<br>
thus be avoided and fitt ing into a frame or the<br>
mounting of a frame are considerably facilitated. Such<br>
an execution with a peripheral edge with recess is<br>
particularly appropriate when the carrier substrate<br>
bears components whose cross section is larger than<br>
that of the conducting tracks and of the dipoles , for<br>
example an electronic circuit for frequency matching or<br>
for adaptation to a linking connector. These components<br>
may then be disposed while being particularly protected<br>
in the hollow formed on the peripheral edge where they<br>
are less exposed than in th e case of mounting on the<br>
surface of the pane. After the mounting of the carrier<br><br>
substrate is terminated, these components may be<br>
moulded with an appropriate sealing mass with the aid<br>
of which the said hollow may subsequently be levelled<br>
on the surface.<br>
If a glazing is furnished with a layer or with a<br>
coating which reflects electromagnetic waves but which<br>
is optically transparent, it is nevertheless necessary<br>
to take care that the antenna arrangement is not<br>
shielded by this layer or this coating. The layer or<br>
the coating must therefore not be disposed between the<br>
antenna arrangement and the transmitter or the receiver<br>
of the antenna signals. In the converse case, the layer<br>
or the coating must comprise a zone that allows waves<br>
to pass through (communication window). Quite<br>
obviously, neither should there be provision for any<br>
layer or coating reflecting electromagnetic waves<br>
between the two dipoles.<br>
Also in a preferred embodiment, whether the glazing be<br>
monolithic or layered, the zone of the antenna<br>
arrangement containing the dipoles is disposed so as to<br>
transmit or receive the electromagnetic signals<br>
correctly, said zone being disposed further towards the<br>
outside than the said reflecting layer after mounting<br>
of the glazing for example on a car.<br>
The said layer s or the said coatings reflecting<br>
electromagnetic waves serve, for example, for thermal<br>
insulation or may act as surface heating.<br>
A particular advantage of the invention resides in the<br>
fact that if the antenna arrangement is fixed on or<br>
against a glazing or at the very least the zone<br>
containing the dipoles, it is not necessary to adapt or<br>
treat a coating which reflects electromagnetic waves<br>
that may be present and oriented further towards the<br>
inside after mounting of the glazing for example on a<br>
car.<br><br>
When the glazing is a multilayer pane, the zone of the<br>
antenna arrangement containing the dipoles may be<br>
disposed between the reflecting coating or layer and<br>
the internal face of the external layer of the glazing,<br>
that is to say the layer intended to be outermost.<br>
When the glazing is a monolithic pane the zone of the<br>
antenna arrangement containing the dipoles may be<br>
disposed between the reflecting coating or layer and<br>
the internal face of the pane.<br>
When the antenna arrangement in accordance with the<br>
invention is mounted in or against a glazing, it may be<br>
protected by a layer of opaque or translucent paint on<br>
one of the panes or one of the films so that it cannot<br>
be seen from the outside . This protection may be<br>
applied for aesthetic reasons, but also to protect<br>
certain materials against ultraviolet rays.<br>
Other features and advantages of the subject of the<br>
invention result, without restriction, from the<br>
drawings of the exemplary embodiments and the detailed<br>
description hereinbelow.<br>

in the form of a film, viewed from above;<br>

embodiment according to Figure 1; and<br>

antenna arrangement in the form of a fil m<br>
with shielding lines.<br>

antenna arrangement of Figure 1, in a variant<br>
of Figure 4.<br>
Figure 6 a longitudinal sectional view of a third<br>
embodiment of an antenna arrangement<br>
according to the invention.<br>
According to Figure 1 and Figure 2, the antenna<br>
arrangement 1 is composed of a flexi ble carrier film 2<br>
made of polyi mide and partially transparent in which<br>
are integrated electrically conducting bands 3 and 4<br>
made of copper. The carrier film 2 is around 3 0 mm wide<br>
and 150 Âµm thick. The integrated conducting bands are<br>
around 17 Âµm thick and are spaced around 100 urn apart.<br>
Two conducting sections that act as poles 50 and 51 or<br>
60 and 61 run respectively from one end of the<br>
conducting bands 3 and 4. The poles 50 and 51 on one<br>
side and 60 and 61 (shown dashed) on the other,<br>
electrically connected, respectively form an antenna<br>
dipole. An angle of 135Â° is formed between the poles 50<br>
and 51 and the lateral limits of the conducting band 3.<br>
The poles 60 and 61 and the lateral limits of the<br>
conducting band 4 (shown dashed), on the other hand,<br>
form an angle of 45Â°. The poles 50, 51 on one side and<br>
60 and 61 on the other side thus form respectively a<br>
right angle between them, whereas the two dipoles 50/51<br>
and 60/61 formed do not coincide, but are pivoted by<br>
180Â° with respect to one another.<br>
In the representation of Figure 1, the bases of the two<br>
dipoles 50/51 and 60/61 coincide with one another and<br>
form an X in the direction of the vertical projection.<br>
Other overlaps are conceivable, however, by shifting<br>
the bases with respect to one another. In an extreme<br>
case, it is a diamond which is formed in the vertical<br>
projection.<br><br>
For simplifying reasons, the zone of the antenna<br>
arrangement opposite from the zone 16 which exhibits<br>
the dipoles 50/51 and 60/61 is not represented here.<br>
Elements intended to connect the conducting bands 3 and<br>
4 with a n antenna cable or with an electronic circuit<br>
are provided thereat so as to gather thereat and/or to<br>
inject thereat the signals transported. The elements of<br>
this type form part of the state of the art and will<br>
therefore not be the subject of a more detaile d<br>
description here.<br>
The conducting section attached directly to the dipoles<br>
50/51 and 60/61 is embodied in the form of a so -called<br>
Î»/4 transformer which matches the impedances of the<br>
dipoles to the impedance of the coincident conducting<br>
bands, embodied in the form of a strip line 31. Only<br>
the upper line part of the Î»/4 transformer 7 and the<br>
strip line 31 of the conducting band 3 are visible in<br>
Figure 1, the corresponding components to be associated<br>
with the conducting band 4 are covered in this<br>
representation.<br>
The zones 32 and 42 of the conducting bands 3 and 4,<br>
which lead to the elements for linking at the opposite<br>
end from the dipoles of the carrier film, possess<br>
different widths and form a so -called microband line.<br>
In the arrangement of the global syste m, this type of<br>
line turns out to exhibit a lower attenuation than that<br>
of the strip lines or of the other types of lines. The<br>
losses by damping are considerably reduced. The<br>
transition between the asymmetric zones 32, 42 of the<br>
conducting bands and the sy mmetric strip line 31 is<br>
effected gradually so as to reduce or eliminate<br>
unwanted reflections, dampings at the level of the line<br>
and thus fadings of the signals transported.<br>
Figure 3 represents a second embodiment of the antenna<br>
arrangement 1' in accordance with the invention. As in<br>
Figure 2, Figure 3 represents a section through the<br><br>
zone of the conducting bands 320 and 420 that are<br>
asymmetric in width. Shielding bands 8 and 9 are<br>
however disposed here in addition above the conducting<br>
band 320 and below th e conducting band 420 and<br>
integrated into the substrate 2. The shielding bands 8<br>
and 9 are earthed or connected to the earth terminal<br>
and contribute to improved shielding of the conducting<br>
bands 320 and 420 which transmit the signals. The<br>
unwanted signals acting from the outside may thus<br>
effectively be stopped.<br>
In the exemplary embodiments represented, the<br>
electrically conducting components of the antenna<br>
arrangement (conducting bands 3, 4, 32, 42, 320 and 420<br>
as well as the shielding bands 8 and 9) are al ways<br>
embodied completely integrated into the carrier<br>
substrate. Quite obviously, this is not absolutely<br>
necessary in particular if these electrically<br>
conducting elements are not in contact with other<br>
conducting elements (metal wires, heating wires, etc.).<br>
Such is the case in particular when the antenna<br>
arrangement in accordance with the invention is<br>
integrated into another component, for example a<br>
laminated glazing. Also, the electrically conducting<br>
components of the antenna arrangement (conducting bands<br>
3, 4, 32, 42, 320 and 420) or, as appropriate, the<br>
shielding bands 8 and 9, may be on the free surface of<br>
a carrier substrate, and may in addition be covered<br>
with a lacquer, in particular an insulating lacquer.<br>
When it is indicated, in the above descriptio ns of the<br>
figures, that the conducting bands 3, 4, 32, 4 2, 320<br>
and 420 as well as the shielding bands 8 and 9 are<br>
"integrated", this should not restrict either the<br>
method of fabrication (for example by coextrusion), or<br>
the structure of the antenna arrangement on a monoblock<br>
carrier substrate. Even if the carrier substrate 2 is<br>
always represented in the form of a single body in the<br>
drawings, it may also consist of several films or panes<br><br>
disposed one above the other. These (partial) carrier<br>
substrates then ea ch represent one or more conducting<br>
bands or else they serve solely for insulation. Thus,<br>
the arrangement may comprise an alternation of<br>
conducting layers (3, 4, 32, 42, 320 and 420 as well as<br>
the shielding bands 8 and 9) and of insulating layers.<br>
The conducting and shielding bands 3, 4, 32, 42, 320,<br>
42 0, 8 and 9 may be fabricated from films or metal<br>
braids or else be applied directly to a (partial)<br>
carrier substrate by screen printing. Likewise, the<br>
known methods of etching of the printed circuits<br>
technique may be used for the fabrication of the<br>
conducting and shielding bands.<br>
Figure 4 is a schematic view (which is not to scale) of<br>
a transverse section through a glazing comprising the<br>
antenna arrangement of Figure 1.<br>
This glazing 100 is laminated and comprises,<br>
a glass sheet 101 intended to be the external<br>
sheet after mounting of the glazing in a building<br>
or a car,<br>
an insert 104, preferably of PVB<br>
a glass sheet 102 (internal sheet)<br>
a layer reflecting electromagnetic waves covering<br>
the "external" face (PVB side) of the internal<br>
sheet 102 and disposed directly on this sheet - or<br>
alternatively on PET - .<br>
The zone 16 of the antenna arrangement with the dipoles<br>
is disposed at the rim of the external face of the<br>
internal sheet 102, and above a part of t he reflecting<br>
layer 104. The arrangement 1 wraps around the<br>
peripheral edge of this internal sheet 102 as it folds<br>
and the zone 17 of the antenna arrangement with the<br>
points of contact runs over the internal face of the<br>
internal sheet.<br><br>
In a variant shown in Figure 5, the peripheral edge of<br>
the internal sheet 102 is furnished with a recess 105.<br>
This makes it possible to guarantee that the carrier<br>
substrate does not overstep the initial contour of the<br>
sheet 102. Damage during transport or during handling<br>
may thus be avoided and fitting into a frame or the<br>
mounting of a frame are considerably facilitated.<br>
Figure 6 shows a schematic longitudinal sectional view<br>
of a third embodiment of an antenna arrangement 1'<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Only the differences with respect to the second<br>
embodiment (Figure 3) are described hereinafter in<br>
greater detail.<br>
The conducting tracks 320', 420' are disposed between<br>
the shielding lines 80, 90 these conducting layers<br>
320', 420', 80, 90 being wholly integrated into a<br>
carrier substrate in the form of a flexible film 20<br>
with a peripheral edge with recess 21.<br>
The antenna arrangement 1' furthermore comprises an<br>
electronic adaptation circuit for frequency matching 10<br>
disposed in this zone of the recess 21 and is linked to<br>
a connector 11 itself ending up on an adapter connector<br>
12. In this way, the high-frequency signal signals are<br>
converted into a baseband, that is to say into signals<br>
of lower-frequency signal.<br>
The said electronic circuit may be composed of discrete<br>
and/or int egrated electronic components (IC), for<br>
example according to DE	198 56 663 C2 or<br>
DE 101 29 664 C2. It is possible by preference to<br>
choose a very flat shape so that they can be mounted<br>
without additional provisions on the carrier substrate.<br>
In addition to t he frequency converter, the electronic<br>
circuit can also contain an amplifier, a tuner and/or<br>
other processing elements.<br><br>
The zone with this circuit 10 may be disposed while<br>
being particularly protected in a recess or a hollow<br>
formed on a peripheral edge of a laminated or<br>
monolithic glazing where it is less exposed than in the<br>
case of mounting on the surface of the glazing. After<br>
the mounting of the carrier substrate has terminated,<br>
this component may be moulded with an appropriate<br>
sealing mass with the aid of which the said hollow may<br>
subsequently be levelled at the surface.<br><br>
