TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROCESS FOR MAKING CARBAPENEM COMPOUNDS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Carbapenems are a broad class of antibiotic compounds useful for the treatment of infectious diseases including gram positive and negative, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. U.S. Patent No. 5,478,820 to Betts, assigned to Zeneca Ltd. teaches carbapenem compounds, salts and hydrolysable esters thereof, of the general formula: <br>
useful as antibiotics, as well as a method for the preparation thereof.<br>
Generally, organic solvents that are used in the crystallization of carbapenem compounds are difficult to remove from the final product because of the limited stability of the compounds. See Takeuchi, Y. et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. Vol. 41, No. 11, 1993, pg. 1998-2002. These solvents must be reduced to levels that are acceptable for pharmaceutical use. The pharmaceutically acceptable level depends upon the solvent and the maximum daily dose to be administered. Guidelines for what is acceptable are provided by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH). For the organic solvents that would be used in pharmaceutical processing and for doses typically used in treatment of bacterial infection, the pharmaceutically acceptable limit would be about 2%. The reduction of organic solvents to pharmaceutically acceptable levels can sometimes be accomplished by heating a compound under vacuum or in a stream of inert gas. However, the process of heating can result in significant degradation of these thermally unstable compounds.<br>
In the present case, the carbapenem solids isolated by crystallization from water/alcohol mixtures become amorphous when the water content of the solid is reduced below a certain level. The organic solvent remaining on the solid when it becomes amorphous is not readily removed and remains above the pharmaceutically acceptable limit. This invention relates to a process for reducing the levels of organic<br><br>
solvents in crystalline carbapenem solids while minimizing degradation of the thermally unstable antibiotic to give a product that is acceptable for pharmaceutical use.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A process for reducing the levels of organic solvents in thermally unstable crystalline carbapenem solids to pharmaceutical^ acceptable levels, comprising washing a carbapenem solid of formula I:<br><br>
j. containing organic solvent with an organic solvent containing water to produce a washed carbapenem solid containing residual organic solvent, and evaporating the residual organic solvent in the washed carbapenem solid using vacuum and/or inert gas at low temperature to produce a carbapenem solid of formula I or a salt thereof, containing pharmaceutically acceptable levels of organic solvents, wherein the water content of the carbapenem solids, correcting for organic solvent, is maintained at about 13% to about 25% during the process, wherein Ri and R2 are the same or different and are selected from H, alkyl, aryl, and heteroaryl, said alkyl, aryl and heteroaryl optionally substituted.<br>
A second aspect of the invention relates to a crystalline form, Form C, produced in the process. The levels of residual organic solvents are more readily reduced in solids containing this crystalline form, thereby minimizing degradation incurred in the process. A method of preparation of said crystal form is also disclosed. This and other aspects of the invention are realized upon an in depth review of the specification as a whole.<br>

Another sub-embodiment of the invention relates to a process wherein the water content of the carbapenem solids during residual organic solvent reduction is maintained at about 13% to about 25%.<br>
Still another sub-embodiment of this invention relates to a process wherein the inert gas stream used in residual organic solvent reduction is hydrated such that the water content of the solid is maintained at about 16% to about 22% during the residual organic solvent reduction operation.<br>
Generally, the compounds of formula I, n, Ha can be synthesized in accordance with U.S. Patent No. 4,888,344, issued on July 24, 1990 to M. Sunagawa, U.S. Patent No. 4,943,569, U.S. Patent No. 6,180,783, issued January 30,2001, U.S. Pat. No. 5,872,250, issued February 16,1999 as well as U.S. Patent No. 5,478,820, issued December 26, 1995 to Betts et al.t all incorporated herein by reference thereto.<br>
According to one method of preparation, the compound of formula Ila can be prepared as illustrated in the following non-limiting scheme:<br><br><br><br>
The process of this invention is characterized by washing the carbapenem solids containing organic solvents with a mixture of, for example, methyl acetate and water to produced a washed carbapenem solid containing, for example, residual methyl acetate. Residual methyl acetate in the solid can then be reduced to a pharmaceutically acceptable level at low temperature by passing a stream of inert gas (hydrated or dry) through the solids, or by subjecting the solids to vacuum with or without a stream of inert gas (hydrated or dry). Different combinations of conditions provide the desired result as long as the water content of the carbapenem solids is maintained between about 13 and 25% (correcting for residual organic solvent). For example, the water content of the solvent/water mixture can be defined to give a sufficiently high water content in the solids (up to about 25% correcting for residual organic solvent) such that residual organic solvents can be reduced to pharmaceutically acceptable levels using vacuum alone or a dry inert gas stream. In this case, the temperature of the solid is controlled at below about 0 °C to ensure selective removal of the organic solvent. Alternatively, the gas used in residual organic solvent reduction can be hydrated to maintain the water content of the solid above about 13% (correcting for residual organic solvent) during the residual organic solvent reduction operation. Using hydrated inert gas, with or without vacuum, allows reduction in residual organic solvents to pharmaceutically acceptable levels at temperatures up to about 20 °C.<br>
Generally, the washing is conducted with a mixture of a volatile, non-hydroxylic water miscible organic solvent and water. Preferred organic solvents are acetone and methyl acetate. The amount of wash is generally about 10 to about 30 mL/g. The temperature of the solids during the wash operation is generally about -15 °C to about 20 °C, preferably about 0 °C to about 10 °C.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable level or levels depends upon the solvent or solvents contained in the washed carbapenem solid, particularly since each solvent may have a different pharmaceutically acceptable limit. However, the pharmaceutically acceptable limit for the carbapenem solid as a whole would be about 2%.<br>
Gases that can be used in the process include those gases that would be considered inert or unreactive toward the carbapenem product including but not limited to those that are commonly used in pharmaceutical processing such as nitrogen and argon. The preferred inert gas is nitrogen.<br><br>
As would be understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, the time required for residual organic solvent reduction is dependent upon cake height, gas flow, vacuum, and temperature and ranges from about one half hour to about 96 hours. When a gas such as nitrogen is passed through the solid in residual organic solvent reduction, the gas flow rate is generally about 0.3 to 30 SLPH / assay gram where gas flow is represented in standard liters per hour. The rate of residual organic solvent removal increases with gas flow rate. The highest practical flow rate, therefore, affords the fastest residual organic solvent reduction. When vacuum is used, the rate of residual organic solvent reduction increases with increasing vacuum. The highest practical vacuum, therefore, affords the fastest residual organic solvent reduction. The fastest rate is achieved using a combination of vacuum level and gas flow through the solid. In this case, the gas flow ranges from 0.3 to 30 SLPH / assay gram of the compound where gas flow is represented in standard liters per hour. The operation is generally conducted at a temperature of about -10 °C to about 20 °C, preferably about 0 °C to about 10 °C. The humidity of the gas stream used in residual organic solvent reduction is controlled such that the dew point of the gas is maintained at least 2 °C below the temperature of the solid to avoid condensation.<br>
In a preferred process, the carbapenem solids containing organic solvent are first washed with an organic solvent containing water (such as methyl acetate containing 2-4% (w/v) water) followed by reduction in the level of the organic solvent used in washing the solids using vacuum and hydrated nitrogen while maintaining the solid temperature below about 10 °C. By subjecting these solids to conditions which reduce the levels of residual organic solvents but maintain the water content of the solids in the range from about 13% to about 25%, the residual organic solvents are more readily reduced to pharmaceutically acceptable levels.<br>
This invention also relates to a process which comprises washing the carbapenem solids containing organic solvent first with an anhydrous solvent such as methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, methyl acetate, acetone, or the like, which produces an amorphous solid. The residual organic solvent levels in this amorphous material can then be reduced to pharmaceutically acceptable levels by using a hydrated gas such as nitrogen in the process thereby increasing the water content of the solids.<br>
The invention also relates to a crystalline hydrate, Form C, of (4R, 5S, 6S, 8R, 2'S, 4'S)-3-[[2-[[3-carboxyphenyl)amino]carbonyl]pyrrolidin-4-yl]thio]-4-<br><br>
methyl-6-( 1 -hydroxyethyl)-7-oxo-1 -azabicyclo[3,2.0]hept-2-en-2-carboxylic acid monosodium salt which can be represented by the following formula:<br><br>
and a process for making the same comprising washing a crystalline form, Form A or Form B, of the compound of formula Ha with an organic solvent selected from methyl acetate, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, acetone or a mixture thereof containing water.<br>
A sub-embodiment of this invention is realize when the crystalline compound is Form B and the organic solvent used in washing the carbapenem solids is methyl acetate containing 2-4% water.<br>
The crystalline Form C of the compound of formula Ila described herein is a hydrate in which water is weakly bound. This crystalline form is not thermally stable and does not exhibit a distinct, well-defined melting point, but rather undergoes decomposition with loss of water upon heating.<br>
The crystalline form is characterized below by virtue of X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) pattern and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum, which are useful in unambiguously identifying the unique form disclosed herein. The XRPD pattern was collected on a Philips automated powder diffractometer with XRG 3100 control and PW3710 mpd control using CuKa radiation with an accelerating potential of 45 kV and a filament emission of 40 mA. The diffraction pattern was collected from about 2 to about 40 °2Theta. The solid-state NMR spectrum was generated using a Bruker DSX 400WB NMR system operating at 100.6 MHz for l3C and 400.1 MHz for *H using a Bruker MAS 400WB BL7 double-resonance probe with a spinning module housing a 7 mm zirconia rotor with either KEL-F® end caps with a liquid seal plug or zirconia endcaps. The solid-state l3C NMR spectrum was acquired using cross polarization (CP), magic-angle spinning (MAS), and high-power decoupling. Proton and carbon 90° pulse widths<br><br>
were ~4 jxsec with a contact time of 2.0 msec. The sample was spun at 7.0 kHz and a total of 600-800 scans were collected with a recycle delay of 7.0 sec. Sample temperature between -20 and -5 °C. A line broadening of 10 Hz was applied before FT was performed. Chemical shifts are reported on the TMS scale using the carbonyl carbon of glycine (176.03) as a secondary reference.<br>
Form A:<br>
The crystalline Form A of the compound of formula Ila is formed through crystallization from or contact with a mixture of water, methanol, and 1-propanol. This form is unambiguously characterized as having the XRPD pattern 18.44, 13.09, 8.43, 7.58, 6.48, 6.16, 5.55, 5.14,4.81,4.50,4.26,4.11,4.02, 3.85, 3.69, 3.41,3.35, 3.03, 3.25, 3.12, and 2.87 angstroms. More complete XRPD data pertaining to the compound is shown below in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>

The solid-state NMR pattern corresponding to Form A is shown in Figure 2. FormB:<br>
The crystalline Form B of the compound of formula Ha is formed through contact of the compound with a mixture of water and 2-propanol and is unambiguously characterized as having the XRPD pattern 18.48,13.02,11.27, 8.50, 7.51,6.51,6.13, 5.82, 5.13,4.78,4.67,4.50,4.24,4.06, 3.85, 3.69, 3.63, 3.41, 3.36, 3.31, 3.22, 3.11,2.98,2.87, and 2.77 angstroms.

The following examples are provided for illustrative purposes and should not be construed in any way as limiting the invention disclosed herein.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A hydrogenator is charged with 63 g of 5% Pd on carbon catalyst (dry weight) in 1.8 L of water. The Vessel is placed under hydrogen then vented and<br><br>
placed under nitrogen. Sodium hydroxide (68 g, 50 wt%) is charged adjusting the pH to about 7.5 with carbon dioxide.<br>
The enol phosphate (170 g) and the thiol (86 g) are dissolved in 1.3 L of N-ethylpyrrolidinone (NEP). The mixture is cooled to below -40°C and 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine (109 g) is added. After 3 hours, the reaction mixture is quenched into the hydrogenator at below 15 °C adjusting the pH to about 8 with carbon dioxide. The vessel is placed under hydrogen. When the reaction is complete, the hydrogen is vented and the reaction mixture is treated with activated carbon and filtered. The filtrate is extracted with iso-amyl alcohol containing diphenylphosphoric acid (240 g) and 50 wt% NaOH (44 g). The resulting aqueous solution is further extracted with iso-amyl alcohol to give an aqueous solution containing at least 90 mg/mL of the compound of formula Ha (predominantly in the stabilized form, 4). Both extractions are performed using two CINC (Costner Industries Nevada Corporation) centrifugal separators set in series for countercurrent extraction. 1-Propanol is added (20% by volume) and the resulting solution is cooled to below -5 °C. The pH is adjusted to 5.5 at below -5 °C using a solution of acetic acid in methanol (3 M). Methanol and 1-propanol are added to 0.5 and 0.25 volumes total relative to the aqueous solution from the extraction. The resulting solution is seeded with a slurry containing 0.1 g of the compound of formula Ha in a mixture of water, methanol, and 1-propanol (2,1, and 0.5 mL, respectively) prepared at -10 °C, The product is then crystallized at below -5 °C by adding methanol and 1-propanol to bring the total of each to one volume relative to the aqueous solution from the extraction and isolated by filtration to give the compound of formula Ha crystalline solid (Form A). The solid is washed with a mixture of 2-propanol and water (85:15 v/v, 10 mL/assay g of compound Ha) at below 10 °C to give a compound of formula Ha as a crystalline solid (Form B).<br>

The crystalline material derived by washing the solid with a mixture of methyl acetate containing 2% (w/v) water (Form C) was placed under vacuum with a nitrogen sweep through the solid. The cake temperature was maintained below 7 °C. The dew point of the nitrogen was at least 2 °C below the temperature of the cake during the residual solvent reduction operation. The water content of the solid was maintained between 16 and 20%. The operation was completed with dry nitrogen to give compound of formula Ha containing 16 to 22% water and less than 1.5% methyl acetate and less than 0.5% residual alcohol solvents. The loss in purity is typically 0.2 to 0.5 area% by HPLC analysis.<br>
