				<td>FIELD  OF  INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an antiblock system for use with a crane. In particular, this invention relates to an antiblock system which prevents a dangling of the snatch block while the crane is in movement over a surface.<br>
BACKGROUND  OF  THE  INVENTION<br>
A disadvantage assoicated with the known construction of cranes is that while the crane is in movement on the road or in the field, the snatch block dangles or swings randomly. Such a dangling movement can damage the snatch block and the winch rope.<br>
OBJECT OF. THE  INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose an antiblock system for use with a crane and which obviates the aforesaid disadvantage.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose an antiblock system for use with a crane which does not allow dangling of the snatch block while the crane is in movement over a surface.<br>
Still   another object  of this  invention is   to propose  an  antiblock  system  for use with  a  crane which  works  as  an  over-hoist  protection  system.<br>
Yet   another  object  of this  invention  is   to propose  an  antiblock  system  for use with  a  crane which   provides  more  working    clearance  to   the operator.<br>
A   further   object  of this   invention  is   to propose  an  antiblock  system  for use with  a  crane and  wherein the wire  rope  remains in tension.<br>
DESCRIPTION  OF. THE  INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided an antiblock system for use with a crane to<br>
prevent    a  dangling  of  the  snatch   block   while<br>
the  crane is in  movement over a  surface   comprising:<br>
i)      said   snatch    block   assembly   having   an<br>
auxilliary   block  with  a  seat,<br>
ii)      an  engaging member  held  to a  front  plate,<br>
said  engaging  member   adapted  to be disposed within<br>
said   seat    when  the  snatch  block   is   actuated<br>
towards  said  front  plate,<br>
iii)       a  shock  absorbing  member  provided   with<br>
said   front   plate.<br>
iv&gt;         a   rear   plate  disposed   in  a   spaced<br>
relationship  to said  front  plate,<br>
v) a limit switch held to said rear plate and disposed in the proximity of said front plate and being in an actuated condition when said front plate strikes or bears against the front end of the limit switch.<br>
In   accordance   with  this    invention    an auxialliary    block    is  welded  or   held   to  the<br>
snatch   block,  said   auxilliary   block   having   a seat.<br>
The device further comprises an engaging member held to a front plate, said engaging member adapted to be disposed within said seat.<br>
A  coiled  spring embraces	a  spindle, one  end<br>
of   said   spring   adapted  to	rest  on  the   front<br>
plate, the  opposite  end  adapted	to  bear  against  a<br>
rear  plate.<br>
The spindle extends through the rear plate and has engaging threads for receiving a nut. The nut bears against the rear plate and such that by rotating the spindle the force exerted by the shock absorbing member on the front plate can be adjusted.<br>
The front plate is a movable plate, a limit switch is provided with the rear plate, the front end of said limit switch adapted to be disposed in the proximity but in a spaced<br>
relationship    to  said   front   plate.   The	limit<br>
switch   is  connected    to the  winch   motor	or   to<br>
any  suitable  signal means, said  limit  switch	being<br>
in   an  actuated  condition  when the    front	plate<br>
strikes   the  front  end  of  said  switch.<br>
DESCRIPTION   OF  THE   INVENTION  WITH    REFERENCE  TO ACCOMPANYING  DRAWINGS<br>
Further    objects   and   advantages   of	this<br>
invention     will   be   more    apparent    from	the<br>
ensuing   description  when read   in  conjunction	with<br>
the  accompanying   drawings  and  wherein:<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the anti block system is held to a boom 11 of a crane through a pivot plate 12. Such features of a crane having a boom 11 and a pivot plate 12 are known in<br>
the   art  and   do  not   form   a   concept   of  the present  invention.<br>
Specifically, the present invention resides in an antiblock system mounted on a bush 10 between two pulleys 13 on the pivot plate 12 of boom 11. An auxiliary block 4 is welded on an upper plate 3 of the snatch block assembly 14. Block 4 has a seat 4a. The device further comprises a front plate 6 held to the lower end of a spindle 15. A frusto conical engaging member comprising a pin 2 and a stud 3 is held to spindle 15 and bears against plate 6.<br>
It is generally known that while travelling without load, an operator needs to wind the rope up with the help of a winch motor. A disadvantage associated with the prior art is that even while raising the snatch block, it is retained in a dangling condition. Such a disadvantage is obviated by the present invention. Thus, while<br>
 raising the snatch block 14, block 4 with seat 4a gets engaged with pin 2 first and then member 3. As seat 4a has a matching profile to that of pin 2 and member 3 a dangling movement of snatch block assembly 14 is prevented. Reference is made to a frusto conical member. However the member can be of any other shape with seat 4 a having a mating profile.<br>
When the operator continues to wind the winch rope, block 4 pushes plate 6 upwards and against a force applied by coiled spring 7. One end of spring 7 rests on front plate 7, the opposite end is adapted to bear against a rear plate 5. Spindle 15 extends through rear plate 5 and has threads mating with threads of nut 1. Nut 1 bears against plate 5. A limit switch- 8 is held to plate 5, the front end of limit switch 8 terminating away but in the proximity of front plate 6.<br>
Upon a contact being established between plate 6 and limit switch 8 consequential to the further upward displacement of front plate 6, limit switch 8 is activated. Limit switch is connected to an audio alarm (not shown) so that an operator receives an alarm that the snatch block is in a. locked condition, and to thereby stop the further winding of the wire rope. Pin 2 and member 3 being engaged with in seat 4a ensures a prevention of a dangling of the snatch block.<br>
The distance of the center of hook 16 from the pulley center is reduced to 860 mm from 1360 mm of the known art, and thereby provides an additional 0.5m clearance below snatch block 14, in turn the lift height is gained by 0.5m. Hence the workable clearance also increases. The wire rope remains in tension which ensures that the wire rope doesn't foul with anything and it also doesn't get entangled.<br><br><br><br><br>
