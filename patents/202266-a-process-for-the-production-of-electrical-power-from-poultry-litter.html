				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This  invention relates to a process for the  production  of electrical  power  from poultry litter  and  the  bio-methanation reactor for carrying out the process. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According  to  this invention is provided an improved  method  of<br>
producing  methane  gas  and organic manure  from  raw  materials<br>
for generating electric power comprising the steps of!<br>
processing and converting the organic manure to sludge, pressure<br>
inducing said sludge into a digester for agitation with microbial<br>
consortium and additives,<br>
recycling the treated effluent for uniform stabilisation in said<br>
digester,<br>
separating  the  produced methane from the  digested  sludge  and<br>
removing methane from the digester,<br>
purifying  and compressing said removed methane for storage in  a<br>
gas holder,<br>
characterised in that said raw material comprises poultry litter<br>
processed at ambient temperature, said sluge is induced at the<br>
bottom  of said digester having partial partition wall  installed<br>
below the ground level thereby producing said methane by vertical<br>
agitation.<br><br>
In  accordance  with this invention, poultry litter  in the<br>
form of, for eg. solid waste is subjected to rasping and	sieving<br>
and is subsequently converted into sludge by mixing with	water. A<br>
consortium  of microbes and additives are added and the	mass  is<br>
fed into a digester and agitated to produce methane. The	methane<br>
is purified to remove moisture and other gases and stored and fed<br>
to engines for power production.<br>
The proportion of poultry litter and water varies from 100:150 to 100:200% w/w.<br>
The  microbial  consortium consists of  cellulolytic  culture  of fungi which is added in a proportion of 0.01 to 0.02*/. w/w.<br>
The  raw  material  is processed at  ambient  temperature  before<br>
feeding into the digester. The temperature in the digester varies<br>
o	o<br>
between 50 and 80 C, preferably between 59 to 75 C. The pressure<br>
in  the  digester is maintained upto 50 psi, preferably  in  the<br>
range of 20 to 30 psi and the pH is in the range of 7.2 to 7.8.<br><br>
The retention time is from about 30 to 40 days. The mass is agitated in the digester at a frequency of about 4 to 8 times/day based on the reactor size.<br>
The microbial consortium used comprises cellulolytic culture of fungi in the range of 0.01 to 0.03%, and said additives used comprise sugarcane trash and vegetable waste in the range of 0.08 to 0.40%..<br>
Petrol engines in various capacities can be run successfully by 100%. methane gas with modified air and gas composition ratio. This has been achieved by certain modifications in the carburetor to be suitable for the utilization of 100% methane gas. No changes or modifications are required in the existing diesel and petrol engines.<br>
The methane is produced through anaerobic reactor and it is used to run the diesel and petrol engines, motors, etc. to generate power. A bio-methanation is activated through « consortium of bacteria and fungi with enzyme block mechanisms.<br>
In accordance with an embodiment of this invention is provided  a<br>
system for production of the biogas. The converted sludge is  fed<br>
into  a bio-methanation system for vertical agitation to  produce<br>
bio-gas.  The  produced bio-gas is cleaned in  the  gas  purifier<br>
provided  with  the system for removal of moisture and  H S.  The<br>
cleaned gas after compression through an assigned  air-compressor<br><br>
is stored into a gas holder for subsequent feeding to a modified engine of a generator producing electricity.<br>
The bio-methanation system designed as a process and pressure induced vertically agitated load dependency energy system (PAVEL SYSTEM-I) basically comprises a two-way system wherein vertical agitation of the induced sludge is carried out at the bottom of the digester unit of the system provided with a partition wall. The produced methane gas is passed through a gas purifier unit installed outside the digester unit whereafter purification of the produced gas is processed through a compressor unit. The compressed gas is then stored in a gas holder unit for subsequent transmission to an engine of a generator. A feed-mixing unit of the system is provided at the ground level where said sludge is produced by processing the raw material through removal of impurities in a filter process and then subjecting the filtered waste to rasping, grinding and sieving. The system i© inter¬connected through a tubular network, a power driven feed pump, an outlet pumping means and a plurality of regulating means designed as valve means.<br>
In a further devleopment in accordance with the invention, there is  provided a PAVEL SYSTEM~II which basically comprises a  four-way  multipurpose  system provided with  four  number  regulating means  serving  the purpose of feeding,  re-rasping,  mixing  and release of spent sludge from the digester.<br><br>
The invention is explained in more detail below in conjunction with the exemplary embodiments with reference to the accompanying figures, of which s<br>
FiQ.l shows a flow diagram of the first embodiment of a bio-methanation system (PAVEL SYSTEM-I) according to the invention;<br>
Fig.2 shows a flow diagram of the second embodiment of a bio-methanation system (PAVEL-SYSTEM-II&gt; according to the invention.<br>
Fig.l illustrates a process and pressure induced vertically agitated load dependency energy system (PAVEL SYSTEM-I) according to the invention in the form of a flow diagram. The feed mixing tank. (FMT) is installed at the ground level where raw material is processed at ambient temperature and the produced sludge is induced through bottom partial opening (BPO) of the agitator installed below the ground level. The agitation with microbial consortium takes place within the partial partition wall (PPW) and the sludge is pressure-induced by a first pump (P) through a first omni-directional tubular network regulated by a pair of valve means (V). The produced methane gas is recycled through a second omni-directional tubular network by a second pump (P) regulated by a third valve means (V). The produced gas is stored in a gas holder (6H). The produced sludge is removed through the outlet pumping (OLP) to separate the water in the effluent. The remaining solid sludge is sent to the manure preparation bed.<br><br>
Fig.2 illustrates the PAVEL SYSTEM-II comprising isolated units for feed-mixing tank) agitator, gas purifier, compressor, gas holder and generator, all of such units are inter-connected by a tubular network provided with pumping means and regulating means. The system is provided with four-way regulating means for recycling of produced methane.<br><br><br>
