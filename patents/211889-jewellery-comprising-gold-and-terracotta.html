FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention Is related to fashion Jewellery, resulting from a fusion of gold with terracotta (earthen clay mixture, oven fired) used to produce by different methods, a range of Jewellery items, to wit, bangles, chains, necklaces, ear rings, rings, bracelets etc.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Objects designed for the adornment of the body are usually made of precious metals such as gold, silver, or platinum, etc often with precious or semiprecious stones and such organic substances as pearls, coral, amber and the like.<br>
Jewellery evolved from shells, animal teeth, and other objects were also used as adornment in prehistoric times. However Terracotta, a reddish brown baked clay originally used to make utensils, pots, cups, saucers, spoons and wall hangings was also exploited for Jewelry making. With passage of time and innovation, the material was poured In moulds and heated at very high temperatures with intricate designs carved on them instilling art and beauty.<br>
Ornaments made of pure gold or blended with stones etc, be they of whichever shapes and sizes, are also most common in the world and has always attracted the attention of mankind from times immemorial.<br><br>
However the combination of gold/Diamond and terracotta fused together to produce a raving variety of Jewellery is the novel feature of this invention. A mix of fashion and tradition, the Tera Auram Jewellery as it is nomenclatured is designed to add a different flavour and touch to the jewellery family. The contemporary world desires something new, unique, creative and Innovative, a real necessity for today's highly mobile and fashion conscious populace which this patent addresses. This revolutionary practice uses chunks of terracotta in different shapes and sizes strung together with golden inlays to flash out exclusive jewellery.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to fuse gold on terracotta to project amazing , dazzling and aesthetic jewellery.<br>
It is an object of the invention to fuse diamond on terracotta to project amazing, dazzling and aesthetic jewellery.<br>
It is another object of the invention to use effective, specially made adherents derived from agents like wax and neem to hold the gold on a surface tike terracotta.<br>
It is another object of the invention to knit the terracotta chunks with gold inlays using pliable metallic wires to create chains, ear rings, necklaces, pendants, bracelets, bangles etc following the riveting and tassling techniques.<br>
It is another object of the invention to create a fashionable jewellery with the filigree work embossed on the terra cotta around the gold pieces projecting a 3 dimensional effect following the bonding technique which comprises of a technique for fusing gold over terracotta and a technique for fusing terracotta over gold.<br><br>
The above and other objects are fulfilled by this gold/diamond fused terracotta Jewellery. This revolutionary practise uses chunks of terracotta in different shapes and sizes strung together with golden inlays to flash out exclusive jewellery.<br>
The earthen ware, in the form of fairly coarse, porous type, reddish brown clay is collected from the tank beds in and around towns and villages .The clay is then allowed to dry in the sun. The dried clay Is powdered and put in a tub containing water. This is stirred well and filtered through a sieve. This sieved clay is collected and allowed to settle. After a few days the excessive water Is decanted. The clay in a slurry form is allowed to dry In trays. The plastic like clay is taken and made into coils or thin slabs, then cut into required size and shaped into beads. These beads are sculpted and exquisite designs are drawn over the semi soft clay, and are allowed to dry naturally and baked at 800C In kiln. The day hardens to a rocky substance and are then painted to envisage a shiny ,luscious and slick appearance. Colour and finishing depends upon the baking. Bits of gold in traditional flower like structure, semi circle, circle and all other conceivable geometric shapes are engraved on the terracotta with fine filigree work to cast idiosyncratic designs. The fusion of gold/diamond pieces on terracotta ami the terracotta on gold is the emphatic novel feature of this product. Gold and terracotta are fused in different methods, which can be broadly classified as follows<br><br><br>
I) Agents like wax and neem glue are applied at a certain temperature resulting in fusion. The strong glues and adheslves are made exclusively for the fusion of gold on terracotta which binds them together in full strength and support. The viscous, gelatinous adherant is produced with great care to stick the gold chunks on a surface like terracotta , after immense research and study which has yielded fruitful results. The paste clings the gold pieces to the terracotta so tight that its durability and quality is highly assured.<br>
b) Terra cotta over gold<br>
i) Indigenous techniques like prongs are used to place pieces of terracotta over gold.<br>
I) Pieces of gold are laid over terra cotta and fastened below with rivets and prongs.<br>
3)Tassling<br>
i) Pieces of gold and terracotta inlaid with gold, are strung fashionably to create pleasing jewelry designs. The different pieces of terracotta and gold beads are knit together to form long and choker like chains and the pendant made separately following the abovesaid procedure is attached to present a beautiful, traditional, fashionable necklace.<br><br>
After the fusion of gold and terracotta following one or all of the above methods according to the pattern and design of jewelry, they are strung together on strong thread and ends are tied with tasseled chords. Such fashion jewellery is also produced by the fusion of diamond with terracotta on similar lines. By this process different types of necklaces, ear rings, bracelets, rings, hairpins etc. are made. Some of the jewelry is painted to suit the customer tastes. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Description of the invention will now be given with reference to the attached FIGS. 1-6. It should be noted that these figures are merely illustrative in nature and in no way serve to limit the scope of the invention to such illustrations alone, which is defined by the claims appearing herein below.
