RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S.Provisional Application Serial Number<br>
60/413,833, filed September 20, 2002, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a biocompatible drug release matrix for a medical<br>
device and a method of preparing a device to inhibit restonisis.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the western world. In the<br>
United States, more than 13 million people are diagnosed with CAD every year. Since its<br>
introduction in the late 1970's, Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA), also<br>
known as balloon angioplasty, emerged as the principal, less invasive alternative to Coronary<br>
Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG). A limitation of PTCA is a high rate of restenosis, a condition<br>
in which the vasculature renarrows within six months of a revascularization treatment to less<br>
than 50% of its original size. Restenosis is caused by the activation and growth of vascular<br>
smooth muscle cells that make the vessel more susceptible to complete blockage. Studies have<br>
shown restenosis affects between about 25% to about 45% of PTCA patients within six months<br>
after the procedure.<br>
Coronary stents lower restenosis rates by decreasing the vascular recoil after balloon<br>
angioplasty. A stent is a mesh-like tubular device resembling a spring that is capable of<br>
propping open a clogged artery when placed within the vessel using a specialized delivery device<br>
such as the balloon catheter used in angioplasty procedures. The stent serves as a permanent<br>
scaffolding for the newly widened vessel. Stents are percutaneous non-surgical treatments that<br>
lower the restenosis rate of PTCA by achieving a larger final luminal area. To date, stents have<br>
reduced the likelihood of acute closure after coronary revascularization procedures.<br>
Immediately after the implantation of a stent, the healine orocess within the vasculature<br>
causes an overgrowth of cells and substances within and around the stent, increasing the<br>
potential for a recurrence of the blockage. The healing process leads to neointima formation<br>
which is initiated by activation of vascular smooth muscle cells, followed by emigration and<br>
proliferation with subsequent elaboration of the abundant extracellular matrix by the smooth<br>
muscle cells. As the smooth muscle cells grow on and around the stent, the vasculature<br>
renarrows and restenosis continues. Inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation appears to<br>
prevent the development of subsequent blockages within the vasculature as the diameter of the<br>
passageway through the vasculature is reduced by the smooth muscle cell proliferation.<br>
Several therapeutic agents have been used in combination with stents to inhibit restenosis<br>
in the prior art. U.S. Patent No. 6,569,195 to Yang et al. discloses a stent having a polymeric<br>
coating for controllably releasing an included active agent. The Yang et al. coating includes a<br>
blend of a first co-polymer having a first, high release rate and a second co-polymer having a<br>
second, lower release rate relative to the first release rate. U.S. Patent No. 6,171,609 to Kunz<br>
discloses a therapeutic inhibitor of vascular smooth muscle cells. The Kunz device utilizes a<br>
cytoskeletal inhibitor and an amount of a cytostatic therapeutic agent to inhibit stenosis or reduce<br>
restenosis.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,344,035 to Chudzik et al. discloses a coating composition for use with<br>
medical devices to improve the ability of the device to release a bioactive agent in vivo. The<br>
coating composition includes the bioactive agent with a mixture of a first polymer component<br>
such as poly(butyl methacrylate) and a second polymer component such as poly(ethylene-co-<br>
vinyl acetate). The Chudzik et al. device requires the mixture of a first polymer component such<br>
as poly(butyl methacrylate) and a second polymer component such as poly (ethylene-co-vinyl<br>
acetate). In addition, the Chudzik et al. device is limited by the ability of titrating the release rate<br>
of the bioactive agent.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,788,979 to Alt et al. discloses a biodegradable coating with inhibitory<br>
properties for application to biocompatible materials. The Alt et al. device comprises a coating<br>
material comprising an anticoagulant drug wherein the coating material is adhesively applied to a<br>
surface of the biocompatible material in a substantially continuous overlying layer having a<br>
formulation, pattern and thickness selected according to a period of time in which the coating<br>
material exhibits the inhibitory action. The Alt et al. coating has shown a potential of triggering<br>
a severe vessel inflammation by activating cells after the polymer of the biodegradable coating is<br>
broken down in the vessel.<br>
The prior art is ineffective at inhibiting restenosis and subjects patients to undesirable <br>
health risks. The prior art is limited to mixtures of specific polymer components and does not<br>
provide adequate control of the drug elution to treat a lesion. In addition, the prior art has shown<br>
a potential of triggering a severe vessel inflammation by activating cells after the polymer is<br>
broken down in the vessel. Therefore, there remains a need in the art for a method of treating a<br>
localized area of a diseased vessel after delivery of a biocompatible implantable medical device<br>
that can control the elution of the drug and is does not harm the patient.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
An apparatus for a biocompatible implantable medical device comprising a<br>
biocompatible drug release matrix is illustrated generally at 99 in FIG. 1. In a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 is a stent.<br>
The present invention can be used with stents known in the art including, but not limited to, the<br>
stents described in Assignee's co-pending patent applications Serial No. 09/624,812 and Serial<br>
No. 10/410,950, the entirety of these applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the biocompatible implantable medical device<br>
99 is a catheter, a vascular prosthesis, an intravenous canule or a similar device. The<br>
biocompatible implantable medical device 99 has a tubular body comprising a plurality of<br>
circumferential bands 37 and a plurality of circumferential row of links 69 that engage the<br>
plurality of circumferential bands 37. A circumferential row of links engages adjacent<br>
circumferential bands. The biocompatible implantable medical device 99 comprises a proximal<br>
end band 98 located at a proximal end 97, a distal end band 96 located at a distal end 95 and at<br>
least one intermediate band located between proximal end band 98 and distal end band 96. In the<br>
embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 1, the biocompatible implantable medical<br>
device 99 comprises the proximal end band 98, the distal end band 96 and intermediate<br>
circumferential bands 30, 32, 34, 36, 38,40,42,44 and 46. The number of the circumferential<br>
bands 37, the number of the circumferential rows of links 69, a length of the biocompatible<br>
implantable medical device 99 and a diameter of the biocompatible implantable medical device<br>
99 vary depending upon the application of the biocompatible implantable medical device 99.<br>
The plurality of circumferential bands 37 are arranged axially end to end, extending from the<br>
proximal end 97 of the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 to the distal end 95 of the<br>
biocompatible implantable medical device 99. Each of the plurality of the circumferential bands<br>
37 is comprised of a continuous strand 75 that is shaped in a zig-zag pattern shown in FIG. 1.<br>
The plurality of circumferential row of links 69 engage adjacent circumferential bands. In the<br>
embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 1, circumferential rows of links 60, 62, 64,<br>
66,68, 70, 72, 74, 76 and 78 engage adjacent circumferential bands. For example, the<br>
circumferential row of links 64 engages intermediate circumferential bands 32 and 34.<br>
FIG. 2 shows an enlarged fragmentary view of the distal end 95 of the biocompatible<br>
implantable medical device 99 of the present invention. FIG. 2 illustrates the tubular shape of<br>
the biocompatible implantable medical device 99. FIG. 2 shows the circumferential row of links<br>
60 engaging the distal end band 96 and the intermediate band 30. In addition, circumferential<br>
row of link 62 engages the adjacent intermediate bands 30 and 32.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a portion of adjacent circumferential bands 30, 32 and a link 35 from<br>
circumferential row of link 62 where the link 35 engages the intermediate band 30 to the<br>
intermediate band 32. A portion of the strand 75 for intermediate circumferential band 30<br>
comprises a loop 65 that further comprises two legs 71 and 73. The legs 71 and 73 converge to<br>
form a bend 77 and a gap 79 opposing the bend 77. In a continuing pattern, a loop 105 is formed<br>
by the leg 73 and a leg 93 to form a bend 107 with a gap 109 opposing the bend 107. In a similar<br>
manner, a portion of the strand 75 for adjacent circumferential band 36 comprises a loop 85 that<br>
further comprises a leg 81 and a leg 83. The leg 81 and the leg 83 converge to form a bend 87<br>
with a gap 89 opposing the bend 87. In a continuing pattern for circumferential band 32, a loop<br>
101 comprises the leg 83 and the leg 103, with the leg 83 and the leg 103 converging to form a<br>
bend 117 with a gap 111 opposing the bend 117. Each strand 75 for each circumferential band<br>
37 comprises a plurality of loops with each circumferentially adjacent loop sharing a common<br>
leg.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the circumferential bands 30 and 32 are circumferentially formed of<br>
alternating bends and gaps. For example, an edge 120 of the circumferential band 30, (shown as<br>
a broken line in FIG. 3) is formed partially of the bend 77 and the gap 109. Similarly, an edge<br>
122 of the circumferential band 32, (shown as a broken line in FIG. 3) is formed partially of the<br>
bend 87 and the gap 111. Within each of the plurality of the circumferential bands 37, a bend is<br>
longitudinally opposed by a gap. For example, with respect to the circumferential band 30, the<br>
bend 77 longitudinally opposes the gap 79 and the bend 107 longitudinally opposes the gap 109.<br>
Adjacent circumferential bands are longitudinally positioned so the bends forming the edge of<br>
one circumferential band are aligned with the bends forming the opposing edge of the adjacent<br>
circumferential band. For example, the bend 77 of the circumferential band 30 is adjacent to the<br>
bend 87 of the circumferential band 32.<br>
The plurality of the circumferential rows of links 69 engage the plurality of<br>
circumferential bands 37. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, each individual<br>
link from the plurality of circumferential rows of links 69 is formed by two oppositely oriented<br>
curves that are engaged to form a link. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
two oppositely oriented curves form a S link. In another embodiment of the present invention,<br>

the release kinetics, decrease the toxicity or enhance the potency of the drug 55. The compound<br>
to alter the release kinetics of the drug includes, but is not limited to, albumin, sodium chloride,<br>
chitosan, mannitol, heparin, steroids, glucose, glycoproteins, lipoproteins, estradiol, fibrin,<br>
antimitotics, and combinations of the above. Those skilled in the art will recognize the drug can<br>
be linked to other compounds known in the art to alter the release kinetics of the drug and be<br>
within the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
The release kinetics and transport of the drug 55 can be altered by molecular bond<br>
degradation, a breakdown of the link of the drug 55 and the compound. The drug 55 may be<br>
covalently bonded to a the compound that acts as a carrier molecule. Typically, the drug 55 will<br>
not be active until the bond between the drug 44 and the carrier molecule breaks down through<br>
exposure to moisture (i.e., bodily fluids), exposure to heat or another applied energy source, or<br>
) chemical triggers. For example, a systemic pharmaceutical trigger such as swallowing a pill,<br>
locally delivered pharmaceuticals via infusion catheter or locally delivering heat energy in the<br>
form of heat or light can affect the breakdown of the link of the drug 55 and the compound. Once<br>
the bond is broken down, the drug 55 is available to treat the surrounding tissue. The carrier<br>
molecule is selected to enhance or modify the diffusion properties of the drug 55, to alter the<br>
potency of the drug 55 and to provide extremely long elution rates of the drug 55. Linking the<br>
drug 55 to the compound might also decrease the toxicity of the drug 55, thereby altering the<br>
dosage of the drug 55.<br>
FIG. 15 shows the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 of the present invention<br>
having a film 31 of the biocompatible polymer matrix 54 and the drug 55 covering a portion of<br>
the biocompatible implantable medical device 99. FIG. 16 shows the biocompatible implantable<br>
medical device 99 of the present invention having the film 31 covering a portion of the<br>
biocompatible implantable medical device 99 with biocompatible implantable medical device 99<br>
visible through the film 31. FIG. 17 shows a front view of the biocompatible implantable<br>
medical device 99 having the film 31 covering the biocompatible implantable medical device 99.<br>
In the embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 15, the film 31 comprising the<br>
biocompatible polymer matrix 54 and the drug 55 is applied to the primer layer 51. In another<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the film 31 comprising the biocompatible polymer matrix<br>
54 and the drug 55 is applied to the strut 50. In the embodiment of the present invention shown<br>
in FIG. 15, the film 31 covers an outer surface 33 of the primer layer 51 between the proximal<br>
end 97 and the distal end 95 of the biocompatible implantable medical device 99. In another<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the film 31 covers an inner surface 63 of the primer layer<br>
between the proximal end 97 and the distal end 95 of the biocompatible implantable medical<br>
device 99. In another embodiment of the present invention, the film 31 covers the outer surface<br>
33 of the primer layer 51 and the inner surface 63 of the primer layer between the proximal end<br>
97 and the distal end 95 of the biocompatible implantable medical device 99.<br>
The film 31 of the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 can be deposited or<br>
stretched over the strut 50 or the primer layer 51 of the biocompatible implantable medical<br>
device 99. In one embodiment of the present invention, the film 31 is deposited or stretched on<br>
the strut 50 or the primer layer 51 so the film 31 plastically deforms on an expansion of the<br>
biocompatible implantable medical device 99. A plastic deformation of the film 31 is a<br>
permanent deformation of the film 31 that prevents radial compressive forces from the film 31<br>
transferring to the primer layer 51 and/or the strut 50 after expansion of the biocompatible<br>
implantable medical device 99. In another embodiment of the present invention, the film 31<br>
expands elastically with the biocompatible implantable medical device 99. In one embodiment<br>
of the present invention, the film 31 comprises the same materials of the biocompatible polymer<br>
matrix 54 as discussed above. In an embodiment of the present invention, the film 31 is a porous<br>
structure comprised of the same materials as the biocompatible polymer matrix 54. In another<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the film 31 comprises the biocompatible polymer matrix<br>
54 and the drug 55 to provide a more even distribution of the drug 55 over the outer surface 106<br>
and inner surface of the biocompatible implantable medical device 99. In another embodiment,<br>
the covering consists of a plurality of films spaced along the length of the biocompatible<br>
implantable medical device 99 allowing for greater flexibility than a single film 31 alone.<br>
FIG. 18 shows a side plan view of the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 of<br>
the present invention engaged on an outside surface 57 of a balloon 41 of a balloon catheter 48.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the biocompatible implantable medical<br>
device 99 is crimped onto the outside surface 57 of the balloon 41 of the balloon catheter 48.<br>
Crimping is performed to engage the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 onto the<br>
outside surface 57 of the balloon 41 through an interference fit. In one embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 is heated so the material<br>
comprising the balloon 41 softens around the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 to<br>
increase the retention forces between the balloon 41 and the biocompatible implantable medical<br>
device 99. High retention forces between the balloon 41 and the biocompatible implantable<br>
medical device 99 are desirable so the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 does<br>
disengage the balloon catheter 48 prior to the full expansion of the balloon 41. An inside surface<br>
of the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 engages the outside surface 57 of the<br>
balloon 41 of the balloon catheter 48. The balloon 41 of the balloon catheter 48 is supported by<br>
the balloon catheter 48 between a proximal end 58 of the balloon catheter 48 and a distal end 56<br>
of the balloon catheter 48. The balloon 41 engages the balloon catheter 48 at an at least one<br>
engagement position along a longitudinal axis of the balloon catheter 48. In a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the balloon 41 engages the balloon catheter 48 at a distal<br>
engagement position 47 and a proximal engagement position 49 in a manner known in the art. In<br>
the embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 18, the balloon 41 is a tri-fold balloon.<br>
The biocompatible implantable medical device 99 slides along the outer surface of the<br>
balloon catheter 48 and positioned over the balloon 41 of the balloon catheter 48. In a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 is<br>
centered with respect to the length span of the balloon 41. Once the biocompatible implantable<br>
medical device 99 is positioned with respect to the balloon, the biocompatible implantable<br>
medical device 99 is engaged onto the balloon 41 of the balloon catheter 48, causing an inner<br>
surface of the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 to engage to the outer surface 57 of<br>
the balloon 41 of the balloon catheter 48. The biocompatible implantable medical device 99 is<br>
engaged onto the balloon 41 of the balloon catheter in a manner known in the art. The diameter<br>
of the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 decreases after engaging the biocompatible<br>
implantable medical device 99 onto the outer surface 57 of the balloon 41 of the balloon catheter<br>
48. The pliable, shape sustaining material that comprises the strut 50 of the biocompatible<br>
implantable medical device 99 provides flexibility for the biocompatible implantable medical<br>
device 99 to be moved from a larger diameter in an unengaged state to a smaller diameter in an<br>
engaged state.<br>
The balloon catheter 48 is a small diameter hollow tube that is threaded through a vein or<br>
an artery of the vasculature. The balloon catheter 48 is a thin, flexible device that is used to<br>
deliver various medical devices to a treatment site in the vasculature. Various medical devices<br>
can be delivered through an inside of the balloon catheter 48 or along an outside surface of the<br>
balloon catheter 48. The balloon catheter 48 can be used to deliver fluids into the body or<br>
withdraw fluids from the body.<br>
hi a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the balloon catheter 48 comprises a<br>
strong, flexible and biocompatible material. In one embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
balloon catheter 48 comprises polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). In another embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the balloon catheter 48 comprises a material including, but not limited to,<br>
rubber, latex, silicone, PTFE, nylon, polyamide, polyethylene, polyurethanes, polyimide,<br>
stainless steel alloys, nickel-titanium alloy and similar materials. Those skilled in the art will<br>
recognize the balloon catheter may comprise many other materials known in the art and be<br>
within the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 19 shows a fragmentary cross section perspective view of the biocompatible<br>
implantable medical device 99, the balloon 41 and the balloon catheter 48. In the embodiment of<br>
the present invention shown in FIG. 19, a cross section of the biocompatible implantable medical<br>
device 99 is simplified to illustrate the coating as a single layer as opposed to the individual<br>
primer layer 51, elution layer 52 and burst control layer 53. The biocompatible implantable<br>
medical device 99 comprises an outer surface 106 and an inner surface 104 engaged to the outer<br>
surface 57 of the balloon 41 of the balloon catheter 48. As discussed above, the biocompatible<br>
implantable medical device 99 comprises an at least one layer surrounding the strut 50. In a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 19, an inflation lumen 90 is<br>
located inside of the balloon catheter 48. In another embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
inflation lumen 90 is located outside of the balloon catheter 48. The balloon 41 of the balloon<br>
catheter 48 comprises the outer surface 57 and an inner surface 59. The balloon catheter 48<br>
comprises a lumen extending along the longitudinal axis of the balloon catheter 48.<br>
The inflation lumen 90 is used to deliver a medium from an inflation mechanism to<br>
inflate the balloon 41. The inner surface 59 of the balloon 41 is in communication with the<br>
inflation lumen 90. The medium is delivered from the inflation mechanism and moves along the<br>
inflation lumen 90 and out of an at least one inflation opening 45. As the medium is delivered,<br>
the medium engages the inner surface 59 of the balloon 41 and the balloon 41 expands.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the medium is a liquid medium. In<br>
another embodiment of the present invention, the medium is water with a radiopaque contrast<br>
agent. In another embodiment of the present invention, the medium is saline. In another<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the medium is a gas. Those skilled in the art will<br>
recognize there are many media used to inflate a balloon known in the art that can be used and be<br>
within the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
The balloon catheter 48 with the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 engaged<br>
onto the balloon 41 of the balloon catheter 48 is inserted into the vasculature 43. The balloon<br>
catheter 48 is moved within the vasculature to a treatment area comprising a lesion in the<br>
vasculature 43. In an embodiment of the present invention, the balloon catheter 48 is pushed to<br>
move the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 to the lesion. In another embodiment of<br>
the present invention, the balloon catheter 48 is twisted to move the biocompatible implantable<br>
medical device 99 to the lesion. In another embodiment of the present invention, the balloon<br>
catheter 48 is rotated within the vasculature to move the biocompatible implantable medical<br>
device 99 to the lesion. Those skilled in the art will recognize the balloon catheter can be moved<br>
within the vasculature in many ways known in the art and be within the spirit and scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
FIG. 20 shows a cross section view of the vasculature 43 of the body, a lesion 80 along<br>
an inner surface of the vasculature 43, the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 and the<br>
balloon catheter 48 after the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 is moved within a<br>
lumen 82 of the lesion 80 and positioned proximal to the lesion 80. FIG. 20 shows a vasculature<br>
after an angioplasty procedure is performed. The angioplasty procedure compresses the lesion<br>
80 into the inside wall of the vasculature 43. hi the embodiment of the present invention shown<br>
in FIG. 20, the balloon 41 is uninflated and the outer surface of the biocompatible implantable<br>
medical device 99 does not engage an inner surface of the lesion 80. In the embodiment of the<br>
present invention shown in FIG. 20, a cross section of the biocompatible implantable medical<br>
device 99 comprises the strut 50 surrounded by a matrix layer 92. In one embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the matrix layer comprises the primer layer 51, the elution layer 52 and the<br>
burst control layer 53. In another embodiment of the present invention, the matrix layer<br>
comprises the primer layer 51 and the elution layer 52. In another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the matrix layer comprises the elution layer 52. Those skilled in the art will recognize<br>
the matrix layer can be comprised of various layers having various compositions and be within<br>
the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 21 shows a side plan view of the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 in an<br>
expanded configuration after inflation of the balloon 41 of the balloon catheter 48. The<br>
construction of the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 of the present invention with<br>
the plurality of circumferential row of links 69 and the plurality of circumferential bands 37<br>
allows the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 to be expanded from an undeployed<br>
configuration (FIG. 1) to the expanded configuration (FIG. 21). As the medium engages the<br>
inner surface 59 of the balloon 41, the balloon 41 inflates to a larger diameter causing the<br>
biocompatible implantable medical device 99 to expand in diameter with the inflated balloon 41.<br>
The biocompatible implantable medical device 99 increases from the smallest diameter<br>
corresponding to the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 engaged onto the uninflated<br>
balloon 41, to the diameter of the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 before the<br>
biocompatible implantable medical device 99 is engaged onto the balloon 41 of the balloon<br>
catheter 48, and finally to a largest diameter where the balloon 41 is inflated and the outer<br>
surface 106 of the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 engages the lesion 80.<br>
In the embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 21, the plurality of<br>
circumferential bands 37 are expanded. The design of the biocompatible implantable medical<br>
device 99 with the plurality of flexible links 69 and the pliable, shape forming material<br>
comprising both the struts 50 and the plurality of links 69 allows the biocompatible implantable<br>
medical device 99 to expand to the configuration shown in FIG. 21. For the biocompatible<br>
implantable medical device 99 in the expanded configuration shown in FIG. 21, alternating<br>
bends within a circumferential band are spaced farther apart when compared to the configuration<br>
where the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 is engaged onto the balloon 41 of the<br>
balloon catheter 48 or the configuration of the biocompatible implantable medical device 99<br>
before the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 is engaged onto the balloon 41 of the<br>
balloon catheter 48. For example, alternating bends 77 and 107 in circumferential band 30 are<br>
spaced further apart circumferentially than in the undeployed configuration shown in FIG. 4.<br>
The gaps 79 and 109 are spaced further apart circumferentially in the expanded configuration of<br>
FIG. 21. In addition, the plurality of circumferential links 69 allow for the biocompatible<br>
implantable medical device 99 to expand in a longitudinal direction.<br>
FIG. 22 shows a fragmentary cross section perspective view of the biocompatible<br>
implantable medical device 99 in the expanded configuration, the inflated balloon 41 and the<br>
balloon catheter 48. In the embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 22, the tri-folds<br>
of the balloon 41 are expanded such that there is no overlap of the material comprising the<br>
balloon 41.<br>
FIG. 23 shows a cross section view of the vasculature 43 and the lesion 80 with the<br>
biocompatible implantable medical device 99 in the expanded configuration, the inflated balloon<br>
41 and the balloon catheter 48. The inflation of the balloon 41 expands the biocompatible<br>
implantable medical device 99 into the expanded configuration and pushes the biocompatible<br>
implantable medical device 99 adjacent to the compressed lesion and into the wall of the<br>
vasculature 43. The outer surface 106 of the biocompatible implantable medical device 99<br>
engages the lesion 80 and compresses into the wall of the vasculature 43. In FIG. 23, the<br>
biocompatible implantable medical device 99 is implanted adjacent to the wall of the vasculature<br>
43.<br>
FIG. 24 shows a side plan view of the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 in<br>
the expanded configuration and the balloon 41 of the balloon catheter 48 deflated. The balloon<br>
41 of the balloon catheter 48 is deflated by removing the medium from within the balloon in a<br>
manner known in the art. Once the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 is implanted<br>
into the wall of the vasculature 43, the balloon 41 is deflated and the balloon catheter 48 with the<br>
balloon 41 is removed from the vasculature, leaving the biocompatible implantable medical<br>
device 99 implanted into the wall of the vasculature 43.<br>
FIG. 25 shows a cross section view of the strand 75 of the biocompatible implantable<br>
medical device 99 of the present invention engaging a wall of the vasculature and a profile of the<br>
drug elution across the thickness of the wall. FIG. 26 shows a cross section of the vasculature<br>
with the implanted biocompatible implantable medical device 99 of the present invention<br>
engaging the inner wall of the vasculature. The treatment area 147 illustrates an effective<br>
treatment area of the drug 55. The concentration of the drug 55 is greater near the surface of the<br>
biocompatible implantable medical device 99 and decreases farther away from the surface of the<br>
biocompatible implantable medical device 99.<br>
With the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 implanted into the wall of the<br>
vasculature 43, fluids engaging the biocompatible drug release matrix are transported into the<br>
biocompatible polymer matrix 54 and dissolve the drug 55 out of the biocompatible polymer<br>
matrix 54 to inhibit the proliferation of smooth muscle cells from the lesion 80. The fluid<br>
diffuses within the biocompatible polymer matrix 54 and dissolves the drug 55, therefore elution<br>
occurs and the drug 55 treats the smooth muscle cells from the lesion 80. The fluid transports<br>
out of the biocompatible polymer matrix 54 along with the drug 55 by virtue of a concentration<br>
gradient. The biocompatible polymer matrix 54 adds resistance to the transport of the fluid and<br>
slows the release of the drug 55. As the drug 55 moves out of the biocompatible polymer matrix<br>
54 and is transferred to the vessel wall, the biocompatible polymer matrix 54 for the specific<br>
coating layer is left porous. The drug engages the smooth muscle cells of the lesion 80 along the<br>
vessel wall and inhibits the growth of the smooth muscle cells to keep the vasculature open.<br>
The effectiveness of the inhibition of smooth muscle cell growth is a function of the total<br>
dose provided by the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 and the diug elution kinetics.<br>
The possibilities of loading an optimal therapeutic dose are limited by the total amount of drug<br>
that can be incorporated into the biocompatible polymer matrix 54. An inadequate amount of the<br>
drug 55 will not produce the desired effects of inhibiting restenosis, while an overabundance of<br>
the drug 55 can be toxic.<br>
The total dose (Dt) can be described per the biocompatible implantable medical device<br>
99, in micrograms per millimeter (ng/mm) of length of the biocompatible implantable medical<br>
device 99 or in micrograms per millimeter squared (u.g/mm2) of surface area of the<br>
biocompatible implantable medical device 99. After implantation of the biocompatible<br>
implantable medical device 99, the drug 55 is released based upon the properties of the<br>
biocompatible polymer matrix and the specific kinetics of the drug 55. The drug 55 moves<br>
through the surrounding tissues in the treatment area and results in a concentration within the<br>
tissue (measured in |ig/mm3 tissue, ug/ml of tissue or ug/mg tissue). The concentration of the<br>
drug within the tissue varies depending upon the distance from the strut 50 and the resistance<br>
from the various transport paths within the surrounding tissue.<br>
The biocompatible polymer matrix 54 provides control over the rate of elution of the<br>
drug 55. For the drugs 55 entrapped in the biocompatible polymer matrix 54, the dissolution of<br>
the drug 55 is controlled by numerous factors including, but not limited to, the biocompatible<br>
polymer matrix/drug ratio (which can be adjusted), the total dose incorporated into the polymer<br>
matrix, characteristics of the polymer matrix, drug linking, the coating layers. The dissolution of<br>
the drug 55 may also be controlled by the ratio of hydrophilic to hydrophobic polymers within<br>
the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 with a higher amount of the hydrophobic<br>
polymer reducing the rate of diffusion of fluids within the biocompatible polymer matrix 54.<br>
The drug 55 at the outer coating surface dissolves away fairly easily, while the drug 55 deeper<br>
within the coating layer elutes more slowly. As discussed above, slower removal of the drug 55<br>
results because the body fluid must first diffuse into the biocompatible polymer matrix 54, then<br>
the drug 55 must be dissolved and diffuse back out. The drug/biocompatible polymer matrix<br>
loading allows more of the drug 55 to be available sooner for release, and upon release leaves<br>
more voids in the biocompatible drug release matrix for faster diffusion and penetration of fluids<br>
into deeper structures of the biocompatible polymer matrix 54. The burst control layer 53 acts as<br>
a restriction to further reduce the rate of diffusion in and out of the elution layer 52.<br>
The drug elution kinetics are dependent upon various factors including, but not limited to,<br>
the type and amount of the drug 55 used, the type and amount of biocompatible polymer matrix<br>
54, the type and amount of solvent used and the use of the burst control layer 53. For example,<br>
the drug elution kinetics profile is dependent upon the thickness of the coating layer, the ratio of<br>
the drug 55 to the biocompatible polymer matrix 54, the ration of hydrophilic to hydrophobic<br>
polymers, the compatibility of the drug 55 and the biocompatible polymer matrix 54 and the<br>
solubility of the drug 55. Due to losses of the drug 55 from the treatment area through diffusion<br>
of the drug 55 into the blood and surrounding tissues, or inactivation of the drug 55 from<br>
exposure to proteins, it is difficult to predict the exact dosage of the drug 55 and the drug elution<br>
kinetics for the biocompatible implantable medical device 99. However, tissue deposition<br>
studies are used to adjust the drug elution kinetics and dosage of the drug 55 to provide the<br>
desired biological effect of inhibition of the proliferation of smooth muscle cells. In general, the<br>
drug elution kinetics is affected by the amount of the drug 55 in the biocompatible polymer<br>
matrix 54. The higher the amount of the drug 55 relative to the biocompatible polymer matrix<br>
54, the higher the amount of drug elution since there is more of the drug 55 to dissolve and more<br>
vacancies in the biocompatible polymer matrix 54 for the diffusion to occur.<br>
One example of a study was conducted to investigate the vascular smooth muscle cell<br>
proliferation (VSMC) from varying concentrations of the mitomycin C. The results of the study,<br>
demonstrated about 66% of the VSMC are inhibited with a dose of about 0.334 micrograms per<br>
milliliter, while about 98% of the VSMC are inhibited under a dose of about 25.1 micrograms<br>
per milliliter. An extrapolation from a logarithmic curve defined by points of the VSMC at<br>
various dosages of mitomycin C suggests that about 50% VSMC inhibition occurs at<br>
approximately 0.067 micrograms/milliliter of mitomycin C. A lower dosage of mitomycin C<br>
would still permit the advance of VSMC and contribute to increased restenosis and may be<br>
sufficient. Depending upon the observed biological effects from potentially cytotoxic local<br>
tissue levels, a higher concentration of mitomycin C may also still be sufficient.<br>
The drug elution kinetics should yield tissue concentration levels in the desired range<br>
during the healing cycle where smooth muscle cell activation and growth occurs. The<br>
proliferative phase of smooth muscle cell growth decreases after about fourteen days after the<br>
initial treatment (i.e. angioplasty procedure). In one embodiment, it may be desirable to yield a<br>
quicker burst dose of the drug 55 in the first few days (i.e., twenty-four to seventy-two hours)<br>
and then sustain a slow and steady level release of the drug 55 beyond the proliferative cycle, in<br>
a time as much as forty-five to sixty days from implant, to further protect against restenosis.<br>
The use of the burst control layer 53 also affects the drug elution kinetics. The burst<br>
control layer 53 acts as a restriction to limit the diffusion of the drug 55 out of the elution layer<br>
52 and burst control layer 53. In many cases, a large amount of the drug 55 is diffused from the<br>
biocompatible polymer matrix 54, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of smooth muscle cells<br>
with a large dosage of the drug 55 immediately. Over time as the smooth muscle cells<br>
proliferate, there is less of the drug 55 available to effectively inhibit the proliferation of smooth<br>
muscle cells, increasing the possibility for restenosis to occur. In particular, the burst control<br>
layer 53 with the biocompatible polymer matrix 54 absent of the drug 55 is used to reduce the<br>
initial dump of the drug 55 from the biocompatible polymer matrix 54. In addition, the burst<br>
control layer 53 comprising the biocompatible polymer matrix 54 and an amount of the drug 55<br>
can also affect the drug elution kinetics.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the biocompatible implantable<br>
medical device is designed so between about 10% and about 60% of the drug 55 is delivered to<br>
the lesion 80 in the first few days after implantation of the biocompatible implantable medical<br>
device 99. By allowing between about 10 percent and about 60 percent of the drug 55 to be<br>
delivered to the lesion 80 in the first few days after implantation, the remainder of the drug 55 is<br>
allowed to slowly diffuse out over time to effectively inhibit restenosis.<br>
FIG. 27 shows an elution profile of mitomycin C showing the release of mitomycin C<br>
from a coating of a biocompatible implantable medical device 99 of the present invention as a<br>
function of time. The vertical axis represents the percent of the drug 55 eluted to the tissue while<br>
the horizontal axis represents the time from implantation of the biocompatible implantable<br>
medical device 99. Treatment using the present invention can be viewed as four stages of drug<br>
elution that may require a variable amount of the drug 55 to achieve the desired effect. Upon<br>
implantation (to)of the biocompatible implantable medical device 99, there is an initial burst of<br>
the drug, DB, (Stage I) or a rapid release within about the first one to three days of exposure, ta,<br>
followed by a period of sustained release of the drug 55. The smooth muscle cell proliferation<br>
cycle during healing typically peaks at about two weeks and inhibition of the smooth muscle<br>
cells during this time period (Stage II) is essential. Late term elution (Stage HI) occurs after the<br>
two weeks and is characterized by residual elution of the drug 55. Over the period of sustained<br>
release (tm), an addition amount of the drug 55 is eluted from the biocompatible implantable<br>
medical device 99, shown as DM in FIG. 27. Late term elution of the drug 55 beyond the first two<br>
weeks after implantation my beneficially inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation. Stage IV<br>
begins when there is no drug 55 on or eluting from the biocompatible implantable medical<br>
device 99. As discussed previously, the amount of the drug 55 eluted from the FIG. 27, is<br>
typically less than the amount of the drug 55 in the biocompatible implantable medical device,<br>
shown as DT in FIG. 27.<br>
As discussed above, the drug release kinetics can be tailored to alter the burst dosage and<br>
the sustained release of the drug 55. FIG. 28 shows an elution profile of mitomycin C<br>
illustrating a high burst dosage (about 60% total dose elution) followed by a slow release of the<br>
drug 55 over about eight weeks. FIG. 29 shows an elution profile of mitomycin C illustrating a<br>
low burst dosage (about 20% total dose elution) followed by a slow release of the drug 55 over<br>
about eight weeks. FIG. 30 shows an elution profile of mitomycin C illustrating a high burst<br>
dosage (about 60% total dose elution) followed by a fast release of the drug 55 over about three<br>
weeks. FIG. 31 shows an elution profile of mitomycin C illustrating a low burst dosage (about<br>
20% total dose elution) followed by a fast release of the drug 55 over about three weeks.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, a total dosage of about 10 micrograms of the<br>
drug per millimeter of a length of the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 is coated on<br>
the biocompatible implantable medical device 99. In another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a total dosage of between about 0.5 and about 50 micrograms of the drug per<br>
millimeter of length of the biocompatible implantable medical device 99 is coated on the<br>
biocompatible implantable medical device 99. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the<br>
dosage of the drug per millimeter of a length of the biocompatible implantable medical device<br>
can vary and be within the spirit and scope of the present invention. An example calculation of<br>
the total dosage of the drug is shown below for several loss factors.<br>
An analytical method of calculating the dosage of the drug 55 on the biocompatible<br>
implantable medical device 99 is given by Equation 1 as follows:<br>
Equation 1 is a first order approximation of the total dose of the drug 55 assuming a daily<br>
consumption rate of the drug 55. In Equation 1, Lv is the treated length of the biocompatible<br>
implantable medical device 99, t is an effective treatment penetration depth, T is a constant<br>
elution time, C is a desired inhibitory concentration, V is a treated tissue volume, and X is the<br>
loss factor. For an L (Length) = 13 mm long stent expanded to D (Diameter) = 4.0 mm, an<br>
effective treatment penetration depth of t = 1.5 mm, a constant (steady) elution for T = 45 days<br>
maintaining a desired inhibitory concentration of C = 0.667 ug/ml per day, the following<br>
relationship between total dosage an loss factor can be estimated as:<br>
The loss factor, X, is a sum of the losses from direct diffusion of the drug 55 into the<br>
bloodstream, both during insertion and immediately after implantation, as well as losses resulting<br>
from the drug 55 trapped in the biocompatible polymer matrix 54 permanently (typically less<br>
than 10% of the total dosage loss). It is also possible to incorporate non-linearity of the elution<br>
rate within the loss factor. Using the above equation with loss factors ranging from 1% to 100%,<br>
the total dose of the drug is calculated with the results listed in FIG. 32.<br>
FIG. 33 shows a graph showing release of mitomycin C from a polymer stent coating<br>
stent delivered up to a forty day time period. The clinical data that forms FIG. 33 comes from a<br>
study of biocompatible implantable medical devices (stents) of the present invention implanted<br>
into porcine coronary arteries to analyze neointimal formation. The stent included a<br>
biocompatible polymer having polybutylmethacrylate (PBMA) and polyethylenevinylacetate<br>
(PEVA) in equivalent concentrations (1:1) co-solubilized with mitomycin C in a suitable solvent.<br>
The solution was then deposited via nebulizer onto a stent, where a homogeneous drug delivery<br>
matrix was formed by solvent evaporation. The dose of mitomycin was about 200 meg per stent<br>
corresponding to about 20% loading rate. Thus, the total mass of the coating including drug was<br>
between about 1800 meg and about 2000 meg.<br>
The drug release profile kinetics of mitomycin C release from the polymer used for stent<br>
coating was determined, in vitro, using the drug assay. Drug/polymer coated stents were placed<br>
in physiologic buffer solution at 37° C in a rotating incubator bath. Buffer samples were drawn<br>
at periodic intervals and assayed using a UV-VIS spectrophotomer. Rate curves were prepared<br>
to demonstrate the amount of drug released per day, given varying percent-loadings of drug. The<br>
30-day release profile was determined in for mitomycin-loaded stents. After a burst dose<br>
between about 25 meg and about 60 meg the first day, the mitomycin eluting stent delivered up<br>
to 30 days in a smooth-shaped kinetic release curves shown in FIG. 33.<br>
As shown in FIG. 33, the various burst dosages resulted in varying kinetic release curves.<br>
Coronary angiogram and inrravascular ultrasound (TVUS) imaging assessment of the treated<br>
arterial segments was performed following the same procedure as at the baseline and post-<br>
implantation. Coronary artery blood flow was assessed and a TIMI (thrombolysis in myocardial<br>
infarction) score assigned. By angiography, there was no evidence of in-steni: restenosis in the<br>
stents implanted in the suitable vessel segments in each coronary artery. The restenosis rate was<br>
0% and then flow was TIMI III. There was evidence of mild to moderate restenosis (
both ends in both stents ("edge effect") visible at angiography. By IVUS, there was total<br>
abolition of neointimal formation in the entire stent length in the stents. The edge effect was<br>
evident in the stents also by IVUS.<br>
The present invention is a method of inhibiting the growth of smooth muscle cells to<br>
inhibit restenosis comprising: providing abiocompatible implantable medical device; preparing<br>
a bioeompatible polymer matrix; co-solubilizing the biocompatible polymer matrix with a drug<br>

biocompatible drug release matrix on the biocompatible implantable medical device; allowing<br>
the solvent to evaporate; and implanting the biocompatible implantable medical device into a<br>
vasculature of a body.<br>
