				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The present invention relates to/an adaptor for coupling to an<br>
angle grinder and a method of making a concrete vibrator<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
For years, concrete vibrating equipment has been used to create vibration in concrete casting, in order to get homogeneous strength and compaction, as well as to avoid creation of air pockets in the concrete. Unti.' the present day, a dedicated device, which is useful only as a concrete vibrator has been used. This is due, inter alia, to the fact that a very powerful motor is required.<br>
Conventional vibrators include a vibrating poker connected to a flexible shaft. The vibrating poker is introduced into the concrete and, by the power o! the tumhg motor, it creates vibration throughout the concrete. The poker is usually of the new accentric or pendulum type. The shaft is generally composed of an outer layer with a flexible cable inside, which transmits power from the motor to the poker. The new accentric and the pendulum type of vibrator require different motors, as the required rate of rotation differs. Many such vibrotors are known in the art.<br>
Hie connection between the flexible shaft and the motor can be of different types, depending upon the maker of the vibrator and the particular powering jnit utilized. The powering units are generally either diesel/gasoline motors, or electric motors.<br>
The electric motors used in concrete vibrators are usually of about 2000W aud either take electricity from the mains line, or from portable<br>
1<br><br>
generators. They have a suitable connection to the flexible shaft to which the poker is attached.<br>
The fuel engines generally include an adapter mounted on the shaft, the adapter rising suitable for connecting the flexible shaft to which the poker is attached.<br>
One example of a pendulum type vibrator is described in US Patent 6,065,85!) to Breeding, This vibrator is a portable, hand-held concrete vibrating system employing a pendulous vibrator driven by a high speed, two-cycle motor that operates up to speeds of between 5000 and 6000 rpm. A pivoted weight generally coaxially disposed within the head forcibly causes vibrations in response to internal impacts.<br>
Another example Is the portable four cycle backpack pendulous vibrator disclosed in US Patent 5,716,131 to Breeding. The backpack includes a rigid frame mounting a four cycle motor that is connected to the vibrator by a flex-shaft and isolated therefrom by an in-line compensator.<br>
An example of an eccentric vibrator is shown in US Patent 4,057,222. This patent describes an immersion vibrator of the type employed for consolidating poured concrete and employing an unbalanced rotor, characterised by a gerotor type motor, operated by hydraulic pressure, for rotating the rotor.<br>
There are several disadvantages in requiring use of a dedicated concrete vibrator. First, these devices are relatively expensive to manufacture and maintain. Second, if they are not readily available on site when the concrete arrives, work cannot proceed until the vibrator arrives. Third, they add to the quantity of equipment which must be carried from site to site.<br>
Accordingly, there is a long felt need for a device which is convertible to a concrete vibrator or which can be used as a power supply for a concrete<br>
2<br><br>
vibrator, and it would be very desirable to have such a device which is readily available! on building sites.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided an adapter for coupling to a power tool having a motor with about 2000W power, the adapter rfnoluflir^M transmission for coupling the motor of the power tool to a poker, so as to convert the power tool to the power supply for a concrete vibrator.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the transmission includes at least two gear wheels coupleable to a chuck or shaft of the motor of the power tool and, via a flexible shaft, to the poker.<br>
There is also provided a method for making a concrete vibrator, the method iicluding mounting an adapter on a power too! having a motor with about 2CD0W power, and coupling the adapter to a poker, thereby convening the power tool to a concrete vibrator.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an adapter for coupling a poker for vibrating concrete and its flexible shaft to the motor of a conventional professional power tool, so as to create a concrete vibrator, at the building site. In this way, no separate, dedicated concrete vibrator is required, but rather the adapter transforms a conventional power tool to a power supply unit for a concrete vibrator. Thus, the concrete vibrator can be formed using any one of a number of readily available single speed power tools, such as electric angle grinders, electric drills, electric circular saws, and other similar tools having the required power, merely by affixing a flexible shaft and poker to the chuck or shaft of the motor of the power tool. In particular, the adapter includes a special gear, which acts as a transmission to provide the appropriate rotation (rpm), ar.il change of axis, if necessary, for the particular poker utilized,<br>
Referring now to Fig. 1, there is shown an adapter 10, constructed and operative in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, arranged/to/be coupled to a professional power tool (not shown). Adapter 10 includes^ gear 12 arranged to be coupled at one end to the chuck or shaft of the motor of the power tool, and at the other end to a flexible shaft 14 coupled to a poker 16. Poker 16 can be of the eccenter or pendulum type, as desired by the builder.<br>
Preferably, the adapter includes a quick coupling for simple connection to the power tool, without tools. When a quick connector is utilized, the poker can be rapidly and easily removed from the power tool, thereby rendering it available for its conventional usage. Taking advantage of the turning power of the shaft of the electric power tool, the gear 12 develops the rpm and torque necessary to turn the flexible shaft and activate the poker properly. It will be appreciated that the specifications of the particular adapter will change<br>
5<br><br>
according to the rpm of the particular power tool used and the position of the shaft of die tool<br>
Due to the power required to actuate the concrete vibrating poker, the power tools which are useful in the present invention are those having a motor having about 2000W power, plus or minus about 10%,<br>
Referring now to Fig. 2, there is shown the adapter constructed according to one embodiment of the invention coupled to a professional power tool 18, here shown, by way of example only, as an electric angle grinder, h will be appreciated that, by means of the adapter of the present invention, the motor of the professional power tool is transformed into a power supply unit for the pc-ker of the concrete vibrator.<br>
As seen in Figs, 1 and 2, the adapter preferably also includes a stand 20, on which the gear 12 is mounted. Stand 20 permits the adapter and power tool to stand on the floor while the vibrator is held m the concrete by a worker, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Alternatively, a shoulder strap 22 can be coupled to stand 20, as shown in Fig. 4" to permit a worker to carry the adapter and power tool on his back, while holding the flexible shaft and poker in his hand.<br>
With reference to Fig. 5, there is shown an adapter 30 constructed and operative in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention* Adapter 30 includes a quick connector, generally indicated 32 (not illustrated in mechanical detail), for coupling adapter 30 to the shaft 34 of the motor of the power tool As can be seen, adapter 30 includes a first gear wheel 36 arranged for rotating engagement within a second gear wheel 38 which is, in turn, coupled to a connecting pin 40 onto which the flexible shaft and the poker of the vibrator can be mounted.. Bail bearings 42 are provided, where required.<br>
6<br><br>
The gears are preferably of the type Z-45R, M-1,5, and Z-18L, M=L5? or sirnikx, according to the transmission rate necessary to go from the input rpm to the output rpm with the proper torque. Most preferably, the gears are formed of steel, as it is resistant under the forces generated by the vibrator. The typfc of ball bearings suitable for use in the present invention are those of the family denominated 6800 DDW and 6000 DDW.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates an adapter 50 constructed according to an alternative embodiment of the invention, which provides a reduction in the rpm of the flexible shaft relative to the rpm of the motor of the power tool. This is accomplished by providing a gear wheel 52 adjacent the gear wheel 54 coupled to the motor shaft 56. Gear wheel 52 is coupled to a connecting pin 58 which will be connected to the flexible shaft of the vibrator, and thus to the poker. ID the illustrated embodiment, the connecting pin is male. Alternatively, a female connector can be provided on the adapter for fitting to a male connector on the flexible shaft.<br>
Fig, 7 illustrates an adapter 60 constructed according to an alternative embodiment of the invention, which provides a further reduction in the rpm of the flexible shaft relative to the rpm of the motor of the power tool. This is accomplished by providing an additional gear wheel 64 between the gear wheel 62 coupled to the motor shaft 66, and the gear wheel 68 coupled to the connecting pin 70 for connection to the flexible shaft and the poker of the vibrator.<br>
It is a particular feature of the present invention that virtually any desired ipm of the vibrator shaft can be achieved, by changing the combination of gear wheels in the adapter. Alternatively, a differential gear* or any other transmission system which can be adapted to convert the motor of a<br>
7<br><br>
professional power tool to a power supply for driving a concrete vibrator, can be utilbed.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Fig. S. Fig. 8 shows an adapter 72, which transforms the turning power on the Y axis from the power too! into turning power on the X axis, at the required rpm for the vibrator. Adapter 72 includes a quick connector 74 for coupling adapter 72 to the shaft 16 of the motor of the power tool. Adapter 72 also includes a &amp;&amp;§&amp;£ ' gear 78 coupled to the shaft 80 of the power tool, and a pinion gear 82 couplsc to the cot meeting pin 84 for the flexible shaft and poker of the vibrator,<br>
