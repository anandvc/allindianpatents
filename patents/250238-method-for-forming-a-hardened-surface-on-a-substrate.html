This application claims benefit of U.S. Non-provisional application<br>
10/841,873 filed on May 6, 2004, entitled METHOD FOR FORMING A HARDENED<br>
SURFACE ON A SUBSTRATE which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
CONTRACTUAL ORIGIN OF THE INVENTION<br>
The United States Government has certain rights in this invention pursuant to<br>
Contract No. DE-AC07-99ID13727, and Contract No. DE-AC07-05ID14517 between the<br>
United States Department of Energy and Battelle Energy Alliance, LLC.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention pertains to metallic coatings and methods of forrmng metallic coatings.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Steel is a metallic alloy which can have exceptional strength characteristics, and<br>
which is accordingly commonly utilized in structures where strength is required or<br>
advantageous. Steel can be utilized, for example, in the skeletal supports of building<br>
structures, tools, engine components, and protective shielding of modern armaments.<br>
The composition of steel varies depending on the application of the alloy. For<br>
purposes of interpreting this disclosure and the claims that follow, "steel" is defined as any<br>
iron-based alloy in which no other single element (besides iron) is present in excess of 30<br>
weight percent, and for which the iron content amounts to at least 55 weight percent, and<br>
carbon is limited to a maximum of 2 weight percent. In addition to iron, steel alloys can<br>
incorporate, for example, manganese, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, and/or vanadium.<br>
Steel alloys can also incorporate carbon, silicon, phosphorus and/or sulfur. However,<br>
phosphorus, carbon, sulfur and silicon can be detrimental to overall steel quality if present in<br>
quantities greater than a few percent. Accordingly, steel typically contains small amounts of<br>
phosphorus, carbon, sulfur and silicon.<br>
Steel comprises regular arrangements of atoms, with the periodic stacking<br>
arrangements forming 3-dimensional lattices which define the internal structure of the steel.<br>
The internal structure (sometimes called "microstructure") of conventional steel alloys is<br>
always metallic and polycrystalline (consisting of many crystalline grains).<br>
Steel is typically formed by cooling a molten alloy. The rate of cooling will determine<br>
whether the alloy cools to form an internal structure that predominately comprises crystalline<br>
grains, or, in rare cases, a structure which is predominately amorphous (a so-called metallic<br>
glass). Generally, it is found that if the cooling proceeds slowly (i.e., at a rate less than about<br>
104 K/s), large grain sizes occur, while if the cooling proceeds rapidly (i.e., at a rate greater<br>
than or equal to about 104 K/s) macrocrystalline internal grain structures are formed, or, in<br>
specific rare cases amorphous metallic glasses are formed. The particular composition of the<br>
molten alloy generally determines whether the alloy solidifies to form microcrystalline grain<br>
structures or an amorphous glass when the alloy is cooled rapidly. Also, it is noted that<br>
particular alloy compositions (not iron based) have recently been discovered which can lead<br>
to microscopic grain formation, or metallic glass formation, at relatively low cooling rates<br>
(cooling rates on the order of 10 K/s).<br>
Both microcrystalline grain internal structures and metallic glass internal structures<br>
can have properties which are desirable in particular applications for steel. In some<br>
applications, the amorphous character of metallic glass can provide desired properties. For<br>
instance, some glasses can have exceptionally high strength and hardness. In other<br>
applications, the particular properties of microcrystalline grain structures are preferred.<br>
Frequently, if the properties of a grain structure are preferred, such properties will be<br>
improved by decreasing the grain size. For instance, desired properties of microcrystalline<br>
grains (i.e., grains having a size on the order of 10"6 meters) can frequently be improved by<br>
reducing the grain size to that of nanocrystalline grains (i.e., grains having a size on the order<br>
of 10-9 meters). It is generally more problematic to form grains of nanocrystalline grain size<br>
than it is to form grains of microcrystalline grain size. Accordingly, it is desirable to develop<br>
improved methods for forming nanocrystalline grain size steel materials. Further, as it is<br>
frequently desired to have metallic glass structures, it is desirable to develop methods of<br>
forming metallic glasses.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect, the invention encompasses a method of forming a metallic coating. A<br>

least a portion of the metallic glass can be converted into a crystalline material having a<br>
nanocrystalline grain size.<br>
In another aspect, the invention encompasses metallic coatings comprising metallic<br>
glass.<br>
In yet another aspect, the invention encompasses metallic coatings comprising<br>
crystalline metallic material, with at least some of the crystalline metallic material having a<br>
nanocrystalline grain size.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of forming a hardened surface on a<br>
substrate, comprising providing a substrate; and forming a molten alloy and cooling the alloy to<br>
form a metallic glass coating on the substrate, the forming comprising forming a successive<br>
buildup of metallic glass layers, the metallic glass coating having a hardness of 9.2 GPa or more,<br>
and comprising one or more materials selected from the group consisting of <br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The invention encompasses methodology for forming steel materials having<br>
nanocrystalline scale composite microstructures, methods of utilizing such steel materials,<br>
and also encompasses the steel material compositions. A process encompassed by the present<br>
invention is described generally with reference to the block diagram of Fig. I. At an initial<br>
step (A) a molten alloy is formed. Such alloy comprises a steel composition. An exemplary<br>
alloy comprises at least 50% Fe and at least one element selected from the group consisting of<br>
Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Al, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb,<br>
and Lu; and at least one element selected from the group consisting of B, C, N, O, P and S.<br>
In particular aspects of the present invention, the alloy will be a magnetic alloy with ultrafine<br>
crystal grains having a composition represented by the formula: Fe(100-x-y)M(x)B(y) (atomic<br>
percent) wherein M represents at least one element selected from Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Mo, Ta,<br>
Cr, W and Mn, wherein 15^x^4, wherein 25^y^2, and wherein 35^(x+y)27. Also, at least<br>
50% of the alloy structure is preferably occupied by crystal grains having an average size of<br>
1000A or less, with the crystal grains being based on a bcc structure. The alloy can further<br>
contain X (Si, Ge, P, Ga, etc.) and/or T (Au, Co, Ni, etc.).<br>
Alloys of the present invention preferably comprise fewer than 11 elements, and can<br>
more preferably comprise fewer than seven elements. Additionally, the alloys can comprise<br>
fewer than five elements. An advantage in having fewer elements in the compositions is that<br>
it can be easier to reproduce a material if fewer components are utilized in forming the<br>
material. Generally, alloys of the present invention have from four to six elements in their<br>
compositions. Among such elements are iron; chromium, which can be included for<br>
corrosion resistance; boron and/or phosphorus which can be included to generate a particular<br>
glass transition temperature; and one or both of molybdenum and tungsten which can be<br>
included for hardness.<br>
Exemplary alloys which can be utilized in methodology of the present invention are:<br><br>
The alloy of step (A) can be formed by, for example, melting a composition under an<br>
argon atmosphere.<br>
At step (B) of Fig. 1, the alloy is cooled to form a metallic glass. Such cooling<br>
typically comprises a rate of at least about 104 K/s, with the rate varying depending on the<br>
particular composition of the molten alloy. The cooling can be accomplished by a number of<br>
different processes, including, for example, melt-spinning, gas atomization, centrifugal<br>
atomization, water atomization and splat quenching. The powder can be consolidated by, for<br>
example, hipping, hot pressing, hot extrusion, powder rolling, powder forging and dynamic<br>
compaction. In an exemplary method, the cooling of step (B) is accomplished by centrifugal<br>
atomization. Preferably, the melt stream leaves a centrifugal cup and is hit by high pressure<br>
helium gas to facilitate fast cooling (greater than 105 K/s.) The helium gas can be collected,<br>
purified and reused. The speed of the rotating centrifugal cup is preferably about 40,000<br>
RPM, and such speed can be adjusted to produce a fine powder with about a 25 micrometer<br>
mean size.<br>
Referring to step (C) of Fig. 1, the metallic glass of step (B) is devitrified to form a<br>
crystalline steel material having a nanocrystalline grain size. Such devitrification can be<br>
accomplished by heating the metallic glass to a temperature of from about 600°C to less than<br>
the melting temperature of the alloy. Such heating enables a solid state phase change wherein<br>
the amorphous phase of the metallic glass is converted to one or more crystalline solid<br>
phases. The solid state devitrification of the amorphous precursor from step (B) enables<br>
uniform nucleation to occur throughout the metallic glass to form nanocrystalline grains<br>
within the glass. The metal matrix microstructure formed via the devitrification can comprise<br>
a steel matrix (iron with dissolved interstitials), with an intimate mixture of ceramic<br>
precipitates (transition metal carbides, borides, silicides, etc.). The nanocrystalline scale<br>
metal matrix composite grain structure can enable a combination of mechanical properties<br>
which are improved compared to the properties which would exist with larger grain sizes or<br>
with the metallic glass. Such improved mechanical properties can include, for example, high<br>
strength, and high hardness coupled with significant ductility.<br>
The particular temperature employed for devitrifying the metal glass can be varied<br>
depending on the particular alloy utilized in the glass, and a particular time of application.<br>
Post treatment of the devitrified metallic material from step (C) can include a surface<br>
treatment utilized to transform only the surface of the material to a metallic glass. Exemplary<br>
surface treatment techniques are high and low pressure plasma spraying, high velocity<br>
oxyfuel spraying, and spray forming. The plasma spraying can be accomplished with a<br>
plasma spray system. The post treatment can offer improvements in, for example, corrosion<br>
resistance and lowering the coefficient of friction of a steel material. Accordingly, it can be<br>
advantageous to treat at least the surface of a crystalline steel material to convert such surface<br>
to a metallic glass. It is noted that a metallic glass coating can also offer advantages over<br>
existing coatings such as, for example, chrome, nickel and tin plating in that the metallic<br>
glass coating can be cheaper and can give a better metallurgical bond between the surface and<br>
the base metal.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, a specific embodiment application of the present invention is<br>
illustrated. Specifically, Fig. 2 illustrates a metallic barrel 50 being sprayed with a molten<br>
metal material 52. Molten metal material 52 is sprayed from a spraying device 54, and can<br>
comprise, for example, one or more of the above-described exemplary alloys of the present<br>
invention. The molten metal can be formed by melting an alloy composition under an argon<br>
atmosphere and subsequently centrifugally atomizing the alloy composition. As the melt<br>
stream leaves a centrifugal cup, it can be hit by a high pressure helium gas to form a fine<br>
powder of solidified metallic alloy material with such fine powder having about a 25<br>
micrometer mean size. The fine powder can be fed into a plasma (high or low pressure)<br>
system wherein it is converted to a liquid spray which is sprayed on the inside and outside of<br>
metallic drum 50. In particular applications, drum 50 comprises a steel drum, such as, for<br>
example, a 55 gallon steel drum. It is noted that the powder may or may not be fully melted<br>
upon exposure to the plasma, and will be deposited into and onto the surface of barrel 50 as a<br>
continuous coating. In either event, the metallic material 52 sprayed onto and within drum 50<br>
cools rapidly to form a metallic glass. Drum 50 can be subsequently heat-treated at a<br>
temperature of equal to or greater than 600°C to devitrify the metallic glass.<br>
The metallic structure formed over and within barrel 50 from material 52 can have<br>
greater corrosion resistance than stainless steel. Drum 50 be utilized, for example, for storing<br>
corrosive and otherwise dangerous materials, such as, for example, spent nuclear fuel. If a<br>
surface of material 52 is coated with a metallic glass, the anti-corrosive properties and low<br>
coefficient of friction properties associated with metallic glass can be obtained.<br>
Figs. 3-6 illustrate another embodiment application of the present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, a metallic substrate 100 is provided. Such substrate can comprise, for<br>
example, one or more of the above-described exemplary alloys of the present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, a metallic melt 102 is sprayed onto substrate 100 utilizing a<br>
sprayer 104. Melt 102 can comprise, for example, a molten alloy comprising one or more of<br><br>
powder material heated to a sufficient temperature to bond with the metal of layer 100.<br>
Material 102 deposits on substrate 100 to form a layer 106. Material 102 also heats an<br>
exposed surface of material 100 to form a heat-treated portion 108 of material 100. If<br>
material 100 comprises a metallic glass, heat-treated portion 108 can comprise a devitrified<br>
material. Specifically, if layer 106 is formed at a temperature which heats a surface of layer<br>
100 to greater than 600°C, such heating can devitrify a portion of material 100 exposed to<br>
such temperatures. In particular applications, temperatures greater than 600oC can permeate<br>
entirely through substrate 100 to heat-treat an entire thickness of material 100. Spray nozzle<br>
104 is preferably resistant to the temperature and composition of material 102.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5, substrate 100 is illustrated after layer 106 has been formed across<br>
an entire surface of substrate 100. Heat-treated portion 108 also extends across an entire<br>
surface of substrate 100. In particular embodiments, layer 106 can be formed as a metallic<br>
glass.<br>
Referring to Fig. 6, subsequent treatments of the type illustrated in Fig. 4 can be<br>
utilized to form multiple heat-treated layers 120 and an exposed outer surface layer 124. Note<br>
that one of the lower heat-treated layers 120 is previous layer 106. The subsequent formation<br>
of another metallic glass layer over layer 106 has heat-treated the entire layer 106. In<br>
particular embodiments wherein layer 106 comprises a metallic glass, such heat treatment can<br>
devitrify layer 106. Accordingly, heat treated layers 120 can comprise devitrified metal<br>
layers. In alternative methods of the present invention, each of the layers 106 and 120 can be<br>
deposited as metallic glass and can remain in the metallic glass form during deposition of<br>
remaining layers 120. Then, if desired, some or all of the deposited layers can be heat-treated<br>
to at least partially devitrify the coating defined by layers 106 and 120.<br>
Outermost layer 124 may or may not be heat-treated, and can comprise a metallic<br>
glass. Accordingly, the method of the present invention has enabled an exterior coating to be<br>
formed over layer 100, with said exterior coating comprising devitrified metal layers 120 and<br>
an outermost surface of metallic glass 124.<br>
The methodology described with reference to Figs. 3-6 can have application for a<br>
number of uses, including military uses. Specifically, armor can be formed out of a material<br>
100. If the armor becomes punctured or cracked, the methodology of Figs. 3-6 can be utilized<br>
to repair the armor and effectively build a metallic shell over the weakened areas of the<br>
armor. Spraying device 104 can be adapted to be utilizable in battlefield situations.<br>
In addition to the utilizations described above for materials of the present invention,<br>
the materials can also be utilized as powders for surface finishing (i.e., mechanical blasting)<br>
and surface treatments such as, for example, shot peening.<br>
The invention can be considered a method for forming a new class of steel called<br>
devitrified nanocomposite (DNC) steel, with DNC steel being defined as having a primarily<br>
nanoscale (less than 100 nanometer) microstructure grain size developed by processing the<br>
steel through a solid-solid transformation (specifically, glass devitrification). Alloys are<br>
developed having low cooling rates (less than 106 K/s) for metallic glass formation, and<br>
accordingly the alloy compositions form metallic glasses when rapidly solidified by a chill<br>
surface (such as, for example, melt-spinning, splat quenching, etc.) or atomization (gas,<br>
water, centrifugal, etc.) methods. The glass is utilized as a precursor stage, and the alloy<br>
subsequently processed through a glass devitrification transformation upon heating above a<br>
crystallization temperature of the alloy. Due to uniform nucleation in the glass coupled with<br>
a high nucleation frequency, there is little time for grain growth processes, and nanoscale<br>
nanocomposite microstructures (i.e., grains) result. The nanocomposite microstructures can<br>
lead to materials having significant increases in hardness and strength over conventional steel<br>
alloys.<br>
Initial studies described herein show that DNC steel formed in accordance with<br>
methodology of the present invention has exceptional hardness and wear resistance, and can<br>
be used potentially for any application which involves sliding, rolling, or rotation.<br>
Additionally, initial studies have shown that the unlubricated DNC steel surface has<br>
exceptionally low coefficients of friction (in the range of lubricated steels) which can be a<br>
beneficial property in reducing wear resistance, frictional energy losses, and heating between<br>
moving surfaces. This can allow the use of DNC steel in unlubricated applications, and can<br>
also be useful as a fail-safe mechanism allowing additional time before failure in some<br>
applications, such as gasoline or diesel engines, where lubrication is unexpectedly lost. The<br>
high wear resistance of DNC steel, coupled with low friction, can allow extension of the<br>
lifetime of parts formed from DNC steel relative to parts formed from conventional steel<br>
alloys. Such can enable large savings in both operating energy and cost associated with part<br>
replacement, repair, maintenance and down-time. Exemplary applications for utilization of<br>
DNC steels of the present invention include bearings, gun barrel surfaces, bearing journals,<br>
hydraulic cylinder connecting rods, crankshafts, pistons, cylinder liners, gears, camshafts,<br>
universal joints, valves, gun breach boxes, missile launcher tubes, and tank gear boxes.<br>
Unlike conventional steel alloys which rely on manipulation of solid state eutectoid<br>
transformation (Yso1=asol+Fe3C), DNC steel utilizes a different approach, and specifically<br>
utilizes processing through a solid/solid state glass devitrification transformation. DNC steel<br>
alloys have been developed which have exceptionally low cooling rates (103 K/s to 105 K/s)<br>
for metallic glass formation. This can allow the production of metallic glass structures during<br>
rapid solidification via chill surface or atomization methods.<br>
Examples of DNC steel melt-spun ribbon and gas atomized powder are shown in Figs.<br>
7 and 8, respectively. Metallic glass structures are produced by both of these rapid<br>
solidification processing methods. The glass precursor can be devitrified into a nanoscale<br>
composite microstructure by heating above the crystallization temperature.<br>
A differential thermal analysis scan for as-spun DNC steel is shown in Fig. 9. The<br>
glass crystallization temperature typically varies from 750K to 900K with enthalpies of<br>
transformation from -75 Jig to -200 J/g, and melting temperatures from 1.375K to 1.500K for<br>
alloys encompassed by the present invention (as described in the charts of Figs. 20-23).<br>
Because there is uniform nucleation and extremely high nucleation frequency during<br>
crystallization of alloys of the present invention, there can be little time for grain growth<br>
before impingement between neighboring grains and accordingly nanoscale nanocomposite<br>
microstrucrures are formed. The individual phase sizes can vary from 1 to 75 nanometers,<br>
which is finer than conventional steels produced by conventional casting or even when<br>
rapidly solidified. When the microstructure is. reduced to the nanoscale level, a high<br>
percentage of the atoms of the material (about 30%) can be associated with grain boundaries,<br>
and an extremely high density of two-dimensional defect interfaces (such as phase in grain<br>
boundaries) reside in the microstructure. The microstructure of a devitrified ribbon showing<br>
the nanoscale nanocomposite microstructure is shown in Fig. 10. The nanostructure results in<br>
the development of extreme strength and hardness, which are significantly higher than found<br>
in conventional steel or other metallic based alloys.<br>
The hardness of glass and devitrified DNC steel has been measured using both<br>
nanoindentor and Vickers microhardness testing, and excellent agreement is found between<br>
the two methods. Specialized nanoindentor testing using a Berkovich indentor was<br>
performed on the as-atomized and heat-treated sieved (10-20 micrometer and 75-100<br>
micrometer) gas atomized particles from a Fe63Cr8Mo2B17C5Si1Al4 alloy as a function of depth<br>
into the particle. The elastic modulus was found to be as high as 300 GPa, which is<br>
approximately 50% higher than a conventional steel (which commonly exhibits elastic<br>
i<br>
moduli from 200 GPa to 220 GPa). This means that bonding strength is increased, which can<br>
be of beneficial result since it allows close tolerances to be maintained during application of<br>
high elastic loads, and can have additional benefits concerning wear resistance. The hardness<br>
was also found to be extremely high at greater than 15 GPa, which is harder than<br>
conventional metallic materials. Examples of various compositions which can be utilized in<br>
methodology of the present invention for forming hard materials are shown in Table 1. In<br>
referring to Table, the various compositions are given reference names (specifically, they are<br>
referred to as alloys DARX) to simplify reference to the compositions herein. Table 2<br>
contrasts hardness of various materials with the alloy DAR1.<br>
From the hardness determined for DAR1, the yield strengths for the DNC steel can be<br>
estimated to be 725 ksi, which is significantly higher than conventional (150 ksi) or ultra high<br>
strength (220 ksi) steels. If the plasticity is fully developed, the yield strength can be<br>
estimated to be 1/3 of the hardness. This gives the DNC steel a specific strength of 0.65 x<br>
106M which makes this material an alternate for Al in lightweight applications. Little<br>
hardness difference was found between the large and small heated powders indicating that<br>
similar microstructures were obtained independent of powder size. It is noted that the<br>
hardness tests described herein were relative to a material DAR1 (Fe63Cr8Mo2B17C5Si1Al4)<br>
which is not a preferred material of the present invention. Rather, preferred materials of the<br>
present invention would have fewer elements, and are listed as DAR2 through DAR 19 in<br>
Table 1.<br>
A preferred material of the present invention (specifically DAR20) is compared with<br>
DAR1 in Fig. 11, Specifically, Vickers microhardness measurements with a 100 gram load<br>
were performed on 75 micrometer to 100 micrometer powder size fractions for as-atomized<br>
alloys, and also as a function of heat treatment temperature. The tested alloys exhibited<br>
extreme hardness from 10.1 GPa to 16.0 GPa Vickers hardness. Examples of diamond<br>
pyramid indentations on a melt-spun ribbon and gas-atomized powder particle are shown in<br>
Fig. 12. While the Rockwell C is the most common hardness measurement for steels, it<br>
cannot be used in the present case due to the extreme hardness of the alloys of the present<br>
invention (which are off of the Rockwell C scale). Note that a Vickers Hardness number of<br>
9.2 GPa corresponds to a Rockwell C of 68. Referring again to Fig. 11, it is noted that little<br>
hardness change occurs in the as-atomized state of alloys of the present invention after<br>
subsequent heat treating. This can be significant, as it means that optimum microstructures<br>
are obtained directly during solidification and the optimum structures are stable to high<br>
temperatures (at least to 850°C, as shown in Fig. 11).<br>
DNC steels contain multiple combinations of elements which result in relatively low<br>
melting points (typically around 1,150°C) and low melt viscosities, This can make the DNC<br>
steels easy to process from the liquid state, and ideal feedstock materials for forming coatings<br>
by thermal deposition methods. Initial low plasma spraying tests have been performed<br>
utilizing the atomized 20 to 50 micrometer Fe63Cr8MO2B17C5Si1Al4 steel powder as feed stock.<br>
Several uniform DNC steel coatings of 0.1 inch in thickness were deposited onto 4"x4" 301<br>
stainless steel plates (shown in Fig. 13). While typical thermally deposited coatings are only<br>
25 micrometers to 100 micrometers thick, much thicker coatings (up to 2,500 micrometers)<br>
were sprayed to illustrate an extreme case (in other words, thinner coatings are easier to spray,<br>
but thicker coatings were sprayed to illustrate operability of a method of the present<br>
invention).<br>
Metallographic examinations of the coatings indicate that the percent porosity of the<br>
initial coatings was at least 3%. X-ray diffraction scans were performed both on the substrate<br>
side and free surface side of the coatings, and show that an amorphous structure was obtained<br>
through the cross-sectioning of the coatings (specifically, Fig. 14 shows an x-ray structure of<br>
a free surface side of the coating, and Fig. 15 shows an x-ray structure of the substrate side of<br>
the coating). Differential scanning calorimetry methods verified the formation of the glass<br>
structure in the coating which exhibited a high crystallization enthalpy (-110 J/g). This result<br>
is surprising due to the supreme thickness of the coating which resulted from successive<br>
build-up of continuous layers of deposited powder, and the fact that the substrate was not<br>
cooled. Thus, DNC steel coatings represent a class of materials called bulk glasses. Bulk<br>
glasses are normally very difficult to produce, but readily form in the DNC alloys by thermal<br>
processing methods.<br>
The as-sprayed DNC metallic glass coatings can be devitrified into a nanoscale<br>
structure by heating above the crystallization temperature. However, due to the unique<br>
properties of the metallic glasses, the glass state itself may be useful as a coating. Metallic<br>
glasses are essentially super-cooled liquids, and have structures which are very homogeneous.<br>
Typically there are few defects, and there can be a complete absence of grains and phase<br>
boundaries. Hardness testing was performed on both the as-sprayed (amorphous) and heat-<br>
treated (800°C for one hour) nanocrystalline coatings. The Vickers hardness of these coatings<br>
was found to be 10.9 GPa and 13.8 GPa for the as-sprayed and heat-treated coatings,<br>
respectively. It is noted that while the amorphous sample is not as hard as the crystalline<br>
sample, it is still harder than the hardest tool steel (about 9.3 GPa), or tungsten carbon (WC)<br>
cemented carbide cutting tool (about 10.0 GPa).<br>
Tribology testing experiments were done on the as-sprayed and heat-treated (100°C<br>
for one hour) plasma sprayed coatings using ASTM G99 Pin-on-Disk tests. The "pin" was a<br>
one-half inch diameter Si3N4 ball which was rotated at a test speed of 97 RPM, with a test<br>
radius of 10.4 mm and with no lubrication. During the test, the coefficients of friction were<br>
measured (shown in Fig. 16). The coefficient of static friction for the steel substrate in both"<br>
the as-sprayed and heat-treated condition was 0.22, which represents a low value. For<br>
example, the following coefficients of sliding friction were obtained for specimens sliding<br>
over a normalized steel (0.13% C, 3.42% Ni): aluminum (0.6), cartridge brass (0.5), copper<br>
(0.8), cast iron (0.4), and normalized steel (on itself 0.8). For conventional steels, the<br>
coefficients of static friction for unlubricated surfaces generally vary from 0.8 to 1.0, while<br>
lubricated steels have much lower values (typically from 0.1 to 0.25). Thus, the unlubricated<br>
DNC steels have coefficients of static friction in the range of lubricated steel surfaces.<br>
Accordingly, utilization of DNC steel coatings in place of conventional steel may allow the<br>
elimination of lubrication in some applications. Note that the coefficient of sliding friction of<br>
the steel substrate could not be measured due to Si3N4 deposition from the pin.<br>
The profile of the wear surface of the steel showed that the steel experienced no wear<br>
during the test (Fig. 17). Instead of the expected wear groove, a raised hill of deposited Si3N4<br>
was found on the steel surface. Examination of the silicon nitride ball showed that it<br>
experienced a large ball scar as a result of wear. This was surprising due to the hardness of<br>
the ball material (15.4 GPa), which is used specifically for these type of tests due to its<br>
excessive hardness and wear resistance. Note that Si3N4 is currently the hardest pin material<br>
available to perform this ASTM test.<br>
The Fe63Cr8Mo2B17C5Si1Al4 steel utilized in generating the data described above is an<br>
exemplary DNC steel. However, it suffers from a disadvantage of having numerous elements<br>
included therein, which can make it difficult to produce uniform batches of the material.<br>
Accordingly, improved DNC alloys have been developed. Such improved alloys are listed in<br>
Table 1 as DAR2 through DAR19. The alloys have been designed to form metallic glasses at<br>
low cooling rates, and are further designed to reduce the number of elements utilized in the<br>
alloys.<br>
Ingots of the 19 alloys listed in Table 1 were melt-spun at 15 m/s with the following<br>
melt-spinning parameters: chamber 1/3 atmosphere helium, ejection pressure 150 Torr,<br>
ejection temperature 1,400oC, crucible up to wheel distance 6 mm, and crucible orifice<br>
diameter 0.81 mm to 0.84 mm.<br>
All of the tested alloys were melt-spun with few problems. Interestingly, many of the<br>
preferred alloys (i.e., DAR2 through DAR19) formed uniform continuous ribbons up to 10<br>
meters in length. This may be due to increased glass forming ability and increased ductility<br>
of the glass that is produced relative to the less preferred alloy DAR1. Qualitative inspections<br>
of the ribbons by bending the ribbons back and forth until fracture indicated that all of the<br>
alloys DAR2 through DAR19 have higher ductility than the DAR1 alloy. In fact, some of the<br>
alloys DAR2 through DAR 19 in ribbon form cannot be broken by bending, and had to be<br>
cut. An example of a melt-spun ribbon which exhibits high ductility is shown in Fig. 18, and<br>
was formed from the material DAR18 (Fe0.8Cr0.2)81B17W2.<br>
Differential thermal analysis (DTA) and differential thermal calorimetry (DSC)<br>
studies were done on each melt-spun ribbon sample in ultra-high purity argon from 30°C to<br>
1,375°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min. A typical DTA scan showing DAR14<br>
((Fe0 8Cr02)75BnSi4Al4) compared with DAR1 (Fe63Cr8Mo2BnC5Si1Al4) is illustrated in Fig.<br>
19. From the DTA/DSC studies, the glass to crystalline transformation temperatures,<br>
enthalpy of transformation, transformation rate, and melting temperatures could be<br>
determined. The results of these studies are shown in Figs. 20-23. As shown, all of the alloys<br>
but one (specifically, DAR5 ((Fe0.8Mo0.2)83B17), formed a metallic glass structure when melt-<br>
spun at reduced cooling rate. Thus, the alloys are expected to form metallic glass powders<br>
when atomized.<br>
Vickers hardness testing using a 100 gram load was done on the cross-sections of the<br>
melt-spun ribbons of each alloy in the as-spun and heat-treated (700°C for one hour and<br>
800°C for one hour) conditions. For each sample (60 samples total), 10 Vickers hardness<br>
tests on five ribbons were done in order to get a reportable average value. In general, only<br>
small variations were found to occur in hardness when the same sample was tested.<br>
Summaries of the completed Vickers hardness measurements are shown in Table 4.<br>
As indicated by the tables and Figures provided herein, materials of the present<br>
invention having less than 11 elements, and more preferably less than seven elements, can<br>
form glass compositions. It is not a trivial task to form materials having such limited number<br>
of elements, which are also capable of forming metallic glasses. However, such has been<br>
accomplished in the present invention. The present invention also has developed improved<br>
ductility and toughness of DNC steel alloys, while maintaining or possibly even improving<br>
hardness. The DNC alloys are believed to be useful for numerous services, including military<br>
applications, due to their strength and wear resistance. The alloys can also be resistant to<br>
electrochemical attack (i.e., corrosion). In general, as the scale of a microstructure decreases,<br>
the electrochemical resistance of a particular material is expected to increase. Thus,<br>
nanocrystalline scale DNC microstructures are expected to have good corrosion resistance.<br>
Further, metallic glass DNC structures can have improved corrosion resistance due to high<br>
homogeneity (short range order on a 2 nanometer length scale) and the absence of two-<br>
dimensional defects (such as grain or phase boundaries). Specifically, a uniform single-phase<br>
structure can make it difficult for sites to initiate for anodic attack and electron transfer since<br>
there will not be distinct anodic and cathodic sites. While the metallic glass or nanostructure<br>
of a certain composition can have a higher relative resistance to electrochemical attack than<br>
the same material in bulk form, the material's nobility will be dependent on both the structure<br>
and the composition. For instance, a high level of chromium can improve resistance to<br>
electrochemical attack.<br>
Among the advantages of the alloys described herein is that such alloys can have a<br>
relatively simple composition (i.e., from four to six elements in the composition). Also, the<br>
alloys can contain a relatively high percentage of transition metals (from 90% to 97%) which<br>
can lead to improved industrial properties of the materials.<br>
A distinction of the materials of the, present invention relative to conventional hard<br>
materials is that the materials of the present invention can comprise no carbon. In<br>
conventional steels, hardness is typically tied directly to carbon content in a martensite, In<br>
contrast, the extreme hardness of DNC steels arises from development of nanoscale<br>
nanocomposite microstructures, rather than from martensitic transformations. An advantage<br>
of carbon-free compositions is that the extremely hard alloys can be developed to still be<br>
reasonably ductile, which is typically not possible in conventional steel alloys (i.e.,<br>
untempered martensite and transition metal carbides are typically hard, and also brittle).<br>
Group VI transition metals (Cr, Mo, and W) can be particularly potent additions to<br>
DNC steels. Chromium, consistent with data on conventional steel alloys, is expected to also<br>
provide excellent corrosion resistance. Molybdenum and tungsten can be exceptionally<br>
potent additions to promote hardness in DNC steels. Tungsten can also be potent at<br>
increasing hardness while retaining or increasing ductility.<br>
Because of its hardness and high strength (greater than 725 ksi), DNC steel can be<br>
difficult to process into bulk parts starting from powder and using conventional powder<br>
metallurgical consolidation processes. However, DNC steel can be easy to process from the •<br>
liquid state. Alternatively, powder of DNC steel can be fed through a conventional plasma<br>
gun and sprayed as a coating onto metal substrates with good adhesion and with absence of<br>
cracking. Other methods for forming a coating of DNC steel include axial feed plasma<br>
spray, conventional plasma spray, high velocity oxy-fuel spray, and a detonation gun.<br>
When DNC steel is sprayed onto metallic substrates it can readily form a metallic<br>
glass structure. If consecutive layers are continuously sprayed onto a bulk substrate<br>
(thickness greater than 0.1 inches) metallic glasses can be formed. This may be the most<br>
inexpensive and easiest way to form bulk metallic glass coatings or even bulk glass<br>
monolithic parts.<br>
DNC steels can be rapidly solidified into an amorphous glass precursor and then the<br>
rapidly solidified powders can be consolidated into a useful form. Accordingly, the cost of<br>
technology of the present invention can involve three items: the alloy cost, the powder<br>
production cost, and the consolidation cost. All three items can be estimated. To produce<br>
rapidly solidified powder, centrifugal atomization may be the best method, and even at<br>
relatively low production rates. If it is feasible to produce DNC steel powder by water<br>
atomization, processing cost to produce the powder could drop to a few pennies per pound.<br>
The powder consolidation costs will vary depending on the specific application and the<br>
thickness of the coating. Coatings from 5 micrometers to 2,500 micrometers in thickness can<br>
be readily deposited using conventional commercially available thermal deposition methods,<br>
such as plasma spraying or high velocity oxy-fuel spraying. The DNC steel's cost can<br>
compare favorably to other hard materials such as, for example, diamond and cubic BN.<br>
DNC steel coating may also be a direct competing technology to replace tungsten carbide<br>
cemented carbide coatings, since the DNC steel exhibits higher hardness and greater tensile<br>
ductility.<br>
Although the invention is described herein for coating steel alloy compositions of the<br>
present invention on metallic substrates, it is to be understood that the alloys of the present<br>
invention can also be coated on non-metallic substrates, such as, for example, ceramics, to<br>
provide a hard and/or lubricating surface over the non-metallic substrates.<br>
