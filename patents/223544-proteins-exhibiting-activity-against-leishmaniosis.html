DESCRIPTION<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present specification relates to an application for an Invention Patent, regarding a chimeric gene formed of the DNA sequences that encode the antigenic determinants of four proteins of L. infantum, and to proteins encoded by said chimeric gene, useful for the prevention or treatment of leishmaniosis, in particular canine leishmaniosis. The obvious purpose of this lies in using the gene sequence or the protein obtained from the chimeric gene for providing pharmaceutical compositions for preventing or treating leishmaniosis, in particular canine leishmaniosis, that can be present in the body of a patient, for instance as a vaccine or a monoclonal antibody preparation. This patient does not have to be a dog but can also be a human being who suffers from diseases that involve immuno-depression. To achieve this, a chimeric gene will be produced that encodes a protein called PQ consisting of a chimeric product originating from an "in vitro" synthesis of a chimeric gene constructed "ad hoc", which contains five of the antigenic determinants of four different proteins. The product is configured as highly sensitive and specific for -for instance - generating a protective immune responds against canine Leishmaniosis, or for preparing antibodies against canine Leishmaniosis. FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is of utility within the industry dedicated to the manufacture of pharmaceutical products in<br><br>
general.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The parasitic protozoa of the Leishmania genus are the aetiological agents that cause Leishmaniosis, a range of diseases that have a world-wide distribution and that are characterised in that they give rise to a wide variety of clinical symptoms.<br>
The main forms of Leishmaniosis are zoonotic in nature and humans are considered as secondary hosts.<br>
The species denoted L. Infantum, widely distributed throughout many Mediterranean areas is the cause of visceral Leishmaniosis (LV) in humans and dogs.<br>
In fact, dogs infected with L. infantum are the main animal reserve of this parasite, particularly during the long incubation period before the clinical symptoms can be observed.<br>
The epidemiological data indicate that there is a direct correlation between the prevalence of canine Leishmaniosis and the transmission of the parasite to humans. For this reason, it is crucial to detect the disease or infection early on in campaigns undertaken to control the spread of the disease.<br>
The parasite is transmitted to the host vertebrate as a flagellate promastigote, by means of a bite of a fly of the family "Phlebotominae", and the parasite enter the cells of the mononuclear phages where they differentiate and reproduce as amastigotes, within the phago-lisosomal structure.<br>
The infected cells gather in certain tissues, mainly spleen, liver and lymph nodes. It is estimated that around 15 million people are infected with Leishmaniosis, and every year in the world 500,000 new clinical cases appear in the world, mainly in the underdeveloped and developing world.<br>
In the south-western countries of Europe, Visceral Leishmaniosis (VL), is a zoonotic disease caused by the L.<br><br>
Infantum species, as was mentioned earlier. Recent data derived from epidemiological studies indicate that there is an alarming incidence of this infection.<br>
In Italy the reported data for incidence of VL ranges from 14.4% to 37% according to the region.<br>
In Portugal, more particularly in the area around Lisbon, seropositive rates of 8.4% have been found and in the region of the French Maritime Alps different centres of prevalence have been found that vary between 3.2% and 17.1%.<br>
In Spain, the prevalence of Leishmaniosis depends on the zone being studied. In Catalonia an average incidence rate of 9.3% has been observed although in some hot-spots a prevalence of infected dogs of up to 18% has been found.<br>
On the Island of Mallorca, the incidence rate is 14%, and other rates that have been found are: 2.4% in Murcia, 8.8% in Granada, from 10 to 15% in Salamanca, 5.25% in the province of Madrid, and 14% in Caceres.<br>
Although the number of cases of VL in humans caused by L. infantum can be considered relatively low, the high percentage of patients with immuno-depression that become infected by Leishmania could be related to the high level of this illness in dogs.<br>
In fact, in the South of Europe, 50% of adults that are infected by Leishmaniosis are also patients infected by the HIV virus. On the other hand, according to these data of Leishmania-HIV co-infection, it has been estimated that the level of infection (by parasites) can be one or two orders of magnitude higher than this figure due to the existence of a large number of undetected infections.<br>
A common characteristic of the different types of Leishmania infection is that it induces a 'strong humoral response in the host. Therefore, diagnostic methods based on serological techniques are currently the most widely used.<br>
It has been described that these antibodies are<br><br>
detected even during the asymptomatic phase of the disease in natural and experimental infections.<br>
The sensitivity and specificity of these methods depends on the type, source and purity of the antigen used. In immunological processes that are currently commercialised, complete promastigotes and preparations more or less prepared from these are used as a source of antigen. This method normally leads to cross-reactions with serum from patients suffering from leprosy, tuberculosis, African tripanosomiasis, Chagas disease, malaria and other parasitosis.<br>
The sensitivity and specificity of the serologic methods depend on the type, source and purity of the employed antigen. During the last years a great number of Leishmania antigens have been characterised, some of them can be considered as proteins specific to the parasite.<br>
Among these proteins specific to the parasite, the surface protease GP63, the surface glycoprotein gp46 and the lipophosphoglicane associated KMP-11 protein deserve a mention.<br>
An additional group of Leishmania antigens are formed of evolutionarily conserved proteins, such as kinesine, thermally induced proteins, actin and tubulin.<br>
As part of a strategy to develop a specific serological diagnostic system for Leishmaniosis canine, a laboratory based project has been undertaken to identify the antigens of L. infantum, by means of a immuno¬detection search of an expression library for genes of L. infantum using dog serum with active visceral Leishmaniosis.<br>
It has been observed that most of the antigens isolated by this method belong to the family of proteins conserved during the course of evolution. The identification of the B epitopes of these antigens indicate, however, that in all cases the antigenic determinants were localised in regions that were not well<br><br>
conserved.<br>
In particular, the acidic ribosomal proteins LiP2a and LiP2b are recognised by more than 80% of the VL sera.<br>
It has been confirmed that these proteins contain disease specific antigenic determinants, and that the recombinant proteins LiP2a and LiP2b, from which a fragment had been removed, could be used as a specific instrument able to distinguish between VL and Chages disease.<br>
It has also been shown that the PO ribosomal protein of L. infantum, very highly conserved on the evolutionary scale, is recognised by a high percentage of VL dog sera. Furthermore, the antigenic determinants are found exclusively on the C-terminus of the protein, that is to ' say, in the region that has been poorly conserved during the course of evolution.<br>
It has been observed that in 78% of the VL dog sera, antibodies against H2A protein are also present, and it has been confirmed that despite the sequence identity in all the H2A proteins among eukaryotic organisms, the humoral response to this protein in VL sera is particularly provoked by determinants specific to the Leishmania protein H2A.<br>
The antigenic determinants recognised by the VL dog sera are found at both termini of the H2A protein.<br>
The obvious solution to the problem currently encountered in this art would be to have an invention that would allow the assembly of a synthetic chimeric gene that contained the DNA regions encoding the antigenic determinants specific to the proteins LiP2a, LiP2b, LiPO, and H2A, with a view to constructing a protein rich in antigenic determinants.<br>
However, as far as the applicant is aware, there is currently no invention that contains the characteristics described as ideal, with a view to reaching the desired aim. This aim is the construction of a protein rich in<br><br>
antigenic determinants, arising from the assembly of a chimeric synthetic gene, that contains the DNA regions encoding  the  antigenic  determinants  specific  to  the aforementioned proteins. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>

canine sera, divided into three groups. The first group contain animals with real infection by L. infantum.- The second group includes serum obtained from dogs with various clinical symptoms but that are not infected with Leishmania, and a third group is made up of fifteen control sera from healthy dogs. This figure demonstrates the value of the invention for carrying out serological diagnosis of VL.<br>
PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The chimeric gene formed from the DNA sequences that encode the antigenic determinants of four proteins of L. infantum, useful for the serological diagnosis of canine Leishmaniosis and the protein obtained that is being proposed are constituted from the construction of intermediate products. In a first instance, cloning of epitopes specific to the antigens of L. infantum is carried out, which is configured on the basis of earlier studies on the antigenic properties of four protein antigens of L. infantum (LiP2a, PiPO, LiP2b, LiH2a) , which allow the existence of B epitopes to be defined for these proteins, and which are specifically recognised by the canine sera of VL.<br>
With a view to improving the antigenic specificity of these antigens with respect to the proteins of L. infantum, the specific antigenic determinants are cloned from these proteins. After deleting certain regions of these proteins these can be recognised by sera from animals that are carriers of VL and other different diseases.<br>
By using the specific oligonucleotides and amplification by PCR of regions specific to the genes LiP2a, LiP2b, PO and H2A, several clones are constructed that express the recombinant proteins rLiPO-Ct-Q, rLiP2a-Q, rLiP2b-Q, rLiH2A-Ct-Q and rLiH2A-Nt-Q, just has been detailed in the description of the invention relating to<br><br>
the methodology, where the cloning details are described. The recombinant proteins used are the following:■<br>
-	rLiPO-Ct-Q, which corresponds to the 30 C-terminal residues of the ribosomal protein LiPO.<br>
-	rLiP2a-Q and rLiP2b-Q, that are derived from the ribosomal proteins LiP2a and LiP2b respectively.<br>
Two sub-regions of the histone H2A, that correspond to the 4 6 N-terminus residues (xLiH2A-Nt-Q) , and to the 67 C-terminus residues (residues (xLiH2A-Ct-Q) .<br>
Each one of the recombinant proteins fused to the maltose binding protein (MBP) is expressed in E. Coli, as represented in Figure number 1A, and they were purified by affinity chromatography on a amylose column B. After the process of purification electrophoresis was carried out on the recombinant proteins (lanes 1 to 5).<br>
With the aim of analysing whether the recombinant proteins were recognised by VL canine sera, a Western blot was incubated, containing the recombinant proteins in a mixture of three VL canine sera. Given that all these proteins are recognised by the sera, it is concluded that the antigenic determinants present in the parent proteins are maintained in the recombinant proteins (C).<br>
The antigenic properties of the recombinant proteins are compared with the antigenic determinants of the parent antigens by means of a FAST ELISA, testing against a collection of 26 VL canine sera, just as is shown in the section of Figure number ID, and the fact that the sera showed a similar reactivity value, both against the selected antigenic regions and the corresponding complete proteins, demonstrates that no alteration to the antigenic epitope has occurred during the cloning procedure.<br>
In regard to the construction of the final product, more exactly of the chimeric gene that encodes a polypeptide that contains all the selected antigenic determinants, it should be pointed out that the cloning strategy is indicated following Figure number 2 section A.<br><br>
The intermediate products generated during the process are shown.<br>
A clone that expresses the proteins  rLiPO-Ct-Q<br>
(pPQI) is used as the initial vector, and the fragments of<br>
DNA that encode the proteins rLiPO-Ct-Q, rLiP2a-Q, rLiP2b-<br>
Q,  rLiH2A-Ct-Q and rLiH2A-Nt-Q are added sequentially<br>
using appropriate restriction sites.<br>
After each cloning step, the correct orientation of each one of the inserts is deduced from the size of the expression products, and finally the complete nucleotide sequence of the final clone pPQV is determined and the amino acid sequence deduced from the sequence represented in Figure number 3 .<br>
The polypeptide generated has a molecular mass of 38 kD, with an isoelectric point of 7.37, including spacer sequences encoding proline, underlined in Figure number 3. The aim of doing this is to efficiently separate the antigenic domains and avoid possible tertiary conformations that could interfere with the stability and antigenicity of the final product.<br>
The expression and recovery of each of the intermediate products is shown in figure number 4, boxes A and B. As was expected, after each addition, the size of the expression product in the vector pMAL gradually increases until reaching a molecular weight of 80 kDa, observing a certain degree of rupture during purification.<br>
The chimeric gene was also cloned in the plasmid pQE, a vector that allows the expression of proteins with a fragment of 6 histidines at the extreme N-terminus. The resulting clone and the recombinant proteins are denominated pPQ and PQ respectively.<br>
The level of expression of the protein in bacteria transformed with the pPQ plasmid and the purified proteins are shown in Figure number 4, referred to in particular with a D, with the protein PQ, purified by affinity chromatography in denaturising conditions is more stable<br><br>
that the recombinant protein pPQV represented in Figure number 4, in box D lane 2.<br>
In order to evaluate the final product a series of materials were used, and obviously some techniques, as is i    described below.<br>
Sera of VL obtained from dogs of different origins are used. The animals are evaluated clinically and analytically in the pertinent laboratory, generally in a Department of Parasitology, and all the positive sera are assayed for indirect immuno-fluoresence (IIF) .<br>
The presence of amastigotes of the parasites of these animals is confirmed by direct observation of the popliteal and pleescapular lymph nodes, and a second group of 33 sera of VL originating from other regions, were given a positive diagnosis in the ELISA against total protein extracts of the parasite and/or by IIF.<br>
The sera of dogs affected by different diseases that were not VL are obtained from different origins. Within this group sera from the following infections are found:<br>
Mesocestoides spp.<br>
Dyphylidium caninum<br>
Uncinaria stenocephala<br>
Toxocara canis<br>
Dipetalonema dranunculoides<br>
Demodex canis<br>
Babesia canis<br>
Ehrlichia cannis<br>
Ricketsia ricketsiae.<br>
The rest of the sera were obtained from dogs that exhibited various clinical symptoms that were not related to any infective process, and the serum controls were obtained from fifteen carefully controlled healthy animals.<br>
Purification of the recombinant proteins expressed by the clones pMAl-c2 is carried out by affinity chromatography on amylose columns, and the purification of<br><br>
the recombinant protein expressed by the clone pPQ was performed on Ni-NTA resin columns in denaturising conditions (Qiagen).<br>
For analysing the proteins, electrophoresis on 10% polyacrimide gels in the presence of SDS was carried out under standard conditions. Immunological analysis of the proteins separated by electrophoresis was carried out on nitrocellulose membranes to which the proteins had been transferred. The transferred proteins were blocked with dried 5% skimmed milk in a PBS buffer with 0.5% Tween 20.<br>
The filters were sequentially brought into contact with primary and secondary anti-serum in blocking solutions and an itranuno-conjugate labelled with peroxidase was used as second antibody, visualising the specific binding by means of an ECL system. Figure 4E shows a Western blot of protein PQ.<br>
The Fast-ELISA was used instead of the classic ELISA, and the sensitisation of the antigen was carried out for 12 hours at room temperature.<br>
The plates were sensitised with 100 pi of antigen whose concentration in all cases was 2 pg/ml.<br>
After sensitising the wells the plates were incubated for 1 hour with blocking solution (0.5% powdered skimmed milk dissolved in PBS - 0.5% Tween 20 and the sera were diluted three hundred fold in blocking solution).<br>
The wells were incubated with serum for 2 hours at room temperature, and after exposure to the antibody the wells were washed with PBS-Tween 20.<br>
Antibodies labelled with peroxidase were used as second antibodies at a dilution of 1:2000 and the colour of the reaction was developed using the substrate ortho-phenylenediamine, measuring the absorption at 450 nm.<br>
In regard to evaluation of the final product, it should be pointed out that the antigenic properties were determined by means of the pertinent study of the reactivity of the VL canine sera against the chimeric<br><br>
protein and against each one of the intermediate products in a "Western blot" assay. All the intermediate products maintained their antigenicity as well as did the final pPQV product, throughout the whole of the cloning process (Fig. 4C).<br>
It should also be pointed out that the recombinant protein expressed by the pPQ plasmid was recognised by the VL sera. With a view to analysing with greater precision the antigenic properties of the chimeric protein and the intermediate products, an analysis of the reactivity of a wide variety of VL canine sera was performed by means of a fast-ELISA against the recombinant proteins, as is shown in the section F of Figure number 4. It can be highlighted that the sensitivity of the different intermediate products of cloning increases after each addition step. It should also be pointed out that the protein pQI is recognised by most of the VL sera and the protein PQI I equally by most of the sera. This proportion is greater for the protein PQI 11 and the proteins PQIV, PQV and PQ are recognised by practically all the sera.<br>
According to what has been discussed above, the percentage of recognition shown by the sera was similar both in the case of assaying the chimeric proteins PQV and PQ, and of assaying a mixture of recombinant proteins rLiPO-Ct-Q, rLiP2a, rLiP2b and rLiH2A. It was seen that the antigenic properties of each one of the 5 selected antigenic regions are present in the PQ expression product, and therefore this product can be used for diagnosis instead of a mixture of the antigens expressed individually.<br>
With a view to determining whether the chimeric protein can be used for canine VL serum diagnosis, and according to the pertinent analysis of a wide variety of canine sera against this protein, bearing in mind that according to the clinical characteristics of the animals, the canine sera have been classified into three groups.  A<br><br>
first group consisted of sera from dogs with a real L. infantum infection. A second group was composed of sera of dogs that had various clinical symptoms without being infected with Leishmania, including dogs infected with parasites different to Leishmania, and that could exhibit clinical symptoms that could be confused with those observed during Leishmaniosis.<br>
The third group was made up of control sera, originated from healthy dogs.<br>
In figure number 5 the average values of reactivity are shown for each group of sera, the reactivity of the VL sera reaching an average reactivity value of 0.8 (S.D. = 0.4) .<br>
Within this group the reactivity of 12 sera was positive but less than 0.35, while the reactivity of 10 sera reaches values of between 0.35 and 0.5. It was observed that the reactivity of 23 sera varies between 0.5 and 1.0, with 14 sera showing a reactivity greater than 1.0.<br>
The average absorption value of the sera of the second group, that is to say, the group infected with parasites different to Leishmania parasites, is 0.2 (S.D. = 0.05) and the reactivity of the control sera, that is to say, the third group, is 0.1 (S.D. = 0.003). Only two sera from group 2 showed reactivity between 0.35 and 0.40.<br>
The data presented above indicate that the chimeric protein PQ in the FAST ELISA has a sensitivity of 80% for the VL diagnosis, if the cut-off value is defined as the average reactivity value of the sera of group 2 plus three S.D.'s (that is to say 0.35).<br>
The sensitivity of the assayed group reaches 93%, if the cut-off value is defined by the reactivity values of the control group. The protein Q has a specificity of 96% for VL diagnosis, when the cut-off value is defined by the aforementioned sera of group 2. 100% specificity in the assay was reached when the reactivity values of healthy<br><br>
dogs were considered.<br>
The process to be used is the following:<br>
1. - The microtitre plates are covered with antibodies by incubated 100 pi of a solution that contains 1 ug/ml of antigen dissolved in a buffer PBS - 0.5% Tween 20 - 5% skimmed milk (Buffer A).<br>
The incubation is performed for 12 hours at room temperature, and then the plates are washed three times with the same buffer containing no antigen. The dry antigenated plates could be maintained at room temperature.<br>
2.- A first incubation of the wells was carried out with the serum of animal at a dilution of 1/200 in buffer A.  The incubation lasts for 1 hour.<br>
3.- The wells are washed with buffer A, as described in point 1, three times with a wash flask.<br>
4.- They are incubated with a second antibody (IgG labelled with peroxide) diluted 1:2000 in buffer A, carrying out the incubation for 1 hour.<br>
5.- The wells are washed once again with buffer A three times, as was indicated in the third section, that is to say with a wash flask.<br>
6. - The reactivity is revealed using the substrate ortho-phenylenediamine and the absorption measured at 450 nm.<br>

Vaccine against Leiahmania BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania are responsible for causing leishmaniasis, a symptomatically complex disease which essentially affects men and animals in tropical and subtropical regions. It is estimated that the number of new cases of human visceral leishmaniasis can reach the number of 500,000, there being a minimum of several tens of millions of persons affected. Additionally<br><br>
the number of cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis can be of the order of 2.000.000 per year (Modabber. , 1990) . Although the persons at risk of contracting the different types of leishmaniasis can be estimated in about 350 million, the number of persons with real infection can be much higher, due to the fact that there are no clear estimations of the real cases of asymptomatic infections and because of the existence of cryptic infections. In fact, leishmaniasis can be considered within the global context as an infection/ disease of endemic nature, situated between the 4th and 5th place in the ranking of parasitic diseases with world-wide repercussion.<br>
Three main forms of leishmaniasis can be distinguished: cutaneous, mucocutaneous and visceral, the characteristics of which mostly depend upon the localisation of the parasite, the species to which it belongs and the clinical manifestations it produces. The species distributed along Asia and certain regions in the Mediterranean area bring about the presence of the cutaneous form, with localised ulceration which, in many cases, heal spontaneously. These manifestations are caused by L. major and L. tropica.. L. aethiopica (Mediterranean, Asia, Africa) also induces the cutaneous form of leishmaniasis, although its manifestation is more diffuse. In America, the species L. mexicana produces the cutaneous form with a generalised localisation that does not usually heal spontaneously. The mucocutaneous form of the disease in humans is caused by L. Jbrasiliensis and is characterised by the presence of cutaneous lesions in oronasal and pharyngeal regions, bringing about the destruction of the mucosae. In America, Europe, Africa and Asia, the most frequent form of leishmaniasis is the visceral form, caused by L. chagasi, L. donovani and L. infantum. This form of leishmaniasis is characterised by clinical symptoms associated to fever, anaemia and an intense hepato/splenomegalia, which is lethal if it is not<br><br>
treated suitably at the right time. In the advanced form of the disease, the host is incapable of developing an effective immune response. All of these forms of leishmaniasis are also detected in canids and some rodents which, in fact, constitute the main reservoirs of the parasite. The health problem generated by L. infantum in the Mediterranean basin is serious because there is a high incidence of the infection / disease in dogs, and the vector insect is very extended. It is calculated that between 7% and 2 0% of all canids are infected by Leishmania, reaching 30%, in some areas of Spain where it is endemic. This fact constitutes a serious veterinary problem which additionally increases the risk of contagion, fundamentally by immunodepressed persons. In Europe, there are some 11 million dogs at risk of infection by Leishmania.<br>
L. infantum, like the rest of the species in the genus has a dimorphic biological cycle. The intermediate hosts are insects of the Psychodidae family, genus PMebotomus. In the Mediterranean area of Europe, it has been demonstrated that the species P. arias and P. perniciosus are the main vectors, although the vectors P. papatosi, P. longicuspis and P. sergenti are also present. When the parasite is ingested by the vector together with the blood of a vertebrate host, it places itself in the gut in an extracellular form, it transforms into a promastigote and it divides. The infective forms migrate towards the pharynx and the proboscis, from where they will be inoculated into a new vertebrate host. The promastigotes are characterised in that they have a flagellum and an elongated shape of some 15 to 2 0 fim in length, with a rounded posterior end and a sharp anterior end. The nucleus is situated in central position and the kinetoplast at the anterior end. In culture media, the parasites exhibit a certain degree of morphological variability. After the inoculation of the promastigotes in<br><br>
the skin of the vertebrate host, the establishment, or not, of the infection depends essentially upon- two factors: the existence of a suitable cell population -macrophages- and other cells of the phagocytic mononuclear system, and the ability of the parasite to survive and multiply itself in the interior of these cells.<br>
The first step in the penetration of Leishmania into macrophages is the approximation and adherence to the plasma membrane of the target cell. In vitro studies seem to indicate that there is no direct chemotactic attraction of the promastigotes over the macrophages. Within the environment of tissues, free promastigotes activate complement by the alternative pathway, bringing about the formation of a concentration gradient of fraction C5a, which attracts macrophages and other inflammatory cells towards the site of inoculation. Once the promastigote is within a parasitophorous vacuole, the lysosomes fuse to it forming a phagolysosome. In infections caused by other micro-organisms, the phagolysosome is the organelle responsible for the lysis and elimination by means of several mechanisms such as the production of toxic oxygen radicals, by an oxidative metabolic process, the action of hydrolytic lysosomal enzymes, cationic proteins and low pH. The survival of the parasite in the phagolysosome is a function of its ability to resist and avoid said mechanisms.<br>
The existence of an immune response against parasitisation by Leishmania which is both humoral and cellular was discovered from the first moments in which the disease was studied, and has been revised in numerous occasions. The type of humoral response depends upon the form of leishmaniasis. In the cutaneous form, the humoral response is very weak, whereas in the visceral type a high antibody response is observed. In the cutaneous affections there is a remarkable cell-mediated response, detectable both in    vivo   by means of delayed type hypersensitivity<br><br>
tests (DTH) , as well as in vitro by means of lymphoblastic transformation tests and macrophage migration inhibition tests. In these cases the titre of serum antibodies is normally low and directly related to the seriousness of the process. Once the amastigotes are within the macrophages, the resolution of the infection depends essentially upon the cell-mediated immune mechanisms. The cellular response is determined by the joint action of macrophages, B cells, several sub-populations of T-cells, and the different lymphokines secreted by all of them. The parasitised macrophage processes the Leishmania antigens and expresses them on its surface by a process mediated by the class II Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC-II) . Additionally, the macrophage secretes IL-1, which acts as a second activating signal for the T-lymphocyte. In humans, visceral leishmaniasis or kala-azar is characterised by a weakened or absent cellular response, detectable both by the absence of delayed hypersensitivity (DTH) and by cell proliferation methods. Absence of proliferation of T-cells is detected even in the presence of mitogens such as concanavelin A or phytohaemagglutinin and inhibition in the production of IL-2 by stimulated T-cells.<br>
In mice, the population of T-lymphocytes (CD4 phenotype) is heterogeneous and can be divided into at least two sub-populations according to the lymphokines they produce. These cells are essential in the development of protective immunity against cutaneous leishmaniasis (sub-population Th-1) and are at the same time involved in the suppression of the protective immune response (sub-population Th-2) , T cells induced in resistant mice C57BL/6 or cured BALB/c mice are predominantly of the Th-1 type, whereas the cells in uncured BALB/c mice are of the Th-2 type. In general, the lymphokines secreted by these cells favour the development of the cell line which produces  them  and has  an  antagonic  effect  on  the<br><br>
development of the other sub-population. Thus, IL-4 and IL-10 produced by Th-2 cells contribute to the progression of the infection, favouring the development of this line. Additionally, they can act directly on the macrophage, not permitting its activation. However, in mice susceptible of infection by Leishmania, deficient in the gene which encodes IL-4, contradictory results have been obtained. In some cases it has been observed that the absence of this cytokine redirects the response and increases the resistance to the infection whereas in others no differences are observed in the level of infection of the mice. In genetically resistant mice it has been observed that the absence of expression of the genes of IFN-y or its receptor, CD40 or the ligand of CD40, increases the susceptibility to the infection. The interaction of CD40 and its ligand is necessary for the production of the cytokine IFN-y necessary to direct the response towards Th-l. Mice with a resistant genetic base, which develop a Th-1 type response, become susceptible if they are deficient in the expression of IL-12., developing a Th-2 type response. Recent data suggests that the production of IL-12 is important to direct the response towards Th-1, and that the absence of IL-4 can avoid the Th-2 response.<br>
There are a large number of Leishmania proteins which have an antigenic character essentially characterised by "Western Blot" methods. In the serum of patients and dogs infected by Leishmania it has been possible to detect the presence of antibodies against membrane proteins such as gp63, gp 46, PSA and KPM-11. Additionally several antigens of cytoplasmatic intracellular localisation have been characterised such as: Hsp70; Hsp83; LIP2a, LIP2b, LILIPO, H2A, H3 and a protein related to kinesin, K39 of L. chagasi. The reactivity of the antibodies, which recognise conserved proteins present in the serum of dogs infected by L. infantum  is directed towards the least conserved areas of<br><br>
these proteins. Some of the membrane proteins are very antigenic in natural infections. In all the case-s of natural infection there is a great restriction in the humoral response against the proteins because the antibodies developed during the infective process recognise very restricted areas of the same. The levels of IgG normally correspond to the intensity of the infection reflect the degree and the duration of antigenic stimulation determined by the parasitic load. A Leishmania antigen homologous to the type C kinase receptors (LACK) has recently been described which produces an early response of the Th-2 type. In mice transgenic for the LACK antigen and with a genetic background susceptible to the infection, the induction of tolerance to this antigen protects against the infection by Leishmania major. The anti-Leishmania antibodies can destroy the promastigotes in vitro in the presence of complement, promote phagocytosis and induce the adherence of several particles to the surface of promastigotes and amastigotes.<br>
The pathologic reaction seems to go in parallel with the density of parasitised macrophages. In visceral leishmaniasis the macrophages generally distribute themselves in a diffuse manner throughout the different organic tissues. The type of inflammation is is constituted by an important cellular infiltrate with a predominance of lymphocytes and plamatic cells together with hyperplasia of phagocytic cells. The inflammation brings about alterations in the physiology of the affected organs producing serious systemic alterations. In some occasions local granulomatous inflammation occurs, with appearance of granulomae and microgranulomae in the different organs. These granulomae are constituted by macrophages and histiocytes (affected by parasites or not) surrounded by plasmatic cells and lymphocytes and, in some cases, by fibroblasts. This inflammatory process is accompanied by an organic reaction with the appearance of<br><br>
characteristic lesions in the affected organs. Some authors have found deposits of amyloid substance in virtually the totality of the organs. Some authors have formulated the hypothesis that the damages produced by the disease are not directly attributable to the aethiologic agent but to the organic reaction triggered.<br>
Vaccine against Leishxnania<br>
The intense immunity which follows the recovery from cutaneous leishmaniasis has given a great impulse to the development of prophylactic vaccines against this disease. This immunity is derived from the induction of a T response which has associated to it the production of inflammatory cytokines which activate macrophages and destroy the parasites. The immunological memory in the cases of infection is probably maintained by the persistent presence of the parasite in the host in a process known as concomitant immunity.<br>
The first studies regarding vaccination against Leishxnania in the decade of the 40's used live parasites as immunogens. These studies led to the production of vaccines which produced significant protection against subsequent re-infection. However, the knowledge of the possibility that live organisms could produce real infections led to such vaccination programmes not to take place for very long and, on the contrary, interest focused upon vaccines based upon dead parasites. These studies provided the first evidence on the possibility of producing effective vaccines by inoculation of parasites.<br>
The clinical trials which used immunisation with dead Leishmania promastigotes also began in the decade of the 40's. These vaccines yielded remarkable successes as a certain degree of protection was observed, which could oscillate between 0 and 82% depending on the population. These vaccines had a smaller effect than live parasite vaccines. The isolation of avirulent clones of L.   major<br><br>
which protect mice against infection has also demonstrated that an attenuated vaccine is possible. However, the ignorance of the mutations which lead to the loss of virulence and the risk of production of virulent revertants make this type of vaccination currently-unacceptable.<br>
Recently there has been an important progress towards the identification of molecularly defined candidate vaccines, such as gp63 , gp46/M2 , the surface antigen related to the latter antigen known as PSA-2 and the proteins dp72 and gp70-2, the LACK protein and Kmpll. Specifically, the T epitopes present in protein gp63 have been identified, resulting in that only some of them are capable of inducing a T response, both of Th-1 as of Th-2. These antigens induce significant protection in model animals when they are administered with adjuvants. Protein PSA-2 of Leishmania is capable of protecting against infection by L. major by inducing a Th-1 response. To evaluate the mechanism of protection of this protein as a vaccine against Leishmania in humans, its ability to induce T-cell proliferation was studied, in patients which had suffered leishmaniasis and had recovered from it. It was observed that the protein is capable of bringing about a strong proliferation of the T-cells of these individuals, but not of controls with no prior history of infection. The response was of the Th-1 type, as was demonstrated by the cytokine induction pattern.<br>
Sub-unit vaccines have focused strongly on protein antigens because they are easy to identify, isolate and clone. However, it is necessary to take into account that not all potential vaccine molecules have to be proteins. In fact, lipophosphoglycan (LPG) plays an essential role in the establishment of infection. Vaccination with LPG can protect against infection with L. major. In spite of the existence of a dogma which states that T-cells do not recognise    non-proteinaceous    antigens,     the    LPG    molecule<br><br>
seems to be presented to T-cells by Langerhans cells of the skin.. Additionally, there is evidence which' has demonstrated that microbial glycolipids and other non-proteinaceous molecules can recognise T-cells when they are presented via the CD-I route. Although there is no clear evidence that protein KMP11 associated to LPG induces a protective response, it has been proved that the proteinaceous fraction associated to LPG is capable of inducing a T response and IFN-y, whereas the LPG fraction without protein is not.<br>
It is normally accepted that sub-unit vaccines although protective, only induce a short term immunity. This problem may not be important in endemic areas, where the individuals can be periodically boosted by cause of natural infections. A major problem in the use of sub-units may arise from the fact that there may not be a response to a single antigen in a genetically diverse population. A cocktail of antigens containing B and T inducers may overcome this drawback. It has recently been published that an extract of membrane proteins of Leishmania infantum, when injected intraperitoneally, is capable of conferring protection against the virulent promastigote forms of this parasite, and that this protection is greater when the proteins are encapsulated in positively charged liposomes. Adjuvanticity and protective immunity elicited by Leishmania donovani antigens encapsulated in positively charged liposomes.<br>
Vaccination with nucleic acids carrying genes which encode Leishmania proteins involves the administration of genetic material of the parasite to the host. This DNA is taken up by the cells and is introduced into the nucleus where it is transcribed and subsequently translated in the cytoplasm. The advantage of this type of vaccination is that it is possible to direct the immune response by means of the MHC-I or the MHC-II route. The antigens produced intracellularly are processed in the cell and the peptides<br><br>
generated are presented on tne ceil surface in association with MHC-I molecules. The consequence would be that these molecules would give rise to the induction of cytotoxic T-cells. The antigens produced in an extracellular environment would be specially taken up by specialised antigen-presenting cells, processed and presented on their surface bound to MHC-II molecules, resulting in the induction and activation of CD4+ cells which secrete cytokines which regulate the effector mechanisms of other cells of the immune system.<br>
The first DNA vector to be administered as a vaccine contained the gp63 gene. Also, the PSA-2 gene has been introduced into a plasmid and it has been observed that it generates a Th-1 response and induction of protection. Vaccination with DNA plasmids which contain Ag-2 induce a Th-1 response and protect against infection with L. major, while Ag-2 in stimulatory immune complexes elicits a combined Th-1 and Th-2 response and does not protect despite the fact that IFN-y is induced. Equally, the gene encoding the LACK protein has been administered subcutaneously to BALB/c mice, in an expression vector which expresses the protein under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, and protection against infection with L. major has been observed. In almost all cases in which DNA has been administered, the route has been intramuscular, although intradermal injection of particulate DNA must also be explored, as it requires a smaller amount of DNA . Other immunisation systems use vectors such as Salmonella, BCG or Vaccinia virus. It is interesting to remark that the inclusion of the gp63 gene in BCG is capable of inducing protection against L. major.<br>
The gene which encodes protein gp63 has also been .introduced into gene delta araC under the control of the rac promotor in an attenuated Salmonella typhimurium. Oral administration of lxlO9 colonies of the transformed bacterium induces a T response within the scope of both<br><br>
Th-1 and of cytotoxic cells against mastocytoma cells which express gp63 . Protein gp63 in the form of gp63-ISCOMs complex induces protection in mice, evidenced by the reduction in inflammation and suppression of lesions. In serum, there are antibodies of the IgG2a type and, additionally, it is possible to observe a Th-1 response by induction of IL-2, IFN-y and IL-10. No DTH response was observed. Salmonella typhi Nramp 1 transformed with gp63 elicits a Th-1 response with induction of IL-2 and IFN-y, and a strong resolution of the lesions is detected. A protein of L. pifanoi known as P-4 induces significant protection against infection by Leishmania. Recent studies in humans with cutaneous leishmaniasis indicate that this protein or the peptides derived from it are capable of making T cells proliferate. There is no induction of IL-4, whereas IFN-y is induced. Aro-A and aro-D mutants of Salmonella typhi transformed with IL-2, IFN-y and TNF-a administered orally may serve as therapeutic systems against infection by L. major. It is interesting to observe that in these patients there is a greater induction of iNOS. The gp&amp;3 gene has also been cloned in Aro-A and Aro-D mutants, and it has been observed that after oral administration, the protein encoded is capable of inducing significant protection against infection with L. major. This same protein is capable of inducing protection when it is administered fused to several promoters in specific varieties (GID105 and GID106) of Salmonella.<br>
An artificial protein denominated Q has recently been described by our group, which is composed of several antigenic fragments from 4 proteins of Leishmania infantum (more specifically, Lip2a, Lip2b, PO and H2A), which, after being used as antigen, has proven to have an important value for the diagnosis of canine leishmaniasis, with a 93% sensitivity and a 100% specificity when compared with sera of control animals which are not<br><br>
infected. Equally, our group has demonstrated that protein hsp70 of Leishmania infantum is an important target of the immune response in infections caused by infection with this parasite.<br>
With the object of exploring the possibility that protein Q may be used to design protection systems against infection by Leishmania infantum, both on its own as in combination with Hsp70, three series of experiments were designed using the hamster as a model. An experiment was designed to check whether immunisation with Protein Q protected the animals against infection on the short term, another to check whether immunisation protected them on the long term and the third was to check this protective effect after immunisation with the two proteins together. It was thereafter observed both from the short term analysis as well as from the long term analysis, that protein Q was capable of eliciting an immune response which reduces the parasitic load both in the Liver and in the Spleen after infection by Leishmania infantum in most of the immunised animals, and that immunisation with the proteins Q+Hsp70 also induced a significant response against both proteins and lead to a significant reduction of the parasitic load in most of the immunised animals.<br>
Example 1: Immunisation with Protein Q<br>
4 animals were immunised with 5 micrograms of protein Q dissolved in 40 microlitres of Freund's adjuvant, and another 4 animals were immunised with the same amount of adjuvant emulsified with 40 microlitres of PBS saline solution without the protein. In the first immunisation, Freund's complete adjuvant was employed combined with the protein, while in the two subsequent immunisations, incomplete Freund's adjuvant was used mixed with the protein in the same proportion of protein/adjuvant. Three intraperitoneal immunisations were carried out at 15 day intervals. Starting from the second<br><br>
week after each immunisation and throughout the whole period of immunisation, blood samples were extracted to measure the humoral response against protein Q in ELISA assays. It was observed that already in the second week after the first immunisation there is a positive IgG response against protein Q, and that this response was high after the second week after infection, and increased with time of immunisation reaching titres of 1/100.000. Equally, it was observed that immune response against protein Q was not modified significantly after the infection with the parasite Fig. 1.<br>
Fifteen days after the third immunisation, the animals were infected with a dose of 105 promastigote parasites, differentiated from infective amastigotes originating from an infected hamster. It had been previously checked that the inoculum was capable of inducing a strong parasitemia together with the disease four months after having administered the parasites, in 100% of the animals infected. Table 1 indicates the level of parasitemia per mg of tissue both in liver and in the spleen of the control and the vaccinated animals. It is possible to observe that in all of the vaccinated animals the parasitic load in the liver decreases with respect to the controls, and that this happens in a very significant manner in 75% of them. When the parasitic load in the spleen is examined, it possible to observe that also in 75% of the animals this load was significantly lower than that of the controls, the RPL reaching 83%-86%. The animal in which the RPL was 20% in the liver, had a 48% one in the spleen.<br><br>

Example 2<br>
In order to verify the effect of vaccination with protein Q on the reduction of the parasitic load on the long term, using another route of inoculation, 4 animals were injected subcutaneously with 5 micrograms of protein Q dissolved in 40 microlitres of PBS and mixed with 40 microlitres of Freund's adjuvant. In the first immunisation, Freund's complete adjuvant was employed, while in the two subsequent ones, incomplete Freund's adjuvant was used as indicated above. Vaccination was administered in three doses spaced at 15 day intervals. Fifteen days after the third immunisation they were administered an inoculum of 105 infective parasites. During all of the immunisation period and throughout the whole of the infection (five months) blood was extracted<br><br>
to determine the Kind or numorai response against protein Q and against the total proteins of the parasite. Figure 2 shows that already after the second week of immunisation, the response against protein Q was positive, as in the previous case, in three of the mice, and that the response against the protein was very high after two weeks of the first immunisation. The response kept on being very high after the remaining immunisations, reaching a titre of 1/75.000 on the week following the third immunisation. In one of the ahimals the response against protein Q was slower in relation to time, although the response reached the level of that in the other animals by the end of the experiment. Consequently, from the data derived both from example 1 and from example 2, it is possible to conclude that the degree of the immune response against the protein, by both routes, intraperitoneal and subcutaneous, is very rapid, although the response via the intraperitoneal route attained higher titres in the same times (1/75.000 versus 1/30.000). Figure 3 indicates the response against protein Q in the control animals. It is possible to observe that reactivity against this protein is detected on the 12-14th week after infection, which is when the first symptoms attributable to a potential leishmaniasis begin to be detected in the animals infected. Table 2 shows the levels of parasitemia in the liver and spleen of the control and vaccinated animals. It can be seen that 50% of the animals were protected at the level of the liver, in the sense that the reduction in the level of parasitemia was very high (87-89%) . One of the animals was not protected, whereas in another of the animals the reduction of the parasitic load was of 22%. On the contrary, the reduction of the parasitic load was of 98-99% in 100% of the animals at the level of the spleen.<br><br>

With the object of testing if protein Q could be used to design protection systems in formulations which contained protein LiHsp70 of Leishmania infantum, an experiment was carried out in Balb/c mice. It was observed that after immunisation, the parasitic load both in the liver as in the spleen was reduced significantly, being in some of the animals, four orders of magnitude lower.<br>
Example 3: Immunisations with protein Q + protein Hsp70 in Freund's Adjuvant.<br>
Each one of 4 hamsters were injected intraperi-toneally with 5 micrograms of protein Q and 5 micrograms of protein LiHsp70 dissolved in 40 microlitres of PBS and emulsified in 40 microlitres of Freund's adjuvant. In the first  immunisation,  Freund's  complete  adjuvant  was<br><br>
employed, while in the two subsequent ones, incomplete Freund's adjuvant was used as indicated above. Vaccination was administered in three doses spaced at 15 day intervals.<br>
Fifteen days after the third immunisation they were administered an inoculum of 10s infective parasites via the intracardiac route and were sacrificed at week. 22. Every two weeks, for all of the immunisation period and throughout the whole of the infection, blood was extracted from them to determine the degree of humoral response against protein Q and against protein LiHsp70.<br>
The relative parasitic load between the mice immunized with the Q protein plus LiHsp70 is shown in Table 3. It was observed that all the animals were highly protected and in some of them, in the spleen, the reduction was close to two-three orders of magnitude.<br>

The   numbers   represent   the   mean  of   the   parasitic   load   of<br>
the  4   animals.<br><br>
Tables 4 and 5 shows that all the animals from Examples 1 and 2 respond immunologically to protein Q, and- that starting from the second week after immunisation the response against protein Q was high and this response increased after the second immunisation (week 4) . Table 6 shows that the response against protein LiHsp70 throughout the whole time of the experiment was also positive, although lower than the response in Example 3 against protein Q.<br>
Tables 4 and 5. Show the immune response in 4 hamsters injected intraperitoneally with 5 micrograms of protein Q (TABLE 4- Example 1, short term) and the immune response in 4 hamsters injected subcutaneously with 5 micrograms of protein Q (TABLE 5 - Example 2, long term).<br><br><br><br><br>
TABLE    6.    Shows    the   immune    response    in   4   hamsters injected     intraperitoneally     with     5     micrograms     of protein    Q   plus    5    micrograms    of    protein   LiHSP    70 (Example 3,   long term).<br><br><br><br>
Example 4: Immunization with protein Q + BC6 in Balb/c mice<br>
Four Balb/c mice were each injected intraperitoneally with 5 micrograms of protein Q and 106 Colony Forming Units (CFU) of BCG (bacille Calmette-<br>
Gu	rin) dissolved in 40 microlitres of PBS. Immunization<br>
was effected in three doses, 15 days apart. 15 days after the third immunization, they were administered an inoculum of infective parasites of 10s BCN150 of L. infantum by the intracardiac route. Every two weeks, throughout the time of immunization and throughout infection, blood samples were taken from them for testing<br><br>
the degree of humoral  response to protein Q.   The  animals were sacrificed at week 8  after  infection.<br>
Table  7   (a and b)   shows  that  the  immunized animals respond positively to protein Q starting  from the  second week and  that  the response  increases progressively until in many  cases  it  reaches values  of  400,000.   Table  8   shows the difference  in parasitic burden between  the  liver and spleen of   the vaccinated and control  animals.<br>

Table 8. Parasitic burden in liver and spleen of Balb/c mice vaccinated with protein Q subcutaneously + 106 of BCG. 8 weeks after infection, the parasitic burden was measured by optical microscopy of tissue impressions by measuring different fields containing 7000 nucleated cells. The parasitic burden is represented as the quantity of parasites per milligram of tissue, having previously calculated that 1 parasite per 1000 nucleated cells is equivalent to an approximate quantity of 210 parasites per milligram of tissue.
