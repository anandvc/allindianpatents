Background of the lnvention-This invention is directed to the use of diaryl acid derivatives and their pharmaceutical compositions as PPAR ligand receptor binders. The PPAR ligand receptor binders of this invention are useful as agonists or antagonists of the PPAR receptor.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) can be subdivided into three subtypes. namely:  PPARa, PPAR5, and PPARy. These are encoded by different genes (Motojima. Cell Structure and Function. 18:267-277, 1993). Moreover, 2 isoforms of PPARy also exist, PPARy! and y2 . These 2 proteins differ in their NHi -terminal-3O amino acids and are the result of alternative promoter usage and differential mRNA splicing (Vidal-Puig, Jimenez, Linan, Lowell. Hamann, Hu, Spiegelman. Flier, Molier. J. Clin. Invest., 97:2553-2561, 1996).<br>
Biological processes modulated by PPAR are those modulated by receptors, or receptor combinations, which are responsive to the PPAR receptor ligands described herein. These processes include, for example, plasma lipid transport and fatty acid catabolism, regulation of insulm sensitivity and blood glucose levels, which are involved in hypoglycemia/hyperinsulinism (resulting from, for example, abnormal pancreatic beta cell function, insulin secreting tumors and /or autoimmune hypoglycemia due to autoantibodies to insulin, the insulin receptor, or autoantibodies that are stimulatory to pancreatic beta cells), macrophage differentiation which lead to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, inflammatory response, carcinogenesis, hyperplasia, adipocyte differentiation.<br>
Obesity is an excessive accumulation of adipose tissue.  Recent work in this area indicates that PPARy plays a central role in the adipocyte gene expression and differentiation.  Excess adipose tissue is associated with the development of serious medical conditions, for example, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), hypertension, coronary artery disease, hypei lipidcmld obesity and certain malignancies. The adipocyte may also influence glucose homeostasis through the production of tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) and other molecules.<br>
Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), or Type II diabetes, is the more common form of diabetes, with 90-95% of hyperglycemic patients experiencing this form of the disease.  In NIDDM there appears to be a reduction in the pancreatic ß-cell mass, several distinct defects in insulin secretion or a decrease in tissue sensitivity to insulin. The symptoms of this form of diabetes include fatigue, frequent urination, thirst, blurred vision, frequent infections and slow healing of sores, diabetic nerve damage and renal disease.<br><br>
Resistance to the metabolic actions of insulin is one of the key features of non-insulin dependent diabetes (NIDDM). Insulin resistance is characterised by impaired uptake and utilization of glucose in insulin-sensitive target organs, for example, adipocvtes and skeletal muscle, and by impaired inhibition of hepatic glucose output. The functional insulin deficiency and the failure of insulin to supress hepatic glucose output results in fasting hyperglycemia. Pancreatic ß-cells compensate for the insulin resistance by secreting increased levels of insulin. However, the ß-cells are unable to maintain this high output of insulin, and, eventually, the glucose-induced insulin secretion falls, leading to the deterioration of glucose homeostasis and to the subsequent development of overt diabetes.<br>
Hyperinsulinemia is also linked to insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridaemia and increased plasma concentration of low density lipoproteins. The association of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia with these metabolic disorders has been termed "Syndrome X" and has been strongly linked to an increased risk of hypertension and coronary artery disease.<br>
Metformin is known in the art to be used in the treatment of diabetes in humans (US Patent No. 3,174,901). Metformin acts primarily to decrease liver glucose production. Troglitazone® is known to work primarily on enhancing the ability of skeletal muscle to respond to insulin and take up glucose. It is known that combination therapy comprising metformin and troglitazone can be used in the treatment of abnormalities associated with diabetes (DDT 3:79-88, 1998).<br>
PPAR y activators, in particular Troglitazone®, have been found to convert cancerous tissue to normal cells in liposarcoma, a tumor of fat (PNAS 96:3951-3956, 1999). Furthermore, it has been suggested that PPAR y activators may be useful in the treatment of breast and colon cancer (P"NAS 95:8806-8811, 1998, Nature Medicine 4:1046-1052, 1998).<br>
Moreover, PPARY activators, for example Troglitazone®, have been implicated in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO). This is a syndrome in women that is characterized by chronic anovulation and hyperandrogenism. Women with this syndrome often have insulin resistance and an increased risk for the development of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. (Dunaif, Scott, Finegood, Quintana, Whitcnmb, J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., 81:3299, 1996.<br>
Furthermore, PPARy activators have recently been discovered to increase the production of progesterone and inhibit steroidogenesis in granulosa cell cultures and therefore may be useful in the treatment of climacteric. (United States Patent 5,814.647 Urban et al. September 29, 1998; B. Lohrke et al. Journal of Edocrinology, 159, 429-39, 1998). Climacteric is defined as the syndrome of endocrine, somatic and psychological changes occurring at the termination of the reproductive period in the female.<br>
Peroxisomes are cellular organelles which play a role in controlling the redox potential and oxidative stress of cells by metabolizing a variety of substrates such as hydrogen peroxide. There are a number of disorders associated with oxidative stress. For example, inflammatory response to tissue injury, pathogenesis of emphysema, ischemia-associated organ injury (shock), doxorubicin-induced<br><br>
cardiac injury, drug-induced hepatotoxicity, atherosclerosis, and hyperoxic king injuries, are each associated with the production of reactive oxygen species and a change in the reductive capacity of the cell. Therefore, it is envisaged that PPARct activators, among other things, regulate the redox potential and oxidative stress in cells, would be effective in the treatment of these disorders (Poynter et al, J. Biol. Chem. 273, 32833-41, 1998).<br>
It has also been discovered that PPARa agonists inhibit NF»cB-mediated transcription thereby modulating various inflammatory responses such as the inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cycIooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme pathways (Pineda-Torra, I. T al, 1999, Curr. Opinion in Lipidology, 10,151-9 ) and thus can be used in the therapeutic intervention of a wide variety of inflammatory diseases and other pathologies (Colville-Nash, et al., Journal of Immunology, 161, 978-84, 1998; Staels et al, Nature, 393, 790-3, 1998).<br>
Peroxisome proliferators activate PPAR , which in turn, acts as a transcription factor, and causes differentiation, cell growth and proliferation of peroxisomes. PPAR activators are also thought to play a role in hyperpiasia and carcinogenesis as well as altering the enzymatic capability of animal cells, such as rodent cells, but these PPAR activators appear to have minimal negative effects in human cells (Green, Biochem. Pharm. 43(3):393, 1992). Activation of PPAR results in the rapid increase of gamma glutamyl transpeptidase and catalase.<br>
PPARa is activated by a number of medium and long-chain fatty acids and is involved in stimulating ß-oxidation of fatty acids in tissues such as liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and brown adipose tissue (Isseman and Green, supra; Beck et al., Proc. R. Soc. Lond. 247:83-87, 1992; Gottlicher et aL, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:4653-4657, 1992). Pharmacological PPARa activators, for example fenofibrate, clofibrate, genfibrozil, and bezafibrate. are also involved in substantial reduction in plasma triglycerides along with moderate reduction in LDL cholesterol, and they are used particularly for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia, hyperlipidemia and obesity. PPARa is also known to be involved in inflammatory disorders. (Schoonjans, K., Current Opionion in Lipidology, 8, 159-66, 1997).<br>
The human nuclear receptor PPAR5 has been cloned from a human osteosarcoma cell cDNA library and is fully described in A. Schmidt et ah. Molecular Endocrinology, 6:1634-1641 (1992). the contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. It should be noted that PPAR5 is also referred to in the literature as PPARß and as NUC1, and each of these names refers to the same receptor. For example, in A. Schmidt et al., Molecular Endocrinology, 6: pp. 1634-1641, 1992, the receptor is referred to as NUC1. PPAR5 is observed in both embryo and adult tissues. This receptor has been reported to be involved in regulating the expression of some fat-specific genes, and plays a role in the adipogenic process (Amri, E. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270, 2367-71, 1995).<br>
Atherosclerotic disease is known to be caused by a number of factors, for example, hypertension, diabetes, low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL), and high levels of low density lipopro.tein (LDL).<br><br>
In addition to risk reduction via effects on plasma lipid concentrations and other risk factors, PPARa agonists exert direct atheroprotective effects (Frick. M. H.,et al. 1997.. Circulation 96:2137-2143, de Faire,etal. 1997. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 11 Suppl 1:257-63:257-263).<br>
It has recently been discovered that PPAR5 agonists are useful in raising HDL levels and therefore useful in treating atherosclerotic diseases. (Leibowitz et ai.; WO/9728149). Atherosclerotic diseases include vascular disease, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral vessel disease. Coronary heart disease includes CHD death, myocardial infarction, and coronary revascularization. Cerebrovascular disease includes ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and transient ischemic attacks.<br>
PPARy subtypes are involved in activating adipocyte differentiation, and are not involved in stimulating peroxisome proliferation in the liver. Activation of PPARy is implicated in adipocyte differentiation through the activation of adipocyte-specific gene expression (Lehmann, Moore, Smith-Oliver, Wilkison, Willson, Kliewer, J. Biol. Chem., 270:12953-12956. 1995). The DNA sequences for the PPARy receptors are described in Elbrecht et al., BBRC 224;43 1-437 (1996). Although peroxisome proliferators, including fibrates and fatty acids, activate the transcriptional activity of PPAR's, only prostaglandin J2 derivatives such as the arachidonic acid metabolite 15-deoxy-deIta12,14 -prostaglandin h_ (15d-PGJ2) have been identified as natural ligands specific for the PPARy subtype, which also binds thiazolidinediones.This prostaglandin activates PPARy-dependent adipogenesis, but activates PPARa only at high concentrations (Forman, Tontonoz. Chen, Brun, Spiegelman, Evans, Cell, 83:803-812, 1995; Kliewer, Lenhard, Wilson, Patel, Morris, Lehman. Cell, 83:813-819, 1995). This is further evidence that the PPAR family subtypes are distinct from one another in their pharmacological response to ligands.<br>
It has been suggested that compounds activating both PPARa and PPARy should be potent hypotriglyceridemic drugs, which could be used in the treatment of dyslipidemia associated with atherosclerosis, non-insuiin dependent diabetes mellitus,Syndrome X,. (Staels, B. et al., Curr. Pharm. Des., 3 (1), 1-14 (1997)) and familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH). Syndrome X is the syndrome characterized by an initial insulin resistant state, generating hyperinsulinaemia, dyslipidaemia and impaired glucose tolerance, which can progress to non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (Type II diabetes), characterized by hyperglycemia. FCH is characterized by hyperchoiesteroiemia and hypertriglyceridemia within the same patient and family.<br>

Those compounds where B and/or E are a chemical bond may also be synthesized by coupling methods analogous to those for compounds where A is a chemical bond as described above.<br>
Furthermore, compounds of the invention may be easily synthesized by solid phase methods, as outlined below, using imputs (XI) - (XVII) as listed in schemes 105 and Table 3 below:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Similarly, other compounds of the invention can be made by a skilled person using the above mentioned methodology.<br>
Compounds useful according to the invention also may be prepared by the application or adaptation of other known methods, by which is meant methods used heretofore or described in the literature, for example those described by R. C. Larock in Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH publishers, 1989.<br>
In the reactions described hereinafter, it may be necessary to protect reactive functional groups, for example, hydroxy, amino, imino, thio or carboxy groups, where these are desired in the final product, so as to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice. For examples, see T.W. Green and P.G.M.Wuts in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry" John Wiley and Sons, 1991; and J. F. W. McOmie in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry" Plenum Press, 1973.<br>
According to a further feature of the present invention, compounds useful according to the invention may be prepared by interconversion of other compounds of the invention.<br>
A compound of the invention that includes a group containing at least one nitrogen ring atom, preferably imine (=N-), may be converted to the corresponding compound wherein at least one nitrogen ring atom of the group is oxidized to an N-oxide, preferably by reacting with a peracid, for example, peracetic acid in acetic acid or m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane, at a temperature from about room temperature to reflux, preferably at elevated temperature.<br>
The products of this invention may be obtained as racemic mixtures of their dextro and levorotatory isomers, since at least one asymmetric carbon atom may be present. When two asymmetric carbon atoms are present, the product may exist as a mixtures of diastereomers based on syn and anti configurations. These diastereomers may be separated by fractional crystallization. Each diastereomer may then be resolved into dextro and levorotatory optical isomers by conventional methods.<br>
It will also be apparent to those skilled in the art that certain compounds of Formula I may exhibit geometrical isomerism. Geometrical isomers include the cis and trans forms of compounds of the invention having an alkenyl moiety. The present invention comprises the individual geometrical isomers and stereoisomers and mixtures thereof.<br>
Such isomers can be separated from their mixtures, by the application or adaptation of known methods, for example chromatographic techniques and recr›•staliization techniques, or they are separately prepared from the appropriate isomers of their intermediates, for example, by the application or adaptation of methods described herein.<br>
Resolution may best be carried out in the intermediate stage where it is convenient to combine the racemic compound with an optically active compound by salt formation, ester formation, or amide formation to form two diasteromeric products.  If an acid is added to an optically active base, then two diastereomeric salts are produced which possesses different properties and different solubilities and can<br><br>
be separated by fractional crystallization. When the salts have been completely separated by repeated crystallization, the base is split off by acid hydrolysis, and enantiomerically purified acids are obtained. Compounds useful according to the invention are useful in the form of the free base or acid or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. All forms are within the scope of the invention.<br>
Where a compound useful according to the invention is substituted with a basic moiety, acid addition salts are formed and are simply a more convenient form for use; in practice, use of the salt form inherently amounts to use of the free base form. The acids which can be used to prepare the acid addition salts include preferably those which produce, when combined with the free base, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, that is, salts whose anions are non-toxic to the patient in pharmaceutical doses of the salts, so that the beneficial pharmaceutical effects of these compounds in the free base are not vitiated by side effects ascribable to the anions. Although pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said basic compounds are preferred, ail acid addition salts are useful as sources of the free base form even if the particular salt, per se, is desired only as an intermediate product as, for example, when the salt is formed only for purposes of purification, and identification, or when it is used as an intermediate in preparing a pharmaceutically acceptable salt by ion exchange procedures. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts useful within the scope of the invention are those derived from the following acids: mineral acids, such as hydrochloric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and sulfamic acid; and organic acids, such as acetic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malonic acid, methanesufonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, cyclohexylsulfamic acid, quinic acid, and the like. The corresponding acid addition salts comprise: hydrohalides, e.g., hydrochloride and hydrobromide, trifluoroacetates, sulfates, phosphates, nitrates, sulfamates, acetates, citrates, lactates, tartarates, malonates, oxalates, salicyiates, propionates, succinates, fumarates, maleates, methylene-bis-ß-hydroxynaphthoates, gentisates, mesylates, isothionates, di-p-toluyltartrates, methanesulfonates, ethanesulfonates, benzenesulfonates, p-toiuenesulfonates, cyclohexylsulfamates and quinates, respectively.<br>
The acid addition salts of the compounds useful according to the invention are prepared by reaction of the free base with the appropriate acid, by the application or adaptation of known methods. For example, the acid addition salts of the compounds of this invention are prepared either by dissolving the free baSe in aqueous or aqueous-alcohol solution or other suitable solvents containing the appropriate acid, and isolating the salt by evaporating the solution, or by reacting the free base and acid in an organic solvent, in which.case the salt separates directly or can be obtained by concentration of the solution.<br>
The compounds useful according to the invention may be regenerated from the acid addition salts by the application or adaptation of known methods. For example, parent compounds useful according to the invention can be regenerated from their acid addition salts by treatment with an alkali, e.g., aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution or aqueous ammonia solution.<br><br>
Where a compound useful according to the invention is substituted with an acidic moiety, base<br>
addition salts may be formed, and are simply a more convenient form for use; in practice, use of the salt<br>
form inherently amounts to use of the free acid form. The bases which can be used to prepare the base<br>
addition salts include preferably those which produce, when combined with the free acid,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, that is, salts whose cations are non-toxic to the animal organism in<br>
pharmaceutical doses of the salts, so that the beneficial pharmaceutical effects on the activity of the<br>
compounds of the present invention in the free acid are not vitiated by side effects ascribable to the<br>
cations. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts useful according to the invention, include for example alkali<br>
and alkaline earth metal salts, including those derived from the following bases: sodium hydride, sodium<br>
hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide, lithium hydroxide,<br>
magnesium hydroxide, zinc hydroxide, ammonia, ethylenediamine, N-methyl-glucarnine, lysine, arginine,<br>
ornithine, choline, N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine. chloroprocaine, diethanolamine, procaine,<br>
diethylamine, N-benzylphenethylamine, piperazine. tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane,<br>
tetramethylammonium hydroxide, and the like.<br>
Metal salts of compounds useful according to the present invention may be obtained by<br>
contacting a hydride, hydroxide, carbonate or similar reactive compound of the chosen metal in an<br>
aqueous or organic solvent with the free acid form of the compound. The aqueous solvent employed may<br>
be water or it may be a mixture of water with an organic solvent, preferably an alcohol such as methanol<br>
or ethanol, a ketone such as acetone, an aliphatic ether such as tetrahydrofuran, or an ester such as ethyl<br>
acetate. Such reactions are normally conducted at ambient temperature but they may, if desired, be<br>
conducted with heating.<br>
Amine salts of compounds useful according to the present invention may be obtained by<br>
contacting an amine in an aqueous or organic solvent with the free acid form of the compound. Suitable<br>
aqueous solvents include water and mixtures of water with alcohols such as methanol or ethanol, ethers<br>
such as tetrahydrofuran, nitriles such as acetonitrile, or ketones such as acetone. Amino acid salts may be<br>
similarly prepared.<br>
The base addition salts of the compounds useful according to the invention can be regenerated<br>
from the salts by the application or adaptation of known methods. For example, parent compounds useful<br>
according to the invention can be regenerated from their base addition salts by treatment with an acid, e.g.<br>
hydrochloric acid.<br>
Salt forms useful according to the invention also include compounds having a quarternarized<br>
3	2<br>
nitrogen. The quarternarized salts are formed by methods such as by alkylation of sp   or sp   hybridized<br>
nitrogen in the compounds.<br>
As will be self-evident to those skilled in the art, some of the compounds useful according to the<br>
invention do not form stable salts. However, acid addition salts are most likely to be formed by<br>
compounds useful according to the invention having a nitrogen-containing heteroaryl group and/or<br><br>
wherein the compounds contain an amino group as a substituent. Preferable acid addition salts of the compounds useful according to the invention are those wherein there is not an acid labile group.<br>
As well as being useful in themselves as active compounds, the salts of the compounds useful according to the invention are useful for the purposes of purification of the compounds, for example by exploitation of the solubility differences between the salts and the parent compounds, side products and/or starting materials by techniques well known to those skilled in the an.<br>
Various substituents on the compounds useful according to the invention, e.g., as defined in R, Ri and R2, can be present in the starting compounds, added to any one of the intermediates or added after formation of the final products by known methods of substitution or conversion reactions. If the substituents themselves are reactive, then the substituents can themselves be protected according to the techniques known in the art. A variety of protecting groups known in the art may be employed. Examples of many of these possible groups may be found in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis' by T. W. Green, John Wiley and Sons, 1981. For example, nitro groups can be added to the aromatic ring by nitration, and the nitro groups then converted to other groups, such as amino, by reduction, and halo, by diazotization of the amino group and replacement of the diazo group. Acyl groups can be substituted onto the aryl groups by Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acyl groups then can be transformed to the corresponding alkyl groups by various methods, including the Wolff-Kishner reduction and Clemmenson reduction. Amino groups can be alkylated to form mono and dialkyiamino groups; and mercapto and hydroxy groups can be alkylated to form corresponding ethers. Primary alcohols can be oxidized by oxidizing agents known in the art to form carboxylic acids or aldehydes, and secondary alcohols can be oxidized to form ketones. Thus, substitution or alteration reactions can be employed to provide a variety of substituents throughout the molecule of the starting material, intermediates, or the final product.<br>
The starting materials and intermediates are prepared by the application or adaptation of known methods, for example methods as described in the Reference Examples or their obvious chemical equivalents.<br>

A three neck 2 L round bottom flask is charged with the MicroKANs [784, 25.5 micromoles/microKAN, 20.0 mmoies], and dichloromethane (800 mL). The reaction flask is fined with an overhead stirrer. N.N-<br><br>
diisopropylethylamine (20.9 mL, 120 mmoles) and 4-N.N-dimethylaminopyridine (195 mg. 1.6 mmoles) are added. After approximately 15 minutes, the methyl 4-chloro-4-oxobutyrate (12.0 g, 80.0 mmoles) is added. The reaction is allowed to stir for 61 hours, after which the reaction flask is drained. Dichloromethane (800 mL) is added to the reaction flask. After stirring for approximately 10 minutes, the flask is drained. This is repeated. The MicroKANs from al! of the acylation reactions are randomly combined into two separate large flasks and washed repeatedly in the following sequence: dichloromethane (1x4 L), THF (2x4 L), dichloromethane (1 x 4 L) then methanol (1x4 L), dichloromethane (1 x 4 L) then methanol (1x4 L), dichloromethane (1 x 4 L) then methanol (1x4 L), dichloromethane (1 x 4 L) and ether ( 1 x 4 L).<br>
5.  Cleavage:<br>
The MicroKANs are sorted into an individual well of IRORI AccuCleave 96 cleavage station. The well is charged with dichloromethane (600 mL) and then with a TFA: dichloromethane mixture (1:1, 600 mL). After agitating for approximately forty minutes, the reaction well is drained into 2 mL microtubes in an 96-well format. The reaction well is again charged with dichloromethane (600 mL). After manual agitation, this too is drained into the 2 mL microtubes in an 96-well format. The cleavage cocktail is removed in vacua using a Savant Speedvac. The concentrated products from the cleavage mother plates are reconstituted with THF and transferred into two daughter plates utilizing a Packard MultiProbe liquid handler. The daughter plates are concentrated in vacuo utilizing a GenieVac. Analytical:  MS: m/z 442.2 (M+H*).<br>
