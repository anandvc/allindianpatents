				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to cooling devices in large buildings and, in particular, concerns a large<br>
diameter low speed fan that can be used to slowly circulate a large volume of air in a uniform manner throughout a<br>
building so as to facilitate cooling of individuals or animals located in the building.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
People who work in large structures such as warehouses and manufacturing plants are routinely exposed to<br>
working conditions that range from being uncomfortable to hazardous. On a hot day, the inside air temperature can<br>
reach a point where a person is unable to maintain a healthy body temperature. Moreover, many activities that occur<br>
in these environments, such as welding or operating internal combustion engines, create airborne contaminants that<br>
can be deleterious to those exposed. The effects of airborne contaminants are magnified to an even greater extent if<br>
the area is not properly vented.<br>
The problem of cooling large structures cannot always be solved using conventional air-conditioning methods. In<br>
particular, the large volume of air that is enclosed within a large structure would require powerful air conditioning devices<br>
to be effective. If such devices were used, the operating costs would be substantial. The cost of operating large air<br>
conditioning devices would be even greater if large doors where routinely left in an open state er if ventilation of outside air<br>
was required.<br>
In general, fans are commonly used to provide some degree of cooling when air conditioning is not feasible. A<br>
typical fan consists of a plurality of pitched blades radially positioned on a rotatable hub. The tip-to-tip diameter of such<br>
fans typically range from 3 feet up to 5 feet.<br>
When a typical fan rotates under the influence of a motor at higher rotational speeds, a pressure differential is<br>
created between the air near the fan blades and the surrounding air, causing a generally conical flow of air that is directed<br>
along the fan's axis of rotation. The conical shape combined with drag forces acting at the boundary cf the moving mass<br>
of air cause the airflow pattern to flare out in a diffusive manner at downstream locations. As a consequence, the ability<br>
of these types of fans to provide effective and efficient cooling can be limited for individuals located at a distance from the<br>
fan.<br>
In particular, the effectiveness of a fan is based on the principle of evaporation. When the temperature of a<br>
human body increases beyond a threshold level, the body responds by perspiring. Through the process of evaporation, the<br>
more energetic molecules comprising the perspiration are released into the surrounding air, thus resulting in an overall<br>
decrease in the thermal energy of the exterior of the individuals body. The decrease in thermal energy due to evaporation<br>
serves to offset positive sources of thermal energy in the individual's body including metabolic activity and heat conduction<br>
with surrounding high temperature air.<br>
The rate of evaporative heat loss is highly dependent on the relative humidity of the surrounding air. If the<br>
surrounding air is motionless, then a layer of saturated air usually forms near the surface of the individual's skin which<br>
dramatically decreases the rate of evaporative heat loss as it prevents the evaporation from the individuals body. At this<br>
point perspiration builds up causing the body to break out into a sweat. The lack of an effective heat loss mechanism<br>
results in the body temperature increasing beyond a desired level.<br>
The airflow created by a fan helps to break up the saturated air near the surface of a person's skin and replace it<br>
with unsaturated air. This effectively allows the process of evaporation to continue for extended periods of time. The<br>
desired result is that the body temperature remains at a comfortable level.<br>
In large buildings, the conventional strategy for cooling individuals has been to employ many commonly available<br>
smafl diameter indoor fans. Small diameter fans have been favored over large diameter fans primarily because of physical<br>
constraints. In particular, large diameter fans require specially constructed high-strength light-weight blades that can<br>
withstand large stresses caused by significant gravitational moments that increase with an increasing blade length to<br>
width aspect ratio. In addition, the fact that the rotational inertia of the fan increases with the square of the diameter<br>
requires the use of high torque producing gear reduction mechanisms. Moreover, drive-train components are highly<br>
susceptible to mechanical failure due to the very large torques produced by conventional electric motors during then' startup<br>
phase.<br>
A drawback of using a conventional small diameter fan to create a continuous flow of air is that the resulting<br>
airflow dramatically decreases at downstream locations. This is due to the conical nature of the airflow combined with the<br>
relatively small mass of air that is contained in the airflow in comparison to resistive drag forces acting at the edge of the<br>
cone. To achieve a sufficient airflow in a large non-insulated building, a very large number of small diameter fans would be<br>
required. However, the large amount of electrical power required by the simultaneous use of these devices in great<br>
numbers negates their advantage as an inexpensive cooling system. Moreover, the use of many fans in an enclosed space<br>
can also result in increased air turbulence that can actually decrease the air flow in the building thereby decreasing the<br>
cooling effect of the fan.<br>
To achieve a sufficient airflow in large buildings without relying on an impractically targe number of small<br>
diameter fans, a small number of smaH diameter fans are typically operated at very high speeds. However, although these<br>
types of fans are capable of displacing a large amount of air in a relatively small amount of time, they do so in an<br>
undesirable manner. In particular, a smal high speed fan operates by moving a relatively small amount of air at a relatively<br>
high speed. Consequently, the speed of the airflow adjacent the fan and the level of noise produced are both very high.<br>
Furthermore, lighter weight objects, such as papers, may get displaced by the high speed air flow, thus causing a major<br>
disruption to the work environment<br>
Another problem with high speed fans is that they are inefficient at entraining a large enclosed volume of air in a<br>
steady continuous airflow pattern. In particular, assuming a best case scenario of laminar airflow, the power consumption<br>
of a fan is proportional to the cube of the airspeed produced by the fan. Consequently, an electrically driven high speed fan<br>
having a corresponding high speed airflow consumes electrical power at a relatively large rate. Furthermore, the effects of<br>
turbulence, which become more pronounced as the speed of the airflow increases, cause the translations! kinetic energy<br>
associated with the airflow of a high speed fan to be dissipated within a relatively small volume of air. Consequently, even<br>
though a relatively large amount of electrical power is consumed by the high speed fan, negligible airflows are produced at<br>
locations that are distant from the fan.<br>
To overcome insufficient airflow problems, larger numbers of high speed fans are sometimes used. However, this<br>
solution increases the ambient noise and operating costs even further. In addition, regions of fast moving air are expanded,<br>
thus increasing the risk of injury to exposed individuals. In particular, if the air is moving fast enough, foreign objects can<br>
become airborne, thus causing a hazardous situation. Papers and other light objects can also be greatly effected.<br>
Moreover, if the air temperature is above the skin temperature of an individual, then air moving faster than what is needed<br>
to break up the boundary layer actually reduces the cooing effect due to the increased rate of heat flow from the higher<br>
temperature air to the lower temperature skin of the individual.<br>
In addition to cooling, fans are also relied upon in ventilation systems that serve to remove airborne contaminants<br>
such as exhaust or smoke. Typical ventilation systems consist of a set of high speed fans located at the perimeter of the<br>
structure. However, the previously mentioned problems of high speed fans apply to high speed ventilation fans. The most<br>
serious problem is that some areas inside the structure are not properly ventilated.<br>
To improve ventilation, high speed indoor fans are sometimes used to distribute contaminants throughout the<br>
entire volume of a structure. However, the same limitations of high speed indoor fan systems described earlier apply to the<br>
problem of ventilation. In particular, high speed indoor fans are loud, inefficient, provide an insufficient airflow to some<br>
regions, and provide an undesirably large airflow to others.<br>
From the foregoing, it wiH be appreciated that there is a need for a cost efficient cooling device that can be<br>
effectively operated in large buildings. Furthermore, there is a need for such a device that is very efficient and does not<br>
disrupt the work environment with excessive noise or high speed airflows. Furthermore, there is a need for such a device<br>
that will dilute concentrated pockets of contaminated air contained within the structure more uniformly, thus providing<br>
optimal ventilation to the structure when used in conjunction with a conventional ventilation system.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The aforementioned needs are satisfied by the method of the present invention, the method in one embodiment<br>
comprising mounting a fan having a plurality of blades that are at least approximately 10 to 12 feet in length to a ceiling of<br>
the industrial budding and rotating the fan so as to produce a moving column of air that is approximately 20 to 24 feet in<br>
diameter at a position adjacent the fan. In one embodiment, the rotation of the fan imparts a velocity of approximately 3<br>
mph to 5 mph at a distance of 10 feet from the fan so that the fan entrains a volume of air to flow in a pattern throughout<br>
the industrial bidding so that the entrained air in the pattern disrupts the boundary layer of air adjacent the individuals so<br>
as to facilitate evaporation of sweat from the individual<br>
In one embodiment, the step of mounting the fan comprises mounting a plurality of fans having a plurality of<br>
blades of approximately 10 feet in length to the ceing of the industrial building wherein the ratio of such fans per square<br>
foot of building is approximately 1 fan per 10,000 square feet. In another embodiment, the step of rotating the fan so as<br>
to entrain the volume of air to flow in the pattern comprises entraining the air to flow in a column generally downward<br>
towards the floor of the building and then to travel laterally outward from the column.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the aforementioned needs are satisfied by the fan assembly of the present<br>
invention which is comprised of a support, a motor, a hub. and a plurality of fan blades. The support is adapted to allow<br>
the mounting of the fan assembly to the roof of the industrial building. The motor is coupled to the support and is engaged<br>
with a rotatabte shaft so as to induce rotation of the shaft The plurality ef fan blades are attached to the rotatable shaft<br>
and are approximately 10 feet in length and have an airfoil cross-section. The motor is adapted to rotate the fan blades at<br>
approximately 50 rotations per minute so that the plurality of fan blades produce a column of moving air that is<br>
approximately 20 feet in diameter at a position immediately adjacent the fan blades. In one embodiment, there are 10 foot<br>
blades that are rotated at an rpm such that the ratio of the velocity af the air in feet per minutes at a distance of<br>
approximately ten feet from the blades to the rpm is between the approximate range of 5 to 1 and 9 to 1 so that a moving<br>
volume of air is entrained in flow in a circulating pattern throughout the industrial building to thereby disrupt the boundary<br>
layer of air adjacent the individuals so as to facitate evaporation of sweat from the individual.<br>
From the foregoing, it should be apparent that the fan assembly of the present invention provides a quiet and<br>
cost-efficient way of cooling individuals in large non-insulated structures. The fan assembly of the present inventions<br>
effectiveness is based on its ability to provide a gentle yet steady airflow throughout the interior of the structure with<br>
minimal expenditure of mechanical energy. As a consequence, the fan assembly of the present invention dilutes<br>
concentrated pockets of air contaminants which helps to maintain breathable air throughout the interior of the structure.<br>
These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description<br>
taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Reference wiii now be made to the drawings wherein like numerals refer to like parts throughout Fig. 1 shows a<br>
low speed fan assembly 100 of the preferred embodiment in a typical warehouse or industrial bidding configuration. The<br>
low speed fan assembly 100 can be attached directly to any suitable preexisting supporting structure or to any suitable<br>
extension connected thereto such that the axis of rotation of the low speed fan assembly 100 is along a vertical direction.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the low speed fan assembly 100 attached to an extension piece 101 which is attached to a mounting location<br>
104 located on a warehouse ceiling 110 using conventional fasteners, such as nuts, bolts and welds, known in the art.<br>
A control box 102 is connected to the low speed fan assembly 100 through a standard power transmission line.<br>
The purpose of the control box 102 is to supply electrical energy to the low speed fan assembly 100 in a manner which is<br>
further described in a following section. As shown in Fig. 1, the low speed fan assembly 100 is mounted high above the<br>
floor 105 of an industrial building so that the fan 100 can cool the occupants of the building. As will be described in<br>
greater detail below, the low speed fan assembly 100 is very large in size and is capable of generating a large mass of<br>
moving air such that a large column of relatively slow moving air is entrained to travel throughout the facility to cool the<br>
occupants of the facility.<br>
In particular, as shown in Fig. 2, when a user places the low speed fan assembly 100 into an operational mode by<br>
entering appropriate input into the control box 102, a uniform gentle circulatory airflow 200 (Fig. 2) is formed throughout<br>
the building interior 106. In a general sense, the circulatory airflow 200 begins as a large relatively slowly moving<br>
downward airflow 202. The airflow 202 is able to travel through vast open spaces due to its large amount of inertia) mass<br>
and because it travels away from the fan assembly 100 in a columnar manner as will be described in greater detail in a<br>
following section. Consequently, the airflow 202 approaches a floor area 212 located beneath the fan assembly 100<br>
largely unimpeded with a large amount of inertial mass.<br>
Upon reaching the floor area 212. the airflow 202 subsequently becomes an outwardly moving lower horizontal<br>
airflow 204. The lower horizontal air flow 204 is directed by the walls 214 of the warehouse into an upward airflow 206<br>
which is further directed by the warehouse ceiling 110 into an upper inwardly moving horizontal airflow 210. Upon<br>
reaching a region 216 above the fan assembly 100, the returning air in airflow 210 is directed downward again by the<br>
action of the fan assembly 100, thus repeating the cycle.<br>
The continuously circulating airflow 200 created by the fan assembly 100 provides a more pleasant working<br>
environment for individuals working inside the warehouse interior 106. As discussed above, in warm environments.<br>
the occupants begin to sweat, creating a moisture laden boundary layer adjacent the occupant's skin. With no<br>
airflow, the boundary layer is not disrupted which inhibits further evaporation of the occupant's sweat. The airflow<br>
200 provides relief to the occupant by replacing the moisture laden air near the skin of individuals with unsaturated air<br>
thereby allowing more evaporative cooling to take place. Furthermore, the circulatory airflow 200 created by the fan<br>
assembly 100 significantly reduces the deleterious effects of airborne contaminants by uniformly distributing the<br>
contaminants throughout the warehouse interior. Moreover, the fan assembly 100 produces a very low volume of<br>
noise and its associated circulatory airflow 200 is minimally disruptive to the work environment. It will be<br>
appreciated from the following discussion that the fan assembly 100 is able to provide these benefits in a very cost<br>
effective manner.<br>
The tow speed fan assembly 100 wi now be described in more detail in reference to Figs. 3 through 11<br>
hereinbelow. Fig. 3A shows a detailed side elevation view of the low speed fan assembly 100. Fig 3B is a magnified side<br>
elevation view of the fan assembly 100 that iustrates the lower section in greater detail.<br>
The fan assembly 100 receives mechanical support from a support frame 302. The support frame 302 includes<br>
an upper steel horizontal plate 322 that is adapted to attach to a suitable horizontal support structure adjacent to a ceiling<br>
of the building such that contact is made between the support structure and a first surface 366 of plate 322 to thereby<br>
aKow the fan assembly 100 to be mounted adjacent the ceifing. In one embodiment, the plate 322 is bolted to a ceiling<br>
support girder so that the fan assembly 100 extends downward from the ceiling of the building in the manner similar to<br>
that shown in fig. 1.<br>
A first end 325 of each of a pair of support beams 326a, 326b are welded a second surface 370 of plate 322 so<br>
as to extend in a direction that is perpendicular to the plane of the plate 322. A lower steel horizontal plate 324 is welded<br>
to a second end 335 of the support beams 326a, 326b along a first surface 372 of plate 324 so that the plane of the<br>
second horizontal plate 324 is perpendicular to the axis of the support beams 326a, 326b. The second horizontal plate<br>
324 contains an opening 327 that allows an electric motor 304 having a housing 376 to be mounted inside the frame 302<br>
adjacent the surface 372 of the plate 324. This allows a shaft 306 of the electric motor 304 that extends from the<br>
electric motor housing 376 to extend through the opening 327 so as to be adjacent a second surface 374 of the plate 324.<br>
Electrical power is transferred from the control box 102 to the electric motor 304 along a standard power<br>
transmission line through a junction box 360 located on the upper perimeter of housing 376 of the electric motor 304. The<br>
motor assembly also includes a mounting plate 330 that is a round annular steel plate that is integrally attached to the<br>
housing 376 adjacent the shaft 306 and lies in a plans that is perpendicular to the shaft 306. The mounting plate 330 is<br>
interposed between the motor housing 376 and the second support plate 324 of the support frame as shown in Fig. 3A and<br>
3B.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the electric motor 304 is adapted to receive an AC power source with a varying<br>
frequency which allows the electric motor 304 to produce a variable torque. By using an AC device, the use of problematic<br>
pole-switching brushes found in DC style motors is avoided. The electric motor 304 further contains a built-in gear<br>
reduction mechanism that provides the necessary mechanical advantage to drive the large fan assembly 100. The electric<br>
motor 304 used in the preferred embodiment is manufactured by the Sumitomo Machinery Corporation of America and has<br>
a model number CNVM-84097YA35. The maximum rate of power consumption of the electric motor 304 used in the<br>
preferred embodiment is 370 Watts.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the control box 102 is implemented in the form of an AC power supply with<br>
variable frequency control manufactured by Sumitomo Machinery Corporation of America with a model number NT2012-<br>
A75. A digital operator interface allows the user to select different operating conditions. For example, the user can select<br>
an initial startup by instructing the control box 102 to produce an AC voltage with a graduaiy increasing frequency so as<br>
to prevent the electric motor 304 from damaging the fan assembly 100. In another example, the user can select a<br>
maximum continuous speed by instructing the control box 102 to produce an AC voltage with a fixed frequency of 60 Hz.<br>
In another example, the user can select a reduced continuous speed by instructing the control box 102 to produce an AC<br>
voltage with a fixed frequency less than 60 Hz.<br>
The control box 102 used in the preferred embodiment also provides other advantages. For instance, the control<br>
box 102 can be remotely operated by a central control station. Standard analog inputs also alow the device to easily<br>
receive control input from thermometers, relative humidity measuring devices, and air speed monitors.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3A, the electric motor 304 is mounted directly to the support frame 302 so as to provide the<br>
fan assembly 100 with a driving torque. In particular, a first surface 502 (see Figs. 5A and 58) of the mounting plate 330<br>
of the electric motor 304 is positioned adjacent the first surface 372 of the second support plate 324 of the support frame<br>
302 so that the motor shaft 306 extends through the opening 327 of the plate 324. Furthermore, the rotational axis of<br>
the electric motor 304, defined by the elongated axis of the motor shaft 306, is oriented so as to be perpendicular to the<br>
plane of the plate 324. In addition, a boss member 504 that integrally extends from the first surface 502 of the mounting<br>
plate 330 (Figs. 5A and 5B) is flushly positioned within the opening 327 of the plate 324. As wl be described in greater<br>
detail below, the mounting plate 330, positioned in the foregoing manner, is secured to the plate 324 with a plurality of<br>
fasteners so as to secure the electric motor 304 to the support frame 302.<br>
The motor shaft 306 transfers torque from the electric motor 304 to a hub 312 that is mounted on the shaft<br>
306. The hub 312, in this embodiment, is a single cast aluminum piece of material with a disk-like shape that is adapted to<br>
secure a set of fan blades 316. As will be described in greater detail below, the hub 312 is adapted to mount on the motor<br>
shaft 306 and provide a mounting location for a plurality of fan blades 316 (see Fig. 6) so that rotation of the motor shaft<br>
306 wiH result in rotation of the fan blades 316. The hub 312 contains a round flat central section 346 that generally<br>
extends radialy outward from the shaft 306 so as to define a plane and comprises an inner surface 352 and a parallel<br>
outer surface 356 (Fig. 3B).<br>
As shown in Fig. 3B, a cylindrically symmetric flange section 342 extends inwardly from the center of the central<br>
section 346 in a direction that is orthogonal to the plane of the central section 346. The flange section 342 defines a<br>
cylindrically symmetric opening 344 that is adapted to receive the motor shaft 306 and a locking collet 310. In one<br>
embodiment, the collet 310 is manufactured by Fenner Trantorque with a model number 62002280. At an outer region<br>
354 of the central section 346, a symmetric polygonal rim section 350 extends upwardly from the inner surface 352 of the<br>
central section 346 in a direction orthogonal to the plane «f the central section 346.<br>
A plurality of narrow structural ribs 362 are integrally formed along a radial direction along the inner surface 352<br>
of the central section 346 and join the inner surface 352 to both the flange section 342 and the rim section 350 of the<br>
central section 346. Measured from the surface 356 along a direction perpendicular to the surface 356, the heights of the<br>
hub 312 at the rim section 350, at the flange section 342, and along any of the structural ribs 362 are, in this<br>
embodiment, approximately equal to each other.<br>
A plurality of blade supports 314 extend from an outer surface 380 from the rim section 350 so as to extend<br>
radially outward from the axis of rotation defined by the motor shaft 306 by an approximate distance of 15 inches. The<br>
support blades 314 have a paddle-like shape and are adapted to slip into the ends of a plurality of fan blades 316 to provide<br>
a means for mounting the fan blades 316 to the hub 312. A more thorough discussion of the fan blades 316 including their<br>
mounting procedure is provided below.<br>
The hub 312 is placed in a mounting position by orienting the hub 312 in a plane perpendicular to the shaft 306<br>
so that the inner surface 352 is facing in the direction of the electric motor 304. The hub 312 is then positioned so that<br>
the shaft 306 extends through the opening 327 of the flange section 342 until the first end 364 of the shaft 306 is<br>
approximately coplanar with the outer surface 356 of the central section 346 of the hub 311 With the hub 312 in<br>
position, the hub 312 is secured to the shaft 306 using the collet 310 in a manner which is known in the art such that the<br>
no slipping occurs between the hub 312 and the motor shaft 306.<br>
A set of safety retainers 320 are used to support the combined weight of the hub 312 and the set of fan blades<br>
316 in an emergency situation. In this embodiment, each safety retainer 320 is essentiaiy a u-shaped piece of high<br>
strength aluminum of approximately one inch in width. Each safety retainer 320 is comprised of a straight first section<br>
332. a straight second section 334 that extends orthogonaly from the first section 332, and a straight third section 336<br>
that extends orthogonally from the second section to complete the u-like shape of the safety retainer 320.<br>
Each safety retainer 320 is mounted to the hub 312 by positioning the first section 332 along the inner surface<br>
352 of the central section 346 so that the second section 334 is flushly positioned adjacent the rim section 350 of the<br>
central section 346. With the first section 332 radially aligned on the inner surface 352, the first section 332 is secured to<br>
the central section 346 using a plurality of bolts 340, thus securing the safety retainer 320 to the hub 312.<br>
In a secured state, each safety retainer 320 is adapted so that the third section 336 extends over the second<br>
support plate 324 of the support frame 302 by an amount that allows the plurality of safety retainers 320 to<br>
independently support the hub 312 in the event that the hub 312 is disengaged from the fan assembly 100. In particular,<br>
the third sections 336 of the safety retainers 320 wi catch on the first surface 372 of the second support plate 324 in<br>
the event that the hub 312 is disengaged from the shaft 306 of the electric motor 304, e.g. if the collet 310 fate, or in the<br>
event that the shaft 306 ruptures. In this way. the safety retainers 320 will prevent the hub 312 and the attached fan<br>
blades 316 from failing to the floor below. Moreover, each safety retainer 320 is also adapted in a manner that prevents<br>
the third section 336 from coining into contact with the support beams 326a, 326b and are generally positioned above the<br>
first surface 372 of the second support plate 324 when the fan assembly 100 is operating property.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, four safety retainers 320 are positioned at ninety degrees intervals from each<br>
other. If the hub 312 becomes disconnected from the shaft 306 while the fan assembly 100 is mounted in a vertical<br>
manner as shown in Fig. 1, then the safety retainers 320 will provide a means of support for the hub 312, thus preventing<br>
the hub 312 from falling to the ground.<br>
Three separate views relating to the support frame 302 are shown in Figs. 4A, 48 and 4C which further<br>
illustrates the components of the support frame 302. As shown by the plan view of the first support plate 322 in Fig. 4A,<br>
the plate 322 contains a plurality of mounting holes 400 that are used to attach the fan assembly 100 to a suitable<br>
overhanging structure. In this embodiment, the mounting holes 400 are uniformly distributed about the plate 322 so that<br>
each hole 400 is proximally located at the midpoint between the center and the edge of plate 322.<br>
The plate 322 further comprises a pair of rectangular regions 402 that defines a weld pattern between the plate<br>
322 and the first end 325 of each of the pair of support beams 326a, 326b (Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig. 4A, the pair of<br>
rectangular regions 402 are aligned with each other and located distally from the center of the plate 322 with the center<br>
acting as the midpoint between the pair of rectangular regions 402.<br>
As shown by the plan view of the second support plate 324 in Fig. 4C, the plate 324 contains a plurality of<br>
mounting boles 416 that are uniformly distributed so that each hole 416, in this embodiment, is approximately 67 mm from<br>
the center of plate 324. The mounting holes are used to secure the electric motor 304 to the plate 324. The opening 327<br>
of the plate 324 is a centered circular hole having an approximate radius of 55 mm which, as discussed above, is adapted<br>
to receive the boss member 504 of the electric motor 304.<br>
The plate 324 further comprises a pair of rectangular regions 404 that defines a weW pattern between the plate<br>
324 and the second end 335 of each of the pair of support beams 326a, 326b (Fig. 4B). The pair of rectangular regions<br>
404 are aligned with each other and located distally from the center of plate 324 with the center acting as the midpoint<br>
between the pair of rectangular regions 404.<br>
Reference will now be made to Figs. 5A and 5B which include a side view of the electric motor 304 (Fig. 5A) and<br>
an end view of the electric motor 304 as seen by an observer looking toward the motor shaft 306 (Fig. 5B). In particular,<br>
Figs. 5A and 5B both illustrate the boss member 504 that extends from the surface 502 of the mounting plate 330 so that<br>
the plane of the boss member 504 is parallel to the plane of the mounting plate 330. As mentioned previously, the boss<br>
member 504 is adapted to be flushly positioned within the opening 327 of the second support plate 324 of the support<br>
frame 302.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5B, the mounting plate 330 of the electric motor 304 is adapted with a plurality of mounting<br>
holes 500 (Fig. 5B) that are uniformly distributed near the edge of the mounting plate 330. In particular, the mounting<br>
holes 500 are adapted to align with the mounting holes 416 of the plate 324 when the electric motor 304 is positioned<br>
within the support frame 302 as shown in Fig. 3A. Consequently, the electric motor 304 can be secured to the support<br>
frame 302 in the configuraton of Fig. 3A by securing a plurality of standard fasteners through the holes 500 and 416 in a<br>
manner that is known in the art.<br>
Fig. 6 is a view of the fan assembly 100 as seen from below and illustrates the relationship between the hub<br>
312. the set of blade supports 314 extending from the hub 312, and the set of fan blades 316 extending from the blade<br>
supports 314. Each fan blade 316 extends orthogonally from the rotational axis of the fan assembly 100 as defined by the<br>
motor shaft 306 in a manner that results in a uniform distribution of fan blades 316. In this embodiment, the set of fan<br>
blades 316 covers the set of blade supports 314 thus obscuring the view of the set of blade supports 314.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the diameter of the fan assembly 100 can be fabricated with a diameter ranging<br>
from 15 feet up to 40 feet and, more preferably, 20 to 40 feet. The fan blades 110 have a length of at least<br>
approximately 7.5 feet and, more preferably, at least approximately 10 feet. This results in the aspect ratio of each fan<br>
blade 316 to range between 15:1 up to 40:1 and, more preferably, 20:1 to 40:1. When the fan assembly 100 is operating<br>
under normal conditions, the drive ratio of the electric motor 304 is set so that the blade tip velocity is approximately 50<br>
ft/sec.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a magnified view of a single fan blade 316 as viewed from below. In this embodiment, each fan<br>
blade 316 takes the form of a long narrow piece of aluminum with a hollow interior. Each fan blade 316 further contains a<br>
first opening 710 adjacent an inside edge 714 of the blade 316 and an second opening 712 adjacent an outside edge 716<br>
of the blade 316. A plurality of mounting holes 700 that allow the securing of the fan blades 316 to the blade supports<br>
314 of the hub 312 as described in a following section are located proximal to the first opening 710.<br>
In this embodiment, the fan blades 316 are fabricated using a forced aluminum extrusion method of productioa<br>
This allows ightwetght fan blades with considerable structural integrity to be produced in an inexpensive manner. It also<br>
enables fan blades to be inexpensively fabricated with an airfoil shape. In this embodiment, each fan blades 316 is<br>
fabricated with a uniform cross-section along its length. However, additional embodiments could incorporate extruded<br>
aluminum fan blades with a non-uniform cross-section.<br>
The aerodynamic qualities of the fan blade 316 are improved by mounting a tapered flap 704 to the fan blade<br>
316 using standard fasteners. The flap 704 is essentially a lightweight long flat strip of rigid material with a tapered end.<br>
The flap 704 results in a more uniform airflow from the fan assembly 100 as is discussed in greater detail in a following<br>
section.<br>
Using standard fasteners, a cap 702 is mounted inside the second opening 712 located at the second edge 716<br>
of the fan blade 316, thus providing a continuous exterior surface proximal to the second edge 716. In one embodiment,<br>
the cap comprises a minimal structure that essentially matches the cross-sectional area of the fan Wade 316. In other<br>
embodiments, the cap further comprises additional aerodynamic structures such as a soil plate. In other embodiments, the<br>
cap is adapted to attach additional structural support members such as a circular ring around the circumference of the fan<br>
assembly 100.<br>
A magnified view of the inner side of the hub 312 as seen along a line that is parallel to the shaft 306 is shown<br>
in Fig. 8. The plurality of ribs 362 are shown extending from the flange section 342 to the polygonal rim section 350.<br>
Each rib 362 is also shown joining the rim section 350 at the midline of the blade support 314. Each rib 362 is intended to<br>
inhibit the large force applied by the corresponding fan blade 316 onto the hub 312 from compromising the structural<br>
integrity of the hub 312. As shown in Fig. 8. the number of planar surfaces that comprises the outer surface 380 of the<br>
polygonal rim section 350 equals the number of blade supports 314 that radially extend outward from the outer surface<br>
380 of the rim section 350 of the hub 311 This arrangement provides a perpendicular relationship between each blade<br>
support 314 and each adjacent outer surface 380, thus enabling the fan blades 316 to be flushiy mounted to the outer<br>
surface 380 of the hub 312 in a manner which is described in greater detail below. In this embodiment, the hub 312<br>
comprises a total of ten blade supports, ten outer surfaces 340 and ten ribs 362.<br>
The hub 312 further comprises a first pluraity of mounting holes 800 that are located along the midline of each<br>
blade support 314. The plurality of holes 800 are used in conjunction with standard fasteners to secure the plurality of fan<br>
blades 316 to the plurality of blade supports 314. Each fan blade 316 is mounted to the hub 312 by fitting the inside<br>
opening 710 of the fan Made 316 around a correspond blade support 314 so that the inside edge 714 of the fan blade<br>
316 is flusWy mounted adjacent to the outer surface 380 of the rim section 350 of the hub 312. Each fan blade 316 is<br>
secured to a blade support 314 using the mounting holes 700 in conjunction with the set of mounting holes 800 of the<br>
blade support 314 and a set of standard fasteners in a manner that is known in the art.<br>
The hub 312 further comprises a second plurality of mounting holes 802. The second plurality of mounting holes<br>
802 are symmetrically distributed in a radial pattern on the central section 346 of the hub 312. The holes 802 are used in<br>
conjunction the safety retainer bolts 340 to secure the safety retainers 320 to the hub 312 in a manner which is known in<br>
the art<br>
A magnified cross-sectional view of a single blade support 314 is shown in Fig. 9 as seen by an observer looking<br>
along the plane of the central section 346 of the hub 312 toward the center of the hub 312 with the fan blades 316<br>
removed. Each blade support 314 is essentially a paddble structure that extends in a perpendicular manner from the<br>
outer surface 380 of the polygonal rim section 350. Furthermore, each blade support 314 is tilted out of the plane of the<br>
hub 312 in a manner which is described below.<br>
Each blade support 314 comprised of a broad central section 900 located between an elevated tapered section<br>
902 and a lower tapered section 904, is tilted out of the plane of the central section 346 of the hub 312 by an angle theta.<br>
In this case, theta is defined as the angle between the intersection of a lower surface 906 of the central section 900 and<br>
the adjacent surface 380 of the polygonal rim section 350 and the a line parallel to both the plane of the central section<br>
346 of the hub 312 and the adjacent surface 380. This allows the fan blades 316 to be mounted with a corresponding<br>
angle of attack equal to theta. In one embodiment, the angle theta is equal to eight degrees for at blade supports 314.<br>
When the fan assembly 100 is rotating, the blade support 314 shown in Fig. 9 would appear to travel with the elevated<br>
section 902 leading the lowered section 904.<br>
The central section 900 of each blade support 314 is essentially rectangular in shape and thus bound by the<br>
lower surface 906 as well as a parallel upper surface 910. The rectangular shape of the central section 900 provides an<br>
effective mounting structure for the fan blades 314 as is described in greater detail below.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a cross-sectional view of the fan blade 316 at an arbitrary location along its length as seen by an<br>
observer looking towards the second opening 712. The fan blade is comprised of a first curved wall 1024. a second curved<br>
wall 1026. and a cavity region 1022 formed therefrom. The two walls 1024 and 1026 are joined together at leading<br>
junction 1031 and a trailing junction 1031 At the trailing junction 1032, the two walls 1024 and 1026 combine in a<br>
continuous manner to form a third wall 1030. The third wall 1030 continues unti it reaches a trailing edge 1014. A first<br>
surface 1006 is formed at the exterior of wall 1024 and continues in a seamless manner to the exterior of wafl 1030 until<br>
the trailing edge 1014 is reached. A second surface 1010 is formed at the exterior of wall 1026 and continues in a<br>
seamless manner to the exterior of wall 1030 until the trailing edge is reached. The two surfaces 1006 and 1010 meet at<br>
a leading edge 1012. The cavity region 1022 is comprised mainly of a rectangularly-shaped broad central section 1000. A<br>
planar third surface 1016 is formed at the interior of wall 1024 in the region of section 1000 and a planer fourth surface<br>
1020 is formed at the interior of wan 1030 in the region of section 1000. Consequently, both of the planar interior<br>
surf aces 1016 and 1020 are parallel to each other.<br>
Each fan blade 316 is adapted so that the shape of the broad central section 1000 in the interior of the fan blade<br>
316 precisely matches the shape of the corresponding central section 900 of the Hade support 314. Consequently, when<br>
the fan blade 316 is positioned around its corresponding blade support 314 and attached with a plurality of fasteners, a<br>
secure fit will be realized. Moreover, since flat surfaces are easier to manufacture than curved surfaces, this method of<br>
attachment is cost effective.<br>
The two exterior surfaces 1006 and 1010 are adapted to form an airfoil shape, in one embodiment, the airfoil<br>
shape is based on the shape of a German sail plane wing having a reference number FX 62K-131. Due to structural<br>
limitations associated with the extruded manufacturing process, it is difficult to exactly match the shape of the fan blade<br>
316 to an optimal airfoil shape. In particular, it is difficult to extend the third wall 1030 to match the preferred airfoil<br>
shape. When the flap 704 is mounted to the third wall 1030 along the trailing edge 1014 in a smooth and continuous<br>
manner, it essentially acts as an extension to the third wall 1030, thus matching the airfoil shape more closely.<br>
If the flap 704 (Fig. 7) is tapered so that it is wide near the inside edge 714 and narrow near the outside edge<br>
716. then an improved design can be realized. By tapering the flap 704, the shape of the blade becomes increasingly<br>
optimal at decreasing rady. The foregoing relationship acts to compensate for the decreasing blade speed at decreasing<br>
radii, thus resulting in a more uniform airflow across the entire fan assembly 100.<br>
When the fan assembly 100 is in an operating mode, the cross-sectional image of the fan blade 316 shown in Fig.<br>
11 tilted by a corresponding angle of attack in a clockwise manner would appear to travel with the leading edge 1012 in<br>
front. According to an observer fixed to an individual fan blade 316, the motion of the fan Wade 316 causes air currents<br>
1100 and 1102 along the surfaces 1006 and 1010 of the fan blade 316 respectively. The airfoil shape of each fan blade<br>
316 causes the velocity of the upper air current 1034 to be greater than the velocity of the lower air current 1036.<br>
Consequently, the air pressure at the lower surface 1010 is greater than the air pressure at the upper surface 1006.<br>
The apparent asymmetric airflows produced by the rotation of the fan blades 316 results an upward lift force<br>
Fh, to be experienced by each fan blade 316. A reactive downward force Farticle, is therefore applied to the surrounding air<br>
by each fan Made 316. Moreover, the airfoil shape of the fan blade 316 minimizes a horizontal drag force F#, acting on<br>
each fan Wade 316. therefore resulting in a minimum horizontal force Felectrical being applied to the surrounding air by each<br>
fan blade 316. Consequently, the airflow created by the fan assembly 100 approximates a columnar flow of air along the<br>
axis of rotation of the fan assembly 100.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the fan assembly 100 is capable of producing a mild columnar airflow with a 20<br>
foot diameter. The columnar nature of this airflow combined with its large inertial mass allow the airflow to span large<br>
spaces. Therefore, the fan assembly 100 is able to provide wide ranging mild circulatory airflows thai serve to cool<br>
individuals in large warehouse environments. In the preferred embodiment, the foregoing capabilities an achieved at a<br>
remarkably low power consumption rate of only 370 Watts per 10,000 square feet of building space.<br>
In repeated experiments using a prototype version of the fan assembly 100, measurements of air speed were<br>
made by the Applicant. The prototype version of the fan assembly 100 had an outer diameter, measured from outside edge<br>
716 to outside edge 716 of each opposing pair of fan blades 316, equal to 20 feet and was comprised of 10 fan blades.<br>
The averages of multiple sets of individual air speed measurements obtained at locations 10 feet downwind from the fan<br>
blades 316 ranged from 3 up to 5 miles per hour. The maximum air speed measured at locations two feet downwind from<br>
the fan blades 316 was found to be no greater than 6 miles per hour.<br>
Throughout the trials performed by the Applicant, the velocity of the outside edge 716 of the fan blades 316<br>
was maintained at 36 miles per hour while the electric motor 304 consumed a mere 370 Watts of power. A columnar<br>
airflow with a diameter of 20 feet was generated which was sufficient to provide cooling throughout a 10,000 square foot<br>
warehouse that contained the fan assembly 100.<br>
The technical difficulties involved in designing the fan assembly 100 have been overcome by incorporating<br>
innovative design features. In particular, the large fan blades 316 are manufactured using an extruded aknaum technique.<br>
This method results in fan blades 316 that are sturdy, lightweight and inexpensive to manufacture. This method also<br>
enables the fan blades 316 to be fabricated with an airfoil shape which enables a columnar airflow to be generated.<br>
Furthermore, the electric motor 304 used in the fan assembly 100 is a compact unit that contains a built-in gear reduction<br>
mechanism that enables the electric motor 304 to produce the large torque required by the large fan assembly 100. The<br>
electric motor 304 is also a controllable device that is capable of producing a gentle torque at startup thereby reducing<br>
mechanical stress within the fan assembly 100. In addition, the electric motor 304 also provides a reduced steady torque<br>
for reduced speed operation. Moreover, the safety aspects of the fan assembly 100 have been enhanced by including a<br>
plurality of safety retainers 320 that are designed to support the hub 312 along with the plurality of fan blades 316 in the<br>
event that the hub 312 becomes disengaged from the fan assembly 100.<br>
Although the preferred embodiment of the present invention has shown, described and pointed out the<br>
fundamental novel features of the invention as applied to this embodiment, it will be understood that various omissions,<br>
substitutions and changes in the form of the detail of the device illustrated may be made by those skilled in the art without<br>
departing from the spirit of the present invention. Consequently, the scope of the invention should not be limited to the<br>
