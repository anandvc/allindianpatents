				<td>DEVICE FOR DEGASSING AND FILTERING PLASTIC MELTS<br>
[0001] The invention concerns a device for extruding thermoplastic synthetic products with<br>
an extruder screw mounted in a housing. The screw has a plasticizing section on the feed<br>
side thereof, a degassing section positioned upstream, that is, in front of a discharge section<br>
thereof, and an oppositely operating feed screw flight between the plasticizing section and the<br>
degassing section. The device further has at least one flow channel that bridges over the<br>
oppositely operating feed screw flight and has a melt filter.<br>
[0002] Plastics, especially plastic wastes, which must be degassed and/or cleaned before<br>
being further processed, need to be expediently degassed and processed. Printing, painting or<br>
soiling of waste and/or used plastics requires that the plastics be cleaned before further use.<br>
[0003] It is known (from WO 93/04841 A1) to melt plastic being reprocessed in an extruder,<br>
force it through a filter and degas it before further processing or granulation. To avoid an<br>
overflow of molten plastic from the plasticizing section to the degassing or discharge section,<br>
and to guarantee that all the molten plastic passes through the melt filter, an oppositely<br>
operating feed screw flight is arranged between the plasticizing section and the degassing<br>
section in the form of a feeding thread or sealing thread. The thread has a direction opposite<br>
to that of the screw thread of the plasticizing section, degassing section and discharge section.<br>
This known reverse feeding thread causes the return of a small fraction of the plastic that<br>
already passed through and had been cleaned by the melt filter back to the plasticizing<br>
section. This is supposed to prevent uncleaned plastic product from directly reaching the<br>
degassing and discharge section by bypassing the melt filter. The openings of the flow<br>
channel with the melt filter at the inlet and outlet sides are arranged right next to the reverse<br>
feeding thread to avoid dead spaces. This is supposed to prevent extended dwell times for the<br>
plastic product in the device which could cause heat damage to the plastic. A particular<br>
drawback of this device is that the feed screw sections with oppositely directed threads are in<br>
the nature of dynamic seals the tightness of which depends on the speed of the extruder<br>
screw. The viscosity of the plastic is also very important in this case, since plastic containing<br>
moisture forms vapors, and it cannot be prevented that moisture flows from the plasticizing<br>
section into the degassing section along these feed screw sections. Such vapors pass the filter<br>
and, amongst others, carry contaminants into the degassing section where they can again<br>
contaminate already filtered plastic, so that degassed and cleaned plastic of a uniform quality<br>
 <br>
cannot be guaranteed. In addition, excessive degassing, caused for example by the moisture<br>
in the plastic, can cause undesirable pressure fluctuations in the device.<br>
[0004] In view of this prior art, it is an objective of the invention to overcome the<br>
aforementioned drawbacks and provide a device with improved degassing capability that<br>
prevents a direct material and/or gas flow from the plasticizing section into the degassing<br>
section via the feed screw flights between the sections.<br>
[0005] This is attained with an extruder screw that has a feed screw flight which operates in<br>
the same direction as the screw and is located between an oppositely operating feed screw<br>
flight and an opening of a flow channel for the plastic on an outlet side of the screw. The<br>
transitional zone between the two feed screw flights includes at least one degassing opening.<br>
[0006] The invention is based on the requirement that gas overflows between the plasticizing<br>
section and the degassing section must strictly be prevented for producing qualitatively<br>
uniform, cleaned and degassed plastic. This is achieved in accordance with the invention, in<br>
that, on the one hand, material flow from the plasticizing section to the degassing section is<br>
prevented by the oppositely operating feed screw flight. Likewise, the flow of already<br>
cleaned plastic from the degassing section to the plasticizing section is prevented by the feed<br>
screw flight that operates in the same direction and that is arranged between the oppositely<br>
operating feed screw flight and the opening of the flow channel to the outlet section of the<br>
screw. This separates the two sections and permits a degassing opening, a monitorable outlet<br>
opening, and/or a reduced pressure space to be arranged between the two screw sections.<br>
[0007] Gases and dirt particles entering the oppositely operating feed screw flight from the<br>
plasticizing section are therefore prevented in a simple manner from directly flowing into the<br>
degassing section and can be discharged from the device. This degassing and discharge can<br>
be deliberately supported in the usual manner by connecting the degassing space to a vacuum<br>
pump. Material overflows due to the emission of large amounts of gas caused, for example,<br>
by evaporating water can thereby be compensated for and suppressed in a simple manner. In<br>
accordance with the present invention, the pressures in the plasticizing and filtering sections<br>
are connected to the degassing and discharge section only via the flow channel, which assures<br>
a constant filling of the discharge screw and a constant degassing of the plastic. This also<br>
ensures that no dirt particles can be transported from the plasticizing section to the degassing<br>
section without having been passed through the melt filter.<br>
 <br>
[0008] To reduce the wear of the oppositely rotating feed screw flight connected to the<br>
plasticizing section caused by uncleaned, plasticized plastic entering the feed screw flight, it<br>
is advantageous to connect the flow channel on the outlet side of the melt filter via at least<br>
one return channel, which preferably includes a check valve, to the oppositely operating feed<br>
screw flight of the extruder screw at the feeding side of the device. A deliberate, small<br>
backflow of clean plastic through the feed screw flight to the plasticizing section makes<br>
certain that no uncleaned plastic enters the oppositely operating feed screw flight. The check<br>
vale reliably prevents a flow of unfiltered plastic to the filtered side, especially during the<br>
startup phase of the device.<br>
[0009] To improve the degassing effect, a preferably threadless degassing space is provided<br>
between the oppositely operating screw flight of the extruder screw and the other screw flight<br>
operating in the same direction, which is defined by the extruder screw and/or the housing.<br>
Gases entering this area through the degassing opening are simply discharged from the device<br>
via the oppositely operating feed screw flight and the one operating in the same direction<br>
which reliably assures the desired pressure decoupling.<br>
[0010] To avoid a flow of plastic material through the oppositely operating feed screw flight<br>
towards the other feed screw flight that operates in the same direction due to a very low<br>
viscosity of the molten plastic, wear of the oppositely operating feed screw flight or the like,<br>
it is recommended to provide a further, oppositely operating feed screw flight section,<br>
preferably with smaller thread height, between the degassing space and the feed screw flight<br>
that operates in the same direction.<br>
[0011] To improve the flow density of the feed screw flight operating in the same direction,<br>
the extruder screw can be provided with a damming element in the vicinity of the opening of<br>
the flow channel at the discharge side of the screw. This damming element can be, for<br>
example, a ring element, a reduced pitch on the feed screw and/or an enlarged screw core<br>
diameter relative to the degassing section. The counterpressure of the plastic product against<br>
the feed screw flight operating in the same direction is thereby increased.<br>
[0012] The drawing shows in cross-section a practical example of a device incorporating the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0013] A device for the extrusion of thermoplastic synthetic products includes an extruder<br>
transport screw 2 mounted in a housing 1. The screw has a plasticizing section P on its feed<br>
side and a degassing section E arranged in front of a discharge section A. Between the<br>
 <br>
plasticizing section P and the degassing section E is an oppositely threaded and therefore<br>
oppositely operating feed screw flight 3 that is bridged over by a flow channel 5 housing a<br>
melt filter 4. To prevent a direct flow of gases formed in the plasticizing section to the<br>
degassing section, extruder screw 2 has another feed screw flight 7 that operates in the same<br>
direction as the screw and is located between oppositely operating feed screw flight 3 and an<br>
opening 6 of the flow channel 5 into the degassing section (E). In the transitional area<br>
between the oppositely operating feed screw flight 3 and the feed screw flight 7 operating in<br>
the same direction there is a degassing opening 8 through which gases and contaminants<br>
entering the feed screw flight area can be advantageously discharged from the device 1 so<br>
that a decoupling of pressure is assured.<br>
[0014] Plastic to be processed is fed to device 1 via a filling opening 9. Extruder screw 2<br>
melts the plastic in the plasticizing section P, and the molten plastic then passes along flow<br>
channel 5 and through melt filter 4. It is degassed in degassing section P. Degassing<br>
openings 10 connected to a vacuum pump 11 can optionally be provided in this area. When<br>
needed, a vacuum pump can be provided for degassing opening 8. Following the degassing<br>
process, the plastic is discharged from device 1 via discharge section A and can optionally be<br>
fed to a casting mold, a granulation head or the like. The two feed screw flights 3, 7 prevent<br>
plastic entering the area of the flight screws from the plasticizing section as well as from the<br>
degassing section.<br>
[0015] The outlet side of the melt filter 4 in communication with flow channel 5 is connected<br>
via a return channel 12 with a check valve 13 to the oppositely operating feed screw flight 3<br>
of extruder screw 2. As a result, a small amount of already cleaned plastic is deliberately<br>
returned to the plasticizing section during operation of the device to prevent contaminated,<br>
wear-promoting plastic from entering the area where feed screw flight 3 is located. For<br>
improved degassing, a threadless degassing space 14 is provided between the oppositely<br>
operating feed screw flight and the one operating in the same direction of the extruder screw<br>
2. An additional, oppositely operating feed screw flight section 15 with a relatively smaller<br>
thread height is arranged between degassing space 14 and the feed screw flight 7 that<br>
operates in the same direction to reliably prevent an overflow of plastic from the plasticizing<br>
side to the degassing side. The extruder screw 2 has a damming element 16 in the vicinity of<br>
the opening of the flow channel 5 on the outlet side in the form of a damming ring that<br>
increases the gas tightness of the feed screw flight 7 that operates in the same direction.<br>
