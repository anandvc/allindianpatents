				<td>Title "METHOD OF FABRICATING A SOLAR MODULE WITH STRUCTURED<br>
AND INTEGRATED SERIES CONNECTED THIN FILM SOLAR CELLS<br>
AS A SUBSTRATE CELL TYPE,A SUPERSTRATE CELL TYPE AND A<br>
SOLAR MODULE THEREOF"<br>
Specification<br>
The invention relates to a method of fabricating a solar module with<br>
structured and integrated series-connected thin-film solar cells and to solar<br>
modules made by the method. The support layer of such solar cells may be<br>
either a substrate or a superstrate.<br>
Thin-film solar cells of either type are provided with light-absorbing<br>
absorber layers of cost-efficient amorphous, poly- or micro-crystalline<br>
semiconductor materials which may be precipitated or built up on large-<br>
surface substrates or superstrates by a many different methods. The small<br>
layer thickness of the absorber layers and the possibility of providing a<br>
structure during fabrication further reduce the manufacturing costs, so that<br>
thin-film solar cells constitute a cost-efficient alternative to the cost-intensive<br>
silicon solar cells mostly used at present and which as mono-crystalline<br>
single or multiple layer systems following their manufacture must first be<br>
sawed apart into individual cells and then, in the manner of high-value<br>
semiconductor products, be further processed by complex steps. By<br>
photovoltaic conversion of solar energy into electric power, thin-film solar<br>
cells generate voltage levels of less than 1 Volt. In order to attain technically<br>
useful power at a voltage of typically 12 Volts or 24 Volts, a sufficient number<br>
of individual cells are connected in series. In the case of thin-film solar cells,<br>
the series connection may be integrated into the layer-forming process. This<br>
involves subdividing layers formed as whole surfaces into small strips by<br>
suitable structuring methods, for instance paste-scribing methods and lift-off<br>
techniques as well as mechanical and, more particularly, layer processing<br>
methods. The purpose of the structuring is to create an electrical connection<br>
between the electrodes at the front and rear surfaces of adjacent strip-<br>
shaped solar cells.<br>
From U.S. Patent 4,675,467 there is known a method of series-<br>
connecting an integrated thin-film solar module in which both electrodes are<br>
incorporated in prefabricated strip-form into an unstructured absorber layer.<br>
The conductive connections between the corresponding electrodes of<br>
adjacent solar cells are then formed in a structuring step by laser irradiation<br>
from the transparent substrate surface into an area covered by the electrode<br>
strips. Appropriate areas of the absorber layer are thus converted into low-<br>
ohmic areas by a precisely defined quantity of energy, which does, however,<br>
entail the risk of damaging the semiconductor material. Because of the lack<br>
of spatial structuring of the absorber layer there is no electrical insulation<br>
between the semiconductor material of adjacent solar cells which leads to<br>
power-reducing short circuit currents. The laser treatment requires a highly<br>
precise power level, positioning and focusing of the applied laser beam in<br>
order to yield the desired spatially precise conversion effect. This may lead<br>
to layer separations and damages in the immediate vicinity of the structuring<br>
operation. Furthermore, it is necessary always to use a transparent substrate<br>
of precisely defined homogeneous layer thickness so that the laser beam<br>
may penetrate from the substrate side and that a power-level dependent<br>
depth of penetration into the layers to be separated or transformed may be<br>
precisely set.<br>
A similar process involving prefabricated electrode strips has been<br>
described in U.S. Patent 4,999,308, in which the laser treatment for area<br>
conversion is used at the same time to separate the absorber layer to form<br>
insulation trenches by blowing away semiconductor material which is thus<br>
lost. In this combined process, the energy dosaging poses a problem which<br>
to some extent leads to an uncertainty especially in respect of the conversion<br>
areas, notwithstanding the fact that processing is carried out from the upper<br>
side of the solar cells rather than through the substrate. The use of two<br>
scribing processes for the consecutive separation of absorber layer and front<br>
electrode at different laterally displaced positions is known from(U.S. Patent<br>
5 296.674) The separation is accomplished by indirect laser irradiation<br>
through the protective layer substrate so that the direct connection between<br>
adjacent solar cells is maintained by the absorber layer. This method<br>
requires multiple positioning of a transparent substrate while accepting short<br>
circuit currents.<br>
A method of series connecting an integrated thin-film solar cell module<br>
is known from WO 9503628 in which all functional layers are separately<br>
structured during special process steps. In accordance with the method, a<br>
metal layer previously precipitated as a single layer on a transparent<br>
substrate is separated by any desired structuring method into closely<br>
adjacent strips to form a strip-shaped rear electrode. Following the<br>
subsequent whole-surface coating with a thin semiconductor layer for forming<br>
an absorber layer and with a front layer to form a front electrode, two<br>
additional separate structuring steps are carried out by laser irradiation from<br>
the side of the substrate. The first laser irradiation serves to structure or<br>
pattern the strips of the absorber layer and of the front electrode; the second<br>
laser irradiation serves to convert into a low-ohmic area that portion of the<br>
absorber layer which is positioned in the covered area between opposite<br>
electrode strips of adjacent solar cells, thus forming an integrated conductive<br>
series-connection between the solar cells. Therefore, in the known method<br>
the structuring involves a treble separation treatment. The first treatment<br>
serves to separate the front electrode and the absorber layer. Laser-assisted<br>
removal of the sensitive semiconductor layer always involves the risk of<br>
damage to, or alteration of, the layer. The second treatment for area<br>
conversion again requires a precisely energized laser and includes the<br>
problems described supra.<br>
The described methods are footed on the common task of optimization<br>
in the sense of maximized power output or minimized surface area of the<br>
fabricated solar modules of striped structured thin-film solar cells of either<br>
type of support layers. Compared to monocrystalline solar cells such solar<br>
cells are of low energy efficiency which at lower light conditions is rapidly<br>
further reduced relative to normal conditions (light concentration AM 1.5).<br>
Accordingly, at common deviations of seasonal and day-by-day light<br>
intensities, depending upon the weather and at indoor applications (down to<br>
10% of the maximum available radiation), thin-film solar cells are subject to<br>
significant power losses. This explains the insignificant use of thin-film solar<br>
cells in areas where solar radiation varies significantly and in indoor areas in<br>
general. In connection with monocrystalline solar cells, light collecting<br>
concentrator modules consisting of optical elements to maintain at, or raise<br>
to, an optimum efficiency range the light intensity in respect of<br>
monocrystalline solar cells have become known from many publications.<br>
However, the goal of such known measures is not to maximize power but,<br>
rather, to bring about as significant a reduction as possible of the very<br>
expensive required surface of the solar module.<br>
For instance, (U.S. Patent 5,118,361) discloses a solar module of<br>
monocrystalline tandem solar cells made of GeAs/GaSb which is built into a<br>
housing the cover of which is formed by a concentrator module made up of<br>
individual Fresnel lenses of polymeric material and positioned, together with<br>
light-collecting funnels, in front of individual solar cells. These are disposed<br>
within the module on a flexible connection ribbon of conductive and non-<br>
conductive strips. From (European Patent 0,657,048) there is known an<br>
automated microchip-like connection in a very similar arrangement of<br>
monocrystalline GaAs solar cells aiming at surface minimization.<br>
Concentrator arrangements provided with linear focus Senses in, or as part of,<br>
a module cover which are particularly suitable for strip-like solar modules are<br>
known, for instance, from (U.S. Patent 4,711,972) for monocrystalline silicon<br>
solar cells and from (U.S. Patent 5,505,7897pY monocrystalline integrated<br>
solar cell chips made of GaAs. German Patent specification 197 44 840 A1<br>
discloses a solar module having a forward concentrator module made of<br>
plastic Fresnel lenses which as a structured unit tilts or slides in accordance<br>
with the position of the sun to provide for an improved power balance.<br>
Finally, European Patent 0,328,053 describes strip-like solar modules with a<br>
forward Fresnel lens which are mounted in the corner of a window pane of a<br>
double window and which are to provide the electricity for operating blinds in<br>
the between the windows.<br>
However, neither the mentioned nor any other publication discloses an<br>
application for concentrator modules for amorphous, poly- or micro-crystalline<br>
thin-film solar modules in particular in any kind of arrangement, so that such<br>
modules have hitherto shown a relatively poor power balance which is<br>
strongly dependent on the time of day and on the weather. More particularly,<br>
little or no consideration has been given to optical structuring methods in<br>
connection with applications of known solar modules, including thin-film solar<br>
cells precipitated as large surfaces on glass substrates, which has led to<br>
relatively uniform solar module structures used primarily in the field of<br>
industry. Esthetically patterned solar modules may be found, for instance, in<br>
roof pans (see German Patents 42 279 29 and 43 176 74 or wrist watches<br>
which also may take different colors into consideration (see European Patent<br>
0,895,141).<br>
With reference to the above explanations and proceeding from the<br>
state of the art relating to the method of fabricating a solar module with<br>
structured and integrated series-connected thin-film solar cells which is most<br>
closely related to the inventive method, it is a first object of the present<br>
invention to provide an improved fabrication method of very low complexity as<br>
regards structuring. In this connection, those aspects of the improvement<br>
addressed to the fabrication of substrate and superstrate cells alike are to<br>
relate especially to a simplified method and, at the same time, to a fabrication<br>
process which can be more easily controlled and reproduced. Moreover, it is<br>
an object of the invention to achieve an exceptionally low use of material and<br>
an assured separation of the individual layers at a complete insulation of the<br>
individual solar cells. Based on these consideration, the cost efficiency of the<br>
fabrication method is to be improved. In addition, the basic task of optimizing<br>
a solar module is to be accomplished by suitable forms and measures,<br>
especially in connection with concentrator modules of solar modules<br>
fabricated in accordance with the inventive method, thus leading to a special<br>
flexibility in terms of their applicability.<br>
In the accomplishment of these objects, the invention provides for thin-<br>
film solar cells of the substrate type of claim 1 and for thin-film solar cells of<br>
the superstrate type of auxiliary claim 2. In this connection, the methods of<br>
the two claims substantially correspond to each other, except that the method<br>
of claim 2 is quasi an inverse of the method of claim 1. This may be<br>
explained by the fact that but for their inversed layer sequence substrate and<br>
superstrate solar cells are of the same basic construction. In this connection,<br>
the substrate functions as a bottom support layer, and light impinges on the<br>
solar cell from above, whereas the superstrate functions as a top support<br>
layer, and light impinges through the superstrate. However, in order to<br>
provide for a comprehensible description, the advantages of the invention will<br>
primarily be described on the basis of method of claim 1, particularly since<br>
the advantages also result from the inverse method of claim 2. Following<br>
this, the differences between the two methods will be briefly set forth.<br>
The inventive method according to claim 1 makes possible continuous<br>
structuring of all functional layers at an extremely iow complexity of pattern<br>
formation. By using a mask, particularly one with a striped pattern, two<br>
structuring steps otherwise required are avoided. On the one hand, this<br>
relates to the usual structuring of the rear electrode after application on the<br>
substrate or, in the inverse method, after application of the absorber layer. In<br>
accordance with the invention, the rear electrode is structured directly with a<br>
superposed mask during coating with a corresponding metal layer. This<br>
leads to no loss of material since the mask may be used again. On the other<br>
hand, the method step of the otherwise conventional and particularly critical<br>
subsequent structuring of the semiconductor absorber layer is avoided as<br>
well. This is of particular advantage as problems arising during mechanical<br>
or, more particularly, laser-assisted cutting of the absorber layer are avoided.<br>
Damage to individual layers, imprecise borders between layers and non-<br>
reproducible layer conditions resulting from laser irradiations cannot occur.<br>
In accordance with the method of claim 1, the absorber layer like the<br>
rear electrode is structured by use of the mask. This leads to the integrated<br>
series connection of the individual solar cells by a simple but especially<br>
effective method step. Before application of the absorber layer on the<br>
substrate and mask, the mask is moved slightly in a lateral direction leading<br>
to the formation of narrow upper and lower ribs which after removal of the<br>
mask which are contacted by the front layer subsequently applied as an<br>
uninterrupted surface, the front layer being the front electrode. In the area of<br>
the lower ribs the rear electrode sections at one side are completely enclosed<br>
by the application of the absorber layer. Interruption of the absorber layer<br>
between the individual solar cells is achieved by the mask which is covered<br>
as well so that no short circuit currents can occur. A void in the absorber<br>
layer above the rear electrode sections on its other side is achieved in the<br>
area of the upper ribs and serves for subsequent contacting by the front<br>
electrode. Covering the mask at the same time again leads to no loss of<br>
material, at the same time the mask too is completely processed up to the<br>
absorber layer. After removal of the mask and application of the transparent<br>
conductive front layer as an uninterrupted surface the method in accordance<br>
with the invention requires only a single subsequent structuring step by<br>
mechanical or laser assisted processes. At an interface which includes the<br>
upper ribs and a portion of any abutting solar cell, the front layer is simply<br>
separated down to the rear electrode at such a separation width as to form a<br>
correspondingly structured front electrode without short circuits between<br>
individual solar cells. Difficult conversion processes in the absorber layer for<br>
forming conductive ribs are avoided. The location of the interfaces is not<br>
particularly critical as they need be positioned laterally displaced only in the<br>
area of the upper ribs or in the direction of the abutting solar cell. As regards<br>
the position of the interfaces it is important to prevent short circuits between<br>
the rear and front electrodes. When cutting in the area of the active solar cell<br>
this is can be ensured.<br>
The method of claim 1 of fabricating substrate solar cells in principle<br>
corresponds to the method of claim 2 of fabricating superstate solar cells<br>
with the exception that the method steps have to be carried out in reverse<br>
sequence. However, since the in the case of superstrate cells the<br>
transparent conductive front layer for the front electrode on the superstrate is<br>
mechanically not as sturdy as the metal layer for forming the rear electrode<br>
on the substrate of substrate cells, the mechanical separation step of<br>
structuring the front electrode cannot be carried out in the same manner (in<br>
this case the scribing would penetrate down to the superstrate). Therefore, in<br>
the case of the method of claim 2 the entire transparent superstrate is first<br>
covered with a conductive front layer. After the mask has been fixed,<br>
structuring is carried out by scribing along the filled surface of the mask in a<br>
manner similar to using a ruler so that the mask with one of its lateral margins<br>
is positioned directly adjacent to the structuring trenches. Thereafter, the<br>
absorber layer is applied and the structuring trenches are also filled with<br>
absorber material. Lateral sliding the mask again results in the formation of<br>
corresponding upper and lower ribs. Following application of the metal layer<br>
for structuring the rear electrode which may also be structured as p-TLO, the<br>
mask which by now is also covered by a complete solar cell structure is finally<br>
removed. Therefore, the main difference from the method sequence of claim<br>
1 resides in the advanced structuring step and the later removal of the mask.<br>
An important aspect of the inventive fabrication method resides in the<br>
designing of the mask. Whereas hitherto series-connected solar cells have<br>
been structured continuously in stripes without alterations, the invention<br>
makes it possible to introduce different designs. Almost any geometric<br>
structure, for instance zig-zag or undulating patterns as well as signatures or<br>
company logos, may be practiced by adherence to two simple marginal<br>
conditions. These are, on the one hand, the basic character of the structure<br>
which must be composed of individual smaller partial surfaces. Such<br>
"digitizing" of analog structures does not, however, limit the optical function,<br>
as from a certain distance it is no longer visually distinguishable if it is not a<br>
deliberately applied element of the geometric pattern. When segregating the<br>
structure into small partial surfaces their size, as the second condition, must<br>
be calculated such that any blank surfaces and, if applicable, any filled<br>
surfaces in the geometric pattern must be of approximately the same size. In<br>
this manner, any current irregularities are avoided which would occur in case<br>
of partial surfaces of different sizes. Uniformity of the filled surfaces is always<br>
required whenever -as set forth infra- the mask, too, is to be further<br>
processed into a complete solar cell. However, the size of the filled surfaces<br>
may be different from that of the blank surfaces. The second marginal<br>
condition does not pose any significant problem in its realization as it may<br>
simply be incorporated into the arrangement of the solar module.<br>
The possibility of providing a relatively unrestricted design for the<br>
mask required for the fabrication method makes it possible to integrate a<br>
completely novel aspect into the application of solar modules fabricated in<br>
accordance with the invention. Because of their function, the solar modules<br>
are usually arranged in the visual range at any rate. It is now possible to<br>
utilize solar modules fabricated in accordance with the invention as esthetic<br>
design elements for walls of buildings and as advertising media, thus<br>
significantly increasing their usefulness. Normally, the geometric pattern<br>
would consist of rectangular and straight-line narrow stripes. In order to keep<br>
them together within the mask, the mask may at its margins be provided with<br>
connecting ribs. During the application of individual layers for fabricating the<br>
solar module, the connecting ribs may be arranged outside of any given<br>
support layer. If for reasons of geometry this is not possible or where the<br>
geometric pattern requires connecting ribs in its interior, particularly to<br>
achieve sufficient mechanical sturdiness, such ribs would during the process<br>
sequence initially form jumpers. Depending upon the complexity of the<br>
geometric pattern it is thus useful, in accordance with an improvement of the<br>
inventive method, to provide for an additional method step following method<br>
steps (1.8) or (2.8): (A) Structuring short circuit areas in the front layer<br>
generated by connecting ribs in more complex geometric patterns.<br>
The individual layers may be provided by generally known methods,<br>
such as, for example, vapor deposition or sputtering. The composition of the<br>
required layer package for a solar module in thin-film technology fabricated in<br>
accordance with the invention arising is a function of the materials used and<br>
of the applications. More particularly, prior to applying the rear or front<br>
electrode in method step (1.2) or (2.1) the following additional method step<br>
may optimally be provided in a further advance of the invention: (B)<br>
Application of a barrier layer for forming a diffusion barrier. This may be a Cr<br>
layer which prevents an interdiffusion, for instance, of Na. Furthermore,<br>
following application of the metal layer (1.3) or following structuring of the<br>
front layer (2.4) the following additional method step may be optimally<br>
provided: (C) Application of an adhesion and/or source layer for forming an<br>
adhesive agent. For instance, this may be a Na-source layer (NaF) and/or an<br>
adhesion-assist layer of, for instance, ZnSe or ZnS. Finally, another method<br>
step may be optimally introduced between the absorber forming coating and<br>
the application of the front layer, i.e. prior to method step (1.6) or (2.5): (D)<br>
Applying at least one buffer layer for forming a space-charge zone. This<br>
layer may consist, for instance, of CdS or of ZnS.<br>
Depending upon the future application of the finished solar module, an<br>
application of transparent materials for forming the substrate or superstrate<br>
layers and/or the metal layer may be provided for as a further advance of the<br>
method in accordance with the invention. This would yield a special<br>
applicability for windows and semi-transparent areas and would take<br>
advantage of the fact that large-surface glass panes make are usually used<br>
at any rate as substrates or superstates for thin-film solar cells. The material<br>
for forming the transparent metal layer may, for instance, be ZnO, SnO or ITO<br>
(indium tin oxide), which in addition to other layers of different doping may<br>
also be used for forming the transparent conductive front layer (TLO). By<br>
contrast, non-transparent metall layers may consist, for instance, of<br>
molybdenum, wolfram (tungsten) or of another metal. Finally, for forming the<br>
absorber layer, which also is non-transparent, a further advance of the<br>
method in accordance with the invention may provide, depending upon the<br>
support layer, for the use of amorphous, poly- or monocrystalline silicon,<br>
polycrystalline CdTe or chalcopyrite compounds of the general formula<br>
AgxCu1-xInyGa1-ySzSe2-z-wTew as the semiconductor material, wherein x and y<br>
may assume values between 0 and 1, and z and w may assume values<br>
between 0 and 2 such that the sum of w + z does not substantially exceed 2.<br>
The mask may consist of different materials which provide for the requisite<br>
mechanical sturdiness. For forming substrate cells the mask may be made<br>
as a metal mask. In principle, the mask need not be transparent as it will be<br>
covered by the non-transparent absorber layer. A transparent but not<br>
necessarily metallic mask may be.used for fabricating superstrate cells if a<br>
separate use of the mask is intended as a positive. However, before<br>
releasably fixing such a mask, which may consist, for instance, of glass or<br>
transparent plastic resistant to the method, on the superstrate, it must first be<br>
prov at its upper surface with a transparent front electrode (TLO). Such<br>
coating may, for instance, be carried out in a manner similar to the coating for<br>
forming the rear electrode of substrate cells.<br>
The essential improvement and simplification of the method are<br>
accomplished by the method in accordance with the invention by the use of<br>
the mask which may be structured in accordance with predetermined wishes<br>
and marginal conditions. This allows elimination of a number of structuring<br>
processes as separate method steps. In particular, the lateral shifting of the<br>
mask eliminates two otherwise necessary scribing steps. The measure of<br>
lateral shift is a spacer for covering from below the section of the electrode at<br>
the one side to provide access for the next coating, and for covering from<br>
above at the other side to provide a void from the next coating. The size of<br>
the covers from, below and from above relates to the overall dimensions of<br>
the structured solar cells and is to ensure an assured cover on the one hand<br>
and an assured separation on the other side. In accordance with a further<br>
advance of the method is it thus advantageous laterally to shift the mask by<br>
about .1 mm. Technically it is simple to execute and ensure such shifting,<br>
and it does not require any in the setup of the method between individual<br>
method steps.<br>
In the method according to the invention the mask assumes a<br>
significant role at different aspects. Its direct coprocessing leads to no losses<br>
in material. It is useful repeatedly to reuse masks, particularly those of<br>
complex geometric structures and, therefore, higher costs, without<br>
intermediate reprocessing. Layers of insignificant material deposits applied<br>
during prior method cycles do not interfere. When, in the end, a mask is not<br>
used anymore, the applied material may be recycled which is of particular<br>
importance in large scale productions. In addition to these and those<br>
advantages described supra the mask has the further inherent advantage<br>
that it may be used as a positive for its own configuration, separate from the<br>
large-surface solar module which is configured quasi as a negative of the<br>
form of the mask. For that reason, in accordance with a further advance of<br>
the method in accordance with the invention it is of overall advantage<br>
repeatedly to use the mask or further to process a removed mask the filled<br>
surfaces of which must then be configured to have uniform surfaces. This<br>
does not result in another method sequence; processing on the substrate or<br>
superstrate and the mask continue identically. Since the mask may also be<br>
used no material is lost at any step in the method and the relatively expensive<br>
material are optimally used. Furthermore, the usability supports esthetic<br>
considerations in which the geometric structures, in particular company logos,<br>
may also be used as a positive. With structures of lesser complexity, the<br>
mask may yield individual solar cells of simple geometry which by simple<br>
series connections may be combined to solar modules (see infra). However,<br>
in accordance with a further advance of the invention, care must be taken<br>
when defining the geometry that it provides for an esthetically and/or<br>
informally oriented geometric pattern of individual solar cells adhering to<br>
partial patterns of identical surface size in its blank surface and/or in its filled<br>
surfaces. In this manner, the solar cells on the negative as well as the solar<br>
cells on the positive each contribute an identical current thus avoiding the<br>
occurrence of current irregularities. It is not necessary that the surfaces of<br>
the filled surfaces and of the blank surfaces be identical. In accordance with<br>
a further aspect of the invention, additional design aspects may be realized<br>
by partial patters of different colors whereby the selected colors must be such<br>
that they can be integrated into the photovoltaic process.<br>
In addition to esthetic considerations in solar modules fabricated in<br>
accordance with the invention, the optimizing aspects regarding power<br>
maximizing or surface minimizing referred to supra have to be taken into<br>
consideration. In an embodiment of the solar module fabricated in<br>
accordance with the invention, it is particularly advantageous in support layer<br>
types to provide a light-collecting concentrator module consisting of individual<br>
concentrators as image-forming or non-image-forming optical elements the<br>
arrangement of which matches the arrangement of the individual solar cells.<br>
The use of concentrators makes possible a significant increase of the<br>
average and total energy conversion efficiency of a solar module. The optical<br>
elements may, for instance, be lenses of conventional semi-convex or<br>
Fresnel-like configuration. In accordance with a further embodiment the solar<br>
module may at its light-impinging surface be encapsulated by a transparent<br>
glass or plastic material with or without transparent cover pane and the<br>
concentrators are integrated in the glass or plastic or are applied to or ground<br>
into the interior surface of the cover pane. In particular, the application may<br>
be an adhesive one. Structuring of the exterior surface is disadvantageous,<br>
however, as it complicates cleaning and the effect of weather and dirt may<br>
adversely affect the collecting action of the concentrators. Preferably, the<br>
concentrators used may have a geometric concentration factor of Cg which<br>
lies within a numerical range between 1 and 10. Such concentrator modules<br>
are in principle well known and have been described in detail supra in<br>
connection with the state of the art. But in connection with solar modules<br>
made in accordance with the inventive method several interesting<br>
combinations are possible. For instance, in accordance with a further<br>
embodiment of the invention, the concentrator may be arranged at a distance<br>
from the solar module of solar cells structured as laterally straight lines in the<br>
manner of a Venetian blind, the individual slats of which are constituted by<br>
linear concentrator lenses which may be arranged to track the position of the<br>
sun. Such arrangements are particularly suitable for mounting in a window,<br>
particularly those exposed to strong sunlight. Since the solar module itself<br>
may be made to be semi-transparent it may thus contribute to shadowing an<br>
interior room. An advantageous embodiment of the solar blind may be<br>
characterized by the fact that each concentrator lens is suspended at each<br>
end by two supports linked to two guide rails which extend in guide slots fixed<br>
relative to the solar module in mounting blocks and may be adjusted simply<br>
by pressing movable wedge blocks. Thus all lenses may be adjusted in<br>
common. Furthermore, the concentrator lenses follow a path such that at<br>
different light exposures their correct adjustment relative to the solar cells is<br>
ensured.<br>
In connection with the use of the mask as its own solar cell support<br>
another embodiment of the invention may provide for a solar module formed<br>
from the mask and for series connecting the electrodes of the individual solar<br>
cells by way of an integrated metallized contact ribbon. In such an<br>
arrangement, the contact ribbon may be structured as a transparent flexible<br>
contact foil the width of which corresponds to the entire width of the solar<br>
module. In addition, the solar module may be slidably mounted by lateral<br>
winding and unwinding of the contact foil extending beyond the solar module,<br>
in front of or behind (depending upon the type of solar cell) a further<br>
structured and integrated series-connected solar module which is mounted<br>
stationary. Depending upon the individual solar modules relative to each<br>
other a selection may be made between maximum light transmissivity and<br>
maximum current production. Such measures result in a partially transparent<br>
solar module with variable shadowing which may be structured according to<br>
esthetic considerations. Overall, by an optimum combination of esthetic and<br>
functional structural elements, a solar module fabricated by the method of the<br>
invention and modified optimally relative to its power output may arranged by<br>
itself or in common with other solar modules in front of or within windows, wall<br>
and roof elements of a building, or in the interior thereof. The degrees of<br>
transparency of the solar modules used may be matched with those of the<br>
building surfaces, and they may be changeable, for instance, fully transparent<br>
in front of windows disposed in the shade and in front structural elements<br>
made of glass, semi-transparent in front of windows exposed to the sun, and<br>
non-transparent in front of building walls, in roof areas and when used as sun<br>
screens. When used as semi-transparent solar modules, the surface to be<br>
covered by the solar cells may be significantly reduced by an application of<br>
concentrators. This leads to greater flexibility for architectural designs. The<br>
small distance between the solar and concentrator modules makes possible<br>
the manufacture of ready-to-use inserts used in the construction of buildings<br>
without requiring a significant increase in the space used for conventional<br>
solar modules. Completely new fields of application are being opened up<br>
which should make the use of solar modules -even within building- much<br>
more attractive. In order to avoid repetitions regarding the mentioned<br>
modifications reference may be had to the following specific description for<br>
further details.<br>

modules.<br>
In Figure 1 the method in accordance with the invention is depicted on<br>
the basis of selected states of fabrication of an embodiment of a solar module<br>
to be fabricated shown in cross section. A thin-film mask 100 corresponding<br>
to the desired geometry and adhering to the predetermined marginal<br>
conditions is fabricated in a first method step 1.1. The embodiment shown is<br>
one of comb-like geometry having filled surfaces 101 and blank surfaces 102<br>
of identical size. Connecting ribs 103 in the geometric pattern lie outside of<br>
the solar cell structure to be fabricated and are not given further<br>
consideration. In a method step 1.2 the mask 100 is releasably fixed on a<br>
transparent substrate layer 104 of glass. In a next method step 1.3 a metal<br>
layer 105 is applied to the substrate layer 104 and the fixed mask 100. This<br>
leads to the formation on the substrate layer 104 of a rear electrode 106<br>
structured in stripes shaped like the blank spaces 102 in the geometric<br>
pattern of the mask 100. In method step 1.3 a metal layer 105 is also<br>
deposited on the filled surfaces 105. In the following method step 1.4 the<br>
mask 100 is laterally shifted, for instance by about .1 mm, across the striped<br>
rear electrode 106 in the direction of the arrow. At this point it is to be<br>
mentioned that for the sake of a clear presentation the dimensions have been<br>
shown in distorted fashion. The lateral shifting leads to the formation of<br>
narrow lower cover ribs 107 and narrow upper cover ribs 108.<br>
A photovoltaically active thin semiconductor layer 109, for instance of<br>
the chalco-pyrite compound CulnS2 is deposited in a next method step 1.5 on<br>
the substrate 104 and the laterally shifted mask 100. This leads to the<br>
formation of a structured absorber layer 110 over the mask 100 which also<br>
covers the lower cover rib 107; but it does not cover the upper cover rib 108.<br>
In this manner the striped rear electrode 106 in the area of the lower cover rib<br>
107 becomes encased by the semiconductor layer 109 while remaining<br>
exposed in the area of the upper cover rib 108. The mask 100 is released<br>
and removed in method step 1.6. Thereafter, it may be processed further<br>
separately but in parallel into a "positive solar module" and differs from the<br>
"negative solar module" only by the absence of the substrate layer 104 which<br>
is, however, mechanically replaced by the mask 100. A transparent<br>
conductive front layer 111 which forms the front electrode 112 is applied in<br>
the following method step 1.7 on the substrate 104 in the area now vacated<br>
by the removal of the mask 100 and in the area of the upper cover rib 108 on<br>
the rear electrode 100 as well as, but separate therefrom, on the removed<br>
mask 100. In this manner, the separated mask 100 is fully processed and<br>
initially forms an unconnected solar module 113 of individual thin-film solar<br>
cells 114 in the form of the filled surfaces 101 of the geometric pattern without<br>
the connecting ribs thereof. The solar module 113 may then be finishes<br>
(analogously in Figures 3 and 5) by subsequent suitable connection<br>
processes which may be carried out with relative ease and in integrated<br>
manner because of the lacking substrate layer 104 and the downwardly<br>
exposed metal layer 105. In the inserted state light impinges on the substrate<br>
104 in the direction of the arrow.<br>
On the "negative" solar module 115 the front electrode 112 is initially<br>
unstructured and electrically short circuits all solar cells 116. Therefore, in an<br>
ensuing method step 1.8 the front layer 111 is thus opened in areas 119 of<br>
separation of the upper cover ribs 108 down to the striped rear electrode 106<br>
by a suitable scribing process, for instance by a laser beam by gaps 117<br>
which eliminate the short circuits. Generally the rear electrode 106 adheres<br>
more firmly to the substrate layer 104 than does the absorber layer 109.<br>
Thus, the solar cells 116 are electrically series connected in an integrated<br>
manner with the individual absorber layer strips 118 remaining electrically<br>
insulated. The solar module is thus finished and ready for use.<br>
The inventive method of fabricating superstate cells is analogously<br>
shown in Figure 2. In a first method step 2.1 a thin mask 150 is again<br>
provided in accordance with a predetermined geometric pattern. If<br>
subsequent reuse of the mask is planned as a proper solar module, it is made<br>
of a transparent material and on its upper surface it is provided with a<br>
separately applied front electrode which has not been shown in the figure. In<br>
an ensuing method step 2.2 a transparent conductive front layer 152 for<br>
forming a front electrode 153 is applied on a substrate 151. In the<br>
embodiment selected the front electrode 153 consists of a plurality of SnO<br>
layers of different doping (ITO or ZnO are possible). Thereafter, the mask<br>
150 is releasably fixed on the front layer 152 (method step 2.3). Thereafter,<br>
in method step 2.4 the scribing of the front layer 152 is performed along the<br>
outer margins of the mask 150 functioning as mechanical or optical rulers, in<br>
order to structure the front electrode 153. In a next method step 2.5 a<br>
semiconductor layer 154 is applied for forming an absorber layer 155<br>
structured in correspondence with the geometry of the mask. In the manner<br>
of the method described supra, the mask 150 is then, in method step 2.6<br>
laterally shifted by a small distance of about .1 mm. Thus, upper cover ribs<br>
156 and lower cover ribs 157 are formed. In the ensuing method step 2.7<br>
these are covered, exactly like the scribed structuring trenches 158, by a<br>
metal layer 159 for structuring a rear electrode 160. In a last method step 2.8<br>
the mask 150 is removed. The solar module is finished with a corresponding<br>
structuring and integrated series connection between individual thin-film solar<br>
cells 162. In an inserted state light impinges through the superstrate 151 in<br>
the direction of the arrow.<br>
Following the description of the two analogous methods of fabricating<br>
substrate and superstrate cells, solar modules fabricated by the method are<br>
to be described hereinafter in greater detail in connection with the use of<br>
concentrator modules. This will always be based on the substrate cell type.<br>
It is, however, expressly to be mention at this point that all embodiments may<br>
also be executed on the basis of superstrate cells after appropriate<br>
conventional technical adjustment.<br>
Figure 3 (the meaning of reference numerals not explained here and in<br>
the following figures may be taken from figure 1 or any preceding figure)<br>
depicts a solar module 200 fabricated by the inventive method, in a partially<br>
transparent embodiment with laterally structured solar cells 2001 on a<br>
transparent substrate 202 and a light-collecting concentrator module 203 as<br>
integrated light concentration. Such a solar module 200 may be used, for<br>
instance, as a window or as an element of demanding architectural fagades.<br>
!n the selected embodiment, an enclosure which required by every standard<br>
thin-film solar module in order to be protected from weather conditions, is<br>
realized by a housing 204 which also serves to divert the generated current,<br>
and by a glass plate 205 behind which is provided a transparent plastic 206<br>
(e.g. epoxy or artificial resin) for filling the intermediate space. The<br>
concentrator module 203 is arranged at the interior surface 207 of the glass<br>
plate 205 and is provided with individual concentrators 208 which in their<br>
arrangement are matched to the arrangement of the individual solar cells<br>
201. In the selected embodiment they are strip-like semi-convex lenses<br>
adhesively attached to the interior side of the glass plate 205. Reference<br>
should be had to figure 6 for an explanation of the effect of the concentrators.<br>
Figure 4 depicts an embodiment of a partially transparent solar module<br>
300 with solar cells 301 structured as straight lines on a transparent substrate<br>
302 and provided with a concentrator module 303 structured as a solar<br>
Venetian blind including tracking linearly focusing concentrator lenses 304.<br>
The solar cells 301 are arranged behind the separately suspended blind-like<br>
concentrator module 303. This consists of as many lamellate linearly<br>
focusing concentrator lenses 304 as there are strip-like solar cells 301 within<br>
the solar module 300. Each concentrator lens 304 is attached at its two ends<br>
by way of two shanked suspension points 305 to two guide bars 306 which in<br>
turn extend through guide slots 307 in mounting blocks 308. The position of<br>
the mounting blocks 308 is stationary with respect to the solar module 300 so<br>
that an individual adjustment of the concentrator lenses 304 is avoided. The<br>
guide bars 306 are adjusted in the guide slots 307 by simple pressure of<br>
movable wedge blocks 309. In this manner the concentrator lenses 304<br>
follow a path which ensure an appropriate adjustment relative to the solar<br>
cells 301 at different incidents of light. The incident of light has been<br>
indicated by dash-dotted lines for two different angles of incident in the upper<br>
(a) and in the lower portion (b) of figure 4. It is to be noted, firstly, that this<br>
kind of light concentration is particularly suitable for superstate cells in which<br>
the integration of the concentration into the solar module encounters<br>
difficulties and, secondly, that both the angle of inclination of the concentrator<br>
lenses 304 and the position of their center of gravity are tracked correctly.<br>
The positioning signal for the tracking may be obtained in a simple manner<br>
from the current output of the solar cells 301. In the present embodiment the<br>
shape of the lateral pattern of the solar cells 301 has to be a straight-line one<br>
so that proper irradiation by the concentrator lenses 304 may be ensured. It<br>
is possible, however, depending upon the desired geometric concentration<br>
ratio to select a mark space ratio between solar cell and free space different<br>
from 2:1.<br>
Figure 5 depicts a partially transparent laterally structured combination<br>
solar module 400 with variable shadowing, in a planar view at (a) and cross-<br>
section at (b). The combination solar module 400 consists of a stationary<br>
solar module 401 constructed of rigid solar cells 402 on a transparent<br>
substrate 403 and, arranged above the stationary solar module 401, of<br>
movable solar module 404 realized on a striped mask 405. Solar cells 406<br>
prepared on the mask 405 are electrically series-connected to each other by<br>
a flexible transparent contact foil 407 between the front and back sides of the<br>
striped solar cells 406. The surface of the contact foil 407 is metallized by a<br>
transparent conductive oxide. Thus, the contact foil 407 may be spread over<br>
the entire width of a window, thus resulting, on the one hand, in a low series<br>
resistance loss and, on the other hand, in increased mechanical sturdiness of<br>
the flexible solar module 404. Each end of the connecting contact foil 407 is<br>
wrapped over a cylindrical body 408 which also serves as outward electrical<br>
feed. The cylindrical body 408 is suspended in a frame element 409 and may<br>
be rotated from the exterior so that the flexible solar module 404 may be<br>
moved laterally. In this manner, the stationary solar module 401 on the glass<br>
substrate 403 may be selectively shaded, rendering the window semi-<br>
transparent at low current generation. Otherwise, the spatially variable solar<br>
cells 406 are positioned between the rigid solar cells 402 of the stationary<br>
solar module 401 which renders the windows totally opaque and current<br>
generation is maximized. In a variation of this embodiment it would not be<br>
necessary to structure the solar cells 402, 406 as straight-line stripes; rather,<br>
they may also be structured according to esthetic aspects as long as their<br>
surfaces satisfy the general marginal conditions and, for such application, are<br>
congruent as well. At this point it must also be mentioned that if superstrate<br>
cells were used the movable solar cells would have to be placed beneath the<br>
stationary solar cells.<br>
Since the distance between the concentrators and the solar cells in the<br>
selected embodiments is relatively small, the concentrators will provide for<br>
low light concentration only, which in thin-film solar cells nevertheless results<br>
in a significant improvement of the average efficiency. Figure 6 depicts a<br>
typical measuring curve of the efficiency of a chalco-pyrite solar cell as a<br>
function of light concentration from which three characteristic facts may be<br>
derived:<br>
1. The average spectral irradiation energy at noon on a summer day<br>
is internationally approached by the AM 1.5 global spectrum according to IEC<br>
norm 904-3 (1989) .to be mentioned at this point. An our latitude, light<br>
conditions are prevailing in which the light intensity may vary by as much as<br>
factor 10 between summer and winter on the one hand and as a result of<br>
variable cloudiness on the other hand. Hence, in its operation the solar cell<br>
is subjected to an irradiation energy of about 10% - 100% of the energy which<br>
in accordance with AM 1.5 is to be expected globally.<br>
2. The energy efficiency relating to the irradiation intensity is varying<br>
such that an operation at low irradiation levels is not favorable. Thus, in the<br>
solar cell shown in figure 5 an efficiency of ? = 9.2% at an irradiation of AM<br>
1.5 global (C = 1); however, at 10% of that irradiation (C = .1) the energy<br>
efficiency is only ? = 6.5%. The optimum efficiency of this solar cell, ? =<br>
9.5%, is reached only at a concentration of C = 2 - 3.<br>
3. By using light concentrators of low geometric concentration factors<br>
Cg the irradiation level to be expected during operation is shifted into a range<br>
favorable to thin-film solar cells. Figure 6 depicts three possible<br>
concentration factors Cg = 1, 3, 6, and it becomes apparent that at a light<br>
incidence of 10% -100% of the standard sun AM 1.5 global, the average<br>
efficiency of this typical solar cell remains in excess of ? = 8.8%, i.e. above<br>
90% of the efficiency of 9.7% which may be achieved with this cell, at a six-<br>
fold light concentration of Cg = 6. A shift of the maximum to higher<br>
concentrations may be expected at an increased optimization of the<br>
properties of the solar cell (lowering of the series resistance).<br>
Overall, the use of concentrators of a geometric concentration factor<br>
Cg in a numeric range between 1 and 10 is favorable. In most cases, a<br>
geometric concentration Cg = 6 is entirely sufficient to ensure an optimum<br>
efficiency. This low value renders the use of cost-efficient plastic Fresnel<br>
lenses in combination with chalco-pyrite cells particularly interesting. In such<br>
an arrangement, a solar cell typically measuring from between .5 - 5.0 cm2<br>
rather than being placed precisely into the focal point of the Fresnel lens, is<br>
placed about .5 cm ahead of it thus rendering the illumination of solar cell<br>
homogeneous. Further measures to increase the concentration such as, for<br>
instance, expensive secondary concentrators of the kind necessary for Si or<br>
GaAs cells are not necessary for amorphous and poly or microcrystalline<br>
solar cells.<br>

Known methods of producing large-surface integrated thin-film solar modules<br>
with an amorphous, poly- or microcrystalline absorber layer always comprise<br>
division and conversion structuring processes which can cause instabilities in<br>
the structuring and which are relatively expensive. According to the inventive<br>
method which can be used to fabricate substrate solar cells (116) and<br>
superstrate solar cells, the mask (100) which is used provides for structuring<br>
itself during the deposition of layers for the tear electrode (106) and the<br>
absorber layer (11) through its geometrical form. The use of a mask (110)<br>
which can be reused as an independent element after use in this method<br>
allows for a relatively free range of possible geometric forms. This also<br>
makes possible applications inside and outside of buildings, including in the<br>
area of a window, from an esthetic and informal point of view. These types of<br>
application are also supported by the possibility of a structural connection<br>
between the solar modules produced according to the inventive method and<br>
light-collecting concentrator modules, in order considerably to increase their<br>
average and total energy conversion efficiency.</td>
