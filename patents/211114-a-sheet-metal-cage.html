THE PATENTS ACT 1970<br>
[39 OF 1970]<br>
&amp;<br>
THE PATENTS RULES, 2003 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13] A SHEET-METAL CAGE<br>
FAG  INDUSTRIAL BEARING AG,  of Georg-Schafer-Strasse  30,  D  97421 Schweinfurt, Germany,<br>
The  following  specification  particularly describes the  invention  and  the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a sheet-metal cage.<br><br>
The invention relates to a sheer-metal cage for a rolling-contact bearing and particularly to fastening cage segment ends together.<br>
A sheet-metal cage, like all cages of rolling-contact bearings, guides the rolling bodies iv. their motion relative to the inner and outer bearing rings and holds the rolling bodies spaced at a distance tram on? another around the bearing. To optimize the production costs ofa sheet-metal cage, it is recommended to produce the sheet-metal cage, for example, firompunched-out material strips or segments which ar? bent in a circular shape and which have their segment ends connected.<br>
Various connections for the ends of cage segments are shown in DE 8008271 Ul. These connections include screws and other connecting parts. These are awkward to handle and are suitable for use only for solid cages.  "<br>
clamps which hold the cage segments together are also described. The clamps  be fitted, by naod, and they also have the problem that they have to absorb the entire centrifugal force of the cage segments. At high rotary speeds, these U-shapcd holding clamps may separate from the cage.<br>
Summary of the_Invcnrion<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a sheet-metal cage from individual cage segments and to secure the segments via cost-effective elements.<br>
At least one and possibly two or more cage segments are joined by their opposite cage segment ends. There is a locking connection between the ends, e.g. 3<br><br><br>
d^etail, which holds them cxrcumferentially and a preferably plastic material locking element that passes through an opening through one of the closure parts at a segment end to integrally form the locking element.<br>
An advantage of the invention is that the sheet-metal cage can be produced from sheet-metal strips and therefore circular waste blanks do not occur. after the sheet-metal cage or the sheet-metal cage segments have been punched out and bent into a circular shape, closure parts are interlocked in a positive maimer at the joint between cage segment ends. A preferred connection is dovetailed.<br>
The region around the closure parts is fixed by molding on of a plastic locking element, so that the two cage ends can no longer be displaced radially relative to one another. The locking element is molded on simultaneously from radially outside and inside the closure pans. The plastic is connected through an opening in the region of the closure parts to form one part.<br>
The remaining gap in the region of the closure parts at the joint between the cage ends, which gap results from production tolerances, is likewise closed with the molded-oa plastic. As a result, forces which act in the region of the cage in the circumferential direction are absorbed by the closure parts, interlocked in a positive manner, at the joint between the cage ends. The locking element therefore does not need to absorb these forces.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawing   -<br>
Figure I is a perspective view showing a sheet-metal cage for a cylindrical roller bearing after a circular bending of the cage but without showing locking elements.<br>
Figure 2 shows a sheet-motal cage for a cylindrical roller bearing, comprised of two cage segments, after circular bending of the cage segments and again without showing locking elements.<br><br>
Figure 3 shows a sheet-metal cage for a cylindrical roller bearing, comprised of two cage segments, after circular bending of the segments and having two locldng elements.<br>
Figure 4 shows a sheet-metal cage for a cylindrical roller bearing, having a<br>
5	locking element and holding projections directed inward in the web region.<br>
Figure 5 shows a cage as in Figure 4, wherein the holding projections are directed outward.<br>
Figure 6 shows a sheet-metal cage bent into a circular shape for a deep<br>
groove ball bearing, and without locking elements.<br>
10	Figure 7 shows a cage as in Figure 6 with a locking element disposed at the<br>
joint between cage ends and with holding projections in the web region.<br>
Figure 8 shows an angular-contact-ball-bsaring cage bent info a circular shape and having two closure elements at the joint, without locking elements.<br>
Detailed Description of Preferred, Embodiments<br>
L5	Figure 1 shows a sheet-metal cage I whichhas been bent into a circular shape<br>
for use in a cylindrical roller bearing and shown before the molding-on of the locking element and the holding projections. An interlocking dovetail shaped closure 4 at the joint is depicted. A locking element 6 (shown in Figure 3) is connected in an integral manner bypassing through the opening 5 in the region of the interlocking closure 4<br>
10	during molding-on of a plastic compound on both sides. As a result, this positive-<br>
locking connection in the circumferential direction is secured against radial displacement. Holding projections 9 (shown in Figure 4), which are likewise molded on at the same time on both sides (like the locking elements), are connected in an integral manner by passing through the openings 8 in the webs 11 which pass<br>
:5	between roller openings around the cage.<br>
M<br><br>
Figure 2 shows a sheet-metal cage like that in Figure 1, but this sheet-metal cage is produced from two cage segments.<br>
Figure 3 shows a sheet-metal cage as in Figure 2 on which the locking elements 6 are molded. Radial displacement of the joints 10 is thus also prevented. In addition, rhe holding projections 7, which hold the bearing rollers (not shows), are also attached to the locking clement 6.<br>
A sheet-metal cage like that in Figure 1 is also shown in Figure 4. The single cage end locking element 6 and the holding projections 9 for the rollers (not shown) are molded on this sheet-metal cage. The holding projection 7 on the locking element 6 cannot be seen in this perspective. The holding projections 9 project radially inward of the cage.<br>
A sheet-metal cage according to Figure 3 is also shown in Figure 5. In this embodiment, the holding projections 9 project radially outward. The holding projections 7 on the locking element 6 can be seen in this perspective. Again, the rollers are not shown.<br>
A sheet-metal cage 2 for a deep-groove ball bearing is shown in Figure 6. This cage has been bent into a circular shape after its profile has been punched out. The interlocking closure 4 between cage ends is shown before its encapsulation with a plastic material. A locking element 6" (see Figure 7) is connected in an integral manner through the opening 5 in the interlocking closure 4 during the molding-on of the plastic compound on both sides. The cage is fixed at the joint 10 by the locking clement 6". The holding projections 9" (Figure 7) are connected in an integral manner by passing through the openings S in the webs 11 during the molding-on of the plastic compound on both sides.<br>
A sheet-metal cage as in Figure 6 is shown in Figure 7. The locking elements 6r with the holding projections T are shown on this cage. The holding projections 9" axe molded in place on the webs 11 between the ball sockets around the cage.<br><br><br>
A sheet-metal cage 3 for an angular-contact ball bearing is shown in Figure 8.<br>
The interlocking closure 4 at the joint is shown before the molding-on of the<br>
connecting element. In this case, there are two closures 4 spaced apart across the<br>
bearing,<br>
5	Although the present invention has been described in relation to particular<br>
embodiments thereo£ many other variations and modifications and other uses will become apparent to those skilled in the art. It is preferred, therefore, that the present invention be limited not by the specific disclosure herein, but only by the appended claims-<br><br><br>
