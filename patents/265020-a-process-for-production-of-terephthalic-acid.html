				<td>OPTIMIZED PRODUCTION OF AROMATIC DICARBOXYLIC ACIDS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to the production of aromatic dicarboxylic acids, such as terephthalic acid (TPA). One aspect of the invention concerns a process and apparatus for more efficiently and/or effectively purifying crude aromatic dicarboxylic acids, such as crude terephthalic acid (CTA). Another aspect of the invention concerns a more economical system for producing purified aromatic dicarboxylic acids, such as purified terephthalic acid (PTA).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Terephthalic acid (TPA) is one of the basic building blocks in the production of linear polyester resins used in the manufacture of polyester films, packaging materials, and bottles. TPA used in the manufacture of such polyesters resins must meet certain minimum purity requirements.<br>
The purified condition of TPA refers primarily to the absence of significant concentrations of 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (4-CBA) and para-toluic acid (p-TAc) that are present in significant quantities in the commercially-available crude grades of TPA. Both 4-CBA and p-TAc are partial oxidation products formed in the manufacture of TPA by the catalytic oxidation of para-xylene. The purified form of TPA also refers to the absence of color bodies that impart a characteristic yellow hue to the crude material. The color bodies are aromatic compounds having the structures of benzils, fluorenones, and/or anthraquinones. 4-CBA and p-TAc are particularly detrimental to the polymerization process because they act as chain terminators during the<br>
condensation reaction between TPA and ethylene glycol in the production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET).<br>
In a typical process for producing TPA, a crude slurry is withdrawn from the primary oxidation reactor. The crude slurry contains a liquid mother liquor and solid particles of crude terephthalic acid (CTA). The liquid mother liquor exiting the primary oxidation reactor typically contains a significant amount of impurities. Thus, in many conventional TPA production processes, a substantial portion of the liquid mother liquor exiting the primary oxidation reactor is replaced/displaced with a "clean" replacement solvent prior to purification of the CTA particles. This replacement/displacement of the liquid mother liquor in the crude slurry with a replacement solvent is commonly known as "liquor exchange."<br>
Conventional devices employed to perform liquor exchange can be both expensive and unreliable. One common device used to perform liquor exchange is a disc stack centrifuge system. Although effective for replacing the original mother liquor with a replacement solvent, the high-velocity rotating components of such mechanical centrifuge systems cause them to be expensive and unreliable. Thus, a CTA purification system that eliminates the use of one or more mechanical centrifuges would have a lower capital cost and higher reliability than conventional CTA purification systems. Further, if the liquor exchange function typically provided by a mechanical centrifuge could be combined with other functions of a CTA purification system, the overall cost of the system could be reduced while increasing its reliability. Finally, if one or more mechanical centrifuges could be replaced by mechanisms that more effectively replace impurity-laden mother liquor with clean replacement solvent, a purer TPA product could be produced.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One embodiment of the present invention concerns a process comprising the following steps: (a) oxidizing one or more reactants in a primary oxidation reactor to thereby produce a solid/liquid mixture comprising CTA particles; and<br>
 (b) subjecting at least a portion of the solid/liquid mixture to oxidative digestion in a xoned slurry concentrator, thereby producing a solids-concentrated mixture containing oxidation-treated TPA particles.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention concerns a process comprising the following steps: (a) introducing a feed slurry into a zoned slurry concentrator, wherein the feed slurry comprises solid TPA particles; (b) withdrawing a liquid-concentrated mixture from a liquids outlet of the zoned slurry concentrator; and (c) withdrawing a solids-concentrated mixture from a solids outlet of the zoned slurry concentrator, wherein the ratio of the solids content of the solids-concentrated mixture to the solids content of the liquid-concentrated mixture is at least about 2:1 by weight.<br>
Still another embodiment of the present invention concerns a process comprising the following steps: (a) oxidizing para-xylene in a primary oxidation reactor to thereby produce an initial solid/liquid mixture containing CTA particles; (b) subjecting at least a portion of the initial solid/liquid mixture to oxidative digestion in an initial digester to thereby produce an initial digested solid/liquid mixture; (c) subjecting at least a portion of the initial digested solid/liquid mixture to oxidative digestion in a zoned slurry concentrator; (d) withdrawing a liquid-concentrated mixture from a liquids outlet of the zoned slurry concentrator, wherein the ratio of the solids content of the initial digested solid/liquid mixture to the solids content of the liquid-concentrated mixture is at least about 1.5:1 by weight; (e) withdrawing a solids-concentrated mixture from a solids outlet of the zoned slurry concentrator; and (f) introducing a dilution liquid into the solids-concentrated mixture to thereby produce a diluted mixture having a solids content less than the solids content of the solids-concentrated mixture.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the present invention concerns an apparatus for producing and purifying a solid/liquid mixture containing CTA particles. The system includes a primary oxidation reactor for producing the solid/liquid mixture and a zoned slurry concentrator. The zoned slurry concentrator comprises a vessel shell, an upright baffle, a feed inlet, a liquids outlet, and a<br>
solids outlet. The vessel shell defines an internal volume. The upright baffle is disposed in the vessel shell and separates at least a portion of the internal volume into a settling zone and an agitated zone. The feed inlet receives at least a portion of the solid/liquid mixture from the primary oxidation reactor and discharges the portion into the agitated zone. The liquids outlet is positioned proximate the settling zone. The solids outlet is positioned below the liquids outlet.<br>

More preferably, the oxidant stream consists essentially of molecular oxygen and nitrogen. Most preferably, the oxidant stream is dry air that comprises about 21 mole percent molecular oxygen and about 78 to about 81 mole percent nitrogen. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the oxidant stream can comprise substantially pure oxygen.<br>
During liquid-phase oxidation in primary oxidation reactor 10, it is preferred for the oxidant stream to be introduced into reactor 10 in an amount that provides molecular oxygen somewhat exceeding the stoichiometric oxygen demand. Thus, it is preferred that the ratio of the mass flow rate of the oxidant stream (e.g., air) to the mass flow rate of the oxidizable compound (e.g., para-xylene) entering reactor 10 is maintained in the range of from about 0.5:1 to<br>
about 20:1, more preferably in the range of from about 1:1 to about 10:1, and most preferably in the range of from 2:1 to 6:1.<br>
The liquid-phase oxidation reaction carried out in reactor 10 is preferably a precipitating reaction that generates solids. More preferably, the liquid-phase oxidation carried out in reactor 10 causes at least about 10 weight percent of the oxidizable compound (e.g., para-xylene) introduced into oxidation reactor 10 to form solids (e.g., CTA particles) in the reaction medium. Still more preferably, the liquid-phase oxidation causes at least about 50 weight percent of the oxidizable compound to form solids in the reaction medium. Most preferably, the liquid-phase oxidation causes at least 90 weight percent of the oxidizable compound to form solids in the reaction medium. It is preferred for the solids content of the reaction medium to be maintained in the range of from about 5 to about 40 weight percent, still more preferably in the range of from about 10 to about 35 weight percent, and most preferably in the range of from 15 to 30 weight percent. As used herein, the term "solids content" shall denote the weight percent solids in a multi-phase mixture.<br>
During oxidation in oxidation reactor 10, the multi-phase reaction medium is preferably maintained at an elevated temperature in the range of from about 125 to about 200°C, more preferably in the range of from about 150 to about 180°C, and most preferably in the range of from 155 to 165°C. The overhead pressure in oxidation reactor 10 is preferably maintained in the range of from about 1 to about 20 bar gauge (barg), more preferably in the range of from about 2 to about 12 barg, and most preferably in the range of from 4 to 8 barg.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 1, a crude product slurry is withdrawn from an outlet of primary oxidation reactor 10 via line 12. The solid phase of the crude product slurry in line 12 is preferably formed primarily of solid particles of crude terephthalic acid (CTA). The liquid phase of the crude product slurry in line 12 is a liquid mother liquor comprising at least a portion of the solvent, the catalyst system, and minor amounts of dissolved TPA. The solids content of the crude product slurry in line 12 is preferably the same as the solids content of the<br>
reaction medium in primary oxidation reactor 10, discussed above. The crude product slurry in line 12 typically has a combined 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (4-CBA) and para-toluic acid (pTAc) content in a range of from about 100 to about 500 parts per million by weight (ppmw) based on the weight of the solids.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the crude product slurry in line 12 is transported directly (i.e., without intermediate processing steps) to a digester 18 for purification by oxidative digestion. In an alternative embodiment, an optional liquor exchange system 14 is employed to remove at least a portion of the liquid mother liquor from the crude product slurry and replace the removed mother liquor (i.e., filtrate) with a replacement solvent prior introduction into digester 18. The replacement solvent typically comprises acetic acid and/or water. The primary purpose of liquor exchange 14 is to provide cleaner solvent media for subsequent oxidative digestion of the CTA solids.<br>
Optional liquor exchange system 14 can employ a variety of different apparatuses to remove and replace at least a portion of the crude mother liquor. For example, liquor exchange system 14 can employ a disc stack centrifuge to separate at least a portion of the mother liquor from the CTA solids and replace the removed mother liquor with a clean replacement solvent. Alternatively, liquor exchange can be accomplished using any suitable solid/liquid separator (e.g., a decanter centrifuge, a rotary disk centrifuge, a belt filter, or a rotary vacuum filter) and then diluting the resulting solids (typically a wet cake) with a clean replacement solvent, hi one embodiment of the present invention, at least about 25 weight percent of the mother liquor in the crude product slurry is replaced with a replacement solvent, more preferably at least about 50 weight percent of the mother liquor is replaced with a replacement solvent, and most preferably in the range of from 75 to 99 weight percent of the mother liquor is replaced with a replacement solvent. When liquor exchange system 14 is employed, the resulting liquor-exchanged slurry is passed through line 16 to digester <br>
In digester 18, the crude product slurry or liquor-exchanged slurry is subjected to purification by oxidative digestion. As used herein, the term "oxidative digestion" denotes a process step or steps where a feed is subjected to oxidation. Digester 18 can be one or more reactors or zones. Preferably, digester 18 comprises one or more mechanically-agitated reactors. A secondary oxidant stream, which can have the same composition as the gas-phase oxidant stream fed to primary oxidation reactor 10, is introduced into digester 18 to provide the molecular oxygen required for oxidative digestion. Additional oxidation catalyst can also be added if necessary. As mentioned above, the crude product slurry or liquor-exchange slurry introduced into digester 18 contains significant quantities of impurities such as, for example, 4-CBA and p-TAc. The oxidative digestion in digester 18 preferably causes oxidation of a substantial portion of the 4-CBA and p-TAc to TPA.<br>
The slurry fed to digester 18 typically has a 4-CBA content of at least about 100 parts per million based on the weight of the solids in the feed slurry (ppmwfs), more typically in the range of from about 200 to about 10,000 ppmwfs and most typically in the range of from 800 to 5,000 ppmwfs. The slurry fed to digester 18 typically has a p-TAc content of at least about 250 ppmwfs, more typically in the range of from about 300 to about 5,000 ppmwfs and most typically in the range of from 400 to 1,500 ppmwfs. The slurry product exiting digester 18 preferably has a 4-CBA content of less than about 150 parts per million based on the weight of the solids in the product slurry (ppmwps), more preferably less than about 100 ppmwps, and most preferably less than 50 ppmwps. The slurry product exiting digester 18 preferably has a p-TAc content of less than about 300 ppmwps, more preferably less than about 200 ppmwps and most preferably less than 150 ppmwps. Preferably, oxidative digestion in digester 18 causes the product slurry exiting digester 18 to have 4-CBA and/or p-TAc content that is at least about 50 percent less than the 4-CBA and/or p-TAc content of the slurry fed to digester 18, more preferably at least about 85 percent less, and most preferably at least 95 percent less. By way of illustration, if the 4-CBA content of the slurry fed to digester 18 is 200 ppmwfs and the 4-<br>
CBA content of the product slurry exiting digester 18 is 100 ppmwps, then the 4-CBA content of the product slurry is 50 percent less than the 4-CBA content of the feed slurry.<br>
The temperature at which oxidative digestion is carried out in digester 18 is preferably at least about 10°C greater than the temperature of oxidation in primary oxidation reactor 10, more preferably in the range of from about 20 to about 80°C greater, and most preferably in the range of from 30 to 50°C greater. The additional heat required for the operation of digester 18 may be provided by supplying a vaporized solvent to digester 18 and allowing the vaporized solvent to condense therein. The oxidative digestion temperature in digester 18 is preferably maintained in the range of from about 180 to about 240°C, more preferably in the range of from about 190 to about 220°C, and most preferably in the range of from 200 to 210°C. The oxidative digestion pressure in digester 18 is preferably maintained in the range of from about 100 to about 350 pounds per square inch gauge (psig), more preferably in the range of from about 175 to about 275 psig, and most preferably in the range of from 185 to 225 psig.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, digester 18 includes two digestion reactors/zones - an initial digester and a final digester. When digester 18 includes an initial digester and a final digester, it is preferred for the final digester to be operated at a lower temperature and pressure than the initial digester. Preferably, the operating temperature of the final digester is at least about 2°C lower than the operating temperature of the initial digester. Most preferably, the operating temperature of the final digester is in the range of from about 5 to about 15°C lower than the operating temperature of the initial digester. Preferably, the operating pressure of the final digester is at least about 5 psi lower than the operating pressure of the initial digester. Most preferably, the operating pressure of the final digester is in the range of from about 10 to about 50 psig lower than the operating temperature of the initial digester.

Referring again to FIG. 1, an oxidation-treated slurry is discharged from digester 18 via line 20. The solid phase of the oxidation-treated slurry is formed primarily of purified terephthalic acid (PTA) particles, while the liquid phase is formed of an oxidation-treated mother liquor. The solids content of the oxidation-treated slurry in line 20 is preferably in the range of from about 1 to about 50 percent by weight, more preferably in the range of from about 5 to about 40 percent by weight, and most preferably in the range of from 20 to 30 percent by weight. The oxidation-treated slurry in line 20 is introduced into a zoned slurry concentrator 100.<br>
As used herein, the term "zoned slurry concentrator" means a single vessel having at least one internal upright baffle that divides at least a portion of the vessel's internal volume into an agitated zone and a settling zone; where the agitated zone communicates with the settling zone proximate a lower end/opening of the lowest baffle; and where the vessel defines a liquids outlet for removing a liquid-concentrated mixture from the settling zone at an elevation above the lower end/opening of the lowest baffle and a solids outlet for removing a solids-concentrated mixture from the vessel at an elevation below the liquids outlet.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a preferred zoned slurry concentrator 100 suitable for use in the present invention. Zoned slurry concentrator 100 comprises a vessel shell 102 that defines and internal volume 104. Vessel shell 102 preferably has at least one substantially vertical sidewall that has a generally cylindrical and/or frustoconical configuration. Zoned slurry concentrator 100 also comprises at least one upright baffle 106 that separates at least a portion of internal volume 104 into an agitated zone 108 and a settling zone 110. Upright baffle 106 can be<br>
formed of a single member, or a plurality of baffle members. Upright baffle 106 preferably includes at least one generally cylindrical and/or frustoconical baffle spaced inwardly from the upright sidewalls of vessel shell 102. Zoned slurry concentrator 100 also comprises an upright draft tube 112 at least partly disposed in agitated zone 108. Draft tube 112 is preferably a substantially hollow, generally cylindrical or frustoconical tube spaced inwardly from upright baffle 106. An upwardly moving section 114 of agitated zone 108 is defined within draft tube 112, and a downwardly moving section 116 of agitated zone 108 is defined between draft tube 112 and vessel shell 102.<br>
In operation, a feed slurry in line 118 is introduced into zoned slurry concentrator 100 via a feed inlet 120. The feed slurry enters a lower opening 122 of draft tube 112 and is forced upwardly by a rotating propeller 124. Propeller 124 is powered by a motor 126. Motor 126 and propeller 124 are connected by a drive shaft 128 that extends through vessel shell 102 and into agitated zone 108 of internal volume 104. The feed slurry moves upwardly though draft tube 112 and then exits an upper opening 130 of draft tube 112. The level of slurry in vessel shell 102 is maintained so that the upper surface 131 of the slurry is above upper opening 130 of draft tube 112. As the slurry exits upper opening 130 of draft tube 112, it circulates into a downward flow pattern in downwardly-moving section 116 of agitated zone 108. At least a portion of downwardly-moving section 116 of agitated zone 108 is defined between draft tube 112 and upright baffle 106. An agitated zone outlet opening 133 is defined between baffle 106 and draft tube 112 proximate the bottom of upright baffle 106. The slurry exits agitated zone 108 through agitated zone outlet opening 133. The after exiting agitated zone 108 the slurry enter settling zone 110 via a settling zone opening 135. Settling zone opening 135 is defined between vessel shell 102 and baffle 106 proximate the bottom of upright baffle 106.<br>
Upright baffle 106 is operable to substantially isolate settling zone 110 from the turbulence generated by rotating propeller in agitated zone 108. In settling zone 110, the liquid phase of the slurry moves upwardly in a relatively<br>
non-turbulent manner at a velocity less than the velocity necessary to suspend the solid phase in the upwardly moving liquid phase. This relatively slow, non-turbulent, upward flow of the liquid phase in settling zone 110 permits the downward gravitational force acting on the solid phase particles to overcome the upward liquid flow forces acting on the solid phase particles, thereby cause solid/liquid disengagement in settling zone 110. This solid/liquid disengagement in settling zone 110 produces a liquid-concentrated mixture with low solids content from the top of settling zone 110. The liquid-concentrated mixture is withdrawn from internal volume 104 via liquids outlet 134 and is transported away from zoned slurry concentrator 100 in line 136. The solid particles that travel downward through settling zone 110 exit settling zone 110 via settling zone opening 135. These solids accumulate near the bottom of internal volume 104 of vessel shell 102, thereby forming a solids-concentrated mixture with high solids content. The solids-concentrated mixture is withdrawn from internal volume 104 via solids outlet 138 and is transported away from zoned slurry concentrator 100 in line 140. Vapor introduced into or formed in zoned slurry concentrator 100 is discharged through a vapor outlet 142 and transported away from zoned slurry concentrator 100 in line 144.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the feed slurry introduced into zoned slurry concentrator 100 via feed inlet 120 has a solids content in the range of from about 1 to about 50 weight percent, more preferably in the range of from about 5 to about 40 weight percent, and most preferably in the range of from 20 to 30 weight percent. It is preferred for the solids in the feed slurry introduced into zoned slurry concentrator 100 to be formed of at least about 75 weight percent TPA, more preferably at least about 90 weight percent TPA, and most preferably at least 95 weight percent TPA.<br>
The solids-concentrated mixture exiting zoned slurry concentrator 100 via solids outlet 138 preferably has a solids content of more than about 60 weight percent, more preferably more than about 80 weight percent, and most preferably more than 95 weight percent. The liquid-concentrated mixture exiting zoned slurry concentrator 100 via liquids outlet 134 preferably has a<br>
solids content of less than about 40 weight percent, more preferably less than about 20 weight percent, and most preferably less than 5 weight percent.<br>
Preferably, the solids content of the liquid-concentrated mixture exiting zoned slurry concentrator 100 via liquids outlet 134 is at least about 50 percent less than the solids content of the feed slurry, more preferably at least about 75 percent less than the solids content of the feed slurry, and most preferably at least 90 percent less than the solids content of the feed slurry. For example, if the feed slurry has a solids content of 30 weight percent and the liquid-concentrated mixture has a solids content of 15 weight percent, then the liquid-concentrated mixture has a solids content that is 50 percent less than the solids content of the feed slurry. Preferably, the solids content of the solids-concentrated mixture exiting zoned slurry concentrator 100 via solids outlet 138 is at least about 50 percent greater than the solids content of the feed slurry, more preferably at least about 100 percent greater than the solids content of the feed slurry, and most preferably at least 200 percent greater than the solids content of the feed slurry. For example, if the feed slurry has a solids content of 30 weight percent and the solids-concentrated mixture has a solids content of 45 weight percent, then the solids-concentrated mixture has a solids content that is 50 percent greater than the solids content of the feed slurry.<br>
The ratio of the solids content of the solids-concentrated mixture exiting zoned slurry concentrator 100 via solids outlet 138 to the liquid-concentrated mixture exiting zoned slurry concentrator 100 via liquids outlet 134 is preferably at least about 2:1, more preferably at least about 10:1, and most preferably at least 50:1. The ratio of the solids content of the solids-concentrated mixture exiting zoned slurry concentrator 100 via solids outlet 138 to the feed slurry entering zoned slurry concentrator 100 via feed inlet 120 is preferably at least about 1.5:1, more preferably at least about 5:1, and most preferably at least 25:1. The ratio of the solids content of the feed slurry entering zoned slurry concentrator 100 via feed inlet 120 to the liquid-concentrated mixture exiting zoned slurry concentrator 100 via liquids outlet<br>
134 is preferably at least about 1.5:1, more preferably at least about 5:1, and most preferably at least 25:1.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the solids-concentrated mixture is diluted with a dilution liquid. This dilution of the solids-concentrated mixture can be accomplished by introducing the dilution liquid into zoned slurry concentrator 100 at a location near solids outlet 138. Preferably, dilution is accomplished by introducing the dilution liquid into the solids-concentrated mixture after the solids-concentrated mixture has been removed from zoned slurry concentrator 100. The dilution liquid can function as a "clean" replacement solvent for the solvent removed from zoned slurry concentrator 100 with the liquid-concentrated mixture. The dilution liquid is preferably a solvent for TPA. Most preferably, the dilution liquid comprises acetic acid and/or water.<br>
Dilution of the solids-concentrated mixture with the dilution liquid forms a diluted mixture. Preferably, the dilution liquid is added to the solids-concentrated mixture in an amount such that the solids content of the diluted mixture is at least about 25 percent less than the solids content of the solids-concentrated mixture, more preferably at least about 50 percent less of the solids content of the solids-concentrated mixture, and most preferably in the range of from 60 to 90 percent less than the solids content of the solids-concentrated mixture. Preferably, the solids content of the diluted mixture is in the range of from about 1 to about 50 weight percent, more preferably in the range of from about 5 to about 40 weight percent, and most preferably in the range of from 20 to 30 weight percent.<br>

Common components of the zoned slurry concentrators illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3 are identified with common reference numerals. One difference between the zoned slurry concentrators of FIGS. 2 and 3 is that upright baffle 106 of the zoned slurry concentrator illustrated in FIG. 3 includes one or more circulation openings 150 between the upper and lower ends of upright baffle 106. Another difference between the zoned slurry concentrators of FIGS. 2 and<br>

Preferably the post-digestion crystallization pressure is maintained in the range of from about 10 to about 150 psig, more preferably in the range of from about 50 to about 120 psig, and most preferably about 80 psig.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 1, the solids-concentrated mixture exiting zoned slurry concentrator 100 via line 26 can be diluted with a dilution liquid supplied via line 30. As discussed above, in one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the dilution liquid is combined with the solids-concentrated mixture in an external dilution zone located outside of zoned slurry concentrator 100.

concentrator lOOa, the crude product slurry is separated into a liquid-concentrated mixture exiting via line 250 and a solids-concentrated mixture exiting via line 252.

Finally, the system of FIG. 5 employs a crystallization system 372 downstream of final digester 368 and upstream of solids recovery system 334.<br>
Zoned slurry concentrator 100 receives the crude product slurry directly from primary oxidation reactor 310. In order for oxidative digestion to be carried out in zoned slurry concentrator 100, an oxidant stream containing molecular oxygen is introduced into zoned slurry concentrator 100 via line 354. Alternatively, the oxidant stream can be introduced into the crude product slurry upstream of zoned slurry concentrator 100 via line 356, thereby providing an oxygen-enriched crude slurry in line 352. As illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3, when the oxidant stream is introduced into zoned slurry concentrator 100, an additional oxidant inlet 160 is provided in zoned slurry concentrator 100 for receiving the oxidant stream. Oxidant inlet 160 preferably discharges the oxidant stream at a location just below the propeller 124.

However, the system of FIG. 6 employs zoned slurry concentrator 100 to perform final oxidative digestion, liquor exchange, and/or crystallization of the initial digested slurry exiting initial digester 450 via line 452.<br>
The crude product slurry or liquor-exchanged slurry produced from primary oxidation reactor 410 or liquor exchange system 414 (depending on whether or not liquor exchange system 414 is employed) is introduced into initial digester 450 for initial oxidative digestion. The oxidative digestion in initial digester 450 is carried out in accordance with the previous description. The resulting initial digested slurry exits initial digester 450 via line 452 and is introduced into zoned slurry concentrator 100 for final oxidative digestion.<br>
-<br>
In order for oxidative digestion to be carried out in zoned slurry concentrator 100, an oxidant stream containing molecular oxygen is introduced into zoned slurry concentrator 100 via line 456. Alternatively, the oxidant stream can be introduced into the initial digested slurry upstream of zoned slurry concentrator 100 via line 458, thereby providing an oxygen-enriched slurry in line 454. As illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3, when the oxidant stream is introduced into zoned slurry concentrator 100, an additional oxidant inlet 160 is provided in zoned slurry concentrator 100 for receiving the oxidant stream. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 6, line 456 is equivalent to line 162 of FIGS. 2 and 3, while line 458 is equivalent to line 164 of FIGS. 2 and 3.<br>
Final oxidative digestion is carried out in zoned slurry concentrator 100 in a manner and under conditions that are substantially similar to the final oxidative digestion described above. The final digested solids-concentrated mixture exiting zoned slurry concentrator 100 via line 464 is diluted with a dilution liquid in line 486 to thereby produce a diluted mixture. The diluted mixture is transported to solids recovery system 434 via line 470 for recovery of the final PTA product.<br>
The inventors note that for all numerical ranges provided herein, the upper and lower ends of the ranges can be independent of one another. For example, a numerical range of 10 to 100 means greater than 10 and/or less than 100. Thus, a range of 10 to 100 provides support for a claim limitation of greater than 10 (without the upper bound), a claim limitation of less than 100 (without the lower bound), as well as the full 10 to 100 range (with both upper and lower bounds).<br>
The inventors also note that, as used herein, "coupled in communication" denotes a direct or indirect connection that permits the flow of solids and/or liquids. For example, the outlet of primary oxidation reactor 10 (FIG. 1) is "coupled in communication" with the inlet of zoned slurry concentrator 100, even though there is intermediate equipment (e.g., digester 18) located therebetween.<br>
The invention has been described in detail with particular reference to preferred embodiments thereof, but will be understood that variations and modification can be affected within the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
