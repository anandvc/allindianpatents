Polyphase line filter<br>
Description<br>
5	The present invention generally relates to a polyphase line<br>
	or mains filter, in particular to a passive harmonic filter<br>
	as front end at non-linear consumers or loads.<br>
	The strongly increasing proportion of power electronics in<br>
10	energy supply networks or mains, in particular in the field<br>
	of drive engineering, means increasing distortion in the<br>
	supply voltage due to the high harmonic contents of the<br>
	current. In order to avoid harmonic currents in supply<br>
	networks, standards specifying certain guidelines for<br>
15	manufacturers of electric and electronic devices have been<br>
	issued in Europe over the last few years.<br>
	There are different active and passive solutions by<br>
	different manufacturers worldwide for keeping to the<br>
20	standards, guidelines and recommendations issued. Depending<br>
	on the power and application of the devices or the usage of<br>
	the devices by the customer, these solutions may have<br>
	advantages and/or disadvantages. Basically, active or<br>
	passive devices and filters available at present for<br>
25	reducing current harmonics are not really attractive as to<br>
	setup volume or cost and are thus only employed under<br>
	certain circumstances.<br>
	For electronic devices having internal B2 and/or B6<br>
30	r.ectifier circuits, the following conventional methods for<br>
	reducing current harmonics are used: AC and DC chokes,<br>
	higher-pulse rectifier circuits over B12, B18 or B24,<br>
	acceptor circuit apparatuses, low-pass filters for 50 Hz or<br>
	60 Hz, special harmonic filters, means for an active<br>
35	sinusoidal current consumption (so-called active front<br>
	ends) and active harmonic filters. The active harmonic<br>
	filters here are operated in parallel on the network or<br>
	mains.<br><br>
- 2 —<br>
	Special harmonic filters will be explained in greater<br>
	detail below. The special harmonic filters available at<br>
	present exhibit a plurality of disadvantages, partly have<br>
5	very large setup volumes compared to consumers or cause<br>
	immense expenses which often exceed the actual apparatus<br>
	expenses of the consumer coupled thereto.<br>
	Since the circuit assembly of special harmonic filters<br>
10	fundamentally consists of inductive and capacitive<br>
	components, three problems basically arise when operating<br>
	the filter. High inductance values in the longitudinal<br>
	branch of a filter result in a load-dependent voltage drops<br>
	and may result in a reduced intermediate circuit voltage<br>
15	(direct voltage after a rectifier). This effect is partly<br>
	compensated by connecting capacitances since capacitances<br>
	raise the voltage again, however, a load-dependent voltage<br>
	change will remain.<br>
20	In addition, capacitors coupled in a shunt arm produce a<br>
	capacitive reactive current which flows to the harmonic<br>
	filter already under no-load conditions. A capacitive<br>
	reactive current portion basically is to be kept very small<br>
	since this so-called overcompensation is not desirable for<br>
25	energy supply companies. Some manufacturers of special<br>
	harmonic filter thus offer the possibility of partly or<br>
	completely switching off the capacitors under partial load<br>
	conditions using a contactor. This in turn increases the<br>
	expenses and complexity since such a contactor for a<br>
30	capacitive current should have suitable contacts and since<br>
	the filter has to be integrated in the control flow.<br>
	Another disadvantage of conventional special harmonic<br>
	filters to be mentioned is the resonance behavior of LC<br>
35	couplings. Basically, all circuits consisting of inductive<br>
	and capacitive components have at least one resonance<br>
	point. It is kept in mind in the case of filters that the<br>
	frequencies arising are, if possible, not in the region of<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
	the resonance points, however, in dynamic load changes in<br>
	connection with load changes at the supply network and/or<br>
	switching on or off compensation units installed on the<br>
	supply network, this is hardly foreseeable.<br>
5<br>
	Thus, it shows that conventional special harmonic filters<br>
	exhibit serious technological and economical disadvantages<br>
	making usage thereof more difficult and/or expensive.<br>
10	It is the object of the present invention to provide a<br>
	polyphase line filter which is implemented as a special<br>
	harmonic filter and, compared to conventional harmonic<br>
	filters, exhibits a smaller setup volume, a smaller power<br>
	dissipation and reduced expenses.<br>
15<br>
	This object is achieved by a polyphase line filter<br>
	according to claim 1.<br>
	The present invention provides a polyphase line filter<br>
20	comprising a first filter branch between a first filter<br>
	input and a first filter output, the first filter branch<br>
	comprising a first series connection of at least two<br>
	inductances which are wound to different legs of a multi-<br>
	leg filter core, and a second filter branch between a<br>
25	second filter input and a second filter output, the second<br>
	filter branch comprising a second series connection of at<br>
	least two inductances which are wound to the different legs<br>
	of the multi-leg filter core.<br>
30	The central idea of the present invention is that it is of<br>
	advantage to distribute several inductances which are part<br>
	of a filter branch between a filter input and a filter<br>
	output to different legs of a multi-leg filter core. It has<br>
	been found out that such a distribution of the inductances<br>
35	results in a reduction in the effective voltage drop over<br>
	the longitudinal branch of a filter. By the inventive<br>
	distribution of the winding of a filter branch to at least<br>
	two legs of a multi-leg filter core, a reduction or even<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
	elimination of individual flow components in the filter<br>
	core can be achieved. This allows reducing the setup volume<br>
	since the magnetic field energy stored in the filter core<br>
	is reduced.<br>
5<br>
	A reduction in the field energy is possible because the<br>
	currents in the individual filter branches of the polyphase<br>
	line filter have a predetermined phase relation relative to<br>
	one another. Thus, the magnetic fluxes caused by the<br>
10	current infiltrating the individual inductances have a<br>
	predetermined phase relation. If the magnetic field<br>
	produced by currents in at least two filter branches<br>
	superimpose one another, this may result in a reduction in<br>
	the entire magnetic flux. • However, if the magnetic flux<br>
15	through a inductance is reduced, the voltage drop across<br>
	the inductance will also be reduced. The consequence as a<br>
	whole is that the voltage drop across an inventive<br>
	polyphase line filter is smaller than across a conventional<br>
	line filter. The load dependence of the output voltage at<br>
20	the filter output and/or at the output of a rectifier<br>
	downstream of the filter is also reduced. In addition, the<br>
	setup size of the inventive polyphase line filter may be<br>
	smaller than in conventional filter assemblies. Finally,<br>
	the cost of a filter also decreases. Apart from that, the<br>
25	losses in the filter are reduced since the voltage drop as<br>
	a whole is smaller.<br>
	Shunt inductances in the polyphase line filter may be<br>
	formed by smaller wire thicknesses since the overall energy<br>
30	stored in the filter is smaller due to the inventive<br>
	distribution of the longitudinal windings to several legs<br>
	of the filter core. Thus, the energy to be stored in the<br>
	shunt inductances decreases and the wire thicknesses can<br>
	consequently be reduced. Similarly, capacitive energy<br>
35	storage means which are also part of a polyphase line<br>
	filter may be implemented to be smaller since the energy to<br>
	be provided by the capacitive energy storages is also<br>
	smaller. Reduced capacitive energy storage means, however,<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
	result in a reduced capacitive reactive current in a no-<br>
	load state of the polyphase line filter and/or under<br>
	partial load conditions. Thus, switching off the capacitive<br>
	energy storage means in no-load operation or in partial<br>
5	load operation becomes superfluous. This results in a<br>
	considerable simplification in the filter and apparatus<br>
	control, allowing a faster, cheaper setup of an apparatus<br>
	comprising an inventive line filter.<br>
10	In a preferred embodiment, the polyphase line filter is<br>
	implemented to pass on useful alternating currents of a<br>
	predetermined frequency from the first filter input to the<br>
	first filter output and from the second filter input to the<br>
	second filter output and to attenuate at the first filter<br>
15	input or the second filter input disturbing currents of a<br>
	frequency different than the predetermined frequency<br>
	occurring at the first filter output or the second filter<br>
	output. Such a design of the polyphase line filter is of<br>
	advantage since it is assumed here that disturbing currents<br>
20	are produced by a consumer connected to the filter output<br>
	and not to be passed on to the current supply network or<br>
	mains coupled to the filter input. Thus, the focus of<br>
	attention must be that disturbances, in particular harmonic<br>
	currents and/or effects on mains, are not transferred from<br>
25	the filter output to the filter input. The undesired<br>
	effects mentioned will subsequently simply be referred to<br>
	as disturbances. An inventive line filter in contrast is<br>
	implemented to pass on the useful alternating current,<br>
	which typically has a frequency of 16% Hz, 50 Hz, 60 Hz or<br>
30	400 Hz, from the filter input to the filter output. Thus,<br>
	supply for the consumer is ensured. A corresponding filter<br>
	design allows any distorted current form, exemplarily also<br>
	an approximately block-shaped current form, to be provided<br>
	at the filter output, whereas the current consumption at<br>
35	the filter input is basically sinusoidal. The higher-<br>
	frequency current portions necessary to produce current<br>
	forms distorted compared to the sinus shape at the filter<br>
	output are provided, when the filter is designed<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
	appropriately, by inductive and also by capacitive energy<br>
	storage elements. In the inventive filter, consumers can be<br>
	operated at nearly any input current form without<br>
	impressing higher-frequency disturbing currents which are,<br>
5	for example, based on harmonic currents or different<br>
	effects on mains of a consumer connected to a filter, in<br>
	the input-side energy supply network. All these undesired<br>
	current flows will subsequently be referred to as<br>
	disturbing currents.<br>
10<br>
	In another preferred embodiment, a filter branch of the<br>
	polyphase line filter includes a first inductance connected<br>
	between the respective filter input and an internal node of<br>
	the respective filter branch, a second inductance connected<br>
15	between the internal node and the respective filter output,<br>
	and a third inductance which is part of a shunt branch and<br>
	is connected to the internal node. The two longitudinal<br>
	inductances connected between the filter input and the<br>
	internal node and between the filter output and the<br>
20	internal node, respectively, are preferably wound to<br>
	different legs of the multi-leg filter core in a manner<br>
	such that the input-side inductance of the second filter<br>
	branch is wound to the same filter leg as the output-side<br>
	inductance of the first filter branch. Coupling of the two<br>
25	filter branches belonging to two different phases of the<br>
	network current supply is achieved by this arrangement. In<br>
	an assembly described above, an advantageous T structure of<br>
	the filter allowing good attenuation of output-side<br>
	disturbances is connected to a coupling of at least two<br>
30	filter branches. It particularly becomes evident that no<br>
	additional windings are necessary for producing the<br>
	coupling between several filter branches compared to a<br>
	conventional T filter structure. The inductance of the<br>
	shunt circuit can still be wound to a suitable filter leg,<br>
35	wherein this may be both the leg on which the input-side<br>
	winding is situated, and the leg on which the output-side<br>
	winding is situated. The filter can be adjusted to the<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
	respective tasks and requirements by flexibly placing the<br>
	windings.<br>
	In addition, it is preferred for a capacitive energy<br>
5	storage means to be coupled in the shunt branch of a filter<br>
	branch. In a preferred embodiment it is coupled to the<br>
	longitudinal branch via an inductance. A symmetrical layout<br>
	of the different filter branches is preferred so that a<br>
	second and, if present, a third filter branch are coupled<br>
10	to the capacitive energy storage means. Capacitive energy<br>
	storage means allows providing energy at times when the<br>
	energy in the inductances is minimal. By introducing<br>
	capacitive energy storages, the polyphase line filter is<br>
	able to emit and/or receive another current component in<br>
15	addition to the supply current at the filter input so that<br>
	non-sinusoidal output current forms may be achieved.<br>
	Switching capacitive energy storage means into a shunt<br>
	branch is still of advantage since a capacitance is able to<br>
	short high-frequency current portions. Thus, the<br>
20	capacitance in the shunt branch reduces the transfer of<br>
	high-frequency current portions from the filter output to<br>
	the filter input. Especially in connection with an<br>
	inventive filter concept in which inductances of several<br>
	filter branches are coupled to one another by being mounted<br>
25	to a common leg of the filter core, the usage of capacitive<br>
	energy storage elements is of particular advantage. The<br>
	inductively stored energy is reduced by coupling the<br>
	inductances. The result is that the capacitive reactive<br>
	energy, too, in the filter can be reduced. Thus, the<br>
30	capacitive energy storage means can be made considerably<br>
	smaller in connection with the inventively coupled<br>
	inductances compared to conventional realizations. By a<br>
	combination of capacitances and an inventive filter<br>
	concept, the advantage can be achieved that the setup size<br>
35	of the capacitances can be reduced. This reduces the<br>
	reactive power consumed by the capacitances in no-load<br>
	operation and contributes to cost reduction.<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
	Furthermore, it is possible to couple capacitive energy<br>
	storage elements directly, i.e. without connecting a shunt<br>
	inductance in between, to the nodes to which the different<br>
	longitudinal inductances are coupled. Such a setup may be<br>
5	of advantage to achieve an even stronger attenuation of<br>
	high-order harmonics. There is no more inductance connected<br>
	in series to the capacitances. The capacitances may thus<br>
	couple their energies directly to the longitudinal branch.<br>
	Furthermore, the magnitude of the impedance of a capacitive<br>
10	element is very small at high frequencies. Thus, good<br>
	dissipation of high-frequency currents at the output of the<br>
	filter can be expected. The circuit structure, too, is<br>
	simplified when shunt inductances connected between the<br>
	longitudinal branch and the capacitive energy storage<br>
15	elements are no longer necessary.<br>
	Furthermore, it is preferred for the polyphase line filter<br>
	to be a three-phase line filter. Preferably, a three-phase<br>
	filter core is used here. There are three filter branches<br>
20	which each comprise a series connection of at least two<br>
	inductances between the filter input and the filter output.<br>
	The input-side and output-side inductances in this branch<br>
	are each wound around different legs of the three-phase<br>
	filter core. A three-phase layout has the great advantage<br>
25	that the polyphase line filter can be employed in<br>
	connection with conventional three-phase supply networks.<br>
	Furthermore, a three-phase layout is of advantage in that<br>
	the phase relation predetermined by the three-phase supply<br>
	network between the individual phases and thus between the<br>
30	currents in the individual filter branches allows coupling<br>
	the filter branches and decreasing and/or eliminating flow<br>
	components in the three-phase filter core in a particularly<br>
	advantageous manner. In the three-phase filter, there are<br>
	three phases shifted in phase position relative to one<br>
35	another by 120 degrees each. This applies to both the<br>
	voltages and the currents and the magnetic fields generated<br>
	by the currents. A superposition of all three phases here<br>
	may result in a reduction of the magnetic field or the<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
	magnetic flux. A three-phase layout is particularly<br>
	suitable to reduce the magnetic flux in the line filter,<br>
	the result being a reduction in the energy stored in the<br>
	filter and the mechanical setup size of the filter. The<br>
5	power dissipation, too, decreases with a sufficiently<br>
	strong decrease in the magnetic fluxes. A three-phase<br>
	layout of the filter, in connection with a conventional<br>
	three-phase supply network, also results in an even network<br>
	load, which is desirable from the point of view of energy<br>
10	supply companies. Thus, the three-phase layout of the line<br>
	filter practically is the most important case of usage and<br>
	results in considerable advantages.<br>
	In a three-phase line filter, it is preferred for each of<br>
15	the three filter branches each to include three inductances<br>
	connected in series between the respective filter input and<br>
	the respective filter output, wherein the inductances of<br>
	each branch are preferably distributed to all three legs of<br>
	a three-phase filter core. Thus, every filter branch is<br>
20	magnetically coupled to the other two filter branches. This<br>
	results in a maximum symmetry of the arrangement. Coupling<br>
	each branch to the other two branches is of particular<br>
	advantage in a three-phase layout. The reason for this is<br>
	the phase shift of 120 degrees between the individual<br>
25	branches. A coupling of a branch to only one other branch<br>
	would, due to the phase relation between the two branches<br>
	(phase difference 120 degrees), only result in a slight<br>
	decrease in the magnetic flux and in a change in the phase<br>
	position-. If, however, one branch is coupled to the other<br>
30	two branches, this will result in a considerable decrease<br>
	in the magnetic flux, the original phase position being<br>
	maintained. The reduction in the magnetic flux here depends<br>
	on the intensity of the coupling to the other two branches.<br>
	It is thought to be of advantage to design the coupling<br>
35	intensity to the other two branches to be equal. In this<br>
	case, maximum symmetry is ensured and phase deviations are<br>
	avoided.<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
	Preferably, the inductances of the first, second and third<br>
	filter branches comprise the same winding direction within<br>
	a branch and also between the branches. Such a layout<br>
	allows a current to be transferred from the filter input to<br>
5	the filter output at the smallest possible voltage drop and<br>
	the smallest possible losses. A disturbing current in<br>
	contrast which, exemplarily, represents a current harmonic<br>
	or an effect on the mains and is coupled in at the filter<br>
	output is to be dissipated via the shunt branch of the<br>
10	filter. This is made easier by the winding direction in<br>
	that a current coupled in from the output will first pass<br>
	the output-side inductances and then the shunt inductances<br>
	in the opposite direction of turning. Thus, the effective<br>
	inductance visible for a current coupled in from the output<br>
15	of the filter becomes minimal with a suitable layout of the<br>
	winding direction. A useful current coupled in at the<br>
	filter input, however, passes the input-side inductance and<br>
	the inductance of the shunt branch in an equal direction.<br>
	The effective inductance is thus maximized and the useful<br>
20	current is not shorted by the shunt branch but passed on to<br>
	the output. In this regard, establishing the direction of<br>
	winding is a considerable degree of freedom when designing<br>
	a line filter. It has been recognized that using an equal<br>
	direction of winding in all inductances is of advantage.<br>
25<br>
	Furthermore, with a three-phase layout of the line filter<br>
	it is also preferred for the inductances in the individual<br>
	filter branches to be designed as to their winding numbers<br>
	and the distribution to the legs of the three-phase core<br>
30	such that the magnetic flux in a leg, referenced to a<br>
	filter arrangement in which the inductances of a filter<br>
	branch are wound to only one leg of the three-phase filter<br>
	core, is reduced. As has been explained before, it is of<br>
	advantage to design the filter such that the magnetic flux<br>
35	in the legs of the three-phase core is as small as<br>
	possible. The mechanical setup size of the filter can be<br>
	reduced in this way. At the same time, losses are reduced.<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
	In addition, the capacitive energy storage elements can be<br>
	designed to be smaller.<br>
	In a three-phase line filter, it is also practical to<br>
5	couple capacitive energy storage means to nodes between the<br>
	longitudinal inductances of every filter branch, which are<br>
	connected in series between the filter input and the filter<br>
	output. Coupling can take place either directly or via<br>
	another inductance. Advantages of such a connection have<br>
10	already been discussed and will not be repeated here.<br>
	A star connection of capacitors or a triangular connection<br>
	of capacitors may be preferably used as energy storage<br>
	means. Both types of connection are conventional in the<br>
15	field of energy technology and can be realized at<br>
	justifiable expenses.<br>
	Furthermore, it is preferred for the line filter to be<br>
	implemented such that a current flowing at a predetermined<br>
20	useful frequency through the first, second or third<br>
	terminal of the capacitive energy storage means to be of<br>
	smaller magnitude than a fourth of the rated current and/or<br>
	designed current flowing through the first, second or third<br>
	filter input at a rated load of the filter. Such a design<br>
25	is only made possible by the inventive distribution of the<br>
	longitudinal inductances of a filter branch to several legs<br>
	of the multi-leg filter core. If the positive feedback of<br>
	the individual windings is made use of, the current flowing<br>
	in the shunt branch at the frequency of the useful current<br>
30	need only be comparatively small compared to conventional<br>
	assemblies. The usage of a smaller current through the<br>
	shunt inductance allows using a thinner wire than is<br>
	conventionally the case. Thus, at the same setup size,<br>
	considerably more windings can be used for the shunt<br>
35	inductance. Since the inductance with a predetermined core<br>
	is proportional to the square of the number of windings, a<br>
	considerably increased inductance of the shunt inductance<br>
	can be achieved. According to the present circuit concept,<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
	this results in allowing the longitudinal inductances<br>
	between the filter input and the filter output to be<br>
	reduced. This saves both setup volume and expenses.<br>
	Furthermore, by the inventive design of the current flowing<br>
5	in the energy storage means, the reactive current in no-<br>
	load operation is reduced. Thus, switching off the<br>
	capacitors in no-load operation or partial load operation<br>
	is no longer necessary as is normal in conventional filter<br>
	arrangements. Thus, a contactor is no longer necessary.<br>
10	This of course results in cost reduction. Furthermore,<br>
	driving the switching means is also superfluous, reducing<br>
	the expenses for setting up a line filter and allowing the<br>
	filter to operated in connection with any consumer with no<br>
	problems, without adjustments being necessary. Due to the<br>
15	current reduced by the inductive energy storage elements of<br>
	the shunt branches compared to conventional arrangements,<br>
	overcompensation is also reduced in no-load operation.<br>
	Thus, the guidelines of the energy supply companies with<br>
	regard to the network load can be kept to. Finally, a<br>
20	reduced current flow in the capacitive energy storage<br>
	elements requires smaller capacitances, which in turn<br>
	results in a reduction in setup volume and expenses.<br>

	Fig. 1 shows a schematic illustration of an inventive<br>
	polyphase line filter according to a first embodiment of<br>
	the present invention. The polyphase line filter in its<br>
	entirety is referenced by 10. The filter comprises a first<br>
35	filter input FE1 and a second filter input FE2, and a first<br>
	filter output FA1 and a second filter output FA2. In<br>
	addition, the filter comprises a polyphase filter core 12<br>
	including a first filter leg 14 and a second filter leg 16.<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
	A first inductance 20 is wound around the first filter leg<br>
	14 and is connected to the first filter input FE1 at the<br>
	first end. The second end of the first inductance 20 is<br>
	connected to the first filter output FAl via a second<br>
5	inductance 22 wound around the second filter leg 16 of the<br>
	polyphase filter core 12. The connection point 24 of the<br>
	first inductance 20 and the second inductance 22 is<br>
	connected to a first input 26 of a shunt branch circuit 28.<br>
	The second filter input FE2 is connected to the second<br>
10	filter output FA2 via a third inductance 30 wound around<br>
	the second leg 16 of the polyphase filter core 12 and a<br>
	fourth inductance 32 wound around the first leg 14 of the<br>
	polyphase filter core 12 and connected in series to the<br>
	third inductance 30. The connective node 34 of the third<br>
15	inductance 30 and the fourth inductance 32 is connected to<br>
	a second input 36 of the shunt branch circuit 28. It is<br>
	also to be noted that all four inductances 20, 22, 30, 32<br>
	comprise the same direction of winding.<br>
20	Continuing with the structural description, the mode of<br>
	functioning of the present circuit will be described below.<br>
	It is the task of the present circuit assembly to pass on<br>
	currents of a predetermined frequency from the first filter<br>
	input FE1 to the first filter output FAl and from the<br>
25	second filter input FE2 to the second filter output FA2.<br>
	Disturbing currents of other, in particular higher<br>
	frequencies which may be impressed on the first and second<br>
	filter outputs FAl, FA2 by a load not shown here are to be<br>
	attenuated as far as possible so that they will only cause<br>
30	small disturbances (disturbing currents) at the filter<br>
	inputs FE1, FE2. Additionally, the voltage drop across the<br>
	line filter is to be as small as possible. In addition, it<br>
	is to be noted that there is a phase shift between the<br>
	currents in the first filter branch (between the first<br>
35	filter input FE1 and the first filter output FAl) and the<br>
	second filter branch (between the second filter input FE2<br>
	and the second filter output FA2) . This is established by<br>
	the characteristics of a supply network coupled to the<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
	filter inputs FE1, FE2, and by the load connected to the<br>
	filter outputs FA1, FA2.<br>
	If there is a current flowing through the first filter<br>
5	branch, it will impress a magnetic flux in the first leg 14<br>
	of the polyphase filter core 12 by the first inductance 20.<br>
	A voltage drop across the inductance 20 forms by the<br>
	inductive effect of the first inductance 20. In addition,<br>
	the current flows through the second inductance 22 and thus<br>
10	also produces a magnetic field in the second leg 16 of the<br>
	polyphase filter core 12. Also, a voltage drop across the<br>
	second inductance 22 is the result. The shunt branch<br>
	circuit 28 is designed such that the current flowing in at<br>
	the useful frequency which is equal to the rated frequency<br>
15	of the supply network does not exceed a predetermined<br>
	quantity. This is ensured by the internal coupling of the<br>
	shunt branch circuit 28 which will not be explained in<br>
	greater detail here. The circuit of the shunt branch<br>
	circuit 28 may basically consist of inductances and<br>
20	capacitances which are implemented to represent a<br>
	sufficiently large impedance at the rated frequency.<br>
	If a current continues flowing through the second filter<br>
	branch, the third inductance 30 will produce a magnetic<br>
25	flux in the second leg 16 of the polyphase filter core 12.<br>
	Again, a voltage drop across the third inductance 30 will<br>
	be the result. In addition, a current flows through the<br>
	fourth inductance 32 and contributes to the magnetic flux<br>
	through the first filter leg 14.<br>
30<br>
	If there is a phase shift between the currents in the first<br>
	and second filter branches, there will be strong coupling<br>
	between the inductances of the first and second filter<br>
	branches. Exemplarily, the first inductance 20 produces a<br>
35	magnetic flux in the first filter leg 14 which in turn<br>
	induces a voltage in the fourth inductance 32 of the second<br>
	filter branch. If the phase difference between the currents<br>
	in the first and second filter branches is sufficiently<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
	great, the voltage induced will counteract the voltage<br>
	produced in the fourth inductance 32 by the current in the<br>
	second filter branch. The voltage drop across the second<br>
	filter branch thus decreases. Similarly, the voltage drop<br>
5	across the first filter branch decreases since,<br>
	exemplarily, a voltage is induced in the second inductance<br>
	22 due to the magnetic flux through the second filter leg<br>
	16 caused by the current flow in the second filter branch<br>
	via the third inductance 30. Considering the magnetic<br>
10	coupling of the four inductances 20, 22, 30, 32 in the<br>
	filter branches shown, considering the phase shift between<br>
	the first filter branch and the second filter branch, it<br>
	shows that the voltage drop across the first filter branch<br>
	and the second filter branch is reduced by the coupling.<br>
15<br>
	Similarly, it can be shown that with a phase shift present<br>
	between the currents in the first and second filter<br>
	branches, the entire magnetic flux in the first filter leg<br>
	14 and the second filter leg 16 is reduced. This can<br>
20	exemplarily be recognized when assuming that the current in<br>
	the first filter branch is opposite to the current in the<br>
	second filter branch. Then, the first inductance 20<br>
	exemplarily produces a magnetic flux directed in a<br>
	direction and the fourth inductance 32 produces a magnetic<br>
25	flux directed in the opposite direction. The entire<br>
	magnetic flux in the filter leg 14, 16 thus is smaller than<br>
	in an arrangement where there is no direct magnetic<br>
	coupling between the first filter branch and the second<br>
	filter branch.<br>
30<br>
	Since the entire magnetic energy in the filter core in an<br>
	inventive arrangement is smaller than in an arrangement in<br>
	which there is no direct magnetic coupling between the<br>
	filter branches, the filter core 12 can be designed to be<br>
35	correspondingly smaller. Since the energy stored in the<br>
	first, second, third and fourth inductances 20, 22, 30, 32<br>
	is smaller than in conventional arrangements, the shunt<br>
	branch circuit 28 only has to store a small amount of<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
	energy. For this reason, the devices of the shunt branch<br>
	circuit 28 which basically includes inductances and<br>
	capacitances can be designed to be smaller. This allows<br>
	cost and structural space to be saved.<br>
5<br>
	Thus, an inventive polyphase line filter 10 according to<br>
	the first embodiment of the present invention offers the<br>
	advantage that the voltage drop across the filter and the<br>
	energy stored in the filter core 12 are smaller than in<br>
10	comparable conventional filter arrangements. The shunt<br>
	branch circuit 28 of the line filter can also be designed<br>
	to be smaller, which brings about further advantages.<br>
	Finally, it is to be pointed out that the filter shown may<br>
15	also be part of a larger filter arrangement which includes<br>
	more than two inputs and outputs and in which the core<br>
	comprises more than two legs.<br>
	Fig. 2 shows a circuit diagram of an inventive three-phase<br>
20	line filter according to a second embodiment of the present<br>
	invention. The line filter in its entirety is referred to<br>
	by 110. The filter includes a first filter branch 120<br>
	connected between the first filter input LI and a first<br>
	filter output Lll, a second filter branch 122 connected<br>
25	between the second filter input L2 and the second filter<br>
	output L12, and a third filter branch 124 connected between<br>
	the third filter input L3 and the third filter output L13.<br>
	In addition, the line filter 110 includes a three-leg<br>
	filter core 130 comprising a first leg 132, a second leg<br>
30	134 and a third leg 136. The three-leg filter core may<br>
	preferably be a three-phase filter core. The first filter<br>
	branch includes a first inductance IND1, a second<br>
	inductance IND2 and a third inductance IND3 connected in<br>
	series between the first filter input Ll and the first<br>
35	filter output Lll. The first inductance IND1 is wound<br>
	around the first leg 132, the second inductance IND2 is<br>
	wound around the second filter leg 134 and the third<br>
	inductance IND3 is wound around the third filter leg 136.<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
	The second filter branch 122 is designed in analogy to the<br>
	first filter branch, a fourth inductance IND4, a fifth<br>
	inductance IND5 and a sixth inductance IND6 being connected<br>
	between the second filter input L2 and the second filter<br>
5	output L12. The fourth inductance IND4 is wound onto the<br>
	second leg 134, the fifth inductance L5 is wound onto the<br>
	third leg 136 and the sixth inductance IND6 is wound onto<br>
	the first leg 132. Finally, the third filter branch<br>
	includes a seventh inductance IND7, an eighth inductance<br>
10	IND8 and a ninth inductance IND9 connected in series<br>
	between the third filter input IND3 and the third filter<br>
	output L13. The seventh inductance IND7 is wound onto the<br>
	third leg 136, the eighth inductance IND8 is wound onto the<br>
	first leg 132 and the ninth inductance IND9 onto the second<br>
15	leg 134. In addition, the three-phase line filter 110<br>
	includes shunt inductances IND10, IND11, IND12 and<br>
	capacitive energy storage means 150 having a first terminal<br>
15	2, a second terminal 154 and a third terminal 156. The<br>
	tenth inductance IND10 is associated to the first filter<br>
20	branch 120. It is connected to a node at which the first<br>
	inductance IND1 and the second inductance IND2 are coupled<br>
	to each other. In addition, the tenth inductance IND10 is<br>
	connected to the first terminal 152 of the capacitive<br>
	energy storage means 150. Similarly, the second filter<br>
25	branch 122 includes an eleventh inductance IND11 connected<br>
	between the node where the fourth inductance IND4 and the<br>
	fifth inductance IND5 are connected to each other, and the<br>
	second terminal 154 of the capacitive energy storage means<br>
	150. Finally, the third filter branch 124 includes a<br>
30	twelfth inductance IND12 connected between the common node<br>
	of the seventh inductance IND7 and the eighth inductance<br>
	IND8 and the third terminal 156 of the capacitive energy<br>
	storage means 150. The capacitive energy storage means 150<br>
	includes three capacitors Cl, C2, C3 connected in a star<br>
35	connection.<br>
	In addition, it is to be noted that the mechanical<br>
	arrangement of the individual inductances and the direction<br><br>
- 19 -<br>
	of winding are predetermined. On the first leg 132, the<br>
	first inductance IND1, the eighth inductance IND8 and the<br>
	sixth inductance IND6 are applied in this order. The second<br>
	leg 134 carries the fourth inductance IND4, the second<br>
5	inductance IND2 and the ninth inductance IND9. Finally, the<br>
	third leg carries the seventh inductance IND7, then the<br>
	fifth inductance IND5 and finally the third inductance<br>
	IND3. The direction of winding of all inductances is<br>
	selected to be the same. The precise wiring of the<br>
10	inductances including the direction of winding can be seen<br>
	in Fig. 2.<br>
	Furthermore, it is to be pointed out that the first, second<br>
	and third inputs LI, L2 and L3 serve as a mains<br>
15	connections. The first, second and third filter outputs<br>
	Lll, L12, L13 serve as apparatus connecting points. It is<br>
	assumed for the further discussion that the line filter 110<br>
	is designed to be symmetrical for all phases. Thus, the<br>
	input-side inductances IND1, IND4, IND7 will in the<br>
20	following explanations uniformly be referred to as<br>
	inductance L(A). The inductances IND2, IND5, IND8<br>
	downstream of the input inductances IND1, IND4, IND7 are<br>
	also designed to be the same and will subsequently be<br>
	referred to as inductance L(Bα). The output-side<br>
25	inductances IND3, IND6, IND9 are referred to as inductance<br>
	L(Bp) . Finally, the shunt inductances IND10, IND11, IND12<br>
	are collectively referred to as inductance L(C).<br>
	Subsequently, the basic mode of functioning and the<br>
30	calculation of a harmonic filter will be described. This is<br>
	shown referring to the three-phase line filter 110<br>
	according to Fig. 2. Of course, it is also possible to<br>
	understand or check different variations of the circuit<br>
	assembly in analogy to the circuit described here.<br>
35<br>
	Subsequently, the calculation of the filter will be<br>
	discussed at first. As a starting point for the<br>
	calculation, the voltage drop across the longitudinal<br><br>
- 20 -<br>
	inductance LA as a relative shorting voltage uK is to be<br>
	established. The uK value of LA can be chosen within a<br>
	wider range. Typically, the values should be between 10%<br>
	and 30%. Generally, it applies that increasing the<br>
5	longitudinal inductance LA can result in an improvement in<br>
	the entire THDI value (total harmonic distortion at the<br>
	input). Increasing the longitudinal inductance LA also<br>
	brings about a higher voltage drop across the entire filter<br>
	and thus capacitance value changes.<br>
10<br>
	The input-side inductance LA which is also referred to as<br>
	L(A) is calculated from the predetermined rated current of<br>
	the harmonic filter 110. Given the ratios LA/LB &gt; 1 and<br>
	LA/LC &gt; 1, the remaining inductance values of the<br>
15	inductances LB and Lc can be calculated. Here, LB is the<br>
	output-side longitudinal inductance of the filter and Lc is<br>
	the shunt inductance of the filter 110. The output-side<br>
	longitudinal inductance here is subdivided into two<br>
	inductances LBα and LBβ. It is to be pointed out here that<br>
20	LBα is also referred to as L(Bα), and LBβ as L(Bβ) . The<br>
	inductance LA and the ratios LA/LB and LA/LC may exemplarily<br>
	be established using empirical findings. The quantities<br>
	established are at first guide quantities to indicate a<br>
	suitable three-phase iron core. The setting of the ratios<br>
25	LA/LB and/or LA/LC can be optimized by means of computer<br>
	simulation. Depending on the application, different ratios<br>
	are to be chosen.<br>
	The energy contents required of a three-phase iron core<br>
30	choke can be calculated from the three inductance values<br>
	LA, LB and Lc, LB consisting of LBα and LBβ. This is where<br>
	all the considerable advantages of the invention become<br>
	obvious. The entire energy contents necessary equals the<br>
	difference of the square of the rated current Ir multiplied<br>
35	by the input-side inductance LA and the square of the rated<br>
	current Ir multiplied by the output-side inductance LB,<br>
	plus the square of 0.25 x Ir multiplied by Lc. This is true<br>
	although the current flowing through the two output-side<br><br>
- 21 -<br>
	inductances LBα and LBβ in reality is somewhat smaller than<br>
	the rated current Ir (input current) of the harmonic<br>
	filter. The reduction of the effective energy contents of a<br>
	choke in which the input-side inductance LA of a filter<br>
5	branch is wound onto a leg of a three-phase iron core and<br>
	in which the windings of the output-side inductances LBα<br>
	LBβ are applied onto the other legs of the three-phase iron<br>
	core can be recognized from this calculation. Partly<br>
	eliminating flow components results in an overall energy<br>
10	content required smaller than in an embodiment in which the<br>
	input-side inductance LA and the output-side inductance LB<br>
	of a filter branch are wound onto the same leg of a three-<br>
	phase iron core. In an inventive distribution of the<br>
	windings, the result will be a difference of Ir^2*LA and<br>
15	Ir ^2*LB forming.<br>
	A correct core size for the three-phase iron core can be<br>
	selected using the data obtained in this way. The<br>
	calculation of the AL value is known from literature and<br>
20	will not be explained here. If the AL value of the iron<br>
	core is known, the actual calculation of the line filter<br>
	110 can be performed.<br>
	For the calculation, the filter arrangement will be<br>
25	described in both a π equivalent circuit diagram and in a T<br>
	equivalent circuit diagram. The inductances LA, LBα, LBβ and<br>
	Lc are arranged in T circuits. They can be recalculated to<br>
	the inductances in the n circuit, the inductances of the π<br>
	circuit being referred to as Lx (longitudinal inductance),<br>
30	LY (first shunt inductance) and Lz (second shunt<br>
	inductance). The following is true:<br>
	Lx = (Nx)^2 * AL<br>
	Lx = (NY)^2 * AL								(1)<br>
35	Lx = (Nz)^2 * AL<br>
	Nx, NY, Nz being the winding numbers of the inductances Lx,<br>
	Ly, L2 recalculated in the π circuit.<br><br>
- 22 -<br>
	In addition, it is possible to recalculate the winding<br>
	numbers Nx, Ny, Nz of the inductances in the n circuit to<br>
	the winding numbers NA, NBα, NBβ and Nc of the inductances in<br>
5	the T circuit:<br><br>
10<br>
	NA, NBα, NBβ and Nc being the winding numbers of the<br>
	inductances LA, LBα, LBβ and Lc disposed in the T circuit.<br>
	The inductances LA, LBα, LBβ and Lc of the T circuit can be<br>
15	calculated from the inductances Lx, Ly and Lz of the n<br>
	circuit using the subsequent equation:<br><br>
	Assuming that the inductances of the T circuit LA, LBα, LBβ<br>
	and Lc are known, the inductance values of a n circuit can<br>
25	be determined by inversion of formula (3). Using formula<br>
	(1), the winding numbers Nx, NY, Nz of the inductances in<br>
	the π circuits can be determined. Finally, the system of<br>
	equations (2) can be inverted to calculate the winding<br>
	numbers NA, NB, Nc of the inductances in the T circuits.<br>
30	Thus, all inductances of the multiple winding choke have<br>
	been established unambiguously.<br>
	The advantage of the invention can be understood easily<br>
	using the calculation shown and/or this calculating<br>
35	example. Not only the smaller required energy contents<br>
	already described results in a considerable reduction in<br>
	the setup size, but also the utilization of the positive<br>
	feedback of the individual windings. This is why the number<br><br>
- 23 -<br>
	of windings Nc of the shunt inductance Lc can be set to be<br>
	relatively high. In an inventive line filter, this does not<br>
	to the same extent result, as has been the case in<br>
	conventional arrangements, in a choke greater as to the<br>
5	setup volume, since a smaller wire cross-section can be<br>
	used for the shunt inductance Lc than for the remaining<br>
	input-side and output-side inductances. Using another wire<br>
	cross-section and/or the reduced setup volume of the shunt<br>
	inductance results from the considerably smaller current<br>
10	flowing into the shunt branch of the harmonic filter. Since<br>
	only the harmonic currents and the capacitive reactive<br>
	current of the capacitor at the useful frequency (typically<br>
	50 Hz or 60 Hz) flow in the shunt branch of the harmonic<br>
	filter and thus through the winding of the inductance Lc,<br>
15	the effective value of the current is reduced to about 25%<br>
	of the rated current Ir of the filter. The fact that only<br>
	25% of the rated current Ir flow in the shunt inductance Lc<br>
	has the result that the overall energy of the multiple<br>
	winding choke is smaller than in a conventional filter<br>
20	design, since (0.25*Ir)^2*LC is true.<br>
	Assuming currents in the shunt branch which are about 25%<br>
	of the rated current Ir is valid for a design of the filter<br>
	to an overall THDI value (total harmonic distortion at<br>
25	input) of around 8%, i.e. in the values resulting from such<br>
	a design for the inductances LA, LBα, LBΒ and Lc and the<br>
	corresponding capacitance coupled to the inductance Lc.<br>
	With a different design of the line filter, the current in<br>
	the shunt branch will vary correspondingly.<br>
30<br>
	Basically, the input current of the harmonic filter is<br>
	nearly sinusoidal, corresponding to the field of employment<br>
	and the task of the filter. The output current of the<br>
	filter is a current having a basically block-shaped form,<br>
35	as is shown in Fig. 10. Knowing the input current and the<br>
	output current, the result is the current which has to flow<br>
	in the shunt branch of the filter. The current flow in the<br>
	shunt branch of the filter, i.e. through the inductance Lc,<br><br>
- 24 -<br>
	consists of several portions. One of these portions is the<br>
	capacitive current caused by the capacitance in the shunt<br>
	branch at the rated frequency (typically 50 Hz or 60 Hz) of<br>
	the filter flowing via the choke Lc to the capacitor<br>
5	coupled thereto. The effective value Ic_SOHZ of this current<br>
	can be calculated using the formula (5) indicated below.<br>
	Under load conditions, the difference current between the<br>
	input current and the output current of the filter is added<br>
10	to this current still sinusoidal in no-load operation of<br>
	the filter, so that the result will be an extremely non-<br>
	sinusoidal current form. This in turn means that the energy<br>
	to be transferred of the filter during the gap times of the<br>
	output current must come from the capacitances connected in<br>
15	the shunt branch of the line filter. This circumstance is a<br>
	consequence of the output current being nearly block-<br>
	shaped.<br>
	In addition, when designing the filter it must be kept in<br>
20	mind that the capacitances in the shunt branch must not be<br>
	selected to be too great to avoid an increased capacitive<br>
	reactive current in the shunt branch. When designing the<br>
	harmonic filter to a THDI value of 8%, using values for the<br>
	inductances LA, LBα, LBΒ and Lc calculated for a rated<br>
25	operation, the capacitance required for energy-bridging is<br>
	calculated from the total effective value of the current in<br>
	the shunt branch:<br><br>
	Here, Iq is the current in the shunt branch of the harmonic<br>
35	filter, IC_5OHZ is the capacitive fundamental oscillation<br>
	current in the filter capacitor with a star connection of<br>
	the capacitors, CY is the capacity of the capacitors<br>
	required in star connections, CA is the capacitance of the<br><br>
- 25 -<br>
	capacitors required in triangular circuits, UCY is the<br>
	voltage drop across a capacitor in a star connection in the<br>
	shunt branch and f is the rated frequency of the line<br>
	filter.<br>
5<br>
	The capacity calculated, with the assumptions indicated<br>
	above, is sufficient for the defined filter effect since<br>
	this capacitance value stores the very energy required<br>
	during the time interval in which the output current forms<br>
10	"gaps". By increasing the filter capacitances, slight<br>
	improvements in the THDI value can be achieved, however,<br>
	other disadvantages occur which make such an increase in<br>
	the capacitor value mostly appear undesirable.<br>
15	The fine tuning between the individual inductances of the<br>
	multiple choke and the size of the capacitor provides for<br>
	an optimum filter effect. However, the principle effect of<br>
	the harmonic filter is uninfluenced by this fine tuning,<br>
	even with extremely unfavorable selected inductance ratios<br>
20	among one another and/or in connection with the filter<br>
	capacitor coupled thereto. This means that the actual<br>
	invention, namely eliminating flow components in the three-<br>
	phase iron core by the appropriate arrangement of the<br>
	windings on the three-phase core, in principle will always<br>
25	remain and always result in a choke reduced in setup<br>
	volume. The overall setup volume and the capacitance values<br>
	necessary, however, can be reduced further by means of an<br>
	optimized filter adjustment. Computer-aided simulations and<br>
	very precise measuring equipment may serve as an aid here.<br>
30<br>
	When looking at the input and output currents of the filter<br>
	exemplarily illustrated in Fig. 10 in greater detail,<br>
	another advantage of the inventive line filter assembly<br>
	becomes obvious. The current flowing in a connected<br>
35	consumer, preferably an appliance having an internal B6<br>
	rectification and capacitor smoothing, provides for a very<br>
	small ripple current in the internal smoothing capacitors<br>
	of the consumer due to its block-shaped form. In particular<br><br>
- 26 -<br>
	when connecting driving systems, this results in an<br>
	increased lifetime of the electrolytic capacitors installed<br>
	and thus in a longer lifetime of the appliance.<br>
5	The advantages of an inventive circuit can thus be<br>
	recognized by means of an analysis of an inventive line<br>
	filter 110, wherein in particular the fact is made use of<br>
	that a single-phase equivalent circuit diagram can be<br>
	constructed by means of well-known methods relative to a<br>
10	three-phase circuit assembly. Here, the possibility of<br>
	converting π circuits to T circuits and vice versa has been<br>
	made use of.<br>
	Fig. 3 shows a circuit diagram of an inventive three-phase<br>
15	line filter according to a third embodiment of the present<br>
	invention. The line filter, in its entirety, is referred to<br>
	by 210. The setup and mode of functioning of the line<br>
	filter 210 only differ slightly from the setup and mode of<br>
	functioning of the line filter 110 shown in Fig. 2, so that<br>
20	only differing features will be described here. In<br>
	particular, it is to be pointed out that same reference<br>
	numerals will here and in all following figures refer to<br>
	same elements.<br>
25	Fig. 3 particularly shows the geometrical assembly of shunt<br>
	inductances IND10, IND11, IND12 on the legs of the filter<br>
	core. The shunt inductance IND10 corresponding to the first<br>
	filter branch 120 here is wound onto the first leg 132. The<br>
	shunt inductance IND11 corresponding to the second filter<br>
30	branch 122 is wound onto the second leg 124 of the filter<br>
	core. The shunt inductance IND12 corresponding to the third<br>
	filter branch 134 is wound onto the third leg 136 of the<br>
	filter core. Such a winding has the result that the shunt<br>
	inductances IND10, IND11, IND12 are strongly coupled to the<br>
35	input-side longitudinal inductances INDl, IND4, IND7 of the<br>
	respective filter branches. Since the shunt inductances<br>
	IND10, IND11, IND12 comprise the same direction of winding<br>
	as the corresponding input-side longitudinal inductances<br><br>
- 27 -<br>
	IND1, IND4, IND7, the input-side longitudinal inductances<br>
	IND1, IND4, IND7 and the shunt inductances IND10, IND11,<br>
	IND12 are connected in series regarding an input current<br>
	flowing into the filter at the filter inputs LI, L2, L3 and<br>
5	thus represent a high inductance. This reduces the<br>
	dissipation of the input current via the shunt branch and<br>
	thus reduces reactive currents emerging in the line filter<br>
	210.<br>
10	The further mode of functioning of the filter 210 remains<br>
	unchanged relative to the filter 110 shown in Fig. 2 so<br>
	that a description thereof is omitted.<br>
	Fig. 4 shows a circuit diagram of an inventive three-phase<br>
15	line filter according to a fourth embodiment of the present<br>
	invention. This is very similar to the filters shown in<br>
	Figs. 2 and 3 so that only the differences will be<br>
	described here. The line filter 210 shown in Fig. 3 will be<br>
	used here as a reference for the description. The present<br>
20	line filter is referred to by 260. Again, same reference<br>
	numerals indicate same units like in the embodiments<br>
	described before.<br>
	The structure of the line filter 260 remains unchanged<br>
25	compared to the line filter 210. Only the mechanical<br>
	position of the output-side inductances IND2, IND5, IND8<br>
	and IND3, IND6, IND9 on the legs 132, 134, 136. of the<br>
	filter core is different. The order of the inductances<br>
	referenced to the current flow from the filter input to the<br>
30	filter output thus remains unchanged in the filter 260<br>
	compared to the filter 210. Thus, exemplarily, inductances<br>
	INDl, IND2 and IND3 in this very order are disposed in the<br>
	first filter branch 120 between the filter input Ll and the<br>
	filter output Lll. A similar situation applies to the<br>
35	second filter branch 122 and the third filter branch 124.<br>
	However, what is changed in the line filter 260 compared to<br>
	the line filter 210 is the mechanical arrangement of the<br>
	inductances on the filter legs. In an unchanged manner,<br><br>
- 28 -<br>
	however, the inductances IND1 and IND10 are on the first<br>
	filter leg 132, the inductances IND4 and IND11 are on the<br>
	second filter leg and the inductances IND7 and IND12 are on<br>
	the third filter leg. However, what is changed is the<br>
5	arrangement of the output-side inductances. The inductance<br>
	IND2 of the first filter branch now is on the third filter<br>
	leg 136 and the inductance IND3 of the first filter branch<br>
	120 is on the second filter leg 134. In addition, what is<br>
	changed is the arrangement of the inductance IND5 of the<br>
10	second filter branch 122 which in the filter 260 is wound<br>
	onto the first leg 132, and the inductance IND6 of the<br>
	second filter branch 122 which is now wound onto the third<br>
	leg 136. Finally, the inductance IND8 of the third filter<br>
	branch 124 is wound onto the second leg 134 and the<br>
15	inductance IND9 onto the first leg 132.<br>
	A changed mechanical arrangement of the inductances on the<br>
	filter legs leaves the characteristics of the line filter<br>
	260 essentially unchanged, but represents another<br>
20	embodiment which may be of mechanical advantage, depending<br>
	on the circumstances.<br>
	Fig. 5 shows a circuit diagram of an inventive three-phase<br>
	line filter according to the fifth embodiment of the<br>
25	present invention. The line filter shown in its entirety is<br>
	referred to by 310. The line filter 310, too, is very<br>
	similar with regard to setup and mode of functioning to the<br>
	line filter 210 shown in Fig. 3. Thus, only the differences<br>
	will be- explained below. Same reference numerals again<br>
30	designate same elements.<br>
	In the line filter 310, coupling of the shunt branch does<br>
	not take place between the first and second inductances<br>
	IND1, IND2; IND4, IND5; IND7, IND8 of each filter branch<br>
35	(counted starting from the filter input), but between the<br>
	second and third inductances IND2, IND3; IND5, IND6; IND8,<br>
	IND9. The first filter branch 120 is to be taken for a more<br>
	detailed discussion. The shunt inductance IND10 of the<br><br>
- 29 -<br>
	first filter branch 120 is now coupled between the<br>
	inductance IND2 and the inductance IND3. As to further<br>
	wiring, in particular the distribution of the inductances<br>
	to the legs, there are no differences between the line<br>
5	filters 210 and 310.<br>
	The line filters 210 and 310 do not differ considerably as<br>
	to their basic characteristics. However, differences may<br>
	arise in dimensioning, i.e. the design of the inductances<br>
10	and/or capacitances. Depending on the requirements and the<br>
	mechanical circumstances, a filter arrangement 210<br>
	according to Fig. 3 or a filter arrangement 310 according<br>
	to Fig. 5 may be of greater advantage.<br>
15	Fig. 6 shows a circuit diagram of an inventive three-phase<br>
	line filter according to a sixth embodiment of the present<br>
	invention. As to its basic setup and its mode of<br>
	functioning, the filter corresponds to the filters shown in<br>
	Figs. 2 to 5, so that again reference is made to the<br>
20	description thereof. Same reference numerals characterize<br>
	same elements like in the line filters described before.<br>
	The line filter shown in Fig. 6 is referred to in its<br>
	entirety by 360. As to the distribution of the inductances<br>
	on the filter cores, it corresponds to the line filter 260<br>
25	shown in Fig. 4. However, the shunt branches, similarly to<br>
	the line filter 310 described in Fig. 5, branch off between<br>
	the second and third inductances IND2, IND3; IND5, IND6;<br>
	IND8, IND9 of every filter branch 120, 122, 124.<br>
30	Again, such an embodiment represents an alternative to the<br>
	filter 260 shown in Fig. 4 and the filter 310 shown in Fig.<br>
	5. The characteristics basically remain unchanged, however<br>
	different dimensioning of the inductances and capacities is<br>
	required again.<br>
35<br>
	Fig. 7 shows a circuit diagram of an inventive three-phase<br>
	line filter according to a seventh embodiment of the<br>
	present invention. The filter, in its entirety, is referred<br><br>
- 30 -<br>
	to by 410 and is based on the filter 210 shown in Fig. 3.<br>
	Same reference numerals again characterize same elements.<br>
	Characteristics of the filter 410 remaining unchanged<br>
	compared to the filter 210 are not described again. Rather,<br>
5	reference is made to the description of the filter 210<br>
	and/or the filter 110.<br>
	Compared to the filter 210, the filter 410 is supplemented<br>
	by introducing a second shunt branch. This includes the<br>
10	inductances IND13, IND14 and IND15 and second capacitive<br>
	energy storage means 420 including three capacitances C4,<br>
	C5, C6. The second capacitive energy storage means 420<br>
	comprises a first terminal 422, a second terminal 424 and a<br>
	third terminal 426. Also, it is to be pointed out that the<br>
15	inductances of the first shunt branch will in summary be<br>
	referred to as L(C1), whereas the inductances IND13, IND14<br>
	and IND15 of the second shunt branch will in summary be<br>
	referred to by L(C2). The inductance IND13 of the second<br>
	shunt branch is connected to the node point between the<br>
20	second inductance IND2 and the third inductance IND3 of the<br>
	first filter branch 120 and to the first terminal 422 of<br>
	the second capacitive energy storage means 420. The<br>
	inductance IND13 of the second shunt branch of the first<br>
	filter branch 120 is wound onto the first leg 132. The<br>
25	direction of winding here is the same as in all other<br>
	inductances.<br>
	In analogy to the inductance IND13 of the first filter<br>
	branch, the inductances IND14 and IND15 of the second and<br>
30	third filter branches are connected and wound onto the<br>
	second and third legs 134 and 136, respectively, of the<br>
	three-phase filter core. The details of the connection can<br>
	be seen in Fig. 7.<br>
35	A line filter 410 comprising a second shunt branch may be<br>
	designed to achieve a better filter effect than a line<br>
	filter having only one filter branch. In particular, the<br>
	shunt branches can be dimensioned to suppress two undesired<br><br>
- 31 -<br>
	frequencies. All in all, there are more degrees of freedom<br>
	in the filter design since the filter is of a higher filter<br>
	order. Thus, the complexity for realizing a line filter<br>
	having two shunt branches is increased, since additional<br>
5	shunt inductances IND13, IND14, IND15 and additional<br>
	capacitances C4, C5, C6 are necessary. However, depending<br>
	on the requirements, it is practical to use a filter having<br>
	only one shunt branch or a filter 410 having two shunt<br>
	branches.<br>
10<br>
	Fig. 8 shows a circuit diagram of an inventive three-phase<br>
	line filter according to an eighth embodiment of the<br>
	present invention. Basically, this filter corresponds to<br>
	the line filter 410 shown in Fig. 7, wherein the<br>
15	inductances in the longitudinal branch are connected like<br>
	in the filter 260 shown in Fig. 4 instead of like in the<br>
	filter 210 shown in Fig. 3. Thus, the filter 460 is only<br>
	another alternative which may be used depending on the<br>
	requirements and the mechanical circumstances.<br>
20<br>
	Fig. 9 shows a circuit diagram of an inventive three-phase<br>
	line filter according to a ninth embodiment of the present<br>
	invention which, in its entirety, is referred to by 510.<br>
	The filter basically corresponds to the line filters 210<br>
25	and 260 shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively, so that means<br>
	remaining unchanged are not described again. Rather,<br>
	reference is made to the description above. In particular,<br>
	same reference numerals indicate same elements. The filter<br>
	510 is changed compared to the filter 210 in that the<br>
30	energy storage means 150' includes a triangular connection<br>
	of capacitors Cl', C2' and C3'. A triangular connection of<br>
	capacitors, compared to a star connection, as is shown in<br>
	the line filter 210, offers the advantage that the<br>
	capacitors need to have a smaller capacitance. However, it<br>
35	is necessary for the capacitors of a triangular connection<br>
	to be of higher dielectric strength than the capacitors of<br>
	a star connection. Finally, when using a triangular<br><br>
- 32 -<br>
	connection, it is not possible to ground a terminal of the<br>
	capacitors.<br>
	Thus, it is again dependent on the application and the<br>
5	requirements whether a star connection of capacitors or a<br>
	triangular connection of capacitors is of more advantage.<br>
	The line filters shown can be changed to a great extent<br>
	without departing from the central idea of the invention.<br>
10	Exemplarily, it is possible to use only one longitudinal<br>
	inductance (such as, for example, IND2, IND5 and IND8) in<br>
	each filter branch on the output side and to dispense with<br>
	the second inductance (such as, for example, IND3, IND6,<br>
	IND9) . With such a filter, complete symmetry is no longer<br>
15	ensured, however it still has advantages compared to a<br>
	conventional filter in which all inductances of a filter<br>
	branch are arranged on the same leg of the filter core.<br>
	In addition, it is possible to wind the shunt inductances<br>
20	IND10, IND11, IND12 and, maybe, IND13, IND14, IND15 of a<br>
	filter branch onto a different leg 132, 134, 136 of the<br>
	filter core than the input-side inductance IND1, IND2,<br>
	IND3. Such an exchange offers another degree of freedom<br>
	when designing and implementing a line filter.<br>
25<br>
	It is also possible without any problems to supplement a<br>
	line filter by other filter stages and thus to achieve a<br>
	higher-order filter. This, however, is more complicated in<br>
	manufacturing, but offers an improved filter characteristic<br>
30	with a suitable design. This may be necessary if<br>
	requirements on the filter effect are high.<br>
	Furthermore, it is also possible to add additional<br>
	capacitances or inductances to the filter. Exemplarily,<br>
35	several shunt branches may be coupled to a connecting point<br>
	between two longitudinal inductances arranged between the<br>
	filter input and the filter output. A shunt branch here may<br>
	include not only a series connection of an inductance and a<br><br>
- 33 -<br>
	capacitive energy storage element but also a capacitance<br>
	itself. This may be helpful to suppress high-frequency<br>
	disturbances, provided the capacitance is designed such<br>
	that a capacitive reactive current at the rated frequency<br>
5	of the line filter is sufficiently small.<br>
	Furthermore, the filter can include switching means<br>
	allowing the filter to be adjusted to different operating<br>
	states. Thus, it can be of advantage to switch off shunt<br>
10	capacitances. It may also be desirable to bridge individual<br>
	inductances. Thus, the voltage drop across the filter<br>
	and/or a reactive current portion produced by the filter<br>
	can be influenced. This may be of advantage when very<br>
	strong load changes may occur or when the filter is to be<br>
15	configurable for a number of operating cases.<br>
	Finally, there is great flexibility when designing the<br>
	polyphase filter core. In principle, all the core types<br>
	available may be used, exemplarily cores made of iron or<br>
20	iron powder.<br>
	Fig. 10 shows an oscillogram of current forms at the<br>
	network input and the output of an inventive line filter<br>
	according to the filter shown in Figs. 2 and/or 3. The<br>
25	oscillogram, in its entirety, is referred to by 610. It<br>
	indicates a first curve shape 620 representing the current<br>
	form at the input of the inventive line filter. Time is<br>
	plotted on the abscissa t, whereas the input current is<br>
	plotted on the ordinate I. Similarly, the oscillogram shows<br>
30	a second curve shape 630 representing the output current at<br>
	the output of the inventive line filter. Again, time is<br>
	plotted on the abscissa t, whereas the current is plotted<br>
	on the ordinate I.<br>
35	For the measurement, an inventive line filter is wired to a<br>
	three-phase load comprising an internal B6 rectification<br>
	and capacitor smoothing. The input current of the line<br>
	filter which is described by the signal shape 620 is<br><br>
- 34 -<br>
	basically sinusoidal. The output current described by the<br>
	curve shape 630, however, is nearly block-shaped. The<br>
	current shape at the filter output indicates a very steep<br>
	increase and a very steep drop in the current, whereas the<br>
5	current for great current values is nearly constant. In the<br>
	region of the zero crossing, the current only changes<br>
	slightly over time, so that the current flow for a time<br>
	interval of around 2 ms (at a period duration of 20 ms) is<br>
	nearly constant.<br>
10<br>
	It is also to be mentioned here that the current shape<br>
	shown has a period duration of around 20 ms, corresponding<br>
	to a frequency of 50 Hz. The amplitude of the current is<br>
	around 250 amperes.<br>
15<br>
	It shows that the current flowing in the connected consumer<br>
	may result, due to its block-shaped form, in a very small<br>
	ripple current in the internal capacitors of the consumer.<br>
	This may result in an increased lifetime of the<br>
20	electrolytic capacitors in the consumer and thus in an<br>
	increased lifetime of the consumer appliance connected<br>
	thereto.<br>
	In summary, it can be noted that the present invention<br>
25	describes a passive harmonic filter consisting of a<br>
	combination of an intelligently connected multiple winding<br>
	choke and several electrical capacitors and serving a<br>
	significant reduction in current harmonics at the input of<br>
	non-linear consumers.<br>
30<br>
	The effects on the networks produced by non-linear<br>
	consumers frequently result in disturbances in the public<br>
	supply network or mains. The passive harmonic filter<br>
	described above serves to significantly reduce the current<br>
35	harmonics of non-linear consumers, in particular of<br>
	electronical appliances having internal B2 or B6 rectifier<br>
	circuits and subsequent smoothing by capacitors or by a<br>
	combination of capacitors and chokes. Electronical<br><br>
- 35 -<br>
	appliances of this kind are preferably used in electrical<br>
	driving systems. The special characteristic of the<br>
	invention is the combination of a multiple winding choke<br>
	and a unique wiring of the windings among one another and a<br>
5	connection of capacitors. The nearly sinusoidal current<br>
	consumption achieved by this at the input of the line<br>
	filter when coupling to non-linear consumers at the filter<br>
	output is achieved by the inventive special technology<br>
	entailing a minimum of setup volume and power dissipation.<br>
10	The inventive skillful wiring of different windings onto a<br>
	magnetic core utilizes the magnetic characteristics of<br>
	choke by eliminating different flow components in<br>
	connection with the energy provided from capacitors. The<br>
	resulting sinusoidal current consumption at the filter<br>
15	input is basically load-independent.<br>
	The harmonic filter is connected between the supplying<br>
	mains voltage and the respective electronic appliance and<br>
	is thus also referred to as front-end harmonic filter. An<br>
20	input-side parallel connection of several consumers is<br>
	possible under certain conditions and is referred to as<br>
	group compensation and/or group filter.<br>
	The harmonic filter consists of a multiple winding choke in<br>
25	which all windings are wound in the same direction of<br>
	winding and distributed over the phases to the different<br>
	legs of a magnetic three-phased iron core. Thus, at least<br>
	one winding of one phase (exemplarily phase LI) is always<br>
	wound onto a different leg than the remaining windings. The<br>
30	capacitors connected can be coupled at least to one or<br>
	several connective points of the windings.<br>
	The resulting filter circuit reduces current harmonics at<br>
	the input of the filter considerably and at the same time<br>
35	provides for a smoothed direct current downstream of the<br>
	rectifier. A strongly reduced ripple current in the<br>
	downstream smoothing capacitors is achieved by this.<br><br>
- 36 -<br>
	Disadvantages of well-known harmonic filters are reduced to<br>
	a minimum in an inventive line filter. The technical<br>
	characteristics are thus improved considerably compared to<br>
	present solutions. Due to its small setup volume, its small<br>
5	power dissipation and low expense, an inventive harmonic<br>
	filter is an attractive and marketable filter for reducing<br>
	current harmonics.<br>
	The distribution of the individual windings onto at least<br>
10	two legs or more of a three-phase magnetic iron core<br>
	results in a reduction in the effective voltage drop in the<br>
	longitudinal branch of the filter. In addition, an<br>
	elimination of individual flow components is achieved by<br>
	the skillful distribution of the windings onto at least one<br>
15	or more legs of the three-phase iron core. This does not<br>
	only reduce the voltage drop at the longitudinal branch of<br>
	the filter, but also the capacitors connected in the shunt<br>
	branch can be reduced considerably since the energy to be<br>
	provided from the capacitors decreases. This in turn<br>
20	results in a smaller capacitive reactive current in no-load<br>
	operation or under partial load conditions. Switching off<br>
	the capacitances is no longer required in most<br>
	applications. By a computer-aided calculation and knowledge<br>
	obtained by means of measuring technology, the values of<br>
25	the individual inductances of the multiple winding choke<br>
	can be optimized precisely and tuned to one another. The<br>
	result is a smaller winding complexity and thus smaller<br>
	losses. In addition, the relation of the individual<br>
	inductances to the capacitors connected can be established<br>
30	precisely by the calculations mentioned to find an optimum<br>
	and keep the oscillation tendency of the filter system very<br>
	low.<br>
	A filter according to Figs. 2 or 3 and/or according to<br>
35	Figs. 4 to 9 comprises at least one winding per phase on a<br>
	different leg of the three-phase magnetic core than the<br>
	remaining windings and has at least one capacitor connected<br>
	per phase. The capacitors may be wired in a star or in a<br><br>
- 37 -<br>
	triangle. In a particularly advantageous filter, all<br>
	windings have the same winding direction. Thus, the winding<br>
	direction can be positive or negative in all windings. This<br>
	does not change the actual function of the inventive<br>
5	principle. The windings have the same direction of winding<br>
	on every leg, i.e. also within the three phases LI, L2, L3.<br>
	A multiple winding choke according to Fig. 3 has at least<br>
	four or more windings per phase, wherein at least one<br>
	winding (or more) per phase is wound onto a different leg<br>
10	of the three-phase iron core than the remaining windings.<br>
	Put differently, at least one winding per phase is on a leg<br>
	of the three-phase iron core which, according to<br>
	definition, belongs to a different phase. Iron powder or<br>
	any other material may be used for the iron core instead of<br>
15	iron.<br>
	The capacitors can be connected on the free side of the<br>
	inductance in the shunt branch, at any connective point<br>
	between the inductances in the longitudinal branch and the<br>
20	shunt branch. Capacitors can be connected either only once<br>
	per phase or several times per phase when there are several<br>
	connective points. It is to be pointed out in this respect<br>
	that two connective points as a minimum will always be<br>
	there. Furthermore, the capacitors may also be connected to<br>
25	all inductances of the shunt branches available. The<br>
	capacitors may be connected to the inductances in the shunt<br>
	branch either in a star or a triangle.<br>
	The wiring of the windings in the same direction of winding<br>
30	will only result in a technological advantage if an<br>
	elimination of flow components takes place within the<br>
	magnetic core. These are flow components which<br>
	predominantly contain higher-frequency portions (having a<br>
	frequency higher than the frequency of the supplying mains<br>
35	voltage of the filter). The mechanical three-phase setup of<br>
	the magnetic core is utilized here in connection with the<br>
	phase shift of the three phases LI, L2 and L3.<br><br>
