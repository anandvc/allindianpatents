				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an antenna arrangement comprising means for providing<br>
an approximation of a constant current electrical loop, which approximation of a constant<br>
current electrical loop is arranged to provide a first essentially toroid-shaped radiation<br>
pattern, where the antenna arrangement further comprises a first and a second electrical<br>
dipole, which electrical dipoles are arranged essentially orthogonal to each other, and are<br>
arranged to provide a second and third essentially toroid-shaped radiation pattern which<br>
each is essentially orthogonal to the other and to the first essentially toroid-shaped<br>
radiation pattern.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The demand for wireless communication systems has grown steadily, and is still growing,<br>
and a number of technological advancement steps have been taken during this growth. In<br>
order to acquire increased system capacity for wireless systems by employing uncorrelated<br>
propagation paths, MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) systems have been considered<br>
to constitute a preferred technology for improving the capacity. MIMO employs a number<br>
of separate independent signal paths, for example by means of several transmitting and<br>
receiving antennas. The desired result is to have a number of uncorrelated antenna ports<br>
for receiving as well as transmitting.<br>
For MIMO it is desired to estimate the channel and continuously update this estimation.<br>
This updating may be performed by means of continuously transmitting so-called pilot<br>
signals in a previously known manner. The estimation of the channel results in a channel<br>
matrix. If a number of transmitting antennas Tx transmit signals, constituting a transmitted<br>
signal vector, towards a number of receiving antennas Rx, all Tx signals are summated in<br>
each one of the Rx antennas, and by means of linear combination, a received signal vector<br>
is formed. By multiplying the received signal vector with the inverted channel matrix, the<br>
channel is compensated for and the original information is acquired, i.e. if the exact<br>
channel matrix is known, it is possible to acquire the exact transmitted signal vector. The<br>
channel matrix thus acts as a coupling between the antenna ports of the Tx and Rx<br>
antennas, respectively. These matrixes are of the size MxN, where M is the number of<br>
2<br><br>
inputs (antenna ports) of the Tx antenna and N is the number of outputs (antenna ports) of<br>
the Rx antenna. This is previously known for the skilled person in the MIMO system field.<br>
In order for a MIMO system to function efficiently, uncorrelated, or at least essentially<br>
uncorrelated, transmitted signals are required. The meaning of the term "uncorrelated<br>
signals" in this context is that the radiation patterns are essentially orthogonal. This is<br>
made possible for one antenna if that antenna is made for receiving and transmitting in at<br>
least two orthogonal polarizations. If more than two orthogonal polarizations are to be<br>
utilized for one antenna, it is necessary that it is used in a so-called rich scattering<br>
environment having a plurality of independent propagation paths, since it otherwise is not<br>
possible to have benefit from more than two orthogonal polarizations. A rich scattering<br>
environment is considered to occur when many electromagnetic waves co-incide at a<br>
single point in space. Therefore, in a rich scattering environment, more than two<br>
orthogonal polarizations can be utilized since the plurality of independent propagation<br>
paths enables all the degrees of freedom of the antenna to be utilized.<br>
Antennas for MIMO systems may utilize spatial separation, i.e. physical separation, in<br>
order to achieve low correlation between the received signals at the antenna ports. This,<br>
however, results in big arrays that are unsuitable for e.g. hand-held terminals. One other<br>
way to achieve uncorrelated signals is by means of polarization separation, i.e. generally<br>
sending and receiving signals with orthogonal polarizations.<br>
It has then been suggested to use three orthogonal dipoles for a MIMO antenna with three<br>
ports, but such an antenna is complicated to manufacture and requires a lot of space when<br>
used at higher frequencies, such as those used for the MIMO system (about 2 GHz).<br>
In US 2002/0113748, two preferably orthogonally arranged dipoles and a loop element is<br>
disclosed. As shown in Figure 5 of said application, the loop element is in the form of a<br>
ring, fed at a certain point in the ring.<br>
As the diameter of the loop element is suggested to be up to one wavelength at the<br>
working frequency, it is thus indicated that the loop may be several wavelengths long.<br>
3<br><br>
However, in order to acquire a radiation pattern that is essentially orthogonal to the dipole<br>
patterns using the antenna arrangement according to US 2002/0113748, one method is to<br>
use a small loop. Such a small loop should have a diameter of about a tenth wavelength at<br>
the working frequency, resulting in an approximation of a constant current electrical loop<br>
element. Using a constant current electrical loop, or at least a sufficient approximation<br>
thereof, is an advantageous method to acquire a radiation pattern that is essentially<br>
orthogonal to the dipole patterns.<br>
Although not proposed explicitly in US 2002/0113748, such a small loop antenna could be<br>
deduced from said document. Said small loop antenna is, however, quite narrow-banded<br>
and hence difficult to match properly since it has a high reactive resistance and a low<br>
resistive resistance. Further, such a small loop antenna is considerably smaller than the<br>
adjacent dipole antennas, resulting in an awkward construction.<br>
There is thus a problem with the antenna arrangement according to US 2002/0113748,<br>
since the loop element has to be very small in order to function as a sufficient<br>
approximation of a constant current loop element.<br>
The objective problem that is solved by the present invention is to provide an antenna<br>
arrangement suitable for a MIMO system, which antenna arrangement is capable of<br>
sending and receiving in three essentially uncorrelated polarizations, and should comprise<br>
two essentially orthogonal dipoles and an approximation of constant current electrical loop<br>
element. The approximation of the constant current electrical loop element should further<br>
be easily matched and have a large bandwidth compared to what may be concluded from<br>
prior art solutions.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
This objective problem is solved by means of an antenna arrangement according to the<br>
introduction, which antenna arrangement further is characterized in that the means for<br>
approximation of the constant current electrical loop comprises at least two current path<br>
parts, where a current can be applied to each one of said parts, so that the current in each<br>
one of said parts essentially will be in phase with each other.<br>

PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
According to the present invention, a so-called triple-mode antenna arrangement is<br>
provided. The triple-mode antenna arrangement is designed for transmitting three<br>
essentially orthogonal radiation patterns.<br>
A so-called four-leaf clover antenna 1, which is previously known, is used in the present<br>
invention, and is shown in Figure 1. The four-leaf clover antenna 1 comprises a first 2,<br>
second 3, third 4 and fourth 5 loop of a conductive material, for example a bent copper<br>
wire, where the loops 2, 3, 4, 5 all mainly lie in the same plane, an antenna plane P in the<br>
plane of the paper in Figure 1. Each loop 2, 3, 4, 5 runs from a feeding conductor 6,<br>
having a feeding port 7, to a ground conductor 8, leading to ground 9, preferably they are<br>
all connected to the same feeding conductor 6. The loops 2, 3, 4, 5 are preferably<br>
essentially of the same length and positioned beside each other in a symmetrical circular<br>
clover pattern, as shown in Figure 1.<br>
When following the first loop 2, it starts at a first feeding connection point 10 where it<br>
contacts the feeding conductor 6, runs clockwise and terminates in a first ground<br>
connection point 11 where it contacts the ground conductor 8. The second loop 3,<br>
positioned clockwise relative to the first loop 2, also starts at the first feeding connection<br>
point 10, where it contacts the feeding conductor 6, runs clockwise and terminates in a<br>
second ground connection point 12 where it contacts the ground conductor 8.<br>
The third loop 4, positioned clockwise relative to the second loop 3, starts at the a second<br>
feeding connection point 13, where it contacts the feeding conductor 6, runs clockwise and<br>
terminates in the second ground connection point 12 where it contacts the ground<br>
conductor 8. The fourth loop 5, positioned clockwise relative to the third loop 4, starts at<br>
6<br><br>
the second feeding connection point 13, where it contacts the feeding conductor 6, runs<br>
clockwise and terminates in the first ground connection point 11, where it contacts the<br>
ground conductor 8.<br>
Each loop 2, 3, 4, 5 comprises an arcuate conductor part 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a and a first 2b, 3b,<br>
4b, 5b and second 2c, 3c, 4c, 5c straight conductor part. The straight conductor parts 2b,<br>
2c of the first loop 2 will form a first 14 and second 15 parallel pair conductor part<br>
together with the adjacent straight conductor parts 5c, 3b of the adjacent fourth 5 and<br>
second 3 loops. In the same way, third 16 and fourth 17 parallel pair conductor parts are<br>
formed. The arcuate conductor parts 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a extend in such a way that they together<br>
form an incomplete essentially circular conducting part. The term incomplete refers to that<br>
the essentially circular conducting part is broken between each arcuate conductor part 2a,<br>
3a, 4a, 5a.<br>
As all the loops 2, 3,4, 5 are fed from the same feeding conductor 6, current Ii, I2,13,14 in<br>
each loop will all be essentially in phase with each other. In particular, in each arcuate<br>
conductor part 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a, the current Ii, h, I3,14 will be in phase with the current Ii, I2,<br>
I3, I4 in all the other arcuate conductor parts 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a. Further, when regarding the<br>
first parallel pair conductor part 14, the currents Ii, I4 in the included straight conductor<br>
parts 2b, 5c run in opposite directions, cancelling each other. The corresponding condition<br>
applies for the second 15, third 16 and fourth 17 parallel pair conductor parts.<br>
This means that a the four-leaf clover antenna 1, by means of superposition of the loops 2,<br>
3, 4, 5, in effect is an approximation of a conducting ring where the current has the same<br>
phase all over the ring. This means that an approximation of an ideal so-called constant<br>
current electrical loop is obtained. The discrepancies of the approximation mainly arise<br>
from the fact the arcuate conductor parts 2a, 3 a, 4a, 5 a do not form a complete and<br>
accurate circle, and that the current I1, I2,I3,I4 in each arcuate conductor part 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a<br>
does not have the same phase along the arcuate conductor part 2a, 3 a, 4a, 5 a in question.<br>
It is possible to use more or fewer clover loops, the more clover loops that are used, the<br>
more accurate the approximation of the ideal conducting ring becomes. On the other hand,<br>
the more clover loops that are used, the more complicated the antenna structure becomes.<br>
7<br><br>
In the embodiment examples shown, a four leaf clover antenna 1 is used. Further, the<br>
smaller the clover antenna that is used, measured in wavelengths, the better the<br>
approximation becomes, since the current then varies to a smaller extent along the arcuate<br>
conductor part 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a in question. A wavelength here preferably refers to the centre<br>
wavelength of the operational bandwidth of the antenna arrangement according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The ideal radiation pattern 18 of a constant current electrical loop, which is approximated<br>
by a four-leaf clover antenna, is shown in Figure 2, and is shaped as a toroid ring, where<br>
the arc of the toroid ring essentially follows the arcuate conductor parts 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a of<br>
the four-leaf clover antenna 1. The constant current electrical loop ideal radiation pattern<br>
18 has a longitudinal symmetry plane P' that divides the toroid ring in two equal circular<br>
halves, which longitudinal toroid ring symmetry plane P' thus coincide with the four-leaf<br>
clover antenna plane P.<br>
According to the present invention, the four-leaf clover antenna is combined with a first 19<br>
and a second 20 dipole, orthogonally arranged, as shown in Figure 3, which first 19 and<br>
second 20 dipoles are made in a conductive material, for example a bent copper wire. The<br>
first dipole 19 comprises a first feeding part 21 with two parallel conductors 21a, 21b and<br>
a first arm part 22, comprising two dipole arms 22a, 22b, where the two feeding<br>
conductors 21a, 21b are bent 90° in such a way that the conductors, or dipole arms 22a,<br>
22b, now extend in opposite directions until they reach their ends. The second dipole 20<br>
comprises a corresponding second feeding part 23 and second arm part 24 with<br>
corresponding feeding conductors 23a, 23b and dipole arms 24a, 24b. The conducting<br>
parts 21,22,23,24 are preferably of essentially the same length.<br>
With reference to Figure 4, the dipoles 19, 20 are arranged in the centre of the four-leaf<br>
clover antenna, shown schematically with the arcuate conductor parts 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a only.<br>
The dipoles 19, 20 have their respective feeding parts 21, 23 rising perpendicularly to the<br>
four-leaf clover antenna plane P (not shown in Figure 4) and the respective arm part 22, 24<br>
extend essentially parallel to the four-leaf clover antenna plane. The extension of the first<br>
arm part 22 is essentially orthogonal to the extension of the second arm part 24.<br>
8<br><br>
The ideal radiation pattern 25 of a dipole antenna 26, having a feeding part 27 and a arm<br>
part 28, is shown in Figure 5, and is shaped as a toroid ring. The arm part 28 of the dipole<br>
antenna 26 constitutes a centre axis around which the radiation pattern's 25 toroid ring is<br>
formed. In other words, the arcuate shape of the radiation pattern 25 runs around the arm<br>
part 28 in such a way that the extension of the arm 28 part forms a central symmetry line<br>
for the toroid ring.<br>
Regarding the antenna according to the present invention, with reference to Figure 6, the<br>
antenna diagrams produced are shown in a side view, where the four-leaf clover antenna<br>
plane P runs perpendicular to the plane of the paper.<br>
The four leaf clover antenna 1 produces a first toroid-shaped radiation pattern 29, having<br>
the first longitudinal toroid ring symmetry plane P'. The first radiation pattern 29 is<br>
marked with tilted lines which increase from left to right.<br>
The first dipole antenna 19 produces a second toroid-shaped radiation pattern 30, having a<br>
second longitudinal toroid ring symmetry plane P" which coincide with, or is parallel<br>
with, the plane of the paper and is orthogonal to the first longitudinal toroid ring symmetry<br>
plane P'. The second radiation pattern 30 is marked with tilted lines which decrease from<br>
left to right.<br>
The second dipole antenna 20 produces a third toroid-shaped radiation pattern 31, having a<br>
third longitudinal toroid ring symmetry plane P'" which is orthogonal to both the first<br>
longitudinal toroid ring symmetry plane P' and the second longitudinal toroid ring<br>
symmetry plane P". We thus have a first P', a second P" and a third P'" plane. The third<br>
radiation pattern 31 is marked with horizontal lines.<br>
Ideally, as shown in Figure 6, these radiation patterns 29, 30, 31 have the same phase<br>
centre, but practically the second 30 and third 31 radiation patterns may be elevated or<br>
lowered relative to the first radiation pattern 29. Such a deviation should preferably be<br>
small measured in wavelengths, for example about 10, where  is the centre wavelength<br>
of the operational bandwidth of the antenna arrangement.<br>
9<br><br>
As the longitudinal toroid ring symmetry planes P', P", P'" are orthogonal to each other,<br>
the radiation patterns are orthogonal to each other, according to the definition below.<br>
As a conclusion, by means of the present invention, three different toroid-shaped radiation<br>
patterns 29, 30, 31 are acquired, where each radiation pattern is orthogonal to the other.<br>
As the radiation patterns are orthogonal, the correlation equals zero, where the correlation<br>
p may be written as<br><br>
In the equation above, Q. represents a surface and the symbol denotes a complex<br>
conjugate. For the integration of the radiation pattern, D. represents a closed surface<br>
comprising all space angels, and when this integration equals zero, there is no correlation<br>
between the radiation patterns, i.e. the radiation patterns are orthogonal to each other. The<br>
denominator is an effect normalization term.<br>
Having three, at least essentially, orthogonal radiation patterns is very desirable, since this<br>
enables uncorrelated parallel channels in a rich scattering environment, i.e. the rows in the<br>
channel matrix may be independent. This in turn means that the present invention is<br>
applicable for a MIMO system.<br>
In the previously described first embodiment, the four-leaf clover antenna and the first and<br>
second dipoles are made by a bent wire, for example a copper wire. Any other conducting<br>
material will perform the function of the present invention.<br>
In a second embodiment, the four-leaf clover antenna and the first and second dipoles are<br>
made in planar techniques, constituting a microstrip antenna. As shown schematically in<br>
Figure 7, the triple-mode antenna according to the present invention then comprises a first<br>
32, second 33, third 34 and fourth 35 copper-clad dielectric laminate, for example a<br>
Teflon-based laminate, placed on top of each other. Be removing the copper, different<br>
conducting structures may be formed on the laminates 32, 33, 34, 35. Removal of copper<br>
may be made by means etching, or, alternatively, milling.<br>
10<br><br>
In Figure 7, the first 32, second 33, third 34 and fourth 35 laminates, each one having a<br>
first 36, 37, 38, 39 and second 40, 41, 42, 43 side, are shown from the side, forming a<br>
sandwich structure. The sandwich structure has a top 44, a bottom 45 and a first 46,<br>
second 47 and third 48 intermediate section, where each intermediate section 46, 47, 48 is<br>
formed between two adjacent laminates.<br>
On the top 44, on the first side 36 of the first laminate 32, the dipole arm parts are formed.<br>
Below, at the first intermediate section 46 between the first 32 and second 33 laminate, the<br>
four-leaf clover loops are formed, either on the second side 40 of the first laminate 32 or<br>
on the first side 37 of the second laminate 33. On the side not used, all copper is removed.<br>
Further below, at the second intermediate section 47 between the second 33 and third 34<br>
laminate, the four-leaf clover loops are combined in such way that every loop is connected<br>
to a common feed line and a common ground by means of vias (not shown) connecting the<br>
first 46 and second 47 intermediate sections. A combining network is then formed, either<br>
on the second side 41 of the second laminate 33 or on the first side 38 of the third laminate<br>
34. On the side not used, all copper is removed.<br>
Further below, at the third intermediate 48 section, between the third 34 and fourth 35<br>
laminate, the dipole arm parts are combined in such way that they are connected to<br>
respective feed lines and a common ground by means of vias (not shown) connecting the<br>
top 44 and the third 48 intermediate section 42. Further, a four-leaf clover feeding line is<br>
formed at the third intermediate section 48, by means of vias (not shown) connecting the<br>
second 47 and third 48 intermediate sections. The four-leaf clover feeding line is<br>
connected to a clover antenna connector 49 at the edge of the sandwich. Thus a<br>
combining network is formed, either on the second side 42 of the third laminate 34 or on<br>
the first 39 side of the fourth laminate 35. On the side not used, all copper is removed.<br>
At the bottom 45, on the second side 43 of the fourth laminate 35, a dipole feeding line is<br>
formed for each dipole by means of vias (not shown), connecting the second intermediate<br>
section 47 and the bottom 45. Each dipole feeding line is connected to a dipole antenna<br>
connector 50 (only one shown) at the edge of the sandwich.<br>
11<br><br>
An example of how the etched clover arms and their feeding vias may look like is shown<br>
in Figure 8a. There, an etched four-leaf clover antenna 1 comprising the first 2, second 3,<br>
third 4 and fourth 5 loop is shown. Each loop is connected to a corresponding first 51,<br>
second 52, third 53 and fourth 54 via. These vias 51, 52, 53, 54 are joined to one point at<br>
another point, in the example with reference to Figure 7 in another layer. A fifth common<br>
central via 55 is also provided, thus totally resulting in two terminals for feeding the four-<br>
leaf clover antenna 1, in the example with reference to Figure 7 these terminals are<br>
available via the clover antenna connector 49.<br>
Further, in Figure 8b, an example of how the etched dipole arms and their feeding vias<br>
may look like is shown. The first dipole 19 has its dipole arms 22a, 22b connected to a<br>
respective first 56 and second 57 dipole via. The second dipole 20 has its dipole arms 24a,<br>
24b connected to a respective first 58 and second 59 dipole via. These vias 51, 52, 53, 54<br>
are preferably brought to another layer, as described in the example with reference to<br>
Figure 7, where each dipole is available via a connector 50 corresponding to the vias 56,<br>
57; 58, 59 of each dipole.<br>
Due to reciprocity, for the transmitting properties of all the triple-mode antenna<br>
arrangements described, there are corresponding equal receiving properties, as known to<br>
those skilled in the art, allowing the triple-mode antenna arrangement to both send and<br>
receive in three essentially uncorrelated modes of operation.<br>
The invention is not limited to the embodiments described above, which only should be<br>
regarded as examples of the present invention, but may vary freely within the scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br>
For example, there does not have to be two discrete dipole antennas. In order to achieve<br>
the dipole radiation patterns described, two electrical dipoles have to be achieved, which<br>
does not necessarily mean that two discrete dipole antennas are required. Two electrical<br>
dipoles may be achieved by using only three dipole arms, a first 60, second 61 and third 62<br>
dipole arm, each arm running outwards from a centre point as shown in Figures 9a and 9b.<br>
The central ends of the dipole arms are connected to a feeding arrangement 63 by means<br>
of appropriate feeding wires 64, 65, 66. The three dipole arms 60, 61, 62 extend in such a<br>
12<br><br>
way that an angle of essentially 60° is formed between them, i.e. they are extending<br>
symmetrically. In the following, the positive direction of the current is from the centre and<br>
outwards.<br>
In a first mode of operation, as shown in Figure 9a, the first dipole arm 60 is fed with a<br>
current having the relative amplitude -√2, the second dipole arm 61 is fed with a current<br>
having the relative amplitude √2 and the third dipole arm 62 is fed with a current having<br>
the relative amplitude 0. The resulting first electrical dipole 67 (marked with dashed lines)<br>
is directed essentially perpendicular to the third dipole arm 62.<br>
In a second mode of operation, as shown in Figure 9b, the first dipole arm 60 is fed with a<br>
current having the relative amplitude -1√2, the second dipole arm 61 is fed with a current<br>
having the relative amplitude -1√2 and the third dipole arm 62 is fed with a current<br>
having the relative amplitude 1. The resulting second electrical dipole 68 (marked with<br>
dashed lines) is directed essentially parallel to the third dipole arm 62.<br>
Two orthogonal electrical dipoles 67, 68 are thus obtained, using only three dipole arms<br>
60,61,62.<br>
It is also conceivable to use circularly arranged electrical dipoles, instead of the clover<br>
antenna configuration described above, in order to achieve an approximation of a constant<br>
current electrical loop.<br>
In a first version, with reference to Figure 10a and 10b, a first 69, 69', second 70, 70' and<br>
third 71,71' electrical dipole, each preferably in the form of a dipole antenna, are arranged<br>
in the form of an equilateral triangle 72, 72'. Inside this triangle 72, 72', two more<br>
orthogonal electrical dipoles (not shown) are arranged in any one of the ways previously<br>
described.<br>
In a second version, with reference to Figure 11a and 1 lb, a first 73, 73', second 74, 74',<br>
third 75, 75' and fourth 76, 76' electrical dipole, each preferably in the form of a dipole<br>
antenna, are arranged in the form of a square 77, 77'. Inside this square 77 77', two more<br>
orthogonal electrical dipoles (not shown) are arranged in any one of the ways previously<br>
described.<br>
13<br><br>
In a first case with reference to Figure 10a, and 11a, corresponding dipole feeding<br>
conductor parts 78, 79, 80; 81, 82, 83, 84 are positioned in the middle of each side of the<br>
triangle 72 or the square 77, respectively. This results in that each individual electrical<br>
dipole 69, 70 ,71; 73, 74, 75, 76 is essentially straight.<br>
In a second case with reference to Figure 10b and 11b, corresponding dipole feeding<br>
conductor parts 78', 79', 80'; 81', 82', 83', 84' are positioned in each corner of the<br>
triangle 72' or the square 77', respectively. This results in that each individual electrical<br>
dipole 69', 70' ,71'; 73', 74', 75', 76' is angled, 60° for the triangle and 90° for the square.<br>
The dipoles according to the above should be fed in such a way that the currents (not<br>
indicated in the Figures) in the dipoles all are essentially in phase with each other,<br>
enabling the approximation of a constant current electrical loop,<br>
With reference to the examples with reference to Figure 10a, 10b, 11a and 11b, other<br>
geometrical forms are of course conceivable. As for the clover antenna described above, it<br>
is possible to use different numbers of circularly arranged electrical dipoles. The more<br>
electrical dipoles that are used, the more accurate the approximation of the ideal<br>
conducting ring becomes. On the other hand, the more electrical dipoles that are used, the<br>
more complicated the antenna structure becomes<br>
All planes P, P', P", P'" described are imaginary and added for explanatory reasons only.<br>
The layer configuration described with reference to Figure 7 is only an example of how<br>
such an arrangement may be realized. Many other such configurations are possible within<br>
the scope of the invention.<br>
Many other configurations which are not made in planar techniques are also conceivable.<br>
As mentioned previously, bent wires may for example be used.<br>
All feeding lines, combining network and connections which are not discussed more in<br>
detail in the description are of a commonly known type, easily designed and/or acquired<br>
by the skilled person.<br>
14<br><br>
The clover antenna is not necessary for carrying out the invention, the essence of that part<br>
of the antenna arrangement according to the invention is to provide at least an<br>
approximation to a constant current electrical loop lying in the previously mentioned four-<br>
leaf clover antenna plane P, which more generally constitutes an antenna plane P in which<br>
the resulting approximated constant current electrical loop lies.<br>
A clover antenna according to the embodiments above is a preferred way to provide such<br>
an approximation. The number of clover loops may vary, as mentioned above, but should<br>
not be less than two in order to provide any positive effect. The loops do not have to lie<br>
exactly in the same plane, but may be slightly tilted with the working principle<br>
maintained. The direction of the electrical current may vary from the ones disclosed.<br>
