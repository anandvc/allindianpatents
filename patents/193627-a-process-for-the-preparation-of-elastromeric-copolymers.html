				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ETHYLENE-PROPYLENE ELASTOMERIC COPOLYMERS<br>
The present invention relates to a process, of the heterogeneous type in a suspension of liquid monomer, for the production of ethylene-propylene elastomers (EP) and ethylene-propylene-diene elastomers (EPDM).<br>
More specifically, the present invention relates to a process for the production of the above elastomers in a free-flowing and subdivisible form.<br>
Processes for the production of EP(D)M in suspen¬sion involve an evaporation phase of the solvent which is carried out in steam strippers containing water as dispersing medium. The polymer particles are not in fact free-flowing and cannot therefore be processed downstream of the reactor without a dispersing medium.<br>
IT-A-MI 94 A 02528 (of 15/12/94) of the same ap¬plicant describes heterogeneous catalysts capable of producing EP(D)M which, although maintaining the same characteristics as normal EP(D)M, are in a subdivided<br><br>
form in the reaction slurry. During the reaction medium evaporation, however, the above particles tend to reform agglomerates, which however are easy to break.<br>
The process described in the patent application filed by the same applicant IT-A-MI 95 01403 of 30/6/95, which describes a process using prepolymerized catalysts, has the same disadvantage.<br>
US-A-5.086.132 describes a process for obtaining non-agglomerated polymers with a process in suspension which involves the use, during the polymerization itself, of solid granular material having dimensions of less than 10 microns, particularly carbon black, silica, metal oxides, clays.<br>
The process described in US-A-5.086.132 has various disadvantages however.<br>
First of all, as the catalytic system is of the Ziegler-Natta type, the materials used must necessarily have a high purity.<br>
In addition, the above process has a serious disadvantage due to the decrease in the catalytic yield (see experimental examples of US-A-5.086.132) of more than 50%, passing from the comparative test to that in which the polymer is free-flowing due to the effect of the addition of 4% of carbon black. This drawback occurs in spite of a preventive treatment of the carbon<br><br>
black at 100°C under vacuum for a night.<br>
A process has now been found which overcomes the disadvantages described above.<br>
In accordance with this, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of copolymers of ethylene with propylene and optionally another diene in a suspension of liquid monomer, in the presence of a catalyst selected from (a) Titanium salt supported on magnesium salt and (b) compound of Vanadium soluble in hydrocarbon solvents either supported on an inert mate¬rial or prepolymerized, and a co-catalyst essentially consisting of an organic compound of Aluminium, and a possible chlorinated activator, characterized in that:<br>
1)	when the polymerization is almost complete, a solid material insoluble in the reaction environment and having an average diameter of between 0.001 and 200 microns, preferably between 0.005 and 5 microns, is added to the reaction mixture;<br>
2)	the suspension of polymer and solid material are kept in contact for a sufficient time to obtain per¬fectly free-flowing polymeric particles;<br>
3)	the perfectly free-flowing polymeric particles of step (2) are recovered.<br>
It is probable, but there is not yet any experi¬mental proof, that the solid material is adsorbed onto<br><br>
the polymeric particles; consequently the duration of step (2) is probably linked to the necessity of adsorb¬ing the solid material onto the surface of the polymer.<br>
The material to be added to the polymeric disper¬sion can be of an organic nature (for example carbon black and products of a polymeric nature) or inorganic (for example silica, alumina and other oxides, carbon¬ates, sulfates and silicates).<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the material to be added, as well as having the necessary average diame¬ter, has a surface area of over 10 mV?/ even more preferably of over 4 0 mV^/ and a porosity (intended as absorption of dibutylphthalate) of more than 20 ml/lOOg, preferably more than 80 ml/lOOg.<br>
In the preferred embodiment the material to be added at the end of the polymerization reaction or, in the case of polymerization in continuous, at the outlet of the polymerization reactor, is selected from carbon black and silica.<br>
It is preferable for the silica to have average dimensions of between 0.01 and 0.025 microns, a surface area of between 130 and 200 mVg and a porosity of between 200 and 300 ml/l00g.<br>
With respect to the carbon black, it is preferable for it to have average dimensions of between 0.015 and<br><br>
0.04 microns, a surface area of between 50 and 100 mVg and a porosity of between 80 and 120 ml/lOOg.<br>
The quantity of material to be added to the polymeric dispersion is at least 0.05% with respect to the formed polymer, generally between 0.5 and 8% by weight with respect to the polymer. Higher quantities can be used, obviously depending on the final use of the elastomeric copolymer.<br>
With respect to step (2) , under the polymerization conditions applied, this is between 1 and 50 minutes. After 3 0 minutes there is normally an almost complete dispersion of the solid material.<br>
The use of Titanium salt supported on Magnesium salt, particularly Magnesium chloride and Magnesium carboxylate, and compounds of Vanadium soluble in hydrocarbon solvents, particularly Vanadium acetyl-acetonate, is well-known in literature.<br>
Processes for the production of EP(D)M in the presence of Vanadium supported on inert material and prepolymerized Vanadium catalyst, are described in two patent applications filed by the same applicant, EP-A-717.050 and EP-96 107090 respectively. The latter document describes in particular a process for the polymerization of ethylene with C3-C10 alpha-olefins, preferably propylene and optionally another conjugated<br><br>
diene, carried out in a suspension of liquid monomer in the presence of a catalyst containing Vanadium and a co-catalyst essentially consisting of an organic compound of aluminium and optionally in the presence of a halogenated promoter, characterized in that the above catalyst containing Vanadium, insoluble in the reaction medium, is the precipitate which is obtained by mixing, in an atmosphere of ethylene or alpha-olefins:<br>
a)	a compound of Vanadium in the oxidation state of from 3 to 5, preferably a solution or a suspension of the above Vanadium compound, and<br>
b)	an essentially hydrocarbon solution of a compound selected from those having general formula (I) R^AIX^^ wherein R is a C^-CJQ alkyl radical, X is a halogen,<br>
m + n = 3, m is an integer from 0 to 2.<br>
The polymerization can be carried out with hydro¬gen as moderator and molecular weight regulator, operating at a total pressure of between 5 and 100 bar, preferably between 8 and 3 0 bar, with a ratio between partial ethylene pressure and partial hydrogen pressure of over 4, preferably over 20. Other compounds however can be used as molecular weight regulators.<br>
The polymerization temperature is usually main¬tained within the range of -5°C to 65°C, preferably from 25 to 50°C. The contact times vary from 10 minutes<br><br>
to 6 hours, preferably from 15 minutes to 1 hour.<br>
The elastomeric ethylene-propylene copolymers (EP) obtained with the process of the present invention contain from 35 to 85% of ethylene, preferably from 45% to 75% by weight, and have an instrinsic viscosity measured at 135°C in o-dichlorobenzene of between 0.5 and 6 dl/g, preferably from 1 to 3. In addition to ethylene and propylene, the elastomeric EP copolymers can contain other alpha-olefins, having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, in a quantity not higher than 10% by weight. Typical examples of these higher alpha-olefins are butene-1 and pentene-1.<br>
As well as EP copolymers, elastomeric (EPDM) terpolymers can be obtained with the process of the present invention. In addition to ethylene and propyl¬ene, EPDM contain a third monomer selected, as is known, from:<br>
—	dienes with a linear chain, such as 1,4-hexadiene and 1,6-octadiene;<br>
—	acyclic dienes with a branched chain such as 5-methyl-l,4-hexadiene, 3,6-dimethyl-l,6-octadiene, 3,7-dimethyl-l,7-octadiene;<br>
—	alicyclic dienes with a single ring such as 1,4-cyclohexadiene, 1,5-cyclooctadiene, 1,5-cyclodode-cadiene;<br><br>
— dienes having fused and bridged alicyclic rings such as inethyltetrahydroindene, dicyclopentadiene, bicyclo-[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-2,5-diene; alkenyl, alkylidene, cycloalkenyl and cycloalkylidene norbornenes such as 5-methylene-2-norbornene, 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (ENB), 5-propenyl-2-norbornene.<br>
Among non-conjugated dienes typically used for preparing these copolymers, dienes containing at least a double bond in a strained ring are preferred, the most preferable being 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (ENB).<br>
At the end of the polymerization and after the addition of the solid material according to the process of the present invention, the polymeric suspension is subjected to devolatilization of the solvent by reduc¬ing the pressure, raising the temperature and flushing with inert gas, possibly hot. The polymer in the form of free-flowing grains, gradually releases the non-reacted monomers and can be recovered in this form or reprocessed in an extruder to form granules or possibly bales for pressing.<br>
In addition to giving polymers in a subdivided and free-flowing form (also at high temperatures), the process of the present invention enables an economical¬ly less expensive dry-finishing process compared to the usual post-treatment with water and steam.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of elastromeric copolymers of ethylene with propylene and optionally another diene in a suspension of liquid monomer, in the presence of a catalyst selected from titanium salt supported on magnesium salt and vanadium acetyl acetonate soluble in hydrocarbon solvents either supported on an inert material or prepolymerized, and a co-catalyst essentially consisting of an organic compound of aluminium, and an optionally chlorinated activator, characterized in that after the polymerization is at least substantially complete, a solid material such as herein described insoluble in the reaction environment and having an average diameter of between 0.001 and 200 [Jin is added to the reaction mixture; the suspension of polymer and solid material are kept in contact for a sufficient time to obtain perfectly free-flowing polymeric particles; and the perfectly free-flowing polymeric particles are then recovered.<br><br>
The following examples provide a better illustra¬tion of the present invention. EXAMPLES<br>
All the reagents are commercial products; the solvents used in polymerization and the activators were de-aerated under nitrogen and anhydrified on alumina and molecular sieves.<br>
The organic compounds of aluminium were used in a solution diluted in hexane.<br>
The copolymers prepared were characterized as follows:<br>

analysis of the polymer in the form of films having a<br>
thickness of 0.2 mm using an FT-IR spectrophotometer of<br>
Perkin-Elmer model 1760.<br>
The content of propylene is determined by measur¬ing the ratio between the band absorbances at 4390 cm-1 and 4255 cm-1 and using a calibration curve calibrated with standard polymers.<br>

After 60 minutes, the monomers are evaporated and the reactor is opened: 93 grams of polymer in a subdi¬vided form but partially agglomerated, are recovered, equal to a yield of 31 kg of polymer per gram of Vanadium. The characterizations of the copolymer are summarized in table 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 11 - Copolymerization of ethylene and propyl¬ene.<br>
507 grams of liquid propylene and 270 grams of propane as diluent are charged into the pressure-resistant reactor described in comparative example 6. The reactor is thermostat-regulated at 40°C, saturated with ethylene until an overpressure of 5.5 bar is reached and then a further overpressure of 0.1 bar of hydrogen is added. The total pressure in the top of the reactor was 2 0.3 bar.<br>
A hexane solution containing 4.55 mmoles of DEAC and subsequently an aliquot of the catalyst of compara¬tive example 6 equal to 0.03 grams of Vanadium suspend¬ed in hexane and containing 0.23 mmoles of ethyl<br><br>
trichloroacetate are then added. The reaction is carried out at a constant temperature, feeding ethylene in continuous to maintain the total pressure constant (molar ratio Al/V = 78).<br>
After 60 minutes, 1 gram of carbon black of the<br>
type HAF ASTM N330 suspended in methanol are poured<br>
into the reaction mixture. The monomers are then<br>
evaporated and the reactor is opened: 90 grams of<br>
polymer in a subdivided form and perfectly free-flow¬<br>
ing, are recovered, equal to a yield of 3 0 kg of<br>
polymer per gram of Vanadium. The characterizations of<br>
the copolymer are summarized in table 2.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 12<br>
A)	PREPARATION OF THE SUPPORTED CATALYST<br>
5.15 grams of silica, dehydrated at 650°C for 6 hours, are slowly impregnated, under pumping of nitro¬gen and mechanical stirring, with a solution containing 2.39 mmoles of Vanadium (III) acetylacetonate in a vo¬lume of toluene equal to the pore volume of the carri¬er.<br>
After leaving under stirring for 10 minutes, the tatalyst thus prepared is dried.<br>
It is then saturated with ethylene and 4.3 mmoles of DEAC in 50 cm3 of hexane are rapidly added. The nixture is left to react at room temperature for about<br><br>
60 minutes and is then left to decant. The liquid is perfectly colourless. The liquid is separated, and the solid is dried under vacuum obtaining 7.93 grams of powder containing 1.5% of Vanadium. B)   Copolymerization of ethylene and propylene.<br>
744 grams of liquid propylene are charged into the pressure-resistant reactor described in comparative example 6, the reactor is thermostat-regulated at 40°C, saturated with ethylene until an overpressure of 6 bar is reached and then a further overpressure of 0.1 bar of hydrogen is added. The total pressure in the top of the reactor was 21.6 bar.<br>
A hexane solution containing 6.03 mmoles of DEAC and subsequently an aliquot of the catalyst previously prepared equal to 0.061 grams of Vanadium suspended in hexane and containing 0.95 mmoles of ethyl trichloroa-cetate are then added. The reaction is carried out at a constant temperature, feeding ethylene in continuous to maintain the total pressure constant (molar ratio Al/V = 50).<br>
After 60 minutes, the monomers are then evaporated and the reactor is opened: 12 0 grams of polymer in a subdivided form but partially agglomerated, not free-flowing, are recovered, equal to a yield of 19.7 kg of polymer per gram of Vanadium. The characterizations of<br><br>
the copolymer are summarized in table 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 13 Copolymerization of ethylene and propylene.<br>
744 grams of liquid propylene are charged into the same pressure-resistant reactor described above, the reactor is thermostat-regulated at 40°C, saturated with ethylene until an overpressure of 6 bar is reached and then a further overpressure of 0.1 bar of hydrogen is added. The total pressure in the top of the reactor is 21.6 bar.<br>
A hexane solution containing 6.03 mmoles of DEAC and subsequently an aliquot of the catalyst of example 12 equal to 0.061 grams of Vanadium suspended in hexane and containing 0.95 mmoles of ethyl trichloroacetate are then added. The reaction is carried out at a con¬stant temperature, feeding ethylene in continuous to maintain the total pressure constant (molar ratio Al/V = 50) .<br>
After 60 minutes, 5 grams of silica of the type Ultrasil VN3 suspended in methanol are poured into the reaction mixture. The monomers are evaporated and the reactor is opened: 110 grams of polymer in a subdivided form and perfectly free-flowing, are recovered, equal to a yield of 18 kg of polymer per gram of Vanadium. The characterizations of the copolymer are summarized in table 2.<br><br><br>
As far as examples 7 and 11 are concerned, it was not possible to determine the content of linked propyl¬ene as the polymers could not be subjected to IR 25  analysis on films.<br><br><br>
