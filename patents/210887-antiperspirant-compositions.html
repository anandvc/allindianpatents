Title, of  the invention<br>
ANTEPERSPIRANT COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 having its registered office at Hindustan Leyer House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai-400 020, State of Maharashtra India<br>
The following specification describes the nature of this invention (and the manner in which it is to be performed)<br><br><br>
GRANTED<br>
1 MAR 2004<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to antiperspirant compositions with sufficient rigidity to sustain their own shape.  The usual form of such compositions is a stick.<br>
BACK GROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Topically applied antiperspirant compositions are in widespread use throughout much of the world, in order to enable their users to avoid or minimise wet patches on their skin, especially in axillary regions.  Antiperspirant formulations have been applied using a range of different applicators depending on the individual preferences of consumers, including aerosols, roll-ons, pump sprays, sticks and so-called mushroom applicators which are used to apply cream formulations.  In some parts of the world, sticks are especially popular.  The term stick traditionally indicates a bar of material with a solid appearance which was usually housed within a dispensing container and which retains its structural integrity and shape whilst being applied. When a portion of the stick is drawn across the skin surface a film of the stick composition is transferred to the skin surface. Although the stick has the appearance of a solid article capable of retaining its own shape for a period of time, the<br><br>
continuous phase  is hydrophobic and the disperse phase is more polar and is  a  solution  of the antxperspirant  active in an aqueous  solvent.<br>
We have found that such  compositions  can be  structured with one or more materials  which form a network of fibres  in the hydrophobic  continuous  phase.<br>
Such compositions have  the  advantage  that the deposit  on skin or on clothing   (to which material may  accxdentally be applied)   is  inconspicuous/   in  contrast with highly visible opaque deposits  from  some  known  compositions.<br>
With suitable choice  of materials  and proportions  it  is possible to achieve  Other advantages,   notably<br>
•	satisfactory hardness  of  the" composition,<br>
*	satisfactory sensory perception when applied to the  skin<br>
hy the user.<br>
in a first aspect this   invention provides  an antiperspirant composition which is"a comprising<br>
i)       15 to 75% by weight  of  a  continuous phase  containing  water-imiiscibleliiquid carrier and at  least one gel-forming sturruoturant  there.in<br><br>
ii)  25 to 85% by weight of a disperse phase which is a<br>
solution of <br>
wherein said at least one st of   the liquid carrier 	f composition,<br>
The structurant serves to gel the continuous phase giving it an increased viscosity or even rigidity.  When used in a sufficient amount, not exceeding 15% of the total composition, it is able to structure the composition with sufficient rigidity to sustain its own shape, at least for a limited time.<br>
It is believed that the fibres or strands of structurant exist as a network extending throughout the water-immisicible continuous phase. These fibres or strands appear to be branched or interconnected. Upon heating the:gel to the gel melting temperature, the strands of structurant dissolve in the liquid phase.<br>
Preferred within this invention are compositions which have sufficient rigidity that they can be regarded as firm<br><br>
solids.  The hardness of such compositions can be measured with a penetrometer, in a manner which will be described in greater detail below-<br>
In order to prornote good sensory properties at the time ox use it is preferred to include silicone oil in the water-immiscible carrier liquid.  The amount of silicone oil may be at least 10% by weight of the composition and/or at least 40% by weight of the water-immiscible carrier liquid.<br>
Ethanol gives a cooling effect on application to skin, because it is very volatile.  It is preterit that the content of ethanol or  any monohydric alcohol with a vapour pressure above 1.3kPa (10mm Hg) is not-oyer 15% better not over 8% by weight of the composition.<br>
Fatty^lcohcls which are solid at room temperature., such as stearyl alcohol, lead to deposits with an.  opaque white appearance and are preferably kept to low concentration or excluded.<br>
In a significant development of this invention, the sticks can be formulated to give a transparent or translucent appearance, which has two advantages.  It assists with the avoidance of visible deposits-it.s..-on....skin and also enables the<br><br>
user to recognise,   from the stick itself,   that  this will be the  case.<br>
We have^found that compositions  within  this   invention which are a novel transparent  or translucent emulsion  can be obtained by  formulating the  composition  to meet  two  criteria. The  first criterion is  that  the disperse phase  and the continuous phase   (consisting of the water-immiscible  carrier liquid and the  structurant contained within  that  liquid) should be  formulated so that  their refractive  indices match. The  refractive  index of the continuous  phase  will be  close  to the  refractive index of the water-immiscible  carrier  liquid in it.     In order to achieve good light  transmission  through a composition,   the refractive  index of  the water-immiscible continuous phase and the refractive  index of the  disperse phase  should match within  0.003"units  preferably  0.002  units.<br>
The  second crite-rfon is  that  the matched  refractive indices of these two phases  should be an approximate match to the refractive  index of the structurant.     The  closeness of match required will depend on  the  structurant which  is  used. Th,e refractive  index of a structurant  can be determined by making trial compositions as  explained in more detail below. Such investigation will also  show how closely the  refractive index of the  liquid must be matched to  the  structurant.<br><br>
A composition of this invention will generally be marketed in a container by means of which it can be applied at. time of use.  This container may be of conventional type.<br>
A second aspect of the invention therefore provides an antiperspirant product comprising a dispensing container having at least one aperture for delivery of the contents of the container, means for urging the contents of the container to the said aperture or apertures,- and a composition of the first aspect of the invention in the container.  Preferred is that a composition of this invention is sufficiently rigid to be accommodated as a stick product 4n...a disve.nsing._co,n,tainer having an open end at which an end of for use.<br>
The compositions of"this invention can be produced by processes in which an emulsion is produced at an elevated temperature and allowed to cool to permit gel-formation in the continuous phase.<br>
Thus, according to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the production of an antiperspirant composition according to the first aspect of this invention, comprising, not necessarily in__a.nv order, the steps of<br><br>
•	incorporating a  structurant  into  a water-immiscible liquid carrier<br>
•	mixing the liquid carrier with a  disperse  liquid phase which  is a solution  of an  antiperspirant  active  in water,   optionally mixed with  a  water-soluble  solvent,<br>
e	heating  the  liquid carrier  or  a mixture  containing  it to<br>
an  elevated temperature  at  which  the   structurant  is soluble  in the  water-immiscible  liquid  carrier,<br>
followed by<br>
introducing the mixture into a mould which preferably is a dispensing container, and then cooling or permitting the mixture to cool "to a temperature at which it is thickened or solidified".<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for preventing cr reducing perspiration on human skin comprising topically applying to the skin a composition according to the first aspect of this invention comprising an antiperspirant"active, a water-immiscible liquid carrier and a structurant therefor.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
As indicated above, the composition contains an aqueous solution of antiperspirant active emulsified in a carrier oil<br><br>
containing a structuring agent.<br>
Materials which may be  used to  form these  different parts of the composition will be discussed in  turn,   together with possibilities  and preferences.<br>
Strueturant<br>
A number of organic compounds are known to possess the ability to gel hydrophobic organic liquids such as water-immiscible hydrocarbon and/or silicone oils by formation of a network of fibres or strands which extends throughout the jliquid, thereby gelling the liquid.  Such materials are generally non-polymeric, being monomers or dimers with molecular weight below 10,000 rather than polymers with more than 8 repeat units or with.molecular weight above 10,000.<br>
Materials with this property have been reviewed by ; Terech and Weiss in "Low Molecular Mass Gelators of Organic Liquids and the Properties of their Gels" Chem.  Rev 97, 3133-3159 [1997] and by Terech in Chapter 8, "Low-molecular weight Organogelators" of the book "Specialist surfactants" edited by I D Robb, Blackie Academic Professional, 1997.<br>
It is characteristic of such structurants, useful in<br><br>
this invention, that<br>
they are able to gel the organic liquid in the absence<br>
of any disperse phase<br>
the structured liquids are obtainable by cooling from an<br>
elevated temperature at which the structurant is in<br>
solution in the liquid - this solution being mobile and<br>
pourable<br>
the structured liquid becomes more mobile if subjected<br>
to shear or stress<br>
the structure does not spontaneously recover within 24<br>
hours if the sheared liquid is left to stand at ambient<br>
laboratory temperature, even though a small partial<br>
recovery may be observed<br>
the structure can be recovered by reheating to a<br>
temperature at which the structurant is in solution in<br>
the liquid and allowing it to cool back to ambient<br>
laboratory temperature.<br>
It appears that such structurants operate by interactions which are permanent unless disrupted by shear or heating. Such structurants operate by forming a network of strands or fibres extending throughout the gelled liquid.  In some cases these fibres can be observed by- electron, microscopy, although in other cases the observation of the fibres which are believed to be present is prevented by<br><br>
practical difficulties in preparing a suitable specimen. When observed, the fibres in a gel are generally thin (diameter less than 0.5/i, often less than 0.2fx)   and appear to have numerous branches or interconnections.<br>
If these fibres are crystalline, they may or may not be the same polymorph as macroscopic crystals obtained by conventional crystallization from a solvent.<br>
One material which is well known to form such gels is 12-hydroxy stearic acid which is discussed in Terech et al "Organogels and Aerogels of Racemic and Chiral 12-hydroxy octadecanoic Acid", Langmuir Vol 10, 3406-3418, 1994. The material is commercially available from Ajinomoto and also from Caschem.<br>
US-A-5750096 is one of""several documents which teaches that gelation can be brought about using esters or amides of 12-hydroxy stearic acid.  The alcohol used to form such an ester or the amine used to form such an amide may contain an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic group with up to 22 carbons therein.  If the group is aliphatic it preferably contains at least three carbon atoms.  A cycloaliphatic group preferably contains at least five carbon atoms and may be a fixed ring system such as adamantyl.<br><br>
N-acyl amino acid amides and esters  are  also known to structure  liquids.     We have established that  they do so by forming fibrous networks.     They are described in US patent 3969087.     N-Lauroyl-L-glutamic acid di-n-butylamide  is commercially available  from Ajinomoto  under  their  designation GP-1.<br>
Further materials  which have been  disclosed as  gelling agents  are  the  amide  derivatives  of di  and  tribasic carboxylic  acids  set  forth  in WO  98/27 954   notably  alkyl N,N"dialkyi  succinamides.<br>
It  is desirable that  the  structurant material (s)   should not include  carboxylic acid groups  which can  react with common  antiperspirant  acid  salts   in  solution  and  form a precipitate  of an insoluble  aluminium  or   zirconium  salt.<br>
It  is  also desirable  that"the  structurant material(s) should not include any functional  groups which  are  vulnerable to hydrolysis under acidic  aqueous  conditions.<br>
For  these  reasons  the N-acylamino  acid  amides,   the amides of  12-hydroxy stearic acid and the  above-mentioned succinamides  are of  interest.<br><br>
A novel  structurant which  is   the  subject of a co-pending application  is  a combination  of  a  sterol  and a  sterol  ester.<br>
In its preferred  form the   sterol  satisfies  either of the two  formulae:<br><br>
in  which P, represents   an  aliphatic,   cycloaliphatic  or aromatic group,   and preferably"a  linear  or branched aliphatic sa-curated or unsaturated hydrocarbon -group.     R desirably contains  from  1   to  20  carbons  and preferably  from 4   to  14 carbons.<br>
It is particularly  suitable   to  employ  (3  sitosterol or campesterol  or cholesterol,   or  a  hydrogenated derivative thereof,   such as dihydrocholesterol,   or  a mixture  of  two or more  of them.     An  especially preferred  sterol   is<br><br>
{5-sitosterol.<br><br>
The preferred sterol ester is oryzanol, sometimes referred to as Y~oryzano1 which contains material satisfying the following formula:-<br><br>
OH<br>
CH=HC—coo<br>
CK3   CH3<br>
The sterol and sterol ester are used in a mole ratio<br>
that is normally selected in the range of from 10:1 to 1:10, especially from 6:1 to 1:4 and preferably in the range of from 3:1 to 1:2.  Employment of the two system constituents within such a mole ratio range, and especially within the preferred range facilitates the co-stacking of the constituents and consequently facilitates the formation of a network that is readily able to structure the formulation.<br>
Another novel structurant which is the subject of a co¬pending application and which may be used in this invention is an ester of cellobiose and a fatty acid, preferably of 6<br><br>
to  13 carbon  atoms  especially 8  to  10  or 11  carbon atoms. Preferably the  cellobiose  is  fully esterified,   or nearly so, and.is-. in...the ..a-anomeric  form.<br>
The  structure of such a compound,   in its a-anomeric form<br><br>
where R is an alkyl or alkenyl chain of 5 to 12 carbon atoms so that the acyl group contains 6 to 13 carbon atoms. Particularly preferred acyl groups incorporate a linear alkyl chain of 7 to 10 carbon atoms and are thus octanoyl, nonanoyl, decanoyl ox undecanoyl.<br>
... The acyl groups may have a mixture of chain lengths but it is preferred that they are similar in size and structure. Thus it is preferred that all of the acyl groups are aliphatic and at least 90% of the acyl groups have a chain length within a range such that the shorter and longer chain lengths in the rangs differ by no more than two carbon atoms,<br><br>
i.e. length in a range from m - 1 to m + 1 carbon atoms where the mean acyl chain length m has a value in a range from 7 to 10 or 11.  Commercially available feedstocks for these acyl groups are likely to include a small percentage of acyl groups which differ from the majority and may have a branched rather than linear chain.  Thus it is likely that more than 90% but less than 100% of the acyl groups will meet the desired criterion of chain lengths in a range from in - 1 to m + 1 carbon atoms.<br>
Linear aliphatic acyl groups may be obtained from natural sources, in which case the number of carbon atoms in the acyl group is likely to be an even number or may be derived synthetically from petroleum as the raw material in which case both odd an even numbered chain lengths are available.<br>
Synthetic methods for the esterification of saccharides are well known.  The esterification of cellobiose has been reported by Takada et al in Liquid Crystals,    (1995) Volume 19, pages 441-448.  This article gives a procedure for the production of the alpha anomers of cellobiose octa-alkanoates by esterification of p-cellobiose using an alkanoic acid together with trifluoracetic anhydride.<br><br>
Further materials useful as structurants (and which are also the subject of a co-pending application) have the following general structure (Tl):<br>
  (Tl)<br>
in which  Y and Y1  are  independently  -CH2-  or  &gt;C0<br>
Q and Q1  are  each  a hydrocarbyl  group  of  at  least   6  carbon<br>
atoms   and m  is   from 2   to   4,.   preferably   2.<br>
It is preferred that rc is  2  so  that  the  structurant compounds  comply with a  general   formula   (T2) :<br>
Q„0—Y—CH—CH—Y1—O-Q1<br>
OH     OH	v    "<br>
The groups Y and Y1 will usually be identical, i.e. both (methylene or both carbonyl. The  groups Q  and Q1 may not be the same but often will be identical to each other.<br>
In the formula T2 above, if Y and Y1 are methylene groups, the compound is a derivative of threitol, which is 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroxybutane, while if m is 2 and Y and Y1 are<br><br>
carbonyl groups, the compound is a diester of tartaric acid, which is 2,3-dihydroxybutane-l,4-dioic acid.<br>
It is preferred that each group Q and Q1 contains an aromatic nucleus which may be phenyl or, less preferably, some other aromatic group.  Thus Q and Q1 may be groups of the formula<br>
Ar-(CH2)n -where Ar denotes an aromatic nucleus, notably phenyl or substituted phenyl and n is from 0 to 10.<br>
An aromatic nucleus (Ar) is preferably unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents selected from alkyl, alkyloxy, hydroxy, halogen or nitro.<br>
where<br>
n = 0 to 10, preferably 0 to 3, more preferably 1, 2 or 3;<br>
One substituent may be an alkyl or alkyloxy group with a long alkyl chain.  Thus a formula for preferred forms of these structurants can be given as<br><br><br>
Y -  -CH2-   or  &gt;C=0<br>
Xj. = H,   CI,   Br,   F,   OH,   N02,   O-R,   or R,   where R is  an aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon  chain with  1  to  18  carbon atoms.<br>
X2 to X5  are  each  independently H,   CI,   Br,   F,   OH,   N02,   OCH3,<br>
or CH3	"	-":   °   """■■<br>
In these formulae above, the central carbon atoms which bear hydroxy groups are chiral centres.  Thus if m = 2, Y and Y1 are the same  and Q and Q1 are the same, the compounds will exist as R,R and S,S optically active forms as well as an optically inactive R,S form.  We may prefer to use the optically active R,E or S,S forms or a mixture of the two -which  may be a racemic mixture.<br>
Compounds within the general formulae Tl and T2 are available commercially. Also, syntheses of these compounds have been given in scientific literature where the compounds were being used as intermediates for purposes not related to the present invention.  Thus syntheses of threitol derivatives can be found in:<br>
Kataky et al, J. Chem Soc Perkin Trans vol 2 page 321 [1990] Tamoto et al, Tetrahedron Vol 40 page 4617 [1984], and Curtis et al, J.C.S. Perkin I Vol 15 page 1756 [1977]. Preparations of tartrate esters are found at: Hu et al J. Am. Chem. Soc. Vol 118, 4550 [1996] and<br><br>
Bishop et al J. Org Chem Vol56 5079 [1991].<br>
The amount of structurant in an emulsion composition of this invention is likely to be up to 25% or 30% by weight of the continuous phase, more likely from 1% or 2% up to 16% or . 20% of this phase.  In examples below, amounts of 4-8% and above, not exceeding 16%, are commonly used.  As a percentage of the whole composition the amount is from 1% up to 20%, probably from 1 to 12% or 15%.<br>
If a structurant is a combination of two materials, or if two structurants are used together, then the above percentages apply to the total amount of structurant.<br>
Carrier liquid<br>
The water-immiscible carrier liquid in the continuous phase comprises one or a mixture of materials which are relatively hydrophobic so as to be immiscible in water.  Some hydrophilic liquid may be included in the carrier, provided the overall carrier liquid mixture ,is immiscible with water. It will generally be desired that this carrier is liquid (in the absence of structurant) at temperatures of 15CC and above. It may have some volatility but its vapour pressure will generally be less than 4 kPa (30 mm Hg) at 258C so that the<br><br>
material can be referred to as an oil or mixture of oils. More specifically, it is desirable that at least 80% by weight of the hydrophobic carrier liquid should consist of materials with a vapour pressure not over this value of 4 kPa at 25°C.<br>
It is preferred that the hydrophobic carrier material includes a volatile liquid silicone, i.e. liquid polyorganosiloxane.  To class as "volatile" such material should have a measurable vapour pressure at 2.0   or 25°C. Typically the vapour pressure of a volatile silicone lies in-a range from 1 or 10 Pa up to 2 kPa at 25 °C<br>
It is desirable to include volatile silicone because it gives a "drier" feel to the applied film after the composition is applied to skin.<br>
Volatile polyorganosiloxanes can" be linear or cyclic or mixtures thereof.  Preferred cyclic siloxanes include polydimethsiloxanes and particularly those containing from 3 to 9 silicon atoms and preferably not more than 7 silicon atoms and most preferably from 4 to 6 silicon atoms, otherwise often .referred to as cyclomethicones.  Preferred linear siloxanes include polydimethylsiloxanes containing from 3 to 9 silicon atoms.  The volatile siloxanes normally<br><br>
by themselves  exhibit  viscosities  of below  10"5 mVsec   (10 centistokes),   and particularly  above  10"7 m2/sec   (0.1 centistokes) ,   the  linear  siloxanes normally exhibiting a viscosity of below  5  x   10"6 mVsec   (5  centistokes) .     The volatile  silicones  can  also  comprise branched linear or cyclic  siloxanes   such  as  the  aforementioned linear or cyclic siloxanes  substituted by one  or more pendant  -0-Si(CH3)3 groups.     Examples  of  commercially available  silicone  oils include  oils  having  grade  designations  344,   345,   244,   245  and 24 6  from  Dow  Corning  Corporation;   Silicone   7207  and Silicone 7158   from Union  Carbide  Corporation;   and SF1202  from General Electric.<br>
The hydrophobic  carrier  employed in  compositions  herein can alternatively  or  additionally  comprise  non-volatile silicone  oils,   which   include polyalkyl  siloxanes, polyalkylaryl  siloxanes   and polyethersiloxane  copolymers. These  can  suitably be   selected from dimethicone  and dimethicone  copolyols .     Commercially available  non-volatile silicone  oils  include  Dow Corning 556 and Dow Corning 200 series.<br>
The water-immiscible   liquid carrier may contain  from 0 to 100% by weight  of  one  or more  liquid silicones. Preferably,   there  is   sufficient  liquid silicone  to provide at<br><br>
least 10%, better at least 15%, by weight of the whole composition.  If silicone oil is used, volatile silicone preferably lies in a range from 20% possibly from 30 or 40% up to 100% of the weight of the water-immiscible carrier liquid. In many instances, when a non-volatile silicone oil is present, its weight ratio to volatile silicone oil is chosen in the range of from 1:3 to 1:40.<br>
Silicon-free hydrophobic liquids can be used instead of, or more preferably in addition to liquid silicones.  Silicon-free hydrophobic organic liquids which can be incorporated include liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons such as mineral oils or hydrogenated polyisobutene, often selected to exhibit a low viscosity.  Further examples of liquid hydrocarbons are polydecene and paraffins and isoparaffins of at least 10 carbon atoms.<br>
Other hydrophobic carriers are liquid aliphatic or aromatic esters.  Suitable aliphatic, esters, contain at least one long chain alkyl group, such as esters derived from Cx to C20 alkanols esterified with a C8 to C22 alkanoic acid or C6 to C10 alkanedioic acid.  The alkanol and acid moieties or mixtures thereof are preferably selected such that they each have a melting .point of below 20°C.  These esters include isopropyl myristate, lauryl myristate, isopropyl palmitate,<br><br>
diisopropyl sebacate and diisopropyl adipate.<br>
Suitable liquid aromatic esters, preferably having a melting point of below 20°C, include fatty alkyl benzoates. Examples of such esters include suitable C8 to C18 alkyl benzoates or mixtures thereof.<br>
Further instances of suitable hydrophobic carriers comprise liquid aliphatic ethers derived from at least one fatty alcohol,, such as myristyl ether derivatives e.g. PPG-3 myristyl ether or lower alkyl ethers of polyglycols such as PPG-14 butyl ether.<br>
Aliphatic alcohols which are solid" at 20°C/ such as<br>
stearyl alcohol are preferably absent or present in low concentration such as less than 5% by weight of the whole composition since these lead to visible white deposits when a composition is used.<br>
However, aliphatic alcohols which are liquid at 20°C may be employed.  These include branched chain alcohols of at least 10 carbon atoms such as isostearyl alcohol and octyl dodecanol.  ,<br>
Very polar materials are preferably excluded or present<br><br>
in only small quantity in the water-immiscible carrier liquid.  Preferably therefore, this liquid or mixture of liquids contains not more than 10% of its own weight, better not more than 5%, of any constituent which is a water-miscible compound.<br>
Silicon-free liquids can constitute from 0-100% of the water-immiscible liquid carrier, but it is preferred that silicone oil is present and that the amount of silicon-free constituents preferably constitutes up to 50 or €0% and in many instances from 10 or 15% up to 50 or 60% by weight of the carrier liquid.<br>
If any oxygen-containing silicon-free organic liquids are included in the hydrophobic carrier liquid., the amount of them is likely to be not over 70% by weight of the carrier liquid.  Smaller amounts, ranging up to 20, 30 or 35% by weight are likely.<br>
The carrier liquid must be compatible with the structurant.  If the structurant is too soluble or conversely is very insoluble in the carrier liquid it may fail to form a gel and the carrier liquid should be modified to alter its polarity.<br><br>
Disperse  Phase  Solvent<br>
The disperse phase is a solution of an  antiperspirant active  ingredient  in a solvent which is more polar than the carrier liquid of the disperse phase.     This  disperse phase comprises  water as  solvent and can  comprise  one  or more water-soluble or water-miscible liquids  in addition  to water.<br>
One  class  of water  soluble or water-miscible   liquids comprises   short  chain monohydric  alcohols,   e.g.   Ct  to  Ct  and especially ethanol or isopropanol,   which can  impart a deodorising capability to the  formulation.     A further class of hydrophilic liquids  comprises diols  or polyols  preferably having a melting point of below 40°C,   or which  are  water miscible.     Examples  of water-soluble  or water-miscible liquids with at  least one  free hydroxy group  include ethylene  glycol,-   1,2-propylene  glycol,   1,3-butylene  glycol, hexylene  glycol,   diethylene glycol,   dipropylene  glycol,   2-ethoxyethanol,   diethylene glycol monomethylether, triethyleneglycol monomethylether  and  sorbitol.     Especially preferred are propylene glycol and glycerol.<br>
The disperse phase constitutes  from 25 to  85% of the weight of the composition preferably from 25  to  80% more<br><br>
preferably from 25 or 35% up to 50 or 65%,  while the continuous phase with the structurant therein provides the balance from. 15 or 35% up to 75% of the weight of the composition.  Compositions with a high proportion of disperse phase i.e. from 65 to 85% disperse phase may be advantageous because the large proportion of disperse phase can make a contribution to hardness.  The proportion of water in an emulsion according to the present invention is often selected in the range of up to 60%, and particularly from 10% up to 40% or 50% of the whole formulation.<br>
A composition of this invention will generally include one or more emulsifying surfactants which may be anionic, cationic, zwitterionic and/or nonionic surfactants. -The proportion of emulsifier in the composition is often<br>
selected in the range up to 10% by weight and in many instances from 0.1 or 0-25 up to 5% by weight of the composition.  Most preferred is an amount from 0.1 or 0.25 up to 3% by weight.  Nonionic emulsifiers are frequently classified by HLB value. It is desirable to use an emulsifier or a mixture of emulsifiers with an overall HLB value in a range from 2 to 10 preferably from 3 to 8.<br>
It may be convenient to use a combination of two or more emulsifiers which have different HLB values above and<br><br>
below the desired value-     By employing the two emulsifiers together in appropriate  ratio,   it is  readily feasible  to attain a weighted average HLB value that promotes  the formation of an emulsion.<br>
Many suitable emulsifiers of high HLB are nonionic ester or ether emulsifiers  comprising a polyoxyalkylene moiety,   especially a polyoxyethylene moiety,   often containing  from about  2   to  80,   and especially 5  to  60 oxyethylene  units,   and/or  contain  a polyhydroxy compound such  as  glycerol  or  sorbitol  or other  alditol  as  hydrophilic moiety.     The hydrophilic moiety can contain polyoxypropylene.     The  emulsifiers  additionally contain a hydrophobic alkyl,   alkenyl  or aralkyl moiety,   normally containing  from about   8   to  50  carbons  and particularly  from 10  to  30  carbons.     The  hydrophobic moiety can be  either linear  or branched  and  is  often  saturated,   though  it  can be unsaturated,   and is  optionally fluorinated.     The hydrophobic moiety can comprise  a  mixture  of chain   lengths,   for example those deriving  from  tallow,   lard,   palm oil,   sunflower  seed oil or soya bean  oil.     Such nonionic  surfactants  can also be derived from a polyhydroxy  compound such  as  glycerol  or sorbitol  or other alditols.     Examples  of emulsifiers  include ceteareth-10  to  -25,   ceteth-10-25,   steareth-10-25   (i.e.   C16 to C18 alcohols  ethoxylated with 10  to  25  ethylene oxide<br><br>
residues) and PEG-15-25 stearate or distearate.  Other suitable examples include C10-C20 fatty acid mono, di or tri¬glycerides .  Further examples include C18-C22 fatty alcohol ethers of polyethylene oxides (8 to 12 EO) .<br>
Examples of emulsifiers, which typically have a low RLE value, often a value from 2 to 6 are fatty acid mono or possibly diesters of polyhydric alcohols such as glycerol, sorbitol, erythritol °r trimethylolpropane.  The fatty acyl moiety is often from Clt   to C22 and is saturated in many instances, including cetyl, stearyl, arachidyl and behenyl. Examples include monoglycerides of palmitic or stearic acid, sorbitol mono or diesters of myristic, palmitic or stearic acid, and trimethylolpropane monoesters of .stearic acid.<br>
A particularly desirable class of emulsifiers comprises dimethicone copolymers, namely polyoxyalkyiene modified dimethylpolysiloxaneS-  The polyoxyalkylene group is often a. polyoxyethyiene (POE) or polyoxypropyiene (POP) or a copolymer of POE and POP.  The copolymers often terminate in C1 to C12 alkyl groups <br>
Suitable emulsifiers and co-emulsifiers are widely available under many trade"names including Abil™, Arlacel™, Brij TH, CremophorTH, Dehydrol™, Dehymuls™, Emerest TH,<br><br>
Lameform™, Pluronic™, Prisorine™, Quest PGPR™, Span «, Tween ™, SF1228, DC3225C and Q2-5200.<br>
Antiperspirant Actives 3<br>
Antiperspirant actives, are preferably incorporated in an amount of from 0.5-60%, particularly from 5 to 30% or 40% and especially from 5 or 10% to 30 or 35% of the weight of the whole composition.<br>
0<br>
Antiperspirant actives for use herein are often<br>
selected from astringent active salts, including in<br>
particular aluminium, zirconium and mixed<br>
aluminium/zirconium salts, including both inorganic salts, 5  salts with organic anions and complexes. Preferred<br>
astringent salts include aluminium, zirconium and<br>
aluminium/zirconium halides" and halohydrate salts, such as<br>
chlorohydrates.<br>
:0      Aluminium halohydrates are usually defined by the general formula Al2 (OH) xQy. wH20 in which Q represents chlorine, bromine or iodine, x is variable from 2 to 5 and x + y = 6 while wH20 represents a variable amount of hydration. Especially effective aluminium halohydrate salts, known as<br>
25  activated aluminium chlorohydrates, are described in EP-A-<br><br>
6739 (Unilever NV et al), the contents of which specification is incorporated herein by reference.  Some activated salts do not retain their enhanced activity in the presence of water but are useful in substantially anhydrous formulations, i.e. formulations which do not contain a distinct aqueous phase.<br>
Zirconium actives can usually be represented by the empirical general formula: ZrO(OH}2ll-nSBi-wH2° in which z is a variable in the range of from 0.9 to 2.0 so that the value 2n-nz is zero or positive, n is the valency of B, and B is selected from the group consisting of chloride, other halide, sulphamate, sulphate and mixtures thereof.  Possible hydration to a variable extent is represented by wH20. Preferable is that 3 represents chloride and the variable z lies in the range from 1.5 to 1.87. In practice, such zirconium salts are usuallv not employed by themselves, but as a component of a combined aluminium and zirconium-based antiperspirant.<br>
The above aluminium and zirconium salts may have coordinated and/or bound water in various quantities and/or may be present as polymeric species, mixtures or complexes. In particular, zirconium hydroxy salts often represent a range of salts having various amounts of the hydroxy group.<br><br>
Zirconium aluminium chlorohydrate may be particularly preferred.<br>
Antiperspirant  complexes  based  on  the  above-mentioned astringent  aluminiuin  and/or  zirconium  salts   can be  employed. The  complex  often employs  a  compound with a  carboxylate group,   and advantageously this   is  an  amino  acid.     Examples of  suitable  amino acids   include  dl-tryptophan,   dl-f$-phenylalanine,   dl-valine,   dl-methionine  and  (3-alanine,   and preferably  glycine  which  has   the   formula  CH2 (NH2) COOH.<br>
It is  highly desirable  to  employ  complexes  of a combination  of  aluminium halohydrates  and zirconium chiorohydrates   together with amino  acids  such  as  glycine, which  are   disclosed  in   US-A-3792068    (Luedders   et  ai) . Certain of   those Al/Zr   complexes   are   commonly  called  ZAG  in the literature.     ZAG  actives  generally  contain  aluminium, zirconium  and  chloride   with  an  Al/Zr   ratio   in   a  range   from 2 to   10,   especially  2   to   6,   an Al/Cl   ratio  from  2.1   to   0.9  and a variable  amount  of  glycine.     Actives  of  this  preferred type  are available  from Westwood,   from  Summit   and  from Reheis.<br>
Other  actives  which may be utilised include  astringent titanium salts,   for  example  those  described  in  GB  2299506A.<br><br>
The proportion of solid antiperspirant salt in the composition normally includes the weight of any water of hydration and any complexing agent that may also be present in the solid active;  However, when the active salt is in solution, its weight excludes any water present.<br>
The antiperspirant active will often provide from 3 to 60%  by weight of the aqueous disperse phase, particularly from 10% or 20% up to 55% or 60% of that phase.<br>
Optional incrred±en.t.s<br>
Optional ingredients in compositions of this invention can include deodorants, for example at a concentration of up to about 10% w/w.  Suitable deodorant actives can comprise deodorant effective concentrations of antiperspirant metal salts, deoperfumes, and/or microbicides, including particularly bactericides, such as chlorinated aromatics, including biguanide derivatives, of which materials known as Irgasan DP300 w (Triclosan), Tricloban % and Chlorhexidine warrant specific mention.  A yet another class comprises biguanide salts such as available under the trade mark Cosmosil ™.<br>
Other optional ingredients include wash-off agents,<br><br>
often present in an amount of up to 10% w/w to assist in the removal of the formulation from skin or clothing.  Such wash-off agents are typically nonionic surfactants such as esters or1 ethers containing a C8 to C22 alkyl moiety and a hydrophilic moiety which can comprise a polyoxyalkylene group (POE or POP) and/or a polyol.<br>
Another optional constituent of the formulation is a polymeric secondary structurant.  Examples of such structurants which can be employed include polymeric waxes and organo polysiloxane elastomers such as reaction products of a vinyl terminated polysiloxane and a cross linking agent br alkyl or alkyl polyoxyalkylene-terminated poly (methyl substituted) or poly (phenyl substituted) siloxanes. Polymers containing both siloxane and hydrogen bonding groups, which might be used as secondary structurants, have been disclosed in WO 97/36572 and KO 99/06473.  A number of polyamides have also been disclosed as structurants for hydrophobic liquids.  Polyacrylamides, polyacryiates or polyalkylene oxides may be used to structure or thicken the disperse phase if it is aqueous.<br>
The compositions herein can incorporate one or more cosmetic adjuncts conventionally contemplatable for antiperspirant solids or soft solids.  Such cosmetic<br><br>
adjuncts can include skin feel improvers, such as talc or finely divided polyethylene, for example in an amount of up to about 10%; skin benefit agents such as allantoin or lipids, for example in an amount of up to 5%; colours; skin cooling agents other than the already mentioned alcohols, such a menthol and menthol derivatives, often in an amount of up to 2%, all of these percentages being by weight of the composition.  A commonly employed adjunct is a perfume, which is normally present at a concentration of from 0 to 4% and in many formulations from 0.25 to 2% by weight of the composition.<br>
Translucent/Transparent Compositions<br>
A composition of this invention can be formulated such that the emulsion is translucent or transparent.  In order to do this the refractive indices of the water-immiscible continuous phase and the polar or aqueous disperse phase must be matched to each other and the-- value of refractive index at which they are matched must also approximately match the refractive index of the structurant.<br>
The refractive index of a fibrous network of a structurant can be determined by using that structurant to gel a number of oils or oil mixtures of differing refractive<br><br>
index. When the resulting gel is transparent, the refractive index of the oil or oil mixture (which can be determined by conventional measurement) is. a good approximation to the refractive index of the structurant. The oils or mixtures or oils should be chosen from these " which are gelled well by the structurant to avoid interfering effects.  When the gel is not transparent, but is translucent, it will indicate a refractive index which is not precisely matched to the refractive index of the structurant, and thus indicate an amount of mismatch which can be tolerated without loss of translucency.  It is likely that the matched refractive indices of the liquid phases will be not over 0.07 units below and not over 0.04 units above the refractive index of the structurant.<br>
Some examples of oils which may be used to make mixtures which vary in refractive index are:<br>
volatile silicone (refractive index of about 1.40)<br>
C12-i5 alkyl benzoate (refractive index of about 1.48)<br>
Which available as Finsolv TN and/or<br>
octylmethoxycinnamate (refractive index of about 1.54)<br>
which is available as Parsol MCX.<br>
polyphenylsiloxane (DC70) (refractive index of about<br>
1.53)<br><br>
Using this method we have determined the refractive indices of some structurants, namely:-<br>
N-lauroyl L-glutamic acid di-n-butylamide   approx 1.4 8<br>
12-hydroxy stearic acid	.approx 1.52<br>
a-cellobiose octa-esters with Ca to C12<br>
fatty acids	approx 1.48<br>
For the continuous phase, silicon-free water-immiscible liquid oils generally have refractive indices in a range from 1.43 to 1.49 at 22°C and can be used alone or mixed together to give a silicon-free carrier liquid with refractive index in this range. . Volatile silicone oils generally have a refractive index slightly below 1.40 at 22 °C, but carrier liquid mixtures with refractive indices in the range from 1.41 to 1.4 6 can be obtained by mixing volatile silicone with other oils.  Non-volatile silicone oils generally have refractive indices in a range from 1.45 to 1.48 at 22°C and so can be included when desired.<br>
The refractive index of the continuous phase will be very close to the refractive index of the carrier liquid (usually a carrier liquid mixture) which is its principal component.<br><br>
For the disperse phase, a solution of an antiperspirant active salt in water alone will generally display a refractive index below 1.425.  The refractive index can be raised by incorporating a diol or polyol into the aqueous solution.  It is believed to be novel to match the refractive index of a polar disperse phase to that of a " structurant network within a continuous phase.  Moreover, it can be achieved without using so much diol or polyol as will make the composition excessively sticky.<br>
For the regular production of compositions with optimum transparency it may prove desirable to monitor the refractive indices of the raw materials to detect any batch to batch variation.  If necessary the composition of a<br>
liquid phase can be adjusted by variation of the quantity of a constituent material.<br>
Mechanical Properties and Product Packages<br>
The compositions of this invention are structured liquids and may be firm or soft in appearance.  Even a soft solid has an ability to sustain its own shape, for instance if it is removed from a mould without being subjected to shear it will retain its shape for at least 30 seconds,<br><br>
usually longer, at about 20°C.<br>
A composition-of this invention will usually be marketed as a product comprising a container with a quantity of the composition therein, where the container has at least one aperture for the delivery of composition, and means for urging the composition in the container towards the delivery aperture.  Conventional containers take the form of a barrel of oval cross section with the delivery aperture(s) at one end of the barrel.<br>
A composition of this invention is preferably sufficiently rigid that it is not apparently deformable by hand pressure, even though a surface layer will transfer as a film to skin, and is suitable for use as a stick product in which a quantity of the composition in the form of a stick is accommodated within a container barrel having an open end at which an end portion of the stick of composition is exposed for use.  The opposite end of the barrel is closed.<br>
Generally the container will include a cap for its open end and a component part which is sometimes referred to as an elevator or piston fitting within the barrel and capable of relative axial movement along it.  The stick of<br><br>
composition is accommodated in the barrel between the piston and the open end of the barrel*.  The piston is used to urge the stick of composition along the barrel.  The piston arid stick of composition may be moved axially along the barrel by manual pressure on the underside of the piston using a" finger or rod inserted within the barrel.  Another possibility is that a rod attached to the piston projects through a slot or slots in the barrel and is used to move the piston and stick.  Preferably the container also includes a transport mechanism for moving the piston comprising a threaded rod which extends axially into the stick through a correspondingly threaded aperture in the piston, and means mounted on the barrel for rotating the rod.  Conveniently the rod is rotated by means of a handwheel mounted on the barrel at i£s closed end, i.e. the opposite end to the delivery opening.<br>
If a composition of this invention is softer,, but still capable of sustaining its own shape it will be more suited for dispensing from a barrel with a closure instead of an open end, where the closure has one or more apertures through which composition from the barrel can be extruded. The number and design of such apertures is at the discretion of the designer of the package.<br><br>
The component parts of such containers are often made from thermoplastic materials, for example polypropylene or polyethylene.  Descriptions of suitable containers, some of which include further features, are found in US patents 4865231, 5000356 and 5573341.<br>
Measurement of Properties<br>
i) Penetrometer<br>
The hardness and rigidity of a composition which is a firm solid can be determined by penetro"metry.  If the composition is a softer solid, this will be observed as a substantial lack of any resistance to the penetrometer probe.   .   -<br>
A  suitable procedure is to utilises a lab plant PNT penetrometer equipped with a Seta wax needle (weight 2.5 grams) which has a. cone angle at the point of the needle specified to be 9° 10" ± 15".  A sample of the composition with a flat upper surface is used. The needle is lowered onto the surface of the composition and then a penetration hardness measurement is conducted by allowing the needle with its holder to drop under a total weight, (i.e. the combined weight of needle and holder) of 50 grams for a period of five seconds after which the depth of penetration is noted.<br><br>
Desirably the test is carried out at a number of points on each sample and the results" are averaged.  Utilising a test of this nature, an appropriate hardness for use in an open-ended dispensing container is a penetration of less* than 30 mm in this test, for example in a range from 2 to"30 mm.  Preferably the penetration is in a range from 5mm to 20 mm.<br>
In a specific protocol for this test measurements on a stick were performed in the stick barrel.  The stick was wound up to project from the open end of the barrel, and then cut off to leave a flat, uniform surface.  The needle was carefully lowered to the stick surface, and then a—" ■ penetration hardness measurement was conducted.  This process was carried out- at six different points on the stick surface.  The hardness reading quoted is the average value of the 6 measurements.<br>
ii) Texture analyser<br>
The hardness of a softer solid can be measured by using a  texture analyser.  This test apparatus can move a blunt probe into or out from a sample at a controlled speed and at the same time measure the applied force.  The parameter which is determined as hardness is a function of the peak force and the projected area of indentation.<br><br>
A specific test protocol used a Stable Micro systems TA.XT2i Texture Analyser.  A metal sphere, of diameter 9.5mm, was attached to the underside of the Texture Analyser"s 5 kg load cell such that it could be used for indenting a sample placed beneath it on the baseplate of the instrument.  After positioning the sample, the sphere position was adjusted until it was just above the sample surface. Texture Expert Exceed  software was used to generate the subsequent motion profile used in the test method.  This profile initially indented the sphere into "the sample at an indentation speed of 0.05mm/s until a designated force was reached, which was chosen such that the distance of penetration into the sample was less than the radius of the sphere.  At this load the direction of motion of the sphere was immediately reversed to withdraw the sphere from the sample at the same speed of 0.05mm/s. During the course of the test, the data acquired were time{s), distance (mm) and force (N) and the data acquisition rate was 25 Hz.<br>
Suitable samples for measurement were either contained in stick barrels, which had a screw mechanism, or in 15 ml glass jars.  For the barrel samples, the stick was wound up until it protruded above the edges of the barrel and then a knife was used to skim the top of the barrel in such a way<br><br>
as to leave a flat uniform surface.  The stick was then pushed back into the barrel as far as possible to minimise any mechanical interference resulting from the compliance of the screw mechanism in the pack.  Two indents were generally made either side of the screw.  The samples in the 15 ml jars needed no surface preparation but only had enough surface area for a single indentation test to be performed.<br>
The data associated with each test were manipulated using standard spreadsheet software and used to calculate the hardness, H,   using the following equation:<br><br>
where Fis the peak lead and A, is the projected area of the indentation remaining on unloading.  This area can be calculated geometrically from the plastic indentation depth. This is slightly less than the total penetration depth measured under load because of elastic deformation of the sample.  The plastic indentation depth is calculated from a graph of the unloading-force-versus-total-penetration-depth. The initial slope of this unloading data depends on the initial elastic recovery of the sample.  The plastic indentation depth is estimated from an . intercept between the<br><br>
zero  force  axis  and a  straight line drawn- at a-"tangent-to the  initial part of  the unloading slope.<br>
Similar  hardness  measurements were  also  done  using  a desktop  Instron  Universal   Testing Machine   (Model   5566) fitted with a  10 N load cell,   and the data analysis performed in  the  same  way.<br>
iii)   Deposition  and whiteness  of deposit<br>
Another  test  of  the properties  of  a  composition   is   the amount of  the  composition  which  is  delivered onto  a   surface when  the  composition  is  drawn across  that  surface (representing  the   application  of  a  stick product   to  human skin) .     To   carry out   this   test  of deposition,   a   sample   of the  composition with  standardised shape  and  size   is   fitted to  apparatus  which  draws   the  sample  across   a  test   surface under  standardised conditions.     The  amount  transferred  to the   surface   is  determined  as  an  increase   in  the   weight   of the  substrate   to which  it  is  applied.     If desired  the colour,   opacity or  clarity of the deposit may  subsequently be  determined.<br>
A specific procedure   for such tests  used apparatus  to apply a deposit  from  a  stick onto a  substrate  under standardised conditions  and then measures  the mean   level  of<br><br>
white deposits using Image analysis.<br>
The substrates used were<br>
a:   12 x 28cm strip of grey abrasive paper (3M™ P800<br>
WetorDry™ Carborundum paper)<br>
b:   12 x 28cm strip of black Worsted wool fabric.<br>
The substrates were weighed before use.  The sticks were previously unused and with domed top surface unaltered.<br>
The apparatus comprised a flat base to which a flat substrate was attached by a clip at each end.  A pillar having a mounting to receive a standard size stick barrel was mounted on an arm that was moveable horizontally across the substrate by means of a pneumatic piston.<br>
Each stick was kept at ambient laboratory temperature overnight before the measurement was made.  The stick was advanced to project a measured amount from the barrel.  The barrel was then placed in the apparatus and a spring was positioned to biassed the stick against the substrate with a standardised force. The apparatus was operated to pass the stick laterally across the substrate eight times..  The substrate was carefully removed from the rig and reweighed.<br><br>
Whiteness  of  Deposit<br>
The  deposits  from the  previous   test were  assessed  for their whiteness  after  an   interval  of  24  hours  approximately.<br>
This  was  done using  a  Sony XC77  monochrome video  camera with a Cosmicar  16mm  focal  length  lens positioned vertically above  a black table  illuminated  from a high  angle  using fluorescent  tubes  to  remove  shadowing.     The  apparatus  was initially calibrated using  a  reference  grey card,   after  the fluorescent  tubes  had been  turned on  for  long  enough  to give a steady light  output.     A cloth  or  Carborundum paper with a deposit  thereon  from the  previous   test was placed on  the table  and the  camera was  used  to  capture  an  image.     An  area of  the  image  of  the  deposit  was   selected  and  analysed using a Kontron   IEAS   image   analyser.      This   notionally  divided  the image  into  a  large  array  of pixels   and measured  the  grey level  of each pixel  on  a   scale   of  0   (black)   to  255   (white). The  average of  the  grey  intensity was  calculated.     This  was a measure  of the  whiteness   of  the  deposit,   with higher numbers  indicating a whiter deposit.      It was  assumed that low numbers  show  a  clear  deposit  allowing  the  substrate colour to be  seen.<br><br>
It has been found desirable to carry out deposition of a standard stick composition in the manner specified above, and determine the whiteness of the deposit, as a control.<br>
iv) Light transmission<br>
The translucency of a composition may be measured by placing a sample of standardised thickness in the light path of a spectrophotometer and measuring transmittance, as a percentage of light transmitted in the absence of the gel.<br>
We have carried out this test using a dual-beam spectrophotometer.  The sample of composition was poured hot into a 4.5 ml cuvette made of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and allowed, no cool to an ambient temperature of 20-25°C. Such a cuvette gives a 1 "cm thickness of composition. Measurement was carried out at 580 nm, with an identical but empty cuvette in the reference beam of the<br>
spectrophotometer, after the sample in the cuvette had been held for 24   hours.  We have observed that a composition which gives a transmittance of as little as 1% in this test is perceived by eye as "translucent".  If a stick is made from a composition with 3% transmittance, it is possible to see cavities made by boring beneath the surface of the sample.  By contrast, a conventional stick structure with stearyl alcohol is so opaque that it is impossible to see<br><br>
beneath its surface.  A transmittance measured at any temperature in the range from 20-25°C is usually adequately accurate, but measurement is made at 22°C if more precision is required.  In a number of preferred examples we have achieved a transmittance of 20% or above.<br>
Preparation<br>
Compositions of this invention can be produced by processes which involve forming a heated mixture of the composition at a temperature such that the structurant is in solution in the continuous phase, pouring that mixture into a mould, which may take the form of a dispensing container, and then cooling the mixture whereupon the structurant solidifies within water-immiscible liquid phase, and thereby gels that phase and hence the whole composition.<br>
A convenient process sequence comprises first forming a solution of the structurant in the water-immiscible liquid. This is normally carried out by agitating the mixture at a temperature sufficiently high that all the structurant dissolves (the dissolution temperature) such as a temperature in a range from 50 to 120°C.<br>
If any emulsifier is being used, this is conveniently<br><br>
mixed into this liquid phase.  Separately an aqueous or hydrophilic disperse phase is prepared by introduction of antiperspirant active into the liquid part o"f that phase (if this is necessary; antiperspirant actives can sometime be supplied in aqueous solution which can be utilised as is) . This solution of antiperspirant active which will become the disperse phase is preferably heated to a temperature similar to that of the continuous phase with structurant therein, but without exceeding the boiling point of the solution and then mixed with the continuous phase.  Alternatively the solution is introduced at a rate which maintains the temperature of the mixture.  If necessary a pressurised apparatus could be used to allow a. higher temperature to be reached.  After the two phases are mixed, the resulting mixture is introduced into a dispensing container such as a stick barrel.  This is usually carried out at a temperature 5 to 30°C above the setting temperature of the composition. 7the container and. contents are then cooled to ambient temperature.  Cooling may be brought" about by nothing more than allowing the container and contents to cool.  Cooling may be assisted by blowing ambient or even refrigerated air over the containers and their contents.<br><br>

Example 1<br>
Emulsion sticks were prepared with formulations as set out in the table below.<br>
To prepare these sticks, the cyclomethicone was mixed with the other organic liquids including the cetyl dimethicone copolyol which functioned as an emulsifier (silicone surfactant) and with the GP1 structurant.  The mixture was heated with gentle stirring to a temperature of 120°C to dissolve the structurant.  It was then allowed to cool to 100°C.<br>
The disperse phase (also referred to as internal phase) was an aluminium zirconium active dissolved in a polyol and water.  This disperse phase was pre-heated to 92°C and added slowly to the organic liquids over a period of one minute while mixing with a Silverson mixer.  After addition was complete the formulation was mixed at higher speed for five minutes.  Stirring speed was then reduced for a further one minute after which the mixture was poured into stick barrels and allowed to cool undisturbed to ambient laboratory temperature.  The sticks were tested by penetrometer, in one case by texture analyser, and for whiteness of deposits by the test procedures given earlier.<br><br>
It was observed that the sticks were translucent.<br><br><br>
Example 2<br>
Sticks were prepared with formulations tabulated below. As the first step, the hydrophobic phase was prepared by combining the cosmetic oils and solvents, the emulsifier introduced and dissolved in a Silverson mixer.  The oryzanol (the sterol ester) was introduced and dissolved by heating and stirring 500 rpm.  Once the oryzanol had dissolved completely, the sterol was added and the mixture again heated and stirred until a clear solution had been obtained. The solution was then allowed to cool under gentle stirring until it reached a temperature of about 5-10 degrees.above its gelling point determined in a preliminary trial.<br>
In a second step, the aqueous phase was prepared by combining the antiperspirant solution with the other aqueous phase components.  This was heated to the same temperature as the continuous phase solution.<br>
In the third step, the aqueous phase was introduced slowly into the hydrophobic phase whilst mixing with the Silverson mixer and maintained at a constant temperature and at constant shear conditions.  The mixture was sheared for up to 10 minutes, until the aqueous phase had been evenly dispersed. The resulting emulsion was left to stand and to de-aerate.  It was then poured into stick barrels and allowed to cool to laboratory ambient temperature and solidify.  A number of the<br><br>
resultant sticks were evaluated for penetration, deposition and whiteness by the methods described above after the stick had been maintained for at least 24 hours at ambient laboratory temperature.<br><br>

All of the compositions in this Example gave slightly translucent o"r opaque medium hard to hard white sticks. Qualitative assessment showed that all gave lower white deposits on skin than a conventional white solid stick (cws) structured with 15% stearyl alcohol and 3% castor wax,<br><br>
included as the last column of the table above.<br>
Example 3<br>
Cellobiose was esterified with nonanoic acid to yield the fully esterified product in the form of its a-anomer following a procedure generally as described in Takada et al, Liquid Crystals, Volume 19, page 441 (1995).<br>
The following materials were used: p-D-cellobiose, 20 grams, 0.058 moles Nonanoic acid, 591.6 grams, 3.74 moles Trifluoroacetic anhydride, 2 97.6 grams, 1.42 moles.<br>
These materials were obtained from Acres Organics -Fisher Scientific.<br>
Into a 2 litre flange pot: equipped with an overhead stirrer, water condenser and addition inlet was placed the nonanoic acid together with the trifluoroacetic anhydride. The resultant clear mixture was stirred up and heated to 100°C using a silicone oil bath and temperature probe.  During heating it was noted that the colour of the reaction mixture darkened and developed a dark brown tinge.  After allowing the mixture to stir for one hour at 100°C, the cellobiose was slowly added via a solid powder funnel to the dark activated solution, and a dirty brown suspension was formed which re-<br><br>
dissolved forming a clear black solution within 10-20 minutes.<br>
The reaction flask was then maintained at 100°C for a total of 6 hours then cooled down to ambient laboratory temperature.  Next the contents of the flask were transferred into 2 litres of methanol containing 10% de-ionised water in an ice-cooled 5 litre beaker.  Immediately an off-white solid precipitate came out of solution, this was filtered off and collected.  The crude solid was recrystallised a total of 4 times from a tetrahydrofuran/methanol solution producing a white solid product.<br>
The product cellobiose octa-nonanoate also designated esterified cellobiose - Cs was obtained in a quantity of 31-5 g which was a 37% yield.  It had a melting point of 110°C. The infra-red spectrum showed an absorption peak at 1739 cm-1 for the ester carbonyl group.  The arount of free acid could be determined from .its absorption peak at 1705 cm"1.<br>
The n.m.r. spectrum showed the amount of cellobiose which was fully esterified to be 93.5% and showed the proportions of product which were the a- and (3-anomers, (93.5% a-anomer) .<br>
This procedural   route  was  also used to prepare  the corresponding ester of cellobiose" and decanoic acid.<br><br>
Opaque emulsion sticks were prepared with these cellobiose esters as structurant in formulations as set out in tables below.<br>
Tp-"prepare these sticks, the cyclomethicone was mixed with the other organic liquids (if any) including the cetyl dimethicone copolyol which functioned as an emulsifier (silicone surfactant) and the mixture was heated with gentle stirring to a temperature 5 to 10°C above the temperature at which the structurant had been found to dissolve.  The esterified cellobiose was then added and allowed to dissolve.<br>
The disperse phase (also referred to as internal phase) was an aluminium zirconium active dissolved in water or in a mixture of a polyol and water.  This disperse phase was pre¬heated to the same temperature as the organic oils containing the esterified cellobiose and added slowly to them over a period of one minute while mixing with a Silverson mixer. After addition was complete the formulation was mixed at higher speed for five minutes.  Stirring speed was then reduced for a further one minute after which the mixture was poured into stick barrels and allowed to cool undisturbed to ambient laboratory temperature.  The sticks were tested by penetrometer, by texture analyser and for whiteness of deposits, in each instance by the test procedures given earlier.  All of the sticks were opaque although without the<br><br>
chalky white appearance of a commercial white stick structured with stearyl alcohol and castor wax.<br><br>

EXAMPLE  4<br>
The procedure used in Example 3 was repeated to prepare a number of emulsion sticks with formulations set out in the 5  following tables.  The. continuous and disperse phases were<br>
formulated to have refractive indices which matched closely at the value given in the "tables.  These sticks were tested as before and their properties are also given in these tables.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
«■.<br><br>
Example 5<br>
Opaque emulsion sticks were prepared with formulations as set out in the tables below.<br>
To prepare these sticks, the structurant compound was mixed with the carrier liquid including the cetyl dimethicone copolyol which functioned as an emulsifier  (silicone surfactant) and the mixture was heated with gentle stirring until the structurant dissolved.  The temperature was then adjusted to about 90°C.<br>
The disperse phase (also referred to as internal phase) was an aluminium zirconium active dissolved in water and slightly diluted with additional water.  This disperse phase was pre-heated to about 90°C, i.e. the same temperature as the organic liquid mixture containing the structurant and added slowly to them over a period of one minute while mixing with a Silverson mixer.  After addition was complete the formulation was mixed at higher speed for five minutes.  After this the mixture was poured into stick barrels and allowed to cool undisturbed to ambient laboratory temperature. . The sticks were tested by penetrometer, by texture analyser and for whiteness of deposits, in each instance by the test procedures given earlier.  All of the sticks were opaque.<br><br>

Example 6<br>
12-hydroxystearic acid was converted to the corresponding amide by reaction with 1, l1 -carbonyldiimidazole.  The procedure was as follows:<br>
To a three necked" 1 litre round bottom flask equipped with water condenser, overhead mechanical stirrer and pressure equalising funnel was added 12-hydroxystearic acid (15.Og, .4.75 x 10"2 mol) followed by 300 mis of tetrahydrofuran.  To ~this was then added 1,1"-carbonyldiimidazole (8.9g, 5.50 x 10"2 mol) and the reaction left stirring at 4 0°C for 1 hour, after which time ammonia gas was bubbled through for a period, of 2 hours, the reaction being kept at 4 0°C.  After this time the reaction was cooled to room temperature and the tetrahydrofuran removed in vacuo.  The solid white was them washed successively with 4 x 200 mis of water and then filtered.  The white compound was then dried in a vacuum oven and recrystallised from ethanol to give a white solid.<br>
The product, 12-hydroxystearamide, was obtained in 60% yield.  It had melting point 98-99°C and its structure was confirmed by proton n.m.r. and infra red spectroscopy.  Peaks were observed at 1654cm"1 and 3209cm"1.<br>
The material was used as a structurant in translucent sticks of the formulation shown in the table below, which also<br><br>
includes properties of the sticks as determined by test procedures described earlier.  The preparation of sticks was by the same method used in Example 5.  The gelation temperature was noted as about 85°C.<br><br>

Example 7<br>
_Sticks were prepared using the procedure given in Example 3.  The sticks were tested for hardness by texture analyser and/or by penetrometer.  They were observed to give deposits of low whiteness, but numerical data were not recorded.<br>
For some sticks in this example the refractive indices of the water-immiscible continuous phase and the polar antiperspirant active solution were matched sufficiently to give translucent sticks.  Some values of transmittance are shown.<br><br>

Example 8<br>
The procedure used in Example 3 was repeated to prepare a number of emulsion sticks with formulations set out in the following tables.  As in Example 4, the continuous and disperse phases were formulated to have refractive indices which matched closely at the value given in the tables.  The sticks were tested for hardness by texture analyser and/or by penetrometer.  They were observed to give deposits of low whiteness, consistent with their good transparency, but numerical data were not recorded.<br><br>
The refractive indices of sample quantities of the water-immiscible liquid mixture and the antiperspirant active solutions were checked before making the sticks.  If necessary their formulations were modified very slightly to optimise the refractive index match.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Wyample 9<br>
The procedure for making sticks used in Example 3 was used to prepare translucent emulsion sticks with the formulation below in which the structurant is oc-cellobiose octa-undecatoate ("CB11"). As in Example 4, the continuous and disperse phases were formulated to have refractive indices which matched closely at the value given.  The sticks were tested for hardness by texture analyser and/or by penetrometer.  They were observed to.give deposits of low whiteness.<br><br><br>
Example 10<br>
The procedure used in Example  3 was used to prepare  an opaque emulsion stick of the following formulation,   which included agents  to assist wash-off.</td>
