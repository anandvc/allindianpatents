				<td>COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING ORGANOSILOXANE RESINS FOR DELIVERING ORAL CARE SUBSTANCES<br>
FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to compositions for delivering oral care substances to the surfaces of the teeth. The composition forms a film on the surface to which it has been applied and provides sustained release of the oral care substance from the film for prolonged therapeutic, prophylactic, and/or cosmetic benefits. More specifically, the present invention relates to compositions comprising organosiloxane resins for delivering oral care substances to the tooth enamel. In addition, it is believed that the compositions herein may further provide sustained release benefits, to other oral surfaces, such as the gingival and mucosal tissues, as well as to the surfaces of the teeth.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Oral care products by which various oral care substances or actives can be delivered to the soft and hard tissues of the oral cavity have previously been known. Examples of such oral care products include, for example, brushing aids such as dentifrice products for delivery of anti-caries actives such as fluoride or other actives for the reduction of the bacteria that lead to the formation of plaque, and mouthwashes containing breath freshening actives and/or anti-bacterial actives. In addition, bleaching agents such as peroxide that can be applied directly to the surfaces of the teeth, i.e., to the tooth enamel, have been developed.<br>
However, it has been found that such conventional product forms typically do not provide substantivity sufficient to maintain actives on the hard and soft oral tissues for a period of time sufficient to enhance or prolong the therapeutic, prophylactic, and/or cosmetic benefits provided by the actives. Neither have such conventional product forms been able to provide sustained delivery of oral<br><br>
care actives, without periodic reapplication at relatively short time intervals, or without a special delivery device or containment means such as a mouthpiece.<br>
Attempts have previously been made to enhance the substantivity of whitening bleaches, bactericides, and other active components of oral care products. See, e.g., US patent no. 5,425,953 to Sintov ei al. on June 20, 1995, in which a film forming, water-soluble cellulosic polymer is used to deliver a bleaching agent to the teeth; US patent no. 5,438,076 to Friedman et al., in which liquid methacrylate acid copolymer compositions are used to deliver a bacteriocidal pharmacological agent; and International Patent Appln. No. PCT/CN97/00 to Huang, published on July 24, 1997, disclosing a film-coating composition comprising cellulose and polyvinyl acetal, coumarone-indene resin, or shellac as a film former to deliver bleaches to the tooth enamel.<br>
However, the above systems are water-soluble, i.e., they are readily dissolved by saliva, generally within about 1-3 hours after application. Therefore, their degree of durability is low, and they cannot provide long-term delivery of the active ingredient that is present in the composition. In addition, their water-soluble nature precludes them from being used with oral care actives that would be unstable in water-based films. Sodium percarbonate is one example of such an active; it would be unstable in the high pH environment of an aqueous-based film.<br>
In order to provide an applied composition with a relatively higher degree of durability, the use of protective coatings that are applied to the teeth has been described. See, US patent no. 5,401,528, to Schmidt on March 18, 1995, in which organically modified silicic acid polycondensates are deposited on the teeth, then polymerized in-situ by curing, to coat the teeth in order to protect them from plaque deposits. This system is not a true delivery system by which an active ingredient is released over time; instead, it provides a barrier by which the deleterious effect of plaque-causing bacteria may be diminished.<br>
Although such a barrier coating may offer a benefit in terms of enhanced durability, it requires the use of special equipment and complex application; thus, it cannot be performed at home and cannot be used for self-treatment.<br>
Therefore, it can be seen that none of these previous developments can offer the combination of both long-term delivery of an oral care.substance or active ingredient and the convenience of discrete self-treatment and home use. Based on the foregoing, there is a need for a convenient delivery system for<br><br>
various oral care substances in which the substantivity of the active ingredients is enhanced. None of the existing art provides all of the advantages and benefits of the present invention.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention is directed to compositions for delivering an oral care substance to the oral cavity, comprising: (a) an organosiloxane resin; (b) a volatile carrier capable of solubilizing the organosiloxane resin; (c) a rheology modifier; and (d) at least one oral care substance. The present invention is also directed to such compositions comprising (a) an organosiloxane resin, (b) a fluid diorganopolysiloxane-based polymer (c) a volatile carrier capable of solubilizing the organosiloxane resin and the fluid diorganopolysiloxane-based polymer; (d) a rheology modifier; and (e) at least one oral care substance. The present invention further is directed to a method of using these compositions.<br>
These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the invention will become evident to those skilled in the art from a reading of the present disclosure.<br>

monovalent radicals containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, radicals containing a<br>
polyalkylene oxide group, and mixtures thereof; preferably R is selected from the<br>
group consisting of methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, amyl,<br>
hexyl, vinyl, allyl, cyclohexyl, amino alkyl, phenyl, fluoroalkyl, and mixtures<br>
thereof, preferably at a level wherein the ratio of organosiloxane resin to fluid<br>
diorganopolysiloxane- based polymer is from 10:1 to 1:10<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
While the specification concludes with claims particularly pointing out and<br>
distinctly claiming the invention, it is believed that the present invention will be better understood from the following description.<br>
All percentages and ratios used hereinafter are by weight of total composition, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
All measurements referred to herein are made at 25°C unless otherwise specified.<br>
All percentages, ratios, and levels of ingredients referred to herein are based on the actual amount of the ingredient, and do not include solvents, fillers, or other materials with which the ingredient may be combined as a commercially available product, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
All publications, patent applications, and issued patents mentioned herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference. Citation of any reference is not an admission regarding any determination as to its availability as prior art to the claimed invention.<br><br>
Herein, "comprising" means that other steps and other components which do not affect the end result can be added.   This term encompasses the terms "consisting of and "consisting essentially of." Organosiloxane Resins<br>
Silicone resins are highly crosslinked polymeric siloxane systems.   The crosslinking is introduced through the incorporation of tri-functional and tetra-functional silanes with mono-functional or di-functional, or both, silanes during manufacture of the silicone resin. As is well understood in the art, the degree of crosslinking that is required in order to result in a silicone resin will vary according to the specific silane units incorporated into the silicone resin.    In general, silicone materials which have a sufficient level of trifunctional and tetrafunctional  siloxane  monomer  units,   and   hence,   a   sufficient  level   of crosslinking, such that they dry down to a rigid, or hard, film are considered to be silicone resins.   The ratio of oxygen atoms to silicon atoms is indicative of the level of crosslinking in a particular silicone material.   Silicone materials which have at least about 1.1 oxygen atoms per silicon atom will generally be silicone resins herein.    Preferably, the ratio of oxygenisilicon atoms is at least about 1.2:1.0.<br>
Silicone materials and silicone resins in particular can conveniently be identified according to a shorthand nomenclature system well known to those skilled in the art as the "MDTQ" nomenclature. Under this system, the sificone is described according to the presence of various siloxane monomer units which make up the silicone. Briefly, the symbol M denotes the mono-functional unit (CH3)3SiO) 5; D denotes the difunctional unit (CH3)2SiO; T denotes the<br>
trifunctional unit (CH3)SiO1.5; and Q denotes the quadra- or tetra-functional unit SiO2- Note that a small amount, up to about 5% of silanol or alkoxy functionality may also be present in the resin structure as a result of processing.<br>
Primes of the unit'symbols, e.g., M', D', T, and Qf, denote substituents"~ other than methyl, and must be specifically defined for each occurrence. Typical alternate substituents include groups such as vinyl, phenyl, amino, hydroxyl, etc. The molar ratios of the various units, either in terms of subscripts to the symbols<br><br>
indicating the total number of each type of unit in the silicone, or an average thereof, or as specifically indicated ratios in combination with molecular weight, complete the description of the silicone material under the MDTQ system. Higher relative molar amounts of T, Q, T' and/or Q' to D, D', M and/or M1 in a silicone resin is indicative of higher levels of crosslinking. As discussed before, however, the overall level of crosslinking can also be indicated by the oxygen to silicon ratio.<br>
The organosiloxane resins are solid at about 25°C and the average molecular weight of the resins is from about 1,000 to about 10,000. The resins are soluble in organic solvents such as toluene, xylene, isoparaffins, and cyclosiloxanes or the volatile carrier described below, indicating that the resin is not sufficiently crosslinked such that the resin is insoluble in the volatile carrier.<br>
The silicone resins preferred for use herein are MQ, MT, MTQ, and MDTQ resins; such MQ resins are disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,330,747, Krzysik, issued July 19, 1994. Thus, the preferred silicone substituent is methyl. Especially preferred are MQ resins wherein the M:Q ratio is from about 0.5:1.0 to about 1.5:1.0. Organosiloxane resins such as these are commercially available, for example, Wacker 803 and 804 available from Wacker Silicones Corporation of Adrian, Michigan, US, and G.E: 1170-002 (SR 1000) from the General Electric Company.<br>
The level of the resin that is used in the compositions is dependent on its degree of solubility in the formulation, particularly in the solvents used. Generally, the range of resin used in the present invention is from about 5% to about 70%, preferably from about 15% to about 45%, and even more preferably from about 20% to about 40%. Fluid Piorqanopolysiloxane-based Polymers<br>
In addition to the organosiloxane resins disclosed above, the compositions of the present invention may further comprise a fluid diorganopolysiloxane-based polymer to be combined with the organosiloxane resins. Said fluid diorganopolysiloxane-based polymers useful in the present invention span a large range of viscosities; from about 10 to about 10,000,000 centistokes (cSt) at<br><br>
25 °C. Some diorganopolysiloxane polymers useful in this invention exhibit viscosities greater than 10,000,000 centistokes (cSt) at 25 °C and therefore are characterized by manufacturer specific penetration testing. Examples of this characterization are GE silicone materials SE 30 and SE 63 with penetration specifications of 500-1500 and 250-600 (tenths of a millimeter), respectively.<br>
Among the fluid diorganopolysiloxane-based polymers of the present invention are diorganopolysiloxane polymers comprising repeating units, where said units correspond to the formula (R2SiO)n, where R is a monovalent radical<br>
containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably selected from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, amyl, hexyl, vinyl, allyl, cyclohexyl, amino alkyl, phenyl, fluoroalkyl and mixtures thereof. The fluid diorganopoylsiloxane polymers employed in the present invention may contain one or more of these radicals as substituents on the siloxane polymer backbone. The fluid diorganopolysiloxane polymers may be terminated by<br>
triorganosilyl groups of the formula (R'3Si)'where R' is a monovalent radical<br>
selected from the group consisting of radicals containing from 1-6 carbon atoms, hydroxyl groups, alkoxyl groups and mixtures thereof. The fluid diorganopolysiloxane poiymer must be compatible in solution with the organosiloxane resin and the volatile carrier. The term "compatible" refers to the formation of a single phase solution when the fluid diorganopolysiloxane polymer, the organosiloxane resin and the volatile carrier are mixed together in ratios required for a specific formulation. For example, the lower viscosity fluid diorganopolysiloxane polymers (viscosity of about 10 to 100cSt.) are particularly useful when using ethanol as the principal volatile carrier. For higher viscosity polymers, e.g., poly(dimethylsiloxane), herein referred to as PDMS or silicone gum, having a viscosity of at least 100,000 cSt, volatile' carriers other than ethanol are preferred.<br>
Silicone gum corresponds to the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where R is a methyl group.<br>
Fluid diorganopolysiloxane polymers such as these are commercially available, for example, SE 30 silicone gum and SF96 silicone fluid available from the General Electric Company. Similar materials can also be obtained from Dow Corning and from Wacker Siiicones.<br>
Another fluid diorganosiloxane-based polymer preferred for use in the present invention is a dimethicone copoiyol to modify film forming characteristics as desired. The dimethicone copoiyol can be further characterized as polyalkylene oxide modified polydimethysiloxanes, such as manufactured by the Witco Corporation under the trade name Silwet. Similar materials can be obtained from Dow Corning, Wacker Siiicones and Goldschmidt Chemical Corporation as well as other silicone manufacturers.<br>
In   preferred   embodiments   of   the   present   invention,   the   ratio   of organosiloxane resin to fluid diorganopolysiioxane-based polymer is preferably from about 10:1 to about 1:10, more preferably from about 2:1 to about 8:1, and still more preferably from about 4:1 to 6:1. Volatile Carriers<br>
In the present invention, the organosiloxane resin and the fluid diorganosiloxane-based polymer above must be easily transferred to the oral cavity surfaces, such as to the tooth enamel. To achieve delivery, it is necessary that the resin or the resin/polymer combination above be incorporated into a carrier, specifically a volatile carrier which must quickly volatilize from the oral cavity surfaces, leaving a film on the application surfaces. The volatile carrier must solubilize the organosiloxane resin and if present in the composition, the fluid diorganosiloxane-based polymer.<br>
The volatile carrier comprises from about 10% to about 90%, preferably<br>
*		<br>
from about 15% to about 80%, and more preferably from about 20% to about 70% of the composition.  The volatile carrier of the present invention is selected<br><br>
from the group consisting of hydrocarbon oils, volatile silicones, non-hydrocarbon solvents, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Hydrocarbon oils useful in the present invention include those having boiling points in the range of 60-260 °C, more preferably hydrocarbon oils having from about C8 to about C20 chain lengths, most preferably C8 to C20 isoparaffins. Of these isoparaffms most preferred are selected from the group consisting of isododecane, isohexadecane, isoeocosane, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane, 2,3-dimethylhexane and mixtures thereof. Most preferred is isododecane, available as, for example, Permethyl 99A from Permethyl Corporation corresponding to the formula:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Preferred volatile silicone fluids include cyclomethicones having 3, 4 and 5<br>
membered ring structures corresponding to the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where X is from about 3 to about 6. Such volatile silicones include 244 Fluid, 344 Fluid and 245 Fluid, and 345 Fluid all from Dow Corning Corporation.<br>
The general classes of non-hydrocarbon solvents useful herein include esters, ketones, alcohols, fluorocarbons and fluorocarbon ethers having boiling points in the range of 60 to 200 °C. Non-hydrocarbon solvents or mixtures thereof particularly useful include those that are capable of solubilizing the resin and/or the diorganopolysiloxane-based polymer. Such solvents include but are not limited to ethanol, acetone, butanone, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, amyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, methyl nonafluoroisobutyl ether, methyl nonafluorobutyl ether, and mixtures thereof. These non-hydrocarbon solvents are readily available such as ethyl acetate and methyl ethyl ketone, both supplied by J. T. Baker of Phillispburg, N J, and HFE (a mixture of methyl nonafluoroisobutyl ether and methyl nonafluorobutyl ether), supplied by the 3M Company. Rheology Modifiers<br><br>
The compositions further comprise a rheology modifier which inhibits settling and separation of components or controls settling in a manner which facilitates re-dispersion and may control Theological flow properties. Suitable rheology modifiers herein include organo modified clays, silicas, polyethylene, and mixtures thereof. The preferred organophilic clays comprise quatemium-18 hectorite or Stearalkonium hectorite, such as Bentone 27 and 38™ from Rheox, organoclay dispersion such as Bentone ISO gel™; or bentonite organo modified clays such as Bentone 34 ™ from Rheox or the Claytone Series ™ from Southern Clay Products; and mixtures thereof. The preferred silicas may be fumed silica such as the Aerosil™ series from Degussa or the Cab-o-sil™ series from Cabot Corporation, silica gels such as the Sylodent ™ or Sylox ™ series from W. R. Grace &amp; Co. or precipitated silica such as Zeothix 265 from J. M. Huber Corporation.<br>
The rheology modifier is preferably present in the composition at a level of from about 0.1% to about 30%, preferably from about 0.5% to about 10%, and even more preferably about 1% to about 3% of the composition. Oral Care Substances<br>
The oral care substance preferably contains an active at a level where upon directed use, the benefit sought by the wearer is promoted without detriment to the oral surface to which it is applied. Examples of the oral conditions these actives address include, but, are not limited to, appearance and structural changes to teeth, whitening, stain bleaching, stain removal, plaque removal, tartar removal, cavity prevention and treatment, inflamed and/or bleeding gums, mucosal wounds, lesions, ulcers, aphthous ulcers, cold sores, tooth abscesses, and the elimination of mouth malodor resulting from the conditions above and other causes such as microbial proliferation.<br>
Suitable oral care substances include any material that is generally considered safe for use in the oral cavity and that provides changes to the overall appearance and/or health of the oral cavity. The level of oral care substance in the compositions of the present invention is generally, unless specifically noted, from about 0.01% to about 50%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 20%, more<br><br>
preferably from about 0.5% to about 10%, and even more preferably from about 1% to about 7%, by weight of the composition.<br>

9.	H-2 Antagonists<br>
Histamine-2 (H-2 or H2) receptor antagonist compounds (H-2 antagonists) may be used in the oral care composition of the present invention. As used herein, selective H-2 antagonists are compounds that block H-2 receptors, but do not have meaningful activity in blocking histamine-1 (H-1 or H1) receptors. Selective H-2 antagonists stimulates the contraction of smooth muscle from various organs, such as the gut and bronchi; this effect can be suppressed by low concentrations of mepyramine - a typical antihistaminic drug. The<br><br>
pharmacological receptors involved in these mepyramine-sensitive histamine responses have been defined as H-1 receptors (Ash, A.S.F. &amp; H.O. Schild, Brit. J. Pharmacol Chemother., Vol. 27 (1966), p. 427. Histamine also stimulates the secretion of acid by the stomach (Loew, E.R. &amp; O. Chickering, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., Vol. 48 (1941), p. 65), increases the heart rate (Trendelenburg, U., J. Pharmacol., Vol. 130 (1960), p. 450), and inhibits contractions in the rat uterus (Dews, P.B. &amp; J.D.P. Graham, Brit. J. Pharmaco!. Chemother., Vol. 1 (1946), p. 278); these actions cannot be antagonized by mepyramine and related drugs. The H-2 antagonists useful in the oral care compositions or substances are those that blockade the receptors involved in mepyramine-insensitive, non-H-1 (H-2), histamine responses, and do not blockade the receptors involved in mepyramine-sensitive histamine responses.<br>
Selective  H-2   antagonists   are  those   compounds  found  to  be  H-2 antagonists through their performance in classical preclinical screening tests for H-2 antagonist function.  Selective H-2 antagonists are identified as compounds which can  be demonstrated to function as  competitive or non-competitive inhibitors of histamine-mediated effects in those screening models specifically dependent  upon  H-2   receptor  function,   but  to  lack  significant  histamine antagonist activity in those screening models dependent upon H-1  receptor function.    Specifically, this includes compounds that would be classified as described by Black, J.W., W.A.M. Duncan, C.J. Durant, C.R. Ganellin &amp; E.M. Parsons, "Definition and Antagonism of Histamine H2-Receptors", Nature, Vol. 236 (April 21, 1972), pp. 385-390 (Black), as H-2 antagonists if assessed as described by Black through testing with the guinea pig spontaneously beating right atria in vitro assay and the rat gastric acid secretion in vivo assay, but shown to lack in significant H-1 antagonist activity relative to H-2 antagonist activity, if assessed as described by Black with either the guinea pig ileum -contraction in vitro assay or the rat stomach muscle contraction in vivo assay.._. Preferably selective H-2 antagonists demonstrate no significant H-1 activity at reasonable dosage levels in the above H-1 assays. Typical reasonable dosage<br><br>
level is the lowest dosage level at which 90% inhibition of histamine, preferably 99% inhibition of histamine, is achieved in the above H-2 assays.<br>
Selective H-2 antagonists include compounds meeting the above criteria<br>
which are disclosed in U.S. Patents 5,294,433 and 5,364,616 Singer et al.,<br>
issued 3/15/94 and 11/15/94 respectively and assigned to Procter &amp; Gamble,<br>

Method of Preparation<br>
The compositions of Tables 1 and 2 are non-aqueous. The oral care substances are dispersed or dissolved in a solution comprising the organosiloxane resin, the fluid diorganopolysiloxane polymer, the volatile carrier, and the rheology modifier.<br>
The hydrophobic compositions of Tables 1 and 2 are suitably prepared as follows. Three hundred (300) grams of organosiloxane resin solution (for example, 43.7% MQ resin solution in isododecane or in a 50/50 mixture of ethyl acetate and butanone or in a mixture of ethyl acetate, propyl acetate and HFE) are mixed with 147.30 grams of fluid diorganopolysiloxane polymer solution (for example, 50% SE30 silicone gum solution in isododecane or a 50/50 mixture of ethyl acetate and butanone or a mixture of ethyl acetate, propyl acetate and HFE). The oral care substances are then dispersed in the resin/gum mixture. This method may be carried out without the presence of the silicone gum.<br>
All oral care substances described herein can formulated as described above. ..<br>

Method of Preparation<br>
The compositions of Tables 3-6 are suitably prepared as follows. Add the solvents into a container suitable to minimize solvent loss.   Add the rheology<br><br>
modifiers and mix until well dispersed. Add the silicone resin and mix until completely dissolved. Add the silicone gum and/or silicone fluids and mix until completely dissolved. At this time add any salts such as sodium percarbonate and/or other oral care actives, aesthetic ingredients such as opacifiers, sweeteners, dyes, and flavors. Continue mixing until homogeneous. Additional high shear mixing may be used to promote the mixing. Pack into airtight containers.<br>
Alternatively premixes of the silicone resin and/or the silicone gum may be prepared prior to incorporation into the final blending step to facilitate silicone dissolution and ease of manufacturing. Depending on the formula composition, the order of ingredient addition may also vary such as the addition of the rheology modifier(s) may be moved to a later step allowing lower viscosity to be maintained until the later stages of the blending step.<br>
The embodiments disclosed and represented by the examples of the previous Tables have many advantages. For example, they provide better durability and subsequent delivery of oral care substances, particularly to the surfaces of the teeth. They also provide a convenient, discrete, and easy to use product form which can deliver benefits that are significantly different from those that can be achieved by conventional product forms. In addition, oral care actives that would exhibit instability in an aqueous-based film system can be incorporated into the compositions herein without compromising stability. __ Method of Use<br>
In practicing the present invention, the user need only apply a composition herein that contains the oral care substance or substances necessary in order to obtain a desired effect, e.g., whitening, breath freshening, caries prevention, pain relief, gum health, tartar control, etc. to the tooth surfaces in the areas desired. The compositions may also be applied to other surfaces of the oral cavity, such as the gingival or mucosal tissues, or to any other oral cavity surface. The composition can be applied with a brush, a pen applicator, a doe's foot applicator, or the like, or even with the fingers.<br><br>
A film containing the oral care substance quickly forms on the surface to which the composition has been applied. Prolonged delivery of the oral care substance is made possible as the oral care substance is released from the film over time. Then, any residual oral care substance may be easily removed by wiping, brushing or rinsing the oral surface after a desired period of time has elapsed, or in the normal course of tooth brushing or other oral care activities. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the film will last from about 2 hours to 8 hours regardless of the reactivity of the oral care substance. Preferably, the compositions are almost unnoticeable when applied to the oral cavity.<br>
It is not necessary to prepare the oral cavity before applying the composition of the present invention. For example, the user may or may not choose to brush the teeth or rinse the mouth before applying the composition. The surfaces of the oral cavity are neither required to be dried nor to be excessively wet with saliva or water before the composition is applied. However, it is believed that adhesion to the tooth enamel surfaces will be improved if the teeth are dry when the composition is applied.<br>
It should be understood that the present invention relates not only to methods for delivering an oral care substance to the oral cavity of a human, but also to methods of delivering an oral care substance to the oral cavity of an animal, e.g., household pets or other domestic animals, or animals kept in captivity.<br>
It is understood that the examples and embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to one skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br><br><br><br>
