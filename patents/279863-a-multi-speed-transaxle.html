CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 61/046,533, filed on April 21, 2008, which is hereby incorporated<br>
in its entirety herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The invention relates generally to a multiple speed transmission<br>
having a plurality of planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting<br>
devices and more particularly to a transmission configured for a front wheel drive<br>
vehicle having eight or more speeds, four planetary gear sets and a plurality of<br>
torque transmitting devices.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004] A typical multiple speed transmission uses a combination of a<br>
plurality of torque transmitting mechanisms, planetary gear arrangements and<br>
fixed interconnections to achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and<br>
physical arrangement of the planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by<br>
packaging, cost and desired speed ratios.<br>
 <br>
[0005] While current transmissions achieve their intended purpose, the<br>
need for new and improved transmission configurations which exhibit improved<br>
performance, especially from the standpoints of efficiency, responsiveness and<br>
smoothness and improved packaging, primarily reduced size and weight, is<br>
essentially constant. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved, cost-effective,<br>
compact multiple speed transmission.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] A transaxle is provided having a transmission input member, a<br>
transmission output member, a plurality of planetary gear sets, and a plurality of<br>
torque-transmitting mechanisms. The plurality of planetary gear sets each have<br>
a sun gear member, a planetary carrier member, and a ring gear member.<br>
[0007] In one aspect of the present invention, the housing of the<br>
transaxle has a first wall, a second wall, and a third wall extending between the<br>
first and second walls. The first, second, third and fourth planetary gear sets are<br>
disposed within the housing. The second planetary gear set is adjacent the first<br>
wall, the first planetary gear set is adjacent second wall, the third planetary gear<br>
set is adjacent the second planetary gear set and the fourth planetary gear set is<br>
between the second and fourth planetary gear sets.<br>
[0008] Moreover, the ring gear member of the first planetary gear set is<br>
permanently coupled to the sun gear member of the fourth planetary gear set.<br>
The sun gear member of the first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to<br>
the sun gear member of the second planetary gear set. The planet carrier<br>
member of the second planetary gear set is permanently coupled to the ring gear<br>
 <br>
member of the third planetary gear set. The planet carrier member of the third<br>
planetary gear set is permanently coupled to the planet carrier member of the<br>
fourth planetary gear set. The transmission output member is permanently<br>
coupled with the carrier members of the third and fourth planetary gear sets. The<br>
transmission input member is permanently coupled with the carrier member of<br>
the first planetary gear set.<br>
[0009] Further, the housing has a first area defined radially inward from<br>
an outer periphery of the planetary gear sets and axiallybounded by the first wall<br>
and the second planetary gear set,a second area defined radially inward from<br>
the outer periphery of the planetary gear sets and axially bounded by the second<br>
and third planetary gear sets, a third area defined radially inward from the outer<br>
periphery of the planetary gear sets and axially bounded by the third and fourth<br>
planetary gear sets, a fourth area defined radially inward from the outer periphery<br>
of the planetary gear sets and axially bounded by the first and fourth planetary<br>
gear set, a fifth area defined radially inward from the outer periphery of the<br>
planetary gear sets and axially bounded by the first planetary gear set and the<br>
second wall, and a sixth area defined radially inward from the third wall and<br>
radially outward from the outer periphery of the planetary gear sets and axially<br>
bounded by the first wall and the second wall.<br>
[0010] In another aspect of the present invention, a first clutch is<br>
disposed in at least one of the second, third, fourth and sixth areas. A second<br>
clutch is disposed in at least one of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth areas. A third<br>
clutch is disposed in at least one of the second, third, fourth and sixth areas. A<br>
 <br>
first brake is disposed in at least one of the first, second, third and sixth areas. A<br>
second brake is disposed in at least one of the first, second, third and sixth<br>
areas. The clutches and the brakes are selectively engageable to establish at<br>
least eight forward speed ratios and at least one reverse speed ratio between the<br>
transmission input member and the transmission output member.<br>
[0011] In yet another aspect of the present invention, a transfer gear<br>
train is provided having a first and second transfer gear. The first transfer gear is<br>
rotatably fixed to the transmission output member and the second transfer gear is<br>
rotatably fixed to an intermediate shaft. A differential gear set is provided for<br>
driving a pair of road wheels. A pinion gear is rotatably fixed to the intermediate<br>

member 54. Each of the pinion gears 22D are configured to intermesh with both<br>
the sun gear member 22C and the ring gear member 22A.<br>
[0024] The planetary gear set 24 includes a ring gear member 24A, a<br>
planet carrier member 24B that rotatably supports a set of planet or pinion gears<br>
24D and a sun gear member 24C. The ring gear member 24A is connected for<br>
common rotation with the sixth shaft or intermediate member 52. The planet<br>
carrier member 24B is connected for common rotation with the output shaft or<br>
member 16. The sun gear member 24C is connected for common rotation with<br>

member 24A.<br>
 <br>
[0025] The planetary gear set 26 includes a ring gear member 26A, a<br>
carrier member 26B that rotatably supports a set of planet or pinion gears 26D<br>
and a sun gear member 26C. The ring gear member 26A is connected for<br>

[0026] The transmission 10 also includes a plurality of torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms or devices including a first clutch 66, a second clutch<br>
68, a third clutch 70, a first brake 72 and a second brake 74. The first clutch 66<br>
is selectively engagable to connect the third shaft or intermediate member 46 to<br>
the eighth shaft or intermediate member 56. The second clutch 68 is selectively<br>

through a tenth shaft or member 60 to restrict rotation of the member 54 relative<br>
to the transmission housing 12. Finally, the second brake 74 is selectively<br>
engagable to connect the fifth shaft or intermediate member 50 to the<br>
 <br>
transmission housing 12 through an eleventh shaft or member 62 to restrict<br>
rotation of the member 50 relative to the transmission housing 12.<br>
[0027] The transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the<br>
input shaft or member 14 to the output shaft or member 16 in at least eight<br>
forward torque ratios and one reverse torque ratio. Each of the forward torque<br>
ratios and the reverse torque ratio are attained by engagement of one or more of<br>
the torque-transmitting mechanisms (i.e. first clutch 66, second clutch 68, third<br>
clutch 70, first brake 72 and second brake 74). Those skilled in the art will<br>
readily understand that a different speed ratio is associated with each torque<br>
ratio. Thus, eight forward speed ratios may be attained by the transmission 10.<br>
[0028] The transmission housing 12 includes a first wall or structural<br>
member 102, a second wall or structural member 104 and a third wall or<br>
structural member 106. The third wall 106 interconnects first wall 102 and the<br>
second 104 to define a space or cavity 110. Input and output shafts or members<br>
14, 16 are supported by the second wall 104 by bearings 112 and bearings 114,<br>
respectively. The planetary gear sets 20, 22, 24 and 26 and the torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms 66, 68, 70, 72 and 74 are disposed within cavity 110.<br>
Further, the cavity 110 has a plurality of areas or zones A, B, C, D, E, and F in<br>
which the plurality of torque transmitting mechanisms 66, 68, 70, 72 and 74 will<br>
be specifically positioned or mounted, in accordance with the preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention.<br>
[0029] As shown in FIG. 1A, zone A is defined by the area or space<br>
bounded by: the first wall 102, planetary gear set 22, radially inward by a<br>
 <br>
reference line "L" which is a longitudinal line that is axially aligned with the input<br>
shaft 14, and radially outward by a reference line "M" which is a longitudinal line<br>
that extends adjacent an outer diameter or outer periphery of the planetary gear<br>
sets 20, 22, 24 and 26. While reference line "M" is illustrated as a straight line<br>
throughout the several views, it should be appreciated that reference line "M"<br>
follows the outer periphery of the planetary gear sets 20, 22, 24 and 26, and<br>
accordingly may be steppeed or non-linear depending on the location of the outer<br>
periphery of each of the planetary gear sets 20, 22, 24 and 26. Zonle' B is<br>
defined by the area bounded by: planetary gear set 22, the planetary gear set 24,<br>
radially outward by reference line "M", and radially inward by reference line "L".<br>
Zone C is defined by the area bounded by: the planetary gear set 24, the<br>
planetary gear set 26, radially outward by reference line "M", and radially inward<br>
by reference line "L". Zone D is defined by the area bounded by: the planetary<br>
gear set 20, the planetary gear set 26, radially outward by reference line "M", and<br>
radially inward by reference line "L". Zone E is defined by the area bounded by:<br>
the planetary gear set 20, the second wall 104, radially outward by reference line<br>
"M", and radially inward by reference line "L". Zone F is defined by the area<br>
bounded by: the first wall 102 and the second wall 104, radially inward by<br>
reference line "M" and radially outward by the third wall 106.<br>
[0030] In the gear arrangement 18 of transmission 10 shown in FIG.<br>
1A, the planetary gear set 22 is disposed closest to the first wall 102, the<br>
planetary gear set 20 is disposed closest to the second wall 104, the planetary<br>
gear set 24 is disposed adjacent the planetary gear set 22, and the planetary<br>
 <br>
gear set 26 is disposed between the planetary gear sets 20 and 24. The torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms are intentionally located within specific Zones in order<br>
to provide advantages in overall transmission size, packaging efficiency, and<br>
reduced manufacturing complexity. In the particular example shown in FIG. 1A,<br>
the first clutch 66 and second clutch 68 are disposed within Zone D, the third<br>
clutch 70 is disposed within Zone C and the first and second brakes 72 and 74<br>
are disposed within Zone A.<br>
[0031] However, the present invention contemplates other<br>
embodiments where the torque-transmitting mechanisms 66, 68, 70, 72 and 74<br>
are disposed in the other Zones. The feasible locations of the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms 66, 68, 70, 72 and 74 within the Zones are illustrated in the chart<br>
shown in FIG. 1B. The chart of Fig. 1B lists clutches and brakes in the left most<br>
column and the available zones to locate the clutch/brake in the top row. An "X"<br>
in the chart indicates that the present invention contemplates locating the clutch<br>
or brake in the zone listed in the top row. For example, first brake 72 and second<br>
brake 74 may be located in zones A, B, C or F.<br>
[0032] Referring now to FIG. 2, a front wheel drive powertrain 150<br>
incorporating a transaxle 153 is illustrated, in accordance with the embodiments<br>
of the present invention. Transaxle 153 includes the transmission 10 having the<br>
gear arrangement 18 of FIGS. 1A and 1B. Transmission 10 is mounted to an<br>
engine 152. Engine 152 provides a driving torque through input shaft 14 to<br>
transmission 10. Engine 152 is generally an internal combustion engine,<br>
however, the present invention contemplates other types of engines such as<br>
 <br>
electric and hybrid engines. Further, transaxle 153 includes a transfer gear train<br>
154, a differential 156, and a pair of drive axles 158 and 160 that drive a pair of<br>
road wheels 162 and 164, respectively.<br>
[0033] Transfer gear train 154 includes a first transfer gear 166 and a<br>
second transfer gear 168. Output shaft or member 16 is coupled to a first<br>
transfer or spur gear 166. First transfer gear 166 may be a straight spur gear<br>
having straight gear teeth or a helical gear having helical gear teeth. First<br>
transfer gear 166 meshes with the second transfer gear 168. Second transfer<br>
gear 168 is rotatably fixed to an intermediate shaft or rotatable member 170.<br>
Further, a ponion 172 is mounted to shaft 170 and intermesh with an input<br>
differential gear 174. input differential gear 174 is Fixed to of integrally formed<br>
with the housing of the idifferential 156. Input differential gear 174 transfers<br>
driving torque to the differeritial 156. Differential 156, as conventionally known,<br>
transfers the driving torque generated by engine 152 to the two drive axles 158<br>
and 160. Drive axles 158 and 160 are independently driven by differential 156 to<br>
supply the driving torque to the vehicle road wheels 162 and 164.<br>
[0034] Referring now to FIG. 3, another embodiment of a front wheel<br>
drive powertrain 200 incorporating a transaxle 202 is illustrated, in accordance<br>
with the embodiments of the present invention. Transaxle 202 includes the gear<br>
arrangement 18 of transmission 10 of FIGS. 1A and 1B and is mounted to the<br>
engine 152. Engine 152 provides a driving torque through input shaft 14 to<br>
transmission gear arrangement 18. Further, transaxle 202 includes a transfer<br>
chain 204, a driven sprocket or gear 206, a differential 208, a final drive planetary<br>
 <br>
gear set 210 and a pair of drive axles 158 and 160 that drive a pair of road<br>
wheels 162 and 164, respectively.<br>
[0035] Transfer chain 204 engages, at a first end 212, a drive sprocket<br>
or transfer gear 214 and at a second end 216 the driven sprocket or transfer gear<br>
206. The drive sprocket 214 is coupled to output shaft or member 16. Driven<br>
sprocket 206 is rotatably fixed to a final drive member or rotatable shaft 220. In<br>
an embodiment of the present invention, shaft 220 is a sleeve shaft through<br>
which drive axle 158 passes. Further, shaft 220 is coupled to the sun gear of<br>
final drive planetary gear set 210 to achieve the desired gear ratio. A carrier<br>
member of the final drive planetary gear set 210 supports a plurality of pinion<br>
gears which mesh with both the sun gear and a ring gear of final drive planetary<br>
gear set. The carrier member of final drive planetary gear set 210 is rotatably<br>
coupled to and transfers driving torque to a housing of the differential 208.<br>
Differential 208 transfers the driving torque generated by engine 152 to the two<br>
drive axles 158 and 160 through two sets of bevel gears rotationally supported in<br>
the differential housing. Drive axles 158 and 160 are independently driven by<br>
differential 208 to supply the driving torque to the vehicle road wheels 162 and<br>
164.<br>
[0036] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
