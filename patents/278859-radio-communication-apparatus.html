DESCRIPTION<br>
Title of the Invention<br>
RADIO COMMUNICATION APPARATUS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a radio<br>
communication apparatus for radio communications of<br>
signals modulated in MB-OFDM (Multi Band-Orthogonal<br>
Frequency Division Multiplexing) scheme.<br>
Background Art<br>
UWB (Ultra Wide Band) is a radio communication<br>
scheme where a wide frequency band in bandwidth of 7.5<br>
GHz ranging from 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz is used. A<br>
specification for physical layers in the UWB is<br>
standardized in IEEE 802.15.3a by IEEE (The Institute of<br>
Electrical and Electronic Engineers) working for<br>
defining standard specifications.<br>
In the physical layer in the UWB, two<br>
modulation schemes MB-OFDM (Multi Band-Orthogonal<br>
Frequency Division Multiplexing) and DS-UWB (Direct<br>
Spread-UWB) are employed.<br>
In the MB-OFDM, the whole band ranging from<br>
3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz is divided into 14 bands (frequency<br>
 <br>
bands). For each of the divided bands, QPSK (Quadrature<br>
Phase Shift Keying) is conducted in primary modulation<br>
for carrying digital signals in radio waves, and OFDM<br>
(Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) is<br>
conducted in secondary modulation for achieving<br>
communications tolerant to interference from other radio<br>
waves.<br>
In the DS-UWB, a lower band from 3.1 GHz to<br>
4.9 GHz and a higher band from 6.2 GHz to 9.7 GHz are<br>
used. For signal transmission, the QPSK or BPSK (Binary<br>
Phase Shift Keying) is conducted in the primary<br>
modulation and CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) is<br>
conducted in the secondary modulation. Also, a direct<br>
frequency spread scheme is used in the DS-UWB in the<br>
transmission of signals.<br>
In the UWB, these modulation schemes are used<br>
to reduce transmission power levels. Specifically, the<br>
FCC (Federal Communications Commission) specifies that<br>
EIRP (Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power)<br>
indicative of regulated transmission power level per 1<br>
MHz in the UWB be less than or equal to -41.25 dBm.<br>
This level corresponds to about 0.5 mW of total power,<br>
which may be about 1/20 of total power of the PHS<br>
(Personal Handy-Phone System).<br>
In the MB-OFDM, each of the 14 bands is<br>
 <br>
assigned to a band group including two or three bands.<br>
Bands 1-3 are assigned to band group 1, bands 4-6 are<br>
assigned to band group 2, bands 7-9 are assigned to band<br>
group 3, bands 10-12 are assigned to band group 4, and<br>
bands 13-14 are assigned to band group 5.<br>
Also, in the MB-OFDM, frequency hopping is<br>
used. The frequency hopping is a technique for<br>
communications through continuous transition of a<br>
communicating band to other bands as illustrated in FIG.<br>
12.<br>
Even in cases where an error occurs in<br>
communicated data due to noise having occurred in a<br>
certain frequency, the continuous transition between<br>
communicating bands could correct the error-occurring<br>
data by using data communicated in other bands.<br>
In the MB-OFDM, patterns for frequency hopping<br>
are defined as TFC (Time Frequency Code) as illustrated<br>
in FIG. 13. In FIG. 13, TFC 1 is illustrated to have<br>
the frequency hopping pattern "BAND 1 → BAND 2 → BAND 3<br>
→ BAND 1 → BAND 2 → BAND 3." Also, TFC 5 is<br>
illustrated to use only BAND 1 without frequency hopping.<br>
If it is not specified in upper layers which<br>
channel is used to transmit what data, the band groups<br>
are defined depending on regions in countries. On the<br>
other hand, TFCs are selected in the sequence specified<br>
 <br>
in the MB-OFDM. In this manner, the band groups and the<br>
TFCs are determined, and accordingly channels are<br>
determined.<br>
In conventional radio communication<br>
apparatuses, AGC (Automatic Gain Control) is conducted<br>
for suppressing fluctuation of the amplitude of a<br>
received electrical signal and converting it into a<br>
signal with a constant amplitude. In AGC, gain<br>
(amplification degree) is increased for a small<br>
amplitude signal based on RSSI (Received Signal Strength<br>
Indicator) while gain is decreased for a large amplitude<br>
signal.<br>
As one implementation of AGC, Japanese Laid-<br>
Open Patent Publication 2002-94408 discloses an<br>
arrangement including a first attenuator provided<br>
between a front-end or a high frequency amplifier and a<br>
mixer, a RSSI circuit for generating a RSSI output<br>
signal from a received signal, and a second attenuator<br>
provided before the RSSI circuit for adjusting an input<br>
signal level. In this arrangement, the RSSI output<br>
signal is compared to two thresholds. If it is outside<br>
of the thresholds, the attenuation amount of the second<br>
attenuator and then the attenuation amount of the first<br>
attenuator are adjusted to substantially enlarge a<br>
dynamic range of input and output in/from the RSSI<br>
 <br>
circuit and prevent saturation of the mixer, the AGC<br>
circuit, and other system circuits in strong electric<br>
fields without sacrificing modulation performance in<br>
weak electric fields.<br>
As another implementation of the AGC, Japanese<br>
Laid-Open Patent Publication 2005-534252 discloses an<br>
arrangement including a RSSI circuit for measuring the<br>
RSSI of a received signal, an analog amplifier for<br>
amplifying the received signal, an analog-to-digital<br>
converter for converting the amplified signal into a<br>
digital signal, a digital AGC loop for determining<br>
digital gain based on the converted digital signal, and<br>
a digital-to-analog converter for setting the digital<br>
gain determined by the digital AGC loop in the analog<br>
amplifier. In a spectral spread system, this<br>
arrangement enables the system to follow a rapid<br>
tracking variation while averaging noise.<br>
As another implementation of the AGC, Japanese<br>
Laid-Open Patent Publication 2006-229739 discloses an<br>
arrangement where gain correction is conducted<br>
corresponding to individual bands prior to AGC whenever<br>
the frequency hopping causes the bands to be switched.<br>
As stated above, the TFC "consists of band<br>
groups each including several bands, and in some TFCs,<br>
the frequency hopping is conducted through transition<br>
 <br>
between the bands.<br>
However, signal strength measurement circuits<br>
for measuring the strength of received signals, such as<br>
the RSSI circuit, may not have uniform measurement<br>
performance over the respective bands. For example,<br>
even if received signals have the same strength, a<br>
strength value for a certain band measured by the signal<br>
strength measurement circuit may be higher than a<br>
strength value for another band measured by the signal<br>
strength measurement circuit.<br>
In conventional radio communication<br>
apparatuses as disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent<br>
Publications 2002-94408 and 2005-534252, AGC operations<br>
in consideration of such measurement errors between<br>
bands in the signal strength measurement circuit are<br>
impossible.<br>
In addition, the band switching period for the<br>
frequency hopping is specified to be relatively short,<br>
such as 312.5 ns, in the MB-OFDM specification. Thus if<br>
the MB-OFDM is applied to a conventional radio<br>
communication apparatus as disclosed in Japanese Laid-<br>
Open Patent Publication 2006-229739, particularly if<br>
analog AGC is conducted in such a conventional radio<br>
communication apparatus, the AGC operation may not be<br>
able to follow the above-stated fast band switching.<br>
 <br>

mentioned conventional problems. One object of the<br>
present invention is provide a radio communication<br>
apparatus for enabling the AGC operation to follow the<br>

register as the coefficients of the function to compute<br>
the gain value.<br>
According to this embodiment, the radio<br>
communication apparatus can be easily implemented by a<br>
radio communication apparatus complying with the WiMedia<br>
MAC-PHY interface specification to write the<br>
coefficients in the register via the MAC unit and<br>
compute the gain value based on the coefficients.<br>
In one embodiment, the MAC unit may be<br>
 <br>
configured to write the coefficients in a range in the<br>
register in the WiMedia MAC-PHY interface specification,<br>

proprietary coefficients.<br>
According to this embodiment, the radio<br>
communication apparatus can be implemented to comply<br>
with the WiMedia MAC-PHY interface specification.<br>
In one embodiment, the radio communication<br>
apparatus may include a table storage unit configured to<br>
store a table including correspondence between the<br>
channels and the coefficients, wherein the MAC unit is<br>
configured to write the coefficients in the register<br>
based on the table in the table storage unit.<br>
According to this embodiment, the radio<br>
communication apparatus can modify coefficients for<br>
different channels without modification of hardware,<br>
firmware and software by changing the table stored in<br>
. the table storage unit.<br>
In one embodiment, the radio communication<br>

on the received signal, wherein the signal strength<br>
measurement circuit is configured to measure signal<br>
strength of the received analog signal, and the<br>
amplifier is configured to amplify the received digital<br>
 <br>
signal converted by the analog-to-digital conversion<br>
unit.<br>
According to this embodiment, the radio<br>

if gain control for a narrow bandwidth is needed to<br>
measure the signal strength of a received analog signal<br>
and amplify the resulting digital signal.<br>
In one embodiment, the signal strength<br>
measurement circuit may be configured to measure signal<br>
strength of the received analog signal, and the<br>
amplifier may be configured to amplify the received<br>
analog signal.<br>
According to this embodiment, the radio<br>
communication apparatus can improve AGC characteristics<br>
if a received fast signal with a higher S/N (Signal to<br>
Noise) ratio is amplified to measure the signal strength<br>
of a received analog signal and amplify the received<br>
analog signal.<br>
In one embodiment, the radio communication<br>
apparatus may include a coefficient determination unit<br>
configured to determine a coefficient suitable for a<br>
frequency band of a channel where the frequency hopping<br>
is not conducted as a coefficient of the channel and<br>

different hopping frequency bands of a channel where the<br>
 <br>
frequency hopping is conducted as a coefficient of the<br>
channel.<br>

According to this embodiment, the radio<br>
communication apparatus can prevent a gain value<br>
unsuitable for a frequency band if a coefficient<br>

Description of Embodiments<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
described with reference to the accompanying drawings in<br>
detail below. FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a<br>
radio communication apparatus according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In this embodiment, a radio communication<br>
apparatus 1 is coupled to a host controller 2 via a PCI<br>
(Peripheral Component Interconnect)-Express bus 3. The<br>
host controller 2 includes a main CPU (Central<br>
Processing Unit) 10 and a memory 11.<br>
The main CPU 10 uses the memory 11 to run an<br>
operating system 12 and to execute a device driver 13 on<br>
the operating system 12.<br>
The device driver 13 communicates data to the<br>
radio communication apparatus 1 via the PCI-Express bus<br>
3 and controls the radio communication apparatus 1 by<br>
reading and writing values from/in a register in a MAC<br>
(Media Access Controller) unit 22 as described below.<br>
The radio communication apparatus 1 includes a<br>
sub CPU 20, a memory 21, the MAC unit 22 for generating<br>
and/or filtering data frames, a PHY (Physical Layer)<br>
unit 23 for signal processing such as frequency<br>
conversion and an antenna 24.<br>
 <br>
The sub CPU 20 uses the memory 21 to run a<br>
real-time operating system 25 and executes firmware 26<br>
for controlling components in the MAC unit 22 on the<br>
real-time operating system 25.<br>
The sub CPU 20 may configure a register (not<br>
illustrated) in the MAC unit 22 and/or communicate data<br>
to the host controller 2 in execution of the firmware 26.<br>
Also, the sub CPU 20 may read and/or write values<br>
from/in a PHY/RF register 41 as described below in the<br>
PHY unit 23 via a WiMedia MAC-PHY interface bus 27 in<br>
execution of the firmware 26.<br>
The MAC unit 22 and the PHY unit 23 may<br>
perform operations based on specifications of WiMedia<br>
MAC and MB-OFDM. Communications between the MAC unit 22<br>
and the PHY unit 23 may be specified in conformity with<br>
the WiMedia MAC-PHY interface specification. Thus, the<br>
MAC unit 22 and the PHY unit 23 distributed by different<br>
vendors can be connected to each other and used together.<br>
In the WiMedia MAC-PHY interface specification,<br>
as illustrated in FIG. 2, a range from a base address<br>
(reference address) "0x00" to address "0x20" in the<br>
PHY/RF register 41 is defined as a range for storing<br>
dynamic configurations (dynamic register set) .<br>
For example, as illustrated in FIG. 3, a<br>
transmitted TFC and a band group are set in a TXCHAN<br>
 <br>
register at address "0x02" while a received TFC and a<br>
band group are set in a RXCHAN register at address<br>
"0x04".<br>
For this reason, the sub CPU 20 for executing<br>
the firmware 26 configures a transmission channel by<br>
writing the TFC and the band group in the TXCHAN<br>
register via the MAC unit 22 and a reception channel by<br>
writing the TFC and the band group in the RXCHAN<br>
register via the MAC unit 22.<br>
Also in the WiMedia MAC-PHY interface<br>
specification, a range from address "0x20" to address<br>
"0x80" in the PHY-RF register 41 is defined as a range<br>
for storing static configurations (static register set)<br>
such as communication speed and the number of<br>
configurable signal transmission levels supported by the<br>
radio communication apparatus 1.<br>
Also in the WiMedia MAC-PHY interface<br>
specification, a range from address "0x80" to address<br>
"OxFF" in the PHY/RF register 41 is defined as a range<br>
for storing configurations specific to vendors (vendor<br>
range).<br>
In FIG. 1, the MAC unit 22 attaches a MAC<br>
header to a data frame to be transmitted to the PHY unit<br>
23, encrypts the MAC header attached data frame and<br>
transmits the encrypted data frame to the PHY unit 23<br>
 <br>
via the WiMedia MAC-PHY interface bus 27.<br>
Also, the MAC unit 22 decrypts a received data<br>
frame from the PHY unit, analyzes the decrypted data<br>
frame and filters or extracts data to be further<br>
transmitted to an upper protocol from data obtained from<br>
the data frame based on the analysis.<br>
The PHY unit 23 includes a RF (Radio<br>
Frequency) unit 40, the PHY/RF register 41 and a<br>
baseband unit 42, and the baseband unit 42 includes a<br>
transmission unit 50 and a reception unit 51.<br>
The RF unit 40 performs MB-OFDM modulation on<br>
a baseband signal supplied from the transmission unit 50<br>
in the baseband unit 42 to transmit the signal as a<br>
radio wave via the antenna 24 over the air.<br>
Also, the RF unit 40 demodulates the MB-OFDM<br>
modulated signal received via the antenna 24 into a<br>
baseband signal and supplies the demodulated baseband<br>
signal to the reception unit 51 in the baseband unit 42.<br>
The transmission unit 50 in the baseband unit<br>
42 D/A (Digital-to-Analog) converts a digital data frame<br>
received from the MAC unit 22 via the WiMedia MAC-PHY<br>
interface bus 27 into an analog baseband signal and<br>
supplies the converted baseband signal to the RF unit 40.<br>
The reception unit 51 in the baseband unit 42<br>
A/D (Analog-to-Digital) converts a baseband signal<br>
 <br>
received from the RF unit 4 0 into a digital data frame<br>
and transmits the converted data frame to the MAC unit<br>
22 via the WiMedia MAC-PHY interface bus 27.<br>
FIG. 4 shows an exemplary arrangement of the<br>
reception unit 51 in the baseband unit 42. The<br>
reception unit 51 in the baseband unit 42 includes a<br>
RSSI circuit 60, a gain value computation unit 61, an<br>
A/D converter 62, an amplifier 63 and a signal<br>
processing unit 64.<br>
The RSSI circuit 60 measures RSSI as received<br>
signal strength of an analog baseband signal supplied<br>
from the RF unit 40 and supplies a signal indicative of<br>
the measured RSSI to the gain value computation unit 61.<br>
Note that the RSSI circuit 60 may serve as a signal<br>
strength measurement circuit according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
The gain value computation unit 61 computes a<br>
gain value based on the RSSI indicative of the signal<br>
supplied from the RSSI circuit 60 and one or more values<br>
configured in the PHY/RF register 41 and supplies a<br>
signal indicative of the computed gain value to the<br>
amplifier 63.<br>
The values set in the PHY/RF register 41<br>
herein means one or more gain control parameters<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "AGO_PARAM register")<br>
 <br>
written in a certain address, such as address "OxAO"<br>
relative to the base address, within the vendor range in<br>
the PHY/RF register 41 in FIG. 2.<br>
In the AGC_PARAM register, as illustrated in<br>
FIG. 5, a coefficient "gradient" indicative of the<br>
gradient of a linear function for finding an input<br>
signal from the RSSI is located in upper 4 bits, and a<br>
coefficient "intercept" indicative of the intercept of<br>
the linear function is located in lower 4 bits.<br>
The coefficients "gradient" and "intercept"<br>
for different channels are associated with each other in<br>
a table stored in the memory 21 in advance. In this<br>
manner, the memory 21 may serve as a table storage unit<br>
according to the present invention. In this embodiment,<br>
it is assumed that the coefficients "gradient" and<br>
"intercept" for the channels are predetermined through<br>
prior measurement.<br>
For example, if no frequency hopping is<br>
conducted in a channel, the coefficients "gradient" and<br>
"intercept" suitable for a band in that channel is<br>
stored in the table. On the other hand, if frequency<br>
hopping is conducted in a channel, respective average<br>
values of the coefficients "gradient" and "intercept"<br>
suitable for individual bands are stored in the table.<br>
The sub CPU 20 for executing the firmware 2 6<br>
 <br>
may set the AGC_PARAM register prior to setting the<br>
RXCHAN register in the PHY/RF register 41.<br>
In FIG. 4, the gain value computation unit 61<br>
computes a gain value based on corrected RSSI<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "cRSSI") through<br>
substitution of the RSSI into a linear function with the<br>
coefficients "gradient" and "intercept" in the AGC_PARAM<br>
register.<br>
Specifically, as illustrated in FIG. 6, the<br>
gain value computation unit 61 may substitute the RSSI<br>
(=a) into the linear function with the coefficients<br>
"gradient" and "intercept" in the AGC_PARAM register and<br>
substitute the cRSSI (=f(a)), which is an output of the<br>
linear function, into a predefined linear function g(x)<br>
to compute the gain value g(f(α)) for the amplifier 63.<br>
For a signal with uniform strength, for<br>
example, if the RSSI measured by the RSSI circuit 60 for<br>
a certain band is higher than the RSSI measured by the<br>
RSSI circuit 60 for a reference band, a linear function<br>
f (x) with the coefficients "gradient" and "intercept"<br>
at least one of which is smaller than the coefficients<br>
of the linear function f(x) for the reference band is<br>
used, and thus the cRSSI (=f'(α) ) obtained through<br>
substitution of the RSSI (=α) into f (x) would be<br>
smaller than the cRSSI (=f(α)) for the reference band.<br>
 <br>
In other words, the gain value computed by the<br>
gain value computation unit 61 becomes g(f (α)) by<br>
estimating the RSSI measured by the RSSI circuit 60 to<br>
be relatively small, resulting in a gain value larger<br>
than the gain value g(f(α)).<br>
In FIG. 4, the A/D converter 62 converts an<br>
analog signal supplied from the RF unit 40 into a<br>
digital signal and supplies the digital signal to the<br>
amplifier 63.<br>
The amplifier 63 amplifies the digital signal<br>
supplied from the A/D converter 62 based on the gain<br>
value represented by a signal supplied from the gain<br>
value computation unit 61 and supplies the amplified<br>
digital signal to the signal processing unit 64.<br>
For example, the signal processing unit 64 may<br>
perform frequency conversion and/or other operations on<br>
the amplified digital signal and transmit the resulting<br>
signal as a data frame to the MAC unit 22.<br>
Exemplary configuration operations of a<br>
reception channel in the radio communication apparatus 1<br>
including the above-stated components are described in<br>
detail with reference to FIG. 7.<br>
The WiMedia MAC-PHY interface specification<br>
specifies that if a channel is changed during<br>
communication, a beacon frame with "Channel Change<br>
 <br>
Information Element" (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"Channel Change IE") may be transmitted to a<br>
communicating opponent apparatus.<br>
The "Channel Change IE" may include the next<br>
new channel and information such as a time period until<br>
transition to the new channel. Upon receiving this<br>
beacon frame, the communicating opponent apparatus uses<br>
a transmission channel or a reception channel as a new<br>
channel based on the information in the Channel Change<br>
IE.<br>
In this manner, the configuration operations<br>
of the received channel is performed in response to<br>
activation and/or degradation of communication<br>
conditions as well as based on the information in the<br>
Channel Change IE transmitted by the communicating<br>
opponent apparatus.<br>
At step S1, the coefficients "gradient" and<br>
"intercept" corresponding to a received channel to be<br>
configured are identified by the sub CPU 20 in a table<br>
stored in the memory 21.<br>
At step S2, the identified coefficients<br>
"gradient" and "intercept" are set by the sub CPU 20 in<br>
the AGC_PARAM register in the PHY/RF register 41 via the<br>
MAC unit 22.<br>
At step S3, the received channel, that is, a<br>
 <br>
TFC and a band group, are set by the sub CPU 20 in the<br>
RXCHAN register in the PHY/RF register 41 via the MAC<br>
unit 22.<br>
As a result, when the received channel is<br>
switched in the PHY unit 23 at step S4, the PHY unit 23<br>
informs the sub CPU 20 via the MAC unit 22 that the<br>
received channel has been switched at step S5.<br>
In this manner, according to this embodiment<br>
of the present invention, the radio communication<br>
apparatus 1 computes gain values through substitution of<br>
the RSSI into a function with coefficients specific to<br>
respective channels. As a result, whenever a band is<br>
switched in a channel where frequency hopping is<br>
conducted, the radio communication apparatus 1 does not<br>
have to change the gain value and can perform AGC<br>
operations to enable fast band switching to be followed<br>
in consideration of measurement errors between bands in<br>
the signal strength measurement circuit.<br>
In this embodiment, the amplifier 63 amplifies<br>
a digital signal supplied from the A/D converter 62. As<br>
illustrated in FIG. 8, in another embodiment, the<br>
amplifier 63 may amplify a received analog signal and<br>
supply the amplified signal to the A/D converter 62.<br>
In this case, the signal strength is measured<br>
from the received analog signal, and the received analog<br>
 <br>
signal is amplified. Thus, AGC characteristics can be<br>
improved in amplification of the received signal if the<br>
signal is fast and has a high S/N (Signal to Noise)<br>
ratio.<br>
Also, in this embodiment, the gain value<br>
computation unit 61 uses a certain linear function to<br>
compute the cRRSI from the RSSI. In another embodiment,<br>
the gain value computation unit 61 may use another<br>
linear function corresponding to frequency<br>
characteristics of the RSSI circuit 60 to compute the<br>
cRSSI from the RSSI.<br>
Also, in this embodiment, if frequency hopping<br>
is conducted in channels, the respective average values<br>
of the coefficients "gradient" and "intercept" suitable<br>
for individual bands are stored in a table in the memory<br>
21. In another embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 9,<br>
values of the coefficients "gradient" and "intercept"<br>
that are suitable for the individual bands and have the<br>
smallest sample variance between the coefficients in<br>
consideration of deviations for the individual<br>
coefficients suitable for the hopping bands may be<br>
stored in the table in the memory 21.<br>
For example, assuming that coefficients<br>
suitable for individual bands are C1, C2 and C3, the<br>
coefficient Ca for causing the sample variance V in<br>
 <br>
formula (1) as presented below to be minimized is<br>
determined as the coefficient for the channel of<br>
interest.<br>
 <br>
In another embodiment, the individual terms<br>
(C1-Ca)2, (C2-Ca)2 and (C3-Ca)2 in formula (1) may be<br>
weighted, and the coefficient Ca for causing the<br>
weighted sample variance V to be minimized may be stored<br>
in the table in the memory 21.<br>
For example, it is assumed that coefficients<br>
suitable for individual bands are C1, C2 and C3. If the<br>
gain values are set to be larger in the order of C3, C2<br>
and C1, the coefficient Ca for causing the sample<br>
variance V in formula (2) as presented below to be<br>
minimized may be determined as the coefficient for the<br>
channel of interest.<br>
 <br>
According to this embodiment, if the<br>
coefficient suitable for a certain one of hopping bands<br>
is further away from the coefficients suitable for the<br>
other bands, it is possible to prevent the gain value<br>
for that band from being set at an inappropriate value.<br>
In this embodiment, the weights 1, 2 and 3 are<br>
used in formula (2), but any other weights can be used<br>
in formula (2).<br>
 <br>
Also in the above-stated embodiments, the<br>
coefficients "gradient" and "intercept" for different<br>
channels are predefined through prior measurement. In<br>
another embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 10, an<br>
attenuator 52 may be provided for attenuating a baseband<br>
signal supplied from the transmission unit 50 in the<br>
baseband unit 42 and supplying the attenuated signal to<br>
the reception unit 51, and the coefficients "gradient"<br>
and "intercept" for different channels may be stored in<br>
the table in the memory 21.<br>
For example, as illustrated in FIG. 11, upon<br>
receiving a request from the host controller 2, the sub<br>
CPU 20 selects a band to be measured via the MAC unit 22<br>
at step S11.<br>
At step S12, the sub CPU 20 causes the<br>
attenuator 52 to attenuate a signal transmitted from the<br>
transmission unit 50 such that the strength of the<br>
signal received at the reception unit 51 can meet<br>
predefined criteria. At step S13, the sub CPU 20<br>
obtains individual RSSIs measured by the RSSI circuit 60.<br>
At step S14, steps S12-S13 are repeated<br>
through variations of the reference level and<br>
attenuation rate for the attenuator 52 until a number of<br>
samples corresponding to the number of coefficients of a<br>
linear function for correcting the measured RSSIs into<br>
 <br>
cRSSIs can be obtained. For example, if the gain value<br>
computation unit 61 uses a linear function to correct<br>
the RSSI into the cRSSI, steps S12-S13 may be executed<br>
twice.<br>
Upon obtaining the corresponding number of<br>
samples, at step S15, the sub CPU 20 computes<br>
coefficients suitable for the band of interest based on<br>
the reference levels and the RSSIs.<br>
At step S16, the sub CPU 20 determines whether<br>
coefficients suitable for all the bands have been<br>
derived. If it is determined that the suitable<br>
coefficients have not been derived for all the bands,<br>
the process control returns to step Sll.<br>
On the other hand, if it is determined that<br>
suitable coefficients have been derived for all the<br>
bands, the sub CPU 20 determines coefficients for<br>
individual channels based on the derived band<br>
coefficients at step S17 and stores the determined<br>
channel coefficients in the memory 21.<br>
In this manner, the sub CPU 20 may serve as a<br>
coefficient determination unit according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
As stated above, the radio communication<br>
apparatus according to the present invention may be<br>
useful in radio communication systems complying with the<br>
 <br>
MB-OFDM scheme. In particular, if the signal strength<br>
measurement circuit has different characteristics for<br>
individual bands, the radio communication apparatus may<br>
be advantageous.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the<br>
specifically disclosed embodiments, and variations and<br>
modifications may be made without departing from the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
The present application is based on Japanese<br>
