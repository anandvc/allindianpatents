				<td>A PROCESS FOR CRACKING AN OLEFIN-RICH HYDROCARBON FEEDSTOCK<br>
The present invention relates to a process for cracking an<br>
olefin-rich hydrocarbon feedstock which is selective towards<br>
light olefins in the effluent. In particular, olefinic<br>
feedstocks from refineries or petrochemical plants can be<br>
converted selectively so as to redistribute the olefin content<br>
of the feedstock in the resultant effluent.<br>
It is known in the art to use zeolites to convert long chain<br>
paraffins into lighter products, for example in the catalytic<br>
de-waxing of petroleum feedstocks. While it is not the<br>
objective of de-waxing, at least parts of the paraffinic<br>
hydrocarbons are converted into olefins. It is known in such<br>
processes to use crystalline silicates for example of the MFI<br>
or MEL type, the three-letter designations "MFI" and "MEL"<br>
each representing a particular crystalline silicate structure<br>
type as established by the Structure Commission of the<br>
International Zeolite Association. Examples of a crystalline<br>
silicate of the MFI type are the synthetic zeolite ZSM-5 and<br>
silicalite and other MFI type crystalline silicates are known<br>
in the art. An example of a crystalline silicate of the MEL<br>
type is the synthetic zeolite ZSM-11.<br>
EP-A-0305720 discloses the production of gaseous olefins by<br>
catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons. EP-B-0347003 discloses<br>
a process for the conversion of a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock<br>
into light olefins.. WO-A-90/11338 discloses a process for the<br>
conversion of C2-C12 paraffinic hydrocarbons to petrochemical<br>
feedstocks, in particular to C2 to C4 olefins. US-A-5043522<br>
and EP-A-0395345 disclose the production of olefins from<br>
paraffins having four or more carbon atoms. EP-A-0511013<br>
discloses the production of olefins from hydrocarbons using a<br>
steam activated catalyst containing phosphorous and H-ZSM-5.<br>
US-A-4810356 discloses a process for the treatment of gas oils<br>
by de-waxing over a silicalite catalyst. GB-A-2156845<br>
discloses the production of isobutylene from propylene or a<br>
mixture of hydrocarbons containing propylene. GB-A-2159833<br>
discloses the production of a isobutylene by the catalytic<br>
cracking of light distillates.<br>
It is known in the art that for the crystalline silicates<br>
exemplified above, long chain olefins tend to crack at a much<br>
higher rate than the corresponding long chain paraffins.<br>
It is further known that when crystalline silicates are<br>
employed as catalysts for the conversion of paraffins into<br>
olefins, such conversion is not stable against time. The<br>
conversion rate decreases as the time on stream increases,<br>
which is due to formation of coke (carbon) which is deposited<br>
on the catalyst.<br>
These known processes are employed to crack heavy paraffinic<br>
molecules into lighter molecules. However, when it is desired<br>
to produce propylene, not only are the yields low but also the<br>
stability of the crystalline silicate catalyst is low. For<br>
example, in an FCC unit a typical propylene output is 3.5wt%.<br>
The propylene output may be increased to up to about 7-8wt%<br>
propylene from the FCC unit by introducing the known ZSM-5<br>
catalyst into the FCC unit to "squeeze" out more propylene<br>
from the incoming hydrocarbon feedstock being cracked. Not<br>
only is this increase in yield quite small,, but also the ZSM-5<br>
catalyst has low stability in the FCC unit.<br>
There is an increasing demand for propylene in particular for<br>
the manufacture of polypropylene.<br>
The petrochemical industry is presently facing a major squeeze<br>
in propylene availability as a result of the growth in<br>
propylene derivatives, especially polypropylene. Traditional<br>
methods to increase propylene production are not entirely<br>
satisfactory. For example, additional naphtha steam cracking<br>
units which produce about twice as much ethylene as propylene<br>
are an expensive way to yield propylene since the feedstock is<br>
valuable and the capital investment is very high. Naphtha is<br>
in competition as a feedstock for steam crackers because it is<br>
a base for the production of gasoline in the refinery.<br>
Propane dehydrogenation gives a high yield of propylene but<br>
the feedstock (propane) is only cost effective during limited<br>
periods of the year, making the process expensive and limiting<br>
the production of propylene. Propylene is obtained from FCC<br>
units but at a relatively low yield and increasing the yield<br>
has proven to be expensive and limited. Ye,t another route<br>
known as metathesis or disproportionation enables the<br>
production of propylene from ethylene and butene. Often,<br>
combined with a steam cracker, this technology is expensive<br>
since it uses ethylene as a feedstock which is at least as<br>
valuable as propylene.<br>
Thus there is a need for a high yield propylene production<br>
method which can readily be integrated into a refinery or<br>
petrochemical plant, taking advantage of feedstocks that are<br>
less valuable for the market place (having few alternatives on<br>
the market).<br>
EP-A-0921179 in the name of Fina Research S.A. discloses the<br>
production of olefins by catalytic cracking of an olefin-rich<br>
hydrocarbon feedstock which is selective towards light olefins<br>
in the effluent. While it is disclosed in that document that<br>
the catalyst has good stability, i.e. high activity over time,<br>
and a stable olefin conversion and a stable product<br>
distribution over time, nevertheless the catalyst stability<br>
still requires improvement, particularly when higher inlet<br>
temperature within the broad range disclosed (500 to 600Â°C) are<br>
employed in conjunction with a single reactor. That<br>
specification exemplifies the use of a fixed bed reactor,<br>
although it is disclosed that a moving bed reactor, of the<br>
continuous catalytic reforming type, or a fluidised bed<br>
reactor may be employed for the olefin-cracking process.<br>
During hydrocarbon conversion reactions, a carbonaceous<br>
material, i.e., coke, can be formed and deposited on a<br>
catalyst thereby causing it to lose activity. The deposited<br>
carbonaceous material on the catalyst affects the amount of<br>
active catalyst centres on the catalyst and thereby influences<br>
the extent of the hydrocarbon conversion reaction, and hence<br>
the conversion to desired products and by-products. The<br>
presence of carbonaceous material on the catalyst results in a<br>
changing product distribution that affects the downstream<br>
fractionation section and the recycle rate of unconverted<br>
hydrocarbon feed. For most hydrocarbons conversion process<br>
the loss of activity can be compensated by increasing the<br>
reaction temperature up to a value where undesirable side<br>
reactions become important or up to a value which becomes<br>
impracticable.<br>
Thus, it is further known in hydrocarbon conversion processes<br>
partially to regenerate a catalyst using a moving bed reactor.<br>
US-A-3838039 discloses a method of operating a continuous<br>
hydrocarbon process employing catalyst particles in which<br>
catalyst activity is maintained by continuous regeneration.<br>
EP-A-0273592 discloses a process for continuous de-waxing of<br>
hydrocarbon oils including reactivation of partially spent<br>
catalyst. US-A-5157181 discloses a moving bed hydrocarbon<br>
conversion process incorporating partial regeneration of a co-<br>
catalyst. US-A-3978150 discloses a continuous paraffin<br>
dehydrogenation process incorporating partial catalyst<br>
regeneration. US-A-5336829 discloses a continuous process for<br>
the dehydrogenation of paraffinic to olefinic hydrocarbons<br>
incorporating catalyst regeneration. US-A-5370786 discloses a<br>
method of operating a continuous conversion process employing<br>
solid catalyst particles in which the catalyst may be<br>
regenerated. US-A-4973780 discloses the alkylation of benzene<br>
in a moving bed incorporating partial catalyst regeneration.<br>
US-A-5849976 discloses a moving bed solid catalyst hydrocarbon<br>
alkylation process incorporating partial catalyst<br>
regeneration. US-A-5087783 discloses the transalkylation of<br>
benzene in a moving bed, incorporating partial catalyst<br>
reactivation. EP-A-0385538 discloses a process for the<br>
conversion of a straight-run hydrocarbonaceous feedstock<br>
containing hydrocarbons having such a boiling range that an<br>
amount thereof boils at a temperature of at least 330Â°C, such<br>
as a gas oil, in a moving bed reactor which may incorporate<br>
catalyst regeneration of the zeolite catalyst. EP-A-0167325<br>
discloses a process for changeover of a moving bed catalytic<br>
cracking unit's catalyst inventory from conventional catalyst<br>
to ZSM-5 containing catalyst, the feedstock comprising an oil<br>
changestock for example a blend of crude oils or a gas oil<br>
fraction. US-A-4927526 discloses a process for catalytically<br>
cracking hydrocarbon feedstock in a cracking unit to a product<br>
comprising gasoline with an increased octane number in the<br>
presence of a cracking catalyst, under cracking conditions.<br>
The process may employ moving bed catalytic cracking, with<br>
changeover of the catalyst inventory.<br>
While the use of a moving bed employing partial catalyst<br>
regeneration or reactivation has been known in the art for<br>
some time, this, to the applicant's knowledge, has not been<br>
disclosed heretofore for use in an olefin-cracking process.<br>
The olefin-cracking process as disclosed in EP-A-0921179 may<br>
be carried out at high reaction temperature close to the<br>
temperature of thermal cracking of hydrocarbon molecules.<br>
However, raising the reaction temperature in order to<br>
compensate the loss of catalytic activity in the olefin-<br>
cracking process is limited, as it will favour undesirable<br>
side reactions that are not the result of the presence of the<br>
catalyst. Moreover, the surface temperatures required to heat<br>
up the feed mixture in for instance a fire heater can become<br>
so high that thermal cracking of the feed starts.<br>
When the olefin-cracking process of EP-A-0921179 is applied in<br>
a fixed bed reactor, it is observed that at the start of the<br>
catalytic cycle small amounts of less desired products like<br>
propane are produced. This results in a lower propylene<br>
purity of the C3 fraction. Moreover, the ethylene production<br>
rate is higher at the start of the catalytic cycle than after<br>
some time. The amount of the less desired product, propane,<br>
decreases during the operation and also the ethylene product<br>
decreases. During an important period of time the propylene<br>
yield remains fairly constant while those of propane and<br>
ethylene progressively decreases. These variations during the<br>
use of the catalyst in a fixed bed reactor are the result of a<br>
changing performance of the catalyst caused by the<br>
carbonaceous material laydown.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process<br>
for using the less valuable olefins present in refinery and<br>
petrochemical plants as a feedstock for a process which, in<br>
contrast to the prior art processes referred to above,<br>
catalytically converts olefins into lighter olefins, and in<br>
particular propylene, and which process has improved catalyst<br>
stability.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for<br>
producing olefins having a high propylene yield and purity,<br>
most particularly substantially constantly over the whole time<br>
of the process.<br>
The present invention provides a process for cracking an<br>
olefin-containing hydrocarbon feedstock which is selective<br>
towards light olefins in the effluent, the process comprising<br>
passing a hydrocarbon feedstock containing one or more olefins<br>
through a moving bed reactor containing a crystalline silicate<br>
catalyst selected from an MFI-type crystalline silicate having<br>
a silicon/aluminium atomic ratio of at least 180 and an MEL-<br>
type crystalline silicate having a silicon/aluminium atomic<br>
ratio of from 150 to 800 which has been subjected to a<br>
steaming step, at an inlet temperature of from 500 to 600Â°C, at<br>
an olefin partial pressure of from 0.1 to 2 bars and the<br>
feedstock being passed over the catalyst at an LHSV of from 5<br>
to 30h-1 to produce an effluent with an olefin content of lower<br>
molecular weight than that of the feedstock, intermittently<br>
removing a first fraction of the catalyst from the moving bed<br>
reactor, regenerating the first fraction of the catalyst in a<br>
regenerator and intermittently feeding into the moving bed<br>
reactor a second fraction of the catalyst which has been<br>
regenerated in the regenerator, the catalyst regeneration rate<br>
being controlled whereby the propylene purity is maintained<br>
constant at a value corresponding to the average value<br>
observed in a fixed bed reactor using the same feedstock,<br>
catalyst and cracking conditions, for example at least 94 wt%.<br>
Preferably, the catalyst regeneration rate is controlled<br>
whereby the ethylene yield on an olefin basis is less than 10<br>
wt%.<br>
The present invention further provides a process for cracking<br>
an olefin-containing hydrocarbon feedstock: which is selective<br>
towards light olefins in the effluent, the process comprising<br>
passing a hydrocarbon feedstock containing one or more olefins<br>
through a moving bed reactor containing a crystalline silicate<br>
catalyst selected from an MFI-type crystalline silicate having<br>
a silicon/aluminium atomic ratio of at least 180 and an MEL-<br>
type crystalline silicate having a silicon/aluminium atomic<br>
ratio of from 150 to 800 which has been subjected to a<br>
steaming step, at an inlet temperature of from 500 to 600ÂºC, at<br>
an olefin partial pressure of from 0.1 to 2 bars and the<br>
feedstock being passed over the catalyst at an LHSV of from 5<br>
to 30h-1 to produce an effluent with an olefin content of lower<br>
molecular weight than that of the feedstock, intermittently<br>
removing a first fraction of the catalyst from the moving bed<br>
reactor, regenerating the first fraction of the catalyst in a<br>
regenerator and intermittently feeding into the moving bed<br>
reactor a second fraction of the catalyst which has been<br>
regenerated in the regenerator, the catalyst regeneration rate<br>
being controlled whereby all of the catalyst in the moving bed<br>
reactor is regenerated in a period of from 20 to 240 hours.<br>
Preferably, the regeneration rate is controlled whereby the<br>
propylene purity is maintained constant at a value<br>
corresponding to the average value obtained in a fixed bed<br>
reactor using the same feedstock, catalyst and cracking<br>
conditions, for example at least 94 wt%.<br>
More preferably, the regeneration rate is controlled whereby<br>
the ethylene yield on an plefin basis is less than 10 wt%.<br>
The present invention still further provides the use of<br>
catalyst regeneration of a moving bed reactor for the<br>
catalytic cracking of an olefin-containing feedstock which is<br>
selective towards lighter olefins, the catalyst regeneration<br>
being employed to average out propylene purity to higher<br>
values observed in a fixed bed reaction during an initial<br>
period, typically from 10 to 40 hours, of the olefin-cracking<br>
process.<br>
Preferably, the catalyst regeneration is also employed to<br>
average out the high ethylene yield during the initial period<br>
and the low ethylene yield during the final period observed in<br>
a fixed bed reactor.<br>
The feedstock having at least C4+ hydrocarbons may be an<br>
effluent from a fluidised bed catalytic cracking (FCC) unit in<br>
an oil refinery.<br>
The present invention provides a solution to the problem of<br>
loss of activity of the catalyst by the addition of the steps<br>
of removing deactivated catalyst from, and feeding reactivated<br>
catalyst into, the catalytic conversion zone which compensates<br>
for loss of activity without raising the reaction temperature,<br>
in particular, by using a moving bed reactor in which the<br>
catalyst circulates between a catalytic conversion zone and a<br>
catalyst regeneration zone. A moving bed reactor/regeneration<br>
combination still provides the possibility to operate the<br>
reaction section and regeneration section independently as<br>
they are physically isolated by means of lock hoppers and<br>
valves between the different sections. Each section can thus<br>
operate at its own optimal conditions and moreover the<br>
regeneration section can be temporarily shut down while the<br>
reaction section continues to operate.<br>
When employing a moving bed reactor in which intermittently<br>
catalyst is withdrawn and regenerated and consequently re-<br>
injected into the catalytic reaction zone, the catalytic<br>
performance of the catalyst in the catalytic reaction zone can<br>
be maintained constant. This will result in a constant<br>
product distribution over time. Moreover, the less desired<br>
product formation, observed at the start of the catalytic<br>
cycle in fixed bed reactors, can thus be moderated because the<br>
catalytic performance in a moving bed reactor is an average of<br>
the catalytic performance observed in fixed bed reactors.<br>
The present invention is predicated on the discovery by the<br>
inventor that in order to achieve a propylene purity i.e. a<br>
proportion of propylene in the total C3 content of the<br>
effluent, of at least 94 wt%, and preferably also to achieve<br>
an ethylene yield on an olefin basis below 10 wt%, then the<br>
use of a moving bed reactor with catalyst regeneration enables<br>
these average values to be achieved on a continuous basis,<br>
more particularly by regulating the catalyst regeneration<br>
according to the desired propylene purity, and optionally<br>
depending on the ethylene content, which is dependent upon the<br>
particular commercial requirements for the proportion of<br>
ethylene in the effluent, whereby the entire catalyst content<br>
of the moving bed reactor is regenerated in a period of from<br>
20 to 240 hours. The particular period within which the<br>
entire body of catalyst in the moving bed reactor is<br>
regenerated depends on a number of factors, including the<br>
nature of the particular catalyst, temperature, LHSV,<br>
feedstock content, etc. Fundamentally, the catalyst<br>
regeneration is carried out so that the average values of<br>
propylene purity, and preferably also ethylene yield on an<br>
olefin basis, are such as to enable high purity propylene to<br>
be produced, with the averaging essentially overcoming the<br>
technical problem of low propylene purity and optionally high<br>
ethylene yield on an olefin basis during the initial period of<br>
a fixed bed reactor, typically up to the first 10 to 40 e.g.<br>
20 or 30 hours, of the olefin cracking process. This<br>
overcomes the technical problem present in the prior art, in<br>
particular in EP-A-0921179, of low propylene purity, and<br>
optionally also high ethylene yield on an olefin basis,<br>
reducing the ability of the catalyst to produce acceptable<br>
chemical grade purity propylene, and optionally low ethylene<br>
content, over acceptable run times.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the present invention can thus<br>
provide a process using a catalyst for the production of a<br>
catalytic reactor effluent characterised by a constant<br>
composition by utilising a moving bed reactor in which the<br>
catalyst circulates between a catalytic conversion zone and a<br>
catalyst regeneration zone. The preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention can also provide a process using a catalyst<br>
whereby the formation of less desired products over fresh<br>
catalyst is tempered to an average acceptable level by<br>
utilising a moving bed reactor in which the catalyst<br>
circulates between a catalytic conversion zone and a catalyst<br>
regeneration zone.<br>
The present invention can thus provide a process wherein<br>
olefin-rich hydrocarbon streams (products) from refinery and<br>
petrochemical plants are selectively cracked not only into<br>
light olefins, but particularly into propylene. In one<br>
embodiment, the olefin-rich feedstock is passed over an MFI-<br>
type crystalline silicate catalyst with a particular Si/Al<br>
atomic ratio of either at least 180 attained after a<br>
steaming/de-alumination treatment or at least 300 with the<br>
catalyst having been prepared by crystallisation using an<br>
organic template and having been unsubjected to any subsequent<br>
steaming or de-alumination process- In another embodiment,<br>
the olefin-rich feedstock is passed over an MEL-type<br>
crystalline silicate catalyst, with a particular Si/Al atomic<br>
ratio and which has been. steamed for example at a temperature<br>
of at least 300Â°C for a period of at least 1 hour with a water<br>
partial pressure of at least 10kPa. The feedstock may be<br>
passed over the catalyst at a temperature ranging between 500<br>
to 600Â°C, an olefin partial pressure of from 0.1 to 2 bars and<br>
an LHSV of from 5 to 30h-1. This can yield at least 30 to 50%<br>
propylene based on the olefin content in the feedstock, with a<br>
selectivity to propylene for the C3 species propylene and<br>
propane (i.e. a C3-/C3s ratio) of at least 92% by weight.<br>
In this specification, the term "silicon/aluminium atomic<br>
ratio" is intended to mean the Si/Al atomic ratio of the<br>
overall material, which may be determined by chemical<br>
analysis. In particular, for crystalline silicate materials,<br>
the stated Si/Al ratios apply not just to the Si/Al framework<br>
of the crystalline silicate but rather to the whole material.<br>
The feedstock may be fed either undiluted or diluted with an<br>
inert gas such as nitrogen. In the latter case, the absolute<br>
pressure of the feedstock constitutes the partial pressure of<br>
the hydrocarbon feedstock in the inert gas.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, cracking of olefins<br>
is performed in the sense that olefins in a hydrocarbon stream<br>
are cracked into lighter olefins and selectively into<br>
propylene. The feedstock and effluent preferably have<br>
substantially the same olefin content by weight. Typically,<br>
the olefin content of the effluent is within Â±15wt%, more<br>
preferably Â±10wt%, of the olefin content of the feedstock.<br>
The feedstock may comprise any kind of olefin-containing<br>
hydrocarbon stream. The feedstock may typically comprise from<br>
10 to 100wt% olefins and furthermore may be fed undiluted or<br>
diluted by a diluent, the diluent optionally including a non-<br>
olefinic hydrocarbon. In particular, the olefin-containing<br>
feedstock may be a hydrocarbon mixture containing normal and<br>
branched olefins in the carbon range C4 to C10, more preferably<br>
in the carbon range C4 to C6, optionally in a mixture with<br>
normal and branched paraffins and/or aromatics in the carbon<br>
range C4 to C10. Typically, the olefin-containing stream has a<br>
boiling point of from around -15 to around 180Â°C.<br>
In particularly preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, the hydrocarbon feedstocks comprise C4 mixtures from<br>
refineries and steam cracking units. Such steam cracking<br>
units crack a wide variety of feedstocks, including ethane,<br>
propane, butane, naphtha, gas oil, fuel oil, etc. Most<br>
particularly, the hydrocarbon feedstock may comprises a C4 cut<br>
from a fluidised-bed catalytic cracking (FCC) unit in a crude<br>
oil refinery which is employed for converting heavy oil into<br>
gasoline and lighter products. Typically, such a C4 cut from<br>
an FCC unit comprises around 50wt% olefin. Alternatively, the<br>
hydrocarbon feedstock may comprise a C4 cut from a unit within<br>
a crude oil refinery for producing methyl tert-butyl ether<br>
(MTBE) which is prepared from methanol and isobutene. Again,<br>
such a C4 cut from the MTBE unit typically comprises around<br>
50wt% olefin. These C4 cuts are fractionated at the outlet of<br>
the respective FCC or MTBE unit. The hydrocarbon feedstock<br>
may yet further comprise a C4 cut from a naphtha steam-cracking<br>
unit of a petrochemical plant in which naphtha, comprising C5<br>
to C9 species having a boiling point range of from about 15 to<br>
180Â°C, is steam cracked to produce, inter alia, a C4 cut. Such<br>
a C4 cut typically comprises, by weight, 40 to 50% 1,3-<br>
butadiene, around 25% isobutylene, around 15% butene (in the<br>
form of but-1-ene and/or but-2-ene) and around 10% n-butane<br>
and/or isobutane. The olefin-containing hydrocarbon feedstock<br>
may also comprise a C4 cut from a steam cracking unit after<br>
butadiene extraction (Raffinate 1), or after butadiene<br>
hydrogenation.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the catalyst for the<br>
cracking of the olefins comprises a crystalline silicate of<br>
the MFI family which may be a zeolite, a silicalite or any<br>
other silicate in that family or the MEL family which may be<br>
a zeolite or any other silicate in that family. Examples of<br>
MFI silicates are ZSM-5 and silicalite. An example of an MEL<br>
zeolite is ZSM-11 which is known in the art. Other examples<br>
are Boralite D, and silicalite-2 as described by the<br>
International Zeolite Association (Atlas of zeolite structure<br>
types, 1987, Butterworths).<br>
The preferred crystalline silicates have pores or channels<br>
defined by ten oxygen rings and a high silicon/aluminium<br>
atomic ratio.<br>
Crystalline silicates are microporous crystalline inorganic<br>
polymers based on a framework of XO4 tetrahydra linked to each<br>
other by sharing of oxygen ions, where X may be trivalent<br>
(e.g. Al,B,...) or tetravalent (e.g. Ge, Si,...). The<br>
crystal structure of a crystalline silicate is defined by the<br>
specific order in which a network of tetrahedral units are<br>
linked together. The size of the crystalline silicate pore<br>
openings is determined by the number of tetrahedral units, or,<br>
alternatively, oxygen atoms, required to form the pores and<br>
the nature of the cations that are present in the pores. They<br>
possess, a unique combination of the following properties: high<br>
internal surface area; uniform pores with one or more discrete<br>
sizes; ion exchangeability; good thermal stability; and<br>
ability to adsorb organic compounds. Since the pores of these<br>
crystalline silicates are similar in size to many organic<br>
molecules of practical interest, they control the ingress and<br>
egress of reactants and products, resulting in particular<br>
selectivity in catalytic reactions. Crystalline silicates<br>
with the MFI structure possess a bi-directional intersecting<br>
pore system with the following pore diameters: a straight<br>
channel along [010]: 0.53-0.56nm and a sinusoidal channel<br>
along [100]: 0.51-0.55nm. Crystalline silicates with the MEL<br>
structure possess a bi-directional intersecting straight pore<br>
system with straight channels along [100] having pore<br>
diameters of 0.53-0.54 nm.<br>
The crystalline silicate catalyst has structural and chemical<br>
properties and is employed under particular reaction<br>
conditions whereby the catalytic cracking readily proceeds.<br>
Different reaction pathways can occur on the catalyst. Under<br>
the process conditions, having an inlet temperature of around<br>
500 to 600Â°C, preferably from 520 to 600Â°C, yet more preferably<br>
540 to 580Â°C, and an olefin partial pressure of from 0.1 to 2<br>
bars, most preferably around atmospheric pressure, the shift<br>
of the double bond of an olefin in the feedstock is readily<br>
achieved, leading to double bond isomerisation. Furthermore,<br>
such isomerisation tends to reach a thermodynamic equilibrium.<br>
Propylene can be, for example, directly produced by the<br>
catalytic cracking of hexene or a heavier olefinic feedstock.<br>
Olefinic catalytic cracking may be understood to comprise a<br>
process yielding shorter molecules via bond breakage.<br>
With such high silicon/aluminum ratio in the crystalline<br>
silicate catalyst, a stable olefin conversion can be achieved<br>
with a high propylene yield on an olefin basis of from 30 to<br>
50% whatever the origin and composition of the olefinic<br>
feedstock. Such high ratios reduce the acidity of the<br>
catalyst, thereby increasing the stability of the catalyst.<br>
The MFI catalyst having a high silicon/aluminum atomic ratio<br>
for use in the catalytic cracking process of the present<br>
invention may be manufactured by removing aluminum from a<br>
commercially available crystalline silicate. A typical<br>
commercially available silicalite has a silicon/aluminum<br>
atomic ratio of around 120. The commercially available MFI<br>
crystalline silicate may be modified by a steaming process<br>
which reduces the tetrahedral aluminum in the crystalline<br>
silicate framework and converts the aluminum atoms into<br>
octahedral aluminum in the form of amorphous alumina.<br>
Although in the steaming step aluminum atoms are chemically<br>
removed from the crystalline silicate framework structure to<br>
form alumina particles, those particles cause partial<br>
obstruction of the pores or channels in the framework. This<br>
inhibits the olefinic cracking processes of the present<br>
invention. Accordingly, following the steaming step, the<br>
crystalline silicate is subjected to an extraction step<br>
wherein amorphous alumina is removed from "the pores and the<br>
micropore volume is, at least partially, recovered. The<br>
physical removal, by a leaching step, of the amorphous alumina<br>
from the pores by the formation of a water-soluble aluminum<br>
complex yields the overall effect of de-alumination of the<br>
MFI crystalline silicate. In this way by removing aluminum<br>
from the MFI crystalline silicate framework and then removing<br>
alumina formed therefrom from the pores, the process aims at<br>
achieving a substantially homogeneous de-alumination<br>
throughout the whole pore surfaces of the catalyst. This<br>
reduces the acidity of the catalyst, and thereby reduces the<br>
occurrence of hydrogen transfer reactions in the cracking<br>
process. The reduction of acidity ideally occurs<br>
substantially homogeneously throughout the pores defined in<br>
the crystalline silicate framework. This is because in the<br>
olefin-cracking process hydrocarbon species can enter deeply<br>
into the pores. Accordingly, the reduction of acidity and<br>
thus the reduction in hydrogen transfer reactions which would<br>
reduce the stability of the MFI catalyst are pursued<br>
throughout the whole pore structure in the framework. The<br>
framework silicon/aluminum ratio may be increased by this<br>
process to a value of at least about 180, preferably from<br>
about 180 to 1000, more preferably at least 200, yet more<br>
preferably at least 300, and most preferably around 480.<br>
The MEL or MFI crystalline silicate catalyst may be mixed with<br>
a binder, preferably an inorganic binder, and shaped to a<br>
desired shape, e.g. extruded pellets. The binder is selected<br>
so as to be resistant to the temperature and other conditions<br>
employed in the catalyst manufacturing process and in the<br>
subsequent catalytic cracking process for the olefins. The<br>
binder is an inorganic material selected from clays, silica,<br>
metal oxides such as ZrO2 and/or metals, or gels including<br>
mixtures of silica and metal oxides. The binder is preferably<br>
alumina-free. Although aluminium in certain chemical<br>
compounds as in AlPO4's may be used as the latter are quite<br>
inert and not acidic in nature. If the binder which is used<br>
in conjunction with the crystalline silicate is itself<br>
catalytically active, this may alter the conversion and/or the<br>
selectivity of the catalyst. Inactive materials for the<br>
binder may suitably serve as diluents to control the amount of<br>
conversion so that products can be obtained economically and<br>
orderly without employing other means for controlling the<br>
reaction rate. It is desirable to provide a catalyst having a<br>
good crush strength. This is because in commercial use, it is<br>
desirable to prevent the catalyst from breaking down into<br>
powder-like materials. Such clay or oxide binders have been<br>
employed normally only for the purpose of improving the crush<br>
strength of the catalyst. A particularly preferred binder for<br>
the catalyst of the present invention comprises silica.<br>
The relative proportions of the finely divided crystalline<br>
silicate material and the inorganic oxide matrix of the binder<br>
can vary widely. Typically, the binder content ranges from 5<br>
to 95% by weight, more typically from 20 to 50% by weight,<br>
based on the weight of the composite catalyst. Such a mixture<br>
of crystalline silicate and an inorganic oxide binder is<br>
referred to as a formulated crystalline silicate.<br>
In mixing the catalyst with a binder, the catalyst may be<br>
formulated into pellets, spheres, extruded into other shapes,<br>
or formed into a spray-dried powder. For practising the<br>
present invention it is preferred that the formulated catalyst<br>
has a very symmetrical shape like in spheres and pellets or<br>
extrudates having equal height and wideness. It is important<br>
that the settling velocity of the catalyst particles in a gas<br>
stream is the same for all orientations relative to the gas<br>
stream direction.<br>
In the catalytic cracking process, the process conditions are<br>
selected in order to provide high selectivity towards<br>
propylene, a stable olefin conversion over time, and a stable<br>
olefinic product distribution in the effluent. Such<br>
objectives are favoured by the use of a low acid density in<br>
the catalyst (i.e. a high Si/Al atomic ratio) in conjunction<br>
with a low pressure, a high inlet temperature and a short<br>
contact time, all of which process parameters are interrelated<br>
and provide an overall cumulative effect (e.g. a higher<br>
pressure may be offset or compensated by a yet higher inlet<br>
temperature). The process conditions are selected to<br>
disfavour hydrogen transfer reactions leading to the formation<br>
of paraffins, aromatics and coke precursors. The process<br>
operating conditions thus employ a high space velocity, a low<br>
pressure and a high reaction temperature. The LHSV ranges<br>
from 5 to 30h-1, preferably from 10 to 30h-1. The olefin<br>
partial pressure ranges from 0.1 to 2 bars, preferably from<br>
0.5 to 1.5 bars. A particularly preferred olefin partial<br>
pressure is atmospheric pressure (i.e. 1 bar). The<br>
hydrocarbon feedstocks are preferably fed at a total inlet<br>
pressure sufficient to convey the feedstocks through the<br>
reactor. The hydrocarbon feedstocks may be fed undiluted or<br>
diluted in an inert gas, e.g. nitrogen. Preferably, the<br>
total absolute pressure in the reactor ranges from 0.5 to 10<br>
bars. The use of a low olefin partial pressure, for example<br>
atmospheric pressure, tends to lower the incidence of hydrogen<br>
transfer reactions in the cracking process, which in turn<br>
reduces the potential for coke formation which tends to reduce<br>
catalyst stability. The cracking of the olefins is preferably<br>
performed at an inlet temperature of the feedstock of from 500<br>
to 600Â°C, more preferably from 520 to 600Â°C, yet more<br>
preferably from 540 to 590Â°C, typically around 560Â°C to 585Â°C.<br>

Figure 1 provides a schematic illustration of a configuration<br>
for practising the process of the present invention. The<br>
description is not intended to exclude certain modifications<br>
and in order to simplify the drawing shut-off valves, solid<br>
flow controlling valves, pumps, piping and other conventional<br>
equipment readily known by the person skilled in the art are<br>
not shown.<br>
The fresh olefin-containing feed to be catalytically cracked<br>
and preferably combined with recycle feed, and optionally a<br>
diluting gas like hydrogen, steam or any other inert gas, are<br>
sent through line 1 to a feed-effluent heat exchanger 2 and<br>
further through line 3 to a heater 4 to raise the temperature<br>
of the mixture to the desired reaction temperature. Through<br>
line 5 the hot mixture is sent into a radial-flow reactor 10.<br>
The reactor 10 contains an annulus of dense phase catalyst.<br>
The feed mixture may be injected in the centre of the annulus<br>
and may leave the catalyst external to the catalyst bed<br>
annulus. Optionally, the feed mixture may be injected in the<br>
catalyst bed external to the bed annulus and may leave the<br>
catalyst bed annulus in the centre of the annulus. The<br>
reaction products leave the reaction section through line 19<br>
via the feed-effluent heat exchanger 2 to the fractionation<br>
section (not shown). In the fractionation section the<br>
different reaction products are concentrated. Unconverted<br>
feed or a produced butene-rich C4 fraction may be recycled<br>
together with fresh feed to the reaction section through line<br>
1.<br>
In accordance with the catalyst regeneration in the moving bed<br>
reactor in the present invention, the catalyst travels down<br>
under gravity through the catalyst bed annulus and is<br>
continuously or intermittently withdrawn through line 20 into<br>
a lock hopper 21 where the catalyst is purged with nitrogen in<br>
order to remove hydrocarbon vapours from the catalyst. In the<br>
lock hopper the pressure is equalised to that of a lift<br>
engager 22. The catalyst is lifted from the lift engager 22<br>
by means of a lift gas coming through line 23 to a lift dis-<br>
engager 30 through a catalyst lift line 24. The gaseous lift<br>
gas may be hydrogen, nitrogen, methane, steam or even diluted<br>
oxygen in nitrogen. The flow rate of the lift gas is<br>
sufficient to surpass the settling velocity of the catalyst<br>
particles in order to transfer the catalyst through the lift<br>
line 24 to a lift dis-engager 30. In the lift dis-engager 30,<br>
the catalyst is separated from the lift gases through line 31<br>
and the pressure is equalised to the pressure of a catalyst<br>
regeneration vessel 40. The lift gases may be recycled or<br>
sent to other purposes. The catalyst is fed from the lift<br>
dis-engager 30 through line 32 to the regeneration vessel 40.<br>
In the regeneration vessel 40 the carbonaceous material laid<br>
down on the catalyst is burned off by means of oxygen, to form<br>
carbon dioxide. The regeneration vessel 40 may consist of a<br>
cylindrical moving bed of catalyst travelling down by gravity.<br>
Alternatively, it may also consist of a radial-flow type<br>
catalyst bed. The oxidising gases are injected in the centre<br>
of the catalyst bed annulus or from the exterior of the<br>
annulus. Fresh air is provided through line 41, mixed with<br>
recycle gas coming through line 48 and compressed by means of<br>
a compressor 42 into line 43. The oxygen containing mixture<br>
goes from line 43 into the regeneration vessel 40. The<br>
combustion gases leave the regeneration vessel through line 44<br>
and goes to a vessel 45. The combustion gases are cooled down<br>
or heat exchanged and eventually dried. Water is drained off<br>
through line 46. Uncondensed gases are partially purged out<br>
through line 47, and the remaining may be recycled and mixed<br>
with fresh air through line 41.<br>
To control the combustion of the carbonaceous material on the<br>
catalyst the oxygen should be present at relatively low<br>
concentrations. The ratio of recycle gas to fresh air is<br>
generally high. The volume percent of oxygen in the oxidising<br>
gas is typically from 0.2 to 2, preferably about 0.6. Other<br>
compounds may be present in the oxidising gas, such as carbon<br>
dioxide, nitrogen and optionally carbon monoxide.<br>
During the regeneration the catalyst travels down under<br>
gravity and the carbonaceous material is progressively burned<br>
off. It may be desirable to use higher concentrations of<br>
oxygen towards the end of the regeneration vessel 40. A<br>
second inlet of oxygen containing gas may be injected into the<br>
regeneration vessel 40 more to the lower parts of the catalyst<br>
bed where carbonaceous material is already burned off to a<br>
great extent. As is known, regeneration with oxygen is<br>
exothermic and care should be taken not to exceed the<br>
temperature at which the catalyst is damaged. It is preferred<br>
not to surpass 600Â°C in the catalyst bed. The regeneration is<br>
generally started at about 450Â°C. Therefore the oxygen<br>
containing gas may be heated up before entering the<br>
regeneration vessel 40. The second oxygen containing stream<br>
which may be injected into the regeneration vessel may be<br>
heated up to a higher temperature to finish better the burn<br>
off of carbonaceous materials laid down on the catalyst. The<br>
value percent of oxygen in the second oxygen-containing stream<br>
is typically from 2 to 100, preferably from 5 to 21. Other<br>
compounds may be present in the oxidising gas, such as carbon<br>
dioxide, nitrogen and optionally carbon monoxide.<br>
The catalyst flows through line 50 to a lock hopper 51.<br>
Optionally, the regeneration may be finished here by purging<br>
first the hopper 51 with pure air at the highest allowable<br>
temperature for the catalyst, followed by a nitrogen purge in<br>
order to remove any remaining oxygen. The catalyst further<br>
flows through line 52 to a lift engager 53. By means of a<br>
lift gas, coming through line 54, the catalyst is sent to a<br>
catalyst collector hopper 61 located above the reactor 10<br>
through a catalyst transfer line 60. The catalyst is<br>
separated from the lift gases through line 62. These lift<br>
gases may be sent to other purposes or may be recycled and<br>
used again as lift gas. The pressure in the catalyst<br>
collector hopper 61 is equalised to the reactor pressure. The<br>
regenerated catalyst in the collector hopper 61 flows through<br>
line 63 into the reactor vessel 10. New fresh catalyst may be<br>
added into the catalyst collector hopper 61 through line 64,<br>
while used catalyst can be withdrawn from the regeneration<br>
system through line 65.<br>
Figure 2 shows an alternative embodiment for practising the<br>
present invention. As the cracking of long-chain olefins into<br>
lighter olefins is an endothermic reaction, it may be desired<br>
to reheat the reaction mixture. Figure, 2 shows the<br>
alternative embodiment with two moving bed reactors 10,15 in<br>
series for the olefin-cracking process. The reactor effluent<br>
of the first radial-flow reactor 10 leaves the reactor through<br>
line 11 and is sent to a reheater 12. The mixture is. sent<br>
through line 13 into the second reactor 15. The second<br>
reactor 15 can be located below the first rector 10 as<br>
illustrated or optionally the second reactor 15 is parallel to<br>
the first reactor 10. In the latter case, there is provided a<br>
catalyst lift transfer line (not shown) between the first and<br>
the second reactors 10,15. The rest of the process scheme is<br>
as explained above for Figure 1. As the catalyst becomes less<br>
active when moving down through the moving bed, it may be<br>
desired to increase the contact time of the reaction mixture<br>
with the catalyst in the second reactor. This can easily be<br>
done by increasing the thickness of the catalyst bed annulus.<br>
A still other embodiment for practising the present invention<br>
is shown in Figure 3. As the reactors are not very large, it<br>
can be advantageous to place the regeneration vessel 40 on top<br>
of the first reactor 10 (or the single reactor 10 as shown in<br>
Figure 1) . This implies one fewer catalyst transfer line<br>
which will reduce the attrition of the catalyst due to the<br>
transport step.<br>
The present invention will now be described with reference to<br>
the following non-limiting examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A feedstock having the feed composition shown in Table 1,<br>
consisting of a 50/50 wt% mixture of C4s and LCCS produced on<br>
an FCC unit was subjected to olefin catalytic cracking in a<br>
fixed bed reactor (not in accordance with the invention)<br>
comprising a crystalline silicate catalyst of the MFI-type (as<br>
generally disclosed in EP-A-0921179) having a<br>
silicon/aluminium atomic ratio of at least 270 at an inlet<br>
temperature of 585Â°C, a liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of<br>
20h~1 and an outlet pressure of 0.5 bara. The composition of<br>
the effluent over time was measured to determine the propylene<br>
(C3-) content, the ethylene (C2-) content, the isobutene<br>
(i-C4-) content and the propylene purity and the results are<br>
shown in Figure 4. The reactor is loaded with 5 litres of<br>
catalyst and the reactor operates in an adiabatical mode.<br>
From Figure 4 it may be seen that the propylene content, i.e.<br>
the yield on an olefin basis towards propylene of the olefin-<br>
cracking process, is initially slightly greater than or about<br>
35 wt% up to a period of around 35 hours, after which the<br>
propylene content rapidly decreases to a value of as low as<br>
about 18 wt% after a period of about 75 hours. This shows<br>
that the activity of the catalyst towards the production of<br>
propylene in the olefin-cracking process reduces over time,<br>
specifically for runs greater than around 35 hours. In<br>
addition, for shorter reaction times on stream, there are<br>
problems in that the ethylene content on an olefin basis of<br>
the effluent is initially high, starting from greater than 10<br>
wt% and being greater than 5 wt% up to 40 hours on stream, and<br>
also the propylene purity (i.e. the ratio of propylene to<br>
total C3 content) is initially low and increases to a value<br>
greater than 94 wt% only after a period of around 10 hours on<br>
stream.<br>
Table 2 shows values of the propylene content, ethylene<br>
content, isobutene content and propylene purity after 4<br>
specific times on stream, up to about 35 hours on stream<br>
during which the propylene yield is quite constant.<br>
In accordance with the process of the present invention, by<br>
providing a moving bed reactor with continuous catalyst<br>
regeneration, the four discrete yields in the effluent are<br>
substantially averaged to yield the average values also<br>
specified in Table 2. It may thus be seen that by using a<br>
moving bed reactor in conjunction with continuous catalyst<br>
regeneration, the composition of the effluent may be made more<br>
constant, in particular the propylene content and purity.<br>
Moreover, the formation of less desired products in the<br>
effluent, such as ethylene, which requires a relatively<br>
difficult fractionation process to be separated from the<br>
desired propylene, reduced continuously to an average<br>
acceptable level as compared to the initial level in the case<br>
of a fixed bed.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
In accordance with this Example, the same feed having a<br>
typical composition illustrated in Table 1 was fed over the<br>
same catalyst as in Example 1 and at the same inlet<br>
temperature and outlet pressure, but at a lower LHSV of 10h-1.<br>
The relationship between the olefin content and time on stream.<br>
is illustrated in Figure 5. Table 3 shows the variation<br>
between the propylene, ethylene and isobutene contents with<br>
time, together with the propylene purity variation with time.<br>
As for Example 1, for Example 2 it may be seen that the use of<br>
a moving bed reactor together with catalyst regeneration<br>
provides a substantially average value for the composition of<br>
the effluent which tends to provide an improved average value<br>
for the ethylene content and an improved average value for the<br>
propylene purity.<br>

catalyst in the moving bed reactor is regenerated in a period of from<br>
20 to 240 hours.<br>
4. A process as claimed in claim 3 wherein the propylene purity is<br>
maintained constant at a value corresponding to the average value<br>
obtained in a fixed bed reactor using the same feedstock, catalyst<br>
and cracking conditions.<br>
5. A process as claimed in claim 3 or 4 wherein the regeneration<br>
rate is controlled whereby the ethylene yield on an olefin basis is<br>
less than 10 wt%.<br>
6. Process claimed in any proceeding claim wherein the catalyst<br>
regeneration is employed to average out propylene purity to higher<br>
values observed in a fixed bed reaction during an initial period, of<br>
the olefin-cracking process.<br>
7. Process as claimed in claim 6 wherein the initial period is,<br>
from 10 to 40 hours.<br>
8. Process as claimed in claim 6 or claim 7 wherein the catalyst<br>
regeneration is also employed to average out the high ethylene yield<br>
during the initial period and the low ethylene yield during the final<br>
period observed in a fixed bed reactor.<br>
A process for cracking an olefin-containing hydrocarbon feedstock which is selective towards light olefins in the<br>
effluent, the process comprising passing a hydrocarbon feedstock containing one or more olefins through a moving bed reactor<br>
containing a crystalline silicate catalyst selected from an MFI -type crystalline silicate having a silicon/aluminium atomic ratio of at<br>
least 180 and an MEL-type crystalline silicate having a silicon/aluminium atomic ration of from 150 to 800 which has been subjected<br>
to a steaming step, at an inlet temperature of from 500 to 600ÂºC, at an olefin partial pressure of from 0.1 to 2 bars and the feedstock<br>
being passed over the catalyst at an LHSV of from 5 to 30h-1 to produce an effluent with an olefin content of lower molecular weight<br>
than that of the feedstock, intermittently removing a first fraction of the catalyst from the moving bed reactor, regenerating the first<br>
fraction of the catalyst in a regenerator and intermittently feeding into the moving bed reactor a second fraction of the catalyst which<br>
has been regenerated in the regenerator, the catalyst regeneration rate being controlled whereby the propylene purity is maintained<br>
constant at a value corresponding to the average value observed in a fixed bed reactor using the same feedstock, catalyst and cracking<br>
conditions, for example at least 94 wt%.</td>
