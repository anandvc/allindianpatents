DESCRIPTION<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to a synthetic leather with high<br>
infrared radiation reflectance, having the characteristics mentioned in the<br>
preamble of the main claim.<br>
Technological background<br>
The present invention finds particular, although not exclusive,<br>
application in the field of manufacture of synthetic leathers for covering<br>
saddles and accessories for cycles, motorcycles and vehicles in general.<br>
In this field it is known to employ low-cost synthetic leathers as<br>
covering for an inner padding of soft polymeric material, for example an<br>
expanded polyurethane.<br>
A specific family of synthetic leathers employed in this field is<br>
constituted by leathers obtained by means of spreading technique,<br>
generally multi-layered, for example based on polyurethane (PU) or<br>
plastisol based on polyvinyl chloride (PVC), these latter also known in the<br>
field as vinyl leathers.<br>
The market often requires the synthetic leathers used to be of a<br>
dark colour, normally black, and the leathers therefore have added to them<br>
pigments capable of absorbing the greater part of luminous radiation in the<br>
visible spectrum. The pigment more commonly employed in the field is<br>
carbon black, which is added to one or more of the layers constituting the<br>
synthetic leather.<br>
These leathers, however, have some drawbacks, the main one being<br><br>
constituted by the fact that, because of the dark or black coloration, they<br>
tend to overheat when exposed to solar radiation, reaching relatively high<br>
temperatures within a short time. In the case of synthetic leathers<br>
employed as covering for saddles for bicycles or motor cycles or for seats<br>
in motor vehicles, this situation occurs particularly frequently during the<br>
summer months, and is particularly unpleasant in as far as the synthetic<br>
leather comes into direct contact with the human body.<br>
In the field of processing of natural leathers, it is known to use<br>
particular pigments capable of absorbing a large part of the luminous<br>
radiation in the visible spectrum, therefore imparting to the leather a black,<br>
or at least dark, coloration and, at the same time, of reflecting a large part<br>
of the infrared radiation, responsible for the heating of the leather.<br>
European Patent Application No. 1553225 also describes the use of<br>
pigments of the type described above in an artificial leather obtained from<br>
polyester microfibre.<br>
However, the use of natural leathers or leathers based on microfibre<br>
generally proves too expensive and often not very suited to the specific<br>
applications in which the synthetic leathers obtained by spreading are used<br>
at present.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
The problem underlying the present invention is that of producing a<br>
synthetic leather structurally and functionally designed to overcome the<br>
limitations described above with reference to the prior art cited.<br>
This problem is solved by the present invention by means of a<br>
synthetic leather produced in accordance with the following claims.<br><br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
The characteristics and advantages of the invention will become<br>
clearer from the detailed description of a preferred exemplary embodiment<br>
thereof, illustrated by way of non-limiting example with reference to the<br>
appended drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic view in section of a synthetic leather<br>
produced according to the present invention,<br>
Figure 2 is a diagram representing the course of the reflectance in<br>
dependence on the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation of a<br>
leather produced according to the prior art,<br>
Figure 3 is a diagram analogous to that shown in Figure 2 but<br>
relating to the synthetic leather of Figure 1,<br>
Figure 4 is a diagram analogous to that of Figure 2, but relating to<br>
an alternative embodiment of the synthetic leather of Figure 1,<br>
Figure 5 is a diagram analogous to that of Figure 2, relating to the<br>
synthetic leather which is the subject of the diagram of Figure 4, but<br>
in a different state of analysis.<br>
Preferred way of implementing the invention<br>
In Figure 1, a synthetic leather produced according to the present<br>
invention is indicated as a whole by 1.<br>
On the leather 1 an outer surface 2 is defined which, in the final<br>
application of the leather, is intended to be facing outwards, and therefore<br>
in view. A preferred example of application of the leather 1 is that of<br>
covering for bicycle or motorcycle saddles, but other applications are of<br>
course included, such as coverings for seats, steering wheels or other<br><br>
vehicle accessories in general.<br>
The leather 1 comprises a plurality of superposed layers obtained by<br>
means of the technique of spreading a polymeric material suitable for this<br>
type of processing.<br>
Polymeric materials of this type may be polyurethane-based or,<br>
preferably, based on polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastisol, this term being<br>
intended to identify a PVC-based polymeric mixture produced by means of<br>
polymerisation in emulsion and suitably dispersed in a phthalic-based<br>
plasticiser or in other plasticisers known in the field.<br>
The leather 1 comprises, at the outer surface 2, an outer layer 3,<br>
very thin and substantially transparent, capable of conferring on the<br>
leather 1 the properties of feel, resistance to abrasion and surface finish.<br>
The outer layer 3 is preferably obtained by spreading a polymeric material<br>
based on polycarbonate, polyurethane or acrylic resin dissolved in an<br>
organic solvent, such as toluene, methylethylketone (MEK),<br>
dimethylformamide (DMF), or alcohols, in an amount of around 20 g/m2.<br>
The leather 1 further comprises a first layer 4, coupled to the outer<br>
layer 3 on the opposite side from the outer surface 2, and in which is<br>
dispersed an effective amount of pigments capable of imparting a<br>
coloration to the leather 1. Preferably, the coloration is dark, for example<br>
in the dark shades of blue, red, green or grey, and even more preferably<br>
the coloration is black.<br>
The first layer 4 is preferably obtained by spreading a PVC plastisol<br>
having a K value of between 72 and 80, dispersed in 90 phr of phthalic<br>
plasticiser and stabilised with inorganic salts based on barium and zinc, in<br><br>
an amount of around 250-400 g/m2.<br>
Advantageously, the pigments dispersed in the first layer 4 are of<br>
the type with high infrared radiation reflectance, that is to say, pigments<br>
capable of reflecting a high fraction, at least 40%, of the infrared radiation,<br>
in particular of the near infrared, and at the same time of absorbing a high<br>
fraction, at least 80%, of the luminous radiation in the visible spectrum.<br>
An example of such pigments is described in detail in European<br>
Patent Application No. 1553225, the content of which is expressly claimed<br>
herein. The quantity of pigment employed is between 3% and 10%,<br>
preferably around 5%.<br>
The leather 1 further comprises a second layer 5, coupled to the first<br>
layer 4 on the opposite side from the outer surface 2. The second layer 5 is<br>
obtained by spreading a PVC plastisol fully analogous to the plastisol of the<br>
first layer 4, in an amount of around 200-400 g/m2. The second layer 5,<br>
differing from the first layer 4, comprises an effective amount of light-<br>
coloured pigment, preferably white, reflecting the radiation both in the<br>
visible spectrum and in the region of the near infrared. A preferred<br>
example of pigment dispersed in the second layer 5 is constituted by<br>
titanium dioxide, present in the second layer 5 in an amount of between<br>
5% and 20%, for example around 7.5%.<br>
The leather 1 further comprises a third layer 6, coupled to the<br>
second layer 5 on the opposite side from the outer surface 2. The third<br>
layer 6 is obtained by spreading a PVC plastisol having a K value of<br>
between 70 and 75, dispersed in 80 phr of phthalic plasticiser, stabilised<br>
with inorganic zinc salts, and filled with calcium carbonate and crosslinked<br><br>
with isocyanate, in an amount of around 100-300 g/m2. The third layer 6<br>
has a substantially adhesive function and serves to couple, on the opposite<br>
side from the second layer 5, a layer of textile 7, for example of polyester<br>
fibre. Preferably, the textile layer 7 is of a light colour, and most<br>
preferably white.<br>
The textile layer 7 acts as a support for the polymeric layers<br>
indicated above and its presence is necessary when the leather 1 is<br>
subsequently to be coupled by means of stitching to the material covered<br>
by it. This is the case, for example, with synthetic leathers used as<br>
covering for motorcycle saddles, in which the leather must be stitched onto<br>
the underlying padding, made for example of expanded polyurethane.<br>
In other types of applications such as, for example, saddles for<br>
bicycles, the material constituting the padding, for example a polyurethane<br>
gel, is injected into a die, on the walls of which the covering synthetic<br>
leather is arranged. In this case the leather 1 does not provide the textile<br>
layer 7 nor the third adhesive layer 6, but only a thin layer (around 40-50<br>
g/m2) of polyurethane in solvent as primer.<br>
The leather 1 is obtained by means of a spreading process which is<br>
conventional per se. The first step comprises the spreading of the outer<br>
layer 3 on a papery support and drying thereof in an oven, after which, on<br>
the only just dried outer layer the first layer 4 is spread, which is then<br>
dried and following on, in a similar manner, the second layer 5 is spread<br>
and, if required, the third layer 6 and the textile layer 7. At the end of the<br>
spreading process and before the leather 1 is applied to the article to be<br>
covered, the papery support is removed.<br><br>
Some samples of synthetic leathers prepared as described<br>
hereinafter were subjected to spectrophotometric analysis according to<br>
standard ASTM E 903-96, so as to detect the course of the reflectance of<br>
the different leathers in dependence on the wavelength of the radiation to<br>
which they are exposed.<br>
All the samples were of course irradiated on the side corresponding<br>
to the outer surface.<br>
Sample 1<br>
Sample 1 represents a leather produced according to the prior art,<br>
comprising a layer of PVC plastisol, having characteristics analogous to<br>
those indicated above with reference to the first layer 4, but in which<br>
carbon black was dispersed as pigment in order to obtain the dark<br>
coloration of the leathers. The diagram resulting from the analysis is<br>
shown in Figure 2, together with the precise reflectance value recorded at<br>
980 nm.<br>
Sample 2<br>
Sample 2 was produced as described above with reference to the<br>
leather 1, with the pigment of the first layer 4 coloured black, providing<br>
also all the layers indicated above, as well as the textile layer 7, of a light<br>
colour. This represents the preferred exemplary embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The diagram resulting from the analysis is shown in<br>
Figure 3, together with the precise reflectance value recorded at 980 nm.<br>
Sample 3<br>
Sample 3 differs from the preceding sample 2 in that it does not<br>
provide the second layer 5, in which the white pigment is dispersed.<br><br>
Sample 3 was subjected to analysis in two different operating states.<br>
In the first case the sample was spread out on a light-coloured support<br>
(diagram of Figure 4), while in the second case it was spread out on a<br>
dark-coloured support (diagram of Figure 5). Both Figures 4 and 5 further<br>
indicate the precise reflectance value recorded at 980 nm.<br>
As may be observed from the results of the analyses, the leather<br>
produced according to the prior art has a reflectance of less than 10% both<br>
in the visible spectrum and in the region of the near infrared, as might be<br>
expected.<br>
With a leather of this type, therefore, the great majority of the<br>
infrared radiation is transmitted through the leather or is absorbed by<br>
same, causing the known drawback of overheating.<br>
Samples 2 and 3, however, exhibited a decidedly better behaviour.<br>
In fact, while maintaining a low reflectance in the visible field, necessary<br>
for imparting the dark coloration to the leather, they reflect a significant<br>
fraction of the infrared radiation, which will therefore not heat the leather<br>
or any underlying padding.<br>
Surprisingly, more detailed examination of the results of the<br>
analyses shows that the performances of the different samples on the<br>
other hand differ significantly from one another. In particular, it will be<br>
noted that sample 2, provided with a layer with white pigment and also<br>
with light-coloured fabric, has an optimum reflectance of around 73.5%, as<br>
a against a maximum reflectance of around 58% in the case of the<br>
absence of the layer with white pigment.<br>
It should further be noted that in the case of the absence of the<br><br>
layer with the white pigment, the colour of the support on which the<br>
sample to be analyzed is deposited also assumes importance, inasmuch as<br>
when changing from a light-coloured to a dark-coloured support the<br>
reflectance drops from around 58% to around 41%. On the other hand,<br>
the presence of the layer with white pigment renders substantially<br>
negligible the coloration of the support on which the sample is deposited<br>
during analysis.<br>
The results therefore highlight the importance of the provision in the<br>
multi-layer structure of the synthetic layer according to the invention of a<br>
layer capable of reflecting the infrared radiation, constituted to some<br>
extent by the light-coloured textile and, in particular, by the layer with the<br>
white pigment. That layer therefore has the function of reflecting a large<br>
part of the infrared radiation not reflected by the pigments with high IR<br>
reflectance that are present in the first layer. The polymeric material<br>
constituting the different layers of the leather is in fact substantially<br>
transparent to infrared radiation.<br>
The presence of the layer of white pigment and/or of the light-<br>
coloured textile therefore advantageously makes it possible to avoid<br>
overheating, not only of the synthetic leather, but also of the material to<br>
which the leather itself is applied.<br>
Particularly important and typical is the case of polyurethane<br>
paddings used for saddles for bicycles, motorcycles and vehicles in general,<br>
which absorb a considerable part of the infrared radiation and which would<br>
therefore tend to overheat and to heat the synthetic leather by conduction.<br>
It should further be noted that such layer may conveniently be light-<br><br>
coloured or white, without altering the colour of the leather as perceived by<br>
the user when examining it on the outer surface, which is normally the only<br>
visible one, inasmuch as this layer is always hidden by the first layer<br>
containing the high-reflectance coloured pigments.<br>
The present invention therefore solves the problem mentioned<br>
above with reference to the prior art cited, at the same time offering<br>
numerous other advantages, including the fact that, by avoiding<br>
overheating of the synthetic leather, its service life is also extended, owing<br>
to the slowing down of the normal ageing processes.<br><br>
