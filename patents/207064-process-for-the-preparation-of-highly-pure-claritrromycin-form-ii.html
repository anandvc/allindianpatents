The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a process for direct preparation of highly pure 6-O-methyl erythromycin A (Clarithromycin) Form II from crude 6-O-methyl-N-demethylerythromycin A, key intermediate of Clarithromycin, to obtain highly pure 6-O-methyl erythromycin A form II (Clarithromycin) with purity above 98%.Also disclosed is a simple, safe and cost-effective process for the manufacture of highly pure 6-O-methyl erythromycin A (Clarithromycin) Form II from erythromycin A -9-Oxime derivative.<br><br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART:<br>
6-O-methyl erythromycin A   (Clarithromycin) of_Formula I, is a semi synthetic macrolide antibiotic, which exhibits strong antibacterial activity towards a wid range of bacteria  inclusive of gram  positive bacteria,  some gram  negativ bacteria. anerobic bacteria, Mycoplasma, Chlamidia and Helicobacter pylori, and also can be used as a raw material for the synthesis of other antibiotics, and it therefore is a pharmaceutical  important material.<br><br>
r*t'y<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Prior art process for preparing 6-O-methy! erythromycin A from erythromycin A -9-Oxime are disclosed in EP patent document nos. EP 0,158,467, EP 0,195,960 and EP 0,272,110 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,719,272 and WO 97/36913.<br>
Separately from the above processes, a process for preparing 6-0-methylerythromycin A from erythromycin A-9-oxime is disclosed in U.S. Pat. document No. 4,672,109 but it has several limitations in obtaining pure 6-0-methylerythromycin A at commercial scales.<br>
US 4,672,109 describes selective 6-O-methylation of erythromycin A-9-oxime. However, this process have several drawbacks like it gives lower yield and requires multiple purification of intermediates and final product so as to obtain 6-O-methyl erythromycin A with desired purity. Also, it requires more volume of solvents, involves more time to obtain Clarithromycin of desired purity and also involves wage of increased utility, manpower and cost at commercial production.<br>
The method comprises protecting oxime hydroxy group of erythromycin A 9-oxime with an aralkyl group such as O-chloro benzyl group, and protecting the hydroxy group at the 2' position and dimethylamino group at the 3' position with arylalkoxy carbonyl groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl group, and thereafter carrying out alkylation such as methylation of the hydroxy group at the 6' position. The resultant 6-O-methyl-N-demethylerythromycin A of Formula (II) is recrystallized from a mixture of chloroform and diethyl ether. Use of carcinogenic<br><br><br>
solvents like chloroform and highly flammable solvent like diethyl ether, having low flash point should be avoided at commercial level. Repetition of the process described in US 4672109 revealed at our hand that chloroform does not efficiently reduces the impurities of 6-O-methyl-N-demethylerythromycin A and as a result of this, to obtain Clarithromycin of the desired purity within pharmacopoeial limits number of purifications are required. Also, Chloroform being a class II solvent as per ICH guidelines, a concentration limit of only 60 ppm is allowed in finished good. This shall require excessive drying of the finished good in order to bring down the chloroform content below ICH limits, which will be associated with large energy consumption by way of excessive drying. Hence, it is not desirable to use halogenated class II solvent in penultimate stage because of the lower permissible limit of such solvents in the final drug. Moreover it is anesthetic in nature and inhalation of this may reduce the alertness of the people. Due to this people working in the plant may lead to safety hazards.<br>
Accordingly, the prior art processes suffer from inherent difficulties like multiple purification of intermediates and also of final 6-O-methylerythromycin A.<br>
Also, It has been reported that clarithromycin exists in at least three distinct crystalline forms, "Form 0", "Form I" and "Form II" (International Publication Nos. WO 98/04573 and WO 98/31699). The crystal forms can be identified by infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction spectrophotometry.<br>
However, the drugs currently available are known to be formulated from the thermodynamically more stable Form II. Preparation of the current commercial entity therefore, requires converting the form I crystals to form II. Typically this is done by heating the form I crystals under vacuum at high temperature of about 70° C which make such processes energy intensive and cost-extensive.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION :<br>
It is, therefore, the basic object of this invention to provide a process for the manufacture of 6-O-methyl-erythromycin A (clarithromycin) with high purity, avoiding the drawback limitations of the prior art processes.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of 6-O-methyl erythromycin A, which would be high yielding, cost effective, easy to operate at industrial scale, be safe to carry out and without not involving carcinogenic, anesthetic and highly explosive solvents and with desired purity as per established Pharmacopoeial limits.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process of manufacture of 6-O-methyl erythromycin A, which would avoid unreacted contaminants and side products of the previous steps in the final product and provides the final product with good yield and purity.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a simple, safe and cost-effective method for the purification of 6-O-methyl-N-demethylerythromycin A, a valuable intermediate in the manufacture of 6-O-methyl-erythromycin A (clarithromycin). Whose purity is very important for obtaining highly pure 6-O-methyl erythromycin A (Clarithromycin).<br>
Yet further object of the invention is to provide a process for preparation of highly pure Clarithromycin form II that would not require the use of carcinogenic and anesthetic solvent like chloroform and highly flammable diethyl ether, which are hazardous to handle at commercial scale.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide an efficient and robust purification method of intermediates having high levels of impurities and thereby directly isolating highly pure Clarithromycin form II within Pharmacopoeial limit.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a direct isolation of highly pure Clarithromycin form II that would be industrially favorable in the way that the same would increase the plant capacity and will also require less manpower and less effluent problem.<br><br>
A further object of this invention is to provide the method which would be industrially feasible for large-scale preparation of clarithromycin Form II crystal.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In the above discussed processes of the invention directed to manufacture of pure 6-O-methylerythrtpmycin form II, the crude 6-O-methyl-N-demethylerythromycin A used can be from any known sources preferably obtained from erythromycin A-9 oxime derivative.<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect the method comprises protecting oxime hydroxy group of erythromycin A 9-Oxime with an aralkyl group such as O-chloro benzyl group, and protecting the hydroxy group at the 2' position and dimethylamino group at the 3' position with arylalkoxy carbonyl groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl group, and thereafter carrying out alkylation such as methylation of the hydroxy group at the 6 position and hydrogenolysis and followed by deoximation of the resultant compound gives crude 6-O-methyl-N-demethylerythromycin A.<br>
In accordance with a further preferred aspect the process for the preparation of highly pure 6-O-methylerythromycin A (Clarithromycin) Form II from the crude 6-O-methyl-N-demethylerythromycin A comprises-<br>
a) purification of crude 6-O-methyl-N-demethylerythromycin A carried out by at least dissolution and/or suspension in organic solvent preferably selected from group of methanol, ethanol, iso-propanol, n-propanal, ethyl acetate, THF, toluene, acetonitrile , Methanol : Ethyl Acetate(90:10), Acetone, or mixtures thereof.<br><br>
b)	N-methylation of thus purified 6-O-methyl-N-demethylerythromycin A (HPLC purity &gt; 95%) in presence of formic acid and formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde in water miscible organic solvents and<br>
c)	adjusting pH 8-11 with base;<br>
d)	isolating therefore highly pure 6-O-methylerythromycin A form II.<br>
The process of purification of crude 6-O-methyl-N-demethylerythromycin A in accordance with the present invention thus essentially involves the steps of at least partially dissolving and/or suspending the crude 6-O-methyl-N- demethylerythromycin A as prepared by known method, in organic solvent  system and initiating the crystallization of pure 6-O-methyl-N-demethylerythromycin A either by cooling or by addition of water or both. The dissolution may be in whole or in part.<br>
The organic solvent system can preferably comprise alcohol selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, iso-propanol, n-propanol or mixtures thereof. Preferably, the above purification is carried out at ambient temperature to boiling point of solvent.<br>
Further N-methylation of pure 6-O-methyl-N-demethylerythromycin A is carried out in presence of aqueous formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde and formic acid, which directly gives highly pure 6-O-methylerythromycin A (Clarithromycin) form II crystal.<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect, the method of the present invention comprises of dissolving the crude 6-O-methyl-N-demethylerythromycin A at a temperature near to that of the reflux temperature of the organic solvent and then adding water slowly till slight turbidity persisted. Thereafter, the mixture is cooled slowly to room temperature and some more amount of water is added to the     reaction mixture. Finally the reaction mixture is cooled to 15-20°C and agitated    for approximately 2 hours. The mixture is filtered and the purified solid is dried under reduced pressure to give pure 6-O-methyl-N-demethylerythromycin A.<br>
Further N-methylation of pure 6-O-methyl-N-demethylerythromycin A is carried out in aqueous aqueous formaldehyde or paraformaldehyde solution and formic<br><br>
acid and the mixture was refluxed for 2-8 hr. After completion of the reaction more amount of methanol is added at RT to reflux temperature and pH is adjusted to about 10-11. Water is slowly added to the reaction mixture and further refluxed for 30 minutes to 2 hours. The reaction mixture is then cooled ambient to 5-15 °C agitated for 1-4 hrs, filtered and washed with copious amount of water so as to render the neutral pH. The mixture is filtered and the purified under reduced pressure to directly afford the highly pure 6-O-methyl erythromycin A form II. The process of the invention is illustrated in Scheme I:<br><br><br><br>
The selective purification method herein described allows reducing in an<br>
efficient way, the impurities present in N-demethyl 6-O-methylerythromycin A.<br>
The crystal structure of the 6-O-methyl erythromycin A thus prepared has the<br>
endotherm in DSC at 226.61 °C (Figure I) and the XRD (Figure II) reported as<br>
