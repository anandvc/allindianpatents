				<td>This invention relates to a process for the production of zinc tetroxy chromate.<br>
The invention relates basically to the paint and pigment industry and useful for the iron and steel industry, especially in prevention of corrosion of structural steels, in aesthetic look of the structures and pipelines, carrying industrial/sea water.<br>
Corrosion of metal is bound to take place which could be minimised to a very low level but cannot be checked completely. Atmospheric corrosion contributes more than 60% of corrosion of metals and steels since the steel items are excessively exposed to different environments. The situation of steels in the marine atmosphere is very serious because of severity of the condition. In order to mitigate the corrosion, different preventive measures, namely metallic, inorganic, diffusion, organic coatings, etc., are in use. Out of these preventive measures, organic coatings are considered more promising and used widely because of ease of application, availability to the need of the situation and its aesthetic reasons.<br>
In order to meet the need of the industries, appropriate corrosion preventive pigments are used in the formulation.   Widely used zinc tetroxy chromate is  one<br><br>
of the pigments used in paint industry. Hitherto known process uses chromic oxide and zinc oxide for the preparation of zinc tetroxy chromate at non-specified parameters .<br>
The  known process consists of  reacting	suspended<br>
zinc  oxide in water with chromic oxide  while	stirring<br>
continuously.   The  reaction takes 12 to  14	hours  to<br>
complete  which may be represented by  the	following<br>
equation.<br>
(Equation Removed)<br><br>
However,  the existing process is costly in  the  sense<br>
that  it uses zinc oxide (ZnO) and chromic oxide  (CrO )<br>
3<br>
which have high cost.  Optimisation of  parameters  are<br>
difficult to maintain due to the fact that (1) amount of<br>
ZnO  and  CrO needed for complete  conversion  to  zinc 3<br>
tetroxy chromate are not fixed, leading to wastage  of<br>
material as well as carry over of unreacted  ingredients<br>
and (2) also it takes 12 to 14 hour time to complete the<br>
reaction.<br>
It  is  generally observed that  chromate  effluent<br>
from passivation bath/tinplate processing tank, chromium<br>
+ 6 electroplating bath contains hexavalent chromium (Cr  ).<br>
+ 3 It  is reduced to trivalent chromium  (Cr  )before  discharging  into water since it leads to water pollution.<br>
This, therefore, incurs recurring expenditure. In view of the above facts, it is envisaged to develop a process to produce a value added (zinc tetroxy chromate) product out of the chromate effluent.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the production of zinc tetroxy chromate from chromate based effluent which overcomes above mentioned drawbacks.<br>
In  the present invention, the effluent is  treated<br>
+ 6 with alkali and peroxides which convert Cr   compounds,<br>
such  as dichromates to chromates and ferrous to  ferric<br>
which may be represented by the following equations :<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
+ + Further, soluble impurities like Fe   are  precipi-<br>
+ 3 tated  out as hydroxide of Fe  .  pH of the solution  is<br>
maintained at a suitable alkaline pH for complete precipitation of the tetroxy chromate with the addition of more alkali. The yellow precipitate so formed is allowed to settle for 10-30 minutes, filtered, washed  and<br>
o dried at 100-120 C for 4-6 hours.  Finally, the  product<br>
is pulverised and packed.<br>
Another novelty of the present invention is that level + of  Cr   in the final discharge is reduced to  a very  low<br>
level (
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the production of zinc tetraoxy chromate which comprises :<br>
(i) treating 100-150 litre of chromate effluent with 5 to 15 kgs. of strong alkali and oxidising agent selected from compounds having peroxide group followed by boiling for a period of 3 to 10 minutes to obtain solution containing ferric hydroxide,<br>
(ii) removing terric hydroxide by filtering to obtain filtrate,<br>
(iii) adding hydrated metal chloride and alkali in a concentration range of 40-50% to maintain the pH in the range of 8 to 10 the filtrate obtain in step (2) stirring the solution for 15 minutes at room temperature to obtain precipitate, (iv)  washing  the precipitate so obtain and  filtering  by<br>
conventional  methods  and drying at a temperature  in  the<br>
o range  of  100-120 C for a period in the range of  1  to  4<br>
hours to obtain a solid cake,<br>
(v)   pulverizing the cake to particle size in the range of<br>
100  to  250 mesh size and packing to obtain  zinc  tetroxy<br>
chromate.<br>
The amount of Filtered effluent used may ra-ge from 100 -150 lits,<br>
Metal chloride used in the range of 20 -  40 i<g></g>
Alkali in the range of 5 -  15 kg<br>
According to a feature of the invention, the chromate effluent containing Cr+6 may be selected from passivation bath, tinplate processing tank or chromium plating bath and may hsve composition in the range of 5-10 gm/litre. The effluent may be alkalised using caustic lye of 40 - 50%, sodium, potassxjm or lithium hydroxide and subsequently oxidized with sodium peroxide or hydrogen peroxide for conversion of dichromatea (if any) to chromates and Fe to Fe (i.e. hydroxides) respectively. Ferric hydroxide, so obtained, may be filtered cut using usual filtering unit. The filtrate may be treated with soluble metal chloride which may be selected from barium, zinc, lead, strontium and the like. The concentration of the chloride may be in the range of 20 - 40%. The resultant mixture may further be alkalized with alkali, such as potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or lithium hydroxide and the like for maintaining the pH in the range of 8 to 10.<br>
By the process of present invention, very bright yellow pigment is obtained having .purity of 99% and the yield is 99.963%. The time taken for producing this compound is 3 to 4 hours only. The resultant effluent contains traces of sulphate and chloride, 2 ppm of Cr+  as given in Table-1.<br>
TABLE-1<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and should not be construed to limit the scope of invention.<br>
Example-1<br>
100 ml of the effluent of Tinplate processing tank containing chromate in the range of 1.7-2% is treced with 0.5 ml of 6% hydrogen peroxide and, then, with 4 gms of potassium hydroxide to make it alkaline. The resultant solution is boiled for 5 minutes and cooled. Ferric hydroxide, so formed is filtered by usual procedure The solution treated with 20 gms of zinc chloride (hydrated) isstirred for 5-10 minutes. 7.5 gms of potassium hydroxide is, then, added and stirred to bring the pH to 8-9, yellow precipitate of zinc tetroxy chromate starts precipitati . The precipitate is filtered and cashed till no soluble impurities left out.  It is dried at 110°C for 3 hours,<br>
pulverised and packed.  Zinc tetroxy chromate of 99% purity is obtained with yellow coloration.<br>

The filtrate was analysed and found to contain 
Example-2<br>
100 ml of the effluent as in Example-1 is treated with 0.5 ml of 6% hydrogen peroxide and, then, with 2 gms of potassium hydroxide to bring the solution to alkaline condition. The whole mixture is boiled for 5 minutes to convert any ferrous ions to ferric ions. After cooling, the solution is filtered to remove ferric hydroxide.<br>
The filtrate treated with 25 gms of zinc chloride (hydrated) of commercial grade. Then, 9 gms of potassium hydroxide (commercial grade) is added to bring the pH to 9. The solution is stirred for 15 minutes at room temperature. Yellow precipitate, so obtained, is filtered and washed till no soluble impurities is left out. It is dried at 120°C for 3 hours, pulverized and packed. Zinc tetroxychromate of 99,2% purity is .obtained.<br>

The filtrate was found to contain 
Example-3<br>
250 ml of the chromate effluent from Tinplate processing tank is treated with 1.5 ml of 6% hydrogen peroxide and, then, with 5. gms of sodium hydroxide to make the solution alkaline. The whole mixture is boiled for about 5 minutes to convert any ferrous ions to ferric ions. After cooling, the solution is filtered to remove ferric hydroxide. Then, the filtrate is treated with 70 gms of zinc chloride (hydrated) • of commercial grade, and thereafter, 20 gms of sodium hydroxide is added.' The solution is, then, stirred for 10 minutes at room temperature. Yellow precipitation starts precipitating which is filtered and washed till no soluble impurities is left out. It is,' then dried at 110°C for 4 hours, pulverised and packed. The purity of tetroxy chromate is 99%.<br>
Result<br>
The filtrate was found to contain
