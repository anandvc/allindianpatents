3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the<br>
invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
Description<br>
The invention describes a power semiconductor module consisting of a casing with base<br>
plate or for mounting on a heat sink and at least one electrically insulating chip arranged in<br>
it. This chip itself consists of an insulating body with a several mutually isolated metallic<br>
connecting tracks on it and power semiconductor components duly connected through<br>
circuit with these connecting tracks. Advantageously, the chip on its bottom side has a flat<br>
metallic layer, comparable with the connecting tracks. Further, these kinds of power<br>
semiconductor modules have connecting elements for external load and aux. contacts and<br>
partially also connecting elements for connections in the inside of the power semiconductor<br>
module. According to the state of technology, for this purpose materially flush connection<br>
variants, mainly designed as soldered joints are known but also as adhesive joints.<br>
Power semiconductor modules, which are the starting point of this invention, are known<br>
from examples from the DE 39 37 045 A 1 or from the DE 10 2004 019 568 A 1 not pre-<br>
published. In the DE 39 37 045 A l a power semiconductor module is represented in form of<br>
a half bridge circuit arrangement. This power semiconductor module has metallic molds in<br>
flat design as external load connection elements for both the DC connections and for the AC<br>
connection. These metallic molds designed as connecting bands are arranged for the<br>
reduction of parasitic inductivities in the inside of the module as closest as possible near<br>
each other. Dependent of the band type design for the reduction of parasitic inductivities<br>
these connecting bands have several "low ends" for the contact with the conducting tracks of<br>
the chip. These low ends have a greater distance between them in comparison with their<br>
lateral expansion.<br>
The DE 10 2004 019 568 A 1 shows a similar design of connecting elements of a power<br>
semiconductor module. Herein, in the vicinity of low points of the connecting elements a<br>
number of depressions in the PCB of the chip are provided to receive excess solder material.<br>
Herein, the low point of the connection element is designed as a part in flat design of the<br>
connecting element which itself is designed as metallic mold, wherein this flat surface is<br>
arranged parallel to the chip.<br>
2<br><br>
According to the printed documents said to be state of technology the chips of these kinds<br>
of power semiconductor modules are designed as insulating chip consisting of an insulation<br>
body as base material and for electrical insulation against a base plate or against a heat sink.<br>
This insulation body consists - as per state of technology - of industrial ceramic for example<br>
aluminum oxide or aluminum nitrite. On this insulation body, on its first main surface<br>
opposing the base plate or the heat sink, there are a number metallic connecting tracks<br>
electrically insulated from each other. On these mere are power semiconductor components<br>
arranged. Mostly the insulation body has on the second main surface facing the base plate<br>
or the heat sink also a metallic layer of the same material and same thickness like the<br>
connecting tracks on the first main surface. Normally this layer however by itself is not<br>
structured, since this for example serves the soldering connection to a base plate. The<br>
connection tracks as well as the metallic layer of the second main surface consist preferably<br>
of copper applied according to the DCB (direct copper bonding) process.<br>
For connecting the said conductor tracks with the power semiconductor components<br>
connecting elements are arranged, which are designed according to the state of technology<br>
as metallic molds or as wire bond connections. Further, on these connecting tracks and<br>
with connecting elements connected as flush with material, which are also designed as<br>
metallic molds, are arranged for external electrical connection of the power semiconductor<br>
module. The connecting elements as well as the connecting elements in the shape of<br>
metallic molds made preferably of copper, since it has especially advantageous electrical<br>
properties. Further, these metallic molds on their surface can have a tin or silver layer for<br>
improving the solder properties.<br>
Material flush connections between connecting tracks of the chip and connection or<br>
connecting elements show the disadvantage that this connection has mechanical stresses.<br>
These mechanical stresses have their origin in the temperature load of the power<br>
semiconductor module. These kinds of power semiconductor modules have for example<br>
operating temperatures between -40°C and +90°C The thermal expansion coefficient of the<br>
lead and connection elements is determined by the material used, in this case preferably<br>
copper. As against this the thermal expansion coefficient of the chip is mainly determined<br>
3<br><br>
by the insulation body. Through the thermal load of the power semiconductor module and<br>
the considerably lower thermal expansion coefficient of the chip compared with that of lead<br>
and connection elements the mechanical stress occur in the connection point between the<br>
chip and the lead or connection element.	<br>
Further from the printed documents DE 35 05 086 A 1, DE 44 46 527 Al and DE 101 03 084<br>
Al lead or connection elements also arranged as flush with material are known. The said<br>
printed documents, however, do not contribute any far reaching knowledge regarding the<br>
design of these kinds of lead or connection elements in the sense of this invention. These<br>
show exclusively different designs of the path and the low points of the connecting<br>
elements.<br>
The task of the invention, which is based on it, is to introduce a material flush connection<br>
between a lead and/or connection element and a connecting track of a chip and / or a<br>
power semiconductor component, wherein the lead or connection element is arranged as<br>
being suitable for the connecting track or the power semiconductor component and the<br>
mechanical stresses in this material flush connection are effectively reduced.<br>
The task is resolved according to the invention through the measures.of the features of claim<br>
1. Preferred design forms are described in the sub-claims.<br>
The invention relation thought originates from a power semiconductor module with a base<br>
plate or for direct mounting on a heat sink. This power semiconductor module has at least<br>
following components: a casing, connecting elements for load and aux. leads, a chip with<br>
conductor tracks, a power semiconductor component and a connecting element.<br>
The connecting elements for load and aux. contacts lead from the casing and serve as<br>
electrical connection of components arranged in the inside of the casing. The electrically<br>
insulating chip designed as base plate or heat sink itself is made of an insulation body,<br>
preferably of industrial ceramic material and mutually electrically insulated metallic<br>
connecting tracks located on the first main surface on the opposite side of the base plate or<br>
the heat sink. On these connecting tracks power semiconductor components are arranged<br>
and are connected in proper circuits, with the connecting tracks and/or other power<br>
semiconductor component and / or connecting elements. More internal connecting<br>
elements connect at least two connecting .tracks with each other or with power<br>
4<br><br>
semiconductor components.<br>
At least one of these lead and / or connection elements is developed as metallic mold with<br>
at least one contact surface to a connecting track and arranged as butt joint with this<br>
connecting track. This at least one contact surface is designed as multiple part-contact<br>
surfaces, wherein every part-contact surface has a maximum area of 20mm2 and two each of<br>
part-contact surfaces have a maximum distance of 5mm between them. Further, the<br>
connection of part-contact surfaces to the connecting tracks and/or power semiconductor<br>
components is designed as flush with material.<br>
Of advantage in the said design of the lead and connection elements is the fact that the<br>
mechanical stresses are distributed on both the part-surfaces and hereby the service life, in<br>
case of thermal load of the power semiconductor module, is extended. Especially in the<br>
deployment of lead-free solders, which normally have a lower ductility than lead containing<br>
solders, thus the invention based connection between the lead or connection element and<br>
the connecting track has lower mechanical stresses and thus a high service life.<br>
The invention related thought is explained in more details on the basis of design examples<br>
of Fig. 1 to 4<br>
Fig. 1 shows a power semiconductor module with arrangement of butt joint to connecting<br>
elements.<br>
Fig. 2 shows chips with lead and connection elements as per state of technology.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a chip with invention based lead and connection elements.<br>
Fig. 4 shows special designs of lead and connection elements.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a power semiconductor module (10) with arrangement of butt joint with<br>
connecting elements. Represented is the arrangement of a PCB (100) and a power<br>
semiconductor module (10) in the side view, wherein the PCB (100) and the power<br>
semiconductor module (10) are shown as being at slight distance from each other. The<br>
power semiconductor module (10) itself has a base plate (20). On this the frame type casing<br>
(30) and both the chips (50) are arranged. Each chip (50) consists of an insulation body (54)<br>
and of metallic laminations, which are arranged on both the main surfaces. The metallic<br>
5<br><br>
lamination (53) facing the base plate (20) is designed as flat surface and not structured. As<br>
against this the lamination facing the inside of power semiconductor module is structured<br>
in itself and thus forms the conductor tracks (54) of the chip.<br>
On these conductor tracks (54) the power semiconductor components (56) are arranged. The<br>
electrical connecting elements form the power leads (40) and the aux. leads (60). The press<br>
contacted aux. leads (60) are designed as contact springs and require pressurization for<br>
secure electric contacting between the conductor tracks (54) of the chip (50) and allocated<br>
conductor tracks (120) of the PCS (100).<br>
The connecting elements (40) of the power leads are formed through metallic molds, which<br>
at their one end soldered with the allocated conductor track (54) of the chip (50) as butt<br>
joint and at their other end have a cavity for screwed connection.<br>
The casing (30) as a single piece forming a frame and a lid has molded shapes for<br>
positioning and fixing of power leads (40) and aux. leads (60). Each of the power leads are<br>
fixed in a molded shape of the casing<br>
The PCB (100) has conductor tracks (120) on its side facing the power semiconductor<br>
module. These form the contact points of the contact springs and serve thus for the<br>
connection to the conductor tracks (54) of the chip (50).<br>
More lead connections of power leads (40) for connecting to the DC intermediate circuit<br>
and the load are designed here as cable connections (220).<br>
Fig. 2a shows a chip (50) with lead (40) and connection elements (70) as per the state of<br>
technology. Represented here are the insulation body (52) of the chip (50) and the<br>
conductor tracks (54) designed on this. On two of these conductor tracks (54) one power<br>
semiconductor component (56) each is arranged. One of these power semiconductor<br>
components (56) is connected, for example, by means of wire bonding connections (72)<br>
with a neighboring conductor track (54).<br>
On this conductor track (54) a connecting element (40) as per state of technology is arranged.<br>
This connecting element (40) is designed as metallic mold and has a section (42) parallel to<br>
the chip (50), which forms the contact surface (420) to the chip (50) or to its connection track<br>
(54). This section is connected - as duly flushed with material - by means of a soldered<br>
6<br><br>
connection with the conductor track (54) not explicitly shown, A connecting element (70)<br>
connects two conductor tracks (54) with each other. This connecting element (70) is also<br>
designed as metallic mold and has at the connecting points, the contact surfaces (720) to the<br>
conductor tracks (54) also each one of related section (72) parallel to the chip (50). In similar<br>
type of design also connecting elements (70) between a conductor track (54) and a power<br>
semiconductor component are known since a long time, here represented is the alternative<br>
variant by means of a wire bonded connection (80).<br>
Fig. 2b shows mainly the same arrangement and the same components like Fig. 2a. In<br>
contrast to Fig. 2a the lead (40) and connection elements (70) here have no sections parallel to<br>
the chip (50). Here the lead (40) and connection elements (70) are soldered as butt joint by<br>
means of their contact surfaces (400,700) on the connecting tracks (54).<br>
Fig, 3 shows a chip (50) with invention based lead (40) and connection elements (70). The<br>
major components, like chip (50) and power semiconductor components (56) are identical<br>
like those in Fig. 2a. In contrast to Fig. 2b here the lead (40) and connection elements (70) are<br>
further developed according to the invention. The connecting element (40) is also soldered<br>
as butt joint on the connecting track (54). However, the contact surface between connecting<br>
element (40) and connecting track (54) is designed not as a continuous surface but as two<br>
partial surfaces (402).<br>
For this purpose, the metallic mold of the lead element (40) has a cavity (44). This cavity (44)<br>
starts from the metallic mold surface facing the chip (50) and stretches itself in triangular<br>
shape from the first (404) to the second main surface (406). Herein the area content of each<br>
partial surface (402) is smaller than 20mm2 and the distance between the partial surfaces<br>
(402) between 1mm and 5mm, The materially flush connection between the conductor track<br>
(54) and the connecting element (40) is designed as solder joint, wherein the soldering<br>
reaches in the cavity (44) and thus fills this nearly fully or fully.<br>
In the same manner also the connecting element (70) is designed. Herein the contact surfaces<br>
also have a division in two partial contact surfaces (702), each with a triangular shaped<br>
cavity (74).<br>
Fig. 4 shows, for example, special designs of parts of lead (40) or connection elements (70).<br>
Fig. 4a shows a design of the cavity (44a) according to Fig. 3, wherein here however the<br>
narrow edges area additionally matched. Further, here the individual partial contact<br>
surfaces (402, 702) are shown in plane view as well as their distance (1mm 
each other.<br>
7<br><br>
Fig. 4b shows a slotted design of the cavity (44a, 74a) of the lead (40) or connection elements<br>
(70). Herein the slot is designed as suitable for soldering starting from the contact surface.<br>
This kind of a slot (44a, 74a) is advantageously not filled fully with solder while preparing<br>
the solder joint. Distanced from the contact surface the metallic mold has as contraction (46,<br>
76) still two more slots arranged orthogonal to the first for compensating the torsion forces.<br>
Fig. 4c shows a design of a lead (40) or connection element (70) with two cavities (4'4a, 74a)<br>
as per Fig. 4a. A multiple of such kind of cavities (44a, 74a) further reduce the mechanical<br>
stresses. However, also a minimum area size of partial surfaces of 4mm2 is advantageous.<br>
The individual contact surfaces (402, 702) are in-turn shown in plane view, as well as their<br>
distance (1mm 
Fig. 4d shows a lead (40) or connection elements (70) as per Fig. 4a, which has, however, in<br>
defined distance from the contact surface two slots separated from each other but in<br>
overlapping position, which form here two contractions (48, 78) and serves as strain relief.<br>
