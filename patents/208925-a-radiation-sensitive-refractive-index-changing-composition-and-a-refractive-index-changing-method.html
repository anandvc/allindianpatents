				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
RADIATION SENSITIVE REFRACTIVE INDEX CHANGING COMPOSITION<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a radiation sensitive refractive index changing composition, refractive index changing method, refractive index pattern forming method, refractive index pattern and optical material. More specifically, it relates to a refractive index pattern forming method which gives a novel refractive index pattern and an optical material for use in optoelectronic and display fields, a refractive index changing method and a radiation sensitive refractive index changing composition suitably used in these methods. Description of the Prior Art<br>
In the current society called "multi-media society", refractive index distribution type optically molded products each consisting of different refractive index regions are in great demand. The products include not only optical fibers for transmitting information but also optical diffraction gratings having a periodical change in refractive index, optical memories in which information is written at sites having different refractive indices, optically coupled elements such as optical IC's having a fine refractive index pattern, optical control elements, optical modulation elements and optical transmission elements.<br>
The refractive index distribution type optically molded products are divided into two types: one having a continuous refractive index distribution in a molded product, such as GI type optical fibers (to be referred to as "GRIN optically molded products" hereinafter) and the other having a discontinuous refractive index distribution, such as<br><br>
optical diffraction gratings and SI type optical waveguides.<br>
The GRIN optically molded products are attracting much attention as the next-generation optically molded products. For example, a GI type optical fiber whose refractive index is reduced from the center axis of the core of the optical fiber to the periphery in a parabolic form can transmit a great volume of information. A GRIN lens whose refractive index continuously changes therein is used as a reading lens for use in copiers, spherical lens for connecting fibers, or micro-lens, making use of its characteristic features that it has refractive power even on a flat surface and that it is free from spherical aberration.<br>
A large number of methods of producing the above GRIN optically molded products have been proposed up till now. For example, JP-A 9-133813, JP-A 8-336911, JP-A 8-337609, JP-A 3-192310, JP-A 5-60931 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application"), WO93/19505 and WO94/04949 disclose a method of obtaining a GI type optical fiber by dispersing a low molecule weight compound or a monomer into a polymer and continuously distributing its concentration.  JP-A 62-25705 discloses that a rod-like GI type optically molded product or optical fiber is obtained by photo-copolymerizing two or more vinyl monomers having different refractive indices and reactivity ratios. Further, JP-A 7-56026 discloses a method of obtaining a refractive index distribution by forming a polymer A having a photo-reactive functional group, dispersing a compound B having a lower refractive index than the polymer A into the polymer A to form the concentration distribution of the compound B and photo-reacting the polymer A with the compound B.<br>
Some methods of producing GRIN optically molded products of an inorganic material have also been proposed. One of them is, for example, a method of producing a GI type<br><br>
rod by adding high refractive index thallium to rod-like glass essentially composed of silicon or lead, immersing the glass in a molten solution containing low refractive index potassium, and forming a potassium concentration distribution by ion exchange.<br>
A GRIN lens can be obtained likewise by applying the above method to a short rod, that is, lens-like optically molded product. Alternatively, the GI type rod produced by the above method may be sliced.<br>
As one of the methods of producing an optically molded product having a fine refractive index pattern, such as the above optical diffraction grating or optical IC, there is known a technology for obtaining a change in refractive index by causing a photochemical reaction in a molded product through exposure to light. For instance, in the case of an inorganic material, glass doped with germanium is exposed to light to change its refractive index so as to produce an optical diffraction grating. In the case of an organic material, the above technology is known as a photochromic reaction or photobleaching.  JP-A 7-92313 discloses a technology for obtaining an optical diffraction grating by causing a change in refractive index through the exposure of a material containing a low molecule weight compound having photochemical reactivity dispersed in a polymer to a laser beam. Further, JP-A 9-178901 has recently proposed the application of this technology to the production of a GRIN optically molded product. This method provides a continuous refractive index distribution in a depth direction with respect to irradiation, making use of the fact that light irradiated onto a molded product is absorbed and weakened in intensity.<br>
However, in the refractive index distributions obtained with the above conventional materials, the maximum refractive index difference is only about 0.001 to 0.02 and<br><br>
it is difficult to provide a wider refractive index distribution for preventing an optical loss and suppressing the malfunction of a circuit•<br>
When the above conventional materials are used under the condition that light having a wavelength close to the wavelength used for changing the refractive index passes therethrough after a refractive index distribution is formed, it is impossible to prevent a phenomenon that a gradual change in refractive index occurs, thereby deteriorating the materials, Problem to Be Solved by the Invention<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the above situation of the prior art.<br>
That is, it is an object of the present invention to provide a refractive index pattern and an optical material whose refractive indices are changed by a simple method, whose changed refractive index differences are sufficiently large and which are stable regardless of use conditions after forming and a novel method of forming the same.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description. Means for Solving the Problem<br>

Secondly, the above objects and advantages of the present invention are attained by a method of changing refractive index, comprising exposing the above radiation sensitive refractive index changing composition of the present invention to radiation.<br>
Thirdly, the above objects and advantages of the<br><br>
present invention are attained by a method of forming a refractive index pattern, comprising exposing part of the above radiation sensitive refractive index changing composition to radiation.<br>
In the fourth place, the above objects and advantages of the present invention are attained by a refractive index pattern formed by the above method of forming a refractive index pattern.<br>

When the particle diameters are larger than 2 µm, the transparency of the obtained refractive index changing composition may lower or a film obtained therefrom may have a problem with its surface state.<br>
The shapes of the oxide particles are not particularly limited but preferably substantially spherical because the scattering of input light is small.<br>
The above oxide particles may be contacted to a silane coupling agent, surfactant or coordination compound having coordination capability to a metal atom constituting the oxide to modify their surfaces before use.<br><br>
The binder component is a non-decomposable compound which is stable to an acid or base and preferably has high optical transparencγ-<br>
The non-decomposable compound is an acrylic resin, urethane-based resin, polyester-based resin, polycarbonate-based resin, norbornene-based resin, styrene-based resin, polyether sulfone-based resin, silicon resin, polyamide resin, polyimide resin, polysiloxane-based resin, fluorine-based resin, polybutadiene-based resin, vinylether-based resin, vinylester-based resin or the like. Any preferred non-decomposable compound can be selected depending on the refractive index of the decomposable compound (A) used. To increase its difference from the refractive index of the decomposable compound (A), a non-decomposable compound having an aromatic group, halogen atom or sulfur atom may be advantageously used.<br>

In the present invention, a refractive index pattern can be formed from the above refractive index changing composition as follows, for example.<br>
First, the refractive index changing composition is dissolved or dispersed in a solvent to prepare a composition solution having a solid content of 5 to 70 wt%. The composition solution may be filtered with a filter having an opening diameter of about 0.1 to 10 pm as required before use.<br>
Thereafter, this composition solution is applied to the surface of a substrate such as a silicon wafer and prebaked to remove the solvent so as to form a coating film of the refractive index changing material. Part of the formed coating film is then exposed to radiation through a pattern mask and baked after exposure (PEB) to produce a refractive index difference between exposed and unexposed portions of<br><br>
the refractive index changing material.<br>
An acid or base is formed from the radiation sensitive decomposer (C) by the above exposure to act on the component (A) to decompose it. This decomposed product dissipates at the time of baking after exposure. As a result, there is produced a difference in refractive index between exposed and unexposed portions.<br>

The refractive index changing composition used in the present invention is molded into various shapes in consideration of application purpose before exposure to radiation. For example, it is molded like a rod, fiber, long plate, sphere, film or lens to which the present invention is not limited. A commonly used method may be used to mold the refractive index changing composition of the present invention. For example, injection molding, compression molding, blow molding, extrusion, in-case frame polymerization, shaving, drawing, heating/cooling, CVD deposition, sintering or scanning may be employed. According to the application purpose of an optically molded product, spin coating, slitting, bar coating, solvent casting, LB, spraying, roll coating, relief-printing or screen printing may also be used.<br><br>
In this molding process, heating (to be referred to as '"prebaking" hereinafter) is preferably carried out. The heating condition which changes according to the composition of the material of the present invention and the type of each additive is preferably 30 to 200°C, more preferably 40 to 150°C. A hot plate or oven, or infrared radiation may be used for heating.<br>
The radiation used for exposure is an i-ray having a wavelength of 365 nm, h-ray having a wavelength of 404 nm, g-ray having a wavelength of 436 nm, ultraviolet radiation from a wide wavelength light source such as a xenon lamp, far ultraviolet radiation such as a KrF excimer laser beam having a wavelength of 248 nm or an ArF excimer laser beam having a wavelength of 193 nm, X-radiation such as synchrotron radiation, charged corpuscular beam such as electron beam, visible radiation or a mixture thereof. Out of these, ultraviolet radiation and visible radiation are preferred. The illuminance which depends on the wavelength of the radiation is preferably 0.1 to 100 mW/cm2 because the highest reaction efficiency is obtained. Exposure to the above radiation through a pattern mask makes possible the patterning of the radiation sensitive refractive index changing material. As for patterning accuracy which is affected by a light source used, an optical part having a refractive index variation distribution with a resolution of about 0.2 µm can be produced.<br>
In the present invention, heating (to be referred to as "post-exposure baking (FEB)") is preferably carried out after exposure. A similar device to the above prebaking device may be used for FEB and FEB conditions may be arbitrary. The heating temperature is preferably 30 to 150°C, more preferably 30 to 130°C.<br>
When the refractive index changing composition of the present invention does not contain the optional component<br><br>
(D) , stabilization with the stabilizer (D) is then preferably carried out.<br>
The stabilizer (D) used in the present invention has the function of stabilizing the residual decomposable compound (A) contained in the refractive index changing composition after exposure to provide stability to an acid or base. This stabilization prevents a change in refractive index and hence the deterioration of a refractive index pattern formed by the method of the present invention even when it is used under the condition that light having a wavelength close to the wavelength used to change the refractive index passes therethrough-<br>
Examples of the above stabilizer (D) include an amino compound, epoxy compound, thiirane compound, oxetane compound, alkoxymethyl melamine compound, alkoxymethyl glycoluril compound, alkoxymethyl benzoguanamine compound, alkoxymethyl urea compound, isocyanate compound, cyanate compound, oxazoline compound, oxazine compound, halogenated silyl compound and other silyl compound.<br>
Specific examples of these compounds are the same as those listed for the above stabilizer (D) . Besides the above amino compounds, a low-boiling compound such as ammonia or triethylamine may be used as the amino compound.<br>
These stabilizers (D) may be used alone or in combination of two or more. The amount of the component (D) may be excessive so that the residual decomposable compound (A) can react to the full but it is generally 10 parts or more by weight, preferably 15 parts or more by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the component (A) . When the amount of the component (D) is smaller than 10 parts by weight, the stability of the refractive index changing material may become unsatisfactory due to an incomplete reaction.<br>
A catalyst may be used in combination with the stabilizer (D). Use of the catalyst promotes a reaction<br><br>
between the component (D) and the residual decomposable compound (A).<br>
Examples of the catalyst are the same as those listed for the catalyst described for the stabilizer (D).<br>
For contact between the refractive index changing composition after exposure to radiation and the stabilizer (D) for stabilization, a suitable method may be employed. For instance, the component (D) and optionally a catalyst are dissolved in a suitable solvent to be contacted to the refractive index changing composition as a solution. Alternatively, when the component (D) is liquid or gas under contact conditions, it may be 100 % directly contacted to the refractive index changing composition.<br>
When a solvent is used in the reaction between the above stabilizer (D) and the component (A), the solvent preferably dissolves the component (D) and an optionally added catalyst and does not dissolve the component (A) . If the above solvent is selected, the surface of the obtained refractive index pattern will not be roughened.<br>
Examples of the solvent include water; alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, iso-propanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, iso-butanol, tert-butanol, cyclohexanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and diethylene glycol; ethers such as diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran; glycol ethers such as ethylene glycol monomethyl ether and ethylene glycol monoethyl ether; ethylene glycol alkyl ether acetates such as methyl cellosolve acetate and ethyl cellosolve acetate; diethylene glycols such as diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether and diethylene glycol dimethyl ether; propylene glycol monoalkyl ethers such as propylene glycol methyl ether and propylene glycol ethyl ether; propylene glycol alkyl ether acetates such as propylene glycol methyl ether acetate and propylene glycol ethyl ether acetate; propylene glycol alkyl ether acetates<br><br>
such as propylene glycol methyl ether propionate, propylene<br>
glycol ethyl ether propionate, propylene glycol propyl ether<br>
propionate and propylene glycol butyl ether propionate;<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene; aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as n-hexane, n-heptane and n-octane;<br>
ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone, cyclohexanone, methyl<br>
isobutyl ketone, methylamyl ketone and<br>
4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone; esters such as ethyl<br>
acetate, propyl acetate, butyl acetate, ethyl<br>
2-hydroxypropionate, methyl 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropionate,<br>
ethyl hydroxyacetate, butyl hydroxyacetate, ethyl lactate,<br>

3-ethoxypropionate, butyl 3-propoxypropionate and butyl<br>
3-butoxypropionate; fluorine atom-containing solvents such<br>
as trifluoromethylbenzene, 1,3-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene,<br>
hexafluorobenzene, hexafluorocyclohexane,<br>
perfluorodimethylcyclohexane, perfluorom^thylcyclohexane,<br>
octafluorodecalin and<br>
1,l,2-trichloro-l,2,2-trifluoroethane; and aprotic polar<br>
solvents such as dimethyl formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide,<br>
dimethyl acetamide and N-methylpyrrolidone,<br>
Out of these solvents, water, alcohols, glycol ethers, ethylene glycol alkyl ether acetates and fluorine atom-containing solvents are preferred.<br>
The reaction temperature for carrying out a reaction between the stabilizer (D) and the residual decomposable compound (A) is generally 0 to 130°C, and the reaction time is generally 10 seconds to 1 hour.<br>
When the refractive index changing composition of the present invention contains the stabilizer (D) as an optional<br><br>
component, heating is preferably carried out for the stabilization of a reaction between the residual component (A) and the component (D) successively after post-exposure baking or separately. The heating temperature for stabilization is preferably 35 to 200°C, more preferably a temperature 10"C or more higher than the PEB temperature, much more preferably a temperature 20" C or more higher than the PEB temperature.<br>
Further, re-exposure may be carried out to decompose the residual component (C) existent in the unexposed portion and further improve the stability of the material.<br>
The re-exposure may be carried out by applying radiation having the same wavelength as the radiation used to change the refractive index to the entire surface of the pattern in the same amount.<br>
Optionally, heating may be further carried out to further improve the stability of the material. A similar device to the prebaking device used at the time of molding the material may be used for heating and the heating conditions may be arbitrary. In the refractive index pattern formed as described above of the present invention, the refractive index of the exposed portion is higher than that of the unexposed portion. This difference can be adjusted to a desired value by controlling the types and contents of the components (A) and (B) in the refractive index changing material used in the present invention. For example, the maximum value of refractive index difference can be adjusted to a value larger than 0.02.<br>
Since the refractive index pattern of the present invention does not deteriorate without a change in refractive index even when it is used under the condition that light having a wavelength close to the wavelength used to change the refractive index passes therethrough as described above, it is extremely useful as an optical material for use in<br><br>
optoelectronic and display fields.<br>
