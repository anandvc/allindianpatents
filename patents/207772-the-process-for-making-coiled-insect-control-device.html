GODREJ SARALEE LTD.,<br>
Of  Pirojshanagar, Eastern Express Highway,<br>
Vikhroli (E), Mumbai 400 079, Maharashtra, India,<br>
An Indian Company<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES AND<br>
ASCERTAINS THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN<br>
WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED:-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
D OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to coiled insect control device comprising an enlarged burnable tip portion for quick ignition, instant release of insect control agents without extinguishing for control of flying insects such as mosquitoes and flies.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Coiled mosquito repellent consists of slowly burnable solid materials that contain an insect control ingredient such as repellent, insecticide, or an insect growth regulator. These coils are burnt to release smoke thus vaporizing the insect control ingredient along with the smoke thereby dispersing the insecticide ingredient in the air constantly to repel mosquitoes from the area.<br>
Conventional mosquito incense coils are available in flat spiral shape with double coils nested one within the other. The user has to separate the double coil and use the single coil daily. It is often observed that while trying to separate the double coils, they tend to break making it inconvenient for use. Also the conventional coils because of their sizes and shapes break easily during manufacturing, handling and transporting.<br><br>
Hence mosquito coils must be made so that they can be easily lit, yet they must burn at a very slow rate once lit so as to provide extended protection throughout the night. This places a significant limitation on the shape and composition of mosquito coils.<br>
U.S.Pat No. 544713 discloses a mosquito coil having a conventional spiral configuration, and U.S.Pat No 3754861 teaches a mosquito coil having a match-like ignition tip containing potassium chloride as an oxidizer (albeit the tip does not contain any insect control ingredient). It is also known to have solid fumigants as described in US pat No 4296091. These solid fumigants comprise allethrin, tabu powder, starches, wood powder, cocoshell powder, and dye in mosquito coils. US pat no 4296091 describes use of perfumes in a mosquito coils. All these prior art devices does not explain methods to release high amount of active ingredient for instant effect when lit.<br>
In US Patent 5948424 describes improved mosquito repellent coil having radially outward insect control ingredient that is linked to an insect control ingredient-containing inner coil. The inner coil extends radially inward from the radially outward region in spiral fashion. This coil configuration has basic problem in extinguishing and the coil extinguishes when lit. Hence there is a need to improve the existing coils.<br>
The object of the present invention to provide a coiled insect control device that can be lit easily.<br><br><br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a coiled insect control device that does not extinguish when lit more particularly when the coil is lit in the enlarged burnable tip region.<br>
These and other objective of the invention will be clear from foregoing description of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a process of making a coiled insect repellent device comprising a burning material, filler, insect control agent, fire retardant, dye and perfume wherein the coiled insect repellent device containing insect control agent has an enlarged burnable tip that ends sharply and the said burnable portion runs inwardly in the form of coil to form the insect repellent device.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention describes a process of making a coiled insect control device containing insect control agent such as insecticides, insect repellents and insect growth regulators wherein the device has an enlarged burnable tip that tapers in the end for efficient burning and instant release of active and the said enlarged tip runs inwardly in the form of coil. The said device can be burnt continuously for 8-12hrs for efficient control of mosquitoes.<br><br><br>
Description of the drawings:<br>
Fig 1: represents the top view of the coiled insect repellent device of the present invention<br>
Fig 2: represents the cross section view taken along A-A<br>
Fig 3 represents an alternate embodiment of the invention.<br>
Fig 1-2 shows the preferred embodiment of the present invention where in the coils are nested one with each other in a spiral shape.<br>
The coiled insect control device has an enlarged burnable tip 10 that tapers sharply as in 11 for efficient burning and more release of insect control ingredients in the beginning. This instant and high release provides greater control of mosquitoes immediately when the coil is lit. The enlarged burnable portion 10 runs inwardlyl2 in the form of coil having lesser width than the burnable portion 10. The inward region 12 ends in an enlarged portion 13 for support of the coil while burning.<br>
Conventionally coils give a continuous release of insect control agent for repelling/killing mosquitoes and flies. When the coil is lit, it take few minutes for the room to get saturated with the insect control agent. It is not<br><br><br>
possible with conventional coils with this amount to drive away the mosquitoes instantly.<br>
The coil configuration with enlarged burnable tip provides high release of insect control agent in the initial hours and also avoids extinguishing unlike the prior art coils due to its tapering tip.<br>
Fig 3 shows an alternate embodiment of the invention where in the coiled insect repellent device has a hole 14 punched through and through in the enlarged burnable tip portion for efficient ignition and avoids extinguishing. The hole in the tip portion provides an air gap so the coil burns continuously without extinguishing.<br>
It is also possible that portions 10,11,12 can have cross sectional configuration in the form of circular oval, rectangular, square, oval elliptical, triangular and combinations thereof.<br>
The coiled insect control device according to the present invention contains insect control agents in the range of 0.01-5%, and most preferably 0.01-1% and still preferably 0.01-0.5%w/w.

The coiled insect repellent device is manufactured wherein the powder ingredients are mixed with perfume, dye, preservative in a rotary blender for 15-30mts and the resultant mixture is added to water previously emulsified with the active repellent compound and kneaded uniformly at room temperature for about 0.5-1 hr. to get dough. This dough is extruded as uniform sheet, stamped and punched using circular moulds to get the desired coil and finally drying the coil to obtain the coiled insect control device of the present invention.<br>
To further illustrate the invention, examples are set forth below. It is to be noted that the foregoing examples are not to be considered unduly limitative of the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
EXAMPLE<br>
The formulation for preparing the coiled insect control device of the present<br>
invention is as follows:<br>
Composition WAV<br>
Coconut shell powder (burning material)	5-45%<br>
Saw dust powder (filler material)	5-40%<br>
Esbiothrin (Insect control agent)	0.01-0.5%<br>
Potassium Nitrate(Fire retardant)	0.01-1%<br>
Guar Gum (Binder)	0.1-20%<br>
Emulsifier	0.1-0.5%<br>
Dye	0.01-0.3%<br>
Perfume	0.01-0.3%<br>
First guar gum is weighed and heated at 150° C in half the quantity of the water to form a paste. The dry ingredients such as coconut shell powder and sawdust are blended in a rotary blender to get a uniform mixture for about 15-30mts. This mixture is placed in a kneader and then to the kneaded mixture is added with remaining water emulsified with active. This mixture is added in the kneader to make uniform dough. This dough is extruded in the form of ribbon sheet and punched with circular mould and dried to obtain the desired coil. The resultant coil weighs around 3-6gm with a length of approximately 90-95cm and circular cross-section width of 3-6mm.<br><br><br>
The coil thus produced is lit and burned upto 7-8hrs continuously without extinguishing.<br>
For analyzing the release of active ingredient in the coil, the coil is burnt under a bell jar and the smoke along with active is trapped in a column packed in silica using suction pump for 30 to 60 min. The column is washed with acetone, evaporated in rotavapor and analyzed in GC.<br><br>
Sample	Release of active in the first      30min       after lighting(%)	Total release after 10-12hr of burning (%)<br>
Test coil	80.34	80<br>
Prior art coil	70.03	75<br>
From the above table it is clear that the insect control device of the present invention showed higher amount of release in the initial hours than the prior art coil indicating instant control.</td>
