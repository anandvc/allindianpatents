				<td>OPTIMIZED LIQUID-PHASE OXIDATION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to a process for the liquid-phase,<br>
catalytic oxidation of an aromatic compound. One aspect of the invention<br>
concerns the partial oxidation of a dialkyl aromatic compound (e.g., paraxylene)<br>
to produce a crude aromatic dicarboxylic acid (e.g., crude terephthalic<br>
acid), which can thereafter be subjected to purification and separation. Another<br>
aspect of the invention concerns an improved bubble column reactor that<br>
provides for a more effective and economical liquid-phase oxidation process.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Liquid-phase oxidation reactions are employed in a variety of existing<br>
commercial processes. For example, liquid-phase oxidation is currently used<br>
for the oxidation of aldehydes to acids (e.g., propionaldehyde to propionic acid),<br>
the oxidation of cyclohexane to adipic acid, and the oxidation of alkyl aromatics<br>
to alcohols, acids, or diacids. A particularly significant commercial oxidation<br>
process in the latter category (oxidation of alkyl aromatics) is the liquid-phase<br>
catalytic partial oxidation of para-xylene to terephthalic acid. Terephthalic acid<br>
is an important compound with a variety of applications. The primary use of<br>
terephthalic acid is as a feedstock in the production of polyethylene<br>
terephthalate (PET). PET is a well-known plastic used in great quantities<br>
around the world to make products such as bottles, fibers, and packaging.<br>
In a typical liquid-phase oxidation process, including partial oxidation of<br>
para-xylene to terephthalic acid, a liquid-phase feed stream and a gas-phase<br>
oxidant stream are introduced into a reactor and form a multi-phase reaction<br>
medium in the reactor. The liquid-phase feed stream introduced into the reactor<br>
contains at least one oxidizable organic compound (e.g., para-xylene), while the<br>
gas-phase oxidant stream contains molecular oxygen. At least a portion of the<br>
molecular oxygen introduced into the reactor as a gas dissolves into the liquid<br>
phase of the reaction medium to provide oxygen availability for the liquid-phase<br>
reaction. If the liquid phase of the multi-phase reaction medium contains an<br>
insufficient concentration of molecular oxygen (i.e., if certain portions of the<br>
reaction medium are "oxygen-starved"), undesirable side-reactions can generate<br>
impurities and/or the intended reactions can be retarded in rate. If the liquid<br>
phase of the reaction medium contains too little of the oxidizable compound, the<br>
rate of reaction may be undesirably slow. Further, if the liquid phase of the<br>
reaction medium contains an excess concentration of the oxidizable compound,<br>
additional undesirable side-reactions can generate impurities.<br>
Conventional liquid-phase oxidation reactors are equipped with agitation<br>
means for mixing the multi-phase reaction medium contained therein. Agitation<br>
of the reaction medium is supplied in an effort to promote dissolution of<br>
molecular oxygen into the liquid phase of the reaction medium, maintain<br>
relatively uniform concentrations of dissolved oxygen in the liquid phase of the<br>
reaction medium, and maintain relatively uniform concentrations of the<br>
oxidizable organic compound in the liquid phase of the reaction medium.<br>
Agitation of the reaction medium undergoing liquid-phase oxidation is<br>
frequently provided by mechanical agitation means in vessels such as, for<br>
example, continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs). Although CSTRs can<br>
provide thorough mixing of the reaction medium, CSTRs have a number of<br>
drawbacks. For example, CSTRs have a relatively high capital cost due to their<br>
requirement for expensive motors, fluid-sealed bearings and drive shafts, and/or<br>
complex stirring mechanisms. Further, the rotating and/or oscillating<br>
mechanical components of conventional CSTRs require regular maintenance.<br>
The labor and shutdown time associated with such maintenance adds to the<br>
operating cost of CSTRs. However, even with regular maintenance, the<br>
mechanical agitation systems employed in CSTRs are prone to mechanical<br>
failure and may require replacement over relatively short periods of time.<br>
Bubble column reactors provide an attractive alternative to CSTRs and<br>
other mechanically agitated oxidation reactors. Bubble column reactors provide<br>
agitation of the reaction medium without requiring expensive and unreliable<br>
mechanical equipment. Bubble column reactors typically include an elongated<br>
upright reaction zone within which the reaction medium is contained. Agitation<br>
ot me reaction meuium in me reaction zone is provided primarily by the natural<br>
buoyancy of gas bubbles rising through the liquid phase of the reaction medium.<br>
This natural-buoyancy agitation provided in bubble column reactors reduces<br>
capital and maintenance costs relative to mechanically agitated reactors.<br>
Further, the substantial absence of moving mechanical parts associated with<br>
bubble column reactors provides an oxidation system that is less prone to<br>
mechanical failure than mechanically agitated reactors.<br>
When liquid-phase partial oxidation of para-xylene is carried out in a<br>
conventional oxidation reactor (CSTR or bubble column), the product<br>
withdrawn from the reactor is typically a slurry comprising crude terephthalic<br>
acid (CTA) and a mother liquor. CTA contains relatively high levels of<br>
impurities (e.g., 4-carboxybenzaldehyde, para-toluic acid, fluorenones, and<br>
other color bodies) that render it unsuitable as a feedstock for the production of<br>
PET. Thus, the CTA produced in conventional oxidation reactors is typically<br>
subjected to a purification process that converts the CTA into purified<br>
terephthalic acid (PTA) suitable for making PET.<br>
One typical purification process for converting CTA to PTA includes the<br>
following steps: (1) replacing the mother liquor of the CTA-containing slurry<br>
with water, (2) heating the CTA/water slurry to dissolve the CTA in water, (3)<br>
catalytically hydrogenating the CTA/water solution to convert impurities to<br>
more desirable and/or easily-separable compounds, (4) precipitating the<br>
resulting PTA from the hydrogenated solution via multiple crystallization steps,<br>
and (5) separating the crystallized PTA from the remaining liquids. Although<br>
effective, this type of conventional purification process can be very expensive.<br>
Individual factors contributing to the high cost of conventional CTA<br>
purification methods include, for example, the heat energy required to promote<br>
dissolution of the CTA in water, the catalyst required for hydrogenation, the<br>
hydrogen stream required for hydrogenation, the yield loss caused by<br>
hydrogenation of some terephthalic acid, and the multiple vessels required for<br>
multi-step crystallization. Thus, it would be desirable to provide a CTA product<br>
that could be purified without requiring heat-promoted dissolution in water,<br>
hydrogenation, and/or multi-step crystallization.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a more<br>
effective and economical liquid-phase oxidation reactor and process.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a more effective and<br>
economical reactor and process for the liquid-phase catalytic partial oxidation of<br>
para-xylene to terephthalic acid.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a bubble column<br>
reactor that facilitates improved liquid-phase oxidation reactions with reduced<br>
formation of impurities.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a more effective and<br>
economical system for producing pure terephthalic acid (PTA) via liquid-phase<br>
oxidation of para-xylene to produce crude terephthalic acid (CTA) and<br>
subsequently, purifying the CTA to PTA.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a bubble column reactor<br>
for oxidizing para-xylene and producing a CTA product capable of being<br>
purified without requiring heat-promoted dissolution of the CTA in water,<br>
hydrogenation of the dissolved CTA, and/or multi-step crystallization of the<br>
hydrogenated PTA.<br>
It should be noted that the scope of the present invention, as defined in<br>
the appended claims, is not limited to processes or apparatuses capable of<br>
realizing all of the objects listed above. Rather, the scope of the claimed<br>
invention may encompass a variety of systems that do not accomplish all or any<br>
of the above-listed objects. Additional objects and advantages of the present<br>
invention will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art upon reviewing the<br>
following detailed description and associated drawings.<br>

at least a portion of the feed stream is enters the reaction zone at an inlet<br>
superficial velocity of at least about 5 meters per second; and (c) oxidizing at<br>
least a portion of the para-xylene in a liquid phase of a multi-phase reaction<br>
medium contained in the reaction zone to thereby produce crude terephmalic<br>
acid, wherein the reaction medium has a maximum height (H), a maximum<br>

liquid-phase feed stream comprising para-xylene into the reaction zone via a<br>
plurality of feed openings, wherein the reaction zone has a maximum diameter<br>
(D), wherein at least two of the feed openings are vertically spaced from one<br>

enters the reaction zone at an inlet superficial velocity of at least about 5 meters<br>
per second, wherein at least a portion of the reaction zone is defined by one or<br>
more upright sidewalls of the reactor, wherein at least about 25 weight percent<br>

opposite ends spaced from one another by the maximum length (L). A majority<br>
of the cumulative open area defined by all of the gas openings is located within<br>
about 0.25D of the first end of the reaction zone.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
One embodiment of the present invention concerns the liquid-phase<br>
partial oxidation of an oxidizable compound. Such oxidation is preferably<br>
carried out in the liquid phase of a multi-phase reaction medium contained in<br>
one or more agitated reactors. Suitable agitated reactors include, for example,<br>
bubble-agitated reactors (e.g., bubble column reactors), mechanically agitated<br>
reactors (e.g., continuous stirred tank reactors), and flow agitated reactors (e.g.,<br>
jet reactors). In one embodiment of the invention, the liquid-phase oxidation is<br>
carried out in a single bubble column reactor.<br>
As used herein, the term "bubble column reactor" shall denote a reactor<br>
for facilitating chemical reactions in a multi-phase reaction medium, wherein<br>
agitation of the reaction medium is provided primarily by the upward movement<br>
of gas bubbles through the reaction medium. As used herein, the term<br>
"agitation" shall denote work dissipated into the reaction medium causing fluid<br>
flow and/or mixing. As used herein, the terms "majority", "primarily", and<br>
"predominately" shall mean more than 50 percent. As used herein, the term<br>
"mechanical agitation" shall denote agitation of the reaction medium caused by<br>
physical movement of a rigid or flexible element(s) against or within the<br>
reaction medium. For example, mechanical agitation can be provided by<br>
rotation, oscillation, and/or vibration of internal stirrers, paddles, vibrators, or<br>
acoustical diaphragms located in the reaction medium. As used herein, the term<br>
"flow agitation" shall denote agitation of the reaction medium caused by high<br>
velocity injection and/or recirculation of one or more fluids in the reaction<br>
medium. For example, flow agitation can be provided by nozzles, ejectors,<br>
and/or eductors.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, less than about 40<br>
percent of the agitation of the reaction medium in the bubble column reactor<br>
during oxidation is provided by mechanical and/or flow agitation, more<br>
preferably less than about 20 percent of the agitation is provided by mechanical<br>
and/or flow agitation, and most preferably less than 5 percent of the agitation is<br>
provided by mechanical and/or flow agitation. Preferably, the amount of<br>
mechanical and/or flow agitation imparted to the multi-phase reaction medium<br>
during oxidation is less than about 3 kilowatts per cubic meter of the reaction<br>
medium, more preferably less than about 2 kilowatts per cubic meter, and most<br>
preferably less than 1 kilowatt per cubic meter.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 1, a preferred bubble column reactor 20 is<br>
illustrated as comprising a vessel shell 22 having of a reaction section 24 and a<br>
disengagement section 26. Reaction section 24 defines an internal reaction zone<br>
28, while disengagement section 26 defines an internal disengagement zone 30.<br>
A predominately liquid-phase feed stream is introduced into reaction zone 28<br>
via feed inlets 32a,b,c,d. A predominately gas-phase oxidant stream is<br>
introduced into reaction zone 28 via an oxidant sparger 34 located in the lower<br>
portion of reaction zone 28. The liquid-phase feed stream and gas-phase<br>
oxidant stream cooperatively form a multi-phase reaction medium 36 within<br>
reaction zone 28. Multi-phase reaction medium 36 comprises a liquid phase<br>
and a gas phase. More preferably, multiphase reaction medium 36 comprises a<br>
three-phase medium having solid-phase, liquid-phase, and gas-phase<br>
components. The solid-phase component of the reaction medium 36 preferably<br>

out in the liquid phase of reaction medium 36. Bubble column reactor 20<br>
includes a slurry outlet 38 located near the bottom of reaction zone 28 and a gas<br>
outlet 40 located near the top of disengagement zone 30. A slurry effluent<br>
comprising liquid-phase and solid-phase components of reaction medium 36 is<br>
withdrawn from reaction zone 28 via slurry outlet 38, while a predominantly<br>
gaseous effluent is withdrawn from disengagement zone 30 via gas outlet 40.<br>
The liquid-phase feed stream introduced into bubble column reactor 20<br>
via feed inlets 32a,b,c,d preferably comprises an oxidizable compound, a<br>
solvent, and a catalyst system.<br>
The oxidizable compound present in the liquid-phase feed stream<br>
preferably comprises at least one hydrocarbyl group. More preferably, the<br>

If the oxidizable compound present in the liquid-phase feed stream is a<br>
normally-solid compound (i.e., is a solid at standard temperature and pressure),<br>
it is preferred for the oxidizable compound to be substantially dissolved in the<br>
solvent when introduced into reaction zone 28. It is preferred for the boiling<br>
point of the oxidizable compound at atmospheric pressure to be at least about<br>
50°C. More preferably, the boiling point of the oxidizable compound is in the<br>
range of from about 80 to about 400°C, and most preferably in the range of<br>
from 125 to 155°C. The amount of oxidizable compound present in the liquidphase<br>
feed is preferably in the range of from about 2 to about 40 weight percent,<br>
more preferably in the range of from about 4 to about 20 weight percent, and<br>
most preferably in the range of from 6 to 15 weight percent.<br>
It is now noted that the oxidizable compound present in the liquid-phase<br>
feed may comprise a combination of two or more different oxidizable<br>
chemicals. These two or more different chemical materials can be fed<br>
commingled in the liquid-phase feed stream or may be fed separately in<br>
multiple feed streams. For example, an oxidizable compound comprising paraxylene,<br>
meta-xylene, para-tolualdehyde, para-toluic acid, and acetaldehyde may<br>
be fed to the reactor via a single inlet or multiple separate inlets.<br>
The solvent present in the liquid-phase feed stream preferably comprises<br>
an acid component and a water component. The solvent is preferably present in<br>
the liquid-phase feed stream at a concentration in the range of from about 60 to<br>
about 98 weight percent, more preferably in the range of from about 80 to about<br>
96 weight percent, and most preferably in the range of from 85 to 94 weight<br>
percent. The acid component of the solvent is preferably primarily an organic<br>
low molecular weight monocarboxylic acid having 1-6 carbon atoms, more<br>
preferably 2 carbon atoms. Most preferably, the acid component of the solvent<br>
is primarily acetic acid. Preferably, the acid component makes up at least about<br>
weight percent of the solvent, more preferably at least about 80 weight<br>
percent of the solvent, and most preferably 85 to 98 weight percent of the<br>
solvent, with the balance being primarily water. The solvent introduced into<br>
bubble column reactor 20 can include small quantities of impurities such as, for<br>
example, para-tolualdehyde, terephthaldehyde, 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (4-<br>
CBA), benzoic acid, para-toluic acid, para-toluic aldehyde, alpha-bromo-paratoluic<br>
acid, isophthalic acid, phthalic acid, trimellitic acid, polyaromatics, and/or<br>
suspended particulate. It is preferred that the total amount of impurities in the<br>
solvent introduced into bubble column reactor 20 is less than about 3 weight<br>
percent.<br>
The catalyst system present in the liquid-phase feed stream is preferably<br>
a homogeneous, liquid-phase catalyst system capable of promoting oxidation<br>
(including partial oxidation) of the oxidizable compound. More preferably, the<br>
catalyst system comprises at least one multivalent transition metal. Still more<br>
preferably, the multivalent transition metal comprises cobalt. Even more<br>
preferably, the catalyst system comprises cobalt and bromine. Most preferably,<br>
the catalyst system comprises cobalt, bromine, and manganese.<br>
When cobalt is present in the catalyst system, it is preferred for the<br>
amount of cobalt present in the liquid-phase feed stream to be such that the<br>
concentration of cobalt in the liquid phase of reaction medium 36 is maintained<br>
in the range of from about 300 to about 6,000 parts per million by weight<br>
(ppmw), more preferably in the range of from about 700 to about 4,200 ppmw,<br>
and most preferably in the range of from 1,200 to 3,000 ppmw. When bromine<br>
is present in the catalyst system, it is preferred for the amount of bromine<br>
present in the liquid-phase feed stream to be such that the concentration of<br>
bromine in the liquid phase of reaction medium 36 is maintained in the range of<br>
from about 300 to about 5,000 ppmw, more preferably in the range of from<br>
about 600 to about 4,000 ppmw, and most preferably in the range of from 900<br>
to 3,000 ppmw. When manganese is present in the catalyst system, it is<br>
preferred for the amount of manganese present in the liquid-phase feed stream<br>
to be such that the concentration of manganese in the liquid phase of reaction<br>
medium 36 is maintained in the range of from about 20 to about 1,000 ppmw,<br>
more preferably in the range of from about 40 to about 500 ppmw, most<br>
preferably in the range of from 50 to 200 ppmw.<br>
The concentrations of the cobalt, bromine, and/or manganese in the<br>
liquid phase of reaction medium 36, provided above, are expressed on a timeaveraged<br>
and volume-averaged basis. As used herein, the term "time-averaged"<br>
shall denote an average of at least 10 measurements taken equally over a<br>
continuous period of at least 100 seconds. As used herein, the term "volumeaveraged"<br>
shall denote an average of at least 10 measurements taken at uniform<br>
3-dimensional spacing throughout a certain volume.<br>
The weight ratio of cobalt to bromine (Co:Br) in the catalyst system<br>
introduced into reaction zone 28 is preferably in the range of from about 0.25:1<br>
to about 4:1, more preferably in the range of from about 0.5:1 to about 3:1, and<br>
most preferably in the range of from 0.75:1 to 2:1. The weight ratio of cobalt to<br>
manganese (Co:Mn) in the catalyst system introduced into reaction zone 28 is<br>
preferably in the range of from about 0.3:1 to about 40:1, more preferably in the<br>
range of from about 5:1 to about 30:1, and most preferably in the range of from<br>
10:1 to 25:1.<br>
The liquid-phase feed stream introduced into bubble column reactor 20<br>
can include small quantities of impurities such as, for example, toluene,<br>
ethylbenzene, para-tolualdehyde, terephthaldehyde, 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (4-<br>
CBA), benzoic acid, para-toluic acid, para-toluic aldehyde, alpha bromo paratoluic<br>
acid, isophthalic acid, phthalic acid, trimellitic acid, polyaromatics, and/or<br>
suspended particulate. When bubble column reactor 20 is employed for the<br>
production of terephthalic acid, meta-xylene and ortho-xylene are also<br>
considered impurities. It is preferred that the total amount of impurities in the<br>
liquid-phase feed stream introduced into bubble column reactor 20 is less than<br>
about 3 weight percent.<br>
Although FIG. 1 illustrates an embodiment where the oxidizable<br>
compound, the solvent, and the catalyst system are mixed together and<br>
introduced into bubble column reactor 20 as a single feed stream, in an<br>
alternative embodiment of the present invention, the oxidizable compound, the<br>
solvent, and the catalyst can be separately introduced into bubble column<br>
reactor 20. For example, it is possible to feed a pure para-xylene stream into<br>
bubble column reactor 20 via an inlet separate from the solvent and catalyst<br>
inlet(s).<br>
The predominately gas-phase oxidant stream introduced into bubble<br>
column reactor 20 via oxidant sparger 34 comprises molecular oxygen (02).<br>
Preferably, the oxidant stream comprises in the range of from about 5 to about<br>
40 mole percent molecular oxygen, more preferably in the range of from about<br>
15 to about 30 mole percent molecular oxygen, and most preferably in the range<br>
of from 18 to 24 mole percent molecular oxygen. It is preferred for the balance<br>
of the oxidant stream to be comprised primarily of a gas or gasses, such as<br>
nitrogen, that are inert to oxidation. More preferably, the oxidant stream<br>
consists essentially of molecular oxygen and nitrogen. Most preferably, the<br>
oxidant stream is dry air that comprises about 21 mole percent molecular<br>
oxygen and about 78 to about 81 mole percent nitrogen. In an alternative<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the oxidant stream can comprise<br>
substantially pure oxygen.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 1, bubble column reactor 20 is preferably<br>
equipped with a reflux distributor 42 positioned above an upper surface 44 of<br>
reaction medium 36. Reflux distributor 42 is operable to introduce droplets of a<br>
predominately liquid-phase reflux stream into disengagement zone 30 by any<br>
means of droplet formation known in the art. More preferably, reflux<br>
distributor 42 produces a spray of droplets directed downwardly towards upper<br>
surface 44 of reaction medium 36. Preferably, this downward spray of droplets<br>
affects (i.e., engages and influences) at least about 50 percent of the maximum<br>
horizontal cross-sectional area of disengagement zone 30. More preferably, the<br>
spray of droplets affects at least about 75 percent of the maximum horizontal<br>
cross-sectional area of disengagement zone 30. Most preferably, the spray of<br>
droplets affects at least 90 percent of the maximum horizontal cross-sectional<br>
area of disengagement zone 30. This downward liquid reflux spray can help<br>
prevent foaming at or above upper surface 44 of reaction medium 36 and can<br>
also aid in the disengagement of any liquid or slurry droplets entrained in the<br>
upwardly moving gas that flows towards gas outlet 40. Further, the liquid<br>
reflux may serve to reduce the amount of particulates and potentially<br>
precipitating compounds (e.g., dissolved benzoic acid, para-toluic acid, 4-CBA,<br>
terephthalic acid, and catalyst metal salts) exiting in the gaseous effluent<br>
withdrawn from disengagement zone 30 via gas outlet 40. In addition, the<br>
introduction of reflux droplets into disengagement zone 30 can, by a distillation<br>
action, be used to adjust the composition of the gaseous effluent withdrawn via<br>
gas outlet 40.<br>
The liquid reflux stream introduced into bubble column reactor 20 via<br>
reflux distributor 42 preferably has about the same composition as the solvent<br>
component of the liquid-phase feed stream introduced into bubble column<br>
reactor 20 via feed inlets 32a,b,c,d. Thus, it is preferred for the liquid reflux<br>
stream to comprise an acid component and water. The acid component of the<br>
reflux stream is preferably a low molecular weight organic monocarboxylic acid<br>
having 1-6 carbon atoms, more preferably 2 carbon atoms. Most preferably, the<br>
acid component of the reflux stream is acetic acid. Preferably, the acid<br>
component makes up at least about 75 weight percent of the reflux stream, more<br>
preferably at least about 80 weight percent of the reflux stream, and most<br>
preferably 85 to 98 weight percent of the reflux stream, with the balance being<br>
water. Because the reflux stream typically has substantially the same<br>
composition as the solvent in the liquid-phase feed stream, when this<br>
description refers to the "total solvent" introduced into the reactor, such "total<br>
solvent" shall include both the reflux stream and the solvent portion of the feed<br>
stream.<br>
During liquid-phase oxidation in bubble column reactor 20, it is<br>
preferred for the feed, oxidant, and reflux streams to be substantially<br>
continuously introduced into reaction zone 28, while the gas and slurry effluent<br>
streams are substantially continuously withdrawn from reaction zone 28. As<br>
used herein, the term "substantially continuously" shall mean for a period of at<br>
least 10 hours interrupted by less than 10 minutes. During oxidation, it is<br>
preferred for the oxidizable compound (e.g., para-xylene) to be substantially<br>
continuously introduced into reaction zone 28 at a rate of at least about 8,000<br>
kilograms per hour, more preferably at a rate in the range of from about 13,000<br>
to about 80,000 kilograms per hour, still more preferably in the range of from<br>
about 18,000 to about 50,000 kilograms per hour, and most preferably in the<br>
range of from 22,000 to 30,000 kilograms per hour. Although it is generally<br>
preferred for the flow rates of the incoming feed, oxidant, and reflux streams to<br>
be substantially steady, it is now noted that one embodiment of the presenting<br>
invention contemplates pulsing the incoming feed, oxidant, and/or reflux stream<br>
in order to improve mixing and mass transfer. When the incoming feed,<br>
oxidant, and/or reflux stream are introduced in a pulsed fashion, it is preferred<br>
for their flow rates to vary within about 0 to about 500 percent of the steadystate<br>
flow rates recited herein, more preferably within about 30 to about 200<br>
percent of the steady-state flow rates recited herein, and most preferably within<br>
80 to 120 percent of the steady-state flow rates recited herein.<br>
The average space-time rate of reaction (STR) in bubble column<br>
oxidation reactor 20 is defined as the mass of the oxidizable compound fed per<br>
unit volume of reaction medium 36 per unit time (e.g., kilograms of para-xylene<br>
fed per cubic meter per hour). In conventional usage, the amount of oxidizable<br>
compound not converted to product would typically be subtracted from the<br>
amount of oxidizable compound in the feed stream before calculating the STR.<br>
However, conversions and yields are typically high for many of the oxidizable<br>
compounds preferred herein (e.g., para-xylene), and it is convenient to define<br>
the term herein as stated above. For reasons of capital cost and operating<br>
inventory, among others, it is generally preferred that the reaction be conducted<br>
with a high STR. However, conducting the reaction at increasingly higher STR<br>
may affect the quality or yield of the partial oxidation. Bubble column reactor<br>
20 is particularly useful when the STR of the oxidizable compound (e.g., paraxylene)<br>
is in the range of from about 25 kilograms per cubic meter per hour to<br>
about 400 kilograms per cubic meter per hour, more preferably in the range of<br>
from about 30 kilograms per cubic meter per hour to about 250 kilograms per<br>
cubic meter per hour, still more preferably from about 35 kilograms per cubic<br>
meter per hour to about 150 kilograms per cubic meter per hour, and most<br>
preferably in the range of from 40 kilograms per cubic meter per hour to 100<br>
kilograms per cubic meter per hour.<br>
The oxygen-STR in bubble column oxidation reactor 20 is defined as the<br>
weight of molecular oxygen consumed per unit volume of reaction medium 36<br>
per unit time (e.g., kilograms of molecular oxygen consumed per cubic meter<br>
per hour). For reasons of capital cost and oxidative consumption of solvent,<br>
among others, it is generally preferred that the reaction be conducted with a<br>
high oxygen-STR. However, conducting the reaction at increasingly higher<br>
oxygen-STR eventually reduces the quality or yield of the partial oxidation.<br>
Without being bound by theory, it appears that this possibly relates to the<br>
transfer rate of molecular oxygen from the gas phase into the liquid at the<br>
interfacial surface area and thence into the bulk liquid. Too high an oxygen-<br>
STR possibly leads to too low a dissolved oxygen content in the bulk liquid<br>
phase of the reaction medium.<br>
The global-average-oxygen-STR is defined herein as the weight of all<br>
oxygen consumed in the entire volume of reaction medium 36 per unit time<br>
 (e.g., kilograms of molecular oxygen consumed per cubic meter per hour).<br>
Bubble column reactor 20 is particularly useful when the global-averageoxygen-<br>
STR is in the range of from about 25 kilograms per cubic meter per<br>
hour to about 400 kilograms per cubic meter per hour, more preferably in the<br>
range of from about 30 kilograms per cubic meter per hour to about 250<br>
kilograms per cubic meter per hour, still more preferably from about 35<br>
kilograms per cubic meter per hour to about 150 kilograms per cubic meter per<br>
hour, and most preferably in the range of from 40 kilograms per cubic meter per<br>
hour to 100 kilograms per cubic meter per hour.<br>
During oxidation in bubble column reactor 20, it is preferred for the<br>
ratio of the mass flow rate of the total solvent (from both the feed and reflux<br>
streams) to the mass flow rate of the oxidizable compound entering reaction<br>
zone 28 to be maintained in the range of from about 2:1 to about 50:1, more<br>
preferably in the range of from about 5:1 to about 40:1, and most preferably in<br>
the range of from 7.5:1 to 25:1. Preferably, the ratio of the mass flow rate of<br>
solvent introduced as part of the feed stream to the mass flow rate of solvent<br>
introduced as part of the reflux stream is maintained in the range of from about<br>
0.5:1 to no reflux stream flow whatsoever, more preferably in the range of from<br>
about 0.5:1 to about 4:1, still more preferably in the range of from about 1:1 to<br>
about 2:1, and most preferably in the range of from 1.25:1 to 1.5:1.<br>
During liquid-phase oxidation in bubble column reactor 20, it is<br>
preferred for the oxidant stream to be introduced into bubble column reactor 20<br>
in an amount that provides molecular oxygen somewhat exceeding the<br>
stoichiometric oxygen demand. The amount of excess molecular oxygen<br>
required for best results with a particular oxidizable compound affects the<br>
overall economics of the liquid-phase oxidation. During liquid-phase oxidation<br>
in bubble column reactor 20, it is preferred that the ratio of the mass flow rate of<br>
the oxidant stream to the mass flow rate of the oxidizable organic compound<br>
(e.g., para-xylene) entering reactor 20 is maintained in the range of from about<br>
0.5:1 to about 20:1, more preferably in the range of from about 1:1 to about<br>
10:1, and most preferably in the range of from 2:1 to 6:1.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 1, the feed, oxidant, and reflux streams<br>
introduced into bubble column reactor 20 cooperatively form at least a portion<br>
of multi-phase reaction medium 36. Reaction medium 36 is preferably a threephase<br>
medium comprising a solid phase, a liquid phase, and a gas phase. As<br>
mentioned above, oxidation of the oxidizable compound (e.g., para-xylene)<br>
takes place predominately in the liquid phase of reaction medium 36. Thus, the<br>
liquid phase of reaction medium 36 comprises dissolved oxygen and the<br>
oxidizable compound. The exothermic nature of the oxidation reaction that<br>
takes place in bubble column reactor 20 causes a portion of the solvent (e.g.,<br>
acetic acid and water) introduced via feed inlets 32a,b,c,d to boil/vaporize.<br>
Thus, the gas phase of reaction medium 36 in reactor 20 is formed primarily of<br>
vaporized solvent and an undissolved, unreacted portion of the oxidant stream.<br>
Certain prior art oxidation reactors employ heat exchange tubes/fins to heat or<br>
cool the reaction medium. However, such heat exchange structures may be<br>
undesirable in the inventive reactor and process described herein. Thus, it is<br>
preferred for bubble column reactor 20 to include substantially no surfaces that<br>
contact reaction medium 36 and exhibit a time-averaged heat flux greater than<br>
30,000 watts per meter squared.<br>
The concentration of dissolved oxygen in the liquid phase of reaction<br>
medium 36 is a dynamic balance between the rate of mass transfer from the gas<br>
phase and the rate of reactive consumption within the liquid phase (i.e. it is not<br>
set simply by the partial pressure of molecular oxygen in the supplying gas<br>
phase, though this is one factor in the supply rate of dissolved oxygen and it<br>
does affect the limiting upper concentration of dissolved oxygen). The amount<br>
of dissolved oxygen varies locally, being higher near bubble interfaces.<br>
Globally, the amount of dissolved oxygen depends on the balance of supply and<br>
demand factors in different regions of reaction medium 36. Temporally, the<br>
amount of dissolved oxygen depends on the uniformity of gas and liquid mixing<br>
relative to chemical consumption rates, hi designing to match appropriately the<br>
supply of and demand for dissolved oxygen in the liquid phase of reaction<br>
medium 36, it is preferred for the time-averaged and volume-averaged oxygen<br>
concentration in the liquid phase of reaction medium 36 to be maintained above<br>
about 1 ppm molar, more preferably in the range from about 4 to about 1,000<br>
ppm molar, still more preferably in the range from about 8 to about 500 ppm<br>
molar, and most preferably in the range from 12 to 120 ppm molar.<br>
The liquid-phase oxidation reaction carried out in bubble column reactor<br>
20 is preferably a precipitating reaction that generates solids. More preferably,<br>
the liquid-phase oxidation carried out in bubble column reactor 20 causes at<br>
least about 10 weight percent of the oxidizable compound (e.g., para-xylene)<br>
introduced into reaction zone 28 to form a solid compound (e.g., crude<br>
terephthalic acid particles) in reaction medium 36. Still more preferably, the<br>
liquid-phase oxidation causes at least about 50 weight percent of the oxidizable<br>
compound to form a solid compound in reaction medium 36. Most preferably,<br>
the liquid-phase oxidation causes at least 90 weight percent of the oxidizable<br>
compound to form a solid compound in reaction medium 36. It is preferred for<br>
the total amount of solids in reaction medium 36 to be greater than about 3<br>
percent by weight on a time-averaged and volume-averaged basis. More<br>
preferably, the total amount of solids in reaction medium 36 is maintained in the<br>
range of from about 5 to about 40 weight percent, still more preferably in the<br>
range of from about 10 to about 35 weight percent, and most preferably in the<br>
range of from 15 to 30 weight percent. It is preferred for a substantial portion<br>
of the oxidation product (e.g., terephthalic acid) produced in bubble column<br>
reactor 20 to be present in reaction medium 36 as solids, as opposed to<br>
remaining dissolved in the liquid phase of reaction medium 36. The amount of<br>
the solid phase oxidation product present in reaction medium 36 is preferably at<br>
least about 25 percent by weight of the total oxidation product (solid and liquid<br>
phase) in reaction medium 36, more preferably at least about 75 percent by<br>
weight of the total oxidation product in reaction medium 36, and most<br>
preferably at least 95 percent by weight of the total oxidation product in<br>
reaction medium 36. The numerical ranges provided above for the amount of<br>
solids in reaction medium 36 apply to substantially steady-state operation of<br>
bubble column 20 over a substantially continuous period of time, not to start-up,<br>
shut-down, or sub-optimal operation of bubble column reactor 20. The amount<br>
of solids in reaction medium 36 is determined by a gravimetric method. In this<br>
gravimetric method, a representative portion of slurry is withdrawn from the<br>
reaction medium and weighed. At conditions that effectively maintain the<br>
overall solid-liquid partitioning present within the reaction medium, free liquid<br>
is removed from the solids portion by sedimentation or filtration, effectively<br>
without loss of precipitated solids and with less than about 10 percent of the<br>
initial liquid mass remaining with the portion of solids. The remaining liquid on<br>
the solids is evaporated to dryness, effectively without sublimation of solids.<br>
The remaining portion of solids is weighed. The ratio of the weight of the<br>
portion of solids to the weight of the original portion of slurry is the fraction of<br>
solids, typically expressed as a percentage.<br>
The precipitating reaction carried out in bubble column reactor 20 can<br>
cause fouling (i.e., solids build-up) on the surface of certain rigid structures that<br>
contact reaction medium 36. Thus, in one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
it is preferred for bubble column reactor 20 to include substantially no internal<br>
heat exchange, stirring, or baffling structures in reaction zone 28 because such<br>
structures would be prone to fouling. If internal structures are present in<br>
reaction zone 28, it is desirable to avoid internal structures having outer surfaces<br>
that include a significant amount of upwardly facing planar surface area because<br>
such upwardly facing planar surfaces would be highly prone to fouling. Thus, if<br>
any internal structures are present in reaction zone 28, it is preferred for less<br>
than about 20 percent of the total upwardly facing exposed outer surface area of<br>
such internal structures to be formed by substantially planar surfaces inclined<br>
less than about 15 degrees from horizontal.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 1, the physical configuration of bubble column<br>
reactor 20 helps provide for optimized oxidation of the oxidizable compound<br>
(e.g., para-xylene) with minimal impurity generation. It is preferred for<br>
elongated reaction section 24 of vessel shell 22 to include a substantially<br>
cylindrical main body 46 and a lower head 48. The upper end of reaction zone<br>
28 is defined by a horizontal plane 50 extending across the top of cylindrical<br>
main body 46. A lower end 52 of reaction zone 28 is defined by the lowest<br>
internal surface of lower head 48. Typically, lower end 52 of reaction zone 28<br>
is located proximate the opening for slurry outlet 38. Thus, elongated reaction<br>
zone 28 defined within bubble column reactor 20 has a maximum length "L"<br>
measured from the top end 50 to the bottom end 52 of reaction zone 28 along<br>
the axis of elongation of cylindrical main body 46. The length "L" of reaction<br>
zone 28 is preferably in the range of from about 10 to about 100 meters, more<br>
preferably in the range of from about 20 to about 75 meters, and most<br>
preferably in the range of from 25 to 50 meters. Reaction zone 28 has a<br>
maximum diameter (width) "D" that is typically equal to the maximum internal<br>
diameter of cylindrical main body 46. The maximum diameter "D" of reaction<br>
zone 28 is preferably in the range of from about 1 to about 12 meters, more<br>
preferably in the range of from about 2 to about 10 meters, still more preferably<br>
in the range of from about 3.1 to about 9 meters, and most preferably in the<br>
range of from 4 to 8 meters. In a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, reaction zone 28 has a length-to-diameter "L:D" ratio in the range of<br>
from about 6:1 to about 30:1. Still more preferably, reaction zone 28 has an<br>
L:D ratio in the range of from about 8:1 to about 20:1. Most preferably,<br>
reaction zone 28 has an L:D ratio in the range of from 9:1 to 15:1.<br>
As discussed above, reaction zone 28 of bubble column reactor 20<br>
receives multi-phase reaction medium 36. Reaction medium 36 has a bottom<br>
end coincident with lower end 52 of reaction zone 28 and a top end located at<br>
upper surface 44. Upper surface 44 of reaction medium 36 is defined along a<br>
horizontal plane that cuts through reaction zone 28 at a vertical location where<br>
the contents of reaction zone 28 transitions from a gas-phase-continuous state to<br>
a liquid-phase-continuous state. Upper surface 44 is preferably positioned at the<br>
vertical location where the local time-averaged gas hold-up of a thin horizontal<br>
slice of the contents of reaction zone 28 is 0.9.<br>
Reaction medium 36 has a maximum height "H" measured between its<br>
upper and lower ends. The maximum width "W" of reaction medium 36 is<br>
typically equal to the maximum diameter "D" of cylindrical main body 46.<br>
During liquid-phase oxidation in bubble column reactor 20, it is preferred that H<br>
is maintained at about 60 to about 120 percent of L, more preferably about 80 to<br>
about 110 percent of L, and most preferably 85 to 100 percent of L. In a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention, reaction medium 36 has a<br>
height-to-width "H:W" ratio greater than about 3:1. More preferably, reaction<br>
medium 36 has an H:W ratio in the range of from about 7:1 to about 25:1. Still<br>
more preferably, reaction medium 36 has an H:W ratio in the range of from<br>
about 8:1 to about 20:1. Most preferably, reaction medium 36 has an H:W ratio<br>
in the range of from 9:1 to 15:1. In one embodiment of the invention, L=H and<br>
D-W so that various dimensions or ratios provide herein for L and D also apply<br>
to H and W, and vice-versa.<br>
The relatively high L:D and H:W ratios provided in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the invention can contribute to several important advantages of<br>
the inventive system. As discussed in further detail below, it has been<br>
discovered that higher L:D and H:W ratios, as well as certain other features<br>
discussed below, can promote beneficial vertical gradients in the concentrations<br>
of molecular oxygen and/or the oxidizable compound (e.g., para-xylene) in<br>
reaction medium 36. Contrary to conventional wisdom, which would favor a<br>
well-mixed reaction medium with relatively uniform concentrations throughout,<br>
it has been discovered that the vertical staging of the oxygen and/or the<br>
oxidizable compound concentrations facilitates a more effective and economical<br>
oxidation reaction. Minimizing the oxygen and oxidizable compound<br>
concentrations near the top of reaction medium 36 can help avoid loss of<br>
unreacted oxygen and unreacted oxidizable compound through upper gas outlet<br>
40. However, if the concentrations of oxidizable compound and unreacted<br>
oxygen are low throughout reaction medium 36, then the rate and/or selectivity<br>
of oxidation are reduced. Thus, it is preferred for the concentrations of<br>
molecular oxygen and/or the oxidizable compound to be significantly higher<br>
near the bottom of reaction medium 36 than near the top of reaction medium 36.<br>
In addition, high L:D and H:W ratios cause the pressure at the bottom of<br>
reaction medium 36 to be substantially greater than the pressure at the top of<br>
reaction medium 36. This vertical pressure gradient is a result of the height and<br>
density of reaction medium 36. One advantage of this vertical pressure gradient<br>
is that the elevated pressure at the bottom of the vessel drives more oxygen<br>
solubility and mass transfer than would otherwise be achievable at comparable<br>
temperatures and overhead pressures in shallow reactors. Thus, the oxidation<br>
reaction can be carried out at lower temperatures than would be required in a<br>
shallower vessel. When bubble column reactor 20 is used for the partial<br>
oxidation of para-xylene to crude terephthalic acid (CTA), the ability to operate<br>
at lower reaction temperatures with the same or better oxygen mass transfer<br>
rates has a number of advantages. For example, low temperature oxidation of<br>
para-xylene reduces the amount of solvent burned during the reaction. As<br>
discussed in further detail below, low temperature oxidation also favors the<br>
formation of small, high surface area, loosely bound, easily dissolved CTA<br>
particles, which can be subjected to more economical purification techniques<br>
than the large, low surface area, dense CTA particles produced by conventional<br>
high temperature oxidation processes.<br>
During oxidation in reactor 20, it is preferred for the time-averaged and<br>
volume-averaged temperature of reaction medium 36 to be maintained in the<br>
range of from about 125 to about 200°C, more preferably in the range of from<br>
about 140 to about 180°C, and most preferably in the range of from 150 to<br>
170°C. The overhead pressure above reaction medium 36 is preferably<br>
maintained in the range of from about 1 to about 20 bar gauge (barg), more<br>
preferably in the range of from about 2 to about 12 barg, and most preferably in<br>
the range of from 4 to 8 barg. Preferably, the pressure difference between the<br>
top of reaction medium 36 and the bottom of reaction medium 36 is in the range<br>
of from about 0.4 to about 5 bar, more preferably the pressure difference is in<br>
the range of from about 0.7 to about 3 bars, and most preferably the pressure<br>
difference is 1 to 2 bar. Although it is generally preferred for the overhead<br>
pressure above reaction medium 36 to be maintained at a relatively constant<br>
value, one embodiment of the present invention contemplates pulsing the<br>
overhead pressure to facilitate improved mixing and/or mass transfer in reaction<br>
medium 36. When the overhead pressure is pulsed, it is preferred for the pulsed<br>
pressures to range between about 60 to about 140 percent of the steady-state<br>
overhead pressure recited herein, more preferably between about 85 and about<br>
115 percent of the steady-state overhead pressure recited herein, and most<br>
preferably between 95 and 105 percent of the steady-state overhead pressure<br>
recited herein.<br>
A further advantage of the high L:D ratio of reaction zone 28 is that it<br>
can contribute to an increase in the average superficial velocity of reaction<br>
medium 36. The term "superficial velocity" and "superficial gas velocity", as<br>
used herein with reference to reaction medium 36, shall denote the volumetric<br>
flow rate of the gas phase of reaction medium 36 at an elevation in the reactor<br>
divided by the horizontal cross-sectional area of the reactor at that elevation.<br>
The increased superficial velocity provided by the high L:D ratio of reaction<br>
zone 28 can promote local mixing and increase the gas hold-up of reaction<br>
medium 36. The time-averaged superficial velocities of reaction medium 36 at<br>
one-quarter height, half height, and/or three-quarter height of reaction medium<br>
36 are preferably greater than about 0.3 meters per second, more preferably in<br>
the range of from about 0.8 to about 5 meters per second, still more preferably<br>
in the range of from about 0.9 to about 4 meters per second, and most preferably<br>
in the range of from 1 to 3 meters per second.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 1, disengagement section 26 of bubble column<br>
reactor 20 is simply a widened portion of vessel shell 22 located immediately<br>
above reaction section 24. Disengagement section 26 reduces the velocity of<br>
the upwardly-flowing gas phase in bubble column reactor 20 as the gas phase<br>
rises above the upper surface 44 of reaction medium 36 and approaches gas<br>
outlet 40. This reduction in the upward velocity of the gas phase helps facilitate<br>
removal of entrained liquids and/or solids in the upwardly flowing gas phase<br>
and thereby reduces undesirable loss of certain components present in the liquid<br>
phase of reaction medium 36.<br>
Disengagement section 26 preferably includes a generally frustoconical<br>
transition wall 54, a generally cylindrical broad sidewall 56, and an upper head<br>
58. The narrow lower end of transition wall 54 is coupled to the top of<br>
cylindrical main body 46 of reaction section 24. The wide upper end of<br>
transition wall 54 is coupled to the bottom of broad sidewall 56. It is preferred<br>
for transition wall 54 to extend upwardly and outwardly from its narrow lower<br>
end at an angle in the range of from about 10 to about 70 degrees from vertical,<br>
more preferably in the range of about 15 to about 50 degrees from vertical, and<br>
most preferably in the range of from 15 to 45 degrees from vertical. Broad<br>
sidewall 56 has a maximum diameter "X" that is generally greater than the<br>
maximum diameter "D" of reaction section 24, though when the upper portion<br>
of reaction section 24 has a smaller diameter than the overall maximum<br>
diameter of reaction section 24, then X may actually be smaller than D. In a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention, the ratio of the diameter of<br>
broad sidewall 56 to the maximum diameter of reaction section 24 "X:D" is in<br>
the range of from about 0.8:1 to about 4:1, most preferably in the range of from<br>
1.1:1 to 2:1. Upper head 58 is coupled to the top of broad sidewall 56. Upper<br>
head 58 is preferably a generally elliptical head member defining a central<br>
opening that permits gas to escape disengagement zone 30 via gas outlet 40.<br>
Alternatively, upper head 58 may be of any shape, including conical.<br>
Disengagement zone 30 has a maximum height "Y" measured from the top 50<br>
of reaction zone 28 to the upper most portion of disengagement zone 30. The<br>
ratio of the length of reaction zone 28 to the height of disengagement zone 30<br>
"L:Y" is preferably in the range of from about 2:1 to about 24:1, more<br>
preferably in the range of from about 3:1 to about 20:1, and most preferably in<br>
the range of from 4:1 to 16:1.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 1-5, the location and configuration of oxidant<br>
sparger 34 will now be discussed in greater detail. FIGS. 2 and 3 show that<br>
oxidant sparger 34 can include a ring member 60, a cross-member 62, and a pair<br>
of oxidant entry conduits 64a,b. Conveniently, these oxidant entry conduits<br>
64a,b can enter the vessel at an elevation above the ring member 60 and then<br>
turn downwards as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3. Alternatively, an oxidant entry<br>
conduit 64a,b may enter the vessel below the ring member 60 or on about the<br>
same horizontal plane as ring member 60. Each oxidant entry conduit 64a,b<br>
includes a first end coupled to a respective oxidant inlet 66a,b formed in the<br>
vessel shell 22 and a second end fluidly coupled to ring member 60. Ring<br>
member 60 is preferably formed of conduits, more preferably of a plurality of<br>
straight conduit sections, and most preferably a plurality of straight pipe<br>
sections, rigidly coupled to one another to form a tubular polygonal ring.<br>
Preferably, ring member 60 is formed of at least 3 straight pipe sections, more<br>
preferably 6 to 10 pipe sections, and most preferably 8 pipe sections.<br>
Accordingly, when ring member 60 is formed of 8 pipe sections, it has a<br>
generally octagonal configuration. Cross-member 62 is preferably formed of a<br>
substantially straight pipe section that is fluidly coupled to and extends<br>
diagonally between opposite pipe sections of ring member 60. The pipe section<br>
used for cross-member 62 preferably has substantially the same diameter as the<br>
pipe sections used to form ring member 60. It is preferred for the pipe sections<br>
that make up oxidant entry conduits 64a,b, ring member 60, and cross-member<br>
62 to have a nominal diameter greater than about 0.1 meter, more preferable in<br>
the range of from about 0.2 to about 2 meters, and most preferably in the range<br>
of from 0.25 to 1 meters. As perhaps best illustrated in FIG. 3, ring member 60<br>
and cross-member 62 each present a plurality of upper oxidant openings 68 for<br>
discharging the oxidant stream upwardly into reaction zone 28. As perhaps best<br>
illustrated in FIG. 4, ring member 60 and/or cross-member 62 can present one<br>
or more lower oxidant openings 70 for discharging the oxidant stream<br>
downwardly into reaction zone 28. Lower oxidant openings 70 can also be used<br>
to discharge liquids and/or solids that might intrude within ring member 60<br>
and/or cross-member 62. In order to prevent solids from building up inside<br>
oxidant sparger 34, a liquid stream can be continuously or periodically passed<br>
through sparger 34 to flush out any accumulated solids.<br>
Referring again to FIGS. 1-4, during oxidation in bubble column reactor<br>
20, oxidant streams are forced through oxidant inlets 66a,b and into oxidant<br>
entry conduits 64a,b, respectively. The oxidant streams are then transported via<br>
oxidant entry conduits 64a,b to ring member 60. Once the oxidant stream has<br>
entered ring member 60, the oxidant stream is distributed throughout the<br>
internal volumes of ring member 60 and cross-member 62. The oxidant stream<br>
is then forced out of oxidant sparger 34 and into reaction zone 28 via upper and<br>
lower oxidant openings 68,70 of ring member 60 and cross-member 62.<br>
The outlets of upper oxidant openings 68 are laterally spaced from one<br>
another and are positioned at substantially the same elevation in reaction zone<br>
28. Thus, the outlets of upper oxidant openings 68 are generally located along a<br>
substantially horizontal plane defined by the top of oxidant sparger 34. The<br>
outlets of lower oxidant openings 70 are laterally spaced from one another and<br>
are positioned at substantially the same elevation in reaction zone 28. Thus, the<br>
outlets of lower oxidant openings 70 are generally located along a substantially<br>
horizontal plane defined by the bottom of oxidant sparger 34.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, oxidant sparger 34 has at<br>
least about 20 upper oxidant openings 68 formed therein. More preferably,<br>
oxidant sparger 34 has in the range of from about 40 to about 800 upper oxidant<br>
openings formed therein. Most preferably, oxidant sparger 34 has in the range<br>
of from 60 to 400 upper oxidant openings 68 formed therein. Oxidant sparger<br>
34 preferably has at least about 1 lower oxidant opening 70 formed therein.<br>
More preferably, oxidant sparger 34 has in the range of from about 2 to about<br>
40 lower oxidant openings 70 formed therein. Most preferably, oxidant sparger<br>
34 has in the range of from 8 to 20 lower oxidant openings 70 formed therein.<br>
The ratio of the number of upper oxidant openings 68 to lower oxidant openings<br>
70 in oxidant sparger 34 is preferably in the range of from about 2:1 to about<br>
100:1, more preferably in the range of from about 5:1 to about 25:1, and most<br>
preferably in the range of from 8:1 to 15:1. The diameters of substantially all<br>
upper and lower oxidant openings 68,70 are preferably substantially the same,<br>
so that the ratio of the volumetric flow rate of the oxidant stream out of upper<br>
and lower openings 68,70 is substantially the same as the ratios, given above,<br>
for the relative number of upper and lower oxidant openings 68,70.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates the direction of oxidant discharge from upper and<br>
lower oxidant openings 68,70. With reference to upper oxidant openings 68, it<br>
is preferred for at least a portion of upper oxidant openings 68 to discharge the<br>
oxidant stream in at an angle "A" that is skewed from vertical. It is preferred<br>
for the percentage of upper oxidant openings 68 that are skewed from vertical<br>
by angle "A" to be in the range of from about 30 to about 90 percent, more<br>
preferably in the range of from about 50 to about 80 percent, still more<br>
preferably in the range of from 60 to 75 percent, and most preferably about 67<br>
percent. The angle "A" is preferably in the range of from about 5 to about 60<br>
degrees, more preferably in the range of from about 10 to about 45 degrees, and<br>
most preferably in the range of from 15 to 30 degrees. As for lower oxidant<br>
openings 70, it is preferred that substantially all of lower oxidant openings 70<br>
are located near the bottom-most portion of the ring member 60 and/or crossmember<br>
62. Thus, any liquids and/or solids that may have unintentionally<br>
entered oxidant sparger 34 can be readily discharged from oxidant sparger 34<br>
via lower oxidant openings 70. Preferably, lower oxidant openings 70<br>
discharge the oxidant stream downwardly at a substantially vertical angle. For<br>
purposes of this description, an upper oxidant opening can be any opening that<br>
discharges an oxidant stream in a generally upward direction (i.e., at an angle<br>
above horizontal), and a lower oxidant opening can be any opening that<br>
discharges an oxidant stream in a generally downward direction (i.e., at an angle<br>
below horizontal).<br>
In many conventional bubble column reactors containing a multi-phase<br>
reaction medium, substantially all of the reaction medium located below the<br>
oxidant sparger (or other mechanism for introducing the oxidant stream into the<br>
reaction zone) has a very low gas hold-up value. As known in the art, "gas<br>
hold-up" is simply the volume fraction of a multi-phase medium that is in the<br>
gaseous state. Zones of low gas hold-up in a medium can also be referred to as<br>
"unaerated" zones. In many conventional slurry bubble column reactors, a<br>
significant portion of the total volume of the reaction medium is located below<br>
the oxidant sparger (or other mechanism for introducing the oxidant stream into<br>
the reaction zone). Thus, a significant portion of the reaction medium present at<br>
the bottom of conventional bubble column reactors is unaerated.<br>
It has been discovered that minimizing the amount of unaerated zones in<br>
a reaction medium subjected to oxidization in a bubble column reactor can<br>
minimize the generation of certain types of undesirable impurities. Unaerated<br>
zones of a reaction medium contain relatively few oxidant bubbles. This low<br>
volume of oxidant bubbles reduces the amount of molecular oxygen available<br>
for dissolution into the liquid phase of the reaction medium. Thus, the liquid<br>
phase in an unaerated zone of the reaction medium has a relatively low<br>
concentration of molecular oxygen. These oxygen-starved, unaerated zones of<br>
the reaction medium have a tendency to promote undesirable side reactions,<br>
rather than the desired oxidation reaction. For example, when para-xylene is<br>
partially oxidized to form terephthalic acid, insufficient oxygen availability in<br>
the liquid phase of the reaction medium can cause the formation of undesirably<br>
high quantities of benzoic acid and coupled aromatic rings, notably including<br>
highly undesirable colored molecules known as fluorenones and<br>
anthraquinones.<br>
hi accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, liquidphase<br>
oxidation is carried out in a bubble column reactor configured and<br>
operated in a manner such that the volume fraction of the reaction medium with<br>
low gas hold-up values is minimized. This minimization of unaerated zones can<br>
be quantified by theoretically partitioning the entire volume of the reaction<br>
medium into 2,000 discrete horizontal slices of uniform volume. With the<br>
exception of the highest and lowest horizontal slices, each horizontal slice is a<br>
discrete volume bounded on its sides by the sidewall of the reactor and bounded<br>
on its top and bottom by imaginary horizontal planes. The highest horizontal<br>
slice is bounded on its bottom by an imaginary horizontal plane and on its top<br>
by the upper surface of the reaction medium. The lowest horizontal slice is<br>
bounded on its top by an imaginary horizontal plane and on its bottom by the<br>
lower end of the vessel. Once the reaction medium has been theoretically<br>
partitioned into 2,000 discrete horizontal slices of equal volume, the timeaveraged<br>
and volume-averaged gas hold-up of each horizontal slice can be<br>
determined. When this method of quantifying the amount of unaerated zones is<br>
employed, it is preferred for the number of horizontal slices having a timeaveraged<br>
and volume-averaged gas hold-up less than 0.1 to be less than 30,<br>
more preferably less than 15, still more preferably less than 6, even more<br>
preferably less than 4, and most preferably less than 2. It is preferred for the<br>
number of horizontal slices having a gas hold-up less than 0.2 to be less than 80,<br>
more preferably less than 40, still more preferably less than 20, even more<br>
preferably less than 12, and most preferably less than 5. It is preferred for the<br>
number of horizontal slices having a gas hold-up less than 0.3 to be less than<br>
120, more preferably less than 80, still more preferably less than 40, even more<br>
preferably less than 20, and most preferably less than 15.<br>
Referring again to FIGS. 1 and 2, it has been discovered that positioning<br>
oxidant sparger 34 lower in reaction zone 28 provides several advantages,<br>
including reduction of the amount of unaerated zones in reaction medium 36.<br>
Given a height "H" of reaction medium 36, a length "L" of reaction zone 28,<br>
and a maximum diameter "D" of reaction zone 28, it is preferred for a majority<br>
(i.e., &gt;50 percent by weight) of the oxidant stream to be introduced into reaction<br>
zone 28 within about 0.025H, 0.022L, and/or 0.25D of lower end 52 of reaction<br>
zone 28. More preferably, a majority of the oxidant stream is introduced into<br>
reaction zone 28 within about 0.02H, 0.018L, and/or 0.2D of lower end 52 of<br>
reaction zone 28. Most preferably, a majority of the oxidant stream is<br>
introduced into reaction zone 28 within 0.015H, 0.013L, and/or 0.15D of lower<br>
end 52 of reaction zone 28.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 2, the vertical distance "Yi"<br>
between lower end 52 of reaction zone 28 and the outlet of upper oxidant<br>
openings 68 of oxidant sparger 34 is less than about 0.25H, 0.022L, and/or<br>
0.25D, so that substantially all of the oxidant stream enters reaction zone 28<br>
within about 0.25H, 0.022L, and/or 0.25D of lower end 52 of reaction zone 28.<br>
More preferably, YI is less than about 0.02H, 0.018L, and/or 0.2D. Most<br>
preferably, Yi is less than 0.015H, 0.013L, and/or 0.15D, but more than 0.005H,<br>
0.004L, and/or 0.06D. FIG. 2 illustrates a tangent line 72 at the location where<br>
the bottom edge of cylindrical main body 46 of vessel shell 22 joins with the top<br>
edge of elliptical lower head 48 of vessel shell 22. Alternatively, lower head 48<br>
can be of any shape, including conical, and the tangent line is still defined as the<br>
bottom edge of cylindrical main body 46. The vertical distance "Y2" between<br>
tangent line 72 and the top of oxidant sparger 34 is preferably at least about<br>
0.0012H, 0.001L, and/or 0.01D; more preferably at least about 0.005H, 0.004L,<br>
and/or 0.05D; and most preferably at least 0.01H, 0.008L, and/or 0.1D. The<br>
vertical distance "Ya" between lower end 52 of reaction zone 28 and the outlet<br>
of lower oxidant openings 70 of oxidant sparger 34 is preferably less than about<br>
0.015H, 0.013L, and/or 0.15D; more preferably less than about 0.012H, 0.01L,<br>
and/or 0.1D; and most preferably less than 0.01H, 0.008L, and/or 0.075D, but<br>
more than 0.003H, 0.002L, and/or 0.025D.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the openings that<br>
discharge the oxidant stream and the feed stream into the reaction zone are<br>
35<br>
configured so that the amount (by weight) of the oxidant or feed stream<br>
discharged from an opening is directly proportional to the open area of the<br>
opening. Thus, for example, if 50 percent of the cumulative open area defined<br>
by all oxidants openings is located within 0.15D of the bottom of the reaction<br>
zone, then 50 weight percent of the oxidant stream enters the reaction zone<br>
within 0.15D of the bottom of the reaction zone and vice-versa.<br>
In addition to the advantages provided by minimizing unaerated zones<br>
(i.e., zones with low gas hold-up) in reaction medium 36, it has been discovered<br>
that oxidation can be enhanced by maximizing the gas hold-up of the entire<br>
reaction medium 36. Reaction medium 36 preferably has time-averaged and<br>
volume-averaged gas hold-up of at least about 0.4, more preferably in the range<br>
of from about 0.6 to about 0.9, and most preferably in the range of from 0.65 to<br>
0.85. Several physical and operational attributes of bubble column reactor 20<br>
contribute to the high gas hold-up discussed above. For example, for a given<br>
reactor size and flow of oxidant stream, the high L:D ratio of reaction zone 28<br>
yields a lower diameter which increases the superficial velocity in reaction<br>
medium 36 which in turn increases gas hold-up. Additionally, the actual<br>
diameter of a bubble column and the L:D ratio are known to influence the<br>
average gas hold-up even for a given constant superficial velocity. In addition,<br>
the minimization of unaerated zones, particularly in the bottom of reaction zone<br>
28, contributes to an increased gas hold-up value. Further, the overhead<br>
pressure and mechanical configuration of the bubble column reactor can affect<br>
operating stability at the high superficial velocities and gas hold-up values<br>
disclosed herein.<br>
Furthermore, the inventors have discovered the importance of operating<br>
with an optimized overhead pressure to obtain increased gas hold-up and<br>
increased mass transfer. It might seem that operating with a lower overhead<br>
pressure, which reduces the solubility of molecular oxygen according to a<br>
Henry's Law effect, would reduce the mass transfer rate of molecular oxygen<br>
from gas to liquid, hi a mechanically agitated vessel, such is typically the case<br>
because aeration levels and mass transfer rates are dominated by agitator design<br>
and overhead pressure. However, in a bubble column reactor according to a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention, it has been discovered how to<br>
use a lower overhead pressure to cause a given mass of gas-phase oxidant<br>
stream to occupy more volume, increasing the superficial velocity in reaction<br>
medium 36 and in turn increasing the gas hold-up and transfer rate of molecular<br>
oxygen.<br>
The balance between bubble coalescence and breakup is an extremely<br>
complicated phenomenon, leading on the one hand to a tendency to foam, which<br>
reduces internal circulation rates of the liquid phase and which may require<br>
very, very large disengaging zones, and on the other hand to a tendency to<br>
fewer, very large bubbles that give a lower gas hold-up and lower mass transfer<br>
rate from the oxidant stream to the liquid phase. Concerning the liquid phase,<br>
its composition, density, viscosity and surface tension, among other factors, are<br>
known to interact in a very complicated manner to produce very complicated<br>
results even in the absence of a solid-phase. For example, laboratory<br>
investigators have found it useful to qualify whether "water" is tap water,<br>
distilled water, or de-ionized water, when reporting and evaluating observations<br>
for even simple water-air bubble columns. For complex mixtures in the liquid<br>
phase and for the addition of a solid phase, the degree of complexity rises<br>
further. The surface irregularities of individual particles of solids, the average<br>
size of solids, the particle size distribution, the amount of solids relative to the<br>
liquid phase, and the ability of the liquid to wet the surface of the solid, among<br>
other things, are all important in their interaction with the liquid phase and the<br>
oxidant stream in establishing what bubbling behavior and natural convection<br>
flow patterns will result.<br>
Thus, the ability of the bubble column reactor to function usefully with<br>
the high superficial velocities and high gas hold-up disclosed herein depends,<br>
for example, on an appropriate selection of: (1) the composition of the liquid<br>
phase of the reaction medium; (2) the amount and type of precipitated solids,<br>
both of which can be adjusted by reaction conditions; (3) the amount of oxidant<br>
stream fed to the reactor; (4) the overhead pressure, which affects the<br>
volumetric flow of oxidant stream, the stability of bubbles, and, via the energy<br>
balance, the reaction temperature; (5) the reaction temperature itself, which<br>
affects the fluid properties, the properties of precipitated solids, and the specific<br>
volume of the oxidant stream; and (6) the geometry and mechanical details of<br>
the reaction vessel, including the L:D ratio.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 1, it has been discovered that improved<br>
distribution of the oxidizable compound (e.g., para-xylene) in reaction medium<br>
36 can be provided by introducing the liquid-phase feed stream into reaction<br>
zone 28 at multiple vertically-spaced locations. Preferably, the liquid-phase<br>
feed stream is introduced into reaction zone 28 via at least 3 feed openings,<br>
more preferably at least 4 feed openings. As used herein, the term "feed<br>
openings" shall denote openings where the liquid-phase feed stream is<br>
discharged into reaction zone 28 for mixing with reaction medium 36. It is<br>
preferred for at least 2 of the feed openings to be vertically-spaced from one<br>
another by at least about 0.5D, more preferably at least about 1.5D, and most<br>
preferably at least 3D. However, it is preferred for the highest feed opening to<br>
be vertically-spaced from the lowest oxidant opening by not more than about<br>
0.75H, 0.65L, and/or 8D; more preferably not more than about 0.5H, 0.4L,<br>
and/or 5D; and most preferably not more than 0.4H, 0.35L, and/or 4D.<br>
Although it is desirable to introduce the liquid-phase feed stream at<br>
multiple vertical locations, it has also been discovered that improved<br>
distribution of the oxidizable compound in reaction medium 36 is provided if<br>
the majority of the liquid-phase feed stream is introduced into the bottom half of<br>
reaction medium 36 and/or reaction zone 28. Preferably, at least about 75<br>
weight percent of the liquid-phase feed stream is introduced into the bottom half<br>
of reaction medium 36 and/or reaction zone 28. Most preferably, at least 90<br>
weight percent of the liquid-phase feed stream is introduced into the bottom half<br>
of reaction medium 36 and/or reaction zone 28. hi addition, it is preferred for at<br>
least about 30 weight percent of the liquid-phase feed stream to be introduced<br>
into reaction zone 28 within about 1.5D of the lowest vertical location where the<br>
oxidant stream is introduced into reaction zone 28. This lowest vertical location<br>
where the oxidant stream is introduced into reaction zone 28 is typically at the<br>
bottom of oxidant sparger; however, a variety of alternative configurations for<br>
introducing the oxidant stream into reaction zone 28 are contemplated by a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention. Preferably, at least about 50<br>
weight percent of the liquid-phase feed is introduced within about 2.5D of the<br>
lowest vertical location where the oxidant stream is introduced into reaction<br>
zone 28. Preferably, at least about 75 weight percent of the liquid-phase feed<br>
stream is introduced within about 5D of the lowest vertical location where the<br>
oxidant stream is introduced into reaction zone 28.<br>
Each feed opening defines an open area through which the feed is<br>
discharged. It is preferred that at least about 30 percent of the cumulative open<br>
area of all the feed inlets is located within about 1.5D of the lowest vertical<br>
location where the oxidant stream is introduced into reaction zone 28.<br>
Preferably, at least about 50 percent of the cumulative open area of all the feed<br>
inlets is located within about 2.5D of the lowest vertical location where the<br>
oxidant stream is introduced into reaction zone 28. Preferably, at least about 75<br>
percent of the cumulative open area of all the feed inlets is located within about<br>
5D of the lowest vertical location where the oxidant stream is introduced into<br>
reaction zone 28.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 1, in one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
feed inlets 32a,b,c,d are simply a series of vertically-aligned openings along one<br>
side of vessel shell 22. These feed openings preferably have substantially<br>
similar diameters of less than about 7 centimeters, more preferably in the range<br>
of from about 0.25 to about 5 centimeters, and most preferably in the range of<br>
from 0.4 to 2 centimeters. Bubble column reactor 20 is preferably equipped<br>
with a system for controlling the flow rate of the liquid-phase feed stream out of<br>
each feed opening. Such flow control system preferably includes an individual<br>
flow control valve 74a,b,c,d for each respective feed inlet 32a,b,c,d. hi<br>
addition, it is preferred for bubble column reactor 20 to be equipped with a flow<br>
control system that allows at least a portion of the liquid-phase feed stream to be<br>
introduced into reaction zone 28 at an elevated inlet superficial velocity of at<br>
least about 2 meters per second, more preferably at least about 5 meters per<br>
second, still more preferably at least about 6 meters per second, and most<br>
preferably in the range of from 8 to 20 meters per second. As used herein, the<br>
term "inlet superficial velocity" denotes the time-averaged volumetric flow rate<br>
of the feed stream out of the feed opening divided by the area of the feed<br>
opening. Preferably, at least about 50 weight percent of the feed stream is<br>
introduced into reaction zone 28 at an elevated inlet superficial velocity. Most<br>
preferably, substantially all the feed stream is introduced into reaction zone 28<br>
at an elevated inlet superficial velocity.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 6-7, an alternative system for introducing the<br>
liquid-phase feed stream into reaction zone 28 is illustrated. In this<br>
embodiment, the feed stream is introduced into reaction zone 28 at four<br>
different elevations. Each elevation is equipped with a respective feed<br>
distribution system 76a,b,c,d. Each feed distribution system 76 includes a main<br>
feed conduit 78 and a manifold 80. Each manifold 80 is provided with at least<br>
two outlets 82,84 coupled to respective insert conduits 86,88, which extend into<br>
reaction zone 28 of vessel shell 22. Each insert conduit 86,88 presents a<br>
respective feed opening 87,89 for discharging the feed stream into reaction zone<br>
28. Feed openings 87,89 preferably have substantially similar diameters of less<br>
than about 7 centimeters, more preferably in the range of from about 0.25 to<br>
about 5 centimeters, and most preferably in the range of from 0.4 to 2<br>
centimeters. It is preferred for feed openings 87,89 of each feed distribution<br>
system 76a,b,c,d to be diametrically opposed so as to introduce the feed stream<br>
into reaction zone 28 in opposite directions. Further, it is preferred for the<br>
diametrically opposed feed openings 86,88 of adjacent feed distribution systems<br>
76 to be oriented at 90 degrees of rotation relative to one another. In operation,<br>
the liquid-phase feed stream is charged to main feed conduit 78 and<br>
subsequently enters manifold 80. Manifold 80 distributes the feed stream<br>
evenly for simultaneous introduction on opposite sides of reactor 20 via feed<br>
openings 87,89.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates an alternative configuration wherein each feed<br>
distribution system 76 is equipped with bayonet tubes 90,92 rather than insert<br>
conduits 86,88 (shown in FIG. 7). Bayonet tubes 90,92 project into reaction<br>
zone 28 and include a plurality of small feed openings 94,96 for discharging the<br>
liquid-phase feed into reaction zone 28. It is preferred for the small feed<br>
openings 94,96 of bayonet tubes 90,92 to have substantially the same diameters<br>
of less than about 50 millimeters, more preferably about 2 to about 25<br>
millimeters, and most preferably 4 to 15 millimeters.<br>
FIGS. 9-11 illustrate an alternative feed distribution system 100. Feed<br>
distribution system 100 introduces the liquid-phase feed stream at a plurality of<br>
vertically-spaced and laterally-spaced locations without requiring multiple<br>
penetrations of the sidewall of bubble column reactor 20. Feed introduction<br>
system 100 generally includes a single inlet conduit 102, a header 104, a<br>
plurality of upright distribution tubes 106, a lateral support mechanism 108, and<br>
a vertical support mechanism 110. Inlet conduit 102 penetrates the sidewall of<br>
main body 46 of vessel shell 22. Inlet conduit 102 is fluidly coupled to header<br>
104. Header 104 distributes the feed stream received from inlet conduit 102<br>
evenly among upright distribution tubes 106. Each distribution tube 106 has a<br>
plurality of vertically-spaced feed openings 112a,b,c,d for discharging the feed<br>
stream into reaction zone 28. Lateral support mechanism 108 is coupled to each<br>
distribution tube 106 and inhibits relative lateral movement of distribution tubes<br>
106. Vertical support mechanism 110 is preferably coupled to lateral support<br>
mechanism 108 and to the top of oxidant sparger 34. Vertical support<br>
mechanism 110 substantially inhibits vertical movement of distribution tubes<br>
106 in reaction zone 28. It is preferred for feed openings 112 to have<br>
substantially the same diameters of less than about 50 millimeters, more<br>
preferably about 2 to about 25 millimeters, and most preferably 4 to 15<br>
millimeters. The vertical spacing of feed openings 112 of feed distribution<br>
system 100 illustrated in FIGS. 9-11 can be substantially the same as described<br>
above with reference to the feed distribution system of FIG. 1.<br>
It has been discovered that the flow patterns of the reaction medium in<br>
many bubble column reactors can permit uneven azimuthal distribution of the<br>
oxidizable compound in the reaction medium, especially when the oxidizable<br>
compound is primarily introduced along one side of the reaction medium. As<br>
used herein, the term "azimuthal" shall denote an angle or spacing around the<br>
upright axis of elongation of the reaction zone. As used herein, "upright" shall<br>
mean within 45° of vertical. In one embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
feed stream containing the oxidizable compound (e.g., para-xylene) is<br>
introduced into the reaction zone via a plurality of azimuthally-spaced feed<br>
openings. These azimuthally-spaced feed openings can help prevent regions of<br>
excessively high and excessively low oxidizable compound concentrations in<br>
the reaction medium. The various feed introduction systems illustrated in FIGS.<br>
6-11 are examples of systems that provide proper azimuthal spacing of feed<br>
openings.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 7, in order to quantify the azimuthally-spaced<br>
introduction of the liquid-phase feed stream into the reaction medium, the<br>
reaction medium can be theoretically partitioned into four upright azimuthal<br>
quadrants "Qi,Q2,Q3,Q4" of approximately equal volume. These azimuthal<br>
quadrants "Qi,Q2,Q3,Q4" are defined by a pair of imaginary intersecting<br>
perpendicular vertical planes "Pi,P2" extending beyond the maximum vertical<br>
dimension and maximum radial dimension of the reaction medium. When the<br>
reaction medium is contained in a cylindrical vessel, the line of intersection of<br>
the imaginary intersecting vertical planes Pi,P2 will be approximately coincident<br>
with the vertical centerline of the cylinder, and each azimuthal quadrant<br>
Qi,Q2,Q3,Q4 will be a generally wedge-shaped vertical volume having a height<br>
equal to the height of the reaction medium. It is preferred for a substantial<br>
portion of the oxidizable compound to be discharged into the reaction medium<br>
via feed openings located in at least two different azimuthal quadrants.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, not more than about<br>
80 weight percent of the oxidizable compound is discharged into the reaction<br>
medium through feed openings that can be located in a single azimuthal<br>
quadrant. More preferably, not more than about 60 weight percent of the<br>
oxidizable compound is discharged into the reaction medium through feed<br>
openings that can be located in a single azimuthal quadrant. Most preferably,<br>
not more than 40 weight percent of the oxidizable compound is discharged into<br>
the reaction medium through feed openings that can be located in a single<br>
azimuthal quadrant. These parameters for azimuthal distribution of the<br>
oxidizable compound are measured when the azimuthal quadrants are<br>
azimuthally oriented such that the maximum possible amount of oxidizable<br>
compound is being discharged into one of the azimuthal quadrants. For<br>
example, if the entire feed stream is discharged into the reaction medium via<br>
two feed openings that are azimuthally spaced from one another by 89 degrees,<br>
for purposes of determining azimuthal distribution in four azimuthal quadrants,<br>
100 weight percent of the feed stream is discharged into the reaction medium in<br>
a single azimuthal quadrant because the azimuthal quadrants can be azimuthally<br>
oriented in such a manner that both of the feed openings are located in a single<br>
azimuthal quadrant.<br>
In addition to the advantages associated with the proper azimuthalspacing<br>
of the feed openings, it has also been discovered that proper radial<br>
spacing of the feed openings in a bubble column reactor can also be important.<br>
It is preferred for a substantial portion of the oxidizable compound introduced<br>
into the reaction medium to be discharged via feed openings that are radially<br>
spaced inwardly from the sidewall of the vessel. Thus, in one embodiment of<br>
the present invention, a substantial portion of the oxidizable compound enters<br>
the reaction zone via feed openings located in a "preferred radial feed zone" that<br>
is spaced inwardly from the upright sidewalls defining the reaction zone.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 7, the preferred radial feed zone "FZ" can take<br>
the shape of a theoretical upright cylinder centered in reaction zone 28 and<br>
having an outer diameter "Do" of 0.9D, where "D" is the diameter of reaction<br>
zone 28. Thus, an outer annulus "OA" having a thickness of 0.05D is defined<br>
between the preferred radial feed zone FZ and the inside of the sidewall<br>
defining reaction zone 28. It is preferred for little or none of the oxidizable<br>
compound to be introduced into reaction zone 28 via feed openings located in<br>
this outer annulus OA.<br>
In another embodiment, it is preferred for little or none of the oxidizable<br>
compound to be introduced into the center of reaction zone 28. Thus, as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 8, the preferred radial feed zone FZ can take the shape of a<br>
theoretical upright annulus centered in reaction zone 28, having an outer<br>
diameter DO of 0.9D, and having an inner diameter DI of 0.2D. Thus, in this<br>
embodiment, an inner cylinder 1C having a diameter of 0.2D is "cut out" of the<br>
center of the preferred radial feed zone FZ. It is preferred for little or none of<br>
the oxidizable compound to be introduced into reaction zone 28 via feed<br>
openings located in this inner cylinder 1C.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a substantial portion<br>
of the oxidizable compound is introduced into reaction medium 36 via feed<br>
openings located in the preferred radial feed zone, regardless of whether the<br>
preferred radial feed zone has the cylindrical or annular shape described above.<br>
More preferably, at least about 25 weight percent of the oxidizable compound is<br>
discharged into reaction medium 36 via feed openings located in the preferred<br>
radial feed zone. Still more preferably, at least about 50 weight percent of the<br>
oxidizable compound is discharged into reaction medium 36 via feed openings<br>
located in the preferred radial feed zone. Most preferably, at least 75 weight<br>
percent of the oxidizable compound is discharged into reaction medium 36 via<br>
feed openings located in the preferred radial feed zone.<br>
Although the theoretical azimuthal quadrants and theoretical preferred<br>
radial feed zone illustrated in FIGS. 7 and 8 are described with reference to the<br>
distribution of the liquid-phase feed stream, it has been discovered that proper<br>
azimuthal and radial distribution of the gas-phase oxidant stream can also<br>
provide certain advantages. Thus, in one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the description of the azimuthal and radial distribution of the liquid-phase feed<br>
stream, provided above, also applies to the manner in which the gas-phase<br>
oxidant stream is introduced into the reaction medium 36.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 12-15, an alternative oxidant sparger 200 is<br>
illustrated as generally comprising a ring member 202 and a pair of oxidant<br>
entry conduits 204,206. Oxidant sparger 200 of FIGS. 12-15 is similar to<br>
oxidant sparger 34 of FIGS. 1-11 with the following three primary differences:<br>
(1) oxidant sparger 200 does not include a diagonal cross-member; (2) the upper<br>
portion of ring member 202 has no openings for discharging the oxidant in an<br>
upward direction; and (3) oxidant sparger 200 has many more openings in the<br>
lower portion of ring member 202.<br>
As perhaps best illustrated in FIGS. 14 and 15, the bottom portion of<br>
oxidant sparger ring 202 presents a plurality of oxidant openings 208. Oxidant<br>
openings 208 are preferably configured such that at least about 1 percent of the<br>
total open area defined by oxidant openings 208 is located below the centerline<br>
210 (FIG. 15) of ring member 202, where centerline 210 is located at the<br>
elevation of the volumetric centroid of ring member 202. More preferably, at<br>
least about 5 percent of the total open area defined by all oxidant openings 208<br>
is located below centerline 210, with at least about 2 percent of the total open<br>
area being defined by openings 208 that discharge the oxidant stream in a<br>
generally downward direction within about 30 degrees of vertical. Still more<br>
preferably, at least about 20 percent of the total open area defined by all oxidant<br>
openings 208 is located below centerlme 210, with at least about 10 percent of<br>
the total open area being defined by openings 208 that discharge the oxidant<br>
stream in a generally downward direction within 30 degrees of vertical. Most<br>
preferably, at least about 75 percent of the total open area defined by all oxidant<br>
openings 208 is located below centerline 210, with at least about 40 percent of<br>
the total open area being defined by openings 208 that discharge the oxidant<br>
stream in a generally downward direction within 30 degrees of vertical. The<br>
fraction of the total open area defined by all oxidant openings 208 that are<br>
located above centerline 210 is preferably less than about 75 percent, more<br>
preferably less than about 50 percent, still more preferably less than about 25<br>
percent, and most preferably less than 5 percent.<br>
As illustrated in FIGS. 14 and 15, oxidant openings 208 include<br>
downward openings 208a and skewed openings 208b. Downward openings<br>
208a are configured to discharge the oxidant stream generally downwardly at an<br>
angle within about 30 degrees of vertical, more preferably within about 15<br>
degrees of vertical, and most preferably within 5 degrees of vertical. Skewed<br>
openings 208b are configured to discharge the oxidant stream generally<br>
outwardly and downwardly at an angle "A" that is in the range of from about 15<br>
to about 75 degrees from vertical, more preferably angle A is in the range of<br>
from about 30 to about 60 degrees from vertical, and most preferably angle A is<br>
in the range of from 40 to 50 degrees from vertical.<br>
It is preferred for substantially all oxidant openings 208 to have<br>
approximately the same diameter. The diameter of oxidant openings 208 is<br>
preferably in the range of from about 2 to about 300 millimeters, more<br>
preferably in the range of from about 4 to about 120 millimeters, and most<br>
preferably in the range of from 8 to 60 millimeters. The total number of oxidant<br>
openings 208 in ring member 202 is selected to meet the low pressure drop<br>
criteria detailed below. Preferably, the total number of oxidant openings 208<br>
formed in ring member 202 is at least about 10, more preferably the total<br>
number of oxidant openings 208 is in the range of from about 20 to about 200,<br>
and most preferably the total number of oxidant openings 208 is in the range of<br>
from 40 to 100.<br>
Although FIGS. 12-15 illustrate a very specific configuration for oxidant<br>
sparger 200, it is now noted that a variety of oxidant sparger configurations can<br>
be employed to achieve the advantages described herein. For example, the<br>
oxidant sparger does not necessarily need to have the octagonal ring member<br>
configuration illustrated in FIGS. 12-13. Rather, it is possible for the oxidant<br>
sparger to be formed of any configuration of flow conduit(s) that employs a<br>
plurality of spaced-apart openings for discharging the oxidant stream. The size,<br>
number, and discharge direction of the oxidant openings in the flow conduit are<br>
preferably within the ranges stated above. Further, the oxidant sparger is<br>
preferably configured to provide the azimuthal and radial distribution of<br>
molecular oxygen described above.<br>
Regardless of the specific configuration of the oxidant sparger, it is<br>
preferred for the oxidant sparger to be physically configured and operated in a<br>
manner that minimizes the pressure drop associated with discharging the<br>
oxidant stream out of the flow conduit(s), through the oxidant openings, and<br>
into the reaction zone. Such pressure drop is calculated as the time-averaged<br>
static pressure of the oxidant stream inside the flow conduit at oxidant inlets<br>
66a,b of the oxidant sparger minus the time-averaged static pressure in the<br>
reaction zone at the elevation where one-half of the oxidant stream is introduced<br>
above that vertical location and one-half of the oxidant stream is introduced<br>
below that vertical location. In a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the time-averaged pressure drop associated with discharging the<br>
oxidant stream from the oxidant sparger is less than about 0.3 megapascal<br>
(MPa), more preferably less than about 0.2 MPa, still more preferably less than<br>
about 0.1 MPa, and most preferably less than 0.05 MPa. Under the preferred<br>
operating conditions of the bubble column reactor described herein, the pressure<br>
of the oxidant stream inside the flow conduit(s) of the oxidant sparger is<br>
preferably in the range of from about 0.35 to about 1 MPa, more preferably in<br>
the range of from about 0.45 to about 0.85 MPa, and most preferably in the<br>
range of from 0.5 to 0.7 MPa.<br>
As alluded to earlier with reference to the oxidant sparger configuration<br>
illustrated in FIGS. 2-5, it may be desirable to continuously or periodically flush<br>
the oxidant sparger with a liquid (e.g., acetic acid, water, and/or para-xylene) to<br>
prevent fouling of the oxidant sparger with solids. When such a liquid flush is<br>
employed, it is preferred for an effective amount of the liquid (i.e., not just the<br>
minor amount of liquid droplets that might naturally be present in the oxidant<br>
stream) to be passed through the oxidant sparger and out of the oxidant<br>
openings for at least one period of more than one minute each day. When a<br>
liquid is continuously or periodically discharged from the oxidant sparger, it is<br>
preferred for the time-averaged ratio of the mass flow rate of the liquid through<br>
the oxidant sparger to the mass flow rate of the molecular oxygen through the<br>
oxidant sparger to be in the range of from about 0.05:1 to about 30:1, or in the<br>
range of from about 0.1:1 to about 2:1, or even in the range of from 0.2:1 to 1:1.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, a significant portion of the<br>
oxidizable compound (e.g., para-xylene) can be introduced into the reaction<br>
zone through the oxidant sparger. In such a configuration, it is preferred for the<br>
oxidizable compound and the molecular oxygen to be discharged from the<br>
oxidant sparger through the same openings in the oxidant sparger. As noted<br>
above, the oxidizable compound is typically a liquid at STP. Therefore, in this<br>
embodiment, a two-phase stream may be discharged from the oxidant sparger,<br>
with the liquid phase comprising the oxidizable compound and the gas phase<br>
comprising the molecular oxygen. It should be recognized, however, that at<br>
least a portion of the oxidizable compound may be in a gaseous state when<br>
discharged from the oxidant sparger. In one embodiment, the liquid phase<br>
discharged from the oxidant sparger is formed predominately of the oxidizable<br>
compound. In another embodiment, the liquid phase discharged from the<br>
oxidant sparger has substantially the same composition as the feed stream,<br>
described above. When the liquid phase discharged from the oxidant sparger<br>
has substantially the same composition as the feed stream, such liquid phase<br>
may comprise a solvent and/or a catalyst system in the amounts and ratios<br>
described above with reference to the composition of the feed stream.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, it is preferred for at least<br>
about 10 weight percent of all the oxidizable compound introduced into the<br>
reaction zone to be introduced via the oxidant sparger, more preferably at least<br>
about 40 weight percent of the oxidizable compound is introduced into the<br>
reaction zone via the oxidant sparger, and most preferably at least 80 weight<br>
percent of the oxidizable compound is introduced into the reaction zone via the<br>
oxidant sparger. When all or part of the oxidizable compound is introduced into<br>
the reaction zone via the oxidant sparger, it is preferred for at least about 10<br>
weight percent of all the molecular oxygen introduced into the reaction zone to<br>
be introduced via the same oxidant sparger, more preferably at least about 40<br>
weight percent of the oxidizable compound is introduced into the reaction zone<br>
via the same oxidant sparger, and most preferably at least 80 weight percent of<br>
the oxidizable compound is introduced into the reaction zone via the same<br>
oxidant sparger. When a significant portion of the oxidizable compound is<br>
introduced into the reaction zone via the oxidant sparger, it is preferred for one<br>
or more temperature sensing devices (e.g., thermocouples) to be disposed in the<br>
oxidant sparger. These temperature sensors can be employed to help to make<br>
sure the temperature in the oxidant sparger does not become dangerously high.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 16-18, bubble column reactor 20 is illustrated as<br>
including an internal deaeration vessel 300 disposed in the bottom of reaction<br>
zone 28 near slurry outlet 38. It has been discovered that impurity-forming side<br>
reactions occur at a relatively high rate during deaeration of reaction medium<br>
36. As used herein, "deaeration" shall denote the disengagement of a gas phase<br>
from multi-phase reaction medium. When reaction medium 36 is highly aerated<br>
(&gt;0.3 gas hold-up), impurity formation is minimal. When reaction medium 36<br>
is highly unaerated (
However, when reaction medium is partially-aerated (0.01-0.3 gas hold-up),<br>
undesirable side reactions are promoted and increased impurities are generated.<br>
Deaeration vessel 300 addresses this and other problems by minimizing the<br>
volume of reaction medium 36 in a partially-aerated stated, and by minimizing<br>
the time it takes to deaerate reaction medium 36. A substantially deaerated<br>
slurry is produced from the bottom of deaeration vessel 300 and exits reactor 20<br>
via slurry outlet 38. The substantially deaerated slurry preferably contains less<br>
than about 5 volume percent gas phase, more preferably less than about 2<br>
volume percent gas phase, and most preferably less than 1 volume percent gas<br>
phase.<br>
In FIG. 16, bubble column reactor 20 is illustrated as including a level<br>
controller 302 and a flow control valve 304. Level controller 302 and flow<br>
control valve 304 cooperate to maintain reaction medium 36 at a substantially<br>
constant elevation in reaction zone 28. Level controller 302 is operable to sense<br>
(e.g., by differential pressure level sensing or by nuclear level sensing) the<br>
elevation of upper surface 44 of reaction medium 36 and generate a control<br>
signal 306 responsive to the elevation of reaction medium 36. Flow control<br>
valve 304 receives control signal 306 and adjusts the flow rate of a slurry<br>
through a slurry outlet conduit 308. Thus, the flow rate of the slurry out of<br>
slurry outlet 38 can vary between a maximum slurry volumetric flow rate (Fmax)<br>
when the elevation of reaction medium 36 is too high and a minimum slurry<br>
volumetric flow rate (Fmjn) when the elevation of reaction medium 36 is too<br>
low.<br>
In order to remove solid-phase oxidation product from reaction zone 28,<br>
a portion must first pass through deaeration vessel 300. Deaeration vessel 300<br>
provides a low-turbulence internal volume that permits the gas phase of reaction<br>
medium 36 to naturally rise out of the liquid and solid phases of reaction<br>
medium 36 as the liquid and solids flow downwardly toward slurry outlet 38.<br>
The rising of the gas phase out of the liquid and solid phases is caused by the<br>
natural upward buoyancy of the gas phase in the liquid and solid phases. When<br>
deaeration vessel 300 is employed, the transitioning of reaction medium 36<br>
from a fully-aerated, three-phase medium to a fully-deaerated, two-phase slurry<br>
is quick and efficient.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 17 and 18, deaeration vessel 300 includes a<br>
generally upright sidewall 308 defining a deaeration zone 312 therebetween.<br>
Preferably, sidewall 308 extends upwardly within about 30 degrees of vertical,<br>
more preferably within about 10 degrees of vertical. Most preferably, sidewall<br>
308 is substantially vertical. Deaeration zone 312 is separate from reaction<br>
zone 28 and has height "h" and a diameter "d." An upper end 310 of sidewall<br>
308 is open so as to receive reaction medium from reaction zone 28 into internal<br>
volume 312. The lower end of sidewall 308 is fluidly coupled to slurry outlet<br>
38 via a transition section 314. In certain instances, such as when the opening<br>
of slurry outlet 38 is large or when the diameter "d" of sidewall 308 is small,<br>
transition section 314 can be eliminated. As perhaps best illustrated in FIG. 18,<br>
deaeration vessel 300 can also include a vortex breaker 316 disposed in<br>
deaeration zone 312. Vortex breaker 316 can be any structure operable to<br>
inhibit the formation of vortices as the solid and liquid phases flow downwardly<br>
towards slurry outlet 38.<br>
In order to permit proper disengagement of the gas phase from the solid<br>
and liquid phases in deaeration vessel 300, the height "h" and horizontal crosssectional<br>
area of internal deaeration zone 312 are carefully selected. The height<br>
"h" and horizontal cross-sectional area of internal deaeration zone 312 should<br>
provide sufficient distance and time so that even when the maximum amount of<br>
slurry is being withdrawn (i.e., when slurry is being withdrawn at Fmax),<br>
substantially all of the gas bubble volume can rise out of the solid and liquid<br>
phases before the gas bubbles reach the bottom outlet of deaeration vessel 300.<br>
Thus, it is preferred for the cross-sectional area of deaeration zone 312 to be<br>
such that the maximum downward velocity (Vdmax) of the liquid and solid<br>
phases through deaeration zone 312 is substantially less than the natural rise<br>
velocity (Vu) of the gas phase bubbles through the liquid and solid phases. The<br>
maximum downward velocity (Vdmax) of the liquid and solid phases through<br>
deaeration zone 312 occurs at the maximum slurry volumetric flow rate (Fmax),<br>
discussed above. The natural rise velocity (Vu) of the gas bubbles through the<br>
liquid and solid phases varies depending on the size of the bubbles; however,<br>
the natural rise velocity (VUQ.5) of 0.5 centimeter diameter gas bubbles through<br>
the liquid and solid phases can be used as a cut-off value because substantially<br>
all of the bubble volume initially in reaction medium 36 will be greater than 0.5<br>
centimeters. Preferably, the cross-sectional area of deaeration zone 312 is such<br>
that Vdmax is less than about 75 percent of Vu0.5, more preferably Vdmax is less<br>
than about 40 percent of Vu0.5, most preferably Vdmax is less than 20 percent of<br>
Vuo.5.<br>
The downward velocity of the liquid and solid phases in deaeration zone<br>
312 of deaeration vessel 300 is calculated as the volumetric flow rate of the<br>
deaerated slurry through slurry outlet 38 divided by the minimum crosssectional<br>
area of deaeration zone 312. The downward velocity of the liquid and<br>
solid phases in deaeration zone 312 of deaeration vessel 300 is preferably less<br>
than about 50 centimeters per second, more preferably less than about 30<br>
centimeters per second, and most preferably less than 10 centimeters per<br>
second.<br>
It is now noted that although upright sidewall 308 of deaeration vessel<br>
300 is illustrated as having a cylindrical configuration, sidewall 308 could<br>
comprise a plurality of sidewalls that form a variety of configurations (e.g.,<br>
triangular, square, or oval), so long as the walls defines an internal volume<br>
having an appropriate volume, cross-sectional area, width "d", and height "h".<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, "d" is in the range of from<br>
about 0.2 to about 2 meters, more preferably in the range of from about 0.3 to<br>
about 1.5 meters, and most preferably in the range of from 0.4 to 1.2 meters. In<br>
a preferred embodiment of the present invention, "h" is in the range of from<br>
about 0.3 meters to about 5 meters, more preferably in the range of from about<br>
0.5 to about 3 meters, and most preferably in the range of from 0.75 to 2 meters.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, sidewall 308 is<br>
substantially vertical so that the horizontal cross-sectional area of deaeration<br>
zone 312 is substantially constant along the entire height "h" of deaeration zone<br>
312. Preferably, the maximum horizontal cross-sectional area of deaeration<br>
zone 312 is less than about 25 percent of the maximum horizontal crosssectional<br>
area of reaction zone 28. More preferably, the maximum horizontal<br>
cross-sectional area of deaeration zone 312 is in the range of from about 0.1 to<br>
about 10 percent of the maximum horizontal cross-sectional area of reaction<br>
zone 28. Most preferably, the maximum horizontal cross-sectional area of<br>
deaeration zone 312 is in the range of from 0.25 to 4 percent of the maximum<br>
horizontal cross-sectional area of reaction zone 28. Preferably, the maximum<br>
horizontal cross-sectional area of deaeration zone 312 is in the range of from<br>
about 0.02 to about 3 square meters, more preferably in the range of from about<br>
0.05 to about 2 square meters, and most preferably in the range of from 0.1 to<br>
1.2 square meters. The volume of deaeration zone 312 is preferably less than<br>
about 5 percent of the total volume of reaction medium 36 or reaction zone 28.<br>
More preferably, the volume of deaeration zone 312 is in the range of from<br>
about 0.01 to about 2 percent of the total volume of reaction medium 36 or<br>
reaction zone 28. Most preferably, the volume of deaeration zone 312 is in the<br>
range of from 0.05 to about 1 percent of the total volume of reaction medium 36<br>
or reaction zone 28. The volume of deaeration zone 312 is preferably less than<br>
about 2 cubic meters, more preferably in the range of from about 0.01 to about 1<br>
cubic meters, and most preferably in the range of from 0.05 to 0.5 cubic meters.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 19, bubble column reactor 20 is illustrated as<br>
including an external deaeration vessel 400. In this configuration, aerated<br>
reaction medium 36 is withdrawn from reaction zone 28 via an elevated opening<br>
in the side of vessel shell 22. The withdrawn aerated medium is transported to<br>
external deaeration vessel 400 via an outlet conduit 402 for disengagement of<br>
the gas phase from the solid and liquid phases. The disengaged gas phase exits<br>
deaeration vessel 400 via conduit 404, while the substantially deaerated slurry<br>
exits deaeration vessel 400 via conduit 406.<br>
In FIG. 19, outlet conduit 402 is shown as being approximately straight,<br>
horizontal, and orthogonal to vessel shell 22. This is merely one convenient<br>
configuration; and outlet conduit 402 may be otherwise in any respect,<br>
providing that it usefully connects bubble column reactor 20 with external<br>
deaeration vessel 400. Turning to conduit 404, it is useful for this conduit to<br>
connect at or near the top deaeration vessel 400 in order to control safety issues<br>
relating to a stagnant gas pocket containing oxidizable compound and oxidant.<br>
Furthermore, conduits 402 and 404 may usefully comprise means of flow<br>
isolation, such as valves.<br>
When reaction medium 36 is withdrawn from reactor 20 via an elevated<br>
outlet, as shown in FIG. 19, it is preferred for bubble column reactor 20 to be<br>
equipped with a lower outlet 408 near the bottom 52 of reaction zone 28.<br>
Lower outlet 408 and a lower conduit 410, coupled thereto, can be used to deinventory<br>
(i.e., empty) reactor 20 during shutdowns. Preferably, one or more<br>
lower outlet 408 is provided in the bottom one-third of the height of reaction<br>
medium 36, more preferably in the bottom one-fourth of reaction medium 36,<br>
and most preferably at the lowest point of reaction zone 28.<br>
With the elevated slurry withdrawal and deaeration system shown in<br>
FIG. 19, lower conduit 410 and outlet 408 are not used to withdraw slurry from<br>
reaction zone 28 during oxidation. It is known in the art that solids tend to<br>
settle by gravity forces in unaerated and otherwise unagitated portions of the<br>
slurry, including in stagnant flow conduits. Furthermore, the settled solids (e.g.,<br>
terephthalic acid) can tend to solidify into large agglomerates by continuing<br>
precipitation and/or crystalline reorganization. Thus, in order to avoid plugging<br>
of lower flow conduit 410, a fraction of the deaerated slurry from the bottom of<br>
deaeration vessel 400 can be used to continuously or intermittently flush lower<br>
conduit 410 during normal operation of reactor 20. A preferred means of<br>
providing such a slurry flush to conduit 410 is to periodically open a valve 412<br>
in conduit 410 and allow a fraction of the deaerated slurry to flow through<br>
conduit 410 and into reaction zone 28 via lower opening 408. Even when valve<br>
412 is fully or partially open, only a fraction of the deaerated slurry flows<br>
through lower conduit 410 and back into reaction zone 28. The remaining<br>
fraction of the deaerated slurry not used to flush lower conduit 410 is carried via<br>
conduit 414 away from reactor 20 for further downstream processing (e.g.,<br>
purification).<br>
During normal operation of bubble column reactor 20 over a substantial<br>
length of time (e.g., &gt;100 hours), it is preferred for the amount of deaerated<br>
slurry used to flush lower conduit 410 to be less than 50 percent by weight of<br>
the total deaerated slurry produced from the bottom of deaeration vessel 400,<br>
more preferably less than about 20 percent by weight, and most preferably less<br>
than 5 percent by weight. Further, it is preferred that over a substantial length<br>
of time the average mass flow rate of deaerated slurry used to flush lower<br>
conduit 410 is less than about 4 times the average mass flow rate of the<br>
oxidizable compound into reaction zone 28, more preferably less than about 2<br>
times the average mass flow rate of the oxidizable compound into reaction zone<br>
28, still more preferably less than the average mass flow rate of the oxidizable<br>
compound into reaction zone 28, and most preferably less than 0.5 times the<br>
average mass flow rate of the oxidizable compound into reaction zone 28.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 19, deaeration vessel 400 includes a<br>
substantially upright, preferably cylindrical sidewall 416 defining a deaeration<br>
zone 418. Deaeration zone 418 has a diameter "d" and height "h." Height "h"<br>
is measured as the vertical distance between the location where the aerated<br>
reaction medium enters deaeration vessel 400 and the bottom of sidewall 416.<br>
The height "h", diameter "d", area, and volume of deaeration zone 418 is<br>
preferably substantially the same as described above with reference to<br>
deaeration zone 312 of deaeration vessel 300 illustrated in FIGS. 16-18. In<br>
addition, deaeration vessel 400 includes an upper section 420 formed by<br>
extending sidewall 416 above deaeration zone 418. Upper section 420 of<br>
deaeration vessel 400 may be of any height, though it preferably extends<br>
upwardly to or above the level of reaction medium 36 in reaction zone 28.<br>
Upper section 420 ensures that the gas phase has room to properly disengage<br>
from the liquid and solid phases before exiting deaeration vessel 400 via conduit<br>
404. It is now noted that although conduit 404 is illustrated as returning the<br>
disengaged gas phase to the disengagement zone of reactor 20, conduit 404<br>
could alternatively be coupled to vessel shell 22 at any elevation above outlet<br>
conduit 402. Optionally, conduit 404 could be coupled to gas outlet conduit 40<br>
so that the disengaged gas phase from deaeration vessel 400 is combined with<br>
the removed overhead vapor stream in conduit 40 and sent downstream for<br>
further processing.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 20, bubble column reactor 20 is illustrated as<br>
including a hybrid internal-external deaeration vessel 500. In this configuration,<br>
a portion of reaction medium 36 is withdrawn from reaction zone 28 through a<br>
relatively large elevated opening 502 in the sidewall of vessel shell 22. The<br>
withdrawn reaction medium 36 is then transported through an elbow conduit<br>
504 of relatively large diameter and enters the top of deaeration vessel 500. In<br>
FIG. 20, elbow conduit 504 is shown as connecting orthogonally to the sidewall<br>
of vessel shell 22 and as comprising a smooth turn through an angle of about 90<br>
degrees. This is merely one convenient configuration; and elbow conduit 504<br>
may be otherwise in any respect, providing that it usefully connects bubble<br>
column reactor 20 with external deaeration vessel 500, as described.<br>
Furthermore, elbow conduit 504 may usefully comprise means of flow isolation,<br>
such as valves.<br>
In deaeration vessel 500, the gas phase moves upwardly, while the solid<br>
and liquid phases move downwardly. The upwardly moving gas phase can reenter<br>
elbow conduit 504 and then escape through opening 502 back into<br>
reaction zone 28. Thus, a counter-current flow of the entering reaction medium<br>
36 and the exiting disengaged gas can occur at opening 502. The deaerated<br>
slurry exits deaeration vessel 500 via conduit 506. Deaeration vessel 500<br>
includes a substantially upright, preferably cylindrical sidewall 508 defining a<br>
deaeration zone 510. Deaeration zone 510 has a height "h" and a diameter "d."<br>
It is preferred for elevated opening 502 and elbow conduit 504 to have a<br>
diameter the same as, or greater than, the diameter "d" of deaeration zone 510.<br>
The height "h", diameter "d", area, and volume of deaeration zone 510 are<br>
preferably substantially the same as described above with reference to<br>
deaeration zone 312 of deaeration vessel 300 illustrated in FIGS. 16-18.<br>
FIGS. 19 and 20 illustrate an embodiment of bubble column reactor 20<br>
where the solid product (e.g., crude terephthalic acid) produced in reaction zone<br>
28 is withdrawn from reaction zone 28 via an elevated outlet. Withdrawing<br>
aerated reaction medium 36 from an elevated location above the bottom of<br>
bubble column reactor 20 can help avoid accumulation and stagnation of poorly<br>
aerated reaction medium 36 at the bottom 52 of reaction zone 28. According to<br>
other aspects of the present invention, the concentrations of oxygen and the<br>
oxidizable compound (e.g., para-xylene) in the reaction medium 36 near the top<br>
of reaction medium 36 are preferably lower than near the bottom. Thus,<br>
withdrawing reaction medium 36 at an elevated location can increase yield by<br>
lowering the amount of unreacted reactants withdrawn from reactor 20. Also,<br>
the temperature of reaction medium 36 varies significantly in the vertical<br>
direction when bubble column reactor 20 is operated with the high STR and the<br>
gradients of chemical composition as disclosed herein. Under such conditions,<br>
the temperature of reaction medium 36 will typically have local minima near the<br>
lower end and the upper end of reaction zone 28. Near the lower end, the<br>
minimum relates to the evaporation of solvent near where all or part of the<br>
oxidant is admitted. Near the upper end, the minimum is again due to<br>
evaporation of solvent, though here due to declining pressure within the reaction<br>
medium. In addition, other local minima may occur in between the upper and<br>
lower ends wherever additional feed or oxidant is admitted to the reaction<br>
medium. Thus, there exist one or more temperature maxima, driven by the<br>
exothermic heat of oxidation reactions, between the lower end and upper end of<br>
reaction zone 28. Withdrawing reaction medium 36 at an elevated location of<br>
higher temperature can be particularly advantageous when downstream<br>
processing occurs at higher temperatures, because energy costs associated with<br>
heating the withdrawn medium for downstream processing are reduced.<br>
Thus, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention and especially<br>
when downstream processing occurs at higher temperatures, reaction medium<br>
36 is withdrawn from bubble column reactor 20 via an elevated outlet(s)<br>
positioned above the location(s) where at least 50 weight percent of the liquidphase<br>
feed stream and/or the gas-phase oxidant stream enter reaction zone 28.<br>
More preferably, reaction medium 36 is withdrawn from bubble column reactor<br>
20 via an elevated outlet(s) positioned above the location(s) where substantially<br>
all of the liquid-phase feed stream and/or the gas-phase oxidant stream enter<br>
reaction zone 28. Preferably, at least 50 weight percent of the solid-phase and<br>
liquid-phase components withdrawn from bubble column reactor 20 are<br>
withdrawn via an elevated outlet(s). More preferably, substantially all of the<br>
solid-phase and liquid-phase components withdrawn from bubble column<br>
reactor 20 are withdrawn via an elevated outlet(s). Preferably, the elevated<br>
56<br>
outlet(s) is located at least about ID above lower end 52 of reaction zone 28.<br>
More preferably, the elevated outlet(s) is located at least about 2D above lower<br>
end 52 of reaction zone 28. Most preferably, the elevated outlet(s) is located at<br>
least 3D above lower end 52 of reaction zone 28. Given a height "H" of<br>
reaction medium 36, it is preferred for the elevated outlet(s) to be vertically<br>
located between about 0.2H and about 0.8H, more preferably between about<br>
0.3H and about 0.7H, and most preferably between 0.4H and 0.6 H.<br>
Furthermore, it is preferred that the temperature of reaction medium 36 at an<br>
elevated outlet from reaction zone 28 is at least 1°C greater than the temperature<br>
of reaction medium 36 at lower end 52 of reaction zone 28. More preferably,<br>
the temperature of reaction medium 36 at the elevated outlet of reaction zone 28<br>
is in the range of from about 1.5 to about 16°C hotter than the temperature of<br>
reaction medium 36 at lower end 52 of reaction zone 28. Most preferably, the<br>
temperature of reaction medium 36 at the elevated outlet of reaction zone 28 is<br>
in the range of from 2 to 12°C hotter than the temperature of reaction medium<br>
36 at lower end 52 of reaction zone 28.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 21, bubble column reactor 20 is illustrated as<br>
including an alternative hybrid deaeration vessel 600 positioned at the bottom of<br>
reactor 20. In this configuration, aerated reaction medium 36 is withdrawn from<br>
reaction zone 28 through a relatively large opening 602 in the lower end 52 of<br>
vessel shell 22. Opening 602 defines the open upper end of deaeration vessel<br>
600. In deaeration vessel 600, the gas phase moves upwardly, while the solid<br>
and liquid phases move downwardly. The upwardly moving gas phase can reenter<br>
reaction zone 28 through opening 602. Thus, a counter-current flow of the<br>
entering reaction medium 36 and the exiting disengaged gas can occur at<br>
opening 602. The deaerated slurry exits deaeration vessel 600 via conduit 604.<br>
Deaeration vessel 600 includes a substantially upright, preferably cylindrical<br>
sidewall 606 defining a deaeration zone 608. Deaeration zone 608 has a height<br>
"h" and a diameter "d." It is preferred for opening 602 to have a diameter the<br>
same as, or greater than, the diameter "d" of deaeration zone 608. The height<br>
"h", diameter "d", area, and volume of deaeration zone 608 are preferably<br>
substantially the same as described above with reference to deaeration zone 312<br>
of deaeration vessel 300 illustrated in FIGS. 16-18.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 22, bubble column reactor 20 of FIG. 21 is<br>
illustrated as including an alternative oxidant sparger 620. Oxidant sparger 620<br>
includes a ring member 622 and a pair of inlet conduits 624,626. Ring member<br>
622 preferably has substantially the same configuration as ring member 202,<br>
described above with reference to FIGS. 12-15. Inlet conduits 624,626 extend<br>
upwardly through openings in lower head 48 of vessel shell 22 and provide the<br>
oxidant stream to ring member 622.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 23, bubble column reactor 20 of FIG. 21 is<br>
illustrated as including a spargerless means for introducing the oxidant stream<br>
into reaction zone 28. In the configuration of FIG. 23, the oxidant stream is<br>
provided to reactor 20 via oxidant conduits 630,632. Oxidant conduits 630,632<br>
are coupled to respective oxidant openings 634,636 in lower head 48 of vessel<br>
shell 22. The oxidant stream is introduced directly into reaction zone 28 via<br>
oxidant openings 634,636. Optional impingement plates 638,640 can be<br>
provided to deflect the flow of the oxidant stream once it has initially entered<br>
reaction zone 28.<br>
As mentioned above, it is preferred for the oxidation reactor to be<br>
configured and operated in a manner that avoids zones of high concentration of<br>
oxidizable compound in the reaction medium because such zones can lead to the<br>
formation of impurities. One way to improve initial dispersion of the oxidizable<br>
compound (e.g., para-xylene) in the reaction medium is by diluting the<br>
oxidizable compound with a liquid. The liquid used to dilute the oxidizable<br>
compound can originate from a portion of the reaction medium located a<br>
substantial distance from the location(s) where the oxidizable compound is fed<br>
to the reaction zone. This liquid from a distant portion of the reaction medium<br>
can be circulated to a location proximate the location of entry of the oxidizable<br>
compound via a flow conduit that is disposed internally and/or externally to the<br>
main reaction vessel.<br>
FIGS. 24 and 25 illustrate two preferred methods of circulating liquid<br>
from a distant portion of the reaction medium to a location near the inlet of the<br>
oxidizable compound using an internal (FIG. 24) or external (FIG. 25) conduit.<br>
Preferably, the length of the flow conduit from its inlet (i.e., opening(s) where<br>
the liquid enters the conduit) to its outlet (i.e., opening(s) where the liquid is<br>
discharge from the conduit) is greater than about 1 meter, more preferably<br>
greater than about 3 meters, still more preferably greater than about 6 meters,<br>
and most preferably greater than 9 meters. However, the actual length of the<br>
conduit becomes less relevant if the liquid is obtained from a separate vessel,<br>
perhaps located immediately above or beside the vessel into which the<br>
oxidizable compound feed is initially released. Liquid from any separate vessel<br>
containing at least some of the reaction medium is a preferred source for initial<br>
dilution of the oxidizable compound.<br>
It is preferred that the liquid flowing through the conduit, whatever the<br>
source, has a lower standing concentration of oxidizable compound than the<br>
reaction medium immediately adjacent to at least one outlet of the conduit.<br>
Furthermore, it is preferred that the liquid flowing through the conduit has a.<br>
concentration of oxidizable compound in the liquid phase below about 100,000<br>
ppmw, more preferably below about 10,000 ppmw, still more preferably below<br>
about 1,000 ppmw and most preferably below 100 ppmw, where the<br>
concentrations are measured before addition to the conduit of the increment of<br>
oxidizable compound feed and of any optional, separate solvent feed. When<br>
measured after adding the increment of oxidizable compound feed and optional<br>
solvent feed, it is preferable that the combined liquid stream entering the<br>
reaction medium has a concentration of oxidizable compound in the liquid<br>
phase below about 300,000 ppmw, more preferably below about 50,000 ppmw,<br>
and most preferably below 10,000 ppmw.<br>
It is desirable to maintain the flow through the conduit at a low enough<br>
rate so that the circulated liquid does suppress the desirable overall gradient of<br>
oxidizable compound within the reaction medium. In this regard, it is<br>
preferable that the ratio of the mass of the liquid phase in the reaction zone to<br>
which the increment of oxidizable compound is initially released to the mass<br>
flow rate of liquid flowing through the conduit be greater than about 0.3<br>
minutes, more preferably greater than about 1 minute, still more preferably<br>
between about 2 minutes and about 120 minutes, and most preferably between 3<br>
minutes and 60 minutes.<br>
There are many means for compelling the liquid to flow through the<br>
conduit. Preferred means include gravity, eductors of all types employing either<br>
gas or liquid or both as the motive fluid, and mechanical pumps of all types.<br>
When using an eductor, one embodiment of the invention uses as a motive fluid<br>
at least one fluid selected from the group consisting of: feed of oxidizable<br>
compound (liquid or gas), feed of oxidant (gas), feed of solvent (liquid), and a<br>
pumped source of reaction medium (slurry). Another embodiment uses as a<br>
motive fluid at least two fluids selected from the group consisting of: feed of<br>
oxidizable compound, feed of oxidant, and feed of solvent. Still another<br>
embodiment uses as a motive fluid a combination feed of oxidizable compound,<br>
feed of oxidant, and feed of solvent.<br>
The appropriate diameter or diameters of the circulation conduit may<br>
vary according to the amount and properties of material being conveyed, the<br>
energy available for compelling the flow movement, and consideration of<br>
capital cost. It is preferable that the minimum diameter for such conduit is<br>
greater than about 0.02 meters, more preferably between about 0.06 meters and<br>
about 2 meters, and most preferably between 0.12 and 0.8 meters<br>
As noted above, it is desirable to control flow through the conduit in<br>
certain preferred ranges. There are many means known in the art to affect this<br>
control by setting an appropriate fixed geometry during construction of the flow<br>
conduit. Another preferred embodiment is to use geometries that are variable<br>
during operation, notably including valves of all sorts and descriptions,<br>
including both manual operation and powered operation by any means,<br>
including feed back control loops from a sensing element or without. Another<br>
preferred means of controlling the flow of the dilution liquid is to vary the<br>
energy input between inlet and outlet of the conduit. Preferred means include<br>
changing the flow rate of one or more motive fluids to an eductor, changing the<br>
energy input to a pump driver, and changing the density difference or elevation<br>
difference when using gravitational force. These preferred means may be used<br>
in all combinations as well.<br>
The conduit used for circulation of liquid from the reaction medium may<br>
be of any type known in the art. One embodiment employs a conduit<br>
constructed in whole or part using conventional piping materials. Another<br>
embodiment employs a conduit constructed in whole or part using the reaction<br>
vessel wall as one part of the conduit. A conduit may be constructed entirely<br>
enclosed within the boundaries of the reaction vessel (FIG. 24), or it may be<br>
constructed entirely outside the reaction vessel (FIG. 25), or it may comprise<br>
sections both within and without the reaction vessel.<br>
The inventors contemplate that, particularly in larger reactors, it may be<br>
desirable to have multiple conduits and of various designs for movement of the<br>
liquid through the conduit. Further, it may be desirable to provide multiple<br>
outlets at multiple positions on one or all of the conduits. The particulars of the<br>
design will balance the desirable overall gradient in standing concentrations of<br>
oxidizable compound with the desirable initial dilution of oxidizable compound<br>
feed, according to other aspects of the current invention.<br>
FIGS. 24 and 25 both illustrate designs that employ a deaeration vessel<br>
coupled to the conduit. This deaeration vessel ensures that the portion of the<br>
reaction medium used to dilute the incoming oxidizable compound is<br>
substantially de-aerated slurry. It is now noted, however, that the liquid or<br>
slurry used to dilute the incoming oxidizable compound may be in an aerated<br>
form as well as a de-aerated form.<br>
The use of a liquid flowing through a conduit to provide dilution of the<br>
oxidizable compound feed is particularly useful in bubble column reactors.<br>
Furthermore, in bubble column reactors, a good benefit for the initial dilution of<br>
the oxidizable compound feed can be achieved even without adding the<br>
oxidizable compound feed directly into the conduit, providing that the outlet of<br>
the conduit lies sufficiently close to the position of addition of the oxidizable<br>
compound. In such an embodiment, it is preferable that the outlet of the conduit<br>
be located within about 27 conduit outlet diameters of the nearest addition<br>
location for the oxidizable compound, more preferably within about 9 conduit<br>
outlet diameters, still more preferably within about 3 conduit outlet diameters,<br>
and most preferably within 1 conduit outlet diameter.<br>
It has also been discovered that flow eductors can be useful for initial<br>
dilution of oxidizable compound feed in oxidation bubble columns according to<br>
on embodiment of the present invention, even without the use of conduits for<br>
obtaining dilution liquid from a distant portion of the reaction medium. In such<br>
cases, the eductor is located within the reaction medium and has an open<br>
pathway from the reaction medium into the throat of the eductor, where low<br>
pressure draws in adjacent reaction medium. Examples of two possible eductor<br>
configurations are illustrated in FIGS. 26 and 27. In a preferred embodiment of<br>
these eductors, the nearest location of feeding oxidizable compound is within<br>
about 4 meters, more preferably within about 1 meter and most preferably 0.3<br>
meters of the throat of the eductor. In another embodiment, the oxidizable<br>
compound is fed under pressure as a motive fluid. In still another embodiment,<br>
either the solvent or the oxidant is fed under pressure as additional motive fluid<br>
along with the oxidizable compound. In yet another embodiment, both the<br>
solvent and ant oxidant are fed under pressure as additional motive fluid along<br>
with the oxidizable compound.<br>
The inventors contemplate that, particularly in larger reactors, it may be<br>
desirable to have multiple eductors and of various designs situated at various<br>
positions within the reaction medium. The particulars of the design will balance<br>
the desirable overall gradient in standing concentrations of the oxidizable<br>
compound with the desirable initial dilution of the oxidizable compound feed,<br>
according to other aspects of the current invention. In addition, the inventors<br>
contemplate that the outlet flow plumes from an eductor may be oriented in any<br>
direction. When multiple eductors are used, each eductor may be oriented<br>
separately, again in any direction.<br>
As mentioned above, certain physical and operational features of bubble<br>
column reactor 20, described above with reference to FIGS. 1-27, provide for<br>
vertical gradients in the pressure, temperature, and reactant (i.e., oxygen and<br>
oxidizable compound) concentrations of reaction medium 36. As discussed<br>
above, these vertical gradients can provide for a more effective and economical<br>
oxidation process as compared to conventional oxidations processes, which<br>
favor a well-mixed reaction medium of relatively uniform pressure,<br>
temperature, and reactant concentration throughout. The vertical gradients for<br>
oxygen, oxidizable compound (e.g., para-xylene), and temperature made<br>
possible by employing an oxidation system in accordance with an embodiment<br>
of the present invention will now be discussed in greater detail.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 28, in order to quantify the reactant concentration<br>
gradients existing in reaction medium 36 during oxidation in bubble column<br>
reactor 20, the entire volume of reaction medium 36 can be theoretically<br>
partitioned into 30 discrete horizontal slices of equal volume. FIG. 28<br>
illustrates the concept of dividing reaction medium 36 into 30 discrete<br>
horizontal slices of equal volume. With the exception of the highest and lowest<br>
horizontal slices, each horizontal slice is a discrete volume bounded on its top<br>
and bottom by imaginary horizontal planes and bounded on its sides by the wall<br>
of reactor 20. The highest horizontal slice is bounded on its bottom by an<br>
imaginary horizontal plane and on its top by the upper surface of reaction<br>
medium 36. The lowest horizontal slice is bounded on its top by an imaginary<br>
horizontal plane and on its bottom by the bottom of the vessel shell. Once<br>
reaction medium 36 has been theoretically partitioned into 30 discrete<br>
horizontal slices of equal volume, the time-averaged and volume-averaged<br>
concentration of each horizontal slice can then be determined. The individual<br>
horizontal slice having the maximum concentration of all 30 horizontal slices<br>
can be identified as the "C-max horizontal slice." The individual horizontal<br>
slice located above the C-max horizontal slice and having the minimum<br>
concentration of all horizontal slices located above the C-max horizontal slice<br>
can be identified as the "C-min horizontal slice." The vertical concentration<br>
gradient can then be calculated as the ratio of the concentration in the C-max<br>
horizontal slice to the concentration in the C-min horizontal slice.<br>
With respect to quantifying the oxygen concentration gradient, when<br>
reaction medium 36 is theoretically partitioned into 30 discrete horizontal slices<br>
of equal volume, an CVmax horizontal slice is identified as having the<br>
maximum oxygen concentration of all the 30 horizontal slices and an C^-min<br>
horizontal slice is identified as having the minimum oxygen concentration of<br>
the horizontal slices located above the Cvmax horizontal slice. The oxygen<br>
concentrations of the horizontal slices are measured in the gas phase of reaction<br>
medium 36 on a time-averaged and volume-averaged molar wet basis. It is<br>
preferred for the ratio of the oxygen concentration of the C&gt;2-max horizontal<br>
slice to the oxygen concentration of the (Vmin horizontal slice to be in the<br>
range of from about 2:1 to about 25:1, more preferably in the range of from<br>
about 3:1 to about 15:1, and most preferably in the range of from 4:1 to 10:1.<br>
Typically, the (Vmax horizontal slice will be located near the bottom of<br>
reaction medium 36, while the CVmin horizontal slice will be located near the<br>
top of reaction medium 36. Preferably, the (Vmin horizontal slice is one of the<br>
5 upper-most horizontal slices of the 30 discrete horizontal slices. Most<br>
preferably, the (Vmin horizontal slice is the upper-most one of the 30 discrete<br>
horizontal slices, as illustrated in FIG. 28. Preferably, the (Vmax horizontal<br>
slice is one of the 10 lower-most horizontal slices of the 30 discrete horizontal<br>
slices. Most preferably, the CVmax horizontal slice is one of the 5 lower-most<br>
horizontal slices of the 30 discrete horizontal slices. For example, FIG. 28<br>
illustrates the (Vmax horizontal slice as the third horizontal slice from the<br>
bottom of reactor 20. It is preferred for the vertical spacing between the (Vmin<br>
and (Vmax horizontal slices to be at least about 2W, more preferably at least<br>
about 4W, and most preferably at least 6W. It is preferred for the vertical<br>
spacing between the (Vmin and (Vmax horizontal slices to be at least about<br>
0.2H, more preferably at least about 0.4H, and most preferably at least 0.6H<br>
The time-averaged and volume-averaged oxygen concentration, on a wet<br>
basis, of the CVmin horizontal slice is preferably in the range of from about 0.1<br>
to about 3 mole percent, more preferably in the range of from about 0.3 to about<br>
2 mole percent, and most preferably in the range of from 0.5 to 1.5 mole<br>
percent. The time-averaged and volume-averaged oxygen concentration of the<br>
(Vmax horizontal slice is preferably in the range of from about 4 to about 20<br>
mole percent, more preferably in the range of from about 5 to about 15 mole<br>
percent, and most preferably in the range of from 6 to 12 mole percent. The<br>
time-averaged concentration of oxygen, on a dry basis, in the gaseous effluent<br>
discharged from reactor 20 via gas outlet 40 is preferably in the range of from<br>
about 0.5 to about 9 mole percent, more preferably in the range of from about 1<br>
to about 7 mole percent, and most preferably in the range of from 1.5 to 5 mole<br>
percent.<br>
Because the oxygen concentration decays so markedly toward the top of<br>
reaction medium 36, it is desirable that the demand for oxygen be reduced in the<br>
top of reaction medium 36. This reduced demand for oxygen near the top of<br>
reaction medium 36 can be accomplished by creating a vertical gradient in the<br>
concentration of the oxidizable compound (e.g., para-xylene), where the<br>
minimum concentration of oxidizable compound is located near the top of<br>
reaction medium 36.<br>
With respect to quantifying the oxidizable compound (e.g., para-xylene)<br>
concentration gradient, when reaction medium 36 is theoretically partitioned<br>
into 30 discrete horizontal slices of equal volume, an OC-max horizontal slice is<br>
identified as having the maximum oxidizable compound concentration of all the<br>
30 horizontal slices and an OC-min horizontal slice is identified as having the<br>
minimum oxidizable compound concentration of the horizontal slices located<br>
above the OC-max horizontal slice. The oxidizable compound concentrations<br>
of the horizontal slices are measured in the liquid phase on a time-averaged and<br>
volume-averaged mass fraction basis. It is preferred for the ratio of the<br>
oxidizable compound concentration of the OC-max horizontal slice to the<br>
oxidizable compound concentration of the OC-min horizontal slice to be greater<br>
than about 5:1, more preferably greater than about 10:1, still more preferably<br>
greater than about 20:1, and most preferably in the range of from 40:1 to<br>
1000:1.<br>
Typically, the OC-max horizontal slice will be located near the bottom<br>
of reaction medium 36, while the OC-min horizontal slice will be located near<br>
the top of reaction medium 36. Preferably, the OC-min horizontal slice is one<br>
of the 5 upper-most horizontal slices of the 30 discrete horizontal slices. Most<br>
preferably, the OC-min horizontal slice is the upper-most one of the 30 discrete<br>
horizontal slices, as illustrated in FIG. 28. Preferably, the OC-max horizontal<br>
slice is one of the 10 lower-most horizontal slices of the 30 discrete horizontal<br>
slices. Most preferably, the OC-max horizontal slice is one of the 5 lower-most<br>
horizontal slices of the 30 discrete horizontal slices. For example, FIG. 28<br>
illustrates the OC-max horizontal slice as the fifth horizontal slice from the<br>
bottom of reactor 20. It is preferred for the vertical spacing between the OCmin<br>
and OC-max horizontal slices to be at least about 2W, where "W" is the<br>
maximum width of reaction medium 36. More preferably, the vertical spacing<br>
between the OC-min and OC-max horizontal slices is at least about 4W, and<br>
most preferably at least 6W. Given a height "H" of reaction medium 36, it is<br>
preferred for the vertical spacing between the OC-min and OC-max horizontal<br>
slices to be at least about 0.2H, more preferably at least about 0.4H, and most<br>
preferably at least 0.6H.<br>
The time-averaged and volume-averaged oxidizable compound (e.g.,<br>
para-xylene) concentration in the liquid phase of the OC-min horizontal slice is<br>
preferably less than about 5,000 ppmw, more preferably less than about 2,000<br>
ppmw, still more preferably less than about 400 ppmw, and most preferably in<br>
the range of from 1 ppmw to 100 ppmw. The time-averaged and volumeaveraged<br>
oxidizable compound concentration in the liquid phase of the OC-max<br>
horizontal slice is preferably in the range of from about 100 ppmw to about<br>
10,000 ppmw, more preferably in the range of from about 200 ppmw to about<br>
5,000 ppmw, and most preferably in the range of from 500 ppmw to 3,000<br>
ppmw.<br>
Although it is preferred for bubble column reactor 20 to provide vertical<br>
gradients in the concentration of the oxidizable compound, it is also preferred<br>
that the volume percent of reaction medium 36 having an oxidizable compound<br>
concentration in the liquid phase above 1,000 ppmw be minimized. Preferably,<br>
the time-averaged volume percent of reaction medium 36 having an oxidizable<br>
compound concentration in the liquid phase above 1,000 ppmw is less than<br>
about 9 percent, more preferably less than about 6 percent, and most preferably<br>
less than 3 percent. Preferably, the time-averaged volume percent of reaction<br>
medium 36 having an oxidizable compound concentration in the liquid phase<br>
above 2,500 ppmw is less than about 1.5 percent, more preferably less than<br>
about 1 percent, and most preferably less than 0.5 percent. Preferably, the timeaveraged<br>
volume percent of reaction medium 36 having an oxidizable<br>
compound concentration in the liquid phase above 10,000 ppmw is less than<br>
about 0.3 percent, more preferably less than about 0.1 percent, and most<br>
preferably less than 0.03 percent. Preferably, the time-averaged volume percent<br>
of reaction medium 36 having an oxidizable compound concentration in the<br>
liquid phase above 25,000 ppmw is less than about 0.03 percent, more<br>
preferably less than about 0.015 percent, and most preferably less than 0.007<br>
percent. The inventors note that the volume of reaction medium 36 having the<br>
elevated levels of oxidizable compound need not lie in a single contiguous<br>
volume. At many times, the chaotic flow patterns in a bubble column reaction<br>
vessel produce simultaneously two or more continuous but segregated portions<br>
of reaction medium 36 having the elevated levels of oxidizable compound. At<br>
each time used in the time averaging, all such continuous but segregated<br>
volumes larger than 0.0001 volume percent of the total reaction medium are<br>
added together to determine the total volume having the elevated levels of<br>
oxidizable compound concentration in the liquid phase.<br>
In addition to the concentration gradients of oxygen and oxidizable<br>
compound, discussed above, it is preferred for a temperature gradient to exist in<br>
reaction medium 36. Referring again to FIG. 28, this temperature gradient can<br>
be quantified in a manner similar to the concentration gradients by theoretically<br>
partitioning reaction medium 36 into 30 discrete horizontal slices of equal<br>
volume and measuring the time-averaged and volume-averaged temperature of<br>
each slice. The horizontal slice with the lowest temperature out of the lowest 15<br>
horizontal slices can then be identified as the T-min horizontal slice, and the<br>
horizontal slice located above the T-min horizontal slice and having the<br>
maximum temperature of all the slices above the T-min horizontal slice can then<br>
be identified as the "T-max horizontal slice." It is preferred for the temperature<br>
of the T-max horizontal slice be at least about 1°C higher than the temperature<br>
of the T-min horizontal slice. More preferably the temperature of the T-max<br>
horizontal slice is in the range of from about 1.25 to about 12°C higher than the<br>
temperature of the T-min horizontal slice. Most preferably the temperature of<br>
the T-max horizontal slice is in the range of from 2 to 8°C higher than the<br>
temperature of the T-min horizontal slice. The temperature of the T-max<br>
horizontal slice is preferably in the range of from about 125 to about 200°C,<br>
more preferably in the range of from about 140 to about 180°C, and most<br>
preferably in the range of from 150 to 170°C.<br>
Typically, the T-max horizontal slice will be located near the center of<br>
reaction medium 36, while the T-min horizontal slice will be located near the<br>
bottom of reaction medium 36. Preferably, the T-min horizontal slice is one of<br>
the 10 lower-most horizontal slices of the 15 lowest horizontal slices. Most<br>
preferably, the T-min horizontal slice is one of the 5 lower-most horizontal<br>
slices of the 15 lowest horizontal slices. For example, FIG. 28 illustrates the Tmin<br>
horizontal slice as the second horizontal slice from the bottom of reactor<br>
20. Preferably, the T-max horizontal slice is one of the 20 middle horizontal<br>
slices of the 30 discrete horizontal slices. Most preferably, the T-min horizontal<br>
slice is one of the 14 middle horizontal slices of the 30 discrete horizontal<br>
slices. For example, FIG. 28 illustrates the T-max horizontal slice as the<br>
twentieth horizontal slice from the bottom of reactor 20 (i.e., one of the middle<br>
10 horizontal slices). It is preferred for the vertical spacing between the T-min<br>
and T-max horizontal slices to be at least about 2W, more preferably at least<br>
about 4W, and most preferably at least 6W. It is preferred for the vertical<br>
spacing between the T-min and T-max horizontal slices to be at least about<br>
0.2H, more preferably at least about 0.4H, and most preferably at least 0.6H.<br>
As discussed above, when a vertical temperature gradient exists in<br>
reaction medium 36, it can be advantageous to withdraw reaction medium 36 at<br>
an elevated location where the temperature of reaction medium is highest,<br>
especially when the withdrawn product is subjected to further downstream<br>
processing at higher temperatures. Thus, when reaction medium 36 is<br>
withdrawn from reaction zone 28 via one or more elevated outlets, as illustrated<br>
in FIGS. 19 and 20, it is preferred for the elevated outlet(s) to be located near<br>
the T-max horizontal slice. Preferably, the elevated outlet is located within 10<br>
horizontal slices of the T-max horizontal slice, more preferably within 5<br>
horizontal slices of the T-max horizontal slice, and most preferably within 2<br>
horizontal slices of the T-max horizontal slice.<br>
It is now noted that many of the inventive features described herein can<br>
be employed in multiple oxidation reactor systems - not just systems employing<br>
a single oxidation reactor. In addition, certain inventive features described<br>
herein can be employed in mechanically-agitated and/or flow-agitated oxidation<br>
reactors - not just bubble-agitated reactors (i.e., bubble column reactors). For<br>
example, the inventors have discovered certain advantages associated with<br>
staging/varying oxygen concentration and/or oxygen consumption rate<br>
throughout the reaction medium. The advantages realized by the staging of<br>
oxygen concentration/consumption in the reaction medium can be realized<br>
whether the total volume of the reaction medium is contained in a single vessel<br>
or in multiple vessels. Further, the advantages realized by the staging of oxygen<br>
concentration/consumption in the reaction medium can be realized whether the<br>
reaction vessel(s) is mechanically-agitated, flow-agitated, and/or bubbleagitated.<br>
One way of quantifying the degree of staging of oxygen concentration<br>
and/or consumption rate in a reaction medium is to compare two or more<br>
distinct 20-percent continuous volumes of the reaction medium. These 20-<br>
percent continuous volumes need not be defined by any particular shape.<br>
However, each 20-percent continuous volume must be formed of a contiguous<br>
volume of the reaction medium (i.e., each volume is "continuous"), and the 20-<br>
percent continuous volumes must not overlap one another (i.e., the volumes are<br>
"distinct"). FIGS. 29-31 illustrate that these distinct 20-percent continuous<br>
volumes can be located in the same reactor (FIG. 29) or in multiple reactors<br>
(FIGS. 30 and 31). It is noted that the reactors illustrated in FIGS. 29-31 can be<br>
mechanically-agitated, flow-agitated, and/or bubble-agitated reactors. In one<br>
embodiment, it is preferred for the reactors illustrated in FIGS. 29-31 to be<br>
bubble-agitated reactors (i.e., bubble column reactors).<br>
Referring now to FIG. 29, reactor 20 is illustrated as containing a<br>
reaction medium 36. Reaction medium 36 includes a first distinct 20-percent<br>
continuous volume 37 and a second distinct 20-percent continuous volume 39.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 30, a multiple reactor system is illustrated as<br>
including a first reactor 720a and a second reactor 720b. Reactors 720a,b<br>
cooperatively contain a total volume of a reaction medium 736. First reactor<br>
720a contains a first reaction medium portion 736a, while second reactor 720b<br>
contains a second reaction medium portion 736b. A first distinct 20-percent<br>
continuous volume 737 of reaction medium 736 is shown as being defined<br>
within first reactor 720a, while a second distinct 20-percent continuous volume<br>
739 of reaction medium 736 is shown as being defined within second reactor<br>
720b.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 31, a multiple reactor system is illustrated as<br>
including a first reactor 820a, a second reactor 820b, and a third reactor 820c.<br>
Reactors 820a,b,c cooperatively contain a total volume of a reaction medium<br>
836. First reactor 820a contains a first reaction medium portion 836a; second<br>
reactor 820b contains a second reaction medium portion 836b; and third reactor<br>
820c contains a third reaction medium portion 836c. A first distinct 20-percent<br>
continuous volume 837 of reaction medium 836 is shown as being defined<br>
within first reactor 820a; a second distinct 20-percent continuous volume 839 of<br>
reaction medium 836 is shown as being defined within second reactor 820b; and<br>
a third distinct 20-percent continuous volume 841 of reaction medium 836 is<br>
show as being defined within third reactor 820c.<br>
The staging of oxygen availability in the reaction medium can be<br>
quantified by referring to the 20-percent continuous volume of reaction medium<br>
having the most abundant mole fraction of oxygen in the gas phase and by<br>
referring to the 20-percent continuous volume of reaction medium having the<br>
most depleted mole fraction of oxygen in the gas phase. In the gas phase of the<br>
distinct 20-percent continuous volume of the reaction medium containing the<br>
highest concentration of oxygen in the gas phase, the time-averaged and<br>
volume-averaged oxygen concentration, on a wet basis, is preferably in the<br>
range of from about 3 to about 18 mole percent, more preferably in the range of<br>
from about 3.5 to about 14 mole percent, and most preferably in the range of<br>
from 4 to 10 mole percent. In the gas phase of the distinct 20-percent<br>
continuous volume of the reaction medium containing the lowest concentration<br>
of oxygen in the gas phase, the time-averaged and volume-averaged oxygen<br>
concentration, on a wet basis, is preferably in the range of from about 0.3 to<br>
about 5 mole percent, more preferably in the range of from about 0.6 to about 4<br>
mole percent, and most preferably in the range of from 0.9 to 3 mole percent.<br>
Furthermore, the ratio of the time-averaged and volume-averaged oxygen<br>
concentration, on a wet basis, in the most abundant 20-percent continuous<br>
volume of reaction medium compared to the most depleted 20-percent<br>
continuous volume of reaction medium is preferably in the range of from about<br>
1.5:1 to about 20:1, more preferably in the range of from about 2:1 to about<br>
12:1, and most preferably in the range o f from 3:1 to 9:1.<br>
The staging of oxygen consumption rate in the reaction medium can be<br>
quantified in terms of an oxygen-STR, initially described above. Oxygen-STR<br>
was previously describe in a global sense (i.e., from the perspective of the<br>
average oxygen-STR of the entire reaction medium); however, oxygen-STR<br>
may also be considered in a local sense (i.e., a portion of the reaction medium)<br>
in order to quantify staging of the oxygen consumption rate throughout the<br>
reaction medium.<br>
The inventors have discovered that it is very useful to cause the oxygen-<br>
STR to vary throughout the reaction medium in general harmony with the<br>
desirable gradients disclosed herein relating to pressure in the reaction medium<br>
and to the mole fraction of molecular oxygen in the gas phase of the reaction<br>
medium. Thus, it is preferable that the ratio of the oxygen-STR of a first<br>
distinct 20-percent continuous volume of the reaction medium compared to the<br>
oxygen-STR of a second distinct 20-percent continuous volume of the reaction<br>
medium be in the range of from about 1.5:1 to about 20:1, more preferably in<br>
the range of from about 2:1 to about 12:1, and most preferably in the range of<br>
from 3:1 to 9:1. In one embodiment the "first distinct 20-percent continuous<br>
volume" is located closer than the "second distinct 20-percent continuous<br>
volume" to the location where molecular oxygen is initially introduced into the<br>
reaction medium. These large gradients in oxygen-STR are desirable whether<br>
the partial oxidation reaction medium is contained in a bubble column oxidation<br>
reactor or in any other type of reaction vessel in which gradients are created in<br>
pressure and/or mole fraction of molecular oxygen in the gas phase of the<br>
reaction medium (e.g., in a mechanically agitated vessel having multiple,<br>
vertically disposed stirring zones achieved by using multiple impellers having<br>
strong radial flow, possibly augmented by generally horizontal baffle<br>
assemblies, with oxidant flow rising generally upwards from a feed near the<br>
lower portion of the reaction vessel, notwithstanding that considerable backmixing<br>
of oxidant flow may occur within each vertically disposed stirring zone<br>
and that some back-mixing of oxidant flow may occur between adjacent<br>
vertically disposed stirring zones). That is, when a gradient exists in the<br>
pressure and/or mole fraction of molecular oxygen in the gas phase of the<br>
reaction medium, the inventors have discovered that it is desirable to create a<br>
similar gradient in the chemical demand for dissolved oxygen by the means<br>
disclosed herein.<br>
A preferred means of causing the local oxygen-STR to vary is by<br>
controlling the locations of feeding the oxidizable compound and by controlling<br>
the mixing of the liquid phase of the reaction medium to control gradients in<br>
concentration of oxidizable compound according to other disclosures of the<br>
present invention. Other useful means of causing the local oxygen-STR to vary<br>
include causing variation in reaction activity by causing local temperature<br>
variation and by changing the local mixture of catalyst and solvent components<br>
(e.g., by introducing an additional gas to cause evaporative cooling in a<br>
particular portion of the reaction medium and by adding a solvent stream<br>
containing a higher amount of water to decrease activity in a particular portion<br>
of the reaction medium).<br>
As discussed above with reference to FIGS. 30 and 31, the partial<br>
oxidation reaction can be usefully conducted in multiple reaction vessels<br>
wherein at least a portion, preferably at least 25 percent, more preferably at least<br>
50 percent, and most preferable at least 75 percent, of the molecular oxygen<br>
exiting from a first reaction vessel is conducted to one or more subsequent<br>
reaction vessels for consumption of an additional increment, preferably more<br>
than 10 percent, more preferably more than 20 percent, and most preferably<br>
more than 40 percent, of the molecular oxygen exiting the first/upstream<br>
reaction vessel. When using such a series flow of molecular oxygen from one<br>
reactor to others, it is desirable that the first reaction vessel is operated with a<br>
higher reaction intensity than at least one of the subsequent reaction vessels,<br>
preferably with the ratio of the vessel-average-oxygen-STR within the first<br>
reaction vessel to the vessel-average-oxygen-STR within the subsequent<br>
reaction vessel in the range of from about 1.5:1 to about 20:1, more preferably<br>
in the range of from about 2:1 to about 12:1, and most preferably in the range of<br>
from 3:1 to 9:1.<br>
As discussed above, all types of first reaction vessel (e.g.; bubble<br>
column, mechanically-agitated, back-mixed, internally staged, plug flow, and so<br>
on) and all types of subsequent reaction vessels, which may or not be of<br>
different type than the first reaction vessel, are useful for series flow of<br>
molecular oxygen to subsequent reaction vessels with according to the present<br>
invention. The means of causing the vessel-average-oxygen-STR to decline<br>
within subsequent reaction vessels usefully include reduced temperature,<br>
reduced concentrations of oxidizable compound, and reduced reaction activity<br>
of the particular mixture of catalytic components and solvent (e.g., reduced<br>
concentration of cobalt, increased concentration of water, and addition of a<br>
catalytic retardant such as small quantities of ionic copper).<br>
In flowing from the first reaction vessel to a subsequent reaction vessel,<br>
the oxidant stream may be treated by any means known in the art such as<br>
compression or pressure reduction, cooling or heating, and removing mass or<br>
adding mass of any amount or any type. However, the use of declining vesselaverage-<br>
oxygen-STR in subsequent reaction vessels is particularly useful when<br>
the absolute pressure in the upper portion of the first reaction vessel is less than<br>
about 2.0 megapascal, more preferably less than about 1.6 megapascal, and<br>
most preferably less than 1.2 megapascal. Furthermore, the use of declining<br>
vessel-average-oxygen-STR in subsequent reaction vessels is particularly useful<br>
when the ratio of the absolute pressure in the upper portion of the first reaction<br>
vessel compared to the absolute pressure in the upper portion of at least one<br>
subsequent reaction vessel is in the range from about 0.5:1 to 6:1, more<br>
preferably in a range from about 0.6:1 to about 4:1, and most preferably in a<br>
range from 0.7:1 to 2:1. Pressure reductions in subsequent vessels below these<br>
lower bounds overly reduce the availability of molecular oxygen, and pressure<br>
increases above these upper bounds are increasingly costly compared to using a<br>
fresh supply of oxidant.<br>
When using series flow of molecular oxygen to subsequent reaction<br>
vessels having declining vessel-average-oxygen-STR, fresh feed streams of<br>
oxidizable compound, solvent and oxidant may flow into subsequent reaction<br>
vessels and/or into the first reaction vessel. Flows of the liquid phase and the<br>
solid phase, if present, of the reaction medium may flow in any direction<br>
between reaction vessels. All or part of the gas phase leaving the first reaction<br>
vessel and entering a subsequent reaction vessel may flow separated from or<br>
commingled with portions of the liquid phase or the solid phase, if present, of<br>
the reaction medium from the first reaction vessel. A flow of product stream<br>
comprising liquid phase and solid phase, if present, may be withdrawn from the<br>
reaction medium in any reaction vessel in the system.<br>
Referring again to FIGS. 1-31, oxidation is preferably carried out in<br>
bubble column reactor 20 under conditions that are markedly different,<br>
according to preferred embodiments disclosed herein, than conventional<br>
oxidation reactors. When bubble column reactor 20 is used to carry out the<br>
liquid-phase partial oxidation of para-xylene to crude terephthalic acid (CTA)<br>
according to preferred embodiments disclosed herein, the spatial profiles of<br>
local reaction intensity, of local evaporation intensity, and of local temperature<br>
combined with the liquid flow patterns within the reaction medium and the<br>
preferred, relatively low oxidation temperatures contribute to the formation of<br>
CTA particles having unique and advantageous properties.<br>
FIGS. 32A and 32B illustrate base CTA particles produced in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 32 A shows the<br>
base CTA particles at 500 times magnification, while FIG. 32B zooms in on one<br>
of the base CTA particles and shows that particle at 2,000 times magnification.<br>
As perhaps best illustrated in FIG. 32B, each base CTA particle is typically<br>
formed of a large number of small, agglomerated CTA subparticles, thereby<br>
giving the base CTA particle a relatively high surface area, high porosity, low<br>
density, and good dissolvability. The base CTA particles typically have a mean<br>
particle size in the range of from about 20 to about 150 microns, more<br>
preferably in the range of from about 30 to about 120 microns, and most<br>
preferably in the range of from 40 to 90 microns. The CTA subparticles<br>
typically have a mean particle size in the range of from about 0.5 to about 30<br>
microns, more preferably from about 1 to about 15 microns, and most<br>
preferably in the range of from 2 to 5 microns. The relatively high surface area<br>
of the base CTA particles illustrated in FIGS. 32A and 32B, can be quantified<br>
using a Braunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurement method.<br>
Preferably, the base CTA particles have an average BET surface of at least<br>
about 0.6 meters squared per gram (m2/g). More preferably, the base CTA<br>
particles have an average BET surface area in the range of from about 0.8 to<br>
about 4 m2/g. Most preferably, the base CTA particles have an average BET<br>
surface area in the range of from 0.9 to 2 m.2/g. The physical properties (e.g.,<br>
particle size, BET surface area, porosity, and dissolvability) of the base CTA<br>
particles formed by optimized oxidation process of a preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention permit purification of the CTA particles by more effective<br>
and/or economical methods, as described in further detail below with respect to<br>
FIG. 35.<br>
The mean particle size values provided above were determined using<br>
polarized light microscopy and image analysis. The equipment employed in the<br>
particle size analysis included a Nikon E800 optical microscope with a 4x Plan<br>
Flour N.A. 0.13 objective, a Spot RT™ digital camera, and a personal computer<br>
running Image Pro Plus™ V4.5.0.19 image analysis software. The particle size<br>
analysis method included the following main steps: (1) dispersing the CTA<br>
powders in mineral oil; (2) preparing a microscope slide/cover slip of the<br>
dispersion; (3) examining the slide using polarized light microscopy (crossed<br>
polars condition - particles appear as bright objects on black background); (4)<br>
capturing different images for each sample preparation (field size - 3 x 2.25<br>
mm; pixel size = 1.84 microns/pixel); (5) performing image analysis with Image<br>
Pro Plus software; (6) exporting the particle measures to a spreadsheet; and<br>
(7) performing statistical characterization in the spreadsheet. Step (5) of<br>
"performing image analysis with Image Pro Plus™ software" included the<br>
substeps of: (a) setting the image threshold to detect white particles on dark<br>
background; (b) creating a binary image; (c) running a single-pass open filter to<br>
filter out pixel noise; (d) measuring all particles in the image; and (e) reporting<br>
75<br>
the mean diameter measured for each particle. The Image Pro Plus™ software<br>
defines mean diameter of individual particles as the number average length of<br>
diameters of a particle measured at 2 degree intervals and passing through the<br>
particle's centroid. Step 7 of "performing statistical characterization in the<br>
spreadsheet" comprises calculating the volume-weighted mean particle size as<br>
follows. The volume of each of the n particles in a sample is calculated as if it<br>
were spherical using pi/6 * djA3; multiplying the volume of each particle times<br>
its diameter to find pi/6 * djA4; summing for all particles in the sample of the<br>
values of pi/6 * djA4; summing the volumes of all particles in the sample; and<br>
calculating the volume-weighted particle diameter as sum for all n particles in<br>
the sample of (pi/6 *djA4) divided by sum for all n particles in the sample of<br>
(pi/6 * djA3). As used herein, "mean particle size" refers to the volumeweighted<br>
mean particle size determined according to the above-described test<br>
method; and it is also referred to as D(4,3).<br>
In addition, step 7 comprises finding the particle sizes for which various<br>
fractions of the total sample volume are smaller. For example, D(v,0.1) is the<br>
particle size for which 10 percent of the total sample volume is smaller and 90<br>
percent is larger; D(v,0.5) is the particle size for which one-half of the sample<br>
volume is larger and one-half is smaller; D(v,0.9) is the particle size for which<br>
90 percent of the total sample volume is smaller; and so on. In addition, step 7<br>
comprises calculating the value of D(v,0.9) minus D(v,0.1), which is herein<br>
defined as the "particle size spread"; and step 7 comprises calculating the value<br>
of the particle size spread divided by D(4,3), which is herein defined as the<br>
"particle size relative spread."<br>
Furthermore, it is preferable that the D(v,0.1) of the CTA particles as<br>
measured above be in the range from about 5 to about 65 microns, more<br>
preferably in the range from about 15 to about 55 microns and most preferably<br>
in the range from 25 to 45 microns. It is preferable that the D(v,0.5) of the CTA<br>
particles as measured above be in the range from about 10 to about 90 microns,<br>
more preferably in the range from about 20 to about 80 microns, and most<br>
preferably in the range from 30 to 70 microns. It is preferable that the D(v,0.9)<br>
of the CTA particles as measured above be in the range from about 30 to about<br>
150 microns, more preferably in the range from about 40 to about 130 microns,<br>
and most preferably in the range from 50 to 110 microns. It is preferable that<br>
the particle size relative spread be in the range from about 0.5 to about 2.0,<br>
more preferably in the range from about 0.6 to about 1.5, and most preferably in<br>
the range from 0.7 to 1.3.<br>
The BET surface area values provided above were measured on a<br>
Micromeritics ASAP2000 (available from Micromeritics Instrument<br>
Corporation of Norcross, GA). In the first step of the measurement process, a 2<br>
to 4 gram of sample of the particles was weighed and dried under vacuum at<br>
50°C. The sample was then placed on the analysis gas manifold and cooled to<br>
77°K. A nitrogen adsorption isotherm was measured at a minimum of 5<br>
equilibrium pressures by exposing the sample to known volumes of nitrogen gas<br>
and measuring the pressure decline. The equilibrium pressures were<br>
appropriately in the range of P/P0 = 0.01-0.20, where P is equilibrium pressure<br>
and PO is vapor pressure of liquid nitrogen at 77°K. The resulting isotherm was<br>
then plotted according to the following BET equation:<br>
P 1 C-l( PVa(Po-P} VmC V,nC\Po)<br>
where Va is volume of gas adsorbed by sample at P, Vm is volume of gas<br>
required to cover the entire surface of the sample with a monolayer of gas, and<br>
C is a constant. From this plot, Vmand C were determined. Vm was then<br>
converted to a surface area using the cross sectional area of nitrogen at 77°K by:<br>
RT<br>
where a is cross sectional area of nitrogen at 77°K, T is 77°K, and R is the gas<br>
constant.<br>
As alluded to above, CTA formed in accordance with one embodiment<br>
of the present invention exhibits superior dissolution properties verses<br>
conventional CTA made by other processes. This enhanced dissolution rate<br>
allows the inventive CTA to be purified by more efficient and/or more effective<br>
purification processes. The following description addresses the manner in which<br>
the rate of dissolution of CTA can quantified.<br>
The rate of dissolution of a known amount of solids into a known<br>
amount of solvent in an agitated mixture can be measured by various protocols.<br>
As used herein, a measurement method called the "timed dissolution test" is<br>
defined as follows. An ambient pressure of about 0.1 megapascal is used<br>
throughout the timed dissolution test. The ambient temperature used throughout<br>
the timed dissolution test is about 22°C. Furthermore, the solids, solvent and all<br>
dissolution apparatus are fully equilibrated thermally at this temperature before<br>
beginning testing, and there is no appreciable heating or cooling of the beaker or<br>
its contents during the dissolution time period. A solvent portion of fresh,<br>
HPLC analytical grade of tetrahydrofuran (&gt;99.9 percent purity), hereafter THF,<br>
measuring 250 grams is placed into a cleaned KIMAX tall form 400 milliliter<br>
glass beaker (Kimble® part number 14020, Kimble / Kontes, Vineland, NJ),<br>
which is uninsulated, smooth-sided, and generally cylindrical in form. A<br>
Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar (VWR part number 58948-230, about 1-<br>
inch long with 3/8-inch diameter, octagonal cross section, VWR International,<br>
West Chester, PA 19380) is placed in the beaker, where it naturally settles to the<br>
bottom. The sample is stirred using a Variomag® multipoint 15 magnetic<br>
stirrer (H&amp;P Labortechnik AG, Oberschleissheim, Germany) magnetic stirrer at<br>
a setting of 800 revolutions per minute. This stirring begins no more than 5<br>
minutes before the addition of solids and continues steadily for at least 30<br>
minutes after adding the solids. A solid sample of crude or purified TPA<br>
particulates amounting to 250 milligrams is weighed into a non-sticking sample<br>
weighing pan. At a starting time designated as t=0, the weighed solids are<br>
poured all at once into the stirred THF, and a timer is started simultaneously.<br>
Properly done, the THF very rapidly wets the solids and forms a dilute, wellagitated<br>
slurry within 5 seconds. Subsequently, samples of this mixture are<br>
obtained at the following times, measured in minutes from t=0: 0.08, 0.25, 0.50,<br>
0.75, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00, 2.50, 3.00, 4.00, 5.00, 6.00, 8.00,10.00, 15.00, and 30.00.<br>
Each small sample is withdrawn from the dilute, well-agitated mixture using a<br>
new, disposable syringe (Becton, Dickinson and Co, 5 milliliter, REF 30163,<br>
Franklin Lakes, NJ 07417). Immediately upon withdrawal from the beaker,<br>
approximately 2 milliliters of clear liquid sample is rapidly discharged through<br>
a new, unused syringe filter (25mm diameter, 0.45 micron, Gelman GHP<br>
Acrodisc GF®, Pall Corporation, East Hills, NY 11548) into a new, labeled<br>
glass sample vial. The duration of each syringe filling, filter placement, and<br>
discharging into a sample vial is correctly less than about 5 seconds, and this<br>
interval is appropriately started and ended within about 3 seconds either side of<br>
each target sampling time. Within about five minutes of each filling, the sample<br>
vials are capped shut and maintained at approximately constant temperature<br>
until performing the following chemical analysis. After the final sample is<br>
taken at a time of 30 minutes past t=0, all sixteen samples are analyzed for the<br>
amount of dissolved TPA using a HPLC-DAD method generally as described<br>
elsewhere within this disclosure. However, in the present test, the calibration<br>
standards and the results reported are both based upon milligrams of dissolved<br>
TPA per gram of THF solvent (hereafter "ppm in THF"). For example, if all of<br>
the 250 milligrams of solids were very pure TPA and if this entire amount fully<br>
dissolved in the 250 grams of THF solvent before a particular sample were<br>
taken, the correctly measured concentration would be about 1,000 ppm in THF.<br>
When CTA according to the present invention is subjected to the timed<br>
dissolution test described above, it is preferred that a sample taken at one<br>
minute past t=0 dissolves to a concentration of at least about 500 ppm in THF,<br>
more preferably to at least 600 ppm in THF. For a sample taken at two minutes<br>
past t=0, it is preferred that CTA according to the current invention will<br>
dissolve to a concentration of at least about 700 ppm in THF, more preferably to<br>
at least 750 ppm in THF. For a sample taken at four minutes past t=0, it is<br>
preferred that CTA according to the current invention will dissolve to a<br>
concentration of at least about 840 ppm in THF, more preferably to at least 880<br>
ppm in THF.<br>
The inventors have found that a relatively simple negative exponential<br>
growth model is useful to describe the time dependence of the entire data set<br>
from a complete timed dissolution test, notwithstanding the complexity of the<br>
particulate samples and of the dissolution process. The form of the equation,<br>
hereinafter the "timed dissolution model", is as follows:<br>
S = A + B*(1- exp(-C * t)), where<br>
t = time in units of minutes;<br>
S = solubility, in units of ppm in THF, at time t;<br>
exp = exponential function in the base of the natural logarithm of<br>
2;<br>
A, B = regressed constants in units of ppm in THF, where A<br>
relates mostly to the rapid dissolution of the smaller<br>
particles at very short times, and where the sum of A + B<br>
relates mostly to the total amount of dissolution near the<br>
end of the specified testing period; and<br>
C = a regressed time constant in units of reciprocal minutes.<br>
The regressed constants are adjusted to minimize the sum of the squares<br>
of the errors between the actual data points and the corresponding model values,<br>
which method is commonly called a "least squares" fit. A preferred software<br>
package for executing this data regression is JMP Release 5.1.2 (SAS Institute<br>
Inc., JMP Software, SAS Campus Drive, Gary, NC 27513).<br>
When CTA according to the present invention is tested with the timed<br>
dissolution test and fitted to the timed dissolution model described above, it is<br>
preferred for the CTA to have a time constant "C" greater than about 0.5<br>
reciprocal minutes, more preferably greater than about 0.6 reciprocal minutes,<br>
and most preferably greater than 0.7 reciprocal minutes.<br>
FIGS. 33A and 33B illustrate a conventional CTA particle made by a<br>
conventional high-temperature oxidation process in a continuous stirred tank<br>
reactor (CSTR). FIG. 33A shows the conventional CTA particle at 500 times<br>
magnification, while FIG. 33B zooms in and shows the CTA particle at 2,000<br>
times magnification. A visual comparison of the inventive CTA particles<br>
illustrated in FIGS. 32A and 32B and the conventional CTA particle illustrated<br>
in FIGS. 33A and 33B shows that the conventional CTA particle has a higher<br>
density, lower surface area, lower porosity, and larger particle size than the<br>
inventive CTA particles, hi fact, the conventional CTA represented in FIGS.<br>
33A and 33B has a mean particle size of about 205 microns and a BET surface<br>
area of about 0.57 m2/g.<br>
FIG. 34 illustrates a conventional process for making purified<br>
terephthalic acid (PTA). In the conventional PTA process, para-xylene is<br>
partially oxidized in a mechanically agitated high temperature oxidation reactor<br>
700. A slurry comprising CTA is withdrawn from reactor 700 and then purified<br>
in a purification system 702. The PTA product of purification system 702 is<br>
introduced into a separation system 706 for separation and drying of the PTA<br>
particles. Purification system 702 represents a large portion of the costs<br>
associated with producing PTA particles by conventional methods. Purification<br>
system 702 generally includes a water addition/exchange system 708, a<br>
dissolution system 710, a hydrogenation system 712, and three separate<br>
crystallization vessels 704a,b,c. In water addition/exchange system 708, a<br>
substantial portion of the mother liquor is displaced with water. After water<br>
addition, the water/CTA slurry is introduced into the dissolution system 710<br>
where the water/CTA mixture is heated until the CTA particles fully dissolve in<br>
the water. After CTA dissolution, the CTA-in-water solution is subjected to<br>
hydrogenation in hydrogenation system 712. The hydrogenated effluent from<br>
hydrogenation system 712 is then subjected to three crystallization steps in<br>
crystallization vessels 704a,b,c, followed by PTA separation in separation<br>
system 706.<br>
FIG. 35 illustrates an improved process for producing PTA employing a<br>
bubble column oxidation reactor 800 configured in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. An initial slurry comprising solid CTA<br>
particles and a liquid mother liquor is withdrawn from reactor 800. Typically,<br>
the initial slurry may contain in the range of from about 10 to about 50 weight<br>
percent solid CTA particles, with the balance being liquid mother liquor. The<br>
solid CTA particles present in the initial slurry typically contain at least about<br>
400 ppmw of 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (4-CBA), more typically at least about<br>
800 ppmw of 4-CBA, and most typically in the range of from 1,000 to 15,000<br>
ppmw of 4-CBA. The initial slurry withdrawn from reactor 800 is introduced<br>
into a purification system 802 to reduce the concentration of 4-CBA and other<br>
impurities present in the CTA. A purer/purified slurry is produced from<br>
purification system 802 and is subjected to separation and drying in a separation<br>
system 804 to thereby produce purer solid terephthalic acid particles comprising<br>
less than about 400 ppmw of 4-CBA, more preferably less than about 250<br>
ppmw of 4-CBA, and most preferably in the range of from 10 to 200 ppmw of<br>
4-CBA.<br>
Purification system 802 of the PTA production system illustrated in FIG.<br>
35 provides a number of advantages over purification system 802 of the prior<br>
art system illustrated in FIG. 34. Preferably, purification system 802 generally<br>
includes a liquor exchange system 806, a digester 808, and a single crystallizer<br>
810. In liquor exchange system 806, at least about 50 weight percent of the<br>
mother liquor present in the initial slurry is replaced with a fresh replacement<br>
solvent to thereby provide a solvent-exchanged slurry comprising CTA particles<br>
and the replacement solvent. The solvent-exchanged slurry exiting liquor<br>
exchange system 806 is introduced into digester (or secondary oxidation<br>
reactor) 808. In digester 808, a secondary oxidation reaction is preformed at<br>
slightly higher temperatures than were used in the initial/primary oxidation<br>
reaction carried out in bubble column reactor 800. As discussed above, the high<br>
surface area, small particle size, and low density of the CTA particles produced<br>
in reactor 800 cause certain impurities trapped in the CTA particles to become<br>
available for oxidation in digester 808 without requiring complete dissolution of<br>
the CTA particles in digester 808. Thus, the temperature in digester 808 can be<br>
lower than many similar prior art processes. The secondary oxidation carried<br>
out in digester 808 preferably reduces the concentration of 4-CBA in the CTA<br>
by at least 200 ppmw, more preferably at least about 400 ppmw, and most<br>
preferably in the range of from 600 to 6,000 ppmw. Preferably, the secondary<br>
oxidation temperature in digester 808 is at least about 10°C higher than the<br>
primary oxidation temperature in bubble column reactor 800, more preferably<br>
about 20 to about 80°C higher than the primary oxidation temperature in reactor<br>
800, and most preferably 30 to 50°C higher than the primary oxidation<br>
temperature in reactor 800. The secondary oxidation temperature is preferably<br>
in the range of from about 160 to about 240°C, more preferably in the range of<br>
from about 180 to about 220°C and most preferably in the range of from 190 to<br>
210°C. The purified product from digester 808 requires only a single<br>
crystallization step in crystallizer 810 prior to separation in separation system<br>
804. Suitable secondary oxidation/digestion techniques are discussed in further<br>
detail in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2005/0065373, the entire disclosure of which<br>
is expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Terephthalic acid (e.g., PTA) produced by the system illustrated in FIG.<br>
35 is preferably formed of PTA particles having a mean particle size of at least<br>
about 40 microns, more preferably in the range of from about 50 to about 2,000<br>
microns, and most preferably in the range of from 60 to 200 microns. The PTA<br>
particles preferably have an average BET surface area less than about 0.25 m2/g,<br>
more preferably in the range of from about 0.005 to about 0.2 m2/g, and most<br>
preferably in the range of from 0.01 to 0.18 m2/g. PTA produced by the system<br>
illustrated in FIG. 35 is suitable for use as a feedstock in the making of PET.<br>
Typically, PET is made via esterification of terephthalic with ethylene glycol,<br>
followed by polycondensation. Preferably, terephthalic acid produced by an<br>
embodiment of the present invention is employed as a feed to the pipe reactor<br>
PET process described in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/013,318, filed<br>
December 7, 2001, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
CTA particles with the preferred morphology disclosed herein are<br>
particularly useful in the above-described oxidative digestion process for<br>
reduction of 4-CBA content. In addition, these preferred CTA particles provide<br>
advantages in a wide range of other post-processes involving dissolution and/or<br>
chemical reaction of the particles. These additional post-processes include, but<br>
are not limited too, reaction with at least one hydroxyl-containing compound to<br>
form ester compounds, especially the reaction of CTA with methanol to form<br>
dimethyl terephthalate and impurity esters; reaction with at least one diol to<br>
form ester monomer and/or polymer compounds, especially the reaction of CTA<br>
with ethylene glycol to form polyethylene terephthalate (PET); and full or<br>
partial dissolution in solvents, including, but not limited too, water, acetic acid,<br>
and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, which may include further processing, including,<br>
but not limited too, reprecipitation of a more pure terephthalic acid and/or<br>
selective chemical reduction of carbonyl groups other than carboxylic acid<br>
groups. Notably included is the substantial dissolution of CTA in a solvent<br>
comprising water coupled with partial hydrogenation that reduces the amount of<br>
aldehydes, especially 4-CBA, fluorenones, phenones, and/or anthraquinones.<br>
The inventors also contemplate that CTA particles having the preferred<br>
properties disclosed herein can be produced from CTA particles not conforming<br>
to the preferred properties disclosed herein (non-conforming CTA particles) by<br>
means including, but not limited too, mechanical comminution of nonconforming<br>
CTA particles and full or partial dissolution of non-conforming<br>
CTA particles followed by full or partial re-precipitation.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a process for partially oxidizing an oxidizable aromatic compound to<br>
one or more types of aromatic carboxylic acid wherein the purity of the solvent<br>
portion of the feed (i.e., the "solvent feed") and the purity of the oxidizable<br>
compound portion of the feed (i.e., the "oxidizable compound feed") are<br>
controlled within certain ranges specified below. Along with other<br>
embodiments of the present invention, this enables the purity of the liquid phase<br>
and, if present, the solid phase and the combined slurry (i.e., solid plus liquid)<br>
phase of the reaction medium to be controlled in certain preferred ranges,<br>
outlined below.<br>
With respect to the solvent feed, it is known to oxidize an oxidizable<br>
aromatic compound(s) to produce an aromatic carboxylic acid wherein the<br>
solvent feed introduced into the reaction medium is a mixture of analyticalpurity<br>
acetic acid and water, as is often employed at laboratory scale and pilot<br>
scale. Likewise, it is known to conduct the oxidation of oxidizable aromatic<br>
compound to aromatic carboxylic acid wherein the solvent leaving the reaction<br>
medium is separated from the produced aromatic carboxylic acid and then<br>
recycled back to the reaction medium as feed solvent, primarily for reasons of<br>
manufacturing cost. This solvent recycling causes certain feed impurities and<br>
process by-products to accumulate over time in the recycled solvent. Various<br>
means are known in the art to help purify recycled solvent before reintroduction<br>
into the reaction medium. Generally, a higher degree of<br>
purification of the recycled solvent leads to significantly higher manufacturing<br>
cost than does a lower degree of purification by similar means. One<br>
embodiment of the present invention relates to understanding and defining the<br>
preferred ranges of a large number of impurities within the solvent feed, many<br>
of which were heretofore thought largely benign, in order to find an optimal<br>
balance between overall manufacturing cost and overall product purity.<br>
"Recycled solvent feed" is defined herein as solvent feed comprising at<br>
least about 5 weight percent mass that has previously passed through a reaction<br>
medium containing one or more oxidizable aromatic compounds undergoing<br>
partial oxidation. For reasons of solvent inventory and of on-stream time in a<br>
manufacturing unit, it is preferable that portions of recycled solvent pass<br>
through reaction medium at least once per day of operation, more preferably at<br>
least once per day for at least seven consecutive days of operation, and most<br>
preferably at least once per day for at least 30 consecutive days of operation.<br>
For economic reasons, it is preferable that at least about 20 weight percent of<br>
the solvent feed to the reaction medium of the present invention is recycled<br>
solvent, more preferably at least about 40 weight percent, still more preferably<br>
at least about 80 weight percent, and most preferably at least 90 weight percent.<br>
The inventors have discovered that, for reasons of reaction activity and<br>
for consideration of metallic impurities left in the oxidation product, the<br>
concentrations of selected multivalent metals within the recycled solvent feed<br>
are preferably in ranges specified immediately below. The concentration of iron<br>
in recycled solvent is preferably below about 150 ppmw, more preferably below<br>
about 40 ppmw, and most preferably between 0 and 8 ppmw. The<br>
concentration of nickel in recycled solvent is preferably below about 150 ppmw,<br>
more preferably below about 40 ppmw, and most preferably between 0 and 8<br>
ppmw. The concentration of chromium in recycled solvent is preferably below<br>
about 150 ppmw, more preferably below about 40 ppmw, and most preferably<br>
between 0 and 8 ppmw. The concentration of molybdenum in recycled solvent<br>
is preferably below about 75 ppmw, more preferably below about 20 ppmw, and<br>
most preferably between 0 and 4 ppmw. The concentration of titanium in<br>
recycled solvent is preferably below about 75 ppmw, more preferably below<br>
about 20 ppmw, and most preferably between 0 and 4 ppmw. The<br>
concentration of copper in recycled solvent is preferably below about 20 ppmw,<br>
more preferably below about 4 ppmw, and most preferably between 0 and 1<br>
ppmw. Other metallic impurities are also typically present in recycled solvent,<br>
generally varying at lower levels in proportion to one or more of the above<br>
listed metals. Controlling the above listed metals in the preferred ranges will<br>
keep other metallic impurities at suitable levels.<br>
These metals can arise as impurities in any of the incoming process<br>
feeds (e.g., in incoming oxidizable compound, solvent, oxidant, and catalyst<br>
compounds). Alternatively, the metals can arise as corrosion products from any<br>
of the process units contacting reaction medium and/or contacting recycled<br>
solvent. The means for controlling the metals in the disclosed concentration<br>
ranges include the appropriate specification and monitoring of the purity of<br>
various feeds and the appropriate usage of materials of construction, including,<br>
but not limited to, many commercial grades of titanium and of stainless steels<br>
including those grades known as duplex stainless steels and high molybdenum<br>
stainless steels.<br>
The inventors have also discovered preferred ranges for selected<br>
aromatic compounds in the recycled solvent. These include both precipitated<br>
and dissolved aromatic compounds within the recycled solvent.<br>
Surprisingly, even precipitated product (e.g., TPA) from a partial<br>
oxidation of para-xylene, is a contaminant to be managed in recycled solvent.<br>
Because there are surprisingly preferred ranges for the levels of solids within<br>
the reaction medium, any precipitated product in the solvent feed directly<br>
subtracts from the amount of oxidizable compound that can be fed in concert.<br>
Furthermore, feeding precipitated TPA solids in the recycled solvent at elevated<br>
levels has been discovered to affect adversely the character of the particles<br>
formed within a precipitating oxidation medium, leading to undesirable<br>
character in downstream operations (e.g., product filtration, solvent washing,<br>
oxidative digestion of crude product, dissolution of crude product for further<br>
processing, and so on). Another undesirable characteristic of precipitated<br>
solids in the recycle solvent feed is that these often contain very high levels of<br>
precipitated impurities, as compared to impurity concentrations in the bulk of<br>
the solids within the TPA slurries from which much of the recycled solvent is<br>
obtained. Possibly, the elevated levels of impurities observed in solids<br>
suspended in recycled filtrate may relate to nucleation times for precipitation of<br>
certain impurities from the recycled solvent and/or to cooling of the recycled<br>
solvent, whether intentional or due to ambient losses. For example,<br>
concentrations of highly-colored and undesirable 2,6-dicarboxyfluorenone have<br>
been observed at far higher levels in solids present in recycled solvent at 80°C<br>
than are observed in TPA solids separated from recycled solvent at 160°C.<br>
Similarly, concentrations of isophthalic acid have been observed at much higher<br>
levels in solids present in recycled solvent compared to levels observed in TPA<br>
solids from the reaction medium. Exactly how specific precipitated impurities<br>
entrained within recycled solvent behave when re-introduced to the reaction<br>
medium appears to vary. This depends perhaps upon the relative solubility of<br>
the impurity within the liquid phase of the reaction medium, perhaps upon how<br>
the precipitated impurity is layered within the precipitated solids, and perhaps<br>
upon the local rate of TPA precipitation where the solid first re-enters the<br>
reaction medium. Thus, the inventors have found it useful to control the level<br>
of certain impurities in the recycled solvent, as disclosed below, without respect<br>
to whether these impurities are present in the recycled solvent in dissolved form<br>
or are entrained particulates therein.<br>
The amount of precipitated solids present in recycled filtrate is<br>
determined by a gravimetric method as follows. A representative sample is<br>
withdrawn from the solvent supply to the reaction medium while the solvent is<br>
flowing in a conduit toward the reaction medium. A useful sample size is about<br>
100 grams captured in a glass container having about 250 milliliters of internal<br>
volume. Before being released to atmospheric pressure, but while continuously<br>
flowing toward the sample container, the recycled filtrate is cooled to less than<br>
100°C; this cooling is in order to limit solvent evaporation during the short<br>
interval before being sealed closed in the glass container. After the sample is<br>
captured at atmospheric pressure, the glass container is sealed closed<br>
immediately. Then the sample is allowed to cool to about 20°C while<br>
surrounded by air at about 20°C and without forced convection. After reaching<br>
about 20°C, the sample is held at this condition for at least about 2 hours. Then,<br>
the sealed container is shaken vigorously until a visibly uniform distribution of<br>
solids is obtained. Immediately thereafter, a magnetic stirrer bar is added to the<br>
sample container and rotated at sufficient speed to maintain effectively uniform<br>
distribution of solids. A 10 milliliter aliquot of the mixed liquid with suspended<br>
solids is withdrawn by pipette and weighed. Then the bulk of the liquid phase<br>
from this aliquot is separated by vacuum filtration, still at about 20°C and<br>
effectively without loss of solids. The moist solids filtered from this aliquot are<br>
then dried, effectively without sublimation of solids, and these dried solids are<br>
weighed. The ratio of the weight of the dried solids to the weight of the original<br>
aliquot of slurry is the fraction of solids, typically expressed as a percentage and<br>
referred to herein as the recycled filtrate content of precipitated solids at 20°C.<br>
The inventors have discovered that aromatic compounds dissolved in the<br>
liquid phase of the reaction medium and comprising aromatic carboxylic acids<br>
lacking non-aromatic hydrocarbyl groups (e.g., isophthalic acid, benzoic acid,<br>
phthalic acid, 2,5,4'-tricarboxybiphenyl) are surprisingly pernicious<br>
components. Although these compounds are much reduced in chemical activity<br>
in the subject reaction medium compared to oxidizable compounds having nonaromatic<br>
hydrocarbyl groups, the inventors have discovered that these<br>
compounds nonetheless undergo numerous detrimental reactions. Thus, it is<br>
advantageous to control the content of these compounds in preferred ranges in<br>
the liquid phase of the reaction medium. This leads to preferred ranges of select<br>
compounds in recycled solvent feed and also to preferred ranges of select<br>
precursors in the oxidizable aromatic compound feed.<br>
For example, in the liquid-phase partial oxidation of para-xylene to<br>
terephthalic acid (TPA), the inventors have discovered that the highly-colored<br>
and undesirable impurity 2,7-dicarboxyfluorenone (2,7-DCF) is virtually<br>
undetectable in the reaction medium and product off-take when metasubstituted<br>
aromatic compounds are at very low levels in the reaction medium.<br>
The inventors have discovered that when isophthalic acid impurity is present at<br>
increasing levels in the solvent feed, the formation of 2,7-DCF rises in almost<br>
direct proportion. The inventors have also discovered that when meta-xylene<br>
impurity is present in the feed of para-xylene, the formation of 2,7-DCF again<br>
rises almost in direct proportion. Furthermore, even if the solvent feed and<br>
oxidizable compound feed are devoid of meta-substituted aromatic compounds,<br>
the inventors have discovered that some isophthalic acid is formed during a<br>
typical partial oxidation of very pure para-xylene, particularly when benzoic<br>
acid is present in the liquid phase of the reaction medium. This self-generated<br>
isophthalic acid may, owing to its greater solubility than TPA in solvent<br>
comprising acetic acid and water, build up over time in commercial units<br>
employing recycled solvent. Thus, the amount of isophthalic acid within<br>
solvent feed, the amount of meta-xylene within oxidizable aromatic compound<br>
feed, and the rate of self-creation of isophthalic acid within the reaction medium<br>
are all appropriately considered in balance with each other and in balance with<br>
any reactions that consume isophthalic acid. Isophthalic acid has been<br>
discovered to undergo additional consumptive reactions besides the formation<br>
of 2,7-DCF, as are disclosed below. In addition, the inventors have discovered<br>
that there are other issues to consider when setting appropriate ranges for the<br>
meta-substituted aromatic species in the partial oxidation of para-xylene to<br>
TPA. Other highly-colored and undesirable impurities, such as 2,6-<br>
dicarboxyfluorenone (2,6-DCF), appear to relate greatly to dissolved, parasubstituted<br>
aromatic species, which are always present with para-xylene feed to<br>
a liquid-phase oxidation. Thus, the suppression of 2,7-DCF is best considered<br>
in perspective with the level of other colored impurities being produced.<br>
For example, in the liquid-phase partial oxidation of para-xylene to<br>
TPA, the inventors have discovered that the formation of trimellitic acid rises as<br>
the levels isophthalic acid and phthalic acid rise within the reaction medium.<br>
Trimellitic acid is a tri-functional carboxylic acid leading to branching of<br>
polymer chains during production of PET from TPA. In many PET<br>
applications, branching levels must be controlled to low levels and hence<br>
trimellitic acid must be controlled to low levels in purified TPA. Besides<br>
leading to trimellitic acid, the presence of meta-substituted and ortho-substituted<br>
species in the reaction medium also give rise to other tricarboxylic acids (e.g.,<br>
1,3,5-tricarboxybenzene). Furthermore, the increased presence of tricarboxylic<br>
acids in the reaction medium increases the amount of tetracarboxylic acid<br>
formation (e.g., 1,2,4,5-tetracarboxybenzene). Controlling the summed<br>
production of all aromatic carboxylic acids having more than two carboxylic<br>
acid groups is one factor in setting the preferred levels of meta-substituted and<br>
ortho-substituted species in the recycled solvent feed, in the oxidizable<br>
compound feed, and in the reaction medium according to the present invention.<br>
For example, in the liquid-phase partial oxidation of para-xylene to<br>
TPA, the inventors have discovered that increased levels in the liquid phase of<br>
the reaction medium of several dissolved aromatic carboxylic acids lacking nonaromatic<br>
hydrocarbyl groups leads directly to the increased production of<br>
carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. This increased production of carbon<br>
oxides represents a yield loss on both oxidant and on oxidizable compound, the<br>
later since many of the co-produced aromatic carboxylic acids, which on the<br>
one hand may be viewed as impurities, on the other hand also have commercial<br>
value. Thus, appropriate removal of relatively soluble carboxylic acids lacking<br>
non-aromatic hydrocarbyl groups from recycle solvent has an economic value in<br>
preventing yield loss of oxidizable aromatic compound and of oxidant, in<br>
addition to suppressing the generation of highly undesirable impurities such as<br>
various fluorenones and trimellitic acid.<br>
For example, in the liquid-phase partial oxidation of para-xylene to<br>
TPA, the inventors have discovered that formation of 2,5,4'-tricarboxybiphenyl<br>
is seemingly unavoidable. The 2,5,4'-tricarboxybiphenyl is an aromatic<br>
tricarboxylic acid formed by the coupling of two aromatic rings, perhaps by the<br>
coupling of a dissolved para-substituted aromatic species with an aryl radical,<br>
perhaps an aryl radical formed by decarboxylation or decarbonylation of a parasubstituted<br>
aromatic species. Fortunately, the 2,5,4'-tricarboxybiphenyl is<br>
typically produced at lower levels than trimellitic acid and does not usually lead<br>
to significantly increased difficulties with branching of polymer molecules<br>
during production of PET. However, the inventors have discovered that<br>
elevated levels of 2,5,4'-tricarboxybiphenyl in a reaction medium comprising<br>
oxidation of alkyl aromatics according to preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention lead to increased levels of highly-colored and undesirable 2,6-DCF.<br>
The increased 2,6-DCF is possibly created from the 2,5,4'-tricarboxybiphenyl<br>
by ring closure with loss of a water molecule, though the exact reaction<br>
mechanism is not known with certainty. If 2,5,4'-tricarboxybiphenyl, which is<br>
more soluble in solvent comprising acetic acid and water than is TPA, is<br>
allowed to build up too high within recycled solvent, conversion rates to 2,6-<br>
DCF can become unacceptably large.<br>
For example, in the liquid-phase partial oxidation of para-xylene to<br>
TPA, the inventors have discovered that aromatic carboxylic acids lacking nonaromatic<br>
hydrocarbyl groups (e.g., isophthalic acid) generally lead to mild<br>
suppression of the chemical activity of the reaction medium when present in the<br>
liquid phase at sufficient concentration.<br>
For example, in the liquid-phase partial oxidation of para-xylene to<br>
TPA, the inventors have discovered that precipitation is very often non-ideal<br>
(i.e. non-equilibrium) with respect to the relative concentrations of different<br>
chemical species in the solid phase and in the liquid phase. Perhaps, this is<br>
because the precipitation rate is very fast at the space-time reaction rates<br>
preferred herein, leading to non-ideal co-precipitation of impurities, or even<br>
occlusion. Thus, when it is desired to limit the concentration of certain<br>
impurities (e.g., trimellitic acid and 2,6-DCF) within crude TPA, owing to the<br>
configuration of downstream unit operations, it is preferable to control their<br>
concentration in solvent feed as well as their generation rate within the reaction<br>
medium.<br>
For example, the inventors have discovered that benzophenone<br>
compounds (e.g., 4,4'-dicarboxybenzophenone and 2,5,4'-<br>
tricarboxybenzophenone) made during partial oxidation of para-xylene, have<br>
undesirable effects in a PET reaction medium even though benzophenone<br>
compounds are not as highly colored in TPA per se as are fluorenones and<br>
anthraquinones. Accordingly, it is desirable to limit the presence of<br>
benzophenones and select precursors in recycled solvent and in oxidizable<br>
compound feed. Furthermore, the inventors have discovered that the presence<br>
of elevated levels of benzoic acid, whether admitted in recycled solvent or<br>
formed within the reaction medium, leads to elevated rates of production of<br>
4,4'-dicarboxybenzophenone.<br>
In review, the inventors have discovered and sufficiently quantified a<br>
surprising array of reactions for aromatic compounds lacking non-aromatic<br>
hydrocarbyl groups that are present in the liquid-phase partial oxidation of paraxylene<br>
to TPA. Recapping just the single case of benzoic acid, the inventors<br>
have discovered that increased levels of benzoic acid in the reaction medium of<br>
certain embodiments of the present invention lead to greatly increased<br>
production of the highly colored and undesirable 9-fluorenone-2-carboxylic<br>
acid, to greatly increased levels of 4,4'-dicarboxybiphenyl, to increased levels<br>
of 4,4'-dicarboxybenzophenone, to a mild suppression of chemical activity of<br>
the intended oxidation of para-xylene, and to increased levels of carbon oxides<br>
and attendant yield losses. The inventors have discovered that increased levels<br>
of benzoic acid in the reaction medium also lead to increased production of<br>
isophthalic acid and phthalic acid, the levels of which are desirably controlled in<br>
low ranges according to similar aspects of the current invention. The number<br>
and importance of reactions involving benzoic acid are perhaps even more<br>
surprising since some recent inventors contemplate using benzoic acid in place<br>
of acetic acid as a primary component of solvent (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No.<br>
6,562,997). Additionally, the present inventors have observed that benzoic acid<br>
is self-generated during oxidation of para-xylene at rates that are quite<br>
important relative to its formation from impurities, such as toluene and<br>
ethylbenzene, commonly found in oxidizable compound feed comprising<br>
commercial-purity para-xylene.<br>
On the other hand, the inventors have discovered little value from<br>
additional regulation of recycled solvent composition in regard to the presence<br>
of oxidizable aromatic compound and in regard to aromatic reaction<br>
intermediates that both retain non-aromatic hydrocarbyl groups and are also<br>
relatively soluble in the recycled solvent. In general, these compounds are<br>
either fed to or created within the reaction medium at rates substantially greater<br>
than their presence in recycled solvent; and the consumption rate of these<br>
compounds within the reaction medium is great enough, retaining one or more<br>
non-aromatic hydrocarbyl groups, to limit appropriately their build-up within<br>
recycled solvent. For example, during partial oxidation of para-xylene in a<br>
multi-phase reaction medium, para-xylene evaporates to a limited extent along<br>
with large quantities of solvent. When this evaporated solvent exits the reactor<br>
as part of the off-gas and is condensed for recovery as recycled solvent, a<br>
substantial portion of the evaporated para-xylene condenses therein as well. It<br>
is not necessary to limit the concentration of this para-xylene in recycled<br>
solvent. For example, if solvent is separated from solids upon slurry exiting a<br>
para-xylene oxidation reaction medium, this recovered solvent will contain a<br>
similar concentration of dissolved para-toluic acid to that present at the point of<br>
removal from the reaction medium. Although it may be important to limit the<br>
standing concentration of para-toluic acid within the liquid phase of the reaction<br>
medium, see below, it is not necessary to regulate separately the para-toluic acid<br>
in this portion of recycled solvent owing to its relatively good solubility and to<br>
its low mass flow rate relative to the creation of para-toluic acid within the<br>
reaction medium. Similarly, the inventors have discovered little reason to limit<br>
the concentrations in recycled solvent of aromatic compounds with methyl<br>
substituents (e.g. toluic acids), aromatic aldehydes (e.g., terephthaldehyde), of<br>
aromatic compounds with hydroxy-methyl substituents (e.g., 4-<br>
hydroxymethylbenzoic acid), and of brominated aromatic compounds retaining<br>
at least one non-aromatic hydrocarbyl group (e.g., alpha-bromo-para-toluic<br>
acid) below those inherently found in the liquid phase exiting from the reaction<br>
medium occurring in the partial oxidation of xylene according to preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention. Surprisingly, the inventors have also<br>
discovered that it is also not necessary to regulate in recycled solvent the<br>
concentration of selected phenols intrinsically produced during partial oxidation<br>
of xylene, for these compounds are created and destroyed within the reaction<br>
medium at rates much greater than their presence in recycled solvent. For<br>
example, the inventors have discovered that 4-hydroxybenzoic acid has<br>
relatively small effects on chemical activity in the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention when co-fed at rates of over 2 grams of 4-hydroxybenzoic<br>
acid per 1 kilogram of para-xylene, far higher than the natural presence in<br>
recycled solvent, despite being reported by others as a significant poison in<br>
similar reaction medium (See, e.g., W. Partenheimer, Catalysis Today 23 (1995)<br>
p. 81).<br>
Thus, there are numerous reactions and numerous considerations in<br>
setting the preferred ranges of various aromatic impurities in the solvent feed as<br>
now disclosed. These discoveries are stated in terms of the aggregated weight<br>
average composition of all solvent streams being fed to the reaction medium<br>
during the course of a set time period, preferably one day, more preferably one<br>
hour, and most preferably one minute. For example, if one solvent feed flows<br>
substantially continuously with a composition of 40 ppmw of isophthalic acid at<br>
a flow rate of 7 kilograms per minute, a second solvent feed flows substantially<br>
continuously with a composition of 2,000 ppmw of isophthalic acid at a flow<br>
rate of 10 kilograms per minute, and there are no other solvent feed streams<br>
entering the reaction medium, then the aggregated weight average composition<br>
of the solvent feed is calculated as (40 * 7 + 2,000 * 10)/(7 +10) = 1,193<br>
ppmw of isophthalic acid. It is notable that the weight of any oxidizable<br>
compound feed or of any oxidant feed that are perhaps commingled with the<br>
solvent feed before entering the reaction medium are not considered in<br>
calculating the aggregated weight average composition of the solvent feed.<br>
Table 1, below, lists preferred values for certain components in the<br>
solvent feed introduced into the reaction medium. The solvent feed components<br>
listed in Table 1 are as follows: 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (4-CBA), 4,4'-<br>
dicarboxystilbene (4,4'-DCS), 2,6-dicarboxyanthraquinone (2,6-DCA), 2,6-<br>
dicarboxyfluorenone (2,6-DCF), 2,7-dicarboxyfluorenone (2,7-DCF), 3,5-<br>
dicarboxyfluorenone (3,5-DCF), 9-fluorenone-2-carboxylic acid (9F-2CA), 9-<br>
fluorenone-4-carboxylic acid (9F-4CA), total fluorenones including other<br>

carboxylic acids lacking non-aromatic hydrocarbyl groups. Table 1, below<br>
provides the preferred amounts of these impurities in CTA produced according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
(Table Removed)   Many other aromatic impurities are also typically present in recycled<br>
solvent, generally varying at even lower levels and/or in proportion to one or<br>
more of the disclosed aromatic compounds. Methods for controlling the<br>
disclosed aromatic compounds in the preferred ranges will typically keep other<br>
aromatic impurities at suitable levels.<br>
When bromine is used within the reaction medium, a large number of<br>
ionic and organic forms of bromine are known to exist in a dynamic<br>
equilibrium. These various forms of bromine have different stability<br>
characteristics once leaving the reaction medium and passing through various<br>
unit operations pertaining to recycled solvent. For example, alpha-bromo-paratoluic<br>
acid may persist as such at some conditions or may rapidly hydrolyze at<br>
other conditions to form 4-hydroxymethylbenzoic acid and hydrogen bromide.<br>
In the present invention, it is preferable that at least about 40 weight percent,<br>
more preferable that at least about 60 weight percent, and most preferable that at<br>
least about 80 weight percent of the total mass of bromine present in the<br>
aggregated solvent feed to the reaction medium is in one or more of the<br>
following chemical forms: ionic bromine, alpha-bromo-para-toluic acid, and<br>
bromoacetic acid.<br>
Although the importance and value of controlling the aggregated weight<br>
average purity of solvent feed within the disclosed, desired ranges of the present<br>
invention has not heretofore been discovered and/or disclosed, suitable means<br>
for controlling the solvent feed purity may be assembled from various methods<br>
already known in the art. First, any solvent evaporated from the reaction<br>
medium is typically of suitable purity providing that liquid or solids from the<br>
reaction medium are not entrained with the evaporated solvent. The feeding of<br>
reflux solvent droplets into the off-gas disengaging space above the reaction<br>
medium, as disclosed herein, appropriately limits such entrainment; and<br>
recycled solvent of suitable purity with respect to aromatic compound can be<br>
condensed from such off-gas. Second, the more difficult and costly purification<br>
of recycled solvent feed typically relates to solvent taken from the reaction<br>
medium in liquid form and to solvent that subsequently contacts the liquid<br>
and/or solid phases of the reaction medium withdrawn from the reaction vessel<br>
(e.g., recycled solvent obtained from a filter in which solids are concentrated<br>
and/or washed, recycled solvent obtained from a centrifuge in which solids are<br>
concentrated and/or washed, recycled solvent taken from a crystallization<br>
operation, and so on). However, means are also known in the art for effecting<br>
the necessary purification of these recycled solvent streams using one or more<br>
prior disclosures. With respect to controlling precipitated solids in recycled<br>
solvent to be within the ranges specified, suitable control means include, but are<br>
not limited to, gravimetric sedimentation, mechanical filtration using filter cloth<br>
on rotary belt filters and rotary drum filters, mechanical filtration using<br>
stationary filter medium within pressure vessels, hydro-cyclones, and<br>
centrifuges. With respect to controlling dissolved aromatic species in recycled<br>
solvent to be within the ranges specified, the control means include, but are not<br>
limited to, those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,939,297 and U.S. Pat. App. Pub.<br>
No. 2005-0038288, incorporated herein by reference. However, none of these<br>
prior inventions discovered and disclosed the preferred levels of purity in the<br>
aggregated solvent feed as disclosed herein. Rather, these prior inventions<br>
merely provided means to purify selected and partial streams of recycled<br>
solvent without deducing the present inventive, optimal values of the<br>
composition of the aggregated weight average solvent feed to the reaction<br>
medium.<br>
Turning now to the purity of the feed of oxidizable compound, it is<br>
known that certain levels of isophthalic acid, phthalic acid, and benzoic acid are<br>
present and tolerable at low levels in purified TPA used for polymer production.<br>
Moreover, it is known these species are relatively more soluble in many<br>
solvents and may be advantageously removed from purified TPA by<br>
crystallization processes. However, from an embodiment of the invention<br>
disclosed herein, it is now known that controlling the level of several relatively<br>
soluble aromatic species, notably including isophthalic acid, phthalic acid, and<br>
benzoic acid, in the liquid phase of the reaction medium is surprisingly<br>
important for controlling the level of polycyclic and colored aromatic<br>
compounds created in the reaction medium, for controlling compounds with<br>
more than 2 carboxylic acid functions per molecule, for controlling reaction<br>
activity within the partial oxidation reaction medium, and for controlling yield<br>
losses of oxidant and of aromatic compound.<br>
It is known within the art that isophthalic acid, phthalic acid, and benzoic<br>
acid are formed in the reaction medium as follows. Meta-Xylene feed impurity<br>
oxidizes in good conversion and yield to IP A. Ortho-Xylene feed impurity<br>
oxidizes in good conversion and yield to phthalic acid. Ethylbenzene and<br>
toluene feed impurities oxidize in good conversion and yield to benzoic acid.<br>
However, the inventors have observed that significant amounts of isophthalic<br>
acid, phthalic acid, and benzoic acid are also formed within a reaction medium<br>
comprising para-xylene by means other than oxidation of meta-xylene, orthoxylene,<br>
ethylbenzene, and toluene. These other intrinsic chemical routes<br>
possibly include decarbonylation, decarboxylation, the re-organization of<br>
transition states, and addition of methyl and carbonyl radicals to aromatic rings.<br>
In determining preferred ranges of impurities in the feed of oxidizable<br>
compound, many factors are relevant. Any impurity in the feed is likely to be a<br>
direct yield loss and a product purification cost if the purity requirements of the<br>
oxidized product are sufficiently strict (e.g., in a reaction medium for partial<br>
oxidation of para-xylene, toluene and ethylbenzene typically found in<br>
commercial-purity para-xylene lead to benzoic acid, and this benzoic acid is<br>
largely removed from most commercial TPA). When the partial oxidation<br>
product of a feed impurity participates in additional reactions, factors other than<br>
simple yield loss and removal become appropriate when considering how much<br>
feed purification cost to incur (e.g., in a reaction medium for partial oxidation of<br>
para-xylene, ethylbenzene leads to benzoic acid, and benzoic acid subsequently<br>
leads to highly colored 9-fluorenone-2-carboxylic acid, to isophthalic acid, to<br>
phthalic acid, and to increased carbon oxides, among others). When the<br>
reaction medium self-generates additional amounts of an impurity by chemical<br>
mechanisms not directly related to feed impurities, the analysis becomes still<br>
more complex (e.g., in a reaction medium for partial oxidation of para-xylene,<br>
benzoic acid is also self-generated from para-xylene itself). In addition, the<br>
downstream processing of the crude oxidation product may affect the<br>
considerations for preferred feed purity. For example, the cost of removing to<br>
suitable levels a direct impurity (benzoic acid) and subsequent impurities<br>
(isophthalic acid, phthalic acid, 9-fiuorenone-2-carboxylic acid, et al.) may be<br>
one and the same, may be different from each other, and may be different from<br>
the requirements of removing a largely unrelated impurity (e.g., incomplete<br>
oxidation product 4-CBA in the oxidation of para-xylene to TPA).<br>
The following disclosed feed purity ranges for para-xylene are preferred<br>
where para-xylene is fed with solvent and oxidant to a reaction medium for<br>
partial oxidation to produce TPA. These ranges are more preferred in TPA<br>
production process having post-oxidation steps to remove from reaction<br>
medium impurities other than oxidant and solvent (e.g., catalyst metals). These<br>
ranges are still more preferred in TPA production processes that remove<br>
additional 4-CBA from CTA (e.g., by conversion of CTA to dimethyl<br>
terephthalate plus impurity esters and subsequent separation of the methyl ester<br>
of 4-CBA by distillation, by oxidative digestion methods for converting 4-CBA<br>
to TPA, by hydrogenation methods for converting 4-CBA to para-toluic acid,<br>
which is then separated by partial-crystallization methods). These ranges are<br>
most preferred in TPA production processes that remove additional 4-CBA<br>
from CTA by oxidative digestion methods for converting 4-CBA to TPA.<br>
Using new knowledge of preferred ranges of recycling aromatic<br>
compounds and of the relative amounts of the aromatic compounds formed<br>
directly from oxidation of feed impurities as compared to other intrinsic<br>
chemical routes, improved ranges for impurities have been discovered for<br>
impure para-xylene being fed to a partial oxidation process for TPA production.<br>
Table 2, below provides preferred values for the amount of meta-xylene, orthoxylene,<br>
and ethylbenzene + toluene in the para-xylene feed.<br>
(Table Removed)Specification for ethylbenzene + toluene is each separately and in sum<br>
Those skilled in the art will now recognize the above impurities within<br>
impure para-xylene may have their greatest effect on the reaction medium after<br>
their partial oxidation products have accumulated in recycled solvent. For<br>
example, feeding the upper amount of the most preferred range of meta-xylene,<br>
400 ppmw, will immediately produce about 200 ppmw of isophthalic acid<br>
within the liquid phase of the reaction medium when operating with about 33<br>
weight percent solids in the reaction medium. This compares with an input<br>
from the upper amount of the most preferred range for isophthalic acid in<br>
recycled solvent of 400 ppmw which, after allowing for a typical solvent<br>
evaporation to cool the reaction medium, amounts to about 1,200 ppmw of<br>
isophthalic acid within the liquid phase of the reaction medium. Thus, it is the<br>
accumulation of partial oxidation products over time within recycled solvent<br>
100<br>
that represents the greatest probable impact of the meta-xylene, ortho-xylene,<br>
ethylbenzene, and toluene impurities in the feed of impure para-xylene.<br>
Accordingly, the above ranges for impurities in impure para-xylene feed are<br>
preferred to be maintained for at least one-half of each day of operation of any<br>
partial oxidation reaction medium in a particular manufacturing unit, more<br>
preferably for at least three-quarters of each day for at least seven consecutive<br>
days of operation, and most preferably when the mass-weighted averages of the<br>
impure para-xylene feed composition are within the preferred ranges for at least<br>
30 consecutive days of operation.<br>
Means for obtaining impure para-xylene of preferred purity are already<br>
known in the art and include, but are not limited to, distillation, partial<br>
crystallization methods at sub-ambient temperatures, and molecular sieve<br>
methods using selective pore-size adsorption. However, the preferred ranges of<br>
purity specified herein are, at their high end, more demanding and expensive<br>
than characteristically practiced by commercial suppliers of para-xylene; and<br>
yet at the low end, the preferred ranges avoid overly costly purification of paraxylene<br>
for feeding to a partial oxidation reaction medium by discovering and<br>
disclosing where the combined effects of impurity self-generation from paraxylene<br>
itself and of impurity consumptive reactions within the reaction medium<br>
become more important than the feed rates of impurities within impure paraxylene.<br>
When the xylene-containing feed stream contains selected impurities,<br>
such as ethyl-benzene and/or toluene, oxidation of these impurities can generate<br>
benzoic acid. As used herein, the term "impurity-generated benzoic acid" shall<br>
denote benzoic acid derived from any source other than xylene during xylene<br>
oxidation.<br>
As disclosed herein, a portion of the benzoic acid produced during<br>
xylene oxidation is derived from the xylene itself. This production of benzoic<br>
acid from xylene is distinctly in addition to any portion of benzoic acid<br>
production that may be impurity-generated benzoic acid. Without being bound<br>
by theory, it is believed that benzoic acid is derived from xylene within the<br>
reaction medium when various intermediate oxidation products of xylene<br>
spontaneously decarbonylate (carbon monoxide loss) or decarboxylate (carbon<br>
dioxide loss) to thereby produce aryl radicals. These aryl radicals can then<br>
abstract a hydrogen atom from one of many available sources in the reaction<br>
medium and produce self-generated benzoic acid. Whatever the chemical<br>
mechanism, the term "self-generated benzoic acid", as used herein, shall denote<br>
benzoic acid derived from xylene during xylene oxidation.<br>
As also disclosed herein, when para-xylene is oxidized to produce<br>
terephthalic acid (TPA), the production of self-generated benzoic acid causes<br>
para-xylene yield loss and oxidant yield loss. In addition, the presence of selfgenerated<br>
benzoic acid in the liquid phase of the reaction medium correlates<br>
with increases for many undesirable side reactions, notably including generation<br>
of highly colored compounds called mono-carboxy-fluorenones. Self-generated<br>
benzoic acid also contributes to the undesirable accumulation of benzoic acid in<br>
recycled filtrate which further elevates the concentration of benzoic acid in the<br>
liquid phase of the reaction medium. Thus, formation of self-generated benzoic<br>
acid is desirably minimized, but this is also appropriately considered<br>
simultaneously with impurity-generated benzoic acid, with factors affecting<br>
consumption of benzoic acid, with factors pertaining to other issues of reaction<br>
selectivity, and with overall economics.<br>
The inventors have discovered that the self-generation of benzoic acid<br>
can be controlled to low levels by appropriate selection of, for example,<br>
temperature, xylene distribution, and oxygen availability within the reaction<br>
medium during oxidation. Not wishing to be bound by theory, lower<br>
temperatures and improved oxygen availability appear to suppress the<br>
decarbonylation and/or decarboxylation rates, thus avoiding the yield loss<br>
aspect of self-generated benzoic acid. Sufficient oxygen availability appears to<br>
direct aryl radicals toward other more benign products, in particular<br>
hydroxybenzoic acids. Distribution of xylene in the reaction medium may also<br>
affect the balance between aryl radical conversion to benzoic acid or to<br>
hydroxybenzoic acids. Whatever the chemical mechanisms, the inventors have<br>
discovered reaction conditions that, although mild enough to reduce benzoic<br>
acid production, are severe enough to oxidize a high fraction of the<br>
hydroxybenzoic acid production to carbon monoxide and/or carbon dioxide,<br>
which are easily removed from the oxidation product.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the oxidation reactor<br>
is configured and operated in a manner such that the formation of self-generated<br>
benzoic acid is minimized and the oxidation of hydroxybenzoic acids to carbon<br>
monoxide and/or carbon dioxide is maximized. When the oxidation reactor is<br>
employed to oxidize para-xylene to terephthalic acid, it is preferred that paraxylene<br>
makes up at least about 50 weight percent of the total xylene in the feed<br>
stream introduced into the reactor. More preferably, para-xylene makes up at<br>
least about 75 weight percent of the total xylene in the feed stream. Still more<br>
preferably, para-xylene makes up at least 95 weight percent of the total xylene<br>
in the feed stream. Most preferably, para-xylene makes up substantially all of<br>
the total xylene in the feed stream.<br>
When the reactor is employed to oxidize para-xylene to terephthalic<br>
acid, it is preferred for the rate of production of terephthalic acid to be<br>
maximized, while the rate of production of self-generated benzoic acid is<br>
minimized. Preferably, the ratio of the rate of production (by weight) of<br>
terephthalic acid to the rate of production (by weight) of self-generated benzoic<br>
acid is at least about 500:1, more preferably at least about 1,000:1, and most<br>
preferably at least 1,500:1. As will be seen below, the rate of production of<br>
self-generated benzoic acid is preferably measured when the concentration of<br>
benzoic acid in the liquid phase of the reaction medium is below 2,000 ppmw,<br>
more preferably below 1,000 ppmw, and most preferably below 500 ppmw,<br>
because these low concentrations suppress to suitably low rates reactions that<br>
convert benzoic acid to other compounds.<br>
Combining the self-generated benzoic acid and the impurity-generated<br>
benzoic acid, the ratio of the rate of production (by weight) of terephthalic acid<br>
to the rate of production (by weight) of total benzoic acid is preferably at least<br>
about 400:1, more preferably at least about 700:1, and most preferably at least<br>
1,100:1. As will be seen below, the summed rate of production of selfgenerated<br>
benzoic acid plus impurity-generated benzoic acid is preferably<br>
measured when the concentration of benzoic acid in the liquid phase of the<br>
reaction medium is below 2,000 ppmw, more preferably below 1,000 ppmw,<br>
and most preferably below 500 ppmw, because these low concentrations<br>
suppress to suitably low rates reactions that convert benzoic acid to other<br>
compounds.<br>
As disclosed herein, elevated concentrations of benzoic acid in the liquid<br>
phase of the reaction medium lead to increased formation of many other<br>
aromatic compounds, several of which are noxious impurities in TPA; and, as<br>
disclosed herein, elevated concentrations of benzoic acid in the liquid phase of<br>
the reaction medium lead to increased formation of carbon oxide gases, the<br>
formation of which represents yield loss on oxidant and on aromatic compounds<br>
and/or solvent. Furthermore, it is now disclosed that the inventors have<br>
discovered a considerable portion of this increased formation of other aromatic<br>
compounds and of carbon oxides derives from reactions that convert some of<br>
the benzoic acid molecules themselves, as contrasted to benzoic acid catalyzing<br>
other reactions without itself being consumed. Accordingly, the "net generation<br>
of benzoic acid" is defined herein as the time-averaged weight of all benzoic<br>
acid exiting the reaction medium minus the time-averaged weight of all benzoic<br>
acid entering the reaction medium during the same period of time. This net<br>
generation of benzoic acid is often positive, driven by the formation rates of<br>
impurity-generated benzoic acid and of self-generated benzoic acid. However,<br>
the inventors have discovered that the conversion rate of benzoic acid to carbon<br>
oxides, and to several other compounds, appears to increase approximately<br>
linearly as the concentration of benzoic acid is increased in the liquid phase of<br>
the reaction medium, measured when other reaction conditions comprising<br>
temperature, oxygen availability, STR, and reaction activity are maintained<br>
appropriately constant. Thus, when the concentration of benzoic acid in the<br>
liquid-phase of the reaction medium is great enough, perhaps due to an elevated<br>
concentration of benzoic acid in recycled solvent, then the conversion of<br>
benzoic acid molecules to other compounds, including carbon oxides, can<br>
become equal to or greater than the chemical generation of new benzoic acid<br>
molecules. In this case, the net generation of benzoic acid can become balanced<br>
near zero or even negative. The inventors have discovered that when the net<br>
generation of benzoic acid is positive, then the ratio of the rate of production<br>
(by weight) of terephthalic acid in the reaction medium compared to the rate of<br>
net generation of benzoic acid in the reaction medium is preferably above about<br>
700:1, more preferably above about 1,100:1, and most preferably above<br>
4,000:1. The inventors have discovered that when the net generation of benzoic<br>
acid is negative, the ratio of the rate of production (by weight) of terephthalic<br>
acid in the reaction medium compared to the rate of net generation of benzoic<br>
acid in the reaction medium is preferably above about 200:(-1), more preferably<br>
above about 1,000:(-!), and most preferably above 5,000:(-1).<br>
The inventors have also discovered preferred ranges for the composition<br>
of the slurry (liquid + solid) withdrawn from the reaction medium and for the<br>
solid CTA portion of the slurry. The preferred slurry and the preferred CTA<br>
compositions are surprisingly superior and useful. For example, purified TPA<br>
produced from this preferred CTA by oxidative digestion has a sufficiently low<br>
level of total impurities and of colored impurities such that the purified TPA is<br>
suitable, without hydrogenation of additional 4-CBA and/or colored impurities,<br>
for a wide range of applications in PET fibers and PET packaging applications.<br>
For example, the preferred slurry composition provides a liquid phase of the<br>
reaction medium that is relatively low in concentration of important impurities<br>
and this importantly reduces the creation of other even more undesirable<br>
impurities as disclosed herein. In addition, the preferred slurry composition<br>
importantly aids the subsequent processing of liquid from the slurry to become<br>
suitably pure recycled solvent, according to other embodiments of the present<br>
invention.<br>
CTA produced according to one embodiment of the present invention<br>
contains less impurities of selected types than CTA produce by conventional<br>
processes and apparatuses, notably those employing recycled solvent.<br>
Impurities that may be present in CTA include the following: 4-<br>
carboxybenzaldehyde (4-CBA), 4,4'-dicarboxystilbene (4,4'-DCS), 2,6-<br>
dicarboxyanthraquinone (2,6-DCA), 2,6-dicarboxyfluorenone (2,6-DCF), 2,7-<br>
dicarboxyfluorenone (2,7-DCF), 3,5-dicarboxyfluorenone (3,5-DCF), 9-<br>
fluorenone-2-carboxylic acid (9F-2CA), 9-fluorenone-4-carboxylic acid (9F-<br>
105<br>
4CA), 4,4'-dicarboxybiphenyl (4,4'-DCB), 2,5,4'-tricarboxybiphenyl (2,5,4'-<br>
TCB), phthalic acid (PA), isophthalic acid (PA), benzoic acid (BA), trimellitic<br>
acid (TMA), para-toluic acid (PTAC), 2,6-dicarboxybenzocoumarin (2,6-<br>
DCBC), 4,4'-dicarboxybenzil (4,4'-DCBZ), 4,4'-dicarboxybenzophenone (4,4'-<br>
DCBP), 2,5,4'-tricarboxybenzophenone (2,5,4'-TCBP). Table 3, below<br>
provides the preferred amounts of these impurities in CTA produced according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
(Table Removed)In addition, it is preferred for CTA produced according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention to have reduced color content relative to<br>
CTA produce by conventional processes and apparatuses, notably those<br>
employing recycled solvent. Thus, it is preferred for CTA produced in<br>
accordance to one embodiment of the present invention have a percent<br>
transmittance percent at 340 nanometers (nm) of at least about 25 percent, more<br>
preferably of at least about 50 percent, and most preferably of at least 60<br>
percent. It is further preferred for CTA produced in accordance to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention to have a percent transmittance percent at<br>
400 nanometers (nm) of at least about 88 percent, more preferably of at least<br>
about 90 percent, and most preferably of at least 92 percent.<br>
The test for percent transmittance provides a measure of the colored,<br>
light-absorbing impurities present within TPA or CTA. As used herein, the test<br>
refers to measurements done on a portion of a solution prepared by dissolving<br>
2.00 grams of dry solid TPA or CTA in 20.0 milliliters of dimethyl sulfoxide<br>
(DMSO), analytical grade or better. A portion of this solution is then placed in<br>
a Hellma semi-micro flow cell, PN 176.700, which is made of quartz and has a<br>
light path of 1.0 cm and a volume of 0.39 milliliters. (Hellma USA, 80 Skyline<br>
Drive, Plainview, NY 11803). An Agilent 8453 Diode Array<br>
Spectrophotometer is used to measure the transmittance of different<br>
wavelengths of light through this filled flow cell. (Agilent Technologies, 395<br>
Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, CA 94303). After appropriate correction for<br>
absorbance from the background, including but not limited to the cell and the<br>
solvent used, the percent transmittance results, characterizing the fraction of<br>
incident light that is transmitted through the solution, are reported directly by<br>
the machine. Percent transmittance values at light wavelengths of 340<br>
nanometers and 400 nanometers are particularly useful for discriminating pure<br>
TPA from many of the impurities typically found therein.<br>

The preferred ranges of various aromatic impurities in the slurry (solid +<br>
liquid) phase of the reaction medium are provided below in Table 4.<br>
(Table Removed)These preferred compositions for the slurry embody the preferred<br>
composition of the liquid phase of the reaction medium while usefully avoiding<br>
experimental difficulties pertaining to precipitation of additional liquid phase<br>
components from the reaction medium into solid phase components during<br>
108<br>
sampling from the reaction medium, separation of liquids and solids, and<br>
shifting to analytical conditions.<br>
Many other aromatic impurities are also typically present in the slurry<br>
phase of the reaction medium and in CTA of the reaction medium, generally<br>
varying at even lower levels and/or in proportion to one or more of the disclosed<br>
aromatic compounds. Controlling the disclosed aromatic compounds in the<br>
preferred ranges will keep other aromatic impurities at suitable levels. These<br>
advantaged compositions for the slurry phase in the reaction medium and for the<br>
solid CTA taken directly from the slurry are enabled by operating with<br>
embodiments of the invention disclosed herein for partial oxidation of paraxylene<br>
to TPA.<br>
Measurement of the concentration of low level components in the<br>
solvent, recycled solvent, CTA, slurry from the reaction medium, and PTA are<br>
performed using liquid chromatography methods. Two interchangeable<br>
embodiments are now described.<br>
The method referred to herein as HPLC-DAD comprises high pressure<br>
liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with a diode array detector (DAD) to<br>
provide separation and quantitation of various molecular species within a given<br>
sample. The instrument used in this measurement is a model 1100 HPLC<br>
equipped with a DAD, provided by Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA),<br>
though other suitable instruments are also commercially available and from<br>
other suppliers As is known in the art, both the elution time and the detector<br>
response are calibrated using known compounds present in known amounts,<br>
compounds and amounts that are appropriate to those occurring in actual<br>
unknown samples.<br>
The method referred to herein as HPLC-MS comprises high pressure<br>
liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) to<br>
provide separation, identification, and quantitation of various molecular species<br>
within a given sample. The instruments used in this measurement is an Alliance<br>
HPLC and ZQ MS provided by Waters Corp. (Milford, MA), though other<br>
suitable instruments are also commercially available and from other suppliers.<br>
As is known in the art, both the elution time and the mass spectrometric<br>
response are calibrated using known compounds present in known amounts,<br>
compounds and amounts that are appropriate to those occurring in actual<br>
unknown samples.<br>
Another embodiment of the current invention relates to partial oxidation<br>
of aromatic oxidizable compound with appropriate balancing of the suppression<br>
of noxious aromatic impurities on the one hand against the production of carbon<br>
dioxide and carbon monoxide, collectively carbon oxides (COx), on the other.<br>
These carbon oxides typically exit the reaction vessel in the off-gas, and they<br>
correspond to a destructive loss of solvent and of oxidizable compound,<br>
including the ultimately preferred oxidized derivatives (e.g., acetic acid, paraxylene,<br>
and TPA). The inventors have discovered lower bounds for the<br>
production of carbon oxides below which it seems the high creation of noxious<br>
aromatic impurities, as described below, and the low overall conversion level<br>
are inevitably too poor to be of economic utility. The inventors have also<br>
discovered upper bounds of carbon oxides above which the generation of<br>
carbon oxides continues to increase with little further value provided by<br>
reduction in generation of noxious aromatic impurities.<br>
The inventors have discovered that reducing the liquid-phase<br>
concentrations of aromatic oxidizable compound feed and of aromatic<br>
intermediate species within a reaction medium leads to lower generation rates<br>
for noxious impurities during the partial oxidation of aromatic oxidizable<br>
compound. These noxious impurities include coupled aromatic rings and/or<br>
aromatic molecules containing more than the desired number of carboxylic acid<br>
groups (e.g., in the oxidation of para-xylene the noxious impurities include 2,6-<br>
dicarboxyanthraquinone, 2,6-dicarboxyfluorenone, trimellitic acid, 2,5,4'-<br>
tricarboxybiphenyl, and 2,5,4'-benzophenone). The aromatic intermediate<br>
species include aromatic compounds descended from the feed of oxidizable<br>
aromatic compound and still retaining non-aromatic hydrocarbyl groups (e.g., in<br>
the oxidation of para-xylene the aromatic intermediate species comprise paratolualdehyde,<br>
terephthaldehyde, para-toluic acid, 4-CBA, 4-<br>
hydroxymethylbenzoic acid, and alpha-bromo-para-toluic acid). The aromatic<br>
oxidizable compound feed and the aromatic intermediate species retaining non-<br>
aromatic hydrocarbyl groups, when present in the liquid phase of the reaction<br>
medium, appear to lead to noxious impurities in a manner similar to that already<br>
disclosed herein for dissolved aromatic species lacking non-aromatic<br>
hydrocarbyl groups (e.g., isophthalic acid).<br>
Set against this need for higher reaction activity to suppress formation of<br>
noxious aromatic impurities during partial oxidation of oxidizable aromatic<br>
compound, the inventors have discovered that the undesirable attendant result is<br>
increased production of carbon oxides. It is important to appreciate that these<br>
carbon oxides represent a yield loss of oxidizable compound and oxidant, not<br>
just solvent. Explicitly, a substantial and sometimes principal fraction of the<br>
carbon oxides comes from the oxidizable compound, and its derivatives, rather<br>
than from solvent; and often the oxidizable compound costs more per carbon<br>
unit than does solvent. Furthermore, it is important to appreciate that the<br>
desired product carboxylic acid (e.g., TPA) is also subject to over-oxidation to<br>
carbon oxides when present in the liquid phase of the reaction medium.<br>
It is also important to appreciate that the present invention relates to<br>
reactions in the liquid phase of the reaction medium and to reactant<br>
concentrations therein. This is in contrast to some prior inventions which relate<br>
directly to the creation in precipitated solid form of aromatic compound<br>
retaining non-aromatic hydrocarbyl groups. Specifically, for the partial<br>
oxidation of para-xylene to TPA, certain prior inventions pertain to the amount<br>
of 4-CBA precipitated in the solid phase of CTA. However, the present<br>
inventors have discovered a variance of greater than two to one for the ratio of<br>
4-CBA in the solid phase to 4-CBA in the liquid phase, using the same<br>
specifications of temperature, pressure, catalysis, solvent composition and<br>
space-time reaction rate of para-xylene, depending upon whether the partial<br>
oxidation is conducted in a well-mixed autoclave or in a reaction medium with<br>
oxygen and para-xylene staging according to the present invention. Further, the<br>
inventors have observed that the ratio of 4-CBA in the solid phase to 4-CBA in<br>
the liquid phase can also vary by over two to one in either well-mixed or staged<br>
reaction medium depending upon the space-time reaction rate of para-xylene at<br>
otherwise similar specifications of temperature, pressure, catalysis, and solvent<br>
composition. Additionally, 4-CBA in the solid phase CTA does not appear to<br>
contribute to the formation of noxious impurities, and 4-CBA in the solid phase<br>
can be recovered and oxidized on to TPA simply and at high yield (e.g., by<br>
oxidative digestion of the CTA slurry as is described herein); whereas the<br>
removal of noxious impurities is far more difficult and costly than removal of<br>
solid phase 4-CBA, and the production of carbon oxides represents a permanent<br>
yield loss. Thus, it is important to distinguish that this aspect of the present<br>
invention relates to liquid-phase compositions in the reaction medium.<br>
Whether sourced from solvent or oxidizable compound, the inventors<br>
have discovered that at conversions of commercial utility the production of<br>
carbon oxides relates strongly to the level of overall reaction activity despite<br>
wide variation in the specific combination of temperature, metals, halogens,<br>
temperature, acidity of the reaction medium as measured by pH, water<br>
concentration employed to obtain the level of overall reaction activity. The<br>
inventors have found it useful for the partial oxidation of xylene to evaluate the<br>
level of overall reaction activity using the liquid-phase concentration of toluic<br>
acids at the mid-height of the reaction medium, the bottom of the reaction<br>
medium, and the top of the reaction medium.<br>
Thus, there arises an important simultaneous balancing to minimize the<br>
creation of noxious impurities by increasing reaction activity and yet to<br>
minimize the creation of carbon oxides by lowering reaction activity. That is, if<br>
the overall production of carbon oxides is suppressed too low, then excessive<br>
levels of noxious impurities are formed, and vice versa.<br>
Furthermore, the inventors have discovered that the solubility and the<br>
relative reactivity of the desired carboxylic acid (e.g., TPA) and the presence of<br>
other dissolved aromatic species lacking non-aromatic hydrocarbyl groups<br>
introduce a very important fulcrum in this balancing of carbon oxides versus<br>
noxious impurities. The desired product carboxylic acid is typically dissolved<br>
in the liquid phase of the reaction medium, even when also present in solid<br>
form. For example, at temperatures in the preferred ranges, TPA is soluble in a<br>
reaction medium comprising acetic acid and water at levels ranging from about<br>
one thousand ppmw to in excess of 1 weight percent, with solubility increasing<br>
as temperature increases. Notwithstanding that there are differences in the<br>
reaction rates toward forming various noxious impurities from oxidizable<br>
aromatic compound feed (e.g., para-xylene), from aromatic reaction<br>
intermediates (e.g., para-toluic acid), from the desired product aromatic<br>
carboxylic acid (e.g., TPA), and from aromatic species lacking non-aromatic<br>
hydrocarbyl groups (e.g., isophthalic acid), the presence and reactivity of the<br>
latter two groups establishes a region of diminishing returns with regards to<br>
further suppression of the former two groups, oxidizable aromatic compound<br>
feed and aromatic reaction intermediates. For example, in a partial oxidation of<br>
para-xylene to TPA, if dissolved TPA amounts to 7,000 ppmw in the liquid<br>
phase of the reaction medium at given conditions, dissolved benzoic acid<br>
amounts to 8,000 ppmw, dissolved isophthalic acid amounts to 6,000 ppmw,<br>
and dissolved phthalic acid amounts to 2,000 ppmw, then the value toward<br>
further lowering of total noxious compounds begins to diminish as reaction<br>
activity is increased to suppress the liquid-phase concentration para-toluic acid<br>
and 4-CBA below similar levels. That is, the presence and concentration in the<br>
liquid phase of the reaction medium of aromatic species lacking non-aromatic<br>
hydrocarbyl groups is very little altered by increasing reaction activity, and their<br>
presence serves to expand upwards the region of diminishing returns for<br>
reducing the concentration of reaction intermediates in order to suppress<br>
formation of noxious impurities.<br>
Thus, one embodiment of the present invention provides preferred<br>
ranges of carbon oxides, bounded on the lower end by low reaction activity and<br>
excessive formation of noxious impurities and on upper end by excessive<br>
carbon losses, but at levels lower than previously discovered and disclosed as<br>
commercially useful. Accordingly, the formation of carbon oxides is preferably<br>
controlled as follows. The ratio of moles of total carbon oxides produced to<br>
moles of oxidizable aromatic compound fed is preferably greater than about<br>
0.02:1, more preferably greater than about 0.04:1, still more preferably greater<br>
than about 0.05:1, and most preferably greater than 0.06:1. At the same time,<br>
the ratio of moles of total carbon oxides produced to moles of oxidizable<br>
aromatic compound fed is preferably less than about 0.24:1, more preferably<br>
less than about 0.22:1, still more preferably less than about 0.19:1, and most<br>
preferably less than 0.15:1. The ratio of moles of carbon dioxide produced to<br>
moles of oxidizable aromatic compound fed is preferably greater than about<br>
0.01:1, more preferably greater than about 0.03:1, still more preferably greater<br>
than about 0.04:1, and most preferably greater than 0.05:1. At the same time,<br>
the ratio of moles of carbon dioxide produced to moles of oxidizable aromatic<br>
compound fed is preferably less than about 0.21:1, more preferably less than<br>
about 0.19:1, still more preferably less than about 0.16:1, and most preferably<br>
less than 0.11. The ratio of moles of carbon monoxide produced to moles of<br>
oxidizable aromatic compound fed is preferably greater than about 0.005:1,<br>
more preferably greater than about 0.010:1, still more preferably greater than<br>
about 0.015:1, and most preferably greater than 0.020:1. At the same time, the<br>
ratio of moles of carbon monoxide produced to moles of oxidizable aromatic<br>
compound fed is preferably less than about 0.09:1, more preferably less than<br>
about 0.07:1, still more preferably less than about 0.05:1, and most preferably<br>
less than 0.04:1<br>
The content of carbon dioxide in dry off-gas from the oxidation reactor<br>
is preferably greater than about 0.10 mole percent, more preferably greater than<br>
about 0.20 mole percent, still more preferably greater than about 0.25 mole<br>
percent, and most preferably greater than 0.30 mole percent. At the same time,<br>
the content of carbon dioxide in dry off-gas from the oxidation reactor is<br>
preferably less than about 1.5 mole percent, more preferably less than about 1.2<br>
mole percent, still more preferably less than about 0.9 mole percent, and most<br>
preferably less than 0.8 mole percent. The content of carbon monoxide in dry<br>
off-gas from the oxidation reactor is preferably greater than about 0.05 mole<br>
percent, more preferably greater than about 0.10 mole percent, still more<br>
preferably greater than 0.15, and most preferably greater than 0.18 mole<br>
percent. At the same time, the content of carbon monoxide in dry off-gas from<br>
the oxidation reactor is preferably less than about 0.60 mole percent, more<br>
preferably less than about 0.50 mole percent, still more preferably less than<br>
about 0.35 mole percent, and most preferably less than 0.28 mole percent<br>
The inventors have discovered that an important factor for reducing the<br>
production of carbon oxides to these preferred ranges is improving the purity of<br>
the recycled filtrate and of the feed of oxidizable compound to reduce the<br>
concentration of aromatic compounds lacking non-aromatic hydrocarbyl groups<br>
according to disclosures of the present invention - this simultaneously reduces<br>
the formation of carbon oxides and of noxious impurities. Another factor is<br>
improving distribution of para-xylene and oxidant within the reaction vessel<br>
according to disclosures of the present invention. Other factors enabling the<br>
above preferred levels of carbon oxides are to operate with the gradients in the<br>
reaction medium as disclosed herein for pressure, for temperature, for<br>
concentration of oxidizable compound in the liquid phase, and for oxidant in the<br>
gas phase. Other factors enabling the above preferred levels of carbon oxides<br>
are to operate within the disclosures herein preferred for space-time reaction<br>
rate, pressure, temperature, solvent composition, catalyst composition, and<br>
mechanical geometry of the reaction vessel.<br>
An important benefit from operating within the preferred ranges of<br>
carbon oxide formation is that the usage of molecular oxygen can be reduced,<br>
though not to stoichiometric values. Notwithstanding the good staging of<br>
oxidant and oxidizable compound according to the present invention, an excess<br>
of oxygen must be retained above the stoichiometric value, as calculated for<br>
feed of oxidizable compound alone, to allow for some losses to carbon oxides<br>
and to provide excess molecular oxygen to control the formation of noxious<br>
impurities. Specifically for the case where xylene is the feed of oxidizable<br>
compound, the feed ratio of weight of molecular oxygen to weight of xylene is<br>
preferably greater than about 0.91:1.00, more preferably greater than about<br>
0.95:1.00, and most preferably greater than 0.99:1.00. At the same time, the<br>
feed ratio of weight of molecular oxygen to weight of xylene is preferably less<br>
than about 1.20:1.00, more preferably less than about 1.12:1.00, and most<br>
preferably less than 1.06:1.00. Specifically for xylene feed, the time-averaged<br>
content of molecular oxygen in the dry off-gas from the oxidation reactor is<br>
preferably greater than about 0.1 mole percent, more preferably greater than<br>
about 1 mole percent, and most preferably greater than 1.5 mole percent. At the<br>
same time, the time-averaged content of molecular oxygen in the dry off-gas<br>
from the oxidation reactor is preferably less than about 6 mole percent, more<br>
preferably less than about 4 mole percent, and most preferably less than 3 mole<br>
percent.<br>
Another important benefit from operating within the preferred ranges of<br>
carbon oxide formation is that less aromatic compound is converted to carbon<br>
oxides and other less valuable forms. This benefit is evaluated using the sum of<br>
the moles of all aromatic compounds exiting the reaction medium divided by<br>
the sum of the moles of all aromatic compounds entering the reaction medium<br>
over a continuous period of time, preferably one hour, more preferably one day,<br>
and most preferably 30 consecutive days. This ratio is hereinafter referred to as<br>
the "molar survival ratio" for aromatic compounds through the reaction medium<br>
and is expressed as a numerical percentage. If all entering aromatic compounds<br>
exit the reaction medium as aromatic compounds, albeit mostly in oxidized<br>
forms of the entering aromatic compounds, then the molar survival ratio has its<br>
maximum value of 100 percent. If exactly 1 of every 100 entering aromatic<br>
molecules is converted to carbon oxides and/or other non-aromatic molecules<br>
(e.g., acetic acid) while passing through reaction medium, then the molar<br>
survival ratio is 99 percent. Specifically for the case where xylene is the<br>
principal feed of oxidizable aromatic compound, the molar survival ratio for<br>
aromatic compounds through the reaction medium is preferably greater than<br>
about 98 percent, more preferably greater than about 98.5 percent, and most<br>
preferably less than 99.0 percent. At the same time and in order that sufficient<br>
overall reaction activity is present, the molar survival ratio for aromatic<br>
compounds through the reaction medium is preferably less than about 99.9<br>
percent, more preferably less than about 99.8 percent, and most preferably less<br>
than 99.7 percent when xylene is the principal feed of oxidizable aromatic<br>
compound.<br>
Another aspect of the current invention involves the production of<br>
methyl acetate in a reaction medium comprising acetic acid and one or more<br>
oxidizable aromatic compounds. This methyl acetate is relatively volatile<br>
compared to water and acetic acid and thus tends to follow the off-gas unless<br>
additional cooling or other unit operations are employed to recover it and/or to<br>
destroy it prior to releasing the off-gas back to the environment. The formation<br>
of methyl acetate thus represents an operating cost and also a capital cost.<br>
Perhaps the methyl acetate is formed by first combining a methyl radical,<br>
perhaps from decomposition of acetic acid, with oxygen to produce methyl<br>
hydroperoxide, by subsequently decomposing to form methanol, and by finally<br>
reacting the produced methanol with remaining acetic acid to form methyl<br>
acetate. Whatever the chemical path, the inventors have discovered that<br>
whenever methyl acetate production is at too low a rate, then the production of<br>
carbon oxides are also too low and the production of noxious aromatic<br>
impurities are too high. If methyl acetate production is at too high a rate, then<br>
the production of carbon oxides are also unnecessarily high leading to yield<br>
losses of solvent, oxidizable compound and oxidant. When employing the<br>
preferred embodiments disclosed herein, the production ratio of moles of<br>
methyl acetate produced to moles of oxidizable aromatic compound fed is<br>
preferably greater than about 0.005:1, more preferably greater than about<br>
0.010:1, and most preferably greater than 0.020:1. At the same time, the<br>
production ratio of moles of methyl acetate produced to moles of oxidizable<br>
aromatic compound fed is preferably less than about 0.09:1, more preferably<br>
less than about 0.07:1, still more preferably less than about 0.05:1, and most<br>
preferably less than 0.04:1.<br>
This invention can be further illustrated by the following examples of<br>
preferred embodiments thereof, although it will be understood that these<br>
examples are included merely for purposes of illustration and are not intended<br>
to limit the scope of the invention unless otherwise specifically indicated.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
This is an operational example from a commercial oxidation of paraxylene<br>
in a bubble column reactor. This example demonstrates, for example,<br>
that large vertical gradients exist for concentrations of para-xylene when<br>
appropriate geometric and process conditions are employed according to aspects<br>
of the current invention.<br>
This example employed a commercial bubble column oxidizer vessel<br>
having a nearly vertical, essentially cylindrical body with an inside diameter of<br>
about 2.44 meters. The height of the bubble column oxidizer vessel was about<br>
32 meters from lower tangent line (TL) to upper TL. The vessel was fitted with<br>
about 2:1 elliptical heads at the top and bottom of the cylinder. The operating<br>
level was about 25 meters of reaction medium above the lower TL. The feed<br>
rate of commercial-purity para-xylene was effectively steady at a rate of about<br>
81 kilograms per minute, entering the reaction vessel through a circular hole<br>
located in the wall of the cylindrical section at an elevation of about 4.35 meters<br>
above the lower TL. The internal diameter of said wall hole was about 0.076<br>
meters. A filtrate solvent was fed at an effectively steady rate of about 777<br>
kilograms per minute. An unmetered fraction of this filtrate solvent, estimated<br>
from conduit sizes and pressure drops to be about 20 kilograms per minute, was<br>
feed as a liquid flush to the oxidant sparger. The balance of the filtrate solvent,<br>
about 757 kilograms per minute, was fed intimately commingled with the<br>
commercial-purity para-xylene. The combined liquid-phase feed stream of<br>
filtrate solvent and commercial-purity para-xylene thus amounted to about 838<br>
kilograms per minute giving a superficial velocity of the inlet flow through said<br>
wall hole of about 3 meters per second. This filtrate solvent was from a plant<br>
recycle system and was comprised above about 97 weight percent of acetic acid<br>
and water. The concentration of catalyst components in the filtrate solvent was<br>
such that the composition within the liquid phase of the reaction medium was<br>
about 1,777 ppmw of cobalt, about 1,518 ppmw of bromine, and about 107<br>
ppmw of manganese. A separate stream of reflux solvent was fed as droplets<br>
into the gas-disengaging zone above the operating level of the reaction medium<br>
at an effectively steady rate of about 572 kilograms per minute. This reflux<br>
solvent was comprised of above about 99 weight percent of acetic acid and<br>
water; and the reflux solvent was from a separate plant recycle system that was<br>
without significant levels of catalyst components. The combined water content<br>
of the filtrate solvent feed and of the reflux solvent feed was such that the<br>
concentration of water within the liquid phase of the reaction medium was about<br>
6.0 weight percent. The oxidant was compressed air fed at an effectively steady<br>
rate of about 384 kilograms per minute through an oxidant sparger similar to the<br>
one illustrated in FIGS. 2-5. This oxidant sparger comprised a mitered flow<br>
conduit that was approximately an equal-sided octagon with a crossing member<br>
connecting from one side to the opposite side and traversing through the vertical<br>
axis of symmetry of the reaction vessel. The mitered flow conduit was made<br>
from nominal 12-inch Schedule 10S piping components. The width of the<br>
octagon from the centroid of one side of the flow conduit to the centroid of the<br>
opposite side was about 1.83 meters. The octagon lay approximately horizontal,<br>
and the mid-elevation of the octagonal conduit was about 0.11 meters above the<br>
lower TL of the reaction vessel. The oxidant sparger contained 75 circular<br>
holes that were about 0.025 meters in diameter. The holes were situated<br>
approximately uniformly around the octagon and cross member, lying near the<br>
top of said 12-inch piping. There was one circular hole with diameter of about<br>
0.012 meters near the bottom of one side only of the octagonal conduit. The<br>
operating pressure in the reaction vessel overhead gas was steadily about 0.52<br>
megapascal gauge. The reaction was operated in a substantially adiabatic<br>
manner so that the heat of reaction elevated the temperature of the incoming<br>
feeds and evaporated much of the incoming solvent. Measured near the midelevation<br>
of the reaction medium, the operating temperature was about 160°C.<br>
An exiting slurry comprising crude terephthalic acid (CTA) was removed from<br>
near the bottom of the lower elliptical head of the reaction vessel at an<br>
effectively steady rate. The flow rate of the exiting slurry was about 408<br>
kilograms per minute.<br>
Samples of slurry from the reaction medium were obtained from three<br>
elevations in the reaction vessel, as described below. In determining the<br>
concentration of various species at various locations within the reaction<br>
medium, it was necessary to account for the stochastic nature of the system by<br>
taking enough samples to determine a time-averaged value of sufficient<br>
resolution.<br>
One set of five samples was obtained from the exiting slurry conduit<br>
from near the bottom of the lower elliptical head of the reaction vessel. Another<br>
set of five samples was obtained from a wall hole located at an elevation of<br>
about 12.4 meters above the lower TL of the reaction vessel. The third set of<br>
five samples was obtained from a wall hole located at an elevation of about 17.2<br>
meters above the lower TL of the reaction vessel.<br>
All slurry samples were analyzed by a calibrated gas chromatography<br>
(GC) method for composition of para-xylene and para-tolualdehyde in the liquid<br>
phase. Table 5, below, shows the average of the five results that were obtained<br>
from the three different column elevations. Results are reported as mass parts<br>
of analyte per million mass parts (ppmw) of liquid phase.<br>
(Table Removed)These results show large gradients occurred vertically in the local<br>
concentrations of para-xylene and para-tolualdehyde. For example, the gradient<br>
in concentration of para-xylene observed in data of Table 5 was over 20:1<br>
(455:21). These results demonstrate that the inherent fluid mixing of the<br>
entering para-xylene feed within the bubble column was importantly slower<br>
than the inherent reaction rates. To a lesser extent, vertical gradients also were<br>
observed for the concentrations of other related aromatic reactive species in the<br>
reaction medium (e.g., para-toluic acid and 4-carboxy benzaldehyde).<br>
As is demonstrated in subsequent examples, detailed calculational<br>
models show that the actual range of para-xylene concentration within the liquid<br>
phase of the reaction medium of this example was well in excess of 100:1.<br>
Even without executing a rigorous calculational model, those skilled in the art<br>
will recognize that the actual maximum concentration of para-xylene occurred<br>
in the region near where the feed para-xylene was introduced to the bubble<br>
column reaction vessel through the vessel wall. This elevation of maximum<br>
para-xylene concentration is about 4.35 meters above the lower TL, in between<br>
the samples take from about 12.4 meters and from the underflow. Similarly, the<br>
actual minimum concentration of para-xylene likely occurred at or very near the<br>
top of the reaction medium at about 25 meters, well above the highest elevation<br>
from where the above samples were taken.<br>
Concentrations of para-xylene and other oxidizable compounds can be<br>
measured for other locations within the reaction medium by employing suitable<br>
mechanical devices for sampling at any position vertically or horizontally<br>
within the reaction medium. Optionally, concentrations for positions not<br>
physically sampled and chemically analyzed may be calculated with reasonable<br>
accuracy using computational models of sufficient intricacy to cope with the<br>
highly complex fluid flow patterns, chemical reaction kinetics, energy balance,<br>
vapor-liquid-solid equilibriums, and inter-phase exchange rates.<br>
EXAMPLES 2-5<br>
Examples 2-5 are calculational models of bubble column reactors either<br>
identical to the reactor of Example 1 or generally similar with specified<br>
improvements. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling performed<br>
to generate Examples 2-5 was performed in accordance with the modeling<br>
method disclosed in co-pending U.S. Pat. App. Ser. No. 60/594,774 entitled<br>
"Modeling of Liquid-Phase Oxidation," the entire disclosure of which is<br>
expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In Examples 2-5, the CFD modeling is performed using CFX release 5.7<br>
(ANSYS, Inc. 275 Technology Drive, Canonsburg, PA 15317). Examples 2-5<br>
comprise upwards of about 100,000 discrete spatial computational cells each.<br>
Time steps useful in Examples 2-5 are less than 0.1 seconds. Multiple bubble<br>
sizes ranging in diameter from about 0.005 to about 0.20 meters prove useful to<br>
tune the CFD model to approximate closely to the average bubble hold-up<br>
assessed via differential pressure measurement, to the vertical bubble hold-up<br>
profile assessed via gamma-scanning, and to the horizontal profiles of bubble<br>
hold-up assessed via computed tomography (CT) scans. To select appropriate<br>
bubble sizes and populations in the CFD models of Example 2-5, actual plant<br>
operating data was obtained for slurry bubble columns with cylindrical inside<br>
diameters of about 2.44 meters and about 3.05 meters operating with the<br>
reaction medium near the pertinent composition and process conditions as<br>
disclosed below. The reference data for overall bubble hold-up were obtained<br>
using differential pressures measured from near the base of the vessel and up to<br>
the overhead off-gas. The reference data for vertical bubble-hold-up profile<br>
were obtained using a gamma-emitting radioactive source and detection method<br>
incremented up the outside of the reaction vessel in steps ranging from about<br>
0.05 meters to about 0.3 meters. The reference data for horizontal bubble holdup<br>
profiles were obtained by CT scans performed on a nine by nine grid across<br>
a horizontal plane of the operating bubble column using a gamma-emitting<br>
radioactive source and detection method. That is, the source was positioned at a<br>
given elevation at nine different positions spaced about equally around the<br>
perimeter of the bubble column. For each position of the gamma-radiation<br>
source, the amount of gamma-radiation passing through the reaction vessel and<br>
reaction medium was detected at nine different positions spaced about equally<br>
around the perimeter of the bubble column. Various mathematical models were<br>
then applied to this discrete data to produce estimations of the variation of<br>
bubble hold-up throughout the reaction medium for said elevation. Multiple<br>
horizontal CT scans were obtained on two different days, for two different<br>
elevations, and with two different feed rates of para-xylene, compressed air, etc.<br>
The chemical reaction model for consumption of para-xylene in this<br>
environment is tuned to match the reactant profiles for para-xylene as found in<br>
Example 1 along with other data for similar temperatures, pressures, reaction<br>
intensities, catalysis, water concentration, and so on, from both commercial and<br>
pilot scale testing. As an indicative approximation, the pseudo-first order time<br>
constant for decay of para-xylene reactive tracer is equal to about 0.2 reciprocal<br>
seconds for about 160°C and about the mean conditions of the reaction medium<br>
used in Examples 2-4.<br>
Importantly, the CFD models of flow fields obtained in Examples 2-4<br>
produce large scale fluctuations in bubble swarms and liquid surges that are<br>
generally consistent with the observed low frequency undulation in the<br>
operating bubble column reaction vessel.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
This example develops calculations pertinent to the mechanical<br>
configuration of Example 1 and sets a comparative basis for Examples 3 and 4.<br>
In this example, the mechanical configuration of the bubble column reactor is<br>
identical to Example 1, having a 0.076-meter circular diameter entry hole<br>
through the reaction vessel wall for the feed stream comprising para-xylene and<br>
filtrate solvent. The feed rate of para-xylene is about 1.84 kilograms per<br>
second, higher than in Example 1. The feed rate of filtrate solvent fed<br>
intimately commingled with the para-xylene is about 18.4 kilograms per second.<br>
The superficial velocity of the combined stream of para-xylene plus filtrate<br>
solvent entering through the wall hole is thus about 4 meters per second. The<br>
feed rate of reflux solvent in to the gas disengaging head space is 12.8<br>
kilograms per second. The feed rate of compressed air through the oxidant<br>
sparger is about 9 kilograms per second. The solids content of the reaction<br>
slurry is about 31 weight percent. The product slurry is withdrawn from the<br>
center of the bottom head of the reaction vessel using an effectively steady rate<br>
to maintain an approximately steady level of about 25 meters of reaction<br>
medium. The average gas hold-up for the mid-elevation of the reaction medium<br>
is about 55 percent on an area-averaged, time-averaged basis, where the length<br>
of time-averaging is at least about 100 seconds of CFD model time. The<br>
pressure in the headspace above the reaction medium is about 0.50 megapascal<br>
gauge. The temperature is about 160°C measured near the mid-elevation of the<br>
reaction medium. The contents of water and of cobalt, bromine, and manganese<br>
within the liquid portion of the reaction medium are essentially the same as in<br>
Example 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
This example develops calculations pertinent to improving dispersion of<br>
para-xylene feed by increasing the superficial velocity of the liquid-phase feed<br>
comprising para-xylene at its point of entry to the reaction medium according to<br>
one aspect of the current invention. In this example, the mechanical<br>
configuration of the bubble column reactor is identical to Example 2 except that<br>
the wall hole through which the liquid-phase feed comprising para-xylene is<br>
admitted is reduced to a 0.025 meter circular diameter. The feed rate of paraxylene<br>
and other process conditions are the same as for Example 2, excepting<br>
that the superficial velocity of the combined liquid-phase feed stream of paraxylene<br>
plus filtrate solvent entering through the wall hole is now about 36<br>
meters per second.<br>
The CFD model calculations of time-averaged fractions of reaction<br>
medium with para-xylene reactive tracer concentration in liquid phase above<br>
various thresholds are presented in Table 6, below. The volume of reaction<br>
medium with very highly concentrated para-xylene reactive tracer in the liquid<br>
phase is decreased by operating with higher inlet velocities of the liquid-phase<br>
feed stream comprising para-xylene according to the present invention. The<br>
reduced regions of high para-xylene concentration are important to limit<br>
undesirable coupling reactions both because concentrations of many soluble<br>
aromatic species are therein elevated and because such concentrations lead to<br>
locally high consumption of dissolved molecular oxygen and thereby lead to<br>
locally suppressed standing concentrations of dissolved molecular oxygen.<br>
(Table Removed)EXAMPLE 4<br>
This example develops calculations for improved mechanical means for<br>
introducing oxidant and para-xylene into the bubble column reactor. This<br>
example is executed within the same bubble column reactor as used in<br>
Examples 1-3. However, the reactor is modified with respect to the manner in<br>
which both the oxidant and the para-xylene are admitted into the reaction<br>
medium. In discussing Example 4, attention is first directed to the modified<br>
apparatus for admitting para-xylene to the reaction medium, thereby reducing<br>
zones of high concentrations of para-xylene. Secondly, attention is directed to<br>
the modified apparatus for admitting the oxidant to the reaction medium,<br>
thereby reducing zones that are poorly aerated. This is not to suppose that the<br>
two modifications are totally independent in their results, but it is simply a stepwise<br>
presentation.<br>
The amount of reaction medium with very high liquid phase<br>
concentrations of para-xylene reactive tracer is reduced in Example 4 by use of<br>
a liquid-phase feed distribution system generally as shown in FIGS. 9-11. This<br>
liquid-phase feed distribution system conveniently has four flow conduits<br>
conveniently standing approximately vertical. Each of these four flow conduits<br>
is about 0.75 meters from the vertical axis of symmetry of the bubble column.<br>
These four flow conduits are conveniently made from nominal 1.5-inch<br>
Schedule 10S piping components. The lower end of each leg in this example<br>
conveniently has a conically converging section with an included angle<br>
measured between opposite sides of the cone that is conveniently about 24<br>
degrees; however, other shapes are also useful to close the downstream end of<br>
the flow conduit (e.g. a conical closure with different included angle, a flat plate<br>
closure, a pipe cap closure, a wedge-shaped closure, and so on.) Each of these<br>
four flow conduits has a total of nine holes with each having a circular diameter<br>
of about 0.0063 meters. The lowest one of the nine holes in each conduit is at<br>
the bottom of the lower conical section. For each conduit, this lowest hole is<br>
located about 0.4 meters above the lower TL of the reaction vessel. Measuring<br>
always from this bottom end of the truncated bottom conical section, the next<br>
three holes in each conduit are elevated about 0.3 meters, the next three holes<br>
are elevated about 1.6 meters, and the topmost two holes are elevated about 2.7<br>
meters. Thus, the vertical distance from lowest hole to highest hole in each<br>
conduit is about 2.7 meters, or about 1.1D. The linear (not vertical) distance of<br>
farthest hole separation, from the bottom hole of one vertical conduit to the top<br>
hole of the vertical conduit diagonally opposite, is about 3.44 meters, or about<br>
1.4D. For each level, the holes are spaced about evenly around the<br>
circumference of each flow conduit. The supply conduit for the feed of<br>
oxidizable compound and solvent to the top of the four approximately vertical<br>
conduits is conveniently about horizontal at an elevation about 3.60 meters<br>
above the lower TL of the reaction vessel. The supply conduit is conveniently<br>
made from nominal 3-inch Schedule 10S piping components. There is<br>
appropriate mechanical cross-bracing within the assembly and mechanical<br>
bracing from the assembly to the oxidant sparger and to the reaction vessel in<br>
order to endure both static and dynamic forces occurring during both normal<br>
and upset operations.<br>
Although not calculated in this example, many other designs for this<br>
liquid-phase feed distribution system are possible. For example, the liquid flow<br>
conduit sizes can be larger or smaller or of different cross-section than<br>
approximately circular or of different count than four. For example, each of the<br>
four essentially vertical conduits could be fed independently via flow conduits<br>
separately traversing the pressure containing wall of the reaction vessel. For<br>
example, the connection to the supply of incoming para-xylene and feed solvent<br>
could come in near the mid-elevation or near the bottom elevation or at any<br>
elevation or at multiple elevations of the approximately vertical conduits. For<br>
example, the supply conduits could be approximately vertical with the<br>
distribution holes residing in approximately horizontal conduits, or both flow<br>
directions could be skewed or non-linear or non-orthogonal. For example, the<br>
holes could be located differently radially, azimuthally, or vertically with<br>
respect to the reaction medium. For example, more or fewer holes and/or holes<br>
of different shapes and/or holes with mixed sizes and/or mixed shapes can be<br>
used. For example, exit nozzles could be used rather than exit holes. For<br>
example, one or more flow deflection apparatus can lie outside of the flow<br>
conduit close to the exit holes and in path of fluids upon exiting into the<br>
reaction medium.<br>
Depending upon the solids character and content, if any, of the<br>
combined feed of para-xylene and solvent, or of the reaction medium, and<br>
depending upon the start-up, shutdown and other operating procedures<br>
employed in actual manufacturing operation, it may be necessary to purge solids<br>
from inside the liquid-phase feed distribution system. Although not calculated<br>
in this example, a purging hole may usefully be larger than the uniformly sized<br>
holes shown in the current example. The hole at the lower end of each of the<br>
four approximately vertical legs is particularly useful for purging solids,<br>
although it is not the only possible means. More complicated mechanical<br>
devices such as flapper assemblies, check valves, excess flow valves, power<br>
operated valves and the like may be used either to prevent ingress of solids or to<br>
discharge accumulated solids from within the liquid-phase feed distribution<br>
system.<br>
Now, attention is directed to the oxidant sparger, which is generally as<br>
show in FIGS. 12-15. This oxidant sparger ring member conveniently<br>
comprises a mitered flow conduit that is conveniently and approximately an<br>
equal-sided octagon without a crossing member. The mitered flow conduit is<br>
conveniently made from nominal 10-inch Schedule 10S piping components.<br>
The width of the octagon from the centroid of one side of the flow conduit to<br>
the centroid of the opposite side is about 1.12 meters. The octagonal section<br>
conveniently lies approximately horizontal, and the mid-elevation of the<br>
octagonal section is about 0.24 meters below the lower TL of the reaction<br>
vessel. This is in distinct contrast to the oxidant sparger ring member of<br>
Examples 1-3, the elevations of which are centered above the lower TL of the<br>
reaction vessel. The octagonal portion of the conduit is perforated with 64<br>
about circular holes each about 0.030 meters in diameter, approximately equally<br>
spaced around the conduit. About one-half of the holes are located around the<br>
conduit with locations that are at an angle of about 45 degrees below horizontal,<br>
measuring from each hole to the nearest centroid of the flow conduit crosssection.<br>
About one-half of the holes are located around the conduit with<br>
locations that are about at the bottom of the flow conduit (i.e., at an angle of<br>
about 90 degrees below horizontal, measuring from each hole to the nearest<br>
centroid of the flow conduit cross-section). The inventors again comment, akin<br>
to comments for the liquid-phase inlet distributor, that many other particular<br>
designs are possible for an oxidant sparger falling within the scope of several<br>
aspects of the present invention. For example, more or less than two supply<br>
conduits may transverse the pressure containing wall. For example, the supply<br>
conduits of the oxidant sparger may be designed without comprising a ring<br>
member. For example, more than one ring member may be present, and any<br>
ring member may have other than 8 sides or may have non-symmetrical sides.<br>
For example, the design may obtain a preferred pressure drop or a preferred<br>
quality of aeration or a preferred non-fouling nature while using a different<br>
number or size or sizes or placement of conduit holes or exits. For example, the<br>
design may employ different diameters of conduits within preferred ranges. For<br>
example, the design of may achieve a non-fouling nature by using a liquid flush.<br>
In this example, reaction medium is withdrawn with an effectively<br>
steady rate from the side of the reaction vessel at an elevation of about 14<br>
meters through a wall hole that has an inside circular diameter of about 0.076<br>
meters. The withdrawn reaction medium is separated into a product slurry<br>
comprising crude terephthalic acid and an off-gas by using an external deaeration<br>
vessel, which is described fully in Example 6. The separated off-gas<br>
from the external de-aeration vessel is conveyed by a conduit to join the main<br>
flow of off-gas leaving the top of the reaction vessel.<br>
The CFD modeling methods of this example are substantially the same<br>
as for Examples 2 and 3, with these exceptions. The spatial meshing is<br>
modified as appropriate and known in the art for the revised apparatus for<br>
distributing incoming oxidant, for distributing incoming oxidizable compound,<br>
and for removing product slurry from the side wall of the reaction vessel about<br>
14 meters above the lower TL.<br>
To evaluate the results of the CFD model with respect to distribution of<br>
the para-xylene reactive tracer, the same methods are used as in Examples 2 and<br>
3. Namely, the time-averaged fractions of reaction medium with para-xylene<br>
reactive tracer concentration in liquid phase above various thresholds are<br>
determined. For ease in comparison, the results of this example are presented in<br>
Table 6, above. These results show that improved distribution of para-xylene<br>
reactive tracer of this example actually causes a small rise in the amount of<br>
reaction medium above 1,000 ppmw, but the more harmful threshold levels of<br>
2,500 ppmw, 10,000 ppmw and 25,000 ppmw are reduced. These<br>
improvements are provided by, for example, higher feed inlet velocities along<br>
with improved vertical, radial and azimuthal positioning and spacing of the<br>
para-xylene introduction to the reaction medium.<br>
Now turning to the quality of aeration throughout the reaction medium,<br>
the method of 2,000 horizontal slices of equal sub-volume is used to evaluate<br>
the amount of poorly aerated volume within the reaction medium of Examples<br>
2-4. Beginning at the lowest portion of the reaction medium, namely at the<br>
bottom of the lower elliptical head in this example, the reaction medium is<br>
partitioned into 2,000 equal sub-volumes using theoretical horizontal planes.<br>
For each of the CFD model time increments, within each of said 2,000 equal<br>
sub-volumes, the amount of slurry and the amount of gas are determined and<br>
used to compute the average gas hold-up therein. To allow for the stochastic<br>
nature of the process, and of the CFD model thereof, the output from the CFD<br>
model is time-averaged through model times lasting at least about 100 seconds<br>
to obtain time-averaged values of gas-hold up in each of the 2,000 equal subvolumes.<br>
Once the time-averaged gas hold-up is determined for each of the 2,000<br>
equal sub-volumes, these values are compared to the threshold values disclosed<br>
herein. For each threshold, the total number of offending sub-volumes, those<br>
not exceeding the specified threshold value, are accounted. Table 7, below,<br>
shows the number of 2,000 horizontal equal volume slices of reaction medium<br>
with time-averaged gas hold-up below 10 volume percent, below 20 volume<br>
percent, and below 30 volume percent for both Example 2 and Example 4.<br>
Example 4 is importantly improved compared to Example 2.<br>
(Table Removed)In comparing calculational Examples 2 and 4, it is also notable that the<br>
para-xylene feed of Example 4 is released lower in the reaction medium and<br>
closer to the incoming oxidant stream than in Example 2.<br>
EXAMPLES 5 and 6<br>
Examples 5 and 6 are operational examples demonstrating in a<br>
commercial bubble column oxidizer the importance of minimizing regions of<br>
poor aeration, of improving the manner of introducing the commercial-purity<br>
para-xylene feed to be more disperse vertically, azimuthally, and radially, and<br>
of lowering the entry of commercial-purity para-xylene feed to be closer to the<br>
point of highest availability of molecular oxygen, according to the disclosures<br>
of the current invention. Additionally, these examples demonstrate a yield<br>
benefit from having an elevated slurry outlet.<br>
There are many different impurity compounds typically produced by the<br>
coupling of aromatic rings during the partial oxidation of para-xylene. One of<br>
these is 4,4'-dicarboxystilbene. This compound has a much higher absorption<br>
of light than terephthalic acid has, and it strongly reduces the optical<br>
transmittance of the intended product. In addition, 4,4'-dicarboxystilbene is a<br>
convenient impurity to use in monitoring the quality of a continuous oxidation<br>
because it partitions selectively to the solid phase of the reaction medium;<br>
therefore, very little 4,4'-dicarboxystilbene is typically present in the recycle<br>
solvent streams of the commercial bubble column reaction vessels disclosed in<br>
Examples 5 and 6. In Examples 5 and 6, the concentrations of 4,4'-<br>
dicarboxystilbene were measured with an analytical method employing HPLCMS<br>
calibrated with a suitable reference mixture comprising solvent and known<br>
amounts of several analytes specifically including a known amount of 4,4'-<br>
dicarboxystilbene. The HPLC-MS analytical method is described in above<br>
Detailed Description section.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
The bubble column reactor employed in this example has substantially<br>
the same mechanical configuration as the reactor of Examples 1 and 2. The<br>
reactor is at process conditions comparable to Example 6 and provides a<br>
comparative basis. The operating level was about 25 meters of reaction<br>
medium. The feed of commercial-purity para-xylene was effectively steady at a<br>
rate of about 81 kilograms per minute. A filtrate solvent was fed at an<br>
effectively steady rate of about 793 kilograms per minute. An unmetered<br>
fraction of this, estimated from conduit sizes and pressure drops to be about 20<br>
kilograms per minute, was feed as a liquid flush to the oxidant sparger. The<br>
balance of the filtrate solvent, about 773 kilograms per minute, was fed<br>
intimately commingled with the commercial-purity para-xylene. The combined<br>
liquid-phase stream of filtrate solvent and commercial-purity para-xylene thus<br>
amounted to about 854 kilograms per minute. This filtrate solvent was from a<br>
plant recycle system and was comprised of above about 97 weight percent of<br>
acetic acid and water. The concentration of catalyst components in the filtrate<br>
solvent was such that the composition within the liquid phase of the reaction<br>
medium was about 2,158 ppmw of cobalt, about 1,911 ppmw of bromine, and<br>
about 118 ppmw of manganese. A separate stream of reflux solvent was fed as<br>
droplets into the gas-disengaging zone above the operating level of the reaction<br>
medium at an effectively steady rate of about 546 kilograms per minute. This<br>
reflux solvent was comprised of above about 99 weight percent of acetic acid<br>
and water; and the reflux solvent was from a separate plant recycle system that<br>
was without significant levels of catalyst components. The combined water<br>
content of the filtrate solvent feed and of the reflux solvent feed was such that<br>
the concentration of water within the liquid phase of the reaction medium was<br>
about 5.8 weight percent. The oxidant was compressed air fed at an effectively<br>
steady rate of about 352 kilograms per minute. The operating pressure in the<br>
reaction vessel overhead gas was steadily about 0.42 megapascal gauge. The<br>
reaction vessel was operated in a substantially adiabatic manner so that the heat<br>
of reaction elevated the temperature of the incoming feeds and evaporated much<br>
of the incoming solvent. Measured near the mid-elevation of the reaction<br>
medium, the operating temperature was about 154.6°C. An exiting slurry<br>
comprising crude terephthalic acid (CTA) was removed from near the bottom of<br>
the lower elliptical head of the reaction vessel at an effectively steady rate of<br>
about 428 kilograms per minute.<br>
In this example, the ratio of the production rate of undesirable of 4,4'-<br>
dicarboxystilbene to the production rate of desired terephthalic acid was<br>
measured by HPLC-MS on three separate samples of slurry product as about<br>
8.6, 9.1, and 9.2 ppmw, thus averaging about 9.0 ppmw. The concentration of<br>
para-xylene in the liquid phase of the exiting slurry was measured by calibrated<br>
GC on three separate samples of slurry product as about 777, 539, and 618<br>
ppmw, thus averaging about 645 ppmw. The concentration of paratolualdehyde<br>
in the liquid phase of the exiting slurry was measured by<br>
calibrated GC on said separate samples of slurry product as about 1,055, 961,<br>
and 977 ppmw, thus averaging about 998 ppmw.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
The bubble column reactor of this example corresponds to the<br>
mechanical configuration developed in calculational Example 4. The reactor of<br>
this example comprises improvements in the elevation, velocity, number and<br>
spacing of para-xylene feed entries, thus providing improved distribution of<br>
para-xylene feed and improved staging against molecular oxygen. It further<br>
comprises improvements in the quality of aeration within the reaction medium,<br>
by using an improved oxidant sparger, and in the elevation and method for<br>
removing and de-aerating slurry exiting the reaction medium. Compared to<br>
Example 5, important improvements are seen for para-xylene yield, and<br>
important reductions are seen for impurity production.<br>
The reactor of this example had the improved mechanical configuration<br>
as described in CFD model Example 4. The operating level was about 25<br>
meters of reaction medium. The feed of commercial-purity para-xylene was<br>
effectively steady at a rate of about 81 kilograms per minute. A filtrate solvent<br>
was fed intimately commingled with the commercial-purity para-xylene at an<br>
effectively steady rate of about 744 kilograms per minute. The combined<br>
stream of filtrate solvent and commercial-purity para-xylene feed thus<br>
amounted to about 825 kilograms per minute. This filtrate solvent was from the<br>
same plant recycle system and of substantially the same composition as in<br>
Example 5. The concentration of catalyst components in the filtrate solvent was<br>
such that the composition within the liquid phase of the reaction medium was<br>
about 1,996 ppmw of cobalt, about 1,693 ppmw of bromine, and about 108<br>
ppmw of manganese. A separate stream of reflux solvent was fed as droplets<br>
into the gas-disengaging zone above the operating level of the reaction medium<br>
at an effectively steady rate of about 573 kilograms per minute. This reflux<br>
solvent was comprised of above about 99 weight percent of acetic acid and<br>
water; and the reflux solvent was from a separate plant recycle system that was<br>
without significant levels of catalyst components. The combined water content<br>
of the filtrate solvent feed and of the reflux solvent feed was such that the<br>
concentration of water within the liquid phase of the reaction medium was about<br>
5.7 weight percent. The oxidant was compressed air fed at an effectively steady<br>
rate of about 329 kilograms per minute. The operating pressure in the reaction<br>
vessel overhead gas was steadily about 0.41 megapascal gauge. The reaction<br>
vessel was operated in a substantially adiabatic manner so that the heat of<br>
reaction elevated the temperature of the incoming feeds and evaporated much of<br>
the incoming solvent. Measured near the mid-elevation of the reaction medium,<br>
the operating temperature was about 153.3°C.<br>
Reaction medium was withdrawn from the side of the reaction vessel at<br>
an elevation of about 14 meters through a wall hole that had an inside circular<br>
diameter of about 0.076 meters. The withdrawn reaction medium was conveyed<br>
through a substantially horizontal conduit made of nominal 3-inch Schedule 10S<br>
piping components into the side of a substantially vertical external de-aeration<br>
vessel. The external de-aeration vessel had an inside circular diameter of about<br>
0.315 meters, being constructed primarily of nominal 12-inch Schedule 10S<br>
pipe. The horizontal cross-sectional area inside the external de-aeration vessel<br>
was thus about 0.0779 meters squared. This compares to the horizontal crosssectional<br>
area inside the reaction vessel of about 4.67 meters squared for the<br>
elevation where the reaction medium was withdrawn. Thus, the ratio of the<br>
smaller to the greater horizontal cross-sectional area was about 0.017.<br>
The external de-aeration vessel extended downwards from the elevation<br>
of entering reaction medium by about 1.52 meters before transitioning down in<br>
diameter to match a bottom outlet flow conduit. An effectively steady flow<br>
rate of about 433 kilograms per minute of substantially de-aerated slurry<br>
comprising crude terephthalic acid exited from the bottom of the external deaeration<br>
vessel. Thus, the substantially de-aerated slurry in lower elevations of<br>
the nominal 12-inch de-aeration vessel had a downwards superficial velocity<br>
that was about 0.093 meters per second; and there was not a deleterious<br>
entrainment of oxidant in this exiting slurry. The exiting slurry was conveyed<br>
forward by a flow conduit made of nominal 3-inch Schedule 10S piping<br>
components to connect with downstream processing equipment. In this<br>
example, the means for controlling the flow rate of withdrawn reaction medium<br>
was located in the flow exiting the bottom of the de-aeration vessel, though<br>
other control locations are possible and useful.<br>
The external de-aeration vessel extended above the elevation at which<br>
reaction medium entered by about 14 meters before transitioning from a<br>
nominal 12-inch piping size down in diameter to match an upper outlet flow<br>
conduit made of nominal 2-inch Schedule 10S piping components. The<br>
separated off-gas from the external de-aeration vessel was conveyed through<br>
this nominal 2-inch conduit to join the main flow of off-gas leaving the top of<br>
the reaction vessel.<br>
In this example, the ratio of the production rate of undesirable of 4,4'-<br>
dicarboxystilbene to the production rate of desired terephthalic acid was<br>
measured by HPLC-MS on three separate samples of slurry product as about<br>
2.3, 2.7, and 3.2 ppmw-averaging about 2.7 ppmw. This is importantly reduced<br>
compared to Example 5. The concentration of para-xylene in the liquid phase<br>
of the slurry exiting from the elevated side outlet was measured by calibrated<br>
GC on three separate samples of slurry product as about 86, 87 and 91 ppmwaveraging<br>
about 88 ppmw. The concentration of para-tolualdehyde in the liquid<br>
phase of the exiting slurry was measured by calibrated GC on said separate<br>
samples of slurry product as about 467, 442, and 423 ppmw-averaging about<br>
444 ppmw. This is a conversion and yield improvement in the withdrawn slurry<br>
flow compared to Example 5.<br>
EXAMPLES 7-10<br>
Examples 7-10 are calculated examples relating particularly to the initial<br>
dispersion of para-xylene into the reaction medium, but also demonstrating<br>
other aspects of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
This example relates to feeding of vaporized para-xylene. In this<br>
calculated example, para-xylene feed is heated and vaporized before admission<br>
to the reaction medium. This aids initial dispersion of the para-xylene. It<br>
provides enlarged entering volumes and facilitates increased velocities.<br>
Furthermore, it retards the transfer of the incoming para-xylene into the bulk<br>
liquid phase and causes the para-xylene feed to move toward the reactive liquid<br>
phase in better harmony with the gaseous feeding of molecular oxygen.<br>
hi this example, a bubble column oxidizer vessel has a vertical,<br>
cylindrical body with an inside diameter of 2.44 meters. The height of the<br>
bubble column oxidizer vessel is 32 meters from lower tangent line (TL) to<br>
upper TL. The vessel is fitted with 2:1 elliptical heads at the top and bottom of<br>
the cylinder. The operating level is about 25 meters of reaction medium above<br>
the lower TL. The feed of filtrate solvent, which is separated from para-xylene,<br>
enters at a rate of 18.4 kilograms per second through a 0.076 meter circular<br>
diameter entry hole through the reaction vessel wall at an elevation of 4.35<br>
meters above the lower TL. The feed rate of reflux solvent is about 14.3<br>
kilograms per second into the gas-disengaging zone above the operating level of<br>
the reaction medium. The feed rate of compressed air is about 9 kilograms per<br>
second through an oxidant sparger essentially the same as in Examples 4 and 6.<br>
Slurry containing about 31 weight percent solids is withdrawn from the reaction<br>
medium through a side draw leg essentially the same as in Examples 4 and 6.<br>
The pressure in the headspace above the reaction medium is about 0.50<br>
megapascal gauge. The contents of water and of cobalt, bromine and<br>
manganese within the liquid portion of the reaction medium are essentially the<br>
same as in Example 4.<br>
The feed rate of para-xylene is 1.84 kilograms per second. Prior to<br>
release into the reaction medium, the feed stream of liquid-phase para-xylene is<br>
pressurized and then vaporized at a pressure of about 0.69 megapascal gauge by<br>
heating from a storage temperature of about 40°C up to a temperature of about<br>
233°C. This requires about 1.3 megajoules per second of heat input to the feed<br>
stream of para-xylene. A heat exchanger utilizing steam at 4 megapascal is<br>
employed for this duty, but any other energy source of sufficient temperature<br>
will suffice equally, including waste heat from process fluids. This heat input<br>
represents about 5 percent of the heat of reaction for para-xylene conversion to<br>
terephthalic acid. Removal of this additional heat load causes the reaction<br>
medium temperature to rise somewhat at constant pressure, in comparison to<br>
feeding para-xylene liquid. (See Example 8.) The temperature is about 162°C<br>
measured near the mid-elevation of the reaction medium. Optionally, pressure<br>
could be lowered to reduce reaction temperature to 160°C measured near the<br>
mid-elevation of the reaction medium.<br>
The volumetric flow of vaporized para-xylene is about 0.084 cubic<br>
meters per second. This flow is admitted to the reaction vessel at an elevation<br>
of 0.1 meters above the lower TL of the vessel through 3 conduits connected in<br>
parallel. Adjacent to the reaction vessel, each conduit is made from nominal<br>
1.5-inch piping components and connects to a circular hole of equal diameter in<br>
the vessel wall. The 3 wall holes are situated with 120-degree horizontal,<br>
azimuthal spacing from each other. The superficial velocity of each entering<br>
stream of para-xylene is approximately 21 meters per second, and the entering<br>
para-xylene is being dispersed within the reaction medium at the same time it is<br>
dissolving into the reactive liquid phase, where the catalyst species principally<br>
reside.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
This example relates to feeding partly vaporized para-xylene. In this<br>
calculated example, para-xylene feed is partly vaporized by mixing with the<br>
oxidant supply before admission to the reaction medium. This aids initial<br>
dispersion of the para-xylene. It provides enlarged entering volumes and<br>
facilitates increased velocities; and it dilutes the concentration of para-xylene.<br>
Furthermore, it retards the transfer of the incoming para-xylene into the bulk<br>
liquid phase and causes the para-xylene feed to move toward the reactive liquid<br>
phase in better harmony with the gaseous feeding of molecular oxygen.<br>
In this example, a bubble column oxidizer vessel has a vertical,<br>
cylindrical body with an inside diameter of 2.44 meters. The height of the<br>
bubble column oxidizer vessel is 32 meters from lower tangent line (TL) to<br>
upper TL. The vessel is fitted with 2:1 elliptical heads at the top and bottom of<br>
the cylinder. The operating level is about 25 meters of reaction medium above<br>
the lower TL. The feed of filtrate solvent, which is separated from para-xylene,<br>
enters at a rate of 18.4 kilograms per second through a 0.076-meter circular<br>
diameter entry hole through the reaction vessel wall at an elevation of 4.35<br>
meters above the lower TL. The feed rate of reflux solvent into the gasdisengaging<br>
zone above the operating level of the reaction medium is about<br>
12.8 kilograms per second. The feed rate of compressed air is about 9 kilograms<br>
per second through an oxidant sparger similar to the one in Examples 4 and 6,<br>
but modified as noted below. Slurry containing about 31 weight percent solids<br>
is withdrawn from the reaction medium through a side draw leg essentially the<br>
same as in Examples 4 and 6. The pressure in the headspace above the reaction<br>
medium is about 0.50 megapascal gauge. The contents of water and of cobalt,<br>
bromine and manganese within the liquid portion of the reaction medium are<br>
essentially the same as in Example 4.<br>
The feed rate of para-xylene is again 1.84 kilograms per second. This<br>
flows as a liquid through conduits to the interior of the oxidant sparger where<br>
the liquid is released into the compressed air at 4 positions using liquid spray<br>
nozzles, as known in the art. Optionally, open ended liquid conduits or gasliquid<br>
spray nozzles may be employed at the point where liquid is admitted to<br>
the oxidant sparger. As a safety precaution, 4 temperature sensors are placed<br>
within the oxidant sparger. These temperature sensors are connected to alarms<br>
and interlocks to shut off the supply of oxidant and para-xylene if high<br>
temperatures are detected. With the compressed air supply at about 80°C,<br>
owing to the heat of compression without an aftercooler on the final<br>
compression stage, and with the feed para-xylene at about 40°C, approximately<br>
17 weight percent of the para-xylene is vaporized at the pressure prevailing<br>
inside the oxidant sparger. The remaining liquid para-xylene is carried into the<br>
reaction medium with the gas in two phase flow commingled with the gas at<br>
velocities approaching those of the gas flow. In addition, said remaining liquid<br>
helps flush from the oxidant sparger any solids that have intruded, according to<br>
aspects of the invention.<br>
The temperature is about 160°C measured near the mid-elevation of the<br>
reaction medium. Since no additional energy has been added to any feed<br>
stream, this is about the same as Examples 4 and 6.<br>
Optionally, either the compressed air feed or the para-xylene feed can be<br>
pre-heated before mixing in the oxidant sparger in order to increase the fraction<br>
of para-xylene that enters the reaction medium as vapor. For example, a heat<br>
input of 300 kilojoules per second to the para-xylene raises its temperature to<br>
about 124°C and increases the fraction of para-xylene flashed to about 33<br>
percent. For example, a heat input of 600 kilojoules per second to the<br>
compressed air raises its temperature to about 146°C and increases the fraction<br>
of para-xylene flashed to about 54 percent. In both cases lower grade energy is<br>
required for heating than in Example 7. In fact, the waste heat from the off-gas<br>
from the reaction medium can be used as all or part of the heat source.<br>
However, when an amount of energy is added to the feeds, the temperature of<br>
the reaction medium will rise slightly, settling, at the stated pressure, flows and<br>
phase compositions, between 160°C and 162°C measured near the mid<br>
elevation. Optionally, the pressure can be adjusted to adjust temperature. In<br>
addition, when an amount of energy is added to the feeds, the amount of solvent<br>
fed to the reaction vessel is adjusted when it is desired to hold solids fraction<br>
approximately constant. For example, the reflux solvent flow varies between<br>
about 12.8 and about 14.3 kilograms per second in Examples 7 and 8,<br>
depending on the amount of energy added, in order to hold solids approximately<br>
constant near 31 weight percent.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
This example relates to feeding para-xylene away from the wall of the<br>
reaction vessel using a liquid eductor. In this calculated example, initial<br>
dispersion of para-xylene liquid feed is improved by using an eductor<br>
employing liquid flow as the motive force. The reactor of this example has the<br>
same mechanical configuration and process boundary conditions as Example 4<br>
with the exceptions described below. The commingled liquid-phase stream of<br>
para-xylene plus filtrate solvent enters through the reaction vessel wall at the<br>
same elevation through the same nominal 3-inch flow conduit. However, rather<br>
than the internal liquid-phase feed distribution system of Example 4, the<br>
commingled liquid-phase feed is released into the reaction medium as the<br>
motive fluid in flow eductor as known in the art and as shown in the diagram of<br>
FIG. 26. The eductor is designed for a pressure difference of 0.1 megapascal on<br>
the motive fluid. The eductor is located and oriented with the flow plume<br>
exiting vertically upwards along the axial center line of the reaction vessel at an<br>
elevation about 4.5 meters above the lower TL. The volume of reaction<br>
medium educted and commingled with the motive liquid varies with time<br>
depending upon stochastic bubble swarm events in the bubble column at the<br>
eduction inlet. However, the time averaged educted flow is greater than the<br>
motive fluid flow thus providing a more rapid dilution of incoming para-xylene.<br>
Subsequent mixing and chemical reaction occurs according to the usual<br>
stochastic events in the bubble column.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
This example relates to feeding para-xylene away from the wall of the<br>
reaction vessel using a gas and liquid eductor. In this calculated example, initial<br>
dispersion of para-xylene feed is improved by using an eductor employing gas<br>
flow as the motive force. The reactor of this example has the same mechanical<br>
configuration and process boundary conditions as Example 4, with the<br>
exceptions described below. The octagonal oxidant sparger and the liquidphase<br>
feed distribution system are both removed. Instead, the incoming oxidant<br>
stream and the commingled liquid-phase feed of para-xylene plus filtrate<br>
solvent are conveyed though separate conduits to the interior of the reaction<br>
vessel. There, both streams are combined as motive fluids at the inlet of a flow<br>
eductor as known in the art and as shown in the diagram of FIG. 27. The<br>
eductor is aligned vertically along the axial centerline of the reaction vessel. It<br>
is positioned with outlet facing downward and located 0.2 meters below the<br>
lower tangent line of the reaction vessel. The eductor is designed for a pressure<br>
difference of 0.1 megapascal on the motive fluids. Two temperature sensors are<br>
located near where the compressed air and para-xylene feeds first combine.<br>
These temperature sensors are connected to alarms and interlocks to shut off the<br>
supply of oxidant and para-xylene if high temperatures are detected.<br>
The volume of reaction medium educted is increased compared Example<br>
9 and the initial dilution of incoming para-xylene is further improved. In<br>
addition, the liquid phase portion of the reaction medium with highest local<br>
concentrations of para-xylene is even more directly staged against the gas-phase<br>
portion with highest concentration of molecular oxygen. Subsequent mixing<br>
and chemical reaction occurs according to the usual stochastic events in the<br>
bubble column.<br>
EXAMPLES 11-13<br>
Examples 11-13 are calculated examples relating particularly to using<br>
flows of liquid from the reaction medium in conduits to aid the initial dispersion<br>
of para-xylene into the reaction medium, but also demonstrating other aspects of<br>
the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
This example relates to using a flow conduit within the reaction vessel to<br>
transport liquid to aid the initial dispersion of entering para-xylene. The reactor<br>
of this example has the same mechanical configuration and process boundary<br>
conditions as Example 4, with the exceptions described below. Reference is<br>
made to the diagram of FIG. 24. The commingled liquid-phase stream of paraxylene<br>
plus filtrate solvent enters through the reaction vessel wall through a<br>
nominal 3-inch flow conduit similar to Example 4. However, the internal<br>
liquid-phase feed distribution system of Example 4 is removed and said<br>
commingled liquid flow is instead released into a flow conduit. The flow<br>
conduit has a circular inside diameter of about 0.15 meters for most of its<br>
length, including its lower terminus, which is 1 meter above the lower TL of the<br>
vessel. The flow conduit rises vertically to a total height of 21 meters above the<br>
lower TL of the vessel. At a height of 20 meters above the lower TL of the<br>
vessel, the flow conduit expands to have an inside cross sectional area of 0.5<br>
square meters while rising in height for another 1 meter. This upper, larger<br>
diameter section of said flow conduit may be conceived as an internal deaeration<br>
vessel, and it is actually formed in part using the wall of the reaction<br>
vessel. The entirety of the flow conduit is located within the reaction vessel. At<br>
the top inlet to the flow conduit, the reaction medium is greatly depleted of<br>
para-xylene and para-tolualdehyde, though important concentrations of paratoluic<br>
acid and 4-carboxybenzaldehyde exist. Reaction medium entering the<br>
top of said flow conduit substantially de-aerates, creating a denser medium on<br>
the inside of said flow conduit than in the rest of the reaction vessel. The slurry<br>
within the flow conduit moves downward at a rate estimated to be about 150<br>
kilograms per second, at which point the flowing pressure drop, integrated over<br>
the entire length of said flow conduit, comes into balance with the density<br>
difference between inside and outside, integrated over the entire length of said<br>
flow conduit. Of this downwards flow of slurry, about 104 kilograms per<br>
second is liquid, amounting to about 69 weight percent. The feed flow of<br>
intimately commingled para-xylene and filtrate solvent, totaling about 20.2<br>
kilograms per second, is admitted to the said flow conduit about 5 meters above<br>
the lower TL. This mixture then travels down the flow conduit an additional 4<br>
meters, about 27 conduit diameters, in less than 1 second and becomes<br>
appreciably mixed. The concentration of para-xylene is thus usefully reduced to<br>
about 15,000 ppmw before being released into the main body of reaction<br>
medium in the bubble column. Subsequent mixing and chemical reaction<br>
occurs according to the usual stochastic events in the bubble column.<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
This example relates to using a flow conduit external to the reaction<br>
vessel to transport liquid to aid the initial dispersion of entering para-xylene.<br>
The reactor of this example has the same mechanical configuration and process<br>
boundary conditions as Example 11 with the exceptions described below and<br>
with reference to the diagram of FIG. 25. The internal flow conduit is removed<br>
and replaced with an external flow conduit. The section of conduit connecting<br>
the reaction vessel to the external de-aeration section has an inside circular<br>
diameter of 0.30 meters and is located 20 meters above the lower TL. The<br>
inside circular diameter of the external de-aeration section is 1 meter and its<br>
height is 2 meters. The inside circular diameter of the flow conduit below the<br>
de-aeration section is 0.20 meters allowing for larger flows using about the<br>
same available elevation head. A flow sensor and a flow control valve are<br>
included with the flow conduit in order to control the flow rate in the desired<br>
range. For example, the flow control is set to allow 150 kilograms per second<br>
of slurry transport, the same as is estimated to occur via the internal flow<br>
conduit of Example 11. The commingled liquid-phase stream of para-xylene<br>
and filtrate solvent is admitted to the external flow conduit about 5 meters<br>
above the lower TL of the reaction vessel. The outlet of the external flow<br>
conduit connects to the bottom head of the reaction vessel. Thus, the<br>
concentration of para-xylene is again usefully reduced to about 15,000 ppmw<br>
before being released into the main body of reaction medium in the bubble<br>
column. Subsequent mixing and chemical reaction occurs according to the<br>
usual stochastic events in the bubble column. The product slurry withdrawal for<br>
post-processing is via a branch from said flow conduit below the de-aeration<br>
section and above the addition of the liquid-phase stream of para-xylene and<br>
filtrate solvent, thus avoiding the need for a separate system for removing and<br>
de-aerating slurry.<br>
EXAMPLE 13<br>
This example relates to using a flow conduit comprised of sections both<br>
external and internal to the reaction vessel to transport liquid to aid the initial<br>
dispersion of entering para-xylene. This calculated example is identical to<br>
Example 12 except that a second branch in the external flow conduit is located<br>
about 3 meters above the lower TL of the reaction vessel, which is below the<br>
addition point of commingled liquid-phase stream of para-xylene and filtrate<br>
solvent. The second branch flow conduit also has an inside circular diameter of<br>
0.20 meters. A separate flow control valve is placed in the second branch flow<br>
conduit, again to regulate the flow. The branch flow conduit penetrates through<br>
the side wall of the reaction vessel 3 meters above the lower TL, and the branch<br>
flow conduit extends inside the wall of the reaction vessel by 0.4 meters. Thus,<br>
the branch conduit comprises sections both external and internal to the reaction<br>
vessel. Flow may be admitted to the reaction vessel through either or both of<br>
the bottom-head conduit exit or the side-wall-internal conduit exit and in any<br>
ratio.<br>
