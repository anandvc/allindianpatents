Stabilized Body Care Products. Household Products, Textiles And Fabrics<br>
The present invention relates to the use of selected hindered nitroxyl, hydroxylamine and hydroxylamine salt compounds and selected organic UV filters for the protection of body care products, personal care products, household products, fabric care products, institutional &amp; industrial products, textiles and fabrics against the deleterious effects of light, heat and oxygen.<br>
Since consumers today can choose from a large variety of Home &amp; Personal Care products, producers need to communicate clearly how their brands are unique. Sophisticated products containing new fragrances and actives in many colorful formulations, displayed in transparent and translucent packaging are today very common.<br>
It is mandatory for commercial success that the pleasant appearance, product efficacy and the fresh smell of a consumer product will last during its whole product life cycle even when exposed heavily to UV-light. This exposure can result in decomposition processes and strong color fading destroying the product appearance, active ingredients and fragrance.<br>
Various stabilization techniques of clear package products by absorption of UV light are commonly used and well known. For example broad-band UV light stabilizers of the benzotriazole class enhance product's stability and shelf live due to their very good UV-A and UV-B absorption properties, compared to other absorbers such as benzophenones where mainly UV- B light is absorbed.<br>
However, by just the absorption of UV light, not all potential degradation pathways are blocked.<br>
Surprisingly it was found that an effective protection can be achieved with specific compounds selected from nitroxyl compounds, hindered hydroxylamine compounds and hindered hydroxylamine salt compounds and specific organic UV absorbers.<br>
Background<br>
WO 01/07550 teaches the treatment of fabric with hindered amine stabilizers.<br><br>

Deodorising active ingredients<br>
As deodorising active ingredients there come into consideration, for example, antiperspi-rants, for example aluminium chlorohydrates (see J. Soc. Cosm. Chem. 24, 281 (1973)). Under the trade mark Locron® of Hoechst AG, Frankfurt (FRG), there is available comer-cially, for example, an aluminium chlorohydrate corresponding to formula AI2(OH)5CI x 2.5 H20, the use of which is especially preferred (see J.

Esterase inhibitors may be added as further deodorising active ingredients. Such inhibitors are preferably trialkyl citrates, such as trimethyl citrate, tripropyl citrate, triisopropyl citrate, tributyl citrate and especially triethyl citrate (Hydagen CAT, Henkel), which inhibit enzyme activity and hence reduce odour formation. Further substances that come into consideration as esterase inhibitors are sterol sulfates or phosphates, for example lanosterol, cholesterol, campesterol, stigmasterol and sitosterol sulfate or phosphate, dicar-boxylic acids and esters thereof, for example glutaric acid, glutaric acid monoethyl ester, glu-taric acid diethyl ester, adipic acid, adipic acid monoethyl ester, adipic acid diethyl ester, ma-Ionic acid and malonic acid diethyl ester and hydroxycarboxylic acids and esters thereof, for example citric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid or tartaric acid diethyl ester.

Hvdrotropic agents<br>
To improve the flow behaviour it is also possible to employ hydrotropic agents, for example ethoxylated or non ethoxylated mono-alcohols, diols or polyols with a low number of carbon atoms or their ethers (e.g. ethanol, isopropanol, 1,2-dipropanediol, propyleneglycol, glyerin, ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monoethylether, ethylene glycol monobutylether, propylene glycol monomethylether, propylene glycol monoethylether, propylene glycol monobutylether, diethylene glycol monomethylether; diethylene glycol monoethylether, diethylene glycol monobutylether and similar products).

Generally, for the coloration of household- and body care products all substances are suitable which have an absorption in the visible light of electromagnetic radiation (wavelength of ca. 4000 to 700 nm). The absorption is often caused by the following chromophores: Azo- (mono-, di, tris-, or poly-)stilbene-, carotenoide-, diarylmethan-, triarylmethan-, xanthen-, acridin-, quinoline, methin- (also polymethin-), thiazol-, indamin-, indophenol-, azin-, oxazin, thiazin-, anthraquinone-, indigoid-, phtalocyanine- and further synthetic, natural and/or inorganic chromophores.<br>
The present stabilizer systems are also used in household cleaning and treatment agents, for example in laundry products and fabric softeners, liquid cleansing and scouring agents, glass detergents, neutral cleaners (all-purpose cleaners), acid household cleaners (bath), bathroom cleaners, for instance in washing, rinsing and dishwashing agents, kitchen and oven cleaners, clear rinsing agents, dishwasher detergents, shoe polishes, polishing waxes, floor detergents and polishes, metal, glass and ceramic cleaners, textile-care products, rug cleaners and carpet shampoos, agents for removing rust, color and stains (stain remover salt), furniture and multipurpose polishes and leather and vinyl dressing agents (leather and vinyl sprays) and air fresheners.<br>
The present invention also concerns home care and fabric care products such as drain cleaners, disinfectant solutions, upholstery cleaners, automotive care products (e.g., to clean and/or polish and protect paint, tires, chrome, vinyl, leather, fabric, rubber, plastic and fabric),<br><br>
degreasers, polishes (glass, wood, leather, plastic, marble, granite, and tile, etc.), and metal polishes and cleaners. Antioxidants are suitable to protect fragrances in above products as well as in dryer sheets. The present invention also relates to home care products such as candles, gel candles, air fresheners and fragrance oils (for the home).<br>
The stabilizers of the present invention may be employed in fabric treatment that takes place after use of the fabric, referred to as fabric care. Such treatments include laundering, which uses detergents, laundry aids and/or fabric conditioner, and the application of non-detergent based fabric care products, such as spray-on products. When employed in this fashion, the present stabilizers are intended for deposition onto the fabric and used to protect the fabric, colorants and fragrances associated with said these fabrics from environmental damage.<br>
Typical examples of household cleaning and treating agents are:<br><br>
The present stabilizers are for example incorporated by dissolution in an oil phase or alcoholic or water phase, where required at elevated temperature.<br>
The present invention also pertains to a method of stabilizing a body care product, household product, textile or fabric, which comprises incorporating therein or applying thereto at least one compound of component (b) and at least one compound of component (c), preferably at least one compound of the formulae A to EE and A* to EE*.<br><br>
Preferably a dibenzoylmethane derivative (= component C1), most preferably 1-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propane-1,3-dione is used as component (c).<br>
In the case of stabilized fabrics, for example dyed fabrics, the present stabilizers are applied thereto via deposition from for instance detergents, fabric conditioners or non-detergent based fabric care products.<br>
The present fabrics are natural or synthetic, and may be woven or nonwoven.<br>
The present invention also pertains to a method of stabilizing a body care product, household product, textile or fabric, each of which contain a dye, which comprises incorporating therein or applying thereto at least one compound of the formulae (I), (II) and (III) (=component (b)), and at least one compound of component (c), for example at least one compound of the formulae A to EE and A* to EE* and at least one compound of component (c).<br>
Preferably a dibenzoylmethane derivative (= component C1) is used as component (c) and most preferably 1 -(4-tert-butyIphenyl)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propane-1,3-dione.<br>
The stabilizers of formulae (I), (II) and (III) (=component (b)) together with the organic UV absorbers (component (c)) are very effective towards the stabilization of dyes in the present compositions.<br>
The textiles of this invention are for example textile fiber materials, for example nitrogen-containing or hydroxy-group-containing fiber materials, for instance textile fiber materials selected from cellulose, silk, wool, synthetic polyamides, leather and polyurethanes. Included are cotton, linen and hemp, pulp and regenerated cellulose. Included also are cellulosic blends, for example mixtures of cotton and polyamide or cotton/polyester blends.<br>
The additives of the present invention are for example applied to textiles in a dyeing or printing process, or in a finishing process. For instance, the additives may be applied as part of a dye formulation. The additives may be applied to textiles for example in an ink-jet printing process. The additives are for example applied as part of an aqueous dye solution or printing paste. They may be applied in an exhaust method or dyeing by the padder dyeing<br><br>
method, in which the textiles are impregnated with aqueous dye solutions, which may contain salts, and the dyes and additives are fixed, after an alkali treatment or in the presence of alkali, if appropriate with the action of heat or by storage at room temperature for several hours. After fixing, the dyeings or prints are rinsed thoroughly with cold and hot water, if appropriate with the addition of an agent which has a dispersing action and promotes diffusion of the non-fixed portions.<br>
The dye or ink formulations for application to textiles may comprise further customary additves, for example surfactants, antifoams, antimicrobials and the like, for example as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,281,339, 6,353,094 and 6,323,327, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention is the photo stabilizing of the UV filters according to component (c).<br>
