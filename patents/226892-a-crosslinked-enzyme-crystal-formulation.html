				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the<br>
application of biocatalysis technology for performing<br>
selected chemical reactions. In one embodiment, this<br>
invention relates to crosslinke enyme crystal<br>
formulations and their use as catalysts in chemical<br>
reactions involving organic solvents. This invention<br>
also provides methods for producing crosslinked enzyme<br>
crystal formulations and methods using them to optimize<br>
chemical reactions in organic solvents, including those<br>
used in industrial scale chemical processes.<br>
BACKGROUND QF THE INVENTION<br>
The use of proteins, such as enzymes, as<br>
catalysts in industrial-scale synthesis of specialty<br>
chemicals and pharmaceuticals has received much<br>
attention in recent years [K. Faber and M.C.R.<br>
Franssen, Trends in Biochem. Tech-. 11, pp. 461-70<br>
(1993)]. Enzymes are recognized as useful tools for<br>
accomplishing chemical reactions in a stereo-, regio-<br>
and chemoselective manner. The ability of enzymes to<br>
function under mild conditions, ease of disposal and<br><br>
minimal waste production are further advantages<br>
associated with their use. Enzymes are also used for<br>
catalysis in organic solvents to solubilize substrates<br>
and products and to manipulate reaction kinetics and<br>
equilibrium in order to increase product yield.<br>
While enzymes offer impressive synthetic<br>
potential over current nonenzymatic technology, their<br>
commercial use has been limited by disadvantages such<br>
as poor stability, variability in performance,<br>
difficulty of isolation and purification, difficulty in<br>
handling, high cost and long reaction times.<br>
Furthermore, organic solvents are often incompatible<br>
with enzymes, leading to enzyme degradation or<br>
inactivation [A.M. Klibanov,"Asymmetric<br>
Transformations Catalyzed by Enzymes in Organic<br>
Solvents", Acc. Chem. Res., 23, pp. 114-20 (1990)]. In<br>
order for enzymes to function as viable industrial<br>
catalysts, they must be able to function without<br>
excessive intervention in the practical environments of<br>
manufacturing processes. Such environments include<br>
polar and non-polar organic solvents and aqueous-<br>
organic solvent mixtures. The low activity of enzymes<br>
and their aversion to organic solvents have remained<br>
barriers to widespread use of these proteins in routine<br>
organic syntheses. Even when such syntheses are<br>
catalyzed by enzymes, it is not unusual to see<br>
processes employing more enzyme than substrate by<br>
weight. See, for example, R. Bovara et al.,<br>
Tetrahedron: Asymmetry, 2, pp. 931-38 (1991); Y.-F.<br>
Wang et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 110, pp. 7200-05<br>
(1988); A. Palomaer et al., Chirality, 5, pp. 320-28<br>
(1993) and V. Gotor et al., Tetrahedron. 47, pp. 9207-<br>
14 (1991).<br><br>
Two methods designed to overcome these<br>
disadvantages — enzyme purification and enzyme<br>
immobilization — have addressed some of these<br>
disadvantages. However, they have not solved the<br>
problem of loss of enzyme activity or stability in<br>
organic solvents. Immobilization has actually<br>
exacerbated these problems by incurring higher costs<br>
and diluting the activity of the enzyme by the addition<br>
of support materials. Enzyme purification also incurs<br>
added cost and, in most cases fails to increase enzyme<br>
activity in organic solvents. For example, the<br>
potential synthetic benefits of purified lipases in<br>
organic solvents have not been realized [T. Nishio and<br>
M. Kamimura, Agric. Biol. Chem., 52, pp. 2631-32<br>
(1988); T. Yamane et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng., 36, pp.<br>
1063-69 (1990)]. The cost of purified lipases is<br>
higher than that of their crude counterparts, while<br>
their stability and activity in organic solvents is<br>
lower [R. Bovara et al., Biotechnol. Lett., 15, pp.<br>
169-74 (1993); E. Wehtje et al., Biotechnol. Bioena.,<br>
41, pp. 171-78 (1993); G. Ottolina et al., Biotechnol.<br>
Lett., 14, pp. 947-52 (1992)].<br>
Recent studies have demonstrated that enzyme<br>
activity in organic solvents is intimately related to<br>
water content, size and morphology of the catalyst<br>
particles and the enzyme microenvironment [A.M.<br>
Klibanov, "Enzymatic Catalysis in Anhydrous Organic<br>
Solvents", Trends in Biochem. sci , 14, pp. 141-44<br>
(1989)]. These parameters have been adjusted by<br>
preparing lyophilized complexes of enzymes with<br>
carbohydrates, organic buffers or salts [K. Dabulis and<br>
A.M. Klibanov, Biotechnol. Bi.nPnrr. . 41, pp. 566-71<br>
(1993); A.D. Blackwood et al.,Biochim.Biophys.Acta<br><br>
1206, pp. 161-65 (1994); Y.L. Khmelnitsky et al.,<br>
J. Am. Chem. Soc, 116, pp. 2647-48 (1994)]. However,<br>
despite the widespread use of lyophilization for<br>
preparation of enzymes for catalysis in organic<br>
solvents, its impact is not fully understood and, in<br>
some instances, it may cause significant reversible<br>
denaturation of enzymes [Dabulis and Klibanov, supra].<br>
Other approaches to the problem of low enzyme<br>
activity in biotransformations involving organic<br>
solvents have included the use of surfactants. It has<br>
been reported that non-ionic surfactants added prior to<br>
immobilization of lipase into a photo-crosslinkable<br>
resin pre-polymer, or added to the reaction incubation<br>
mixture, increase enzyme activity [B. Nordvi and<br>
H. Holmsen, "Effect of Polyhydroxy Compounds on the<br>
activity of Lipase from Rhizopus arrhizus in Organic<br>
Solvent", in Biocatalysis in Non-Cpnventional Media,<br>
J. Tramper et al. (Ed.), pp. 355-61 (1992)].<br>
Immobilized lipase enzymes prepared by application of a<br>
non-ionic surfactant (containing at least one fatty<br>
acid moiety) to a hydrophobic support prior to or<br>
simultaneously with application of the lipase enzyme<br>
demonstrate activity in enzymatic conversion processes<br>
comparable with conventional immobilized enzymes [PCT<br>
patent application WO 94/28118].<br>
Surfactants have been said to reduce<br>
enzymatic activity of lipases [S. Bornemann et al.,<br>
"The Effects of Surfactants on Lipase-Catalysed<br>
Hydrolysis of Esters: Activities and Stereo<br>
Selectivity", Biocatalysis, 11, pp. 191-221 (1994)].<br>
Nevertheless, surfactants have been mixed with an<br>
aqueous solution of an enzyme, the mixture dewatered<br>
and the resulting enzyme preparation used as a catalyst<br><br>
said to have enhanced activity in organic solvents [PCT<br>
patent application WO 95/17504]. Surfactants or lipids<br>
have also been used to coat enzymes in order to<br>
solubilize them in organic solvents and, thus,<br>
increase chemical reaction rates [M. Goto et al.,<br>
"Design of Surfactants Suitable for Surfactant-Coated<br>
Enzymes as Catalysts in Organic Media", J. Chem. Eng.<br>
Jpn., 26, pp. 109-11 (1993); N. Kamiya et al.,<br>
"Surfactant-Coated Lipase Suitable for the Enzymatic<br>
Resolution of Methanol as a Biocatalyst in Organic<br>
Media", Biotechnol. Proa., 11, pp. 270-75 (1995)].<br>
After this procedure, the enzymes become soluble in<br>
organic solvents. Enzyme complexes soluble in organics<br>
are also described in V.M. Paradkar and J.S. Dordick,<br>
J. Am. Chem. Soc. 116, pp. 5009-10 (1994) (proteases)<br>
and Y. Okahata et al., J. Org. Chem., 60, pp. 2240-50<br>
(1995)(lipases).<br>
The advent of crosslinked enzyme crystal<br>
("CLEC™") technology provided a unique approach to<br>
solving the above-described disadvantages [N.L. St.<br>
Clair and M.A. Navia, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 114, pp. 7314-<br>
16 (1992)]. Crosslinked enzyme crystals retain their<br>
activity in environments that are normally incompatible<br>
with enzyme (soluble or immobilized) function. Such<br>
environments include prolonged exposure to high<br>
temperature and extreme pH. Additionally, in organic<br>
solvents and aqueous-organic solvent mixtures,<br>
crosslinked enzyme crystals exhibit both stability and<br>
activity far beyond that of their soluble or<br>
conventionally-immobilized counterparts. Since so many<br>
biocatalysis processes depend on stability and activity<br>
of an enzyme under sub-optimal conditions, crosslinked<br>
enzyme crystals are advantageously used in industrial,<br><br>
clinical and research settings enzymes. Thus,<br>
crosslinked enzyme crystals represent an important<br>
advance in the area of biocatalysis, as attractive and<br>
broadly applicable catalysts for organic synthesis<br>
reactions [R.A. Persichetti et al., "Cross-Linked<br>
Enzyme Crystals (CLECs) of Thermolysin in the Synthesis<br>
of Peptides", J. Am. Chem. Soc. 117, pp. 2732-37<br>
(1995) and J.J. Lalonde et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc.,<br>
1117, pp. 6845-52 (1995)].<br>
Despite the progress of protein catalysis<br>
technology in general, the need still exists for<br>
catalysts which have high activity in organic solvents.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides crosslinked<br>
protein crystal formulations which exhibit high<br>
activity and productivity as catalysts in chemical<br>
reactions involving organic solvents or aqueous-<br>
organic solvent mixtures. Advantageously, this level<br>
of activity and productivity is greater than that of<br>
soluble or conventionally-immobilized proteins. This<br>
invention also provides methods for producing<br>
crosslinked protein crystal formulations and methods<br>
using them to optimize chemical reactions in organic<br>
solvents, including those used in industrial scale<br>
biocatalysis.<br>
According to one embodiment of this<br>
invention, crosslinked protein crystal formulations are<br>
produced by drying crosslinked protein crystals in the<br>
presence of a surfactant and an organic solvent. In a<br>
second embodiment of this invention, crosslinked<br>
protein crystal formulations are produced by<br><br>
lyophilizing crosslinked protein crystals in the<br>
presence of a surfactant and an organic solvent.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order that the invention herein described<br>
may be more fully understood, the following detailed<br>
description is set forth. In the description, the<br>
following terms are employed:<br>
Organic Solvent — any solvent of non-aqueous<br>
origin.<br>
Aqueous-Organic Solvent Mixture — a mixture<br>
comprising n% organic solvent, where n is between 1<br>
and 99 and m% aqueous, where m is 100 - n.<br>
Mixture Of Organic Solvents — a combination<br>
of at least two different organic solvents in any<br>
proportion.<br>
Crosslinked Protein Crystal Formulation — a<br>
mixture of crosslinked protein crystals with one or<br>
more additional excipients, such as surfactants, salts,<br>
buffers, carbohydrates or polymers, in a dried, free-<br>
flowing powder or lyophilized form, rather than a<br>
slurry.<br>
Catalytically Effective Amount — an amount<br>
of a crosslinked protein crystal formulation of this<br>
invention which is effective to protect, repair, or<br>
detoxify the area to which it is applied over some<br>
period of time.<br>
Reactive Topical Composition — a composition<br>
which is effective to protect, repair or detoxify the<br>
area to which it is applied over some period of time.<br>
The crosslinked protein crystal formulations<br>
of this invention are particularly advantageous because<br><br>
they retain high activity in harsh solvent environments<br>
that are typical of many industrial-scale chemical<br>
synthesis procedures. As a result of their crystalline<br>
nature, the crosslinked protein crystal components of<br>
these formulations achieve uniformity across the entire<br>
crosslinked crystal volume. This uniformity is<br>
maintained by the intermolecular contacts and chemical<br>
crosslinks between the protein molecules constituting<br>
the crystal lattice, even when exchanged in organic or<br>
mixed aqueous-organic solvents. Even in such solvents,<br>
the protein molecules maintain a uniform distance from<br>
each other, forming well-defined stable pores within<br>
the crosslinked protein crystal formulations that<br>
facilitate access of substrate to the catalyst, as well<br>
as removal of product. In these crosslinked protein<br>
crystals, the lattice interactions, when fixed by<br>
chemical crosslinks, are particularly important in<br>
preventing denaturation, especially in organic solvents<br>
or mixed aqueous-organic solvents. Crosslinked protein<br>
crystals and the constituent proteins within the<br>
crystal lattice remain monodisperse in organic<br>
solvents, thus avoiding the problem of aggregation.<br>
These features of the crosslinked protein crystal<br>
components of crosslinked protein crystal formulations<br>
of this invention contribute to the high level of<br>
activity of those formulations in organic and aqueous-<br>
organic solvents.<br>
In addition to their activity in organic<br>
solvents and aqueous-organic solvents, crosslinked<br>
protein crystal formulations according to this<br>
invention are particularly resistant to proteolysis,<br>
extremes of temperature and extremes of PH. The<br>
activity per crosslinked protein crystal unit volume is<br><br>
significantly higher than that of conventionally<br>
immobilized proteins or concentrated soluble proteins.<br>
This is because protein concentrations within the<br>
crosslinked protein crystal components of the<br>
formulations are close to theoretical limits.<br>
By virtue of these advantages, the<br>
crosslinked protein crystal formulations of the present<br>
invention permit a major improvement in reaction<br>
efficiency. They provide improved yields under harsh<br>
conditions or situations requiring high throughput,<br>
enabling process chemists to concentrate on maximizing<br>
yield with less concern about reaction conditions.<br>
The protein constituent of the crosslinked<br>
protein crystal formulations of this invention may be<br>
any protein including, for example, an enzyme or an<br>
antibody.<br>
According to one embodiment of this<br>
invention, crosslinked protein crystal formulations are<br>
characterized by activity in either an organic solvent<br>
or an aqueous-organic solvent mixture which is at least<br>
about 1.7 times greater than the activity of the<br>
equivalent amount of said protein in either crude form<br>
or pure form. In an alternate embodiment of this<br>
invention, the activity level of such formulations<br>
ranges between about 1.7 times and about 90 times<br>
greater than the activity of the equivalent amount of<br>
said protein in either crude form or pure form.<br>
This invention also includes crosslinked<br>
protein crystal formulations characterized by a<br>
specific activity per milligram of solid in an organic<br>
solvent or an aqueous-organic solvent mixture which is<br>
at least about 4.3 times greater than that of said<br>
protein in either crude form or pure form. Crosslinked<br><br>
protein crystal formulations according to this<br>
invention may also be characterized by a specific<br>
activity per milligram of solid in an organic solvent<br>
or an aqueous-organic solvent mixture which is between<br>
about 4 times and about 442 times greater than that<br>
said protein in either crude form or pure form. And<br>
crosslinked protein crystal formulations of this<br>
invention may also be characterized by a specific<br>
activity per milligram of solid in an organic solvent<br>
or an aqueous-organic solvent mixture which has a level<br>
of activity greater than that of said protein in either<br>
crude form or pure form that is selected from the group<br>
consisting of at least about 50 times greater, at least<br>
about 100 times greater, at least about 200 times<br>
greater and at least about 300 times greater activity.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention,<br>
crosslinked protein crystal formulations are<br>
characterized by activity in an organic solvent or an<br>
aqueous-organic solvent mixture which is at least 19<br>
times greater than the activity of crosslinked protein<br>
crystals containing no surfactant. Crosslinked protein<br>
crystal formulations may also be characterized by<br>
activity in an organic solvent or an aqueous-organic<br>
solvent mixture which is between about 19 times and<br>
about 100 times greater than the activity of<br>
crosslinked protein crystals containing no surfactant.<br>
In all of the crosslinked protein<br>
formulations described above, the stated activity<br>
levels may be exhibited in either organic solvents, or<br>
aqueous-organic solvents, or in both solvents. Such<br>
activity levels characterize all types of crosslinked<br>
protein crystal formulations, including crosslinked<br>
enzyme crystal formulations.<br><br>
The crosslinked protein crystal formulations<br>
of this invention may be used in any of a number of<br>
chemical processes. Such processes include industrial<br>
and research-scale processes, such as organic synthesis<br>
of specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals, synthesis<br>
of intermediates for the production of such products,<br>
chiral synthesis and resolution for optically pure<br>
pharmaceutical and specialty chemicals. Enzymatic<br>
conversion processes include oxidations, reductions,<br>
additions, hydrolyses, eliminations, rearrangements,<br>
esterifications and asymmetric conversions, including<br>
steroselective, stereospecific and regioselective<br>
reactions. Products which may be produced using these<br>
reactions include chiral organic molecules, peptides,<br>
carbohydrates, lipids and other chemical species.<br>
In carrying out any of the above-enumerated<br>
reactions, it will be understood by those of skill in<br>
the art that the organic solvent or aqueous-organic<br>
solvent chosen for the particular reaction should be<br>
one which is compatible with the protein constituent of<br>
the crosslinked protein crystal, as well as the<br>
surfactant used to stabilize the crosslinked protein<br>
crystal. Organic solvents may be selected from the<br>
group consisting of diols, polyols, polyethers, water<br>
soluble polymers and mixtures thereof. Examples of<br>
organic solvents include toluene, octane,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, acetone, and pyridine. Further<br>
examples include hydrophobic or polar organic solvents<br>
such as, water miscible or water imiscible solvents,<br>
diethylene glycol, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol,<br>
poly(ethylene glycol), triethylene glycol, 1,4-<br>
butanediol, 1,2-butanediol, 2,3,-dimethyl-2,3-<br>
butanediol, 1,2-butanediol, dimethyl tartrate,<br><br>
monoalkyl ethers of poly(ethylene glycol), dialkyl<br>
ethers of poly(ethylene glycol), and<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, or mixtures thereof.<br>
According to one embodiment, this invention<br>
includes methods for producing a selected product in an<br>
organic solvent or an aqueous-organic solvent mixture<br>
by combining at least one substrate and at least one<br>
protein which acts upon the substrate in the presence<br>
of an organic solvent or an aqueous-organic solvent<br>
mixture — said protein being a crosslinked protein<br>
crystal formulation — and maintaining the combination<br>
under conditions which permit said protein to act upon<br>
the substrate, thereby producing the selected product.<br>
Products which may be produced in such methods include,<br>
for example, chiral organic molecules, peptides,<br>
carbohydrates and lipids.<br>
Crosslinked protein crystal formulations<br>
according to this invention may also be used in methods<br>
for purifying or separating a substance or molecule of<br>
interest from a sample, by virtue of the ability of the<br>
formulation to bind to the substance or molecule of<br>
interest. Such separation methods comprise the steps<br>
of contacting the crosslinked crystal formulations with<br>
the substance or molecule of interest by any means,<br>
under conditions which permit said protein to bind with<br>
said substance of molecule of interest in said sample<br>
to form a complex and separating said complex from said<br>
sample. In such methods, the crosslinked protein<br>
crystal formulations may be linked to a solid support,<br>
packed into a column or layered onto beads.<br>
According to one embodiment of this<br>
invention, crosslinked protein crystal formulations may<br>
be used as a component of a biosensor for detecting an<br><br>
analyte of interest in a sample, for example, a fluid.<br>
Such a biosensor comprises (a) a crosslinked protein<br>
crystal formulation, wherein said protein has the<br>
activity of acting on the analyte of interest or on a<br>
reactant in a reaction in which the analyte of interest<br>
participates; (b) a retaining means for said<br>
crosslinked protein crystal formulation, said retaining<br>
means comprising a material which allows contact<br>
between said crosslinked protein crystal formulation<br>
and a sample, said sample containing either (1) the<br>
analyte upon which the protein acts or (2) a reactant<br>
in a reaction in which the analyte participates; and,<br>
optionally,(c) a signal transducer which produces a<br>
signal in the presence or absence of the analyte. The<br>
means for detecting the activity of the protein on the<br>
analyte or reactant may be selected from the group<br>
consisting of pH electrodes, light sensing devices,<br>
heat sensing devices and means for detecting electrical<br>
charges. The signal transducer may be selected from<br>
the group consisting of optical transducers, electrical<br>
transducers, electromagnetic transducers and chemical<br>
transducers.<br>
In an alternate embodiment of this invention,<br>
crosslinked protein crystal formulations may be used in<br>
extracorporeal devices for altering a component of a<br>
sample, or for selective degradation or removal of a<br>
component of a sample, such as a fluid sample. Such<br>
extracorporeal devices comprise (a) a crosslinked<br>
protein crystal formulation, wherein the protein has<br>
the activity of acting on the component or a reactant<br>
in a reaction in which the component participates and<br>
(b) a retaining means for said crosslinked protein<br>
crystal formulation, said retaining means comprising a<br><br>
material which allows contact between said crosslinked<br>
protein crystal formulation and a sample, said sample<br>
containing either (1) the component upon which said<br>
protein acts or (2) a reactant in a reaction in which<br>
the component participates. In such extracorporeal<br>
devices, the retaining means may comprise a porous<br>
material on which said crosslinked protein crystal<br>
formulation is retained or a tube in which said<br>
crosslinked protein crystal formulation is present.<br>
Thus, crosslinked protein crystal<br>
formulations according to this invention may be<br>
advantageously used instead of conventional soluble or<br>
immobilized proteins in biosensors and extracorporeal<br>
devices. Such uses of the crosslinked protein crystal<br>
formulations of this invention provides biosensors and<br>
extracorporeal devices characterized by higher degrees<br>
of sensitivity, volumeric productivity and throughput<br>
than those of biosensors and extracorporeal devices<br>
based on conventional soluble or immobilized proteins.<br>
Alternatively, crosslinked protein crystal<br>
formulations according to this invention may be used in<br>
chromatographic techniques. Such techniques include<br>
size exclusion chromatography, affinity chromatography<br>
and chiral chromatography. Chromatography of a sample<br>
may be carried out in the presence of an organic<br>
solvent or an aqueous-organic solvent mixture by<br>
contacting said sample with a crosslinked protein<br>
crystal formulation under conditions which permit the<br>
components of said sample to bind with said protein to<br>
form a complex and collecting said components as<br>
separate fractions. The crosslinked protein crystal<br>
formulation may be contained in a packed chromatography<br>
column.<br><br>
According to another embodiment of this<br>
invention, crosslinked crystal protein formulations may<br>
be used in gas phase reactors, such as catalytic<br>
convertors for gas phase reactions. For example, gas<br>
may be passed through a column packed with a<br>
crosslinked protein formulation — which degrades the<br>
gas.<br>
Crosslinked protein crystal formulations<br>
according to this invention may also be used in various<br>
environmental applications. They may be used in place<br>
of conventional soluble or immobilized proteins for<br>
environmental purposes, such as cleaning-up oil slicks.<br>
For example, one or more organic solvents may be added<br>
to the oil slick, followed by a crosslinked protein<br>
crystal formulation.<br>
Crosslinked protein crystal formulations<br>
according to the present invention may also be used for<br>
air purification in conjunction with air filtration.<br>
For example, air may be passed through a column packed<br>
with a crosslinked protein formulation to degrade and<br>
filter out any unwanted contaminants.<br>
This invention also includes methods for<br>
increasing the activity of crosslinked protein crystals<br>
in an organic solvent or an aqueous-organic solvent<br>
mixture comprising the steps of combining the<br>
crosslinked protein crystals with a surfactant to<br>
produce a combination and drying the combination of<br>
crosslinked protein crystals and surfactant in the<br>
presence of an organic solvent to form a crosslinked<br>
protein crystal formulation.<br>
Alternatively, crosslinked protein crystal<br>
formulations according to this invention may be used as<br>
ingredients in topical creams and lotions, for skin<br><br>
protection or detoxification. They may also be used as<br>
anti-oxidants in cosmetics.<br>
According to this invention, any individual,<br>
including humans and other mammals, may be treated in a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable manner with a catalytically<br>
effective amount of a crosslinked protein crystal<br>
formulation for a period of time sufficient to protect,<br>
repair or detoxify the area to which it is applied.<br>
For example, crosslinked protein crystal formulations<br>
may be topically administered to any epithelial<br>
surface. Such epithelial surfaces include oral,<br>
ocular, aural, nasal surfaces.<br>
The crosslinked protein crystal formulations<br>
may be in a variety of conventional depot forms<br>
employed for topical administration to provide reactive<br>
topical compositions. These include, for example,<br>
semi-solid and liquid dosage forms, such as liquid<br>
solutions or suspensions, gels, creams, emulsions,<br>
lotions, slurries, powders, sprays, foams, pastes,<br>
ointments, salves, balms and drops. Compositions<br>
comprising crosslinked protein crystal formulations may<br>
also comprise any conventional pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier or adjuvant. These carriers and<br>
adjuvants include, for example, ion exchangers,<br>
alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, buffer<br>
substances, such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid,<br>
potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of<br>
saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or<br>
electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium<br>
hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts,<br>
colloidal silica, magnesium, trisilicate, cellulose-<br>
based substances and polyethylene glycol. Adjuvants<br>
for topical or gel base forms may include, for example,<br><br>
sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylates,<br>
polyoxyethylele-polyoxypropylene-block polymers,<br>
polyethylene glycol and wood wax alcohols.<br>
Alternatively, crosslinked protein crystal<br>
formulations may be formulated into a health care<br>
device selected from the group consisting of dressings,<br>
sponges, strips, plasters, bandages, patches or gloves.<br>
The most effective mode of administration and<br>
dosage regimen will depend upon the effect desired,<br>
previous therapy, if any, the individual's health<br>
status and response to the crosslinked protein crystal<br>
formulation and the judgment of the treating physician.<br>
The crosslinked protein crystal formulation may be<br>
administered in any pharmaceutically acceptable topical<br>
dosage form, at one time or over a series of<br>
treatments.<br>
The amount of the crosslinked protein crystal<br>
formulation that may be combined with carrier materials<br>
to produce a single dosage form will vary depending<br>
upon the particular mode of topical administration,<br>
formulation, dose level or dose frequency. A typical<br>
preparation will contain between about 0.1% and about<br>
99%, preferably between about 1% and about 10%,<br>
crosslinked protein crystal formulation (w/w).<br>
Upon improvement of the individual's<br>
condition, a maintenance dose of crosslinked protein<br>
crystal formulation may be administered, if necessary.<br>
Subsequently, the dosage or frequency of<br>
administration, or both, may be reduced as a function<br>
of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved<br>
condition is retained. When the symptoms have been<br>
alleviated to the desired level, treatment should<br>
cease. Individuals may, however, require intermittent<br><br>
treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of<br>
symptoms.<br>
According to the present invention,<br>
preparation of crosslinked protein crystal formulations<br>
includes the steps of crystallizing and crosslinking<br>
the protein, which may be carried out as described in<br>
PCT patent application WO92/02617, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively,<br>
crosslinked protein crystal formulations may be<br>
prepared as illustrated below for crosslinked enzyme<br>
crystal formulations.<br>
Preparation of Crosslinked Enzyme Crystal<br>
Formulations - Enzyme Crystallization<br>
Enzyme crystals are grown by the controlled<br>
precipitation of enzyme out of aqueous solution or<br>
aqueous solution-containing organic solvents.<br>
Conditions to be controlled include, for example, the<br>
rate of evaporation of solvent, the presence of<br>
appropriate co-solutes and buffers, pH and temperature.<br>
A comprehensive review of the various factors affecting<br>
the crystallization of proteins has been published by<br>
McPherson, Methods Enzvmol.. 114, pp. 112-20 (1985).<br>
McPherspn and Gilliland, J. Crystal Growth,<br>
90, pp. 51-59 (1988) have compiled comprehensive lists<br>
of proteins and nucleic acids that have been<br>
crystallized, as well as the conditions under which<br>
they were crystallized. A compendium of crystals and<br>
crystallization recipes, as well as a repository of<br>
coordinates of solved protein and nucleic acid crystal<br>
structures, is maintained by the Protein Data Bank at<br>
the Brookhaven National Laboratory [Bernstein et al.,<br>
J. Mol Biol,,,, 112, pp. 535-42 (1977)]. These<br><br>
references can be used to determine the conditions<br>
necessary for crystallization of an enzyme previously<br>
crystallized, as a prelude to the formation of an<br>
appropriate crosslinked enzyme crystal, and can guide<br>
the crystallization strategy for other enzymes.<br>
Alternatively, an intelligent trial and error search<br>
strategy can, in most instances, produce suitable<br>
crystallization conditions for many enzymes, provided<br>
that an acceptable level of purity can been achieved<br>
for them [see e.g., C.W. Carter, Jr. and C.W. Carter,<br>
J. Biol. Chem., 254, pp. 12219-23 (1979)].<br>
Enzymes which may be crystallized to form the<br>
crosslinked enzyme crystal component of the<br>
formulations according to this invention include<br>
hydrolases, isomerases, lyases, ligases, transferases<br>
and oxidoreductases. Examples of hydrolases include<br>
thermolysin, elastase, esterase, lipase, nitrilase,<br>
hydantoinase, asparaginase, urease, subtilisin and<br>
other proteases and lysozyme. Examples of lyases<br>
include aldolases and hydroxynitril lyase. Examples of<br>
oxidoreductases include glucose oxidase, alcohol<br>
dehydrogenase and other dehydrogenases.<br>
For use in crosslinked enzyme crystal<br>
formulations according to this invention, the large<br>
single crystals which are needed for X-ray diffraction<br>
analysis are not required. Microcrystalline showers<br>
are suitable.<br>
In general, crystals are produced by<br>
combining the enzyme to be crystallized with an<br>
appropriate aqueous solvent or aqueous solvent<br>
containing appropriate precipitating agents, such as<br>
salts or organics. The solvent is combined with the<br>
protein at a temperature determined experimentally to<br><br>
be appropriate for the induction of crystallization and<br>
acceptable for the maintenance of enzyme activity and<br>
stability. The solvent can optionally include co-<br>
solutes, such as divalent cations, co-factors or<br>
chaotropes, as well as buffer species to control pH.<br>
The need for co-solutes and their concentrations are<br>
determined experimentally to facilitate<br>
crystallization. In an industrial scale process, the<br>
controlled precipitation leading to crystallization can<br>
best be carried out by the simple combination of<br>
protein, precipitant, co-solutes and, optionally,<br>
buffers in a batch process. Alternative laboratory<br>
crystallization methods, such as dialysis or vapor<br>
diffusion can also be adapted. McPherson, supra, and<br>
Gilliland, supra, include a comprehensive list of<br>
suitable conditions in their reviews of the<br>
crystallization literature. Occasionally,<br>
incompatibility between the crosslinking reagent and<br>
the crystallization medium might require exchanging the<br>
crystals into a more suitable solvent system.<br>
Many of the enzymes for which crystallization<br>
conditions have already been described, have<br>
considerable potential as practical catalysts in<br>
industrial and laboratory chemical processes and may be<br>
used to prepare crosslinked enzyme crystal formulations<br>
according to this invention. It should be noted,<br>
however, that the conditions reported in most of the<br>
above-cited references have been optimized to yield, in<br>
most instances, a few large, diffraction quality<br>
crystals. Accordingly, it will be appreciated by those<br>
of skill in the art that some degree of adjustment of<br>
these conditions to provide a high yielding process for<br><br>
the large scale production of the smaller crystals used<br>
in making crosslinked enzyme crystals may be necessary.<br>
Preparation of Crosslinked Enzyme Crystal<br>
Formulations - Crosslinkincr of Enzyme Crystals<br>
Once enzyme crystals have been grown in a<br>
suitable medium they can be crosslinked. Crosslinking<br>
results in stabilization of the crystal lattice by<br>
introducing covalent links between the constituent<br>
enzyme molecules of the crystal. This makes possible<br>
the transfer of enzyme into an alternate reaction<br>
environment that might otherwise be incompatible with<br>
the existence of the crystal lattice or even with the<br>
existence of intact protein. Crosslinking can be<br>
achieved by a wide variety of multifunctional reagents,<br>
including bifunctional reagents. According to a<br>
preferred embodiment of this invention, the<br>
crosslinking agent is glutaraldehyde. For a<br>
representative listing of other available crosslinking<br>
reagents see, for example, the 1990 catalog of the<br>
Pierce Chemical Company.<br>
Crosslinking with glutaraldehyde forms strong<br>
covalent bonds primarily between lysine amino acid<br>
residues within and between the enzyme molecules in the<br>
crystal lattice. The crosslinking interactions prevent<br>
the constituent enzyme molecules in the crystal from<br>
going back into solution, effectively insolubilizing or<br>
immobilizing the enzyme molecules into microcrystalline<br>
particles (preferably having lengths which are, on<br>
average, less than or equal to l0-1 mm).<br><br>
Preparation of Crosslinked Enzyme<br>
Crystal Formulations - Exposure of<br>
Crosslinked Enzyme Crystals to Surfactants<br>
Crosslinked enzyme crystals prepared as<br>
described above, may be used to prepare enzyme crystal<br>
formulations for reactions in organic solvents and<br>
aqueous-organic solvent mixtures by being contacted<br>
with a surfactant. After exposure of the crosslinked<br>
enzyme crystals to the surfactant and subsequent drying<br>
in the presence of an organic solvent, the resulting<br>
crosslinked enzyme crystal formulation is particularly<br>
active and stable in organic solvents and aqueous-<br>
organic solvent mixtures. The details described below<br>
with respect to crosslinked enzyme crystal formulations<br>
and their production are equally applicable to<br>
crosslinked protein crystal formulations.<br>
Surfactants useful to prepare crosslinked<br>
enzyme crystal formulations according to this invention<br>
include cationic, anionic, non-ionic or amphoteric, or<br>
mixtures thereof. The preferred surfactant will depend<br>
upon the particular enzyme component of the crosslinked<br>
enzyme crystals to be used to prepare the crosslinked<br>
enzyme crystal formulation. This may be determined by<br>
carrying out a routine screening procedure based on a<br>
reaction catalyzed by the particular enzyme. Such<br>
screening procedures are well known to those of skill<br>
in the art. Illustrative screening processes are set<br>
forth in Examples 6-8.<br>
Examples of useful cationic surfactants<br>
include amines, amine salts, sulfonium, phosphonium and<br>
quarternary ammonium compounds. Specific examples of<br>
such cationic surfactants include:<br><br><br><br><br>
Generally, in order to prepare crosslinked<br>
enzyme crystal formulations/ the surfactant should be<br>
added to a crosslinked enzyme crystal-containing<br>
solution in an amount sufficient to allow the<br>
surfactant to equilibrate with and/or penetrate the<br>
crosslinked enzyme crystals. Such an amount is one<br>
which provides a weight ratio of crosslinked enzyme<br>
crystals to surfactant between about 1:1 and about 1:5,<br>
preferably between about 1:1 and about 1:2. The<br>
crosslinked enzyme crystals are contacted with<br>
surfactant for a period of time between about 5 minutes<br>
and about 24 hours, preferably between about 30 minutes<br>
and about 24 hours. Following that contact, the<br><br>
crosslinked enzyme crystal/surfactant combination may<br>
be dried in the presence of an organic solvent to form<br>
the crosslinked enzyme crystal formulation.<br>
The choice of organic solvent and length of<br>
drying time will depend on the particular crosslinked<br>
enzyme crystals and the particular surfactant used to<br>
produce the crosslinked enzyme crystal formulations.<br>
Nevertheless, the solvent and drying time should be<br>
those which provide a crosslinked enzyme crystal<br>
formulation characterized by a water content that<br>
permits the formulation to have maximum activity and<br>
stability in organic solvents or aqueous-organic<br>
solvent mixtures. According to one embodiment of this<br>
invention, the drying time may be between about 5<br>
minutes and about 24 hours, preferably between about 30<br>
minutes and about 24 hours. The organic solvent used<br>
in the drying step may be present in an amount between<br>
about 10 wt% and about 90 wt% of the total mixture,<br>
preferably between about 40 wt% and about 80 wt% of the<br>
total mixture.<br>
Alternatively, the crosslinked enzyme<br>
crystal/surfactant combination may be lyophilized in<br>
the presence of an organic solvent. Lyophilization may<br>
be carried out for a period of time between about 30<br>
minutes and about 18 hours.<br>
The resulting crosslinked enzyme crystal<br>
formulation should contain between about 10 wt% and<br>
about 70 wt% of surfactant, by weight of the final<br>
formulation, preferably between about 25 wt% and about<br>
45 wt% of surfactant, by weight of the final<br>
formulation.<br>
In order that this invention may be better<br>
understood, the following examples are set forth.<br><br>
These examples are for the purpose of illustration only<br>
and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of<br>
the invention in any matter.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1 - Preparation of A<br>
Crosslinked LPS Crystal Formulation<br>
A slurry of 15 kg crude Pseudomonas cepacia<br>
lipase (PS 30 lipase - Amano) ("LPS") was dissolved in<br>
100 L distilled deionized water and the volume brought<br>
to 200 L with additional distilled deionized water.<br>
The suspension was mixed in an Air Drive Lightning<br>
mixer for 2 hours at room temperature and then filtered<br>
through a 0.5 u filter to remove celite. The mixture<br>
was then ultrafiltered and concentrated to 10 L (121.4<br>
g) using a 3K hollow fiber filter membrane cartridge.<br>
Solid calcium acetate was added to a concentration of<br>
20 mM Ca(CH3COO)2. The pH was adjusted to 5.5 with<br>
concentrated acetic acid, as necessary. The mixture<br>
was heated to and maintained at a temperature of 30°C.<br>
Magnesium sulfate was added to a 0.2 M concentration<br>
followed by glucopon to a 1% concentration.<br>
Isopropanol was then added to a final concentration of<br>
23%. The resulting solution was mixed for 30 minutes<br>
at 30°C, then cooled from 30°C to 12°C over a 2 hour<br>
period. Crystallization was then allowed to proceed<br>
for 16 hours.<br>
The crystals were allowed to settle and<br>
soluble protein was removed using a peristaltic pump<br>
with tygon tubing having a 10 ml pipette at its end.<br>
Fresh crystallization solution (23% isopropyl alcohol,<br>
0.2 M MgS04, 1% glucopon, 20 mM Ca(CH3COO)2, pH 5.5) was<br><br>
added to bring the concentration of protein to 30 mg/ml<br>
(O.D. 280 of a 1 mg/ml solution =1.0, measured using a<br>
spectrophotometer at wavelength 280). The crystal<br>
yield was about 120 grams. The crystal solution was<br>
then crosslinked as follows.<br>
A 2 liter aliquot of crosslinking agent was<br>
prepared by mixing 1 volume of 50% glutaraldehyde with<br>
4 volumes of 0.1 M Tris (pH 9.25). Crosslinking was<br>
then carried out using 13.5 ml crosslinking agent per<br>
gram of enzyme. More particularly, a 0.4 ml aliquot of<br>
the crosslinking agent was then added to 1 ml of enzyme<br>
slurry (30 mg/ml), over a total addition time of 2<br>
hours. The mixture was allowed to stand for 8 hours at<br>
room temperature for crosslinking. The crosslinking<br>
reaction was stopped by washing the crosslinked<br>
crystals extensively in a filter press with an<br>
approximately 1.5 crystal slurry volume of buffer (10<br>
mM Tris, 10 mM CaCl2, pH 7.0).<br>
A 30 gram aliquot of the above-prepared<br>
crosslinked LPS enzyme crystals was suspended in 340 ml<br>
storage buffer (10 mM Tris, 10 mM CaCl2, pH 7.0) and the<br>
mixture poured into a sintered glass funnel (porosity<br>
-10-20 u) at room temperature. The enzyme crystals<br>
were exposed to the surfactant EDT-20; PEG-10 tallow<br>
aminopropylamine as described below. This surfactant<br>
was selected by the screening process set forth in<br>
Example 6, infra.<br>
The buffer above the crosslinked LPS crystals<br>
was filtered in a sintered glass funnel (described<br>
above), keeping the enzyme crystals wet throughout the<br>
process. The height of the crosslinked enzyme crystals<br>
in the funnel was measured and found to be 60 ml. The<br>
surfactant N, N', N-polyoxyethylene (10)-N-tallow-1,3 -<br><br>
diaminopropane (EDT-20', PEG-10 tallow) was added<br>
together with the solvent 2-butanone, such that the<br>
ratio of surfactant:crosslinked enzyme crystals was 1:1<br>
(30 g surfactant:30 g LPS = 30 ml). This was done by<br>
pouring a mixture of 30 ml 2-butanone and 30 ml<br>
surfactant, for a total of 60 ml, on top of the<br>
crosslinked enzyme crystals. A gentle suction was<br>
applied to ensure that the crosslinked enzyme crystals<br>
were coated with the surfactant and so that the enzyme<br>
cake did not dry. After 30 minutes at room<br>
temperature, the mixture was then transferred to a<br>
drying vessel (a fritted pressure filter funnel) in a<br>
stream of air to a water content of about 1-3%, as<br>
determined by Karl Fisher titration.<br>
LPS crosslinked crystal formulations<br>
according to this invention may also be prepared using<br>
crosslinked LPS crystals sold under the trade name<br>
ChiroCLEC-PC, which are available from Altus Biologies,<br>
Inc. (Cambridge, Massachusetts).<br>
Example 2 - Preparation of A<br>
Crosslinked CRL Crystal Formulation<br>
A 5 kg aliquot of Candida rugosa lipase<br>
("CRL") in powder form (Amano) was mixed with 5 kg<br>
celite and dissolved in 102 L distilled deionized water<br>
and the volume brought to 200 L with distilled<br>
deionized water. The suspension was mixed in an Air<br>
Drive Lightning mixer for 2 hours at room temperature<br>
and then filtered through a 0.5 micron filter to remove<br>
celite. The mixture was then ultrafiltered and<br>
concentrated to 14 L (469 g) using a 3K hollow fiber<br>
filter membrane cartridge. Solid calcium acetate was<br><br>
added to a concentration of 5 mM Ca(CH3COO)2. The pH<br>
was adjusted to 4.8 with concentrated acetic acid, as<br>
necessary. The mixture was heated to and maintained at<br>
a temperature of 25°C. A 3.5 L aliquot of (100%) 2-<br>
methyl-2,4-pentanediol "MPD" and crystal seeds (0.5 g<br>
protein) were added. The resulting solution was mixed<br>
overnight. Crystallization was then allowed to proceed<br>
overnight, for about 17-20 hours.<br>
The crystals were allowed to settle and<br>
soluble protein was removed using a peristalic pump<br>
with tygon tubing having a 10 ml pipette at its end.<br>
Fresh crystallization solution (20% MPD, 5 mM<br>
Ca(CH3COO) 2/ PH 4.8) was added to bring the<br>
concentration of protein to 35 mg/ml (O.D. 280 of a 1<br>
mg/ml solution = 1.0). This step was then repeated.<br>
The crystal yield was about 217 grams. The crystal<br>
solution was then crosslinked as follows.<br>
Crosslinking agent was prepared by mixing 1<br>
volume of 50% glutaraldehyde with 1 volume of 0.3 M<br>
sodium borate buffer (pH 9.0) and heating the mixture<br>
for 1 hour at 60°C. The mixture was then allowed to<br>
stand until it cooled to room temperature, with the pH<br>
being adjusted to 6.0, as necessary, using HC1.<br>
Crosslinking was carried out using 3.885 ml (1.949 g)<br>
of crosslinking agent, per gram of enzyme. More<br>
particularly, a 1686 ml aliquot of the crosslinking<br>
agent was then added to 217 g of enzyme slurry by '<br>
pumping the crosslinking agent slowly, for a total<br>
addition time of 2 hours. The mixture was then let<br>
stand at room temperature for an additional 16 hours<br>
for crosslinking. The crosslinking reaction was<br>
stopped by washing the crosslinked crystals extensively<br>
in a Buchner funnel with a 1 u filter, first with 30 L<br><br>
water then with 2 M sodium chloride and buffer (10 mM<br>
Tris, 10 mM CaCl2, pH 7.0).<br>
A 6 gram aliquot of the above-prepared<br>
crosslinked CRL enzyme crystals was suspended in 100 ml<br>
storage buffer (10 mM Tris, 10 mM CaCl2, pH 7.0) and the<br>
mixture poured into a sintered glass funnel (porosity<br>
-10-20 u) at room temperature. The buffer was then<br>
removed from the enzyme. The enzyme crystals were<br>
exposed to the surfactant tergitol type TMN-6 as<br>
described below. This surfactant was selected by the<br>
screening process set forth in Example 8, infra.<br>
The buffer above the crosslinked CRL crystals<br>
was filtered in a sintered glass funnel (as described<br>
above), keeping the crosslinked enzyme crystals wet<br>
throughout the process. The height of the crosslinked<br>
enzyme crystals in the funnel was measured and found to<br>
be 34 ml. The surfactant was added together with the<br>
solvent 2-butanone, such that the ratio of<br>
surfactant:crosslinked enzyme crystals was 1:1 (6 g<br>
CRL:6 g surfactant = 5.7 ml). This was done by pouring<br>
a mixture of 28.3 ml 2-butanone and 5.7 ml surfactant,<br>
for a total of 34 ml, on top of the crosslinked enzyme<br>
crystals. A gentle suction was applied to ensure that<br>
the crosslinked enzyme crystals were coated with the<br>
surfactant and so that the enzyme cake did not dry.<br>
After 30 minutes at room temperature, the mixture was<br>
then transferred to a drying vessel (a fritted pressure<br>
filter funnel) in a stream of air to a water content of<br>
about 7-13%, as determined by Karl Fisher titration.<br>
CRL crosslinked crystal formulations<br>
according to this invention may also be prepared using<br>
crosslinked CRL crystals sold under the trade name<br><br>
ChiroCLEC-CR, which are available from Altus Biologies,<br>
Inc. (Cambridge, Massachusetts).<br>
Example 3 - Preparation of A<br>
Crosslinked ABL Crystal Formulation<br>
A slurry of 30 kg or 25 L of Bacillus<br>
licheniformis subtilisin A ("ABL") (Alcalase) was mixed<br>
in an Air Drive Lightning mixer with 50 L of 15% Na2S04<br>
(pH 5.5). Crystal seeds (0.27 g protein) were added,<br>
and the mixture maintained at a temperature of 30°C.<br>
Crystallization was then allowed to proceed for a<br>
period of 3-4 days. The mother liquor was removed<br>
using a Buchner funnel with a 1 u filter.<br>
The crystals were washed with 50 L of 15%<br>
Na2S04 (pH 5.5) and then suspended in 40 L of 15% Na2S04<br>
(pH 5.5). The crystal yield was about 1069 grams. The<br>
crystal solution was then crosslinked as follows.<br>
Crosslinking was carried out using 1.68 ml of<br>
50% glutaraldehyde crosslinking agent per gram of<br>
enzyme. More particularly, a 1796 ml aliquot of<br>
crosslinking agent was added to 1069 g enzyme over a<br>
total addition time of 30 minutes to 1 hour. The<br>
mixture was allowed to mix for 4 hours at room<br>
temperature for crosslinking, keeping the pH at 5.5 at<br>
all times. The crosslinking reaction was stopped by<br>
washing the crosslinked crystals extensively in a<br>
filter press with water until the conductivity of<br>
washing was 2 ms/cm. Then the crosslinked enzyme<br>
crystals were suspended in buffer (0.1 NaAc, 20 mM<br>
CaCl2, pH 5.7) .<br>
A 20 gram aliquot of the above-prepared<br>
crosslinked ABL enzyme crystals was suspended in 100 ml<br><br>
storage buffer (0.1 NaAc, 20 mM CaCl2, pH 5.7) and the<br>
mixture poured into a sintered glass funnel (porosity<br>
-10-20 u) at room temperature. The enzyme crystals<br>
were exposed to the surfactant tergitol type 15-S-3 as<br>
described below. This surfactant was selected by the<br>
screening process set forth in Example 7, infra.<br>
The buffer above the crosslinked ABL crystals<br>
was filtered in a sintered glass funnel (as described<br>
above), keeping the crosslinked enzyme crystals wet<br>
throughout the process. The height of the crosslinked<br>
enzyme crystals in the funnel was measured and found to<br>
be 50 ml. The surfactant was added together with the<br>
solvent isopropanol, such that the ratio of<br>
surfactant:crosslinked enzyme crystals was 1:1.5 (30 g<br>
ABL:30 ml surfactant = 50 ml). This was done by<br>
pouring a mixture of 20 ml isopropanol and 30 ml<br>
surfactant, for a total of 50 ml, on top of the<br>
crosslinked enzyme crystals. A gentle suction was<br>
applied to ensure that the crosslinked enzyme crystals<br>
were coated with the surfactant and so that the enzyme<br>
cake did not dry. After 30 minutes at room<br>
temperature, the mixture was then transferred to a<br>
drying vessel (a fritted pressure filter funnel) in a<br>
stream of air to a water content of about 1-4%, as<br>
determined by Karl Fisher titration.<br>
Alternatively, 15 g of wet cake of ABL<br>
crosslinked enzyme crystals may be mixed with 20 g<br>
surfactant and 30 ml isopropanol. The mixture may then<br>
be incubated for 30 minutes. Subsequently, solvent and<br>
surfactant may be removed by suction, as described<br>
above. The wet crosslinked enzyme crystals may then be<br>
transferred to a lyophilization vessel and frozen in<br>
acetone in dry ice for 30 minutes. Then, the<br><br>
lyophilization vessel is transferred to the lyophilizer<br>
and let go for 30 minutes.<br>
Lyophilized crosslinked enzyme crystal<br>
formulations prepared as described above may be stored<br>
at room temperature or at 4°C, prior to their use in<br>
organic solvents. Lyophilized crosslinked enzyme<br>
crystal formulations may be stored at room temperature.<br>
ABL crosslinked crystal formulations<br>
according to this invention may also be prepared using<br>
crosslinked ABL crystals sold under the trade name<br>
ChiroCLEC-BL, which are available from Altus Biologies,<br>
Inc. (Cambridge, Massachusetts).<br>

A solution of (+/-} Menthol (449 mM) in 1 ml<br>
of toluene containing 7.5 µl (0.15%) H20 was stirred<br>
with 4 mg of the crosslinked CRL crystal formulation<br>
prepared in Example 2 for 5 minutes, until a fine<br>

hexane without acetic acid was substituted (at an even<br>
rate) for the acidified hexane. Helium flow rate =<br>

(532 mM) in 1 ml of toluene containing n-BuOH (1060 mM)<br>
was added 10 mg of the crosslinked CRL crystal<br>
formulation prepared in Example 2. The resulting<br>
mixture was magnetically stirred at 25°C for 1 hour, at<br>
which time capillary GC analysis indicated 46%<br>
conversion. The GC conditions were as follows: DB1701<br>

Retention times: 2.12 minutes [methyl ester], 6.46<br>
minutes [butyl ester]. The reaction was halted by<br>
suction filtration of the catalyst. Optical purity of<br>

[S-methyl ester], 44.30 minutes [R-butyl ester] and<br>
44.50 minutes [S-butyl ester].<br>
Resolution of Phenethyl Alcohol by Transesterification<br>
To 200 mM phenethyl alcohol and 200 mM vinyl<br>
acetate in 1 ml toluene was added 1.2 mg of the<br>
crosslinked LPS crystal formulation prepared in Example<br>
1 and the reaction mixture stirred at room temperature<br>
for 30 minutes. The catalyst was removed by<br>
centrifugation to stop the reaction. Conversion and<br>
optical purity were determined by chiral GC.<br>
The chiral GC conditions were as follows:<br>
Cyclodex capillary GC 25 m column, 25 mm i.d. (J &amp; W<br>

12.55 min for {R) and (S) alcohol, respectively.<br>
Conversion was found to be 41.7% and the ee of product<br>
and substrate in this conversion was found to be 98.5%<br>
and 70.42%, respectively, with an E value of 297. E<br>
was calculated according to C.S. Chen et al., J Am.<br>
Chem. Soc, 104, pp. 7294-99 (1982). See J.J. Lalonde<br>
et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 117, pp. 6845-52 (1995) for<br>
a discussion of the applicability of E for reactions<br>
affected by inhibition or catalyzed by crude enzymes.<br><br>
Resolution of (+)-Sulcatol<br>
To a solution of 80 mM (±)-Sulcatol and 120<br>
mM vinyl acetate in 1 ml of toluene was added 4 mg of<br>
the crosslinked LPS crystal formulation prepared in<br>
Example 1. The mixture was stirred at room temperature<br>
for 20 hours. The catalyst was then removed by<br>
filtration. The optical purity of product and<br>
remaining starting material were directly analyzed by<br>
GC using a chiral GC column. The ee of the remaining<br>
starting material and product alcohol was &gt;98% and<br>
51.3%, respectively.<br>
The chiral GC conditions were as follows:<br>
Cyclodex B capillary GC 25 m column, 25 mm i.d. (J &amp; W<br>
Scientific, Folsom, CA), helium flow at 1 ml/min.<br>
Temperature program: Initial: 90°C for 10 minutes,<br>

minutes. Retention time: (5)-sulcatol, 12.50 minutes;<br>
(R)-sulcatol, 12.32 minutes; (S)-sulcatol acetate,<br>
14.43 minutes; (R)-sulcatol acetate, 15.12 minutes.<br>
The conversion was 66.1%. The E value was calculated<br>
to be 27.<br>
Resolution of (+)-2-Qctanol<br>
To a solution of 80 mM (±)-2-octanol and 120<br>
mm vinyl acetate in 1 ml of toluene was added 4 mg of<br>
the crosslinked LPS crystal formulation prepared in<br>
Example 1. The mixture was stirred at room temperature<br>
for 4 hours. The catalyst was then removed by<br>
filtration. The optical purity of the acetate product<br>
was directly analyzed by GC using a chiral GC column.<br>
The ee was determined to be 63.0%. The remaining<br><br>
alcohol was converted to its corresponding butyrate by<br>
reaction with butyric anhydride in pyridine. The<br>
optical purity of the butyrate derivative was then<br>
analyzed with GC. The ee was 83.7%.<br>
The chiral GC conditions were as follows:<br>
Cyclodex B capillary GC 25 m column, 25 µm i.d. (J &amp; W<br>
Scientific, Folsom, CA), helium flow at 1 ml/min.<br>
Temperature program: Initial = 90°C for 10 minutes,<br>

minutes. Retention time: (S)-2-octanol acetate, 15.66<br>
minutes; (R)-2-octanol acetate, 16.93 minutes; (S)-2-<br>
octanol butyrate, 26.49 minutes; (R)-2-octanol<br>
butyrate, 26.95 minutes. The conversion was 57.1%.<br>

Resolution of Tryptamine<br>
A solution of 200 mM tryptamine and 400 mM<br>
2,2,2-trifluoroethyl butanoate in 1 ml of tert-butanol<br>
was incubated with 16 mg of the crosslinked ABL crystal<br>
formulation prepared in Example 3 on a rotary shaker at<br>
40°C. When the desired level of conversion was<br>
reached, the catalyst was removed by centrifugation and<br>
washed with ethyl acetate. The combined organic<br>
mixtures were evaporated in vacuo to give a residue<br>
which was then purified by silica gel column<br>
chromatography to give the remaining tryptamine and the<br>
butyl amide product. The optical purity of the butyl<br>
amide product was directly analyzed by chiral HPLC.<br>
The remaining amine was converted to its urethane<br>
derivative by treatment with methyl chloroformate and<br>
analyzed for optical purity by chiral HPLC: ee = 94% at<br><br>
20% conversion; R-alphamethyltryptamine; ee &gt; 98% at<br>
53% conversion.<br>
The chiral HPLC conditions were as follows:<br>
Chiracel OJ 25 cm column (Chiral Technologies, Exton,<br>
PA, a division of Daicel Chemical Inc.), for butyl<br>
amide; mobile phase = 80% hexane (with 0.1% TFA), 20%<br>
isopropanol (with 0.1% TFA), helium flow rate = 1<br>
ml/min., UV detection at 254 run. Retention times: D-<br>
butyl amide product, 9.3 minutes and L-butyl amide<br>
product, 11.2 minutes. D-urethane derivative, 24.8<br>
minutes and L-urethane derivative, 27.6 minutes.<br>
Each of the resolutions described above, was<br>
carried out with the crude enzyme counterpart to the<br>
crosslinked enzyme crystal formulation, using the<br>
enzyme concentrations listed in footnote (b) to Table 1<br>
below.<br><br><br>
a Crcsslinked enzyme crystal concentrations were 4, 1, 10, 1.2, 0.4, 0.4 and<br>
16 mq/ml.<br>
b Crude enzyme concentrations were 20, 15, 50, 8.3, 40, 40 and 28 mg/ml,<br>
respectively, going from top to bottom of the table.<br>
In Table 1, rates are displayed in<br>
µmol/min x mg at 25°C and concentrations are shown in<br>
brackets.<br>
In column 2 of the table, "VA" denotes vinyl<br>
acetate and "TFB" denotes trifluoroethyl butyrate. In<br>
column 3, the water content of the crude enzyme<br>
preparations was 9.3%, 2.5% and 5% for CRL, LPS and<br>
ABL, respectively.<br><br>
In column 4 of Table 1, the water content of<br>
the crosslinked enzyme crystal formulations was 13.3%,<br>
2.3% and 2.5% for CRL, LPS and ABL, respectively. The<br>
amount of surfactant in the final preparations of<br>
crosslinked enzyme crystal formulations were 16%, 40%<br>
and 50% (w/w) for CRL, LPS and ABL, respectively.<br>
In column 6 of Table 1, the total protein<br>
content in the crude preparations of CRL, LPS and ABL<br>
were 10%, 0.7% and 7%, respectively. The protein<br>
content of crude ABL was 50% (w/w).<br>
In column 7, reaction rates and enantio-<br>
selectivities were assayed by Cyclodex B, (R,R)Whelk-01<br>
(Ibuprofen) GC and Chiracel OJ (methyltryptamine)<br>
columns. E was calculated according to C.S. Chen<br>
et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc 104, pp. 7294-99 (1982).<br>
See J.J. Lalonde et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 117, pp.<br>
6845-52 (1995) for a discussion of the applicability of<br>
E for reactions affected by inhibition or catalyzed by<br>
crude enzymes.<br>
In column 8, Eapp was calculated as in an<br>
irreversible case based on the enantiomeric excess of<br>
the product at low conversion.<br>
As demonstrated in Table 1, the crosslinked<br>
enzyme crystal formulations of three different enzymes<br>
(two lipases and subtilisin) and their crude<br>
counterparts exhibited markedly different activity in<br>
the presence of organic solvents. The crosslinked<br>
enzyme crystal formulations were much more active than<br>
their crude counterparts on a weight basis (columns 4<br>
and 5), and in all of the reactions, their specific<br>
activity per mg of protein was higher as well (column<br>
6). Thus, in order to achieve the same activity in the<br>
resolution of menthol or sulcatol, for example, it is<br><br>
possible to use about 300 fold less catalyst. In the<br>
case of CRL and ABL, the striking difference in<br>
activities between the crude enzyme preparations and<br>
the crosslinked enzyme crystal formulations cannot be<br>
attributed to differences in water content. When crude<br>
CRL and ABL preparations were dried to the same water<br>
content as the crosslinked enzyme crystal formulations<br>
(13.3% for CRL and 2.5% for ABL) the activities changed<br>
by less than 12%.<br>
We believe this to be the first demonstration<br>
that pure lipases can be extremely active in organic<br>
solvents in heterogeneous form. In addition,<br>
crosslinked CRL crystal formulations exhibit much<br>
higher enantioselectivity than the crude CRL<br>
preparation, containing contaminants with different<br>
selectivity (Table, entrees 1-3). In this case, the<br>
increased enantioselectivity of the crosslinked enzyme<br>
crystal formulation was due to the removal of competing<br>
hydrolases [Lalonde et al., supra].<br>
The comparison of crosslinked enzyme crystal<br>
formulations with organic soluble lipase complexes is<br>
instructive. The specific activity of the LPS-<br>
crosslinked enzyme crystal in the resolution of<br>
phenethyl alcohol (19.5 umol/min x mg) and sulcatol<br>
(1.48 umol/min x mg) is either similar to.or higher<br>
than the activities achieved by soluble complexes in<br>
the same reactions [G. Ottolina et al., Biotechnol.<br>
Lett.. 14, pp. 947-52 (1992) and Qkahata et al. (1995),<br>
supra 1. However, the solubility of these complexes is<br>
limited in many organic solvents, thus making the high<br>
overall reaction rates difficult to achieve.<br>
Crosslinked enzyme crystal formulations according to<br>
this invention, on the other hand, can be employed in<br><br>
much higher quantities and, being insoluble, allow for<br>
easy separation and recycling.<br>
We believe that surfactants play a critical<br>
role in the observed activity enhancement which<br>
characterizes the crosslinked enzyme crystal<br>
formulations of this invention. See Example 9, infra.<br>
A combination of effects may account for the<br>
dramatic increase in activity of pure lipases in<br>
crosslinked enzyme crystal form. For example, the<br>
presence of amphiphilic surfactants may help to<br>
maintain a better water balance and native conformation<br>
of amphiphilic lipases, which in crude preparations can<br>
in part be achieved by different contaminants such as<br>
lipids, celite and other proteins. Finally,<br>
surfactants may simply facilitate the transfer of<br>
hydrophobic substrate molecules through the layer of<br>
tightly bound water to the binding site of an enzyme.<br>
While more work is necessary to elucidate the exact<br>
mechanism of the effects of surfactants on the<br>
crosslinked enzyme crystal formulation activity, the<br>
practical consequences of this phenomenon are<br>
immediately clear: high specific activity, purity and<br>
stability of crosslinked enzyme crystal formulations<br>
result in high catalyst productivity in organic<br>
solvents.<br>
Example 5 - Enzymatic Productivity<br>
In order to demonstrate the productivity of<br>
crosslinked enzyme crystal formulations in organic<br>
solvents on a preparative scale we chose the resolution<br>
of sec-phenethyl alcohol (50 mmol; 6.1 g) with vinyl<br>
acetate (50 mmol; 4.3 g) in toluene (100 mL) catalyzed<br>
by LPS-crosslinked enzyme crystals (1.3 mg solid; 1 mg<br><br>
protein). The reaction mixture was allowed to stir at<br>
room temperature for 16 hours, at which time the<br>
conversion reached 50%. The isolated yield of<br>
phenethyl acetate was 4.5 g (98.5% ee) giving the<br>
volumetric productivity of 30 g/1 and substrate to<br>
catalyst ratio of 4600. The productivity reached 8000<br>
after 72 hours when 100 mmol sec-phenethyl alcohol was<br>
used.<br>
The high productivity of low molecular weight<br>
synthetic catalysts is thought to be their key<br>
advantage over high molecular weight enzymes [E.N.<br>
Jacobsen and N.S. Finney, Chemistry &amp; Biology, 1, pp.<br>
85-90 (1994)]. This example clearly demonstrates that<br>
despite their high molecular weight and quite-unusual-<br>
for-enzymes reaction medium, crosslinked enzyme crystal<br>
formulations are highly productive catalysts which<br>
compare favorably even with the best of synthetic<br>
catalysts.<br>
Example 6 - Screening for Surfactants for LPS<br>
Samples of crosslinked LPS crystals were<br>
prepared as in Example 1. Each sample was exposed to a<br>
different surfactant and then dried in the presence of<br>
the organic solvent used in Example 1. Drying was<br>
carried out in a 1 ml volume of surfactant and organic<br>
solvent. In addition, crosslinked LPS crystals were<br>
prepared as in Example 1, and dried as above, without<br>
exposure to a surfactant. Enzymatic activity was<br>
measured in the resolution of phenylethyl alcohol.<br>
More specifically, 200 mM sec-phenethyl<br>
alcohol and 200 mM vinyl acetate in 1 ml toluene were<br>
added to 1.2 mg samples of dry crosslinked LPS<br>
crystals, some of which had been exposed to surfactants<br><br>
and some of which had not been exposed to surfactants.<br>
The reaction was allowed to proceed for 3 0 minutes,<br>
after which the % conversion was measured by gas<br>
chromatography. The results are shown in Table 2<br>
below.<br><br><br><br>
Example 7 - Screening for Surfactants for ABL<br>
Samples of crosslinked ABL crystals were<br>
prepared in Example 3. Each sample was exposed to a<br>
different surfactant and then dried in the presence of<br>
the same organic solvent used in Example 3. Drying was<br>
carried out in a 1 ml volume of surfactant and organic<br>
solvent. In addition, crosslinked ABL crystals were<br><br>
prepared as in Example 3, and dried as above, without<br>
exposure to a surfactant. Enzymatic activity was<br>
measured in the transesterification of N-Ac-PheOMe with<br>
n-propanol in isooctane.<br>
More specifically, 1 ml (11 mg) of N-acetyl-<br>
L-phenylalanine methyl ester and 20% 1-propanol in 80%<br>
isooctane were added to 1 mg samples of dry erosslinked<br>
ABL crystals, some of which had been exposed to<br>
surfactants and some of which had not been exposed to<br>
surfactants. The reaction was allowed to proceed for<br>
3 0 minutes, after which the % conversion was measured<br>
by gas chromatography. The results are shown in Table<br>
3 below.<br><br><br><br><br>
Example 8 - Screening for Surfactants for CRL<br>
Samples of crosslinked CRL crystals were<br>
prepared as in Example 2. Each sample was exposed to a<br>
different surfactant and then dried in the presence of<br>
the same organic solvent used in Example 2. Drying was<br>
carried out in a 1 ml volume of surfactant and organic<br>
solvent. In addition, crosslinked CRL crystals were<br>
prepared as in Example 2, and dried as above, without<br>
exposure to a surfactant. Enzymatic activity was<br>
measured in the transesterification of N-amyl alcohol<br>
with ethyl acetate in toluene.<br>
More specifically, 184 nM n-amyl alcohol in<br>
ethyl acetate and 1 ml toluene was added to 2 mg<br>
samples of dry crosslinked CRL crystals, some of which<br>
had been exposed to surfactants and some of which had<br>
not been exposed to surfactants. The reaction was<br>
allowed to proceed for 3 0 minutes, after which the %<br>
conversion was measured by gas chromatography. The<br>
results are shown in Table 4 below.<br><br><br><br>
Example 9 - Effect of Surfactants<br>
The following example demonstates the<br>
critical role of surfactants in the activity<br>
enhancement displayed by crosslinked enzyme crystal<br>
formulations according to this invention. We prepared<br>
crosslinked enzyme crystals as described in Examples 1-<br>
3, except that we dried them to a water content similar<br>
to that of the crosslinked enzyme crystal formulations<br>
of those examples, without the use of surfactants.<br>
Those water content levels were -- 13.3% water content<br><br>
for CRL; 1.7-2% water content for LPS and 2.2-2.4%<br>
water content for ABL.<br>
For each enzyme sample, drying was carried<br>
out in the presence of the same solvent used for that<br>
particular enzyme in Example 1, 2 or 3, on a smaller<br>
(1 ml) scale. We then measured initial activity<br>
levels, rather than % conversion, in the assays<br>
described in Examples 6-8 for the respective enzyme.<br>
We also measured the initial activity of each of the<br>
crosslinked enzyme crystal formulations of Examples 1-3<br>
in the respective assay for that enzyme (CRL assay:<br>
Example 8; LPS assay: Example 6; ABL assay:<br>
Example 7). As compared with the initial activity<br>
levels of the crosslinked enzyme crystal formulations<br>
of Examples 1-3, the initial activity of the<br>
crosslinked enzyme crystals dried without surfactants<br>
were 19-fold (ABL), 79-fold (LPS) and more than 100-<br>
fold lower (CRL).<br><br><br><br>
Example 10 - Screening of Surfactants<br>
We used an alternate procedure to screen a<br>
number of anionic, cationic and nonionic surfactants<br>
for use in producing crosslinked enzyme crystal<br>
formulations according to this invention. In this<br>
screening procedure, enzyme activity of crosslinked<br>
enzyme crystal formulations prepared as in Examples 6-8<br>
was measured after drying crosslinked enzyme crystals<br>
in a given surfactant in the presence of an organic<br>
solvent and after 12 days storage at room temperature.<br>
Activity of dry samples of CRL was measured in the<br>
transesterification of n-amyl alcohol with ethyl<br>
acetate in toluene, as described in Example 8.<br>
Activity of dry samples of ABL was measured in<br>
transesterification of N-Ac-PheOMe with n-propanol in<br>
isooctane, as described in Example 7. Activity of dry<br>
samples of LPS was measured in the resolution of<br>
phenylethyl alcohol, as described in Example 6. While<br>
enzymes exposed to several of the surfactants exhibited<br>
high activity after drying, only a few maintained this<br>
high level after storage. In addition to the<br>
surfactants used in these examples, several others --<br><br>
Tritons and dioctyl sulfosuccinate for CRL and dioctyl<br>
sulfosuccinate and 4 lauryl ether for ABL -- provided<br>
crosslinked enzyme crystal formulations that exhibited<br>
high activity after storage.<br>
