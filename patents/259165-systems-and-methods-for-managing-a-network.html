VPN module 64 allows for all of the tunnels connecting the device 14 to other devices<br>
14 to automatically reconfigure themselves to establish new tunnels to the device 14 at<br>
me new IP Address. According to various embodiments, the VPN module 64 of the<br>
device 14 allows for the cooperation of the device 14 and a remote access client.<br>
The DHCP server module 66 of the device 14 is operable to provide the device<br>
14 with DHCP server functionality. For example, according to various embodiments,<br>
the DHCP server module 66 allows the device 14 to provide IP addresses and<br>
configuration parameters to network devices requesting this information using the<br>
DHCP protocol. IP address pools with characteristics such as default gateways, domain<br>
names, and DNS servers can be defined. Static assignments can also be defined based<br>
on MAC address.<br>
The distributed network management poller module 68 of the device 14 is<br>
operable to provide the device 14 with distributed network management poller<br>
functionality. For example, according to various embodiments, the distributed network<br>
management poller module 68 allows the device 14 to poll network elements that<br>
comprise a portion of a local area network 18 and are in communication with the device<br>
14. For example, the distributed network management poller module 68 may utilize<br>
Internet control message protocol pings to determine a reachability value and a latency<br>
value for one or more of the network elements. The distributed network management<br>
poller module 68 may also utilize simple network management protocol (SNMP) to<br><br>
poll SNMP information from network elements that are SNMP capable. Such SNMP<br>
information may include, for example, CPU utilization or server temperature.<br>
The inline network performance monitoring module 70 of the device 14 is<br>
operable to provide the device 14 with inline network performance monitoring<br>
functionality. For example, according to various embodiments, the inline network<br>
performance monitoring module 70 allows the device 14 to inspect each packet that<br>
transits the device 14 and record certain information such as source/destination IP<br>
address, protocol, and source/destination ports.<br>
According to various embodiments, the inline network performance monitoring<br>
module 70 also allows the device 14 to monitor all network traffic that passes between<br>
the device 14 and another device 14. Each device 14 has its time synchronized precisely<br>
to network time protocol servers (not shown). This allows for each device 14 to<br>
reference packet information with a common time reference. According to various<br>
embodiments, the inline network performance monitoring module 70 can record me<br>
exact time every packet leaves a device 14, and record items such as, for example,<br>
source/destination IP address, protocol, sequence number and source/destination port.<br>
As the packets travel across the Internet 16, the packets eventually reach the destination<br>
device 14. The inline network performance monitoring module 70 of the destination<br>
device 14 records the exact time the packet is received by the destination device 14 and<br>
items such as, for example, source/destination IP address, protocol, sequence number<br>
and source/destination port.<br>
The logger module 72 of the device 14 is operable to provide the device 14 with<br>
logging functionality. For example, according to various embodiments, the logger<br>
module 72 allows information obtained by the device 14 (e.g., intrusion prevention<br><br>
detections, anti-virus detections, network device polling results, source/destination IP<br>
addresses, application performance measurements, etc.) to be recorded, processed and<br>
transmitted to the management center 12. According to various embodiments, the data<br>
collected by the inline network management monitoring module 70 of each device 14 is<br>
forwarded to the logger module 72 of the associated device 14. After receiving the data,<br>
the logger modules 72 wait a random amount of time (e.g., between approximately 120<br>
and 240 seconds) before transmitting the data to the management center 12. This<br>
random delay is to prevent all the devices 14 from sending their data back to the<br>
management center 12 at the same time. If the management center 12 cannot be<br>
reached, the device 14 may queue the data locally until the management center 12 can<br>
be reached. When the management center 12 is reached, the logger module 72 will<br>
transmit all of the queued data. The data that is transmitted uses a system queue which<br>
insures that regular user network traffic will always have priority and this data transfer<br>
will only use the unused bandwidth on the network connection.<br>
The remote access server module 74 of the device 14 is operable to provide the<br>
device 14 with remote access capability. For example, according to various<br>
embodiments, the remote access server module 74 allows for the cooperation of the<br>
device 14 with a remote access client.<br>
The IP and network interface module 76 is operable to provide the device 14<br>
with the capability to configure the network interface characteristics such as IP Address<br>
type (e.g., static IP, DHCP, or PPPOE), IP address, subnet mask, speed and duplex.<br>
The IP and network interface module 76 is also operable to provide the device 14 with<br>
the capability to configure IP routing.<br><br>
The QOS module 78 of the device 14 is operable to provide the device 14 with<br>
QOS functionality. For example, according to various embodiments, the QOS module<br>
78 allows the device 14 to selectively transmit packets based on the relative importance<br>
of the packet. The QOS module 48 may also allow the device 14 to inspect each packet<br>
and determine a particular queue to send the packet to based on defined rules. Rules<br>
may be defined, for example, based on source/destination IP address and/or port<br>
information. If a packet does not match any rule, it may be sent to a default queue.<br>
The VLAN module 80 of the device 14 is operable to provide the device 14<br>
with VLAN functionality. For example, according to various embodiments, the first<br>
and third fast Ethernet ports 24, 28 of me device 14 that are connected to the local area<br>
network 18 and the demilitarized zone 32 may be configured as 802.1q trunk ports. The<br>
VLAN module 80 allows the device 14 to connect to many different VLANS from an<br>
Ethernet switch that has enabled trunking.<br>
According to various embodiments, the device 14 may also automatically<br>
transmit performance information to the management center 12. The performance<br>
information may include, for example, a CPU utilization value for the device 14, a<br>
memory utilization value for the device 14, and a network interface bandwidth<br>
utilization value for the device 14. The performance data may also include, for<br>
example, the information obtained by the distributed network management poller<br>
module 68 of the device 14.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates various embodiments of the management center 12 of Figure<br>

contains the device 14 and set the status appropriately. The status and color for each<br>
higher level map is set to represent the status of the underlying map. The color of each<br>
map item represents the severity of the most severe problem of a device 14 in mat<br>
region. For example, if a device 14 is not operating as expected, all of the maps mat<br>
have a region that include this device 14 will be shown as red. If a device 14 is<br>
operating in a manner associated with the color yellow, all of the maps mat have a<br>
region that include this device 14 will be shown as yellow. A map region will only be<br>
shown as green if all devices 14 included in that map region are operating as expected.<br>

Figure 10 illustrates various embodiments of a method of managing a network.<br>
According to various embodiments, the method includes receiving an activation key<br><br>
automatically transmitted from a device connected to the network, automatically<br>
transmitting a configuration to the device, automatically maintaining the configuration<br>
of the device, and receiving log information from the device. The network may be, for<br>
example, a local area network, or a number of local area networks that rely on the<br>
Internet to communicate with one another. The device may be, for example, the device<br>
14 described hereinabove. The method may be utilized to provide an automated<br>
managed service for a complex network environment.<br>
The process starts at block 200, where the management center 12 receives an<br>
activation key automatically transmitted from a device 14 connected to the network.<br>
Prior to the start of the process at block 200, the configuration of the device 14 is<br>
provisioned by an entity such as, for example, an administrator or a managed service<br>
provider. The entity may initiate the provisioning of the device 14 by logging onto the<br>
web-based management portal 90 and entering a license key associated with the device<br>
14. The license key may be generated by a managed service provider and may be<br>
issued with the purchase of the device 14. The license key may include information<br>
such as the product type of me device 14, the term length of the license associated with<br>
the device 14, and the seller of the license. A hash function may be used to embed the<br>
information in the key to obscure the data, and me data may be read by the network<br>
manager to verify the authenticity of the license key.<br>
Once the license key is received by the web-based management portal 90, the<br>
configuration of the device 14 may be provisioned via the web-based management<br>
portal 90. Setting the configuration of the device 14 may include setting the IP address<br>
of the device 14, and setting the configurations for the firewall configuration, the<br>
intrusion prevention configuration, the anti-virus configuration, me content filtering<br><br>
configuration, the anti-spam configuration, the VPN configuration, the DHCP server<br>
configuration, the network management configuration, the network interface<br>
configuration, the VLAN configuration, the QOS configuration and any other device<br>
configurations. Each configuration provisioned for the device 14 may be stored in the<br>
database cluster 82. According to various embodiments, a default configuration may be<br>
selected for the device 14.<br>
During the provisioning process, an activation key associated with the device 14<br>
is generated and may be printed out or e-mailed for later use. The configuration of the<br>
device 14 and the generation of the activation key may be completed from any location<br>
by accessing the web-based management portal 90.<br>
Once the provisioning process is completed, the device 14 may be installed at<br>
the customer location. After the device 14 is connected to the local area network 18,<br>
the device 14 automatically attempts to DHCP for a wide area network IP address. As<br>
most Internet service providers assign IP addresses using DHCP, in most cases the<br>
device 14 will automatically obtain its wide area network IP address. For Internet<br>
service providers who do not use DHCP, the wide area network IP address can be<br>
obtained using PPPOE. Alternatively, a wide area network IP address may be statically<br>
assigned to the devicel4.<br>
According to various embodiments, the device 14 is configured with the DNS<br>
names of a number of the hosted servers that comprise the activation server 84. Once<br>
the device 14 obtains a wide area network IP address, the device 14 automatically<br>
attempts to communicate with one of the hosted servers that comprise the activation<br>
server 84. When the communication is successful, the activation key is entered and the<br>
device 14 transmits the activation key to the activation server 84. The activation key<br><br>
may be entered by an installer of the device 14. The process associated with block 200<br>
may be repeated for any number of devices 14.<br>
From block 200, the process advances to block 210, where the activation server<br>
84 automatically transmits the configuration provisioned at block 200 to the device 14.<br>
After the device 14 receives its configuration from the activation server 84, an installer of the device 14 may be prompted to reboot the device 14. Once the device 14 reboots,<br>
the device 14 automatically connects to its assigned manager server 88 and the<br>
installation of the device 14 is complete. The process associated with block 210 may<br>
be repeated for any number of devices 14<br>
From block 210, the process advances to block 220, where the management<br>
center 12 automatically maintains the configuration of the device 14. According to<br>
various embodiments, a flag is set in the database servers of the database cluster 82<br>
when a change to the configuration of the device 14 is entered via the web-based<br>
management portal 90. According to various embodiments, the auto-provisioning<br>
manager module 100 periodically polls the database cluster 82 looking for changes to<br>
the configurations of the devices 14 managed by the manager server 88. When the<br>
auto-provisioning manager module 100 detects a device configuration that needs to be<br>
changed, the appropriate module (e.g., firewall, intrusion prevention, anti-virus, etc.)<br>
will generate the new configuration for the particular service and make the necessary<br>
configuration changes to the device 14 that needs to be updated. The process<br>
associated with block 220 may be repeated for any number of devices 14.<br>
From block 220, the process advances to block 230, where the logger manager<br>
86 receives log information from the device 14. As explained previously, the log"<br>
information received from each device 14 may be compressed and encrypted, and may<br><br>
represent information associated with, for example, a firewall system, an intrusion<br>
prevention system, an anti-virus system, a content filtering system, an anti-spam<br>
system, etc. residing at the particular device 14. Once the logger manager 86 receives<br>

server 88.<br>
From block 320, the process advances to block 330, where the network<br>
performance is determined based on the information. According to various<br>
embodiments, the network performance determination is made by the manager server<br>
88. For example, assume that ten VOIP packets leave a first device 14 destined for a<br>
second device 14. As explained previously, the first device 14 may record the exact<br>
time each VOIP packet leaves, and the source/destination IP Address, protocol,<br>
sequence number and source/destination port for each VOIP packet. The first device<br>
14 may then send this information to the manager server 88. Further assume that these<br>
ten VOIP packets travel over the Internet 16, the third and eighth VOIP packets are lost,<br>
dropped by a router that is over-utilized. The second device 14 will only see eight<br>
VOIP packets arrive, not knowing that the third and eighth packets were lost. The<br>
second device 14 may then record the exact time each packet is received and the<br>
source/destination IP Address, protocol, sequence number, and source/destination port<br>
for each received packet. The second device 14 may then send this information to the<br>
manager server 88. The manager server 88 may then examine the information<br><br>
transmitted from the first and second devices 12, 14 and determine, based on the IP<br>
Address, protocol, sequence number, and source/destination port that the packets<br>
recorded by bom the first and second devices 14 are part of the same packet stream.<br>
Armed with this information, the manager server 88 may then determine the exact<br>
latency and jitter of each packet, and me packet loss (20% in this example) on a real<br>
application data stream. The process associated with block 330 may be repeated for<br>
network traffic information received from any number of devices 14.<br>

user is authorized to connect to, and automatically transmitting to a remote access client<br>
a list of devices the remote access user is authorized to connect to. The network may<br>
be, for example, a local area network, or a number of local area networks mat rely on<br>
the Internet to communicate with one another. The device may be, for example, the<br>
device 14 described hereinabove. The method may be utilized to provide an automated<br>
managed service for a complex network environment.<br>
The process starts at block 340, where credentials associated with a remote<br>
access user is received from a remote access client. The remote access user is a user<br>
who is located at a site that does not have a device 14 associated therewith. According<br>
to various embodiments, the credentials are received by the web-based management<br>
portal 90. The remote access client may be implemented as a software client installed<br>
on a personal computer such as, for example, a desktop computer or a laptop computer.<br>
According to various embodiments, when the software client is launched, it requires the<br><br>
remote access user to input their credentials (e.g., company ID, username, password).<br>
After the remote access user enters the credentials, the software client may make a<br>
secure socket layer connection to the web-based management portal 90. The process<br>
associated with block 340 may be repeated for any number of remote access users.<br>
From block 340, the process advances to block 350, where the credentials are<br>
automatically validated. According to various embodiments, the credentials may be<br>
automatically validated by the web-based management portal 90. If the credentials are<br>
not valid, me web-based management portal 90 may return an error message to the<br>
remote access client which may then prompt the remote access user to reenter their<br>
credentials. The process associated with block 350 may be repeated for any number of<br>
remote access users.<br>
From block 350, the process advance to block 360, where it is determined which<br>
devices 14 connected to the network the remote access user is authorized to connect to.<br>
According to various embodiments, the determination is made by the web-based<br>
management portal 90. The process associated with block 360 may be repeated for any<br>
number of remote access users.<br>
From block 360, the process advances to block 370, where a list of the devices<br>
14 is automatically transmitted to a remote access client associated with the remote<br>
access user. According to various embodiments, the list is automatically transmitted<br>
from the web-based management portal 90. Once the list is presented to the remote<br>
access user and a particular device 14 is selected, an encrypted tunnel may be<br>
established between me personal computer and the selected device 14. The process<br>
associated with block 370 may be repeated for any number of remote access users.<br>
