ARE FILTERED<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]The present invention relates generally to secured communication networks.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to a system, apparatus and a method for<br>
establishing a secured communications link between a remote device and a gateway device,<br>
whereby at least the remote device (e.g., such as a remote computing device) is configured<br>
to capture and redirect packet traffic at that remote device, and to modify the packets for<br>
minimizing latency of encrypted packet traffic for real-time applications.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]Internet Protocol Security ('IPsec") and Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") are<br>
examples of conventional encryption protocols that are used to establish virtual private<br>
networks ("VPNs") over a public communications network, such as the Internet, to ensure<br>
that only authorized users can access data in the VPNs. While functional, traditional VPNs<br>
implementing these and other conventional encryption protocols have several drawbacks.<br>
[0003]A drawback to implementing IPsec, for example, is that most firewalls cannot<br>
effectively route IPsec-encrypted packet traffic with minimal effort, especially those<br>
performing network address translation ("NAT"). Although NAT traversal techniques exist<br>
to pass IPsec-encrypted packets through NAT firewalls, these techniques limit IPsec-<br>
encrypted packets to a couple of ports (e.g., port 80 and 443), thereby forming bottlenecks.<br>
Another drawback is that VPNs implementing IPsec require that an address assigned to a<br>
remote computing device be visible by a private network to which that remote device is<br>
connected, giving rise to a vulnerability to certain breaches in security. For example, a<br>
worm infecting a client in the private network can use the visible address of the remote<br>
device to propagate itself into a private network including that remote device. At least some<br>
of the drawbacks of IPsec-based VPNs are due to performing both packet inspection and<br>
encryption at the network layer, such as at the Ethernet frame-level.<br><br>
[0004]0ne drawback to implementing SSL, for example, is that this protocol is<br>
typically limited to web applications, thereby precluding the use of numerous other<br>
applications mat are not browser-based. Another drawback is that SSL-based VPNs do<br>
support a wide range of routing protocols. Consequently, SSL-based VPNs cannot<br>
generally support real-time applications, such as voice over IP, or "VoIP," and peer-to-peer<br>
applications. At least some of the drawbacks of SSL-based VPNs are due to performing<br>
both packet inspection and encryption at the transport layer (or the applications layer),<br>
which limits routing protocols to, for example, User Data Protocol ("UDP") and<br>
Transmission Control Protocol ("TCP").<br>
[0005]Thus, there is a need for a system, an apparatus and a method to overcome the<br>
drawbacks of the above-mentioned implementations of encryption protocols in VPNs, and<br>
in particular, to establish a secured communications link from a remote computing device to<br>
a private network by capturing and redirecting packet traffic at the remote device and by<br>
modifying the packets to at least minimize the latency of encrypted packet traffic for real-<br>
time applications.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]A system, apparatus and a method for implementing a secured<br>
communications link at a layer other than that at which packets are filtered are disclosed. In<br>
one embodiment, a computer system is configured to form a virtual private network<br>
("VPN") and comprises an address inspection driver to identify initial target packet traffic<br>
addressed to a target server. Also, the computer system includes a pseudo server module to<br>
receive rerouted initial target packet traffic from the address inspection driver. The pseudp<br>
server module is configured to convey packet regeneration instructions to a VPN gateway.<br>
The address inspection driver functions to identify additional target packet traffic addressed<br>
to the target server and routes the additional target packet traffic to the pseudo server. In<br>
one embodiment, the pseudo server is configured to strip header information from the<br>
additional target packet traffic to form a payload, and thereafter, to route the payload to the<br>
target server.<br>
[0007]A method is disclosed, according to another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, whereby the method secures communications with a remote client computing<br>
device by establishing a virtual private network. The method comprises generating packet<br>
traffic with a communication application running on a client computing device, identifying<br><br>
at the client computing device target packet traffic of the packet traffic that is addressed to a<br>
target server, forming a secure communications link between a pseudo server module on the<br>
computing device and the target server, directing additional packet traffic addressed to the target<br>
server to the pseudo server module, sending an acknowledgment to the communication<br>
application upon receipt of the additional packet traffic rerouted to the pseudo server module,<br>
and routing a payload of said additional packet traffic to the target server.<br>
[0008] In yet another embodiment, a virtual private network comprises a client machine<br>
configured as a pseudo server machine with respect to a communication application running on<br>
the client machine. The communication application is configured to receive packet traffic<br>
acknowledgements from the pseudo server machine, said client machine identifying packet<br>
traffic addressed to a server machine and directing said packet traffic addressed to said server<br>
machinate said pseudo server machine. A virtual private network gateway is included arid is<br>
operative with a server machine to exchange communications between said pseudo server<br>
machine and said server machine, thereby facilitating secure communications between the client<br>
machine and the server machine, said pseudo server machine routing a payload of said traffic via<br>
said virtual private network gateway to said server machine.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0016]FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating a virtual private network ("VPN") system for<br>
establishing a secured communications link between a remote computing device and a VPN<br>
gateway computing device, according to one embodiment of the present invention. A<br>
virtual private network 100 includes a remote client computing device ("client") 110<br>
coupled via a secured communications link ("secured comm. link") 190 to private network<br>
150 for exchanging encrypted data. Remote client computing device 110 is configured to<br>
capture and reroute packet traffic associated with one or more virtual private networks<br>
private networks ("VPNs") at or near the network layer (i.e., Layer 2 of the Open System<br>
Interconnection model, or "OSF model). By capturing and inspecting packets at the<br>
network layer, remote client computing device 110 is able to inspect a wide range of<br>
network traffic including, for example, Internet Protocol ("IP"), TCP, UDP, Internet Control<br>
Message Protocol ("ICMP"), Generic Routing Encapsulation ("GRE") techniques, Apple<br>
talk, Netbios, etc. Further, remote client computing device 110 can generate secured<br>
communications link 190 (or "tunnel") at or near the transport layer (i.e., Layer 4), thereby<br>
permitting encrypted packets to pass through network address translation ("NAT")-based<br>
firewalls and network devices. In at least one embodiment, private network 150 assigns an<br>
address to remote client computing device 110 that can be concealed from computing<br>
devices (e.g., target server 154) in that private network, thereby reducing exposure of<br>
remote client computing device 110 to security threats, such as worms. In a specific<br>
embodiment, remote client computing device 110 is configured to modify packets by, for<br>
example, stripping header information prior to transport via secured communications link<br>
190, thereby minimizing latency of encrypted packet traffic in real-time applications.<br>
[0017]Although not shown, remote client computing device 110 includes a<br>
processor and a memory for executing and storing programs instructions, respectively, for<br>
running various user-level computer software applications (e.g., Microsoft Outlook®)<br>
Remote client computing device 110 includes a communication application 112 as an<br><br>
intermediary to exchange data between the computer software applications to private<br>
network 150. Examples of communication application 112 are telnet, File Transfer Protocol<br>
("FTP"), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol ("SMTP"), Hypertext Transfer Protocol ("HTTP")<br>
and the like.<br>
[0018]Also, remote client computing device 110 includes a tunnel generator 116<br>
configured to generate at least one end of secured communications link 190. Tunnel<br>
generator 116 includes an address inspection driver ("AID") 122, a pseudo server ("PS")<br>
120 and an encryptor 124, each of which is composed of either hardware or software, of<br>
both. Address inspection driver ("AID") 122 is disposed at or near the network layer to<br>
capture and inspect packet traffic, such as network (e.g., Ethernet) frames, traversing the<br>
one or more network adapters of remote client computing device 110. During inspection of<br>
for example, the IP headers of captured packets, address inspection driver 122 determines:<br>
whether the captured packets are destined for private network 150. If a packet is not bound<br>
for private network 150, then address inspection driver 122 forwards the packet as an<br>
unencrypted packet via path 114 out into Internet 102.<br>
[0019]But when packet traffic is identified as being destined to private network 150<br>
(i.e., "target packet traffic"), address inspection driver 122 filters that packet traffic from<br>
passing out onto path 114. Address inspection driver 122 reconfigures the filtered packets<br>
(i.e., the target packet traffic) as "incoming packets" to reroute them to a traffic port on<br>
pseudo server 120. In some embodiments, that traffic port can be a "well known port" on<br>
remote client computing device 110, where a well known port can be any of port numbers 0<br>
to 1024, or the like. In addition, address inspection driver 122 is configured to also send<br>
control information encapsulated as control packets along with the rerouted filtered packets<br>
to pseudo server 120. Note that it is not necessary to generate a control packet for every<br>
rerouted filtered packet as pseudo server 120 can detect other packets to which the same<br>
control information will be applicable. While address inspection driver 122 can be<br>
implemented in accordance with the Network Driver Interface Specification ("NDIS"), it<br>
can also be implemented in program instructions operable with any known operating<br>
system, such as UNK®, Linux, Microsoft Windows™ and the like.<br>
[0020]Pseudo server ('TS") 120 is disposed at or hear the transport layer to receive<br>
encrypted packet traffic from secured communications link 190 and to transmit (i.e.,<br>
redirect) encrypted packet traffic that is rerouted from address inspection driver 122. In<br>
some embodiments, pseudo server 120 is configured to modify packets by, for example,<br><br>
stripping header information prior to transport via secured communications link 190. In<br>
operation, pseudo server 120 monitors (or "listens" to) its traffic ports waiting to accept<br>
incoming rerouted packets and any control packets that get passed from address inspection<br>
driver 122. Pseudo server 120 associates the control packets with respective rerouted<br>
packets, and then creates a message frame 132 for transmission to private network 150.<br>
Message frame 132 includes, among other things, regeneration instructions for<br>
reconstructing the packets at private network 150. Note that message frame 132 is generally<br>
then encrypted and sent over secured communications link 190 to private network 150.<br>
[0021]Note that when pseudo server 120 receives encrypted packet traffic from<br>
secured communications link 190 rather than transmitting it, pseudo server 120 provides for<br>
the decryption of those packets by passing them to encryptor 124. Then, pseudo server 120<br>
passes the decrypted' packets to address inspection driver 122, along with control<br>
information, if any. In response, address inspection driver 122 reconfigures those decrypted<br>
packets signals as "mcoming packets" to reroute them to communication application 112.<br>
[0022]In at least one embodiment, pseudo server 120 is configured to modify<br>
outgoing packets to form modified packets. In this example, pseudo server 120 can strip<br>
header information from the outgoing packets bound for private network 150. Examples of<br>
header information that can be stripped include TCP headers, IP headers, link layer headers,<br>
and the like. The residual data of the packets from which the header information is stripped<br>
is referred to as "modified packets," each including a payload. A modified packet is<br>
depicted in FIG. 1 as "payload" 138. Further, message frame 132 includes regeneration<br>
instructions to reconstruct the stripped header information for regenerating the pre-modified<br>
packets in private network 150. In some cases, message frame 132 can include<br>
authentication information. Once message frame 132 is understood by at least one entity of<br>
private network 150, a link acknowledgment ("ACK") 134 is returned to tunnel generator<br>
116. In a specific embodiment of the present invention, pseudo server 120 forms modified<br>
packets as pseudo-UDP packets, which constitute additional traffic 136 composed of<br>
modified packets 138 to be conveyed to private network 150. As such, tunnel generator 116<br>
generates an acknowledgement 130 when sending modified packet 138 to prevent delays<br>
associated with acknowledgements required by TCP standards. Acknowledgement 130 can<br>
be implemented as a "false acknowledgement" so that remote client computing device need<br>
not wait for an acknowledgment (e.g., a TCP acknowledgement) when sending a modified<br>
packet 138. Accordingly, modified packets 138 are TCP packets that can behave as UDP<br><br>
packets. As such, secured communications link 190 can be referred to as a "virtual TCP<br>
connection" rather than a standard TCP connection as the packets traversing link 190 are<br>
UDP packets masquerading as TCP packets. In one embodiment, tunnel generator 116<br>
determines that traffic target packets includes a certain type of data, such as video or audio<br>
data, that is time sensitive (i.e., part of a real-time application) and selectively modifies<br>
those traffic target packets to form modified packets 138.<br>
[0023]Encryptor 124 is configured to establish a connection with private network<br>
150 and to encrypt and decrypt packets exiting and entering, respectively, remote client<br>
computing device 110. For example, encryptor 124 can establish a connection using Hyper<br>
Text Transfer Protocol over Secure Socket Layer ("HTTPS"), Proxy HTTPS and like<br>
connection protocols. With these connection protocols being operative generally at a<br>
transportation layer (or a higher layer), encryptor 124 establishes a connection that is<br>
suitable for traversing NAT-based firewalls and bridges. Once a connection (e.g., HTTPS)<br>
is established, the payload of the packets bound for private network 150 is encrypted using,<br>
for example, Secure Socket Layer ("SSL"), Transport Layer Security ("TLS") Protocol, or<br>
the like. Encryptor 124 can encrypt an entire packet including header information, such as<br>
an IP header, if not stripped.<br>
[0024]Private network 150 includes a VPN Gateway 152 and a target server 154<br>
which represents any computing device (as either a server or a client) with which remote;<br>
client computing device 110 establishes communications. VPN Gateway 152 is at:<br>
intermediary computing device that coordinates establishment of secured communications<br>
link 190 with remote client computing device 110. VPN Gateway 152 exchanges;<br>
communications between remote client computing device 110 and target server 154,<br>
Further, VPN Gateway 152 is similar, at least in some respects, to remote client computing<br>
device 110. Namely, VPN Gateway 152 includes a processor, a memory and an encryptor,<br>
all of which are not shown, as well as address inspection driver ("AID") 122 and a pseudo<br>
server ('TS") 120. AID 122 and PS 120 have similar functionality and/or structure as those<br>
described in relation to remote client computing device 110.<br>
[0025]VPN Gateway 152 also includes a tunnel manager ("Tunnel Mgr") 160 and<br>
an address translator ("Addr Trans") 162. Tunnel manager 160 is configured to" download<br>
as a software program at least pseudo server 120 and address inspection driver 122. Also,<br>
tunnel manager 160 is configured to provide configuration information. The configuration<br>
information can include a range of addresses that are associated with private network 150 so<br><br>
that remote client computing device 110 can select which packets to filter out as target<br>
packet traffic. Further, tunnel manager 160 is also configured to receive message frame 132<br>
and to regenerate packets to, for example, include IP header information and/or the assigned<br>
address of remote client computing device 110.<br>
[0026]Address translator 162 is configured to provide a NAT process, and<br>
specifically, a reverse NAT process to hide the assigned address of remote client computing<br>
device 110 from target server 154. To illustrate, consider the following example in which a<br>
TCP connection is created from remote client computing device 110 to target server 154,<br>
which has a destination address of 192.168.1.100. First, a TCP SYN packet is generated for<br>
address 192.168.1.100. Tunnel generator 116 passes this SYN packet over secured<br>
communications link 190. VPN Gateway 152 examines the packet as it arrives and<br>
determines that it is a SYN packet for 192.168.1.100. In turn, VPN Gateway 152 generates<br>
a new SYN (i.e., replays or regenerates that packet) destined for 192.168.1.100, with a<br>
source address appearing to indicated that the new SYN packet originated from 192.168.1.2.<br>
which is the private address for VPN Gateway 152. After target server 154 at address<br>
192.168.1.100 generates a SYN-ACK packet, VPN Gateway 152 then receives this packet<br>
Then, a new SYN-ACK packet is in turn conveyed over secured communications link 190<br>
back to tunnel generator 116, which then generates a SYN-ACK packet. This packet<br>
appears to originate from target server 154 at address 192.168.1.100, as viewed by remote<br>
client computing device 110. In short, VPN Gateway 152 is able to reverse map reply<br>
packets and acknowledgments or any other packet as part of that protocol by using unique:<br>
source port numbers of VPN Gateway 152. In this manner, remote client computing devices<br>
110 is able to connect to any foreign private network and still maintain IP invisibility. Such<br>
invisibility can be on an application-by-application basis. In some cases, VPN Gateway 152<br>
can optionally enable address visibility by sending an assigned private address for a<br>
successfully established secured communications link to a tunnel generator, which in turn,<br>
assigns that private address to the remote client computing device in which it resides. But<br>
note that the visibility of the address of remote client computing device is not mandatory,<br>
but can be optionally enabled, for example, to facilitate certain applications, such as voice<br>
applications or any other peer-to-peer applications.<br>
[0027]In a specific embodiment, remote client computing device 110 can establish<br>
another secured communications link 192 (which is similar to that of link 190) to another<br>
private network ("n") 198 simultaneous to the pendency of secured communications link<br><br>
190. As such, remote client computing device 110 can simultaneously establish multiple VPN<br>
tunnels or secured communications links to different private subnets or networks, especially in<br>
cases where destination network addresses overlap partially or completely. Note that while<br>
internet 102 is exemplified as a communications network through which secured<br>
communications link 190 can be established in accordance with an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, remote client computing device 110 can employ tunnel generator 116 to form tunnels<br>
to any type of communications networks, such as a wireless network. It will also be understood<br>
that the embodiments of the present invention may be implemented using any routing protocol<br>
(e.g., internet Protocol version 6, "IPv6"), in any packet switching technology (e.g., an Ethernet<br>
network), over any communications media (e.g., Ethernet cabling, wireless, optical fibers, etc.)<br>
and for use with any computing device (e.g., a wireless station) as an end station, without<br>
deviating from the scope and the spirit of the present invention.<br>
[0028] FIG. 2 is a flow diagram 200 depicting an exemplary method of communicating<br>
packets over a secured communications link, according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention. At 202, a communications application running on a remote client computing device,<br>
such a telnet application, generates packet traffic in response to a request by a user-level<br>
application to access a private network. The client computing device at 204 identifies target<br>
packet traffic bound for a target server. At 206, the target packet traffic is rerouted to a pseudo<br>
server module to at least convey packet regeneration instructions to, for example, a VPN<br>
Gateway. The client computing device, receives a link acknowledgement sent from the VPN<br>
Gateway at 208, thereby signaling, for example, that a secured communications link between the<br>
client and the private network is operational, ill turn, the link acknowledgment is conveyed at<br>
210 to the communications application to initiate packet transfer. At 212, additional packet<br>
traffic addressed to the target server can be directed to the pseudo server module from, for<br>
example, an address inspection driver. Thereafter, at 214, an acknowledgement can be sent to<br>
the communications application upon receipt of the additional packet traffic at the pseudo server<br>
module prior to transmission to the target server, according to at least one embodiment of the<br>
present invention., ill some embodiments, header information is stripped from: the additional<br>
packet traffic to form a payload at 216. Then, the payload at 218 is routed to the VPN Gateway.<br>
[0029] FIG. 3 is a block diagram 300 for describing a remote client computing device in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Computing device 302 in this<br><br>
example is capable of exchanging encrypted packet traffic 390 with another computing device<br>
located, for example, on a private network via a secured communications link 380. For the<br>
example shown in FIG. 3, computing device 302 includes an operating system 304 coupled to a<br>
network interface card ("NIC") 324, which can be, for example, an Ethernet network adapter.<br>
Operating system 304 also includes a protocol stack 330, which can be any set of network<br>
protocols for binding high-level protocol layers, such as an application layer, to lower-level<br>
protocol layers, such as a physical layer including NIC 324. As shown, protocol stack includes a<br>
pseudo server 317, an address inspection driver 323 and an encryption protocol 310 in<br>
accordance with a specific embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0030] Protocol stack 330 is shown to include at least a transport layer, a network layer<br>
and a link layer. The transport layer includes at least one transport protocol, such as a UDP<br>
process 312, a TCP process 314 (i.e., a TCP service) or an optional another type of transport<br>
protocol, "other transport" protocol 316, such as "ICMP." FIG. 3 shows that the network layer,<br>
which includes an IP process 318 (i.e., an IPv4 or IPv6 service), can be at a next higher layer<br>
over the link layer, for this example, pseudo server 317 is disposed at the transport layer and<br>
address inspection driver 323 is disposed near the network layer. In particular, address inspection<br>
driver 323 is disposed at the data link layer. An encryption protocol 330, such as SSL, can be<br>
disposed along side or above pseudo server 317, and is suitable to implement encryptor 124 of<br>
FIG. 1. for FIG. 3, encryption protocol 330 is in a layer above TCP process 314.<br>
[0031] According to one embodiment of the present invention, protocol stack 330 is a<br>
collection of processes embodied in software, for another embodiment, protocol stack 330 and/or<br>
its constituents can be embodied in software or hardware, or both. Each process (e.g., TCP 314,<br>
IP 318, etc.) of protocol stack 330 is configured to communicate with each other process, such as<br>
across layers of protocol stack 330. A higher-level layer, such as the transport layer, can be<br>
configured to communicate, for example, via a Winsock API 308 (or any other socket layer<br>
program to establish, for example, raw sockets) with an application 306. Winsock API 308<br>
provides an interface with application 306, which can be a telnet application. A lower-level<br>
layer, such as either a network layer or a link layer, can be configured to communicate, for<br>
example, via a MAC driver 322 with NIC 324. Exemplary interactions between pseudo server<br>
317 and address inspection driver 323 to establish a secured communications link are described<br>
next in FIGs. 4 and 5.<br><br>
[0032]FIG. 4 is a functional block diagram 400 illustrating the interaction between a<br>
pseudo server and an address inspection driver when transmitting target packet traffic from<br>
a remote client to a private network, according to a specific embodiment of the present<br>
invention. In this example, encryptor 124 and pseudo server 120 are disposed at transport<br>
layer 404 and address inspection driver ("AI Drvr") 122 is disposed at network layer 408<br>
Again, note that in some embodiments address inspection driver resides at the data link<br>
layer. Pseudo server 120 is coupled to a port forwarding mapping data structure 440 that<br>
maintains packet information, such as a "key," a source address ("SA"), a source port<br>
("SP"), a destination address ("DA"), and a destination port ("DP"). Similarly, address;<br>
inspection driver 122 maintains a similar data structure depicted as a driver mapping table<br>
data structure 422. Further, address inspection driver 122 is also coupled to a filter table<br>
420 that includes configuration information provided by a VPN Gateway. Filter table 420<br>
includes network addresses, such as a source address and a destination address (e.g.,<br>
198.0.0.80), an optional subnet mask (not shown), a protocol, such as TCP, UDP, ICMP,<br>
etc. (not shown), port information, such as a source port and a destination port, and a unique<br>
mapping key to uniquely identify destination information associated with target packet<br>
traffic. Pseudo server 120 and address inspection driver 122 synchronize these data<br>
structures by exchanging control information, such as in a control packet 434, when a<br>
change is made to one of those data structures. An exemplary control packet 434 can be a<br>
UDP packet or a packet of any other protocol, and is typically sent with rerouted data<br>
packets to pseudo server 120. If some of the control information includes updates to entry<br>
442, such as a change in destination port, than that change is entered. In some cases, the<br>
control information includes how the packet should be handled or regenerated at the VPN<br>
Gateway.<br>
[0033] Consider that application 112 resides on a remote client computing device and<br>
is identifiable by a source address of 10.0.02 and a source port of 8678, and a target server<br>
(not shown) resides at destination address 198.0.0.80 and destination port 445. If address<br>
inspection driver 122 has yet to detect the destination address or port in packet traffic 462,<br>
then a destination address and a destination port for that target server is stored in driver<br>
mapping table data structure 422. In this case, an entry 424 is made in data structure 422 to<br>
include a source address ("SA") as 10.0.0.2, a source port ("SP") as 8678, a destination<br>
address ("DA") as 198.0.0.80, and a destination port ("DP") as 445, as well as a "key" that<br>
is generated and assigned to the packet traffic by address inspection driver 122. Note that<br><br>
entry 426 signifies that application 112 has formed another secured communications link to<br>
another VPN Gateway and that address inspection driver 112 is configured to inspect packet<br>
traffic relating to both entries 424 and 426. As such, multiple VPNs can be established<br>
concurrently with application 112.<br>
[0034]Next, consider that application 112 is generating target packet traffic 464 that<br>
is destined for destination address 198.0.0.80 and destination port 445. This target packet<br>
traffic 464 passes through a socket layer 402 to pseudo server 120. Socket layer 402 can<br>
include a Winsock API, a Winsock provider or any other socket connection provider<br>
process (e.g., a programming interface that provides for raw sockets), regardless of<br>
operating system. Pseudo server 120 matches entries of data structure 440 to information in<br>
target packet traffic 464 to determine whether that packet traffic is part of a VPN. Since an<br>
entry in data structure 440 includes a DA and a DP that respectively correspond to<br>
198.0.0.80 and 445, a match is made and pseudo server 120 concludes that packet traffic<br>
464 is to be routed via a secured communications link. Pseudo server 120 then passes target<br>
packet traffic 466 to address inspection driver 122, whereby target packet traffic 466 is<br>
characterized by source address ("SA") 450, source port ("SP") 452, destination address<br>
("DA") 454 and destination port ('DP") 456. Note that FIG. 4 shows packet 466 and other<br>
packets with select address and port information; other packet data, including payload, is<br>
omitted for discussion purposes.<br>
[0035] Address inspection driver 122 then reconfigures target packet traffic 466 and<br>
reroutes it back to pseudo server 120 as rerouted packet 432. In at least one embodiment,<br>
address inspection driver 122 reconfigures SP 452 to include a "key," which in this<br>
example, is "54321." Also, DA and DP are respectively reconfigured to include a local host<br>
or a local machine ("LM") address 454 and a traffic port ("TP") 456. In a specific<br>
embodiment, local machine address 454 is 127.0.0.1, which is a loop back address causing<br>
rerouted packet 432 to be sent up the OSI protocol stack. Address inspection driver 122<br>
sends rerouted packet 432 up to traffic port ("TP") 430 of pseudo server 120, where TP 430<br>
is a listening port for detecting, for example, TCP packets. In some embodiments, rerouted<br>
packet 432 is sent to a TCP traffic port of pseudo server 120 regardless of whether rerouted<br>
packet 432 is a UDP packet, such as in the case where pseudo server 120 generates a<br>
pseudo-UDP packet as a modified packet. Concurrently (or nearly so), control packet 434<br>
includes a local machine address (not shown) so that it can be sent up the OSI protocol stack<br>
to a control port (not shown) of pseudo server 120. In such a case, control packet 434<br><br>
includes information describing the modifications to a packet to form rerouted packet 432.<br>
Thereafter, pseudo server 120 then redirects rerouted packet 432 to encryptor 124 to form<br>
an encrypted packet 468 that is passed through a secured communications link.<br>
[0036]FIG. 5 is a functional block diagram 500 illustrating the interaction between a<br>
pseudo server and an address inspection driver after the receipt of encrypted packet traffic<br>
into a remote client from a private network, according to a specific embodiment of the<br>
present invention. To illustrate the interaction, consider that an encrypted packet 502 is<br>
passed through to encryptor 124 for decryption. Then, the decrypted packet is passed to<br>
pseudo server 120, which matches at least some of the contents of the decrypted packet<br>
against data in data structure ("port fwd table") 440. Consider that a match is made, thereby<br>
signifying that the decrypted packet is part of an established VPN. As such, pseudo server<br>
120 provides decrypted packet 504 and an attendant control packet 505, which in this case<br>
includes the key associated with packet 504, to a well known port ("WKP") 506 of address<br>
inspection driver 122. Thereafter, address inspection driver 122 reconfigures decrypted<br>
packet 504 in accordance with information indexed by the key into driver table 422, which<br>
is similar to the data structure of FIG. 4. As such, the reconfigured packet will include<br>
destination information that identifies application 112. As such, rerouted packet 432 is<br>
signaled as an "incoming" (or received) packet 520 and is passed up the protocol stack to<br>
application 112.<br>
[0037]FIG. 6 is a block diagram 600 illustrating various modules of a pseudo server<br>
to modify packets for real-time applications, according to at least one embodiment of the<br>
present invention. As shown, pseudo server 604 includes a flag-UDP-as-TCP module 605,<br>
a packet modifier module 607, and an acknowledgement generator ("ack gen") 609, one or<br>
more of which can be simultaneously operative when sending packets through a secure<br>
communications link of the present invention. Although real-time packet traffic, such as<br>
voice and video, benefits from the performance advantages of a session-less protocol, such<br>
as UDP, standard UDP packets are generally difficult to traverse through many firewalls,<br>
whereas TCP traffic is not so disadvantaged. In at least one specific embodiment of the<br>
present invention, pseudo server 604 is configured to form "pseudo-UDP" packets using<br>
modified TCP packets.<br>
[0038]Flag-UDP-as-TCP module 605 is configured to flag a UDP packet as a TCP<br>
packet in the IP header, which fools the communications network into thinking that the<br>
packets are part of a TCP session. Packet modifier 607 is configured to operate with raw<br><br>
socket connection process 603 of socket layer 602. In particular, packet modifier 607 strips<br>
header information, such as IP header information, and sends the remaining payload via raw<br>
socket connections formed by raw socket connection process 603. As such, regeneration<br>
instructions are also sent to describe how to reconstruct packets after those packets pass<br>
through a secured communications link with header information stripped out. In one<br>
embodiment, the regeneration instructions include information for regenerating header<br>
information at the target server so that the target packet traffic can be converted from a first<br>
format to a second format. In cases where the first format is associated with Transmission<br>
Control Protocol ("TCP") and the a second format is associated with User Data Protocol<br>
("UDP"), then the first packet is formatted as a pseudo-UDP (e.g., a UDP packet flagged as<br>
a TCP packet), and the second packet is formatted as UDP packet for transmission of, for<br>
example, real-time applications.<br>
[0039]Acknowledgement generator ("ack gen") 609 is configured to issue "false<br>
acknowledgments" in response to TCP representations of UDP packets (i.e., pseudo-UDP<br>
packets) being transmitted over the secure communications link. This allows for UDP-like<br>
behavior to TCP traffic, in that if the TCP packet (i.e., the pseudo-UDP packet) was lost, no<br>
attempt is made by either the transmitting end or the receiving end of the VPN tunnel to <br>
synchronize sequence numbers and retransmit that packet. Consequently, the VPN <br>
interprets the fomarding of pseudo-UDP packets as the forwarding TCP packets, but with<br>
raw sockets on either end of the secured communications link interpreting whether these<br>
packets are UDP packets carrying voice (such as RTP) or video.<br>
[0040]Various structures and methods for estabhshing a secured communications<br>
link, such as with a pseudo server and an address inspection driver, are described herein.<br>
The methods can be governed by or include software processes, for example, as part of a<br>
software program. In one embodiment, a pseudo server module and an address inspection<br>
driver module are disposed in a software program embedded in a computer readable<br>
medium that contains instructions for execution on a computer to implement a secured<br>
communications link, according to the present invention.<br>
[0041] An embodiment of the present invention relates to a computer storage product<br>
with a computer-readable medium having computer code thereon for performing various<br>
computer-implemented operations. The media and computer code may be those specially<br>
designed and constructed for the purposes of the present invention, or they may be of the<br>
kind well known and available to those having skill in the computer software arts.<br><br>
Examples of computer-readable media include, but are not limited to: magnetic media such<br>
as hard disks, floppy disks, and magnetic tape; optical media such as CD-ROMs and<br>
holographic devices; magneto-optical media such as floptical disks; and hardware devices<br>
that are specially configured to store and execute program code, such as application-specific<br>
integrated circuits ("ASICs"), programmable logic devices ("PLDs") and ROM and RAM<br>
devices. Examples of computer code include machine code, such as produced by a<br>
compiler, and files containing higher-level code that are executed by a computer using an<br>
interpreter. For example, an embodiment of the invention may be implemented using Java,<br>
C++, or other programming language and development tools. Another embodiment of the<br>
invention may be implemented in hardwired circuitry in place of, or in combination with,<br>
machine-executable software instructions.<br>

VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK, METHOD FOR SECURING COMMUNICATIONS WITH<br>
REMOTE CLIENT COMPUTING DEVICE BY ESTABLISHING VIRTUAL PRIVATE<br>
NETWORK AND COMPUTER SYSTEM THEREFOR<br>
The present invention relates to a system, apparatus and a method for securing communications with a<br>
target server 154 by establishing a virtual private network ("VPN") are disclosed. In one embodiment,<br>
a computer system is configured to form a VPN and comprises an address inspection driver 122 to<br>
identify initial target packet traffic addressed to a target server 154. The computer system includes a<br>
pseudo server 120 to receive rerouted initial target packet traffic from the address inspection driver<br>
