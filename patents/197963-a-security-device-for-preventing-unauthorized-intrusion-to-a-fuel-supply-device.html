				<td>The invention proceeds from a security arrange¬ment according to the pre-characterizing clause of Patent Claim 1. In such an arrangement known from EP-Al-0,629,532, a simple cover, which encloses an electrical circuit including a solenoid valve on a fuel injection pump, is provided. In this case, the cover and the  --connection connecting, this . to the fuel injection pump are arranged in such a way that the screw connection is no longer accessible after the injection pump has been installed. The cover can be unscrewed and access to the solenoid valve afforded only by removing the pump. In fuel injection pumps, such solenoid valves serve for preventing fuel from being supplied to the pump working spaces of the fuel injection pump when the internal combustion engine is stopped or switched off. Before the internal combustion engine is started, such a solenoid valve has to be opened. This is carried out by means of an electrical control device, part of which is located inside the cover in the known version. If a person wants to start the internal combustion engine without authorization, this could be done by manipulating the solenoid valve. However, this is possible only when the latter is also accessible. The electrical circuit located under the cover prevents the solenoid valve from being readily capable of being manipulated from outside the cover. Electrical access to the solenoid valve is denied by means of a security code and other security measures. Mechanical intrusion could nonetheless put the operating capacity of the solenoid valve out of action and basically bring it into the open position. It would consequently become  possible  to  steal  the  vehicle<br><br>
belonging to the internal combustion engine.<br>
The known security arrangement is intended to prevent this by means of the cover provided. However, the cover provided there is designed as a simple sheet-metal part which can still be opened forcibly under the action of lever tools or cutting tools. In that case, direct access to the solenoid valve would become possible once again.<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
In contrast to this, the advantage of the security arrangement according to the invention is that not only is an operating element (such as, for example, the solenoid valve) protected by the cap-shaped element against access, including an electrical holding device protecting electrical access to the solenoid valve, but even an attempt to reach the operating element forcibly leads to a permanent operating fault in the fuel supply device. In an attempt to reach the operating or setting elements forcibly, if a specific destructive force is exceeded a break occurs, as a result of which a setting or operating element is put out of operation or is broken out of its position necessary for it to operate or a limiting wall of fuel-conducting spaces of the fuel supply device is perforated, so that fuel can escape, and, for this reason too, the operation of the fuel supply device is disrupted permanently and so that it cannot readily be repaired quickly.<br>
The cap-shaped element ensures that a forcible removal of this element within a prescribed minimum time is not possible by means of tools, and that, even when access to the solenoid valve is achieved after lengthy manipulation beyond the prescribed security time, activa¬tion of the fuel supply device is prevented permanently.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment according to Patent Claim 2, the security arrangement is designed in such a way that it opposes considerable resistance to chip-removing and cutting tools. Manganese steel in particular is extremely difficult to machine by the removal of chips<br><br>
and is impact-resistant. It can also be processed as cast steel, so that an optimizing shape for the cap-shaped element is possible without notch-sensitive edges which could lower resistance.<br>
In an advantageous development according to Claim 3, the cap-shaped element is fastened internally to the enclosed part of the fuel supply device by means of a screw connection and is protected from outside access by a part which can be removed only by destruction. These can be mouldings which can be pressed into an outlet orifice in the cap-shaped element and which can be removed only with extreme difficulty by force.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment according to Patent Claim 4, a connection of the cap-shaped element to the enclosed part of the fuel supply device is made by means of an internal catch connection which no longer has outside access. The cap can therefore be removed from its installation position only by destruction.<br>
According to Patent Claim 6, the part having the predetermined breaking point is made from a material which has siibstantially lower toughness than the material of the cap-shaped element. The moment of resistance pre¬determined by virtue of design thus ensures that, at all events, a break in the region of that part of the fuel supply device which is enclosed by the cap-shaped element occurs before the cap-shaped element itself is destroyed. Advantageously, according to Patent Claim 7, the connec¬tion between the cap-shaped element and the enclosed part^ of the fuel supply device is made by means of a positive connection on an operating or setting element. For this purpose, the operating or setting element has catching or positive-connection surfaces, on which catching or positive-connection surfaces of the cap-shaped element engage. These can be screw connections or, for example, also positive connections or snap connections. In this case, a plurality of operating or setting elements can be protected against access by means of the cap-shaped element, for example, in particular, a solenoid valve according to Patent Claim 11 and an electrical security<br><br>
circuit activating the latter and provided with a secu¬rity code. At the same time, the security circuit pre¬vents electrical access to the operating and setting element, namely the solenoid valve, and the cap-shaped element prevents mechanical access to the latter, in order to prevent, inter alia, electrical contacting which bypasses the security circuit from being carried out from the solenoid valve or the solenoid valve from being manipulated or the latter from being replaced by a screw plug.<br>
The connection of the cap-shaped element to the part enclosed by it is made especially advantageously on a connection piece which has a passage duct to the interior of the fuel supply device. A predetermined breaking point can be implemented especially advantage¬ously on such a connection piece, and such a connection piece is advantageously at the Scime time also a receptacle for an operating or setting element which controls essential setting functions inside the fuel supply device. By breaking off the connection piece, the wall to the interior of the fuel supply device is advan¬tageously perforated, so that fuel can escape from the fuel-conducting spaces of the latter and an operating fault thus occurs in the fuel supply device. Particularly in the case of diesel fuel injection pumps, the interior serves for receiving a control pressure which is formed from fuel and which controls essential functions of the fuel injection p\imp. In addition, the operation of a fuel injection pump is disrupted very quickly if air infiltrates into the interior as a result of leakage points. In a further advantageous development, the operating or setting element, to which the cap-shaped element is connected, is an adjusting screw for adjusting the basic setting for injection on a fuel injection pump. If such a screw breaks out at its fastening point formed according to Claim 12, not only is the fuel interior opened to the outside, but the setting of the fuel injection ptimp is also adjusted in such a way that the associated vehicle can no longer be driven. In this case.<br><br>
' The predetermined breaking point can also be placed in such a way that, in the embodiment according to Patent claim 16 subsequent reinsertion of the operating or setting element with temporary fixing no longer ensures the sealing-off. Moreover, the necessary accuracy of the setting by means of such an adjusting screw is so high that temporary refastening, as a rule, can no longer make it possible to operate the fuel injection pump together with the associated internal combustion engine. Further advantages embodiments of the invention are listed in subclaims 19 to 24, which indicate various advantageous possibilities for fastening the cap-shaped element to that part of the fuel supply device which is enclosed by the said element.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a security device for preventing unauthorized intrusion to a setting or operating element which projects from the limiting wall of a fuel supply device, especially of a fuel injection pump, with a cap-shaped element which is fixed to the fuel supply device and which engages over the setting or operating element projecting on the limiting wall and, together with the limiting wall encloses thj said setting or op'^rating element, characterized in that the cap-shaped element is connected to the fuel supply device in such a way that removal of the cap-shaped element from the fuel supply device is only by destructive means, and a predetermined breaking region is additionally provided so that, when a specific destructive force is exceeded, a break occurs at a predetermined breaking point which is provided on the at least one setting or operating element or the limiting wall carrying it, especially a limiting wall of fuel-conducting spaces of the fuel supply device, or on the limiting wall at a fastening point of the cap-shaped element relative to the limiting wall.<br><br>

Description	^<br>
For the instance of use in a distributor fuel injection pump. Figure 1 illustrates diagrammatically a step by a reciprocating-piston distributor injection pump. In this case, there is inserted in a housing 1 a bush 2, in the cylinder bore 3 of which a pump piston 4, which serves at the same time as a distributor piston, is moved to and fro in a way not shown any further. In the end face, the pump piston 4 encloses a pump working space 6 relative to the closed end of the cylinder bore 3. The pump working space is filled with fuel via longitudinal grooves 7 during the suction stroke of the pump piston by way of a suction conduit 9 opening into the cylinder bore 3. The suction conduit 9 leads off from a suction space 10 of the fuel injection pump, the said suction space being filled with fuel which is regulated at a control pressure. For example, the control pressure is controlled as a function of engine speed and/or load and serves for controlling an injection timer which, since it is known, is not illustrated in any further detail here. The passage cross-section of the suction conduit is controlled by a setting or operating element in the form of a solenoid valve 11 of known design which is screwed into a bore 12 in the pump housing 1 from outside. To start operation, the solenoid valve is energized and opens the suction conduit 9. To stop the internal combus¬tion engine supplied by the fuel injection pximp, the solenoid valve 11 is closed. The pump working space is connected to the suction space 10 via a longitudinal duct 14, which runs in the pump piston, starting from the end face of the latter, and via a transverse bore 15 in a part of the pump piston which projects into the suction space 10. At the same time, the opening is controlled by a regulating slide 16 of the fuel injection pump, the said regulating slide being adjustable by means of a governor lever 17. Depending on the axial position of the regulating slide, which slides sealingly on the outer surface of the pump piston, the pump working space is opened sooner or later during the delivery stroke of the<br><br>
pxomp piston, so that the pump working space is relieved, high-pressure injection thereby being terminated. For high-pressure injection,- during the respective stroke of the pTimp piston the longitudinal duct 14 is in each case connected via a distributor groove 18 to an injection conduit 19 which leads to a fuel injection valve not shown any further here. In the course of the rotation of the pump piston, another injection conduit 19 in each case comes successively into overlap with the distributor groove 18 during each pump-piston stroke.<br>
The governor levers serving for controlling the regulating slide 19 are mounted on an adjusting lever 21 which is pivotable about a fixed axis 22 counter to the force of a spring 23. To set the pivoting position of the adjusting lever, which sets the initial position of the regulating slide 16 by means of this pivoting position, an adjusting screw 25, which is screwed into a connection piece 26 of the limiting wall 27 of the suction space 10, is provided as a setting or operating element. The connection piece has a passage bore 29 with an internal thread 30, into which the external thread 31 of the adjusting screw 25 is screwed. To fix the screw-in depth of the adjusting screw, a lock nut 32, which is supported on the end face of the connection piece 26, is screwed onto the external thread 31.<br>
The previous illustration of the fuel injection pump according to Figure 1 corresponds to a conventional known distributor injection pump of the reciprocating-piston type, in which access to the solenoid valve 11 is now to be prevented, so that, after the fuel injection pump or the associated internal combustion engine has stopped, an vmauthorized person cannot make the fuel injection pump operational again by applying current to or manipulating the solenoid valve so as to put the suction conduit 9 into the open state. This can also be done, for example, by unscrewing the solenoid valve from the bore 12 and closing the latter by means of a screw plug. Provided as a remedy for this is a cap-shaped element 34 which is connected flush to the surface of the<br><br>
housing 35 of the injection pump and on the inside, together with the housing surface, encloses the solenoid valve 11 as a setting or operating element. The cap-shaped housing is fastened at that end of the adjusting screw which projects from the connection piece 26, the said adjusting screw likewise constituting a setting or operating element. This fastening is illustrated in more detail in the following Figures 2 to 6b, specifically in different embodiments. Furthermore, within the interior 36, which is formed between the housing surface 25 and the cap-shaped element 34, there is provided a security circuit 18a, indicated in Figure 6b, which is inserted between an electrical control and/or supply line, not shown any further here, and the solenoid valve 11. This security circuit allows the electromagnet of the solenoid valve to be energized only under special preconditions, which may, for example, be a security code and which ensure that only the authorized user can put the fuel injection pump into operation, in order thereby, in turn, to operate an internal combustion engine or an associated motor vehicle.<br>
Figure 2 shows a first exemplary embodiment of the cap-shaped element 34 according to the invention. As can be seen, this is connected flush to a housing surface 35, illustrated vertically here, into which is intro¬duced, for example, the bore 12 of Figure 1, although this, together with the solenoid valve, is not illus¬trated in any further detail here. The housing surface 35' running at right angles to the housing surface 35 has the connection piece 26 and a further connection piece 38, which is located outside the cap-shaped element and into which a screw 3 9 is screwed. The latter serves for fixing a tab 40 which has a passage hole, not shown any further here, and which projects in one piece at right angles from the cap-shaped element 34. The cross-section shows, in the cap-shaped element 34, which, together with the housing surfaces 35, 35', encloses the interior 36, a recess in the form of a passage box-e 42 for receiving the connection piece 26 and that part of the adjusting<br><br>
screw 25 which projects from the said connection piece 26. The connection piece 26 has the internal thread 30, into which the external thread 31 of the adjusting screw 2 5 is screwed in such a way that that part of the adjust¬ing screw which follows the external thread projects through the passage bore 29 of the connection piece into the suction space 10 and serves there as a stop for the adjusting lever 21, as mentioned in relation to Figure 1. To seal the suction space 10 relative to the outside, a toroidal sealing ring 47 (0-ring) is inserted on the adjusting screw between two collars 46, which sealing ring seals off the suction space 10 relative to the outside with respect to the inner wall of the passage bore 29 of the connection piece 26 in the region between the internal thread 30 and the entry of the passage bore into the said suction space. For adjustment, the ad¬justing screw has a slot 48 on its outer end face and the adjusting screw is then secured in the set position by means of the lock nut 32. In this state, the cap-shaped element is then guided over the adjusting screw, the said cap-shaped element having, in the inner wall of the passage bore 42, a retaining ring projecting into the bore 42 or a retaining pin 49 which extends transversely through the passage bore 42. This retaining ring or retaining pin 49 is directly adjacent to the nut 32. A screw-on part or a second nut 50 is subsequently screwed onto the threaded end of the adjusting screw, so that the retaining ring or retaining pin comes to rest between the two nuts and prevents the cap-shaped element 43 from being capable of being removed again. In order to prevent access to this screw-on part 50, a closing cap 51 is pressed into the passage bore 42 so as to adjoin the inner walls of the latter in a flush manner. The said closing cap can be removed from the passage bore again only by destruction.<br>
A firm connection between the cap-shaped element 34 and a part of the fuel supply device, the said part being enclosed by the cap-shaped element, is made in the way described and can subsequently no longer be readily<br><br>
released. The tab 40 also provided serves merely for fixing the cap-shaped element in a relatively movable manner in the installation position and for relieving the fastening point in that part of the fuel supply device which is enclosed by the cap-shaped element. Now, if the cap-shaped element 34 is manipulated, the tab 40 breaks off first, so that the cap-shaped element cannot be removed from its fitted position. Moreover, the positive connection to the housing of the fuel supply device prevents the cap-shaped element from being twisted. Furthermore, if the cap-shaped element is manipulated with the aim of removing it, the connection piece 26 is designed in such a way that a break occurs at a predeter¬mined breaking point 52 on the connection piece under the action of force. This predetermined breaking point is preferably located in the region between the thread 3 0 and the passage bore 2 9 of the connection piece 26, the said passage bore leading further towards the suction space 10. Arrangements of predetermined breaking points 52' or 52" in the region of the transition between the connection piece 26 and the limiting wall 27 are also advantageous. If the connection piece 2 6 breaks, although the cap-shaped element 34 can then be removed and access to another setting or operating part, such as, for example, the solenoid valve 11, would then become possible, the limiting wall 27 of the suction space 10 is destroyed at the location of the connection piece 26 on account of the break, so that fuel can escape here. Even if the adjusting screw 25 is subsequently inserted again at this point, the set position cannot readily be repro¬duced, so that the basic setting of the fuel injection pump is, as a rule, altered here in such a way that the driveability of an internal combustion engine having this fuel injection pump is no longer ensured. If the pre¬determined breaking point is located above the toroidal sealing ring, it would still be possible to seal off the suction space 10 relative to the outside. In contrast, if the predetermined breaking point is preferably located between the point of sealing-off by the toroidal sealing<br><br>
ring 47 and the suction space lo, it is not reaaiiy possible to restore the leakproofing of the limiting wall 27. At all events, considerable time, predetermined as a security time span, is required for a repair. The secu¬rity arrangement according to the invention is accor¬dingly not even intended basically to prevent access to the setting or operating elements, but to avoid access being achieved within a security time in such a way that the vehicle belonging to the fuel supply device can also be made operational within this time.<br>
Predetermined breaking points 52' or 52", which are provided in that region of the limiting wall 27 which is directly adjacent to the connection piece 26, make it very difficult to reseal the fuel injection pump and therefore operate it again. It would be even more difficult, here, to adjust the setting element and seal off the suction space. As a rule, due to the leak, air infiltrates into the suction space 10 and immediately leads to an operating fault in the fuel injection pump, or else the necessary control pressure then cannot be built up for the purpose of the fault-free operation of the fuel injection pump and the associated internal combustion engine.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment according to Ficpure 3, an adjusting screw 125 serving as a setting or operat¬ing element is provided, having an external thread 31 which is screwed into the internal thread 44 of the passage bore 29 of the connection piece 26, in a similar way to the exemplary embodiment according to Figure 2. Once again, the bolt-shaped part 45 of the adjusting screw 125, the said bolt-shaped part following the external thread 31 towards the suction space 10, carries the toroidal sealing ring 47 which ensures sealing-off relative to the outside with respect to the passage bore 29. To ensure the screw-in depth, once again the nut 32 is screwed on the adjusting screw 125 and is supported on the end face of the connection piece 26. Between this nut 32 and the screw-on part 127, an annular web 12 8 projects from the inner wall of the passage bore 42 into the<br><br>
interior of the passage bore 42, in such a way that the cap-shaped element 134 can be moved only within the scope of the play between the nut 32 and screw-on part 127. As an additional safeguard, a spring ring 13 0 is sprung into an inner annular groove 12 9 of the passage bore 42 on that side of the screw-on part 127 which faces away from the suction space 10, the said spring ring preventing the screw-on part 127 from being capable of being unscrewed. Siibsequently, as in the exemplary embodiment according to Figure 2, the passage bore 42 is closed by means of the closing cap 51, which is driven in as far as the spring ring 130 serving as a retaining ring. Here too, the predetermined breaking point 52 is provided at the transition between the internal thread 44 and that part of the passage bore 29 which follows and which runs towards the suction space 10.<br>
In the version according to Figure 4, the cap-shaped element 134 is designed in the same way as in the exemplary embodiment according to Figure 3, with the annular web 12 8 which comes to rest between the nut 32 and the screw-on part 127. In the exemplary embodiment according to Figure 4, the internal thread 144 is now located in that part of the passage bore 29 which is directly adjacent to the suction space 10. Sealing-off takes place in a part 131 of widened diameter, following towards the outside, of the passage bore 29 which emerges on the end face 132 of the connection piece 126. Within this part of widened-diameter 131, the adjusting screw 225 has the collars 146 which are known from the exempla¬ry embodiment according to Figure 1 and between which the toroidal sealing ring 47 is inserted as a seal. In this exemplary embodiment, the predetermined breaking point is designed as a notch 150 in the limiting wall 27, in such a way that the notch directly adjoins the diameter of the connection piece 126 in an annular manner. In this design, therefore, a break occurs directly in the limit¬ing wall 27, which is intended to enclose the fuel-conducting suction space 10. In this exemplary embodi¬ment, sealing-off relative to the suction space 10 is<br><br>
located on the far side of the predetermined breaking point 150, so that it is no longer possible to ensure that the limiting wall 27 is leakproof by reinserting the broken-off connection piece 126 together with the adjust¬ing screw 225, the further advantage being that, if a wall is broken out, it is substantially more difficult to bring the broken-out part exactly into the original position again, to ensure that the necessary basic setting of the fuel injection piomp would be restored. It is not possible for a fuel injection pump damaged in this way to operate continuously.<br>
In the fourth exemplary embodiment according to Figures 5a and 5b, the lock nut 160, which had the function of the lock nut 32 in the preceding exemplary embodiments, is provided with an annular groove 161 which leaves space to drive a pin into the cap-shaped element 234 transversely relative to the axis of the adjusting screw 325, as shown in Figure 5b. This shows, in a section perpendicular to the axis of the adjusting screw 325 through the middle of the annular groove 161, that there is provided in the cap-shaped element 234 a blind bore 162 which intersects the passage bore 142 of the cap-shaped element and of which the position relative to the axis of the setting element 325 is such that a pin 163 can engage flush into the annular groove 161 and subsequently be driven into the blind bore 162. Due to the design as a blind bore, the pin cannot be driven out again by being driven further in, and it could, at most, be drilled out. Advantageously, therefore, the pin 163 is designed as a hardened steel pin which cannot readily be drilled out. The cap-shaped element itself consists of a tough material which is difficult to machine-cut, such as, for example, manganese steel or hard manganese steel or cast manganese steel. This property ensures that the relatively more brittle material of the limiting wall, or of the connection piece breaks at the predetermined breaking point before destruction of the cap-shaped element occurs.<br>
In the last exemplary embodiment according to<br><br>
Figures 6a and 6b, the cap-shaped element 334 is con¬nected on its inside to a cup-like part 170, the interior 171 of which is matched to the outer contour of the adjusting screw 425 projecting from the connection piece 226 and having a lock nut 432. Furthermore, the cup-like part 170 has an annular collar 172 which projects into the interior 171 and which has an introduction slope 173 towards the connection piece 226. A catch element 176 is provided between the lock nut 432 and the end face 174 of the connection piece 226, with resilient arms 177 which point towards the connection piece 226 and which, when the cap-shaped element 334 is slipped onto the adjusting screw 425, slide over the introduction slope 173 and catch on the catching surface 175 of the annular collar 172, the said catching surface being located opposite the introduction slope 173. A cap-shaped element 334 inter¬locked with the fuel supply device in this way can be removed again only by destruction. The solenoid valve 11 then comes to rest in the interior 13 6 located next to the cup-shaped part 170. Also arranged in this interior is the security circuit 180, which is therefore also no longer accessible and which is connected to the sur¬roundings only by means of a small line-carrying orifice 181. Figure 6b also shows the connecting cable 182 to the solenoid valve 11. In addition, the cap-shaped element can also be fastened to the fuel supply device or the fuel injection pixmp in a vibration-proof manner via flanges 184.<br><br><br>
