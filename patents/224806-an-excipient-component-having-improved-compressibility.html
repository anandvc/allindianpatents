				<td>PHARMACEUTICAL EXCIPIENT HAVING<br>
IMPROVED COMPRESSIBILITY<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel excipient for use in the manufacture<br>
of Pharmaceuticals, and in particular, solid dosage forms such as tablets which<br>
include one or more active ingredients.<br>
In order to prepare a solid dosage form containing one or more active<br>
ingredients (such as drugs), it is necessary that the material to be compressed into<br>
the dosage form possess certain physical characteristics which lend themselves to<br>
processing in such a manner. Among other things, the material to be compressed<br>
must be free-flowing, must be lubricated, and, importantly, must possess sufficient<br>
cohesiveness to insure that the solid dosage form remains intact after compression.<br>
In the case of tablets, the tablet is formed by pressure being applied to the<br>
material to be tabletted on a tablet press. A tablet press includes a lower punch<br>
which fits into a die from the bottom and a upper punch having a corresponding<br>
shape and dimension which enters the die cavity from the top after the tabletting<br>
material fills the die cavity. The tablet is formed by pressure applied on the lower<br>
and upper punches. The ability of the material to flow freely into the die is<br>
important in order to insure that there is a uniform filling of the die and a<br>
continuous movement of the material from the source of the material, e.g. a feeder<br>
hopper. The lubricity of the material is crucial in the preparation of the solid dosage<br>
forms since the compressed material must be readily ejected from the punch faces.<br>
Since most drugs have none or only some of these properties, methods of<br>
tablet formulation have been developed in order to impart these desirable character-<br>
istics to the material(s) which is to be compressed into a solid dosage form.<br>
Typically, the material to be compressed into a solid dosage form includes one or<br>
more excipients which impart the free-flowing, lubrication, and cohesive properties<br>
to the drug(s) which is being formulated into a dosage form.<br>
Lubricants are typically added to avoid the material(s) being tabletted from<br>
sticking to the punches. Commonly used lubricants include magnesium stearate and<br>
calcium stearate. Such lubricants are commonly included in the final tabletted<br>
product in amounts of less than 1% by weight.<br>
In addition to lubricants, solid dosage forms often contain diluents. Diluents<br>
are frequently added in order to increase the bulk weight of the material to be<br>
tabletted in order to make the tablet a practical size for compression. This is often<br>
necessary where the dose of the drug is relatively small.<br>
Another commonly used class of excipients in solid dosage forms are<br>
binders. Binders are agents which impart cohesive qualities to the powdered<br>
material(s). Commonly used binders include starch, and sugars such as sucrose,<br>
glucose, dextrose, and lactose.<br>
Disintegrants are often included in order to ensure that the ultimately<br>
prepared compressed solid dosage form has an acceptable disintegration rate in an<br>
environment of use (such as the gastrointestinal tract). Typical disintegrants include<br>
starch derivatives and salts of carboxymethylcellulose.<br>
There are three general methods of preparation of the materials to be<br>
included in the solid dosage form prior to compression: (1) dry granulation; (2)<br>
direct compression; and (3) wet granulation.<br>
Dry granulation procedures may be utilized where one of the constituents,<br>
either the drug or the diluent, has sufficient cohesive properties to be tabletted. The<br>
method includes mixing the ingredients, slugging the ingredients, dry screening,<br>
lubricating and finally compressing the ingredients.<br>
In direct compression, the powdered material(s) to be included in the solid<br>
dosage form is compressed directly without modifying the physical nature of the<br>
material itself.<br>
The wet granulation procedure includes mixing the powders to be<br>
incorporated into the dosage form in, e.g., a twin shell blender or double-cone<br>
blender and thereafter adding solutions of a binding agent to the mixed powders to<br>
obtain a granulation. Thereafter, the damp mass is screened, e.g., in a 6- or 8-mesh<br>
screen and then dried, e.g., via tray drying, the use of a fluid-bed dryer, spray-dryer,<br>
radio-frequency dryer, microwave, vacuum, or infra-red dryer.<br>
The use of direct compression is limited to those situations where the drug<br>
or active ingredient has a requisite crystalline structure and physical characteristics<br>
required for formation of a pharmaceutically acceptable tablet. On the other hand,<br>
it is well known in the art to include one or more excipients which make the direct<br>
compression method applicable to drugs or active ingredients which do not possess<br>
the requisite physical properties. For solid dosage forms wherein the drug itself is<br>
to be administered in a relatively high dose (e.g., the drug itself comprises a<br>
substantial portion of the total tablet weight), it is necessary that the drug(s) itself<br>
have sufficient physical characteristics (e.g., cohesiveness) for the ingredients to be<br>
directly compressed.<br>
Typically, however, excipients are added to the formulation which impart<br>
good flow and compression characteristics to the material as a whole which is to be<br>
compressed. Such properties are typically imparted to these excipients via a pre-<br>
processing step such as wet granulation, slugging, spray drying, spheronization, or<br>
crystallization. Useful direct compression excipients include processed forms of<br>
cellulose, sugars, and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, among others.<br>
A processed cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, has been utilized<br>
extensively in the pharmaceutical industry as a direct compression vehicle for solid<br>
dosage forms. Microcrystalline cellulose is commercially available under the<br>
tradename EMCOCEL® from Edward Mendell Co., Inc. and as Avicel® from<br>
FMC Corp. Compared to other directly compressible excipients, microcrystalline<br>
cellulose is generally considered to exhibit superior compressibility and disin-<br>
tegration properties.<br>
Another limitation of direct compression as a method of tablet manufacture<br>
is the size of the tablet. If the amount of active ingredient is high, a pharmaceutical<br>
formulator may choose to wet granulate the active with other excipients to attain an<br>
acceptably sized tablet with the desired compact strength. Usually the amount of<br>
filler/binder or excipients needed in wet granulation is less than that required for<br>
direct compression since the process of wet granulation contributes to some extent<br>
toward the desired physical properties of a tablet. Thus, despite the advantages of<br>
direct compression (such as reduced processing times and costs), wet granulation is<br>
widely used in the industry in the preparation of solid dosage forms. Many of those<br>
skilled in the art prefer wet granulation as compared to direct compression because<br>
this method has a greater probability of overcoming any problems associated with<br>
the physical characteristics of the various ingredients in the formulation, thereby<br>
providing a material which has the requisite flow and cohesive characteristics<br>
necessary to obtain an acceptable solid dosage form.<br>
The popularity of the wet granulation process as compared to the direct<br>
compression process is based on at least three advantages. First, wet granulation<br>
provides the material to be compressed with better wetting properties, particularly<br>
in the case of hydrophobic drug substances. The addition of a hydrophilic excipient<br>
makes the surface of a hydrophobic drug more hydrophilic, easing disintegration<br>
and dissolution. Second, the content uniformity of the solid dosage forms is<br>
generally improved. Via the wet granulation method, all of the granules thereby<br>
obtained should contain approximately the same amount of drug. Thus, segregation<br>
of the different ingredients of the material to be compressed (due to different<br>
physical characteristics such as density) is avoided. Segregation is a potential<br>
problem with the direct compression method. Finally, the particle size and shape of<br>
the particles comprising the granulate to be compressed are optimized via the wet<br>
granulation process. This is due to the fact that when a dry solid is v/et granulated,<br>
the binder "glues" particles together, so that they agglomerate in the granules which<br>
are more or less spherical.<br>
Due to the popularity of microcrystalline cellulose, pharmaceutical<br>
formulators have deemed it desirable to include this excipient in a formulation<br>
which is wet granulated prior to tabletting. Unfortunately, currently-available<br>
microcrystalline cellulose does not hold to the typical principle that the amount of<br>
filler/binder needed in wet granulation is less than that in direct compression. It is<br>
known that the exposure of the microcrystalline cellulose to moisture in the wet<br>
granulation process severely reduces the compressibility of this excipient. The loss<br>
of compressibility of microcrystalline cellulose is particularly problematic where the<br>
formulation dictates that the final product will be relatively large in the environment<br>
of use. For example, if a pharmaceutical formulator desires to prepare a solid oral<br>
dosage form of a high dose drug, and the use of the wet granulation technique is<br>
deemed necessary, the loss of compressibility of the microcrystalline cellulose<br>
dictates that a larger amount of this material may be needed to obtain an acceptably<br>
compressed final product. The additional amount of microcrystalline cellulose<br>
needed adds cost to the preparation, but more importantly adds bulk, making the<br>
product more difficult to swallow.<br>
The loss of compressibility of microcrystalline cellulose when exposed to<br>
wet granulation has long been considered a problem in the art for which there has<br>
been no satisfactory solution.<br>
Attempts have been made to provide an excipient having high<br>
compressibility, a small bulk (high apparent density), and good flowability, while<br>
being capable of providing satisfactory disintegration of the solid dosage form,<br>
which is applicable to wet granulation as well as to dry granulation and direct<br>
compression methods for preparation of solid dosage forms.<br>
For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,159,345 (Takeo, et al.) describes an<br>
excipient which consists essentially of a microcrystalline cellulose having an average<br>
degree of polymerization of 60 to 375 and obtained through acid hydrolysis or<br>
alkaline oxidative degradation of a cellulosic substance selected from linters, pulps<br>
and regenerated fibers. The microcrystalline cellulose is said to be a white cellulosic<br>
powder having an apparent specific volume of 1.6-3.1 cc/g, a repose angle of 35°<br>
to 42°, a 200-mesh sieve residue of 2 to 80% by weight and a tapping apparent<br>
specific volume of at least 1.4 cc/g.<br>
In U.S. Patent No. 4,744,987 (Mehra, et al.), a paticulate co-processed<br>
microcrystalline cellulose and calcium carbonate composition is described wherein<br>
the respective components are present in a weight ratio of 75:25 to 35:65. The co-<br>
processed composition is said to be prepared by forming a well-dispersed aqueous<br>
slurry of microcrystalline cellulose and calcium carbonate and then drying the slurry<br>
to yield a paniculate product. The combination of these two ingredients is said to<br>
provide a lower cost excipient which has tabletting characteristics similar to those<br>
of microcrystalline cellulose and which would satisfy a need for an economical<br>
excipient with good performance that is desired by the vitamin market.<br>
European Patent Application EP 0609976A1 (assigned to Asahi Kasei<br>
Kabushiki Kaisha) describes an excipient comprising white powdery<br>
microcrystalline cellulose having an average degree of polymerization of from 100<br>
to 375, preferably from 190 to 210, and an acetic acid holding capacity of 280% or<br>
more, preferably from 290 to 370%. The excipient is said to exhibit high<br>
compactability and a high rate of disintegration and is said to be obtained by heat-<br>
treating an aqueous dispersion of purified cellulose particles, which has a solids<br>
content of 40% or less by weight, at 100° C or more, followed by drying, or by sub-<br>
jecting an aqueous dispersion of purified cellulose particles having a solids content<br>
of 23% or less by weight to thin film-forming treatment and drying the resultant thin<br>
film. The excipient is said to possess a high compressibility, and a good balance of<br>
compactability and rate of disintegration.<br>
There still remains a need in the industry for a pharmaceutical excipient<br>
which possesses excellent compressibility whether utilized in a direct compression<br>
or wet granulation procedure.<br>
OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an excipient which is<br>
useful in a variety of applications, and which may be utilized in direct compression<br>
or wet granulation methods.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide an excipient useful<br>
in direct compression methods which has improved compressibility relative to<br>
microcrystalline cellulose.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide an excipient useful<br>
in wet granulation methods which has improved compressibility relative to<br>
microcrystalline cellulose.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a free-flowing<br>
excipient which has excellent compressibility properties when utilized in direct com-<br>
pression or wet granulation methods, and which furthermore possesses pharma-<br>
ceutically acceptable disintegration properties.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide an improved<br>
microcrystalline cellulose excipient in which the microcrystalline cellulose has not<br>
been chemically altered, and which has improved compressibility relative to "off-<br>
the-shelf" commercially available microcrystalline cellulose.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a solid dosage form<br>
which includes one or more active ingredients and the improved microcrystalline<br>
cellulose excipient of the present invention.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide an oral solid dosage<br>
form for one or more drugs which is economical to manufacture, which maintains<br>
its integrity during storage, and which possesses excellent disintegration and<br>
dissolution properties when exposed, e.g., to gastrointestinal fluid.<br>
In accordance with the above objects and others which will be obvious to<br>
those skilled in the art, the present invention is directed to an excipient comprising a<br>
particulate agglomerate of coprocessed microcrystalline cellulose and a surfactant.<br>
Preferably, the surfactant is an ionic surfactant and most preferably, the surfactant is<br>
an anionic surfactant.<br>
The amount of surfactant coprocessed with the microcrystalline cellulose is<br>
dependent, in part, upon the type of surfactant selected. For purposes of the<br>
present invention, the amount is generally described as an effective amount, i.e. an<br>
amount which enhances or augments the compressibility of the microcrystalline<br>
cellulose. One particularly preferred surfactant is the anionic surfactant sodium<br>
lauryl sulfate (SLS). This surfactant is present in an amount of from about 0.1% to<br>
about 0.5% by weight of the microcrystalline cellulose. Preferably, however, the<br>
surfactant is present in amounts of from about 0.15 to about 0.4% and most<br>
preferably, in amounts ranging from about 0.2 to about 0.3% by weight.<br>
The microcrystalline cellulose and surfactant are in intimate association with<br>
each other, and the surfactant portion of the agglomerate is in the form of an<br>
aqueous solution prior to being coprocessed with microcrystalline cellulose.<br>
The present invention is further directed to an aqueous slurry useful in the<br>
preparation of a compressible excipient useful in dry and wet granulation<br>
formulation methods, comprising a mixture of microcrystalline cellulose and from<br>
about 0.1% to about 0.5% of a surfactant such as sodium lauryl sulfate, by weight<br>
relative to the microcrystalline cellulose. The solids content of the aqueous slurry is<br>
from about 0.5% to about 25%, by weight, preferably from about 15% to about<br>
20% by weight, and most preferably from about 17% to about 19% by weight.<br>
The present invention is further directed to a mixture of an active<br>
ingredient(s) and an excipient comprising a particulate agglomerate of coprocessed<br>
microcrystalline cellulose and a surfactant, the surfactant being present in an<br>
amount of from about 0.1% to about 0.5% by weight based on the weight of the<br>
microcrystalline cellulose. The microcrystalline cellulose and surfactant are in<br>
intimate association with each other and the ratio of active ingredient to excipient is<br>
from about 1:99 to about 99:1, by weight.<br>
The present invention is further directed to a granulate of an active<br>
ingredient(s) and the novel excipient described herein, wherein the active<br>
ingredient(s) and excipient have been subjected to a wet granulation procedure.<br>
The present invention is also directed to a compressed solid dosage form<br>
comprising an active ingredient(s) and the novel excipient described herein, wherein<br>
the active ingredient(s) and excipient have been directly compressed into the solid<br>
dosage form or have been subjected to a wet granulation procedure and thereafter<br>
compressed into the solid dosage form. The compressed solid dosage form<br>
provides a suitable immediate release dissolution profile of the active ingredient(s)<br>
when exposed to aqueous solutions during in-vitro dissolution testing, and provides<br>
a release of drug in an environment of use which is considered bioavailable. In<br>
further embodiments of the invention, the dissolution profile of the solid dosage<br>
form is modified to provide a controlled or sustained release dissolution profile.<br>
The present invention is further directed to a method of maintaining and/or<br>
enhancing the compressibility of microcrystalline cellulose. The method includes<br>
forming an aqueous slurry containing a mixture of microcrystalline cellulose and a<br>
surfactant, and drying the slurry to obtain microcrystalline cellulose-based excipient<br>
particles in which the surfactant has been integrated with the microcrystalline<br>
cellulose particles. Within this aspect of the invention, the slurry contains from<br>
about 0.5% to about 25% by weight microcrystalline cellulose, with amounts of<br>
from about 15% to about 20% being preferred. Furthermore, the surfactant<br>
included in the slurry is preferably an anionic surfactant such as SLS and is present<br>
in amounts ranging from about 0.1% to about 0.5% by weight of the MCC.<br>
The novel excipient described herein is free-flowing, possesses excellent<br>
disintegration properties, and importantly, in certain embodiments possesses<br>
improved compressibility relative to normal "off-the-shelf" commercially available<br>
microcrystalline cellulose when directly compressed. The advantages of the novel<br>
excipient described herein are especially realized in pharmaceutical formulations<br>
prepared using wet granulation techniques. When utilized in wet granulation<br>
techniques, the novel excipient surprisingly provides a compressibility which is<br>
substantially improved in preferred embodiments in comparison to the compress-<br>
ibility of normal "off-the-shelf commercially available microcrystalline cellulose<br>
used in wet granulation and is even comparable to "off-the-shelf microcrystalline<br>
cellulose used in direct compression techniques. In other embodiments, the novel<br>
excipient surprisingly provides a compressibility which is substantially superior to<br>
the compressibility of normal "off-the-shelf commercially available microcrystalline<br>
cellulose used in direct compression techniques.<br>
The term "environmental fluid" is meant for purposes of the invention to<br>
encompass, e.g., an aqueous solution, or gastrointestinal fluid.<br>
By "sustained release" it is meant for purposes of the invention that the<br>
therapeutically active medicament is released from the formulation at a controlled<br>
rate such that therapeutically beneficial blood levels (but below toxic levels) of the<br>
medicament are maintained over an extended period of time, e.g., providing a 12<br>
hour or a 24 hour dosage form.<br>
By "bioavailable" it is meant for purposes of the invention that the<br>
therapeutically active medicament is absorbed from the sustained release<br>
formulation and becomes available in the body at the intended site of drug action.<br>
By "surfactant" it is meant for purposes of the present invention that the<br>
material is a surface active agent which displays wetting, detergent or soap-like<br>
qualities as those agents are understood by those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Microcrystalline cellulose is a well-known tablet diluent, binder and<br>
disintegrant. Its chief advantage over other excipients is that it can be directly<br>
compressed into self-binding tablets which disintegrate rapidly when placed into<br>
water. This widely-used ingredient is prepared by partially depolymerizing cellulose<br>
obtained as a pulp from fibrous plant material with dilute mineral acid solutions.<br>
Following hydrolysis, the hydrocellulose thereby obtained is purified via filtration<br>
and an aqueous slurry is spray dried to form dry, white odorless, tasteless crystalline<br>
powder of porous particles of various sizes. Another method of preparing<br>
microcrystalline cellulose is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,141,875. This reference<br>
discloses subjecting cellulose to the hydrolytic action of hydrochloric acid at boiling<br>
temperatures so that amorphous cellulosic material can be removed and aggregates<br>
of crystalline cellulose are formed. The aggregates are collected by filtration,<br>
washed with water and aqueous ammonia and disintegrated into small fragments,<br>
often called cellulose crystallites by vigorous mechanical means such as a blender.<br>
Microcrystalline cellulose is commercially available in several grades which range in<br>
average particle size from 20 to 200 microns.<br>
Microcrystalline cellulose is water-insoluble, but the material has the ability<br>
to draw fluid into a tablet by capillary action. The tablets then swell on contact and<br>
the microcrystalline cellulose thus acts as a disintegrating agent. The material has<br>
sufficient self-lubricating qualities so as to allow a lower level of lubricant as<br>
compared to other excipients.<br>
Typically, microcrystalline cellulose has an apparent density of about 0.28<br>
g/cm3 and a tap density of about 0.43 g/cm3. Handbook of Pharmaceutical<br>
Excipients. pages 53-55.<br>
When utilized in pharmaceutical applications, microcrystalline cellulose is<br>
typically used as a tablet binder/diluent in wet granulation and direct compression<br>
formulations in amounts of 3-30% of the formulation, or more. However, it is<br>
known to use more or less microcrystalline cellulose in pharmaceutical products,<br>
depending upon the requirements of the formulation.<br>
The surfactants which may be used in the present invention generally include<br>
all pharmaceutically-acceptable surfactants. Preferably, however, the surfactant is<br>
an ionic surfactant and most preferably, the surfactant is an anionic surfactant.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable anionic surfactants include, for example, those<br>
containing carboxylate, sulfonate, and sulfate ions. Those containing carboxylate<br>
ions are sometimes referred to as soaps and are generally prepared by saponification<br>
of natural fatty acid glycerides in alkaline solutions. The most common cations<br>
associated with these surfactants are sodium, potassium, ammonium and<br>
triethanolamine. The chain length of the fatty acids range from 12 to 18. Although<br>
a large number of alkyl sulfates are available as surfactants, one particularly<br>
preferred surfactant is sodium lauryl sulfate.<br>
In the pharmaceutical arts, sodium lauryl sulfate has been used as an<br>
emulsifying agent in amounts of up to about 0.1% by weight of the formulation. It<br>
is not believed that surfactants such as SLS have been included in coprocessed<br>
MCC compositions. Moreover, it is not believed that surfactants have been used in<br>
the amounts described herein to improve the compressibility of MCC especially in<br>
wet granulations.<br>
Sodium lauryl sulfate is a water-soluble salt, produced as a white or cream<br>
powder, crystals, or flakes and is used as a wetting agent and detergent. Also<br>
known as dodecyl sodium sulfate, SLS is actually a mixture of sodium alkyl sulfates<br>
consisting chiefly of sodium lauryl sulfate. Sodium lauryl sulfate is also known as<br>
sulfuric acid monododecyl ester sodium salt. Furthermore, sodium lauryl sulfate is<br>
readily available from commercial sources such as Sigma or Aldrich in both solid<br>
form and as a solution. The solubility of SLS is about 1 gm per 10 ml/water.<br>
The fatty acids of coconut oil, consisting chiefly of lauric acid, are<br>
catalytically hydrogenated to form the corresponding alcohols. The alcohols are<br>
then esterified with sulfuric acid (sulfated) and the resulting mixture of alkyl<br>
bisulfates (alkyl sulfuric acids) is converted into sodium salts by reacting with alkali<br>
under controlled conditions of pH.<br>
Alternative anionic surfactants include docusate salts such as the sodium salt<br>
thereof. Other suitable anionic surfactants include, without limitation, alkyl<br>
carboxylates, acyl lactylates, alkyl ether carboxylates, N-acyl sarcosinates,<br>
polyvalent alkyl carbonates, N-acyl glutamates, fatty acid, polypeptide condensates<br>
and sulfuric acid esters.<br>
In other aspects of the invention amphoteric (amphipathic/amphiphilic<br>
surfactants), non-ionic surfactants and/or cationic surfactants are included in the<br>
coprocessed compositions of the invention. These alternative surfactants can be<br>
included to replace some or even all of the preferred anionic surfactant. It is<br>
preferred, however, that the surfactant comprise an anionic surfactant.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable non-ionic surfactants such as, for<br>
example, polyoxyethylene compounds, lecithin, ethoxylated alcohols, ethoxylated<br>
esters, ethoxylated amides, polyoxypropylene compounds, propoxylated alcohols,<br>
ethoxylated/propoxylated block polymers, propoxylated esters, alkanolamides,<br>
amine oxides, fatty acid esters of polyhydric alcohols, ethylene glycol esters,<br>
diethylene glycol esters, propylene glycol esters, glycerol esters, polyglycerol fatty<br>
acid esters, SPAN'S (e.g., sorbitan esters), TWEEN's (i.e., sucrose esters), glucose<br>
(dextrose) esters and simethicone.<br>
Other suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable surfactants include acacia,<br>
benzalkonium chloride, cholesterol, emulsifying wax, glycerol monostearate, lanolin<br>
alcohols, lecithin, poloxamer, polyoxyethylene, and castor oil derivatives.<br>
Those skilled in the art will further appreciate that the name and/or method<br>
of preparation of the surfactant utilized in the present invention is not determinative<br>
of the usefulness of the product. Rather, as previously mentioned, it has been<br>
surprisingly discovered that it is the physical characteristics of surfactants, especially<br>
those of the anionic class such as sodium lauryl sulfate, which are critical. In<br>
particular, it has been discovered that when an anionic surfactant such as SLS is<br>
coprocessed with microcrystalline cellulose in the amounts described herein,<br>
improved microcrystalline cellulose products of the invention result.<br>
When the novel excipient of the invention utilizes an anionic surfactant, it<br>
has been found that the resultant excipient product surprisingly provides a com-<br>
pressibility which is substantially improved in preferred embodiments even in<br>
comparison to the compressibility of normal "off-the-shelf commercially available<br>
microcrystalline cellulose used in direct compression techniques.<br>
In other embodiments of the present invention, it has been discovered that<br>
the compressibility of microcrystalline cellulose which is wet granulated is<br>
significantly improved by coprocessing the MCC with an anionic surfactant such as<br>
sodium lauryl sulfate.<br>
Since microcrystalline cellulose is substantially water insoluble, the particle<br>
size of this ingredient in the well-dispersed aqueous slurry is directly related to its<br>
particle size as it was introduced into the aqueous solution. Most surfactants, on<br>
the other hand, tend to be water soluble. Sodium lauryl sulfate, for example, is<br>
relatively soluble in water (1 g/10ml) and, therefore, dissolves in the aqueous slurry.<br>
It should be understood, however, that the coprocessed products of the present<br>
invention are not solely limited to those which contain a dissolved surfactant. The<br>
contemplated compositions can also be prepared from slurries which contain a<br>
dispersion of the surfactant as well as the MCC.<br>
After a uniform mixture of the ingredients is obtained in the suspension, the<br>
suspension is dried to provide a plurality of microcrystalline cellulose-based<br>
excipient particles having enhanced compressibility.<br>
In the spray-drying process, the aqueous dispersion of microcrystalline<br>
cellulose and surfactant is brought together with a sufficient volume of hot air to<br>
produce evaporation and drying of the liquid droplets. The highly dispersed slurry<br>
of microcrystalline cellulose and surfactant is pumpable and capable of being<br>
atomized. It is sprayed into a current of warm filtered air, which supplies the heat<br>
for evaporation and conveys a dried product to a collecting device. The air is then<br>
exhausted with the removed moisture. The resultant spray-dried powder particles<br>
are approximately spherical in shape and are relatively uniform in size, thereby<br>
possessing excellent flowability. The coprocessed product consists of<br>
microcrystalline cellulose and surfactant in intimate association with each other.<br>
The exact relationship of the two ingredients of the excipients after coprocessing is<br>
not presently understood; however, for purposes of description the coprocessed<br>
particles are described herein as including an agglomerate of microcrystalline<br>
cellulose and surfactant in intimate association with each other. By "intimate<br>
association", it is meant that the surfactant has in some manner been integrated with<br>
the microcrystalline cellulose particles, e.g., via a partial coating of the<br>
microcrystalline particles, as opposed to a chemical interaction of the two<br>
ingredients. The term "intimate association" is therefore deemed for purposes of the<br>
present description as being synonymous with "integrated" or "united". The<br>
coprocessed particles are not necessarily uniform or homogeneous.<br>
It is most preferred in the present invention that the microcrystalline<br>
cellulose and SLS are coprocessed, resulting in an intimate association of these in-<br>
gredients, rather than being combined, e.g., as a dry mixture. In preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention, the aqueous slurry of the microcrystalline<br>
cellulose and surfactant are introduced into the spray dryer as a single aqueous<br>
medium. However, it is possible to separately introduce each ingredient into<br>
separate aqueous media which are then combined. Other procedures for combining<br>
the microcrystalline cellulose and surfactant known to those skilled in the art are<br>
deemed to be equivalent to the spray-drying technique described above, and are<br>
further deemed to be encompassed by the appended claims.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments of the present invention, the coprocessing<br>
of the microcrystalline cellulose and SLS is accomplished by forming a well-<br>
dispersed aqueous slurry of microcrystalline cellulose in which the SLS has been<br>
dissolved, and thereafter drying the slurry and forming a plurality of microcrystalline<br>
cellulose-based excipient particles. Typically, microcrystalline cellulose is first<br>
added to an aqueous solution so that a slurry or suspension containing from about<br>
0.5% to about 25% microcrystalline cellulose in the form of solids is obtained.<br>
Preferably, the slurry or suspension contains from about 15% to 20% microcrys-<br>
talline cellulose and most preferably from about 17% to about 19% microcrystalline<br>
cellulose. At this stage, it is often desirable to adjust the pH of the slurry to about<br>
neutral with ammonium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, and mixtures thereof or the<br>
like. The suspension is kept under constant agitation for a sufficient time to assure<br>
a uniform distribution of the solids prior to being combined with the SLS.<br>
At this point, the SLS is added to the suspension or slurry in amounts<br>
ranging from 0.1% to about 0.5% by weight, based on the amount of<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, amounts from about 0.15% to about 0.4% are preferred<br>
while amounts of from about 0.2% to about 0.3% by weight are especially<br>
preferred. The SLS can be added to the suspension as either a solid or in solution<br>
form. The microcrystalline cellulose is thus well-dispersed in the slurry or<br>
suspension and the surfactant is dissolved therein prior drying and forming the novel<br>
particles. It will be understood that other useful surfactants can be used in like<br>
amounts or even greater amounts, i.e. up to 5% by weight or even more. The<br>
usable concentration range for the selected surfactant depends in part upon not<br>
only its molecular weight but also its degree of foaming, particularly when present<br>
in agitated slurries which will be spray dried to form the desired particulate. Thus,<br>
in those aspects of the invention where surfactants other than SLS are coprocessed<br>
with the microcrystalline cellulose, it is to be understood that the surfactant will be<br>
present in an amount which enhances the compressibility of the MCC and yet does<br>
not have a degree of foaming which would substantially inhibit spray drying.<br>
It is preferred that the suspension be dried using spray-drying techniques, as<br>
they are known in the art. Other drying techniques, however, such as flash drying,<br>
ring drying, micron drying, tray drying, vacuum drying, radio-frequency drying, and<br>
possibly microwave drying, can also be used. The exact manner in which the<br>
suspension is dried is not believed to be critical for the microcrystalline<br>
cellulose/SLS particles to demonstrate enhanced compressibility after wet<br>
granulating.<br>
Depending upon the amount and type of drying, the concentration of the<br>
microcrystalline cellulose and SLS in the suspension, the novel compressible<br>
particles will have different particle sizes, densities, pH, moisture content, etc.<br>
The particulate coprocessed product of the present invention possesses<br>
desirable performance attributes that are not present when the combination of<br>
microcrystalline cellulose and SLS and optionally present other surfactants are<br>
combined as a dry mixture. It is believed that the beneficial result obtained by the<br>
combination of these two materials is due to the fact that the two materials are<br>
intimately associated with each other. It has also been found that intimate<br>
association of MCC and other detergent-like materials such as simethicone, even<br>
when they are dissolved/dispersed in the aqueous solutions which form the MCC<br>
slurry, fail to provide MCC with enhanced compressibility.<br>
The average particle size of the integrated excipient of the present invention<br>
ranges from about 10 microns to about 1000 microns. Particle sizes of about 10-<br>
500 microns are preferred, particle sizes of about 30-250 microns are more<br>
preferred and particle sizes of about 40-200 microns are most preferred. It will be<br>
appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the drying of the micro-<br>
crystalline cellulose-SLS suspension results in a random size distribution of the<br>
novel excipient particles being produced. For example if spray drying techniques<br>
are used, droplet size, temperatures, agitation, dispersion, air flow, atomizer wheel<br>
speed, etc. will effect final particle size. Furthermore, it is within the scope of the<br>
invention to sort or mechanically alter the dried particles according to ranges of<br>
particle sizes depending upon end uses. The particle size of the integrated excipient<br>
is not narrowly critical, the important parameter being that the average size of the<br>
particle must permit the formation of a directly compressible excipient which forms<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable tablets.<br>
The novel excipient has a bulk (loose) density ranging from about 0.2 g/ml<br>
to about 0.5 g/ml, and most preferably from about 0.22 g/ml to about 0.35 g/ml.<br>
The novel excipient has a tapped density ranging from about 0.30 g/ml to about<br>
0.70 g/ml, and most preferably from about 0.35 g/ml to about 0.60 g/ml. The pH of<br>
the particles is most preferably about neutral, although granulates having a pH of<br>
from about 3.0 to about 8.5 are possible. The moisture content of the excipient<br>
particles will broadly range from about 0.5% to about 15%, preferably from about<br>
2.5% to about 6%, and most preferably from about 3.0% to about 5% by weight.<br>
The novel excipient of the invention is free-flowing and directly<br>
compressible. Accordingly, the excipient may be mixed in the desired proportion<br>
with an active agent and optional lubricant (dry granulation), and then directly<br>
compressed into solid dosage forms. In preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention wherein the surfactant is sodium lauryl sulfate, the novel excipient<br>
comprising the coprocessed microcrystalline cellulose and SLS integrated together<br>
represents an augmented microcrystalline cellulose having improved compressibility<br>
as compared to standard commercially available grades of microcrystalline cellulose.<br>
Alternatively, all or part of the excipient may be subjected to a wet<br>
granulation with the active ingredient. A representative wet granulation includes<br>
loading the novel excipient particles into a suitable granulator, such as those<br>
available from Baker-Perkins, and granulating the particles together with the active<br>
ingredient, preferably using an aqueous granulating liquid. The granulating liquid is<br>
added to the mixture with stirring until the powdery mass has the consistency of<br>
damp snow and then wet screened through a desired mesh screen, for example,<br>
having a mesh from about 12 to about 16. The screened granulate is then dried,<br>
using standard drying apparatus such as a convection oven before undergoing a<br>
final screening. Additional dry screening of this material is possible, such as by<br>
using screens of from about 40 to about 200 mesh. Those materials flowing<br>
through 40 and 60 mesh screens may be further ground prior to ultimate tablet<br>
formulation. The thus obtained granulate containing the novel excipient is now<br>
capable of undergoing tabletting or otherwise placed into a unit dosage form.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments, a portion of the total amount of the novel<br>
excipient is wet granulated with the active ingredient, and thereafter the additional<br>
portion of the novel excipient is added to the granulate. In yet other embodiments,<br>
the additional portion of the novel excipient to be added to the excipient/active<br>
ingredient granulate may be substituted with conventional microcrystalline cellulose,<br>
or other excipients commonly used by those skilled in the art, depending of course<br>
upon the requirements of the particular formulation.<br>
By virtue of the novel excipient of the present invention, the amount of the<br>
novel excipient compared to the amount of microcrystalline cellulose which must be<br>
used in a wet granulation technique to obtain an acceptable solid dosage form is<br>
substantially reduced.<br>
In other embodiments of the invention, a further material is added to the<br>
slurry of microcrystalline cellulose and SLS. Such additional materials include<br>
silicon dioxides, non-silicon metal oxides, starches, starch derivatives, surfactants,<br>
polyalkylene oxides, cellulose ethers, celluloses esters and mixtures thereof. These<br>
additives may be included in desired amounts which will be apparent to those skilled<br>
in the art.<br>
In one preferred aspect of the invention, however, there are provided<br>
MCC-based compositions which contain not only a surfactant but also from about<br>
0.1 to about 20% by weight silicon dioxide. The silicon dioxide utilized in this<br>
aspect of the invention is preferably of the very fine particle size variety. In the<br>
most preferred embodiments of the invention, the silicon dioxide utilized is a<br>
colloidal silicon dioxide. Colloidal silicon dioxide is a submicron fumed silica<br>
prepared by the vapor-phase hydrolysis (e.g., at 1110° C) of a silicon compound,<br>
such as silicon tetrachloride. The product itself is a submicron, fluffy, light, loose,<br>
bluish-white, odorless and tasteless amorphous powder which is commercially<br>
available from a number of sources, including Cabot Corporation (under the<br>
tradename Cab-O-Sil); Degussa, Inc. (under the tradename Aerosil); E.I. DuPont &amp;<br>
Co.; and W.R. Grace &amp; Co. Colloidal silicon dioxide is also known as colloidal<br>
silica, fumed silica, light anhydrous silicic acid, silicic anhydride, and silicon dioxide<br>
fumed, among others. A variety of commercial grades of colloidal silicon dioxide<br>
are produced by varying the manufacturing process. These modifications do not<br>
affect the silica content, specific gravity, refractive index, color or amorphous form.<br>
However, these modifications are known to change the particle size, surface areas,<br>
and bulk densities of the colloidal silicon dioxide products.<br>
The surface area of the preferred class of silicon dioxides utilized in the<br>
invention ranges from about 50 m2/gm to about 500 m2/gm. The average primary<br>
particle diameter of the preferred class of silicon dioxides utilized in the invention<br>
ranges from about 5 nm to about 50 nm. However, in commercial colloidal silicon<br>
dioxide products, these particles are agglomerated or aggregated to varying extents.<br>
The bulk density of the preferred class of silicon dioxides utilized in the invention<br>
ranges from about 20 g/l to about 100 g/l.<br>
Commercially available colloidal silicon dioxide products have, for example,<br>
a BET surface area ranging from about 50 ± 15 m2/gm (Aerosil OX50) to about<br>
400 ± 20 (Cab-O-Sil S-17) or 390 ± 40 m2/gm (Cab-O-Sil EH-5). Commercially<br>
available particle sizes range from a nominal particle diameter of 7 nm (e.g., Cab-O-<br>
Sil S-17 or Cab-O-Sil EH-5) to an average primary particle size of 40 nm (Aerosil<br>
OX50). The density of these products range from 72.0 ± 8 g/1 (Cab-O-Sil S-17) to<br>
36.8 g/1 (e.g., Cab-O-Sil M-5). The pH of the these products at 4% aqueous dis-<br>
persion ranges from pH 3.5-4.5. These commercially available products are<br>
described for exemplification purposes of acceptable properties of the preferred<br>
class of silicon dioxides only, and this description is not meant to limit the scope of<br>
the invention in any manner whatsoever. Thus, in embodiments of the present<br>
invention where an improvement in overall compressibility of the microcrystalline<br>
cellulose (whether utilized in wet granulation or dry granulation) is important, and<br>
the microcrystalline cellulose product is to be subjected to wet granulation, it has<br>
been discovered that coprocessing the MCC with SLS can provide improvements in<br>
compressibility.<br>
In addition to one or more active ingredients, additional pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients (in the case of Pharmaceuticals) or other additives known to<br>
those skilled in the art (for non-pharmaceutical applications) can be added to the<br>
novel excipient prior to preparation of the final product. For example, if desired,<br>
any generally accepted soluble or insoluble inert pharmaceutical filler (diluent)<br>
material can be included in the final product (e.g., a solid dosage form). Preferably,<br>
the inert pharmaceutical filler comprises a monosaccharide, a disaccharide, a<br>
polyhydric alcohol, inorganic phosphates, sulfates or carbonates, and/or mixtures<br>
thereof. Examples of suitable inert pharmaceutical fillers include sucrose, dextrose,<br>
lactose, xylitol, fructose, sorbitol, calcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, calcium<br>
carbonate, "off-the-shelf" macrocrystalline cellulose, mixtures thereof, and the like.<br>
An effective amount of any generally accepted pharmaceutical lubricant,<br>
including the calcium or magnesium soaps may optionally be added to the novel<br>
excipient at the time the medicament is added, or in any event prior to compression<br>
into a solid dosage form. The lubricant may comprise, for example, magnesium<br>
stearate in any amount of about 0.5-3% by weight of the solid dosage form.<br>
The complete mixture, in an amount sufficient to make a uniform batch of<br>
tablets, may then subjected to tabletting in a conventional production scale<br>
tabletting machine at normal compression pressures for that machine, e.g., about<br>
1500-10,000 lbs/sq in. The mixture should not be compressed to such a degree that<br>
there is subsequent difficulty in its hydration when exposed to gastric fluid.<br>
The average tablet size for round tablets is preferably about 50 mg to 500<br>
mg and for capsule-shaped tablets about 200 mg to 2000 mg. However, other<br>
formulations prepared in accordance with the present invention may be suitably<br>
shaped for other uses or locations, such as other body cavities, e.g., periodontal<br>
pockets, surgical wounds, vaginally. It is contemplated that for certain uses, e.g.,<br>
antacid tablets, vaginal tablets and possibly implants, that the tablet will be larger.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, the tablet is coated with a sufficient<br>
amount of a hydrophobic polymer to render the formulation capable of providing a<br>
release of the medicament such that a 12 or 24 hour formulation is obtained. The<br>
hydrophobic polymer which included in the tablet coating may be the same or<br>
different material as compared to the hydrophobic polymeric material which is<br>
optionally granulated with the sustained release excipient. In other embodiments of<br>
the present invention, the tablet coating may comprise an enteric coating material in<br>
addition to or instead or the hydrophobic polymer coating. Examples of suitable<br>
enteric polymers include cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose<br>
phthalate, polyvinylacetate phthalate, methacrylic acid copolymer, shellac,<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose succinate, cellulose acetate trimellitate, and mixtures<br>
of any of the foregoing. An example of a suitable commercially available enteric<br>
material is available under the trade name Eudragit™ L 100-555.<br>
In further embodiments, the dosage form may be coated with a hydrophilic<br>
coating in addition to or instead of the above-mentioned coatings. An example of a<br>
suitable material which may be used for such a hydrophilic coating is hydroxy-<br>
propylmethylcellulose (e.g., Opadry®, commercially available from Colorcon, West<br>
Point, Pennsylvania).<br>
The coatings may be applied in any pharmaceutically acceptable manner<br>
known to those skilled in the art. For example, in one embodiment, the coating is<br>
applied via a fluidized bed or in a coating pan. For example, the coated tablets may<br>
be dried, e.g., at about 60-70° C for about 3-4 hours in a coating pan. The solvent<br>
for the hydrophobic polymer or enteric coating may be organic, aqueous, or a<br>
mixture of an organic and an aqueous solvent. The organic solvents may be, e.g.,<br>
isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, and the like, with or without water.<br>
The coatings which may be optionally applied to the compressed solid<br>
dosage form of the invention may comprise from about 0.5% to about 30% by<br>
weight of the final solid dosage form.<br>
In additional embodiments of the present invention, a support platform is<br>
applied to the tablets manufactured in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Suitable support platforms are well known to those skilled in the art. An example<br>
of suitable support platforms is set forth, e.g., in U.S. Patent No. 4,839,177, hereby<br>
incorporated by reference. In that patent, the support platform partially coats the<br>
tablet, and consists of a polymeric material insoluble in aqueous liquids. The<br>
support platform may, for example, be designed to maintain its impermeability<br>
characteristics during the transfer of the therapeutically active medicament. The<br>
support platform may be applied to the tablets, e.g., via compression coating onto<br>
part of the tablet surface, by spray coating the polymeric materials comprising the<br>
support platform onto all or part of the tablet surface, or by immersing the tablets in<br>
a solution of the polymeric materials.<br>
The support platform may have a thickness of, e.g., about 2 mm if applied<br>
by compression, and about 10 urn if applied via spray-coating or immersion-<br>
coating. Generally, in embodiments of the invention wherein a hydrophobic<br>
polymer or enteric coating is applied to the tablets, the tablets are coated to a<br>
weight gain from about 1% to about 20%, and in certain embodiments preferably<br>
from about 5% to about 10%.<br>
Materials useful in the hydrophobic coatings and support platforms of the<br>
present invention include derivatives of acrylic acid (such as esters of acrylic acid,<br>
methacrylic acid, and copolymers thereof) celluloses and derivatives thereof (such<br>
as ethylcellulose), polyvinyl alcohols, and the like.<br>
In certain embodiments of the present invention, the tablet core includes an<br>
additional dose of the medicament included in either the hydrophobic or enteric<br>
coating, or in an additional overcoating coated on the outer surface of the tablet<br>
core (without the hydrophobic or enteric coating) or as a second coating layer<br>
coated on the surface of the base coating comprising the hydrophobic or enteric<br>
coating material. This may be desired when, for example, a loading dose of a<br>
therapeutically active agent is needed to provide therapeutically effective blood<br>
levels of the active agent when the formulation is first exposed to gastric fluid. The<br>
loading dose of medicament included in the coating layer may be, e.g., from about<br>
10% to about 40% of the total amount of medicament included in the formulation.<br>
The active agent(s) which may be incorporated with the novel excipient<br>
described herein into solid dosage forms invention include systemically active thera-<br>
peutic agents, locally active therapeutic agents, disinfecting agents, chemical<br>
impregnants, cleansing agents, deodorants, fragrances, dyes, animal repellents,<br>
insect repellents, fertilizing agents, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and plant<br>
growth stimulants, and the like.<br>
A wide variety of therapeutically active agents can be used in conjunction<br>
with the present invention. The therapeutically active agents (e.g. pharmaceutical<br>
agents) which may be used in the compositions of the present invention include both<br>
water soluble and water insoluble drugs. Examples of such therapeutically active<br>
agents include antihistamines (e.g., dimenhydrinate, diphenhydramine, chlor-<br>
pheniramine and dexchlorpheniramine maleate), analgesics (e.g., aspirin, codeine,<br>
morphine, dihydromorphone, oxycodone, etc.), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory<br>
agents (e.g., naproxyn, diclofenac, indomethacin, ibuprofen, sulindac), anti-emetics<br>
(e.g., metoclopramide), anti-epileptics (e.g., phenytoin, meprobamate and<br>
nitrazepam), vasodilators (e.g., nifedipine, papaverine, diltiazem and nicardirine),<br>
anti-tussive agents and expectorants (e.g., codeine phosphate), anti-asthmatics (e.g.<br>
theophylline), antacids, anti-spasmodics (e.g. atropine, scopolamine), antidiabetics<br>
(e.g., insulin), diuretics (e.g., ethacrynic acid, bendrofluazide), anti-hypotensives<br>
(e.g., propranolol, clonidine), antihypertensives (e.g., clonidine, methyldopa),<br>
bronchodilators (e.g., albuterol), steroids (e.g., hydrocortisone, triarncinolone,<br>
prednisone), antibiotics (e.g., tetracycline), antihemorrhoidals, hypnotics, psycho-<br>
tropics, antidiarrheals, mucolytics, sedatives, decongestants, laxatives, vitamins,<br>
stimulants (including appetite suppressants such as phenylpropanolamine). The<br>
above list is not meant to be exclusive.<br>
A wide variety of locally active agents can be used in conjunction with the<br>
novel excipient described herein, and include both water soluble and water insoluble<br>
agents. The locally active agent(s) which may be included in the controlled release<br>
formulation of the present invention is intended to exert its effect in the environment<br>
of use, e.g., the oral cavity, although in some instances the active agent may also<br>
have systemic activity via absorption into the blood via the surrounding mucosa.<br>
The locally active agent(s) include antifungal agents (e.g., arnphotericin B,<br>
clotrimazole, nystatin, ketoconazole, miconazol, etc.), antibiotic agents (penicillins,<br>
cephalosporins, erythromycin, tetracycline, aminoglycosides, etc.), antiviral agents<br>
(e.g, acyclovir, idoxuridine, etc.), breath fresheners (e.g. chlorophyll), antitussive<br>
agents (e.g., dextromethorphan hydrochloride), anti-cariogenic compounds (e.g.,<br>
metallic salts of fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate, stannous fluoride, amine<br>
fluorides), analgesic agents (e.g., methylsalicylate, salicylic acid, etc.), local<br>
anesthetics (e.g., benzocaine), oral antiseptics (e.g., chlorhexidine and salts thereof,<br>
hexylresorcinol, dequalinium chloride, cetylpyridinium chloride), anti-inflammatory<br>
agents (e.g., dexamethasone, betamethasone, prednisone, prednisolone, triam-<br>
cinolone, hydrocortisone, etc.), hormonal agents (oestriol), antiplaque agents (e.g,<br>
chlorhexidine and salts thereof, octenidine, and mixtures of thymol, menthol,<br>
methysalicylate, eucalyptol), acidity reducing agents (e.g., buffering agents such as<br>
potassium phosphate dibasic, calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium and<br>
potassium hydroxide, etc.), and tooth desensitizers (e.g., potassium nitrate). This<br>
list is not meant to be exclusive. The solid formulations of the invention may also<br>
include other locally active agents, such as flavorants and sweeteners. Generally<br>
any flavoring or food additive such as those described in Chemicals Used in Food<br>
Processing, pub 1274 by the National Academy of Sciences, pages 63-258 may be<br>
used. Generally, the final product may include from about 0.1% to about 5% by<br>
weight flavorant.<br>
The tablets of the present invention may also contain effective amounts of<br>
coloring agents, (e.g., titanium dioxide, F.D. &amp; C. and D. &amp; C. dyes, see the Kirk-<br>

Alternatively, the novel excipient can be utilized in other applications<br>
wherein it is not compressed. For example, the granulate can be admixed with an<br>
active ingredient and the mixture then filled into capsules. The granulate can further<br>
be molded into shapes other than those typically associated with tablets. For<br>
example, the granulate together with active ingredient can be molded to "fit" into a<br>
particular area in an environment of use (e.g., an implant). All such uses would be<br>
contemplated by those skilled in the art and are deemed to be encompassed within<br>
the scope of the appended claims.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The following examples illustrate various aspects of the present invention.<br>
They are not to be construed to limit the claims in any manner whatsoever.<br>
The examples set forth the preparation of various microcrystalline cellulose/<br>
anionic surfactant compositions. Tablets were prepared using each of the<br>
compositions and each of tablet preparations was tested for tensile strength.<br>
EXAMPLES 1-3<br>
PREPARATION OF COPROCESSED MCC-SLS COMPOSITIONS AND<br>
GRANULATIONS THEREOF<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
MCC-SLS Product - 0.25% w/w SLS<br>
A. EXCIPIENT PARTICLES<br>
In this example, about 6.2 kilograms of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC),<br>
(Mendell Co., Inc. Patterson, NY) in the form of a wet cake was combined with 5.2<br>
kilograms of water in a mix tank to form a slurry containing about 15% solids. The pH<br>
was adjusted to about neutral with about 3 ml of ammonium hydroxide. The slurry<br>
was allowed to mix for about 15 minutes before being combined with 0.25% w/w<br>
sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) powder (available from Spectrum Chemical, Gardena,<br>
CA.) After allowing the materials to become intimately combined, the slurry was spray<br>
dried using aNiro Production Minor (Niro, Columbia, MD), inlet temperature-215°C,<br>
outlet temperature-125 °C, atomizer wheel speed 22,300 rpm, to provide MCC-SLS<br>
having an average particle size of 40-60 microns.<br>
B. GRANULATION OF EXCIPIENT PARTICLES<br>
The MCC-SLS particles obtained as a result of step 1 A. were wet granulated<br>
in a Baker-Perkins 10 liter high-sheer granulator for 3 minutes using water as the<br>
granulating fluid. The resultant product was wet screened through a 12 mesh screen,<br>
tray dried in a convection oven for about 2-3 hours until a moisture content of less than<br>
5% was obtained, dry screened and sieved to obtain an average particle size of from<br>
about 55 to about 70 microns.<br>
EXAMPLES 2-5<br>
MCC-SLS Products<br>
The processes of Example 1A and B were repeated except that 0.5% w/w<br>
sodium lauryl sulfate was used to form the product of Example 2; 0.1% w/w SLS was<br>
used to form the product of Example 3; 0.2% w/w SLS was used to form the product<br>
of Example 4; and 0.3% w/w SLS was used to form the product of Example 5.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Dry blend mix of MCC and SLS (0.25% w/w) - Comparative<br>
As a control, EMCOCEL® grade 50 M microcrystalline cellulose (Mendell<br>
Co., Inc.) and 0.25% w/w SLS powder were dry blended. No spray drying or other<br>
treatment of the mixture was undertaken. The method of Example 1B, however, was<br>
repeated.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Processed MCC without SLS<br>
As a second control, the process described in Example 1B was repeated except<br>
that no SLS was added.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
In this example, batches of compressed tablets were prepared using each of the<br>
products obtained as a result of Examples 1-7. The tablets were prepared using a<br>
Korsch tablet press having a punch size of 3/8" and an aim weight of about 245 mg.<br>
The granulations were included in five separate tabletting runs using compression<br>
forces of 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 kN respectively. Ten tablets from each run were<br>
weighed, measured for diameter and tested for thickness and hardness on the Erweka<br>
TBH 30 tablet hardness tester to determine the compressibility of the microcrystalline<br>
cellulose as measured by tensile strength. The results of the analysis for the products<br>
of Examples 1, 3-7 are graphically illustrated in Figure 1 as a comparison of tensile<br>
strength versus compression force. The results obtained using the product of Example<br>
2 were determined to be comparable to that obtained for the product of Example 3<br>
(0.1% SLS).<br>
As can be seen from the graph, substantial benefits are obtained by<br>
coprocessing MCC with SLS. The tablets prepared using the products of comparative<br>
examples 6 and 7 demonstrated poor tensile strength. The novel excipient is superior<br>
and demonstrates approximately the same relative improvement across the entire range<br>
of compression forces. Furthermore, the graph also illustrates that tablets prepared<br>
with a mere dry admixture of MCC and SLS (Example 6 formulation) failed to<br>
demonstrate acceptable tensile strengths. Thus, the coprocessed MCC-SLS described<br>
herein provides significant retention of MCC compressibility.<br>
EXAMPLES 9-10<br>
DOCUSATE SODIUM<br>
In these examples, the coprocessing method described in Example 1A was<br>
repeated except that docusate sodium (Spectrum Chemical) was used as the<br>
coprocessing agent).<br>
The resultant granulates prepared according to Example 1B were tabletted<br>
according to the same method described in Example 8 and evaluated for tensile<br>
strength. The products of inventive Example 4 (MCC-SLS 0.20%w/w) and Example<br>
7 (MCC alone) were included in Figure 2 for comparison purposes.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2, it can be seen that coprocessing MCC with docusate<br>
sodium also affords the retention of MCC compressibility.<br>
EXAMPLES 11-14<br>
POLYSORBATE 40<br>
In these examples, the coprocessing method described in Example 1A was<br>
repeated using the non-ionic surfactant polysorbate 40 (Spectrum Chemical) as the<br>
coprocessing agent.<br>
The resultant granulates prepared according to Example 1B were tabletted<br>
according to the same method described in Example 8 and evaluated for tensile<br>
strength. The products of inventive Example 4 (MCC-SLS 0.2%w/w) and Example 7<br>
(MCC alone) were included in Figure 3 for comparison purposes.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3, it can be seen that the retention of compressibility<br>
afforded by coprocessing with polysorbate 40 is well below that provided by sodium<br>
lauryl sulfate. In fact, MCC coprocessed with polysorbate 40 demonstrates<br>
compressibility properties about the same as off-the-shelf MCC in wet granulation<br>
formulations.<br>
EXAMPLES 15-18<br>
Simethicone<br>
In these examples, the coprocessing method described in example 1 was<br>
repeated using simethicone (Dow Corning, Midland. MI.) as the surfactant<br>
coprocessing agent.<br>
The resultant granulates prepared according to Example 1B were tabletted<br>
according to the same method described in Example 8 and evaluated for tensile<br>
strength. The products of inventive Example 4 (MCC-SLS 0.2%w/w) and Example<br>
7 (off-the-shelf MCC) were included in Figure 4 for comparison purposes.<br>
Referring now to Figure 4, it can be seen that this surfactant provides little, if<br>
any, improvement in the retention of MCC compressibility. It can, therefore, be seen<br>
that mere addition of any lubricant in any amount is not sufficient to allow MCC to<br>
retain its compressibility in wet granulations. Rather, selected surfactants, present<br>
within the claimed ranges, provide the desirable compressibility characteristics to the<br>
MCC.<br>
While there have been described what are presently believed to be the preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention, those skilled in the art will realize that changes and<br>
modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit of the invention.<br>
