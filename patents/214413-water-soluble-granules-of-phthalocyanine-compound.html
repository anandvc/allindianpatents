				<td>The present invention relates to water-soluble granules of phthalocyanine compounds, to a method of produC1ng them, and to the use thereof in washing agent preparations.<br>
Water-soluble phthalocyanine dyes, espeC1ally zinc and aluminium phthalocyanine-sulfonates, are frequently used as photoactivators in washing agent preparations. In view of the fact that such photoactivators dissolve too slowly in water, problems often arise, espeC1ally when there is inadequate mixing of the washing liquor, because the coloured photoactivators stain the laundry.<br>
Solid microcapsules of phthalocyanine photoactivators that contain at least 38 % of an encapsulating material havealready been described in EP-B-0 333 270 but those microcapsules are also not able to satisfy all of the consumer"s requirements in terms of dissolving behaviour and staining of the laundry.<br>
It has now been found that, surprisingly, granules comprising a water-soluble phthalocyanine compound, an anionic dispersing agent and a maximum of 25 % by weight of an organic polymer are distinguished by a high rate of dissolution in water, with the result that the problems mentioned above are substantially or entirely eliminated. A further advantage of such granules is that, even in the case of prolonged contact with a non-ionic surfactant, the phthalocyanine compound is not dissolved out of the granules and the laundry is not stained.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates to water-soluble granules of phthalocyanine compounds comprising<br>
a)	from 2 to 50 % by weight of a water-soluble phthalocyanine compound,	<br>
b)	from 10 to 95 % by weight of an anionic dispersing agent,	<br><br>
c)	from 0 to 25 % by weight of a water-soluble organic polymer,<br>
d)	from 0 to 10 % by weight of a further additive and	<br>
e)	from 3 to 15 % by weight of water, based on the total weight of the granules. J<br>

especially from 50_to.S£L% by weight, of anionic dispersing agent.	"l<br>
In addition to the water-soluble phthalocyanine compound and the anionic dispersing agent, the granules according to the invention may comprise a water-soluble organic polymer. Such polymers may be used individually or in the form of a mixture of two or more polymers. Preferably, such a polymer is added for the purpose of improving the mecjianic stability of the granules and/or when, during later use of the granules in a washing agent, the phthalo¬cyanine compound is to be prevented from being dissolved out of the granules by a non-ionic surfactant.<br>
There come into consideration as water-soluble polymers, for example, gelatin, poly-acrylates, polymethacrylates, copolymers of ethyl acetate, methyl methacrylate and methacrylic acid (ammonium salt), polyvinylpyrrolidones, vinylpyrrolidones, vinyl acetates, copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone with long-chained a-olefins, poly(vinylpyrrolidone/dimethyl-aminoethyl methacrylates), copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone/dimethylaminopropyl methacrylamides, copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone/dimethylaminopropyl acrylamides, quaternised copolymers of vinylpyrrolidones and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylates, terpolymers of vinylcaprolactam/vinylpyrrolldone/dimethylaminoethyl methacrylates, copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone and methacrylamidopropyl-trimethylammonium chloride, terpolymers of caprolactam/vinylpyrrolidone/dimethylaminoethyl methacrylates, copolymers of styrene and acrylic acid, polycarboxylic acids, polyacrylamides, carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose, polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl acetate, hydrolysed polyvinyl acetate, copolymers of maleic acid with unsaturated hydrocarbons, and mixed polymerizations products of the mentioned polymers.<br><br>
Of those organic polymers, carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylamides, polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinylpyrrolidones, gelatin, hydrolysed polyvinyl acetates, copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone and vinyl acetate, and also polyacrylates and polymethacrylates, are especially preferred.<br>
The organic polymers are used in an amount of from 0 to 25 % by weight, preferably from 5 to 20 % by weight and, especially, from 8 to 18 % by weight, based on the total weight of the granules.<br>
The granules according to the invention may comprise further additives, for example wetting agents, water-insoluble or water-soluble dyes or pigments, and also dissolution accelerators and optical brighteners. Such additives are present in an amount of from 0 to 10 % by weight, based on the total weight of the granules.<br>
The granules according to the invention are produced, for example, in the following manner: first of all an aqueous solution of the phthalocyanine dye is prepared, the anionic dispersing agent and, if desired, further additives are added thereto, and the mixture is stirred, where appropriate with heating, until a homogeneous solution is obtained. The solids content of the solution should preferably be at least 30 % by weight, especially from 40 to 50 % by weight, based on the total weight of the solution. The viscosity of the solution is preferably less than 200 mPas.<br>
The aqueous solution comprising the phthalocyanine dye and the anionic dispersing agent is then subjected to a drying step in which all water, with the exception of a residual amount, is removed, solid particles (granules) simultaneously being formed. Known methods are suitable for producing the granules from the aqueous solution. In principle, both continuous methods and discontinuous methods are suitable. Continuous methods are preferred, especially spray-drying and fluidized bed granulation processes.<br>
Especially suitable are spray-drying processes in which the active ingredient solution is sprayed into a chamber with circulating hot air. The atomization of the solution is carried out using unitary or binary nozzles or is brought about by the spinning effect of a rapidly rotating disc. In order to increase the particle size, the spray- drying process may be combined with an additional agglomeration of the liquid particles with solid nuclei in a fluidized bed that forms an integral part of the chamber (so-called fluidized spray dryer). The fine particles<br><br>
(
During the granulation step, the water can rapidly be removed from the solutions comprising phthalocyanine compound, anionic dispersing agent and possibly organic polymer and further additives, and it is expressly intended that agglomeration of the droplets forming in the atomising cone, i.e. the agglomeration of droplets with solid particles, will take place.<br>
If necessary, the granules formed in the spray-dryer are removed in a continuous process, for example by a sieving operation. The fines and the oversize particles are either recycled directly to the process (without being rediscover) or are dissolved in the liquid active ingredient formulation and subsequently granulated again.<br>
The granules according to the invention are resistant to abrasion, low in dust, free-flowing and can readily be metered. They are distinguished in particular by very rapid solubility in water. They are used especially in washing agent formulations. They may be added in the desired concentration of the phthalocyanine compound directly to a washing agent formulation. The present invention relates also to that use.<br>
Where the dark appearance of the granules in the washing agent is to be suppressed, this can be achieved, for example, by embedding the granules in a droplet of a whitish moldable substance ("water-soluble wax") or, preferably, by encapsulating the granules in a melt consisting, for example, of a water-soluble wax, as described in EP-B-0 323 407 B1, a white solid (e.g. titanium dioxide) being added to the melt in order to reinforce the masking effect of the capsule.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates also to washing agent formulations comprising<br>
I)	from 5 to 70 % A) of an anionic surfactant and/or B) of a non-ionic surfactant,<br>
II)	from 5 to 50 % C) of a builder substance,<br>
III)	from 1 to 12 % D) of a peroxide and, where appropriate, a catalyst and<br>
IV)	from 0.01 to 1 % E) of granules according to the invention,<br><br>
the percentages in each case being percentages by weight, based on the total weight of the washing agent.<br>
Preference is given to washing agent formulations comprising<br>
I)	from 5 to 70 % A) of an anionic surfactant and/or B) of a non-ionic surfactant,<br>
II)	from 5 to 40 % C) of a builder substance,<br><br>
III)	from 1 to 12 % D) of a peroxide and, where appropriate, a catalyst and<br>
IV)	from 0.01 to 0.5 % E) of granules according to the invention,<br>
the percentages in each case being percentages by weight, based on the total weight of the washing agent.<br>
The washing agent may be in solid or liquid form, for example in the form of a liquid non¬aqueous washing agent containing not more than 5 % by weight, preferably from 0 to 1 % by weight, of water, and may have as base a suspension of a builder substance in a non-ionic surfactant, for example as described in GB-A-2 158 454.<br>
Preferably, however, the washing agent is in the form of a powder or granules, which can be produced, for example, by first of all preparing a starting powder by spray-drying an aqueous suspension containing all of the components listed above with the exception of components D) and E), and then adding the dry components D) and E) and mixing everything together.<br>
It is also possible to start with an aqueous suspension that contains components A) and C), but not component B) or only some of component B). The suspension is spray-dried, then component E) is mixed with component B) and the mixture is added to the suspension, and subsequently component D) is admixed dry.<br>
Preferably, the components are mixed with one another in such amounts that a solid compact washing agent in the form of granules is obtained that has a specific weight of at least 500 g/l.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the production of the washing agent is carried out in three steps. In the first step a mixture of anionic surfactant (and, where appropriate, a small amount of non-ionic surfactant) and builder substance is prepared. In the second step that<br><br>
mixture is sprayed with the major portion of the non-ionic surfactant and then, in the third step, peroxide, where appropriate catalyst, and the granules according to the invention are added. That method is usually carried out in a fluidized bed.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the individual steps are not carried out completely separately, so that there is a certain amount of overlap between them. Such a method is usually carried out in an extruder, in order to obtain granules in the form of mega pearls.<br>
The anionic surfactant A) may be, for example, a sulfate, sulfonates or carboxyl ate surfactant or a mixture of those surfactants.<br>
Preferred sulfates are those having from 12 to 22 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical, where appropriate in combination with alkyl ethoxysulfates having from 10 to 20 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical.<br>
Preferred sulfonates are, for example, alkylbenzenesulfonates having from 9 to 15 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical and/or alkyl naphthalenesulfonates having from 6 to 16 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical in question.<br>
The cation in the anionic surfactant is preferably an alkali metal cation, especially sodium.<br>
Preferred carboxylates are alkali metal sarcosinates of the formula R-C0-N(R1)-CH2C00M\ wherein R is alkyl or alkenyl having from 8 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl or alkenyl radical, R1 is C1-C4alkyl and M1 is an alkali metal.<br>
The non-ionic surfactant B) may be, for example, a condensation product of from 3 to 8 mols of ethylene oxide with 1 mol of primary alcohol that contains from 9 to 15 carbon atoms.<br>
There come into consideration as builder substance C), for example, alkali metal phosphates, especially tripolyphosphates, carbonates or hydrogen carbonates, especially the sodium salts, silicates, aluminium silicates, polycarboxylates, polycarboxylic acids.<br><br>
organic phosphonates, aminoalkylenepoly(alkylenephosphonates) or mixtures of those compounds.<br>
Especially suitable silicates are sodium salts of crystalline silicates having layered structures of the formula NaHSit02t+i.pH20 or Na2Sif02t+i.pH20, wherein t is a number from 1.9 to 4 and p is a number from 0 to 20.<br>
Among the aluminium silicates, preference is given to those obtainable commercially under the names zeolite A, B, X and HS, and also to mixtures comprising two or more of those components.<br>
Among the polycarboxylates, preference is given to polyhydroxycarboxylates, especially citrates, and acrylates and also copolymers thereof with malefic anhydride.<br>
Preferred polycarboxylic acids are nitrilotriacetic acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and ethylenediamine dissociated either in racemes form or in the enantiomerically pure S,S form.<br>
Phosphonates or aminoalkylenepoly(alkylenephosphonates) that are especially suitable are alkali metal salts of 1-hydroxyethane-1,1-diphosphonlc acid, nitrilotris(methylenephos-phonic acid), ethylenediaminetetramethylenephosphonic acid and diethylenetriaminepenta-methylenephosphonic acid.<br>
There come into consideration as the peroxide component D), for example, the organic and inorganic peroxides known in the literature and available commercially that bleach textile materials at conventional washing temperatures, for example at from 10 to 95°C.<br>
The organic peroxides are, for example, mono- or poly-peroxides, especially organic piracies or salts thereof, such as phthalimidoperoxycaproic acid, peroxybenzoic acid, diperoxydodecanoic diacid, diperoxynonanoic diacid, diperoxydecanoic dyadic, diperoxy-phthalic acid or salts thereof.<br>
Preferably, however, inorganic peroxides are used, such as, for example, per sulfates, per borates, percarbonates and/or per silicates. It will be understood that mixtures of<br><br>
inorganic and/or organic peroxides can also be used. The peroxides may be in a variety of crystalline forms and have different water contents, and they may also be used together with other inorganic or organic compounds in order to improve their storage stability.<br>
The peroxides are added to the washing agent preferably by mixing the components, for example using a screw metering system and/or a fluidized bed mixer.<br>
The washing agents may comprise, in addition to the combination according to the invention, one or more optical brighteners, for example from the class bis-triazinylamino-stilbenedisulfonic acid, bis-triazolylstiibenedisuifonic acid, bis-styrylbiphenyl or bis-benzo-furanylbiphenyl, a bis-benzoxalyl derivative, bis-benzimidazolyl derivative or coumarone derivative or a pyrazoline derivative.<br>
The washing agent may also comprise suspending agents for dirt, e.g. sodium carboxy-methylcellulose, pH regulators, e.g. alkali metal or alkaline earth metal silicates, foam regulators, e.g. soap, salts for regulating the spray-drying and the granulating properties, e.g. sodium sulfate, perfumes and, optionally, antistatic agents and softeners, enzymes, such as amylase, bleaches, pigments and/or toning agents. It will be understood that such constituents must be stable towards the bleaching agent used.<br>
Further preferred additives to the washing agents according to the invention are polymers which, during the washing of textiles, prevent staining caused by dyes in the washing liquor which have been released from the textiles under the washing conditions. Such polymers are preferably polyvinylpyrrolidones which, where appropriate, have been modified by the incorporation of anionic or cationic substituents, especially those having a molecular weight in the range from 5000 to 60 000, more especially from 10 000 to 50 000. Such polymers are preferably used in an amount of from 0.05 to 5 % by weight, especially from 0.2 to 1.7% by weight, based on the total weight of the washing agent.<br>
In addition, the washing agents according to the invention may also comprise so-called perborate activators, such as, for example, TAED or TAGU. Preference is given to TAED, which is preferably used in an amount of from 0.05 to 5 % by weight, especially from 0.2 to 1.7 % by weight, based on the total weight of the washing agent.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a water-soluble granules of a phthalocyanine compound comprising a) from 2 to 50 % by weight of a water-soluble phthalocyanine compound, b) from 10 to 95 % by weight of an anionic dispersing agent, c) from 0 to 25 % by weight of a water-soluble organic polymer, d) from 0 to 10 % by weight of a wetting agent, water-insoluble, water-soluble dye or pigment, or dissolution accelerator or optical brightener, wherein components (a) to (d) are as herein described, and e) from 3 to 15 % by weight of water, based on the total weight of the granules.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a method of producing the granules such as herein described, wherein first of all an aqueous solution of the phthalocyanine dye is prepared in a known manner the anionic dispersing agent and, optional, a wetting agent, water-insoluble, water-soluble dye or pigment, or dissolution accelerator or optical brightener, and, optional, a water-soluble organic polymer, are added thereto, the mixture is stirred until a homogeneous solution is obtained, and the aqueous solution is then subjected to a drying step in which all water, with the exception of a residual amount, is removed, solid particles (granules) simultaneously being formed.<br><br>
The following Examples serve to illustrate the invention without limiting the invention thereto. Parts and percentages relate to weight, unless specified otherwise.<br>
Example 1: 725 g of an aqueous solution of a zinc phthalocyanine compound (sodium salt of zinc phthalocyanine, containing 3 or 4 sulfo groups) having a solids content of 20 % by weight are introduced into a glass beaker. 3010 g of an aqueous solution containing 40 % by weight of an anionic dispersing agent (condensation product of naphthalenesulfonic acid and formaldehyde) are added to the first solution. The phthalocyanine/dispersing agent mixture having a solids content of approximately 34 % by weight is homogenised by stirring at 25°C for 1 hour. The solution is then spray-dried in a spray dryer equipped with a unitary nozzle. The exhaust air temperature is 105°C at a feed air temperature of 195°C. Free-flowing granules having an average particle size of 50 [jm and a residual water content of 7 % are obtained. The granules produced in that manner contain 10 % zinc phthalocyanine.<br>
Examples 2 to 7:   Granules having the following compositions are produced according to the same procedure: the phthalocyanines in Examples 2 to 48 each contain 3 or 4 sulfo groups and are in the form of sodium salts.<br><br><br>
Example 8: 880 g of an aqueous solution of an aluminium phthalocyanine compound (sodium salt of aluminium phthalocyanine, containing 3 or 4 sulfo groups) having a solids content of 25 % by weight are introduced into a glass beaker and diluted with 1460 g of deionised water. The solution is heated to 45""C and a dry, pulverulent anionic dispersing agent (condensation product of formaldehyde with naphthalenesulfonic acid) is introduced in portions into the heated solution. The dispersing-agent-containing phthalocyanine solution is then stirred at 45°C for 2 hours in order that the dispersing agent is completely dissolved.<br>
The finished phthalocyanine/dispersing agent solution having a solids content of 45 % is granulated while still warm in a bench fluidized spray dryer. In the first phase of that granulation procedure, the nuclei are formed in the fluidized bed (<br><br>
95°C). Once enough nuclei are present in the fluidized bed for the granulation, the bed temperature is reduced to approximately 50°C in order to initiate the granulation process. The granulation of the entire phthalocyanine solution is carried out at a fluidized bed temperature of from 48 to 51 °C. The granules discharged from the granulator have a residual moisture content of approximately 14 % by weight and are then dried to the desired value of 9 % by weight in a continuously operating fluidized bed with air at a temperature of 75°C.<br>
The free-flowing granules have an average particle size of 160 pm and contain 10 % by weight aluminium phthalocyanine compound.<br><br><br>
Example 15: The preparation of the phthalocyanine solution and the typical formulations of the phthalocyanine granules correspond to Examples 1 to 7. Unlike Example 1, the granulation is carried out in a spray dryer in which the fines produced during the process are continuously separated from the waste gas flow and are conveyed directly by a gas flow into the atomizing cone of the nozzle. The resulting granules have the same properties as those already described in Example 1. Their average particle size is 112 |jm, so that they are obtained in a substantially coarser particle size than in Example 1. The product from this Example contains substantially less fine dust (max. 4.5 % of particles 
Example 16: 512 g of an anionic dispersing agent (condensation product of formaldehyde with naphthalenesulfonic acid) and 1000 g of a further anionic dispersing agent (methylene-lini<ed condensation product of arylsulfonic acids and hydroxyarylsulfonic are dissolved in succession g a aqueous solution the zinc phthalocyanine compound from example which has been heated to sox. formulation is then stirred for hours order that all components completely dissolved. some dried vacuole dry material ground mortar.></ed>
The ground product is subsequently introduced Into a laboratory fluidized bed granulator (STREA-1; Aeromatic AG, Bubendorf, Switzerland) as granulation nuclei. The nuclei are fluidized with the hot air (approximately eS"C) flowing into the granulator through the perforated base. The phthalocyanine solution is then sprayed continuously into the fluidized bed using a binary nozzle. After approximately 90 minutes, the granulation (metering in of the phthalocyanine solution) is terminated. Once the granulation is concluded the granules are dried in the same equipment, with air at a temperature of 80""C, to a residual water content of 5 % by weight.<br>
The particles are then discharged and the fines are removed by sieving. The average particle size is 380 pm.<br>
Examples 17 to 22: Granules having the following compositions are produced according to the same procedure as that in Example 16:<br><br><br>
Example 23: 826 g of a pulverulent dispersing agent (condensation product of formaldehyde with naphthalenesulfonic acid) are stirred into and dissolved in 1073 g of an aqueous solution of the zinc phthalocyanine compound from Example 1 having a solids content of 11 % by weight. The aqueous phthalocyanine solution is stirred for 1 hour in order that the dispersing agent is completely dissolved.<br>
In a glass beaker, 177 g of a water-soluble polyacrylamide (MW=200 000) are dissolved in 700 g of deionised water by heating the solution to a maximum of 50°C. Once the polymer has dissolved completely, the phthalocyanine solution is added with stirring. The preparation is stirred for one hour and then filtered through a filter having a pore size of 0.5 μ m.<br>
The filtrate is granulated in a spray dryer in which the fines produced during the process are continuously separated from the exhaust gas flow and conveyed directly by a gas flow into the spray cone of the nozzle. The granules are free-flowing and have an average particle<br><br>
size of 105μm. The fines (particle size 
The granules are completely soluble in water within a period of less than 2 minutes. When stored in a non-ionic surfactant, no dissolving out of the phthalocyanine compound is detected even after several days.<br>
Examples 24 to 34: The formulations listed in the following Table are produced analogously to Example 23 and, after spray-drying, result in granules having the same properties in terms of particle size, solubility in water and non-ionic surfactants as the granules according to Example 23.<br><br><br><br>
Examples 35 to 53: The formulations listed in the following Table are obtained by first of all preparing aqueous solutions of the components and then granulating those solutions in a fluidized spray dryer.<br>
As already described in Example 8, in the first phase of the granulation procedure the equipment is operated as a spray dryer in order to produce in the fluidized bed the nuclei necessary for the granulation (Tfeedair=210°C, Tbed=115°C). Once enough nuclei are present in the fluidized bed for the granulation, the bed temperature is reduced to approximately<br><br>
65°C in order to initiate the granulation process. The granulation of the phthalocyanine solution is carried out at a fluidized bed temperature of from 60 to 68°C. The granules discharged from the granulator have a residual moisture content of approximately 12 % by weight and are then dried to the formulation-specific desired value (see following Table) in a continuously operating fluidized bed into which air at a temperature of 85°C is fed. Irrespective of the formulation in question, the granules are free-flowing, are rapidly dissolved in water and are not visibly soluble in non-ionic surfactants for a period of days.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 54: The formulations listed in Examples 45 to 51 are granulated in a fluidized bed granulator (STREA-1, Aeromatic AG) instead of in the fluidized spray dryer. For that purpose, as explained in Example 16 some of the phthalocyanine solution is dried and ground separately and used as nuclei in the granulating procedure.<br>
The granules obtained from the fluidized bed granulation have an average particle size of from 250 to 480μm. The average particle size varies within that range according to the composition of the formulation.<br><br><br>
