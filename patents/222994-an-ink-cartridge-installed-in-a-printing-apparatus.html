A positioning member 280 is placed for enabling the ink cartridge 210 to be properly installed in the printing apparatus on the second sidewall 226. The positioning member 280 has a positioning rib 282, which protrudes from the second sidewall 226 and is extended towards the bottom 222. As shown in FIG. 9A, the positioning rib 282 is located out of the range of the width Wl of the contact terminal member 262 . That is, the cer.terline (the single-dotted and dashed line) of the positioning rib 282 is in the outside of the width wi (the distance between the dashed lines) of the contact terminal member 262. The ink cartridge 210 further includes a projecting part 290 more closely placed to the top of the ink cartridge 210 than the contact terminal member 2 62 of the memory 260 and the positioning rib 282 is.  The projecting part 290 has a surface 292, which protrudes above the positioning rib 282 and is nearly parallel to the second sidewall 226. That is, referring to FIG. 9B, the position (the broken line) of the surface 292 of the projecting part 290 is beyond either the position (the dotted and dashed line) of the positioning rib 282 or the position (the double-dotted and dashed lines) of the contact terminal member 262. Consequently, in the case of being handled the ink cartridge by a user, the projecting part 290 is in contact with the exterior so that the contact terminal member 262 and the positioning rib 282 can be protected from an impact of the exterior. Especially, even though a user drops the ink cartridge 210 onto the floor by mistake, the<br><br>
contact terminal member 262 is safe because the contact terminal member 262 is not in contact with the floor.<br>
As shown in FIG. 9A, the center of the contact terminal member 262, that is, the lengthwise center axis of the middle one of the contact terminals in the upper row, is placed at a different position from the center axis (the double-dotted and dashed line) of the ink supply opening 242 .  The contact terminal member 262 is placed to be close to the third sidewall 227 crossing both the second sidewall 226 and the bottom 222 on the second sidewall 226". In addition, the ink cartridge 210 further includes an inverse mounting preventing rib 229 placed on the fourth sidewall 228 opposite to the third sidewall 227.<br>
FIG. 10 is a perspective view of an ink cartridge, another embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 11 is a perspective view showing the bottom of the ink cartridge shown in FIG. 10. The ink cartridge 310 includes an ink cartridge body 320, an ink supply section 340, a memory 360 and a positioning member 380. FIG. 12 is a perspective and exploded view of the ink cartridge 310.

Tha ink supply section 340 has ink supply openings 342, 344 and 345 plaoad co be close to the first sidewail 324 crossing the bottom 322 of the ink cartridge body 320 on the bottom 322 of the ink cartridge body 320 corresponding to the a plurality of the ink chamber 332, 334 and 335.<br>
The memory 360 has a contact terminal member 352. The contact terminal member 352 is placed on the second sidewail 325 opposite to the first sidewail 324 crossing the bottorn 3 22 of che ink cart ridge body 320 and located at the position corresponding to the partitioning wail 333. The memory 360 has the same composition and function as the memory 250 of the ink cartridge 210 does so the description of them is omitted.<br>
FIG. 13A is a front elevational view showing the second sidewail 326 of the ink cartridge 310 according to the embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 13B is a side elevational view showing the fourth sidewail 328 of the ink cartridge 310.<br>
As shown in FIG. 13A, the center of the contact terminal<br>
member 362 is placed at the position different from the center<br>
axis (the double-dotted, and dashed line) of the ink supply openings . The contact terminal member 352 is placed, to be close co the third sidewail 327 crossing che bottom 322 and the second sidewall 326 on the second sidewail 326. The contact terminal member 3S2, as described above, is placed at the position corresponding to the partitioning wall 333 near the third sidewail 327 . The centerline (the dotted and dashed line) of the position corresponding to the partitioning wall 333 is located within the range of ths width W2 (the distance between che 2 broken line) of the concact terminal member 352 of the memory 350. In addition., in the ink cartridge<br><br>
310 according to the embodiment of the present invention, the centerline of the contact terminal member 362 is at the nearly same position as the centerline corresponding to the partitioning wall 333.<br>
The ink cartridge 310, like the ink cartridge 210, has a positioning rib 382, which protrudes from the second sidewall 326 and is extended towards the bottom 322. The positioning rib 382 is located out of the range of the width W2 of the contact terminal member 362. That is, the centerline (the dashed and dotted line) of the positioning rib 382 is in the outside of the width W2 of the contact terminal member 362.<br>
The ink cartridge 310, like the ink cartridge 210, further includes a projecting part 390 more closely placed to the top of the ink cartridge 310 than the contact terminal member 362 of the memory 360 and the positioning rib 382 is. The projecting part 390 has a surface 392, which protrudes above the positioning rib 382 and is nearly parallel to the second sidewall 326. That is, referring to FIG. 13B, the position (the broken line) of the surf ace 392 of the projecting part 390 is beyond either the position (the dotted and dashed line) of the positioning rib 382 or the position (the double-dotted and dashed line) of the contact terminal member 362.<br>
The ink cartridge 310 further includes an inverse mounting preventing rib 329 placed on the fourth sidewall 328 opposite to the third sidewall 327 near the contact terminal member 362.-<br>
FIG. 14 is a perspective view of a carriage, in which two ink cartridges are installed. The carriage 400 has the first cartridge holding section 410, in which the ink cartridge 210 containing black ink is installed and the second cartridge holding section450, in which the inkcartridge 310 containing cyan, magenta and yellow ink is installed.<br><br>
A contact terminal member 420 is placed at the position, which is in the first cartridge holding section 410 and corresponds to the contact terminal member 262 of the memory 260, when the ink cartridge 210 is installed in the first cartridge holding section 410. In addition, the first cartridge holding section 410 has a position decision groove 430, which is placed at the same sidewall as the contact terminal member 420 is on, is away from the second cartridge holding section 450 more than the contact terminal member 420 is and is engaged with the positioning rib 282 of the ink cartridge 210 . Moreover, the first cartridge holding section 410 has a gap 440, which is placed at the sidewall opposite to the second cartridge holding section 450 and is engaged with the inverse mounting preventing rib 282 of the ink cartridge 210.<br>
Though not shown in FIG. 14, an ink supply needle 412 is placed at the posit ion, which is on the bottom of the first cartridge holding section 410 and corresponds to the ink supply section 240 of the ink cartridge. The ink supply needle 412 is hollow, and an end surface of the ink supply needle 412 is placed in the inside of the bottom of the carriage 400.<br>
Like the first cartridge holding section 410, a contact terminal member 460 is placed at the position, which is in the second cartridge holding section 450 and corresponds to the contact terminal member 362 of the memory 360 when the ink cartridge 310 is installed in the second cartridge holding section 450. In addition, the second cartridge holding section 450 has an ink cartridge position regulating groove 470, which is placed at the same sidewall as the contact terminal member 460 is on, is away from the first cartridge holding section 410 more than the contact terminal member 460 is and is engaged with the positioning rib 382 of the ink cartridge 310. Moreover, the .second cartridge holding section 450 has a gap 480, which is placed at the sidewall<br><br>
opposite to the first cartridge holding section 410 and is engaged with the inverse mounting preventing rib 382 of the ink cartridge 310. An ink supply needle 452, like the first cartridge holding section 410, is placed at the position, which is on the bottom of the SfcConclcartridge holding section 4^&gt;0_and corresponds to the ink supply section 3^0 of the ink cartridge. The construction of the ink supply needle 452 is similar to the that of the ink supply needle 412 of the first cartridge holding section 410, but since there are three ink supply openings 342, 344 and 346 of the ink cartridge 3}0, the ink supply needle 452 has three ink supply needles 452.<br>
FIG. 15 is a perspective view showing the relation of the two ink cartridges installed in the carriage. As shown in FIG. 15 , the ink cartridge 210 and the ink cartridge 310 are side-by-side installed in the carriage 400. In that case, the third sidewall 227 of the ink cartridge 210 and the third sidewall 327 of the ink cartridge 310 face each other.<br>
As described above, the contact terminal member 262 of the ink cartridge 210 is placed to be close to the third sidewall 227, while the contact terminal member 362 of the ink cartridge 310 is placed to be close to the third sidewall 327. That is, the contact terminal member 262 of the ink cartridge 210 and the contact terminal member 362 of the ink cartridge 310 is positioned next to each other, while the 2 ink cartridge 210 and 310 are installed in the carriage 400. Accordingly, like the carriage 400 shown in FIG. 14, the contact terminal member 420 of the first cartridge holding section 410 and the contact terminal member 460 of the second cartridge holding section 450 can be closely placed each other so that wires of, for example, FPC do not need to be long.<br>
In addition, as described above, the inverse mounting preventing rib 229 of the ink cartridge 210 is placed on the fourth<br><br>
sidewall 228 opposite to the third sidewall 227, while the inverse mounting preventing rib 329 of the ink cartridge 310 is placed on the fourth sidewall 328 opposite to the third sidewall 327. That is, the inverse mount ing prevent ing rib 229 of the ink cart ridge 210 and the inverse mount ing prevent ing rib 329 of the ink cartridge 310 is not located facing each other. Consequently, the third sidewall 227 and the third sidewall 327 can be closely positioned so that the size of the whole carriage 400 can be small.<br>
FIG. 16A and FIG. 16B are partly cross-sectional views showing that the ink cartridge 310 is installed in the carriage 400 . FIG. 16A and FIG. 16B are cross-sectional views of the second cartridge holding section 450 of the carriage 400 with respect to a plane including the position regulating groove 470 . Although it is described that the ink cartridge 310 is installed in the second cartridge holding section 450 of the carriage 400 as an example here, it is the same case that the ink cartridge 210 is installed in the first cartridge holding section 410 of the carriage 400.<br>
As shown in FIG. 16A, the ink cartridge 310 is positioned in normal direction to the second cartridge holding section 450_ of the carriage 400. Here, the normal direction means that tni ink supply section 340 of the ink cartridge 310 faces the ink supply needle 452 of the second cartridge holding section 450 and the contact terminal member 362 of the ink cartridge 310 faces the contact terminal member 460 of the second cartridge holding section 450. The ink cartridge positioned in the normal direction is inserted into the second cartridge holding section 450 of the carriage 400.<br>
As shown in FIG. 16B, the ink cartridge 310 being inserted, the positioning rib 3,82 is guided by the ink cartridge position regulating groove 470 of the second cartridge holding section 450 .<br><br>
The inverse mounting preventing rib 329 is engaged with the gap 480 of the second cartridge holding section 450.<br>
As the ink cartridge 310 is further inserted, the ink supply needle 452 of the second cartridge holding section 450 enters the inside of the ink supply section 340 of the ink cartridge 310. As the bottom of the ink supply section 340 of the ink cartridge 310 comes in contact with the end surface of the ink supply needle 452 of the second cartridge holding section 450, the installation of the ink cartridge 310 is over. Accordingly, the ink cartridge 310 supplies the printing apparatus with ink through the ink supply needle.<br>
FIG. 17A and FIG. 17B are another partly cross-sectional views showing that the ink cartridge 310 is installed in the carriage 400. FIG. IVAandFIG. 17B are cross-sectional views of the second cartridge holding section 450 of the carriage 400 with respect to a plane not including the position regulating groove 470.<br>
FIG. 17A, which corresponds to FIG. 16A, shows that ink cartridge 310 is positioned in the normal direction to the second cartridge holding sect ion 4-5Qo£ tne carriage 400 . FIG. 17B, which corresponds to FIG. 16B, shows a state of the ink cartridge 310 being installed in the second cartridge holding section 450 of the carriage 400.<br>
As shown in FIG. 17B, when the bottom of the ink supply section 340 of the ink cartridge 310 comes in contact with the ink supply needle 452 of the second cartridge holding section, the lower surface of the projection part 390 of the ink cartridge 310 comes in contact with a surf ace 472 of the second cartridge holding section 450.<br>
The position of the ink cartridge 310 is decided not only by the penetration of the ink supply needle 452 into the ink supply section 340, but also by the engagement of the positioning rib<br><br>
382 and the ink cartridge position regulating groove 470. Accordingly, the contact terminal member 362 of the ink cartridge 310 is coupled to the contact terminal member 460 of the second cartridge holding section 450 with a degree of precision, even if the contact terminal member 362 of the ink cartridge 310 is positioned far away from the ink supply section 340, because the ink cartridge 310 is positioned in the direction to the same second sidewall 326 by the positioning rib 382. Consequently, the information obtained by the coupling of the contact terminal member 460 and the contact terminal member361 of the ink cartridge 310 can be certainly transmitted to the printing apparatus through wires 462 of, for example, FPC.<br>
It is possible to prevent the positioning rib 382 from damaging the contact terminal member 460 of the second cartridge holding section 450, when the ink cartridge 310 is installed in the second cartridge holding section 450, because the positioning rib 382 of the ink cartridge 310 is located in the outside of the width W2 of the contact terminal member 460.<br>
Here, when the ink cartridge 210 is already installed, the ink cartridge 310 is positioned in the inverse direction. That is, it means that the ink cartridge is positioned as the first sidewall 324 faces the contact terminal member 460 of the second cartridge holding section 450 or the second sidewall 326 faces the ink supply needle 452. If the ink cartridge 310 is mounted in the second cartridge holding section 450 in this condition, the inverse mounting preventing rib 329 of the ink cartridge 310 will be blocked by the ink cartridge 210. Accordingly, the ink cartridge 310 will not be inserted any more. Consequently, the ink cartridge 310 is prevented from being installed in the second cartridge holding section 450 in the inverse direction.<br><br>
According to the above embodiments of the present invention, the contact terminal member can be certainly coupled to the contact terminal member of the carriage, though the contact terminal member is placed far away from the ink supply section, because the ink cartridge is positioned in the direct ion to the same second sidewall by the positioning rib. Accordingly, the degree of freedom of the space where the contact terminal member of the ink cartridge is placed can be increased.<br>
In addition, in the case that the contact terminal member is placed at the position corresponding to the partitioning wall of the ink cartridge, it is hard for the ink cartridge body to be transformed by the fabrication or the decrease of pressure in manufacturing the ink cartridge, and the contact terminal member can be further certainly coupled to the contact terminal member of the carriage.<br>
Although the present invention has been described by way of exemplary embodiments, it should be understood that those skilled in the art might make many changes and substitutions without departing from the spirit and the scope of the present invention, which is defined only by the appended claims.<br>
For example, though an ink-jet printer as a printing apparatus has been described by way of exemplary embodiments, the present invention can also be applied to sucha facsimile apparatus or copying apparatus of ink-jet type, if these printing apparatuses include a carriage.<br><br><br><br><br>
