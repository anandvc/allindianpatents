5     NOZZLE FOR SPRAYING LIQUID SUBSTANCES, DISPERSIONS,<br>
EMULSIONS, OR SUSPENSIONS<br>
The invention relates to a nozzle for spraying liquid substances, dispersions,<br>
emulsions, or suspensions with the features noted in the preamble of Claim 1.<br>
10<br>
Nozzle constructions for spraying liquid substances, dispersions, emulsions,<br>
or suspensions into a fhidized bed granulating system are generally known.<br>
The appropriate nozzle constructions are especially adapted to the field of<br>
application of materials to be produced in the fujidized bed granulating<br>
15 system For example, two-component nozzles are known, which usually<br>
include 3 centrally arranged inner tube and an outer tube spaced apart from<br>
this inner tube- The liquid substance to be sprayed into the fluidized bed is<br>
fed to the inner tube, while an atomizing gas is fed to the outer tube,<br>
20 Corresponding to the material to be produced, it is also known to provide the<br>
nozzle as a three-component or four-component atomizing nozzle, or, in<br>
general, as a multi-coropoment atomizing nozzle. In this way, the materials to<br>
be atomized differently and tha atomizing gas are fed into the resulting<br>
int^rtnediate spacea between, the individual tubes or channels.<br>
25<br>
A disadvantage in these nozzes is their difficult cleaning, because the nozzles<br>
are difficult to access and must be built with large expense for cleaning.<br>
Especially in the food industry and in other intemnaely hygienic industries, as<br>
well as in the cherrical industry, high demands are placed on the cleanliness<br>
30 of the system, so that it is necessary to subject the nozzles to cleaing<br>
processes at certain intervale.<br><br>
The objective of the invention is to create a nozzle according to the class for<br>
use in tfce food and chemical industries, which is distirnguished by good<br>
accessibility and which can be easily disassembled and assembled for a<br>
necessary cleaning: process without great expense.<br>
5<br>
This objective is solved according to the invention by the characterizing<br>
features of Claim 1.<br>
According to the invention, because the inner tube of the nozzle is mounted in<br>
10     a receiving block, which is attached detach ably in a tube arranged in a fixed<br>
manner on the bottom region of a lance base and which can be removed from<br>
this tube with the inner tube and the add-on parts possibly attached to the<br>
inner tube, and because an attachment device, which connects the nozzle<br>
detachably to the processing housing of the fluidized-bed granulating system,<br>
15     is arranged at the bottom region of the outer tube of the nozzle, the nozzle<br>
1       can be dieassembled with a few hand movements and the individual parts<br>
can be subjected to a corresponding cleaning process. Through the arrange-<br>
ment of the corresponding attachment means, good accessibility to these<br>
means is also given, so that the nozzle can be quickly uninstalled and also<br>
20     reinstalled.<br>
Additional advantageous configurations are described in the subordinate<br>
claims. They are explained together with their effect in the description,<br>
25 The invention is explained in more detail below with reference to an embodi-<br>
ment In the associated; drawing a nozzle for spraying liquid substances,<br>
dispersions emulsions, or suspensions into a fluidized-bed granulating<br>
system is illustrated, schematically.<br>
-2-<br><br>
		2007/013<br>
The solution aceording to the invention is explained using a known two-<br>
compoent nozzle. The solution according to the invention can also be used<br>
analogously for three-corponent or fbur-copmponent nozzdes,<br>
5 The known two-component nozzle includes a cylindrical nozzle body, which is<br>
formed from a. central inner tube 3 and an outer tube 2 spaced apart from,<br>
this inner tube, and of a nozzle mouth, piece 1. The inner tube 3 is connected<br>
with, its bottom and to a supply for the material to be sprayed, while the<br>
atomizig gas is fed to the nozzle mouth. piece 1 via the internuetiiamedie spaea<br>
10     produced beween the inner tube 3 and the outer tube 2,<br>
According to the invention, the inner tube 3 is mounted in a receiving block<br>
11, which is attached in a tube 10 arranged in a Fixed maaner at the bottom<br>
region of a lance base 9. The receiving block 11 is detachahly attached, for<br>
15 example, by means of a tri-ciamp attachment 12, to the tube 10, so that the<br>
receiving block 11 can be removed from the nozzle with the inner tube 3 and<br>
the add-on parts 6 attached to the inner tube after loosening the attachment<br>
12 for cleaning purposes. The attachment of the inner tube 3 on the receiving<br>
block 11 can be realized in the simplest case by welding the inner tube 3 with<br>
20     the receiving block 11,<br>
It is especially advantageousto screw the inner tube 3 into the recetiving<br>
block 11, In this way tbe possibility arises of setting the axial position of the<br>
inner tube 3, or of a liquid insert 4 to be explained in even more detail, in the<br>
25 region of the nozale mouth piece 1 variable relative to the outer tube 2. By<br>
setting the inner tube 3 in the axial direction, the spray angle and the spray<br>
pattern of the nozzle can be set continuously from the outside. For such a<br>
setting possibility of the inner tube 3, the seal 14 between the receiving block<br>
11 and the inner tube 3 within the Jance base 9 is a metal compensator or an<br>
-3-<br><br>
00B/013<br>
2155686499<br><br><br>
elastic o-ring in order to be able to seal the entire adjustment path hygieni-<br>
caliy.<br>
For realizing different spraying conditions, the inner tube 3 is provided with<br>
5 an exchangeable liquid insert 4 in the region of the noszle mouth piese 1. the<br>
seal between the exchangeable liquid insert 4 and the inner tube 3 is realized<br>
in an advantageous way by means of a simple metal seal set 5 in order to<br>
avoid sealing materials, In the region of the nozzle mouth, piece 1, in the<br>
annular gap between the outer tube 2 and the liquid insert 4 or the inner<br>
10 tube 3, there is an add-on part 6 in the form of swirl bodies, swirl vanes, or<br>
the like. These add-on parts 6 are used for guiding the compressed air and forguiding the inner tube 3. The add-on part 6 is connected rigidly to the inner<br>
tube 3 or alternatively to the liquid insert 4 or to the outer tube 2.<br>
15 The attachment of the noazle on the processing housing 15 of the fluidized-<br>
bed granulatiag system is realized by means of an attachment device 8,<br>
which is arranged in the bottom region of the outer tube 2. The detachable<br>
attachment of the nozzle on the processing housing 15 is realized, for<br>
example, by « milk-tube uniou nut 7 or by means of a tri-ciamp attachment.<br>
20 Here, the attachment device 8 is connacted rigidly or adjustably to the outer<br>
tube 2 by means of a clamping sleeve. Between the outer tube 2 and the<br>
attachment device 8, as wall as between the processing bousing 15 and the<br>
attachment device 8, there is a seal 16. As the seal 16, o-rings or other<br>
hygienic seals can be used.<br>
25<br>
Through the attachment according to the invention of the nozzle onto the<br>
processing; housing 15, the nozzle can be uninstaUed and also reinstaHed<br>
quickly and with minimal effort from the processing housing 15 for the<br>
purpose of cleaning.<br>

2155686499<br><br>
The outer tube 2 is connected derachabiy, for example, by means of a tri-<br>
clamp attachment 13, to the lance base 9, whereby likewise a quick and<br>
uncomplicated disassembly and assembly of the parts is given. The outer<br>
tube 3 is provided in a Tegioa of the connection to the lance base 9 with an<br>
5 expanding diameter. A supply for the atomizig gas or for the support-gas<br>
stream opens in the baae 9.<br>
insunrnary, the following can be emphasized:<br>
