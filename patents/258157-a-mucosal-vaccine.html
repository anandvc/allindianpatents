DESCRIPTION<br>
Antigen-Drug Vehicle Enabling Transmucosal and Transdermal<br>
Admmistration, and Method of Inducing Mucosal Immunity and Mucosal<br>
Vaccine and DDS using The Same<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an antigen-drug vehicle enabling transmucosal and transdermal administration, and more specifically, to a method of inducing mucosal immunity which causes preferential and effective, particularly selective production of an antigen-specific secretory immunoglobulin A, a mucosal vaccine, prevention or treatment of allergy, and a drug delivery system, which is characterized by using the vehicle for desired antigen or drug.<br>
Background Art<br>
Conventional inactivated vaccine, toxoid, and the like are known to have the following drawbacks:<br>
(1) Lack of defence against infection in natural infection route<br>
The statural infection route of bacterial, virus, and the like is, for example, the mucosal membrane of the nasal cavity, the trachea, the intestinal bract, and the like, whereas the vaccine inoculation route is subcutaneous, intramuscular, and the like, which is different from the route described above. It is desired to achieve defense against infection by an inoculation route fit for the actual conditions of the natural infection, <br>
particularly  defense  against infection  at  the  mucosal membrane from vaccine administration via the mucosal membrane.<br>
(2)	Low mucosal immunity<br>
In the subject for vaccine inoculation, immunoglobulm G (hereinafter, simply referred to as "IgG" or "IgG antibody") is mainly produced into the blood, and humoral immunity is induced. However, immunoglobulin A (hereinafter, simply referred to as "IgA" or "IgA antibody"} which takes charge of mucosal immunity, is nearly not produced, and therefore, establishment of mucosal immunity is not expected. Furthermore, necessity and effectiveness of IgA antibody are as follows: IgA antibody plays a very important roll in clinical immunity by taking charge of mucosal immunity, i.e., defense against infection at the mucosal membrane which is the entrance to infection onto the respiratory organs such as the nasal cavity and the trachea by spray or air, and infection onto the intestinal tract by oral. Furthermore, IgA antibody has crosa immunity! i.e., crose-neutralization activity, and broad spectrum for infection defense as much, and also has defense against infection for variant antigen, whereas IgG antibody has high specificity for antigen, but has narrow spectrum for infection defense, leading to nearly not being effective for infection defense against variant antigen.<br>
(3)	Necessity of additional vaccination and added expense<br>
Since IgG antibody is produced low only by one injection of the first immunization, and certain effects cannot be expected, it is required to increase blood IgG antibody value by additional inoculation, so-called booster inoculation of once or more times, based on the conditions of IgG antibody retention later. Therefore, repeated expense and effort are required, and on top of that, the case is often found where the chance of the booster inoculation is not effective for young children, especially<br><br>
infants two-years old or less, who is likely to depart from the chance of the booster inoculation, though the effects are recognized for the elderly, adults, and school children, who are benefited from the chance.<br>
In other words, conventional inactivated vaccine, toxoid, and the like induces mainly production of blood IgG antibody in the subject for vaccine inoculation, and also brings actions and effects of increasing humoral immunity, being recognized for its efficacy. However, it has low performance of inducing IgA antibody production or mucosal immunity, showing the limit about sufficient function and effects for defense against natural infection. From such circumstances, there have been many trials from various sides so far to resolve the drawbacks of the conventional vaccines. For example, it includes improvement of the vaccine antigen in quality or quantity, experimental production of live vaccine replacing inactivated vaccine, development of new inoculation route, mucosal vaccine, and the like, screening of adjuvant, which elevates humoral immunity and cause maintenance thereof, development of mucosal immunity adjuvant, and the like. However, development of mucosal vaccine which is safe and effective has not been achieved.<br>
Hereinafter, development of mucosal vaccine will be explained.<br>
(1) Increase of the amount of the vaccine antigen<br>
A trial has been conducted of increasing the amount of the vaccine antigen which is inoculated subcutaneously or intramuscularly, or increasing the amount of IgG and IgA antibodies, which are secreted to the mucosal membrane. For example, a method wherein neuraminidase of the virus membrane protein is added to and mixed with conventional inactivated influenza vaccine to increase antibody production amount, or a method wherein MF59 is added and mixed as an adjuvant, and the like has<br><br>
been tried. However, these methods have been found to have disadvantages such as incurrence of pain, strong adverse reaction, and the like.<br>
%<br>
{2) Vaccine of nasal administration type<br>
A method has been tried wherein liquid split antigen is directly inoculated nasally for infection defense by IgA antibody, which is considered most effective, but the fact is pointed out that IgA production amount is small. In. order to elevate IgA antibody production ability, there has been a trial that Eschcrichia coli heat-labile live toxin or cholera toxin is added to and mixed as an adjuvant with the split antigen to elevate mucosal immunity response, i.e., IgA antibody production ability. However, from the circumstances that the safety of the toxin as an adjuvant has been not proved, the trial treatment has been stopped, and not been put to practical use.<br>
(3)	Live vaccine using cold-attenuated strain which can be inoculated into<br>
the nasal cavity<br>
A method is put to practical use wherein cold-attenuated influenza virus strain, which has optimal growth temperature of 25°C, and does not grow at 39°C, but the risk of toxicity recovery cannot be denied as the mechanism of attenuation of the parent cold-attenuated strain is not dear. In addition, since the active ingredient of the vaccine is a live virus, it has high invasion force into cells and excellent in initialization of immunity, but mild influenza symptoms often incur, so defects have been found that it cannot be used for human who has high risk of increase in severity when infected by influenza, elderly people, and the like.<br>
(4)	Other vaccines<br>
Developments of a vector vaccine which has vaccinia virus as a<br><br>
virus vector, attenuated live vaccine by reverse genetics. DNA vaccine which uses DNA or cDNA as an active ingredient, have been in progress in lab level, but not put to practical use.<br>
Furthermore, development of immunity adjuvant will be explained below.<br>
(1) Immunity adjuvant<br>
The immunity adjuvant is a general name of a substance which has regulation activity such as reinforcement or inhibition of immune response, and largely divided into two kinds: a substance which is related to a dosage form for the purpose of sustained-release, retention, and the like of antigen within the subject for inoculation, and a substance which helps elevation, inhibition, and the like of immune response. Between them, as the former, i.e., as the adjuvant for dosage form, for example, vaccine or toxoid with use of aluminum phosphate, alum, and the like has been already put to practical use. However, the latter, i.e., the adjuvant which helps reinforcement/elevation of immune response has not been known yet to be put to practical use. For example, BCG live bacteria derived from bacteria, BCG-CWS, endotoxin, glucan, and the like, synthesized MDP, levamisole, Poly I-Poly C, bestatin, and the like, and interferons such as cytokines, TNF, CSF, and the like have been known, but it is considered that guarantee for the safety and efficacy is needed for the practical use of them, by the reasons of insufficient effects, and the like for adjuvant diseases such as arthritis, chronic arthritic rheumatism, hyper-y-globulinemia, anemia, and the like. In addition, a technique is known (Patent Document 1) using a pulmonary surfactant/protein derived from a higher animal as an adjuvant in order to enhance induction of humoral immunity, but it has not known to be put to practical use.<br><br>
(2) Development of adjuvant for mucosal immunity<br>
Various adjuvants have been developed, for example, pertussis toxin B oligomer (Patent Document 2), cholera toxin (Patent Document 3), Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit (LTD) (Patent Document 4), starch particles (Patent Document 5), cholera toxin B chain protein (CTB) (Patent Document 6), B subunit of verotoxin 1 (Patent Document 7), oligonucleotide (Patent Document 8), intcrlcukin 12 (Non-Patent Document 1), and the like. However, they have not been put yet to practical use.<br>
As described above, necessity has been recognized widely and deeply for replacement of the conventional vaccine which is inoculated subcutaneously, intramuscularly, and the Kkc with a mucosal vaccine which induces production of IgA antibody in the mucosal membrane, which is a natural infection route of virus. Particularly, as a vaccine of next generation in the 21 century, so-called mucosal vaccine, which induces production of IgA antibody, and local immunity or mucosal immunity, is expected and hoped worldwide to be developed and put to practical use, but not yet achieved. The reason is considered to be in the fact that eafe and effective adjuvant, which imparts the function of inducing production of IgA antibody, and local immunity or mucosal immunity to vaccine, has not specified or established.<br>

(1) Antigen-drug vehicle<br>
The vehicle (Antigen-drug vehicle, hereinafter, simply referred to as the "AD vehicle" or "ADV") is a complex of lipid and protein which is designed to enable transmucosal administration and transdermal administration of antigen, drug, and the like. The AD vehicle comprises (a) to (c) below.<br>
(a)	Pulmonary surfactant protein B or its fragment (including not<br>
only natural fragment obtained by protease, but also artificial fragment<br>
obtained by genetic engineering or peptide synthesis, or variant fragment<br>
by substitution and/or deletion of at least one amino acid constituting<br>
such fragment).<br>
(b)	Pulmonary surfactant protein C or its fragment (including not<br>
only natural fragment obtained by protease, but also artificial fragment<br>
obtained by genetic engineering or peptide synthesis, or variant fragment<br>
by substitution and/or deletion of at least one amino acid constituting<br>
such fragment).<br>
(c)	Lipid such as phospholipid and fatty acid.   The shape and the<br>
structure is a membrane form (lipid membrane of sheet form or rolling<br>
form) retaining polypeptide chain of thorn shape or spike shape, which is a<br>
shape wherein the ends of the hydrophobic area of the multiple polypeptide<br>
chains are intrusive into the hpid membrane to be implanted in spike<br><br>
shape, and different from conventional lipid vesicle (liposome).<br>
If desired antigen, drug, and the like is subjected to coexistence, contact, capture, adhesion or binding (riding) with the antigen-drug vehicle according to the present invention, it makes it possible transmucosal administration and transdermal administration of such antigen, drug, and the like, In other words, aforesaid vehicle is a ride of them, enabling transmucosal administration and transdermal administration of such antigen, drug, and the like.<br>

The pulmonary surfactant has been put to practical use from the middle 1990s in treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and currently, various preparations derived from human, cattle, pig, and the like have been marketed widely to be in practical use (Non-Patent Document 2). In addition, synthetic peptide preparation containing active domain related to RDS treatment has been also marketed, and design development or synthesis of SP-B and SP-C analogues have been in progress (Non-Patent Document 3). Composition and constitution of the pulmonary surfactant are as follows: a complex comprising about 90 % of lipid (67.3% of phosphatidyl choline, 19.3% of phosphatidylglycerol, 3.2% of phosphatidyi serine, and other free fatty acids, and the like), and about 10% of protein (surfactant proteins A, B, C and D: Hereinafter, simply<br><br>
referred to as "SP-A", "SP-B", "SP-C" and "SP-D". respectively). The molecular weight is 28 to 36 kDa for SP-A, 15 kDa for SP-B, 3.5 kDa for SP-C and 43 kDa for SP-D. SP-A and SP-D are hydrophilic (water-soluble) and lectin-Hke (membrane-associated). SP-B and SP-C are hydrophobic (lipid-soluble) and lipid-bindable, and has intrusion ability into phospholipid membrane and surfactant action. The pulmonary surfactant protein genes derived from human, cattle, pig, and the like are known, and for example, the accession number of full-length base sequence of human SP-B gene DNA is J02761, and that of human SP-C (and SP-C1) is J03890 in GenBank/NCBI (hrtp//www.ncbi,nlm,nih.gov./}.

In addition, use of dry preparation is more desirable than liquid preparation considering the adjustment of the concentration to be used in preparation of the AD vehicle.<br>
2. Novel findings as a base for the present invention<br>
Under such very strict background techniques, this invention is made by keen observation and analysis of the present inventors from trial and error repeated over about 10 years, and profound knowledge and experience and novel idea, and it is based on the following astonishing findings.<br><br>
(1)	Conventional adjuvant reinforces antigen presenting-performance by<br>
causing inflammation, and originally there are four kinds of protein active<br>
ingredients, SP-A, SP-B, SP-C and SP-D, which are surfactants secreted by<br>
pulmonary or intestinal tract mucosal membrane.   It has been found that<br>
if virus antigen is subjected to coexistence, contact, capture or adsorption<br>
with a complex of the combination of SP-B and SP-C excluding SP-A and<br>
SP-D, and phospholipid, or a complex of the combination of synthetic<br>
pcptidea  of both  fragments  of SP-B   and.  SP-C  comprising  lipid-soluble<br>
region thereof {active region), and lipid membrane (aforesaid AD vehicle),<br>
the antigen-presenting cells in the mucosal membrane of the nasal cavity<br>
are    activated    without    causing    inflammation,    virus    antigens    are<br>
incorporated into the cells in good efficiency, and also anti-virus IgA<br>
production   by   the   mucosal   membrane   is   induced   effectively   and<br>
preferentially, and further selectively -without causing induction of IgG<br>
production in the mucosal membrane or blood.<br>
(2)	In addition, it has been found that by adding to and mixing a complex<br>
of the combination of SP-B and SP-C, and phospholipid, or a complex of<br>
the combination of synthetic peptides of both fragments of SP-B and SP-C<br>
comprising lipid-soluble region thereof (active region), and lipid membrane<br>
(aforesaid AD vehicle), with influenza virus split antigen which is used as<br>
safe  inactivated vaccine  antigen conventionally,  selective  induction  of<br>
secretory   IgA   production   is   achieved   with   the   activation   of   the<br>
antigen-presenting cells sufficiently reinforced and supplemented, which is<br>
poor in independent  split antigen compared with  live vaccine, while<br>
maintaining high safety of the split antigen.<br>
3.   Process of completing the above-mentioned findings<br>
(1)  The present inventors have  studied  extensively to  elucidate  the<br><br>
mechanism of the development of influenza, and a treatment and prevention method for influenza. During the process, it has been elucidated that pulmonary surfactant adsorbs and inactivates tryptase clara of hemagglutinin (HA) processing protease of the respiratory tract, which manifests virus membrane infusion activity and infectious ability by restrictive cleavage of HA of the influenza virus membrane protein, resulting in inhibiting the growth cycle of the virus.<br>
(2)	As a result of continuous study, it has been found that in addition to<br>
the actions described above, the pulmonary surfactant selectively activates<br>
mucosal    antigen-presenting    cells,    and    thus    activates    immunity<br>
performance against virus antigen, leading to induction of secretory IgA,<br>
but not leading to induction of IgG.   Furthermore, it has been shown that<br>
SP-B and SP-C are important as well as the lipid ingredient, as active<br>
ingredients reinforcing mucosal immunity in the pulmonary surfactant.<br>
The active region of these protein ingredients has been specified, and the<br>
efficacy of mucosal immunity reinforcement has been evaluated,<br>
(3)	Furthermore,  studies have been progressed in view of a biological<br>
defense substance in the mucosal membrane of the respiratory tract, and<br>
defense against virus infection as described above, and it has been proved<br>
that the pulmonary surfactant, which is secreted in the living body, is<br>
involved in selective induction of IgA production as mucosal immunity<br>
adjuvant derived from the living body.<br>
(4)	Studies  have  continued  giving  attention  to  the  fact that  (a)   the<br>
pulmonary surfactant, which is originally physiologically active substance<br>
in the living body, has property of adsorbing specific bio-substance (Kido<br>
H., et al. FEBS Lett. Pulmonary surfactant is a potential endogenous<br>
inhibitor of proteolytic activation of Sendai virus and influenza A virus, 322<br><br>
(29), 115-119, 1992), (b) the pulmonary surfactant is secreted from alveolar type II cell or clara cell, and then selectively incorporated into macrophage (Akira Suwabe, J. Jpn. Med. Soc. Biol. Interface; Surfactant metabolism disorder in alveolar proteinemia, 33, 10-13, 2002), and (c) the pulmonary surfactant is incorporated and metabolized in analogous cells, for example, antigen-presenting cells (dentritic cells).<br>
As a result, it has been found that only SP-B and SP-C among the protein ingredients, and lipid ingredients of the pulmonary surfactant, function as the "AD vehicle" of mucosal vaccine which selectively induces IgA production, and that the active ingredient region of SP-B or active domain of mucosal immunity induction is a peptide comprising the following arnino acid sequences:<br>
SP-B 214-225: Leu lie Lys Arg lie Gin Ala Met He Pro Lys Gly (SEQ ID No. 7); and<br>
SP-B 257-266: Leu Leu Asp Thr Leu Leu Gly Arg Met Leu (SEQ ID No. 8).<br>
In addition, it has been found that the active ingredient region of SP-C or active domain of mucosal immunity induction is a peptide comprising the following araino acid sequences:<br>
SP-C 29-58: Cys Pro Val His Leu Lys Arg Leu Leu lie Val Val Val Val Val Val Leu He Val Val Val He Val Gly Ala Leu Leu Met Gly Leu (SEQ ID No-9)-<br>
(5) In addition, it has been found as the mechanism of selective IgA induction that the active ingredients of the pulmonary surfactant effectively conduct antigen presentation of T-lymphocytc by inducing increased expression of MHC Class II, CD40 and B7-2 of antigen-presenting dendritic cells, and in addition, promote class switch to<br><br>
IgA-producing   B-lymphocyte   by   inducing   eytokine   TGF-P1   of  a   local mucosal membrane.<br>
4. The objects of the present invention completed based on the findings and the details described above are as follows:<br>
(1)	The first object is to establish a mucosal immunity method.     By<br>
providing the "AD vehicle" and using it, the present invention achieves<br>
selective induction of production of antigen-specific IgA, which is an active<br>
substance of mucosal immunity, and also establishes induction of safe and<br>
effective (with no adverse effects) mucosal immunity, and a method thereof.<br>
(2)	The second object is to improve qualities related to safety, efficacy and<br>
uniformity of the AD vehicle by use of a synthetic peptide.   The present<br>
invention provides a complex (the AD vehicle), which is prepared with a<br>
synthetic peptide of active domain of SP-B mucosal immunity induction<br>
(comprising each amino acid sequence of SP-B 214-225 and SP-B 257-266<br>
described above), a synthetic peptide of active domain of SP-C mucosal<br>
immunity induction (comprising each amino acid sequence of SP-C 29-58<br>
described above), a synthetic analogue thereof, a long-chain synthetic<br>
peptide comprising these amino acid sequence as a part, and the like, and<br>
a lipid ingredient of the pulmonary surfactant, and improves the quality of<br>
the AD vehicle.<br>
(3)	The third object is conversion of conventional subcutaneous inoculation<br>
of vaccine to mucosal administration.   The present invention employs the<br>
AD vehicle in inactivated vaccine of respiratory tract-infection virus, for<br>
example, inactivated vaccine of influenza, SARS, the measles, rubella,<br>
mumps, and the like, and inactivated vaccine of intestinal tract-infection<br>
virus, for example, inactivated vaccine of rotavirus, poliovirus, and the like,<br>
and converts subcutaneous inoculation vaccine thereof to mucosal vaccine.<br><br>
(4)	The fourth object is to provide a method of using the AD vehicle in<br>
inactivated vaccine against virus infection via mucosal membrane except<br>
for the respiratory tract and the intestinal tract, for example, inactivated<br>
vaccine against AIDS, Type B hepatitis, Type C hepatitis, and the like.<br>
(5)	The fifth object is to provide a method of using the AD vehicle in DNA<br>
vaccine, live vaccine, prevention and treatment of allergy, and the like.<br>
(6)	The sixth object is to provide a method of using the AD vehicle in<br>
traasdermal inoculation (application, pasting, and the like) as an immunity<br>
route which can induce IgA besides the mucosal membrane.<br>
(7)	The seventh object is to open a way of use and application of the AD<br>
vehicle   in   agriculture,   fishery,   and   the   like,   not   only   in   DDS   or<br>
pharmaceutics.<br>
The AD vehicle provided by the present invention, has different performances and actions from adjuvants which have been used conventionally in immunology as follows: Specifically, conventional adjuvants are inoculated usually subcutaneously or intramuscularly, causing local inflammation reaction and attracting antigen-presenting cells or B- and T-lymphocytes, and has a foreign substance exerting its ability as active ingredient. In addition, they are used in combination -with mineral oil or metal salt causing sustained-release and retention of antigen to maintain inflammation reaction over long time. In addition, those known as conventional mucosal vaccine/adjuvants are as described above, and a foreign substance such as Escherichia coli heat-labile live toxin and cholera toxin, and has risk of causing harmful actions or adverse actions. On the contrary, the AD vehicle according to the present invention, causes<br><br>
no local inflammation reaction. In addition, the AD vehicle is derived from biological ingredient, and on top of that, it is limited to active ingredient in the pulmonary surfactant or an active domain thereof, and uses low-molecular-weight peptide comprising such domain or domain region to achieve effective mucosal vaccine. Accordingly, the AD vehicle is very safe and non-invasive.<br>

6.   Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be explained. (1) Composition of the AD vehicle<br>
Followings are dry wt.% of the three groups of the above-mentioned Group I (group of pulmonary surfactant protein B, and natural and synthetic polypcptide derived or originated from the protein B), Group II (group of pulmonary surfactant protein C, and natural and synthetic polypeptide derived or originated from the protein C) and Group III (group of lipid such as phospholipid, fatty acid, and the like): about 0.1 to about 6.0 wt.% of Group I, about 0.1 to about 6.0 wt.% of Group II and about 88 to about 99.8 wt.% of Group IIH. hi preparation of the antigen-drug vehicle, the composition is adjusted to Group 1% + Group 11% + Group 100% by wt.%.<br>
(2) Preparation of the AD vehicle<br>
Preparation procedures are as follows, for example; 2 mg of Group I, 2 mg of Group II and 96 mg of Group III are weighed, respectively (Group 1% + Group 11% + Group III%=100% by wt.%), which are suspended uniformly in 5 ml isotonic solution, for example, physiological saline solution or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Resultant suspension is given to use as a solution of the antigen-drug vehicle (100 mg/5 ml). The vehicle is prepared in each use. For suspension, ultrasonic -wave, homogenizer, mixer, shaker, and the like can be used. The ultrasonic wave is likely to cause liquid change (increase of viscosity) by excessive treatment, and thus, a mixer, for example, box mixer (e.g., Vortex mixer (trademark)) is preferably used.<br>
For specification of 96 mg of the lipid of Group III, for example, a<br><br>
mixture of 71 mg of phosphatidyl choline, 21 mg of phosphatidylglycerol and 4 mg of phosphatidyl serine, and the like can be adopted (the total of the lipid amount is 96 mg). In addition, in case of using marketed pulmonary surfactant preparation for RDS treatment, which is ensured to contain SP-B and SP-C excluding SP-A and SP-D, the suspension prepared in accordance to the instruction manual, can be given to use as it is or as a solution of the antigen-drug vehicle.<br>
(3)	Preparation of rmacosal vaccine<br>
A mucosal vaccine is prepared by adding to and mixing the solution of the antigen-drug vehicle with an undiluted vaccine solution that the dry-weight ratio of the amount of the antigen-drug vehicle (V) to the amount of antigen in the vaccine (A) becomes about 0.2 to about 5. For example, if the antigen content is 1 jtg/ml in 1,000 ml of the vaccine undiluted solution, and the weight ratio adopted is A/V-1, the addition and mixing amount of the solution of the antigen-drug vehicle (100 mg/S ml), which has been prepared in the above-mentioned (2), is 50 yl. For uniform mixing, homogenizer, mixer, shaker, stirrer, and the like can be used.<br>
(4)	Preparation of transmucosal or transdermal DDS<br>
The transmucosal or transdermal DDS can be prepared by using a drug instead of an antigen in the same manner as in the above-mentioned (3).<br>
Examples<br>
Hereinafter, the constitution and effects of the present invention will be explained in detail by showing Examples. However, this invention is not limited only to these examples, explanation and description.<br><br>
Raw materials, experimental procedures, and the like used in these examples are as follows.<br>
(1)	Pulmonary surfactant<br>
The pulmonary surfactant used as the "antigen-drug vehicle (the AD vehicle) is a sample prepared from bovine lung by the method of Howgood, ct aL (PSF-1J (Howgood 3, et al.,: Effects of a surfactant-associated protein and calcium ions on the structure and surface activity of lung surfactant lipids. Biochemistry, 24, 184-190, 1985), or largely a sample prepared by extracting the former sample with 1-butanol to remove water-soluble protein ingredients, SP-A and SP-D, or reduce them to detection limit or less {PSF-2J (Haagasman HP, et al.,: The major lung surfactant protein, SP28-36, is a calcium-dependent, carbohydrate binding protein, J. Biol. Chem. 262, 13977-13880, 1987),and further any synthetic pcptide of the active regions of the h'pid-sohible proteins, SP-B or SP-C, which contains 40 wt.% or more to the whole of phospholipid comprising mainly phosphatidyl choline and dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline, and further contains 10 to 20% of phosphatidylglycerol and 2 to 5% of phosphatidyl serine, which are similar to the pulmonary surfactant lipid, or a sample containing 0 to 3,5% of both peptides in combination. Among these samples, investigated were a sample containing both peptides in combination of the active regions of SP-B and SP-C (PSF-3), a sample containing a synthetic peptide of the active region of SP-B IPSF-4) and a sample containing a synthetic peptide of the active region of SP-C (PSF-5). Alternatively, known samples corresponding to PSF-1 or PSF-2, for example, Survanta, Infasurf, Curosurf, Humansurf, Exosurf, Alveofact, and the like (trademark) are also used.<br>
(2)	Animal<br><br>
6 week-old female BALB/c mouse, and 10 week-old Hartley guinea pig were purchased from Japan SLC, Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan) and used. All of the animal experiments were conducted in the cage for infected animals (P2 level) of the experimental animal center of the medical faculty of University of Tokushima, and conducted in accordance of the guideline of the animal experiment committee of the medical faculty of University of Tokushima.<br>
(3) Preparation of split-type influenza vaccine<br>
Preparation of split-type influenza vaccine was conducted with the following procedures using the suspension derived from a grown egg where the influenza virus, A Aichi/68/2/H3N2 strain was inoculated (1 x 10* Plaque forming unit [PFU]) (supplied by Professor Masanobu Ouchi in microbiology class of Kawasaki medical school), p-propiolactone (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) was added to the virus suspension, which was dialyzcd in 0.004 M PBS (TakaraBio, Inc., Shiga, Tokyo, Japan) overnight, to 0.05% of the liquid amount and 8 nM of the final concentration, and incubated for 18 hours in an ice bath. Then, it was incubated for 1.5 hours at 37°C to hydrolyze the p-propiolactone. Then, Tween 20 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) was added to 0.1% of the final concentration, and diethylether (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) was further added in the equal amount to that of Tween, and mixed with shaking for two hours at 4'C. This solution was centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 minutes to collect the aqueous layer. Furthermore, removal of diethylether was conducted from the aqueous layer with Automatic Environmental SpeedVac System (SAVANT INSTRUMENTS, INC., New York, USA). This was filtered with a 0.45 jim filter (M1LLIPORE, Massachusetts, USA), to prepare inactivated split-type influenza vaccine.<br><br>
(4) Immunization<br>
To the split-type influenza vaccine prepared by the production method described above were mixed and used the above-mentioned pulmonary surfactant (PSF-I), 1-butanol extracted pulmonary surfactant (PSF-2J, the synthetic peptides of the active regions of SP-B and SP-C and the pulmonary surfactant lipid (PSF-3, -4 and -5), known pulmonary surfactant product, or cholera toxin B subunit {CTB, SIGMA, Missouri, USA) as an immune adjuvant. The pulmonary surfactant or the corresponding sample described above was suspended in PBS in situ at a concentration required in vaccine administration, and treated with ultrasonic wave for 5 minutes at room temperature to give a uniform suspension. To this was added 0.1 fig of the split-type influenza vaccine to 0.1 ng by dry weight of the pulmonary surfactant or the corresponding sample, and mixed in a vortex mixer, and left for 1 hour at room temperature to be used. CTB was adjusted in situ in the similar manner, and mixed in 0.1 ng to 0.1 jig of the split-type influenza vaccine (Watanabe I, et al.,: Characterization of protective immune responses induced by nasal influenza vaccine containing mutant cholera toxin as a safe Adjuvant (CT112K). Vaccine 2002; 20: 3443-55).<br>
For nasal administration of the vaccine, the above-mentioned adjusted product was diluted in PBS to be a 0.1 ug/1 jil solution of Phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and this was administered to both sides by 1 nl, respectively per one animal and 2 pi in total was nasal-administered to both sides of the nasal cavities of the mouse anesthetized with ether. For conventional subcutaneous injection, which was conducted for comparison, the split-type influenza vaccine was diluted in PBS to be a solution of 0.1 M-g/50 pi, and this was administered to the hypoderma of the mouse neck. For the control group, PBS was administered in the same amount as that of the vaccine solution. After 4<br><br>
weeks, second immunization was carried out in the same manner as the first immunization, and two weeks after the second immunization, the washing solutions of the nasal cavity and the alveoli, and the serum of the mouse, were prepared, which were used in measurement of virus-specific IgA and IgG, and virus infection experiment.<br>
[5)	Preparation of the washing solutions of the nasal cavity and the alveoli,<br>
and the serum of the mouse<br>
The vaccine-administered mouse was cut open in the abdomen and the chest under pentobarbital anesthesia, and the trachea was cut open, and Atom venous catheter tapered 3 Fr (Atom medical Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted into the lung, and 1 ml of physiological saline solution was infused, and this solution was collected. This was repeated three times, and the collected solution, 3 ml in total was used as the washing solution of the alveoli. After collecting the washing solution of the alveoli, the atom vein catheter was inserted from the opened trachea to the direction of the nasal cavity, and 1 ml of physiological saline solution was infused, and the solution coming from the nose was collected. This solution was used as the washing solution of the nose. Furthermore, blood collecting was conducted from the heart, and the serum was prepared by centrifuge at 5,000 rpm for 10 minutes.<br>
(6)	Quantization of protein<br>
The protein content in the washing solutions of the nose and the lung, and the serum was measured with BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit (PIERCE, Illinois, USA) (Smith PK., et aL,: Measurement of protein using bicinchoninic acid. Anal. Biochem., 150, 76-85, 1985). Absorbance at 562 nm was measured with SPECTRAmax PLUS 384 (Molecular Devices Corporation, California, USA).<br><br>
(7)	Experiment for virus infection and evaluation for infection value.<br>
The influenza virus strain, A Aichi/68/2/H3N2 strain, which is the same as the virus strain used in the preparation of the split-type influenza vaccine, was used in infection. Two weeks after completion of the second immunization, the mouse was anesthetized with ether, and a suspension derived from an egg where the influenza virus was grown, was dropped for infection into both sides of the nasal cavities in 7 x 1O4 PFU/3 pi. 3 weeks after the infection, the washing solutions of the nasal cavity and the alveoli were prepared in the same manner as described above, which were used in evaluation of virus infection value. The evaluation of virus infection value was conducted using A 549 cells (supplied by Professor Masanobu Ouchi in microbiology class of Kawasaki medical school). A 549 cells were incubated under the condition of 5% bovine fetal serum/DMEM (Gibco, New York, USA). A 549 cell? were subcultured to be 100% confluent in 6 well-incubation plate (Greiner Deutsche Stuttgart), and changed to no-serum medium after 24 hours. The washing solutions of the nasal cavity and the alveoli of influenza infection mouse were dropped in 500 pi, respectively to each well, and incubated in COa incubator at 37°C for 12 hours to 16 hours. To this was added the 1% PBS solution of erythrocyte, which was collected from the guinea pig, and the mixture was left for 5 minutes at room temperature. The mixture was washed with 1 mM Ca'VMg2* PBS, and evaluation of virus infection value was conducted by counting the cell agglutinating erythrocyte as a virus infection cell (Tashiro M., Homma M.: Pneumotropism of Sendai virus in relation to protease-mediated activation in mouse lungs. Infect. Immun. 39, 879-888, 1983).<br>
(8)	Purification of anti-influenza specific IgA and IgG<br>
Purification of anti-influenza specific IgA and IgG was conducted as follows to be used as standard for quantitization in ELISA assay.    IgG<br><br>
fractions were purified from the lung-washing solutions of the influenza vaccine-administered and virus-infected mice by affinity chromatography with recombinant E. coli expression Protein G cephalose 4B column (ZYMED LABORTORIES INC, San Francisco, USA). Anti-mouse IgA goat IgG (SIGMA) was bound to BrCN-activated cephalose 4B column (Amersham Bioscience, New Jersey, USA), and using this, IgA fractions were purified by affinity chromatography from the Protein G passing-through fraction. To purify virus-specific antibody from these IgG and IgA fractions, inactivated split-type influenza vaccine used in immunization was bound to BrCN activated cephalose column, and anti-influenza specific IgA and IgG were purified, respectively by antigen affinity chromatography from the IgG and IgA fractions using this. Coupling of the split-type influenza protein as a ligand to the column was carried out by the binding reaction with 0.1 M NaHCO3/0.5 M NaCl buffer solution (pH 8.5), and removing the free ligand with 0.1 M acetic acid/0.5 M NaCl buffer solution (pH 8.5) and neutralizing by PBS (pH 7,5). After affinity-binding reaction by PBS (pH 7.5) and removal of free antibody, each of the affinity chromatography was subjected to clution of the specific antibody by glycine-HCl buffer solution (pH 2.8). Eluted fractions were neutralized immediately fay 0.5 M Tris HC1 buffer solution (pH 9.0), and dialyzed with MilliQ water and lyophilized, which was used as dissolved in PBS in situ.<br>
(9) Quantitization of anti-influenza antibody<br>
Contents of anti-influenza IgA and IgG in the washing solutions of the nasal cavity and the alveoli, and the serum, were quantitized by ELISA assay. The ELISA assay was carried out according to the method of Mouse ELISA Quantitization kit of BETHYL LABORATORIES (Texas, USA). To each well of 96 well Nunc immunoplate (Nalgen Nunc International, New York, USA), 1 jig of the vaccine and 100 jil of 1 ng/ml PBS solution of<br><br>
bovine serum albumin {BSA, SIGMA, Missouri, USA) were added, and reaction for layer-solidification was conducted at 4°C overnight. Then, each well was washed three times with the washing solution (50 mM Tris, 0.14 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0) to remove the vaccine solution. To each well was added 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer solution containing 0.15 M NaCl and 1% BSA, and the blocking reaction was carried out at room temperature for 1 hour. Each well was washed three times with the washing solution, and then added were 100 jil of the washing solutions of the nasal cavity and the alveoli, and the eerum, which had been diluted with a suitable amount of a sample-binding buffer solution (50 mM Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0), and the mixture was left for reaction at room temperature for 2 hours. Color reaction was conducted with TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate System (Kirkegaard &amp; Perry Laboratories, Inc. Maryland, USA), using Goat anti-mouse IgA or IgG-horse rADish peroxidase (HRP) (BETHYL LABORATORIES INC.) as secondary antibody. The reaction was terminated by adding 100 ul of 2 M HjSO« (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) to each well, and absorbance at 450 nm was measured with SPECTRAmax PLUS 384. Anti-influenza 10 ng of IgA and IgG purified from the above-mentioned lung-washing solution was treated in the same manner as a standard for quantization, and obtained absorbance was used.<br>
(10) Preparation of dendritic cells and flow cytometry<br>
Preparation of dendritic cells was carried out from the nose, lung and spleen collected from the mice of each group (4 in one group) 2 days after the first immunization, by the method of Gonzalez-Juarrero M (Gonzalez-Juarrero M, Orme IM.: Characterization of murine lung dendritic cells infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Infect Immun. 2001; 69: 1127-33). Preparation of dendritic cells from the nose and collagenase treatment therefor was conduced according to the method of Asanuma H,<br><br>
et al. (Asanuma H, et al.,: Characterization of mouse nasal lymphocytes isolated by enzymatic extraction with collagenase. J. Immunol. Methods 1995; 187: 41-51). The dendritic cells prepared from each of the tissues, were washed with 1 mM EDTA/PBS, and added per 10* cells were each 1 ug/ml of FITC conjugated Anti-IA/IE (MHC class II) and PE conjugated Anti CD40 or FITC conjugated Anti-CD80 (B7-1) and PE conjugated Anti CD86 (B7-2) (BD Bioscience, New Jersey, USA), and left for reaction for 30 minutes on the ice as 50 lil 1 nxM EDTA/PBS suspension. Free antibody was removed by conducting washing twice with 1 ml of 1 mM EDTA/PBS, and the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of 1 mM EDTA/PBS. Using this, detection for the modification factor on the cell surface was conducted by BD FACS Callibur (BD Bioscience).<br>
(11)	Quantitization of TGF-01<br>
Secretion amount of TGF-pl in the washing solutions of the nasal cavity and the alveoli was quantitized by ELISA assay. The ELISA assay was conducted using TGF-pl ELISA kit (BIOSOURCE INTERNATIONAL, California, USA) according to the instruction attached to the kit.<br>
(12)	Quantitization of various cytokines<br>
The amounts of cytokines secreted, respectively in the washing solutions of the nasal cavity and the alveoli and from the lymphocytes of the spleen (Interleukin 4: IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-13), were quantitized by marketed ELISA kit.<br>
(13)	Preparation of PSF-3 comprising synthetic peptides of SP-B and SP-C<br>
and phospholipid<br>
Each peptide of SP-B 253-278 (SEQ ID No. 16) and SP-C 24-58 (SEQ ID No. 21) was chemically synthesized by known method. These peptides were added to a phospholipid membrane (dipalmitoyl<br><br>
phosphatidyl choline (75), phoephatidylglycerol (25) and palmitic acid (10)) to prepare a phospholipid membrane of plate form, and AD vehicle PSF-3 was prepared.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Comparison of nasal influenza vaccine and subcutaneous-injection influenza vaccine on virus growth inhibition action<br>
As the nasal vaccine, 0.1 ng of the split-type influenza vaccine was administered to both noses of BALB/c mouse by 1 fjH, respectively as a PBS solution, alone or with 0.1 jig of 1-butanol-extracted (excluding SP-A and SP-D) surfactant (PSF-2 below) as the "AD vehicle", or 0.1 jig of CTB. As the subcutaneous-injection vaccine, the vaccine in the same amount as that of the nasal vaccine was administered as 50 jil PBS solution in total to the hypoderma of the neck of BALB/c mouse, alone or with adding PSF-2 as the AD vehicle or CTB as an adjuvant. After 4 weeks, second immunization was conducted in the same manner as in the first immunization. To the control group, same amount of PBS was administered, respectively. 2 weeks after the second immunization, influenza virus of 6.6 x 104 PFU was subjected to nasal infection as 3 (il PBS solution. 3 days after the infection, the mouse was slaughtered, and the washing solutions of the nasal caviiy and the alveoli were prepared, and using this, evaluation of virus infection value was conducted (n=15-20; average±SE; *, the significance level by T-test was p
As shown in Figs. 1 (a) and (b), in case of nasal influenza vaccine administration, growth of the influenza virus in the washing solutions of the nasal cavity and the alveoli was inhibited even by the independent vaccine administration, but PSF-2 or CTB reinforced the effects significantly and growth of the influenza was nearly perfectly inhibited,<br><br>
ensuring the effects of the vaccine. Though now shown in the figure, in the case of using PSP-1 or PSF-3 instead of PSF-2, similar effects were obtained. Similar phenomena were also found for PSF-4 and -5, but the effects were attenuated.<br>
Though now shown in the figure, even in case that PSF-2 or CTB were nasally administered as independent, respectively in the first immunization and the second immunization, inhibitory effects for virus growth were not found in either case, and thus the effects of PSF-2 or CTB were determined as reinforcement effects for the vaccine effects.<br>
On the other hand, in case of subcutaneous-injection influenza vaccine, as shown in (c) and (d) of Fig. 1, the titer (PFU) of the influenza virus in the washing solutions of the nasal cavity and the alveoli was reduced significantly even with the independent vaccine, so the effects of the vaccine was found, but reinforcement effects of P3F-2 or CTB were not found. In other words, in case of subcutaneous administration, nearly no or very little reinforcement effects of PSF-2 or CTB on immunity were found. Though now shown in the figure in this experiment, even in case that PSF-2 or CTB is subcutaneously administered as independent, respectively in the first immunization and the second immunization, inhibitory effects for virus growth were not found in either case. Though now shown in the figure, in the case of using PSF-1, PSF-3, PSF-4 and PSF-5 instead of PSF-2, reinforcement effects on the vaccine action were not found.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Influence of PSF-2 or CTB OJD production of anti-influenza specific<br>
antibodies (IgA and IgG) in the washing solution of the nasal cavity<br>
after (a) nasal and (b) subcutaneous-injection influenza vaccine<br>
administration<br>
In the same manner as described in Fig. 1, as the nasal vaccine,<br><br>
0.1 jag of the split-type influenza vaccine was administered to both noses of BALB/c mouse by 1 fil, respectively, i.e., 2 ul in total as a PBS solution, alone or with 0.1 jig of PSF-2 as the "AD vehicle", or 0.1 jig of CTB as an adjuvant. As the subcutaneous vaccine, the vaccine in the same amount as that of the nasal vaccine, PSF-2 or CTB was administered as 50 pi PBS solution to the hypodenna of the neck of BALB/c mouse. After 4 weeks, second immunization was conducted in the same manner as in the first immunization. To the control group, same amount of PBS -was administered, respectively. 2 weeks after the second immunization, influenza virus of 6.6 x 104 PFU was subjected to nasal infection as 3 jj.1 PBS solution. 3 days after the infection, the mouse was slaughtered, and the washing solution of the nasal cavity was prepared, and using this, evaluation of virus infection value was conducted (n=15-20; average±SE; *, the significance level by T-test was p
The results are shown in Figs. 2 (a) and (b). By the split-type influenza vaccine nasally administered, anti-influenza specific IgA -was selectively produced in the nasal cavity, and thus increased in the washing solution, but PSF-2 or CTB increased the amount of this specific IgA in equivalent extent remarkably. On the other hand, even in case of the subcutaneous injection, increase of specific IgA amount in the washing solution of the nasal cavity by independent split-type influenza vaccine was found, but the extent was low compared to that of the nasal administration. In addition, in case of the subcutaneous injection of the vaccine, immunity reinforcement effects of PSF-2 or CTB were not found in either case in production of IgA or IgG. Though now shown in the figure, in the case of using PSF-1 or PSF-3 instead of PSF-2, similar effects were obtained. Similar phenomena were also found for PSF-4 and -5, but the effects were attenuated.<br><br>

Influence of PSF-2 or CTB on production of anti-influenza specific<br>
antibodies (IgA and IgG) in the washing solution of the lung by<br>
influenza vaccine of (a) nasal administration and (b)<br>
subcutaneous-injection<br>
As the nasal vaccine, 0.1 ug of the split-type influenza vaccine was administered to both noses of BALB/c mouse by 1 nl, respectively, i.e., 2 fil in total as a PBS solution, alone or with 0.1 fag of PSF-2 as the "AD vehicle", or 0.1 jig of CTB as an adjuvant. As the subcutaneous vaccine, the vaccine in the same amount as that of the nasal vaccine, PSF-2 or CTB was administered as 50 ^1 PBS solution to the hypoderma of the neck of BALB/c mouse. After 4 weeks, second immunization was conducted in the same manner as in the first immunization. To the control group, same amount of PBS was administered, respectively. 2 weeks after the second immunization, influenza virus of 6.6 x 10* PFU was subjected to nasal infection as 3 (al PBS solution. 3 days after the infection, the mouse was slaughtered, and the washing solution of the lung was prepared, and using this, influence of the antigen-drug vehicle on production of anti-influenza specific antibodies {IgA and IgG) was investigated (n= 15-20; average±SE; *, the significance level by T-test was p
As shown in Figs. 3 (a) and (b), promoting effects of PSF-2 or CTB on production of anti-influenza specific antibodies were remarkable, similarly to the case of nasal administration of the vaccine, and there was no big difference between them. This immunity reinforcement effects were specific for IgA, and not found for IgG. In case of the subcutaneous injection, increase of IgA in the washing solution of the lung, but immunity reinforcement effects of PSF-2 or CTB were not found similarly to the case of the washing solution of the nasal cavity. Though now shown in the<br><br>
figure in this experiment, even in case that PSF-2 or CTB was administered nasally or subcutaneously as independent, respectively in the first immunization and the second immunization, increase of virus-specific IgA or IgG in the washing solution of the lung was not found in either case, and thus the effects of PSF-2 or CTB were determined as reinforcement effects for the vaccine actions. Though now shown in the figure, in the case of using PSF-1 or PSF-3 instead of PSF-2, similar effects were obtained. Similar phenomena were also found for PSF-4 and -5, but the effects were attenuated.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Influence of PSF-2 or CTB on production of anti-influenza specific<br>
antibodies (IgA and IgG) in the blood by influenza vaccine of (a) nasal<br>
administration and (b) subcutaneous-injection<br>
As the nasal vaccine, 0.1 ng of the split-type influenza vaccine was administered to both noses of BALB/c mouse by 1 jil, respectively, i.e., 2 fri in total as a PBS solution, alone or with 0.1 ng of PSF-2 as the "AD vehicle", or 0.1 pg of CTB as an adjuvant. As the subcutaneous vaccine, the vaccine in the same amount as that of the nasal vaccine, PSF-2 or CTB was administered as SO pi PBS solution to the hypoderma of the neck of BALB/c mouse. After 4 weeks, second immunization was conducted in the same manner as hi the first immunization. To the control group, same amount of PBS was administered, respectively. 2 weeks after the second immunization, the mouse was slaughtered, blood collection from the heart was conducted, and the serum was prepared from this, and quantitization of the expression amount of anti-influenza antibodies was conducted using this (n= 15-20; average±SE).<br>
As shown in Figs. 4 (a) and (b), for the production amount of blood anti-influenza antibodies  IgA  (white  bar)  and  IgG   (black  bar),   slight<br><br>
increase of IgA or IgG was found in nasal vaccine administration, but increase of IgA or IgG by PSF-2 or CTB was not found, and thus immunity reinforcement effects were not found. On the other hand, in case of the subcutaneous injection, remarkable increase of IgG and definite increase of IgA were found by the split-type influenza vaccine, but also in this case, increase of antibody production by PSF-2 or CTB was not found and thus immunity reinforcement effects were not found. Particularly, in case of the subcutaneous injection, IgG increased specifically in blood. In the case of using PSP-1 instead of PSF-2, nearly similar effects were obtained {not shown in the figure).<br>
In addition, even in case that PSF-2 or CTB was administered nasally or subcutaneously as independent, respectively in the first immunization and the second immunization, increase of virus-specific IgA or IgG in blood was not found, and thus the effects of PSF-2 or CTB were determined as reinforcement effects for the vaccine actions (not shown in the figure).<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Influence of PSF-2 or CTB on antigen-presenting ability of dendritic<br>
cells of the nose, Inng or spleen by influenza vaccine of (a) nasal<br>
administration and (b) subcutaneous-injection<br>
As the nasal vaccine, 0.1 ng of the split-type influenza vaccine was administered to both noses of BALB/c mouse in 2 jil in total as 1 |il PBS solution, alone or with 0.1 ^g of PSF-2, or 0.1 ng of CTB. As the subcutaneous vaccine, the split-type influenza vaccine in the same amount as that of the nasal vaccine, PSF-2 or CTB was administered as 50 jil PBS solution to the hypoderma of the neck of BALB/c mouse. After 2 days, the mouse was slaughtered, and the dendritic cells were prepared from the nose, lung or spleen, and expression level of MHC class II, CD40, B7-1<br><br>
(CD80) and B7-2 (CD80) on the cell surface was measured by flow cytometry.<br>
As a result, increase of expression of antigen-presenting related molecules, CD40 and B7-2 was found on the membrane surface of the dendritic cells (antigen-presenting cells) in the nose, where the vaccine had been challenged "by CTB, and adjuvants effects were found in molecular level. In case of PSF-2, increase of expression of MHC II molecule was also found in addition to CD4O and B7-2 of the dendritic cells in the nose, and it was shown that at least three molecules of the dendritic cells are involved in the immunity reinforcement effects.<br>
However, definite change was not found in CD40, B7-2 or MHC II molecule of the dendritic cells in the lung and spleen. In the case of using PSF-1 or PSF-3 instead of PSF-2, nearly similar effects were obtained. Similar phenomena were also found for PSF-4 and -5, but the effects were attenuated.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Influence of SPF-2 or CTB on TGF-J31 secretion level in the mucosal<br>
membrane of (a) the nasal cavity and (b) the alveoli by nasal<br>
administration of influenza vaccine<br>
As the nasal vaccine, 0.1 pg of the split-type influenza vaccine was administered to both noses of BALB/c mouse in 2 \il in total as 1 nl PBS solution, alone or with 0.1 ng of SPF-2, or 0.1 ng of CTB. As the subcutaneous vaccine, the vaccine in the same amount as that of the nasal vaccine, PSF-2 or CTB was administered as 50 pi PBS solution to the hypoderma of the neck of BALB/c mouse. After 4 weeks, second immunization was conducted in the same manner as in the first immunization. To the control group, same amount of PBS was administered, respectively. 2 weeks after the second immunization, the<br><br>
mouse was slaughtered, and the washing solution of the nasal cavity was prepared, and using this, quantization of TGF-01 secretion amount was conducted (n= 15-20; averagetSE; *, the significance level by T-teet was p
It has been known that for differentiation of B cell to IgA-production cell (class switch), local TGF-(31 concentration present in the production cell is important (Stavnezer, J.: Regulation of antibody production and class switching by TGF-beta. J. Immunol. 155(4), 1647-1651, 1995). Herein, TGF-fJl concentration in a local mucosal membrane of (a) the nasal cavity or (b) the alveoli was investigated.<br>
The TGF-01 concentration in the local mucosal membrane of the nasal cavity or the alveoli where the split-type influenza vaccine was administered, increased significantly in presence of SPF-2 or CTB. The extent of increase was such that there was no significant difference between SPF-2 and CTB. The results are shown in Figs. 5 (a) and (b). It was found that SPF-2, which was derived from the living body, increased TGF-pl concentration which urges promotion of differentiation of B cell secreting IgA as much as CTB, which is exogenous toxin. Though not shown in the figure, in the case of using PSF-1 or PSF-3 instead of PSF-2, nearly similar effects were obtained. Similar phenomena were also found for PSF-4 and -5, but the effects were attenuated. In addition, even in case that PSF-2 or CTB was administered nasally or subcutaneously as independent, respectively in the first immunization and the second immunization, increase of TGF-J31 concentration was not found, and thus the effects of PSF-2 or CTB were determined as reinforcement effects for the vaccine actions (not shown in the figure).<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Influence of PSF-2 or CTB on production of anti-influenza specific antibodies (IgA and IgG) in (a) the nasal cavity, (b) the alveoli and (c)<br><br>
the blood by nasal administration of influenza vaccine<br>
As the nasal vaccine, 0.2 ng of the split-type influenza vaccine was administered to both noses of BALB/c mouse by 1 \il, respectively, i.e., 2 M* in total as a PBS solution, alone or with 0.2 ng of PSF-2 as the "AD vehicle", or 0.2 |Jg of CTB as an adjuvant. After 4 weeks, second immunization was conducted in the same manner as in the first immunization. To the control group, same amount of PBS was administered, respectively. 2 weeks after the second immunization, the mouse was slaughtered in each group, and the washing solutions of the nasal cavity and the alveoli, and serum by blood collection from the heart were prepared, and using these, quantitization of expression amount of anti-influenza antibody was conducted (n= 15-30; average±SE; +, p
As shown in Figs. 6 (a) and (b), in the washing solutions of the nasal cavity and the alveoli, blood anti-influenza antibody IgA (blue circlet) showed remarkable increase in case that PSF-2 and the vaccine were administered. However, as shown in Fig. 6 (c), increase of IgQ (red circlet) hi blood was not found.<br>
On the other hand, in case that CTB and the vaccine were administered, IgG and IgG increased in the washing solutions of the nasal cavity and the alveoli (Figs. 6 (a) and (b)), and also remarkably in blood (Fig. 6 (c)).<br>
As described above, in case of CTB, it reacted with the antigen inoculated nasally, and caused systemic immune response, as well as establishment of local immunity, as reported conventionally. On the other hand, in case of PSF-2, it only established local mucosal immunity.<br>
In addition, J. Freek van Iwaarden, et al. (Non-Patent Document 4) have reported that if macrophage is removed artificially from the lung, SP-B and lipid can induce systemic immune reaction, but in the case that<br><br>
macrophage is not removed, they cannot induce immunity. In addition, in this document, the amount of SP-B plus lipid necessary for induction of the systemic immune reaction, is 250 to 300 jil, which is quite different from the PSF-2 administration amount in the above-mentioned Examples (0.2 fil). However, it has never mentioned local mucosal immunity.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Influence of SFP-2 or CTB on various cytokines secreted from the nose, lung or lymphocyte of spleen by nasal administration of influenza<br>
vaccine<br>
As the nasal vaccine, 0.2 jig of the split-type influenza vaccine was administered to the upper respiratory tract of BALB/c mouse in 2 nl in total as 1 nl PBS solution, alone or with 0.2 ng of PSF-2 or 0,2 ng of CTB. 2 weeks after the second immunization, the mouse was slaughtered, and quantitization of secretion amount of TGF-pl and cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-13) from the nose, lung or lymphocyte of spleen was conducted (n=15-20; average±SE; ++-»-, p=0.06; ++, P«0.05; +, P=0.01 vs. the vaccine independent administration).<br>
As shown in Figs. 7 (a) to (e), TGF-pl, IL-5 and IL-6 were found to increase significantly in secretion, whereas IL-4 and IL-13 were found to increase significantly in the local mucosal membrane (nose, lung) after the vaccine immunity along with PSF-2. On the other hand, significant increase of any cytokine was not observed in the spleen.<br>
From the above results, it was found that PSF-2 increase Th2-type cytokine, which promotes differentiation and induction of B cell producing IgA.<br>
EXAMPLE 9 Influence of PSF-3 on production of anti-influenza specific antibodies<br><br>
(IgA and IgG) in (a) the nasal cavity, (b) the alveoli and (c) the blood by nasal administration of influenza vaccine<br>
As the nasal vaccine, 0.2 jag of the split-type influenza vaccine was administered to both noses of BALE/c mouse by 1 fd, respectively, i.e., 2 fil in total as a PBS solution, alone or with 0.2 jig of PSF-3 (a mixture of same amount of SP-B fragment, i.e., 253 to 278 peptides described in SEQ ID No. 16, and SP-C fragment, i.e., 24 to 58 peptides described in SEQ ID No. 21J as the "AD vehicle", or 0.2 ng of lipid ingredient. After 4 weeks, second immunization was conducted in the same manner as in the first immunization. To the control group, same amount of PBS was administered, respectively. 2 weeks after the second immunization, the mouse was slaughtered in each group, and the washing solutions of the nasal cavity and the alveoli, and serum by blood collection from the heart were prepared, and using these, quantitization of expression amount of anti-influenza antibody was conducted (n=15-30; average±SE; +, p
As shown in Figs. 8 (a) and (b), in the washing solutions of the nasal cavity and the alveoli, blood anti-influenza antibody IgA (blue circlet) showed remarkable increase in case that PSF-3 and the vaccine were administered, but significant increase of IgG (red circlet) was not found. On the other hand, in serum (c), neither IgA (blue circlet) nor IgO (red circlet) was found to increase significantly.<br>
