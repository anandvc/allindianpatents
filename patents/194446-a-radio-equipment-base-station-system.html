Description.:-<br>
Radio equipment base station system.<br>
The invention relates to a radio equipment, particularly a mobile<br>
radio terminal equipment, which provides varying output character-<br>
istics or rather makes possible the utilisation of varying services<br>
(communication services) and a base station system for communica-<br>
tion with that type of radio equipments.	<br>
Modern mobile radio systems and the radio equipments used for commu-<br>
nication over these systems offer an user an increasing number of<br>
output characteristics or rather services. Therein many different<br>
services are known to a specialist like speaking links data links<br>
transmission of short information, indication of subscriber's nu-<br>
mber of calling participant, call deflection, call transmission,<br>
call waiting, call charges notification, Mail - box or the differ-<br>
ent coding process for language links, for example different quali-<br>
ties or in general the communication over varying transmission<br>
standards.<br>
World wide, there exist number of different mobile radio networks which are based on varying transmission standards. Widely enlarged, are therein the mobile radio networks, which work as per the GSM -system (global system for mobile communication). The entire world wide GSM - supply area is covered through multiple number of small PLMN - (public land mobile network) supply areas. A PLMH - supply area is serviced therein by an operator. Two or more PLMN - supply areas within a country can intersect. Each PLMN - supply area is clearly identifiable through identification, like the Mobile -Network - Code MNC.<br>
Within a PLMN - supply area, the GSM - standard and the services or rather output characteristics contained in standard and, if re-quired, services or rather output characteristics not contained in standards are uniformly implemented and provided for utilisation.<br>
Though different PLMN - supply areas are based on an uniform transmission standard, caused through different manufac-turer, network operator or the point of time of commissioning of mobile radio network it can come to implementation or providing of output characteristic or rather services depending on varying PLMN - supply area.<br><br>
2<br>
Through international Roaming - agreement between the network operators of different<br>
PLMN - supply areas, it is possible on requirement, to communicate for example a<br>
foreign location with a radio equipment in a PLMN - supply area other than normally<br>
used Through the above mentioned implementation or rather providing of services or<br>
rather output characteristics depending on PLMN - supply areas, it can come therein to<br>
function disturbances of radio equipment specific to services or rather specific to output<br>
characteristics. This problem, can in future radio equipments which can communicate<br>
over different transmission standards obtaining yet the so called multi pattern radio<br><br>
equipment.<br>
In the following, a PLMN - supply area is described as mobile radio system. In general the concept mobile radio system describes in me frame of this announcement a mobile radio system, which displays predominantly on uniform implementation and providing of services and output characteristics, is dearly identifiable through identifications allocated to one or more number of mobile radio systems and as a rule is operated by a network operator.<br>
The assignment lies at the base of the invention, to provide a radio equipment and a base station system, which permit it, to communicate with radio equipment in varying mobile radio system disturbance free.<br>
With the foregoing and other objects in view there is provided, in accordance with the invention a transceiver that includes means for communicating via mobile radio systems; means for performing a function selected from the group consistent of providing different service features, using different service features, providing different services, and using different services; means for storing information selected from the group consisting of information regarding mobile radio systems, information regarding service features that are supported by the mobile radio systems, and information regarding services that are supported by the mobile radio systems, and means for automatically selectively blocking at least some functions selected from the group consisting of service features and services in dependence on the mobile radio system in which the transceiver is currently<br><br>
2A<br>
registered and in dependence on the stored information regarding the mobile radio system in which the transceiver is currently registered<br>
The invention is thus based on the idea that the part of output characteristic or rather service supported by a radio equipment is automatically stopped, which is not supported disturbance free by the mobile radio system in which the radio equipment is booked.<br>
A further development of the invention plans that depending on the stored information over mobile radio system and output characteristics or rather services supported predominantly disturbance free by this and depending on the mobile radio system, in which the radio equipment is booked at the moment, automatically at least a part of output characteristic or rather services is selectively stopped.<br>
It is achieved through it that in mobile radio system, which	<br><br>
3<br>
do not support definite output characteristics or rather servi-ces, these output characteristics or rather services are automa-tically stopped and through it a disturbance free operation of radio equipment is guaranteed.<br>
A further development of the invention plans that the informations over the mobile radio system and output characteris-tics or rather services supported by it are transmitted over a mo-bile radio system to the radio equipment and are stored automati-cally.<br>
Thus it is possible, that at changes of supported output<br>
characteristics or services the corresponding informations can be<br>
simply updated.<br>
Another further development of the invention plans that<br>
at eventually appearing function disturbances automatically output characteristics or rather services are stopped, which are not nece-ssary for a base function of the radio equipment."<br>
Through introducing the invention in future Multi - patt-ern - radio equipment, particularly in a transition phase, in which for example existing GSM - mobile radio network are extended to wide - band - CDMA - mobile function network, a disturbance free operation of radio equipment is guaranteed, though different mobile radio systems support varying output characteristics or ra-ther services or transmission process, for example FDD (Time Divi-sion Duplex) or TDD -(Time Division Duplex) pattern.<br>
The invention is described closer in the following with<br>
help of prefered execution examples, to whose explanation the fo-<br>
llowing listed/accompanying Figures serves :<br>
Figure 1: a schematic representation of a radio equipment Figure 2: a schematic representation of a storage medium Figure 3: a block diagram of a mobile radio system. Figure 1 shows a radio equipment FG for utilisation of varying output characteristics or rather services of a mobile radio system, comprising of an operating unit MMI, a control equipment STE and a processing device VE, a power supply equipment SVE, a particif pant identification module SIM, an interface SS for data trans-mission and for power consumption, a high frequency part HF com-prising of a reception device EE,a transmission equipment SE and a frequency synthesiser SYN and an antenna equipment ANT. The in-dividual items of radio equipment are also combined with each other<br><br><br>
4<br>
through conducting path, wires, cables or bus system.<br>
The control equipment STE comprises essentially of a software controlled Micro-controller MC and the processing equ-ipment VE comprises of a digital signal signal processor DSP, wherein both can seize the storage component in recording and reading. The micro controller steers and controls all essential items, functions, output characteristics and services of radio equipment EG and steers essentially the communication and signa-lling flows<br>
Through analogue/digital - converter, the analogue au-dio signals and the analogue signals arising out of high frequen-cy part HF are changed to digital signals and processed by digi-tal signal processor. After the processing, the digital signals are again changed through digital/analogue - converter to analo-gue audio signal and analogue signals supplying to the high fre-quency part HF. Towards this, if required, a modulation or rath-er demodulation is carried out.<br>
In the volatile or non volatile storage components SPE the program data, which are required for control of radio equip-ment FG of communication flow, of the signalling procedure of the output characteristics and of the services, equipment informations, informations input by the users and informations generating du-ring processing of signals are stored.<br>
Besides the radio equipment FG has at disposal a plug -in shaft for a participant identification module SIM or a co-rresponding possibly permanently installed item for storage of participant - or network specific informations.<br>
Figure 2 shows memory components SPE, in which informa-tions over varying mobile radio systems MS or rather the corres-ponding identifications and the characteristic outputs LM or ra-ther services D supported by this are stored. These informations can be stored in form of a Table in the storage components SPE of radio equipment or on the participant identification Module SIM.<br>
In case now an user, who usually communicates over a mobile radio system in Germany like for example the DI - network MSI, travels to another country, then after corresponding hand -over - and stay area updating procedure or after the booking of radio equipment in a mobile radio system MS3 of another network operator over the new mobile radio system MS3, it's system<br><br>
5<br>
specific identification, for example the mobile network code MNC or the Location Area Identity LAI is communicated to the radio eq-uipment FG and the informations over it if required is stored.<br>
Thereupon, the control equipment STE of radio equipment reads from the storage medium SPE the information over that which output characteristics LM1, LM2 or rather services D2 are not supp-orted by this mobile radio system MS3 and stops the corresponding output characteristics IM 1, LM 2 or rather services D 2 and consi-ders the stoppage of this output characteristics LM 1, LM 2 or ra-ther services D 2 in following signalling procedures like the ex-tension of a link. As long as the user stays in this mobile radio radio system MS 3, these output characteristics LM1, LM 2 or rather services D 2 do not remain at it's disposal.<br>
Since continuously new mobile radio systems-are built and existing mobile radio systems are to be further extended and with it in course of time in the varying mobile function system MS addi-tional output characteristics LM or rather services D or other output characteristics or services comprising of technical imple-mentations remain at disposal of user, these informations advanta-geously shall be updated from time to time. Therein following desi-gns of invention are possible. The updating of informations, that means a renewed storage of Table represented as per Figure 2 can take place likewise as the first storage of informations over an interface SS of radio equipment FG. This can take place for example by means of a personal computer of manufacturer or of network ope-rator. It is also possible to take up the updating of informations over the operating unit MMI of radio equipment FG.<br>
The informations can also at least over a part of the mo-bile radio system, for example the mobile radio system which the user usually uses be transmitted to radio equipment FG and are au-tomatically stored there. For this useful - or signalling channels can be used. These informations can be communicated in regular or irregular intervals also in the sense of a broadcast - news. In an exe-cution variation these informations are then always transmitted, when the stay area of radio equipment FG has changed. An updating of informations can then thus be released when the identification of stay area or of network operator or rather of mobile radio sys-tem has changed or rather a stay area updating procedure (location<br><br>
6<br>
update - procedure) is executed. It is also possible that the up-dating is then released when the radio equipment FG is booked in a mobile radio system.<br>
Another execution variation of invention plans that in the radio equipment FG at eventually appearing function disturbance automatically all output characteristics or rather services are stopped, which are not necessary for a basic function of radio equipment. Under basic function one understands therein also a simple speaking link with robust language encoding. Also other advantageous basic functions are for a specialist easy to define.<br>
The mobile radio system represented in Figure 3 corresponds in it's structure to a known GSM - mobile radio system, which comprises of a number of mobile communication centre, which are inter networked with each other or rather manufactures the access to a permanent network PSTN. Further these mobile communication centre MSC are in each case with at least one base station controller combined Each base Station Controller BSC allows again to at least one base station BS, Such a base station BS is a radio station, which over a radio interface can build a radio link to radio equipments FG. The range of signals of a base station BS defines predominantly a radio cell FZ. The allocation of resources like frequency bands to radio cells and with it to the data sequences under transmission, can be controlled through the control equipments like for example the base station controller, BSC. Base stations BS and a base sta-tion controller BSC can be combined to a base station BSS:<br>
The base station system BSS is therein responsible also for the radio channel administration, the data rate matching, the monitoring of radio transmission stretch handover procedures, link steering and mobility administration and communicates the informa-tion necessary for that to the radio equipment FG. The base sta-tion system BSS is also responsible for the communication of in-formations over the mobile radio systems and supported by it ser-vices or rather output characteristics, for updating of stored in-formations. This communication can also be carried out over signa-lling channel or contact channels.<br><br>
7<br>
In following the invention is explained with help of langu-age encoding in a GSM - system as an example.<br>
In GSM - mobile radio system, as option for originally used Full - Rate (FR) language code, a Half - Rate (HR) language code is defined, which makes it possible to transmit the language in-formation with the half data - rate over a Half - Rate contact cha-nnel and with it double the number of parallel talks to carry over a base station BS.<br>
An increasing number of mobile radio systems MS and radio equ-ipment FG support this output characteristic LM Dual - rate - Sup-port which makes it possible to compress the language optionally either by means of Full-Rate (FR) language code or of Half-Rate (HR) language code.<br>
Indeed at least during a pass over phase the situation can ap-pear, that a Dual-Rate-Support-radio equipment FG is booked in a Full-Rate-bupport-only-mobile radio system, which does not support this output characteristics LM Dual-Rate-Support and besides does not or not reliably communicate to radio equipment information ab-out it, that it does not support this output characteristic LM Dual-Rate-Support.<br>
In this case a conventional radio equipment communicates to<br>
the mobile radio system informations over the language codes supp-orted by it for the mobile radio system (Dual-Rate-Support radio eq-uipment ). A special or faulty implementation of this output cha-racteristics (Full-Rate-Support and/or Dual-Rate-Support) in mobile radio system can lead to it that the mobile radio system can not react in suitable way on this information, in which it possesses either a Half-Rate link or communicates suitable control informa-tion for use of Full-Kate-language code for radio equipment. Thus in the use of conventional radio equipments it comes to disturbances, so that for example the radio equipment can not produce at all any link to mobile radio system.<br>
After the booking of a design of a radio equipment as per in-vention in a mobile radio system MS, of such type the correspond-ing informations (mobile radio system-MS does not support Dual-Rate -Support) are read by the control equipment STE of radio equip-ment FG from the Storage Component SPE. The Dual-Rate-Language code- output characteristic of radio equipment FG is stopped<br><br>
8<br>
equipment internally and the radio equipment announces itself as Full-Rate-Support- only radio equipment at the mobile radio system,, Thus disturbances can be avoided and a link building can be carried through.<br>
This output characteristic - stoppage can be applied analogous on the Enhanced - Full rate - Code.<br>
At multi pattern - radio equipment FG, which for example can communicate over existing GSM - mobile radio nets and future Wide - Band - CDMA - mobile radio network or over FDD - (Time Division Duplex) or TDD (Time Division Duplex), in the storage components SPE., for example informations over the different mobile radio systems and supported by it transmission standards or rather transmission process are stored and if required the multi - pattern radio equipment FG analogous to above stated realisation for certain transmission standards or rather tra-nsmission process or transmission system are stopped.-<br><br>
