				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Fuel Cell Power Systems, Direct Current Voltage Converters, Fuel Cell Power Generation Methods, and Power Conditioning Methods<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present inventions relates to fuel cell power systems, direct current voltage converters, fuel cell power generation methods, power conditioning methods and direct current power conditioning methods.<br>
Background Art<br>
Fuel cells are known in the art. The fuel cell is an electrochemical device which reacts hydrogen, and oxygen, which is usually supplied from the ambient air, to produce electricity and water. The basic process is highly efficient and fuel cells fueled directly by hydrogen are substantially pollution free. Further, since fuel cells can be assembled into stacks of various sizes, power systems have been developed to produce a wide range of electrical power output levels and thus can be employed in numerous applications.<br>
Although the fundamental electrochemical processes involved hi all fuel cells are well understood, engineering solutions have proved elusive for making certain fuel cell types reliable, and for others economical. In the case of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell power systems, reliability has not been the driving concern to date, but the installed cost per watt of generation capacity has raised issues.<br>
In order to further lower the PEM fuel cell cost per watt, much attention has been directed to increasing the power output of same. Historically, this has resulted in additional sophisticated balance-of-plant systems which are necessary to optimize and maintain high PEM fuel cell power output. A consequence of highly complex balance-of-plant systems is that they do not readily scale down to low capacity applications. Consequently, cost, efficiency, reliability and maintenance expenses are all adversely effected in low generation applications.<br>
It is well known that single PEM fuel cells produce a useful voltage of only about 0.45 to about 0.7 Volts D.C. per cell under a load. Practical PEM fuel cell plants have been built from multiple cells stacked together such that they are electrically connected in series. It is further well known that PEM fuel cells can operate at higher<br>
power output levels when supplemental humidification is made available to the proton exchange membrane (electrolyte).<br>
In this regard, humidification lowers the resistance of proton exchange membranes to proton flow. To achieve this increased humidification, supplemental water can be introduced into the hydrogen or oxygen streams by various methods, or more directly to the proton exchange membrane by means of the physical phenomenon known as wicking, for example.<br>
The focus of investigations, however, hi recent years has been to develop membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) with increasingly improved power output when running without supplemental humidification. Being able to run an MEA when it is self-humidified is advantageous because it decreases the complexity of the balance-of-plant with its associated costs. However, self-humidification heretofore has resulted in fuel cells running at lower current densities and thus, in turn, has resulted in more of these assemblies being required in order to generate a given amount of power.<br>
While PEM fuel cells of various designs have operated with varying degrees of success, they have also had shortcomings which have detracted from their usefulness. For example, PEM fuel cell power systems typically have a number of individual fuel cells which are serially electrically connected (stacked) together so that the power system can have a increased output voltage. In this arrangement, if one of the fuel cells in the stack fails, it no longer contributes voltage and power.<br>
One of the more common failures of such PEM fuel cell power systems is where a given MEA becomes less hydrated than other MEAs in the same fuel cell stack. This loss of membrane hydration increases the electrical resistance of the effected fuel cell, and thus results in more waste heat being generated. In turn, this additional heat drys out the membrane electrode assembly. This situation creates a negative hydration spiral. The continual overheating of the fuel cell can eventually cause the polarity of the effected fuel cell to reverse such that it now begins to dissipate electrical power from the rest of the fuel cells in the stack. If this condition is not rectified, excessive heat generated by the failing fuel cell may cause the MEA to perforate and thereby leak hydrogen. When this perforation occurs the fuel cell stack must be completely disassembled and repaired. Depending upon the design of fuel cell stack being employed, such repair or replacement may be a costly, and time consuming endeavor.<br>

A controllable air flow device or air passage 56 couples plenum 51 to exterior ambient air outside of housing 12. Air passage 56 can permit the intake of air into plenum 51 as well as the exhaustion of air from plenum 51. Control system 30 is coupled with control circuitry 51 of modifying element 53, control circuitry 48 and monitoring circuitry 49 of fan 54, temperature circuitry 68 associated with temperature sensor 55, control circuitry 57 of air passage 56, and heater 75 of fuel sensor 61.<br>

Control system 30 is configured to at least one of control and monitor at least one operation of fuel cell power system 10. During operation, fuel from fuel supply 23 is applied to main valve 47. Main valve 47 is coupled with auxiliary valves 45 as shown. Responsive to control from control system 30, main valve 47 and auxiliary<br>
valves 45 apply fuel to respective fuel cell cartridges 14.   Responsive to the supply of fuel, and in the presence of oxygen, fuel cell cartridges 14 produce electrical power.<br>
A power bus 60 couples the fuel cell cartridges 14 in series. Power bus 60 provides an electrical connection which is coupled with external terminals 62, 63 which may be connected with an external load 22 (shown in Fig. 1). Terminal 62 provides a positive terminal and terminal 63 provides a negative terminal of fuel cell power system 10.<br>
Air temperature control assembly 50 applies oxygen to the respective fuel cell cartridges 14 via ports 52. Fuel cell cartridges 14 are individually operable to convert chemical energy into electricitj. As described below, fuel cartridges 14 individually contain plural fuel cells individually having an anode side and a cathode side. Auxiliary valves 45 apply fuel.to the anode sides of the fuel cells. Plenum 51 directs air within the cathode sides of the fuel cells.<br>
Air temperature control assembly 50 preferably provides circulated air within a predetermined temperature range. Such circulated air can be exterior air and/or recirculated air. In the preferred embodiment, air temperature control assembly 50 provides air within plenum 51 within an approximate temperature range of 25 "Celsius to 80 "Celsius.<br>
Upon start-up conditions of fuel cell power system 10, modifying element 53 may be controlled via control system 30 using element control circuitry 41 to either increase or decrease the temperature of air present within plenum 51. Fan 54 operates to circulate the air within plenum 51 to respective fuel cell cartridges 14. Fan control circuitry 48 and fan monitor circuitry 49 are shown coupled with fan 54. Responsive to control from control system 30, fan control circuitry 48 operates to control air flow rates (e.g., speed of rotation) of fan 54. Fan monitor circuitry 49 operates to monitor the actual air flow rates induced by fan 54 (e.g., circuitry 49 can comprise a tachometer for rotational fan configurations).<br>
Control system 30 monitors the temperature of the air within plenum 51 using temperature sensor 55. During operation, heat is generated and emitted from fuel cell cartridges 14. Thus, it may be necessary to decrease the temperature of air within plenum 51 to provide efficient operation of fuel cell power system 10. Responsive to control from control system 30, air passage 56 can be utilized to introduce exterior air into plenum 51 and exhaust air from plenum 51 to ambient.<br>
Control system 30 communicates with control circuitry 57 to control air passage 56. In one embodiment, air passage 56 includes a plurality of vanes and control<br>
circuitry 57 operates to control the position of the vanes of air passage 56 to selectively introduce exterior air into plenum 51. The vanes of air passage 56 can preferably be provided in a plurality of orientations between an open position and a closed position to vary the amount of exterior fresh air introduced into plenum 51 or the amount of air exhausted from plenum 51 responsive to control from control system 30. Ah- circulated within plenum 51 can comprise recirculated and/or fresh ambient air.<br>
Utilizing temperature sensor 59, control system 30 can also monitor the temperature of ambient air about housing 12. Control system 30 can utilize such exterior temperature information from temperature sensor 59 to control the operation of air passage 56. Temperature sensor 59 is located adjacent air passage 56 in a preferred embodiment.<br>
As described -in further detail below, control system 30 controls air flow rates of fan 54 using fan control circuitry 48. Fan monitor circuitry 49 provides air flow rate information to control system 30. Control system 30 can monitor the total system voltage being delivered via power bus 60 by summing the individual cell voltages. Control system 30 can also monitor the electrical load being delivered via power bus 60 using current sensor 40. With knowledge of the system bus voltage and load, control system 30 can calculate waste thermal power and provide a desired cooling air flow.<br>
More specifically, the efficiency of one or more fuel cells may be determined by dividing the respective fuel cell voltage by 1.23 (a theoretical maximum voltage of • a single fuel cell). An average efficiency can be determined for fuel cells 90 of fuel cell power system 10. The remaining energy (energy not associated to electricity) as determined from the efficiency calculation is waste thermal power. The determined waste thermal power may be utilized to provide a desired cooling air flow. Control system 30 controls the air flow rates of fan 54 depending upon the waste thermal power in accordance with one aspect of the described fuel cell power system 10.<br>
During operation of fuel cell cartridges 14, non-fuel diluents such as cathode-side water and atmospheric constituents can diffuse from the cathode side of the fuel cell through a membrane electrode assembly of the fuel cell and accumulate in the anode side of the fuel cell. In addition, impurities hi the fuel supply delivered directly to the anode side of the fuel cell also accumulate. Without intervention, these diluents can dilute the fuel sufficiently enough to degrade performance. Accordingly, the anode side of the individual fuel cells is connected to a bleed manifold 65. Bleed manifold 65 is additionally coupled with bleed valve 43.<br>
Control system 30 selectively operates bleed solenoid 42 to selectively open and close bleed valve 43 permitting exhaustion of matter such as entrained diluents and perhaps some fuel via a bleed exhaust 66 within housing 12. Control system 30 can operate to open and close bleed valve 43 on a periodic basis. The frequency of openings and closings of bleed valve 43 can be determined by a number of factors, such as electrical load coupled with terminals 62, 63, etc. Although not shown, a fuel recovery system may be coupled with bleed exhaust 66 to retrieve unused fuel for recirculation or other uses.<br>
Following a start-up condition either inputted via interface or from remote device 24, control system 30 selectively controls switching device 38 to couple power bus 60 with positive terminal 62. Switching device 38 can comprise parallel MOSFET switches to selectively couple-power bus 60 with an external load 22.<br>
For example, control system 30 may verify when an appropriate operational temperature within plenum 51 has been reached utilizing temperature sensor 55. In addition, control system 30 can verify that at least one electrical characteristic, such as voltage and/or current, of respective fuel cell cartridges 14 has been reached before closing switching device 38 to couple power bus 60 with an associated load 22.

Referring to Fig. 7, a characteristic curve of an exemplary fuel cell power system is illustrated. The depicted graphical representation illustrates voltage output of fuel cell power system 10 (i.e., serially arranged fuel cell cartridges 14) in relation to the output current within bus 60. The magnitude of the current corresponds or depends upon the usage of load 22.<br>
For example, for fuel cell power system 10 comprising twelve fuel cell cartridges 14 individually including four fuel cells 90, the maximum voltage is approximately 44 Volts. As current increases within bus 60 to load 22, the voltage of fuel cell power system 10 drops, as illustrated in the graphical representation of Fig. 7. A maximum current output of the depicted fuel cell power system 10 arrangement is approximately 85 Amps.<br>
In numerous applications, it is desired to provide a substantially constant voltage potential at the output of individual fuel cell cartridges 14 and/or fuel cell power system 10 at terminals 62, 63. In accordance with certain aspects of the present invention, power conditioning circuitry 100 is configured to receive direct current electrical energy having a variable voltage potential (e.g., unconditioned from one or more fuel cell 90), and provide electrical energy having a substantially constant voltage potential. As<br>

For example, power conditioning circuitry 100 is configured to provide inverter functionality alone or in addition to the direct current voltage conversion operations.<br>
Referring to Figs. 8-13, exemplary configurations of power conditioning circuitry 100 and control methodologies thereof are described. The depicted configurations of power conditioning circuitry 100 are exemplary and other arrangements are provided in other embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Referring specifically to Fig. 8, the depicted power conditioning circuitry 100 is implemented as a DC-DC step-down converter or voltage pre-regulator. The depicted DC-DC converter power conditioning circuitry 100 includes an input comprising input terminals 120, 122,-converter circuitry 108 and output terminals 121, 123. Input terminals 120, 122 are configured to couple with fuel cell cartridges 14 using bus 60. Terminal 120 comprises a positive DC terminal and terminal 122 comprises a ground terminal.<br>
Converter circuitry 108 in configured to couple intermediate fuel cell cartridges 14 and output terminals 121, 123. Output terminals 121, 123 comprise terminals 62, 63 of fuel cell power system 10 in some embodiments. Converter circuitry 108 is configured to convert received direct current electrical energy having a variable voltage potential into direct current electrical energy having a substantially constant voltage potential at an output comprising terminals 121, 123.<br>
As shown, the depicted arrangement of converter circuitry 108 comprises an electrical storage device 112 and a switch 114. Electrical energy storage device 112 comprises a capacitor and switch 114 comprises a metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET). Switch 114 is configured to selectively couple one or more fuel cells 90 with electrical energy storage device 112.<br>
In the described embodiment, controller 102 is configured to monitor at least one operational parameter of fuel cell power system 10 and to control switch 114 responsive to the monitoring. For example, controller 102 is configured to monitor a voltage potential of electrical energy storage device 112 at a node 116. Responsive to the monitoring, controller 102 operates switch 114 to selectively couple terminal 120 with node 116 to charge electrical energy storage device 112.<br>
In an exemplary application, it is desired to provide a substantially constant direct current voltage potential of 26 Volts at output terminals 121, 123. Accordingly, it is<br>
desired to provide a direct current voltage potential of approximately 27 Volts across electrical energy storage device 112 to account for the voltage drop across a diode 118<br>
According to one operational methodology, if controller 102 senses the voltage potential at node 116 dropping below 27 Volts, controller 102 turns switch 114 on to charge electrical energy storage device 112 using power received from fuel cells 90 via terminal 120. More specifically, controller 102 is configured to control switch 114 to maintain a direct current voltage potential across electrical energy storage device 112 above a predetermined threshold. Accordingly, converter circuitry 108 operates to provide a substantially constant direct current voltage potential across output terminals 121, 123.<br>
A charge pump (not shown) is coupled with converter circuitry 108 to provide the 60 Volt supply. It is desired to provide the voltage potential at node 119 approximately 20 Volts higher than the highest possible voltage from fuel cell cartridges 14 at terminal 120. Controller 102 provides control signals to node 117 to control the operation of switch 114 in the depicted embodiment.<br>
Referring to Fig. 9, an exemplary method for controlling DC-DC converter circuitry 108 is illustrated. The depicted methodology is stored as executable code for use by controller 102 hi the described embodiment. Such code is stored within internal memory of controller 102 or within memory 103 accessible by controller 102. The method of Fig. 9 maintains the output voltage of the power conditioning circuitry 100 above a threshold voltage. Other control methods are used in other embodiments.<br>
' Initially, controller 102 proceeds to step S10 to initialize settings. For example, a desired output voltage potential is set along with an acceptable amount of deviation. The set point voltage is the desired voltage at node 116 and is referred to as VP. Acceptable deviation from the desired set point voltage is a window parameter referred to as W.<br>
At step SI2, controller 102 determines whether the voltage at terminal 120 (referred to as voltage Vs) is less than the actual measured voltage at node 116 (referred to as voltage Vc). Exemplary voltage monitoring circuitry is depicted in Fig. 15 which may be coupled with controller 102.<br>
Controller 102 proceeds to step S14 if the voltage at terminal 120 is less than the voltage at node 116. At step S14, controller 102 is provided within an idle state corresponding to fuel cell power system 10 being off. Thereafter, controller 102 proceeds to step S12 and continues to compare voltage potentials at terminal 120 and node 116.<br>
If the voltage at terminal 120 is greater than the voltage at node 116, controller 102 proceeds to step SI6. At step SI6, controller 102 determines whether the voltage Vc at node 116 is less than the desired set point voltage Vp minus the window variation parameter W.<br>
Controller 102 proceeds to step S18 responsive to the condition at step S16 being negative. At step SI8, controller 102 is configured to monitor diode operation to ensure proper application of power to any load coupled with output terminals 121, 123. Thereafter, controller 102 returns to step SI2.<br>
If step SI6 is in the affirmative, controller 102 proceeds to step S20 to turn on switch 114. Electrical energy storage device 112 is charged responsive to switch 114 being provided in the on condition at step S20.<br>
Controller 102 proceeds to step S22 to determine whether the voltage Vc at node 116 is greater than the set point voltage VP plus any variation W.<br>
If the condition at step S22 is in the affirmative, controller 102 proceeds to step S24 to turn off switch 114. Controller 102 then returns to step S12.<br>
Responsive to the condition at step S22 being in the negative, controller 102 proceeds to step S26 to verify the operation of switch 114. In particular, controller 102 determines whether the voltage Vs at terminal 120 is substantially equal to the voltage Vc at node 116. An alarm or other condition may be issued responsive to switch 114 being faulty.<br>
Thereafter, controller 102 proceeds to step S28. Controller 102 determines whether the voltage Vs at terminal 120 is equal to zero at step S28. If so, controller 102 proceeds to step S24 to turn off switch 114.<br>
If the condition at step S28 is in the negative, controller 102 proceeds to step S22 to again compare the voltage Vc at node 116 with the set point voltage V, and any acceptable variation W.<br>
Referring to Fig. 10-12, other exemplary configurations of power conditioning circuitry are respectively illustrated as references lOOa-lOOc. The depicted configuration of power conditioning circuitry lOOa comprises a buck or step-down DC-DC converter. The depicted configuration of power conditioning circuitry lOOb comprises a boost or step-up DC-DC converter. The depicted configuration of power conditioning circuitry lOOc comprises an inverter. Power conditioning circuits lOOa-lOOc individually include input terminals 120, 122 and output terminals 121, 123.<br>
As previously described, power conditioning circuits lOOa-lOOc are individually implemented in some configurations within fuel cell cartridges 14 to provide power<br>
conditioning on a modular (i.e., fuel cell cartridge 14) basis. In such configurations, input terminals 120, 122 are coupled with fuel cells 90 and output terminals 121, 123 are coupled with bus 60.<br>
According to other aspects of the present invention, power conditioning circuits lOOa-lOOc provide system power conditioning. In such arrangements, input terminals 120, 122 of power conditioning circuits lOOa-lOOc are coupled with bus 60 and output terminals 121, 123 are coupled with or comprise terminals 62, 63 of fuel cell power system 10.<br>
In some configurations, both DC-DC converter circuitry and inverter circuitry are utilized within a single power conditioning circuitry configuration. Accordingly, one or more of the depicted power conditioning circuits 100, lOOa, lOOb, lOOc may be utilized in a given fuel cell -cartridge 14 or fuel cell power system 10. For example, power conditioning circuitry 100, lOOa, lOOb comprising DC-DC converters may be initially utilized to convert a DC voltage potential from fuel cells 90 to another DC voltage potential. Thereafter, power conditioning circuitry lOOc may be implemented or utilized to convert the DC converted electrical energy into alternating current electrical energy. Other arrangements are provided in other aspects of the invention.<br>
Power conditioning circuits lOOa-lOOc depicted in Figs. 10-12 utilize switch mode power conditioning techniques. Switching devices are utilized to divert energy within the circuitry to at least one energy storage device (e.g., an inductor, transformer, capacitor). The switches typically comprise electronically controlled switches.<br>
Controller 102 is configured to control the operation of switches 124 using gate control signals. As described further below, control over the illustrated power conditioning circuits lOOa-lOOc is accomplished by pulse-width modulation (PWM) utilizing controller 102 in the described embodiment. The switching devices are switched on at a fixed interval or frequency while the time that the switch is left on varies (i.e., the duty cycle is varied). In the described configuration, controller 102 provides the pulse-width modulation switching control signals. As also detailed below, controller 102 monitors operational parameters of fuel cell power system 10, such as voltages, currents and temperatures to determine an appropriate pulse-width modulation duty cycle. Controller 102 is configured to vary the duty cycle of the control signals to provide a desired operation.<br>
Referring specifically to Fig. 10, power conditioning circuitry lOOa includes plural switches 124 and an electrical energy storage device 128 comprising an inductor. Switches 124 are coupled with controller 102. Exemplary configurations of switches 124<br>
include implementation as a MOSFET, insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), bipolar junction transistor (BJT), thyristor, metal oxide semiconductor controlled thyristor (MCT), or gate-turn-off thyristor (GTO), for example.<br>
In general, power conditioning circuitry lOOa implemented as a step-down converter provides an output voltage at terminals 121, 123 which is less than an input voltage received via terminals 120, 122. Power conditioning circuitry lOOa provides an output current which is greater than a received input current.<br>
Referring to Fig. 11, power conditioning circuitry lOOb includes switch 124 and an inductor as an energy storage device 128. Switch 124 is coupled with controller 102. In general, power conditioning circuitry lOOb implemented as a step-up converter provides an output voltage at terminals 121, 123 which is greater than an input voltage received via terminals 120, 122. Power conditioning circuitry lOOb provides an output current which is less than a received input current.<br>
Referring to Fig. 12, power conditioning circuitry configured as an inverter is depicted as reference lOOc. The depicted inverter power conditioning circuitry lOOc is configured to convert input DC voltage and current to AC voltage and current Typically, the amplitude and frequency of the alternating voltage waveform are regulated while the load generally affects the current waveform. The voltage waveform oscillates at 50 to 60 Hz in the described embodiment.<br>
As described previously, output terminals 121, 123 may be coupled directly to a utility power grid or, alternatively, to bus 60 of the fuel cell power system 10. In the case of coupling inverter power conditioning circuitry lOOc with a utility power grid, the voltage waveform is typically synchronized to the grid before such connection is made. Such synchronization may be accomplished using appropriate digital and/or analog circuitry.<br>
The disclosed configuration of inverter power conditioning circuitry lOOc includes switches 124, inductor 128 and transformer 130. Controller 102 operates to control switches 124 using pulse-width modulated control signals in the described embodiment to generate alternating current power at output terminals 121, 123 coupled with transformer 130.<br>
In other configurations, power conditioning circuitry 100 comprises non-isolated converter topologies for DC-DC conversion functions, such as buck-boost, cuk and full-bridge, for example. A variety of isolated DC-DC converter schemes are also possible, such as fly-back, forward, push-pull, half and full-bridge.<br>
Referring to Fig. 13, an exemplary methodology for determining appropriate duty cycles for pulse-width modulated control signals generated within controller 102 for control of power conditioning circuitry lOOa-lOOc is described. Such methodology may be implemented within executable code stored within memory 103. Alternatively, such methodology may be implemented in hardware in another configuration. The depicted methodology is utilized for controlling the voltage of fuel cell power system 10 to a certain set point, such as an output voltage from fuel cell power system 10 of approximately 26 Volts. Other control methods are utilized in other embodiments.<br>
Initially, a default duty cycle, such as 50%, is utilized upon start-up operations. Thereafter, the default duty cycle is varied in accordance with the below method.<br>
At step S40, controller 102 receives data regarding operations of fuel cell power system 10. For example, controller 102 retrieves data regarding voltage potentials of individual fuel cell cartridges 14, voltage potential across terminals 62, 63 of fuel cell power system 10, output current supplied to a load coupled with fuel cell power system 10, and temperature information within housing 12 of fuel cell power system 10 and/or temperatures within one or more of fuel cell cartridges 14.<br>
Thereafter, controller 102 proceeds to step S42 to determine whether fuel cell cartridge voltages are acceptable. Such acceptable voltages are dependant upon the number of fuel cells 90 within a given fuel cell cartridge 14. In a described configuration, an acceptable voltage of a given fuel cell cartridge 14 is greater than approximately 0.6-0.65 Volts per fuel cell.<br>
If the determined cartridge voltage of fuel cell cartridges 14 is unacceptable, controller 102 proceeds to step S44 to reduce a duty cycle. At step S44, controller 102 use an incremental step of approximately one percent to reduce the duty cycle being utilized. Thereafter, controller 102 returns to step S40.<br>
Alternatively, if the condition at step S42 is acceptable, controller 102 proceeds to step S46 and determines whether the fuel cell power system voltage is acceptable. In a series arrangement of twelve fuel cell cartridges 14 individually having four fuel cells 90 per cartridge, an acceptable voltage potential of fuel cell power system 10 is below approximately 30 Volts, for example.<br>
If the fuel cell power system voltage is high, controller 102 proceeds to step S48 to again reduce the duty cycle. In one configuration, controller 102 is configured to reduce the duty cycle by approximately one percent. Thereafter, controller 102 returns to step S40 to retrieve additional data.<br>
Alternatively, if the condition is acceptable at step S46, controller 102 proceeds to step S50 to determine whether an output current of the fuel cell power system 10 is acceptable. For example, a fuel cell power system 10 including twelve serially arranged fuel cell cartridges 14 individually including four fuel cells 90 would have an acceptable maximum current of approximately 85 amps.<br>
If the condition of step S50 is unacceptable, controller 102 proceeds to step S52 to reduce the duty cycle by a predetermined step, such as one percent, and thereafter returns to step S40.<br>
If the condition at step S50 is acceptable, controller 102 proceeds to step S54 to compute the duty cycle based upon the output voltage of fuel cell power system 10. In the described embodiment, a proportional integral algorithm could be utilized to compute the duty cycle based upon the output voltage of fuel cell power system 10.<br>
Thereafter, controller 102 proceeds to step SS6 to adjust the calculated duty cycle depending upon the monitored temperature within housing 12 of fuel cell power system 10 or individual fuel cell cartridges 14. For example, controller 102 may subtract one percent from the duty cycle for each degree Celsius above 40 "Celsius.<br>
