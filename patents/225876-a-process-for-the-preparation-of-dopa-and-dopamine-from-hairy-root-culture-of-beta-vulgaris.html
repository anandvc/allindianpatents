				<td>The present invention relates to a   process for the preparation of   Dopa and Dopamine from hairy root culture of Beta vulgaris<br>
L-Dopa (Dihydroxy L-phenylalanine) and dopamine are neurotransmitter presursors being used for sympotomic relief of parkinson's disease (Pras, N et al 1989, Biotechnology and Bioengineering 34, 214-222). The high price, demand and high dose led for alternative and inexpensive methods for their production. L-Dopa is mainly produced as a secondary metabolite in plant cell cultures of Mucuna pruriens (Pras et al 1989) and callus as well as transformed root cultures of Stizolobium hassjoo (Sung and Huang 2000. Biotech Prog, 16, 1135-1140). L-Dopa is also produced by various bacteria viz. Escherichia coli and Erwinia herbicola (Foor et al 1993, Appl. Environ. Microbilo 59: 3070-3075) and Psudomonas melanogenum (Tanaka et al 1974, Agri Biol Chem, 38(3), 633-639).<br>
Reference may be made to Wichers et al (1993) (PCTOC 33, 259-264), where both Dopa and dopamine were detected in plant organs such as leaves as well as cell cultures of Mucuna pruriens. They have also reported that addition of 2,4-D to cell suspensions increased Dopamine content and addition of NaCI at a concentration of 0.5 M helped in release of L-Dopa into the medium.<br>
Various biotransformation processes were also reported for the production of L-Dopa viz. Bioconversion of tyrosine to L-Dopa by immobilized cells of Mucuna pruriens (Wichers et al  1983,  Planta  158: 482-486),  and also  by<br><br><br>
immobilized cells of Papaver somniferum ( Stano et al 1995, phytochemistry, 38(4) 859-860.<br>
Beta vulgaris hairy root cultures are known to produce betalaines, which are natural red pigments. Due to conjugated double bonds, they are colored. Among higher plants the occurrence of betalaines is restricted to order centrospermae. However they are also reported in mushroom Amanita muscaria. Interestingly, in microorganisms as well as in animals betalaines are unknown. (Bohm and Rink 1988).Betalaines, the yellow betaxanthins and red-violet betacyanins are a group of water soluble pigments. The betaxanthins are conjugates of betalamic acid with amino acids are corresponding amines (including Dopamine), and the betacyanins are derivatives of betanidin, the conjugate of betalamic acid with cyclo-Dopa. Tyrosinase and Dopa dioxygenase are the main enzymes responsible for biosynthesis of basic skeleton of betalaines. (Mueller et al 1996, Steiner et al 1996, 1999, Girod and Zryd 1991, Mueller et al 1997). Tyrosinase is responsible for the formation of DOPA and its oxidation to cyclo-Dopa, the Dopa dioxygenase catalyses the Dopa extradiol cleavage, leading to the formation of betalamic acid. The desicive step , the linkage of betalamic acid with cyclo-Dopa was suggested to be a non enzymatic step( Trezzini and Zyrd 1990, Terradas and Wyler 1991). Kobayashi et al (2001) reported the formation of betacyanins from Dopamine in cell and hairy root cultures of Beta vulgaris.<br>
Reference may be made to Steiner et al (Planta 1999, 208: 114-124) where they have found that tyrosinase is involved in betalaine biosynthesis of<br><br>
higher plants taking callus cultures of Portulaca grandiflora which produces betacyanins. They have also reported that betalaines in hairy roots and callus of Beta vulgaris are formed by the action of tyrosinase. Schliemann et al 1998 (Phytochemistry 49(6) 1593-1598) reported that betalaine formation from L-Dopa in a model assay system . In their experiments they have incubated Dopa with Dopa dioxygenase from Amanita muscaria, which resulted in formation of 4,5-Seco-Dopa that spontaneously recyclized to betalamic acid.<br>
In all the reports cited above, it was said that in biosynthetic pathway of betalaines, Dopa is a precursor of betalaines but till date there is no report on the accumulation / production of Dopa and dopamine in hairy root cultures of Beta vulgaris.<br>
The main object of the present invention was to develop a process for extraction and production of Dopa and Dopamine from Beta vulgaris hairy roots and procedures for enhancement of its production.<br>
Accordingly a    process for the preparation of  Dopa and Dopamine  from hairy root culture of Beta vulgaris which comprises;<br>
a)	inoculating hairy roots of B.Vulgaris in the range of 0.1-0.5 g fresh wt/40ml culture medium comprising in a known sterilized media containing 2-4% sucrose for a period of 2-6 days to obtain higher growth<br>
b)	extracting the above growth using solvents like formic acid in the range of 1 -4 % (v/v), 0.1 N HCI and 80% hot ethanol to obtain Dopa and dopamine.<br><br><br>
The present investigation provides a method of production of Dopa and dopamine from hairy roots of Beta vulgaris, where the hairy roots were obtained upon infection of the explant using an isolate of Agrobacterium rhizogenes wild strain and were maintained by sub-culturing in MS (Murashige-Skoog 1962, Physiol plant 15, 473-479), medium without any phytohormones and with the addition of 3% sucrose and the pH of the medium was adjusted to 5.8 before autoclaving and the flasks were kept on a shaker at 90 rpm and cultured in dark for 24 days of culture time where in the hairy roots at different staged of growth were extracted with 2% formic acid, 0.1 N HCI and 80% hot ethanol in a mortar and pestle using glass powder, filtered and the extract was concentrated under vacuum and the concentrate was filtered through a membrane filter (0.22um) and injected for HPLC analysis and the Dopa and dopamine contents were quantified by comparison of areas with authentic standards (Sigma, St.Louis USA) and experiments were carried out to know which stage of the culture accumulated maximum Dopa and dopamine contents which include the addition of tyrosine at exponential stage of culture time and found that hairy root cultures in the initial stages accumulated more Dopa (6-day old cultures) and at 15-days, the dopamine accumulation was maximum and when tyrosine was (Hi media labs, Mumbai, India) supplemented at 3mg/40ml culture medium, the Dopa content was maximum i.e. 46 ug/g DW on 15th day and the dopamine content was also increased to 1.972 mg/g DW on 20th day of culture time.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, hairy roots of red beetroot were obtained using the wild strain of Agrobacterium rhizogenes.<br>
In yet another embodiment of present invention, they were cultured on Murashige and Skoog's basal medium in 150 ml Erlenmeyer flasks.<br>
In yet another embodiment of present invention, hairy roots of 8. vulgaris were extracted at different growth stages with 2% (v/v) formic acid in water, 0.1N HCI and 80% hot ethanol.<br>
In yet another embodiment of present invention, the extracts were centrifuged, filtered through a whatman#1 filter paper and concentrated under vacuum, dissolved in respective solvents such as 2% (v/v) formic acid in water, 0.1 N HCI and 80% hot ethanol for HPLC analysis.<br>
In yet another embodiment of present invention, HPLC analysis was performed with a Shimadzu LC-10A system (Shimadzu corporation, Japan) and the chromatograph was equipped with a Sum nucleosil C 18 column (250 mm long, 4 mm ID, Waters, USA) using Me llvaline buffer (0.1 M ammonium acatate/acetic acid buffer pH 4.7) at a flow rate of 1ml/min and detected with a UV detector (280 nm) and with a fluorescence detector (xenon arc lamp; excitation at 280nm and emission at 314 nm)<br>
In yet another embodiment of present invention, tyrosine at a concentration of 3mg/40ml was fed to the cultures of Beta vulgaris which were at exponential stage of their growth and the effect on Dopa and dopamine accumulation was recorded.<br><br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and through should not be considered to limit the scope of invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Hairy root cultures of Beta vulgaris were obtained upon infection of an explant by a wild strain of Agrobacterium rhizogenes. 300 mg fresh weight of hairy roots of Beta vulgaris (4-day old) was inoculated into 40 ml nutrient medium comprising of Murashige and Skoog's salts in a 150 ml Erlenmeyer's flask. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 5.8 before autoclaving for 15 min at 121°C at 15 Ib pressure. The hairy roots were subcultured every 2 weeks into fresh MS (Murashige-Skoog) medium with 3% sucrose and without any phytohormone addition and were kept in dark on a rotary shaker (90 rpm). The maximum biomass was recorded on 20th day of culture time as 6.75 g fresh weight (FW) per 40ml culture medium, which further decreased to reach a minimum of 5.2 g FW/40 ml culture medium on 24th day of culture time.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
300 mg fresh weight of hairy root cultures of Beta vulgaris from 4-day old cultures were inoculated into 40 ml nutrient medium comprising of Murashige and Skoog's salts in 150 ml Erlenmeyer's flasks. At time intervals of 6,12,15,20 and 24 days of culture period, the hairy roots were extracted for L-Dopa and dopamine using 80% hot ethanol, 0.1 N HCI and 2% formic acid in a mortar and pestle using neutralized glass powder. The extracts were centrifuged, filtered,<br><br>
concentrated and used for HPLC analysis of L-Dopa and dopamine. Betalaine content in the hairy roots was measured after extracting the roots in acidified water (ascorbic acid -water), centrifuged at 5000X g for 15 minutes. The supernatants were collected and the optical density was measured spectrophotometrically at 480nm and 540 nm for betaxanthins and betacyanins, respectively.<br>
Dopa and dopamine contents were quantified by HPLC analysis of the samples and were compared with those of authentic standards. The identification of the peaks was more prominent when a fluorescene detector was used.<br>
The extractability of L-Dopa and dopamine from B. vulgaris using various solvents is shown in table 1.<br>
Table 1: Extractability of dopa and dopamine from hairy root cultures of Beta vulgaris using different solvents.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Among the solvents used for the extraction of dopa and dopamine, 2% formic acid was proved good compared with 80% hot ethanol and 0.1 N HCI. The Dopa production was analyzed using 2% formic acid as extracting solvent which was recorded more content in the initial stages of culture (exponential phase) i.e 6th day of culture time. The dopamine content was more during 15th day of culture time, which later showed a decrease. When extracted with 2% formic acid, the Dopa extraction levels were 1.7 and 1.5 fold higher, than that of 80% ethanol and 0.1 N HCI extracted ones respectively. Even dopamine recovery was higher when 2% formic acid was used for extraction which is 1.9 and 1.4 fold higher when compared with that of 80% ethanol and 0.1 N HCI extracted ones respectively. Based on the results, further extractions were carried out with 2% formic acid in all experiments with B. vulgaris hairy root cultures for production of Dopa and dopamine.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
300 mg fresh weight of hairy roots of Beta vulgaris (4-day old) were inoculated into 40 ml nutrient medium comprising of Murashige and Skoog's salts in a 150 ml Erlenmeyer's flask. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 5.8 before autoclaving for 15 min at 121°C at 15 Ib pressure. Tyrosine (dissolved in few drops of 0.1 N NaOH the made the volume with distilled water) at a concentration of 3mg/40 ml culture medium was added on the 6-day of culture period. The hairy roots were extracted with 2% formic acid in a mortar and pestle using neutralized glass powder. The extracts were centrifuged, filtered using Whatman #1 filter paper, concentrated and used for HPLC analysis. Dopa content<br>
increased from 32 ug/g DW from 6th day of culture time to 46ug/g DW on 15th day, which later decreased to 9ug/g DW on 24th day. The L-Dopa content in this case is 1.53 fold higher when compared to unfed cultures. Dopamine content increased from 0.412 mg/g DW on 6th day to 1.972 mg/g DW on 20th day and later decreased further to reach a value of 0.762mg/g DW on 24th day. Dopamine content in this case (Fed with tyrosine) is 2.02 fold higher when compared to control (Unfed) cultures. Betalaine content also has shown increase compared with control. Maximum betalaine accumulation was recorded on 20th day of culture time as 13.1 mg/g DW from an initial value of 3.1 mg/g DW on 6th day, which again decreased to 8 mg/g DW on 24th day. Thus this study provides valuable information for the right time (culture time) to harvest the hairy roots for better accumulation of L-Dopa and dopamine and also the suitable solvent for their extraction. The results are shown in table 2.<br>
