ethyl 3-methy!-9H-imidazo[l,5-a][l,2,4]triazolo[3,4-d][lJ4]benzodiazepine-10-<br>
carboxylate.<br>
The above mentioned specific imidazo[l,5-a] [l,2,4]triazolo-[4,3-d][l,4]benzodiazepine derivatives have already been described {Heterocydes, Vol 39, No. 2,1994), however, in this document it is mentioned that these"conrpounds unexpectedly show low affinities for BzR (benzodiazepine receptor) and therefore are devoid of anxiolytic activity. Surprisingly, it has now been found thatlKrcTass of<br>
compounds show high affinity and selectivity for GABA A a5 receptor binding sites and<br>
might b^usefufarcognitrre enhancer OT	~<br>
Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Receptors for the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), are divided into two main classes: (1) GABA A receptors, which are members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily arid (2) GABA B receptors, which are members of the G-protein linked receptor family. The GABA A receptor complex which is a<br>
membrane-bound heteropentameric protein polymer is composed principally of a, Q and y sub units.<br>
Presendy a total number of 2L subunits of the GABA A receptor have been cloned and sequenced. Three types of subunits (a, p and y) are required for the construction of recombinant GABA A receptors which most closely mimic the biochemical, electrophysiological and pharmacological functions of native GABA A receptors obtained from mammalian brain cells. There is strong evidence that the benzodiazepine binding site lies between the a and y subunits. Among the recombinant GABA A receptors, aip2y2 mimics many effects of the classical type-I BzR subtypes, whereas ct2p2y2, ct3B2y2 and a5P2y2 ion channels are termed type-II BzR.<br>
It has been shown by McNamara and Skelton in Psychobiohgy, 21:101-108 that the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist p-CCM enhance spatial learning in the Morris<br><br>
watermaze. However, ji-CCM and other conventional benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists are proconvulsant or convulsant which prevents their use as cognition enhancing agents in humans. In addition, these compounds are non-selective within the GABA A receptor subunits, whereas a GABA A a.5 receptor partial or full inverse agonist which is relatively free of activity at GABA A al and/or ct2 and/or ct3 receptor binding sites can be used to provide a medicament which is useful for enhancing cognition with reduced or without proconvulsant activity. It is also possible to use GABA A a5 inverse agonists which arenot free of activity at GABA A al and/or a2 and/or ct3 receptor binding sites but which are functionally selective for a5 containing subunits. However, inverse agonists which are selective for GABA A a5 subunits and are relatively free of activity at GABA A al, a2 and ct3 receptor binding sites are preferred.<br>
Objects of the present invention are compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, the preparation of the above mentioned compounds, medicaments containing them and their manufacture as well as the use of the above mentioned compounds in the control or prevention of illnesses, especially of illnesses and disorders of the kind referred to earlier or in the manufacture of corresponding medicaments.<br>

Then phosphorous oxide chloride is added and the solution is heated and after completion of the reaction toluene is evaporated. The obtained compound of formula X is then dissolved in THF and added to a mixture of a cooled solution of lithium diisopropylamide in THF and of (E)-(dimethylamino-methyIeneamino)-acetic acid ethyl ester or of (E/ZJ-N'fS-cyclopropyl-f 1,2,4] oxadia2ol-5-yl-methyl-dimethyl-formamidine. In a further step the obtained compound of formula XII is dissolved in a mixture of CH2GI2 and trichloroacetic acid and then treated with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid. The obtained compound of formula XIII is purified in conventional manner. A mixture of this compound and N,N-dimethyl-p-toluidine is dissolved in chlorobenzene under argon and phosphorous oxide chloride or bromide is then added at room temperature and the mixture is heated at reflux. The obtained compound of formula XTV is purified by known methods. If "hal" in formula XIV is chlorine, a compound of formula I may be obtained by reaction of a compound of formula XIV, for example the compound 6-chloro-S-methoxy-4H-2,510b-triaza-benzo[e]azulene-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester, with a corresponding formylhydrazine of formula III. The reaction is carried out in the presence of N,N-dimethyl-p-toluidine, or N-ethyldiisopropylamine or even without a base and is heated in chlorobenzene or p-xylene under reflux. If "hal" in formula XIV is bromine, a compound of this formula, for example 6,S-dibromo-4H-2,510b-triaza-benzo[e]azulene-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester, is treated with an anhydrous solution of hydrazine and the obtained solid compound of formula V may directly used in the last reaction step. Finally, a compound of formula I is obtained by heating under reflux a mixture of a compound of formula V in ethanol, containing triethylorthoformate.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The compounds of formula I as well as their pharmaceutically usable acid addition salts can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form oftablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The administration can, however, also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenteraliy, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically usable acid addition salts can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic excipients for the production oftablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts etc can be used as such excipients P a fnr taHWs Hragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable excipients for soft gelatine<br><br>
:apsules are e.g. vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semisolid and liquid polyols etc.<br>
Suitable excipients for the manufacture of solutions and syrups are e.g. water, polyols, saccharose, invert sugar, glucose etc.<br>
Suitable excipients for injection solutions are e.g. water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils etc.<br>
Suitable excipients for suppositories are e.g. natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols etc.<br>
Moreover, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, fiavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, in the case of oral administration a daily dosage of about 10 to 1000 mg per person of a compound of general formula I should be appropriate, although the above upper limit can also be exceeded when necessary.<br>
