				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of dehydrated green pepper without using chemicals.<br>
India is one of the major producers of pepper and on an average 40,000 tonnes of black pepper is produced annually. Dehydrated green pepper (DGP) is one of the major pepper products that are exported from India. During 1995-96, India exported 248 tonnes of DGP valued at Rupees 4.6 crores. DGP is widely used in pickles and in garnishing meat products. It is a delicacy much appreciated in Europe, America and Australia. DGP iS an export -oriented value -added product:.<br>
A hitherto known process employs sulphur-di-oxide (SO ;  as<br>
2<br>
one of the additives to suabilise the green colour and prevent brown discolouration. In this process fresh tender green pepper is boiled in water for 15 minutes. The blanched berries are cooled in running cold water and then soaked in potassium meta bi-sulphite solution (3000 ppm) for 2 hours. After the soaking period the berries are washed in water and then dried in a drier at 55oC for 7 hours.<br>
In the Patent no. 176469 the preparation of wrinkled/un-wrinkled dry green pepper using a combination of blanching and microven techniques has been described. In this method fresh pepper berries are put in boiling water and then exposed to microwaves in a microwave oven at a frequency of 2450 MHz for 12 minutes. Then the berries are taken out and dried in a drier at 60oC to a level of 8% moisture in the final product. Tne product was reported to be uniformly green in colour.<br>
In the international market there is an increasing  resist-<br>
ance for the use of SO2 in processed foods from an aesthetic point of view for health reasons. The processing of green pepper by microwave oven technique is not commercially feasible. Hence it was felt desirable to develop a method for making DGP without using SO2 or microwave oven.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of dehydrated green pepper without using chemicals which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above. Another object of the present invention is to avoid chemical additive. Yet another object of the present invention is to retain the green color of the pepper for a longer period.<br>
The principle of the present process invention is to subject the pepper berries to a high temperature short time treatment under specified time and temperature which helps in inactivating the enzymes and stabilizing the green color.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of dehydrated green pepper without using chemicals which comprises introducing fresh green pepper berries into a perforated metallic chamber, passing hot air maintained at a temperature of 150 to 180°C for a period of 1 - 3 min. followed by collecting the berries into a container and drying in the absences of light by conventional methods till the moisture content is reduced upto 8% characterized in the said drying is completed at a emperature of 40 to 60°C for a period of 5 to 7 hrs. to obtain dehydrated berries.<br>
In  an embodiment of the present invention the fresh pepper berries used may be tender and green in colour and of any variety.<br>
(a)	In another embodiment  drying may be effected at a temperature  less  than  65  c so as  to  get  moisture content upto 10%.<br>
The steps of the process are detailed below. In  this  method  fresh pepper  berries are  put  into   a perforated metallic chamber wherein hot air at a temperature of    150-180°C  is  made to blow through. The  hot  air  is produced  by blowing  the  air  over  electricaly  heated coils.The  berries  are  held at this  temperature  for  2-3 minutes. Afetr the heating period the berries are taken  out from  a  side  vent and dried in a cross  flow  drier  at  a temperature of 55°C for about 5- 7 hours. The above process helps in getting DGP having light green or yellowish  green colour.<br>
Commercially  available  fresh  pepper  varieties  like Karimunda,  Panniyur  or Balankotta harvested  at  a  tender stage of 7-8 months maturity are suitable for processing and are used  in the present study. Any other variety having similar characteristics can also be used for this purpose.<br>
DGP is obtained with light green to yellowish green colour. The intensity of the green colour varies with maturity and variety of the pepper berries used.The starting material  is the fresh green pepper of 7-8 months  maturity.<br>
The above product is obtained in the period of  6-8  hours, once the fresh berries are taken for processing.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following examples which should not, however,  be construed to limit the  scope  of  the present invention. Processing conditions with reference to three examples are given below.<br>
Example 1<br>
650 g of fresh pepper spikes were destalked manually and cleaned using running cold water to get 500g of cleaned berries. The berries were subjected to HTST at 172°C for 2 minutes. The material was taken out from the side vent and dried in a drier at a temperature of 50°C for a period of 6 hours. The weight of dry material was lOOg. The product was light green in colour with wrinkled appearance having 4.2% volatile oil, 8% moisture and 237 g/1 bulk density. Rehydration ratio was 1:3.9.<br>
Example 2<br>
400g of fresh pepper spikes were destalked manually and cleaned using running cold v;ater to get 300g of berries. The berries were subjected to HTST at 165°C for 3 minutes. The material was taken out and dried in a drier at a temperature of 55°C for a period of 5 hrs.The weight of the dry material was 62 g. The product was light green in colour and less wrinkled when compared to the product as obtained from example  1.   The product had 6.5% moisture, 4.23%  volatile<br>
oil  and  a bulk density of 198 g/1. Rehydration  ratio was 1:3.9.<br>
Example 3<br>
500 gms of fresh pepper spikes were destalked and cleaned to get 360 gms of berries. The berries were subjected to HTST at 185°C for 1 minute. The material was taken out and dried in a drier at a temperature of 45°C for a period of 7 hours. The weight of the dry material was 70 gms. The product was uniformly green in colour with wrinkled appearance. The product had 7% moisture, 4% volatile oil and a bulk density of 200 g/1. Rehydration ratio was 1:4.0<br>
The nain advantages of the present process invention are:<br>
a.	It  is  possible  to  get  dry  pepper  which   is<br>
light green or yellowish green in colour.<br>
b.	In this process no chemical  is  employed.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A process for the preparation of dehydrated green pepper without using chemicals which comprises introducing fresh green pepper berries into a perforated metallic chamber, passing hot air maintained at a temperature of 150 to 180°C for a period of 1 - 3 min. followed by collecting the berries into a container and drying in the absences of light by conventional methods till the moisture content is reduced upto 8% characterized in the said drying is completed at a temperature of 40 to 65°C for a period of 5 to 7 hrs. to obtain dehydrated berries.<br>
2.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the green pepper is selected from Karimunda, Panniyur, Balankotta variety or any other variety having the similar characteristics.<br>
3.	A process for the preparation of dehydrated green pepper without using chemicals substantially as herein described with reference to the examples.<br></td>
