				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates generally to treating disorders associated with vascular functioning, and more specifically to compounds and methods of treating such disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The vascular system is a prime mediator of homeostasis, playing key roles in the maintainence of normal physiologic functioning. For example, the vascular endothelium's barrier function serves to regulate the entry of fluid, electrolytes, and proteins into tissues, blood vessel tone contributes to the regulation of tissue perfusion, and the vascular endothelium's low mitotic index contributes to the regulation of tissue growth. The term "vasculostasis" refers to the maintenance of tin's homeostatic vascular functioning, and "vasculostatic agents" as agents that seek to address conditions in which vasculostasis is compromised by preventing the loss of or restoring or maintaining vasculostasis.<br>
[0003] Compromised vasculostasis has serious pathologic consequences. For example, if vascular permeability increases beyond manageable levels, the resulting edema may negatively impact tissue and organ function and ultimately survival. Examples where excessive vascular permeability leads to particularly deleterious effects include pulmonary edema, cerebral edema, and cardiac edema (Ritchie AC: Boyd's Textbook of Pathology. London Lea and Febiger, 1990). In general, however, edema in any tissue or organ leads to some loss of normal function, and therefore to the risk of morbidity or even mortality. Similarly, excessive endothelial proliferation may damage tissues (such as the retina in proliferative retinopathies) or fuel unwanted tissue growth (such as with tumor growth).<br>
(0004] Many pathologic and disease situations are marked by multiple disregulations in vasculostasis. AngiogeneKis, for example, encompasses both enhanced vascular proliferation and permeability, as newty-formed blood vessels do not generally exhibit the :;aiTH" level of vascular barrier function as well-established or mature vessels. Examples of<br>
such hyper-permeable vasculature can be found in cancers, vasculoproliferative diseases, retinal diseases, and rheumatoid arthritis. The connection between angiogenesis and hyperpermeability may partly result from the dual action of factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (\TEGF), which induces both endothelial proliferation and vascular permeability. This connection may also reflect the immature nature of angiogenic vessels, in which the. intracellular and/or extracellular structures or mechanisms that establish normal vascular barrier function have not yet fully formed. It may also be the case that angiogenesis and vascular permeability are linked by a co-dependence on common cellular mechanisms, for example in the case of cellular junction disassembly which would serve to enhance both paracellular permeability and cellular migration (both being components of the angiogenic process). A comprehensive treatment for many diseases, then, might involve vasculostatic agents that act upon one or more components of vasculostasis disregulation (based, for example, upon their level of action along intracellular signaling cascades). One such example would be a single therapeutic agent that impacts both angiogenesis and vascular permeability.<br>
[0005] One way of impacting vasculostasis is by influencing endothelial cell responses to environmental signals (such as hypoxia) or vasoactive agents. For example, the vascular endothelium regulates fluid balance by adjusting both transcellular permeability (movement of fluid and proteins across endothelial cells via a network of vesicles) and paracellular permeability (movement of fluid and proteins between inter-endothelial cell junctions). Edema is most commonly thought to result from a breakdown in the inter-endothelial cell barrier, leading to increased paracellular permeability at the capillary and postcapillary venule level. Mechanistically, paracellular vascular leakage results from a breakdown in inter-cellular junctional integrity, via the dissolution of tight junctions and coupled to changes in cytoskeletal support elements that maintain normal cell-to-cell apposition. Several vasoactive mediators can trigger dissolution of these cellular elements, including histamine, bradykinin, thrombin, nitric oxide, eicosanoids (e.g., throniboxanes and leukotrienes), platelet activating factor (PAF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleulans (c.ff., IL-] and IL-6), litpatocyte growth factor (HGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Using YEGF as an example, the sequence of events that lead to vascular leakage is generally believed to be as follows: reduced blood flow (e.g., as a result of<br>
thrombus formation) leads to tissue hypoxia, which leads to the upregulation of VEGF production, which leads to induction of vascular leakage. This VEGF effect is at the level of the endothelial cell, in other words VEGF binding to specific VEGF receptors expressed on endothelial cells leads to a cascade of intracellular events culminating in the loss of normal intercellular barrier function. Therefore, by affecting these intracellular events, vasulostatic agents could counter the negative effects of environmental signals such as hypoxia or vasoactive mediators such as VEGF, and thereby work to restore vasculostasis.<br>
[0006] The cascade of events that leads to the loss of endothelial barrier function is complex and incompletely understood. Data support a role for kinases as at least one aspect of this process. For example, VEGF-mediated edema has been shown to involve intracellular signaling by Src family Icinases, protein kinase C, and Akt kinase. Kinases are believed to mediate the phosphorylation of junctional proteins such as beta-catenin and vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, leading to the dissolution of adherens junctions and the dissociation of cadherin-catenin complexes from their cytoskeletal anchors. In addition, proteins which regulate the intercellular contractile machinery such as myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and myosin light chain (MLC) are also activated, resulting in cellular contraction, and therefore an opening of intercellular junctions.<br>
[0007] Maintaining or restoring vasculostasis should be beneficial to overall patient outcome in situations such as inflammation, allergic diseases, cancer, cerebral stroke, myocardial infarction, pulmonary and cardiac insufficiency, renal failure, and retinopathies, lo name a few. In addition, edema formation is a recognized but unwanted consequence of many therapeutic interventions, such as immunotherapy, cancer chemotherapy and radiation therapy, therefore vasculostatic agents that inhibit vascular permeability could be used in a co-therapy approach to reduce the deleterious side-effects of such therapies. Furthermore, in many cases edema formation causes uneven deliver}' of therapeutic agents to diseased tissues, therefore vasculostatic agents that inhibit vascular permeability could be used in a co-therapy approach to enhance delivery and efficacy of such therapies. Finally, as edema :s a general consequence of tissue hypoxia, it can also be concluded that inhibition of vascular leakage represents a potential approach to the treatment of tissue hypoxia. For example, interruption of blood flow by pathologic conditions (such as thrombus formation)<br>
or medical intervention (such as cardioplegia, organ transplantation, and angioplasty) or physical trauma, could he treated both acutely and prophylactically using vasculostatic agents that reduce vascular permeability.<br>

10135] In one embodiment, the present invention is based on the discovery that a combination therapy including interleukirt-2 (IL-2) and chemical compounds described herein, some of which are effective kinase inhibitors, administered during IL-2 therapy,<br>
mitigates or lessens the adverse effects.of IL-2.   While not wanting to be bound by a particular theory, n is likely that the effect occurs while preserving or enhancing the beneficial effect of IL-2 such that the disease or disorder is treated. While IL-2 is described in the present application as an illustrative example, it should be understood that the invention includes cornbination therapy including a compound of the invention, including bul not limited to vasculostatic agents, such as tyrosine, serine or threonine lanase inhibitors, for example. Src-family inhibitors, and immunomodulatory molecules, hi particular, such immunomodulatory molecules include those that result in vascular leakage. Cytokines, and in particular IL-2, are examples of such immunomodulatory molecules.<br>
10136] Such inhibitors, in combination with IL-2, are effective in blocking vascular leakage typically associated with IL-2 adminstration. Thus, compositions and methods are provided for treating disorders associated with VLS.   hi one embodiment, the invention provides a composition containing a therapeutically effective amount of IL-2 and a vasculostatic agent or compound as described herein in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
J0137] Some of the compounds are kinase inhibitors, such as Src-family tyrosine kinases, and therefore are useful in treating a wide variety of disorders resulting from aberrant kinase activity, in addition to treating disorders associates with LL-2 administration.  Kinase-associated disorders are those disorders which result from aberrant kinase activity, and/or which are alleviated by the inhibition of one or more enzymes within a kinase family. For example, Lck inhibitors are of value in the treatment of a number of such disorders (e.g., the treatment of autoimmune diseases), as Lck inhibition blocks T cell activation. Similarly, Src family inhibitors are of value in treating a variety of cancers as Src inhibition impacts tumor cell invasion, metastases and survival.<br>

[0142] Src-farnily tyrosme kinases other than Lck, such as Hck and Fgr, are important in the Fc gamma receptor induced respiratory burst of neutrophils as well as the Fc gamma receptor responses of monocyles and macrophages. The compositions and methods of the present invention may be useful in inhibiting the Fc gamma induced respiratory burst response in neutrophiis. and may also be useful in inhibiting the Fc gamma dependent production ofTNF alpha. The ability to inhibit Fc gamma receptor dependent neutrophil, monocyte and macrophage responses would result in additional anti-inflammatory activity for the compounds employed in invention methods. This activity would be especially of<br>
value, for example, in the treatment of inflammatory' diseases, such as arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease. The compositions and methods of the present invention may also be useful in the treatment of autoimmune glomerulonephritis and other instances of glomerulonephritis induced by deposition of immune complexes in the kidney that trigger Fc gamma receptor responses and which can lead to kidney damage.<br>
10143] In addition, certain S re-family fyrosine kinases, such as Lyn and Src, may be important in the Fc epsilon receptor induced degranulation of mast cells and basophils that plays an important role in asthma, allergic rhinitis, and other allergic disease. Fc epsilon receptors are stimulated by IgE-antigen complexes. Compounds employed in the methods of the present invention may inhibit the Fc epsilon induced degranulation responses. The ability to inhibit Fc epsilon receptor dependent mast cell and basopbil responses may result in additional anti-inflammatory activity for the present compounds beyond their effect on T cells.<br>

[0169] In the treatment or prevention of conditions which involve compromised vasculostasis an appropriate dosage level will generally be about 0.01 to 500 mg per kg patient body weight per day which can be administered in single or multiple doses. Preferably, the dosage level will be about 0.01 to about 250 mg/kg per day; more preferably about 0.5 to about 100 mg/kg per day. A suitable dosage level may be about 0.01 to 250 mg/kg per day, about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg per day, or about 0.1 to 50 mg/kg per day or 1 .Omg/lcg per day. Within this range the dosage may be 0.05 to 0.5, 0.5 to 5 or 5 to 50 mg/kg per day for example. The Examples section shows that one of the exemplary compounds was preferred at 0.1 mg/kg/day while another was effective at about 1.0 mg/kg/day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 1.0 to 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient, particularly 1.0, 5.0,10.0, 15.0. 20.0, 25.0, 50.0, 75.0,100.0, 150.0, 200.0, 250.0, 300.0, 400.0, 500.0, 600.0, 750.0, 800.0, 900.0, and 1000.0 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to he treated. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day, preferably once or twice per day.   There may be a period of no administration followed by another regimen of administration. Preferably, administration of<br>
the compound is closely associated with the schedule of IL-2 administration. For example, administration can be prior to, simultaneously with or immediately following IL-2 administration<br>
|0170] It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage lot any particular patient may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the host undergoing therapy.<br>
(0171] Another embodiment described herein is based on the discovery that a compound that is a vasculostatic agent alone or in combination with an effective amount of therapeutic antibody (or therapeutic fragment thereof), chemotherapeutic or immunotoxic agent, is an effective therapeutic regimen for treatment of tumors, for example.   While doxorubicin, docetaxel, or taxol are described in the present application as illustrative examples of chemotherapeutic agents, it should be understood that the invention includes combination therapy including a compound of the invention, including but not limited to vasculostatic agents, such as tyrosine, serine or threonine kinase inhibitors, for example, Src-family inhibitors, and any chemotherapeutic agent or therapeutic antibody.<br>
[0172] Such vasculostatic agents, in combination with chemotherapeutic agents or therapeutic antibodies are effective in blocking vascular permeability and/or vascular leakage and/or angiogenesis. In one embodiment, the invention provides a composition containing a therapeutically effective amount of a chemotherapeutic agent and a vasculostatic agent in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
10173] In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for reducing the tumor burden in a subject, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of chemotherapeutic agent in combination with a compound that is a vasculostatic agent. In an illustrative example, the method includes use of at least one of the invention compounds e.g.. as set forth in Structures 1, II, HI, Ilia, IV, V, VI or VH or any combination thereof, with the chemotherapeiuic agent. In one aspect, the compound is set forth in FIGURE 1. It<br>
should be understood that the tumor burden in a subject can be reduced prior to treatment with a compound of the invention through surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiation treatment or other methods known to those of skill in.the art.<br>
[0174] The compounds according to this invention may contain one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and thus occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. The term "stereoisomer" refers to a chemical compounds which differ from each other only in the way that the different groups in the molecules are oriented in space. Stereoisomers have the same molecular weight, chemical composition, and constitution as another, but with the atoms grouped differently. That is, certain identical chemical moieties are at different orientations in space and, therefore, when pure, have the ability to rotate the plane of polarized light. However, some pure Stereoisomers may have an optical rotation that is so slight that it is undetectable with present instrumentation. All such isomeric forms of these compounds are included in the present invention.<br>
[0175] Each stereo genie carbon may be of R or S configuration. Although the specific compounds exemplified in this application may be depicted in a particular configuration, compounds having either the opposite stereochemistry at any given chiral center or mixtures thereof are also envisioned. When chiral centers are found in the derivatives of this invention, it is to be understood that this invention encompasses all possible Stereoisomers. The terms "optically pure compound" or "optically pure isomer" refers to a single stereoisomer of a chiral compound regardless of the configuration of the compound.<br>
[0176] Several illustrative compounds employed in the methods of the present invention are inhibitors of kinases and therefore are useful in treating a wide variety of disorders resulting from aberrant Idnase activity. Examples of kinases include Src-family tyrosine kinases and their associated disorders, which result from aberrant tyrosine kinase activity, and/or winch are alleviated by the inhibition of one or more of the enzymes within the Src family.

EXAMPLE 3 INHIBITION OF VASCULAR PERMEABILITY<br>
[0376] IL-2 is used clinically to treat metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma and the dose-limiting toxicity for IL-2 is Vascular Leak Syndrome (VLS). Two representative examples from distinct chemotype series were selected for initial study in the reduction of IL-2-induced VLS (see FIGURE 1 compounds). The compounds were pre-screened for in vivo reduction of vascular permeability and mere was no observable gross toxicity as single agents at 20-fold higher doses.<br>
[0377] The results of the studies shown in FIGURES 7-8 indicate that representative compounds of the invention show inhibition of vascular leak in vivo. There were no effects on T cell proliferation in prescribed dose range (see FIGURES 10-11) and no effects on<br>
anti-tumor activity of IL-2 (melanoma model; see FIGURE 9).   The following experiments exemplify the results for co-drug therapy.<br>
10378] BalbC mice were given 9 injections of the indicated dose of murine IL-2 (in this example formulated in saline with 5% bovine serum albumin) and/or invention compounds over a.period of 4 days.   Animals were then sacrificed followed by collection, blotting and weighing (wet weight) of heart, lungs, and spleen. Organs were then dried at 80°C for 24 hours and weighed (dry weight). N=5/group, p100%.   The results are shown in FIGURE 7.<br>
[0379] BalbC mice were given 9 injections of the indicated dose of murine IL-2 and/or invention compounds over a period of 4 days. Animals were then sacrificed followed by collection, blotting and weighing (wet weight) of heart, lungs, and spleen. Organs were then dried at 80°C for 24 hours and weighed (dry weight). N=5/group, p100%.   The results are shown in FIGURE 8.<br>
[0380] Syngeneic B16 melanoma cells were injected I.V. in order to establish lung metastases in C57 mice. Beginning 10 days after cells were injected, 100,OOOU of IL-2 and/or indicated invention compounds were given IP. every 8 hours for 5 days. Animals were sacrificed at day 18, lungs were collected and scored using image analysis software. N=5/group, p
in mg/kg while IL-2 concentration is given in parenthesis kilounits. The results are shown in FIGURE 9.<br>
[0381 j An IL-2 dependent human T cell line, CTLL2, was used to evaluate IL-2 dependent proliferation over 96 hours hi the presence of 50 pg of human recombinant IL-2 (R&amp;D Systems) and the indicated compounds using the XTT assay. N-(2-(lH-indol-2-yl)-phenyl)-phthalamic acid (compound D - in the 1 mg/kg range, in this example formulated in 50% PEG400:50% water) typically had no significant impact on IL-2 induced T-cell proliferation. The results are shown in FIGURE 10.<br>
[0382] An IL-2 dependent human T cell line, CTLL2, was used to evaluate IL-2 dependent proliferation over 96 hours in the presence of 50 pg of human recombinant IL-2 (R&amp;D Systems) and the indicated compounds using the XTT assay. 6,7-bis(3-hydroxyphenyl)-pteridine-2,4-diamine, sulfate salt (compound E - in the 0.1 mg/kg range, in this example formulated in 50% PEG400:50% water) typically had no significant impact on LL-2 induced T-cell proliferation in the therapeutic range (<lp the results are shown in figure></lp>
[0383] Thus, representative examples from two distinct chemotype series in the present application (shown hi FIGURE 1) indicate that, for example, N-(2-(lH-indol-2-yl)-phenyl)-phthalamic acid (compound D - in the 1 mg/kg range, hi this example formulated in 50% PEG400:50% water) and 6,7-bis(3-hydroxyphenyl)-pteridine-2,4-diamine, sulfate salt (compound E - in the 0.1 mg/kg range, in Ms example formulated in 50% PEG400:50% water), are effective in reducing VLS by 80-100% in vivo.<br>
[0384] Both of the exemplary compounds performed well hi important initial tests, including 1) inhibition of VLS at normal and elevated doses of LL-2; 2) no interference with Tl.,-2 mediated anti-tumor activity; 3) no inhibition of IL-2 induced T cell proliferation in the likely therapeutic dose range; and 4) neither compound elicited gross observable toxicity.These results indicate that invention compounds could be used in conjunction with IL-2 to prevent dose-limiting VLS and thereby increase the clinical application and therapeutic dose range of IL-2.<br>
10385] Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is an acute, severe injury to most or all of both lungs causing fluid leak into the lungs. Patients with ARDS experience severe shortness of breath and often require mechanical ventilation (life support) because of respiratory failure.   ARDS has also been called some of the following terms: Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema; Increased-pemieability pulmonary edema; Stiff lung; Shock lung; Adult respiratory distress syndrome; Acute respiratory distress syndrome. Two representative compounds of the invention were selected for initial study in the reduction of ARDS.<br>
[0386] NIH Swiss mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of 1.5 mg/kg Oleic Acid of (in this example formulated in saline) and/or invention compounds.   Four hours subsequent to injection animals were sacrificed followed by collection, blotting and weighing (wet weight) of the lungs. Lungs were then dried at 80°C for 24 hours and weighed (dry weight). N=4/group, 6,7-bis(3-hydroxyphenyl)-pteridine-2,4-diamine, sulfate salt (compound E - in the 0.5 mg/kg range, in this example formulated in 50% PEG400:50% water) typically reduced ARDS-induced edema by &gt;50% while 4-[4-amino-6-(3,4-<br>
dihydroxyphenyl)pteridin-7-yl]benzene-l,2-diol (compound F - in the 0.5 mg/kg range, in this example formulated in 50% PEG400:50% water) typically reduced ARDS-induced edema by &gt;100%.   The results are shown in FIGURE 12.<br>

[0393] REDUCTION OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION<br>
[0394] Myocardial Infarct Data<br>
[0395] A rodent model of acute myocardial infarct, in which the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) is occluded for 60 min followed by reperfusion, was used to detennine whether test agents reduced infarct size at 24 hours. Several examples of the compounds cited in this application significantly reduced infarct size as compared to controls.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Myocardial infarcts were created in Sprague-Dawley rats (200-300 g body weight) by a 60 niin occlusion of the LAD followed by LAD reperfusion. At 90 min post-reperfusion, either vehicle alone or test agents were injected IV. At 24 hr post-treatment, the ischemic zone (area al-risk. AAR) was delineated by re-ligation of the LAD followed by IV injection of alkali blue dye, after which hearts were sectioned along the short axis and stained using triphenyltetrazolium chloride to delineate viable from infarcted myocardium. Photographic images were then analyzed using morphometric software to calculate infarct area as a percent of the at-risk area.<br>

[0400] EXAMPLE 6<br>
[0401] INHIBITION OF Src-FAMTLY KINASES, c-Src AND Yes<br>
[0402] The ability of compounds to inhibit the activity of two Src-family kinases (c-Src and Yes) was directly tested. The table below presents data for several compounds, which in most cases inhibited one or both kinases at concentrations of 
Kinase reactions were conducted in 96-well plates by combining recombinant human c-Src or Yes (280 ng/well, Panvera, Madison WI), ATP (3 pM), a tyrosine kinase substrate (PTK2, 250 |aM. Promega Corp., Madison WI), and test agents (at concentrations ranging from 1 nM to 100 u.M); the buffer used was Src kinase reaction buffer (Upstate USA, Lake Placid NY). After reacting at 90 minutes at room temperature, residual ATP was determined using a luciferase-based assay (KinaseGlo, Promega Corp.) as a measure of lanase activity. Data from four wells were then averaged and used to determine !C5o values for lite Lcsl compounds (Prism software package, GraphPad Software, San Diego CA). ND: not determined.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
EFFECTS OF.INVENTION COMPOUNDS ON ANGIQGENESIS<br>
[0403] Referring to FIGURES 13 and 14, amurine model of angiogenesis was used to screen compounds for their capacity to inhibit angiogenesis. The graph presents representative examples of.compounds cited in this application which successfully inhibited angiogenesis in vivo. In the graph, compound A is 6,7-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-pteridin-4-ylamine sulfate salt. Athymic WeHi (nu/nu) mice were first injected with 400 pis of an ice-cold tumor-denved extracellular matrix substrate, matrigel (Becton-Dickinson) infused with 400 ng/nil of bFGF or VEGF (R&amp;D Systems) which rapidly solidifies into a subdermal plug at body temperature. Mice were subsequently injected intaperitoneally with 10 nig/kg of the indicated compounds bid for four days. On the fourth day mice were injected intravenously with 0.5 rags of a FITC-conjugated endothelial specific lectin (Banderiea Simplifica, Vector Laboratories). Twenty minutes after injection of the lectin, mice were eutlianized, matrigel plugs were then extracted, solublized in PBS with mechanical grinding and the fluorescent content of individual plugs was quantified. Values shown are normalized to control values from groups of 5.<br>
