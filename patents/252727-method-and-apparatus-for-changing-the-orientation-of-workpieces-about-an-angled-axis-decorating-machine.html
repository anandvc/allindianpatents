				<td>Method and Apparatus for Changing the Orientation<br>
of Workpieces about an Angled Axis for a Decorator<br>
Cross reference to related applications<br>
Not applicable.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
1. Field of the invention: The present invention relates to workpiece supply<br>
and delivery systems situated upstream and downstream of the flow of a workpiece through<br>
one or more decorating stations of a decorating machine and, more particularly, to<br>
construction and operation of a workpiece transfer mechanism designed to operate about an<br>
angled axis for automatically changing a vertical to horizontal or a horizontal to vertical<br>
orientations of the workpieces with continuous motion or, if desired, intermittent motion.<br>
2. Description of the prior art: U.S. Patent Numbers 2,231,535; 2,261,255;<br>
2,721,516; 3,146,705; 3,3SS,574; and 5,524,535 disclose intermittent motion type<br>
decorating machines using an indexing drive system to impart intermittent traveling motion<br>
to an endless conveyor chain provided with workpiece carriers used to supply workpieces<br>
such as a bottle made of glass or plastic. A chain conveyor disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,388,574 is provided with workpiece carriers arranged in a side-by-side relation and used<br>
for supporting each bottle in a horizontal orientation while intermittently moved along a<br>
path of travel through a decorating apparatus. The bottle is supported at its opposite ends by<br>
clamping chucks one of which is driven by a crank arm on a journal extending from a<br>
bearing support and the other clamping chuck is moveable to releasably engage and<br>
rotatably support the bottle about a horizontal axis extending along the extended length of<br>
the bottle. The bottle is rotated by a drive member brought into a driving relation with the<br>
crank arm on the protruding journal from the bearing support. The clamping chucks are<br>
operatively supported on a base which is secured to chain-links forming the endless<br>
conveyor chain extending along the path of travel of bottles through the decorating machine.<br>
In intermittent motion decorating machines, a bottle is moved by the endless<br>
chain conveyor through a predetermined distance, stopped, moved again through a<br>
predetermined distance, stopped and again moved until each bottle advances by the<br>
sequence of motions completely through all of the decorating stations of the decorating<br>
machine. A decorating station will be provided at one or more places where the bottle<br>
comes to a stop. The decorating cycle is essentially made up of two equal parts. One half<br>
of the decorating cycle is used for the decoration and the remaining half of the cycle is used<br>
for the indexing movement of the bottle through the decorating machine. There was no<br>
overlap between the decorating and indexing cycles.<br>
At each decorating station while the bottle is stopped from traveling motion,<br>
a decorating screen is displaced into line contact by an associated squeegee with the surface<br>
of the bottle while the bottle is rotated about the longitudinal axis thereof. During the first<br>
part of the decorating cycle, the screen is moved synchronous with the peripheral speed of<br>
the rotating bottle to avoid smearing during decoration at the line contact established by a<br>
squeegee with the bottle. The squeegee remains stationary during the decorating process.<br>
When the screen moves to the end of its travel, the bottle has rotated 360Â° whereupon the<br>
screen drive mechanism maintains the screen stationary for the remaining part of the<br>
decorating cycle while the bottle is moved from the decorating station and an undecorated<br>
bottle is positioned at the decorating station.<br>
Thcrmosetting ink was usually the printing medium in decorating machines,<br>
particularly when multiple color decoration was desired. Ink of only one color is applied at<br>
each decorating station and to decorate with multiple colors requires a multiple of<br>
corresponding decoration stations. When the different colors interleave in a given area of<br>
the bottle, because the same area is contacted with a screen for each color it is necessary that<br>
the applied ink/color is a solid and will not smear when additional ink/color is applied.<br>
Although the thermosetting ink is solidified after each printing operation, it is necessary to<br>
cure the ink by feeding the bottles through a furnace after discharging from the decorating<br>
machine. In co-pending patent application Serial No. 09/079,753 filed May 15,1998 there<br>
are disclosed a decorating method and apparatus to allow curing of ink decoration applied at<br>
one decorating station before additional decoration is applied. The dwell period of the<br>
intermittent advancing motion by the conveyor chain is used to apply decoration and to cure<br>
the applied decoration all at different spaced apart sites along the course of travel by the<br>
bottles in the decorating machine. All the decoration on a bottle delivered from the<br>
decoration machine can be cured so that the bottles can be loaded directly into a shipping<br>
container.<br>
As disclosed in United States Patent No. 5,524,535 the machine cycle in an<br>
intermittent motion decorating machine is altered to attain an increase to the workpiece<br>
decoration rate..The altered machine cycle provides that the portion of the cycle for<br>
conveyor indexing has a reduced duration in order to provide an increased part of the<br>
machine cycle for decorating. The conventional chain conveyor required an indexer drive to<br>
transmit the torque required to rapidly accelerate and decelerate a chain conveyor laden with<br>
carriers and including the compliment of bottles or workpieces processed in a decorating<br>
machine. A deviation to the use of a chain conveyor for workpieces in an intermittent<br>
decorating machine is disclosed in co-pending application serial no. 09/209,S39, filed<br>
October 8, 1998 and notably includes the use of elongated barrel cams and transfer disks<br>
arranged to provide a continuous traveling motion to workpiece carriers which is interrupted<br>
only at each decorating station and, when provided, at each curing station.<br>
An alterative to an intermittent motion decorating machine is a continuous<br>
type motion decorating machine as disclosed, for example, in United States patent number<br>
3,251,298 to decorate a bottle during continuous, uninterrupted, linear travel on a conveyor<br>
along one or more spaced apart decorating stations. It is necessary to match the speed of the<br>
linear advancement of a squeegee at a decorating station with the linear speed of<br>
advancement of the bottle by the conveyor and match the speed of the peripheral speed of<br>
the bottle with the linear speed of a decorating screen. The occurrences of speed matching<br>
are required at each decorating station in the machine. The continuous motion of the<br>
conveyor eliminated the need for an indexer box to provide the intermittent motion by the<br>
conveyor in an intermittent motion decorating machine.<br>
In U.S. Patent No. 3,407,915 a main conveyor is constructed to reorientate<br>
workpieces from the generally vertical position to a generally horizontal position for<br>
registration and decoration and then back to a generally vertical position for discharge from<br>
the main conveyor. Unlike conventional conveyors for decorating machines, the conveyor<br>
has two functions, that is, its normal function of conveying the workpieces through the<br>
decorating machine and the additional function of reorienting the workpiece from a vertical<br>
position to a horizontal position and then back to a vertical position. The combination of<br>
the two functions sought to eliminate the need for additional equipment to reorientate the<br>
supply of bottles to and from the conveyor of the decorating machine.<br>
United States Patent No. 3,648,821 discloses a workpiece transferring<br>
apparatus to transfer workpieces individually from a supply conveyor to a decorator<br>
conveyor where decoration is applied while the workpieces are horizontally oriented in an<br>
intermittent type decorating machine and thence from a decorator conveyor to a delivery<br>
conveyor in which the transfer operations produce horizontal to vertical rcoricntations of the<br>
workpieces. The change to the workpiece orientation also occurs between a conveyor<br>
supplying bottles in a vertical orientation and the conveyor supplying the bottled in a<br>
horizontal orientation to a decorating machine. Each workpiece is repositioncd by rotary<br>
type movements about two perpendicular and intersecting axes, one of which is the<br>
rotational axis of a rotary support shaft extending parallel with the rotational axes of the<br>
drive sprockets for the chain conveyor. The mass of material comprising the workpiece and<br>
support structure undergoing the rotary type movements limits the operating speed.<br>
Workpiece handling equipment disclosed in United States Patent no. 5,524,535 enables an<br>
increase to the workpiece handling rate by a design of structural parts eliminating pivot<br>
arms positioned by a spring to reduce an adverse effect of inertia. Captive restraints hold<br>
each workpiece during transfer from a feed conveyor to the conveyor of the decorating<br>
machine and from the conveyor of the decorating machine to the delivery conveyor.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a workpiece transfer for<br>
supplying and unloading workpieces in a decorator machine by gripping and releasing each<br>
workpiece during the transferring operations by movement into and out of receiving and<br>
hand-off sites with great precision.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a workpiece transfer<br>
embodying a construction of parts to grip a workpiece while in a freestanding condition on a<br>
moving conveyor, reorientate and transfer the workpiece to a workpiece carrier while<br>
moving or at dwell period of operation of the conveyor system and then take the workpiece<br>
from the carrier while moving or at dwell period of operation by the conveyor system,<br>
reorientate the workpiece to again regain a freestanding condition and released for<br>
advancing movement by a moving conveyor.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved transfer<br>
for transferring workpieces for a decorator conveyor of a decorating machine to and/or from<br>
transport conveyors used to supply and/or deliver workpieces for the decorating machine.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a workpiece transfer<br>
for moving workpieces by either an intermittent motion or continuous motion.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a workpiece transfer<br>
for moving workpieces to and/or from an intermittent chain conveyor system driven by an<br>
indexer box or, if desired, a continuous motion conveyor system using cams and workpiece<br>
carrier disks.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a workpiece transfer for<br>
supplying workpieces to a decorating machine particularly bottles at a greater throughput<br>
rate than heretofore attainable.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide an apparatus to<br>
transfer workpieces for either or both of the supply and unloading of workpieces from a<br>
decorating machine wherein the transfer is constructed for high speed motions between a<br>
supply conveyor where the workpieces are vertically oriented and a decorator conveyor<br>
where the workpieces arc horizontally oriented for decoration as well as at the delivery end<br>
of the decorating conveyor where the workpieces again undergo high speed motions from<br>
the horizontal orientation to the vertical orientation on a discharge conveyor.<br>
Summary of the present invention<br>

Detailed description of the preferred embodiments<br>
Referring now to Figures 1 and 2 of the drawings, there is illustrated a<br>
decorating machine 10 having a base 11 for supporting a workpiece conveyor 12 to convey<br>
workpieces which, for the purpose of describing the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, consist of bottles. The bottles each have an elongated longitudinal axis A<br>
extending centrally in a uniformly spaced relation from the center of the bottle and centered<br>
along the elongated length of the bottle. The axis A of a bottle is changed from the vertical<br>
to the horizontal by bottle loading equipment L and remains horizontal while the bottles are<br>
conveyed by conveyor 12 along three successively arranged decorating stations PI, P2 and<br>
P3. The bottles are advanced from the last decorating station P3 to bottle unloading<br>
equipment U.<br>
The drive arrangement for the bottle loading equipment L, the decorating<br>
machine and the bottle unloading equipment U include, as shown in Figures 3-6, a main<br>
drive motor 14 having a drive output shaft connected by a belt 14A to a first line shaft 15<br>
rotatably supported by spaced apart pillow blocks 15A. Spaced along line shaft 15 are five<br>
drive output pulleys 16,17,18,19 and 20 provided with belts 16A, 17A, 18A, 19Aand<br>
20A, respectively. The belt 20A extends to a pulley on a second line shaft 21 supported by<br>
spaced apart pillow blocks 21A and used to drive the bottle loading equipment L and<br>
unloading equipment U. For this purpose, drive output pulleys 22A and 22B are connected<br>
by belts 22C and 22D, respectively, to drive input shafts of cone worm drives 22E and 22F<br>
for workpiece transfer apparatus forming part of the bottle loading equipment L and bottle<br>
unloading equipment U. Also driven by the second line shaft 21 arc sprockets 23 A and 23B<br>
connected by drive chains 23C and 23D to sprockets 23E and 23F, respectively, mounted on<br>
drive input shafts for supply and delivery conveyors 24A and 24B, respectively. The<br>
sprocket 23E for supply conveyor 24A supplies drive torque to a drive shaft 23G which is<br>
transferred by drive sprocket 23H through an idler shaft 231 having input and output<br>
sprockets connected by chains for driving a sprocket 23J mounted on a drive roller 23K.<br>
The drive roller is mounted for rotation at a spaced site from an idler roller 23L to support<br>
an endless belt 24C moving at a constant rate of travel to advance undecorated bottles along<br>
the course of travel established by the conveyor belt.<br>
Drive shaft 23G is also provided with a drive gear meshing with a drive gear<br>
23 M on an idler shaft on wlu'ch there is also mounted a sprocket for a drive chain 23N used<br>
to provide torque to an input shaft for a drive 23P. The drive output gear of the drive 23P is<br>
mounted to the end of a timing screw 25 having a helical groove 25 A for controlling the<br>
advancing movement of bottles by the conveyor as will be described in greater detail<br>
hereinafter. The sprocket 23B, drive chain 23D and sprocket 23F of the delivery conveyor<br>
24B supply torque to a drive shaft 23Q which is transferred by meshing drive gears 23R to<br>
an idler shaft 23S having a drive output sprocket 23T connected by a chain to a sprocket<br>
23U mounted on a drive roller 23V. The drive roller 23V mounted for rotation at a spaced<br>
site from an idler roller 23 W for supporting an endless belt 24D used for discharge<br>
decorated bottles along the course of travel for handling and shipping. While the bottle<br>
supply conveyor 24A and the bottle delivery conveyor 24B utilize horizontally orientated<br>
endless belts 24C and 24D, respectively, for supporting bottles, the present invention is<br>
equally applicable for use with other forms of conveyors having, for example, bottle carriers<br>
to support bottles in alternative ways which include, for example, bottle carriers on supply<br>
and delivery conveyors extending along a lateral side or above the conveyance paths for the<br>
bottles.<br>
The belts 16A, 17A and 19A extend to gear drives 26, 27 and 29,<br>
respectively, having output shafts secured to rotate cams 30, 31 and 32 (Figures 1, 3 and 4).<br>
The cams 30-32 are formed with closed cam tracks 30A, 31A and 32A also known as face<br>
grooves or positive cams. Bottles are decorated at each decorating station in an identical<br>
fashion by initiating screen travel when a bottle arrives at the decorating station. Figure 4<br>
illustrates the cam tracks 30A, 31A and 32A of the respective cams are each constructed to<br>
form two bottle decorating cycles each separated by a screen dwell cycle. More specifically,<br>
cam track 30A consists of a screen dwell cycle 30B, bottle decorating cycle 30C, screen<br>
dwell cycle 3 OB' and a bottle decorating cycle 30C'. Cam track 31A consists of a screen<br>
dwell cycle 3IB, bottle decorating cycle 31C, screen dwell cycle IB' and a bottle decorating<br>
cycle 31C'. Cam track 32A consists of a screen dwell cycle 32B, bottle decorating cycle<br>
32C, screen dwell cycle 32B' and a bottle decorating cycle 32C'. In the first bottle<br>
decorating cycle, the decorating screens at each decorating station PI, P2 and P3 are linearly<br>
displaced in one direction during which decoration is applied to a bottle at each decorating<br>
station. After these bottles are decorated, the screens remain stationary during screen dwell<br>
cycles and then the screens are reciprocated in the opposite direction during which<br>
decoration is applied to succeeding bottles at each decorating station. The cam tracks 30A,<br>
31A and 32A define the precise occurrence of events with respect to the movement of the<br>
bottles by the workpiecc conveyor 12 since the cams 30-32 and the workpiece conveyor are<br>
drivingly interconnected in the same drive train and driven by the same main drive motor<br>
14. Each cam has a follower in the respective cam track to pivot an oscillating drive output<br>
at each of the decorating stations as will be discussed in greater detail hereinafter. The belt<br>
ISA driven by the first line shaft 15 extends to a pulley 20B mounted on a fotatably<br>
supported shaft having a gear 28 meshing with a gear 33. Gears 2S and 33 form a speed<br>
reduction relationship. Gear 33 is mounted on an intermediate shaft 34 supported by pillow<br>
blocks and having a pulley 35 provided with a belt 36 extending to a pulley 37 mounted on<br>
a third line shaft 38.<br>
As shown in Figures 3, 5 and 7, line shaft 38 is rotatably supported by two<br>
spaced apart arms 40 extending from the base 11 in a cantilever fashion and secured by<br>
bolts to the base of the decorating machine. The outer most ends of the arms 40 are<br>
connected to an elongated cover plate 41. As shown' in Figures 5, 6, 7 and 8, secured to<br>
each of the arms 40 are spaced apart spacers 42 that extend horizontally and outwardly in<br>
opposite directions from the arms 40. The outer ends of the spacers 42 carry vertically<br>
extending mounting plates 43 from which various drive gears project only at the unload end<br>
of the conveyor. As shown in Figures 4 and 5, the third line shaft 38 is rotatably supported<br>
by bearings 44 mounted on portions of the arms 40 adjacent the base 11 and latterly<br>
outwardly of each of the bearings 44 there is also a bearing assembly 45 mounted by a<br>
carrier bracket 46 to the base 11. The bearing assemblies 45 rotatably support the outer end<br>
portions of the third line shaft 38. As shown only in Figures 4 and 6, mounted on each of<br>
the terminal end portions outwardly of each bearing assembly 45 of the third line shaft 38<br>
are worm gears 47. A worm gear 47 near the bottle loading equipment L meshes with a<br>
gear wheel 48 and the worm gear 47 at the unloading end of the decorating machine meshes<br>
with a gear wheel 49. The gear wheels 48 and 49 are mounted on drive shafts 50 and 51,<br>
respectively.<br>
As best shown in Figures 3, 4 and 5, spaced apart carrier supply disks 52 and<br>
53 are mounted on the inboard and outboard ends, respectively, of drive shaft 50 and spaced<br>
apart carrier return disks 54 and 55 are mounted on the inboard and outboard ends,<br>
respectively, of drive shaft 51. A pulley 56 is mounted on the third line shaft 38 and joined<br>
by a drive belt 57 to a pulley 58 mounted on a drive shaft 59 extending horizontally above<br>
the drive shaft 51. Tension in the drive belt 57 is controllably set by using fasteners to<br>
secure a roller support arm 57A, Figure 3, rotatably supporting a slack adjusting roller 57B<br>
in a fixed position to arm 40 for establishing the position for roller 57B to impose a desired<br>
tension on belt 57. As shown in Figure 6, a drive pinion gear 60 is mounted on the<br>
horizontally extended end of drive shaft 59 and meshes with idler gears 61 and 62 which in<br>
turn mesh with idler gears 63 and 64, respectively. Idler gear 61 meshes with a drive gear<br>
65 mounted on a support shaft of a barrel cam 66; idler gear 62 meshes with a drive gear 67<br>
mounted on a support shaft of a barrel cam 68; idler gear 63 meshes with a drive gear 69<br>
mounted on a support shaft of a barrel cam 70; and idler gear 64 meshes with a drive gear<br>
71 mounted on a support shaft of a barrel cam 72. As shown in Figures 4 and 7, the barrel<br>
cam 66, 68, 70 and 72 are rotatably supported by bearings 73 carried on the support shafts at<br>
opposite ends of the barrel cams. The bearings 73 are mounted in suitable apertures formed<br>
in the vertically extending mounting plates 43 such that the barrel cams can rotate about<br>
horizontal axes with the axes of barrel cams 66 and 68 lying in a common horizontal plane<br>
and there below the axes of rotation of barrel cams 70 and 72 lie in a common horizontal<br>
plane. Each of the barrel cams 66, 68, 70 and 72 have a closed cam track 66 A, 68 A, 70A<br>
and 72A which is a continuous groove milled in the cam body engaged by a roller attached<br>
to a follower for executing movements by workpiece carriers as will be described in greater<br>
detail hereinafter to provide continuous traveling motion until interrupted by a dwell period<br>
"D" provided for the printing operation.<br>
As shown in Figures S and 12A-12C, the closed cam tracks 66A, 6SA, 70A<br>
and 72 A receive spaced apart roller parts of cam followers 74 and 75 mounted on each of a<br>
plurality of discrete and independently moveable bottle carriers 76. The details of the<br>
construction of the bottle carriers are best shown in Figures 12A-12C. Each bottle carrier is<br>
provided with a base cup 77 having a shallow support surface 77A surrounded by a<br>
protruding beveled edge to receive and center the base section of the bottle. A mouthpiece<br>
78 has a shallow support surface 78 A surrounded by a protruding beveled edge to receive<br>
and center the mouth of a bottle. Mouthpiece 78 is rotatably supported by neck chuck 79<br>
having diverging support legs 79A and 79B. Leg 79A is selectively positionable along an<br>
actuator shaft SO having teeth 81 for engaging a releasable latch to allow clamped<br>
positioning of the mouthpiece 78 relative to the base cup 77 at any of diverse sites to<br>
accommodate a particular height of a bottle between the base cup and mouthpiece. The<br>
actuator shaft 80 is slidably supported by spaced apart linear bearings 82 and 83 mounted on<br>
an elongated carrier plate 84. An actuator cam follower 80A is rotatably supported by an<br>
end portion of shaft 80 which protrudes from the bearing adjacent the base cup 77 for<br>
contact with cam surfaces 85 and 86 of actuator cams (Figure 2) mounted on the base of the<br>
decorating machine at the entry and deliver ends thereof respectively. The cam surface 85<br>
increases the distance separating the base cup 77 and the neck chuck 79 to allow loading of<br>
a bottle between the cup and chuck and similarly at the bottle unloading site the cam surface<br>
86 again increases the distance separating the base cup and the neck chuck to allow removal<br>
of the bottle from the carrier. The neck chuck 79 is provided with a linear bearing S~<br>
resiliency supported by a support shaft 88.<br>
As shown in Figures 12A-12C extending from the base cup 77 is a journal 89<br>
which is rotatably supported by a bearing in an upstanding housing 90. An end part of the<br>
journal 89 is bolted to a crank arm 91 extending perpendicular to the rotational axis of<br>
journal 89. The free end of arm 91 supports a drive roller 92 for rotating the base cup and a<br>
bottle at each of the decorating stations PI, P2 and P3. Laterally outwardly from the cam<br>
followers 74 and 75 there are mounting blocks 94A and 94B secured to the bottom surface<br>
of the carrier plate 84. The mounting blocks 94A and 94B support rotatable follower rollers<br>
95A and 95B, respectively, which pass into engagement with horizontally aligned cavities<br>
52A and 53A distributed about the outer peripheral edges of the supply disks 52 and 53<br>
when cam followers 74 and 75 exit cam tracks 70A and 72A of the barrel cams 70 and 72.<br>
Similarly, the follower rollers 95A and 95B, respectively, which pass into engagement with<br>
horizontally aligned cavities 54A and 55A distributed about the outer peripheral edges of<br>
carrier return disks 54 and 55 when cam followers exit cam tracks 66 A and 68 A of the<br>
barrel cams 66 and 68.<br>
The bottle carriers are each sequentially transferred from an established<br>
positive driving relation with barrel cams 66 and 68 into a positive driving relation with<br>
carrier disks 54 and 55 and transferred by carrier disks 54 and 55 into a positive driving<br>
relation with barrel cams 70 and 72 and thence from barrel cams 70 and 72 to a positive<br>
driving relation with carrier disks 52 and 53 and completing a conveyance cycle transfer<br>
from carrier disks 52 and 53 into a positive driving relation with barrel cams 66 and 68.<br>
The cams to disks transfer are always the same and the transfer from disks to cams is always<br>
the same. The sequence of events for the transfer from disks to cams is the reversal of the<br>
sequence of events for the transfer from cams to disks. The bottle carrier transfer for one<br>
end of the bottle carrier is schematically shown in Figures 11A-1 ID for the disk 53 to barrel<br>
cam 68 via cam followers 95B and 75, and it is to be understood that the same relationship<br>
between disks 52, cam 66 and cam followers 74 and 95 A at the end of the bottle carrier<br>
adjacent to the decorating machine.<br>
In Figure 11 A, the cam follower 95B is seated in cavity 53A of disk 53 and<br>
cam follower 75 resides at the entrance of cam track 68A in barrel cam 68. As shown in<br>
Figure 1 IB, as disk 53 rotates counter clockwise, follower 95B is carried in cavity 53A to a<br>
12 o'clock position of disk 53 and the barrel cam 75 rotates in the direction indicated by an<br>
associated arrow bringing the cam track 68A into a position so that the site for entrance to<br>
cam track 68A is positioned for entry of follower 75. As shown in Figure 11C, continued<br>
rotation of the disk 53 and barrel cam 68 drives the cam follower 75 into and along cam<br>
track 68A of the cam 68 by continued advancing movement of follower 95B in cavity 53 A<br>
while at the same time the cavity 53 A of disk 53 recedes from the cam follower 95B. The<br>
bottle carrier transfer is completed, as shown in Figure 1 ID, when the disk wall defining<br>
cavity 53 A of disk 53 passes out of contact with cam follower 95B and at the same time<br>
cam follower 75 advances along cam track 68A of barrel cam 68 as shown.<br>
As shown in Figures 9,10,12B and 12C, a cluster of three spaced apart<br>
inboard guide rollers 96A, 96B and 96C are rotatably supported by the carrier plate S4 at its<br>
end most closely adjacent the decorating machine and a cluster of three spaced apart outer<br>
guide rollers 97A, 97B and 97C are rotatably supported by the carrier plate S4 at its end<br>
remote to the decorating machine. As best shown in Figures 9 and 10, secured to arms 40<br>
extending from the decorating machine is an endless track plate 98 having a cavity wherein<br>
inboard guide rollers 96A and 96C engage opposed horizontal track surfaces 98A and 98B<br>
of the cavity. Guide roller 96B engages a vertical face surface 9SC of the guide track.<br>
Secured to each of the arms 40 and plate 41 is an endless track plate 99 having a cavity<br>
wherein outer guide rollers 97A and 97C engage opposed horizontal track surfaces 99A and<br>
99B of the cavity. Guide roller 97B engages a vertical face surface 99C of the guide track.<br>
The guidance provided by the cooperation between the guide rollers 96A, 96C, 97A and<br>
97C which rotate about horizontal axes and the horizontal guide surfaces 98A, 9SB, 99A<br>
and 99B provide load-bearing support for the carrier; maintain cam followers 74 and 75<br>
engaged with the cam tracks of cam 66, 68,70 and 72 and maintain the carrier in a stable<br>
orientation during movement along the cam track. Guide rollers 96B and 97B which rotate<br>
about vertical axes prevent unwanted displacement of the carrier between the guide tracks<br>
98 and 99 in a longitudinal axis of a bottle when supported by the carrier.<br>
At each decorating station PI, P2 and P3 the arrangement of apparatus is<br>
identical and station P3 is selected for the following description of the construction and<br>
operation. As shown in Figures 3, 4 and 8, the gear drive 29 connected to rotate the cam 32<br>
so that cam track 32A moves a cam follower 32D which is mounted to a lever arm 100<br>
which is in turn secured to the lower end of a vertical shaft 101. The shaft 101 is supported<br>
by spaced apart bearings, as shown in Figure 8, which are in turn carried by a tubular<br>
column 102 supported by the base of the decorator machine 10. At the top of the column<br>
102 there are superimposed oscillation arm assemblies 103 and 104. Assembly 103 is made<br>
up of a lever arm 105 secured to shaft 101 and provided with a guideway 106 extending<br>
radially of the shaft. In the guideway there is arranged a drive bar 107 which can be moved<br>
along the guideway by the threaded portion of a hand wheel 108. The distance the drive bar<br>
107 is located radially of the rotational axis of shaft 101 is controlled by the hand wheel<br>
108. A drive block 109 is mounted on a portion of the drive bar 107 projecting vertically<br>
above the guideway and reciprocates in an inverted "U" shaped slot formed in a drive bar<br>
110. The drive bar is joined to a slide 111 supported in a guideway 112. The slide is held<br>
in a slot of guideway 112 by gib plates 113. While not shown, the slide 111 protrudes<br>
laterally from opposite sides of the tubular column 102 and is provided with outwardly<br>
spaced apart receiver arms 114 and 115. The receiver arm 114 engages a decorating screen<br>
assembly 116 that is reciprocated by the linear motion of the slide 111 to thereby reciprocate<br>
the decorating screen assembly along the body portion Bl of a bottle for cam-ing out<br>
decorating operations thereon. Assembly 104 includes a lever arm 119 secured to shaft 101<br>
and provided with a guideway 120 extending radially of the shaft. In the guideway there is<br>
arranged a drive bar 121 which can be moved along the guideway by the threaded portion of<br>
a feed screw operated by a hand wheel 122. The distance the drive bar 121 is located<br>
radially of the rotational axis of shaft 101 is controlled by the hand wheel 122. A drive<br>
block 123 is mounted on a portion of the drive bar 121 projecting vertically downwardly<br>
from the guideway and reciprocates in a "U" shaped slot formed in a drive bar 124. The<br>
drive bar is joined to a slide 125 supported in a guideway 112. The slide 125 is held in a<br>
slot of guideway 112 by gib plates 126. The slide 125 protrudes laterally from opposite<br>
sides of the tubular column 102, in the same manner as slide 113 protrudes. Similarly, the<br>
receiver arm 115 engages a decorating screen assembly 1 IS that is reciprocated by the linear<br>
motion of the slide 125 to thereby reciprocate the decorating screen assembly along the neck<br>
portion Nl of a bottle for carrying out decorating operations thereon.<br>
Hand wheels 108 and 122 are used to select a desired stroke for the screen<br>
reciprocation to match the circumferential distance of the bottle which is to be decorated.<br>
This matching relationship is critically significant because no relative motion between the<br>
screen movement and the bottle rotation can be accepted otherwise, smearing or poor<br>
quality decorating will occur. As shown in Figure 8, squeegees 129 and 130 are carried by a<br>
support arm 131 in positions above the screens 116 and 118, respectively. Each squeegee<br>
includes a squeegee rubber 132 on the end portion of a squeegee positioning cylinder<br>
operated pneumatically against the force of a return spring thereby to establish line contact<br>
between the screen assembly 116 and 118 and a bottle as the bottle is rotated in a<br>
synchronous speed with linear movement of the screens. The squeegees are adjustably<br>
located by fasteners engaged in a mounting slot 133 extending along the elongated length of<br>
the support arm 131.<br>
At each decorating station there is provided as part of the screen drives, a<br>
drive to rotate a rotator assembly 136. As shown in Figure 8, the rotator assembly includes<br>
a drive gear 143 which is located beneath lower arm 105 where the teeth of gear 143 mesh<br>
with teeth of an elongated rack 137. Rack 137 is secured to a slide 138 arranged in a<br>
slideway supported by a pedestal 142. The slide 138 is constrained in a slideway by gibs<br>
139 to reciprocate in response to a driving force imparted to a "U" shaped drive bar 140.<br>
The driving force is imparted by a drive block 141 mounted in a slot formed in the<br>
underside of lower arm 105. Drive block 141 serves to convert oscillating motion of lower<br>
arm 105 to linear motion of the slide thereby reciprocating the rack 137. The teeth of the<br>
rack 137 mesh with gear teeth of a drive gear 143 mounted on an end portion of an arbor<br>
144 which is rotatably supported by a bearing 145 mounted in a bearing housing secured to<br>
a face plate 146 mounted on the base 11. A rotator drive head 147 is secured to the end<br>
portion of the arbor 144 and formed with a slot opening 148 extending transversely to the<br>
longitudinal axis about which the arbor 144 rotates. The slot opening receives the drive<br>
roller 92 on a bottle carrier 76 as the carrier approaches a dwell position "D" in the course<br>
of travel along the decorating machine. When the drive roller 92 is received in the opening<br>
148, a driving relationship is established whereby rotation of the rotator head 147 rotates the<br>
drive roller 92 and the crank arm 91 for rotating the bottle 360Â° at the bottle decorating<br>
station.<br>
As shown in Figure 10, at each decorating station where a workpiece carrier<br>
is brought to a dwell period "D" interrupting its course of traveling motion there is an<br>
elongated riser section 150 representing an elevation increase to guide surfaces 98A and<br>
98B of the guide 98. At the outboard side of the workpiece conveyor there is at each<br>
decorating station an elongated riser section, not shown, horizontally aligned with an<br>
identical elongated riser section 150 of guide 98 and representing an elevation increase to<br>
guide surfaces 99A and 99B of the guide 99 whereby each workpiece carrier arriving at a<br>
decorating station is acted upon simultaneously by a riser section at each of the opposite<br>
ends of the workpiece carrier. The riser sections elevate the bottle carrier and thus the bottle<br>
supported thereby a short distance so that the decorating screens can freely reciprocate in<br>
either direction without impingement contact with adjacent bottles.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the present invention features a continuous<br>
motion of the bottles throughout conveyance by supply conveyor 24A; a bottle transfer 150;<br>
and the bottle carrier 76. In Figures 1, 2 and 4 the bottles are arranged in a spaced relation<br>
on the supply conveyor 24A with their axes A vertically orientated and changed to<br>
horizontal orientation by operation of a bottle transfer 150 forming part of the bottle loading<br>
equipment L. The bottle transfer 150 acquires support of each bottle with its axis A in a<br>
vertical orientation on supply conveyor 24A; reorientates the bottle in a manner so that its<br>
axis A is in a horizontal orientation; and when the axis A is horizontal or substantially<br>
horizontal release or otherwise allow engagement and support for the bottle between a base<br>
cup 77 and a neck chuck 79 of a bottle carrier 76 while passing through a loading station<br>
151. The bottle carrier remains in the driving relation between followers 95A and 95B<br>
interfitting and drivenly engaged in aligned cavities 52A and 53 A, respectively, of supply<br>
disks 52 and 53 to the registration station, not shown. An example of bottle registration is<br>
to provide a dwell position for a workpiece along the conveyor 12 where before the first<br>
decorating station PI the bottle is rotated about its longitudinal axis A by a rotator head<br>
constructed in the same manner as rotator 147 and stopped from rotation when a registration<br>
finger engaged in the registration cavity formed in the lower base portion of the bottle.<br>
When rotation of the bottle is stopped there is established a predetermined bottle<br>
orientation with respect to the decorating screens.<br>
The predetermined bottle orientation establishes a predetermined registration<br>
of the workpiece with respect to the decorating screens at each of the spaced apart<br>
decorating stations. The registration process is particularly useful to orient seam lines<br>
extending along opposite sides of a bottle with respect to the location of the desired area for<br>
decoration. As shown in Figures 7 and 8, registration of the bottle is concluded with the<br>
orientation of the crank arm 91 such that the drive roller 92 trails the advancing movement<br>
of the bottle carrier to the decorating stations. As the drive roller 92 emerges from a slot in<br>
the rotator drive at the indexing station, the drive roller 92 is captured and guided by spaced<br>
apart guide rails 152 and 153. These guide rails extend along an endless path of travel by<br>
the drive roller 92 throughout the endless circulating movement of the workpiece carriers to<br>
thereby control the orientation of the crank arm and maintain registration of the bottle at<br>
each decorating station. At each of the decorating stations PI, P2 and P3 the continuity of<br>
the guide rails 152 and 153 are interrupted by a gap wherein a drive rotator 147 member is<br>
located to receive and rotate a bottle. Downstream of each gap in the guide rails 152 and<br>
153 are outwardly protruding collector rail portions 152A and 153A that return the roller<br>
and crank arm to the gap between guide rails as the barrel cams 66 and 68 operate<br>
advancing the bottles after completion of the decorating to an unloading station 154.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment of present invention, the unloading station 154<br>
includes a bottle transfer 155 to acquire support of a bottle with its axis A in a horizontal<br>
orientation and located between the base cup 77 and the neck chuck 79 of a bottle carrier 76<br>
while passing through the unloading station 154 by operation of the carrier disks 54 and 55.<br>
The bottle transfer 155 operates with continuous motion to reorientate the bottle in a manner<br>
so that its axis A is in a vertical orientation and when the axis A is vertical release the bottle<br>
to allow conveyance by the delivery conveyor 24B.<br>
The bottle transfers 150 and 155, embodying the same construction of parts,<br>
are located at the opposite ends of the workpiece conveyor 12 for loading undecorated<br>
bottles on the bottle carriers 76 and unloading of decorated bottles from bottle carriers of the<br>
decorating machine. The following description of the construction of bottle transfer 150 is<br>
equally applicable to the bottle transfer 155 except as otherwise noted. As illustrated in<br>
Figures 13, 15 and 16, the bottle transfer 150 includes a rectangular shaped pedestal 160<br>
having a top wall 161 with one side wall 162 joined with two end walls 163 and 164. The<br>
side wall 162 is secured by bolts 162A to the base 11 at an angular orientation for rotational<br>
operation of the bottle transfer about an angularly orientated rotational axis 165 which as<br>
shown schematically by Figure 14 forms an acute angle oc with a horizontal plane 166<br>
containing the axis A of a bottle when orientated for support by a bottle carrier 76 of the<br>
decorator conveyor 12 and forms an acute angle |3 with a vertical plane 167 containing the<br>
axis A of a bottle when orientated for support by either supply conveyor 24A or delivery<br>
conveyor 24B. The angular orientation of the rotational axis 165 is an important feature of<br>
the present invention that automatically brings about a change to the orientation of the axis<br>
A of a bottle from the vertical plane 167 to the horizontal plane 166 or when desired from<br>
the horizontal plane 166 to the vertical plane 167. The acute angles a and P are preferably<br>
each 45Â° which offers the advantage of allowing the feed and delivery conveyors 24A and<br>
24B to extend perpendicularly to the direction of bottle movement in the decorating<br>
machine and at opposite lateral sides of the decorating machine.<br>
The angular orientation of rotational axis 165 is established by using the top<br>
surface of top wall 161 to support a barrel cam 168 which is secured by a mounting flange<br>
169 to the top wall 161 by the use of bolts 170. The barrel cam 168 has a closed cam track<br>
172 and a hollow interior wherein bearings 173 and 174 are earned in spaced apart recesses<br>
and rotatably support a drive shaft 175 between a collar 176 and a threaded lock nut 177.<br>
The bearings 173 and 174 support the drive shaft 175 to rotate about an axis 165 in response<br>
to torque applied to the drive shaft through an overload clutch 178 connected to a drive<br>
output shaft of the cone worm drive 22E. The cone worm drive is supported by mounting<br>
bolts on the bottom surface of the top wall 161. As shown in Figure 16, the drive shaft 175<br>
includes a splined portion 180 projecting upwardly beyond collar 176 to which there is<br>
mounted a control rod carrier 181 having upper and lower flanges 182 and 183, respectively.<br>
A drive hub 184 is secured by a washer and bolt assemblies 185 to the drive shaft 175 and<br>
to the upper flange 182 of control rod carrier 181. The drive hub supports six, angularly<br>
spaced apart, bottle grippers 186A-186F (Figure 17). It is preferred to utilize six grippers or<br>
more in pairs of grippers to reduce the rotational speed of the grippers about axis 165<br>
between the bottle supply conveyor 24A and the workpiece conveyor 12 of the decorating<br>
machine and\or the workpiece conveyor 12 and the bottle delivery conveyor 24B. Six<br>
grippers are particularly suitable for inclusion in each of the bottle loading and unloading<br>
equipment L and U where the decorating machine operates at a bottle throughput rate of<br>
200 bottles per minute or more. The grippers 186A-186F are identically constructed and<br>
supported by angularly spaced apart upstanding clevis 184A forming part of the drive hub<br>
184. Each clevis is secured by a pivot shaft 184B to one of carrier arms 187 for pivotal<br>
movement in discrete planes that are parallel and intersect axis 165.<br>
Bottle gripper 186A has been identified in Figures 18-21 for the purpose of<br>
describing the construction of each of the bottle grippers 186A-1S6F. The carrier arm 187<br>
is elongated with a rectangular cross section containing a slot 188 elongated to extend in the<br>
direction of the extended length of the arm. Beyond the terminal projected end of the slot,<br>
the end of the arm 187 is secured by a mounting-fixture 189 to a rectangular carriage 190 to<br>
project in opposite directions at an angle of 45Â° to the plane containing pivotal movement of<br>
the carrier arm 187 whereby the bottle gripper is vertically oriented at the supply conveyor<br>
24A and horizontally orientated at the workpiecc conveyor 12 while angularly rotated about<br>
axis 165. The carriage 190 is constructed with a tubular carrier section 191 extending along<br>
one lateral side opposite a bifurcated tubular carrying section 192 for supporting elongated<br>
gripper support rods 193 and 194, respectively. The gripper support rods 193 and 194<br>
extend in a parallel and spaced apart relation with each other and with axis A of a bottle<br>
when supported by the bottle gripper. Moreover the axis A of a bottle when supported by<br>
the bottle gripper always forms an angle of 45Â° to the plane containing pivotal movement of<br>
the carrier arm 187. The gripper support rod 193 is rigidly secured by setscrews 195 to the<br>
carrier section 191. On the lower terminal end portion of rod 193, there is mounted a C-<br>
shaped carrier arm 196 to which is mounted a wear-resistant insert 197 having angular<br>
surfaces 197A, 197B and 197C for engaging a hemispherical portion of the base of a bottle.<br>
The upper end of the rod 193, which is opposite the location of carrier arm 196, is secured<br>
to a carrier arm 198 provided with a wear resistant insert 199 having a V-shaped surface<br>
199A to engage and support the neck portion of a bottle.<br>
At the opposite side of the carriage 190. the rod 194 is pivotally supported by<br>
spaced apart bearings seated in the bifurcated parts of carrier section 192. On the lower<br>
terminal end portion of rod 194 there is rigidly mounted a pivotal carrier arm 205 provided<br>
with a wear-resistant insert 206 in an opposing relation to the C-shaped carrier arm 196.<br>
The pivotal carrier arm 205 and wear-resistant insert 206 are pivotally displaced about a<br>
rotational axis extending centrally along the length of rod 194 in response to displacement<br>
by a cam follower 207 carried by a crank arm 208 secured to a lower terminal end portion of<br>
rod 194 beneath pivotal carrier arm 205. An upper terminal end portion of rod 194<br>
protruding from carrier section 192 is rigidly secured by a link arm 209 to the lower end of a<br>
control rod 210 which extends parallel with the extended length of rod 194 at one lateral<br>
side defined by the length of link arm 209. The pivotal carrier arm 205 and link arm 209<br>
also serve as retainer members to maintain the rod 194 pivotally engaged by the carrier<br>
section 192. The link arm 209 forms part of a geometric link for imparting pivotal<br>
movement by rod 194 to a generally planar support face 211 of a wear-resistant insert 212<br>
on pivotal carrier arm 213 to engage and form a supporting relation for a neck portion of a<br>
bottle with the V-shaped surfaces 199A of support arm 198. The pivotal movement of<br>
pivotal carrier arms 205 and 213 are biased in a direction for maintaining supporting<br>
engagement with a bottle the force for this bias is provided by using the attachment block<br>
200 as a mounting structure for a control rod 201 having a threaded end portion extending<br>
through an aperture in a support lug 202 on carriage 190. The threaded end portion of rod<br>
201 is engaged with a lock nut 203 which is adjustably positioned along the threaded end<br>
portion to apply a compressive force of a helical spring 204 surrounding the control rod 201<br>
as the biasing force to pivotal carrier arms 205 and 213 when engaged with the bottle.<br>
Referring again to Figures 15 and 16, the slot 1S8 in each of the carrier arms<br>
187 of the grippers 186A-186F receives a slide bar 214 connected by a pivot to a clevis 215<br>
on an upper end of an actuating rod 216 which is slidably supported by linear bearings 217<br>
and 218 carried by each of the upper flange 182 and lower flange 183 respectively of the<br>
central rod carrier 181. The lower end of the actuating rod 216 is secured to a cam follower<br>
219 residing in the closed cam track 172 of barrel cam 168. The course of travel by the cam<br>
follower 219 along the cam track 172 produces a literal reciprocating motion by the<br>
actuating rod 216 in a timed relation with rotation of the bottle gripper about the rotational<br>
axis 165. A control arm 220 is secured to the actuating rod 216 immediately above the site<br>
of cam follower 219 and carries a linear bearing 221 to guide the control arm 220 to<br>
reciprocate along a guide rod 222 supported by and extending downwardly from lower<br>
flange 183 and thereby prevent unwanted rotational movement of the actuating rod 216<br>
about its axis extending in the direction of its extended length.<br>
Figure 22 diagrammatically illustrates the reciprocal movement of a gripper<br>
support arm 187 of gripper 186A which is the same as each cam follower 219 of the gripper<br>
support arms 187 proceeds along the same cam trackl72 of the barrel cam 168. A<br>
BOTTLE RECEIVING position is identified by a 0odesignati6n point on the barrel cam<br>
track 172 and established in the transfer cycle by the relation of the gripper support arm 187<br>
extending at a horizontal position and midway between extreme upward and downward<br>
positions. In the BOTTLE RECEIVING position, the arm 187 extends in a horizontal<br>
plane that is perpendicular to the axis A of a bottle while supported on the supply conveyor<br>
24A. The pivotal carrier arms 205 and 213 assume supporting engagement with a bottle<br>
when the cam follower 207 ceases contact with an arcuate cam surface 225 of a C-shaped<br>
cam 226 as shown in Figure 26. The cam 226 is mounted on a shelf 227 extending<br>
horizontally at one lateral side of the conveyor 24A in the direction toward the bottle<br>
transfer 150. Immediately prior to the supporting engagement between the bottle and<br>
pivotal carrier arms 205 and 213, as shown in Figure 25, the follower 207 advances along<br>
cam surface 225 which operates to maintain pivotal carrier arms 205 and 213 pivotally<br>
displaced outwardly in a direction away from the V-shaped surface 199A and the angular<br>
surfaces 197A, 197B and 197C, respectively. The delivery of a bottle to the site where<br>
supporting engagement is established with one of the bottle grippers 186A-186F is in a<br>
timed relation between advancing movement of a bottle by the conveyor 24A and the<br>
movement of a gripper to a vertical orientation by passing through a zone where a bottle is<br>
engaged and supported by the gripper. When alternative forms of supply and deliver}'<br>
conveyors extend along a lateral side or above the conveyance paths for the bottles such as<br>
described hereinbefore, the reciprocating motion imparted to the bottle grippers 186A-186F<br>
of the carrier arms 187 will facilitate the receiving and delivery of bottles with such<br>
alternative forms of supply and delivery conveyors.<br>
As shown in Figure 23, the bottles are advanced along a horizontal guide rail<br>
228 by the conveyor 24A initially with the bottles in an abutting relation until engagement is<br>
established with the timing screw 25 whereupon the helical groove 25A having an ever<br>
increasing pitch in the direction of advancing movement by the conveyor establishes a<br>
correspondingly ever increasing space between the bottles. The pivotal carrier arm 213 and<br>
C-shaped carrier arm 196 are shown in Figures 23-26, in their generally horizontal path of<br>
travel at the end portion of the timing screw, hi Figure 24, there is illustrated the carrier arm<br>
196 advanced above the conveyor beyond the bottle undergoing restrained advancing<br>
movement by the timing screw and held captive by the timing screw and the guide rail 228.<br>
The pivotal carrier arm 213 resides at a lateral side of the conveyor while the cam follower<br>
207 which is coupled by the pivot arm 208 to gripper support rod 194 approaches cam<br>
surface 225 of the C-shaped cam 226. In Figure 25 the timing screw allows continued<br>
advancing movement of the bottle while the carrier arm 196 moves toward a central position<br>
along the conveyor 24A ahead of the bottle and the pivotal carrier arm 213 undergoes<br>
pivotal movement by engagement by the cam follower 207 with cam surface 225. Pivotal<br>
carrier arm 213 now trails the bottle at a location above the conveyor. In Figure 25, the<br>
carrier arm 196 advances along the conveyor with pivotal motion that operates to orient<br>
angular surfaces 197A, 197B and 197C into a proximal confronting relation with the<br>
advancing bottle while still restrained by the timing screw. The relative movement between<br>
the carrier ami 196 and the bottle continues the advancing movement of the bottle toward<br>
the carrier arm as the follower 207 nears the trailing end portion of the cam surface 225<br>
which serves to initiate pivotal movement of the pivotal carrier arm 213 toward the side of<br>
the hnttlp. wnprnllv rvnnnsitp. the. ciHp. nf thp r.nrripr arm 1 Qfi Ac thp mm fnllnwp.r 7.07<br>
moves out of contact with cam surface 225, pivotal carrier arm 213 pivots into contact with<br>
the bottle. Figure 26 illustrates the moment of release of a bottle from the timing screw and<br>
the simultaneous establishment of supporting engagement between carrier arm 196 and<br>
pivotal carrier arm 213 which is the BOTTLE RECEIVING position identified as a 0Â°<br>
designation point on the barrel cam track 172 forming part of the transfer cycle in Figure 22.<br>
As shown in Figure 1 there is a segment of travel by a bottle gripper across a<br>
substantially vertical orientation zone 230 characterized by advancing movement of the<br>
bottle gripper in a substantially vertical orientation before and after the moment the bottle<br>
gripper engages the bottle with the avis A vertically orientated. As shown in Figure 22 the<br>
CONVEYOR CLEARING segment of travel is pert zf a zone 230 where the axis A of a<br>
bottle remains substantially vertical and is produced as the cam foiiov.ci ii&gt; of a bottle<br>
gripper travels of along cam track 172 from 0Â°to 45Â° which maintains the gripper in a<br>
substantially vertical orientation and with advancing substantially horizontal movement<br>
across the terminal end portion of the conveyor 24A. Another part of the zone 230 is an<br>
APPROACH CONVEYOR segment occurring along can track 172 at about 45Â° prior to 0Â°<br>
by the bottle gripper movements causing a substantially vertical orientation of the bottle<br>
gripper before the moment when a bottle is engaged by the bottle gripper. The<br>
APPROACH CONVEYOR segment and the CONVEYOR CLEARING segment form the<br>
entire substantially vertical orientation zone 230. This course of travel by the bottle gripper<br>
is the result of rotary movement of the gripper about axis 165 and a pivotal displacement of<br>
the gripper by rod 216 in a vertically upward direction by the follower 219 movement along<br>
cam track 172. The bottle gripper enters the CONVEYOR ENTRY segment in a<br>
substantially vertical orientation due to the same rotary movement combined with the<br>
vertically downward movement produced by pivotal displacement of the gripper by rod 216<br>
in a vertically downward direction by the follower 219 along cam track 172.<br>
From 45Â° through 90Â° to 135Â° the bottle gripper is pivoted downwardly and<br>
then from 135Â° through 180Â° to 225Â° a bottle on the gripper is pivoted upwardly. These<br>
upward and downward pivotal motions of the gripper occur simultaneously with the rotary<br>
motion of the gripper about axis 165. The combined effect is a reorientation of the gripper<br>
whereby the axis A of a bottle supported by the gripper is changed from generally vertical<br>
orientation to a generally horizontal orientation. The reorientation is beneficially enhanced<br>
by the action produced by cam track 172 by providing that the bottle carrier moves across<br>
the bottle supply conveyor 24A with a continuous motion characterized by substantially<br>
matched speed and direction. This feature of the present invention enables the transfer of<br>
support for a bottle from the supply conveyor to the bottle gripper while the bottle remains<br>
in a stable orientation without a significant change to the take off speed by the bottle from<br>
â¢the conveyor. In a similar fashion, the combined continuous motions of the bottle carrier<br>
approaching the 180Â°point along the cam track produce an approach by the bottle toward a<br>
bottle carrier 76 in a substantially horizontal orientation zone indicated by reference<br>
numeral 231 in,Figure 2. In the horizontal path the movement by bottle carrier slows to a<br>
stable horizontal orientation without a significant speed difference with the bottle carrier<br>
speed. At 180Â° the bottle is handed off for support by the decorator conveyor. The pivotal<br>
positioning of the gripper by operation of cam track 172 from 225Â° through 270Â° to 315Â°<br>
reorientates the bottle gripper for approach to the supply conveyor 24A along a substantially<br>
horizontal path of travel as indicated by reference numeral 231 in Figure 2.<br>
Concurrently with the passage of the bottle along the substantially horizontal<br>
path of travel 231. there is an increase to preset separation distance between the base cup 77<br>
and mouthpiece 78 of a bottle carrier 76 by displacement of the actuator shaft 80 (Figures<br>
12A and 12B) in response to contact between the actuator cam follower 80A and cam 85 as<br>
previously described as shown in Figures 2 and 7. As the mouthpiece 78 moves to clamp<br>
the bottle between the mouthpiece and the base cup in response to passage of the follower<br>
80A beyond cam 85, the pivotal carrier arms 205 and 213 are displaced from supporting<br>
engagement with a bottle by contact of the cam follower 207 with an arcuate cam surface<br>
235 of a C-shaped cam 236 as shown in Figures 27 and 2S. The cam 236 is secured by a<br>
bracket to the base 11 of the decorating machine to strategically reside in the pathway of<br>
cam follower 207. As seen in Figure 28 the cam surface 235 is engaged by the cam follower<br>
207 when or at least immediately after the bottle is engaged and supported between the<br>
base cup 77 and mouthpiece 78 of a bottle carrier 76. The transfer of support occurs when<br>
the axis A of the bottle is horizontal and residing in horizontal plane 166 and thus<br>
completing the change to the reorientation of the bottle as shown in Figure 14 from the<br>
vertical where the axis A is coextensive the vertical plane 167 to the horizontal where the<br>
axis A is coextensive with the horizontal plane 166. As the bottle is transported by the<br>
carrier 76, the pivotal carrier arms 205 and 213, as shown in Figure 28 are maintained<br>
pivotally displaced outwardly in a direction away from their respective V-shaped surface<br>
199A and angular surfaces 197A, 197B and 197C and thereby avoid interference with the<br>
moving carrier 76 and bottle supported thereby. The bottle transfer 155 at the bottle<br>
unloading equipment U utilizes the cam 236 with cam surface 235 oriented in the manner of<br>
an opposite hand arrangement to that as shown and described in regard to Figures 27 and 28.<br>
The opposite hand arrangement is characterized by positioning of the cam 236 along the<br>
path of travel by a bottle carrier at a site in advance of the bottle unloading station 154<br>
which is to be compared with the positioning of cam 236 along the path of travel by a bottle<br>
carrier at a site after passage from the bottle loading station 151. At station 151 cam 236<br>
functions to pivotally displace the pivotal carrier arms 205 and 213 in a direction away from<br>
grippers 196 and 198 before the bottle carrier arrives at the unloading station and thereby<br>
allow the grippers to pass along opposite sides of a bottle while supported by a bottle carrier<br>
76 approaching the bottle unloading station 154. Cam 86 operates to release the bottle at<br>
the unloading station at substantially the same time as cam follower 207 passes beyond cam<br>
surface 236 causing the pivotal carrier arms 205 and 213 to assume a supporting<br>
engagement with the bottle. The cam 226 supported by the shelf 227 along the side of<br>
delivery conveyor 24B operates to move the pivotal carrier arms 205 and 213 hi a direction<br>
to release a bottle from support by the bottle transfer and conveyance by conveyor 24B. The<br>
release of the bottle from a bottle carrier for conveyance by delivery conveyor 24B occurs<br>
by arranging cam 226 along the side of the conveyor at a position so that the follower 207<br>
engages cam surface 225 when the central axis A of a bottle is centrally disposed with<br>
respect to the width of the conveyor whereupon pivoting of the pivot carrier arm 205 and<br>
213 allow the conveyor to advance the bottle away from gripper 196 while at the same time<br>
pivotal carrier arm 205 pivots away from the bottle.<br>
The bottle transfers 150 and 155 of the present invention are also useful for<br>
supplying and transferring of bottles to a workpiece conveyor of a decorating machine while<br>
the bottle transfer sites are stationary in a dwell period of intermittent advancing motion.<br>
Figures 29 and 30 illustrate a modification to the drive system for providing intermittent<br>
rotational movements to each of the carrier supply disks 52 and 53 and the carrier return<br>
disks 54 and 55. The description accompanying the use of reference numerals appearing in<br>
Figures 5 and 6 is equally applicable but not reproduced here in regard to the like numerals<br>
appearing in Figures 29 and 30. The pulley 37 is driven by a belt and mounted on a third<br>
line shaft 38A which is rotatably supported by bearings 44. Outwardly beyond the bearings<br>
44, each end of the third line shaft 38A is joined by couplings 250 and 251 to index drive<br>
units 252 and 253, respectively. The index drive units have drive output shafts directly<br>
coupled to drive shafts 50 and 51, respectively. By this drive arrangement, the third line<br>
shaft delivers continuous rotary motion to belt 57 for continuously rotating the barrel cams<br>
66, 68, 70 and 72 while the carrier supply disks 52 and 53 and the carrier return disks 54<br>
and 55 are intermittently rotated in response to the operation of the index drive units 252<br>
and 253. While not shown in the drawings, it is to be understood that the cone worm drives<br>
22E for the bottle transfer 150 and the cone worm drive 22F for the bottle transfer 155 will<br>
be replaced by index drive units to execute dwell periods in a timed relation with the dwell<br>
periods formed by the index drive units 252 and 253. In this way as a bottle is supported by<br>
a gripper on conveyor 24 A there will be a dwell period while support for a bottle occurs on<br>
a bottle carrier 76 at the loading station 151. Similarly, during the same dwell period<br>
support for a bottle occurs by a bottle gripper at unloading station 154 and a bottle is<br>
released for support by conveyor 24B by a bottle transfer.<br>
Figures 31, 32, and 33 illustrate a further modified form of a workpiece<br>
conveyor for transporting workpieces in the decorating machine 10 by intermittent motion.<br>
The description of the decorating machine and the accompanying use of reference numerals<br>
appearing in the embodiment of Figures 1-8 are equally applicable but not reproduced<br>
herein in regard to the like numerals appearing in Figures 31-33. The workpiece conveyor<br>
12A includes a support shaft 255 at the entry end of the conveyor and a drive shaft 256 at<br>
the delivery end of the conveyor. Support shaft 255 is supported by a spring tensioning<br>
assembly 257 carried by the base 11 to maintain a preselected tension applied by assembly<br>
257 to the sprockets 258,259 and 260 and then to the endless chains 261,262 and 263. .<br>
Drive shaft 256 is drivenly engaged with coaxially aligned and spaced apart drive sprockets<br>
25 8 A, 259 A and 260A to drive the runs of endless chains 261, 262 and 263. Links 264 of<br>
the endless chains are interconnected by one of three lugs 265 protruding from the bottom of<br>
each carrier plate 266 of a plurality of workpiece carriers. Drive sprockets 258A, 259A and<br>
260A are drivenly secured to drive shaft 256 and engage chains 261, 262 and 263 for<br>
driving the chains about an endless path of travel. The drive shaft 256 is rotatably<br>
supported by an outboard bearing support 267 mounted on a sidewall of base 11 and at the<br>
inboard side, the drive shaft 256 is supported by an inboard bearing support 268 mounted on<br>
a part of the base 11. Drive shaft 256 has an extended shaft portion extending beyond the<br>
inboard bearing support 268 to a drive output member 269 of a conveyor index box 270. As<br>
best shown in Figure 33, the drive output member 269 of the index box imparts intermittent<br>
rotation to the shaft 256 which in turn imparts intermittent advancing motion to the<br>
workpiece carrier mounted on the conveyor 12A, thus intermittently advancing bottles along<br>
the decorating machine. The bottles are supported in a horizontal orientation between a<br>
base cup 271 and a mouthpiece 272 provided on each of the plurality of carrier plates 266 of<br>
workpiece carriers. The conveyor index box 270 is driven by a belt 271 connected to the<br>
second line shaft 15 by a pulley mounted on an extended end portion 15B of the shaft 15.<br>
While the present invention has been described in connection with the<br>
preferred embodiments of the various figures, it is to be understood that other similar<br>
embodiments may be used or modifications and additions may be made to the described<br>
embodiment for performing the same function of the present invention without deviating<br>
therefrom. Therefore, the present invention should not be limited to any single<br>
