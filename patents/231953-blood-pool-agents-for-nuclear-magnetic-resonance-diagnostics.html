				<td>BLOOD POOL AGENTS FOR NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE DIAGNOSTICS The present invention relates to the novel use of metal ion complexes of conjugates of bile acids with molecules having chelating activity as contrast agents in the diagnostic technique known as "magnetic resonance imaging" (M.R.I.), in particular as blood pool agents.<br>
Complexes formed of chelating agents and suitable metals are already used as contrast agents in the following diagnostic techniques: X-ray imaging, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (M.R.I.) and scintigraphy.<br>
In particular, medical diagnosis using magnetic resonance imaging (M.R.I.), a recognized powerful diagnostic technique in clinical practice (Stark, D.D., Bradley, W. G., Jr., Eds. "Magnetic Resonance Imaging" The C. V. Mosby Company, St. Louis, Missouri (USA) , 1988) , mainly employs paramagnetic pharmaceutical compositions, preferably containing chelated complexes of bi-trivalent paramagnetic metal ions with polyaminopolycarboxylic ligands and/or their derivatives or analogues.<br>
The images, basically deriving from the NMR signal of water protons, are the result of a complex interaction between different parameters, such as proton density and T1 and T2 relaxation times. A contrast enhancement can be obtained through the administration of exogenous chemical<br>
substances which significantly change the resonance properties of nearby water protons (see Lauffer, R.B. Chem. Rev. 1987, 87, 901).<br>
The paramagnetic contrast agents used for N.M.R imaging act modifying the relaxation times of the water protons present in the tissues in which said contrast agents are concentrated, and they can therefore increase the contrast between different tissues, or between healthy and diseased tissues.<br>
Gadolinium paramagnetic complexes, due to their high capability of reducing relaxation times of the protons of nearby water molecules through dipolar interaction, have been the object of studies, publications and patents.<br>
Some of them are at present in clinical use as M.R.I, contrast agents:<br>
Gd-DTPA, N-methylglucaraine salt of the gadolinium complex with diethylenetriaminopentaacetic acid, MAGNEVIST®; Gd-DOTA, N-methylglucamine salt of the gadolinium complex with 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid, DOTAREM®; Gd-HPD03A, gadolinium complex with [10-(2-hydroxypropyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-l,4,7-triacetic acid, PROHANCE®; Gd-DTPA-BMA, gadolinium complex with diethylene-triaminopentaacetic acid bis (methylamide) , OMNISCAN®.<br>
The contrast agents listed above and commercially available are intended for a general use. In fact, after administration, the M.R.I, said contrast agents diffuse in blood and in the extracellular areas of various parts<br>
of the body before being excreted. They are therefore similar, in this respect, to the iodinated compounds used for X-ray medical diagnosis.<br>
At present, the medical profession is in need of contrast agents that are aimed at specific organs or for imaging of- the blood system, which cannot be well defined by means of the products already commercially available. The first approach to obtain the latter consisted in covalently linking the contrast agent to macromolecules, such as proteins, or in inglobating it inside stable molecular aggregates such as liposomes, or still in using the so-called superparamagnetic particles.<br>
For example, the gadolinium complex with diethylenetriaminopentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) was linked to human albumin (HSA) , polylysine or dextran (Oksendal A. N. et al., J. Magn. Reson. Imaging, 157, 1993; Rocklage S. M., "Contrast Agents, Magn. Res. Imaging, Mosby Year Book, 372-437, 1992) in order to minimize or even suppress the diffusion from blood into the extracellular fluid thus providing a higher retention of the agent in the blood system. Such an approach, although attaining the desired effect, suffers from disagreeable side effects as the agent itself is excreted with difficulty.<br>
A different strategy is the use of superparamagnetic particles coated with polyethylene glycols or hydrocarbons in order to reduce the hepatic uptake by endothelial reticulum or by other systems (Tilcock C.,<br>
Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 77, 1993; Bogdanoy A. A. et al., Radiology, 701,1993), thus prolonging the permanence of said agents in blood. In this case, also the above mentioned side effects occur, as well as problems due to the high production cost.<br>
The demand for an efficient blood pool agent, having low toxicity and reasonably economic costs, is therefore still unmet.<br>
The present invention relates to the novel use as blood pool agents of specifically selected compounds, already previously described by the Applicant in international patent application WO-A-95/32741, resulting from the conjugation of a bile acid with a chelating agent, which are capable of chelating the ions of paramagnetic bi- trivalent metals, as well as to novel compounds, the process for the preparation thereof and the use thereof as blood pool agents.<br>
Said compounds have shown a good hepatobiliary excretion (see Anelli P. L. et al., Acta Radiologica, 38, 125, 1997) which makes them promising contrast agents for visualizing the hepatobiliary system.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that a specific class of said compounds remains in the vascular system for a sufficiently long time so as to be valuable for use as contrast agents for the imaging of the vascular system, particularly of coronaries.<br>
This effect can be clearly evidenced carrying out in vivo tests in animals (such as rabbit, monkey). The<br>
permanence in the vascular system can in fact be immediately visualized when plotting the proton relaxation values (1/T1) of blood samples of the animal, taken at appropriate time intervals after administration of the contrast agent.<br>
As Gd(III) complexes are paramagnetic species, high 1/T1 values are evidence of high concentrations of the contrast agent in blood.<br>
The difference between a conventional extracellular contrast agent and a blood pool agent, is well clarified in the paper by Lauffer et al.; Radiology, 529,1998 in which T1 profiles in blood as a function of time elapsed after the administration of the contrast agent are reported.<br>
In particular, the complexes of the present invention, when administered for example to the rabbit at a dosage compatible with a reasonable safety index, are capable of inducing changes in relaxation rates (measured in 1/T1) in blood higher than 5 s-1 10 minutes after administration, thus being promising for use as contrast agents for the imaging of the vascular system.<br>
It has been found that this type of effect cannot be solely related to the presence of bile acids, but it depends on the chemical structure of said complexes. It seems, in fact, that the chelating unit should be preferably linked to the steroidal skeleton through a bond at the 3,7 or 12 positions of the bile acid.<br>
It has,  in fact,  been proved that any linkage<br>
between the chelating unit and the bile acid involving the carboxylic group at the 24 position would yield complexes having unsatisfactory permanence in the vascular system.<br>

It is therefore an object of the present invention the use as blood pool agents of the complexes of the compounds of general formula (I) with paramagnetic bi-trivalent metal ions selected from the group consisting of<br>

The syntons used are of course suitably protected at those groups which could give rise to parasitic reactions under the conditions used for the formation of the amide bond. After formation of the bond between the two syntons, one or more deprotection steps for restoring the original groups should be contemplated.<br>
Alternatively to this type of processes, the chelating subunit can be introduced by multi-step reactions starting from a bile acid derivative, as in the case of the synthesis of the compound described in Example 3 of the Experimental section, illustrated in the following Scheme 1.<br>

The present invention also relates to a novel process illustrated in the following Scheme 2:<br>
Scheme 2<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
R4	is an amino-protecting group;<br>
R5	is  a  straight  or branched C1<br>
alkyl or aryl,<br>
R2 and R3 are independently a hydrogen atom, straight or branched C1-C20 alkyl, unsubstituted or substituted by aryl groups, or said groups form a C3-C10 cycle;<br>
which process makes use of a transamidation reaction and allows to maintain the stereochemistry at the chiral centre adjacent to the nitrogen atom of the .starting pyrrolidinone and to afford a secondary amide. The combined selection of groups R4 and R5 is important in that the cleavage should take place under diversified conditions. Possible examples of R4 are the carbobenzyloxy (Cbz) group and of R5 are the methyl group or the t-butyl group.<br>
This process is applicable generally in order to obtain glutamic acid y-amides and it is very useful and advantageous for the preparation of the compounds of the invention, in particular glutamic acid y-amides with 3-amino derivatives of residues Y, as defined above. In fact, it allows to obtain the final compound avoiding the use of the expensive condensing agents for the formation of the y-amido bond between glutamic acid and the corresponding amine.<br>
, An example of the application of this entirely novel synthetic procedure is the synthesis of [3ß(s},5ß,12α]-3-<br>
[ [4- [bis [2- [bis (carboxymethyl) -amino] ethyl] amino] -4-carboxy-l-oxobutyl] amino] -12-hydroxycholan-24-oic     acid, whose conventional synthesis is reported in Example 4 of the Experimental section, whereas the alternative one is reported in Example 5 and the complete synthetic scheme is shown in the following Scheme 3. Scheme 3<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Analogously was prepared the cholic acid derivative already described in patent application WO-A-95/32741, [3ß(S) ,5ß,7α,12α] -3- [ [4- [bis [2- [bis (carboxymethyl) amino] -ethyl] amino] -4-carboxy-l-oxobutyl] amino] -7,12-dihydroxy-cholan-24-oic acid.<br>
Metal ions suitable to form complex salts with the chelating agents of general formula (I) are the bivalent<br>
or trivalent ions of the elements selected from the group consisting of: Fe(2+), F<br>
As for the diagnostic use of the novel chelated complexes of the invention, they can be used as contrast agents, particularly for use as blood pool agents in the imaging diagnostic technique by means of magnetic resonance.<br>
The preparation of the complexes is carried out conventionally, according to a process in which the oxide or the suitable salt of the paramagnetic metal, dissolved in water or suspended in a water-alcohol solution, is added to an aqueous or water-alcohol solution of the chelating agent, under stirring and, if necessary, heated mildly or to the boiling temperature, until completion of the reaction. If the complex is insoluble in the reaction solvent, it can be filtered. If it is soluble, it can be recovered by evaporating off the solvent to a residue, for example through spray drying.<br>
In case the resulting complex still contains free acidic groups, it is transformed into a neutral salt by reaction with an organic or inorganic base which forms physiologically compatible cations in solutions.<br>
For the preparation of these neutral salts, a sufficient amount of the base can be added to the complexes containing free acidic groups in aqueous solution or suspension to neutrality. The resulting solution can thus be conveniently evaporated or a<br>
suitable solvent can be added to crystallize the complex salt.<br>
Preferred inorganic cations suitable for salifying the chelated complexes of the invention comprise in particular alkali or alkaline-earth metal ions such as potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, and the mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred is the sodium ion.<br>
• Preferred cations deriving from organic bases suitable for the above mentioned purpose comprise, inter alia, those of primary, secondary and tertiary amines, such as ethanolamine, diethanolamine, morpholine, glucamine, N-methylglucamine, N, N-dimethylglucamine, N-methylglucamine being particularly preferred.<br>
Preferred cations deriving from amino acids comprise, for example, those of taurine, glycine, lysine, arginine or ornithine.<br>
An alternative to this process consists in preparing the injectable formulation without isolating the complex salt. In this case it is mandatory for the final solutions to contain no free metal ions, which are toxic for the body.<br>
This can be checked by titration, for example, with colored indicators such as Xylenol Orange. A final purification step of the complex salt could also be envisaged.<br>
In this type of process the chelating agent, the salt or the metal oxide, and any salifying bases, are reacted in the stoichiometric ratios in water for<br>
injections, then, after completion of the reaction, pyrogens are filtered off and the product is distributed in suitable containers and then thermally sterilised.<br>
The injectable pharmaceutical formulations are typically prepared by dissolving the active ingredient, prepared as described above, and the excipients in water of suitable purity from the pharmacological point of view, so as to provide a pharmaceutical formulation suitable for the enteral or parenteral administration, in concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1.0 molar. The resulting contrast agent is suitably sterilised.<br>
The contrast agents are administered, depending on the diagnostic requirements, at a dose of 0.01 - 0.3 mmol/kg body weight.<br>
In principle, the doses for the parenteral administration range from 0.001 to about 1.0 mmol/kg body weight. The preferred doses for the parenteral administration range from 0.01 to about 0.5 mmol/kg body weight.<br>
The doses for the enteral administration range, in general, from 0.5 to about 10 mmol/kg, preferably from about 1.0 to about 10 mmol/kg body weight.<br>
The novel formulations of the present invention show good tolerability; moreover their water solubility is a further, important feature which makes them particularly suitable for use in nuclear magnetic resonance.<br>
The diagnostic compositions of the present invention are used conventionally. The compositions can be<br>
administered to a patient, typically a hot-blooded animal, both systemically and topically in the organ or in the tissue to be visualized by magnetic resonance.<br>
The analysis protocols and the apparatuses can be found in works such as Stark, D. D., Bradley, W. G., Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Mosby Year Book, St. Louis, Mo, 1992.<br>
The experimental conditions used will be illustrated in detail in the Experimental section.<br>
