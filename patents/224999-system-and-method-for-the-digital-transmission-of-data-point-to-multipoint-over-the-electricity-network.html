				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR THE DIGITAL TRANSMISSION OF DATA,<br>
POINT TO MULTIPOINT OVER THE ELECTRICTY NETWORK<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to the telecommunications sector,<br>
to a system and method for the digital transmission of data, point to multipoint<br>
over the electricity network, and more particularly, it is applicable to bi-directional<br>
communication between a head-end and various users when using the electricity<br>
network as the means of communication so that a variety of services can be<br>
offered through it to the users. The objective of this invention is to establish both<br>
low and high speed communications, so that multiple high quality services can be<br>
offered to the users, comprising for example, video on demand, high-speed<br>
Internet, etc. It may also be used for applications requiring larger latency such as<br>
for example VoIP (voice over IP). Furthermore, the invention may also be used<br>
for narrow band services, such as standard telephone and current<br>
telecommunication services.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The use of the electricity network as a means of transmission is known in<br>
the background art, but due to its poor performance, its use as a data<br>
transmission network has been limited to point-to-point communication at very<br>
low speeds.<br>
This is due, among other reasons, to the fact that, in the electricity<br>
network, the connection and disconnection of apparatus generate voltage peaks<br>
and impedance variations on the line and cause serious loss of signal that varies<br>
in function of frequency and time.<br>
Furthermore, various obstacles impede the establishment of<br>
communication between a head-end and a plurality of users, in particular due to<br>
the many changes in impedance in different frequencies and the emergence<br>
of reflections that cause the received signal to be a<br>
combination of the transmitted signal and a series of<br>
echoes that circulate through the electricity network<br>
with different attenuations and delays for each one of<br>
the users on the received signal.<br>
Furthermore, attenuation, noise, and channel<br>
response, vary dynamically in frequency and time.<br>
All these obstacles have to date limited the use of<br>
the electricity network for full-duplex, high-speed point<br>
to multipoint communication.<br>
On the other hand, other means of communication for<br>
the transmission of data are known in the background art,<br>
such as the use of twisted pair in telephones to<br>
establish point to point or point to multipoint<br>
communication.<br>
In this context we cite US Patent Number 5.673.2 90<br>
wherein a method of transmission point to point is<br>
described that consists of communication via a downstream<br>
channel determined by a link from the head-end to a<br>
plurality of different users, and communication via the<br>
upstream channel determined by a link from the users to<br>
the head-end, whereby the communication is made possible<br>
using a discrete digital multi-tone (DMT) transmission<br>
system and providing the coding of the digital data and<br>
the modulation of the codified data over the discrete<br>
multi-tone signal.<br>
Furthermore, the communication line is supervised to<br>
determine at least one line quality parameter, including<br>
noise levels in each one, and includes a multitude of<br>
sub-channels each one corresponding to an associated sub-<br>
carrier tone. The modulation system is designed to take<br>
various factors into account including detected line<br>
quality parameters, the parameters of sub-channel gains,<br>
and a masking parameter of permissible power when<br>
modulating the discrete multi-tone signal. The modulation<br>
system is also capable of dynamically activating the sub-<br>
carriers used and the quantity of data transmitted in<br>
each sub-carrier during transmission to adapt in real<br>
time to changes in individual sub-carriers.<br>
In applications susceptible to interference, the<br>
associated bandwidths can be simply masked or silenced to<br>
prevent interference in either direction, and therefore,<br>
the signals are transmitted by sub-carriers with<br>
frequencies above or below the most significant noise<br>
levels.<br>
Furthermore, in this document the transmission<br>
occurs in base band and the conjugated real hermitian<br>
transformation of the transmissible information is used<br>
(real Fast Fourier Transform). Due to the characteristics<br>
already described, this transmission method cannot be<br>
applied to transmission over the electricity network.<br>
Furthermore, the method described in the Patent<br>
cited above refers to point to point communication,<br>
therefore, neither its use over the electricity network<br>
nor the possibility for full duplex point to multipoint<br>
communication can be inferred.<br>
On the other hand, point to multipoint communication<br>
systems exist such as that described in the PCT Patent<br>
Number WO96/37062_ where the transmission line can be<br>
coaxial cable, fibre optic or similar, which uses<br>
orthogonal frequency division multiple access modulation<br>
system (OFDM) , a modulation system that is well known in<br>
the background art, and to which a cyclic prefix is added<br>
to each OFDM symbol to alleviate the defects of the<br>
multipath propagation as is well know in the state of the<br>
art. The use of the cyclic prefix with the OFDM<br>
modulation can be encompassed by the DMT modulation used<br>
in the previous document and equally widely used in the<br>
state of the art.<br>
The document describes how channels are established<br>
over respective sub-carrier groups, so that each user is assigned a specific group<br>
of tones so that the hardware and the complexity involved in realizing the<br>
discrete Fourier transformation is substantially reduced, however, as a fixed<br>
system it does not allow the assignation of different sub-carriers to the users<br>
depending on the prevailing frequency and time conditions in each channel, even<br>
when, as described in the case of US Patent No 5.673.290, the individual sub-<br>
carriers can connect or disconnect to avoid interferences.<br>
Furthermore, it uses a remote loop to correct the frequency of local<br>
oscillators of the various user modems.<br>
As a relevant background art we can cite Document EP-1011235-A2, which<br>
discloses an embodiment to receive multicarrier signals over power lines. It shows<br>
an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexed (OFDM) power line communications<br>
system comprising a power line for distributing electricity to a plurality of premises<br>
and a communication station coupled to the power line at one of the premises,<br>
which station uses a part of the power line external to the premises as a<br>
communication medium. The communications station includes a receiver which<br>
comprises a clipping system adapted to a clip an incoming OFDM data waveform,<br>
which includes a regular impulsive noise component, so as to reduce the level of<br>
noise on the waveform.<br>
Another relevant document can be found in EP-0975097, which discloses a<br>
method and device for exchanging, bidirectionally and at a high bit rate, services,<br>
information and data between a service provider and a customer, over a<br>
communication system comprising a conventional low and medium voltage AC<br>
electric power network by means of a signal modulation and transmission<br>
technique (COFDM technique).<br>
We can also cite US Patent Number 5.815.488 and US Patent Number<br>
5.828.660 regarding point to multipoint communication.<br>
Neither in these documents is there a description of the adaptation for the<br>
transmission using the electricity network.<br>
Furthermore, none of the documents cited previously concerns the<br>
transmission for multiple users, nor how to maximize the throughput of the<br>
upstream and downstream channels in the electricity network as it has been<br>
claimed in this document.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The current invention as claimed comprises a system and process for the<br>
digital transmission of data at high speeds in a point to multipoint communication<br>
over the electricity network.<br>
To achieve this, the current invention, as is the<br>
case for other existing conventional systems, makes the<br>
communication or link between a head-end and a plurality<br>
of different users (downstream channel) and from the<br>
users to the head-end (upstream channel), the<br>
communication being achieved by means of an OFDM<br>
(orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) modulation<br>
that generates OFDM symbols to achieve a master-slave<br>
communication when both the users and the head-end<br>
contain a transmitter/receiver including a Medium Access<br>
Control (MAC) module, where, in the case of the current<br>
invention, the medium is the electricity network.<br>
Furthermore, the system of this invention includes the<br>
means of adding/extracting a cyclic prefix to the OFDM<br>
symbols and the means to convert the OFDM symbols from<br>
frequency to time and from time to frequency and digital-<br>
to-analog and analog-to-digital converters.<br>
The invention is characterized because the<br>
transmitter/receiver for the head-end and the users<br>
includes the means of adapting the digital transmission<br>
to the electricity network, so that these allocate the<br>
OFDM modulation with a carrier width reduced to at least<br>
1,5 KHz and with the number of carriers increased to at<br>
least 500 carriers for each 10MHz to strengthen against<br>
selective frequency fading arising from the varying cable<br>
lengths in the electricity network between each user and<br>
the head-end and to strengthen against interferences in<br>
the electricity network.<br>
The means of adapting the digital transmission to<br>
the electricity network requires a cyclic prefix of long<br>
duration, at least 7 microseconds, to adequately<br>
recuperate the signal.<br>
Furthermore, the invention is characterized because<br>
the transmitter for the head-end and the users includes<br>
the means to share the medium in time TDMA (Time Division<br>
Multiple Access), in frequency FDMA (Frequency Division<br>
Multiple Access), and/ or in Orthogonal Frequency<br>
Division Multiplexing (OFDM), that allows for the<br>
allocation of a portion of the carriers used in the<br>
communication and of the data transmitted to each user<br>
and sharing of the upstream and downstream channel by<br>
multiple users, so as to optimise the transmission speed<br>
for each user on the electricity network.<br>
A further characteristic, complementary to the<br>
characteristic described above, is that the head-end and<br>
user receivers include the means to process information<br>
corresponding to the data transmitted in the<br>
communication in the time and frequency domains so as to<br>
recover the shared data transmitted in time and<br>
frequency.<br>
Furthermore, the system of this invention includes<br>
the means to continuously calculate the SNR (signal to<br>
noise ratio) for each one of the carriers of the OFDM<br>
modulation in both the upstream and downstream, so that<br>
different users located at different distances from the<br>
head-end use dynamically different carriers in the same<br>
OFDM symbol, with a variable number of bits per carrier<br>
in function of the SNR calculation, optimising<br>
transmission throughput over the electricity network at<br>
all times.<br>
To achieve this function, the system in this<br>
invention is characterized because both the transmitter<br>
for the head-end and for the users includes the means to<br>
assign and order carriers between users, so as to assign<br>
the number of bits to be associated with each one of the<br>
carriers in the OFDM modulation, from the result of the<br>
SNR calculation. It also includes the means to associate<br>
each one of the carriers with the bits assigned to make<br>
the transmission, taking into account the changes<br>
suffered by the response on the electricity line due to<br>
impendence, attenuation and the varying distances between<br>
the users and the head-end at all times and all<br>
frequencies so as to adapt transmission speed in function<br>
of the quality of transmission required for each user.<br>
Furthermore, the allocation of carriers to distinct<br>
communication provides interleaving in frequency. It is<br>
in this module where the task of sharing the medium with<br>
FDMA, TDMA and/or OFDMA is principally undertaken, as<br>
already mentioned.<br>
This structure allows the maximum speed possible on<br>
the electricity network to be reached, because the<br>
carriers are assigned individually to the users with<br>
enough SNR, and furthermore, each one of the carriers<br>
mentioned is assigned the number of bits it can carry in<br>
function of the SNR calculation, allowing up to 8 bits to<br>
be assigned per carrier when the measure of the SNR is<br>
enough to ensure that the bit error rate of the<br>
communication flows is maintained below a certain value,<br>
where the number of bits are decided in function of<br>
established thresholds, as described earlier.<br>
Obviously the number of 8 bits per carrier can be<br>
increased in function of technical advances.<br>
Another characteristic of the invention is that the<br>
head-end transmitter/receiver as well as those of the<br>
users include the means to allow frequency translation to<br>
bands higher than the base band, so that the digital<br>
signals are adapted to be transmitted over the<br>
electricity network and to allow the use of spectral<br>
zones higher than the base band.<br>
Both the head-end and users transmitter/receiver<br>
includes the means to allow analog processing, using a<br>
digital-to-analog converter that, in the case of the<br>
transmitter, sends data over the electricity network, and<br>
in the case of the receiver, receives data from the<br>
electricity network.<br>
The analog processing includes the means to<br>
establish the voltage and power of the signal to be sent<br>
and filtering means so as to adapt the signal for<br>
transmission over the electricity network.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the means of<br>
frequency translation consists of IQ modulators<br>
/demodulators (in phase and quadrature) that can be<br>
digital or analog, so that in the first case the said IQ<br>
modulator is positioned before the analog processing<br>
block and in the second case it is positioned after<br>
having made the digital-to-analog conversion.<br>
Interpolators and decimators may be introduced<br>
together with the IQ modulator/demodulator to reduce the<br>
number of points necessary to make the discrete Fourier<br>
transform(DFT).<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the means of<br>
frequency translation comprise filtering means and the<br>
selection of one the harmonics produced by the digital-<br>
to-analog converter beginning from the second spectrum<br>
harmonic of the OFDM symbol, in which case the frequency<br>
waveform of the signals must be compensated for to<br>
compensate the response of the time to frequency<br>
conversion (typically one sine). This avoids having to<br>
modulate the signal before sending information, due to<br>
the fact that it is already in frequency bands higher<br>
than the base band.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
means to make the frequency to time conversion of the<br>
OFDM symbols in transmission are set up by a device that<br>
does the complex form of the inverse of the discrete<br>
Fourier transform (IDFT), and in relation to the time to<br>
frequency conversion made by the receptors, this is<br>
achieved by means of a device that performs the complex<br>
form of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT).<br>
The complex DFT as well as the complex IDFT and the<br>
digital IQ modulation/demodulation are used in<br>
combination to reduce the number of points necessary for<br>
the discrete Fourier transform, thereby increasing<br>
flexibility and reducing costs associated with the<br>
implementation of the system.<br>
The frequency translation made by the transmitters<br>
in different possible embodiments, place the signals<br>
transmitted by the network above 1MHz.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention the<br>
number of carriers is 1000 for every 10 MHz.<br>
Furthermore, the invention is characterized because<br>
both the head-end and the users contain the means to add<br>
FEC (forward error correction) information that allocates<br>
data blocks which include redundancy that constitutes<br>
information for the correction/ detection of errors, such<br>
that the FEC in each block and for each user varies so as<br>
to adapt it to the different user situations at different<br>
distances and using different frequencies.<br>
Both the head-end and the users include the means of<br>
interleaving in time, as well as interleaving in<br>
frequency, as already described and consisting of the<br>
selection of the carriers in function of the measure of<br>
the SNR. Interleaving in time distributes the<br>
transmissible data in such a way that the errors produced<br>
due to noise in the network are spread over various data<br>
blocks. Interleaving in time, as well as interleaving in<br>
frequency, changes for each data block formed following<br>
the incorporation of the error correction, and the FEC<br>
also varies for each block, as already mentioned.<br>
The head-end and user transmitters include the means<br>
of scrambling the data so as to avoid that fixed patterns<br>
produce signals in phase that together generate voltage<br>
peaks higher than the dynamic range of the means of<br>
analog processing, furthermore, the head-end and user<br>
receivers include the means of de-scrambling to obtain<br>
the original data transmitted (that is, the data before<br>
the scrambling process).<br>
The method of associating each carrier with the bits<br>
to be transmitted in order to make the transmission, are<br>
set up by a variable constellation encoder, that codes<br>
the data to be sent with the number of bits assigned for<br>
each carrier, having set up the variable encoder<br>
according to one, various or all of the following<br>
modulations:<br>
m-DPSK (differential phase modulation)<br>
m-PSK (phase modulation)<br>
m-QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation)<br>
-(m,n)-APSk (amplitude and phase modulation)<br>
Moreover, the head-end and user receivers include a<br>
variable constellation decoder that decodes the data<br>
received with the number of bits specified by each<br>
carrier, wherein the variable decoder is set up according<br>
to one, various or all of the following demodulations:<br>
m-DPSK (differential phase demodulation)<br>
m-PSK (phase demodulation)<br>
m-QAM (quadrature amplitude demodulation)<br>
-(m,n)-APSK (amplitude and phase demodulation).<br>
The head-end and users receivers include the means<br>
to order the frequencies and to allocate the bits<br>
complementary to the means of ordering and allocation of<br>
frequency and the allocation of the bits of the head-end<br>
and user transmitters.<br>
The head-end and users receivers include the means<br>
of pre-equalization, before the means of time to<br>
frequency conversion, to modify the amplitude and phase<br>
of the received signals and to compensate the<br>
modification caused by the channel in the received<br>
signal.<br>
The analog processing means also contain means of<br>
amplifying and/or attenuating, that are connected to a<br>
hybrid circuit and to a separator to allow the<br>
introduction/extraction of the signal from the<br>
electricity network while eliminating the component that<br>
this brings (50-60 Hz).<br>
Both the head-end and users modems include a module<br>
to control the synchronization between the head-end and<br>
users modems.<br>
Both the head-end and users receivers and<br>
transmitters include a frequency processing module, which<br>
in the case of the user emitter and receiver is made up<br>
of a power pre-equalization module, or power mask, and an<br>
angle corrector rotor that rotates the constellations to<br>
correct frequency and phase errors, while the frequency<br>
processor in the head-end receiver includes a power pre-<br>
equalization module.<br>
The frequency equalizer (FEQ) carries out the<br>
equalization of each one of the received signal carriers.<br>
This function occurs in reception both in the up-stream<br>
and the down-stream and allows the recovery of the signal<br>
while avoiding interference between symbols and the<br>
effects of degradation due to the electricity network.<br>
The SNR may be obtained using the control signals in this<br>
system.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the frequency<br>
error correction in reception occurs by altering the<br>
speed of the sampling clocks in the analog-to-digital<br>
converters in the receivers.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the frequency<br>
error correction occurs by re-sampling the digital signal<br>
obtained in the receiver.<br>
The head-end and users receivers include the means<br>
of extracting the cyclic prefix of the OFDM signals<br>
received, using the information obtained in the<br>
synchronization module to eliminate that part of the<br>
received signal contaminated by echoes due to the multi-<br>
path propagation of the signal in the electricity network<br>
and to obtain the OFDM signals.<br>
The SNR can be calculated from the difference<br>
between the expected signal and that received over a<br>
certain period of time.<br>
The transmission speed is adapted by means of<br>
comparing the SNR with certain previously fixed<br>
thresholds, chosen in function of the different<br>
modulation constellations used in the system.<br>
The thresholds established include hysteresis to<br>
avoid continuous changes if the SNR coincides with any<br>
one of the thresholds, and from these the number of bits<br>
per carrier is obtained, controlling the speed of<br>
transmission.<br>
The head-end MAC includes the means of adding an<br>
indicative header to the data sent identifying to who or<br>
whom the data is sent and the form in which it has been<br>
codified, so that the various users know to whom the<br>
transmission from the head-end is directed. Furthermore,<br>
the head-end MAC is also responsible for identifying<br>
which users may transmit via the upstream channel in each<br>
time period and which carriers may be used, utilizing the<br>
header for the packets sent by the downstream channel or<br>
sending specific messages shared by the users.<br>
The information transmitted in the header, in the<br>
downstream channel, is received by, and can be decodified<br>
by each one of the users. Starting from the destination<br>
information of this header the user determines whether<br>
the information contained in the packet should be<br>
recovered or not.<br>
The MAC in the head-end transmitter/receiver is<br>
responsible for communication control and the sharing of<br>
the transmission over the electricity network in time and<br>
frequency between the various users, and the<br>
administration of each one of the connections.<br>
The head-end MAC is much more complex than that of<br>
the users because, apart from the storing information of<br>
bits per carrier for each one of the users, it includes<br>
an advance logic to take decisions on the assignation of<br>
transmission time and frequencies for each user as well<br>
as synchronization requests, equalization, etc.<br>
For this reason, the MAC is responsible for allowing<br>
the users to transmit in the upstream and downstream<br>
channels, in frequency, time and code.<br>
Furthermore, the invention refers to a process for<br>
the digital transmission of data, point to multipoint,<br>
over the electricity network, comprising the following<br>
phases:<br>
adapting the digital signal of the transmissible<br>
data and multiplexing it to prepare it for<br>
transmission<br>
adding error correction information to introduce<br>
sufficient redundancy to make the correction<br>
and/or detection of errors in reception<br>
interleaving in time to increase the probability<br>
of correction and /or detection of burst errors<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
What follows is a description of the invention based<br>
on the figures previously mentioned.<br>
As previously mentioned the invention consists of a<br>
system for full-duplex transmission over the electricity<br>
network at high speed between a head-end and a plurality<br>
of users using a master-slave architecture.<br>
The communication from the head-end to the users is<br>
referred to as downstream communication or downstream<br>
channel, and the communication from the users to the<br>
head-end is referred to as the upstream communication or<br>
upstream channel.<br>
As in FIG. l, both the head-end and the users<br>
contain a transmitter 1 and a receiver 2 that through a<br>
hybrid circuit 3 and from a separator 4 are connected to<br>
the electricity network 5 to permit carrying out the<br>
communication between the head-end and the users.<br>
Both the transmitter 1 of the head-end and that of<br>
the users take the form of a general structure comprising<br>
a data processing block 6, which takes the information<br>
that the equipment that makes use of the modem wants to<br>
send, adapts it, composes the frames to be sent and<br>
delivers them to a digital processing block 7, that<br>
carries out the OFDM modulation and the frequency<br>
translation to use higher bands than base band, so as to<br>
adapt it to the electricity network and to utilize higher<br>
spectral zones to the base band, and deliver the signal<br>
to an analog processing block 8, responsible for adapting<br>
the signal to the analog environment so as to be able to<br>
transmit it over the electricity network, converting the<br>
digital signal to analog, and filtering it to remove out<br>
of band components, and amplifying it to be transmitted<br>
through the electricity network.<br>
The analog processing block 8 constitutes the medium<br>
by which the connection between transmitter 1 and the<br>
hybrid 3 is made, as well as separating the transmission<br>
and reception signals so that the maximum power is<br>
transmitted to the transmission line and the maximum<br>
signal is received from the electricity network, whereby<br>
the separator 4 is responsible for permitting the sending<br>
and receiving of data through the electricity network 5,<br>
by means of a filter that eliminates the frequency of the<br>
network in reception and allows the signal being sent<br>
pass through for transmission over the electricity<br>
network.<br>
Equally, the receiver 2, both of the head-end and of<br>
the users, includes an analog processing block 11 that<br>
receives the analog signal transmitted by the network and<br>
converts it to digital, prior to amplification and<br>
filtering, and delivers it to a digital processing block<br>
that translates the frequency band used to carry out the<br>
transmission through the electricity network to base<br>
band, at the same time it recuperates the OFDM<br>
demodulated symbols and delivers them to a data<br>
processing block 9, where, from the recovered frames, the<br>
original information sent is recovered and delivered to<br>
the corresponding electronic equipment: computer,<br>
television set, etc.<br>
With the aid of FIG. 2, the system is described in<br>
greater detail in which both the transmitter 1 and the<br>
receptor 2 are connected to a user data interface 12 that<br>
enables communication between the modem and the<br>
electronic equipment.<br>
In the data processing block 6, the data package 15<br>
(FIG. 4) is multiplexed to be sent. This block composes<br>
the frame 16 for transmission under the control of a<br>
Medium Access Control module (MAC) 14 so that a header 17<br>
is added to indicate to who or whom the data package 15<br>
is directed, the means of encoding the data, the<br>
priority, the type of message, etc.<br>
The forward error correction (FEC) module 20 takes<br>
data blocks 18 composed of a specific number of bytes and<br>
adds error correction and/or error detection codes 19 to<br>
each one of the blocks 18 to introduce sufficient<br>
redundancy to carry out the correction/detection of<br>
errors in reception. The error correction/detection codes<br>
19 can be any of those known in the state of the art for<br>
example BCH, REED-SOLOMON, REED-MULLER, etc.<br>
It is important to indicate that the error<br>
correction/detection code can vary for each block of data<br>
18 and for each user, as will be explained later.<br>
Therefore, the FEC 2 0 carriers a number of bytes and<br>
on exiting obtains a greater number of bytes that contain<br>
the initial information as well as more redundancy<br>
introduced by the error correction/detection codes.<br>
The FEC is governed by the MAC 14.<br>
Furthermore, the data processing block 6 includes a<br>
block for interleaving in time 22 that improves the<br>
characteristics of error correction when faced with the<br>
bursts of noise produced in the electricity network.<br>
Thanks to this block the noise burst errors are<br>
transformed into scrambled errors after carrying out the<br>
de-interleaving, that is, they remain disseminated in<br>
various blocks of data, so that the errors produced by<br>
these noises on the electricity network do not produce<br>
adjacent errors in reception. So, therefore the<br>
interleaving in time block 22 carries out a re-ordering<br>
attending to distinct lengths of block, where these<br>
lengths are a function of the desired protection to offer<br>
in the system mainly based on the average duration of<br>
impulse noise in the channel. Therefore the length of the<br>
blocks and the number of blocks obtained from FEC 20<br>
takes into account the average characteristics expected<br>
in the channel.<br>
FIG. 5 shows a possible example of interleaving in<br>
time, where in the case in question, it is produced by<br>
means of introducing the bytes in rows 72 and extracting<br>
said bytes in columns 71, so that what is produced is the<br>
interleaving previously mentioned.<br>
Following on from the interleaving in time, the data<br>
processing block 6 includes a bit assigner and frequency<br>
ordering 23 that carries out the interleaving in<br>
frequency, for which the MAC 14 informs of the carriers<br>
available at each moment and the ones that should be<br>
utilized in each communication 82; all of this starting<br>
from the measurement of the SNR carried out for the<br>
digital processing block 10 of the receptor 2, as will be<br>
described later. Thus the bit assigner and the frequency<br>
ordering 23 assigns the bits of the package to be<br>
transmitted to each one of the carriers selected for the<br>
communication. It produces the data in parallel 83.<br>
Therefore, the characteristics as mentioned for the<br>
data processing block 6 determine the execution of a time<br>
division multiple access (TDMA), a frequency division<br>
multiple access (FDMA) and the orthogonal frequency<br>
division multiple access (OFDMA).<br>
TDMA is performed by means of controlling in every<br>
single moment of time for which user the communication is<br>
intended (utilizing all or part of the carriers available<br>
for the transmission).<br>
FDMA is carried out by means of controlling the bit<br>
assigner and frequency ordering 23 on the part of the MAC<br>
14, to indicate what carriers should be utilized for the<br>
transmission.<br>
In OFDMA each user is offered a portion of the total<br>
usable carriers in the communication.<br>
The interleaving in frequency can change for each<br>
package of information to be sent and for each user, and<br>
it adapts itself to the different users situated at<br>
different distances and using different frequencies, as<br>
it is explained further on.<br>
This structure permits maximum use of the upstream<br>
and downstream channels, since the sharing process is<br>
carried out in frequency and in time, both in the<br>
upstream channel and the downstream.<br>
Finally, the data processing block 6 includes a<br>
scrambler 24 that avoids producing patterns of bits that<br>
generate signals in phase in multiple carriers that could<br>
increase the voltage at the exit of the analog processing<br>
block 8, causing this block, on not having a sufficient<br>
dynamic range to bear it, to produce cuts in the voltage<br>
peaks. The scrambler reduces the probability of said<br>
peaks occur.<br>
Following on from this, the data passes to the<br>
digital processing block 7 (FIG. 2) that has a<br>
constellation encoder 28 that can be: m-DPSK<br>
(differential phase modulation), m-PSK (phase<br>
modulation), m-QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation)<br>
and/or (m, n) - APSK (amplitude and phase modulation) , so<br>
as to optimize the quantity of transmittable data when<br>
using an encoder with a variable number of bits per<br>
carrier that depends on the channel characteristics<br>
measured in each moment and on the desired communication<br>
speed, which is indicated by means of the parameters "n"<br>
and "m" of the different codifications indicated.<br>
Therefore upon exiting the constellation encoder 28 an<br>
OFDM digital modulation in the frequency domain<br>
(orthogonal division multiplexing in time) is obtained.<br>
Subsequently the coded signal is introduced in a<br>
frequency domain processor 29, which is governed by the<br>
MAC 14, and whose configuration varies depending on<br>
whether it is the head-end transmitter or the user<br>
transmitter. In the case that it is the user transmitter<br>
the frequency domain processor 2 9 consists of a power<br>
mask and a rotor. The power mask acts like a pre-<br>
equalization before the known frequency characteristics<br>
of the channel, modifying the amplitude of the signal<br>
received in the frequencies used in the communication,<br>
and the rotor compensates for the small variations of<br>
frequency and phase due to the changes in the function of<br>
transfer of the channel that cause the constellation in<br>
reception to be "rotated" regarding transmission.<br>
The frequency domain processor of the head-end only<br>
includes a power mask that carries out the said pre-<br>
equalization, since there is no need to include the rotor<br>
given that both the transmitter and the receptor of the<br>
user include said rotor avoiding that the modem of the<br>
head-end has to carry out this function.<br>
The preferred algorithm for computation of the<br>
discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is FFT (fast Fourier<br>
transform), due to the high efficiency of this algorithm.<br>
In the same way the inverse of DFT would be carried out<br>
preferentially with the algorithm IFFT (inverse of fast<br>
Fourier transform).<br>
Subsequently, the digital processing block 7, has a<br>
device IFFT 3 0 that carries out the complex inverse of<br>
the fast Fourier transform with which it performs the<br>
translation of the frequency domain to the time domain,<br>
and subsequently eliminates the parallelism produced by<br>
the bit assigner and frequency ordering 23 that<br>
distributed the information in a series of carriers by<br>
means of the governing MAC; obtaining a single signal.<br>
After carrying out the transformation to the time<br>
domain, the signal is introduced in a cyclic prefix<br>
generator 31 that consists of a storage device that is<br>
controlled by the MAC 14 to create a cyclic prefix 65<br>
(FIG. 7), which is a repetition in time of the final part<br>
of the OFDM symbol that is to be transmitted. In this<br>
figure, the previous symbol 74 and the subsequent symbol<br>
75 are also represented.<br>
The signal is then introduced into an IQ modulator<br>
33 (in phase and quadrature) , subject to passing through<br>
an interpolator, so that by means of the interpolator an<br>
adequate number of samples are obtained before carrying<br>
out the IQ modulation. This modulation carries out the<br>
translation of the frequency in the base band to an upper<br>
band adapting it to the electricity network.<br>
The employment of the complex IFFT together with the<br>
IQ modulator facilitates the frequency translation, since<br>
the input of the IFFT device 3 0 are the signals of the<br>
carriers pertaining to the distinct entrances, that are<br>
introduced directly, and its exit is a complex signal<br>
(that is to say, a signal whose imaginary part is<br>
distinct from zero). It permits the realization of the<br>
IQ modulation directly upon this exit since the real part<br>
corresponds with the signal in phase (I) while the<br>
imaginary one corresponds with the signal in quadrature<br>
(Q) or vice versa, and only has to multiply with an<br>
oscillator of the adequate central frequency to transfer<br>
the band to this central frequency, which reduces the<br>
hardware structure considerably.<br>
The exit of the IQ modulator 33 applies to the<br>
analog processing block 8, which includes a digital-to-<br>
analog converter 34 that converts the modulated digital<br>
signals to analog for transmission through the<br>
electricity network 5 (FIG. 2 and FIG. 3).<br>
At this point it must be stated that because of<br>
this, the IQ modulation is digital, but likewise an<br>
analog IQ modulation may be carried out, that is to say<br>
after the digital to analog converter, notwithstanding<br>
that this represents a significant modification in the<br>
design of the system.<br>
In addition, the analog processing block 8 has a<br>
smoothed filter 35 that is comprised of a low pass filter<br>
35a and a high pass filter 35b that follows a<br>
programmable gain amplifier 3 6 that also is united to a<br>
fixed gains amplifier 37 so that the levels of the signal<br>
are adapted to transmission and so as to assure the<br>
connection between the extremes. This signal is applied<br>
in the hybrid 3 and subsequently in the separator 4 that<br>
introduces the signal in the electricity network<br>
filtering the network component of 50-60 Hz, to avoid the<br>
saturation of components in reception.<br>
The operating frequency of the digital-to-analog<br>
converter 34 is governed by the synchronisation control<br>
module 27 for which this provides a digital signal to a<br>
digital-to-analog converter 29 that provides on its exit<br>
a voltage signal to rule the operation of an oscillator<br>
controlled by voltage 38 that applies to the digital-to-<br>
analog converter 34 of the analog processing block 8.<br>
The data transmitted comprise a header coded by<br>
means of a robust modulation, as for example QPSK<br>
modulation, to withstand noises or errors produced in the<br>
line, and the original data where the coding itself<br>
depends on the constellation utilized in each carrier in<br>
its transmission as already discussed. This header<br>
includes information regarding which user modem or modems<br>
are the destination of the information, the priority, the<br>
size, etc. These headers must be understood by each and<br>
everyone of the user modems, which have to demodulate the<br>
head-end, including cases in which the SNR is low, and is<br>
made possible thanks to the QPSK modulation, the FEC with<br>
high correction, and the redundancy previously commented.<br>
This redundancy consisted of sending the information<br>
repeatedly a specific number of times in distinct<br>
frequencies, in distinct times, and/or in distinct codes,<br>
so that the user modems are able to demodulate the<br>
information of the header with greater confidence.<br>
The signal sent by the electricity network is<br>
received by the receptors 2, which carry out the inverse<br>
process of transmission, for which the analog processing<br>
block 11 has an amplifier 50 (FIG. 2 and FIG. 3) that<br>
includes a low noise amplifier 50a and a programmable<br>
gain amplifier 50b, in addition to having a filter 51<br>
that is comprised of a low pass filter 51a and a high<br>
pass filter 51b, that actually delivers the signal to the<br>
programmable gains amplifier 50b, for the subsequent<br>
analog-to-digital conversion of the signal by means of<br>
the corresponding converter 52 that likewise is governed<br>
by the synchronisation control module 27, through the<br>
oscillator controlled by voltage 38.<br>
Afterwards the information passes to the IQ<br>
demodulator 53, which delivers it to a decimator. After<br>
carrying out the demodulation, and the further filtered<br>
decimation, the cyclic prefix is extracted 65 by means of<br>
a cyclic prefix extractor 55 so that the uncontaminated<br>
part of the symbols, where the contamination is mainly<br>
due to the echoes of the multipath propagation, is taken<br>
out.<br>
FIG. 7 schematically represents the direct wave 66,<br>
that arrives directly to the receptor, as well as the<br>
different echoes 67, 68 and 69, which along with 70<br>
represent the signal that the receptor obtains from the<br>
all that went before, and for which it is necessary to<br>
choose a long symbol period and an adequate cyclic prefix<br>
to assure the correct reception. In the current<br>
embodiment the cyclic prefix is on the order of 7<br>
microseconds.<br>
The reception signal is windowed in order to permit<br>
the correct recovery of the OFDM symbols, and therefore<br>
the need to carry out equalisation of the signal in time<br>
is avoided.<br>
Once the sent OFDM symbols are correctly extracted<br>
they pass to an FFT device 56 (fast Fourier transform)<br>
that carries out the conversion of the signal from time<br>
to frequency and delivers it to a frequency equaliser 57.<br>
All this process is controlled by the<br>
synchronization control module 27 so that the sampling<br>
carried out in each one of the receptors of the<br>
multipoint communication are similar to that carried out<br>
in the head-end modem, and so that it is possible to know<br>
the start of each OFDM symbol in reception and thus to be<br>
able to extract the cyclic prefix carrying out the<br>
correct windowing.<br>
The frequency equaliser 57 comprises a frequency<br>
domain processor that makes the symbol on its exit as<br>
close as possible to the symbol sent from the<br>
transmitter, compensating for the behaviour of the<br>
channel that introduces attenuation and phase distortion<br>
in each one of the carriers utilized in the<br>
communication.<br>
As mentioned, the electricity network is not stable<br>
in time, therefore the process of equalisation should be<br>
carried out in continuous form.<br>
By means of the frequency domain processor 57, the<br>
SNR is obtained, and it will be utilized to carry out the<br>
assignment of bits in the transmitter. In the current<br>
embodiment, said SNR is obtained as part of the error<br>
signal calculation in the frequency equalization, since<br>
the power utilized in transmission is known.<br>
The measurement of the SNR is carried out over a<br>
specific period of time before validating the new SNR in<br>
a carrier, so as to avoid the production of instsntaneous<br>
false values of SNR due to punctual noises in the<br>
electricity network. As commented previously the SNR<br>
information is utilized to assign the bits to the<br>
different carriers and thus to adapt the speed of<br>
transmission.<br>
In the system of this invention it can use from zero<br>
to eight bits per carrier, in function of the value of<br>
the SNR obtained as indicated. At present, none of the<br>
systems employed in transmission over the electricity<br>
network allows for the incorporation of more than two<br>
bits per carrier, and therefore they have a slow<br>
transmission speed, an issue that is solved by the system<br>
described in this invention.<br>
Therefore, in function of the bits employed by the<br>
carrier, the transmission speed is adapted, for which the<br>
measured SNR 80 is compared with a series of thresholds<br>
76 to 79 (FIG. 8) to which certain histeresis has been<br>
introduced so as to avoid continuous changes if the SNR<br>
coincides with some of the thresholds; and from this the<br>
number of bits per carrier (bpc) in each group of<br>
frequencies 81 is obtained. FIG. 8 shows a possible<br>
example of the different thresholds established for the<br>
selection of bits per carrier.<br>
The process of adaptation is repeated continuously<br>
for all the carriers, or for one or various sets of them,<br>
so that the maximum applicable speed is reached over the<br>
electricity network at all times, according to the<br>
immediate characteristics of the channel that vary in<br>
function of time due to the characteristics of the<br>
electricity network, as already commented previously.<br>
As indicated previously the MAC 14 assigns different<br>
carriers for the different users, as well as the number<br>
of bits to be associated with each one of them. This<br>
function follows on from the SNR obtained, assigning the<br>
carriers that a user cannot utilize, due to the fact that<br>
they have a low SNR, to other users that have sufficient<br>
SNR so as to be able to utilize them. Furthermore, it<br>
assigns the frequencies to distinct users in function of<br>
the bits per carrier that they can utilize in each one of<br>
the carriers.<br>
Subsequently the signals obtained pass through a<br>
variable constellation decoder 58 that carries out the<br>
demodulation of the carriers of the OFDM symbols and then<br>
it de-scrambles them by means of a de-scrambler 59 and<br>
the FDMA and TDMA demodulation is carried out by means of<br>
a module of assignment of bits and arrangement of<br>
frequencies 60 complementary to that 23 described for the<br>
transmitter.<br>
In addition the receptor has a de-interleaved block<br>
62 complementary to the interleaved block 22 of said<br>
transmitter. Subsequently the error correction/detection<br>
is carried out by means of the FEC device 63 that<br>
delivers the data to the interface 12 with the external<br>
equipment.<br>
Therefore except for the difference already<br>
indicated, the head-end and user modems have a similar<br>
configuration, and with one added difference, as can be<br>
concluded from the description already given, that is,<br>
the MAC processor 14 in the case of the head-end modem<br>
has a more complicated configuration than in the case of<br>
the users, since it has to store the number of bits per<br>
carrier that should be sent to each of the users, and in<br>
addition includes the header governing from and to whom<br>
the information is directed as well as the frequencies<br>
and periods of time that each one of the users can<br>
utilize.<br>
Furthermore, in the system of this invention, the process<br>
described in the section concerning the description of<br>
the invention is applicable, and can be deduced clearly<br>
from the explanations carried out with the aid of the<br>
figures.<br>
