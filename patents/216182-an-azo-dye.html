				<td>The present invention relates to novel azo dyes, processes for their preparation and their use.<br>
The practice of dyeing has recently lead to increased requirements regarding the quality of the dyeings and the profitability of the dyeing process. There consequently continues to be a demand for novel, readily accessible dyes which have good properties, in particular in respect of application.<br>
In the case of fibre-reactive dyes, those dyes, for example, which have an adequate substantivity and at the same time a good ease of washing off unfixed portions are required nowadays. They should furthermore have a good tinctorial yield and a high reactivity, and in particular dyeings with high degrees of fixing should be delivered. These requirements are not met with regard to all the properties by the known dyes.<br>
The present invention is therefore based on the object of discovering novel azo dyes, in particular for dyeing and printing fibre materials, which have the qualities characterized above to a high degree. They should produce dyeings with good allround properties, for example light and wet fastness properties.<br>
The present invention thus relates to azo dyes containing at least one structural unit of the formula (1)<br>
  (1).<br>
The azo dyes according to the invention can belong to various classes of dye, according to their tinctorial use. These classes of dye are described, for example, in Venkataraman "The Chemistry of Synthetic Dyes" Volume 1, pages 268-303, Academic Press, New York,<br><br>
London 1952 and Volume 6, pages 1-4, Academic Press, New York, London 1972. The azo dyes according to the invention are preferably acid, direct or reactive dyes for dyeing cotton, wool, leather, paper and wood, and in particular reactive dyes for dyeing cotton and wool, i.e. they contain at least one, and preferably at least two, fibre-reactive groups and are capable of reacting with the hydroxyl groups of cellulose or with the reactive centres of natural and synthetic polyamides to form covalent chemical bonds. Documents DE 3428836 Al and US Pat. No. 4263229 disclose non-reactive metal complexes of trisazo dyes based on 1,3-diamino benzene for dyeing leather.<br>
The azo dyes according to the invention preferably have the formula (2), (3) or (4)<br><br>

  (19),<br>
such that an azo dye which contains at least one structural unit of the formula (1) is obtained.<br>
More than one diazotized amine means, for example, 2 or 3 diazotized amines.<br>
Amines which are suitable for the preparation of the azo dyes according to the invention are, for example, aromatic amines of the benzene or naphthalene series which can be diazotized and are capable of coupling in accordance with processes known per se, such as are described, for example, in Venkataraman "The Chemistry of Synthetic Dyes" Volume 1, pages 210-214 and 409-441, Academic Press, New York, London 1952.<br>
The amines are diazotized, for example, with a nitrite, for example with an alkali metal nitrite, such as sodium nitrite, in a mineral acid medium, for example in a hydrochloric acid medium, at temperatures of, for example, -5 to 40°C, and preferably at -5 to 10°C.<br>
Coupling to the coupling components of the formula (19) is carried out in a manner known per se at an acid or neutral to weakly alkaline pH, for example a pH of 1 to 10, and at temperatures of, for example, -5 to 40°C, preferably 0 to 30°C.<br><br>
The coupling reaction is advantageously first carried out in a strongly acid medium, for example at pH 1, and the pH of the reaction mixture is increased slowly, for example to pH 5 to 8, as the reaction progresses.<br>
Azo dyes of the formula (2) in which A is oxygen and R is hydrogen and D, = D2 = D3 or D2 = D3 = DT are obtained, for example, by first reacting about 1 molar equivalent of a diazotized amine of the formula (20a)<br>

Azo dyes of the formula (3) in which D1 = D2 = D3 or D2 = D3 = D, are obtained, for example, by reacting about 2 molar equivalents of a compound of the formula (22a) with about 1 molar equivalent of a compound of the formula (24)<br>
HA-B-AH	(24)<br>
in a manner known per se to give a compound of the formula (22c)<br>
  (22c),<br>
reducing the compound of the formula (22c) to a compound of the formula (19d)<br>
  (19d)<br>
in a manner known per se and then further reacting the compound of the formula (19d) stepwise with the equivalent amount of the diazotized amines of the formulae (20a) and (20b) analogously to the procedure described above, where A and B are as defined and preferred above.<br>
The conditions for the reduction of the compounds of the formulae (22b) and (22c) are advantageously chosen such that any functional groups present in R, R" or B are not reduced. Such selective reduction reactions are known and are widely described in the relevant literature.<br>
Those dyes of the formulae (2) and (3) according to the invention in which DT ;£ D2 ^ D3 can be obtained if the procedure described above is followed, except the equimolar amount of a<br><br>
mixture of, for example, two diazotized amines D2-NH2 and D3-NH2 in a molar ratio of, for example, 1:1 is used in place of a diazotized amine D2-NH2. As a rule, these dyes are obtained as mixtures.<br>
Azo dyes of the formula (4) in which A is oxygen and R is hydrogen and D1 = D2 are obtained, for example, by first reacting about 1 molar equivalent of a tetrazotized diamine of the formula (20c)<br>
H2N-D4-NH2	(20c)<br>
in a hydrochloric acid medium with about 2 molar equivalents of a compound of the formula (19a) to give a compound of the formula (21 b)<br>
  (21b)<br>
and allowing the compound of the formula (21b) to react at an increased pH with about 4 molar equivalents of a diazotized amine of the formula D1-NH2, where D1 and D4 are as defined and preferred above.<br>
Azo dyes of the formula (4) in which A is oxygen, sulfur or a radical -NR"- and R is an aliphatic or aromatic radical and D1 = D2 are obtained, for example, if the procedure described above is followed, except that the equimolar amount of a compound of the formula (19c) is used in place of the compound of the formula (19a).<br>
Those dyes of the formulae (4) according to the invention in which D^ * D2 can be obtained if the procedure described above is followed, except that an equimolar amount of a mixture of, for example, two diazotized amines DrNH2 and D2-NH2 in a molar ratio of, for example, 1:1 is used in place of a diazotized amine DrNH2. As a rule, the dyes are obtained as mixtures.<br><br>
The compounds of the formulae (19a), (20a), (20b), (20c), (22a), (23) and (24) are known or can be obtained in a manner known per se.<br>
Valuable direct dyes can be obtained from the dyes according to the invention which contain exclusively one or more halogenotriazinyl radicals of the formula (6f) as the fibre-reactive radical and in which X, is chlorine or fluorine and "H is a radical which is not fibre-reactive, by further reacting the dye with an amount equivalent to the amount of halogenotriazinyl of, for example, a compound of the formula "TVH, in which T1 is as defined above, excluding a fibre-reactive radical. In particular, TrH is ammonia, an amine which is unsubstituted or substituted as defined above or morpholine. Such reactions can be carried out by processes known per se.<br>
The dyes according to the invention are suitable for dyeing and printing the most diverse materials, in particular fibre materials containing hydroxyl groups or containing nitrogen. Examples are paper, silk, leather, wool, polyamide fibres and polyurethanes, and in particular all types of cellulosic fibre materials. Such fibre materials are, for example, the natural cellulose fibres, such as cotton, linen and hemp, as well as pulp and regenerated cellulose. The dyes according to the invention are also suitable for dyeing or printing fibres containing hydroxyl groups which are contained in blend fabrics, for example mixtures of cotton with polyester fibres or polyamide fibres.<br>
The present invention therefore furthermore relates to the use of compounds of the formula (1) for dyeing or printing fibre materials containing hydroxyl groups or containing nitrogen, in particular containing cotton.<br>
The dyes according to the invention can be applied to the fibre material and fixed to the fibre in various ways, in particular in the form of aqueous dye solutions and printing pastes. They are suitable both for the exhaust method and for dyeing by the padder method, can be employed at low dyeing temperatures and require only short steaming times in the pad-steam process. The degrees of fixing are high and the unfixed portions can easily be washed off, the difference between the degree of exhaustion and degree of fixing being remarkably small, i.e. the soaping loss is very low. The dyes according to the invention are also suitable for printing, in particular on cotton, but likewise also for printing fibres containing nitrogen, for example wool, silk or blend fabrics containing wool.<br><br>
The dyeings and prints produced with the dyes according to the invention, in particular the reactive dyes, have a high colour strength and a high fibre-dye bond stability both in the acid and in the alkaline range, and furthermore a good fastness to light and very good wet-fastness properties, such as fastness to washing, water, sea water, crossdyeing and perspiration. Dyeings which are level over the fibre and surface are obtained.<br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the invention. Temperatures are stated in degrees Celsius, parts are parts by weight and percentage data relate to % by weight, unless noted otherwise. Parts by weight bear the same relation to parts by volume as the kilogram to the litre.<br>
Example 1:17.3 parts of an amine of the formula D10-NH2, in which D10 is a radical of the formula<br><br>
are introduced into 215 parts of water and the mixture is stirred thoroughly. 25 parts of a 4N sodium nitrite solution are added to the resulting solution at 0°C and 20 parts of concentrated hydrochloric acid are then slowly added dropwise at 0 to 5°C.

Examples 3 to 33: The diazo compounds of the amines listed in Table 1 can be prepared analogously to the procedure described in Examples 1 or 2 if an equimolar amount of the<br><br>

are dissolved in 160 parts of water under neutral conditions. 13 parts of concentrated hydrochloric acid and then 19.5 parts of a 4N sodium nitrite solution are slowly added at 0°C. When the diamine has reacted to give the corresponding tetrazo compound, the excess nitrite is destroyed by addition of sulfamic acid.<br><br>
Examples 35 to 37: The tetrazo compounds of the diamines listed in Table 2 can be prepared analogously to the procedure described in Example 34 if an equimolar amount of the diamines of the formula H2N-Dxy-NH2 listed in Table 2 is used in place of the diamine of the formula H2N-D43-NH2 mentioned in Example 34.<br><br>
