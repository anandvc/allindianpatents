				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE IMVENTIOM<br>
1. Technical Fielđ<br>
Present invention relates to a system and method for<br>
restoring desktop components. In particular, the present<br>
invention relates to a system and method to recover desktop<br>
components from distributed computers using self-containeđ<br>
package data.<br>
2. Description of the Relateđ Art<br>
Tođay's modern computer software systems are often<br>
enterprise systems organized in a distributed fashion<br>
throughout the organization. The various people in the<br>
organization perform different roles using the computer system<br>
đepenđing upon the user's job description. In a banking<br>
example, one user may be a teller and therefore need teller<br>
applications in orđer to serve banking customers. Another<br>
user may be a loan officer, and need to access loan officer<br>
applications to serve customers that are applying for loans. *-.<br>
A third user may be the branch manager, and need to access<br>
computer functions useđ to manage the bank branch.<br>
Organizations often desire the abilit:y to centrally manage<br>
their distributed shared systems.<br>
Traditional computer systems are typically designed to<br>
either provided ali necessary functions through each computer,<br>
for example by using a computer network to access the needed<br>
functions, or the svstem is designed so that individual<br>
workstations perform particular roles and are therefore used<br>
by a particular user or set of users. This presents<br>
challenges in organization where multiple users use the same<br>
client computer systenv. In the banking example, there may be<br>
several tellers that share the same client computer system,<br>
depending on the shift, day of the week, or which teller<br>
happens to be assigned to a particular workstation.<br>
If ali organizational functions are provided from the<br>
same workstation, us'ers that are not authorized to perform a<br>
particular function may accidentally or deliberately perform<br>
functions for which they are not authorized. For example, a<br>
teller may accidentally, or deliberately, perform a loan<br>
officer or branch manager function if the function is<br>
available from the teller's workstation. One way traditional<br>
systems handle authorizations is by installing software<br>
components to handle each job role at each workstation, but<br>
limiting access based upon the user login. A challenge of<br>
this approach, however, is that each workstation neeđs to<br>
receive any new or modified software components in order to be<br>
available for any user that may need such functionality from<br>
any given workstation. Another challenge of this approach is<br>
that every workstation has to be modified.<br>
Some of the functions performed by users may be clientserver<br>
functioris, while other functions may involve using<br>
software systems that have been installed on the user's<br>
workstation. Software systems installed on the user's<br>
workstation may include legacy software applications and other<br>
software that has been written for a particular operating<br>
system environment.<br>
A system and method that provides centralized management<br>
of self-contained desktop packages that include the components<br>
needed to perform particular functions is useful in organizing<br>
and managing computing functions performed throughout an<br>
organization. A challenge of using centrally created and<br>
managed components is the increased value of the role created<br>
by the central administrator and the potential loss to the<br>
organization if the files maintained by the central<br>
administrator are destroyed.<br>
What is needed, therefore, is a system and method that<br>
allows a central administrator to recover component files<br>
previously sent to servers and clients located throughout the<br>
organization. In ađdition, what is needed is a system and<br>
method that uniquely identifies component files in order to<br>
identify the various components as well as multiple releases<br>
of the components.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
It has been discovered that the aforementioned challenges<br>
are resolved using a system and method that centrally manages<br>
desktop packages. The. system allows a central administrator<br>
to recover component files previously sent to servers and<br>
clients located throughout the organization.<br>
The administrator assigns applications to users and<br>
vrorkstations. The administrator selects desktop components<br>
needed for a particular job role and packages the components<br>
into a self-contained desktop package file. The selfcontained<br>
desktop package is sent to a user that is using a<br>
particular workstation. The system identifies one or more<br>
roles that have been assigned to the user and matches the<br>
identified roles with one or more roles that have been<br>
assigned to the vrorkstation. Roles that are allowed for both<br>
the vrorkstation and the user are enabled to be used by the<br>
,user using the vrorkstation.<br>
In one embodiment, the components are packageđ in<br>
different sets of self-contained đesktop packages, with each<br>
package corresponđing to a different role. In a banking<br>
example, a different đesktop package would be created for each<br>
banking role performed by users, such as a teller, loan<br>
officer., and branch manager. Each of these self-containeđ<br>
đesktop packages includes the components needed to perform the<br>
corresponđing function. For example, a đesktop component used<br>
to operate a cash drawer woulđ be included with the teller<br>
package, while a đesktop component used to access the bank's<br>
loan application software would be included with the loan<br>
officer package. Components common to multiple roles are<br>
included in each package in which they are needed. For<br>
example/ a component used to access a customer account might<br>
be included in both the teller and loan officer packages.<br>
The self-contained đesktop packages are transmitteđ, or<br>
"published," to servers. The servers, in turn, provide the<br>
self-contained đesktop packages to clients. The packages and<br>
the components included in the packages include unigue<br>
identifiers used to iđentifv the packages and components. In<br>
addition, a manifest is maintained detailing the individual<br>
components included in each of the self-contained đesktop<br>
files.<br>
When a đisaster event occurs at the administrator's<br>
computer system, such as a fire or drive failure, the<br>
administrator retrieves the self-contained đesktop files from<br>
the servers to which the packages vere previously transmitted.<br>
The .administrator repopulates the component•libraries by<br>
unpacking the components from the self-contained đesktop<br>
files. The administrator uses the manifest to determine<br>
whether additional self-contained package files need to be<br>
retrieveđ from other servers.<br>
The foregoing is a summary and thus contains, by<br>
necessity, simplifications, generalizations, and omissions of<br>
detail; conseguently, those skilleđ in the art will appreciate<br>
that the summary is illustrative only and is not intended to<br>
be in any way limiting. Other aspects, inventive features,<br>
and ađvantages of the present invention, as defined solely by<br>
the claims, will become apparent in the non-limiting detailed<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The following is intended to provide a detailed<br>
description of an example of the invention and should not be<br>
taken to be limiting of the invention itself. Rather, any<br>
number of variations may fali within the scope of the<br>
invention which is đefined in the claims following the<br>
description.<br>
Figure l is a network điagram of a networked computer<br>
system that uses self-contained desktops. Administrator 100<br>
creates self-contained desktops 110 by combining images 115,<br>
application extensions 120, national language translations<br>
125, client configuration files 130, server configuration<br>
files 135, and desktop profile information 140. Selfcontained<br>
desktops 110 inclu.de ali information needed for a<br>
client to use cornponents on the client's workstation given the<br>
client's particular role.<br>
Self-contained desktops 110 are transmitted to one or<br>
more servers 150 for dissemination to clients. Servers 150<br>
combine user roles 155 with workstation roles 160 to determine<br>
which self-contained desktops to send to clients. 'Clients 165<br>
perform login function' 170 đuring which the user ID, and<br>
passworđ are gathered and transmitted to servers 150 to<br>
effectuate a login. Clients 165 perform login function 170<br>
đuring which the user ID and machine ID are gathered and<br>
transmitted to servers 150 to receive a list of allowed<br>
desktops.<br>
Servers 150 receive the user ID, password, and machine ID<br>
from clients and determine which self-contained desktops to<br>
transmit to the clients based upon the user roles 155 and the<br>
workstation roles 160 that correspond to the particular user<br>
ID and the particular workstation being used by the client.<br>
The identified self-contained desktops are responsively<br>
transmitted from server 150 to client 165.<br>
Client 165 performs loađ shell process 175 to loađ shell<br>
application 180 onto the client workstation. The shell<br>
process is an application that is loaded onto a midđleware<br>
application, such as a Java virtual machfne (JVM). In this<br>
manner, the shell application appears consistent and<br>
substantially similar regardless of the operating system<br>
platform being used by the client workstation. Shell<br>
application 180 is ađapted to retrieve and display selfcontained<br>
desktops 190. Client 165 receives self-contained<br>
desktops based upon the intersection of the user and the<br>
workstation identifiers. The self-contained desktops are<br>
received and displayed using process 185. A given client can<br>
therefore utilize multiple self-contained desktops. These<br>
self-contained desktops incluđe toolbars, menus, and other<br>
graphical user interface items used to communicate with the<br>
user. Some of these user interfaces incluđe functionality<br>
that communicate with server applications hosted by servers<br>
150. Other user interfaces incluđe extensions that map to<br>
client-based applications 195. When a user clicks on a<br>
desktop component that maps to a client-based application,<br>
functionality exists within the self-contained desktop to<br>
invoke, or otherwise use, the client-based application. If a<br>
client has multiple self-contained desktops at its disposal,<br>
the user can switch between the various self-contained<br>
desktops by using a menu provided by shell application 180.<br>
For example, in a banking environment if a user is both a loan<br>
officer and a branch manager both of the corresponding selfcontained<br>
desktops for these roles would be loaded into shell<br>
180 provided that the workstation is capable of performing<br>
both of these roles. To perform loan officer functi.ons, the<br>
user selects the loan officer desktop from shell application<br>
180. Likewise, to perform branch manager functions, the user<br>
selects the branch raanager desktop from shell application 180.<br>
U<br>
In ađdition, a default role can be provided so that the<br>
initially displayed desktop corresponds to the user's primary,<br>
or default, role.<br>
Figure 2 is -a block diagram of components includeđ inproviding<br>
self-containeđ desktops. Administrator 200 đefines<br>
a topology, user definitions, site definitions, and desktop<br>
definitions. Administrator 200 đefines a topology by<br>
providing workstation definitions 205. Norkstation<br>
definitions 205 include workstation adđresses 210 and allowed<br>
desktops 215 that define which roles, or desktops, are allowed<br>
to be used on the various workstations. For example, in a<br>
banking environment a workstation that is locateđ at a teller<br>
winđow may have special eguipment, such as a teller box, so<br>
that the workstation is capable, or allowed, to perform teller<br>
functions. Another workstation, perhaps at a đesk away from<br>
the teller area, may be incapable of performing teller<br>
functions.<br>
User definitions 220 are used to define the users of the<br>
system and the roles such users perform. User definitions 220<br>
include user data 225 and assigneđ group data 230. User data<br>
225 incluđes user identifiers and user passwords. Assigneđ<br>
group data 230 incluđes the roles a particular user is allowed<br>
to perform. For example, a branch manager may be allowed to<br>
»..<br>
perform branch manager, loan officer, and teller functions<br>
while a teller may only be alloweđ to perform teller<br>
functions.<br>
Site definitions 235 include Information about a<br>
particular site. In a banking environment, a site may be a<br>
branch office of the bank. Site definitions 235 include group<br>
desktop map 240 that provides a common desktop for users at a<br>
particular site as well as site Information 245 that provides<br>
details concerning the site.<br>
Desktop defiriitions 250 include components used to create<br>
self-contained desktops that are used by clients. Desktop<br>
đefinitions 250 include images 252 that are displayeđ on the<br>
self-contained desktop, and -application extensions 254 that<br>
provide details about client-based applications that are<br>
accessible from the self-contained desktop. Desktop<br>
đefinitions 250 also include resources, such as national<br>
language translations 256, so that users are able to select<br>
the resources, such as a language preference, that best fits<br>
their needs. Desktop đefinitions 250 also include client<br>
configurations 258 and server configurations 260. These<br>
configurations include in£ormation about the components<br>
included with a particular self-contained desktop.<br>
Administrator 200 create self-contained đesktops and<br>
publishes the self-contained đesktops on one or more servers<br>
265 that are accessible by clients. Server 265 includes<br>
persistent storage 270 and authentication function 280.<br>
Persistent storage 270 includes user data 272, topology<br>
Information 274, and self-contained đesktops 276. The user<br>
data and topology data are used to determine which selfcontained<br>
• đesktops 276 are allowed to be used by a given<br>
client using a given workstation. Server 265 provides<br>
đesktops which are authorized for particular user/workstation<br>
to client 290. The self-contained đesktops are received by<br>
the client and displayed on platform inđependent shell 295.<br>
In this manner, server 265 sends identified đesktops to client<br>
290 without regard to the particular operating system platform<br>
being used by the client.<br>
Figure 3 is a high level flowchart showing steps taken by<br>
the administrator to provide self-contained đesktops.<br>
Administrator processing commences at 300 whereupon the<br>
administrator defines users (predefined process 310, see<br>
Figure 5 for further đetails). The administrator also defines<br>
workstations that are used by users of the system (predefined<br>
process 320, see Figure 6 for further đetails).<br>
Resources that are needed by clients, such as national<br>
language translations, are set up so that the resources can be<br>
included in self-contained desktops (predefined process 330).<br>
Application extensions corresponding to applications available<br>
from a workstation are defined (predefined process 340, see<br>
Figure 7 for further đetails). Self-contained desktops are<br>
packaged including ali of the components needed to perform a<br>
particular job role (predefined process 350, see Figure 8 for<br>
processing đetails).<br>
A determination is made as to whether a new site is being<br>
added (decision 360) . If a new site is being added, decision<br>
360 branches to *yes" branch 365 whereupon a new site is<br>
defined (predefined process 370, see Figure 4 for processing<br>
đetails). On the other hand, if a new site is not being added<br>
decision 360 branches to "no" branch 375 bypassing step 370.<br>
The defined desktop is mapped to one or more sites and<br>
one or more roles (predefined process 380). In this manner, a<br>
single desktop can be used at multiple sites for multiple<br>
roles. Conversely, a đifferent desktop can be defined and<br>
used at».each site and for each role. The desktop components<br>
are packaged into a self-contained desktop and the selfcontained<br>
desktop is published to one or more servers for<br>
dissemination to the various clients (predefined process 390,<br>
see Figure 9 for processing đetails). Administrator<br>
processing ends at 395.<br>
Figure 4 is a flowchart showing administrator steps taken<br>
to set up a particular site. Processing commences at 400<br>
whereupon a unique identifier is assigned to the site (step<br>
IM<br>
405). A parent site is identified for the site (step 410).<br>
Por example, a branch office may have a regional office for a<br>
parent site. In this manner, the new site can inherit<br>
characteristics and attributes from the parent site so that<br>
the characteristics and attributes are consistent and do not<br>
have to be reentered for each site. A determination is made<br>
as to whether a parent site was identified (decision 415). If<br>
a parent site was identified, decision 415 branches to "yes"<br>
branch 418 whereupon policies and desktops for the parent are<br>
retrieved (step 420). On the other hand, if the parent site<br>
was not identified decision 415 branches to "no" branch 422<br>
vhereupon the administrator sets the policies and desktops to<br>
default values for the site (step 425).<br>
Policies that were either retrieved or set for a<br>
particular site can be modified according to the particular<br>
site's needs (step 430). In this manner, a site can have<br>
slightlv different policies from those of a parent site.<br>
Sites have one or more roles that are performed by users<br>
working at sites. In a banking environment, a branch office<br>
site may have roles such as a teller, a loan officer, and a<br>
branch manager. The first role for the site is selecteđ (step<br>
435). A determination is made as to whether the role needs to<br>
be modified (decision 440). If the role needs to be modified,<br>
decision 440 branches to Myes" branch 445 whereupon a selfcontained<br>
desktop is selecteđ for the role (step 450). On the<br>
other hand, if the desktop does not have to be modified for<br>
the role, decision 440 branches to "no" branch 455 bvpassing<br>
step 450. In this manner, the child site uses the same<br>
desktop as the peirent site for a particular role, yet the<br>
administrator has the flexibility to assign a different<br>
desktop to the child site for a given role.<br>
|S<br>
A determination is made as to whether there are more<br>
roles for the site (decision 460). If there are more roles,<br>
decision 460 branches to-' ttyes" branch 465 whereupon the next<br>
role for the site is selected (step 470)"and processing loops<br>
back to process the next role. This looping continues until<br>
there are no more roles for the site, at which point decision<br>
460 branches to "no" branch 475 whereupon the desktops and<br>
other data selected for the site are stoređ (step 480).<br>
Processing then returns at 495.<br>
Figure 5 is a flowchart showing steps taken by the<br>
administrator to define a new user. Processing commences at<br>
500 whereupon a unigue user identifier, such as a user ID, is<br>
assigneđ to the user (step 505). An initial passwords is also<br>
assigned to the user (step 510). A user name and/or<br>
description is also entered for the user (step 515). A<br>
national language preference is selected for the user (step<br>
520) .<br>
A role is selected for the user (step 525) from a list of<br>
roles that has been created by the administrator and stoređ in<br>
data store 530. A determination is made as to whether the<br>
selected role is the đefault role for the user (decision 540).<br>
If the selected role is the đefault role for the user,<br>
decision 540 branches to "yes" branch 545 whereupon the<br>
selected role is assigned as the đefault role for the user<br>
(step 550). On the other hand, if the selected role is not<br>
the đefault role, decision 540 branches to "no" branch 555<br>
bypassing step 550.<br>
A determination is made as to whether there are more<br>
roles to assign to the user (decision 560). If there are more<br>
roles to assign to the user, decision 560 branches to "yes"<br>
branch 565 which loops back to select and process the next<br>
role for the user. This looping continues until there are no<br>
more roles to assign to the user, at which point đecision 560<br>
branches to "no" branch 570 whereupon the roles assigned to<br>
the user are stored (step 580). Processing then returns at<br>
595.<br>
Figure 6 is a flowchart showing steps taken by the<br>
administrator to set up a workstation. Processing commences<br>
at 600 whereupon and identifier, such as a MAC address, if<br>
entered for workstation (step 610). A MAC address is a Media<br>
Access Control address which is a hardware address that<br>
uniquely identifies each node of a computer network. A host,<br>
or server, is assigned to the workstation (step 620). An IP<br>
address is either assigned or retrieved for the workstation<br>
(step 630) . A workstation description is also entered for the<br>
workstation (step 640). A workstation description may include<br>
a description of the workstation's capabilities, such as<br>
whether the workstation includes a bank teller drawer.<br>
The first role for the workstation is selected (step 650)<br>
from a list of roles that was created by the administrator and<br>
stored in data store 660. For example, in a banking<br>
environment, roles may include a teller, a loan officer, and a<br>
branch manager. One workstation may be capable of performing<br>
ali three roles, while another is only capable of performing<br>
one or two of the roles. Furthermore, confidential or<br>
sensitive functions may be restricted to a particular<br>
workstation even though other workstations may be physically<br>
capable of performing such functions. A determination is made<br>
as to whether there are more roles to assign to the<br>
workstation (đecision 670). If there are more roles to assign<br>
to the workstation, đecision 670 branches to "yes" branch 675<br>
whereupon the next role for the workstation is selected (step<br>
680). This looping continues until there are no more roles to<br>
assign to the workstation, at which point đecision 670<br>
li<br>
branches to "no" branch 685. The assigned roles and<br>
workstation data are stored (step 690) in a nonvolatile<br>
storage area. Processing then returns at 695.<br>
Figure 7 is -a flowchart showing steps taken by the<br>
administrator to set up applicatipn extensions. Application<br>
extensions are desktop components that provide access to<br>
application programs, such as client-based legacy<br>
applications. Processing commences at 700 whereupon an<br>
extension identifier is assigned to the particular application<br>
extension (step 705). An application description is entered<br>
describing the corresponding application (step 710) . A client<br>
class for the application extension is also entered (step<br>
715) .<br>
A determination is made as to whether the extension is<br>
provided by the system or is provided by the user (decision<br>
720) . If the exte:nsion is provided by the user, decision 720<br>
branches to user branch 725 whereupori the Java archive (JAR)<br>
filenames corresponding to the extension are entered (step<br>
730). On the other hand, if the extension is system supplied,<br>
decision 720 branches to system branch 735 bypassing step 730.<br>
A determination is made as to whether an administrator<br>
object oriented class is needed (decision 740). If an<br>
adminisirator class is needed, decision 740 branches to "yes"<br>
branch 745 whereupon the administrator class name is entered<br>
(step 750) . On the other hand, if an administrator class is<br>
not needed decision 740 branches to "no" branch 755 bypassing<br>
step 750.<br>
The application extension is createđ using the supplied<br>
information (step 760) . A determination is made as to whether<br>
there are any default properties for the application extension<br>
(decision 770). If there are default properties, decision 770<br>
18<br>
branches to "yes" branch 775 whereupon the default properties<br>
are entered for the application extension (step 780) . On the<br>
other hand if there are no default properties for the<br>
application extension, decision 770 branches to wno" branch<br>
785 bypassing step 780.<br>
The application extension, along with any default<br>
properties, is stored (.step 790) in a nonvolatile storage<br>
area. Processing then returns at 795.<br>
Figure 8 is a flowchart showing administrator steps taken<br>
to set up application references. Processing commences at 800<br>
whereupon the type of reference (i.e., the extension type)<br>
corresponding to the application reference is selected (step<br>
810). A unigue application reference identifier is assigned<br>
to the application reference (step 820). An application<br>
description is also provided for the application reference<br>
(step 830). Icon attributes, such as the icon titles and icon<br>
filenames, are also provided (step 840). Properties that are<br>
specific to the type of the application extension are also<br>
entered (step 850). The application reference is then stored<br>
in a nonvolatile storage area (step 860) and processing<br>
returns at 895.<br>
Figure 9 is a flowchart showi:ng steps taken by an<br>
administrator to create self-contained desktops. Processing<br>
commences at 900 whereupon a unique desktop identifier is<br>
assigned to the self-contained desktop (step 905). A desktop<br>
title and/or description is entered for the desktop (step<br>
910) . The screen and icon appearance is entered for the<br>
desktop (step 915). The administrator then selects images,<br>
such as icons, backgrounds, etc., to appear on the desktop<br>
(step 920). These images are selected from desktop component<br>
library 925. The desktop component library 925 includes<br>
l?<br>
backgrounds and other images 930, icons 935, application<br>
references 945, and resources 955.<br>
Application references that will be^available from the<br>
desktop are selecteđ (step 940) from application references<br>
945 included in desktop component library 925. In a banking<br>
environment, a teller's desktop can include application<br>
references to look up customer bank balances and operate the<br>
teller's cash drawer, while a loan officer's desktop can<br>
include application references that: provide access to the<br>
bank's loan approval software application. National language<br>
data, such as text and resources, are provided for each<br>
supporteđ locale (step 950') . These resources are selecteđ<br>
from resources 955 that are included in desktop component<br>
library 9.25.<br>
The desktop configuration is stored detailing the files<br>
and resources included the desktop (step 960) . A client<br>
configuration file đescribing the desktop is createđ and the<br>
desktop data is packaged (step 970) resulting in selfcontained<br>
desktop 975. The resulting self-containeđ desktop<br>
is published to client-accessible servers (step 980) by<br>
transmitting the desktops to servers 990. Processing then<br>
returns at 995.<br>
Fi^gure 10 is a flowchart showing steps taken by a server<br>
to deliver self-containeđ desktops to a client. Processing<br>
commences at 1000 whereupon the server receives a user login<br>
and workstation identifier (step 1005). The user login<br>
includes a user identifier and a user password used to<br>
authenticate the user. Roles that have been assigned to the<br>
user are retrieveđ (step 1010) from user directory data store<br>
1015. Roles that have been assigned to the workstation are<br>
retrieveđ (step 1020) from topology directory 1025.<br>
A determination is made as to whether any roles assigneđ<br>
to the user match any roles assigneđ to the workstation<br>
(decision 1030) . If there are no roles in common, decision<br>
1030 branches to *no" branch 1035 whereupon an error i s<br>
returned to the client (step 1038) and processing returns at<br>
1095. On the other hand, if there are one or more roles in<br>
common, decision 1030 branches to "yes" branch 1040 whereupon<br>
the first desktop for the selected role is retrieved from<br>
desktop/role map 1050 and the corresponđing self-contained<br>
desktop is retrieved from data store 1055. A determination is<br>
made as to whether there any more roles in common between the<br>
user and the workstation (.decision 1060) . If there are more<br>
roles in common, decision 1060 branches to "yes" branch 1070<br>
whereupon the next common role is selected (step 1080) and<br>
processing loops back to retrieve the corresponđing selfcontained<br>
desktop. This looping continues.until there are no<br>
more roles in common between the user and workstation, at<br>
which point decision 1060 branches to "no" branch 1065<br>
whereupon the retrieved desktop identifiers (i.e. those<br>
identifiers in common for both the user and the workstation)<br>
are sent to the client (step 1090). Processing then returns<br>
at 1095.<br>
Figure 11 is a screen layout of a screen used by an<br>
administrator to set up a new site. The administrator uses<br>
screen layout 1100 to define a new site. The administrator<br>
enters a unigue site identifier in text box 1150. If the new<br>
site is a child of a site that has already been created, the<br>
parent site is seslected from list box 1105. List box 1105<br>
includes a list of previously defined site identifiers. Frame<br>
1110 includes policy information that is used for the site.<br>
Policy information includes a policy name 1115, a policy value<br>
1120, and inheritance data 1125. Inheritance data 1125<br>
includes inheritance value 1130 and inheritance ancestor 1135.<br>
In the example shown, the policy name is "newbDC" and the<br>
value of the policy is inheriteđ from the parent site. The<br>
inheritance value is wallow" and the inheritance ancestor is<br>
the wroot" or uppejrmost site in the site hierarchv.<br>
Desktop frame 1140 includes information about the roles<br>
and desktops available at the site. Desktop frame 1140<br>
includes role data 1155, desktop data 1160, and inheritance<br>
data 1170. The inheritance data includes the name of the<br>
desktop that is inheriteđ 1175 and the name of the ancestor<br>
1180 from which the desktop is inheriteđ. In the example<br>
shown, the roles included at the site include the<br>
administrator, a branch manager, a guest, a loan officer, and<br>
a teller. Each of the desktops is inheriteđ from the parent<br>
site as shown by the "[Inheriteđ]" value for the desktop<br>
field. The administrator, branch manager, and- loan officer<br>
desktops are inheriteđ from "BranchA" site, while the guest<br>
and teller desktops are inheriteđ from the "root" site. In.<br>
this manner, self-contained desktops can be selected from a<br>
variety of parent sites or can be specifically configured for<br>
the child site.<br>
When the new site data has been entered, the<br>
administrator selects "Create Site" coiraiand button 1190 to<br>
create the new site. If the administrator makes mistakes and<br>
wish.es to reset the values, the administrator can select<br>
"Reset Values" command button 1195.<br>
Figure 12 is a screen layout of a screen used by an<br>
administrator to manage desktops and machines for a given<br>
site. The administrator uses screen layout 1200 to manage<br>
desktops for a given site as well as to add and manage<br>
workstations that correspond to the site. The top half of<br>
screen layout 1200 is similar to the new site layout shovm. in<br>
Figure 11. List box 1205 is used to select the parent site to<br>
assign to the site. The parent site can be 'changed to<br>
accommodate changes within the organization. Policy frame<br>
1210 include the name of the policy 1212, the policy value<br>
1214, and inheritance data 1216. The inheritance data<br>
includes inheritance value 1218 and ancestor value 1220. In<br>
the example shovm, the policy name is "newbDC" which is<br>
inherited from the "root" ancestor.<br>
Desktop frame 1225 includes role data 1230, desktop data<br>
1235, and desktop inheritance data 1240. In the banking<br>
example that is shovm in Figure 12, the roles included for the<br>
site consist of ari administrator, a branch manager, the guest,<br>
a loan officer, and a teller. The desktop to be useđ by the<br>
administrator, branch manager, guest, loan officer, and<br>
teller. Each of these roles is shown in desktop data 1235.<br>
Some of the values are inherited from a parent site while<br>
others are specified to be a particular self-contained<br>
desktop. Desktop inheritance data includes desktop<br>
inheritance 1242 and ancestor data 1244. In the example<br>
shown, the administrator, branch manager, and loan officer<br>
each inherit desktop data from "BranchA", while the guest and<br>
teller each inherit desktop data from the wroot" parent.<br>
If the administrator changes the site data and wishes to<br>
store the changed site information, the administrator selects<br>
"Subm.it Changes" command button 1245. If the administrator<br>
wishes to reset the site values, the administrator selects<br>
"Reset Values" command button 1250. If the administrator<br>
wishes to delete the site, the administrator selects "Delete<br>
Site" command button 1255.<br>
When the administrator is ready to publish the site to<br>
the servers, the administrator selects "Publish" command<br>
button 1260. If the administrator wishes to publish the site<br>
23<br>
along with any sites that are chilđren of the site, the<br>
administrator selects "Publish with Chilđren" conutianđ button<br>
1265.<br>
Child sites 'frame 1270 includes data regarđing any s.i-tes<br>
that are chilđren of the site. Child site data includes site<br>
name 1272 and site policies 1278. To create a new child site,<br>
the administrator can select "<new site>" hyperlink 1275 which<br>
will allow the administrator to identify a new child site.<br>
Machines frame 1280 includes data about workstations<br>
included at the site. Workstation data includes the<br>
workstation identifier 1282, the host name for the workstation<br>
1284, the workstation type 1286, the roles provided by the<br>
workstation 1288, the workstation's IP adđress 1290, and the<br>
workstation description 1292. To add a new machine<br>
(workstation) to the site the administrator selects *<new></new>
machine&gt;w hyperlink 1295.<br>
Figure 13 is a screen layout of a screen used by an<br>
administrator to set up a new user. Screen layout 1300<br>
includes text box 1305 for entering the new user's unique<br>
identifier. The user's full name is entered in text box 1310.<br>
In addition, the description of the user can be entered in<br>
text box 1315. For example, a user ID may be set up as a<br>
generic,..identifier such as a guest or teller that can be used<br>
by someone without having to establish a new user identifier<br>
for such infrequent or part-time users. The user iđentifiers<br>
used for such generic purposes can be further described using<br>
description text box fielđ 1315.<br>
A new initial password is entered for the user in text<br>
box 1320. This new initial password is confirmed by the<br>
administrator by reentering the password in text box 1325. A<br>
default locale is selecteđ by the administrator for the user<br>
using list box 1330. in the example shown, the locale has<br>
been selected to be a U.S. locale for a user speaking U.S.<br>
English. However, if the user's primary language was Spanish<br>
or some other Ićinguage, the appropriate .locale is selected<br>
from the list provided in list box 1330.<br>
Frame 1332 is used by the administrator to select the<br>
roles that correspond to the user. Default role 1335 includes<br>
a number of radio buttons corresponding to each of the<br>
available roles. Radio buttons are used so that the<br>
administrator only selects one default role for the user.<br>
Select column 1340 includes a number of checkboxes<br>
corresponding to each of the available roles. The<br>
administrator selects each of the checkboxes corresponding to<br>
each role that is performed by the user. Name column 1345<br>
includes the name of each of the available roles. In the<br>
example shown, the available roles include an administrator,<br>
branch manager, the guest, a loan officer, and a teller. The<br>
administrator can select one or more of these roles by<br>
selecting the corresponding checkboxes in column 1340. In<br>
adđition, the administrator can establish a new role by<br>
selecting w<new role>" hyperlink 1350.<br>
When the administrator is finisheđ entering the user data<br>
and assigning- roles to the user, the administrator selects<br>
M.<br>
"Create User" commanđ box 1355 to create and store the user<br>
data and-assigned roles. If the administrator makes mistakes<br>
and wishes to reset the values, "Reset Values" commanđ button<br>
1360 is selected.<br>
Figure 14 is a screen layout of a screen used by an<br>
administrator to set up an application that is available as a<br>
component within one or more self-containeđ đesktops. Screen<br>
layout 1400 is used to define a new application that can be<br>
included in self-contained đesktops. Application iđentifier<br>
text box 1405 is used by the administrator to enter a unigue<br>
application identifier that corresponds to the application<br>
that is being defineđ. In the example shown in Figure 14, the<br>
type of application being defineđ is a. "native" application,<br>
in other words an application wherein at least some of the<br>
application's executables reside on the client workstation.<br>
A description of the application that is being defineđ is<br>
entered in description text box 1410. Icon attributes frame<br>
1415 is used to define the attributes corresponding to the<br>
icon that will appear on the đesktop and be used by the user<br>
to select the application. Icon attributes incluđe a title<br>
that is entered in text box 1420 and an icon filename that is<br>
entered in text box 1425.<br>
Platform properties frame 1430 incluđes data for each of<br>
the supported operating system platforms from which the<br>
application can be invoked. Win32 frame 1435 incluđes data<br>
which is used to invoke and execute the application from a<br>
Microsoft Windows operating system platform. The Win32 data<br>
incluđes a path and filename iđentifying the executable form<br>
of the application in the Win32 environment. The path and<br>
filename 'is entered in text box 1440. Any parameters that are<br>
needed for the application are supplied in parameters text box<br>
1445. A working directory that corresponds to the<br>
application, if needed, is entered in text box 1455.<br>
Platform properties frame 1430 also incluđes data for the<br>
OS/2 operating system platform, the fields for which are<br>
located in frame 1460. The OS/2 fields correspond to the<br>
Win32 fields described above. These incluđe path and filename<br>
text box 1465, parameters text box 1470, and working' directory<br>
text box 1475. Likewise, a Linux set of fields is provided in<br>
frame 1480 which incluđes path and filename text box 1482,<br>
parameters text box 1484, and working directory text box 1486.<br>
When the application information has been entered by the<br>
administrator, the administrator can create the application by<br>
selecting "Create Application" command button 1490. If the<br>
administrator makes mistakes, a new application values can be<br>
reset by selecting "Reset Values" command button 1495.<br>
Figure 15 is a screen layout of a screen useđ by an<br>
administrator to set up a self-contained desktop. Screen<br>
layout 1500 includes various fields used to define the<br>
appearance and fuiictionality of a self-contained desktop. The<br>
desktop identifier, which was previously defined, is displayed<br>
on the screen. In the example shovm, the desktop identifier<br>
is "bda-administrator." The title for the self-contained<br>
desktop is entered by the administrator in text box 1505. In<br>
the example shown, the title is "Administrator." A<br>
description for the self-contained desktop is entered in text<br>
box 1510. In the example shown, the description entered is<br>
"Desktop for BDA Admins."<br>
A launch mode for the self-contained desktop is selected<br>
by the administrator using list box 1515. The launch mode<br>
indicates the number of mouse clicks needed to activate a<br>
component from the desktop. In the example shovm, the launch<br>
mode selected is tt2" (i.e., a double-click). Icon attributes<br>
are entered in frame 1520. Maximum allowable and displayable<br>
icon title lengths are entered by the administrator in the<br>
appropriate text boxes.<br>
Background appearance information is entered by the<br>
administrator in frame 1525. The color, image file, and image<br>
display mode are provided by the administrator for the<br>
background of the self-contained desktop. For example,<br>
desktop background data can include the name and logo of the<br>
organization. Icon appearance information is entered by the<br>
administrator in frame 1530. Icon appearance đata includes<br>
the text color of the icon, the font that is used with the<br>
icon, the font siže that is used with the icon, the font style<br>
that is used to the icon, the icon flow, the origination point<br>
of the icon flow, and the text position for the icon text.<br>
When the administrator has completeđ setting up the selfcontained<br>
đesktop, the administrator selects "Submit Changes"<br>
command button 1540 to save the đesktop settings. If the<br>
administrator makes mistakes or wishes to reset the values,<br>
the administrator selects "Reset Values" command button 1545.<br>
If the administrator wish.es to delete the self-contained<br>
đesktop definition, the administrator selects "Delete Đesktop"<br>
command button 1550.<br>
Hyperlink 1560 is used to add, modify, or delete<br>
references that are available from the self-contained đesktop.<br>
The references that are available include applications 1570,<br>
folders 1580, and toolbars 1590. In the example shovm, the<br>
applications that had been included consist of "acroread,"<br>
"calculator," and wbrowser." The folders that are included<br>
consist of an applications folder, and two administrator<br>
folders. One toolbar, the Admin Toolbar, is also included.<br>
Figure 16 is a screen layout of a screen used by an<br>
administrator to manage workstations. Screen layout 1600 is<br>
used by». the administrator to manage the workstations, or<br>
computer systems, used throughout the network. Data<br>
maintained for each of the workstations includes the<br>
workstation identifier which is listed in column 1610, the<br>
site to which the workstation belongs which is listed in<br>
column 1620, the host (or server) assigned to the workstation<br>
which is listed in column 1630, the types of functions<br>
performed by the workstation which are listed in column 1640,<br>
the roles that the workstation is allowed to perform which are<br>
listed in column 1650, the workstation's IP address which is<br>
n<br>
listed in column 1660, and a description for the workstation<br>
which is listed in column 1670.<br>
The identifiers shown in column 1610 are unique for each<br>
workstation. In the example shown in Figure 16, the<br>
identifiers are the MAC addresses that correspond to the<br>
workstations. The sites shown in Figure 16 are either the<br>
*root" site, branch &gt;XA", or branch WB." These sites may<br>
represent physical or logical regioris within the organization.<br>
The host name is the name of the server used by the<br>
workstation. The types of functions performed by the<br>
workstation inelude administration functions, server<br>
functions, and client functions. Types ending with "A" are<br>
useđ for administration functions, types ending with "S" are<br>
useđ for server functions, and types ending with "C" are used<br>
for client functions. As can be seen in Figure 16, some<br>
workstations perform multiple types of functions. For<br>
example, the first workstation listed serves both<br>
administrator and server functions. Roles indicate the<br>
functions allowed to be performed on the workstation. Roles<br>
typically relate to client functions, so therefore<br>
workstations that do not have a client type do not have roles<br>
assigned. Workstations that have assigned roles often have<br>
multiple roles. For example, the third workstation listed has<br>
four roies that are allowed to be performed on the workstation<br>
(teller, loan-officer, branch manager, and guest). However,<br>
the fourth and fifth workstation shown only have one role that<br>
is allowed to be performed on each workstation. The IP<br>
address is the network address that is assigned to the<br>
workstation. In some environments the IP address is a static<br>
address, while in other environments the IP address 'is<br>
dynamically assigned. The description of each workstation is<br>
•25)<br>
optional, yet helps the administrator better identify<br>
particular workstations and the roles such workstations play.<br>
Figure 17 is a flowchart show.ing steps taken to<br>
distribute self-c.ontained desktops to servers. Administrator<br>
desktop distribution processing commences at 1700 whereupon<br>
the first desktop for distribution is selected (step 1705) . A<br>
reguest is created with the desktop name and a unique<br>
signature, such as a CRC value (step 1710). The created<br>
desktop reguest is sent to one or more servers (step 1715) . A<br>
determination is made as to whether there are more desktops to<br>
distribute (decision 1720). If there are more desktops to<br>
distribute, decision 1720 branches to wyes" branch 1722<br>
whereupon processing selects the next desktop for distribution<br>
(step 1725) and loops back to create the reguest and send the<br>
reguest to the servers. This looping continues until there<br>
are no more desktops to distribute, at whićh point decision<br>
1720 branches to "no" branch 1728.<br>
Server responses resulting from the previously sent<br>
desktop reguest are received by the administrator (step 1730) .<br>
A determination is made based upon the response as to whether<br>
the desktop already exists at the server (decision 1735). If<br>
the desktop does not yet exist at the server, decision 1735<br>
branches'to "no" branch 1738 whereupon the identified desktop<br>
is sent to the server in a data stream (step 1740). On the<br>
other hand, if the desktop already exists at the server<br>
decision 1735 branches to "yes" branch 1742 bypassing step<br>
1740.<br>
A determination is made as to whether there are more<br>
responses to receive from servers regarding the desktop<br>
reguest (decision 1745). I f there are more responses,<br>
decision 1745 branches to "yes" branch 1746 to loop back and<br>
process the responses. This looping continues until there are<br>
no more responses to process, at which time decision 1745<br>
branches to "no" branch 1748 and administrator desktop<br>
distribution processing ends at 1750.<br>
Server desktop collection processing commences at 11,55<br>
whereupon the server receives the desktop distribution request<br>
sent by the administrator (step 1760). The unigue identifier<br>
for the desktop included in the administrator's request is<br>
compared with desktop data 1768 that is currently on hand at<br>
the server (step 1765). A determination is made based upon<br>
the comparison as to whether the desktop is needed by the<br>
server (decision 1770) . If the desktop is not needed (i.e.<br>
the desktop already exists at the server) decision 1770<br>
branches to "no" branch 1772 whereupon a message is seht to<br>
the administrator indicating that the server already has the<br>
desktop (step 1775) and server processing ends at 1795.<br>
On the other hand, if the server does not yet have the<br>
desktop decision 1770 branches to "yes" branch 1778 whereupon<br>
the server request the' desktop (step 1780). The server<br>
receives the desktop data stream.in response to the reguest<br>
(step 1785). The server then creates a self-containeđ desktop<br>
file from the, received data stream and stores the desktop file<br>
in desktop data storage area 1768 (step 1790). Server desktop<br>
collection processing then ends at 1798.<br>
M.<br>
Figure 18 is a flowchart showing steps taken to<br>
distribute self-contained desktops from a server to a client.<br>
Client desktop reception commences at 1800 whereupon the<br>
client sends a desktop list request to a server (step 1805).<br>
The desktop list request includes the client's machine<br>
(workstation) identifier and the client's user identifier.<br>
Server desktop distribution processing commences at 1840<br>
whereupon the server receives the desktop list reguest from<br>
the client (step 1845). The server looks up the roles that<br>
have been assigneđ to the user (step 1850) by searching user<br>
roles data store 1852. The server also looks up the roles<br>
that have been assigneđ to the workstation being used by the<br>
user (step 1855) by searching machine roles data store 1858.<br>
The server retrieves desktop information based upon the<br>
intersection, or overlap, between the user roles and the<br>
machine roles (step 1860) and locates the desktops that<br>
correspond to the overlapping roles in desktop data store<br>
1862. The desktop information that is retrieveđ includes a<br>
desktop identifier and a desktop signature, such as a CRC,<br>
that is used to uniquely identify the desktop. A user may<br>
have a default role and a default desktop that corresponds<br>
that role. If the user has a default role, the server<br>
determines the default role (step 1865).<br>
The server creates a response string (step 1870) of valid<br>
roles, desktop signatures, a default desktop identifier (if<br>
applicable), and a default role (if applicable). The server<br>
then returns the response string to the client (step 1875).<br>
The client receives the desktop list that includes the.<br>
roles that have been assigneđ to both the user and the<br>
workstation along with any default role and default desktop<br>
informaiion from the server (step 1810). The client compares<br>
the desktops includeđ in the desktop list with desktops that<br>
have already been cached on the client workstation (step<br>
1815). This is done so that the client only needs to request<br>
those desktops that have not previously been transmitted to<br>
the client workstation and cached in the workstations volatile<br>
or nonvolatile storage areas.<br>
The client determines whether additional components, or<br>
desktops, are needed from the server by identifying such<br>
desktops or components that have not yet been cached on the<br>
client workstation (decision 1820). If the client determines<br>
that no additional desktop components are needed, decision<br>
1820 branches to "no" branch 1832 (bypassing the steps used to<br>
reguest and retrieve additional desktop information) and<br>
client processing enđs at 1835.<br>
On the other hand, if the client heeds additional<br>
components or desktops, decision 1820 branches to "yes" branch<br>
1822 whereupon the needed desktops are reguested from the<br>
server (step 1825). This request is received by the server at<br>
server step 1885. The server responds by retrieving the<br>
request desktop information from desktop data store 1862 and<br>
returning it to the client workstation (step 1890) . The<br>
server desktop distribution processing then ends at 1895.<br>
Returning to client processing, the client receives and<br>
caches the requested desktop information at step 1830 and<br>
client desktop reception processing ends at 1835.<br>
Figure 19 is a flovrchart showing steps taken to create<br>
custom application extensions. Gustom application extensions<br>
allow a third party to extend a preexisting object oriented<br>
class to modify the behavior or attributes of a server class<br>
object to better serve the needs of a particular organization.<br>
Custom application extension creation processing commences at<br>
1900 whereupon the client object oriented class is provided<br>
that implements a particular component interface (step 1910).<br>
A determination is made as to whether to extend the server<br>
abstract class (decision 1920). If the abstract class is not<br>
being extended, decision 1920 branches to "no" branch 1925<br>
whereupon the default server component is used for the<br>
component interface (step 1930). On the other hand, if the<br>
abstract class is being extended, decision 1920 branches to<br>
"yes" branch 1935 whereupon the server class that extends the<br>
server componen.t abstract class is provided (step 1940) .<br>
A determination is made as to whether additional<br>
resources are neeđed for the custom application extensions.--<br>
(decision 1950) . If additional resources are neeđed, decision<br>
1950 branches to "yes" branch 1955 whereupon the additional<br>
resources used by the application extension are provided (step<br>
1960). The additional resources may include images, property<br>
files, and other class files used by the application<br>
extension. On the other hand, if additional resources are no t<br>
neeđed decision 1950 branches to "no" branch 1965 bypassing<br>
step 1960.<br>
The client classes, server classes, and any additional<br>
resources are packaged in Java archive (JAR) files (step<br>
1970). The packaged custom extensions are stored in custom<br>
extensions library 1980. The creation of custom application<br>
extension process ends at 1995.<br>
Figure 20 is a flowchart showing an application extension<br>
lifecycle. The application extension lifecycle begins at step<br>
2000. During the first phase of the application extension<br>
lifecycle, the application extension uses a no-arg constructor<br>
(.step 2025) . The no-arg constructor is used to create the<br>
applicaiion extension component by loading its Java<br>
implementation class and invoking a no-arg constructor. At<br>
this point, the application extension component has no<br>
reference to the client desktop and cannot interact with the<br>
desktop environment. During this phase, instance variables<br>
and default settings are initialized.<br>
During the next phase of the application extension<br>
lifecvcle, the application extension initializes (step 2050).<br>
During the initialization phase, the initialized method<br>
corresponđing to the application extension is defineđ in the<br>
component interface. References to component configuration<br>
items, initial locale information, and desktop references are<br>
also provided. Desktop references are pf'eferably saved as<br>
instance variables during this phase.<br>
During the final phase of the application extension<br>
lifecycle, the start method corresponđing to the application<br>
extension is invoked (step 2075). The start method is calleđ<br>
by the desktop. For example the start method may be calleđ<br>
when the icon corresponđing to the application extension is<br>
selecteđ by a user. During this phase, the application<br>
extension may use desktop references as well as references to<br>
other desktop components. In addition the application<br>
extension may at this time start threads and perform I/O<br>
operations.<br>
Figure 21A is a block điagram showing components and<br>
resources being distributed from an administrator to multiple<br>
clients. Administrator 2100 publishes components and resource<br>
libraries 2105 that had been packaged into various desktop<br>
packages 2110 by transmitting these packages to various<br>
servers.<br>
In the example shown in Figure 21A, there are three<br>
servers^that receive desktop packages from the administrator.<br>
The servers include server 2120, server 2140, and server 2160.<br>
Each of the servers includes a nonvolatile storage area for<br>
storing desktop packages receive from the administrator.<br>
Server 2120 uses nonvolatile storage area 2125 for storing<br>
desktop packages, server 2140 uses nonvolatile storage area<br>
2145, and server 2160 uses nonvolatile storage area -2165. The<br>
desktop packages are distributed from the administrator to the<br>
servers in the process described in Figure 17. The servers<br>
are used to provide desktop packages to various clients.<br>
In the example shown in Figure 21A, there are two clients<br>
that receive desktop packages from each of the servers.<br>
Clients 2130 and 2135 receive desktops from server 2120,<br>
clients 2150 and 2155 receive desktops from server 2140, and<br>
clients 2170 and 2175 receive desktops from server 2160. ' The<br>
desktops are distributed from the servers to clients using the<br>
process described in Figure 18. In this manner, components<br>
and resources used in the various self-contained desktops are<br>
distributed from an administrator throughout the system to<br>
servers and eventually to clients.<br>
Figure 21B is a block diagram showing components and<br>
resources being recovered by an administrator from servers<br>
following a đata loss by the administrator. When a disaster<br>
event, such as a computer crash, fire, or floođ occurs, the<br>
administrator may be left without the components and resources<br>
used to create the various self-contained desktops. In order<br>
to recover these files, administrator 2100 recjuests desktop<br>
packages, includirig the components that comprise the desktop<br>
packages, from the various servers. Using the topography<br>
described in Figure 21A, the administrator requests packages<br>
from servers 2120, 2140, and 2160. The servers retrieve selfcontained<br>
desktop packages that include desktop components<br>
from storage areas 2125, 2145, and 2165 respectively. The<br>
desktop-information is transmitted from the various servers<br>
back to the administrator. The administrator stores the<br>
received self-contained desktop packages in restoređ package<br>
library 2180. The components and resources that are incluđed<br>
in the self-contained desktops are extracteđ from the desktop<br>
files and stored in restoređ components and resource libraries<br>
2190. In this manner, the administrator is able to 'recover<br>
and restore the components and resources that hađ previously<br>
been published to the various servers. This recovery is<br>
performed without having to have the administrator make<br>
separate backup copies of the components and resources.<br>
Because components and resources include unique identifiers,<br>
multiple versions, or levels, of components and resources are<br>
also able to be recovered. A flowchart showing the steps<br>
taken by the administrator to recover desktop data is shown in<br>
Figure 22.<br>
Figure 22 is a flowchart showing steps taken by an<br>
administrator in distributing self-contained desktops and<br>
subsequently recovering self-contained desktops following a<br>
disaster event. Administrator processing commences at 2200<br>
whereupon the administrator creates components and resources<br>
(step 2205) that will be used in self-contained desktops.<br>
These components and resources are stored in a library that is<br>
stored in nonvolatile storage area 2210.<br>
The components and resources are packaged (step 2215)<br>
into various self-contained desktops for use by various users<br>
based upon the users' roles. The self-contained desktops are<br>
stored in self-contained desktop library 2225. The selfcontained<br>
desktops are distributed (step 2220) to various<br>
servers. Administrator distribution processing ends at 2230.<br>
Further detail regarding the distribution of self-contained<br>
desktops can be founđ in Figure 17.<br>
*L
Server reception of self-contained desktops commences at<br>
2235 whereupon the server receives the self-contained desktop<br>
packages (step 2240) and stores the received packages in<br>
nonvolatile storage area 2245. The server then distributes<br>
self-contained desktops to clients has needed (step 2250).<br>
Further detail regarding the distribution of self-contained<br>
desktops to clients can be found in Figure 18.<br>
At some point, a disaster event occurs destroying<br>
packages, resources, and components from the computer system<br>
and storage devices use by the administrator (step 2255). The<br>
self-contained desktop information is then recovered by the<br>
administrator using the recovery process commencing at step<br>
2260. The administrator identifies unigue packages that have<br>
been destroyed and are no longer stored on the administrator's<br>
computer system (step 2265). The identified packages are<br>
reguested from the various servers (step 2270).<br>
The servers receive desktop package requests from the<br>
administrator (step 2275). The reguested desktop packages are<br>
retrieve from the servef's nonvolatile storage area 2245 and<br>
transmitteđ to the administrator's computer system (step 2280)<br>
and server recovery processing ends at 2295.<br>
The administrator computer systems receives the self-<br>
'contained desktop packages sent by the servers and stores the<br>
received desktop packages in package library 2225 (step 2285).<br>
The self-contained desktop packages are unpacked and the<br>
components and resources that are incluđed in self-contained<br>
desktop packages are used to repopulate components and<br>
resource libraries 2210 (step 2290). At this point, ali<br>
packages, components, and resources that were previously<br>
distributed by the administrator have been recovered and<br>
stored in the appropriate libraries. Administrator recovery<br>
processing then erids at 2298.<br>
Figure 23 is a flowchart showing steps taken by a client<br>
to receive and display desktops based upon the client's role<br>
(or roles) in the organization. Processing commences at 2300<br>
whereupon the client machine receives the first desktop from<br>
server (step 2305) . The received desktop is stored on<br>
client's local storage 2315, either in a volatile or a<br>
nonvolatile storage area (step 2310).<br>
A determination is made as to whether the received<br>
desktop is the default desktop for the client (decision 2320).<br>
I f the receive desktop is the de.fault desktop, decision 2320<br>
branches to "yes" branch 2325 whereupon ćhe received desktop<br>
is displayeđ on the client's display device (step 2330). ' On<br>
the other hanđ, if the received desktop is not the default<br>
desktop, decision 2320 branches to "no" branch 2335 bypassing<br>
step 2330.<br>
A determination is made as to whether there are more<br>
desktops for the client machine to receive from the server<br>
(decision 2340). If there are more desktops to receive,<br>
decision 2340 branches to '"yes" branch 2345 whereupon<br>
processing loops back to receive the next desktop (step 2350)<br>
and determine whether the next desktop is the default desktop.<br>
This looping continues until ali needed desktops have been<br>
received from the server, at which point decision 2340<br>
branches to "no" branch 2355.<br>
A determination is made as to whether more than one<br>
desktop is accessible by the client (decision 2380). If more<br>
than one desktop is accessible, decision 2380 branches to<br>
"yes" branch 2385 whereupon the available desktop descriptions<br>
are inserted as items within a pop-up šelection window that is<br>
accessible by the client (step 2390). For example, the user<br>
*-•<br>
could "right" click in the desktop area using appointing<br>
device, such as a mouse, which would cause the pop-up menu to<br>
be displayed. The user could then select the desired desktop<br>
from the list provided in the pop-up menu (see Figure 27 for<br>
an example desktop screen and pop-up menu). For example, if a<br>
branch manager also has an assigned role of a loan officer,<br>
the branch manager can select the loan officer desktop from<br>
the pop-up menu. After selecting the loan officer desktop,<br>
the desktop components' used for loan officer functions would<br>
be displayed and be accessible from the desktop area. On the<br>
other hand, if there are no more than one desktop accessible<br>
by the client, decision 2380 branches to "no" branch 2392<br>
bypassing step 2390. Display desktop processing then ends at<br>
2395.<br>
Figure 24 is a flowchart showing steps taken by a server<br>
to provide desktop Information to a client based on the user's<br>
role and the workstation's role. Processing commences at 2400<br>
whereupon the server receives a desktop request (step 2405)<br>
from client 2410. The request includes the client's user ID,<br>
password, and the client workstation's MAC address.<br>
The server looks up the client's MAC address {step 2415)<br>
from workstation table 2420 that includes the roles that are<br>
allowed to be performed on various workstations. In the<br>
example shown, the workstation with a MAC address of "123" is<br>
allowed to perform both teller and loan officer functions,<br>
while the workstation with a MAC address of "456" is only<br>
allowed to perform branch manager functions.<br>
A determination is made as to whether the client's MAC<br>
address was found in the workstation table (decision 2425) .<br>
If the MAC address was not found, decision 2425 branches to<br>
"no" branch 2428 whereupon a determination is made as to<br>
whether~ client vrorkstation registration is required by the<br>
system (decision 2430). If workstation registration is<br>
reguiređ, decision 2430 branches to "yes" branch 2430<br>
whereupon an error is returned to the client (step 2435)<br>
inđicating that the client's workstation is not registered and<br>
server processing ends at 2440. On the other hand, if<br>
workstation registration is not required decision 2430<br>
branches to "no" branch 2442 and processing continues.<br>
Returning to decision 2425, if the client's MAC address was<br>
found in the workstation table, đecision 2425 branches to<br>
"yes" branch 2445 and processing continues.<br>
The first desktop that has been assigned to the user's<br>
iđentifier (user ID) is retrieved (step 2450) from user<br>
desktop table 2455. In the example shown, the user ID "Able"<br>
has been assigneđ to the "teller" role, while the user ID<br>
"Jones" has been assigneđ to the "teller," "loan1officer," and<br>
Mbranch manager" roles. A determination is made as to whether<br>
the retrieved desktop assigneđ to the user is allowed to be<br>
used on the workstation that is being useđ by the user<br>
(đecision 2460). I f the desktop is allowed to be used to the<br>
workstation, đecision 2460 branches to "yes" branch 2465<br>
whereupon the desktop is sent to the client (step 2470). On<br>
the other hand, if the retrieved desktop is not allowed to be<br>
used on the workstation, đecision 2460 branches to "no" branch<br>
2472 bypassing step 2470.<br>
A determination is made as to whether there are more<br>
roles, or desktops, that have been assigneđ to the user<br>
(đecision 2475). If there are more roles that have been<br>
assigneđ to the user, đecision 2475 branches to "yes" branch<br>
2480 whereupon the next desktop assigneđ to the user is<br>
selected (step 2485) and processing loops back to determine<br>
whether the next desktop should be set to client. This<br>
looping continues until ali desktops assigneđ to the user have<br>
been processed, at which point đecision 2475 branches to "no"<br>
branch 2490 and server processing enđs at 2495.<br>
Figure 25 is a block diagram showing processing performed<br>
by a server and interaction between the server, clients, and<br>
administrator. Server 2500 performs role identifica'tion<br>
function 2570 by receiving role asšignments from administrator<br>
2575. Role asšignments included roles that have been assigneđ<br>
to the user as well as roles that have been assigneđ to<br>
t* i<br>
workstations located throughout the rietwork. VJorkstation<br>
roles are stoređ in workstation role data store 2560. The<br>
user roles are stoređ in user role data store 2555.<br>
Server 2500 also performs desktop collection processing<br>
2580 by receiving desktop information from administrator 2575.<br>
The desktop information is stoređ in desktop definition data<br>
store 2590. The desktop information includes self-contained<br>
desktops that, in turn, included desktop components and<br>
resources for use by client 2525.<br>
Server 2500 receives authentication information from<br>
client 2525, such as a user ID and password, which is used to<br>
authenticate the client. Server 2500 performs authentication<br>
processing 2510 by checking the client's authentication<br>
information with authentication data that is located in<br>
authentication data store 2520. Once the client has been<br>
authenticated, the client receives access to client's data<br>
storage area 2540 which is stoređ on server 2500. The server<br>
provides access to the client's data storage by performing<br>
home directory access process 2530. In this manner, a user<br>
can access his or her data regardless of which workstation he<br>
or she is using.<br>
Server 2500 performs desktop distribution process 2550 to<br>
determine which self-contained desktops to send to client<br>
2525. Desktop distribution process 2550 is performed by<br>
comparing user roles stoređ in user role data store 2555 with<br>
vorkstation roles stoređ in workstation role data store 2560.<br>
Desktops, or roles, that are assigned to both the user and the<br>
workstation are distributed to the client. Server 2500<br>
retrieves the desktop information from desktop data 'store 2590<br>
and transmits the desktop information to client 2525.<br>
Figure 26 is a flowchart showing steps taken by a client<br>
in initializing and displaying self-containeđ desktops.<br>
Client 2600 performs authentication reguest, home directory<br>
reguest, and password upđates by sending the corresponding<br>
information to the server. Client 2600 uses an underlying<br>
operating system platform 2610 to perform native operations.<br>
JSLLIB 2680 is a native library that includes native commands<br>
and programs used to perform native operations.<br>
Shell 2605 is a Java-based application that is adapted to<br>
run on any of the operating system platforms used in the<br>
system (e.g., Windows XF™, OS/2™, or Linux™). The shell makes<br>
a determination as to whether the client logih is performed<br>
remotely through a server or locally (decision 2620). If the<br>
login is performed remotely, decision 2620 branches to "yes"<br>
branch 2622 whereupon the client receives desktops from the<br>
server (step 2625). In one embođiment, the desktops are<br>
received by first receiving a list of desktops and then<br>
retrieving individual desktops from the list.<br>
The list, or map, of desktops is cached to local storage<br>
locateđ on the client machine (step 2630). The received<br>
desktops are also cached to local storage (step 2635).<br>
Returning to decision 2620, if the desktops are not retrieved<br>
remotely, decision 2620 branches to "no" branch 2638 bypassing<br>
steps 2625, 2630, and 2635.<br>
The desktops that have been assigned to both the user and<br>
the workstation are retrieved from local storage (step 2640).<br>
Local storage is used to store user desktop map 2660 and<br>
desktops 2670. Desktops are self-containeđ packages that<br>
include desktop components and resources needed to dlsplay and<br>
execute the desktop. The retrieved desktop information is<br>
used to create desktop objects (step 2645). Desktop class<br>
loađer 2650 is used to create the desktop objects. Resources,<br>
such as national language translations, are loađeđ from the<br>
đesktop Information (step 2655). Desktop class loađer 2650 is<br>
also used to load the needeđ resources.<br>
At this point, the-desktops assigned to the user in „ •<br>
workstation have been retrieved and mađe available to the user<br>
within shell 2605. Desktop objects and resources have been<br>
extracted from the self-containeđ desktops and have been made<br>
available to the user through shell 2605.<br>
Figure 27 is a screen layout of a sample đesktop<br>
displaved on a client workstation along with a pop-up menu of<br>
other self-contained desktops available to the clierit.<br>
Desktop screen layout 2700 includes a number of objects 2750.<br>
Objects 2750 include đesktop components that are accessible<br>
from the đesktop. Each đesktop component corresponđs to a<br>
graphical image, such as an icon, which is selectable by the<br>
user using a pointing device such as a mouse.<br>
Pop-up menu 2710 includes two items allowing the user to<br>
either change the đesktop or display the shell version.<br>
Selecting the "Change Desktop" item causes the display of<br>
đesktop selection menu 2720. The user selects the đesktop<br>
that is đesired by placing a check mark in the box beside the<br>
desired đesktop. In the example shovm, the "administrator"<br>
đesktop-is being displayed on the client display as evidenced<br>
by the check mark shown in đesktop selection menu 2720. If<br>
the user wishes to change the đesktop, for example to the<br>
branch manager đesktop, the user simply uses a pointing<br>
device, such as a mouse, and places a check mark in the box<br>
next to the "branch manager" menu item.<br>
Components 2750 may change depending upon the đesktop<br>
that has been selected. For example, the "Branch Desktop<br>
Administrator" đesktop component is đisplayed because the<br>
"Administrator" desktop has been selected. However, if<br>
another desktop, such as the "Teller" desktop, is selected,<br>
the "Branch Desktop Administrator" vri 11 no longer appear and<br>
will not be accessible from the display. ' In this manner,<br>
components for a selected role are displayed and accessible,<br>
while components useđ by a different role are not displayed<br>
and are not accessible. Moreover, components that are used by<br>
multiple roles are each available from the various desktops<br>
that correspond to the roles.<br>
Figure 28A is a hierarchy chart of directories used by<br>
the client shell in displaying and managing desktops. Shell<br>
home directory 2800 includes a number of subdirectories used<br>
by the client for performing desktop functions. In one<br>
embodiment, the shell home directory and its subdirectories<br>
are stored on a server accessible by the client. In another<br>
embodiment, the shell home directory and its subdirectories<br>
are stored on a nonvolatile storage device local to the client<br>
machine. Native library 2805 is a subdirectory used to store<br>
programs used to interface with the client's operating system<br>
platform. In one embodiment, native library information is<br>
stored in Java archive (JAR) files. Properties subdirectory<br>
2810 is a subdirectory used to store properties that are used.<br>
by the shell program. These properties can include display<br>
attributes and other configuration items used by the shell<br>
program.<br>
Desktop subdirectory 2815 is the directory in which selfcontained<br>
desktop files are stored. In one embodiment, selfcontained<br>
desktop files are packaged into Java archive (JAR)<br>
files. In this manner, ali components and resources used by<br>
particular desktop are packaged and included in a selfcontained<br>
desktop JAR file. Log subdirectory 2820 is used to<br>
store client-based logs that detail the actions taken by the<br>
client. wConf" subđirectory 2825 is used to store<br>
initialization information used by the shell application.<br>
"Bin" subdirectory 2830 is used to store executabl.es, such as<br>
program files, that are used to launch the shell application.<br>
Figure 28B is a hierarchy chart of sections includeđ with<br>
the shell configuration file. The shell configuration file<br>
includes number of sections. Each of these sections includes<br>
information about &gt;a particular aspect of the shell. In one<br>
embodiment, the shell configuration file is an XML file that<br>
includes a number of sections. The sections include locales<br>
section 2840 that includes information about the locale, such<br>
as national language translations, used by the shell<br>
application. Component section 2845 includes information<br>
about the components that are includeđ with the self-contained<br>
desktop. Components include applications and other programs<br>
that are accessible from the desktop when the user selects an<br>
appropriate icon or other command. Folđers section 2850<br>
includes information about the various folders that are<br>
accessible from the desktop. Toolbars section 2855 includes<br>
information about the various toolbars that are displayed and<br>
accessible from the desktop. Desktop section 2860 includes<br>
information about the desktop, such as.appearance data and<br>
policy information.<br>
Figure 28C is a hierarchy chart of objects includeđ in<br>
the self-contained desktop file. In. one embodiment, the selfcontained<br>
desktop is a Java archive (JAR) file. Selfcontained<br>
desktop file 2865 includes number of components.<br>
The components include manifest 2870 which details the objects<br>
includeđ in the self-contained desktop file. The components<br>
also include a Shell Document Type Definition (DTD) object<br>
2875. The Shell DTD object states what kinds of attributes<br>
are used to describe content in the Shell XML document, where<br>
each tag is allowed, and which tags can appear within other<br>
tags. Classes objects 2880 include the Java classes that are<br>
used by the desktop. Resources 2885 include resource<br>
Information, such as national language translation<br>
information, that is used by the desktop. JAR objects 2890<br>
include adđitional objects neeđed by the desktop that are<br>
packaged into further JAR files. XML object 2895 includes the<br>
XML document that is used to descri.be the self-contained<br>
desktop.<br>
Figure 29 is a flowchart showing steps taken to<br>
initialize the client's workstation to use self-contained<br>
desktops. Processing commences at 2900 whereupon user 2920 is<br>
prompted for a user ID and password (step 2910). The user ID<br>
and password are received from the user (step 2925). When<br>
authenticated, the virtual machine, such as a Java virtual<br>
machine (JVM), is loaded on the client operating system<br>
platform (step 2930) by JSL. The virtual machine is designed<br>
to execute platform-neutral code, such as Java applications.<br>
In this manner, the same desktops can be written in a platform<br>
independent language, such as Java, and executed on a variety<br>
of platforms that have implemented the neeđed virtual machine.<br>
A Java-based lockdown shell is invoked (step 2940) to<br>
provide a desktop environment and prevent the user from<br>
j*.-<br>
accessing the underlying operating system being used by the<br>
client machine. Desktops that are assigned to both the<br>
workstation and the user are requested from a server (step<br>
2945). Server 2950 receives reguests and responds by sending<br>
self-contained desktops to the client. The client receives a<br>
response from the server (step 2955) . The response may be an<br>
error or a list of desktops.<br>
A determination is made as to whether an error was<br>
received from the server (đecision 2960). If an error was<br>
received, decision 2960 branches to "yes" branch 2962<br>
whereupon an error message is displayed on the client's<br>
display device (step 2965) and processing ends at 2995. On<br>
the other hand, if an error was not receive, decision 2960<br>
branches to "no" branch 2968 whereupon a determination is' made<br>
as to whether there are any desktops to display on the<br>
client's display device (decision 2970). If there are no<br>
desktops display on the client's display device, decision 2970<br>
branches to "yes" branch 2972, the user is informed that there<br>
are no desktops to displayed (step 2975), and processing ends<br>
at 2995. On the other hand, if there are desktops assigned to<br>
the user and the workstatipn, decision 2970 branches to "no"<br>
branch 2978 whereupon the desktops are displayed on the<br>
client's display device (predefined process 2980) and<br>
processing ends at 2995.<br>
Figure 30 is a flowchart showing steps taken đuring<br>
client initialization. Processing commences at 3000 whereupon<br>
native login code is executed (step 3005). Login data is<br>
gathered from the user and sent to the server for processing<br>
(step 3010). The server sends a response back to the client<br>
which is received at step 3015.<br>
A determination is made as to whether the user was<br>
authenticated .(decision 3020) . If the user vas not<br>
authenticated, decision 3020 branches to "no" branch 3025<br>
whereupon processing ends at 3030. On the other hand, if the<br>
user was authenticated, decision 3020 branches to "yes" branch<br>
3035 to continue initialization.<br>
The virtual machine application, such as a Java virtual<br>
machine, is invoked on the client workstation (step -3040). A<br>
lockdown process is launched in the Java environment in order<br>
to lock the shell and prevent the user from using the<br>
underlying operating system without using the shell<br>
environment (step 3045). The server is guerieđ for the<br>
đesktops have been assigneđ to the user/workstation (step<br>
3050). The client receives a list of available đesktops and<br>
compares the listed desktop Information with desktop data that<br>
has already been cached on the client workstation (step 3"060) .<br>
Đesktops that are included in list but not yet cached on the<br>
client workstation are retrieve from the server and cached on<br>
the client workstation (step 3070). The received đesktops are<br>
stored in client accessible cache 3075. An initial, or<br>
default, desktop is selected from the list of available<br>
đesktops (step 3080) . The components that comprise the<br>
default desktop are then d.isplayed on the client display<br>
device with other available đesktops made available to the<br>
user through a pop-up window (predefined process 3090, see<br>
Figure 27 for example of a desktop display). Client<br>
initialization processing then ends at 3095.<br>
Figure 31 is a flowchart showing steps taken during<br>
native operating system login. Native operating system login<br>
processing commences at 3100 whereupon a list of available<br>
network domains is displayed to the user (step 3110). A<br>
domain is selected from the list by the user (step 3120). A<br>
determination is made as to whether to authenticate the client<br>
locally or remotely (decision 3130). If the client is<br>
authenticated locally, decision 3130 branches to "yes" branch<br>
3135 whereupon the user is authenticated at the local machine<br>
(step 3140). On the other hand, if the user is not<br>
authenticated locally, decision 3130 branches to "no" branch<br>
3145 whereupon the user is authenticated on a server to which<br>
the client is connected (step 3150) .<br>
A determination is made as to whether the client was<br>
authenticated (decision 3160). If the user was not<br>
authenticated, decision 3160 branches to "no" branch 3165<br>
whereupon an error is displayeđ on the client's đisplay device<br>
(step 3170) and processing ends at 3195. On the other hand,<br>
if the user was authenticated, decision 3160 branches to wyes"<br>
branch 3175 whereupon the Java shell launcher is invoked<br>
(predefined process 3180, see Figure 32 for processing<br>
details) and processing ends at 3195.<br>
Figure 32 is a flowchart showing steps taken when<br>
invoking the Java shell launcher. Java Shell Launcher<br>
execution commences at 3200 whereupon a class path, or<br>
directory, is set (step 3210). The Java virtual machine (JVM)<br>
is loadeđ on the client computing device (step 3220).<br>
A determination is made as to whether the Jshell<br>
application is launched remotely or locally (decision 3230).<br>
If the Jshell application is launched locally, decision 3230<br>
branches to "local" branch 3235 whereupon the Jshell<br>
application is launched with the user's user ID as a parameter<br>
(step 3240). On the other hand, if the Jshell application is<br>
launched remotely, decision 3230 branches to "remote" branch<br>
3245 whereupon the Jshell application is launched remotely by<br>
providing the server hostname, the user ID, and the platform<br>
ID as parameters (step 3250) .<br>
After the Jshell application has been launched, JSL<br>
enumerajbes the OS window list to find the window corresponding<br>
to the Java shell (step 3260) . The Java shell window is<br>
pinned to the bottom of the Z-order list of the operating<br>
system windows so that the Java shell window will always<br>
remain in the foreground (step 3270). The Java shell window<br>
is maximized to fit the display screen and ali frame controls,<br>
such as minimize and resize buttons, are removed from the Java<br>
shell window (step 3280). In this manner, the shell<br>
application appears as the foreground page on the display and<br>
the user is prevented from using the shell page provided by<br>
6 O<br>
the native operating system platform. Java shell launching<br>
processing ends at 3295.<br>
Figure 33A is a screen layout showing an example of a<br>
smart graphical component. The actual container type<br>
corresponđs to an implementation construct such as a class in<br>
C++ and Java or a struct in C. This implementation construct<br>
will be referred to as the classtype. The smart component<br>
attempts to determine the classtype of it's parent component<br>
(e.g., a container) at runtime. If the identified classtype<br>
is of a tvpe that the component recognizes, the component<br>
modifies its behavior and appearance according to the<br>
identified classtype. The behavior and appearance<br>
modifications can be programmatically incorpor'ateđ into the<br>
smart component or read from a configuration file. If the<br>
classtvpe of the parent is not recognized, the component may<br>
be programmed to ascend it's parent hierarchy until a<br>
recognized container is found. In this manner, the component<br>
may be placed inside of a container with an unknovm classtype,<br>
but if the parent container is itself inside of another<br>
container with a knovm classtype, then the component can<br>
configure itself as if it had been placed directly in the<br>
known container classtype.<br>
The appearance and behavior of the smart component is<br>
đetermined by the classtype of it's parent container. For<br>
example, a smart icon will display a text description if it's<br>
parent classtype is a desktop. However, the same smart icon<br>
will not display the text description if it's parent classtype<br>
is a toolbar. Furthermore, the smart icons behavior may<br>
differ depending on the type of parent container. For<br>
example, if the icond is placed in a toolbar it may be<br>
programmed to draw a borđer around itself when the user places<br>
the mouse pointer over it. However, if the same icon is<br>
6l<br>
placed on the desktop it may be prograiraned to not display a<br>
border when the pointer passes over it. In addition, the<br>
smart icon may be progranuned to execute different code related<br>
to the component upon activation depending upon the type of<br>
container to which it belongs.<br>
Screen image 3300 includes two examples of a smart<br>
graphical component in the form of a time c.lock. Time clock<br>
3305 is a component that has been placed in a toolbar<br>
container. Time clock 3330. is the same component, but this<br>
time the time clock has been placed in the desktop container.<br>
The appearance and behavior of the object changes depending<br>
upon the type of parent object, or container, to which the<br>
object belongs. In the example shown, time clock 3305 is<br>
displayed as a digital time because of the smaller area<br>
available in the parent toolbar container. Conversely, time<br>
clock 3330 displays an analog time because of the greater area<br>
available in the desktop container. In addition, time clock<br>
3330 đisplays adđitional information such as the digital time<br>
and date underneath the analog clock image. Furthermore, time<br>
clock 3330 displays the name of the object (i.e. "clock")<br>
underneath the object.<br>
When the user selects time clock 3305 located in the<br>
toolbar, pop-up window 3320 is displayed. Pop-up window 3320<br>
displays the day of the week, date, and has menu items to<br>
adjust the time/ćlate and to set notif ications.<br>
Figure 33B is a screen layout showing an second example<br>
of a smart graphical component. Screen image 3350 is similar<br>
to a screen image shown in Figure 33A, however in Figure 33B<br>
time clock 3330 has been selected and pop-up menu 3390 is<br>
displayed. The behavior of displayed pop-up menu shovm in<br>
Figure 33B is different from that shown for the same time<br>
clock component shown in Figure 33A. In particular, in Figure<br>
33B the user has đisplay options as to whether a digital time<br>
clock, a day of the week, and display date should be shown<br>
along with the analog clock. These additional đisplay options<br>
are available because of the larger size"available for showing<br>
icons in the desktop container, rather than in a toolbar<br>
container.<br>
Figure 34 is a hierarchy chart showing various desktop<br>
objects. Desktop object 3400 is at the top of the hierarchy<br>
chart and includes component objects 3410 and container<br>
objects 3470. Component objects 3410 include both visual<br>
components 3420 and non-visual components 3440. Visual<br>
component objects include 'icons 3425, folders 3430, and<br>
toolbars 3435. Non-visual component objects include<br>
application exten.sion code 3445 and application definitions<br>
3450.<br>
As the name implies, container objects 3470 include<br>
objects that can include, or hold, other objects. Container<br>
objects include folders 3480 and toolbars 3490. Visual<br>
components such as icons can be includeđ in container objects.<br>
Figure 35 is a flowchart showing steps taken in<br>
initializing smart graphical components. Smart graphical<br>
component initialization processing commences at 3500<br>
whereupon a object oriented parent object is selected for<br>
component (step 3510). The object oriented class type for the<br>
selected parent object is retrieved (step 3520). A<br>
determination is made as to whether the retrieved class type<br>
is a recognized class type, such as a folder or a toolbar<br>
(decision 3525). If the retrieved class type is not<br>
recognized, decision 3525 branches to "no" branch 3S45<br>
whereupon a determination is mađe as to whether there are more<br>
parents in the object hierarchy (decision 3550) . If there are<br>
more parents in the object hierarchy, the parent of the last<br>
53.<br>
selecteđ object (i.e. the parent o f the last parent, or the<br>
grandparent of the subject object) is selecteđ (step 3560) and<br>
processing loops back to determine whether the newly selecteđ<br>
parent is a recognized class type. This'looping continues<br>
until either a recognized class type is found or there are no<br>
more parents in the'object hierarchy. If a recognized class<br>
type is found, decision 3525 branches to "yes" branch 3530<br>
whereupon the recognized class type is selecteđ (step 3540).<br>
On the other hand, if there are no more parents in the object<br>
hierarchy, decision 3550 branches to "no" branch 3565<br>
whereupon a default class type is selecteđ for the object<br>
(step 3570).<br>
Component appearance data, such as the icon siže and<br>
other display cha'racteristics, are retrieved along with object<br>
behavior characteristics that correspond to the selecteđ class<br>
type (step 3575). For example, if the retrieved class type is<br>
a toolbar then the icon siže and display characteristics would<br>
be based upon the smaller area available to an icon.that is<br>
displayed in a toolbar. However, if the retrieved class type<br>
is the desktop then the icon siže and display characteristics<br>
are based upon the larger area available in the desktop.<br>
The component is displayed using the retrieved appearance<br>
data that corresponds to the class type. The system waits for<br>
*.<br>
the component to be.invoked (step 3585, i.e. until the<br>
component is selecteđ by the user). When the component is<br>
invoked, the component is executed using behavior attributes<br>
that correspond to the class type (step 3590).<br>
Figure 36 is a flowchart showing steps taken in<br>
processing display attributes for smart graphical components.<br>
Smart desktop processing commences at 3600 whereupon a<br>
determination is rnade as to whether the class type is a<br>
toolbar ('decision 3605) . If the class type is a toolbar,<br>
decision 3605 branches to wyes" branch 3610 whereupon the<br>
toolbar icon for the component is retrieved and displayeđ in<br>
the toolbar (step 3615), a border is đravm around the icon in<br>
the toolbar (step 3620), and processing ends at 3625.<br>
If the class type is not a toolbar, decision 3605<br>
branches to "no" branch 3630 whereupon a determination is made<br>
as to whether the class type is a folder (decision 3635). .If<br>
the class type is a folder, decision 3635 branches to Myes"<br>
branch 3640 whereupon the folder icon for the component is<br>
retrieved and displayed in the folder (step 3645), a short<br>
component description is displayeđ underneath the icon (step<br>
3650), and processing ends at 3655.<br>
If the class type is not a toolbar or a folder, decision<br>
3635 branches to "no" branch 3660 whereupon a determination is<br>
made as to whether the class type is the đesktop (decision<br>
3665). If the class type is the đesktop, decision 3665<br>
branches to "yes" branch 3668 whereupon the larger icon is<br>
retrieved in displayed on the đesktop (step 3670), a longer<br>
component description is displayed unđer the icon (decision<br>
3675), and processing ends at 3680.<br>
If the class type is not a toolbar, a folder, or desktop,<br>
then decision 3665 branches to wno" branch 3682 whereupon a<br>
default„ icon is retrieved and displayed (step 3685), other<br>
default display characteristics are retrieved and applied to<br>
the icon (step 3690), and processing ends at 3695.<br>
Figure 37 is a flowchart showing steps taken in<br>
processing behavior attributes for smart graphical components.<br>
Smart desktop processing commences at 3700 whereupon a<br>
determination is made as to whether the invoked component has<br>
a parent with a toolbar class type (decision 3705). If the<br>
invoked component has a toolbar parent class type, decision<br>
66<br>
3705 branches to "yes" branch 3710 whereupon the component's<br>
toolbar behavior is retrieved (step 3715), the retrieved<br>
toolbar behavior is executed (step 3720), and processing ends<br>
at 3725.<br>
If the invoked component does not have a parent with a<br>
toolbar class type, decision 3705 branches to "no" branch 3730<br>
whereupon a determination is made as to whether the invoked<br>
component has a parent with a folder class type (decision<br>
3735). If the invoked component has a folder parent class<br>
type, decision 3735 branches to "yes" branch 3740 whereupon<br>
the component's folder behavior is retrieved (step 3745.),<br>
executed (step 3750), and processing ends at 3755.<br>
If the invoked component đoes not have any parent with a<br>
toolbar or folder class type, decision 3735 branches to "no"<br>
branch 3760 whereupon a determination is mađe as to whether<br>
the invoked component has a parent with a desktop class type<br>
(decision 3765). If the invoked component has a desktop<br>
parent class type, decision 3765 branches to "yes" branch 3768<br>
whereupon the component's desktop behavior is retrieved (step<br>
3770), executed (step 3775), and processing ends at step 3780.<br>
If the invoked component does not have a parent with a<br>
class type of toolbar, folder, or desktop, decision 3765<br>
branches to "no" branch 3782 whereupon the components default<br>
behavior is retrieved (step 3785), executed (step 3790), and<br>
processing ends at step 3795.<br>
Figure 38 illustrates Information handling system 3801<br>
which is a simplified example of a computer system capable of<br>
performing the operations describeđ herein. Computer system<br>
3801 includes processor 3800 which is coupled to host bus<br>
3805. A level two (L2) cache memory 3810 is also coupled to<br>
the host bus 3805. Host-to-PCI bridge 3815 is coupled to main<br>
memory 3820, inclućles cache memory and main memory control<br>
functions, and provides bus contr.ol to handle transfers among<br>
PCI bus 3825, processor 3800, L2 cache 3810, main memory 3820,<br>
and host bus 3805. PCI bus 3825 provides an interface for a<br>

interface 3866, keyboard interface 3868, mouse interface 3870,<br>
fixed disk (HDD) 3872 coupled to ISA bus 3840. Alternatively,<br>
many I/O devices can be accommodated by a super I/O controller<br>
(not shown) attached to ISA bus 3840.<br>
BIOS 3880 is coupled to ISA bus 3840,' and incorporates<br>
the necessary processor executable code for a variety of lowlevel<br>
system functions and system boot functions. BIOS 3880<br>
can be stored in ariy computer readable .medium, including<br>
magnetic storage media, optical storage media, flash memory,<br>
random access memory, read only memory, and Communications<br>
media conveying signals encoding the instructions (e.g.,<br>
signals from a network). In order to attach computer system<br>
3801 to another computer system to copy files over a network,<br>
LAN card 3830 is coupled to PCI bus 3825 and to PCI-to-ISA<br>
bridge 3835. Similarly, to connect computer system 3801 to an<br>
ISP to connect to the Internet using a telephone line<br>
connection, modem 3875 is connected to serial port 3864 and<br>
PCI-to-ISA Bridge 3835.<br>
While the computer system đescribed in Figure 38 i s<br>
capable of jexecuting the invention đescribed herein, this<br>
computer system is simply one example of a computer system.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate'that many other<br>
computer system designs are capable of performing the<br>
invention đescribed herein.<br>
One of the preferred implementations of the invention is<br>
an application, namely, a set of instructions (program code)<br>
in a cođe module which may, for example, be resident in the<br>
random access memory of the computer. Until recjuired by the<br>
computer, the set of instructions may be stored in another<br>
computer memory, for examp'le, on a hard disk drive, or in<br>
removable storage such as an optical disk (for eventual use in<br>
a CD ROM) or floppy disk (for eventual use in a floppy disk<br>
drive), or downloaded via the Internet or other computer<br>
netvrork. Thus, the present invention may be implemented as a<br>
computer program product for use in a computer. In addition,<br>
although the various methods đescribed are conveniently<br>
implemented in a general purpose computer selectively<br>
activated or reconfigured by software, one of ordinary skill<br>
in the art would also recognize that such methods may be<br>
carried out in hardware, in firmware, or in more specialized<br>
apparatus constructed to perform the required method steps.<br>
While particular embodiments of the present invention<br>
have been shown and đescribed, it will be obvious to those<br>
skilled in the art that, based upon the teachings herein,<br>
changes and modifications may be made without departing from<br>
this invention and its broader aspects and, therefore, the<br>
appended claims are to encompass within their scope ali such<br>
changes and mođifications as are within the true špirit and<br>
scope of this invention. Furthermore, it is to be understood<br>
that the invention is solely defined by the appended claims.<br>
It will be understood by those with skill in the art that if a<br>
specific number of an introduced claim element is intended,<br>
such intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in<br>
the absence of such recitation no such liinitation is present.<br>
For a non-limiting example, as an aid to understanding, the<br>
following appended claims contain usage of the introductory<br>
phrases "at least one" and "one or more" to introduce claim<br>
elements. However, the use of such phrases should not be<br>
construed to imply that the introduction of a claim element by<br>
the indefinite articles "a" or "an" limits any particular<br>
claim containing such introduced claim element to inventions<br>
containing only one such element, even when the same claim<br>
includes the introductory phrases "one or more" or "at least<br>
one" and indefinite articles such as "a" or "an"; the same<br>
holds true for the use in the claims of definite articles.<br><br><br><br>
