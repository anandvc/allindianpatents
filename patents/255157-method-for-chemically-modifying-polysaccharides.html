Title:	METHOD FOR CHEMICALLY MODIFYING POLYSACCHARIDES<br><br>
The present invention relates to a method for chemically<br>
modifying polysaccharides with the aid of a mechanical<br>
device and at least one modifying reagent<br>
Chemically modified polysaccharides are used widely in<br>
highly diverse areas The best known fields of application<br>
are as thickeners, emulsifiers, foam stabilizers,<br>
dispersants, adhesives, sizes, flocculants, hair<br>
conditioners, building material additives and sorbents<br>
The aim of modifying polysaccharides consists, for example,<br>
in an improvement of the solubility in general and in<br>
particular in an increased alcohol solubility. However, the<br>
emulsifying properties of the polysaccharides can also be<br>
improved, and/or their thermostability can be increased,<br>
the introduction of chelating or charged groups may also be<br>
an interesting aspect of the chemical polysaccharide<br>
modification. However, graft polymerization can also<br>
produce polysaccharide polymers with new properties<br>
In general, compared with purely synthetic polymers,<br>
chemically modified polysaccharides have the advantage that<br>
they are biodegradable, which, particularly in. the<br>
development of new products, is ever more important<br>
A review of known reactions for chemically modifying<br>
polysaccharides is given by K Engelskirchen<br>
("Polysaccharid-Denvative" [Polysaccharide derivatives],<br>
in "Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie", Volume<br>
E20/Part 3 Makromolekulare Stoffe [Macromolecular<br>
substances], Georg Thieme Verlag 1987)<br>
Known examples of derivatizations of polysaccharides which<br><br>
may be mentioned are the carboxymethylation of chloroacetic<br>
acid or chloroacetates and the methylation with methyl<br>
halides (cf . D Klemm et al , "Comprehensive Cellulose<br>
Chemistry Volume 2", Wiley-VCH, 1998, pp. 221-234).<br>
However, the hydroxyethylation with ethylene oxide, the<br>
hydroxypropylation with propylene oxide (cf . D. Klemm et<br>
al. , "Comprehensive Cellulose Chemistry Volume 2", Wiley-<br>
VCH, 1998, pp 235-246), the amidation of pectins with<br>
ammonia or an ammonia solution and the esterification with<br>
the help of acids, anhydrides or acid chlorides is also<br>
widespread Also m widespread use are the phosphatmg with<br>
orthophosphates, the ether formation with epoxides,<br>
organohalogen compounds, such as, for example,<br>
chlorohydrms or Michael acceptors, such as acrylic acid<br>
derivatives The specified reactions can also be carried<br>
out in the presence of bases, acids or free-radical<br>
initiators which act as catalysts or reactants<br>
Also generally known is the hydrolytic, enzymatic, thermal<br>
or oxidative degradation of the polysaccharides to give<br>
products of reduced molecular weight or else reverse<br>
crosslmking, which leads to higher molecular weights.<br>
The specified various reactions for chemically modifying<br>
polysaccharides are not restricted to certain<br>
representatives, instead, all known polysaccharides, such<br>
as, for example, pectins, alginates, carrageenans,<br>
galactomannans, such as carob seed flour or guar seed<br>
flour, starches and celluloses, are suitable Further<br>
suitable substances are, for example, the polysaccharides<br>
listed by Pilnik et al ("Polysaccharides", in "Ullmanns<br>
Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry", Vol 19, Verlag<br>
Chemie Wemheim, 1980, pp 233-263), which are considered<br>
to be part of this disclosure<br><br>
However, with all of the specified reactions, the low<br>
solubility and the marked viscosity-increasing properties<br>
of most polysaccharides prove to be disadvantageous, as a<br>
result of which chemical modification on an industrial<br>
scale is made more difficult To overcome these problems,<br>
the reactions have to be carried out either in highly<br>
diluted solutions or in suspensions Only for very few<br>
specific applications are solids reactions with pulverulent<br>
starting materials suitable<br>
US 4,758,282 describes the so-called "dry" catiomzation of<br>
galactomannans, such as, for example, guar, with alkylidene<br>
epoxides and alkali metal or alkaline earth metal<br>
hydroxides in the presence of water and silicon dioxide.<br>
The technical aid used m this method is a plowshare mixer<br>
A comparable derivatization of starch or starch-containing<br>
substances is described m US 4,785,087. In this case too,<br>
recourse is made to a plowshare mixer as technical aid<br>
A solvent-free derivatization method for starch is<br>
described by Meuser et al in Starch 1990, 42(9), pages 330<br>
to 33 6 The method described here involves chemical<br>
modification in an extruder, where cationic starches and<br>
carboxymethyl starches are obtained. However, the use of an<br>
extruder is only useful to a very limited extent since,<br>
besides the very marked shear forces, high pressures and<br>
temperatures also arise which exclude the use of thermally<br>
sensitive modifying reagents and, moreover, can lead to<br>
degradation of the polysaccharide structure. This undesired<br>
secondary reaction is described in DE 4344156 A1 in<br>
connection with the production of depolymerized<br>
galactomannans.<br>
If the reactions for the chemical modification are carried<br>
out in aqueous solutions, in most cases only very low<br><br>
degrees of substitution of the polysaccharides are achieved<br>
since most functional groups which are capable of reacting<br>
with polysaccharides also react with water Solvents which<br>
would be able to dissolve polysaccharides, such as, for<br>
example, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide, dimethyl-<br>
acetamide and pyridines, are mostly toxic, hazardous to the<br>
environment and/or technically problematic to handle<br>
Furthermore, on account of the required high dilutions,<br>
very large amounts of solvent are required, which<br>
additionally renders the processes uneconomical.<br>
On the other hand, reactions in suspensions or solids<br>
reactions exhibit advantages since these require much<br>
smaller amounts of solvents In this case, the<br>
polysaccharide is not completely dissolved but, instead,<br>
through small amounts of solvents, a swelling of the solids<br>
particles is achieved, as a result of which diffusion of<br>
the subsequently added compounds into the polysaccharide<br>
particles is facilitated However, it is disadvantageous<br>
here that the polysaccharide particles cannot be penetrated<br>
uniformly by the modifying reagent, for which reason<br>
homogeneously substituted products cannot be obtained with<br>
this process variant Rather, the surface of the particles<br>
is significantly more highly modified than the inner areas,<br>
which is disadvantageous for the product properties and the<br>
reproducibility of the reaction overall This problem<br>
occurs all the more so, the more hydrophobic the modifying<br>
reagent A further aspect consists in the overall course of<br>
the reaction being greatly influenced by the particle size<br>
of the polysaccharide, as a result of which uniform<br>
reaction control is made more difficult<br>
In view of the described disadvantages of the prior art,<br>
the object for the present invention is to provide a method<br>
for chemically modifying polysaccharides which is carried<br><br>
out with the aid of a mechanical device and at least one<br>
modifying reagent Using this novel method, a homogeneous<br>
and at the same time reproducible chemical modification<br>
should become possible although toxic and/or<br>
environmentally harmful solvents and auxiliaries should be<br>
largely dispensed with A method is desirable which can be<br>
used as universally as possible for a broad spectrum of<br>
reaction types and which restricts the type of modifying<br>
reagents to be used as little as possible<br>
This object is achieved with a corresponding method which<br>
is characterized in that the polysaccharide component is<br>
subjected at least once to such a treatment with a roll<br>
mill that at least two adjacent and counter-rotating rolls<br>
rotate at different speeds and the polysaccharide component<br>
is mixed with the modifying reagent before and/or during<br>
the mechanical treatment<br>
Surprisingly, with this new method it was established that<br>
the desired chemical modification in the sense of a<br>
denvatization can be carried out extremely efficiently on<br>
very diverse polysaccharides, the modification range being<br>
additionally increased since the modifying reagents used<br>
are not subject to any restriction of any kind<br>
Additionally, it was established that only very small<br>
amounts of liquid are required, where in particular water,<br>
being an ecologically and economically favorable solvent,<br>
can be used instead of the otherwise customary organic<br>
solvents Of particular advantage is the method for<br>
hydrophobic and non-water-soluble modifying reagents which<br>
can thus, even m the presence of water, be homogeneously<br>
mixed and reacted with the polysaccharide component<br>
It was further surprising that despite the relatively high<br>
shear forces which arise as a result of the counter-<br><br>
rotating rolls, negative influences, as are known, for<br>
example, from extruders according to the prior art, do not<br>
arise Rather, these high shear forces in the present case<br>
bring about an extremely homogeneous distribution of the<br>
reagents in the polysaccharide without this component being<br>
completely dissolved<br>
For the method according to the invention, it has proven<br>
advantageous to use a two-, three- or four-roll mill, while<br>
industrially a three-roll mill can be used particularly<br>
advantageously<br>
If, for reasons of cost or other reasons, a device with<br>
fewer rolls is available or adequate homogenization is not<br>
achieved in one treatment step, the mechanical treatment<br>
can of course also be repeated as often as desired In this<br>
connection, the present invention envisages that, in<br>
particular, the mechanical treatment is repeated one to<br>
three times<br>
It is, inter alia, to be regarded as essential to the<br>
invention that adjacent rolls move countercurrently, and<br>
additionally have different rotation speeds It is to be<br>
regarded as advisable if the rotation speeds of the<br>
adjacent rolls differ by 10 to 500%, with 100 to 300% being<br>
preferred and a rotation speed difference of 200% being<br>
particularly preferred<br>
As already indicated, the polysaccharide component is not<br>
subject to any limitations of any kind For this reason, it<br>
can originate from all known starting materials, where<br>
representatives from the series pectin, galactomannans (in<br>
particular carob seed flour, guar seed flour, cassia, tara<br>
and tamarind galactomannan), alginates, carrageenans,<br>
xanthans, scleroglucans, starches, celluloses, gellans,<br><br>
pullulans, chitosans and any mixtures thereof are<br>
preferably used, which is likewise taken into consideration<br>
by the present invention.<br>
In certain application cases of the claimed method, it may<br>
be favorable to carry out the mechanical processing and<br>
simultaneous chemical modification in the presence of at<br>
least one catalyst For this case, a series of suitable<br>
compounds are available, preference being given to using<br>
bases, acids or free-radical initiators as are known from<br>
the prior art The use amount here can be chosen relatively<br>
broadly, although a lower limit of 0 1% by weight and an<br>
upper limit of 3 0% by weight should be observed. The<br>
claimed method can be carried out particularly well if the<br>
catalyst content is between 0 5 and 10% by weight and in<br>
particular between 1 0 and 5 0% by weight, again based on<br>
the polysaccharide component.<br>
The use of catalysts is required for certain modifying<br>
reactions, the type and amount of the catalyst being<br>
heavily dependent on the type of reaction.<br>
Listed below are particularly suitable modifying reagents<br>
which can be used for the method according to the<br>
invention<br>
Epoxides, such as, for example, glycidol derivatives,<br>
epoxy-functionalized polysiloxanes, epoxy-functionalized<br>
quaternary ammonium compounds (e g 2,3-epoxypropyltri-<br>
methylammomum chloride, Quab® 151) and alkylene oxides<br>
react in the presence of basic catalysts with hydroxy<br>
groups of the polysaccharides to form ethers<br>
Polysaccharides with carboxylic acid functions (such as,<br>
for example, alginates, low-esterification pectins and<br>
xanthans) react with epoxides even in the absence of<br><br>
catalysts to give carboxylic acid esters<br>
Also suitable for the etherification of polysaccharides are<br>
alkyl halides and derivatives, such as alkyl chlorides,<br>
chloroacetic acid and its salts, halohydrms, such as<br>
epichlorohydnn or 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyltrimethyl-<br>
ammonium chloride (Quab® 188), mono- and dialkyl sulfates,<br>
also Michael acceptors, such as acrylic acid, acrylic acid<br>
esters, acrylamide, maleamide acids (e g N-octadecyl-<br>
maleamide acid), and esters or derivatives thereof. If<br>
appropriate, the use of catalytic or stoichiometric amounts<br>
of bases may be required here<br>
Carboxylic acids and derivatives thereof are likewise<br>
preferred modifying reagents which can be reacted with<br>
polysaccharides to form esters Of suitability are<br>
primarily acid chlorides or anhydrides of fatty acids,<br>
maleic anhydride, succinic anhydride, acetic anhydride or<br>
acetyl chloride<br>
Pectins contain carboxylic acid methyl ester functions<br>
which can be functionalized with ammonia or primary or<br>
secondary alkyl- or arylamines to give amides. Besides<br>
ammonia or ammonia solutions, long-chain alkylammes, such<br>
as fatty amines, in particular are of interest<br>
It is of course also possible to use suitable mixtures of<br>
the specified reagents or comparable compounds provided<br>
these are compatible with one another and with the<br>
optionally used catalysts and reaction conditions<br>
The method according to the invention can be carried out<br>
particularly well when the modifying reagent is used in<br>
amounts of from 0 1 to 3 00% by weight, based on the<br>
polysaccharide component, where amounts between 1.0 and<br><br>
150% by weight, in particular between 10 and 100% by weight<br>
and particularly preferably between 2 0 and 50% by weight<br>
are particularly suitable The required amount of modifying<br>
reagent is of course dependent on the desired degree of<br>
substitution of the product and the reaction yield and<br>
selectivity of the modifying reaction, for which reason the<br>
suitable amount has to be determined in the individual<br>
case<br>
Although, surprisingly, it has emerged that the claimed<br>
method requires only minimal amounts of liquid, it may,<br>
however, be necessary, depending on the polysaccharide used<br>
and the particular modifying reagent, to add additional<br>
auxiliaries during the mechanical processing A preferred<br>
representative of the additional auxiliaries which may be<br>
mentioned in the first instance is water, however, oils,<br>
alcohols, polyols, polyglycols, polyglycol ethers, borates<br>
and fumed or precipitated silicas can also be used In this<br>
connection, amounts which are between 1 and 50% by weight,<br>
based on the polysaccharide component, have proven to be<br>
particularly favorable<br>
The quality of the chemical modification achieved with the<br>
method according to the invention can additionally be<br>
influenced through the choice of reaction temperature The<br>
specified advantages of the method according to the<br>
invention become evident particularly when temperatures<br>
between 0 and 150°C are chosen, the particular temperature<br>
being established by heating and/or cooling at least one<br>
roll Alternatively or additionally, however, the reaction<br>
mixture can also be heated or cooled after the particular<br>
mechanical treatment, if appropriate also under<br>
superatmospheric pressure of from preferably 0 to 5 bar.<br>
If required, an additional solvent can also of course be<br><br><br>
added, for which, on account of the chemical composition<br>
and structure of the starting material in particular, water<br>
has proven to be suitable The additional amounts of<br>
solvent should preferably be below 70% by weight, where<br>
amounts of 
particularly preferred and amounts of 
regarded as being especially preferred The respective<br>
quantities of the additional solvent refer to the total<br>
reaction mixture<br>
Besides the described method, the present invention also<br>
claims the use of the modified polysaccharides produced by<br>
this method in a relatively broad application spectrum.<br>
Here, the use as thickener, gelling agent, emulsifier, food<br>
additive, as cosmetic additive, as building material<br>
additive, as hair-treatment or hair-aftertreatment<br>
composition or as laundry care composition is taken into<br>
consideration by the invention<br>
With the proposed method it is possible to chemically<br>
modify polysaccharides homogeneously in a simple way<br>
without negative effects arising, for example, from high<br>
temperatures and pressures The shear forces likewise<br>
arising in the method according to the invention bring<br>
about homogeneous mixing, where they arise only for a short<br>
time and the heat which forms is very efficiently<br>
dissipated by the large roll surface The simple and<br>
effective method is not restricted to certain<br>
polysaccharides and the method can easily be adapted to the<br>
particular application case through the selection of the<br>
process conditions and the addition of auxiliaries or<br>
acceptable solvents<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates the procedure of the claimed method In<br>
the embodiment shown, modification takes place with three<br><br>
1 I<br>
counter-rotating rolls (1, 2, 3), whose rotation speeds<br>
differ in each case by a factor of 3 A mixture of<br>
polysaccharide and modifying reagent (4) is applied between<br>
the first roll (1) and the second roll (2) and, after the<br>
mechanical treatment, is removed from the third roll (3)<br>
using a scraper (5)<br>
The examples below illustrate the advantages of the method<br>
according to the invention<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
50 g of carob seed flour were mixed with a solution of<br>
1 5 g of sodium hydroxide in 50 ml of distilled water and<br>
homogenized by passing twice over a three-roll mill Each<br>
of the adjacent rolls differed m their rotation speed by<br>
200%, the absolute speed being 0 14 m/sec for roll 1,<br>
0 42 m/sec for roll 2 and 1 25 m/sec for roll 3 20 g of a<br>
bis-epoxypolydimethylsiloxane were added and the mixture<br>
was again homogenized twice using the three-roll mill under<br>
identical conditions The product was heated at 105°C for<br>
4 h m a sealed vessel, dispersed into 300 ml of 66%<br>
isopropanol using an ultra-turrax and adjusted to pH 7 0<br>
using 10% HCl The solid was filtered off with suction,<br>
washed with 300 ml of isopropanol and dried m a drying<br>
cabinet at 60°C The degree of substitution was determined<br>
by means of NMR following hydrolysis with DC1/D20 as 0.001<br>
polydimethylsiloxane units per monosaccharide unit<br>
Example 2.<br>
100 g of slow set pectin (DE 61.5) were coarsely mixed with<br>
a mixture of 43 ml of 25% ammonia solution, 70 ml of<br><br>
distilled water and 3 8 ml of isopropanol and homogenized at<br>
10°C using a three-roll mill. Each of the adjacent rolls<br>
differed in their rotation speed by 200%, the absolute<br>
speeds being 0 14 m/sec for roll 1, 0 42 m/sec for roll 2<br>
and 1 25 m/sec for roll 3. The product was left to stand<br>
for 4 h, then taken up in 50% isopropanol, filtered with<br>
suction, washed with 3 00 ml of 50% isopropanol and dried<br>
The product had a degree of amidation (DA) of 22 and a DE<br>
of 29<br>
Example 3<br>
40 g of hydroxypropylguar were mixed with a solution of<br>
0.4 g of sodium hydroxide and 16 g of glycidyltrimethyl-<br>
ammonium chloride (70% solution in water) in 7 ml of water<br>
and passed over a three-roll mill Each of the adjacent<br>
rolls differed in their rotation speed by 2 00%, the<br>
absolute speeds being 0 14 m/sec for roll 1, 0.42 m/sec for<br>
roll 2 and 1 25 m/sec for roll 3 The mixture was heated at<br>
50°C for 20 h, then suspended m isopropanol, neutralized<br>
with citric acid and the solid was filtered off with<br>
suction The product was dried in a drying cabinet at 100°C<br>
and ground The degree of substitution of the product was<br>
0 18 hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium groups per<br>
monosaccharide unit<br>
Example 4.<br>
10 g of guar seed flour were mixed with a solution of 3 g<br>
of sodium hydroxide in 15 ml of distilled water and passed<br>
twice over a three-roll mill Each of the adjacent rolls<br>
differed in their rotation speed by 200%, the absolute<br>
speeds being 0 14 m/sec for roll 1, 0 42 m/sec for roll 2<br>
and 1 25 m/sec for roll 3 The resulting yellowish mass was<br>
stored for 1 h at room temperature, then admixed with 7.3 g<br><br>
of N-octadecylmaleamidic acid (HOOC-CH=CH-CONH-C18H37) and<br>
homogenized again twice over the three-roll mill under<br>
otherwise identical conditions. The product was heated at<br>
60°C for 4 h in a sealed vessel, taken up in 100 ml of 60%<br>
isopropanol, dispersed using an ultra-turrax and the<br>
suspension was adjusted to pH 7.0 with 10% HCl. The solid<br>
was filtered on a glass frit and dried m a drying cabinet<br>
at 60°C The product had new strong IR absorptions at<br>
1641 cm-1 as well as at 2919 and 2849 cm-1, characteristic<br>
of the C=O or C-H stretch vibrations, respectively, of the<br>
introduced substituents<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
Title	METHOD FOR CHEMICALLY MODIFYING POLYSACCHARIDES<br>
The invention relates to a method for chemically modifying polysaccharides with<br>
the aid of a mechanical device and of at least one modifying reagent. The<br>
method is characterized in that the polysaccharide constituent is subjected at<br>
least once to a treatment by a roll mill during which at least two adjacent and<br>
counter-rotating rolls rotate at different speeds, and the polysaccharide<br>
constituent is mixed with the modifying reagent before and/or during the<br>
mechanical treatment. During this method, typically pectins, carob seed gram,<br>
guar meal and alginates are used as the polysaccharide constituent, and<br>
epoxides, amines or carboxylic acid derivatives are used as modifying reagents.<br>
The mechanical treatment can be repeated one to three times in a multiple roll<br>
mill, preferred rotating speeds of the adjacent rolls typically differing by 200%.<br>
The polysaccharides, which are mechanically modified in an extremely<br>
homogeneous manner according to the inventive method, are preferably used as<br>
thickening agents, gelling agents, emulsifiers, food additive, cosmetic additives,<br>
as well as hair and fiber care agents.</td>
