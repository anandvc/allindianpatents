PESTICIDAL 1-ARYL-3-AMIDOXIWJE-PYRA20LE DERIVATIVES<br>
The invention relates to 1-arylpyrazote-3-SLibstttuied-amidoxime derivatives, processes for their preparation, to compositions thereof, and to their use for the control of pests, such as harmful" arthropods (including insects and arachnids) and helminths (including nematodes).<br>
The control of insects, arachnids or helminths with 1-arylpyrazoie compounds has been described in, for example, patent publication numbers WO 93/06089, WO 94/21606, WO 87/03781, EP 0295117, EP 659745, EP 679650, EP 201852 and U.S. 5,232,940, The control of parasites in animals filth 1-arylpyrazole compounds has also been described in patent publication numbers WO 00/35884, EP 0846686, WO 98/24769 and WO 97/28126.<br>
In particular WO 98/28278 and WO 97/28126 describe certain l-arylpyrazole-3-substituted-amidoxime derivatives as we!) as other related compounds, however benzyl substituted and heterocyclic    are not specifically mentioned therein, nor is it suggested that they might also be useful as pesticides.<br>
However, the level of action and/or duration of action of these prior-art compounds is not entirely satisfactory in alt fields of application, in particular against certain organisms or when low concentrations are applied.<br>
Since modern pesticides must meet a wide range of demands, for example regarding level, duration and spectrum of action, use spectrum, toxicity, combination Vflth other active substances, combination with formulation auxiliaries or synthesis, and since the occurrence of resistances is possible, the development of such substances can never be regarded as concluded, and there is constantly a high demand for novel compounds which are advantageous over the knovm compounds, at least as far as some aspects are concerned.<br>

Collections of compounds of the formula (I) which can be synthesized by the above mentioned process may also be prepared in a parallel manner, and this may be effected manually or in a semiautomated or fully automated manner, fn this case, it is possible, for example, to automate the procedure of the reaction, work-up or p jiTfication of the products or of the intennediates. in total, this is to be understood as meaning a procedure as is described, for example, by S.H. DeWitt in "Annual Reports in Combinatorial Chemistry and Molecular Diversity: Automated Synthesis", Volume 1, Veriag E&amp;txim 1997. p^es 69 to 77.<br><br>
A series o! commercially available apparatuses as are offered by, for example. Stem Corporation. Woodrotfe Road, Tollesbury, Essex, CU9 8SE, England or H+P Labortechnik GmbH, Bruckmanndng 28, 85764 ObetschleiBheim, Germany ot Radleys, Shirehili, Saffron Walden. Essex, England, may t&gt;e used for the parallel procedure of the reaction and worit-up. For the parallel purification of compounds of the formula (I), or of intermediates obtained during the preparation, use may be made, inter alia, of chromatography apparatuses, for example those by tSCO, Inc., 4700 Superior Street, Lincoln, NE 6B504. USA.<br>
The apparatuses mentioned lead to a modular procedure in which the individual process steps are automated, but manual operations must be performed between the process steps. This can be prevented by employing semi-integrated or fully integrated automation systems where the automaton modules in question are operated by, for example, nabots. Such automation systems can be obtained, for example, from Zymark Corporation, Zymark Center, Hopkinton, IwSA 01748, USA.<br>
In addition to what has been described here, compounds of the formula (I) may be prepared in part or fully by solid-phase-supported methods. For this purpose, individual intermediate steps or all intermediate steps of the synthesis or of a synthesis adapted to suit the procedure in question are bound to a synthetic resin. Solid-phase-supported synthesis methods are described extensively in the specialist literature, for example Barry A. Bunin in "The Combinatorial index". Academic Press, 1998.<br>
The use of solid-phase-supported synthesis methods pennits a series of protocols which are known from the literature and which, in turn, can be performed manually or in an automated manner. For example, the "tea-bag method" (Houghten, US 4,631.211; Houghten et al,. Proc. Nat!. Acad. Sci, 1985, 82, 5131-5135), in which products by IRORl. 11149 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA, are employed, may be semiautomated. The automation of solid-phase-supported parallel syntheses is performed successfully, for example, by apparatuses by Argonaut Technologies, Inc., 887 Industrial Road, San Carlos, CA 94070, USA or MultiSynTech GmbH, WuHener Feld 4. 5B454 Witten, Gemiany.<br><br>

In a further aspect of the invention Vne compounds of formula (I) or salts or compositions thereof are used for the preparation of a veterinary medicament.<br>
In practical use for the control of arthropods, especially insects or arachnids, such as mites, or helminths, such as nematode pests of plants, a method, for example, comprises applying to the plants or to the medium in which they grow an effective amount of a compound of the invention. For such a method, the compound of the invention is generally applied to the focus in v4iich the arthropod or nematode infestation is to be controlled af an effective rate in the range of about 2g to about 1kg vf the active compound perhectareof locus treated. Under ideal conditions, depending on the pest to be controlled, a lower rate may offer adequate protection. On the other hand, adverse weather conditions, resistance of the pest or other factors may require that the active ingredient be used at higher rates. The optimum rate depends usually upon a number of factors, for example, the type of pest being controlled, the type or the growth stage of the infested plant, the rov/ spacing or also the method of application. Preferably an effective rate range of the active compound is from about 10g/ba to about 400g/ha, more preferably from about SOgflia to about 200 g/ha.<br>
\Mien a pest is soil-borne, the active compound, generally in a fonnulated composition, is distributed evenly over the area to be treated (for example broadcast or band treatment) in any convenient manner and is applied at rates from about 10g/ha to about 400g ai/ha, preferably from about 50g/ha to about 200 g ai/ha, V".tien applied as a root dip to seedlings or drip irrigation to plants the liquid solution or suspension contains from about 0.075 to about 1000 mg al/l, preferably from<br><br>
about 25 to about 200 mg ai/l. Application may be made, if desired, to the field or crop-growing area generally or in close proximity to the seed or plant to be protected fror^ attack. The compound of the rnuention can be washed into the soil by spraying with water over the area or can be left to the natural action of rainfall. During or after application, the formulated compound can, if desired, be distributed mechanically in the soil, for example by ploughing, disking, or use of drag chains. Application can be prior to planting, at planting, after planting but before sprouting has taken place, or after sprouting.<br>
The compound of the invention and methods of control of pests therewith are of particular value in the protection (^ field, forage, plantation, glasshouse, orchard or vineyard crops, of ornamentals, or of plantation or forest trees, for example: cereals {such as wheat or rice), cotton, vegetables (such as peppers), field crops (such as sugar beets, soybeans or oil seed rape), grassland or forage crops (such as maize or sorghum), orchards or groves (such as of stone or pit fmit or citrus), ornamental plants,.flowers or vegetables or shrubs under glass or in gardens or parks, or foicst trees (both deciduous and evergreen) in forests, plantations or nurseries. They are also valuable in the protection of timber (standing, felled, converted, stored or. stnjclural) from attack, for example, by sawrflies or beetles or temjites. They have applications in the protection of stored products such as grains, fruits, nuts, spices or tobacco, whether whole, milled or compounded into products, from moth, beetle, mite or grain weevil attack. Also protected are stored animal products such as skins, hair, wool or feathers in natural or converted form (e.g. as carpets or textiles) from moth or beetle attack as well as stored meat, fish or grains from beetle, mite or fly attack.<br>
Additionally, the compound of the invention and methods of use thereof are of particular value in the control of arthropods or helminths which are injurious to, or spread or act as vectors of diseases domestic animals, for example those hereinbefore mentioned, and more especially in the control of ticks, mifes, lice, fleas, midges, or biting, nuisance or myiasis flies. The compounds of the invention are particularly useful in controlling arthropods or helminths which are present insic-domestic host animals or which feed in or on the skin or suck the blood of the<br><br>
animal, for which purpose they may be administered orally, parenterady, percutaneousiy or topically.<br>
The compositions hereinafter described for application to growing crops or crop growing loci or as a seed dressing may, in general, alternatively be employed in the protection of stored products, household goods, property or areas of the general environment. Suitable means of applying the compounds of the invention include: to growing crops as foliar sprays (for example as an in-furrow spray), dusts, granules, fogs or foams or also as suspensions of finely divided or encapsulated compositions as soil or root treatments by liquid drenches, dusts, granules, smokes or foams; to seeds of crops via application as seed dressings by liquid slurries or dusts;<br>
to animals infested by or exposed to infestation by arthropods or helminths, by parenteral, oral or topical applicafion of compositions in which the active ingredient exhibits an immediate and/or prolonged action over a period of time against the arthropods or helminths, for example by incorporation in feed or suitable orally-ingestible pharmaceuticai formulations, edible baits, salt licks, dietary supplements, pour-on formulations, sprays, baths, dips, showers, jets, dusts, greases, shampoos, creams, wax smears or livestock self-treatment systems;<br>
to the environment in general or to specific locations where pests may lurk, including stored products, timber, household goods, or domestic or industrial premises, as sprays, fogs, dusts,, smokes, wax-smears, lacquers, granules or baits, or in trickiefeeds to waterways, wells, reservoirs or other running or standing water.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are particularly useful for the control of parasites of animals when applied orally, and in a further preferred aspect of the invention the compounds of formula (i) are used for the control of parasites of animals by oral application. The compounds of the formula (1) or salts thereof may be administered before, during or after meals. The compounds of the formula (I) or salts thereof may be mixed with a carrier and/or foodstuff.<br>
The compound of the formula (1) or salt thereof is administered orally in a dose+■-&gt; the animal in a dose range generally from 0.1 to 500 mg/kg of the compound of the fonnula (1) or salt thereof per kilogram of animal body vi/eight (mg/kg).<br><br>
The frequency of treatment of the animal, preferably the domestic animal to be treated by the compound of the formula (1) or salt thereof is generally from about once per week to about once per year, preferably from about once every two weeks to once every three months.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered most advantageously with another parasiticidally effective material, sudi as an endoparasitlcide, and/or an ector^rasiticide, and/or an endectoparasiticide. For example, such compounds include macrocyclic lactones such as avemiectins or milbemycins e.g., ivermectin, pyratel or an insect growth regulator such as lufenuron or methoprene.<br>
The compounds of the formula (1) can also be empioyed for controiltng pests in crops of known genetically engineered plants or genetically engineered plants yet to be developed. As a rule, the transgenic plants are distinguished by especially advantageous properties, for example by resistances to particular crop protection agents, resistances to plant diseases or pathogens of plant diseases, such as particular insects or microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria or viruses. Other particular properties concern, for example, the han/ested material with regard to quantity, quality, storage properties, composition and specific constituents. Thus, transgenic plants are known where the starch content is increased, or the starch quality is altered, or where the harvested materia! has a different fatty acid composition.<br>
The use in economically important transgenic crops of useful plants and ornamentals is preferred, for example of cereals such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, millet, rice, cassava and maize or else crops of sugar beet, cotton, soya, oilseed rape, potatoes, tomatoes, peas and other types of vegetables.<br>
When used in transgenic crops. In particular those which have resistances to insects, effects are frequently observed, in addition to the effects against pests to be observed in other crops, which are specific for application in tfie transgenic crop in question, for example an altered or specifically wridened spectrum of pests<br><br>
which can be controlled, or altered application rates which may be employed for application.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to the use of compounds of the formula (1&gt; for controlling pests in transgenic crop plants-<br>
According to a further feature of the present invention there is provided a pesticida! composition comprising one or more compounds of the invention as defined above, in association with, and preferably homogeneously dispersed in one or more compatible pesticidally acceptable diluents or earners and/or surface active agents [i.e. diluents or carriers and/or surface active agents of the type generally accepted in the art as being suitable for use in pesticidal compositions and which are compatible with compounds of the invention].<br>
In practice, the compounds of the invention most frequently fonrs parts of compositions. These compositions can be employed to control arthropods, especially insects and arachnids, such as mites, or helminths, such as plant nemathodes. The compositions may be of any type known in the art suitable for application to the desired pest in any premises or indoor or outdoor area. These compositions contiiln at least one compound of the invention as the active ingredient in combination or association with one or more ottier compatible components which are for example, solid or liquid carriers or diluents, adjuvants, surface-active-agents, or the like appropriate for the intended use and which are agronomically or medicinally acceptable. These compositions, which may be prepared by any manner known in the art, likewise form a part of this invention.<br>
The compounds of the invention, in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms prepared from these fomiulations may be present in mixtures with other active substances such as insecticides, attractants, sterilants, acarictdes, nematicides, fungicides, growth regulatory substances or herbicides.<br>

The abovementioned components for combinations are known active substances, many of which are described in Ch.R Worthing, S.B. Walker, The Pesticide Manual, 12"" Edition, British Crop Protection Council, Farnham 2000,<br>
The effective use doses of the compounds employed in the invention can vary within wide limits, particularly depending on the nature of the pest to be elifninated or degree of infestation, for example, of crops with these pests. In generaf, the compositions according to the invention usually contain about 0.05 to about 95% (by weight) of one or more active ingredients according to the invention, about 1 to about 95% of one or more solid or liquid carriers and, optionally, about 0.1 to about 50^o of one or more other compatible components, such as surface-active agents or the like. In the present account, the term "carrier" denotes an organic or inorganic ingredient. Ht^itiral or synthetic, with which the active ingredient is combined to facilitate its application, for example, to the plant, to seeds or to the soil. This carrier is therefore generally inert and it must be acceptable (for example, agronomically acceptable, parficufarly to the treated plant).<br>
The carrier may be a solid, for example, days, natural or synthetic silicates, silica, resins, waxes, solid fertilizers (for example ammonium salts), ground natural minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmoritionite, bentonite or diatomaceous earth, or ground synthetic minerals, such as silica, alumina, or silicates espedally aluminium or magnesium silicates. As solid carriers for granules the following are suitable: crushed or fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepioIJte and dolomte; synthetic granules of inorganic or<br><br>
organic meals; granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, corn cobs, com husks or tobacco stalks; kiese/guhr, tricatclum phosphate, powdered cork, or absorbent carbon black; water soluble polymers, resins, waxes; or solid fertilizers. Such solid compositions may, if desired, contain nne or more compatible wetting, dispersing, emulsifying or colouring agents which, when solid, may also serve as a diluent.<br>
The carrier may also be liquid, for exampie: water, alcohols, pariicuiariy butanoi or glycol, as well as their ethers or esters, particularly methylglyco! acetate; ketones, particularly acetone, cyciohexanone, methylethyl ketone, methylisobutylketone, or isophorone; petroleum fractions such as paraifinic or aromatic hydrocarbons, particularly xylenes or alkyl naphthalenes; mineral or vegetable oils; aliphatic chlorinated hydrocarbons, particularly trichloroethane or methylene chloride; aromatic chlorinated hydrocarbons, particularly chlorobenzenes; water-soluble or strongly polar solvents such as dimethytfomiamide, dimethyl sulphoxide, or N-methylpyrrolidone; liquefied gases; or the like or a mixture thereof. The surface-active agent may be an emulsifying agent, dispersing agent or wetting agent of the ionic or non^ionic type or a mixture of such surface-active agents. Amongst these are e.g., salts of polyacrylic acids, salts of lignosulphonic acids, salts of phenolsulphonic or naphtha lenesuiphonic acids, polycondensates of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols or fatty acids or fatty esters or fatty amines, substituted phenols (particularly atkyfphenols orarylphenols), salts of sulphosuccinic acid esters, la" ;"ine derivatives (particularly alkyltaurates), phosphoric esters of alcohols or of polycondensates of ethylene oxide with phenols, esters of fatty acids with polyols, or sulphate, sulphonate or phosphate functional derivatives of the above compounds-The presence of at least one surface-active agent is generally essential when the active ingredient and/or the inert earner are only slightly water soluble or are not water soluble and the carrier agent of the compositron for application is water. Compositions of the invention may further contain other additives such as adhesives or colorants- Adhesives such as carboxymethylcellulose or natural or synthetic poiiwiers in the form of powders, granules or lattices, such as arable gum, polyvinyl alcohol or polyvinyl acetate, natural phospholipids, such as cephalins or lecithins, or synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. It is possible to use<br><br>
colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example: iron oxides, titanium oxides or Prussian Blue; organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs or metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs; or trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum or zinc.<br>
For their agricultural application, the compounds of the invention are therefore generally in the form of compositions, which are in various solid or liquid fonms. Solid forms of compositions v/hich can be used are dusting powders (with a content of tl--. compound of the invention, ranging up to 80%), wettabie powders or granules (including water dispersiblegranules), particularly those obtained by extrusion, compacting, impregnation of a granular carrier, or granulation starting from a powder (the content of the compound of the invention, in these wettabie powders or granules being between about 0,5 and about 80%). Solid homogenous or heterogenous compositions containing one or more compounds of the invention, for example granules, pellets, briquettes or capsules, may be used to treat standing or running water over a period of time. A similar effect may be achieved using trickle or intermittent feeds of water dispersible concentrates as described herein. Liquid compositions, for example, include aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions (such as emulsifiabte concentrates, ervuls"ions, flowabJes, dispersions, or solutions) or aerosols. Liquid compositions also indude, in particular, emuteifiable concentrates, dispersions, emulsions, flowables. aerosols, wettabie powders {or powder for spraying), dry flowables or pastes as fomis of compositions which are liquid or intended to fomi liquid compositions when applied, for example as aqueous spr.-ys (including low and ultra-low volume) or as fogs or aerosols. Liquid compositions, for example, in the fonn of emulsifiable or soluble concentrates most frequently comprise about 5 to about 80% by weight of the active ingredient, while the emulsions or solutions which are ready for application contain, in their case, about 0.01 to about 20% of the active ingredient. Besides the solvent, the emulsifiable or soluble concentrates may contain, when required, ab"out 2 to about 50% of suitable additives, such as stabilizers, surface-active agents, penetrating agents, corrosion inhibitors, colorants or adhesives. Emulsions of any required concentration, which are particularly suitable for application, for example, to plants, may be obtained from these concentrates by dilution with water. These<br><br>
compositions are included within the scope of the compositions which may be employed in the present invention. The emulsions may be in the form of vi"ater-in-oil or oil-jn-water type and they may have a thick consistency. The liquid compositions of this invention may, in addition to normai agriculturai ust.-applications be used for example to treat substrates or sites infested or liable to infestation by arthropods (oi other pests controiled by compounds of this invention) incl"iding premises, outdoor or indoor storage or processing areas, containers or equipment or standing or mnniiig water.<br>
All these aqueous dispersions or emulsions or spraying mixtures can be applied, for example, to crops by any suitable means, chiefly by spraying, at rates vMch are generally of the order of about 100 to about 1,200 liters of spraying mixture per hectare, but may be higher or lower (eg, low or ultra-low volume) depending upon the need or application technique. The compound or compositions according to the invention are conveniently applied to vegetation and in particular to roots or leaves having pests to be eliminated. Another method of application of the compounds or compositions according to the invention is by chemigation, that is to say, the addition of a formuiation containing the active ingredient to irrigation water. This irrigation may be sprinkler irrigation for foliar pesticides or it can be ground irrigation or underground irrigation for soil or for systemic pesticides.<br>
The concentrated suspensions, wfhich can be applied by spraying, are prepared so as to produce a stable fluid product which does not settle (fine grinding) and usually contain from about 10 to about 75% by weight of active ingredient, from about 0.5 to about 30% of surface-active agents, from about 0.1 to about 10% of thixotropic agents, from about 0 to about 30% of suitable additives, such as anti-foaming agents, corrosion inhibitors, stabilizers, penetrating agents, adhesives and, as the carrier, v/ater or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient is poorly soluble or insoluble Some organic solids or inorganic salts may be dissolved in the carrier to help prevent settling or as antifreezes for water.<br>
The wettable powers (or powder for graying) are usually prepared so that they contain from about 10 to about 80% by weight of active ingredient, from about 20 to about 90% of a solid carrier, from about 0 to about 5% of a wetting agent, from about 3 to about 10%of a dispersing agent and, when necessary, from atjout 0 to about<br><br>
80% of one or more stabilizers and/or other additives, such as penetrating agents, adhesives, anti-caking agents, colorants, or the like. To obtain these wettable powders, the active ingredient is thoroughly mixed in a suitabie blender with additional substances which may be impregnated on the porous filler and is ground using a mill or other suitable grinder. This produces wettabie powders, the ■wettability and the suspendabtlity of vMch are advantageous. They may be suspended in water to give any desired concentration and this suspension can be employed very advantageously in particular for application io plant foliage. Tt^e "water dispersible gtanySes (WG)" (granules which are readily dispersible in water) have compositions which are substantially close to that of the vi^ttable powders. They may be prepared by granulation of formulations described for the wettable powders, either by a wet route (contacting finely divided active ingredient with the inert filler and a little water, e.g. 1 to 20% by weight, or with an aqueous solution of 3 dispersing agent or binder, followed by drying and screening), or by a dry route (compacting foliowed by grinding and screening).<br>
The rates and concentrations of the formulated compositions may vary according to the method of application or the nature of the compositions or use thereof. Generally speaking, the compositions for application to control arthropod or plant nematode pests usually contain from about 0.00001% to about 95%, more particularly from about 0.0005% io about 50% by weight of one or more compounds of the invention, or of total active ingredients (that is to say the compounds of the invention, together wit! &gt; other substances toxic to arthropods or plant nematodes, synergists, trace elements or stabiiizers). The actual compositions employed and their rate of application will be selected to achieve the desired ef}ec:t{s) by the farmer, livestock producer, medical or veterinary practitioner, pest control operator or other person skilled in the art.<br>
Solid or liquid compositions for application topically to animals, timber, stored products or household goods usually contain frorr abcmf 0.00005% to about 90%, more particularly from about 0.001% to about 10%, by weight of one or more compounds of the invention. For administration to animals orally or parenterally. including percutaneously solid or liquid compositions, these normally contain from about 0-1% to about 90% by weight of one or more compounds of the invention,<br><br>
Medicated feedstuffs normally contain from about 0,001% to about 3% by weight of one or more compounds of the invention. Concentrates or supplements for mixing with feedstuffs normally contain from about 5% to about 90%, preferably from about 5% to about 50%, by weight of one or more compounds of the invention. Mineral saltlicks normally contain from about 0.1% to about 10%by weight of one or more compounds of formula (I) or pesticidally acceptable salts thereof.    . Dusts or liquid compositions for application to livestock, goods, premises or outdoor areas may contain ft"om about 0.0001% to about 15%, more especially from about 0.005% to about 2.0%, by weight, of one or more compounds of ttie invention. Suitable concentrations in treated waters are between about 0.0001 ppm and about 20 ppm, more particularly about 0.001 ppm to about 5,0 ppm. of one or more compounds of the invention, and may be used therapeutically in fish fanning with appropriate exposure times. Edible bails may contain from about 0.01% to about 5%, preferably from about 0,01% to about 1.0%, by weight, of one or more compounds of the invention.<br>
When administered to vertebrates parenterally, orally or by percutaneous or other means, the dosage of compounds of the invention, will depend upon the species, age, or health of the vertebrate and upon the nature and degree of its actual or potential infestation by arthropod or helminth pests. A single dose of about 0.1 to about 100 mg, preferably about 2.0 to about 20,0 mg, per kg body weight of the animal ot doses of about 0,01 to about 20.0 mg, preferably about 0,1 to about 5,0 mg, per kg body weight of the animal per day, for sustained medication, are generally suitable by oral or parenteral administration, By use of sustained release formulations or devices, the daily doses required over a period of months may b° combined and administered to animals on a single occasion.

METHODS OF PESTiClDAL USE<br>
The following representative test procedures, using compounds of the invention, were conducted to determine the parasiticidal and pesticidal activity of compounds of the invention.<br>
METHOD A: Screening method to test systemicity of compounds against Ctenocephalides felis (Cat flea)<br>
A test container was filled with 10 aduits of Ctenocephalides felis. A glass cylinder was closed on one end with parafilm and placed on top of the test container. The test compound solution was then pipetted into bovine blood and added to the glass cylinder. The treated Ctenocephalides felis were held in this artificial dog test (blood 37 "C, 40-60 % relative humidity; Ctenocephalides felts 20-22""C, 40-60 % relative humidity) and assessment performed at 24 and 48 hours after application. Active compounds gave at least 90% control of Ctenocephalides felis at a test concentration of 5ppm or less.<br>
METHOD 8: Diabrotica undecimpunctata (southern corn rootworm) screen Two days before application, seeds of maize v/ere soaked in vrater under warm conditions to elicit fast germination. One day before application, eggs of Diabrotica undecimpunctata were transferred to one half of a Japanese filter paper placed in a plastic petri dish. Afterwards, a sprouted maize seed was placed on a moistened pad beside the filler paper. Three drops of 200 microlitres of test compound solution were carefuily pipetted onto the egg. The remainder of the solution was placed on the maize and then the Petri dish was closed. The treated eggs in the Petri dishes were held in a climate chamber for 6 days. The compound efficacy (percentage of dead eggs and/or larvae in comparison to untreated control) was assessed 6 days after application using a binocular microscope.<br>
Active compounds gave at least 90% control of Diabrotica undecimpunctata at a test concentration of 10ppm.<br>
METHOD C: Nephotettrx Cinciceps (rice leafhopper) screen<br><br>
The leaves of 12 rice plants having a stem length of 8 cm were dipped for 5 seconds into an aqueous soiution of the formulated test compound. After the solution had mn off, the rice plants treated in this manner were placed in a Petri dish and populated with about 20 larvae (L3 stage) of Nephotettrx cincticeps. The Petri dish was CIOSLJ and then stored in a climate chamber (16 hours of light/day, 25°C, 40-60% relative humidity). After 6 days storage, the percentage mortality of leafhopper lawae was determined.<br>
Active compounds gave at least 98% mortality of Nephotettix cinciceps larvae at a test concentration of 100 ppm.<br>
METHOD D: Screening method to test contad activity against Ctenocephalides felts<br>
