				<td>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[OOO1] This application claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 119 from Korean Patent<br>
Application No. 2005-50254, filed on June 13., 2005, the entire content of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to a novel silicone release composition and a<br>
silicone release plastic film using the same. More particularly, the present invention<br>
relates to a silicone release polyester film having excellent stability over time and rub-<br>
off property after aging.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
[0003] In general, a silicone release agent includes a silicone backbone, silicone<br>
curing agent and a catalyst. The silicone backbone comprises vinylpolysiloxane or vinyl<br>
group-containing hexenylpolysiloxane and the curing agent comprises hydrogen<br>
polysiloxane.<br><br>
[0004] Typically, a release layertmay be obtained by applying a release agent onto a<br>
substrate such as a plastic film or sheet, paper or non-woven cloth. According to US<br>
Patent Nos. 3,076,726, 3,169,884, 3,427,270, 3,900,617, etc., it is known that a silicone<br>
layer is applied on a substrate such as a plastic film, cellulose film or paper by using a<br>
silicone bath. Additionally, US Patent Nos. 4,667,160 and 5,672,428 disclose the use of<br>
a silane coupling agent for improving adhesion between a silicone layer and a substrate.<br>
However, such silane coupling agen:s are problematic in that they are separated out of<br>
silicone layers and polyester substrates due to their poor chemical resistance and bath<br>
life of coating solution (stability of coating solution). Moreover, it is difficult to produce<br>
a silicone release film over a long time by using a coating bath once formed. Briefly,<br>
the materials or methods disclosed in the above patents ensuring silicone release<br>
property have problems in that it is difficult to carry out release coating for a long time<br>
because of poor bath life of coating solution over time.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] Therefore, the present invention has been made to solve the above-<br>
mentioned problems occurring in the prior art. It is an object of the present invention to<br><br>
provide a release composition that comprises a silane coupling agent having a<br>
unique structure for improving adhesion to a polyester substrate, chemical<br>
resistance and coating solution bath life.<br>
[0006] It is another object of the present invention to provide a plastic film<br>
coated with the above release composition,<br>
[0007] According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
silicone release composition comprising a polysiloxane, silane having at least<br>
one epoxycyclohexyl group, surfacttant and a catalyst.<br>
[0008] According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided<br>
a release plastic film such as polyester film coated with the above composition<br>
in an in-line coating mode.<br>
The present invention relates to a silicone release composition comprising<br>
a polysiloxane having the formula -<br><br>
wherein R1 is -CH = CH2, -Si{CH3)3 or CE3, B2 is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH = CH2 or CH3, R3<br>
is CH3 or H, and each of p and q represents an integer of 0 or more that allows<br>
a polymer structure, and a silans having at least one epoxycyclohexyl group,<br>
wherein the ratio of epoxysilane and polysiloxane varies between 50:1 and 1:20 <br>
by weight, along with a surfactant and a catalyst such as herein described.<br>
This invention also relates to a plastic release film coated with the<br>
silicone release composition as defined above onto either or both surfaces of a<br>
plastic film to a predetermined coating thickness, through an in-line coating<br>
step during a manufacturing process of the plastic film, in order to form a<br>
silicone release layer.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0009] The above aspect and features of the present invention will be more<br>
apparent by describing certain embodiments of the present invention with reference<br>
to the accompanying drawings, in which :<br>
[0010] FIG. 1 is a schematic view showing how to test curing characteristics of<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0011] We have found that when a silane compound having at least one<br>
epoxycyclohexyl group (for example, beta-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)-alkyltrialkoxysilane<br>
or beta-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)-alkyltr acetoxysilane) is added to a silicone release<br>
composition and the resultant release composition is applied on a substrate such as<br>
polyester film, it is possible to obtain a release film that has remarkably improved<br>
interfacial adhesion between the polyester film and release coating as well as excellent<br>
peel strength. The surfactant is, preferably polyether or lauryl ether, and the catalyst is<br>
preferably platinum, rhodium or tin<br>
[0012] In one preferred embodiment according to the present invention, the silicone<br>
release composition comprises 4-30 wt% of hexenylpolysiloxane or vinylpolysiloxane<br>
as release agent, 0.3-3 wt% of hydrogen polysiloxane, 0.002-0.005 wt% of a platinum<br>
catalyst and 0.003-0.5 wt% of beta-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)-alkyltrialkoxysilane orbeta-<br>
(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)-alkyltriacetoxys lane.<br><br>
[0013] Preferably, the silane confound having epoxycyclohexyl groups is present<br>
in the composition in an amount of 08. -10 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight<br>
of polysiloxane.<br>
[0014] The vinylpolysiloxane as release agent has an average particle diameter of<br>
between 0.01 and 1 M. The silicone release composition according to the present<br>
invention may be applied directly onto various substrates including polyester film,<br>
polypropylene film, polyethylene film, polyvinyl chloride film, nylon film,<br>
polycarbonate film and laminated film comprising the same plastics; Kraft paper; and<br>
nonwoven cloth and woven cloth. Additionally, the composition has a total solid<br>
content preferably of between 4 and 30 wt%, more preferably of between 6 and 20 wt%.<br>
[0015] When the composition has a solid content of less than 4 wt%, uniform<br>
coverage and sufficient release/peel characteristics cannot be obtained.<br>
[0016] Beta-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)-alkyltrialkoxysilane or beta-(3,4-epoxycyclo<br>
hexyl)-alkyltriacetoxysilane is a compound capable of improving interfacial adhesion<br>
between a silicone polymer and a substrate such as PET. When the above silane<br>
compound is used in an amount of between 0.001 and 1 wt%, preferably of between<br>
0.003 and 0.5 wt%, it is possible to ensure stable physical properties. When the above<br><br>
silane compound is used in an amount of less than 0.003 wt%, interfacial adhesion<br>
between a substrate (PET) and silicone is degraded, resulting in generation of unreacted<br>
silicone. On the other hand, when the above silane compound is used in a process for<br>
manufacturing a PET film in an amount of greater than 0.7 wt%, silicone coating film is<br>
cracked during and after an orientation step, resulting in a significant drop in peel<br>
characteristics. Meanwhile, the substrate used in the present invention may be corona<br>
treated or plasma treated before it it; subjected to release coating in order to form a<br>
stronger bond between the substrate and release layer. The substrate has a thickness of 2<br>
mm or less, preferably of between 12 and 1500 m. Additionally, the substrate may be<br>
preliminarily subjected to chemical treatment, on the surface to be coated with a release<br>
layer, by using a currently used primer layer such as beta-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)-<br>
alkyltrialkoxysilane in order to reinforce chemical bonding.<br>
[0017] Preferably, the release composition is applied to a coating thickness of<br>
between 0.1 and 2 m after orientation and drying steps. Additionally, the polyester film<br>
coated with a silicone release composition has a number average surface roughness<br>
suitably of between 0.01 and 2 m, mere preferably of between 0.01 and 1.0 m. When<br>
the coating thickness after drying is greater than 2 m, a so-called blocking phenomenon<br><br>
occurs so that a silicone-coated surface and non-coated surface are caused to be wound<br>
under a certain pressure. Moreover, a so-called rub-off phenomenon occurs after aging<br>
(24 hours, 50 °C, 95% RH). Such rub-off phenomenon of a silicone layer is caused by<br>
insufficient adhesion between a silicone layer and substrate, and is a serious problem in<br>
the case of a release composition free from beta-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)-<br>
alkyltrialkoxysilane, as demonstrated by the following examples and comparative<br>
examples. Meanwhile, the process for heat curing, drying and orienting the lelease<br>
layer-coated substrate is carried out in such a manner that orientation ratio is 2.5-12,<br>
drying/curing temperature ranges from 60 °C to 250°C, drying air flow rate ranges from<br>
8 to 40 m/s, and that retention time in a drier ranges from 0.5 seconds to 10 minutes,<br>
preferably from 1 second to 1 minute.<br>
[0018] Additionally, when the polyester release film obtained by in-line application<br>
of the above silicone release composition is evaluated for thermal stability, it is<br>
preferable that the polyester release film has a heat shrinkage of between 0.5% and<br>
1.5% in the longitudinal direction and of between -0.03% and 1.0% in the transverse<br>
direction. It is more preferable that the polyester release film has a heat shrinkage of<br><br>
between 0.3% and 1% in the longitudinal direction and of between -0.01% and 0.4% in<br>
the transverse direction.<br>
[0019] When the release film has a heat shrinkage of greater than 0.5% in the<br>
transverse direction under conditions of 1500C730 minutes, it is not suitable for<br>
applications using hot-melt adhesives, because each of the silicone layer and polyester<br>
layer of the release film has a different heat conductivity in the transverse direction<br>
upon instant shrinkage or expansion, while a hot-melt adhesive is laminated to the<br>
release film in the vertical direction.<br>
[0020] The beta-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)-alkyl1rialkoxysilane used in the, present<br>
invention has a structure represented by he following formula:<br><br>
wherein n is an integer of 0 or more and p is an integer of 1 or more.<br>
[0021] A typical example of the above compound is represented by the following<br>
formula:<br><br><br>
[0022] Typical examples of the silicone that may be used in the present invention<br>
include the following compounds:<br><br>
wherein Rl is CH=CH2, R2 is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 or CH3, and each of p and<br>
q represents an integer of 0 or more.<br>
[0023] EXAMPLE<br>
[0024] The silicone release composition comprising the compounds represented by<br>
the above formulae was applied ontc a polyester film in an in-line coating mode during<br>
a manufacturing process of the polyester film. Such in-line coating may be carried out<br>
by a gravure coating, wire bar coating, grooved coating, comma coating, or MPG<br>
(Multi-Pressure-Gravure) 5 R/0 or 6 R/0 coating process. The plastic film to be coated<br>
with the silicone release composition is a uni;axially oriented film obtained by corona<br>
treatment or plasma treatment of a non-oriented sheet; a sequentially biaxially oriented<br>
film obtained by corona treatment or plasma treatment and sequential stretching of a<br><br>
non-oriented sheet; or a simultaneously biaxially oriented film obtained by corona<br>
treatment or plasma treatment and simultaneous stretching of a non-oriented sheet.<br>
[0025] The substrate used in this example \vasXD500-23, 30, 38 or 50 m substrate<br>
developed by the present inventcrs and commercially available from TORAY<br>
SAEHAN Co., as release carrier for MLCCs (multi-layer ceramic capacitors).<br>
[0026] Test for Evaluation of Physical Properties<br>
[0027] To measure peel strength, an instrument available from Chem. Instrument,<br>
Co., as Model AR1000 was used. As reference adhesive tape, TESA7475 (trade name)<br>
laminated to the surface of a silicone release film under a load of 2 kgf was used.<br>
Additionally, a convection oven available from Heraeus Co., as Model HC4033 was<br>
used in order to measure peel strength before and after thermal aging. The peel strength<br>
was measured under 180° peel conditions at a peel rate of 0.3 m/minute by using a<br>
sample of 4 cm X 15 cm size, in a measurement region of 100 mm (length) X 25.4 mm<br>
(width). The measured peel strength was expressed in g/inch units and recorded as<br>
average value of five measurements.<br>
[0028] Peel Strength of Adhesive Tape<br><br>
[0029] A film cured after silicone coating was laminated with an adhesive tape<br>
(TESA7425) on its silicone-coated surface under a load of 2 kgf to provide a laminated<br>
film. An iron bar of 70 g/cm2 was disposed on the release film and the resultant<br>
structure was stored under 23°C/50% RH conditions for 24 hours. Then, 180° peel<br>
strength was measured at a peel rate of 0.3 m/minute by using an instrument, AR1000<br>
available from Chem. Instrument, Co.<br>
[0030] Determination of Silicone Curing Characteristics<br>
[0031] A 3M 810 adhesive tape was attached to a silicone release layer and<br>
detached again. Then, a drop of the following test reagent was added on the adhesive<br>
tape and a curing degree was evaluated according to the size of a spot formed by the test<br>
reagent. It is understood that the spot size is determined depending on degrees of<br>
separation of unreacted silicone by the adhesive tape. Generally, when the test reagent is<br>
dropped onto a tape, a relatively large spot is formed. On the contrary, when the test<br>
reagent is dropped onto a tape stained with unreacted silicone, a relatively small spot is<br>
formed.<br>
[0032] Test Reagent= IP A (isopropyl alcohol) + pigment (mixed at a predetermined<br>
ratio). IPA cannot dissolve a silicone-coated surface, while it can dissolve the 3M810<br><br><br>
adhesive tape'. Silicone release layers are graded by spot sizes in terms of "excellent",<br>
"good", "moderate" and "poor" (see, Table 1).<br>
[0033] Rub-Off Properties after Aging<br>
[0034] To evaluate rub-off properties after aging, an instrument available from<br>
JEIOTECH, Co., as model TH-I-18O was used. After a silicone-coated film was stored<br>
under 50°C/95% RH conditions :.br 2 months, the silicone release layer was rubbed<br>
strongly with a finger to perform &amp; rub-off test for measuring a degree of separation of<br>
the silicone layer from a polyester film. From the rub-off test, it was possible to<br>
measure the interfacial adhesion between a cared silicone layer and a PET film.<br>
[0035] Chemical Resistance<br>
[0036] To measure chemical resistance, a stick with a cotton tip was wetted with<br>
MEK (methyl ethyl ketone), toluene, IPA (isopropyl alcohol) or 1,4-BD (1,4-<br>
butanediol), and then a silicone coating layer was rubbed strongly with the cotton tip to<br>
determine whether silicone was separated or not.<br><br><br><br>
[0038] As can be seen from Table 1, silicone release compositions comprising beta-<br>
(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)-ethyltrimethoxysilane according to Examples 1-3 provide<br>
excellent interfacial adhesion and release properties when they are coated on the surface<br>
of a corona-treated polyester film. Particularly, in the silicone release compositions<br>
according to Examples 1-3, the silicone release layers show improved interfacial<br>
adhesion by virtue of chemical bonding, and thus are easily peeled off after the<br>
lamination with a reference adhesive tape. Additionally, the silicone release layers show<br>
excellent solvent resistance and stability over time, as can be seen from the above test<br>
wherein each silicone release layer is rubbed strongly with a finger after being stored<br>
under 50°C/95% RH conditions for 2 months,<br><br>
[0039] On the contrary, silicone release compositions free from beta-(3,4-<br>
epoxycyclohexyl)-ethyltrimethoxysilane according to Comparative Examples 1-3 show<br>
a so-called ribbing phenomenon (defects in the form of stripes) when they are coated on<br>
a substrate and provide unstable peel strength and poor stability over time, Comparative<br>
Examples 1-3 provide data showing variations in physical properties and stability over<br>
time depending on the viscosity and coating thickness (after drying) of wet silicone<br>
release compositions not using beta-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)-ethyltrimethoxysilane.<br>
According to the data, the so-called rub-off phenomenon becomes serious as coating<br>
thickness increases.<br>
[0040] As can be seen from the above Example, beta-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)-<br>
alkyltrialkoxysilane or beta-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)-alkyltriacetoxysilane used in the<br>
present invention ensures smoothness of a release coating layer and uniform interfacial<br>
adhesion between a polyester substrate and a silicone release layer. Additionally,<br>
although it is generally difficult to prevent generation of static electricity and to ensure<br>
flowability at the backside of the polyester substrate opposite to the silicone-coated<br>
surface, the silicone release composition according to the present invention can be<br>
applied during a manufacturing process of a polyester film in an in-line mode so that at<br><br>
least two steps may be eliminated' from a user process, thereby reducing the overall cost<br>
and preventing problems adversely affecting the product quality.<br>
[0041] Meanwhile, in the case of commercially available silicone, it is not possible<br>
to completely (100%) cure the sillcone release layer. Therefore, it is inevitable that<br>
unreacted hydrogen polysiloxane and vinylpolysiloxane or hexenylpolysiloxane remain<br>
as residues in the release composition according to the present invention. When such<br>
unreacted residues are exposed to the air for a long time, they are electronegatively ("-")<br>
charged, and thus form strong bonds with the electropositively ("+") charged dust or<br>
foreign materials in the air. Such electrochemical bonds may serve as crosslinker<br>
between a release film or release paper and an adhesive. In this case, a release layer with<br>
very high releasability is realized. Moreover, when the release coating bath is used, they<br>
can show excellent curing characieristics and stability in peel strength even if they are<br>
exposed to the exterior with undesirable surroundings.<br>
[0042] Meanwhile, silicone (polysiloxane) has a unique structural characteristic in<br>
that rotational energy between a silicon atom and oxygen atom is substantially 0 kJ. Due<br>
to the above structural characteristic, a conventional silicone release composition shows<br>
poor air permeability after it is coated on a substrate and then dried. In addition to such<br><br><br>
poor air permeability, a conventional silicone release composition shows a delayed rub-<br>
off phenomenon due to the hydrolysis under effect of water generated after the reaction<br>
of polyester with hydrogen polysiloxane as caring agent. In other words, when a dried<br>
silicone release film is subjected to effect of water for a relatively long time and then the<br>
release film is rubbed with a finger, the film is rubbed off significantly. However,<br>
according to the present invention, such problems can be solved by using a silane<br>
coupling agent having a unique molecular structure in a silicone bath. Therefore, when<br>
the silicone release composition according to the present invention is coated on a<br>
polyester substrate and dried, it is possible to obtain excellent interfacial adhesion<br>
between the silicone coating layer and polyester.<br>
[0043] As described above, the release film obtained by coating a silicone release<br>
composition uniformly onto a polyester film during a manufacturing process thereof in<br>
an in-line coating mode can be used as release film with high and preferential quality in<br>
various applications. Such applications include carrier release films used for<br>
manufacturing adhesive labels, polarized films and multi-layer ceramic capacitors; LCD<br>
protection release films that permit lamination with solar control adhesive films;<br><br>
overlaminatioh films; medical patches; FPC (flexible printed circuit) protection films;<br>
electrocardiographs protection films; and the like.<br>
[0044] The foregoing embodiment and advantages are merely exemplary and are<br>
not to be construed as limiting the present invention. The present teaching can be<br>
readily applied to other types of release films. Also, the description of the embodiments<br>
of the present invention is intended to be illustrative, and not to limit the scope of the<br>
claims, and many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art.<br><br><br>

composition as claimed in Claim 1 onto either or both surfaces of<br>
a plastic film to a predetermined coating thickness, through an<br>
in-line coating step dur:.ng a manufacturing process of the plastic<br>
film, in order to form a silicone release layer.<br>
6.	The plastic release film as claimed in Claim 5, wherein the<br>
plastic firm to be coated with the silicone release composition<br>
is a uniaxially oriented film obtained by corona treatment or<br><br>
plasma treatment of a non-orjented sheet; a sequentially biaxially<br>
oriented film obtained by corona treatment or plasma treatment<br>
and sequential stretching of non-oriented sheet; or a simultaneously<br>
biaxially oriented film obtained by corona treatment or plasma<br>
treatment and simultaneous stretching of a non-oriented sheet.<br>
7.	The plastic release film as claimed in Claim 5, wherein the<br>
plastic film is a polyester film, polyethylene film, polypropylene<br>
film, nylon film, polycarbonate film, polyvinyl chloride film,<br>
or a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) film.<br>
8.	The plastic release film as claimed in Claim 5, which has<br>
a coating thickness after drying of between 0.06 m and 2 m.<br>
9.	Silicone release compositions, substantially as hereinbefore<br>
described.<br>
10.	Silicone release plastic films using silicone release<br>
compositions as claimed in Claims 1 to 4 substantially as<br>
hereinbefore described vith particular reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br><br>
Disclosed are a silicone release composition and a silicone release plastic<br>
film using the same. The silicone release composition comprises a vinyl group-<br>
containing polysiloxane, hydrogen polysiloxane, epoxycyclohexyl group-containing<br>
silane, platinum catalyst, and polyether or lauryl ether. When the silicone release<br>
composition is coated on an oriented polyester film during a manufacturing process<br>
there of in an in-line coating mode, a release film having excellent silicone curing<br>
characteristics, interfacial adhesion between a silicone layer and plastic film and peel<br>
characteristics can be obtained.</td>
