Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the encoding of audio signals and the subsequent synthesis of<br>
auditory scenes from the encoded audio data.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
When a person hears an audio signal (i.e., sounds) generated by a particular audio source, the<br>
audio signal will typically arrive at the person's left and right ears at two different times and with two<br>
different audio (e.g., decibel) levels, where those different times and levels are functions of the differences<br>
in the paths through which the audio signal travels to reach the left and right ears, respectively. The<br>
person's brain interprets these differences in time and level to give the person the perception that the<br>
received audio signal is being generated by an audio source located at a particular position (e.g., direction<br>
and distance) relative to the person. An auditory scene is the net effect of a person simultaneously hearing<br>
audio signals generated by one or more different audio sources located at one or more different positions<br>
relative to the person.<br>
The existence of this processing by the brain can be used to synthesize auditory scenes, where<br>
audio signals from one or more different audio sources are purposefully modified to generate left and right<br>
audio signals that give the perception that the different audio sources are located at different positions<br>
relative to the listener.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a high-level block diagram of conventional binaural signal synthesizer 100, which<br>
converts a single audio source signal (e.g., a mono signal) into the left and right audio signals of a binaural<br>
signal, where a binaural signal is defined to be the two signals received at the eardrums of a listener. In<br>
addition to the audio source signal, synthesizer 100 receives a set of spatial cues corresponding to the<br>
desired position of the audio source relative to the listener. In typical implementations, the set of spatial<br>
cues comprises an inter-channel level difference (ICLD) value (which identifies the difference in audio<br>
level between the left and right audio signals as received at the left and right ears, respectively) and an<br>
inter-channel time difference (ICTD) value (which identifies the difference in time of arrival between the<br>
left and right audio signals as received at the left and right ears, respectively). In addition or as an<br>
alternative, some synthesis techniques involve the modeling of a direction-dependent transfer function for<br>
sound from the signal source to the eardrums, also referred to as the head-related transfer function (HRTF).<br>
See, e.g., J. Blauert, The Psychophysics of Human Sound Localization, MIT Press, 1983, the teachings of<br>
which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Using binaural signal synthesizer 100 of Fig. 1, the mono audio signal generated by a single sound<br>
source can be processed such that, when listened to over headphones, the sound source is spatially placed<br>
by applying an appropriate set of spatial cues (e.g., ICLD, ICTD, and/or HRTF) to generate the audio<br>
-2-<br><br>
signal for each ear. See, e.g., D.R. Begault, 3-D Sound for Virtual Reality and Multimedia, Academic<br>
Press, Cambridge, MA, 1994.<br>
Binaural signal synthesizer 100 of Fig. 1 generates the simplest type of auditory scenes: those<br>
having a single audio source positioned relative to the listener. More complex auditory scenes comprising<br>
two or more audio sources located at different positions relative to the listener can be generated using an<br>
auditory scene synthesizer that is essentially implemented using multiple instances of binaural signal<br>
synthesizer, where each binaural signal synthesizer instance generates the binaural signal corresponding to<br>
a different audio source. Since each different audio source has a different location relative to the listener, a<br>
different set of spatial cues is used to generate the binaural audio signal for each different audio source.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to one embodiment, the present invention is a method and apparatus for converting an<br>
input audio signal having an input temporal envelope into an output audio signal having an output<br>
temporal envelope. The input temporal envelope of the input audio signal is characterized. The input<br>
audio signal is processed to generate a processed audio signal, wherein the processing de-correlates the<br>
input audio signal. The processed audio signal is adjusted based on the characterized input temporal<br>
envelope to generate the output audio signal, wherein the output temporal envelope substantially matches<br>
the input temporal envelope.<br>
According to another embodiment, the present invention is a method and apparatus for encoding C<br>
input audio channels to generate E transmitted audio channel(s). One or more cue codes are generated for<br>
two or more of the C input channels. The C input channels are downmixed to generate the E transmitted<br>
channel(s), where OE&gt;\. One or more of the C input channels and the E transmitted channel(s) are<br>
analyzed to generate a flag indicating whether or not a decoder of the E transmitted channel(s) should<br>
perform envelope shaping during decoding of the E transmitted channel(s).<br>
According to another embodiment, the present invention is an encoded audio bitstream generated<br>
by the method of the previous paragraph.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In binaural cue coding (BCC), an encoder encodes C input audio channels to generate E<br>
transmitted audio channels, where C&gt;£&gt;1. In particular, two or more of the C input channels are provided<br>
in a frequency domain, and one or more cue codes are generated for each of one or more different<br>
frequency bands in the two or more input channels in the frequency domain. In addition, the C input<br>
channels are downmixed to generate the E transmitted channels. In some downmixing implementations, at<br>
least one of the E transmitted channels is based on two or more of the C input channels, and at least one of<br>
the E transmitted channels is based on only a single one of the C input channels.<br>
In one embodiment, a BCC coder has two or more filter banks, a code estimator, and a downmixer.<br>
The two or more filter banks convert two or more of the C input channels from a time domain into a<br>
frequency domain. The code estimator generates one or more cue codes for each of one or more different<br>
frequency bands in the two or more converted input channels. The downmixer downmixes the C input<br>
channels to generate the E transmitted channels, where C&gt;£&gt;1.<br>
In BCC decoding, E transmitted audio channels are decoded to generate C playback audio<br>
channels. In particular, for each of one or more different frequency bands, one or more of the E<br>
transmitted channels are upmixed in a frequency domain to generate two or more of the C playback<br>
channels in the frequency domain, where OE&gt;\. One or more cue codes are applied to each of the one or<br>
more different frequency bands in the two or more playback channels in the frequency domain to generate<br>
two or more modified channels, and the two or more modified channels are converted from the frequency<br>
domain into a time domain. In some upmixing implementations, at least one of the C playback channels is<br>
based on at least one of the E transmitted channels and at least one cue code, and at least one of the C<br>
playback channels is based on only a single one of the E transmitted channels and independent of any cue<br>
codes.<br>
In one embodiment, a BCC decoder has an upmixer, a synthesizer, and one or more inverse filter<br>
banks. For each of one or more different frequency bands, the upmixer upmixes one or more of the E<br>
transmitted channels in a frequency domain to generate two or more of the C playback channels in the<br>
frequency domain, where OE&gt;\. The synthesizer applies one or more cue codes to each of the one or<br>
more different frequency bands in the two or more playback channels in the frequency domain to generate<br>
two or more modified channels. The one or more inverse filter banks convert the two or more modified<br>
channels from the frequency domain into a time domain.<br>
-5-<br><br>
Depending on the particular implementation, a given playback channel may be based on a single<br>
transmitted channel, rather than a combination of two or more transmitted channels. For example, when<br>
there is only one transmitted channel, each of the C playback channels is based on that one transmitted<br>
channel. In these situations, upmixing corresponds to copying of the corresponding transmitted channel.<br>
As such, for applications in which there is only one transmitted channel, the upmixer may be implemented<br>
using a replicator that copies the transmitted channel for each playback channel.<br>
BCC encoders and/or decoders may be incorporated into a number of systems or applications<br>
including, for example, digital video recorders/players, digital audio recorders/players, computers, satellite<br>
transmitters/receivers, cable transmitters/receivers, terrestrial broadcast transmitters/receivers, home<br>
entertainment systems, and movie theater systems.<br>
Generic BCC Processing<br>
Fig. 2 is a block diagram of a generic binaural cue coding (BCC) audio processing system 200<br>
comprising an encoder 202 and a decoder 204. Encoder 202 includes downmixer 206 and BCC estimator<br>
208.<br>
Downmixer 206 converts C input audio channels x,(n) into E transmitted audio channels yi(n),<br>
where C&gt;E&gt;]. In this specification, signals expressed using the variable n are time-domain signals, while<br>
signals expressed using the variable k are frequency-domain signals. Depending on the particular<br>
implementation, downmixing can be implemented in either the time domain or the frequency domain.<br>
BCC estimator 208 generates BCC codes from the C input audio channels and transmits those BCC codes<br>
as either in-band or out-of-band side information relative to the E transmitted audio channels. Typical<br>
BCC codes include one or more of inter-channel time difference (ICTD), inter-channel level difference<br>
(ICLD), and inter-channel correlation (ICC) data estimated between certain pairs of input channels as a<br>
function of frequency and time. The particular implementation will dictate between which particular pairs<br>
of input channels, BCC codes are estimated.<br>
ICC data corresponds to the coherence of a binaural signal, which is related to the perceived width<br>
of the audio source. The wider the audio source, the lower the coherence between the left and right<br>
channels of the resulting binaural signal. For example, the coherence of the binaural signal corresponding<br>
to an orchestra spread out over an auditorium stage is typically lower than the coherence of the binaural<br>
signal corresponding to a single violin playing solo. In general, an audio signal with lower coherence is<br>
usually perceived as more spread out in auditory space. As such, ICC data is typically related to the<br>
apparent source width and degree of listener envelopment. See, e.g., J. Blauert, The Psychophysics of<br>
Human Sound Localization, MIT Press, 1983.<br>
-6-<br><br>
Depending on the particular application, the E transmitted audio channels and corresponding BCC<br>
codes may be transmitted directly to decoder 204 or stored in some suitable type of storage device for<br>
subsequent access by decoder 204. Depending on the situation, the term "transmitting" may refer to either<br>
direct transmission to a decoder or storage for subsequent provision to a decoder. In either case, decoder<br>
204 receives the transmitted audio channels and side information and performs upmixing and BCC<br>
synthesis using the BCC codes to convert the E transmitted audio channels into more than E (typically, but<br>
not necessarily, Q playback audio channels xt(n) for audio playback. Depending on the particular<br>
implementation, upmixing can be performed in either the time domain or the frequency domain.<br>
In addition to the BCC processing shown in Fig. 2, a generic BCC audio processing system may<br>
include additional encoding and decoding stages to further compress the audio signals at the encoder and<br>
then decompress the audio signals at the decoder, respectively. These audio codecs may be based on<br>
conventional audio compression/decompression techniques such as those based on pulse code modulation<br>
(PCM), differential PCM (DPCM), or adaptive DPCM (ADPCM).<br>
When downmixer 206 generates a single sum signal (i.e., £=1), BCC coding is able to represent<br>
multi-channel audio signals at a bitrate only slightly higher than what is required to represent a mono audio<br>
signal. This is so, because the estimated ICTD, ICLD, and ICC data between a channel pair contain about<br>
two orders of magnitude less information than an audio waveform.<br>
Not only the low bitrate of BCC coding, but also its backwards compatibility aspect is of interest.<br>
A single transmitted sum signal corresponds to a mono downmix of the original stereo or multi-channel<br>
signal. For receivers that do not support stereo or multi-channel sound reproduction, listening to the<br>
transmitted sum signal is a valid method of presenting the audio material on low-profile mono reproduction<br>
equipment. BCC coding can therefore also be used to enhance existing services involving the delivery of<br>
mono audio material towards multi-channel audio. For example, existing mono audio radio broadcasting<br>
systems can be enhanced for stereo or multi-channel playback if the BCC side information can be<br>
embedded into the existing transmission channel. Analogous capabilities exist when downmixing multi-<br>
channel audio to two sum signals that correspond to stereo audio.<br>
BCC processes audio signals with a certain time and frequency resolution. The frequency<br>
resolution used is largely motivated by the frequency resolution of the human auditory system.<br>
Psychoacoustics suggests that spatial perception is most likely based on a critical band representation of the<br>
acoustic input signal. This frequency resolution is considered by using an invertible filterbank (e.g., based<br>
on a fast Fourier transform (FFT) or a quadrature mirror filter (QMF)) with subbands with bandwidths<br>
equal or proportional to the critical bandwidth of the human auditory system.<br>
-7-<br><br>
Generic Downmixing<br>
In preferred implementations, the transmitted sum signal(s) contain all signal components of the<br>
input audio signal. The goal is that each signal component is fully maintained. Simply summation of the<br>
audio input channels often results in amplification or attenuation of signal components. In other words, the<br>
power of the signal components in a "simple" sum is often larger or smaller than the sum of the power of<br>
the corresponding signal component of each channel. A downmixing technique can be used that equalizes<br>
the sum signal such that the power of signal components in the sum signal is approximately the same as the<br>
corresponding power in all input channels.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a block diagram of a downmixer 300 that can be used for downmixer 206 of Fig. 2<br>
according to certain implementations of BCC system 200. Downmixer 300 has a filter bank (FB) 302 for<br>
each input channel x,(n), a downmixing block 304, an optional scaling/delay block 306, and an inverse FB<br>
(IFB) 308 for each encoded channel yi(n).<br>
Each filter bank 302 converts each frame (e.g., 20 msec) of a corresponding digital input channel<br>
Xi(n) in the time domain into a set of input coefficients x^k) in the frequency domain. Downmixing<br>
block 304 downmixes each sub-band of C corresponding input coefficients into a corresponding sub-band<br>
of £ downmixed frequency-domain coefficients. Equation (1) represents the downmixing of the kth sub-<br>
band of input coefficients (ic, (k), x2 (k), ...,xc(k)) to generate the kth sub-band of downmixed<br>
coefficients (yl(k),y2(k),...,yE(k)) as follows:<br><br>
■*(*)■		<br>
		x2(k)<br>
yE(k)		xc(k)<br><br>
(1)<br><br>
where DCE is a real-valued C-by-£ downmixing matrix.<br>
Optional scaling/delay block 306 comprises a set of multipliers 310, each of which multiplies a<br>
corresponding downmixed coefficient y, (k) by a scaling factor et(k) to generate a corresponding scaled<br>
coefficient &gt;&gt;,(&amp;). The motivation for the scaling operation is equivalent to equalization generalized for<br>
downmixing with arbitrary weighting factors for each channel. If the input channels are independent, then<br>
the power Pp.(k) of the downmixed signal in each sub-band is given by Equation (2) as follows:<br>
-8-<br><br>
		P«M<br>
PhW		Px2{k)<br>
		PicC)<br><br>
(2)<br><br>
where DCA. is derived by squaring each matrix element in the C-by-E downmixing matrix DCE and pi(k)<br>
is the power of sub-band k of input channel /.<br>
If the sub-bands are not independent, then the power values p9 (k) of the downmixed signal will be<br>
larger or smaller than that computed using Equation (2), due to signal amplifications or cancellations when<br>
signal components are in-phase or out-of-phase, respectively. To prevent this, the downmixing operation<br>
of Equation (1) is applied in sub-bands followed by the scaling operation of multipliers 310. The scaling<br>
factors e,(k) (\#i#E) can be derived using Equation (3) as follows:<br><br>
(3)<br>
where p.(k) is the sub-band power as computed by Equation (2), and p^k) is power of the corresponding<br>
downmixed sub-band signal y^k).<br>
In addition to or instead of providing optional scaling, scaling/delay block 306 may optionally<br>
apply delays to the signals.<br>
Each inverse filter bank 308 converts a set of corresponding scaled coefficients y,(k) in the<br>
frequency domain into a frame of a corresponding digital, transmitted channel yi(n).<br>
Although Fig. 3 shows all C of the input channels being converted into the frequency domain for<br>
subsequent downmixing, in alternative implementations, one or more (but less than C-l) of the C input<br>
channels might bypass some or all of the processing shown in Fig. 3 and be transmitted as an equivalent<br>
number of unmodified audio channels. Depending on the particular implementation, these unmodified<br>
audio channels might or might not be used by BCC estimator 208 of Fig. 2 in generating the transmitted<br>
BCC codes.<br>
In an implementation of downmixer 300 that generates a single sum signal y(ri), £=1 and the<br>
signals xc(k) of each subband of each input channel c are added and then multiplied with a factor e(k),<br>
according to Equation (4) as follows:<br><br>
K*) = «(*)£ *e(*).<br>
c=l<br>
the factor e(k) is given by Equation (5) as follows:<br><br>
(4)<br><br>
-9-<br><br>
EM*)<br>
e(k) = \^——,	(5)<br>
where p. (k) is a short-time estimate of the power of xc(k) at time index k, and ps(k) is a short-time<br>
estimate of the power of 2^c=] xc(k). The equalized subbands are transformed back to the time domain<br>
resulting in the sum signal y{ri) that is transmitted to the BCC decoder.<br>
Generic BCC Synthesis<br>
Fig. 4 shows a block diagram of a BCC synthesizer 400 that can be used for decoder 204 of Fig. 2<br>
according to certain implementations of BCC system 200. BCC synthesizer 400 has a filter bank 402 for<br>
each transmitted channel y&gt;j(n), an upmixing block 404, delays 406, multipliers 408, correlation block 410,<br>
and an inverse filter bank 412 for each playback channel x,(n).<br>
Each filter bank 402 converts each frame of a corresponding digital, transmitted channel yt(n) in<br>
the time domain into a set of input coefficients y,(k) in the frequency domain. Upmixing block 404<br>
upmixes each sub-band of £ corresponding transmitted-channel coefficients into a corresponding sub-band<br>
of C upmixed frequency-domain coefficients. Equation (4) represents the upmixing of the kth sub-band of<br>
transmitted-channel coefficients (y^k), y2(k),..., yE(k)) to generate the kth sub-band of upmixed<br>
coefficients (s,(k),s2(k),...,sc(k)) as follows:<br><br>
		M)<br>
s2(k)		Uk)<br>
sc(k)		Mk <br>
(6)<br><br>
where UEC is a real-valued £-by-C upmixing matrix. Performing upmixing in the frequency-domain<br>
enables upmixing to be applied individually in each different sub-band.<br>
Each delay 406 applies a delay value dt(k) based on a corresponding BCC code for ICTD data to<br>
ensure that the desired ICTD values appear between certain pairs of playback channels. Each multiplier<br>
408 applies a scaling factor at(k) based on a corresponding BCC code for ICLD data to ensure that the<br>
desired ICLD values appear between certain pairs of playback channels. Correlation block 410 performs a<br>
decorrelation operation A based on corresponding BCC codes for ICC data to ensure that the desired ICC<br>
values appear between certain pairs of playback channels. Further description of the operations of<br>
-10-<br><br>
correlation block 410 can be found in U.S. Patent Application No. 10/155,437, filed on 05/24/02 as<br>
Baumgarte 2-10.<br>
The synthesis of ICLD values may be less troublesome than the synthesis of ICTD and ICC values,<br>
since ICLD synthesis involves merely scaling of sub-band signals. Since ICLD cues are the most<br>
commonly used directional cues, it is usually more important that the ICLD values approximate those of<br>
the original audio signal. As such, ICLD data might be estimated between all channel pairs. The scaling<br>
factors cii(k) (1#/#Q for each sub-band are preferably chosen such that the sub-band power of each<br>
playback channel approximates the corresponding power of the original input audio channel.<br>
One goal may be to apply relatively few signal modifications for synthesizing ICTD and ICC<br>
values. As such, the BCC data might not include ICTD and ICC values for all channel pairs. In that case,<br>
BCC synthesizer 400 would synthesize ICTD and ICC values only between certain channel pairs.<br>
Each inverse filter bank 412 converts a set of corresponding synthesized coefficients xt(k) in the<br>
frequency domain into a frame of a corresponding digital, playback channel *,(«).<br>
Although Fig. 4 shows all E of the transmitted channels being converted into the frequency domain<br>
for subsequent upmixing and BCC processing, in alternative implementations, one or more (but not all) of<br>
the E transmitted channels might bypass some or all of the processing shown in Fig. 4. For example, one<br>
or more of the transmitted channels may be unmodified channels that are not subjected to any upmixing.<br>
In addition to being one or more of the C playback channels, these unmodified channels, in turn, might be,<br>
but do not have to be, used as reference channels to which BCC processing is applied to synthesize one or<br>
more of the other playback channels. In either case, such unmodified channels may be subjected to delays<br>
to compensate for the processing time involved in the upmixing and/or BCC processing used to generate<br>
the rest of the playback channels.<br>
Note that, although Fig. 4 shows C playback channels being synthesized from E transmitted<br>
channels, where C was also the number of original input channels, BCC synthesis is not limited to that<br>
number of playback channels. In general, the number of playback channels can be any number of<br>
channels, including numbers greater than or less than C and possibly even situations where the number of<br>
playback channels is equal to or less than the number of transmitted channels.<br>
"Perceptually relevant differences" between audio channels<br>
Assuming a single sum signal, BCC synthesizes a stereo or multi-channel audio signal such that<br>
ICTD, ICLD, and ICC approximate the corresponding cues of the original audio signal. In the following,<br>
the role of ICTD, ICLD, and ICC in relation to auditory spatial image attributes is discussed.<br>
-11-<br><br>
Knowledge about spatial hearing implies that for one auditory event, ICTD and ICLD are related<br>
to perceived direction. When considering binaural room impulse responses (BRIRs) of one source, there is<br>
a relationship between width of the auditory event and listener envelopment and ICC data estimated for the<br>
early and late parts of the BRIRs. However, the relationship between ICC and these properties for general<br>
signals (and not just the BRIRs) is not straightforward.<br>
Stereo and multi-channel audio signals usually contain a complex mix of concurrently active<br>
source signals superimposed by reflected signal components resulting from recording in enclosed spaces or<br>
added by the recording engineer for artificially creating a spatial impression. Different source signals and<br>
their reflections occupy different regions in the time-frequency plane. This is reflected by ICTD, ICLD,<br>
and ICC, which vary as a function of time and frequency. In this case, the relation between instantaneous<br>
ICTD, ICLD, and ICC and auditory event directions and spatial impression is not obvious. The strategy of<br>
certain embodiments of BCC is to blindly synthesize these cues such that they approximate the<br>
corresponding cues of the original audio signal.<br>
Filterbanks with subbands of bandwidths equal to two times the equivalent rectangular bandwidth<br>
(ERB) are used. Informal listening reveals that the audio quality of BCC does not notably improve when<br>
choosing higher frequency resolution. A lower frequency resolution may be desired, since it results in less<br>
ICTD, ICLD, and ICC values that need to be transmitted to the decoder and thus in a lower bitrate.<br>
Regarding time resolution, ICTD, ICLD, and ICC are typically considered at regular time intervals.<br>
High performance is obtained when ICTD, ICLD, and ICC are considered about every 4 to 16 ms. Note<br>
that, unless the cues are considered at very short time intervals, the precedence effect is not directly<br>
considered. Assuming a classical lead-lag pair of sound stimuli, if the lead and lag fall into a time interval<br>
where only one set of cues is synthesized, then localization dominance of the lead is not considered.<br>
Despite this, BCC achieves audio quality reflected in an average MUSHRA score of about 87 (i.e.,<br>
"excellent" audio quality) on average and up to nearly 100 for certain audio signals.<br>
The often-achieved perceptually small difference between reference signal and synthesized signal<br>
implies that cues related to a wide range of auditory spatial image attributes are implicitly considered by<br>
synthesizing ICTD, ICLD, and ICC at regular time intervals. In the following, some arguments are given<br>
on how ICTD, ICLD, and ICC may relate to a range of auditory spatial image attributes.<br>
Estimation of spatial cues<br>
In the following, it is described how ICTD, ICLD, and ICC are estimated. The bitrate for<br>
transmission of these (quantized and coded) spatial cues can be just a few kb/s and thus, with BCC, it is<br>
possible to transmit stereo and multi-channel audio signals at bitrates close to what is required for a single<br>
audio channel.<br>
-12-<br><br>
Fig. 5 shows a block diagram of BCC estimator 208 of Fig. 2, according to one embodiment of the<br>
present invention. BCC estimator 208 comprises filterbanks (FB) 502, which may be the same as<br>
filterbanks 302 of Fig. 3, and estimation block 504, which generates ICTD, ICLD, and ICC spatial cues for<br>
each different frequency subband generated by filterbanks 502.<br>
Estimation of ICTD. ICLD. and ICC for stereo signals<br>
The following measures are used for ICTD, ICLD, and ICC for corresponding subband signals<br>
x,(&amp;) and x2(k) of two (e.g., stereo) audio channels:<br>
o    ICTD [samples]:<br>
  (7)<br>
with a short-time estimate of the normalized cross-correlation function given by Equation (8) as follows:<br>
  (8)<br>
where<br>
  (9)<br>
and pii (d,k) is a short-time estimate of the mean of. <br>
o    ICLD [dB]:<br>
  (10)<br>
o    ICC:<br>
  (11)<br>
Note that the absolute value of the normalized cross-correlation is considered and cn(k) has a<br>
range of [0,1].<br>
Estimation of ICTD. ICLD. and ICC for multi-channel audio signals<br>
When there are more than two input channels, it is typically sufficient to define ICTD and ICLD<br>
between a reference channel (e.g., channel number 1) and the other channels, as illustrated in Fig. 6 for the<br>
case ofC=5 channels, where rlc(k) and AL,2(fc) denote the ICTD and ICLD, respectively, between the<br>
reference channel 1 and channel c.<br>
-13-<br><br>
As opposed to ICTD and ICLD, ICC typically has more degrees of freedom. The ICC as defined<br>
can have different values between all possible input channel pairs. For C channels, there are C(C-1 )/2<br>
possible channel pairs; e.g., for 5 channels there are 10 channel pairs as illustrated in Fig. 7(a). However,<br>
such a scheme requires that, for each subband at each time index, C(C-l)/2 ICC values are estimated and<br>
transmitted, resulting in high computational complexity and high bitrate.<br>
Alternatively, for each subband, ICTD and ICLD determine the direction at which the auditory<br>
event of the corresponding signal component in the subband is rendered. One single ICC parameter per<br>
subband may then be used to describe the overall coherence between all audio channels. Good results can<br>
be obtained by estimating and transmitting ICC cues only between the two channels with most energy in<br>
each subband at each time index. This is illustrated in Fig. 7(b), where for time instants k-\ and k the<br>
channel pairs (3, 4) and (1,2) are strongest, respectively. A heuristic rule may be used for determining<br>
ICC between the other channel pairs.<br>
Synthesis of spatial cues<br>
Fig. 8 shows a block diagram of an implementation of BCC synthesizer 400 of Fig. 4 that can be<br>
used in a BCC decoder to generate a stereo or multi-channel audio signal given a single transmitted sum<br>
signal s(n) plus the spatial cues. The sum signal s(n) is decomposed into subbands, where s(k) denotes<br>
one such subband. For generating the corresponding subbands of each of the output channels, delays dc,<br>
scale factors ac, and filters hc are applied to the corresponding subband of the sum signal. (For simplicity<br>
of notation, the time index k is ignored in the delays, scale factors, and filters.) ICTD are synthesized by<br>
imposing delays, ICLD by scaling, and ICC by applying de-correlation filters. The processing shown in<br>
Fig. 8 is applied independently to each subband.<br>
ICTD synthesis<br>
The delays dc are determined from the ICTDs Tlc(k), according to Equation (12) as follows:<br>
  (12)<br>
The delay for the reference channel, dt, is computed such that the maximum magnitude of the delays dc is<br>
minimized. The less the subband signals are modified, the less there is a danger for artifacts to occur. If<br>
the subband sampling rate does not provide high enough time-resolution for ICTD synthesis, delays can be<br>
imposed more precisely by using suitable all-pass filters.<br>
-14-<br><br>
1CLD synthesis<br>
In order that the output subband signals have desired ICLDs ALu(k) between channel c and the<br>
reference channel 1, the gain factors ac should satisfy Equation (13) as follows:<br>
AM*)<br>
^- = 10   20   .	(13)<br>
ax<br>
Additionally, the output subbands are preferably normalized such that the sum of the power of all output<br>
channels is equal to the power of the input sum signal. Since the total original signal power in each<br>
subband is preserved in the sum signal, this normalization results in the absolute subband power for each<br>
output channel approximating the corresponding power of the original encoder input audio signal. Given<br>
these constraints, the scale factors ac are given by Equation (14) as follows:<br><br><br>
otherwise.<br>
ICC synthesis<br>
In certain embodiments, the aim of ICC synthesis is to reduce correlation between the subbands<br>
after delays and scaling have been applied, without affecting ICTD and ICLD. This can be achieved<br>
by designing the filters hc in Fig. 8 such that ICTD and ICLD are effectively varied as a function of<br>
frequency such that the average variation is zero in each subband (auditory critical band).<br>
Fig. 9 illustrates how ICTD and ICLD are varied within a subband as a function of frequency. The<br>
amplitude of ICTD and ICLD variation determines the degree of de-correlation and is controlled as a<br>
function of ICC. Note that ICTD are varied smoothly (as in Fig. 9(a)), while ICLD are varied randomly (as<br>
in Fig. 9(b)). One could vary ICLD as smoothly as ICTD, but this would result in more coloration of the<br>
resulting audio signals.<br>
Another method for synthesizing ICC, particularly suitable for multi-channel ICC synthesis, is<br>
described in more detail in C. Faller, "Parametric multi-channel audio coding: Synthesis of coherence<br>
cues," IEEE Trans, on Speech and Audio Proc, 2003, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference. As a function of time and frequency, specific amounts of artificial late reverberation are added<br>
to each of the output channels for achieving a desired ICC. Additionally, spectral modification can be<br>
applied such that the spectral envelope of the resulting signal approaches the spectral envelope of the<br>
original audio signal.<br>
Other related and unrelated ICC synthesis techniques for stereo signals (or audio channel pairs)<br>
have been presented in E. Schuijers, W. Oomen, B. den Brinker, and J. Breebaart, "Advances in<br>
parametric coding for high-quality audio," in Preprint 114lh Conv. And. Eng. Soc, Mar. 2003, and J.<br>

C-to-E BCC<br>
As described previously, BCC can be implemented with more than one transmission channel. A<br>
variation of BCC has been described which represents C audio channels not as one single (transmitted)<br>
channel, but as E channels, denoted C-to-E BCC. There are (at least) two motivations for C-to-E BCC:<br>
o    BCC with one transmission channel provides a backwards compatible path for upgrading existing<br>
mono systems for stereo or multi-channel audio playback. The upgraded systems transmit the<br>
BCC downmixed sum signal through the existing mono infrastructure, while additionally<br>
transmitting the BCC side information. C-to-E BCC is applicable to E-channel backwards<br>
compatible coding of C-channel audio,<br>
o    C-to-E BCC introduces scalability in terms of different degrees of reduction of the number of<br>
transmitted channels. It is expected that the more audio channels that are transmitted, the better the<br>
audio quality will be.<br>
Signal processing details for C-to-E BCC, such as how to define the ICTD, ICLD, and ICC cues, are<br>
described in U.S. application serial number 10/762,100, filed on 01/20/04 (Faller 13-1).<br>
Diffuse Sound Shaping<br>
In certain implementations, BCC coding involves algorithms for ICTD, ICLD, and ICC synthesis.<br>
ICC cues can be synthesized by means of de-correlating the signal components in the corresponding<br>
subbands. This can be done by frequency-dependent variation of ICLD, frequency-dependent variation of<br>
ICTD and ICLD, all-pass filtering, or with ideas related to reverberation algorithms.<br>
When these techniques are applied to audio signals, the temporal envelope characteristics of the<br>
signals are not preserved. Specifically, when applied to transients, the instantaneous signal energy is likely<br>
to be spread over a certain period of time. This results in artifacts such as "pre-echoes" or "washed-out<br>
transients."<br>
A generic principle of certain embodiments of the present invention relates to the observation that<br>
the sound synthesized by a BCC decoder should not only have spectral characteristics that are similar to<br>
that of the original sound, but also resemble the temporal envelope of the original sound<br>
quite closely in order to have similar perceptual characteristics. Generally, this is achieved in BCC-like<br>
schemes by including a dynamic ICLD synthesis that applies a time-varying scaling operation to<br>
approximate each signal channel's temporal envelope. For the case of transient signals (attacks, percussive<br>
instruments, etc.), the temporal resolution of this process may, however, not be sufficient to produce<br>
-16-<br><br>
synthesized signals that approximate the original temporal envelope closely enough. This section describes<br>
a number of approaches to do this with a sufficiently fine time resolution.<br>
Furthermore, for BCC decoders that do not have access to the temporal envelope of the original<br>
signals, the idea is to take the temporal envelope of the transmitted "sum signal(s)" as an approximation<br>
instead. As such, there is no side information necessary to be transmitted from the BCC encoder to the<br>
BCC decoder in order to convey such envelope information. In summary, the invention relies on the<br>
following principle:<br>
o    The transmitted audio channels (i.e., "sum channel(s)") - or linear combinations of these channels<br>
which BCC synthesis may be based on - are analyzed by a temporal envelope extractor for their<br>
temporal envelope with a high time resolution (e.g., significantly finer than the BCC block size),<br>
o    The subsequent synthesized sound for each output channel is shaped such that - even after ICC<br>
synthesis - it matches the temporal envelope determined by the extractor as closely as possible.<br>
This ensures that, even in the case of transient signals, the synthesized output sound is not<br>
significantly degraded by the ICC synthesis / signal de-correlation process.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a block diagram representing at least a portion of a BCC decoder 1000, according to<br>
one embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 10, block 1002 represents BCC synthesis processing that<br>
includes, at least, ICC synthesis. BCC synthesis block 1002 receives base channels 1001 and generates<br>
synthesized channels 1003. In certain implementations, block 1002 represents the processing of blocks<br>
406, 408, and 410 of Fig. 4, where base channels 1001 are the signals generated by upmixing block 404<br>
and synthesized channels 1003 are the signals generated by correlation block 410. Fig. 10 represents the<br>
processing implemented for one base channel 1001' and its corresponding synthesized channel. Similar<br>
processing is also applied to each other base channel and its corresponding synthesized channel.<br>
Envelope extractor 1004 determines the fine temporal envelope a of base channel 1001', and<br>
envelope extractor 1006 determines the fine temporal envelope b of synthesized channel 1003'. Inverse<br>
envelope adjuster 1008 uses temporal envelope b from envelope extractor 1006 to normalize the envelope<br>
(i.e., "flatten" the temporal fine structure) of synthesized channel 1003' to produce a flattened signal 1005'<br>
having a flat (e.g., uniform) time envelope. Depending on the particular implementation, the flattening can<br>
be applied either before or after upmixing. Envelope adjuster 1010 uses temporal envelope a from<br>
envelope extractor 1004 to re-impose the original signal envelope on the flattened signal 1005' to generate<br>
output signal 1007' having a temporal envelope substantially equal to the temporal envelope of base<br>
channel 1001.<br>
Depending on the implementation, this temporal envelope processing (also referred to herein as<br>
"envelope shaping") may be applied to the entire synthesized channel (as shown) or only to the<br>
orthogonalized part (e.g., late-reverberation part, de-correlated part) of the synthesized channel (as<br>
-17-<br><br>
described subsequently). Moreover, depending on the implementation, envelope shaping may be applied<br>
either to time-domain signals or in a frequency-dependent fashion (e.g., where the temporal envelope is<br>
estimated and imposed individually at different frequencies).<br>
Inverse envelope adjuster 1008 and envelope adjuster 1010 may be implemented in different ways.<br>
In one type of implementation, a signal's envelope is manipulated by multiplication of the signal's time-<br>
domain samples (or spectral / subband samples) with a time-varying amplitude modification function (e.g.,<br>
Mb for inverse envelope adjuster 1008 and a for envelope adjuster 1010). Alternatively, a convolution /<br>
filtering of the signal's spectral representation over frequency can be used in a manner analogous to that<br>
used in the prior art for the purpose of shaping the quantization noise of a low bitrate audio coder.<br>
Similarly, the temporal envelope of signals may be extracted either directly by analysis the signal's time<br>
structure or by examining the autocorrelation of the signal spectrum over frequency.<br>
Fig. 11 illustrates an exemplary application of the envelope shaping scheme of Fig. 10 in the<br>
context of BCC synthesizer 400 of Fig. 4. In this embodiment, there is a single transmitted sum signal<br>
s{ri), the C base signals are generated by replicating that sum signal, and envelope shaping is individually<br>
applied to different subbands. In alternative embodiments, the order of delays, scaling, and other<br>
processing may be different. Moreover, in alternative embodiments, envelope shaping is not restricted to<br>
processing each subband independently. This is especially true for convolution/filtering-based<br>
implementations that exploit covariance over frequency bands to derive information on the signal's<br>
temporal fine structure.<br>
In Fig. 1 l(a), temporal process analyzer (TPA) 1104 is analogous to envelope extractor 1004 of<br>
Fig. 10, and each temporal processor (TP) 1106 is analogous to the combination of envelope extractor<br>
1006, inverse envelope adjuster 1008, and envelope adjuster 1010 of Fig. 10.<br>
Fig. 1 l(b) shows a block diagram of one possible time domain-based implementation of TPA 1104<br>
in which the base signal samples are squared (1110) and then low-pass filtered (1112) to characterize the<br>
temporal envelope a of the base signal.<br>
Fig. 1 l(c) shows a block diagram of one possible time domain-based implementation of TP 1106<br>
in which the synthesized signal samples are squared (1114) and then low-pass filtered (1116) to<br>
characterize the temporal envelope b of the synthesized signal. A scale factor (e.g., sqrt (alb)) is generated<br>
(1118) and then applied (1120) to the synthesized signal to generate an output signal having a temporal<br>
envelope substantially equal to that of the original base channel.<br>
In alternative implementations of TPA 1104 and TP 1106, the temporal envelopes are<br>
characterized using magnitude operations rather than by squaring the signal samples. In such<br>
implementations, the ratio alb may be used as the scale factor without having to apply the square root<br>
operation.<br>
-18-<br><br>
Although the scaling operation of Fig. 1 l(c) corresponds to a time domain-based implementation<br>
of TP processing, TP processing (as well as TPA and inverse TP (ITP) processing) can also be<br>
implemented using frequency-domain signals, as in the embodiment of Figs. 17-18 (described below). As<br>
such, for purposes of this specification, the term "scaling function" should be interpreted to cover either<br>
time-domain or frequency-domain operations, such as the filtering operations of Figs. 18(b) and (c).<br>
In general, TPA 1104 and TP 1106 are preferably designed such that they do not modify signal<br>
power (i.e., energy). Depending on the particular implementation, this signal power may be a short-time<br>
average signal power in each channel, e.g., based on the total signal power per channel in the time period<br>
defined by the synthesis window or some other suitable measure of power. As such, scaling for ICLD<br>
synthesis (e.g., using multipliers 408) can be applied before or after envelope shaping.<br>
Note that in Fig. 11 (a), for each channel, there are two outputs, where TP processing is applied to<br>
only one of them. This reflects an ICC synthesis scheme that mixes two signal components: unmodified<br>
and orthogonalized signals, where the ratio of unmodified and orthogonalized signal components<br>
determines the ICC. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 11 (a), TP is applied to only the orthogonalized<br>
signal component, where summation nodes 1108 recombine the unmodified signal components with the<br>
corresponding temporally shaped, orthogonalized signal components.<br>
Fig. 12 illustrates an alternative exemplary application of the envelope shaping scheme of Fig. 10<br>
in the context of BCC synthesizer 400 of Fig. 4, where envelope shaping is applied to in the time domain.<br>
Such an embodiment may be warranted when the time resolution of the spectral representation in which<br>
ICTD, ICLD, and ICC synthesis is carried out is not high enough for effectively preventing "pre-echoes"<br>
by imposing the desired temporal envelope. For example, this may be the case when BCC is implemented<br>
with a short-time Fourier transform (STFT).<br>
As shown in Fig. 12(a), TPA 1204 and each TP 1206 are implemented in the time domain, where<br>
the full-band signal is scaled such that it has the desired temporal envelope (e.g., the envelope as estimated<br>
from the transmitted sum signal). Figs. 12(b) and (c) shows possible implementations of TPA 1204 and<br>
TP 1206 that are analogous to those shown in Figs. 1 l(b) and (c).<br>
In this embodiment, TP processing is applied to the output signal, not only to the orthogonalized<br>
signal components. In alternative embodiments, time domain-based TP processing can be applied just to<br>
the orthogonalized signal components if so desired, in which case unmodified and orthogonalized<br>
subbands would be converted to the time domain with separate inverse filterbanks.<br>
Since full-band scaling of the BCC output signals may result in artifacts, envelope shaping might<br>
be applied only at specified frequencies, for example, frequencies larger than a certain cut-off frequency fi-p<br>
(e.g., 500 Hz). Note that the frequency range for analysis (TPA) may differ from the frequency range for<br>
synthesis (TP).<br>
-19-<br><br>
Figs. 13(a) and (b) show possible implementations of TPA 1204 and TP 1206 where envelope<br>
shaping is applied only at frequencies higher than the cut-off frequency/^. In particular, Fig. 13(a) shows<br>
the addition of high-pass filter 1302, which filters out frequencies lower than/^ prior to temporal envelope<br>
characterization. Fig. 13(b) shows the addition of two-band filterbank 1304 having with a cut-off<br>
frequency of/n&gt; between the two subbands, where only the high-frequency part is temporally shaped.<br>
Two-band inverse filterbank 1306 then recombines the low-frequency part with the temporally shaped,<br>
high-frequency part to generate the output signal.<br>

context of the late reverberation-based ICC synthesis scheme described in U.S. application serial number<br>
10/815,591, filed on 04/01/04 as attorney docket no. Baumgarte 7-12. In this embodiment, TPA 1404 and<br>
each TP 1406 are applied in the time domain, as in Fig. 12 or Fig. 13, but where each TP 1406 is applied<br>
to the output from a different late reverberation (LR) block 1402.<br>
Fig. 15 shows a block diagram representing at least a portion of a BCC decoder 1500, according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention that is an alternative to the scheme shown in Fig. 10. In Fig. 15,<br>
BCC synthesis block 1502, envelope extractor 1504, and envelope adjuster 1510 are analogous to BCC<br>
synthesis block 1002, envelope extractor 1004, and envelope adjuster 1010 of Fig. 10. In Fig. 15,<br>
however, inverse envelope adjuster 1508 is applied prior to BCC synthesis, rather than after BCC<br>
synthesis, as in Fig. 10. In this way, inverse envelope adjuster 1508 flattens the base channel before BCC<br>
synthesis is applied.<br>
Fig. 16 shows a block diagram representing at least a portion of a BCC decoder 1600, according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention that is an alternative to the schemes shown in Figs. 10 and 15. In<br>
Fig. 16, envelope extractor 1604 and envelope adjuster 1610 are analogous to envelope extractor 1504 and<br>
envelope adjuster 1510 of Fig. 15. In the embodiment of Fig. 15, however, synthesis block 1602<br>
represents late reverberation-based ICC synthesis similar to that shown in Fig. 16. In this case, envelope<br>
shaping is applied only to the uncorrelated late-reverberation signal, and summation node 1612 adds the<br>
temporally shaped, late-reverberation signal to the original base channel (which already has the desired<br>
temporal envelope). Note that, in this case, an inverse envelope adjuster does not need to be applied,<br>
because the late-reverberation signal has an approximately flat temporal envelope due to its generation<br>
process in block 1602.<br>
Fig. 17 illustrates an exemplary application of the envelope shaping scheme of Fig. 15 in the<br>
context of BCC synthesizer 400 of Fig. 4. In Fig. 17, TPA 1704, inverse TP (ITP) 1708, and TP 1710 are<br>
analogous to envelope extractor 1504, inverse envelope adjuster 1508, and envelope adjuster 1510 of Fig.<br>
15.<br>
-20-<br><br>
In this frequency-based embodiment, envelope shaping of diffuse sound is implemented by<br>
applying a convolution to the frequency bins of (e.g., STFT) filterbank 402 along the frequency axis.<br>
Reference is made to U.S. patent 5,781,888 (Herre) and U.S. patent 5,812,971 (Herre), the teachings of<br>
which are incorporated herein by reference, for subject matter related to this technique.<br>
Fig. 18(a) shows a block diagram of one possible implementation of TPA 1704 of Fig. 17. In this<br>
implementation, TPA 1704 is implemented as a linear predictive coding (LPC) analysis operation that<br>
determines the optimum prediction coefficients for the series of spectral coefficients over frequency. Such<br>
LPC analysis techniques are well-known e.g., from speech coding and many algorithms for efficient<br>
calculation of LPC coefficients are known, such as the autocorrelation method (involving the calculation of<br>
the signal's autocorrelation function and a subsequent Levinson-Durbin recursion). As a result of this<br>
computation, a set of LPC coefficients are available at the output that represent the signal's temporal<br>
envelope.<br>
Figs. 18(b) and (c) show block diagrams of possible implementations of ITP 1708 and TP 1710 of<br>
Fig. 17. In both implementations, the spectral coefficients of the signal to be processed are processed in<br>
order of (increasing or decreasing) frequency, which is symbolized here by rotating switch circuitry,<br>
converting these coefficients into a serial order for processing by a predictive filtering process (and back<br>
again after this processing). In the case of ITP 1708, the predictive filtering calculates the prediction<br>
residual and in this way "flattens" the temporal signal envelope. In the case of TP 1710, the inverse filter<br>
re-introduces the temporal envelope represented by the LPC coefficients from TPA 1704.<br>
For the calculation of the signal's temporal envelope by TPA 1704, it is important to eliminate the<br>
influence of the analysis window of filterbank 402, if such a window is used. This can be achieved by<br>
either normalizing the resulting envelope by the (known) analysis window shape or by using a separate<br>
analysis filterbank which does not employ an analysis window.<br>
The convolution/filtering-based technique of Fig. 17 can also be applied in the context of the<br>
envelope shaping scheme of Fig. 16, where envelope extractor 1604 and envelope adjuster 1610 are based<br>
on the TPA of Fig. 18(a) and the TP of Fig. 18(c), respectively.<br>
Further Alternative Embodiments<br>
BCC decoders can be designed to selectively enable/disable envelope shaping. For example, a<br>
BCC decoder could apply a conventional BCC synthesis scheme and enable the envelope shaping when<br>
the temporal envelope of the synthesized signal fluctuates sufficiently such that the benefits of envelope<br>
shaping dominate over any artifacts that envelope shaping may generate. This enabling/disabling control<br>
can be achieved by:<br>
-21-<br><br>
(1)	Transient detection: If a transient is detected, then TP processing is enabled. Transient detection<br>
can be implemented with in a look-ahead manner to effectively shape not only the transient but<br>
also the signal shortly before and after the transient. Possible ways of detecting transients include:<br>
o    Observing the temporal envelope of the transmitted BCC sum signal(s) to determine when<br>
there is a sudden increase in power indicating the occurrence of a transient; and<br>
o    Examining the gain of the predictive (LPC) filter. If the LPC prediction gain exceeds a<br>
specified threshold, it can be assumed that the signal is transient or highly fluctuating. The<br>
LPC analysis is computed on the spectrum's autocorrelation.<br>
(2)	Randomness detection: There are scenarios when the temporal envelope is fluctuating<br>
pseudo-randomly. In such a scenario, no transient might be detected but TP processing could still<br>
be applied (e.g., a dense applause signal corresponds to such a scenario).<br>
Additionally, in certain implementations, in order to prevent possible artifacts in tonal signals, TP<br>
processing is not applied when the tonality of the transmitted sum signal(s) is high.<br>
Furthermore, similar measures can be used in the BCC encoder to detect when TP processing<br>
should be active. Since the encoder has access to all original input signals, it may employ more<br>
sophisticated algorithms (e.g., a part of estimation block 208) to make a decision of when TP processing<br>
should be enabled. The result of this decision (a flag signaling when TP should be active) can be<br>
transmitted to the BCC decoder (e.g., as part of the side information of Fig. 2).<br>
Although the present invention has been described in the context of BCC coding schemes in which<br>
there is a single sum signal, the present invention can also be implemented in the context of BCC coding<br>
schemes having two or more sum signals. In this case, the temporal envelope for each different "base" sum<br>
signal can be estimated before applying BCC synthesis, and different BCC output channels may be<br>
generated based on different temporal envelopes, depending on which sum signals were used to synthesize<br>
the different output channels. An output channel that is synthesized from two or more different sum<br>
channels could be generated based on an effective temporal envelope that takes into account (e.g., via<br>
weighted averaging) the relative effects of the constituent sum channels.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in the context of BCC coding schemes<br>
involving ICTD, ICLD, and ICC codes, the present invention can also be implemented in the context of<br>
other BCC coding schemes involving only one or two of these three types of codes (e.g., ICLD and ICC,<br>
but not ICTD) and/or one or more additional types of codes. Moreover, the sequence of BCC synthesis<br>
processing and envelope shaping may vary in different implementations. For example, when envelope<br>
shaping is applied to frequency-domain signals, as in Figs. 14 and 16, envelope shaping could alternatively<br>
be implemented after ICTD synthesis (in those embodiments that employ ICTD synthesis), but prior to<br>
-22-<br><br>
ICLD synthesis. In other embodiments, envelope shaping could be applied to upmixed signals before any<br>
other BCC synthesis is applied.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in the context of BCC coding schemes, the<br>
present invention can also be implemented in the context of other audio processing systems in which audio<br>
signals are de-correlated or other audio processing that needs to de-correlate signals.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in the context of implementations in which the<br>
encoder receives input audio signal in the time domain and generates transmitted audio signals in the time<br>
domain and the decoder receives the transmitted audio signals in the time domain and generates playback<br>
audio signals in the time domain, the present invention is not so limited. For example, in other<br>
implementations, any one or more of the input, transmitted, and playback audio signals could be<br>
represented in a frequency domain.<br>
BCC encoders and/or decoders may be used in conjunction with or incorporated into a variety of<br>
different applications or systems, including systems for television or electronic music distribution, movie<br>
theaters, broadcasting, streaming, and/or reception. These include systems for encoding/decoding<br>
transmissions via, for example, terrestrial, satellite, cable, internet, intranets, or physical media (e.g.,<br>
compact discs, digital versatile discs, semiconductor chips, hard drives, memory cards, and the like). BCC<br>
encoders and/or decoders may also be employed in games and game systems, including, for example,<br>
interactive software products intended to interact with a user for entertainment (action, role play, strategy,<br>
adventure, simulations, racing, sports, arcade, card, and board games) and/or education that may be<br>
published for multiple machines, platforms, or media. Further, BCC encoders and/or decoders may be<br>
incorporated in audio recorders/players or CD-ROM/DVD systems. BCC encoders and/or decoders may<br>
also be incorporated into PC software applications that incorporate digital decoding (e.g., player, decoder)<br>
and software applications incorporating digital encoding capabilities (e.g., encoder, ripper, recoder, and<br>
jukebox).<br>
The present invention may be implemented as circuit-based processes, including possible<br>
implementation as a single integrated circuit (such as an ASIC or an FPGA), a multi-chip module, a single<br>
card, or a multi-card circuit pack. As would be apparent to one skilled in the art, various functions of<br>
circuit elements may also be implemented as processing steps in a software program. Such software may<br>
be employed in, for example, a digital signal processor, micro-controller, or general-purpose computer.<br>
The present invention can be embodied in the form of methods and apparatuses for practicing<br>
those methods. The present invention can also be embodied in the form of program code embodied in<br>
tangible media, such as floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs, hard drives, or any other machine-readable storage<br>
medium, wherein, when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine, such as a computer,<br>
the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention. The present invention can also be<br>
-23-<br><br>
embodied in the form of program code, for example, whether stored in a storage medium, loaded into<br>
and/or executed by a machine, or transmitted over some transmission medium or carrier, such as over<br>
electrical wiring or cabling, through fiber optics, or via electromagnetic radiation, wherein, when the<br>
program code is loaded into and executed by a machine, such as a computer, the machine becomes an<br>
apparatus for practicing the invention. When implemented on a general-purpose processor, the program<br>
code segments combine with the processor to provide a unique device that operates analogously to specific<br>
logic circuits.<br>
It will be further understood that various changes in the details, materials, and arrangements of the<br>
parts which have been described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of this invention may be<br>
made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention as expressed in the<br>
following claims.<br>
Although the steps in the following method claims, if any, are recited in a particular sequence with<br>
corresponding labeling, unless the claim recitations otherwise imply a particular sequence for<br>
implementing some or all of those steps, those steps are not necessarily intended to be limited to being<br>
