RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
The present invention claims the benefit of the filing dates of United States Provisional Patent Applications 60/445,218, filed February 5, 2003, and 60/465,905, filed April 28, 2003, the contents of which are incorporated herein.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to methods of making irbesartan and, especially, a precursor therefor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Irbesartan is a known angiotensin II receptor antagonist (blocker). Angiotensin is an important participant in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and has a strong influence on blood pressure. Irbesartan has the chemical name 2-butyl-3-[[2'-(lH-tetrazole-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl] methyl]-1,3-diazaspiro[4.4]non-1 -en-4-one. The structure of irbesartan is shown below (I).<br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
The synthesis of irbesartan is discussed, inter alia, in United States Patents 5,270,317 and 5,559,233; both of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference. In the synthesis therein disclosed, the prepenultimate reaction step (exclusive<br><br>
of work-up and purification) involves the reaction of a cyano group on the biphenyl ring<br>
with an azide, for example rributyltin azide. Reaction times as long as 210 hours can be<br>
required. See, e.g., '317 patent.<br>
United States Patent 5,629,331 also discloses a synthesis of irbesartan from a<br>
precursor 2-n-butyl-3-[(2'-cyanobiphenyl-4-yl)methyl]-l,3-diazaspiro[4.4]non-l-ene-4-<br>
one with sodium azide using a dipolar aprotic solvent. As acknowledged in the '331<br>
patent, there are safety risks involved in the use of azides (column 4, line 39). Also,<br>
dipolar aprotic solvents (e.g. methyl pyrrolidone) are relatively high boiling and can be<br>
difficult to remove.<br>
There is a need for an improved synthetic route to irbesartan, its derivatives and<br>
its precursors.<br>

combination to reflux for about 0.1 to about 1 hours; thereafter contacting the mixture<br>
with a base, especially an aqueous solution of anninorganic base whereby two phases are<br>
obtained; separating the phases obtained; and recovering the compound of structure n.<br>
The compound of structure II so obtained can be converted to irbesartan and irbesartan so<br>
made is still yet a further aspect of the present invention.<br>
In yet another aspect, the present invention relates to a method of making<br>
irbesartan including the step of converting, by removing the trityl group, 2-butyl-3-[[2'-<br>
(l-trityl-lH-tetrazol-5-yl)biphen-4-yl]methyl-l,3-diazaspiro[4.4]non-l-ene-4-oneto<br>
irbesartan.<br>
In still yet a further aspect, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical<br>
compositions containing kbesartan made via the novel methods of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a one-pot method of making 2-butyl-3-[2'-(l-trityl<br>
ljy-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-ylmethyl]-l,3-diazaspiro[4.4]non-l-ene-4-one (Structure n,<br>
IRB-03, trityl irbesartan) from 1-pentanoylaminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid amide (Npentanoyl-<br>
1-amino-l-carbamoylcyclopentane, RB-23) and 5-(4'-bromomethylbiphenyl<br>
2-yl)-l-trityl- 1H-tetrazole (IRB-02) in an at least initially multi-phase system in the<br>
presence of a phase transfer catalyst. The multi-phase system can be biphasic (solidliquid),<br>
or it can be triphasic (solid-liquid-liquid).<br>
In biphasic embodiments of the present invention, IRB-23 is in suspension with an<br>
alkali metal hydroxide and an alkali metal carbonate in a first solvent in the presence of<br>
phase transfer catalyst and the desired amount of IRB-02.<br>
The preferred alkali metal carbonate is K2CO3. About 1.5 and preferably about 2<br>
equivalents of alkali metal carbonate can be use for each equivalent of IRB-02. The<br>
preferred alkali metal hydroxide is NaOH. About 3 and preferably about 3.5 equivalents<br>
of alkali metyal hydroxide are used for each equivalent of IRB-02.<br>
First solvents are organic compounds, liquid at about 20° C, that dissolve IRB-02,<br>
but that are substantially insoluble in water. A liquid organic compound is substantially<br>
insoluble in water if it is soluble in water to less than about 5% such that, if equal initial<br>
volumes of substantially insoluble organic liquid and water are mixed, a two-phase<br>
(liquid-liquid) system results, the total volume of which is approximately equal to the<br>
initial volume of water plus the initial volume of the substantially insoluble organic<br>
liquid.<br>
First solvents useful in the practice of the present invention include linear and<br>
cyclic aliphatic ethers having up to 8 carbon atoms, for example methyl ^-butyl ether and<br>
tetrahydrofuran, and aromatic hydrocarbons, for example toluene. The amount of frist<br>
solvent is not critical as long as sufficient first solvent is used so that the IRB-02 is in<br>
solution. Preferably, between about 3 and about 4 liters of first solvent are used per<br>
combined moles of IRB-02 and IRB-23.<br>
Phase transfer catalysts are well known to one skilled in the art of organic<br>
synthesis. Phase transfer catalysts are of particular utility when at least first and second<br>
compounds to be reacted with each other have such different solubility characteristics that<br>
there is no practical common solvent for them and, accordingly, combining a solvent for<br>
one of them with a solvent for the other of them results in a two-phase system.<br>
Typically, when such compounds are to be reacted, the first reactant is dissolved<br>
in a first solvent and the second reactant is dissolved in a second solvent. Because the<br>
solvent for the first reactant is essentially insoluble in the solvent for the second reactant,<br>
a two-phase system is formed and reaction occurs at the interface between the two phases<br>
The rate of such an interfacial reaction can be greatly increased by use of a phase transfer<br>
catalyst (PTC).<br>
Several classes of compounds are known to be capable of acting as phase transfer<br>
catalysts, for example quaternary ammonium compounds and phosphonium compounds,<br>
to mention just two. Tetrabutylammonium hydrogensulfate is a preferred PTC for use in<br>
the practice of present invention. Approximately 0.1 equivalents of phase tyransfer<br>
catalyst per equivalent of IRB-23 to be reacted is usually sufficient, but more or less can<br>
be used.<br>
IRB-23 can be obtained by Schotten-Baumann reaction between 1-amino-lcarbamoylcyclopentane<br>
and valeroyl chloride in THF solvent using triethylamine as aciijl<br>
scavenger.<br>
In biphasic embodiments, IRB-02, IRB-23, alkali metal carbonate, alkali metal<br>
hydroxide, phase transfer catalyst, and first solvent are combined, in any order, and<br>
heated, preferably to a temperature between about 80°C and reflux, most preferably to a<br>
temperature of about 90°C. The reaction is allowed to proceed until substantially all of<br>
the IRB-02 has been consumed. The progress of the reaction can be monitored by, for<br>
example, thin layer chromatography (TLC) using hexane/ethyl acetate (1:1) eluent.<br>
When substantially all of the IRB-02 has been consumed, the reaction mixture is<br>
cooled and diluted with water (ca. one to two times the volume of the reaction mixture).<br>
The first-solvent phase (organic phase) is separated and, optionally, washed with brine.<br>
Preferably, the water content of the first-solvent phase is reduced by, for example,<br>
treating it with a solid drying agent.<br>
The desired product, IRB-03, can be isolated by concentrating the first-solvent<br>
phase to a residue and separating IRB-03 therefrom by column chromatography on a<br>
silica gel column using, for example, hexane/ethyl acetate (4:1 to 1:1) eluent The<br>
composition of chromatography fractions can be determined by, for example, nuclear<br>
magnetic resonance spectroscopy. IRB-03 can be isolated from IRB-03-containing<br>
fractions by separating the eluent by, for example, distillation.<br>
Triphasic embodiments of the present invention are analogous to the biphasic<br>
embodiments and include a second solvent that is essentially water, whereby at least a<br>
portion of the alkali metal carbonate, if an}', and the alkali metal hydroxide are in solutiojn<br>
in the second solvent. In these embodiments, the alkali metal carbonate is optional.<br>
Thus, in triphasic embodiments, IRB-03, IRB-23, alkali metal hydroxide,<br>
optionally alkali metal carbonate, phase transfer catalyst, and first solvent are combined<br>
with second solvent. The amounts of reactants used in triphasic embodiments are<br>
essentially the same as in biphasic embodiments, however an excess, up to about a 100%|<br>
excess, of ERB-23 is preferred. The volume of second solvent is about one-quarter to<br>
one-half of the volume of first solvent.<br>
Work-up of the reaction mixture is analogous to that in biphasic embodiments.<br>
The first-solvent phase is separated and combined with first-solvent phase obtained by<br>
optional extracting of the second-solvent phase with first solvent. The first-solvent<br>
phases can the be treated, and the 1RB-03 isolated, as in biphasic embodiments.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides a novel synthesis of<br>
irbesartan, analogues thereof, and, especially, precursors therefor (e.g. trityl irbesartan)<br>
including the step of reacting a reacting a valerimidate derivative with an amine to form<br>
an ester intermediate, and further reacting the ester intermediate with an amine to form 2-<br>
buryl-3-[[2I-(l-trityl-lH-tetrazole-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]methyl]-l,3-diazaspiro[4.4]non-len-<br>
4-one. The step is carried out in the presence of an acid. Preferably the step is carried<br>
out in the presence of one equivalent of acid per equivalent of valerimidate derivative.<br>
The valerimidate derivative can be any suitable derivative, including but not limited to<br>
ethers and esters. Preferred valerimidate derivatives include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl,<br>
benzyl, pentyl and aryl valerimidate esters (e.g. ester of valeroylimidic acid; R]-C(=NH)-<br>
O-R2; Ri = C/jHp) ), or, especially, salts thereof. A most preferred ester is the ethyl ester.<br>
The reaction is carried out in an organic solvent. Examples of preferred organic<br>
solvents include, but are not limited to, N,N dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl<br>
acetarnide (DMA), toluene, hexane, 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), diethoxymethane,<br>
tetrahydrofuran (THF), benzene, m-xylene, o-xylene, tetralins, formals, glymes and<br>
mixtures thereof. A most preferred organic solvent is dry toluene. Other hydrocarbons<br>
useful in the practice of the present invention will be apparent to the skilled artisan.<br>
The novel synthesis of irbesartan precursor, irbesartan itself, and analogues<br>
thereof, of the present invention includes the step of reacting a valerimidate derivative<br>
with an amine to form an N-substituted imido ester-like ester intermediate, and further<br>
reacting the ester intermediate with an amine to form 2-butyl-3-[[2'-(l-trityl-lH-tetrazole-<br>
5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl] methyl]-l,3-diazaspiro[4.4]non-l-en-4-one. Preferred amines include<br>
5'-(4'aniinomethylbiphenyl-2-yl)-l-trityl-lH-tetrazole(2-(l-trityl-lH-tetrazol-5-yl)-4'-<br>
aminomethylbiphenyl; Structure HI; IRB-09) and 1-aminocyclopentane carboxylic acid<br>
ethyl ester (KB-13).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
A preferred valerimidate derivative is ethyl valerimidate as its methanesulfonic<br>
acid salt. When the amine is IRB-09, the intermediate has structure IV (2-(l-trityl-lHtetrazol-<br>
5-yl)-4'-(l "-ethoxypentanaminyl)biphenyl). When the amine is ethyl 1-amino-<br>
1-cyclopentanecarboxyalte, the intermediate has structure V.<br>
The step is carried out in an organic solvent reaction system. To the organic<br>
solvent is added an amount of valerimidate derivative and an amount of an acidic<br>
material. The acidic material may be any suitable acid, including mineral acids, hydroge^i<br>
sulfate, trifluoroacetic acid, formic acid, hydrobromic acid, acetic acid and formic acid.<br>
A most preferred acid is hydrochloric acid. The ratio of valerimidate derivative to acidic<br>
material can be from about 5:1 to about 1:0.5, the most preferred ratio is about 1:1. The<br>
resulting mixture is agitated at room temperature for a period of from about 6 to about 24<br>
hours. Preferably the reaction mixture is agitated for a period of about 12 hours. The<br>
time of the reaction can be conveniently monitored using thin layer chromatography.<br>
Following completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is cooled and precipitated by/<br>
products removed. Preferably the reaction mixture is cooled to a temperature of from<br>
about -15°C to about 15°C. Most preferably the reaction mixture is cooled to a<br>
temperature of about 0°C. To the reaction mixture is added an amount of a suitable<br>
amine such as IRB-09 and IRB-13, and a catalytic amount of an acid material added.<br>
Preferred acid materials include mineral acids, hydrogen sulfate, trifluoroacetic acid,<br>
formic acid, hydrobromic acid, acetic acid and formic acid. A most preferred acid is<br>
acetic acid. The reaction mixture is heated under reflux for a period of from 2 hours to<br>
about 10 hours. Preferably the reaction mixture is agitated for a period of from about 3<br>
hours to about 5 hours. The time of the reaction can be conveniently monitored using<br>
thin layer chromatography. Following completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture i<br>
contacted with a base, preferably an inorganic base, more preferably a solution of an<br>
inorganic base in water, especially aqueous NaHCOa, whereby essentially all of the acid<br>
in the reaction mixture is preferably neutralized. When aqueous base is used a two-phas<br>
(liquid-liquid) system results. If solid base is used, a two-phase (solid-liquid) system<br>
result. In either instance, the resulting two-phase reaction system is separated. The<br>
organic phase is preferably washed and dried, and the reaction product, 2-butyl-3-[[2'-(ltrityl-<br>
lH-tetrazole-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]methyl]-l,3-diazaspiro[4.4]non-l-en-4-one, (IRB-<br>
03), separated out. The separation may be carried out by any known method, but is<br>
typically carried out by filtration and evaporation under reduced pressure.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the reaction proceeds<br>
via the production of imidate esters such as an N-valerirnidate 5'-<br>
(4'aminomethylbiphenyl-2-yl)-l-trityl-lH-tetrazole (IRB-20) in the reaction of 5'-<br>
(4'aminomethylbiphenyl-2-yl)-l-trityl-lH-tetrazole (IRB-09) and ethyl valerimidate<br>
methanesulfonic acid salt, or an N- valerimidate - 1-aminocyclopentane carboxylic acid<br>
ethyl ester (IRB-26) in the reaction of 1-aminocyclopentane carboxylic acid ethyl ester<br>
(IRB-09) and ethyl valerimidate methanesulfonic acid salt.<br>
In another aspect, the novel synthesis of irbesartan, and analogues thereof, of the<br>
present invention, includes the step of reacting an amide with a base scavenger,<br>
preferably 2,6-lutidine, and oxalyl chloride, followed by the addition of an amine to form<br>
2-butyl-3-[[2'-(l -trityl- lH-tetrazole-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl] methyl]-1,3-diazaspiro[4.4]nonl-<br>
en-4-one.<br>
The novel synthesis of irbesartan, and analogues thereof, of the present inventior<br>
includes the step of reacting a valerimidate derivative with 2,6-lutidine and oxalyl<br>
chloride to form a reaction mixture, and further adding an amine to form 2-butyl-3-[[2-<br>
(l-trityl-lH-tetrazole-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]methyl]-l,3-diazaspiro[4.4]non-l-en-4-one<br>
(IRB-03). Preferred valerimidate derivatives include cyclopentyl valeramide (IRBr23)<br>
and5-(4'methylvaleramide-biphenyW-yl)-l-trityl-lH-tetrazole(IRB-10). Preferred<br>
amines include 2'-(l-trityl-lH-terazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-ylmethylamine (IRB-09) and 1-<br>
amino cyclopentane carboxylic acid ethyl ester (IRB-13). The step is carried out in an<br>
organic solvent reaction system. To the organic solvent is added an amount of<br>
valeramide derivative and an amount of 2,6-lutidine. The reaction mixture is cooled to a<br>
temperature of from about -15°C to about 15°C, and oxalyl chloride added. Most<br>
preferably the reaction mixture is cooled to a temperature of about 0°C. The ratio of 2,6-<br>
lutidine to oxalyl chloride can be from about 10:1 to about 1:5, the most preferred ratio is<br>
about 2:1. The resulting mixture is agitated for a period of from about 0.25 to about 4<br>
hours. Preferably the reaction mixture is agitated for a period of about 1 hour. To the<br>
reaction mixture is added a solution of a suitable amine such as IRB-09 and IRB-13 in a<br>
suitable organic solvent, and the reaction mixture agitated for a period of about 0.1 to<br>
about 1 hour at about 0°C, then agitated for a period of about 0.1 to about 1 hour at aboui<br>
room temperature. The time of the reaction can be conveniently monitored using thin<br>
layer chromatography. Following completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is<br>
neutralized with a molar excess of base, preferably aqueous NaHCOa, and the resulting<br>
two-phase reaction system is separated. The organic phase is washed and dried, and the<br>
reaction product, 2-butyl-3-[[2'-(l-trityl-lH-tetrazole-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]methyl]-l,3-<br>
diazaspiro[4.4]non-l-en-4-one, (IRB-03), separated out. The separation may be carried<br>
out by any known method, but is typically carried out by filtration and evaporation under<br>
reduced pressure.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the reaction proceeds<br>
via the production of imidoyl chloride intermediates.<br>
To obtain irbesartan, the compound of structure II obtained by any embodiment of<br>
the present invention can be dissolved in a suitable solvent, for example acetone, and the<br>
solution combined with aqueous hydrochloric acid (2-4 equivalents wrt. trityl compound<br>
of structure II). The mixture so obtained is combined with a water solution of an<br>
inorganic base, for example KOH. Solvent is removed (e.g. evaporated) from the<br>
resulting mixture and the trityl alcohol that precipitates is filtered-off. The pH of the<br>
filtrate is adjusted to about 4, cooled, and the resulting precipitate of irbesartan collected.<br>
Of course, irbesartan can be obtained from the trityl compound of structure n by<br>
any other means known in the art.<br>
Irbesartan made in a process that includes the method of the present invention, iiji<br>
any of its embodiments, can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions that can b^<br>
in the form of a dosage form and prepared using diluents or excipients such as carriers,<br>
fillers, bulking agents, binders, wetting agents, disintegrating agents, surface active<br>
agents, lubricants, and the like. For the pharmaceutical compositions, various types of<br>
administration unit forms can be selected depending on the therapeutic purpose, for<br>
example tablets, pills, powders, liquids, suspensions, emulsions, granules, capsules,<br>
suppositories, injection preparations (solutions and suspensions), and the like. Any<br>
excipient commonly known and used widely in the art can be used in the pharmaceutical<br>
composition. Carriers include, but are not limited to, lactose, white sugar, sodium<br>
chloride, glucose, urea, starch, calcium carbonate, kaolin, crystalline cellulose, and silici<br>
acid. Binders include, but are not limited to, water, ethanol, propanol, simple syrup,<br>
glucose solutions, starch solutions, gelatin solutions, carboxymethyl cellulose, shelac,<br>
methyl cellulose, potassium phosphate, and polyvinylpyrrolidone. Disintegrating agents<br>
include, but are not limited to, dried starch, sodium alginate, agar powder, laminalia<br>
powder, sodium hydrogen carbonate, calcium carbonate, fatty acid esters of<br>
polyoxyethylene sorbitan, sodium laurylsulfate, monoglyceride of stearic acid, starch, an<br>
lactose. Disintegration inhibitors include, but are not limited to, white sugar, stearin,<br>
coconut butter, and hydrogenated oils. Absorption accelerators include, but are not<br>
limited to, quaternary ammonium base and sodium laurylsulfate. Wetting agents include<br>
but are not limited to, glycerin and starch. Adsorbing agents include, but are not limited<br>
to, starch, lactose, kaolin, bentonite, and colloidal silicic acid. Lubricants include, but are<br>
not limited to, purified talc, stearates, boric acid powder, and polyethylene glycol.<br>
Tablets can be further coated with commonly known coating materials such as sugar<br>
coated tablets, gelatin film coated tablets, tablets coated with enteric coatings, tablets<br>
coated with films, double layered tablets, and multi-layered tablets.<br>
When shaping the pharmaceutical composition into an oral solid dosage form, any<br>
commonly known excipient used in the art can be used. For example, carriers include,<br>
but are not limited to, lactose, starch, coconut butter, hardened vegetable oils, kaolin, and<br>
talc. Binders include, but are not limited to, gum arabic powder, tragacanth gum powder,<br>
gelatin, and ethanol. Disintegrating agents include, but are not limited to, agar, and<br>
laminalia.<br>
For the purpose of shaping the pharmaceutical composition in the form of<br>
suppositories, any commonly known excipient used in the art can be used. For example,<br>
excipients include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycols, coconut butter, higher<br>
alcohols, esters of higher alcohols, gelatin, and sernisynthesized glycerides.<br>
When preparing injectable (parenteral) pharmaceutical compositions, solutions<br>
and suspensions are sterilized and are preferably made isotonic to blood. Injection<br>
preparations may use carriers commonly known in the art. For example, carriers for<br>
injectable preparations include, but are not limited to, water, ethyl alcohol, propylene<br>
glycol, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohol, polyoxylated isostearyl alcohol, and fatty acid<br>
esters of polyoxyethylene sorbitan. One of ordinary skill in the art can easily determine<br>
with little or no experimentation the amount of sodium chloride, glucose, or glycerin<br>
necessary to make the injectable preparation isotonic. Additional ingredients, such as<br>
dissolving agents, buffer agents, and analgesic agents may be added. If necessary,<br>
coloring agents, preservatives, perfumes, seasoning agents, sweetening agents, and other<br>
medicines may also be added to the desired preparations.<br>
The amount of irbesartan contained in a pharmaceutical composition is not<br>
specifically restricted, however, the dose should be sufficient to treat, ameliorate, or<br>
reduce the symptoms associated with bone loss.<br>
Methods of administration of a pharmaceutical composition of the present<br>
invention are not specifically restricted, and can be administered in various preparations<br>
depending on the age, sex, and symptoms of the patient. For example, tablets, pills,<br>
solutions, suspensions, emulsions, granules and capsules may be orally administered.<br>
Injection preparations may be administered individually or mixed with injection<br>
transfusions such as glucose solutions and amino acid solutions intravenously. If<br>
necessary, the injection preparations are administered singly intramuscularly,<br>
intracutaneously, subcutaneously or intraperitoneally. Suppositories may be administered<br>
into the rectum.<br>
The dosage of a pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention<br>
will depend on the method of use, the age, sex, and condition of the patient.<br>

Na2SO4, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure to give 7.4 g of a semisolid<br>
residue (about 87 % purity by HPLC). A portion of the residue (3.7 g) was crystallized<br>
from IPA to give 3.0 g (86 % yield) of IRB-03 as a white powder (about 98 % purity by<br>
HPLC). Another portion (3.7 g) of the residue was dissolved in acetone (30 mL) and 7.5<br>
mL of aqueous 3N HC1 (about 3 eq.) was added. After completion of deprotection<br>
(removal of trityly group, monitored by TLC) a solution of KOH (1.3 g) in 10 mL of<br>
water was slowly added and acetone was evaporated under reduced pressure. The<br>
precipitate (trityl alcohol) was filtered and washed with water (2 x 10 mL); the combined<br>
aqueous filtrate washed with 15 mL of EtOAc and slowly acidified to pH 4 with 3N<br>
aqueous H.C1. The resulting suspension was cooled down to 0-4 °C, stirred for additional<br>
30 min and filtered. The filtercake was washed several times with water and dried under<br>
reduced pressure at 50-60 °C, affording 2.0 g (about 85 % yield from ERB-02) of ERB-00<br>
(96% purity by HPLC).<br>
