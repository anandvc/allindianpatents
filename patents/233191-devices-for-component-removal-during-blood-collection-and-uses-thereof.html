				<td>DEVICE FOR COLLECTING BLOOD, FOR COMPONENT REMOVAL DURING BLOOD COLLECTION<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Field of Invention<br>
[0001]  The present invention relates to devices for collecting blood, for component removal during blood collection, whereby certain target components are isolated or removed from the blood sample at the time of collecting the blood, as well as methods of using such devices.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] Today with the growth of proteomics, large-scale isolation and identification of proteins is becoming the focus of research, drug development and diagnostics. Protein separation methods are well-established in the molecular and biochemical arts; however, with the growth of proteomics, new technologies have arisen which require different, more stringent protein separation techniques. For example, exploring the plasma proteome requires the separation and identification of low abundance proteins and the determination of their characteristics using electrophoresis in a 2-dimensional (2D) gel system. However, plasma proteins or other components present in high concentrations, for example albumin, can hinder the separation and obscure the identification of these lower abundance proteins and, at times, make it difficult or impossible to determine their identity on 2D gels or by any other downstream testing of blood samples.<br>
[0003] Currently, many different methods exist to remove albumin and other high abundance components from blood samples; however, most of these clean-up methods are not specific enough and may actually remove many of the desirable proteins or components. Current albumin clean-up methods, for example, require transferring the sample into another container, thus requiring additional handling steps, and increasing the risk of processing errors, sample contamination, and extra risk of operator exposure to possibly infectious blood components. Furthermore, current methods do not use any kind of specifically directed affinity molecule targeting the target components in the clean-up process, and may thus remove components of interest. Accordingly, there is a need for blood sample collection<br><br>
devices, methods of using such devices, and processes that eliminate the risk of error and<br>
contamination, while also providing specific isolation of target components.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0021) 'Hie present invention relates to a device for collecting blood comprising a reservoir<br>
and a f f i n i ty molecules, wherein the affinity molecules are exposed to the blood during the<br>
nine of collecting the blood.<br>
[0022) The present invention also relates to a method of collecting blood comprising<br>
exposing the blood to affinity molecules during the time of said collection. The affinity<br>
molecules will bind target molecules present in the blood. As used herein, "target molecules"<br>
or "targets" is used to mean a component that may or may not be present in the actual sample<br>
of blood, but will bind to the affinity molecules if present.. The target may be "desired" in<br>
that Ihe moltcule targeted by the o Trinity molecule is of interest for further processing or<br>
assaying. Alternatively, the target may be "undesired" in that the target may be considered<br>
an impurity, or may be unnecessar' or unwanted in further processing or assaying steps.<br>
J0023| As used herein, "blood" is intended to mean whole blood, or the separate components<br>
of whole blood, from any animal. Separate components of blood include, but are not limited<br>
to, plasma and serum, the definitions of which are used herein as these terms are used in the<br>
art. For example, plasma is the component of whole blood that is substantially free of cells,<br>
including plaielels. Serum is plasma in which fibrinogen and other clotting factors have been<br>
removed. Thus, "blood," as used herein, can include whole blood, plasma, serum, the<br>
cellular portion of blood and even the protein portion of whole blood. Furthermore, for the<br>
purposes of this invention, components of blood can be isolated, such as the isolation of<br>
protein or other molecules from blood such as an isolate of fibrinogen, or can be a mixture of<br>
molecules, such as plasma or serum. For example, as used in the current context, albumin is<br>
considered a component of blood. As used herein, "component" does not include the cellular<br>
portion of blood, whereas, "cellular component" includes cellular portions. Cellular<br>
components may or may not include, and are not limited to, hematopoetic cells, myeioid stem<br>
cells, erythrocytes, neutrophils, basophils. eosinophils, megakaryocytes, platelets, monocytcs,<br>
mast ceils, lymphoid cells, including all T-cells and B-cells, normal or diseased cells from<br>
any body tissue.<br>
[0024| Furthermore, "collecting" is used to mean extraction of the blood from its normal<br>
environment, whether or not the blood is returned to the individual from which it was<br>
extracted, or placed into a different individual, such as during a transfusion. As used herein,<br>
the terms "individual," "subject" and "patient" are used interchangeably and are used to mean<br>
any animal, preferably a mammal, more preferably a human or non-human primate.<br>
[0025] The device of the present invention comprises a reservoir. The reservoir can be any<br>
device, open ur closed to the environment, that can hold any amount of blood, at least<br>
temporarily. Of c<mrsc a reservoir can also hold any amount ofblood indefinitely. the></mrsc>
reservoir can also be capable of being punctured and resealed. Examples of reservoirs of the<br>
current invention include, but are not limited to, evacuated tubes, non-evacuated tubes, petri<br>
dishes, microtiter plates, syringe barrels, needles, machines that can process or analyze blood,<br>
blood collect ion systems such as blood collection bags, such as the type used when donating<br>
blood, iiiid even plastic tubing.<br>
[0026] The blood need not be stationary inside the reservoir, but can be sedentary, or moving<br>
or flowing, la one embodiment, the reservoir comprises a density gradient barrier wherein<br>
the sample collected within the reservoir is separated into higher and lower densities during<br>
centrifugation. Any type ofblood collection device or system may be used as a reservoir.<br>
Suitable devices and systems that can act as reservoirs include, but are not limited to, blood<br>
tubes manufactured by, for example, Becton Dickinson and Company (BD) including, but not<br>
limited to, Serum Clot Activator Tubes, Serum Gel Clot Activator Tubes, Lithium Heparin<br>
Tubes, Sodium Fluoride Tubes, Sodium Citrate Tubes, ESR Citrate Tubes and Trace Mettal<br>
Tubes. Additionally, capillary blood collection systems produced by any manufacturer<br>
including, but not limited to, Microvette™ systems can act as reservoirs. Examples of some<br>
types of reservoirs contemplated for use in the present invention are contained in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,479,298, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0027] In one embodiment, the reservoir further comprises an insert. As used herein, the<br>
term "insert" means a material that is completely encapsulated by the reservoir, such as a<br>
solid dipstick, mechanical density partition element, or a paddle within an evacuated tube.<br>
The term "insert" can also refer to material that is only partially within the reservoir. The<br>
inserts can be a solid object, such as a paddle, or the inserts can be a liquid, a gel or a gas.<br>
Other examples ot inserts include, but are not limited to, beads, particles and microparticlcs.<br>
Examples of beads include, but are not limited to, paramagnetic beads that can be<br>
manipulated by a magnetic field. The inserts can be any shape, provided that at least a portion<br>
of the insert is located within the reservoir. Examples of the shapes of inserts include, but are<br>
not limited to, rectangular, circular, oval, straight rod and helical-shaped rod.<br>
10028] In another embodiment, the interior walls of the reservoir can be smooth or ridged.<br>
Providing a reservoir with ridges serves to increase the interior surface area of the reservoir.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the inserts are also ridged to increase their respective surface<br>
areas. In still another embodiment, both the insert and the interior walls of the reservoir arc<br>
ridged to provide even more surface area. The purpose of increasing the surface area in any<br>
of the embodiments of the present invention is to increase the amount of surface-immobilized<br>
affinity molecules that can come into contact with the blood at the time of its collection.<br>
[0029] In addition to the reservoir, the device of the present invention also comprises one or<br>
more affinity molecules. As used herein, "affinity molecules" can be any type of molecule<br>
that, possesses an affinity towards single or multiple components of the blood. The affinity<br>
can be a specific affinity in that the affinity molecule has an affinity for a focused subset of<br>
components, such as an antibody specific for fibrinogen. The affinity of the affinity<br>
molecules can also be less specific in nature, such as a protein that binds the general class<br>
immunoglobulins, for example, protein A. Even further, the affinity molecules as<br>
contemplated by the present invention can exhibit an even broader affinity such that the<br>
affinity molecules can possess an affinity for a mixture of different classes of proteins.<br>
[0030] Examples of affinity molecules include, but are not limited to, antibodies, antibody<br>
fragments, enzymes, fragments of enzymes, enzyme substrates, fragments of enzyme<br>
substrates, nucleotides, oligonucleotides, polynucleotides, receptors, fragments of receptors,<br>
ligands. fragments of enzymes, other proteins, amino acids, peptides, polypeptides,<br>
oligopeptides, saccharides, disaccharides, polysaccharides, glycoproteins, proteoglycans,<br>
natural and synthetic polymers, aptamers, and nanobodics. [n one embodiment, the affinity<br>
molecules arc antibodies, or fragments of antibodies, such as, but not limited to, Fab<br>
fragments, FiulV'b fragments, and scFv fragments. The antibodies may be polyclonal,<br>
monoclonal, chimeric, synthetic or naturally occurring.<br>
[0031] In another embodiment, the affinity molecules of the present invention bind a<br>
component within the blood. Preferably, the affinity molecules bind a blood protein.<br>
Examples of proteins that the affinity molecules will bind include, but are not limited to,<br>
fibrinogen, albumin, immunoglobulins including, but not limited to, alpha-, beta- and<br>
gamma-globulins, proteases such as chymotrypsin and thrombin, and protease inhibitors such<br>
as antichymotrypsin, untithrombin, macroglobulins, intcr-alpha-trypsin inhibitor, Cl<br>
i n h i b i t o r , plusmin inhibitor, hcparin cofactor II, apoprotein A and fibronectin.<br>
[0032) In OIK: embodiment, the affinity molecule or set of affinity molecules can bind to<br>
more tlv.in one nudes i red component at the same lime, resulting in more than one undcsired<br>
component ixmg removed from the sample. In another embodiment, the affinity molecule or<br>
set ol .'affinity molecules can bind lo more than one desired component at the same time,<br>
resulting in more than one desired component being isolated. In another embodiment, more<br>
than one affinity molecule or set of affinity molecules can be employed, with each affinity<br>
molecule or set of molecules binding different undesired components, resulting in more than<br>
one uiHiesiruJ component being removed from the lampk. Of course, the invention<br>
encompasses ut.iliv.ing one affinity molecule or set of affinity molecules that can bind only<br>
one undcsired component. Optionally, the invention encompasses utilizing one affinity<br>
molecule or a set of affinity molecules that can enrich the sample by removing all but a few<br>
desired components from the original specimen. As used herein, the phrase "a set of affinity<br>
molecules" is used to mean a plurality of affinity molecules that possess the identical type of<br>
affinity, in both specificity and strength. As used herein, "affinity molecules" is used to mean<br>
one or more affinity molecules and one or more sets of affinity molecules. In one<br>
embodiment, the invention encompasses a reservoir and a single device, comprising an<br>
affinity molecule or a set of affinity molecules. In another embodiment, the invention also<br>
encompasses a single device, comprising a mixture of more than one distinct affinity<br>
molecules or sets of molecules. In yet another example, the invention also comprises<br>
multiple devices, with each device comprising a distinct affinity molecule or set of affinity<br>
molecules directed towards, for example, itnmunoglobulins and clotting cactors. In still<br>
another embodiment, the invention also comprises multiple devices, witu each device<br>
comprising a mixture of more than one distinct affinity molecules or sets of affinity<br>
molecules. In still another embodiment, the invention also comprises a kit of multiple<br>
devices, with each device comprising a mixture oi more than one distinct affinity molecules<br>
or sets of affinity molecules.<br>
[0033] The affinity molecules of the present invention can be present in soluble or<br>
immobilized rbrm. If. for example, the affinity molecules arc in soluble form, they may be<br>
present in the reservoir in liquid or lyophilized form. The blood would then be added to the<br>
solubili/.ed ailinitv molecules, which could then be pulled oat of the sample or fractionated<br>
from the sample depending on the specific user needs for the final sample. For example, the<br>
aifinity molecules can be bound or attached to inert substances such as, for example, glass,<br>
polypropylene, nylon, nitrocellulose, polymcthacrylate, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride,<br>
styrenebutadiene copolymer, styrene-acrylatc copolymer, latex, chemically modified plastic,<br>
rubber, red blood cells, -_i polymeric material or biological cells. According to the present<br>
invention, examples of the surfaces on which the inert substances can be found include, but<br>
are not limited to, any portion of the reservoir, the sides and/or bottoms of tubes, the sides<br>
and/or bottom of culture dishes, aay type of insert such as a paddle, dipstick, gel, beads,<br>
particles, microparticles, and the I ning of tubing. The affinity molecules can be attached to<br>
the surfaces by any known method including, but not limited to. covalent and non-covalenl<br>
oTtachnitiit or coupling, such as at! iching the affinity molecules directly to the inert surfaces<br>
or attaching the affinity molecules o derivatized and/or coated surfaces.<br>
|0034| In one embodiment, microp irticles such as beads are used in the present invention,<br>
with the beads comprising scpharo.ie or polystyrene. In another embodiment, the beads may<br>
comprise magnetic particles, such as magnetic, paramagnetic, and superparamagnetic beads<br>
produced by Dynal AS (Oslo, Norway) and sold as DYNABEADS™. If magnetic beads are<br>
used, regard le &gt;s o! the manufacturer, a magnet could be used to manipulate the movement of<br>
the proteins bound to the beads. The magnet can further be used to collect or separate the<br>
beads from the rest of the blood sample.<br>
[0035] In another embodiment of the present of the invention, a density separator gradient<br>
may be introduced to further separate density phases of a collected sample. Such density<br>
gradients may be chosen from the group consisting of a thixotropic gel and a mechanical<br>
separator. Additionally, beads or microparticles may be chosen such that their density is<br>
greater than the density separator. For instance, if the density of the separator is about 1.02 to<br>
about 1.08 g/cin', the density of the beads may be chosen such that all or a portion of the<br>
beads have a density greater than about 1.08 g/cnr\ The higher density beads should come to<br>
rest at the bottom of the container during ccntrifugation, thus moving a portion of the bound<br>
targets below the density separator. When the targeted molecules are highly abundant,<br>
removal of the beads or microparticles will thus enrich the sample remaining in the reservoir.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, beads may be chosen such that their density<br>
is smaller than the density of a density separator. For instance, if the density of the separator<br>
is about i .02 to about 1.08 g/cnr , the density of the beads may be chosen such that all or a<br>
portion ot the beads have a density lower than about 1.02 g/cm3. The lower density beads<br>
should iloat to the top of the sample, thus moving a portion of the bound targeted proteins<br>
above the separator. When the targeted molecules are highly abundant, removal of the beads<br>
or microparticles will thus enrich the sample remaining in the reservoir.<br>
[0036] The ih.ixotropic gel separator may be applied to the inner surface the reservoir.<br>
Altermnely, ;i mechanical separator may be inserted within the tube to separate fluids. Once<br>
the blood collection tube is subjected to centrifugal force, the separator will then move up or<br>
down the tube as it comes into a density equilibrium with the blood sample, thus acting to set<br>
up a density gradient for the blood. In conjunction with the separator, the beads, if used in<br>
Hie present invention, can also act within and help establish a density gradient to allow ease<br>
uf separation of tht- various components of the blood.<br>
[0037] The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms and is not limited to<br>
any specific embodiments described in detail, which are merely exemplary. Various other<br>
modifications will be apparent to and readily made by those skilled in the art without<br>
departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. The scope of the invention will be<br>
measured by the appended claims and their equivalents.<br>
[0038] One embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in FIGS. 1-6, wherein<br>
assembly 120 comprises a reservoir 130 (here, depicted as a tube), a closure 150 and a<br>
separator 170.<br>
[0039] Reservoir 130 has an open end 132 that includes a top edge (not shown), a closed end<br>
134 and a sidevvall 136 extending between the open end and the closed end. Sidewall 136 has<br>
an outer surface 138 and an inner surface 140. Reservoir 130 defines a receptacle with a<br>
central axis "A". Assembly 120 includes affinity molecules 131 located on inner surface 140<br>
of sidewall 136.<br>
|0040| Closure 150 is disposed to fit over open end 132 of reservoir 130. Closure 150<br>
comprises an annular upper portion 152, which extends over the top edge of sidewall 136,<br>
and a lower annular portion or skirt 154 of lesser diameter than the annular upper portion<br>
152, which extends into and forms an interference fit with inner surface 140 of sidewall 136<br>
for maintaining closure 150 in place in open end 132.<br>
[0041] Annular upper portion 152 includes a top surface area 156, sidewall 158 that<br>
converges from surface area 156 towards upper well area 160. Lower annular skirt portion<br>
154 defines a lower well 162, an inner wall surface 164, an outer wall surface 166 and a<br>
bottom surface 168, Well area 160 and lower well area 162 define a thin diaphragm or selfsealing<br>
septum through which a needle may be inserted. The self-sealing septum material<br>
allows penetration by a piercing element such as a needle and then rcseals when the piercing<br>
element is withdrawn.<br>
[0042] An annular ledge or abutment 157 separates annular upper portion 152 and lower<br>
annular portion 154,<br>
[0043] Preferably, closure 150 is made of natural rubber elastomer, synthetic thermoplastic<br>
and ihermoset elastomeric materials. Preferably, the closure is made of a resilient elastomeric<br>
material whereby the septum is self-sealing.<br>
[0044] As shown in FIG. 3, a liquid sample A is delivered to the tube by a needle that<br>
penetrates closure 150 in upper well area 160. For purposes of illustration only, the liquid<br>
sample is blood. The liquid sample is delivered into the passageway of separator 170 so that<br>
the liquid sample is introduced between closed end 134 of reservoir 130 and separator 170,<br>
whereby the outer surface of all components of separator 170 are substantially free of any<br>
contact with the fluid sample.<br>
[0045] As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, when assembly 120 is subjected to centriftigation or axial<br>
centrifugation force, seal body 191 of separator 170 deflects, thereby reducing its diameter<br>
and eliminating its interference lit with the inner wall of the reservoir. Separator 170 releases<br>
from the inner wail of the reservoir such that separator 170 descends towards closed end 134<br>
of reservoir 1 30. This also opens up a path 300 between the reservoir and the separator,<br>
permitting the tlow of the low-density component B of the fluid upwardly past the separator<br>
as the separator migrates down the reservoir. The low-density component inside the<br>
passageway i 99 of the separator will migrate downwardly and upwardly past the separator.<br>
Thus, separator 170 is permitted to sink into the fluid sample.<br>
(0040] As shown in FIG. 6, after ccntrifugation is terminated, the absence of the centrifugal<br>
load will cause seal body 191 to resiliency return toward an underformed condition and<br>
lightly seal with the inner wall of the tube. Thus, separator 170 serves as a divider between<br>
lower specific gravity portion B and higher specific gravity portion C of the liquid sample.<br>
|0047| FIGS. 7-12 represent an alternative embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
embodiment of FIGS. 7-12 operates in the same manner as the embodiment of FIGS. 1-6, but<br>
contains beads 135' w i th a f f i n i ty molecules 131' thereon, as well as affinity molecules 131'<br>
1'ieutxd on inner surface 140' of sidcwall 136'. Elements common lo the embodiment of<br>
I ' I G S . l-o and FIGS. 7-12 are numbered identically, with those of the latter embodiment<br>
denoted as "prime': (').<br>
[0048] FIG. 13 shows the interaction of the device of FIGS. 1-6 with a holder 42. Holder 42<br>
has a cannula 44 with a venous entry end 48 and a non-patient end 46 such that when<br>
:i&gt;sembly 120 i? inserted into holder 42, the self-scaling septum on closure 150 is pierced by<br>
non-puii'_ nt tud 4o, thereby starting the process of collecting blood into reservoir 130.<br>
10049] In one embodiment, the reservoir is compatible with the numerous additives used in<br>
the art such us citrates, silicone. silicates, ethylenediaminctetraacctic acid (EDTA) and the<br>
like. The additives are used, for example, to condition the sample either to facilitate or retard<br>
clotting or to preserve the sample for a particular analysis. It is within the purview of the<br>
present invention that one or more additives may be used.<br>
[0050] The affinity molecules themselves may or may not be modified to allow ease of<br>
separation. For example, the affinity molecules may be biotinylated, and streptavidin could<br>
be used to remove the biotinylated affinity molecules after having bound the target<br>
component. Thus, a component can be removed from a sample first by exposing the affinity<br>
molecules to the sample at the time of collection and subsequently using biotinylated<br>
anti-affinity molecule antibodies. The biotinylated antibodies would then be captured using,<br>
for example, avidin, streptavidin, or Neutravidin™, resulting in a sampL substantially<br>
depleted of the targeted component.<br>
[0051] In one embodiment, the affinity molecules are found within the reservoir. For<br>
example, the affinity molecules may be bound to beads, which are found within the reservoir.<br>
Thus, tlic invention can comprise an evacuated blood collection device with, for example,<br>
antibody-coated beads added to the tube. The tube containing the beads would be used, for<br>
example, during venipuncture blood collection procedures in human.s and/or animals. In a<br>
similar embodiment, the invention could also be, tor example, non-evacuated microcollection<br>
containers containing antibody-coated beads. The foregoing embodiment can be<br>
modified, for example, by substituting the beads for any inert substance or surface, whether<br>
or not the inert substance or surface is listed herein.<br>
[0052] In another embodiment, the affinity molecules may be external to the reservoir. For<br>
example, the affinity molecules may be bound to beads that are external to the reservoir and<br>
m;i'-' comprise, for example, an affinity column packed with affinity beads. Thus, the<br>
invention can also comprise a reservoir for collecting the blood and one or more affinity<br>
columns linked, in sequence, before or after and optionally integrated to the reservoir. The<br>
foregoing embodiment can be modified, lor example, by substituting the beads for any<br>
portion of the reservoir, the sides tnd/or bottoms of tubes, particles, microparticles, the sides<br>
and/or bottom of culture dishes and the lining of tubing.<br>
[0053] Indeed, lilt, loregoing embo liments can be modified, for example, by substituting the<br>
beads for any men substance or sur ace, whether or not the inert substance or surface is listed<br>
herein. Further, all of the cmbodim ;nts described herein can also be modified by substituting<br>
antibodies, for example, with any t} pe of affinity molecule such as antibody fragments,<br>
enzymes, fragments of enzymes, crzyme substrates, fragments of enzyme substrates,<br>
nucleotides, oligonucleotides, polynucleotides, receptors, fragments of receptors, ligands,<br>
fragments of enzymes, other proteins, amino acids, pcptides, polypeptides, oligopeptides,<br>
saccharides, di.saccharides, polysaccharides, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and natural and<br>
synthetic polymer*-.. Further, all of the embodiments described herein can be modified by<br>
substituting protein for any undesirable component of blood.<br>
[0054] The present invention provides distinct advantages over current methods, these<br>
advantages being achieved by exposing the affinity molecules to the blood during and/or<br>
immediately alter the blood collection process. As used herein, "during the time of<br>
collection" is used to mean that the affinity molecules are exposed to the blood during the<br>
blood collection process, The exposure of the blood to the affinity molecules need not be<br>
briefer instantaneous in time, so long as the exposure of the biood to the affinity molecules<br>
occurs prior to any subsequent processing or analysis of the blood sample. Thus, the affinity<br>
molecules must be .situated in such a manner as to come into contact with the blood during<br>
the time of collection. As such, the affinity molecules may be situated to where they come<br>
into contact with the blood cither before or after the blood collects in the reservoir, so long as<br>
the affinity molecules contact the blood during the time of collection. The purpose of<br>
contacting the affinity molecules with the blood during the time of collection is to reduce the<br>
number of handling ana processing steps.<br>
[0055] Therefore, present invenlion provides a means of separating abundant proteins or<br>
other components from blood by adding, for example, polystyrene microparticles coated with<br>
antibodies spi.cifk to blood proteins or other components. I'he microparticles, for example,<br>
can be readily purchased from the manufacturer of microspheres and are designed for<br>
immunological applications. Such microspheres are sold with antibodies, without antibodies,<br>
or arc derivative-ready for antibody conjugation.<br>
[0056] The methods of the present invention can serve as an integrated and self-contained<br>
une-sicp ckyn-up tool or, alternatively, an integrated and self-contained one-step enrichment<br>
tool, for downstream testing during the blood collection process. Accordingly, the collection<br>
and removal of at least one undesircd component from the blood sample can be performed<br>
during the same procedure. After clot formation in serum (or no clot formation in plasma),<br>
the sample can optionally be subjected to a short waiting period for the binding reaction to<br>
take place to the coated polystyrene beads, for example. The time required for the reaction<br>
will depend on the kinetics associated with the binding for the intended targets and may be<br>
affected by other factors such as, but not limited to, diffusion or mixing.<br>
[0057] After exposure of the blood to the affinity molecules, the sample can then be<br>
ccntrifuged, for example, according to the manufacturer's recommendations, allowing the<br>
particles with the bound undesired component to settle out at the same rate or faster than the<br>
clot or other cellular portion of the blood. The affinity molecule-coated particles, for<br>
example, should be of similar density as the clot or the cells so that all of the bound<br>
components will settle out of the serum or the plasma. Alternatively, the density and size can<br>
be chosen so that the bound components will float. Particles coated with affinity molecules<br>
can be chosen based on specific sizes and densities. Accordingly, the methods of the present<br>
invention can remove most or all of the targeted components of the blood, based on the time<br>
of incubation, before centrifugation. The removal need not be complete such that 100% of<br>
the undesired component is removed from the blood. Rather, all that is required is that the<br>
removal of at least one component of the blood be to such a degree that will allow more<br>
accurate analysis and/or efficient processing of the blood, compared to blood where the<br>
undesired component has not been removed. The resulting plasma or serum, for example,<br>
should be sufficiently free of undesired components, and most other components should not<br>
be affected because of the speciiicity of the affinity molecules toward the specific<br>
components.<br>
[0058] In another embodiment, for example, tube walls can be coated with affinity<br>
molecules. In this case, the tube walls would function as a solid support, and the affinity<br>
molecules would be conjugated, covalently or non-covalently, to the polymers or particles of<br>
the tube. The targeted components would attach to the tube wall and remain there during any<br>
pre-analytic steps. Accordingly, samples would be enriched during the collection process<br>
and, after centrifugation, the enriched samples could be used directly from the primary tube<br>
or transferred to a secondary container.<br>
[0059] In another embodiment, as depicted in FIG. 14, the reservoir can be formed by a<br>
syringe barrel and stopper assembly. The syringe 20 would comprise syringe body 22 having<br>
distal end 27 and proximal end 25, a stopper 31 axially movable within the syringe body, and<br>
a distal end 30 for mating with a needle assembly 37. The distal end for mating with a needle<br>
assembly could, in one embodiment, comprise a frusta-conical tapered male luer 28, thereby<br>
providing a conduit from the reservoir to and through the distal male luer taper. Typically, a<br>
hypodermic needle comprising a female luer hub with a distally extending lumen forming a<br>
conduit from the female luer to the distal lumen tip, would be employed onto the frustoconical<br>
tapered male luer on the distal end of the syringe body.<br>
[0060] In other embodiments, the distal end for mating with a needle assembly could<br>
comprise an elastomeric access seal so that a cannula integral with a needle assembly can<br>
puncture the elastomeric access seal thus establishing fluid communication with the reservoir.<br>
The needle assembly would comprise both an elastomeric seal puncture cannula and a venous<br>
access cannula such as a stainless steel needle. Specifically, the elastomeric seal puncture<br>
cannula would pierce through the elastomeric access seal to establish fluid communication<br>
between the reservoir and a patient's vein. In certain embodiments, the needle assembly<br>
would have hook elements to reversibly mate to lugs radially extending from the distal<br>
portion of the syringe barrel. Examples of such devices are found, for example, in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,449,539, the disclosure of which is iiereby incorporated by reference.<br>
[0061 ] Svringe body 22 houses an axially movable stopper 31, as known in the art.<br>
Preferably, a plunger rod 32 integral to stopper 31 extends proximally from stopper 31 and<br>
can be manipulated by a user to move stopper 31 along the axis of syringe body 22.<br>
Movement of the stopper causes compression or expansion of the reservoir. According to<br>
the present invention, affinity molecules (not shown) are positioned inside the reservoir. In<br>
certain embodiments, the affinity molecules are placed on the inner sidewalls of the syringe<br>
body, hi other embodiments, the affinity molecules are attached to one or more inserts<br>
disposed w i i h i n the reservoir of the syringe assembly. It is possible to provide an initial<br>
-.pace lxiv,x-en UK; stopper and the distal end of the syringe body to provide space for such<br>
inserts to be present prior to collection. In further embodiments, affinity molecules are<br>
placed on the one or more inserts and on the inner sidewalls of the syringe. Preferably, the<br>
inserts would include microparticles or beads. In some embodiments, the inserts would be<br>
small enough to be able to exit the reservoir without disassembling the assembly such as<br>
t . v i i i n g ilv,: lumen extending through the male luer taper or the lumen of the cannula<br>
punciunnj.: UK '.-Lui.urneric seal described above. In other embodiments, the inserts would<br>
be large enouyh to be retained within the reservoir, or a mesh or filter can be provided to<br>
prevent exit 01 smaller inserts such as microparticles. In further embodiments, a combination<br>
of inserts large enough to be retained within the reservoir and small enough to be able to exit<br>
the reservoir delimited by the syringe barrel and stopper may be present. In the embodiments<br>
described above, the inserts can be comprised of particles that do and do not respond to<br>
magnetic fields placed near the syringe barrel assembly.<br>
[0062] Illustrated in FIG. 15 is another embodiment of the present invention in which the<br>
affinity molecules 410 are placed in a conduit 426 that communicates between a collection<br>
vessel and a venous access element. The venous access element may include catheters,<br>
blood collection sets, dialysis needle sets, fluid administration sets, hemodialysis needle sets,<br>
aphaeresis needles, blood bags attached to tubing with port access elements or skin puncture<br>
needles, and the like. In some embodiments, the venous access point ci.n directly access a<br>
vein through a purcutancous puncture or indirectly by accessing a port that is in fluid<br>
communication with a vein. The conduit is preferably a flexible section of polymer tubing<br>
such as FVC- Affinity molecules can be disposed inside the conduit directly by adherence to<br>
the conduit's inner sidewall surface 428. Alternately, affinity molecules can be disposed<br>
inside the conduit by disposing inserts such as beads or microparticles inside the conduit.<br>
The size and shape of the inserts can be such that they are maintained inside the conduit and<br>
are restricted front traveling freely within the conduit because of size restrictions or other<br>
elements added to retain their location.<br>
[0063] FIG. 1 5 shows a blood collection set 420 with an intravenous puncture needle 422, a<br>
reservoir access needle 424, and a conduit 426, which contains affinity molecules 410,<br>
extending therebetween. Integrated to intravenous puncture needle 422 is a wing element<br>
430 extending laterally on both sides of the intravenous puncture needle. The wing element<br>
also establishes a hub 432 that helps interface conduit 426 to the inner lumen of intravenous<br>
puncture ivjsdle 422. Conduit 426 can directly or indirectly interface with reservoir access<br>
needle -\"1~\. Indirectly, conduit 426 can be integral with a female luered connector that is<br>
further integrated to a male luer hub bonded to the reservoir access needle. Preferably,<br>
surrounding reservoir access need;e 424 would be a collection container holder 440 that<br>
facilitates the connection of a bloo 1 collection tube or blood culture bottle to blood collection<br>
itt 420. Additionally, a shield elei v.'nt may be disposed on or about the distal portion of the<br>
conduit to provide shielding of the listal tip of the intravenous access needle. In additional<br>
embodiments, the intravenous punc ure needle can be replaced by a valve such as a lueractivated<br>
valve. Examples of luer a ;t.ivated valves include the Alarais SmartSite® Needleless<br>
valve sold by Alaris Medical S /stems and the Clave® valve sold by ICU Medical.<br>
Alternatively, the intravenous punc lire needle can be replaced by a stop-cock port or possibly<br>
a split septum port such as the Interlink® system sold by Baxter International, Inc.<br>
