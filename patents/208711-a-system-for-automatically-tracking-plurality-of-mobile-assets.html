The invention relates to a system for automatically tracking plurality of mobile assets such as goods in veliicles over long distances.<br>
Tracking mobile assets at short distances often use wireless sets. For long distance tracking of mobile assets, global positioning system can be iised. However this is ver&gt;' expensive and not economical for tracking mobile assets carried across tlie country* tlirougli tiiicks. Another system for tracking make use of swipe card are provided with the driver and equipments for swiping the sv^ipe card are located at stations such as shops or petrol bunks in the root of the vehicles. The driver is expected to swipe the card at the stations *when he reaches and this information is passed to a central tracking station. This has been found not very effective since the machine kept at various stations are not always accessible to the drivers round tlie clock.<br>
The invention provides an economic system for automatically tracking mobile assets over long distances using global system for mobile (GSM) communication network. The system according to the invention is capable of tracking the mobile     assests     automatically     and     if    required     provide<br><br>
instructions to the driver of tlie veliicle carrying the mobile assests. The mobile assests are provided with proprietary access devices which are in constant contact with communication towers of GSM communication network. The location based information of the mobile assests will be the location based information of the nearest GSM communication tower and this information is transferred through the GSM communication network to a central command center. The central command center is equipped witli a computer installed witli a custom made software. The central command center updates tlie data base, provide instructions to the unit located with the mobile assests and pass the information to corporate web servers and to anv other desired terminals based on security and password protocols.<br>
Thus the invention provides a system for automatically tracking plurality- of mobile assets, said system comprising a unit located witli each mobile assets to be tracked and a unit located at a command center, said unit located with each mobile assets comprising a global system for mobile (GSM) communication engine provided with an antenna for transmitting and receiving signals in accordance with GSM communication   protocols,    a    processor    provided    with    an<br><br>
embedded software for (i) linking die GSM communication engine to a nearest GSM communication tower; (ii) collecting location based information of the said nearest GSM communication tower, (iii) packaging and encrypting the information along with real time and required propriety information and (iv) commanding transmission of this package to said command center; a pre-programmed timer connected to the said processor for timing the transmission of tlie information to tlie command center; an inputting device for feeding required data to the said processor and a display connected to tlie said processor for displaying information required at the mobile asset: and said unit located at the command center is a programmed computer Hnked to a server of the GSM network for processing the information received, generate commands and update database; and a server loaded with the data base for making tracking information available to desired terminals and autherised users.<br>
Witli reference to the accompanying drawings :<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the unit located with the mobile asset; and<br><br>
Figure 2 shows a flow chart showing the operation of the system according to the invention.<br>
The unit located with the mobile asset comprises a GSM engine (1) with an antei-ma to communicate with the nearest GSM tower. The GSM communication engine (1) receives command signals from a processor (3) provided with a dedicated software. The processor is also connected to an mputing device (4) such as key board, a display device (5) for displaying information at the location of the mobile asset and a pre-programmed timer (6) for timing the transmission from tlie unit located with the mobile asset. In a prefered embodiment the GSM communication engine (1) may be provided with a sim card holder for carrying a sim card of a mobile service provideer The information form the mobile assets are received at the nearest GSM communication tower and passed to the GSM communication tower closest to a command center. The unit located at tlie command center is a computer witli a dedicated software, which acts as a messaging platform. The computer is provided with a database comprising the information about each mobile asset and their current location. The database gets updated automatically by receiving information from the unit located with the mobile assets.   This<br><br>
information  may  be   transferred   to  a   web   server  which   is accessible by authorized users through security protocols.<br>
The command center and web server are capable of providing a map showing the location of the mobile assets dynamically and on a real time basis with their identities.<br>
The automatic tracking system of mobile assets according to tlie invention can be effectively and economically used with existing GSM communication network. It provides accurate information about die mobile assets continuously which can be used for efficiently managing fleet of trucks, plying long distances, transporting goods. The system is suitable for realising an integrated tracking system for vehicles such as trucks travelling long distances with goods. The information regarding the mobile assets may be accessed tlirough internet by autherised persons and the required securiy and software protocols can be provided to the system.<br><br><br><br>
I CLAIM :<br>
1. A system for automatically tracking plurality of mobile assets and communicating with each of them from at least one command center, said system comprising a unit located with each of said mobile assets to be tracked and a unit located in said command center said unit located with each said mobile assets comprising a global system for mobile (GSM) communication engine (1) provided with an antenna (2) for transmitting and receiving signals in accordance with GSM communication protocols, a processor (3) provided with an embedded software for (i) linking the GSM communication engine (1) to a nearest GSM communication tower; (ii) collecting location based information of the said nearest GSM communication tower; (iii) packaging and encrypting tlie information along with real time, and required propriety' information and (iv) commanding transmission of tliis package to said central command center; a pre-programmed timer (4) connected to the said processor (3) for timing the transmission of the information to the command center; an inputting device (5) for feeding required data to the processor (3): a display (6) connected   to    the    said    processor    (3)    for    displaying    the<br><br>
information required at the mobile asset; and said unit located at the command center is a programmed computer linked to the a server of the GSM network for processing the information received, generate commands and update database; and a server loaded with the data base for making tracking information available to desired terminals and authorised users.<br>
2. A system for tracking plurality of mobile assets as claimed in claim 1, wherein the said GSM engine is provided witli a sim card holder to receive a sim card of a cellular service provider.<br>
3. A system for tracking plurality of mobile assets as claimed in claim 1, wherein the said inputting device of the unit located with the mobile asset is a key board and/or a mouse.<br>
4. A system for tracking plurality of mobile assets as claimed in claim 1, wherein the said server at the central command center is linked through internet to a web server provided with security protocols.<br><br>
