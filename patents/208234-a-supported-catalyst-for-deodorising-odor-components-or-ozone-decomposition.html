SUPPORTED CATALYSTS, PREPARATION AND USE THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a supported catalyst having a catalytic material supported on a carrier which is substantially nonadsorptive of specific components in malodor, deleterious or other objectionable gases that are to be removed or decomposed, thereby preventing the emission of unpleasant odors and other undesirable phenomena due to said particular components. The invention also relates to an improved aluminum-supported catalyst with upgraded adhesion between the carrier and a catalyst layer of the catalytic material supported thereon. The invention further relates to processes for producing such supported catalysts, as well as a direct-cool refrigerator assembled therein. BACKGROUND ART<br>
With a view to purifying malodorous and deleterious gases by removing therefrom various substances (hereinafter collectively referred to as "odor components") that are composed of SOx, nitrogen compounds such as NOx, ammonia and amines, alcohols, aldehydes, organic acids such as acetic acid and sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, mercaptan, dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide in atmospheric air, there have so far been developed many techniques and methods that rely upon the use of adsorbents, e.g. porous ceramics such as activated alumina and silica gel, zeolites, activated carbon and the like.<br>
Conventional deodorizing filters have been prepared by having deodorizing catalysts supported on porous ceramic or zeolite carriers capable of adsorbing odor components. The capability of such filters is not limited to decomposition of the odor components in the objectionable gases of interest by means of the deodorizing catalyst; due to the large pore volumes in the carrier, the odor components and the reaction products resulting from the catalytic deodorization can be effectively adsorbed thereon or stored therein to thereby abate the odor components. However, the odor components and the reaction products that have been<br><br>
adsorbed thereon or stored therein are so sensitive to changes in environmental factors such as temperature and humidity that they are liable to desorb from the deodorizing filter to thereby give off an unpleasant smell.<br>
Aluminum honeycomb structures have good weathering properties and high durability, and their walls can be made very thin; hence, the pressure drop that will develop in the structures is sufficiently reduced to make them suitable for use as catalyst supports in high-volume processing operations.<br>
According to Unexamined Japanese Utility Model Public Disclosure Nos. 21736/1989 and 87235/1990, as well as Japanese Patent Public Disclosure Nos. 303518/1990 and 303523/1990, aluminum foil honeycomb structures in which the cell separating walls in the filter are made thin enough to reduce the pressure drop across the filter can be applied to ozone decomposing catalysts. However, none of these patents teach or suggest the applicability of the structures to deodorizing catalysts on the basis of the fact that aluminum foils are substantially incapable of adsorbing odor components.<br>
Compared to porous ceramics, aluminum carriers are low in water content and have a smooth surface. These have presented a problem in that if a catalyst layer is supported on the aluminum carrier, the insufficient strength of support often contributes to the separation of the catalyst layer therefrom under external stresses such as mechanical distortions and vibrations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object, therefore, of the present invention is to provide a novel supported catalyst which, in the face of environmental changes, will not emit by itself any of the deleterious components that are to be removed or decomposed for abatement of unpleasant odors and other objectionable substances.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel aluminum supported catalyst that is improved in the strength of adhesion between an aluminum carrier and a<br><br>
catalyst layer supported thereon.<br>
The present inventors conducted intensive studies in order to improve the strength of adhesion between an aluminum carrier and the catalyst layer. As a result, it was found that when the aluminum carrier supporting the catalyst layer was immersed in a weak alkaline aqueous solution, an aluminum component was dissolving out from the aluminum carrier, and incorporated and precipitated in the catalyst layer so as that the aluminum carrier became integral with the catalyst layer to achieve a marked improvement in the strength of adhesion between the aluminum carrier and the catalyst layer, thus making it difficult for the catalyst layer to separate from the aluminum carrier. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of this finding.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a refrigerator, particularly direct-cool refrigerator that is assembled with the supported catalyst of the invention that is prevented from emitting unpleasant odors in the face of environmental changes, particularly those in temperature.<br>
According to its first aspect, the present invention relates to a supported catalyst characterized by having a catalytic material supported on a carrier that substantially lacks the ability to adsorb components to be removed or decomposed.<br>
According to its second aspect, the present invention relates to an aluminum-supported catalyst characterized in that an aluminum component dissolving out from an aluminum carrier has been incorporated and precipitated in the catalyst layer supported thereon so as that the aluminum carrier has become integral with the catalyst layer unitarily.<br>
According to its third aspect, the present invention relates to a process for producing the stated aluminum-supported catalyst by immersing an aluminum carrier supporting a catalyst layer thereon in a weak alkaline aqueous solution.<br><br>
According to its fourth aspect, the present invention relates to a direct-cool refrigerator assembled with said supported catalyst. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>

The support or carrier material for the supported catalyst according to the first aspect of the invention is not limited to any particular type insofar as it is substantially deficient of the ability to adsorb specific odor components to be removed or decomposed. Preferred examples include nonadsorptive ceramics such as a-alumina, cordierite and mullite, metals, particularly stainless steel which is resistant to corrosion, as well as elementary aluminum and aluminum layer-covered metals that are lightweight and easy to handle. The carrier of the catalyst of the invention can be shaped to various forms including a honeycomb, a corrugation, a plate, a foil, a screen and a wool; these forms are preferred since their combinations can be processed to geometrical shapes that fit diverse purposes. In order to reduce the pressure drop it undergoes, the carrier is preferably shaped into a honeycomb structure and a particularly preferred support is a honeycomb structure made of an aluminum foil. This type of carrier can be prepared by a known method for producing a laminate for a honeycomb structure as described in Japanese Patent Public Disclosure No. 338065/1993. The use of metal foils is very advantageous for the purpose of reducing the pressure loss and they can be processed and produced at an incomparably low cost. The thickness of metal foils can be selected at any values from the range of 10- 200 µm. A particularly preferred range is 10 - 50 µm, with the range of 10 - 30 µm being the most preferred.<br>
The catalytic material to be used in the supported catalyst according to the first aspect of the invention is not limited to any particular type insofar as it is capable of decomposing or removing a specific component such as odor<br><br>
components that is to be decomposed or removed. If the catalytic material is to be used for deodorizing or ozone decomposition, platinum group elements such as platinum, palladium, osmium, iridium and rhodium, iron group elements such as iron, cobalt and nickel, elements of group I such as copper and silver, elements of group VII such as manganese and rare earth metals such as cerium and lanthanum may be used as catalytic materials either independently or in appropriate combinations in either an elementary, oxide or complex form. Hopcalite which is a complex of manganese and copper can be used as a preferred deodorizing catalytic material.<br>
The catalytic material is generally supported on the carrier in an amount of 0.1 - 50 grams per liter, preferably 0.5 - 30 grams per liter. In the case that the supported catalyst is to be used as a deodorizer, if the catalytic material is supported in an amount of less than 0.1 gram per liter, it may fail to exhibit the desired deodorizing performance. If more than 50 grams per liter of the catalytic material is supported, the supported catalytic material will adsorb by itself the odor components that has to be removed or decomposed and the deodorizing filter will give off an unpleasant odors.<br>
The catalytic material can be supported by any conventional method such as the slurry method using inorganic binders such as silica and alumina sols or organic binders such as natural resins (e.g. starch, casein or gelatin) and various water-soluble synthetic resins including cellulose, water-soluble polyamides and quaternary ammonium salts. A particularly preferred binder is a water-base acrylic urethane resin coating because it gives a glossy and thick film and exhibits high hardness, high chemical resistance, good deflection (flexing properties) and high wear resistance.<br>
If an inorganic binder is to be used, the weight ratio of the binder to the catalytic material is generally 1:5 to 1:20, preferably 1:6 to 1:12; if an organic binder is to be used, the weight ratio of the binder to the catalytic<br><br>
material is 1:5 to 1:40, preferably 1:7 to 1:20.  If the binder, whether inorganic or organic, is used in an unduly small amount, the necessary strength of support is not attained and the catalytic material will readily separate from the support, a defect generally called "flaking" or "shedding".  If the binder is used in an excessively large amount, the catalytic material is covered by the binder and fails to exhibit the intended catalytic activity.<br>
According to the second aspect of the invention, a catalyst layer of the catalytic material may be supported on an aluminum carrier. According to the third aspect of the invention, the aluminum-supported catalyst is manufactured by leaching an aluminum component from the aluminum carrier such that leached aluminum component is incorporated and precipitated into the catalyst layer so as to form a unitary body integral with the aluminum carrier and the catalyst layer as described hereinafter. Specifically, a catalyst layer of the catalytic material is supported on an aluminum carrier; after drying, the dried aluminum-supported catalyst is immersed in a weak alkaline aqueous solution; if the pH of the alkaline aqueous solution is adjusted between 7 and 10, preferably between 8.5 and 9.5, aluminum on the surface of the aluminum carrier will react with the alkali in the aqueous solution very slowly, thereby causing an aluminum component such as aluminum hydroxide to leach out. The leached aluminum component is incorporated into the catalyst layer supported thereon and precipitated in its interstices to become integral with it; in this way, the catalyst layer is firmly fixed and secured to the aluminum carrier, thereby achieving a marked improvement in the strength of support of the catalyst layer thereon.<br>
If the dipping process is performed in a strong alkaline aqueous solution, the aluminum carrier will give hydrogen gas from the surface of the carrier as it reacts with the alkali so violently that the catalyst layer will separate from the carrier. Hopcalite which is a complex oxide of copper and manganese is an effective catalytic component for deodorizing or ozone decomposition. Since<br><br>
hopcalite contains 1 - 4% of potassium, the aluminum carrier supporting it needs only to be dipped in water so that the contained potassium will dissolve out therefrom to provide the desired pH.<br>
The dipping time depends largely upon the pH of the alkaline aqueous solution and the required volume of treatment with the supported catalyst; it ranges generally from 5 to 48 hours, preferably from 5 to 24 hours.  If the dipping time is unduly prolonged, the surface of the catalyst layer will be covered with the precipitated aluminum hydroxide; this is effective for increasing the strength of support but, on the other hand, the catalytic activity may occasionally be reduced.<br>
According to the fourth aspect of the invention, the supported catalyst having a catalytic material supported on a carrier that substantially lacks the ability to adsorb components to be removed or decomposed may be installed in a refrigerator, particularly a direct-cool one, in positions near the chilling section thereof. Upon turning the chilling section on and off, the temperature in the refrigerating compartment will change cyclically and natural convection will occur accordingly in the internal air to accomplish effective removal of the odor components from the refrigerating compartment. This is only possible by the supported catalyst according to the first aspect of the invention which is less likely to give off unpleasant odor components in the face of environmental changes such as temperature changes or even in a humid condition.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a supported catalyst for deodorizing odor components or for ozone decomposition, which is composed of a carrier and a catalytic material supported on the carrier, wherein the catalytic material is a hopcalite, the carrier is in the form of a metal foil or a metal sheet made of aluminum, aluminum layer-covered metals or stainless steel, the shape of the catalytic material is honeycomb-like, corrugation-like, plate-like or screen-like, the catalytic material is supported on the carrier as a layer by using an organic binder of water-soluble synthetic resin as a binder, and wherein the weight ratio of the binder to the catalytic material is from 1:5 to 1:40.<br>
The following working and comparative examples as well as tests are provided for the purpose of further illustrating the present invention but are in no way to be taken as limiting. Example 1<br>
Ion-exchanged water (1824 g) was mixed with 220 g of a water-based urethane<br>
resin coating (water-based urethane MOKUBU CLEAR, the trade name of Washin<br>
Kagaku Kogyo K.K.). Thereafter 100g of hopcalite (N-840, the trade name of Nissan<br>
Girdler Catalyst Co. Ltd. containing 20.5 wt.% CuO,	<br><br>
54.4 wt.% MnO and 2.6 wt.% K) was added and the mixture was stirred to prepare a slurry solution. The slurry solution was then sprayed over an aluminum foil honeycomb support (product of Oji Kenzai Kogyo K.K.; 350 cells/in2; 35.5 mm x 69 mm x 10 mm), which had been fabricated by expanding a laminate of 15 µm  thick aluminum foils. The excess slurry solution was blown off by a jet of air and the assembly was dried at a temperature of 150°C for 1 hour to prepare aluminum foil honeycomb-supported catalyst A having 26.4 g of hopcalite and 2.6 g of urethane resin supported per liter of the catalyst. Example 2<br>
Ion-exchanged water (778 g) was mixed with an alumina sol (ALUMINA SOL, the trade name of Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd.). Thereafter, 1000 g of hopcalite (N-840, the trade name of Nissan Girdler Catalyst Co., Ltd.; containing 20.5 wt.% CuO, 54.4 wt.% MnO and 2.6 wt.% K) was added and the mixture was stirred to prepare a slurry solution. The slurry solution was sprayed over an aluminum foil honeycomb support (product of Oji Kenzai Kogyo K.K.; 350 cells/in2; 35.5 mm x 69 mm x 10 mm), which had been fabricated as described in Example 1. The excess slurry solution was blown off by a jet of air and the assembly was dried at a temperature of 150°C for 1 hour to prepare aluminum foil honeycomb-supported catalyst B having 27.3 g of hopcalite and 2.7 g of alumina supported per liter of the catalyst. Example 3<br>
The same slurry solution as prepared in Example 2 was sprayed over a cordierite honeycomb support (product of NGK INSULATORS, LTD.; 400 cells/in2; 35.5 mm x 69 mm x 10 mm) and the excess slurry solution was blown off with a jet of air. Thereafter, the assembly was dried at a temperature of 150°C for 1 hour to prepare cordierite honeycomb-supported catalyst C having 28.5 g of hopcalite and 2.8 g alumina supported per liter of the catalyst. Comparative Example 1<br>
Ion-exchanged water (614 g) was mixed with an alumina<br><br>
sol (ALUMINA SOL 200, the trade name of Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd.). Thereafter, 700 g of hopcalite (N-840, the trade name of Nissan Girdler Catalyst Co., Ltd.; containing 20.5 wt.% CuO, 54.4 wt.% MnO and 2.6 wt.% K) and 249 g of a pentacil-type zeolite (PURASHIVE-420, the trade name of UOP; silica-to-alumina ratio a 400) were added and the mixture was stirred to prepare a slurry solution. The slurry solution was sprayed over HONEYCLE support (product of NICHIAS CORP.; 350 cells/in2 35.5 mm x 69 mm x 10 mm; BET surface area = 120 m2/g), which was a honeycomb structure fabricated by laminating sheets of ceramic fibers bound together with a silicate gel. The excess slurry solution was blown off with a jet of air and, thereafter, the assembly was dried at a temperature of 150°C for 1 hour to prepare HONEYCLE-supported catalyst X having 2.49 g of hopcalite, 10.7 g of zeolite and 4.0 g of alumina supported per liter of the catalyst.<br>
Test 1<br>
Samples of supported catalyst were each cut to a size of 35.5 mm x 69 mm x 10 mm and installed in a refrigerator for use in an average home consisting of a husband, a wife and two children. After one month, each sample filter was taken out of the refrigerator and left for one hour in a 16-L closed glass container adjusted to a temperature of 26°C and a humidity of 95%. Thereafter, the intensity of the odor within the glass container was measured by an olfactory test according to the following hexadic scale; 0 = no odor, 1 = barely perceivable (detection threshold level), 2 = perceivable (recognition threshold level), 3 = distinct, 4 = strong, 5 = very strong, and 6 = overpowering. The results are shown in Table 1 below. Ethyl alcohol was the most abundant of the sample gases that were detected in the olfactory test by means of an FPD gas chromatographic analyzer.<br><br>

As is clear from Table 1, the conventional porous HONEYCLE carrier and the catalyst having a deodorizing catalytic material supported on that porous HONEYCLE carrier, both of which had been exposed to various malodors in the refrigerator, gave off unpleasant odors in a high humid condition.  In contrast, the aluminum foil honeycomb carrier used in Examples 1 and 2, the catalysts A and B having a deodorizing catalytic material supported on that carrier, as well as the cordierite honeycomb carrier used in Example 3 and the catalyst C having the same deodorizing catalytic material supported on that honeycomb carrier were less likely to give off unpleasant odors in the face of a temperature change in a high humid condition. This provides a support of the fact that the supported catalysts of the invention having a deodorizing catalytic material supported on the aluminum foil honeycomb carrier and the cordierite honeycomb carrier are both nonadsorptive of odor components are less likely to give off unpleasant odors in the face of environmental changes.<br>
Test 2<br>
Samples of supported catalyst each cut to a size of 35.5 mm x 69 mm x 10 mm were installed in a 16-L closed<br><br>
glass container adjusted to a temperature of 5°C and a humidity of 50%. The glass container was injected with specified amounts of three odor components, i.e. ethyl acetate, ethyl alcohol and toluene. The adsorption isotherms of the three catalyst samples were measured for each odor component and the saturated adsorption (mg) of one unit of each catalyst sample was determined for each odor component at an equilibrium concentration of 100 ppm. The results are shown in Table 2 below.<br><br>
As is clear from Table 2, both the conventional porous HONEYCLE carrier used in Comparative Example 1 and the Catalyst X having a deodorizing catalytic material supported on that porous carrier adsorbed large amounts of ethyl acetate, ethyl alcohol and toluene. In contrast, the aluminum foil honeycomb carrier used in Example 1, the cordierite honeycomb carrier used in Example 3, as well as the Catalyst A having deodorizing catalytic material supported on the aluminum foil honeycomb carrier and the Catalyst C having the same deodorizing catalytic material supported on the cordierite honeycomb carrier adsorbed only<br><br>
about a tenth of those odor components. This provides a support of the fact that the supported catalysts of the invention were substantially nonadsorptive of odor components. Test 3<br>
Samples of supported catalyst each cut to a size of 35.5 mm x 69 mm x 10 mm were installed in a 16-L closed glass container, which in turn was injected with 200 µL of 99.5% ethyl alcohol. The glass container was left for 2 hours in a refrigerator adjusted to a humidity of 50% and a temperature of 5°C. Thereafter, the catalyst samples were taken out of the glass container and transferred in to a 100-L closed glass container adjusted to room temperature and 95% humidity. After 5 minutes, the concentration (ppm) of ethyl alcohol in the 100-L glass container was measured with an FID gas chromatographic analyzer. The results are shown in Table 3 below.<br><br>
As is clear from Table 3, ethyl alcohol which is a representative causative factor of the malodors in refrigerators was emitted in large amounts in a humid<br><br>
condition from the conventional HONEYCLE carrier used in Comparative Example 1 which was adsorptive of odor components, as well as from the Catalyst X having a deodorizing catalytic materials supported on that HONEYCLE carrier. In contrast, the aluminum foil honeycomb carrier and the cordierite honeycomb carrier that were specified by the invention as carriers substantially nonadsorptive of odor components, as well as the Catalysts A and B of Examples 1 and 2, respectively, which had a deodorizing catalytic material supported on the aluminum foil honeycomb carrier and the Catalyst C having the same deodorizing catalytic material supported on the cordierite honeycomb carrier emitted ethyl alcohol in amounts no more than a seventh of the concentrations emitted from the comparative porous samples. This provides a proof of the fact that the supported catalysts of the invention which have a deodorizing catalytic material supported on carriers substantially nonadsorptive of odor components are less likely to give off unpleasant odors in the face of environmental changes. Test 4<br>
Samples of supported catalyst each cut to a cylindrical shape of 21 mm in diameter and 10 mm in thickness were installed in a flow-type reactor, through which a sample gas containing 100 ppm of methylmercaptan and having ambient temperature and humidity was passed at a flow rate of 90,000 liters per hour. Thirty minutes after starting the passage of the sample gas, the concentration of methyl mercaptan was measured at both the entrance and exit of the reactor by means of an FPD gas chromatographic analyzer and the percent removal of methyl mercaptan after 30 min was calculated. The results are shown in Table 4 below.<br><br><br>
As is clear from Table 4, the Catalysts A and B of Examples 1 and 2 of the invention having a deodorizing catalytic material supported on the aluminum carrier which was substantially nonadsorptive of odor components, as well as the Catalyst C of Example 3 having the same deodorizing catalytic material supported on the cordierite honeycomb carrier which was also substantially nonadsorptive of odor components were no less effective in removing methyl mercaptan (a representative malodorous substance emitted from foods, in particular, proteins) than the Catalyst X of Comparative Example 1 which had a deodorizing catalytic material supported on the conventional porous carrier adsorptive of odor components. This provides a proof of the fact that although the supported catalysts of the invention have a deodorizing catalytic material supported on carriers that are substantially nonadsorptive of odor components, the action of the deodorizing catalytic material is sufficient to ensure satisfactory performance in removing methyl mercaptan.<br>
Example 4<br>
Three samples of aluminum foil honeycomb-supported catalyst were prepared as in Example 1, except that the amount of hopcalite to be supported was varied by adjusting the spray frequency of the slurry solution. These samples were subjected to an olfactory test in accordance with the procedure described in Test 1. The results are shown in Figure 1, from which one can see that the emission of an<br><br>
unpleasant odor became perceivable when more than 50 g of hopcalite was supported per liter of the deodorizing filter. Comparative Example 2<br>
Ion-exchanged water (778 g) was mixed with 830 g of an alumina sol (ALUMINA SOL 200, the trade name of Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd,)• Thereafter, 1000 g of hopcalite (N-840, the trade name of Nissan Girdler Catalyst Co. Ltd.; containing 20.5 wt.% CuO, 54.4 wt.% MnO and 2.6 wt.% K) was added and the mixture was stirred to prepare a slurry solution. The slurry solution was sprayed over a honeycomb carrier (product of Oji Kenzai Kogyo K.K.; 350 cells/in2; 35.5 mm x 69 mm x 10 mm) which was fabricated by expanding a laminate of 15-µm thick aluminum foils. The excess slurry solution was blown off with a jet of air and the assembly was dried at a temperature of 150°C for 1 hour to prepare aluminum foil honeycomb-supported Catalyst Y having 27.3 g of hopcalite and 2.7 g of alumina supported per liter of the catalyst.<br>
Example 5<br>
A portion (300 mL) of the aluminum foil honeycomb-supported Catalyst Y prepared in Comparative Example 2 was immersed in 200 mL of water for 24 hours. The catalyst was recovered from the water and dried at a temperature of 150°C for 1 hour to prepare aluminum foil honeycomb-supported Catalyst D which was an improved version of the aluminum foil honeycomb-supported Catalyst Y. After the immersion treatment, water had a pH of 9.27. The improved aluminum foil honeycomb-supported Catalyst D was found to be 1.05 g heavier than the Catalyst Y of Comparative Example 2 which was not treated by immersing in water. This was probably because part of the surface of the aluminum carrier reacted with the alkali in the water to become a water-soluble aluminum component such as aluminum hydroxide.<br>
The aluminum foil honeycomb-supported Catalyst Y of Comparative Example 2 and the Catalyst D of Example 5 which was improved according to the invention were examined for a cross section of their surface portion of the catalyst under an electron microscope at a magnification of 200 and the<br><br>
results are shown as photomicrographs in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. The electron microscope was a SEM of JEOL LTD. operated at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV.<br>
Figurer 2 obviously shows that the aluminum carrier 1 of the Catalyst Y supported the catalyst layer 2 containing a number of interstices 3. According to Figurer 3, the surface of the aluminum carrier 1 in the improved Catalyst D was eroded by immersing in the weak alkaline aqueous solution, whereupon part of its surface changed to an aluminum component such as aluminum hydroxide which, in turn, dissolved out, causing a coarse surface 4 to form; the catalyst layer 2 had void 3, into which the aluminum component 5 such as aluminum hydroxide was incorporated and precipitated, thereby causing to form a unitary body integral with the catalyst layer 2 and the aluminum carrier 1. Analysis by X-ray diffraction verified that the precipitate in the voids 3 was an aluminum-containing component.<br>
Test 5<br>
Samples of supported catalyst each cut to a cube of 10 mm on each side were dropped three times on a test table from a height of 80 cm. The weight of each sample was measured after the drop test and the amount of separation of the catalyst layer was determined on the basis of the difference from the initial weight. The results are shown in Table 5 below.<br>

Catalyst Y of Comparative Example 2<br>
As is clear from Table 5, the improved Catalyst D of Example 5 experienced a much smaller separation of the catalyst layer than the Catalyst Y of Comparative Example 2 which was not treated by immersing in water. This provides a support of the fact that the aluminum-supported catalyst<br><br>
of the invention which was characterized by integration of an aluminum component such as aluminum hydroxide from the aluminum carrier into the supported catalyst layer has a sufficient strength of support to secure resistance against separation of the supported catalyst layer. Example 6<br>
Aluminum foil honeycomb-supported Catalyst E having 0.7 3 g of hopcalite and 0.07 g of a urethane resin supported per catalyst on an aluminum foil honeycomb carrier was prepared as in Example 1, except that the honeycomb carrier had a different number of cells (500 cells/in2). Example 7<br>
Aluminum foil honeycomb-supported Catalysts Ff G and H having different amounts of hopcalite (0.65 g, 0.73 g and 0.78 g) and a urethane resin (0.06 g, 0.07 g and 0.08 g) supported per catalyst on aluminum foil honeycomb carriers were prepared as in Example 1, except that the carriers each measuring 71 mm x 69 mm x 10 mm had 350, 500 and 750 cells/in2. Example 8<br>
A 0.3-mm thick aluminum plate of a size of 71 mm x 69 mm was provided. In addition, a 0.05-mm thick aluminum foil was corrugated as shown in Figure 4. The aluminum plate was brush-coated with the same slurry solution as used in Example 1 and dried at a temperature of 150°C to prepare supported catalyst I having 0.15 g of hopcalite and 0.01 g of a urethane resin supported per catalyst on the aluminum plate. In a separate step, the aluminum corrugated foil was brush-coated with the same slurry as used in Example 1 and dried at a temperature of 150°C to prepare aluminum corrugated foil-supported Catalyst J having 0.25 g of hopcalite and 0.03 g of a urethane resin supported per catalyst on the corrugated aluminum foil. Example 9<br>
A stainless steel (SUS-304) plain wave screen of 20 mesh/in2 (see Figure 5; wire diameter, 0.5 mm; screen opening, 0.77 mm) was dipped in the same slurry solution as used in Example 1. The screen was recovered and the excess<br><br>
slurry solution was blown off with a jet of air. The assembly was then dried at a temperature of 150°C to prepare stainless steel screen-supported Catalyst K having 0.16 g of hopcalite and 0.02 g of a urethane resin supported per catalyst on the stainless steel screen. Test 6<br>
Measurement of time-dependent changes in the temperature distribution in a direct-cool refrigerator:<br>
A direct-cool refrigerator of the type shown in Figure 6 was used.  It had a chilling section provided in the wall farthest from the front door and the interior of refrigerating compartment was cooled by the internal natural convection of air. A thermocouple was set in the following four positions to measure the temperatures in those positions: A on the farthest wall of the refrigerating compartment where the chilling section was provided; B on a side wall; C on the top wall; and D which was the center of the refrigerating compartment. The temperature in the refrigerating compartment was represented by the temperature in position D. The time profiles of the respective temperatures are shown graphically in Figure 7. The refrigerator under test was not equipped with a fan to forcibly agitate the internal air and the cooling of the interior of the refrigerator was solely cooled by natural convection under normal operating conditions.<br>
As is clear from Figure 7, the temperature of the farthest wall (in position A) where the chilling section of the refrigerating compartment was provided varied cyclically between 5 and 25°C at intervals of 40 minutes. On the other hand, the temperatures in positions B (on a side wall), C (on the top wall) and D (at the center) were substantially constant. Thus, the farthest wall of the refrigerator where its chilling section was provided experienced the greatest change in temperature and one can reasonably assume that the strongest convection is taking place near the farthest wall of the refrigerator.<br>
Test 7<br>
Various sample catalysts were set in specified<br><br>
positions (see Figure 6) in a direct-cool refrigerator having an internal capacity of 150 liters. After closing the front door, 1.8 mL of 100% methyl mercaptan was injected into the refrigerating compartment and the internal air was sampled at intervals of 20 minutes. The concentration of methyl mercaptan was measured with an FPD gas chromatographic analyzer and the results are shown in Figures 8-12. As in Test 6, no fan was used to forcibly agitate the air in the refrigerating compartment but its interior was cooled by natural convection under normal conditions.<br>
Figure 8 shows graphically effect of the position of catalyst installation by plotting the time profiles of the methyl mercaptan level for the case where the aluminum foil honeycomb-supported catalyst F of Example 7 was set in position A (on the farthest wall of the refrigerating compartment), B (on a sidewall), C (on the top wall) and D (in the center).<br>
As is clear from Figure 8, the removal of methyl mercaptan was the most effective when the deodorizing catalyst was set in position A on the farthest wall of the refrigerating compartment. This is in agreement with the assumption from Test 7, i.e., the strongest convection is occurring near the farthest wall of the refrigerating compartment where the chilling section was provided, thereby assuring the most effective contact between the deodorizing catalyst and the internal air. This provides a support of the fact that the highest deodorizing effect is attained by setting a deodorizing catalyst near the chilling section of a direct-cool refrigerator.<br>
Figure 9 shows how the efficiency of a deodorizing catalyst is affected by its cross-sectional area. The effect is shown graphically by the time profiles of the methyl mercaptan level for the case where the aluminum foil honeycomb-supported Catalyst E of Example 6 (35.5 mm x 69 mm x 10 mm) and the aluminum foil honeycomb-supported Catalyst G (71 mm x 69 mm x 5 mm) were set in position A on the farthest wall of the refrigerator. The two catalysts were<br><br>
the same in the number of cells and capacity but different in cross-sectional area.<br>
As is clear from Figure 9, the Catalyst G having a larger cross-sectional area than the Catalyst E having the same capacity and cell number could achieve more efficient removal of methyl mercaptan. This provides a support of the fact that the efficiency of a deodorizing catalyst increases with the increasing area that traverses an air flow.<br>
Figure 10 shows how the efficiency of a deodorizing catalyst is affected by its geometry. The effect is shown graphically by the time profiles of the methyl mercaptan level for the case where the aluminum plate-supported Catalyst I, the corrugated aluminum foil-supported Catalyst J (both being fabricated in Example 8) and the stainless steel screen-supported Catalyst K of Example 9 were set in position A on the farthest wall of the refrigerator. The three catalysts were the same in cross-sectional area but different in geometry.<br>
As is clear from Figure 10, the most efficient removal of methyl mercaptan was achieved by the Catalyst K having a grid pattern to provide an increased geometric surface area. It should, however, be noted that the Catalyst J supported on the corrugated aluminum foil and the Catalyst I supported on the aluminum plate were not very much inferior to the Catalyst K but achieved satisfactory removal of methyl mercaptan. This provides a support of the fact that the three types of deodorizing catalyst tested that have different geometric shapes are as effective as the honeycomb carrier supported catalysts.<br>
Figure 11 shows how the efficiency of a deodorizing catalyst is affected by the number of cells it has. The effect is shown graphically by the time profiles of the methyl mercaptan level for the case where the aluminum foil honeycomb-supported Catalysts F, G and H of Example 6 which had 350, 500 and 750 cells, respectively, per square inch were set in position A on the farthest wall of the refrigerating compartment.<br>
As is clear from Figure 11, the efficiency of removal<br><br>
of methyl mercaptan was improved by increasing the number of cells in a catalyst. This provides a support of the fact that the efficiency of a deodorizing catalytic material supported on a carrier having a honeycomb structure can be improved by increasing the number of cells it has.<br>
Figure 12 shows how the efficiency of a deodorizing catalyst is affected by the method of its installation. The effect is shown graphically by the time profiles of the methyl mercaptan level for the following two cases: one where the aluminum foil honeycomb-supported Catalyst E of Example 6 (500 cells/in2; 35.5 mm x 69 mm x 10 mm) was installed in a vertical direction along a plane 5 mm distant from the farthest wall of the refrigerating compartment (see Figure 13a); and the other where the same catalyst was installed in position A on the farthest wall of the refrigerating compartment in such a way that it protruded horizontally from the wall inside the refrigerating compartment (see Figure 13b).<br>
As is clear from Figure 12, the efficiency of the deodorizing catalyst could be improved by projecting it horizontally from the furthest wall of the refrigerating compartment so as to accomplish more efficient contact with the internal air. This provides a proof of the fact that the efficiency of a deodorizing catalyst can be improved by installing it in a position where it traverses the natural convection of air within the refrigerating compartment (i.e., it projects horizontally inside the refrigerating compartment as shown in Figure 13b).<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The present invention provides a novel deodorizing filter which, in the face of environmental changes, is less likely to give off unpleasant odors due to the malodor components that are adsorbed on or stored in the filter per se and which yet has comparable deodorizing performance to the existing deodorizing filters.<br>
If an aluminum supported catalyst is dipped in a weak alkaline aqueous solution, an aluminum component such as aluminum hydroxide leaching out of the aluminum carrier is<br><br>
incorporated and precipitated into the interstices in the catalyst layer which hence form a unitary body integrated with the aluminum carrier and the catalyst layer. The strength of support of the catalyst layer against the aluminum carrier is accordingly enhanced to provide an improved aluminum-supported catalyst in which the catalyst layer supported thereon will not readily separate from the aluminum carrier.<br>
The efficiency of the deodorizing catalyst can be enhanced by fitting it in a direct-cool refrigerator in areas near the chilling section that serves as the driving force for creating natural convection of the air within the refrigerating compartment.<br><br><br><br><br>
