Immunogenic composition<br>
	The present invention relates to immunogenic compositions comprising a dried solid<br>
	or high viscosity liquid formulation of inactivated polio virus (IPV) which retains<br>
5	immunogenicity. The invention also includes a vaccine comprising a dried solid or<br>
	high viscosity liquid formulation of IPV. A further aspect of the invention is a<br>
	process for preserving inactivated polio virus (IPV) as a dried solid or high viscosity<br>
	 liquid. This process comprises preparing a sample by suspending or dissolving IPV<br>
	and a bacterial polysaccharide in a solution of a stabilising agent and subjecting the<br>
10	sample to temperature and pressure conditions which result in solvent being lost from<br>
	the sample. Pressure and temperature conditions are maintained or adjusted so that<br>
	solvent is removed and the sample dries to form a solid or high viscosity liquid. Such<br>
	formulations may be reconstituted prior to use or used directly.<br>
15	IPV is well known as a component of vaccines, however, it is formulated as a liquid,<br>
	for example in Infanrix penta ®. The process of freeze-drying IPV has been<br>
	associated with the loss of antigenicity so that it is difficult to formulate an effective<br>
	vaccine comprising a dried form of IPV. Dried vaccine formulations are known,<br>
	particularly in the case of bacterial polysaccharides. The PRP polysaccharide of .<br>
20	Haemophilus influenzae b (Hib) is frequently formulated as a dried solid, for example<br>
	in Infanrix hexa ® (WO99/48525).<br>
	There are several reasons why a dried formulation of IPV would be advantageous.<br>
	Dried formulations have good storage properties and can increase the shelf life of a<br>
25	vaccine containing IPV. The possibility of drying IPV also makes IPV a more flexible<br>
	vaccine constituent and enables it to be formulated in new combination vaccines<br>
	which were not previously possible. Some vaccines contain liquid and dried solid<br>
	components which are mixed just prior to administration (for example Infanrix<br>
	hexa ®). Infanrix Hexa contains a dried Hib component which is reconstituted with<br>
30	DTPa-HepB-IPV just prior to use. By formulating IPV together with Hib as a dried<br>
	solid, it would be possible to add further components to the liquid part of the vaccine,<br>
	which might otherwise be incompatible with IPV.<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/012160<br>
2<br>
	Several techniques for drying vaccine components are known in the art. Traditionally,<br>
	this has been accomplished using the process of freeze drying in which a solution of<br>
	the substance is made and the sample is frozen. During the primary drying phase,<br>
5	 most of the water is removed by sublimation from ice under reduced pressure<br>
	conditions and a porous 'cake' is formed. This is usually followed by a secondary<br>
	drying phase when the pressure and temperature are changed and water is evaporated<br>
	from the solid 'cake'. The resulting lyophilised sample has improved stability<br>
	compared to a liquid formulation. However, the freeze drying process is lengthy and<br>
10	can be the rate limiting step in a production process.<br>
	Product variability is also a problem when many samples are being batch lyophilised<br>
	in a large dryer unit. The conditions on the shelves of the freeze dryer vary between<br>
	different positions leading to samples lyophilising at different rates under different<br>
15	conditions. For certain biological materials such as live virus, there can be significant<br>
	loss of activity during the freeze drying process (Pikal (1994) ACS Symposium 567:<br>
	120-133). Many freeze dried substances are still unstable at ambient temperature<br>
	(Carpenter et al (1994) ACS Symposium 567; 134-147).<br>
20	Damage caused by the process of freezing may be circumvented to some degree by<br>
	the use of cryoprotectants such as polyols. Further improvements on the process of<br>
	lyophilisation have also been made by avoiding freezing the sample during the<br>
	process and removing water by boiling (WO96/40077; US6306345). This method<br>
	involves preparing a mixture of a glass-matrix forming material in a suitable solvent<br>
25	together with the sample to be preserved, evaporating bulk solvent from the mixture<br>
	to obtain a syrup, exposing the syrup to a pressure and temperature sufficient to cause<br>
	boiling of the syrup and removing residual solvent.<br>
	A similar method was described in US5,766,520, in which the process involves<br>
30	partially removing the water to form a viscous fluid and further subjecting the syrup<br>
	to vacuum to cause it to 'boil' and further drying at temperatures substantially lower<br>
	than 100 °C. This method still suffers from some of the problems of conventional<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/012160<br>
3<br>
	freeze-drying. When the process is carried out in a large freeze-dryer, samples will<br>
	dry at different rates depending on their position on the shelf and this leads to<br>
	different samples loosing different amount of activity during the drying process. This<br>
	leads to a lack of consistency within a batch.<br>
5<br>
	To date, no successful example of making a dried solid vaccine formulation of IPV<br>
	that retains a high degree of antigenicity and/or immunogenicity has been reported.<br>
	Accordingly, the present invention discloses an immunogenic composition<br>
10	comprising IPV and a stabilising agent, formulated as a dried composition or highly<br>
	viscous liquid, which after reconstitution is capable of generating an immune response<br>
	against polio virus. The presence of a stabilising agent is crucial to the preservation of<br>
	antigens and polyols are shown to be effective. IPV is preferably dried in the presence<br>
	of a bacterial polysaccharide which leads to retention of a higher percentage of the<br>
15	original antigens in terms of antigenicity and/or immunogenicity. The present<br>
	invention encompasses methods of preserving a composition comprising IPV,<br>
	preferably in the presence of a polyol and a bacterial polysaccharide, wherein the<br>
	antigenicity and/or immunogenicity of IPV is retained. Lyophilisation of IPV in the<br>
	presence of polysaccharides leads to an improvement in antigen retention for IPV<br>
20	compared to lyophilisation of IPV alone. In addition, the immunogenicity of Hib is<br>
	also enhanced by being formulated together with IPV as a dried solid or highly<br>
	viscous liquid. In particular, when reconstituted extemporaneously with liquid DTP<br>
	vaccines (described below), the inventors have found that Hib titres are not as reduced<br>
	by the aluminium hydroxide component of the DTP vaccine as would have been the<br>
25	case without the presence of IPV.<br>
	The method of drying used can also influence the antigenicity and/or immunogenicity<br>
	retention of IPV. A foam drying process for drying IPV was more effective at<br>
	retaining antigenicity of IPV than conventional freeze drying techniques.<br>
30	Surprisingly, the inclusion of a freezing step in the foam drying process did not lead<br>
	to loss of antigenicity but rather led to the development of a quick and effective<br>
	preservation process. A further preferred method of the invention retains high levels<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/012160<br>
4<br>
	of IPV antigenicity and/or immunogenicity by drying the sample containing IPV<br>
	without freezing or foam formation, resulting in the formation of a dried formulation,<br>
	preferably a highly viscous liquid formulation.<br>
5	The invention provides a dried formulation of IPV which will have benefits of storage<br>
	stability. The dried formulation can be reconstituted quickly and easily just prior to<br>
	administration. Where the preferred foam drying process is used, the foamed cake is<br>
	particularly easily reconstituted due to the greater surface area of the cake.<br>
10	Additional benefits of a dried solid or highly viscous liquid formulation of IPV and<br>
	Hib include enhanced immunogenicity of the Hib component. It is well known that in<br>
	multi-component vaccines, other parts of the vaccine formulation can lead to<br>
	interference with Hib immunogenicity (WO96/40242, WO97/00697). The inclusion<br>
	of IPV in a dried formulation with Hib can reduce this problem, especially if the dried<br>
15	IPV-Hib composition is mixed with diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis components<br>
	prior to administration.<br>
	Although lyophilisation of IPV in the presence of a bacterial polysaccharide is<br>
	possible using a conventional freeze drying approach, it is preferred to use a foam<br>
20	drying technique or a gentle drying process which does not involve freezing or foam<br>
	formation. These processes result in even greater antigenicity and/or immunogenicity<br>
	retention in IPV and the resultant cake is also easier and quicker to reconstitute. The<br>
	processes also have advantages in being quicker and more energy efficient than<br>
	standard freeze-drying techniques. Since the lyophilisation step is often the rate<br>
25	limiting step in vaccine production, the use of the preferred processes would result in<br>
	higher levels of vaccine production without additional investment in plant. The<br>
	introduction of a freezing step into the preferred foam drying process also leads to<br>
	improved batch reproducibility.<br>

	polysaccharides of Group B streptocoocus. A further preferred embodiment contains<br>
	the capsular polysaccharides of Group A streptococcus, preferably further comprising<br>
	at least one M protein and more preferably multiple types of M protein.<br>
5	In one embodiment of the invention, the bacterial polysaccharides are full length,<br>
	being purified native polysaccharides. In an alternative embodiment of the invention,<br>
	the polysaccharides are sized between 2 and 20 times, preferably 2-5 times, 5-10<br>
	times, 10-15 times or 15-20 times, so that the polysaccharides are smaller in size for<br>
	greater manageability. Oligosaccharides are used in a preferred embodiment.<br>
10	Oligosaccharides typically contain between 2 and 20 repeat units.<br>
	The invention further includes immunogenic compositions comprising more than one<br>
	bacterial polysaccharide and IPV as a dried solid or highly viscous liquid. Preferably,<br>
	IPV is combined with one or more of Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b) PRP<br>
15	polysaccharide and/or meningococcal A, C, W and/or Y polysaccharides and/or<br>
	pneumococcal polysaccharides. Most preferably the active agents comprise, IPV and<br>
	Hib; IPV and MenC; IPV and Hib and MenC; IPV and MenA and C; IPV and Hib<br>
	and Men A and C; IPV and Hib and Men A and C and Y; or IPV and Hib and Men C<br>

20<br>
	The above particularised active agents may also comprise one or more pneumococcal<br>
	capsular polysaccharides as described below.<br>
	In the above compositions where polysaccharides are used, oligosaccharides may also<br>
25	be employed (as defined above).<br>
	Although these compositions may be adjuvanted (as described below), they are<br>

	carrier protein comprising T-helper epitopes (as described below).<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/012160<br>
9<br>
	Capsular polysaccharides present in immunogenic compositions of the invention are<br>
	unconjugated or conjugated to a carrier protein such as tetanus toxoid, tetanus toxoid<br>
	fragment C, diphtheria toxoid, CRM197, pneumolysin, Protein D (US6342224).<br>
	Tetanus toxin, diphtheria toxin and pneumolysin are detoxified either by genetic<br>
5	 mutation and/or preferably by chemical treatment. A preferred embodiment of the<br>
	invention has Hib conjugated to tetanus toxoid.<br>
	Where more than one conjugated polysaccharide is present in the immunogenic<br>
	composition of the invention, the polysaccharides are conjugated to the same carrier<br>
10	protein or to different carrier proteins. Preferred embodiments of the invention contain<br>
	meningococcal polysaccharides conjugated to a carrier protein. Where conjugated<br>
	Hib and meningococcal polysaccharides are present, they are conjugated to the same<br>
	carrier protein or to different carrier proteins.<br>
15 	The polysaccharide conjugate may be prepared by any known coupling technique. In<br>
	a preferred coupling technique, the polysaccharide is coupled via a thioether linkage.<br>
	This conjugation method relies on activation of the polysaccharide with l-cyano-4-<br>
	dimethylamino pyridinium tetrafluoroborate (CDAP) to form a cyanate ester. The<br>
	activated polysaccharide may thus be coupled directly or via a spacer group to an<br>
20	amino group on the carrier protein. Preferably, the cyanate ester is coupled with<br>
	hexane diamine and the amino-derivatised polysaccharide is conjugated to the carrier<br>
	protein using heteroligation chemistry involving the formation of the thioether<br>
	linkage. Such conjugates are described in PCT published application WO93/15760<br>
	Uniformed Services University.<br>
25<br>
	The conjugates can also be prepared by direct reductive amination methods as<br>
	described in US 4365170 (Jennings) and US 4673574 (Anderson). Other methods are<br>
	described in EP-O-161-188, EP-208375 and EP-0-477508.<br>
30 	A further method involves the coupling of a cyanogen bromide activated<br>
	polysaccharide derivatised with adipic acid hydrazide (ADH) to the protein carrier by<br>
	Carbodiimide condensation (Chu C. et al Infect. Immunity, 1983 245 256).<br><br>

	The immunogenic composition is preferably formulated with antigens providing<br>
	protection against one or more of Diphtheria, tetanus and Bordetella pertussis<br>
	infections. The pertussis component may be killed whole cell B. pertussis (Pw) or is<br>
	preferably acellular pertussis (Pa) which contains at least one antigen (preferably two<br>
25	or all three) from PT, FHA and 69kDa pertactin certain other acellular vaccines also<br>
	contain agglutinogens , such as Fim 2 and Fim 3 and these vaccines are also<br>
	contemplated for use in the invention. Typically, the antigens providing protection<br>
	against Diphtheria and Tetanus are Diphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid. The toxoids<br>
	are chemically inactivated toxins, for example following treatment with<br>
30	formaldehyde, or toxins inactivated by the introduction of one or more point<br>
	mutations.<br><br>

	Alternatively the immunogenic composition of the invention may be provided as a kit<br>
	with the dried solid, foamed glass or highly viscous liquid in one container and liquid<br>
	DTPa or DTPw in another container. Such kits can for example, comprise a dual<br>
	chamber syringe with the dried and liquid components contained in the same syringe<br>
5	 but in different chambers. The dried component is then reconstituted with the liquid<br>
	vaccine immediately prior to injection as a single vaccine. Thus for example, the dried<br>
	solid, foamed glass or highly viscous liquid of the invention is reconstituted with the<br>
	liquid DTPa or DTPw vaccine (preferably extemporaneously) and administered as a<br>
	single vaccine. The DTPa or DTPw vaccine typically is adjuvanted at least in part<br>
10	with an aluminium salt, such as aluminium phosphate and/or aluminium hydroxide<br>
	(for instance Infanrix ® and Tritanrix ® vaccines of GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals<br>
	s.a.).<br>
	The immunogenic composition is optionally formulated with one or more antigens<br>
15	that can protect a host against non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, RSV and/or one<br>
	or more antigens that can protect a host against influenza virus. Preferred non-<br>
	typeable H. influenzae protein antigens include Fimbrin protein (US 5766608) and<br>
	fusions comprising peptides therefrom (eg LB1 Fusion) (US 5843464 - Ohio State<br>
	Research Foundation), OMP26, P6, protein D, TbpA, TbpB, Hia, Hmwl, Hmw2,<br>
20	Hap, and Dl5.<br>
	Preferred influenza virus antigens include whole, live or inactivated virus, split<br>
	influenza virus, grown in eggs or MDCK cells, or Vero cells or whole flu virosomes<br>
	(as described by R. Gluck, Vaccine, 1992, 10, 915-920) or purified or recombinant<br>
25	proteins thereof, such as HA, NP, NA, or M proteins, or combinations thereof.<br>
	Preferred RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) antigens include the F glycoprotein, the<br>
	G glycoprotein, the HN protein, the M protein or derivatives thereof.<br>
30	Combination vaccines comprising DTP-Hib are known in the art. However there are<br>
	problems associated with certain formulations which involve simple mixing of Hib<br>
	with other antigens. Unless carefully formulation, the antibody titres raised against the<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/012160<br>
14<br>
	Hib component can be lower than those elicited by the same dose of Hib inoculated<br>
	separately, due to interference with other components of the vaccine. Although this<br>
	problem is well known in the art and has been addressed in various ways, the<br>
	immunogenic compositions of the invention in which Hib and IPV are formulated<br>
5	 together as a dried solid or highly viscous liquid provides an alternative solution to<br>
	this problem.<br>
	The immunogenic compositions of the invention may form part of a vaccine kit in<br>
	which IPV and Hib are present in one component of the kit and further components,<br>
10	as described above, are present in a second component, for example, a dual chamber<br>
	syringe as described herein. The two components are mixed together just before<br>
	administration of the vaccine. In such formulations, the component comprising IPV<br>
	and Hib is preferably a dried solid, foamed glass or highly viscous liquid, although it<br>
	is optionally formulated as a liquid. This formulation results in antibody titres against<br>
15	the Hib component being clinically acceptable to provide protection against the<br>
	Haemophilus influenzae b pathogen. Typically, the antibody titre in the combination<br>
	vaccine are at least 85%, 90%, preferably about 100% or more of those elicited by the<br>
	same dose of Hib in a monovalent Hib vaccine.<br>
20	Vaccines of the invention<br>
	The immunogenic compositions of the invention described above are preferably<br>
	formulated as a vaccine. Preferably, the vaccine contains an amount of an adjuvant<br>
	sufficient to enhance the immune response to the immunogen. Suitable adjuvants<br>
25	include, but are not limited to, aluminium salts such as aluminium hydroxide and<br>
	aluminium phosphate, squalene mixtures (SAF-1), muramyl peptide, saponin<br>
	derivatives, mycobacterium cell wall preparations, monophosphoryl lipid A, mycolic<br>
	acid derivatives, non-ionic block copolymer surfactants, Quil A, cholera toxin B<br>
	subunit, polphosphazene and derivatives, and immunostimulating complexes<br>
30	(ISCOMs) such as those described by Takahashi et al. (1990) Nature 344:873-875.<br>
	For veterinary use and for production of antibodies in animals, mitogenic components<br>
	of Freund's adjuvant can be used.<br><br>
WO 2WM/039399	PCT/EP2003/012160<br>
15<br>
	The vaccine formulations of the invention are preferably reconstituted prior to use.<br>
	Reconstitution involves the mixing of a liquid component of the vaccine with the<br>
	dried solid, foamed glass or highly viscous liquid formulation of the invention. The<br>
5	 invention also encompasses a container with a water repellent internal surface<br>
	containing the immunogenic composition or vaccine of the invention. The use of such<br>
	a container is advantageous because it leads to the dried composition sitting at the<br>
	bottom of the tube in a form in which it is more easy to reconstitute.<br>
10	It is advantageous to incorporate a coloured dye into the preservation sample in order<br>
	to allow easier visualisation of the dried composition of the invention. This is<br>
	particularly important during reconstitution to ensure that the dried solid or highly<br>
	viscous liquid is thoroughly reconstituted prior to use. Preferably, the coloured dye<br>
	maintains its colour at a neutral pH and is compatible with injection into a patient.<br>
15	Most preferably the coloured dye is phenol red.<br>
	As with all immunogenic compositions or vaccines, the immunologically effective<br>
	amounts of the immunogens must be determined empirically. Factors to be<br>
	considered include the immunogenicity, whether or not the immunogen will be<br>
20	completed with or covalently attached to an adjuvant or carrier protein or other<br>
	carrier, route of adminstrations and the number of immunising dosages to be<br>
	adminstered. Such factors are known in the vaccine art and it is well within the skill<br>
	of immunologists to make such determinations without undue experimentation.<br>
25	The substance can be present in varying concentrations in the immunogenic<br>
	composition of the invention. Typically, the minimum concentration of the substance<br>
	is an amount necessary to achieve its intended use, while the maximum concentration<br>
	is the maximum amount that will remain in solution or homogeneously suspended<br>
	within the initial mixture. For instance, the minimum amount of a therapeutic agent is<br>
30	preferably one which will provide a single therapeutically effective dosage. Super-<br>
	saturated solutions can also be used if a foamed glass is formed prior to<br>
	crystallisation. For bioactive substances, the minimum concentration is an amount<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/012160<br>
16<br>
	necessary for bioactivity upon reconstitution and the maximum concentration is at the<br>
	point at which a homogeneous suspension cannot be maintained. In the case of<br>
	single-dosed units, the amount is that of a single therapeutic application Generally, it<br>
	is expected that each dose will comprise 1-100ug of protein antigen, preferably 5-<br>
5	50ug and most preferably 5-25ug. Preferred doses of bacterial polysaccharides are 10-<br>
	20ug, 10-5ug, 5-2.5ug or 2.5-lug. The preferred amount of the substance varies from<br>
	substance to substance but is easily determinable by one of skill in the art.<br>
	Methods of the invention<br>
10<br>
	The methods of the invention are for preserving a composition comprising IPV and a<br>
	stabilising agent, resulting in a composition in which the antigenicity of IPV is<br>
	retained. Preferably, a bacterial polysaccharide is incorporated in the sample to be<br>
	dried.<br>
15<br>
	In one embodiment, the method of the invention involves drying IPV and comprises<br>
	the steps of:<br>
	• preparing a preservation sample by suspending or dissolving IPV in a solution of a<br>
	stabilising agent; preferably a bacterial polysaccharide and/or a glass forming<br>
20	polyol are present in the preservation sample;<br>
	• subjecting the preservation sample to such temperature and pressure conditions<br>
	that solvent is lost from the preservation sample; and<br>
	• removing solvent until the preservation sample dries to form a solid or highly<br>
	viscous liquid in which the antigenicity and/or immunogenicity of IPV is retained.<br>
25	In a preferred embodiment, the preservation sample is inserted into a container with a<br>
	water repellent interior prior to drying.<br>
A further method of the invention involves foam drying, comprising the steps of:<br>
	• preparing a preservation sample by suspending or dissolving IPV in a solution of a<br>
30	stabilising agent; preferably a bacterial polysaccharide and/or a glass forming<br>
	polyol are present in the preservation sample;<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/012160<br>
17<br>
	• subjecting the preservation sample to such temperature and pressure conditions<br>
	that the preservation sample forms a foam; and<br>
	• removing solvent until the foam dries to form a solid in which the antigenicity<br>
	and/or immunogenicity of IP V is retained.<br>
5<br>
	A preferred foam drying method of the invention uses a container with a water'<br>
	repellent interior surface and contains the steps of:<br>
	• preparing a preservation sample by suspending or dissolving IPV and preferably a<br>
	bacterial polysaccharide in a solution of a stabilising agent;<br>
10 	• inserting the preservation sample into a container with a water repellent interior<br>
	surface;<br>
	• subjecting the container containing the preservation sample to such temperature<br>
	and pressure conditions so that the preservation sample forms a foam;<br>
	• removing solvent until the foam dries to form a solid in which the antigenicity<br>
15	and/or immunogenicity of IPV is retained.<br>
	The foam drying methods of the invention described above optionally comprise a<br>
	freezing step. The preservation sample may be wholly or partially frozen. Therefore<br>
	some methods of the invention comprise the steps of:<br>
20	• preparing an at least partially frozen preservation sample by suspending or<br>
	dissolving IPV and preferably a bacterial polysaccharide in a solution of a<br>
	stabilising agent and freezing the mixture;<br>
	• subjecting the at least partially frozen preservation sample to such temperature<br>
	and pressure conditions that the preservation sample forms a foam; and<br>
25	• removing solvent until the foam dries to form a solid in which the antigenicity<br>
	and/or immunogenicity of IPV is retained.<br>
	The freezing step of the above method is preferably by the process of quench freezing<br>
	in which reduction of pressure is the cause of freezing by evaporation. This causes<br>
30	rapid freezing of the sample which leads to less antigen loss. Therefore a process of<br>
	the invention includes the steps of<br><br>
WO 2004/039399	PCT/EP2OO3/O12160<br>
18<br>
	• preparing a preservation sample by suspending or dissolving IPV and preferably a<br>
	bacterial polysaccharide in a solution of a stabilising agent;<br>
	• subjecting the preservation sample to reduced pressure such that the preservation<br>
	sample becomes at least partially frozen;<br>
5	 • subjecting the at least partially frozen preservation sample to such temperature<br>
	and pressure conditions that the preservation sample forms a foam; and <br>
	• removing solvent until the foam dries to form a solid in which the antigenicity<br>
	and/or immunogenicity of IPV is retained.<br>
10	A further preferred method of the invention is used for preserving IPV and comprises<br>
	the steps of:<br>
	• preparing a preservation sample by suspending or dissolving IPV in a solution of a<br>
	stabilising agent;<br>
	• subjecting the preservation sample to such temperature and pressure conditions<br>
15	that the preservation sample looses solvent by evaporation, without bubbling to<br>
	form a foam and preferably without freezing;<br>
	• removing solvent until the sample dries to form a highly viscous liquid in which<br>
	and antigencity and/or immunogenicity of IPV is retained.<br>
20	The methods of the invention produce a formulation of IPV that is able to withstand<br>
	extended storage during which the antigenicity and/or immunogenicity of IPV is<br>
	maintained. Preferably the IPV retains at least 40, 50, 60, 70, preferably 80,90, 95%<br>
	of its original antigenicity and/or immunogenicity over a period of at least 3,6,9,12,<br>
	24 months storage at 4 °C. Antigenicity and immunogenicity are measured after<br>
25	reconstitution of IPV in a suitable aqueous solution, and using a suitable method, for<br>
	instance those described above.<br>
	The method of drying without freezing or foam formation is particularly applicable<br>
	for use where the active agents to be dried are prone to loss of activity and/or<br>
30	antigenicity during the drying process due to exposure to freezing or the bubbling<br>
	associated with foam formation. It is also particularly applicable for use where a<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/012160<br>
19<br>
	lower concentration of the glass forming polyol is advantageous and/or where a<br>
	shorter drying process is preferred.<br>
	Stabilising agent<br>
5<br>
	The stabilising agent to be used in the methods of the invention will preferably.<br>
	comprise glass forming polyols. Suitable materials include, but are not limited to, all<br>
	polyols, including carbohydrate and non-carbohydrate polyols. Preferably the<br>
	stabilising polyol enables the active agent to be stored without substantial loss of<br>
10	activity by denaturation, aggregation or other means. Particularly suitable materials<br>
	include sugars, sugar alcohols and carbohydrate derivatives. Preferably, the glass<br>
	forming polyol is a carbohydrate or derivatives thereof, including glucose, maltulose,<br>
	iso-maltulose, lactulose, sucrose, maltose, lactose, iso-maltose, maltitol, lactitol,<br>
	palatinit, trehalose, raffinose, stachyose, melezitose or dextran, most preferably<br>
15	trehalose, sucrose, sorbitol, raffinose, mannitol, lactose, lactitol or palatinit.<br>
	Bacterial polysaccharides act as a stabilising agent and preferred embodiments of the<br>
	invention incorporate bacterial polysaccharides as a constitutent of the stabilising<br>
	agent. The bacterial polysaccharide plays a dual role of stabilising agent and<br>
20	immunogen in this embodiment.<br>
	Carbohydrates include, but are not limited to, monosaccharides, disaccharides,<br>
	trisaccharides, oligosaccharides and their corresponding sugar alcohols, polyhydroxyl<br>
	compounds such as carbohydrate derivatives and chemically modified carbohydrates,<br>
25	hydroxyethyl starch and sugar copolymers. Both natural and synthetic carbohydrates<br>
	are suitable for use. Synthetic carbohydrates include, but are not limited to, those<br>
	which have the glycosidic bond replaced by a thiol or carbon bond. Both D and L<br>
	forms of the carbohydrates may be used. The carbohydrate may be non-reducing or<br>
	reducing. Where a reducing carbohydrate is used, the addition of inhibitors of the<br>
30	Maillard reaction is preferred.<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP20O3/O12160<br>
20<br>
	Reducing caibohydrates suitable for use in the invention are those known in the art<br>
	and include, but are not limited to, glucose, maltose, lactose, fructose, galactoase,<br>
	mannose, maltulose and lactulose. Non-reducing carbohydrates include, but are not<br>
	limited to, non-reducing glycosides of polyhydroxyl compounds selected from sugar<br>
5	 alcohols and other straight chain polyalcohols. Other useful carbohydrates include<br>
	raffinose, stachyose, melezitose, dextran, sucrose, cellibiose, mannobiose and sugar<br>
	alcohols. The sugar alcohol glycosides are preferably monoglycosides, in particular<br>
	the compounds obtained by reduction of disaccharides such as lactose, maltose,<br>
	lactulose and maltulose.<br>
10<br>
	Particularly preferred carbohydrates are trehalose, sucrose, sorbitol, maltitol, lactitol,<br>
	palatinit and glucopyranosyl-1 →6-mannitol.<br>
	Amino acids can act as stabilising agents and can be used by themselves and<br>
15	preferably in combination with a polyol. Preferred amino acids include glycine,<br>
	alanine, arginine, lysine and glutamine although any amino acid, or a combination of<br>
	amino acids, peptide, hydrolysed proteins or protein such as serum albumin can act as<br>
	a stabilising agent.<br>
20	 Preferably, the preservation sample will contain a component capable of inhibiting<br>
	crystal formation in the dried solid or highly viscous liquid of the invention. Salts and<br>
	other molecules including amino acids and phenol red inhibit crystal formation.<br>
	The concentration of the stabilising agent used in the process of the invention may be<br>
25	between 1% and 50% weight/volume, preferably 1-5%, 5-10%, 5-10%, 15-20%, 20-<br>
	25% or 25-50%, most preferably less than 25% (w/v). The amounts of stabilising<br>
	agent required is proportional to the amount of salts present. Therefore, although<br>
	levels of stabilising agent between 3% and 10% are preferred, higher concentrations<br>
	of 10% to 25% (w/v) may be required to dry samples with a high salt content.<br>

	Container<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/012160<br>
21<br>
	Different mixtures and various container shapes and sizes can be processed<br>
	simultaneously. Ideally, the container size used is sufficient to contain the initial<br>
	mixture and accommodate the volume of the dried formulation formed thereof.<br>
	Typically, this is determined by the mass of the glass forming material, the surface<br>
5	 area of the container and the temperature and pressure conditions, which determine<br>
	whether foaming occurs. The mass of glass forming material must be sufficient to<br>
	give viscous syrup, optionally to be foamed which translates practically as a minimal<br>
	mass per unit area of container surface. This ratio varies from mixture to mixture and<br>
	container used, but is easily determined empirically by one skilled in the art by<br>
10	following the procedures set forth herein. Any such containers can be used including<br>
	Wheaton moulded and tube-cut vials.<br>
	The processes of the invention preferably use containers with a water repellent<br>
	interior surface. This is achieved through coating the interior surface with a<br>
15	hydrophobic composition, for instance by siliconisation. Siliconisation is achieved by<br>
	processes that are well known to those skilled in the art. In one method, the container<br>
	is siliconised by rising the interior of the container with an emulsion of silicone,<br>
	followed by processing through an oven at high temperature, typically 350 °C.<br>
	Alternatively, the water repellent interior surface is achieved by the container being<br>
20	made of a water repellent composition.<br>
	The water repellent interior surface of the container makes foam formation more<br>
	likely to occur and more reproducible. This allows lower polyol concentrations to be<br>
	used in the preservation sample which in turn decreases the length of time necessary<br>
25 	to dry the sample, reduces the effect of Maillard reactions or other interactions with<br>
	the polyol harming the active agent. Where the preservation samples comprises a<br>
	vaccine, the resultant foamed glass is reconstituted quickly and easily due to the lower<br>
	amount of polyol present and the resultant vaccine solution is less viscous, allowing<br>
	easier administration. The water repellent interior surface allows easier reconstitution<br>
30	of the dried solid or highly viscous liquid since it encourages the sample to remain as<br>
	at the bottom of the container so that it is easier to reconstitute effectively.<br><br>

	Although singular forms may be used herein, more than one stabilising agent, more<br>
	than one additive, and more than one substance may be present. Effective amounts of<br>
	these components are easily determined by one skilled in the art.<br>
5 	Solvent<br>
	The preservation sample is made by dissolving/suspending IPV and a stabilising agent<br>
	 in water to make an aqueous solution. Preferably, water is present in the preservation<br>
	sample at a level of 5 to 98% by volume, more preferably 80-98% by volume, most<br>
10	preferably 85-98% by volume.<br>
	The volume of solvent can vary and will depend upon the stabilising agent and the<br>
	substance to be incorporated as well as any additives. The minimum volume<br>
	required is an amount necessary to solubilise the various components. However,<br>
15	homogeneously dispersed suspensions of the substance(s) can also be used. Suitable<br>
	amounts of the components in specific embodiments are easily determinable by those<br>
	skilled in the art in light of the examples provided herein.<br>
	Various additives can be put into the preservation sample. Typically, the additives<br>
20	enhance foam formation and /or the drying process and/or contribute to the<br>
	solubilization of the substance. Alternatively, the additives contribute to the stability<br>
	of the substance incorporated within the solid. One or more additives may be present.<br>
	As an example, addition of volatile/effervescent salts allows larger initial volumes and<br>
25	results in higher surface area within the foamed glass, thus effecting superior foam<br>
	formation and more rapid drying. As used herein, volatile salts are salts which<br>
	volatilise under the conditions used to produce a foamed glass. Examples of suitable<br>
	volatile salts include, but are not limited to, ammonium acetate, ammonium<br>
	bicarbonate and ammonium carbonate. Salts that decompose to give gaseous products<br>
30	also effect enhanced foam formation and more rapid drying. Examples of such salts<br>
	are sodium bicarbonate and sodium metabisulpbite. Preferably, the volatile salts are<br>
	present in an amount of from about 0.01 to 5 M. Concentrations of up to 5 M are<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/012160<br>
23<br>
	suitable for use herein. The resultant foamed glass has uniform foam conformation<br>
	and is significantly drier compared to foamed glass in which volatile/effervescent<br>
	salts are not used.<br>
5	 Another suitable additive is a foam stabilising agent, which can be used in<br>
	combination with either the volatile or decomposing salt. This may either be a<br>
	surface active component such as an amphipathic molecule (i.e. such as phospholipids<br>
	and surfactants) or an agent to increase the viscosity of the foaming syrup, such as a<br>
	thickening agent such as guar gum and their derivatives.<br>
10<br>
	Another additive is an inhibitor of the Maillard reaction. Preferably, if the substance<br>
	and/or glass matrix-forming material contains carbonyl and amino, imino or<br>
	guanidino groups, the compositions further contain at least one physiologically<br>
	acceptable inhibitor of the Maillard reaction in an amount effective to substantially<br>
15	prevent condensation of ammo groups and reactive carbonyl groups in the<br>
	composition. The inhibitor of the Maillard reaction can be any known in the art. The<br>
	inhibitor is present in an amount sufficient to prevent, or substantially prevent,<br>
	condensation of amino groups and reactive carbonyl groups. Typically, the amino<br>
	groups are present on the substance and the carbonyl groups are present on the glass<br>
20	matrix forming material, or the converse. However, the amino acids and carbonyl<br>
	groups may be intramolecular within either the substance or the carbohydrate.<br>
	Various classes of compounds are known to exhibit an inhibiting effect on the<br>
	Maillard reaction and hence to be of use in the compositions described herein. These<br>
25	compounds are generally either competitive or non-competitive inhibitors of the<br>
	Maillard reaction. Competitive inhibitors include, but are not limited to, amino acid<br>
	residues (both D and L), combinations of amino acid residues and peptides.<br>
	Particularly preferred are lysine, arginine, histidine and tryptophan. Lysine and<br>
	aarginine are the most effective. There are many known non-competitive inhibitors.<br>
30	These include, but are not limited to, aminoguaniduie and derivatives and<br>
	amphotericin B. EP-A-0 433 679 also describes suitable Maillard inhibitors which<br>
	include 4-hydroxy-5, 8-dioxoquinoline derivatives.<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/012160<br>
24<br>
	Active agents<br>
	The methods of the invention are used to preserve inactivated polio virus (IPV -<br>
	preferably comprising types 1,2 and 3 as is standard in the vaccine art, most<br>
5	 preferably the Salk polio vaccine). IPV contains 20-80, preferably 40 or 8- D-antigen<br>
	units of type 1 (Mahoney), 4-20, preferably 8 or 16 D-antigen units of type 2 (MEF-1)<br>
	and 20-64, preferably 32 or 64 D-antigen units of type 3 (Saukett). The IPV vaccine<br>
	 formulation is suitable for injection after reconstitution in an aqueous solution which<br>
	preferably contains additional vaccine components.<br>
10<br>
	The bacterial polysaccharide incorporated by the process of the invention are for<br>
	example capsular polysaccharides derived from one or more of Neisseria<br>
	meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Group A<br>
	Streptococci, Group B Streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus<br>
15	epidermidis, preferably the PRP capsular polysaccharides of Haemophilus influenzae..<br>
	Preferred capsular polysaccharides also include those derived from one or more of<br>
	serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y of Neisseria meningitidis. Further preferred capsular<br>
	polysaccharides are derived from Streptococcus pneumoniae. The pneumococcal<br>
	capsular polysaccharide antigens are preferably selected from serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,<br>
20	6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11 A, 12F, 14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19A, 19F, 20, 22F, 23F and<br>
	33F (most preferably from serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F). A<br>
	further preferred embodiment contains the Type 5, Type 8 or 336 capsular<br>
	polysaccharides of Staphylococcus aureus. Further preferred polysaccharides include<br>
	the Type I, Type II or Type III capsular polysaccharides of Staphylococcus<br>
25	epidermidis, the Type Ia, Type Ic, Type II or Type III capsular polysaccharides of<br>
	Group B streptocoocus. Further preferred polysaccharides include the capsular<br>
	polysaccharides of Group A streptococcus, preferably further comprising at least one<br>
	M protein and more preferably multiple types of M protein.<br>
30	Preferred combinations of active agents to be preserved using the processes of the<br>
	invention comprise IPV. Preferably, IPV is combined with bacterial polysaccharides<br>
	comprising one or more of Hib PRP polysaccharide and/or meningococcal A, C, W<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/012160<br>
25<br>
	and/or Y polysaccharides and/or pneumococcal polysaccharides. Preferred<br>
	combinations include IPV and Hib; IPV and MenC; IPV and MenA and C; IPV and<br>
	Hib and Men C or IPV, Hib, Men A and C. Each bacterial polysaccharides may be<br>
	present in doses of l-5ug, 5-10 μg, 10-20μg or 20-40μg.<br>
5	<br>
	Bacterial polysaccharides are unconjugated or conjugated to a carrier protein such as<br>
	tetanus toxoid, tetanus toxoid fragment C, diphtheria toxoid, CRM197, pneumolysin<br>
	or Protein D (US6342224).<br>
10 	The polysaccharide conjugate are prepared by any known coupling technique. A<br>
	preferred conjugation method relies on activation of the polysaccharide with 1 -cyano-<br>
	4-dimethylamino pyridinium tetrafluoroborate (CDAP) to form a cyanate ester. The<br>
	activated polysaccharide is coupled directly or via a spacer group to an amino group<br>
	on the carrier protein. Preferably, the cyanate ester is coupled with hexane diamine<br>
15	and the amino-derivatised polysaccharide is conjugated to the carrier protein using<br>
	heteroligation chemistry involving the formation of the thioether linkage. Such<br>
	conjugates are described in PCT published application WO93/15760 Uniformed<br>
	Services University.<br>
20 	The conjugates are optionally prepared by direct reductive amination methods as<br>
	described in US 4365170 (Jennings) and US 4673574 (Anderson). Other methods are<br>
	described in EP-0-161-188, EP-208375 and EP-0-477508.<br>
	A further method involves the coupling of a cyanogen bromide activated<br>
25	polysaccharide derivatised with adipic acid hydrazide (ADH) to the protein carrier by<br>
	Carbodiimide condensation (Chu C. et al Infect. Immunity, 1983 245 256).<br>
	Drying Processes<br>
	In one embodiment the process of the invention involves drying IPV in the presence<br>
30	of a stabilising agent, preferably in the presence of a bacterial polysaccharide. In this<br>
	process, the preservation sample is subjected to reduced temperature and pressure<br>
	conditions. The temperature is reduced to less than 20 °C or 0 °C, preferably less than<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/0I2160<br>
26<br>
	-10 °C or -20 °C, more preferably -40 °C or -60 °C. The pressure is reduced to less<br>
	than lmbar, preferably a pressure of, or less than 0.5,0.1, more preferably 0.05 or<br>
	0.01 mbar. The reduced temperature and pressure conditions are maintained for at<br>
	least 10,12,16,20, preferably 24,36, more preferably 48 or 72 hours. Solvent is<br>
5	 removed until the preservation sample dries to form a solid.<br>
	Throughout this application, solid includes glasses, rubbers and crystals which form<br>
	 as the sample dries. Such solids preferably retain a water content of 10-20% or 5-<br>
	10%, preferably 5-6%, 4-5%, or 3-4% , or 2-3%, more preferably 1-2% or 0-1%<br>
10	(w/w).<br>
	Foam drying<br>
	A preferred process of the invention involves subjecting the preservation sample to<br>
15	such pressure and temperature conditions so that the sample begins to bubble, forming<br>
	a foam.<br>
	The temperature within the preservation sample will be different from that external to<br>
	the sample due to the endothermic nature of the evaporation process. References to<br>
20	temperature are to the conditions external to the preservation sample, for instance,<br>
	where a large industrial freeze dryer is used, to the temperature of the shelf. This<br>
	usually corresponds to the freeze dryer temperature setting.<br>
	A preferred embodiment of the invention achieves this by reducing the pressure while<br>
25	maintaining temperature conditions. The pressure is adjusted to at or below 8 ,7, 6,<br>
	preferably 5,4,3, more preferably 2,1.5,1, most preferably 0.8 or 0.5 mbar, while<br>
	maintaining the temperature setting at a temperature above 0 °C, preferably of<br>
	between 10 °C to 15 °C; 15 °C to 20 °C; 20 °C to 25 °C; 25 °C to 30 °C; or 30 °C to<br>
	37 °C. These conditions are maintained for at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8,10, 12,16 or 24<br>
30	hours.<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/012160<br>
27<br>
	Another embodiment of the invention achieves foam formation by changing the<br>
	temperature while maintaining reduced the pressure conditions. The temperature<br>
	setting is increased to above 20 °C, preferably to between 20 °C and 30 °C; 30 °C<br>
	and 40 °C; 40 °C and 50 °C; or 50 °C and 70 °C; or the temperature setting is in the<br>
5	 range of 10-50 °C, preferably 20-40 °C, more preferably 25-35 °C. Pressure<br>
	conditions are maintained at a reduced level of or below 8,7,6, preferably 5,4,3,<br>
	more preferably 2,1.5,1, most preferably 0.8 or 0.5 mbar. These conditions are<br>
	maintained for at least 1,2, 3,4, 5, 8,10,12,16 or 24 hours.<br>
10 	Removing solvent to form a foamed glass<br>
A subsequent stage of the foam drying method of the invention involves removing<br>
	solvent until the foam dries to form a solid. In one embodiment of the invention, this<br>
	is achieved by maintaining the pressure and temperature conditions at those applied<br>
15	in order to achieve foam formation. For instance, the pressure is maintained at or<br>
	below 8 ,7, 6, preferably 5,4,3, more preferably 2,1.5,1, most preferably 0.8 or 0.5<br>
	mbar while maintaining the temperature setting at a temperature above 0 °C,<br>
	preferably between 2 °C and 10 °C ,10 °C and 20 °C; 20 °C and 30 °C; 30 °C and<br>
	35°C, 35 °C and 40 °C most preferably between 5 °C and 25 °C. These temperature<br>
20	and pressure conditions are maintained for 1,2,3,4, 5,6, 8,10,12,18 hours or more<br>
	in order to obtain a solid with a solvent content less than or equal to 10, 8, 5,4,<br>
	preferably 3, 2 or most preferably 1% (w/w).<br>
	Another embodiment of the invention increases the temperature setting during solvent<br>
25	removal to a higher temperature setting than that maintained earlier in the process.<br>
	This advantageously allows the solvent to leave the sample at a quicker rate so that<br>
	the method of the invention can be completed in a shorter time. For instance, the<br>
	temperature setting is increased to above 0 °C, preferably between 2 °C and 10 °C ;<br>
	10°C and 20 °C; 20 °C and 30 °C; 30 °C and 40 °C; 40 °C and 50 °C; 50 °C and<br>
30	60 °C while maintaining the pressure at or below 8 , 7,6, preferably 5, 4, 3, more<br>
	preferably 2,1.5,1, most preferably 0.8 or 0.5 mbar. These temperature and pressure<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/012160<br>
28<br>
	conditions are maintained for 1,2, 3,4, 5,6, 8,10,12,18 hours or more in order to<br>
	obtain a solid with less than 10, 8,5,4, preferably 3, 2 or most preferably 1% (w/w)<br>
	water content<br>
5 	Another embodiment of the invention reduces the pressure setting during solvent<br>
	removal to a lower pressure setting than that used during foam formation. This<br>
	advantageously allows the solvent to leave the sample at a quicker rate so that the<br>
	method of the invention can be completed in a shorter time. For instance, the pressure<br>
	setting is decreased to at or below 5, ,4,3, preferably 2,1,0.8, more preferably 0.5,<br>
10	0.1. most preferably 0.05 or 0.0lmbar, while maintaining the temperature at or above<br>
	0 °C, preferably between 10 °C and 20 °C; 20 °C and 30 °C; 30 °C and 35 °C or<br>
	above 40 °C. These temperature and pressure conditions are maintained for 1,2,3,4,<br>
	5,6, 8,10,12,18 hours or more in order to obtain a solid with a solvent content less<br>
	than or equal to 5, 4, preferably 3 or 2 or more preferably 1% (w/w).<br>
15<br>
	Foam drying including a freezing step<br>
	The method of the invention optionally involves freezing the sample. Freezing the<br>
	sample prior to foam drying has the advantage of increased reproducibility between<br>
20	samples in a batch. This is due to all the samples starting the process from the same<br>
	physical condition of being frozen. The preservation samples may be wholly or<br>
	partially frozen.<br>
	Freezing is optionally carried out before subjected the sample to reduced pressure by<br>
25	placing the preservation sample at a temperature below 0 °C for a suitable amount of<br>
	time to allow the sample to freeze. Preferably the temperature used is at or below -<br>
	10°C,-15 °C,-20 °C,-30 °C,-40 °C,-70 °C or-140 °C. The sample may be left at a<br>
	temperature below 0 °C for 1,2, 3,4,5, 8, 16 or more hours to allow freezing to<br>
	occur.<br>
30<br>
	For some samples, particularly samples that are easily damaged by solvent crystal<br>
	formation such as cell preparations or other biological systems, it is preferable to<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/O12160<br>
29<br>
	freeze the sample slowly at a rate of less than or equal to 0.1,0.5,1,2, 3,4, 5 °C per<br>
	hour. Other compositions are preserved more effectively by freezing instantaneously,<br>
	for instance by snap freezing in liquid nitrogen. This method is particularly beneficial<br>
	for proteins or viral particles. Freezing by evaporation also results in rapid freezing of<br>
5	 the sample.<br>
Alternatively, the preservation sample is frozen by subjecting the sample to reduced<br>
	pressure such that the sample becomes wholly or partially frozen. Such quench<br>
	freezing is carried out within a bulk freeze dryer apparatus, at a shelf temperature of<br>
10	or above 0 °C, 10 °C, 15 °C, 20 °C, 30 °C, 37 °C. Preferably the shelf temperature is<br>
	between 5 and 35°C, more preferably between 10 and 20 °C, most preferably at<br>
15	°C. The pressure is optionally reduced initially to 200mbar for 5,10,20,30,60<br>
	minutes or more to allow degassing. In order to freeze the sample, the pressure is<br>
	reduced further to a pressure equal to or below 2,1, 0.5, 0.2,0.lmbar. This pressure is<br>
15	maintained for at least 5,10,20 or 30 minutes until the sample is wholly or partially<br>
	frozen.<br>
Subsequent steps of foam formation and removing solvent to form a solid are as<br>
	described above.<br>
20<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the steps of freezing the sample within<br>
	the freeze dryer and foam formation are performed at a constant temperature,<br>
	preferably altering the pressure conditions.<br>
25 In a further preferred embodiment the steps of freezing the sample within the freeze<br>
	dryer, foam formation and solvent removal to form a solid, are performed at a<br>
	constant temperature, preferably altering the pressure conditions.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, both pressure and temperature conditions<br>
30	are different during the steps of freezing the sample, foam formation and solvent<br>
	removal to form a solid.<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/012160<br>
30<br>
	The processes of the invention preferably use containers with a water repellent<br>
	interior surface. This is achieved through coating the interior surface with a<br>
	hydrophobic composition, for instance by siliconisation. Siliconisation is achieved by<br>
	processes that are well known to those skilled in the art. Alternatively, the water<br>
5	 repellent interior surface is achieved by the container being made of a water repellent<br>
	composition<br>
	The presence of a water repellent interior surface of the container makes foam<br>
	formation more likely to occur and more reproducible. This allows lower polyol<br>
10	concentrations to be used in the preservation sample which in turn decreases the<br>
	length of time necessary to dry the sample, reduces the effect of Maillard reactions or<br>
	other harmful interactions between the polyol and the active agent. Where the<br>
	preservation samples comprises a vaccine, the resultant solid is reconstituted quickly<br>
	due to the lower amount of polyol present and the resultant vaccine solution is less<br>
15	viscous, allowing easier administration.<br>
	Drying without freezing or foam formation<br>
	A particularly preferred method of the invention involves drying IPV in the presence<br>
20	of a stabilising agent, and preferably a bacterial polysaccharide, using a gentle process<br>
	that avoids exposure of IPV to freezing or foam formation so that IPV is subjected to<br>
	less stress during the drying process and a high degree of antigenicity is retained.<br>
	This method is particularly applicable for use where a lower concentrationof the glass<br>
25	forming polyol, for example at concentration below 10% (w/v), more preferably<br>
	below 5% (w/v), is advantageous and a shorter drying time is preferred.<br>
	Loss of solvent by evaporation (evaporative drying — step b)<br>
30	The process of drying without freezing or foam formation involves subjecting the<br>
	preservation sample to such pressure and temperature conditions so that the<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/012160<br>
31<br>
	preservation sample looses solvent by evaporation, without the sample freezing or<br>
	bubbling to form a foam.<br>
	The temperature within the preservation sample will, at times, be different from that<br>
5	 external to the sample due to the endothermic nature of the evaporation process.<br>
	References to temperature are to the conditions external to the preservation sample,<br>
	for instance, where a large industrial freeze dryer is used, to the temperature of the<br>
	shelf. This usually corresponds to the freeze dryer temperature setting.<br>
10 	Optionally a preliminary step of degassing the preservation sample is present in the<br>
	method of the invention. The pressure is reduced to at or below 200mBars, preferably<br>
	between 200 and 35mBars, for a period of at least 5 minutes before the pressure is<br>
	reduced further.<br>
15 	A preferred embodiment of the invention achieves evaporative drying by reducing the<br>
	pressure while controlling the temperature conditions. The pressure is adjusted to at or<br>
	below 30, 25,20, preferablyl5,12, most preferably 10,8 ,7,6, 5,4,3,2 or 1 mbar,<br>
	while maintaining the temperature setting at a temperature above 0 °C, preferably of<br>
	between 4 °C to 37 °C , 4 °C to 10 °C , 10 °C to 15 °C; 15 °C to 20 °C; 20 °C to<br>
20	25°C; 25 °C to 30 °C; or 30 °C to 37 °C; or 37 °C to 45 °C. These conditions are<br>
	maintained for at least 1,2, 3,4, 5, 8,10,12,16 or 24 hours, preferably for between<br>
	2-4 hours, 4-6 hours, 6-8 hours, 8-12 hours or 12-18 hours. In a particularly preferred<br>
	embodiment, the pressure is maintained above 2mbars where the temperature setting<br>
	is 15 °C in order to prevent freezing of the sample. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
25	temperature is maintained at 15 °C and the pressure is set to between 5-10 mBars,<br>
	more preferably 6-9mBars, most preferably around 8 mBars. Where a higher<br>
	temperature setting is used, slightly lower pressure is possible without freezing the<br>
	sample and where a lower temperature setting is used, the pressure should be<br>
	maintained at the higher level to prevent freezing. Preferably the conditions are<br>
30	maintained for a sufficient period of time so that the evaporation rate has slowed so<br>
	that the temperature of the sample is approximately the same as that external to the<br>
	sample.<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/012160<br>

	Preferably, the preservation sample should not freeze or boil to form a foam and<br>
	looses solvent to form a viscous liquid or a highly viscous liquid.<br>
5 	Removing solvent to form a highly viscous liquid<br>
A subsequent stage of the method of the invention involves removing solvent until the<br>
	preservation sample dries to form a highly viscous liquid without foam formation and<br>
	preferably without freezing.<br>
10<br>
	In one embodiment of the invention, this is achieved by maintaining the pressure and<br>
	. temperature conditions at those applied in the first evaporative drying stage. For<br>
	instance, the pressure is maintained at or below at or below 30,25,20, preferablylS,<br>
	12, most preferably 10, 8, 7, 6, 5,4, 3,2 or 1 mbar, while maintaining the<br>
15	temperature setting at a temperature above 0 xxxC, preferably of between 5 °C to<br>
	37 °C, 5 °C to 10 °C, 10 °C to 15 °C; 15 °C to 20 °C; 20 °C to 25 °C; 25 °C to<br>
	30°C; or 30 °C to 37 °C. For a temperature setting of 15 °C , a pressure of 5-<br>
	l0mBars, preferably 6-9mBars, most preferably around 8mBars is maintained for<br>
	between 4-24 hours, preferably 1-4,4-8, 8-12 or 12-16 hours. These temperature and<br>
20	pressure conditions are maintained for 1,2, 3,4, 5,6, 8,10,12,18 hours or more in<br>
	order to obtain a highly viscous liquid with a solvent content less than or equal to 15,<br>
	12, preferably 10, 8, 5,4, 3, 2 or 1% (w/w).<br>
	Another embodiment of the invention increases the temperature setting during solvent<br>
25	removal to a higher temperature setting than that maintained earlier in the process.<br>
	This allows the solvent to leave the sample at a quicker rate so that the method of the<br>
	invention can be completed in a shorter time. For instance, the temperature setting is<br>
	increased to above 0 °C, more preferably above 20 °C, preferably between 5 °C and<br>
	37 °C, 5 °C and 10 °C, 10 °C and 20 °C; 20 °C and 30 °C; more preferably 30 °C<br>
30	and 40 °C; more preferably 40 °C and 50 °C; most preferably 50 °C and 60 °C while<br>
	maintaining the pressure at or below 30,25,20, preferably 15,12, most preferably 10,<br>
	8 ,7,6,5,4,3,2 or 1 mbar. These temperature and pressure conditions are<br><br>

33<br>
	with less than or equal to 15,12, preferably 10, 8, 5,4,3,2 or 1%. This embodiment<br>
	requires the active agent to be heat stable at the temperature used for the method to be<br>
	carried out successfully.<br>

	A preferred embodiment of the invention reduces the pressure setting during solvent<br>
	removal (step c) to a lower pressure setting than that used earlier in the process (step<br>
	b). This allows the solvent to leave the sample at a quicker rate so that the method of<br>
	the invention can be completed in a shorter time. It also enables a higher proportion of<br>
10	the solvent to be lost. For instance, the pressure setting is set to at or below 7,6,<br>
	preferably 5,4,3, more preferably 2,1.5,1, most preferably 0.8,0.5,0.2,0.1,0.05 ,<br>
	0.02,0.01, or 0.005mbar, while maintaining the temperature at or above 0 °C,<br>
	preferably between 10 °C and 20 °C; 20 °C and 30 °C; 30 °C and 35 °C or above<br>
	40°C. These temperature and pressure conditions are maintained for 1,2,3,4, 5, 6, 8,<br>
15	10,12 or 18 hours or more in order to obtain a solid with a solvent content less than or<br>
	equal to 15,12, preferably 10, 8,5,4, 3,2 or 1% (w/w) preferably as determined by<br>
	Karl Fischer coulometric moisture analyser (Eur. J. Pharm. Biopharm. (2000) 50;<br>
	277-284).<br>
20	Preferably, steps b) and c) should be completed in a time equal to or less than 18<br>
	hours, more preferably 16,14,12, most preferably 10, 8,6 or 4 hours.<br>
	A dried composition is a composition from which solvent has been removed by<br>
	evaporation, boiling, or sublimation leaving a solvent content less than or equal to 15,<br>
25	12,10, more preferably 8,5,4, 3, 2 or 1% (w/w) , preferably as determined by the<br>
	Karl Fischer method. Preferred ranges of solvent content are 1-3%, 3-5%, 5-10% or<br>
	10-15% (w/w). The term includes highly viscous liquids as well as dried foamed glass<br>
	and lyophilised solids.<br>
30 	A highly viscous liquid is defined as a material from which solvent has been removed<br>
	by evaporation without boiling, leaving a solvent content less than or equal to 15, 12,<br>
	10, preferably 8, 5,4, 3,2 or 1% (w/w), preferably as determined by the Karl Fischer<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/012160<br>
34<br>
	method. Preferred ranges of solvent content are 1-3%, 3-5%, 5-10% or 10-15% (w/w).<br>
	The highly viscous liquid has a sufficiently low solvent content such that the active<br>
	agent is preserved in a stable state for at least 3,6,9,12 or 24 months at 4 °C, allowing<br>
	the active agent to retain at least 40,50,60, preferably 70, 80, 90 or 95% of its<br>
5	 activity and/or antigenicity over this period. Preferably, the highly viscous liquid has<br>
	a solid appearance but is a glass and is able to flow very slowly over a period of 2,4,<br>
	or 6 days, more preferably 1,2,3,4,6,7,10 or 12 months. The extremely slow flow<br>
	may be measured by inverting a receptacle containing the highly viscous liquid and<br>
	leaving at room temperature until the highly yiscous liquid is observed to flow. In a<br>
10	preferred embodiment, the highly viscous liquid will not appear to flow after 2,4 or 6<br>
	days, preferably 2,3 or 4 weeks, more preferably 2,4,6,8,10 or 12 months in an<br>
	inverted position.<br>
	A viscous liquid is defined as the product of the primary phase of solvent removal, at<br>
15	the end of which the majority of solvent has been lost from the sample. This point can<br>
	be recognised because the rate of evaporation slows down so that the temperature of<br>
	the sample returns to the ambient temperature as the endothermic effect of bulk<br>
	evaporation is lost.<br>
20 	A foamed glass is a dried composition containing a glass forming polyol, which is<br>
	formed by a method wherein the preservation sample is subjected to such temperature<br>
	and pressure conditions that the sample bubbles vigorously or boils so that a foam is<br>
	formed as the sample dries.<br>

	Examples<br>
	The examples below are carried our using standard techniques, which are well known<br>
	and routine to those of skill in the art, except where otherwise described in detail. The<br>
5	 examples are illustrative, but do not limit the invention.<br>
Example 1. Evaporative freezing process<br>
	The process was carried out using a Heto Drywinner 8-85 freeze-dryer in which shelf<br>
10	temperature may be regulated to within 1 °C , the final temperature of the condenser<br>
	is -85 °C, pressure is regulated with a bleed valve and 6 thermocouples are available<br>
	to measure the product temperature.<br>
	A preservation sample was made by adding a stabilising agent (either 10% trehalose<br>
15	or 3.5% sucrose) and an active agent to an aqueous solution. Samples were put into<br>
	the freeze dryer with a shelf temperature maintained at a fixed temperature setting of<br>
	15°C throughout the process. The pressure was initially reduced to 200mBar and<br>
	maintained at this level for 10 minutes before reducing the pressure further. At<br>
	1.5mBar, the solutions began to freeze due to evaporative cooling as shown in figure<br>
20	1. The pressure is further reduced to 0. lmBar to allow the samples to become fully<br>
	frozen. The pressure was then increased to between 0.8mBar and 3.5mBar at which<br>
	point a foam formed as water was lost from the sample. Under the conditions of the<br>
	experiment, no boiling was seen in a control sample containing only water. The<br>
	samples may be loosing water through evaporation rather than through boiling. After<br>
25	18 hours under these conditions, the samples are dried and the foamed solution<br>
	becomes a foamed glass.<br>
	A similar process was successfully performed keeping the shelf temperature at other<br>
	temperature settings up to 37 °C.<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/012160<br>
36<br>
	Example 2. Establishment of freezing conditions<br>
	Samples were made by dissolving sucrose in water to give 1%, 5%, 10% and 20%<br>
5	 solutions. Samples were put into the freeze dryer with a shelf temperature maintained<br>
	at 15 °C throughout the process. The pressure was initially reduced to 200mBar and<br>
	maintained at this level for 10 minutes before reducing the pressure further to<br>
	SOmBars, SmBars, 2.5mBars, 0.75mBars, 0.4mBars and 0.2mBars. Each pressure<br>
	level was maintained for 20 minutes to allow the temperature to equilibrate and the<br>
10	temperature of the sample was read using a thermocouple. Thermocouples were<br>
	attached to samples with different sucrose concentrations and the temperatures<br>
	recorded in table 1 are mean values of the temperatures.<br>
	Results<br>
15	 All samples froze between 1.66 and 1.1 lmbars, irrespective of the concentration of<br>
	sucrose present. The temperatures measured at different pressures were very close to<br>
	those predicted from the triple point curve. Therefore the presence of sucrose does not<br>
	appear to have a large effect on the temperature of the samples at different pressures.<br>
20 	In a preferred method of the invention, it is necessary to avoid freezing of the sample.<br>
	This could be achieved by maintaining the pressure above 2mBars using a shelf<br>
	temperature of 15°C. At lower temperatures the pressure should be maintained at a<br>
	higher level whereas use of a higher temperature would allow the pressure to be<br>
	reduced further without the samples freezing.<br>

5 	Example 3. Foaming conditions for samples with different sugar concentrations<br>
	Preservation samples containing 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% and 50% sucrose<br>
	were made. Samples were put into the freeze dryer with a shelf temperature<br>
	maintained at 15 °C throughout the process. The pressure was initially reduced to<br>
10	200mbars and maintained at this level for 10 minutes before reducing the pressure<br>
	further. The pressure was further reduced to 0.lmbars to allow the samples to become<br>
	fully frozen. The pressure was then increased to either 0.788mbars, 0.812mbars or<br>
	3.5mbars in subsequent experiment These conditions were maintained for 3 hours for<br>
	the 3.5mbars and 0.812mbars experiments and for 6 hours for the 0.788 mbars<br>
15	experiment. The physical characteristics of each sample were evaluated.<br>
	Results<br>
	As shown in table 2, at a pressure of 3.5mbars, a high sucrose concentration of 50%<br>
20	was required for reliable formation of foam. In contrast, a lower pressure of 0.8mbars<br>
	allowed reliable foam formation at lower sucrose concentrations of 10-25%. The use<br>
	of lower sucrose concentration could be advantageous for preserved samples to be<br>
	used in vaccines for instance. Therefore a process using 0.8mbars and a 10-25%<br>
	sucrose content is preferred.<br><br>

	Example 4. The effect of using siliconized containers<br>
	Preservation samples containing 5%, 10%, 15% and 25% sucrose were made and<br>
	added to vials, some of which were siliconized. In one experiment, samples were put<br>
10	into the freeze dryer with a shelf temperature maintained at 15 °C throughout the<br>
	process. The pressure was initially reduced to 200mbars and maintained at this level<br>
	for 10 minutes before reducing the pressure further. The pressure was further reduced<br>
	to 2.8mbars for 3 hours. During this period, the pressure fell to 2.00mbars as the<br>
	presence of water vapour decreased. The physical characteristics of each sample were<br>
15 evaluated.<br>
	In a second experiment, samples were put into the freeze dryer with a shelf<br>
	temperature maintained at 37°C throughout the process. The pressure was initially<br>
	reduced to 200mbars and maintained at this level for 10 minutes before reducing the<br>
	pressure further. The pressure was further reduced to 2.4mbars for 3 hours. During<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/012160<br>
39<br>
	this period, the pressure fell to l.Oombars as the presence of water vapour decreased.<br>
	The physical characteristics of each sample were evaluated.<br>
	Results<br>
5<br>
	Siliconization had an effect on the degassing of the samples. The reduction of<br>
	pressure to 200mbars resulted in degassing of samples in siliconized vials but hot in<br>
	unsiliconized vials. Degassing was seen by bubbling of the sample.<br>
10 	The siliconisation of the vial also made foam formation more likely to occur and more<br>
	reproducible (table 3). Siliconisation of vials allows foam formation to occur<br>
	reproducibly at lower polyol concentrations. The lower polyol concentration<br>
	decreases the length of time necessary to dry the sample and reduces the effect of<br>
	Maillard reactions or other interactions with the polyol harming the active agent.<br>
15 	Where the sample involved is a vaccine, this reduces the viscosity of the sample and<br>
	allows easier administration.<br><br>

	Example 5. Comparison of preservation of Hib-IPV by conventional freeze<br>
5	 drying or by foam drying<br>
	The active agent to be preserved was a mixture of the PRP polysaccharide of<br>
	Haemophilus influenzae b (Hib) and three strains of inactivated polio virus (IPV). The<br>
	preservation sample was made by dissolving Hib-IPV in either a 3.15% sucrose<br>
10	solution or a 10% trehalose solution.<br>
	The samples were lyophilised either by using a conventional freeze drying sample that<br>
	required three days to perform in a large freeze dryer, or by using the foam drying<br>
	method described in example 1.<br>
15<br>
	The samples were reconstituted in water and an ELISA was used to assess the<br>
	retention of antigenicity of the three polio virus strains. Three polyclonal antibodies<br>
	and three monoclonals, one against each strain, were used in separate ELISAs.<br>
	Results are presented as a percentage of the reading given for a sample which had not<br>
20	undergone the freeze drying or foam drying procedure.<br><br>

	The preserved samples are assessed for their immunogenicity in vivo by inoculating<br>
	groups often mice with the reconstituted IPV-Hib, withdrawing blood from the mice<br>
	and monitoring levels of antibodies against IPV and Hib polysaccharides, for instance<br>
5	 by ELISA or Western blotting. The degree of protection is assessed in a challenge<br>
	mouse model.<br>
	Results<br>
10 	Using either sucrose or trehalose as the polyol, the antigenicity of IPV was maintained<br>
	better using the foam drying technique compared to using conventional freeze drying.<br>

	polysaccharides.<br>
	Preservation samples were prepared containing 3.15% sucrose and IPV or a mixture<br>
	of BPV and Hib polysaccharides. The samples were inserted into a Heto Drywinner 8-<br>
25	85 freeze-dryer and freeze dried at a temperature setting of -32 °C for 40 hours<br>
	followed by continued drying at 4 °C for 16 hours.<br><br>

	The samples were reconstituted in water and an ELIS A was used to assess the<br>
	retention of antigenicity of the three polio virus strains. Three monoclonal antibodies,<br>
	one against each strain, were used in separate ELIS As to assess the degree of antigen<br>
	retention in the reconstituted, freeze dried sample compared to a reference sample that<br>
5	 had not been frozen. Results are presented as a percentage of the reading given for a<br>
	sample which had not undergone the freeze drying or foam drying procedure. .<br>
	Results<br>
	As shown in table 5, the presence of Hib polysacchari.de in the preservation sample<br>
10	with IPV, led to greater retention of IPV antigens after freeze drying than that<br>
	achieved when IPV was freeze dried alone. The Hib polysaccharides have a<br>
	preserving effect on IPV antigenicity in addition to that achieved by having sucrose<br>
	present as a stabilising agent.<br>

	Example 8. Reproducibility of sample quality after freeze drying, foam drying<br>
5	 or foam drying with a freezing step.<br>
	Preservation samples are made up comprising IPV, mumps, measles, rubella, varicella<br>
	zoster virus, CMV, hepatitis, HSV1, HSV2, respiratory syncitial virus, dengue,<br>
	paramyxoviridae such as parainfluenza, togaviridae and influenza viruses, and/or Hib<br>
10	as the active agent. The active agent is dissolved in an aqueous solution containing a<br>
	polyol. Multiple samples are preserved by either freeze drying, foam drying using a<br>
	freezing step following the protocol described in example 1, or foam drying without a<br>
	freezing step using a protocol described in example 4. Samples are reconstituted in an<br>
	aqueous solution and their activity assessed. This is accomplished using ELISA<br>
15	assays as described in example 5 using antibodies specific to native antigens. In the<br>
	case of live viruses, the titre of each sample is established by using the virus to infect<br>
	suitable host cells and assessing the infectivity by plaque formation or by<br>
	immunocytochemistry. Where imrnunogenic compositions or vaccines are foam dried,<br>
	the retention of immunogenicity can be tested in an animal model by immunising<br>
20	groups of animals with vaccine which is foam dried or freeze dried and boosting the<br>
	immune response for instance at 14 and 28 days after the first immunisation. Serum is<br>
	isolated from animals at the end of the immunisation schedule and its titre against the<br>
	vaccine is tested using standard assays, for instance by ELISA,<br>
	immunocytochemistry, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, serum bacteriocidal<br>
25	assay or agglutination assay. Results are complied, first by comparing the activity of<br>
	the active agent after freeze drying, foam drying with a freezing step, or foam drying<br>
	without a freezing step. Secondly, the degree of reproducibility of the preservation<br><br>

	technique is assessed by comparing the range of activities after subjecting samples to<br>

	37°C or 23°C for seven days and are compared for activity with samples that have<br>
15	been keep at 4°C. Samples are reconstituted in an aqueous solution and their activity<br>
	assessed. This will be accomplished using ELISA assays as described in example 5<br>
	using antibodies specific to native antigens. In the case of live viruses, the titre of<br>
	each sample is established by using the virus to infect suitable host cells and assessing<br>
	the infectivity by plaque formation or by immunocytochemistry. Results are<br>
20	complied, first by comparing the activity of the active agent after storage at elevated<br>
	temperatures with storage at 4°C. Secondly, the degree of reproducibility of the<br>
	preservation technique is assessed by comparing the range of activities after<br>
	subjecting samples to each set of conditions.<br>

	Preservation samples containing 5%, 10%, 15% and 25% sucrose were made and<br>
	added to vials. Samples were put into a freeze dryer at a temperature setting of 15 °C<br>
	throughout the process. The pressure was initially reduced to 200mBars and<br>
30	maintained at this level for 10 minutes to allow degassing before reducing the<br>
	pressure further. The pressure was further reduced to 8mbars for two to three hours<br>
	during which time thermocouples inside the samples showed that the sample<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/012160<br>
46<br>
	temperature reduced to 4 °C due to evaporative cooling. After 2-3 hours, the<br>
	temperature of the samples returned to 15 °C, indicating that evaporation under these<br>
	temperature and pressure conditions was near completion. During this stage of the<br>
	process, the sample did not boil to form a foam or freeze so that an active agent within<br>
5	 the sample is exposed to as little stress as possible. The samples have a solid<br>
	appearance, similar to the final product.<br>
	Further drying of the samples was achieved by reducing the pressure further to<br>
	0.lmbars while keeping the shelf temperature setting at 15 °C. These conditions were<br>
10	maintained for a further 10-16 hours. During this phase, the sample temperature<br>
	remained at 15 °C since the rate of evaporation was slow. Further drying took place<br>
	and the resultant sample had a solid appearance. If the sample was place on its side,<br>
	the sample contents slowed very slowly, over a period of days or months showing that<br>
	the sample is a liquid glass of high viscosity. Figure 2 shows that the containing<br>
15	holding the highly viscous liquid can be inverted without provoking immediate flow<br>
	of the highly viscous liquid.<br>
	Example 11 Retention of IPV immunogenicity after drying without freezing or<br>
	foam formation<br>
20<br>
	Samples dried according to the method of example 10 have not been subjected to<br>
	stresses associated with the bubbling that accompanies foam formation or freezing.<br>
	Experiments were performed to determine whether this method produced a high level<br>
	of antigen retention when used to dry IPV.<br>
25<br>
	Three separate experiments were performed in which IPV was resuspended in an<br>
	aqueous solution with 10% sucrose or 10% trehalose as the stabilising agent. The<br>
	samples were put into siliconised vials which were placed into a Heto Drywinner 8-85<br>
	freeze-dryer and the temperature was set to 15 °C. The pressure was initially reduced<br>
30	to 35mBars to degas the sample. After 10 minutes, the pressure was further reduced to<br>
	8mBars and was kept at this level for two hours. During this period the temperature<br>
	setting was kept at 15 °C and the temperature into the sample was monitored. As<br><br>
WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/012160<br>
47<br>
	water evaporated from the sample, the temperature dropped to 4 °C but towards the<br>
	end of the two hours, the temperature returned to 15 °C as the rate of evaporation<br>
	slowed. No bubbling or foam formation occurred under these conditions. The pressure<br>
	was then reduced further to 0.ltnbars and these conditions were maintained for 16<br>
5	 hours more in the first two experiments and for 10 hours more in the third 	experiment.<br>
	The samples were reconstituted in water and an ELIS A was used to assess the<br>
	retention of antigenicity of the three polio virus strains. The monoclonal antibody<br>
	against type 3IPV, was used in an ELISA to assess the degree of antigen retention in<br>
10	the reconstituted, freeze dried sample compared to a reference sample that had not<br>
	been frozen. Results are presented as a percentage of the reading given for a sample<br>
	which had not undergone a drying procedure.<br>
	Results<br>
15	The dried samples had a solid appearance however they appeared to be in the form of<br>
	a highly viscous liquid/glass since, over a period of days, the dried solid was able to<br>
	flow if the container was inverted at room temperature.<br>

10<br>
	IPV dried using the method described in Example 11 was stored at 4 °C for 9 months.<br>
	The samples were reconstituted in water with 150mM NaCl and an ELISA was used<br>
	to assess the retention of antigenicity of the three polio virus strains. Three<br>
	monoclonal antibodies, one against each strain, were used in separate ELISAs to<br>
15	assess the degree of antigen retention in the reconstituted stored sample. A similar<br>
	ELISA had been carried out on reconstituted samples from the same batch prior to<br>
	storage. All results were compared to a reference sample that had not been dried.<br>
	Results are presented as a percentage of the reading given for a sample which had not<br>
	undergone a drying procedure.<br>

	form a highly viscous liquid and reconstitution compared to undried IPV<br>
	Groups of 10 Wistar rats were inoculated with various dilutions of IPV which had<br>
	. been dried in the presence of 10% sucrose to form a highly viscous liquid using the<br>
10	method disclosed in Example 10 and reconstituted. Further groups of 10 Wistar rats<br>
	were inoculated with reference samples of IPV which had been prepared in the same<br>
	way but which had not been dried.<br>
	After 21 days, sera were taken from all the rats and the sera were tested in separate<br>
15	immunoprecipitation assays using Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3 polio virus.<br>
	Results are shown in table 10 that contains:- a) the number of responant rats for each<br>
	IPV dilution, b) the ED50 which is the dose that is required to ensure that 50% of the<br>
	rats seroconvert as assessed by the immunoprecipitation assay and c) the relative<br>
20	potency of the dried and reconstituted IPV compared to the undried reference IPV.<br>

WO 2004/039399 	PCT/EP2003/012160<br>
50<br>
	Table 10 shows that the number of respondants inoculated with each dilution of IPV<br>
	is similar between the two batches of dried and reconstituted IPV and the undried<br>
	reference sample. In general, Type 1 IPV elicited the best immune response, with<br>
	Type 2 eliciting an immune response in slightly fewer rats. Type 3 elicited the<br>
5	 weakest immune response.<br>
	The process of drying to form a highly viscous liquid does not impair the ability of<br>
	IPV to elicit immunoprecipitating antibodies in vivo. A relative potency (RP) reading<br>
	of 1.0 indicates that the sample elicits an equivalent response to the reference sample.<br>
10	Both dried samples produce RP readings of close to 1.0 for all three types of polio<br>
	virus indicating the drying process does not effect the ability of the sample to elicit an<br>
	immune response.<br>
	Example 14 Effect of drying to form a highly viscose liquid using sucrose or<br>
15	trehalose as stabilising agent on the ability of IPV to elicit an<br>
	immunoprecipitating immune response in vivo<br>
	Groups of 10 Wistar rats were inoculated with IPV which had been dried in the<br>
	presence of either 10% sucrose or 10% trehalose as described in Example 2, and then<br>
20	reconstituted. Further groups of 10 Wistar rats were inoculated with an equivalent<br>
	amount of IPV that had not been dried, as reference samples.<br>
	After 21 days, sera were collected from all rats and an immunoneutralisation assay, as<br>
	described in Example 5 was used to assess the amount of immunoneutralising<br>
25	antibody that had been raised against each of Type 1 ,Type 2 and Type 3 polio virus.<br>
	Relative potencies were calculated for each sample by comparing the immune<br>
	response to that elicited by the undried reference sample.<br>
30	 Results are shown in Table 11.<br>

	The amount of water remaining in samples was lower when sucrose was used as<br>
	stabilising agent with approximately 5% humidity remaining compared to<br><br>

51<br>
	approximately 10% when trehalose was used as the stabilising agent measured by the<br>
	Karl Fischer method.<br>
	Both sucrose and trehalose were effective at stabilising EPV during the drying process<br>
5	 so that the reconstituted IPV gave relative potency readings approaching 1.0 for most<br>
	of the different types of polio virus. The relative potencies were particularly good for<br>
	Type 3 polio virus which looses its immunogenicity relatively easily.<br>
	Example 15: Measurement of humidity by Karl Fischer<br>
10<br>
	Analysis was carried out in a Karl Fischer titrometer (Aqua 30.00 - Elektrochemie<br>
	Halle). The sample was weighed out and placed into the oven at a setting of 80 °C.<br>
	The sample was flushed with nitrogen gas and then added to hydranal reagent (Riedel<br>
	de Hahn) in order to perform the analysis by coulometry.<br><br>
