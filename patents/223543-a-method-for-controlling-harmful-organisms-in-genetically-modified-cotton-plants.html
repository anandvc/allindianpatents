Description<br>
Method for controlling harmful organisms in crops of useful plants<br>
The invention relates to a method for controlling harmful organisms in crops of Bt cotton.<br>
Genetically modified cotton plants which express toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and which are consequently resistant to attack by certain harmful insects are known and are increasingly employed in commercial agriculture (see, for example, US-A 5,322,938).<br>
Although cotton which is genetically modified in this way already has very good properties, there are still a number of problems, so that a wide scope for improvement still exists.<br>
For example, Bt toxins are not effective against all important cotton pests (see, for example, Flint, H.M. et al. (1995) Southwestern Entomologist 20/3, 281-292), the efficacy is insufficient at a high infestation intensity (see, for example, EPA Hearing Docket OPP-0478 (1997) Plant Pesticides Resistance Management, The Agriculture Program, The Texas A&amp;M University System, College Station, Texas 77843), Bt-resistance or Bt-cross-resistance may occur (see, for example, Gould, F. et al. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94, 3519-3523 or Bauer, L.S. (1995) Florida Entomologist 78/3, 414), or particular parts of plants may differ considerably in their insecticidal activity (see, for example, Lozzia, G.C. and Rigamonti, I.E. (1996) Boll. Zool. agr. Buchic Ser II, 28/1, 51-69).<br>
It was therefore another object to provide the most effective and environmentally compatible problem solutions possible for controlling pests of cotton.<br>
WO-A 97/45 017 describes a process for controlling Lepidoptera in Bt cotton where an insecticidally active benzoylurea derivative is additionally<br><br>
used. It is not possible to draw conclusions with respect to the activity of other classes of insecticides from this publication.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that certain classes of insecticides show synergistic effects when used in combination with Bt cotton.<br>
The invention therefore provides a method for controlling harmful organisms in genetically modified cotton plants which contain a gene derived from Bacillus thuringiensis which encodes and expresses an insecticidally active protein, which comprises applying an insecticidally effective amount of one or more compounds from the following groups a-f to the plants, to their seeds or propagation stock and/or to the area in which they are cultivated:<br>

The method according to the invention makes it possible to reduce the application rate of crop protection agents which act synergistically with the transgenic plants, and also to increase and widen the efficacy of the transgenic plants, and therefore offers economical and ecological advantages.<br>
The advantages of the method are, on the one hand, synergisms with the Bacillus thuringiensis toxins (Bt toxins) produced in the transgenic plant and, on the other hand, for example, a reduced number of applications or a reduction of the application rates to in some instances sublethal dosages (compared to the conventional application of the individual insecticides) and an associated considerably reduced environmental burden.<br>
In particular combinations of the abovementioned active compounds show, together with the endogenously produced Bt toxins (i.e. produced within the transgenic plants) a distinct synergistic effect on a large number of harmful organisms to be controlled.<br>
The invention also provides the use of compounds from the abovementioned groups a-f for controlling harmful organisms in genetically modified cotton plants which contain a gene derived from Bacillus thuringiensis which encodes and expresses an insecticidally active protein.<br><br>

The insecticidally active compounds used according to the invention are known and commercially available.<br>
Deltamethrin, endosulfan, triazaphos, amitraz, piperonyl butoxide and Bacillus thuringiensis, for example, are obtainable from Hoechst Sobering AgrEvo GmbH, Berlin, Germany.<br>
The compounds are furthermore described in detail in The Pesticide Manual, 11th ed., British Crop Protection Council, Farnham 1997. Instructions for their preparation are likewise given in this publication.<br>
Baculum viruses are described, for example, in J. ind. Microbiol. &amp; Biotech. 1997, 19, 192.<br>
The compounds of group (f) are described in WO-A98/57 969, with preparation processes and use examples.<br>
These sources and the literature cited therein are expressly referred to herewith; they are incorporated into this description by reference.<br>
The insecticides used according to the invention are usually obtainable as commercial formulations. However, they can be formulated, if appropriate, in various ways, depending on the biological and/or chemical physical parameters which prevail. Possible formulations are, for example:<br>
wettable powders (WP), emulsifiable concentrates (EC), aqueous solutions (SL), emulsions, sprayable solutions, oil- or water-based dispersions (SC), suspoemulsions (SE), dusting agents (DP), seed-dressing products, granules in the form of microgranules, spray granules, coated granules and adsorption granules, water-dispersible granules (WG), ULV formulations, microcapsules, waxes or baits.<br>
These individual types of formulation are known in principle and are described, for example, in:<br>
Winnacker-Kuchler, -Chemische Technologie- [Chemical Technology], Volume 7, C. Hauser Verlag Munich, 4th ed.  1986; van Falkenberg,<br><br>
-Pesticides Formulations-, Marcel Dekker N.Y., 2nd ed. 1972-73; K. Martens, -Spray Drying Handbook-. 3rd ed. 1979, G. Goodwin Ltd. London.<br>
The formulation auxiliaries required, such as inert materials, surfactants, solvents and other additives, are likewise known and are described, for example, in:<br>
Watkins, -Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers-, 2nd ed., Darland Books, Caldwell N.J.; H.v. Olphen, -Introduction to Clay Colloid Chemistry-, 2nd ed., J. Wiley &amp; Sons, N.Y.; Marsden, -Solvents Guide-, 2nd ed., Interscience, N.Y. 1950; McCutcheon's, -Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual-, MC Publ. Corp., Ridgewood N.J.; Sisley and Wood, -Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents-, Chem. Publ. Co. Inc., N.Y. 1964; Schonfeldt, -Grenzflachenaktive Athylenoxidaddukte- [Surf ace-Active Ethylene Oxide Adducts], Wiss. Verlagsgesell., Stuttgart 1967; Winnacker-KiJchler, -Chemische Technologie-, Volume 7, C. Hauser Verlag Munich, 4th ed. 1986.<br>
Based on these formulations, it is also possible to produce combinations with other pesticidally active compounds, fertilizers and/or growth regulators, for example in the form of a readymix or a tank mix. Wettable powders are preparations, uniformly dispersible in water, which contain, beside the active compound and in addition to a diluent or inert material, wetting agents, for example polyethoxylated alkylphenols, polyethoxylated fatty alcohols, alkyl- or alkylphenolsulfonates, and dispersing agents, for example sodium ligninsulfonate or sodium 2,2'-dinaphthylmethane-6,6'-disulfonate.<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates are prepared by dissolving the active compound in an organic solvent, for example butanol, cyclohexanone, dimethylformamide, xylene or higher-boiling aromatics or hydrocarbons, with addition of one or more emulsifiers. As emulsifiers, the following can be used, for example: calcium salts of alkylarylsulfonates, such as Ca dodecylbenzenesulfonate, or nonionic emulsifiers such as fatty acid polyglycol esters, alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers, propylene oxide/ethylene oxide condensation products, alkyl polyethers, sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters or polyoxyethylene sorbitol esters.<br><br>
Dusting agents are obtained by grinding the active compound with finely divided solid substances, for example talc, natural clays such as kaolin, bentonite, pyrophillite or diatomaceous earth. Granules can be prepared either by atomizing the active compound onto adsorptive, granulated inert material or by applying active compound concentrates onto the surface of carriers such as sand or kaolinites, or of granulated inert material, by means of adhesives, for example polyvinyl alcohol or sodium poiyacrylate, or alternatively mineral oils. Suitable active compounds can also be granulated in the fashion conventional for the preparation of fertilizer granules, if desired as a mixture with fertilizers.<br>
In wettable powders, the concentration of active compound is, for example, from approximately 10 to 90% by weight, the remainder to 100% by weight being composed of customary formulation components. In the case of emulsifiable concentrates, the concentration of active compound may be from approximately 5 to 80% by weight. Formulations in dust form comprise at most from 5 to 20% by weight of active compound, sprayable solutions from about 2 to 20% by weight. In the case of granules, the content of active compound depends partly on whether the active compound is in liquid or solid form and on which granulation auxiliaries, fillers, etc. are being used.<br>
In addition, the abovementioned formulations of active compound comprise, if appropriate, the tackifiers, wetting agents, dispersants, emulsifiers, penetrants, solvents, fillers or carriers which are customary in each case.<br>
The concentrates, which are in the commercially customary form, are if appropriate diluted in the customary manner for their use, for example using water in the case of wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, dispersions and some microgranules. Dust and granule preparations, and also sprayable solutions, are normally not diluted any further with other inert substances before being used.<br>
The application rate required varies with the external conditions, such as temperature and humidity among others. It can fluctuate within wide limits, for example between 0.1 g/ha and 1.0 kg/ha or more of active compound, but is preferably between 0.1 g/ha and 0.3 kg/ha. Owing to the synergistic<br><br>
effects between Bt cotton and insecticide, particular preference is given to application rates of from 0.5 to 50 g/ha.<br>
For pyrethroids (b), application rates of from 0.1 to 10 g/ha are preferred and particular preference is given to application rates of from 0.1 to 6.0 g/ha.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention may be present in their commercially customary formulations, and in the application forms prepared from these formulations, as mixtures with other active compounds, such as insecticides, attractants, sterilants, acaricides, nematicides, fungicides, growth regulators or herbicides.<br>

For the purpose of the invention, the term -Bt cotton- is to be understood as cotton plants or crops which are genetically modified in such a way that they contain and express one or more genes from Bacillus thuringiensis which encode crystal proteins from the Cry family, see, for example, D.L. Prieto-Sansonor et al., J. Ind. Microbiol. &amp; Biotechn. 1997, 19, 202 and 1997 BCPL Symposium Proceedings No. 68, 83-100).<br>
Preference is given to genes encoding the proteins CrylAa, Cry 1 Ad, CrylAb, CrylAe, CrylAc, CrylFa, CrylFb, CrylGa, CrylGb, CrylDa, CrylDb, CryIHa, CrylHb, CryICa, CrylCb, CrylEa, CrylEb, CryUa, CryUb, CryIBb, CrylBc, CrylBd, CrylBa, CrylKa, Crylla, Crylb, Cry7Aa, Cry7Ab, Cry9Ca, Cry9Da, Cry9Ba, Cry9Aa, CrySAa, Cry8Ba, Cry8Ca, CrySAa, CrySCa, CrySBa, CrySBb, Cry4Aa, Cry4Ba, CrylOAa, Cry19Aa, Cry19Ba, CrylSAa, Cry17Aa, CrySAb, CrySBa, Cry12Aa, CrylSAa, Cry14Aa, CrylSAa, Cry2Aa, Cry2Ab, Cry2Ac, CrylSAa, CryllAa, CryllBa, CytlAa, CytlAb, CytlBa, Cyt2Aa.

Very particular preference is given to the subfamilies Cryl and Cry9, in particular to Cry lA, CrylC, CrylF, and Cry9C.<br>
Preference is furthermore given to using plants containing genes for a plurality of Bt proteins.<br>
In addition to the expression of toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) for insect resistance, the transgenic crop plants may also have other transgenic properties, for example further insect resistances (for example by expression of a protease or peptidase inhibitor, cf, WO-A-95/35031), herbicide resistances (for example against glufosinates or glyphosates by expression of the pat or bar gene) or else resistance against nematodes, fungi or viruses (for example by expression of a glucanase, chitinase), or may also be genetically modified in their metabolic properties, resulting in a qualitative and/or quantitative change of ingredients (for example by modification of the energy, carbohydrate, fatty acid or nitrogen metabolism or by metabolite streams which influence these). Preference is given, for example, to Bt cotton plants which additionally have glufosinate or glyphosate resistance.<br>
Bt cotton is known and, including methods for its preparation, described in detail, for example, in US-A-5,322,938; Prietro-Samsonor et al., J. Ind. Microbiol. &amp; Biotechn. 1997, 19, 202, and H. Agaisse and D. Lereclus, J. Bacteriol. 1996, 177,6027.<br>
Bt cotton is furthermore commercially available in different varieties, for example under the name NuCOTN®from Deltapine (USA).<br><br>
For the method according to the invention, preference is given to the following types of Bt cotton: NuCOTN33® and NuCOTN33B®.<br>
Routes for preparing transgenic plants which, in comparison to naturally occurring plants, have modified properties, consist, for example, in the use of genetic engineering process (see, for example, Willmitzer L., 1993, Transgenic plants. In: Biotechnology, A Multivolume Comprehensive Treatise, Rehm et aL (eds.) Vol.2, 627-659, VCH Weinheim, Germany; D^Halluin et al., 1992, Biotechnology 10, 309-314, McCormick et aL, Plant Cell Reports,1986, 5, 81-84; EP-A-0221044 and EP-A-0131624).<br>
What is described is, for example, the preparation of genetically modified plants with respect to modifications of the hydrocarbon metabolism of the plant (for example WO 94/28146, WO 92/11376, WO 92/14827, WO 91/19806), resistances against certain herbicides, for example of the glufosinate type (cf., for example EP-A-0242236, EP-A-242246) or glyphosate type (for example WO 92/00377).<br>
Numerous techniques of molecular biology which allow the preparation of novel transgenic plants having modified properties are known to the person skilled in the art; see, for example, Sambrook et al., 1989, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY; or Winnacker, Gene und Klone [Genes and clones], VCH Weinheim 2nd Edition, 1996 or Christou, Trends in Plant Science 1 (1996)423-431).<br>
In order to carry out such genetic manipulations, it is possible to introduce suitable nucleic acid molecules into plants or plant cells, for example by using suitable vectors which allow mutagenesis or a change in the sequence to occur by recombination of DNA sequences. Using the abovementioned standard processes, it is possible, for example, to exchange bases, to remove partial sequences or to add natural or synthetic sequences. It is also possible, for example, to replace the naturally occurring genes completely by heterologous or synthetic genes.<br><br>
preferably under the control of a promoter which is active in plant cells (-gene replacement-). To link the DNA fragments with each other, it is possible to attach adapters or linkers to the fragments.<br>
Plant cells having a reduced activity of a gene product can be prepared, for example, by expressing at least one appropriate antisense-RNA, a sense-RNA to achieve a cosuppression effect, or by expressing at least one appropriately constructed ribozyme which specifically cleaves transcripts of the abovementioned gene product.<br>
To this end, it is possible to employ both DNA molecules which comprise the entire coding sequence of the gene product including any flanking sequences that may be present, and DNA molecules which comprise only parts of the coding sequence, it being necessary for these parts to be long enough to cause an antisense effect in the cells. It is also possible to use DNA sequences which have a high degree of homology to the coding sequences of a gene product but which are not entirely identical.<br>
When expressing nucleic acid molecules in plants, the synthesized protein can be localized in any desired compartment of the plant cells. However, to achieve localization in a certain compartment, it is, for example, possible to link the coding region with DNA sequences which ensure localization in a certain compartment or at a certain point of time (at a certain stage or chemically or biologically induced) (for example transit or signal peptides, time- or site-specific promoters). Such sequences are known to the person skilled in the art (see, for example, Braun et al., EMBO J. 11 (1992), 3219-3227; Wolter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 (1988), 846-850; Sonnewald et al., Plant J. 1 (1991), 95-106).<br>
Transgenic plant cells can be regenerated to whole plants using known techniques.<br>
In this manner, it is possible to obtain transgenic plants which have modified properties by overexpression, suppression or inhibition of<br><br>
homologous (i.e. natural) genes or gene sequences or by expression of heterologous (i.e. foreign) genes or gene sequences.<br>
