The present invention relates to a process for decomposing organic hydroperoxides in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
Organic hydroperoxides are important intermediates in the preparation of alcohols, ketones and acids, and are themselves often used as raw materials in organic synthesis.<br>
Among these organic hydroperoxides, cyclohexyl hydroperoxide is prepared by the oxidation of cyclohexane. Catalytic decomposition of the latter leads to cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol. The latter two compounds may be converted into adipic acid by oxidation. Adipic acid is an important chemical intermediate used in the manufacture of many polymers, such as polyamides and polyurethanes for example. This compound may have many other applications.<br>
The decomposition of organic hydroperoxides and especially of cyclohexyl hydroperoxide (CHHPO) may firstly be carried out by homogeneous  catalysis, that is to say in the presence of a catalyst dissolved in the reaction mixture. Thus, patent FR-A-1 580 206 describes the oxidation of a cycloalkane in liquid phase followed by heating of the cycloalkyl hydroperoxide solution in the cycloalkane thus<br><br>
obtained, in the presence of a soluble chromium derivative as catalyst. Likewise, the article from the Journal of Molecular Catalysis (1988), 48, pages 129 to 148 describes the use of organic salts, such as cobalt octanoate or of complexes, dissolved in the organic liquid phase in which the reaction takes place.<br>
However, the use of such inexpensive salts has drawbacks since these catalysts very rapidly become deactivated, causing them to precipitate in the mixture.<br>
To remedy these problems, more complex catalytic systems have been recommended, such as complexes between a metal and porphyrins or phthalocyanines. Such systems have, for example, been described in the patent US 5 672 778 and the articles published in Catalysis Letters 2_0, 1993, 359-364 or 36, 1996, 69-73. Complexes based on cobalt and on similar ligands have also been described in the article published in Journal of the American Chemical Society (1985), 107, pages 3534 to 3540.<br>
It has also been proposed, for example in European Patent 270 468, to use ruthenium and a coordinate based on bis(pyridyl-2-imino)-1,3-isoindoline.<br>
These catalytic systems have drawbacks, especially associated with their stability (oxidation resistance) and their complexity, making them<br><br>
expensive.<br>
It has also been proposed to decompose the hydroperoxide by heterogeneous catalysis, that is to say in the presence of a catalyst not dissolved in the reaction mixture. However, these catalysts often have a rapidly decreasing activity, this loss of activity being due, for example, to elution of the catalytic phase.<br>
Moreover, it has also been proposed to use catalysts which make it possible, simultaneously with the decomposition of the hydroperoxide into an alcohol and/or a ketone, to oxidize the hydrocarbon used as solvent, thus allowing the total conversion yield from hydrocarbon to alcohol and ketone to be improved. This oxidation is called in the present technical field uan oxygen transfer". It consists in transferring one of the oxygen atoms of the hydroperoxide to the hydrocarbon in order to obtain the corresponding alcohol. European Patent 0331590 describes the use of a homogeneous catalyst based on osmium complexes, which is used to obtain an oxygen transfer of around 4 0%.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a novel heterogeneous catalytic system which is economically beneficial and makes it possible in particular to obtain a high level of oxygen transfer.<br>
More specifically, it provides a process for decomposing organic hydroperoxides in the presence of a<br><br>
catalyst into a mixture of alcohols and ketones, in<br>
which the catalyst comprises at least one ruthenium-	based catalytically active metallic element	c<br>
incorporated into a solid support chosen from the group<br>
comprising metal oxides and carbon blacks, such as the<br>
carbon blacks obtained by pyrolysis of organic<br>
compounds.<br>
The catalyst of the invention is a heterogeneous catalyst that can be obtained by any 1  standard technique for manufacturing catalysts referred to as supported catalysts. Thus, the term "incorporated" used above covers all forms of linking between the support and the ruthenium compound(s) or complex(es). Thus, this term covers both absorption of the ruthenium compounds on a support and coprecipitation of the ruthenium and a precursor of the support. The ruthenium may be simply deposited on the surface of the support, especially the surface of at least certain pores of the support, or otherwise it may be linked to the said support via electronic bonds.<br>
The suitable supports for the invention advantageously have a high specific surface area and are oxidation resistant. Metal oxides having a specific c surface area of greater than 10 m2/g, advantageously greater than 100 m2/g, are the preferred supports of the invention.<br>
As examples of suitable supports for the<br><br>
invention, mention may be made of aluminas, rare-earth oxides, such as cerium or lanthanum oxide, zirconium     ,,b oxide and magnesium oxide, silica and various carbon blacks preferably having a high specific surface area, such as, for example, acetylene blacks.<br>
The catalyst of the invention may also include other metallic elements for improving or doping the catalytic activity of the ruthenium. As metallic elements suitable to act as dopants, mention may be made of the transition metals such as those belonging to Groups lb, 2b, 3b, 4b, 5b, 6b, 7b and 8 of the        cS0**0 Periodic Table of Elements as published in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics,   66th  edition (1985/1986) by The Chemical Rubber Co.<br>
Mention may more particularly be made of<br>
titanium, zirconium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum,	\o±^' J<br>
chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, manganese, rhenium, iron, cobalt, nickel, rhodium, palladium, platinum, iridium, osmium, copper, silver, gold and rare-earth metals such as lanthanum and cerium.<br>
The decomposition reaction of the invention is carried out in liquid phase, the concentration of   cW^ the hydroperoxide being between 0.1 and 80% by weight in the reaction mixture. Advantageously, this concentration is between 0.5 and 20%.<br>
Various solvents may be used such as alkanes, among which mention may more particularly be made of<br><br>
hexane, heptane and isooctane; cycloalkanes, among which mention may be made by way of illustration of   \^r-cyclohexane and cyclooctane; aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene and xylene; halogenated hydrocarbons; and mixtures of these solvents.<br>
However, it should be noted that since the hydroperoxide is generally produced in the form of a<br>
solution in a hydrocarbon, for example cyclohexane, by<br>
c\ oxidation of the latter, the decomposition reaction is     , v^'<br>
advantageously carried out in a solution coming from<br>
the oxidation of the hydrocarbon (cyclohexane) in which<br>
the hydroperoxide concentration lies within the limits<br>
indicated above. This solution may be used as it stands<br>
or after certain constituents have been removed in a<br>
manner known per se. It is also possible to use a<br>
solution of hydroperoxide in the solvent, for example<br>
substantially pure cyclohexane.<br>
The amount of catalyst involved may vary widely, especially depending on the conditions under which the process is carried out, namely a continuous, semi-continuous or batch process. In general, the amount of catalyst expressed as a molar percentage of     .&gt; active metal with respect to the hydroperoxide to be decomposed represents from 0.0001% to 20% and preferably from 0.01% to 10%.<br>
Within the context of a continuous operation of the process, it is obvious that the amount of<br><br>
catalyst with respect to the hydroperoxide has no meaning and that the ratios indicated above may then be much higher.<br>
The temperature is generally between 20 and    ^ 200°C and preferably between 80 and 130°C.<br>
Atmospheric pressure or pressure above atmospheric pressure will be sufficient to maintain the cyclohexane in the liquid phase.<br>
The reaction time (or the residence time) is generally between a few minutes and 4 hours and can be adjusted in accordance with the production objectives, the amount of the various constituents of the catalytic system involved and the other parameters of the reaction.<br>
At the end of reaction, the products may be recovered and/or separated by any suitable means, for example by distillation.<br>
The hydroperoxides employed in the process of<br>
the invention are in general primary or secondary<br>
hydroperoxides derived from alkanes, cycloalkanes,<br>
aromatic alkyl hydrocarbons, the aromatic ring of which<br>
possibly has one or more substituents such as	cS°*<br>
especially an alkyl group or a halogen atom, more particularly a chlorine atom, alkenes and cycloalkenes having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms.<br>
As examples of such hydroperoxides, mention      Al\ may be made of cyclohexyl hydroperoxide, cyclododecyl<br><br>
hydroperoxide, tetralin hydroperoxide, ethylbenzene hydroperoxide and pinane hydroperoxide.<br>
Among these hydroperoxides, one of the more useful ones is very certainly cyclohexyl hydroperoxide, the oxidation of which results in cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone, these being intermediates in the preparation of adipic acid - one of the base compounds of nylon-6,6.<br>
The examples below, given solely by way of indication, will illustrate the invention and its advantages and details.<br>

The supported catalysts were tested under conventional deperoxidation conditions: 40 g of oxidate (coming from the self-oxidation of cyclohexane (5% CHHPO, as described in Patent FR2087375) were brought into contact with about 170 mg of heterogeneous catalyst for several hours at 80°C in a reactor on which a Dean Stark apparatus was fitted (for continuous removal of the water formed in the reaction mixture).<br><br>
The catalysts (containing 5 wt% Ru) were used with Ru/CHHPO molar ratios of 0.5%. The residual CHHPO concentrations were measured by potentiometric back titration (iodine/thiosulphate) and the cyclohexanol (CHol) and cyclohexanone (CHone) concentrations were measured by GC. The results are given in the table below. DC (degree of conversion) is understood to mean the ratio of the number of moles of CHHPO converted to the initial number of moles of CHHPO.<br><br><br><br>
