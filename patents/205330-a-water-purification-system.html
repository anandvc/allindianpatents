THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 (39 of 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br>
A WATER PURIFICATION SYSTEM <br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The  following  specification   particularly  describes  the   nature  of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
Technical field :<br>
The present invention relates to water purification system and in particular gravity fed water purification system directed to enable online generation/dispensing of purified water.<br>
Background art:<br>
It is presently known to have purified water for consumption in the form of both packaged units such as those of 1 to 5 litres and also in the form of online automatic drinking water machines for continued supply of purified drinking water. As regards the purified water in packages, it is found that the same had limited applications in that in would serve only limited number of consumers in view of limitations in its contents. Thus, such packaged units can at best serve limited applications and need to be continuously replaced by fresh packages requiring regular supply from the vendor/manufacturer.<br>
It is also known to have online vending units for drinking water, which would provide automatic purified water.<br>
EP 0947518A1. discloses an automatic drinks vending machine comprising a supply unit, a purifying means and involving electronic gadgets for regulated supply of the purified water online.<br>
US 4528093 discloses a further method and apparatus for purifying and dispensing purified water and purified ice comprising essential an online reverse osmosis unit to favour the purification and an online supply of water.<br>
US 5112477 discloses yet further development on the vending machine for dispensing purified ice or purified water with means for compartmentalised storage and supply of purified water and purified ice. The system also essentially involves the use of reverse osmosis unit to facilitate the online supply of purified water and/or the purified ice from the purified water.<br>
WO 0071783-A1 discloses a water disinfection, filtration and pump system comprising a portable disinfection device, sweet water filter system and a reverse osmosis filter<br>
2<br><br>
system.   The system involves pump means, electrodes and operative circuitry and electrolyte means for generating at least one oxidant for water disinfecting purposes. It would be apparent from the above that the above online units for providing purified water involve complex mechanical-electrical gadgets which make it complicated to operate and also to install.<br>
It is also known to have simpler online water purification devices which are simple in construction and use filtering candles to filter/purify water from an online supply and provide purified water by gravity feel into dispenser means located immediately thereunder the candle filtration unit.<br>
However, it is experienced that such filtration units also have limitations in terms of refilling of the bucket containing the candle each time the same is exhausted to resume supply of purified water through the dispenser. In particular, such conventional units could accommodate only about 10-12 litres at one time and a continuous monitoring of the contents and timely refilling was essential.<br>
It is also known to have filtration systems based on gravity feed having higher capacity such as upto 20 litres. However, in such systems, considering the high volume of the contents, the purification of the water is carried out at a separate purifying unit and thereafter the purified water in containers of 20 litres are supported / disposed on dispensers at the consumers' premises for regulated gravity discharge of purified water as and when required.<br>
However, while the volume of the system could be increased to 20 litres, that was not sufficient enough to meet the usually heavy demands in premises such as offices / industrial establishments. Accordingly, each time the 20 litre container containing the purified water is exhausted the same required to be replaced manually by a fresh 20 litre pack brought from the purified unit. This require extensive manual efforts and monitoring which made its applications complex and at times cost extensive,<br>
It would thus be apparent from the above that while various water purifying systems/vending machines have been available, those are either complex in terms of<br>
3<br><br>
involvement of mechanical-electrical / electronic gadgets or are complex in terms of regular manual monitoring and replacement requirements.<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for an online system for supply for purified water for installation especially in areas of bulk consumption which would be simple to install, safe for consumption and would also be cost effective.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide for an online system of supply of purified water through dispensing means by gravity feed avoiding the need for any complex pump means and/or electronic gadgets for its operation and use.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide for a simple and cost effective system of providing purified water which can be adopted for operative collection to installations such as beverage making machines, juicer units, ice making machines amongst others applications.<br>
Yet further object of the invention is directed to provide for a water purification system which would be simple and would not use complex techniques of reverse osmosis, ultra violet systems and wherein purification can be achieved by usual cartridge/candle filters.<br>
Yet further object is directed to providing for a system of generating purified water which would reduce the cost of filtration and make available filters that purify water at cost effective price and would essentially guarantee microbial purity at point of use.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention there is provided a water purification system comprising :<br>
a purification unit having a top chamber and a bottom chamber, filtering/purifying means provided in said unit such that water from such top chamber is purified by such filtering/purifying means and adopted to flow by gravity to said bottom chamber, means for equalising the air pressure in top of said bottom chamber and the top of said top chamber to facilitate the gravity feed of the water from said top chamber into said bottom chamber; and<br>
4<br><br>
a dispenser positioned thereunder said bottom chamber of said purification unit and operatively connected thereto to provide for gravity flow of the purified water from said bottom chamber to said dispenser. Said dispenser having means for regulated discharge of purified water as and when desired.<br>
Importantly, the pressure equalisation means used in the above system is provided such as to equalise the pressure on top of the bottom chamber and the top of the top chamber by providing a communication of the water free zone on top of said bottom chamber and on top of the top chamber.<br>
In particular, it is essential that the purification unit comprising said top and bottom chambers are maintained in sealed conditions such that the air pressure maintained on top of the top chamber enables gravity feed of the water from the top chamber to the bottom chamber and finally through the dispenser. Preferably, in order to make the system online and at the same time maintain the required air tight conditions for the purification unit it is possible that a locking means is provided on top of the top chamber to achieve locking of the top chamber from the bottom chamber as and when the top chamber is required to be maintained in communication with a water supply source. This would enable on one hand filling of the top chamber online and at the same time carry on dispensing of the purified water through the dispenser in communication with the bottom chamber containing the purified water.<br>
The filtration /purification means can be any conventional filtration/purifying unit, and preferably can be the conventional filter cartridge. Such filter cartridge can preferably have the constitution detailed hereunder and adopted to be fitted in said top chamber such as to allow the water from the top chamber to flow there to the cartridge to attend purity and further onto the lower chamber for subsequent discharge to the discharge unit.<br>
The details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained hereunder in greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary illustration of the filter means in accordance with the present invention as per accompanying Figure 1.<br>
5<br><br>
As illustrated in said figure, the system basically comprises of the purification unit having a top chamber (TC) and the bottom chamber (BC) which are maintained in air tight sealed conditions. The filtration/purification means comprise of a pre-filter (PF) and a cartridge (CR). To maintain equal pressure between the top of the bottom chamber and the top of the top chamber there is provided the pressure equalising device/valve (PV). The purification unit detailed above is installed on top of the dispenser (DP) and is maintained in operative communication with a dispenser via a central opening in said bottom chamber which further extends in the form of nozzle (NZ) into the dispenser top. The dispenser is provided with an outlet means (OT) through which regulated supply of the purified water can be achieved.<br>
The operation of the system is detailed as hereunder:<br>
The top chamber of the purification unit is first filled with water and then maintained in the sealed conditions. Thereafter, the water is subjected to purification by passage through pre-filter (PF) and cartridge (CR) to be collected in the bottom chamber (BC). As and when the bottom chamber is filled, the purified water therefrom passes through the nozzle (NZ) and accumulates in the dispenser (DP). The collection of the purified water in the dispenser provides for ready discharge of purified water for consumption as and when required. The outlet means (OT) which can be in the form of a tap, can be opened for possible dispensing off the purified water through the system. Importantly, since the dispenser is initially filled with air, as and when the water level in the dispenser is below the nozzle edge, air from the dispenser top bubbles through the water in the bottom chamber (BC) and reaches the top of the bottom chamber to pressurise the contents of the bottom chamber for further release of purified water into the dispenser and thereby maintain the level of the water in the dispenser.<br>
In order to effectuate the flow of water from the top chamber into the bottom chamber any difference in pressure in the top chamber and the bottom chamber is equalised by the passage of air from the bottom chamber to the top of the top chamber thereby maintaining the flow of the water from said top chamber to the bottom chamber.<br>
It would be well apparent that the system as above which is basically a gravity feed-fed mechanism and can achieve filtration at site through effective filtration unit such as<br>
