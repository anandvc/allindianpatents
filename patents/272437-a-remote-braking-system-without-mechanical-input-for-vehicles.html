PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner<br>
in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a braking system used for stopping a running vehicle and more particularly it relates to an emergency remote braking system used for stopping a running vehicle during a crash test to abort the test in case of emergency.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
In an unmanned vehicle, remote braking system is used for stopping the running vehicle in case of an emergency such as vehicle going off the track during a crash test to avoid accidents. Besides ensuring safety of the test, this system is useful in aborting the test when the test set up and / or vehicle is not functioning as intended. This saves the possibility of a costly destructive test being wasted.<br>
Generally piston cylinder arrangement is provided to operate the vehicle brake pedal for stopping the running vehicle. The said cylinder is mounted inside the vehicle and is actuated by pneumatic or hydraulic power. However, the said arrangement is not preferable in a crash test as the said cylinder affects the performance of the internal structure of cabin and brake pedal displacements in a crash test. Further in the case of crash test being conducted with crash test dummies and instrumentation, such arrangement is not feasible due to space constraints.<br>
Another method of the emergency braking consists of an on board auxiliary braking system which operates the vehicle hydraulic brake circuit to stop the running vehicle. However this system is not preferable as it consumes additional space, and it is heavy and it requires an additional process of brake bleeding.<br><br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an emergency remote braking system for vehicles.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an emergency remote braking system for vehicles which actuate braking system without affecting the vehicle structural performance.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an emergency remote braking system for vehicles which can be installed even if the vehicle is equipped with crash test dummy and instrumentation.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an emergency remote braking system for vehicles which is lighter in weight and easy to install.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an emergency remote braking system for vehicles which doesn't require the process of brake bleeding.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
Figure-01 shows the remote braking system in accordance with the present invention. Figure-02 shows the brake booster of remote braking system in accordance with the present invention.<br><br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only, and not for the purpose of limiting the same.<br>
Now referring to figure-01, in accordance with this invention, an emergency remote braking system for vehicles comprises; an auxiliary air reservoir (1) for compressed air, a pneumatic direction control valve (2) for directing the compressed air, an electric relay (3) for controlling actuation of direction control valve , an auxiliary electric battery (4) for providing electric power for actuation of said direction control valve (2), first pneumatic hose (5) for supplying compressed air to said direction control valve (2), brake booster (7) for actuating vehicle brake system, second pneumatic hose (6) for supplying the compressed air to the said brake booster (7), wherein said auxiliary air reservoir is connected to said pneumatic direction control valve through the said first pneumatic hose, said pneumatic direction control valve is connected to said brake booster through second pneumatic hose &gt; said electric relay is connected to said pneumatic direction control valve and said auxiliary electric battery and a remote switch such that when remote switch is actuated said pneumatic direction control valve gets actuated through said electric relay releasing the compressed air from said air reservoir to said brake booster to actuate the master cylinder thereby activating the vehicle braking system.<br>
The said brake booster is a part of the test vehicle braking system modified to suit the invention.<br>
The original vehicle batter}' can also be used in place of the auxiliary battery if it is possible to use in order to avoid additional weight to the vehicle.<br><br><br>
The said compressed air reservoir (1) is connected to the said pneumatic direction control valve (2) with said first pneumatic hose (5). The said pneumatic direction control valve (2) is connected to the said brake booster (7) by the said second pneumatic hose (6).<br>
 The said pneumatic direction control valve (2) is actuated by an electric battery (4) through an electric relay (3) by a remote switch (8). This braking system, except the said remote switch, is fitted on the vehicle.<br>
Now referring to figure-02, The said brake booster is modified, to suit the invention. The said brake booster (7) is provided with a nipple (9) on non-vacuum side to suit connection of another end of the said second pneumatic hose (6).<br>
The said brake booster (7) comprises; inner cover (15), valve cylinder body (11) to house the valve and diaphragm (12) for displacing the said valve body on account of differential pressure across it, said valve cylinder body (11) comprises port (10) which is configured to be blocked for preventing airflow across the said diaphragm. The said valve cylinder body and inner cover are configured to be sealed to prevent air leakages. The said brake booster (7) comprises vacuum port (13) adapted to be open to atmosphere. That is, it is disconnected from the vehicle vacuum circuit.<br>
When the vehicle has to be stopped, the operator actuates the said emergency remote switch (8) which actuates the said pneumatic direction control valve (2) through said electric relay (3). Actuation of the "said pneumatic direction control valve (2) releases the compressed air from the said air reservoir (1) to the said brake booster (7)<br>
through said second pneumatic hose (6). On receipt of the compressed air, the brake<br><br>
booster diaphragm (12) actuates the master cylinder (14) to actuate the vehicle braking system. It should be noted that the diaphragm is in pneumatic and/or spring-<br><br><br>
loaded connection with said master cylinder. Thus the vehicle brakes are applied on actuation of the remote switch. The said emergency remote braking system of vehicle is electrically operated.<br>
The foregoing description is a specific embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated that this embodiment is described for purpose of illustration only, and that numerous alterations and modifications may be practiced by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations be included insofar as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or the equivalents thereof.<br><br><br>
