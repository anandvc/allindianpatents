RETINAL DERIVATIVES AND METHODS FOR THE USE THEREOF FOR THE TREATMENT OF VISUAL DISORDERS<br>
CONTINUITY<br>
[0001]    This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/580,889, filed June 18, 2004, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.<br>
STATEMENT AS TO RIGHTS TO INVENTIONS MADE UNDER<br>
FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT [0002]    This research was supported by United States Public Health Service Grants EY09339 from the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health. The Government has certain rights in the invention.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]    A diminished visual acuity or total loss of vision may result from a number of eye diseases or disorders caused by dysfunction of tissues or structures in the anterior segment of the eye and/or posterior segment of the eye. Disease or disorders of the posterior segment of the eye in general are retinal or choroidal vascular diseases or hereditary diseases such as Leber Congenital Amaurosis. Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the specific diseases associated with the posterior portion of the eyeball and is the leading cause of blindness among older people. AMD results in damage to the macula, a small circular area in the center of the retina. Because the macula is the area which enables one to discern small details and to read or drive, its deterioration may bring about diminished visual acuity and even blindness. The retina contains two forms of light receiving cells, rods and cones, that change light into electrical signals. The brain then converts these signals into the images. The macula is rich in cone cells, which provides central vision. People with AMD suffer deterioration of central vision but usually retain peripheral sight.<br>
[0004]    Slightly blurred or distorted vision is the most common early symptom of AMD. Visual loss with dry AMD usually progresses slowly while visual loss with wet AMD<br><br>
proceeds more rapidly and may occur over days or weeks. Patients who have wet AMD in one eye are at increased risk of developing choroidal neo-vascularization (CNV) in the other eye. The magnitude of the risk varies, depending on the appearance of the second eye. The risk is greater in eyes with numerous large drusen, with abnormal pigment changes in the macula, and in patients with a history of high blood pressure. Reactions that go on in the RPE lead to oxidative products leading to cell death and neovascularization. This excess metabolism leads to the formation of drusen under the RPE.<br>
[0005]    Other eye diseases also affect photoreceptor function in the eye. Retinitis Pigmentosa represents disease caused by defects in many different genes. They all have a final common pathway of night blindness and peripheral vision loss that can lead to narrowing of the visual field and eventual loss of all vision in many patients. The rod photoreceptors are usually primarily affected and most of the gene defects leading to the disease occur in genes that are expressed predominantly or only in the rod cells.<br>
[0006]    One autosomal dominant form of Retinitis Pigmentosa comprises an amino acid substitution in opsin, a proline to histidine substitution at amino acid 23. This defect compromises 10-20% of all Retinitis Pigmentosa cases. This abnormal opsin protein forms a protein aggregate that eventually leads to cell death.<br>
[0007]    Leber Congenital Amaurosis is a very rare childhood condition that affects children from birth or shortly thereafter. It affects both rods and cones. There are a few different gene defects that have been associated with the disease. These include the genes encoding the RPE65 and LRAT proteins. Both result in a person's inability to make 11-cis-retinal in adequate quantities. In the RPÂ£6S-defective individuals, retinyl esters build up in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). LRAT-defective individuals are unable to make esters and subsequently secrete any excess retinoids.<br>
[0008]    Retinitis Punctata Albesciens is another form of Retinitis Pigmentosa that exhibits a shortage of 11-cw-retinal in the rods. Aging also leads to the decrease in night vision and loss of contrast sensitivity due to a shorting of 11-cis-retinal. Excess unbound opsin is believed to randomly excite the visual transduction system. This can create noise in the system, and thus more light and more contrast is necessary to see well.<br><br>
[00091    Congenital Stationary Night Blindness (CSNB) and Fundus Albipunctatus are a group of diseases that are manifested as night blindness, but there is not a progressive loss of vision as in the Retinitis Pigmentosa. Some forms of CSNB are due to a delay in the recycling of 11-cw-retinal. Fundus Albipunctatus until recently was thought to be a special case of CSNB where the retinal appearance is abnormal with hundreds of small white dots appearing in the retina. It has been shown recently that this is also a progressive disease although much slower than Retinitis Pigmentosa. It is caused by a gene defect that leads to a delay in the cycling of 11 -cis-retinal.<br>
[0010]    Currently, there are few treatments for retinoid deficiency. One treatment, a combination of antioxidant vitamins and zinc, produces only a small restorative effect. Thus, there is a need for compositions and methods of restoring or stabilizing photoreceptor function and ameliorating the effects of deficient levels of endogenous retinoids.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0053]    The present invention provides synthetical retinal derivatives and methods of using such derivatives to restore or stabilize photoreceptor function in a vertebrate visual system. The synthetic retinal derivative is a derivative of 9-cis-retinal or 11-cis-retinal in which the aldehydic group in the polyene chain is modified. The synthetic retinal derivative can be converted directly or indirectly into a retinal or a synthetic retinal analog. Thus, in some aspects, the compounds according to the present invention can be described as a pro-drug, which upon metabolic transformation is converted into 9-cis-retinal, 11-cis-retinal or a synthetic retinal analog thereof. Metabolic transformation can occur, for example by acid hydrolysis, esterase activity, acetyltransferase activity, dehydrogenase activity, or the like.<br>
[0054]    The synthetic retinal derivative can be a retinoid replacement, supplementing the levels of endogenous retinoid. In some embodiments, the synthetic retinal can bind to opsin, and function as an opsin agonist. As used herein, the term "agonist" refers to a synthetic retinal that binds to opsin and facilitates the ability of an opsin/synthetic retinal complex to respond to light. As an opsin agonist, a synthetic retinal can spare the requirement for endogenous retinoid (e.g., 11 -cis-retinal). A synthetic retinal also can restore or improve function (e.g., photoreception) to opsin by binding to opsin and forming a functional opsin/synthetic retinal complex, whereby the opsin/synthetic retinal complex can respond to photons when part of a rod or cone membrane.<br><br>
[0055]    Synthetic retinal derivatives can be administered to restore or stabilize photoreceptor function, and/or to ameliorate the effects of a deficiency in retinoid levels. Photoreceptor function can be restored or stabilized, for example, by providing a synthetic retinal derivative as an 11-cis-retinoid replacement and/or an opsin agonist. The synthetic retinal derivative also can ameliorate the effects of a retinoid deficiency on a vertebrate visual system. The synthetic retinal derivative can be administered prophylactically or therapeutically to a vertebrate. Suitable vertebrates include, for example, human and non-human vertebrates. Suitable non-human vertebrates include, for example, mammals, such as dogs (canine), cats (feline), horses (equine) and other domesticated animals.<br>
[0056J    In one aspect, synthetic retinal derivatives are provided. The synthetic retinal derivatives are derivatives of 9-cis-retinal or 11-cis-retinal in which the aldehydic group in the polyene chain is converted to an ester, ether, alcohol, hemi-acetal, acetal, oxime, as further described herein. Such synthetic retinal derivatives include 9-cis-retinyl esters, 9-cis-retinyl ethers, 9-cis-retinol, 9-cis-retinal oximes, 9-cis-retinyl acetal s, 9-cis-retinyl hemiacetals, 11-cis-retinyl esters, 11-cis-retinyl ethers, 11-cis-retinol, 11-cis-retinyl oximes, 11-cis-retinyl acetals and 11-cis-retinyl hemiacetals, as further described herein. The synthetic retinal derivative can be metabolized to release a natural or synthetic retinal, such as for example, 9-cis-retinal, 11-cis-retinal or a synthetic retinal analog thereof, such as those described herein or in co-pending International Application No. PCT/US04/07937, filed March 15,2004, (Attorney Docket No. 016336-00201OPC) (the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein).<br>
[0057]    In one aspect, the synthetic retinal derivative is a retinyl ester. In some embodiments, the retinyl ester is a 9-cis-retinyl ester or an 11-cis-retinyl ester having a. The ester substituent can be, for example, a carboxylic acid, such as a mono- or polycarboxylic acid. As used herein, a "polycarboxylic acid" is a di-, tri- or higher order carboxylic acid. In some embodiments, the carboxylic acid is a C|-C22, C2-C22, â¬3-022, Ci-Cio, Ci-Cio, Cj-Cio, C4-Cio, C4-Cg, CU-Q or CU monocarboxylic acid, or polycarboxylic acid.<br>

In another exemplary embodiment, the retinyl ester is a 9-cis-retinyl ester or an 11-cis-retinyl ester including a â¬3-022 di-carboxylic acid (di-acid) substituent. In some embodiments, the polycarboxylic acid is not 9-cis-retinyl tartarate or 11 -cis-retinyl tartarate. In some embodiments, the retinyl ester is not a naturally occurring retinyl ester normally found in the eye. In some embodiments, the retinyl ester is an isolated retinyl ester. As used herein, "isolated" refers to a molecule that exists apart from its native environment and is therefore not a product of nature. An isolated molecule may exist in a purified form or may exist in a non-native environment.<br>

|UU88]    Retinyl esters can be formed by methods known in the art such as, for example, by acid-catalyzed esterification of a retinol with a carboxylic acid, by reaction of an acyl halide with a retinol, by transesterification of a retinyl ester with a carboxylic acid, by reaction of a primary halide with a carboxylate salt of a retinoic acid, by acid-catalyzed reaction of an anhydride with a retinol, or the like. In an example, retinyl esters can be formed by acid-catalyzed esterification of a retinol with a carboxyhc acia, sucn as,<br>
acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, caproic acid, caprylic acid, pelargonic acid, capric acid, lauric acid, oleic acid, stearatic acid, palmitic acid, myristic acid, linoleic acid, succmic acid, fumaric acid or the like. In another example, retinyl esters can be formed by reaction of an acyl halide with a retinol (see, e.g., Van Hooser et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 97:8623-28 (2000)). Suitable acyl halides include, for example, acetyl chloride, palmitoyl chloride, or the like.<br>
[0089]    Retinyl ethers can be formed by methods known in the art, such as for example, reaction of a retinol with a primary alkyl halide.<br>
[0090]    Traws-retinoids can be isomerized to cis-retinoids by exposure to UV light. For example, all-fra/w-retinal, all-frans-retinol, all-frans-retinyl ester or alWraws-retinoic acid can be isomerized to 9-cis-retinal, 9-cis-retinol, 9-cis-retinyl ester or 9-cis -retinoic acid, respectively. fra/is-Retinoids can be isomerized to 9-cis-retinoids by, for example, exposure to a UV light having a wavelength of about 365 run, and substantially free of shorter wavelengths that cause degradation of cis-retinoids, as further described herein.<br>
[0091]    Retinyl acetals and hemiacetals can be prepared, for example, by treatment of 9-cis- and 1 \-cis- retinals with alcohols in the presence of acid catalysts. Water formed during reaction is removed, for example by AlaOs of a molecular sieve.<br>
10092]    Retinyl oximes can be prepared, for example, by reaction of a retinal with hydroxylamine, O-methyl- or O-ethylhydroxyl amine, or the like.<br>
[0093]    For a specific opsin protein, a suitable synthetic retinal derivatives can be identified, for example, by an expression system expressing the opsin protein. Suitable animal models include, for example, RPE65-I- or LRAT -/- mice (see, e.g., Van Hooser et al.,J.Biol. Chem. 277:19173-82(2002); Baehref al., VisionRes. 43:2957-58 (2003); Batten et al., J. Biol. Chem. 279:10422-32 (2004); Kuksa et al., Vision Res. 43:2959-81 (2003); Thompson etal.,Dev. Ophthalmol. 37:141-54(2003)). Other suitable non-human animal models further include other mouse, rat or primate systems. Such animal models can be prepared, for example, by promoting homologous recombination between a nucleic acid encoding an opsin in its chromosome and an exogenous nucleic acid encoding a mutant opsin. In one aspect, homologous recombination is carried out by transforming embryo-derived stem (ES) cells with a vector containing an opsin gene, such that homologous recombination occurs, followed by injecting the ES cells into a blastocyst,<br>
and implanting the blastocyst into a foster mother, followed by the birth of the chimeric animal (see, e.g., Capecchi, Science 244:1288-92 (1989)). The chimeric animal can be bred to produce additional transgenic animals.<br>
[0094]    Suitable expression systems also can include, for example, in vitro or in vivo systems. Suitable in vitro systems include for example, coupled transcription-translation systems. Suitable in vivo systems include, for example, cells expressing an opsin protein. For example, cells of a vertebrate visual system can be adapted for culture in vitro, or recombinant cell lines expressing an opsin protein can be used. The cell lines are typically stable cell lines expressing the opsin protein. A synthetic retinal or synthetic retinal derivative can be added to the cell culture media, and the cells cultured for a suitable period of time to allow the production of opsin/rhodopsin. Opsin and/or rhodopsin can be isolated (e.g., by immunoaffinity). Isolated protein samples are examined to determine the amount of pigment formed, and absorbance maxima. Methods of introducing nucleic acids into vertebrate cells are disclosed in, for example, Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 2001).<br>
|0095)    Recombinant cell lines expressing opsin protein can be prepared by, for example, introducing an expression construct encoding an opsin protein into a suitable cell line. The expression construct typically includes a promoter operably linked to a nucleic acid encoding an opsin protein, and optionally a termination signal(s). Nucleic acids encoding opsin can be obtained, for example, by using information from a database (e.g., a genomic or cDNA library), by polymerase chain reaction, or the like. For example opsin-encoding nucleic acids can be obtained by hybridization. (See generally Sambrook et al (supra).) An opsin encoding nucleic acid can be obtained by hybridization under conditions of low, medium or high stringency.<br>
[0096]    Opsin-encoding nucleic acids can be obtained under conditions of high stringency hybridization. By way of example, and not limitation, procedures using conditions of high stringency are as follows: Prehybridization of filters containing DNA is carried out for 8 hours to overnight at 65Â°C in buffer composed of 6x SSC, 50 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% PVP, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% BSA, and 500 jigfai] denatured salmon sperm DNA. Filters are hybridized for 48 hours at 65Â°C in prehybridization mixture containing 100 ug/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA and 5-20 x<br>
106 cpm of 32P-labeled probe. Washing of filters is done at 65Â°C for 1 hour in a solution containing 2x SSC, 0.01% PVP, 0.01% Ficoll, and 0.01% BSA. This is followed by a wash in 0.1 x SSC at 50Â°C for 45 minutes before autoradiography. Other conditions of high stringency which can be used are well known in the art. (See generally Sambrook et al. (supra).)<br>
|0097)    The expression construct can optionally include one or more origins of replication and/or selectable markers) (e.g., an antibiotic resistance gene). Suitable selectable markers include, for example, those conferring resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, neomycin, G418, and the like. Suitable cell lines include, for example, HEK293 cells, T-RExâ¢-293 cells, CHO cells and other cells or cell lines.<br>
[0098]    The UV-visible spectra of rhodopsin (comprising opsin and a synthetic retinal) can be monitored to determine whether the synthetic retinal has formed a Schiff s base with the opsin protein. For example, acid-denatured, purified protein can be analyzed to determine whether an absorbance maxima of approximately 490 run is present, providing evidence that the synthetic retinal derivative forms a Schiff s base with the opsin protein. Hydroxylamine treatment can be used to confirm the Schiff s base is sequestered from the external environment.<br>
(99)	Suitable synthetic retinal derivatives also can be selected by molecular modeling<br>
of rhodopsin. The coordinates for rhodopsin crystal structure are available from the<br>
Protein Data Bank (IHZX) (Teller et al., Biochemistry 40:7761-72 (2001)). The effects of<br>
amino acid substitutions on the structure of rhodopsin, and on the contacts between opsin<br>
and 11-cis-retinal. or a synthetic retinal, can be determined by molecular modeling.<br>
(100)	The coordinates for the rhodopsin crystal structure from the Protein Data Bank<br>
(IHZX) (Teller et al., Biochemistry 40:7761-72 (2001)) can be used to generate a<br>
computer model. The addition of hydrogen atoms and optimization can be done, for<br>
example, using Insight II (Insightll release 2000, Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA).<br>
Crystallographic water can be removed, and water molecules introduced based on the<br>
accessible space in the extracellular region. Typically, no minimization is performed<br>
before water is added. A water layer (e.g., 5 A thick) can be used to coat the extracellular<br>
part of rhodopsin as well as residues in contact with polar phospholipids heads. All of the<br>
water molecules can be allowed to move freely, as is the extracellular half of rhodopsin,<br>
with retinal. If no water cap is put on the cytoplasmic part of rhodopsin, this part of the molecule can be frozen to prevent degradation of the model.<br>
f 01011    A water cap can be put on the extracellular part of rhodopsin (together with that part buried in membrane in contact with polar heads of phospholipids). Water and the extracellular part of rhodopsin can be allowed to move and the movement modeled at any suitable frequency. For example, the movement of the modeled rhodopsin can be modeling at 100 ps simulations.<br>
|0102|    Synthetic retinals can be contacted with an opsin protein under conditions suitable and for a period of time sufficient for the formation of an opsin protein/synthetic retinal complex. The stability of the opsin/synthetic retinal complex can be determined by methods described herein or as known to the skilled artisan. The opsin in the opsin/synthetic retinal complex is stabilized when it exhibits increased stability (e.g., increased half-life when bound to the synthetic retinal as compared with free opsin (i.e., not bound to retinoid), is less sensitive to hydroxylamine, exhibits less accumulation in aggresomes, or the like).<br>
[0103J    The synthetic retinal can be contacted with the opsin protein in vitro or in vivo. For example, the opsin protein can be synthesized in an in vitro translation system (e.g., a wheat germ or reticulocyte lysate expression system) and the synthetic retinal added to the expression system. The opsin protein can be contacted with the opsin protein ex vivo, and then the complex can be administered to a vertebrate eye.<br>
[0104|    In another aspect, methods of using a synthetic retinal derivative are provided to restore or stabilize photoreceptor function, or to ameliorate photoreceptor loss, in a vertebrate visual system. A synthetic retinal derivative can be administered to a vertebrate eye(s) having a retinoid deficiency (e.g., a deficiency of 11-cis-retinal), an excess of free opsin, an excess of retinoid waste (e.g., degradation) products or intermediates in the recycling of all-fra/w-retinal, or the like. The vertebrate eye typically comprises a wild-type opsin protein. Methods of determining endogenous retinoid levels in a vertebrate eye, and a deficiency of such retinoids, are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/538,051 (filed Feb. 12,2004) (the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein). Other methods of determining endogenous retinoid levels in a vertebrate eye, and a deficiency of such retinoids, include for example, analysis 'â¢v hieh pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) of retinoids in a sample from a subject.<br>
For example, retinoid levels or a deficiency in such levels can be determined from a blood sample from a subject.<br>
(01 OS]    A blood sample can be obtained from a subject and retinoid types and levels in the sample can be separated and analyzed by normal phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) (e.g., with a HP1100 HPLC and a Beckman, Ultrasphere-Si, 4.6 mm x 250 mm column using 10% ethyl acetate/90% hexane at a flow rate of 1.4 ml/minute). The retinoids can be detected by, for example, detection at 325 nm using a diode-array detector and HP Chemstation A.03.03 software. A deficiency in retinoids can be determined, for example, by comparison of the profile of retinoids in the sample with a sample from a control subject (e.g., a normal subject).<br>
[0106|    As used herein, absent, deficient or depleted levels of endogenous retinoid, such as 1 l-cis-retinal, refer to levels of endogenous retinoid lower than those found in a healthy eye of a vertebrate of the same species. A synthetic retinal derivative can spare the requirement for endogenous retinoid.<br>
f01071    As used herein, "prophylactic" and "prophylactically" refer to the administration of a synthetic retinal derivative to prevent deterioration or further deterioration of the vertebrate visual system, as compared with a comparable vertebrate visual system not receiving the synthetic retinal derivative. The term "restore" refers to a long-term (e.g., as measured in weeks or months) improvement in photoreceptor function in a vertebrate visual system, as compared with a comparable vertebrate visual system not receiving the synthetic retinal derivative. The term "stabilize" refers to minimization of additional degradation in a vertebrate visual system, as compared with a comparable vertebrate visual system not receiving the synthetic retinal derivative.<br>
[0108]    In one aspect, the vertebrate eye is characterized as having Leber Congenital Amaurosis ("LCA"). This disease is a very rare childhood condition that effects children from birth or shortly there after. It affects both rods and cones in the eye. For example, certain mutations in the genes encoding RPE65 and LRAT proteins are involved in LCA. Mutations in both genes result in a person's inability to make 11-c/s-retinal in adequate quantities. Thus, 11 -cis-retinal is either absent or present in reduced quantities. In RPE65-defective individuals, retinyl esters build up in the RPE. LRAT-defective individuals are unable to make esters and subsequently secrete any excess retinoids. For<br>
LCA, a synthetic retinal derivative can be used to replace the absent or depleted 11 -cis-retinal.<br>
(0109]    In another aspect, the vertebrate eye is characterized as having Retinitis Punctata Albesciens. This disease is a form of Retinitis Pigmentosa that exhibits a shortage of 11 -cu-retinal in the rods. A synthetic retinal derivative can be used to replace the absent or depleted 11-cis retinal.<br>
[0110]    In another aspect, the vertebrate eye is characterized as having Congenital Stationary Night Blindness ("CSNB") or Fundus Albipunctatus. This group of diseases is manifested by night blindness, but there is not a progressive loss of vision as in the Retinitis Pigmentosa. Some forms of CSNB are due to a delay in the recycling of 11 -cis-retinal. Fundus Albipunctatus until recently was thought to be a special case of CSNB where the retinal appearance is abnormal with hundreds of small white dots appearing in the retina. It has been shown recently that this is also a progressive disease, although with a much slower progression than Retinitis Pigmentosa. It is caused by a gene defect that leads to a delay in the cycling of 11-cis-retinal. Thus, a synthetic retinal derivative(s) can be administered to restore onotorecentor runcnon ov reunoio reu;_...<br>
(0111]    In yet another aspect, the vertebrate eye is characterized as having age-related macular degeneration ("AMD"). AMD can be wet or dry forms. In AMD, vision loss occurs when complications late in the disease either cause new blood vessels to grow under the retina or the retina atrophies. Without intending to be bound by any particular theory, excessive production of waste products from the photoreceptors may overload the RPE. This is due to a shortfall of 11 -cis-retinal available to bind opsin. Free opsin is not a stable compound and can spontaneously cause firing of the biochemical reactions of the visual cascade without the addition of light.<br>
(0112]    Administration of a synthetic retinal derivative to the vertebrate eye can reduce the deficiency of 11-cis-retinal and quench spontaneous misfiring of the opsin. Administration of a synthetic retinal derivative can lessen the production of waste products and/or lessen drusen formation, and reduce or slow vision loss (e.g., choroidal neovascularization and/or chorioretinal atrophy).<br>
[0113]    In yet other aspects, a synthetic retinal derivative is administered to an aging subject, such as a human. As used herein, an aging human subject is typically at least 45,<br><br>
or at least 50, or at least 60, or at least 65 years old. The subject has an aging eye, which is characterized as having a decrease in night vision and/or contrast sensitivity. Excess unbound opsin randomly excites the visual transduction system. This creates noise in the system and thus more light and more contrast are necessary to see well. Quenching these free opsin molecules with a synthetic retinal will reduce spontaneous misfiring and increase the signal to noise ratio, thereby improving night vision and contrast sensitivity.<br>
[0114]    Synthetic retinal derivatives can be administered to human or other non-human vertebrates. The synthetic retinal derivative can be substantially pure, in that it contains less than about 5% or less than about l%,or less than about 0.1%, of other retinoids. A combination of synthetic retinal derivatives can be administered.<br>
[0115[    Synthetic retinal derivatives can be aenverea to tne eye oy any sunaoie rrÂ»	,<br>
including, for example, oral, intravenous, intramuscular or local administration. Modes of local administration can include, for example, eye drops, intraocular injection or periocular injection. Periocular injection typically involves injection of the synthetic retinal derivative into the conjunctiva or to the tennon (the fibrous tissue overlying the eye). Intraocular injection typically involves injection of the synthetic retinal derivative into the vitreous. The administration can be non-invasive, such as by eye drops or oral dosage form.<br>
[0116]    Synthetic retinal derivatives can be formulated, for example, as pharmaceutical compositions for local administration to the eye and/or for intravenous, intramuscular or oral administration. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is not a topical formulation. In other embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is not a cosmetic formulation.<br>
[0117]    Synthetic retinal derivatives can be formulated for administration using pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles as well as techniques routinely used in the art. A vehicle can be selected according to the solubility of the synthetic retinal derivative. Suitable pharmaceutical compositions include those that are administrable locally to the eye, such as by eye drops, injection or the like. In the case of eye drops, the formulation can also optionally include, for example, ophthalmologically compatible agents such as isotonizing agents such as sodium chloride, concentrated glycerin, and the like; buffering agents such as sodium phosphate, sodium acetate, and the like; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono-oleate (also referred to as Polysorbate 80), polyoxyl<br><br>
stearate 40, polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil, and the like; stabilization agents such as sodium citrate, sodium edentate, and the like; preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride, parabens, and the like; and other ingredients. Preservatives can be employed, for example, at a level of from about 0.001 to about 1.0% weight/volume. The pH of the formulation is usually within the range acceptable to ophthalmologic formulations, such as within the range of about pH 4 to 8.<br>
(0118]    Suitable pharmaceutical compositions also include those formulated for injection. For example, the synthetic retinal derivative can be provided in an injection grade saline solution, in the form of an injectable liposome solution, or other carriers or vehicles. Intraocular and periocular injections are known to those skilled in the art and are described in numerous publications including, for example, Ophthalmic Surgery: Principles of Practice, Ed., G. L. Spaeth, W. B. Sanders Co., Philadelphia, Pa., U.S./.., pages 85-87 (1990).<br>
[0119]    A synthetic retinal derivative also can be administered in a time release formulation, for example in a composition which includes a slow release polymer. The synthetic retinal derivative can be prepared with a carriers) that will protect the compound against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, polylactic acid and polylactic, polyglycolic copolymers (PLG). Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
[0120]    Suitable oral dosage forms include, for example, tablets, pills, sachets, or capsules of hard or soft gelatin, methylcellulose or of another suitable material easily dissolved in the digestive tract. Suitable nontoxic solid carriers can be used which include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, talcum, cellulose, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, ana the like. (See, e.g., Remington "PharmaceuticalSciences", 17 Ed., Gennaro (ed.), Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pennsylvania (1985).)<br>
[0121]    The doses of the synthetic retinal derivatives can be suitably selected depending on the clinical status, condition and age of the subject, dosage form and the like. In the case of eye drops, a synthetic retinal derivative can be administered, for example, from about 0.01 mg, about 0.1 mg, or about 1 mg, to about 25 mg, to about 50 mg, or to about<br><br>
90 mg per single dose. Eye drops can be administered one or more times per day, as needed. In the case of injections, suitable doses can be, for example, about 0.0001 mg, about 0.001 mg, about 0.01 mg, or about 0.1 mg to about 10 mg, to about 25 mg, to about 50 mg, or to about 500 mg of the synthetic retinal derivative, one to four times per week. In other embodiments, about 1.0 to about 300 mg of synthetic retinal derivative can be administered one to three to five times per week.<br>
[0122]    Oral doses can typically range from about 1.0 to about 1000 mg, one to four times, or more, per day. An exemplary dosing range for oral administration is from about 10 to about 250 mg one to three times per day.<br>
[0123]    The following examples are provided merely as illustrative of various aspects of the invention and shall not be construed to limit the invention in any way.<br>
EXAMPLES [0124]    Example!:<br>
[0125]    9-cis-retinyl ester restores visual pigment in an LCA mouse model. LRAT-/-mice were gavaged with all-frans-retinyl palmitate, all-frans-retinyl acetate or 9-cis-retinyl acetate as indicated in the legend to Figure 1. Following treatment, retinoids were extracted from the eye and liver, and analyzed by HPLC. As shown in Figure 1 left, treatment of mice only with 9-cis-retinyl acetate, but not with all-fraÂ«s-retinyl analogs restored the presence of 5yn-9-cis-retinal oxime, indicating formation of the chromophore and restoration vision in these mice. No significant retention of retinoids was observed in liver, where LRAT is highly expressed, indicating low or no toxicity by retinoids in this animal model of human LCA. 9-ci$-retinyl ester restores visual pigment in approximately 5 hr (Figure 2), while excess of retinoid is removed and metabolized (as illustrated for 9-cis-retinol).<br>

[0128]    Methods<br>
[0129]    Solutions of all-frans-retinoids are made to concentrations of 1 mg/mL in methanol. The solutions are added to a glass petri dish and subjected to 365 nm UV light using a Bio-Rad GS Genelinker with the stock bulbs replaced with 8 watt F8T5 bulbs, for varying lengths of time dependent on the target retinoid. This wavelength is beneficial, as shorter wave length light quickly destroys retinoids. Following UV-treatment, the solutions are dried down, dissolved in hexane, and purified using normal phase HPLC. Conversion yields vary for each all-trans derivative. Nonisomerized all-trans derivatives, or 13-cis and 1 \-cis derivatives can be reused in subsequent repetitions, thereby increasing yields.<br>

[0135J    Levels of 9-c/s-RAL oximes (measured as syn- and anti-9-cis-retinyl aldehyde) in the eyes of LraW- mice after a single dose or multiple doses of 9-c/s-retinyl-acetate (9-cis-R-Ac). Doses of 9-cw-R-Ac were administered to Lrat-/- mice by oral gavage in vegetable oil (100% canola oil) in a volume of 500 ul (2.5 mg/ml). The mice weighed about 30-50 g. After 3 days, 9-m-RAL oximes levels were determined by HPLC. Briefly, all experimental procedures related to extraction, derivatization, and separation of retinoids from dissected mouse eyes were carried out as described previously. See Van Hooser et al., J. Biol. Chem. 277:19173-182 (2002); Van Hooser et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:8623-28 (2000); Maeda et al., J. Neurochem. 85:944-56 (2003). All reactions involving retinoids were carried out under dim red light.<br>
[0136]    Referring to Figure 5a, the level of 9-ds-RAL in Lrat-/- in mouse eyes after a varying dose of 9-cw-R-Ac is shown. Peaks were identified by retention time and UV spectra and compared to standards. The spike around 19 min resulted from changes in the solvent composition. Retinoid analysis was performed on an HP 1100 HPLC equipped with a diode array detector and HP Chemstation (A.07.01) software, allowing identification of retinoid isomers according to their specific retention time and absorption maxima.

isocratic solvent system of 0.5% ethyl acetate in hexane (v/v) for 15 min, followed by 4% ethyl acetate in hexane for 60 min at a flow rate of 1.4 ml/min (total 80 min), with detection at 325 run allowed the partial separation of 11-cis-retinyl esters, 13-cw-retinyl esters, and all-fra/is-retinyl esters at 20Â°C.<br>
[0137|    Levels of 9-cis-RAL per eye leveled off at doses of about 4-6 nmole. Referring iu Figure 5b, the level of 9-cts-RAL in Lrat-/- mouse eyes after a varying size and number of doses of 9-cis-R-Ac is shown. Levels of 9-czs-RAL accumulated over time. Tjhe levels of 9-m-RAL increased from about 50 pinole per eye to about 600 umole per eye. The gray solid line represents a maximal level of isorhodopsin as measured by the level of 9-m-retinal oximes in Lrat-/- mouse eyes after 10 gavages; dashed gray lines indicate the standard deviations. The maximal level of isorhodopsin is comparable to the level of rhodopsin in wildrype (WT) mice<br>
[0138]    Example 4<br>
[0139]    Levels of chromophore (opsin/retinal complexes) were measured in the eyes of mice after dosing with all-franj-retinoid isoforms or 9-c/s-retinyl succinate. A\l-trans-retinyl-palmitate, all-frafis-retinyl acetate, all-/ra/ts-retinal (vitamin A aldehyde), all-trans-retinol (vitamin A), all-/rans-retinyl succinate and 9-cis-retinyl succinate were administered to Lrat-/- mice by oral gavage. Five milligrams of the retinoid isoforms or 9-cw-retinyl succinate were administered in 100% canola oil at a concentration of 40 mg/ml. After 3 days, chromophore levels (as all-/rans-retinal oximes or 9-cis-retinal oximes) were determined as described previously. See Van Hooser et ai, J. Biol. Chem. 277:19173-182 (2002); Van Hooser et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:8623-28 (2000); Maeda et al., J. Neurochem. 85:944-56 (2003). All reactions involving retinoids were carried out under dim red light.<br>
[0140]    Referring to Figure 6, the all-tarns retinoid isoforms had essentially no effect on restoration of chromophore levels. In contrast, administration of 9-cis-retinyl succinate restored chromophore levels.<br>
[0141]    Example 5<br>
[0142]    A comparison of the bioavailability of orally delivered 9-cis-retinaldehyde and 9-cis-retinyl acetate in an LRAT -/- model. 9-cw-retinaldehyde and 9-cis-retinyl acetate were administered at low (10 umoles) and high (15 nmoles) doses to LRAT-/- mice.<br>
Chroraophore levels (as 9-cis-retinal oximes) were determined as described previously. See Van Hooser et at., J. Biol. Chem. 277:19173-182 (2002); Van Hooser et at., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:8623-28 (2000); Maeda et at, J. Neurochem. 85:944-56 (2003). All reactions involving retinoids were carried out under dim red light.<br>
[0143]    Referring to Figure 7, at low and high doses, administration of 9-cis-retinyl acetate more efficiently restores chromophore levels than 9-cis-retinaldehyde. This effect is more pronounced at low (10 nmoles) doses. Because administration of retinoids can lead to toxicity, pro-drugs such as retinyl esters (e.g., 9-cis-retinyl acetate) provide a suitable bioavailable form to restore chromophore levels while reducing risk associated with retinoid toxicity.<br>
