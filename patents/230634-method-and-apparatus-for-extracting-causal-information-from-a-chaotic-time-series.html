ThQ present invention generally pertains to a method and apparatus for extracting causal information from a chaotic time series. More precisely, the present Invention pertains to a method and apparatus for analyzing the state of a first system from a time-varying signal representing a chaotic series of time intervals between quasi-periodical Â©vents produced by a second system governed by the first system. In a typical, but non-exclusive, application of the invention, the first system is the autonomous nervous system (ANS) and the second system is the cardiac system.<br>
Measures of heart rate variability (HRV) have been shown to be a powerful means of assessing the Influence of the ANS on the cardiac system. Indeed, the ANS, with its sympathetic and parasympathetic subsystems, governs involuntary actions of the cardiac muscle and every visceral organs in the body.<br>
The ANS is not directly accessible to voluntary control. Instead, it operates in an autonomic fashion on the basis of autonomic reflexes and central control. One of its major functions is the maintenance of homeostasis within the body. The AIMS further plays an adaptive role in the interaction of the organism with its surroundings.<br>
In many diseases, the sympathetic and/or parasympathetic parts of the ANS are affected leading to autonomic dysfunction. It is then important to have reliable and representative nneasures of the activity and the state of the ANS.<br>
Three main classes of methods are used to recover information about the ANS from the heart rate variability; spectral analysis (also called time domain analysis), statistics and calculation of a correlation dimension (or any related dimension). These methods do not give easy interpretable outcomes. Moreover, they lack reliability and are not mathematically appropriate in their considered application.<br><br>
The present invention aims at remedying the above-mentioned shortcomings of the prior art and proposes, to this effect, a method for analyzing the state of a first system from a time-varying signal representing a chaotic series of time Intervals between quasi-periodical events produced by a second system governed by the first system, the method comprising the steps of extracting envelope information from the time-varying signal, constructing a phase space for the time-varying signal, extracting information on the relative positions of points corresponding to the time-varying signal in the phase space, combining the envelope and the position information and, based on this combination, providing information on the state of the first system.<br>
Thus, the present invention exploits the fractal geometry of the time-varying signal and combines an envelope caiculation scheme with an evaluation of the dispersion of points in a reconstructed phase space. The present inventors have found that such a combination enables emphasizing the variations of significance in the chaotic series of time intervals while dismissing the variations of no significance, thus providing precise information on the state of the first, underlying system.<br>
A more dynamic and reactive response to a change in the state of the first system may be obtained in the invention by calculating two. envelopes for the series of time intervals, namely a first upper envelope calculated in the direction of the chronological order and a second upper envelope calculated In the direction opposite to the chronological order.<br>
The present Invention makes also possible to discriminate the sympathetic and parasympathetic components of the ANS and, by means of two different calculations defined in appended claim 16, to describe the instantaneous state of each of these components.<br>
Other advantageous features of the method according to the invention are defined in appended claims 2, 4-15 and 17.<br><br>
The present invention further concerns a computer program and an apparatus for executing the above-mentioned method, the former being defined in appended daim 18 and the latter being defined in appended claims 19-37.<br>

With reference to figure 1, a method for analyzing the state of the ANS comprises steps S1 to S13.<br>
In step SI, a first time-varying signal or data representing quasi-periodical events produced by a biological system governed by the ANS of a patient is acquired. The said biological system is, for example, the cardiac, respiratory or brain system of the patient. The first time-varying signal is a raw signal, i.e. a non-<br><br>
smoothed and non-filtered signal. Thus, all variations of this signal are kept. Including micro-variations.<br>
In step S2, the quasi-periodical events in the first time-varying signal are detected and the time intervals between these quasi-periodical events are calculated so as to form a second time-varying signal or data, called "time-interval signal", taking discrete values consisting of the series of calculated time Intervals. Such a series of time Intervals is known to be chaotic. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the time-varying signal acquired in step S1 is the electrocardiogram (ECG) of the patient and the time intervals calculated In step S2 are the RR Intervals, i.e. the intervals between the R waves of the ECG. Figure 5 shows, by way of illustration, an example of a time-Interval signal obtained in step S2 in the case of such RR intervals. Each point in the signal of figure 5 con-esponds to a calculated time interval. Such a signal Is known in the art as being fractal.<br>
In practice, step S2 is performed In real time, i.e. each time an event occurs In the first time-varying signal, this event is detected and the time interval between this event and the preceding one is calculated. In the same manner, the algorithm formed by the following steps S3 to 513 is performed each time a time interval Is calculated by step S2.<br>
In step S3 a time window W is defined. The upper limit Li of time window W is the Instant corresponding to the last time interval calculated In step S2. The lower limit U is set such that the width Li-Lo of time window W corresponds to a predetermined number N of calculated time intervals. In other words, the window W encompasses the last (current) calculated time interval and the N-1 preceding calculated time intervals. The predetermined number N corresponds to the time scale in which the state of the ANS is to be determined and visualized. This number may be selected by the user. Its default value is, for example, 40.<br>
In step S4, two convex or upper envelopes of the time-interval signal obtained in step S2 are calculated in window W.   One of these envelopes is<br><br>
calculated in the direction of the chronological (temporal) order, from the lower limit 1-0 of time window W up to the upper limit Li. The o^her one is calculated in the direction opposite to the chronological order, from the upper limit Li down to the lower limit Lo, and then reset in the chronological order. By way of general illustration, figures 2 and 3 respectively show for a given arbitrary signal SIG in window W the corresponding upper envelope Ec as calculated in the direction of the chronological order and the corresponding upper envelope Enc as calculated in the direction opposite to the chronological order. As is apparent from these figures, the two envelopes are different and thus contain different, complementary Information on the variations of the signal SIG. It is recalled that the upper envelope of a given signal f(t) is given by the following fomnula: f is) = max m.<br>
tsfss<br>
The upper envelopes as obtained in step S4 of the present invention are each in the form of a table or vector having N values, each of which corresponds to onef of the discrete values taken by the time-Interval signal. The table corresponding to the upper envelope calculated in the direction of the chronological order will be referred to in the following as ForwHull and the table corresponding to the upper envelope calculated in the direction opposite to the chronological order as RackwHull.<br>
The sequence of step S6 to S10 is performed in parallel with step S4. Step S5 consists in constructing a several-dimensional phase space for the portion of the time-interval signal in window W. The notion of phase space Is Icnown per se in the field of mathematical physics. A scheme for construction of the phase space and reasons for this construction are described, for example, in the paper entitled "Geometry from a Time Series" by Packard et al., Physical Review Letters, Volume 45, Number 9, 1 September 1980 and in the paper entitled "Predicting Chaotic Time Series" by Farmer et a!., Physical Review Letters, Volume 59, Number 8, 24 August 1987. The present Invention follows the precited scheme<br><br>
and, as such, the phase space is constructed in the following manner: from the series of values taken by the time-interval signal in window W, designated by Xi, X2, X3, .... XN from the lower limit U to the upper limit Li, vectors, e.g. three-dimensional, are constructed using a time lag or shift, e.g. of four. Thus, typically, the first vector will have as its first component the first value Xi of the time-interval signal in window W, as its second component the fifth value X5 of the time-interval signal in window W, and as its third component the ninth value Xg of the time-interval signal in window W. The second vector will have as its first component the second value X2 of the time-interval signal in window W and as its second and third components the sixth and tenth values Xe, X10 of the time-interval signal in window W, and so on. Preferably, in order to obtain a number N of such vectors, the series of vectors is completed by repeating the last complete vector as many times as necessary at the end of the series. The vectors obtained are listed below:<br><br>
Although in the preferred embodiment of the invention the dimension of the vectors, i.e. the dimension of the phase space, and the time lag are respectively equal to three and four, these dimension and time lag may be different. When such dimension and time lag are different, it is however preferable to keep their product equal to 12.<br>
The vectors obtained as described above each represent a point in the phase space. The present inventors have observed that, rather than being distributed randomly, the points of the phase space form clusters of points, each of which represents a common equilibrium state of the AIMS. As an illustration, figure 4 shows the phase space obtained during a tilt test applied to a patient, i.e. a test in which the patient is levered from a horizontal position to a quasi-vertical one (angle of 80Â°). As can be seen, this phase space includes two separate clusters of<br><br>
points CL1, CL2, Each of these clusters of points CL1, CL2 corresponds to one of the above-mentioned horizontal and quasi-vertical positions.<br>
Step S6 consists in lowering the dimension of the phase space in order to get information on the positions of the points relative to one another. Step S6 more specifically consists in orthogonally projecting the points of the phase space, i.e. the points corresponding to the above-mentioned vectors, onto a space of lower dimension on which an order relation can be established. Typically, step S6 projects the points of the phase space onto a straight line that minimizes the average distance between these points and the straight line. Such a straight line passes through the clusters of points, as shown in figure 4 at reference sign SL. It may be obtained through a conventional linear fit method, the straight line is given an orientation, which may be selected arbitrarily but preferably according to the axis of the phase space the straight line is most parallel to.<br>
Once all the points of the phase space have been projected onto the above-mentioned straight line, step 87 calculates the relative distances between the projected points while respecting the chronological order of these points. Precisely, step S7 first calculates the distance between the first point in the chronological order, I.e. the projected point corresponding to the first vector or point (Xi, X5, XQ), and the second point in the chronological order, I.e. the projected point corresponding to the second vector or point (X2, Xe, X10), then between the first point and the third point In the chronological order, then between the first point and the fourth point in the chronological order, and so on. Then step S7 calculates the distance between the second point in the chronological order and the third point In the chronological order, then between the second point and the fourth point in the chronological order, then between the second point and the fifth point In the chronological order, and so on. Then step S7 calculates the distance between the third point and the fourth point in the chronological order, then between the third point and the fifth point in the chronological order, and so on. Step S7 thus calculates N(N+1)/2 distances. Due to the orientation given to<br><br>
the projection straight line on which the points are located, these distances are either positive or negative (the value zero being considered, for example, as a positive value). All these distances are set in a table and arranged therein in the order in which they have been calculated. Such a table is representative of an average distance between the clusters of points in the several-dimension phase space.<br>
In step S8, the positive and negative distances calculated in step S7 are discriminated. More specifically, first and second tables Tine, Tdec are created including respectively the positive distances and the absolute value of the negative distances, the values in each of these tables Tine, Tdec keeping the same order as in their original table, that is the temporal order.<br>
The tables Tine, Tdec created in step S8 may have different lengths. In step S9, starting from the latest (most recent) temporal position in each of the tables Tine, Tdec, the first encountered group of N successive values with highest mean average is chosen and l<ept in the table other values being dismissed thus reducing dimension of each these tables to n. furthermore if one l n tine or tdec is lower than a predetermined value r it replaced corresponding by preceding group values. may be selected user. this represents minimum variation time interval between events first time-varying signal considered as significance for two obtained at end step s9 will referred following cine including positive distances and cdec absolute negative></ept>
In step S10, the tables Cine and Cdee are combined with the upper envelopes ForwHull and BaekwHull to provide Information on the instantaneous state of the ANS. To this effect, step 10 carries out two different calculations, called CT1 and CT2, which are exposed below:<br><br><br>
where A and B are the same predetermined constants as in CT1, normcoeff is the same normalization coefficient as in CT1, Qgeffinc^ â¢ ForwHull Is the term-by-term product of the tables Coeffinc? and ForwHull and Coeffdec^ â¢ BackwHuH is the term-by-term product of the tables Coeffdecg and BackwHuU.<br>
According to the present inventors, the table ANSigram-t as obtained above by the calculation CT1 is representative ot the state of the parasympathetic component of the ANS and the table ANSigram? as obtained above by the calculation CT2 Is representative of the state of the sympathetic component of the ANS. Thus, the present invention not only provides information on the state of the<br><br>
\NS but can also discriminate the sympatJ-ietlc and parasympathetic components 3f the ANS. !n practice, as will be apparent In the following, each of the tables ^NSigram^ and ANSigramp will be presented to the user in the form of a curve inking the points of the table. The shape of this curve will be directly interpretable Dy the user. For example, fiat ANSigrami and ANSigram? curves will indicate a ow reactivity of the ANS whereas observing e.g. a persistent increasing slope In ;hese curves will indicate a change of pace in the time intervals, i.e., in the case of ;he first time-varying signal being an ECG, a change of the cardiac activity. The jser will also have the possibility to compare the morphology of these curves with Dreviously seen curve morphologies to precisely identify a trouble affecting the aatlent. Furthermore, the point-by-point subtraction of one of the curves ^NS{gram^ and ANSigram? from the other will give the user a view of the balance Detween the sympathetic and the parasympathetic subsystems, balance which was discovered by the present inventors to be non-linear.<br>
In step S11, a first index ANSindexi is calculated for representing a complexity exponent of the table or curve ANSigrami and a second index ^NSindexa is calculated for representing a complexity exponent of the table or Durve ANSigramp. The index ANSIndexi, respectively ANSindexa, is a number /vhich is high when the corresponding curve ANSigrami, respectively ANSigram?, 3xhibits large fluctuations and which is low when the cun/e ANSigram-). 'espectiveiy ANSigramo. exhibits small fluctuations, i.e. is almost rectilinear. These indices are typically calculated as a Bouligand dimension normalized as 3Xterior, for example in the following manner.<br><br><br>
where Floor designates the integer part, which returns zero If the argument is negative, ANSIengthi and ANSlength2 respectively designate the length of the curve ANSigram-. and the length of the curve ANSigram?, rangei designates the difference between the last value and the first value of the curve ANSigrami and range2 designates the difference between the last value and the first value of the curve ANSigram?.<br>
In step S12 an index ANSirisk is calculated which represents a risk or probability that the shape of the curves ANSigram^ and ANSigramo will change at the next event in the first time-varying signal (i.e., in the case of an ECG, at the next R wave detected), which would mean a probability of change of the state of the ANS. This index ANSirisk represents, in other words, the degree of activity of the ANS. The calculation of index ANSirisk is based on one of tables Tine and Tdec obtained in step S8, preferably on table Tdec in the case indicated above In relation with step S6 where the orientation of the projection straight line is chosen according to the axis this straight line is most parallel to. This index ANSirisk is typically determined in the following manner: first, one determines the number ai of values in the table Tdec which are greater than a predetermined number rstart, the number aa of values in the table Tdec which are greater than rstart+1, the number as of values in the table Tdec which are greater than rstart+2, ..., and the number arstop-rstart of values in the table Tdec which are greater than rstop, where rstop is also a predetermined number. Then, a weighted average of the numbers a\ is calculated:<br><br><br>
where, preferably, RstCenter=21, Rcenter=10 and Vcenter=30.<br>
In step S13, the curves ANSigrami and ANSIgrama and the indices ANSlndexi, ANSindexa and ANSirisk are displayed. Preferably, the first time-varying signal is also displayed.<br>
Then the algorithm returns to step S2 for the next event in the time-varying signal acquired from the patient.<br>
An example of a result obtained with the method according to the present invention will now be exposed in relation with figures 5 to 8.<br>
In figure 5 is Illustrated a signal representing the RR intervals of a healthy patient during a period of five minutes. Between instants to and ti in this period, a tilt test is applied to the patient. As can be seen, a change of pace occurs in the RR intervals between the instants to and ti. However, in practice, such a change of pace can be detected on the RR interval signal only a certain time after the instant to, once the general decrease of the signal is distinguishable. In the example of figure 5, the instant from which one can observe, with the sole use of conventional means, that a change of pace has occurred is about an Instant designated by tg which is relatively close to the instant ti. It is also to be mentioned that, for certain patients, a tilt test does not always cause a clear change of pace in the RR intervals, hence the difficulty of detecting the change.<br>
Figure 6 shows a superposition of the curves ANSigrami obtained during the tilt test between the Instants to and ti. Each one of these curves Is a "photography" of the instantaneous state of what is believed to be the parasympathetic component of the ANS after a beating of the patient's heart or, more precisely, after an RR interval has been determined. In figure 6, the darker a curve is, the more recent it is. It can be seen that the shape of the cun/e ANSigram^ evolves rapidly between the Instants to and ti, which means that the method according to the Invention is very reactive. As only the morphology of this curve is significant, no scale is needed, an aspect ratio being however predetermined for displaying the curve.<br><br>
Figure 7 shows on a same diagram a series of indices ANSindexi and a series of Indices ANSindexg obtained during the above-mentioned five-minute period. The indices ANSindexi are represented by crosses and the indices ANSindex2 by rectangies. It Is interesting to note that the index ANSindexi Increases at the beginning of the tilt and reaches a peak well before the instant ti at which the patient is at the 80Â° position and even well before the aforementioned instant ta observed with the traditional means, whereas the index ANSindexg increases slowly at the beginning of the tilt, until a first peak situated well after the instant ti. Thus, the index ANSindexi reacts rapidly whereas the index ANSindex2 has a slower reaction. Once the patient has reached the position at 80Â°, the index ANSindexi decreases while the index ANSindexa takes over and exhibits different waves. All this is perfectly coherent with what is currently known on the behaviors of the sympathetic and parasympathetic subsystems. In particular, the presence of the aforementioned waves in the index ANSindexa can be explained by the release of catecholamine hormones by the sympathetic subsystem.<br>
Figure 8 shows the evolution of the index ANSirisk during the above-mentioned five-minute period. One can see that this index exhibits a peak substantially in the middle of the tilt period between instants to and ti. in practice, rather than being displayed as a curve as shown in figure 8, the index ANSirisk may be presented to the user in the form of a gauge moving upward and downward as a function of time.<br>
The method as described above is- typically performed by a suitably programmed processor. As shown in figure 9, the processor, designated by reference 1, is connected via a suitable interface (not shown) to the output of an acquisition unit 2. The acquisition unit 2 is associated with electrodes 2a connected to the patient and performs analog-to-digital conversion to produce the first time-varying signal representing the quasi-periodical events. The acquisition unit 2 is, for example, an EGG unit. A display unit 3 is connected to the processor 1 to display the results provided by the method according to the invention, such as<br><br>
the curves ANSigrami and ANSigram?, the difference between these curves ^NSigram^ and ANSigram^. the indices ANSindexi and ANSindex2, a historical record of these indices ANSindexi and ANSindexa (see figure 7), and/or the Index ANSirlsk, as well as the first time-varying signal.<br>
In practice, several embodiments are possible for arranging the units 1, 2, 3 relative to one another. According to a first embodiment, the processor 1 and the display unit 3 are part of a laptop computer connected, for example via a USB port, to the acquisition unit 2. According to a second embodiment, the processor 1 is part of a plug-in electronic board. According to a third embodiment, the processor 1, the acquisition unit 2 and the display unit 3 are part of a stand-alone apparatus further comprising a main board, a printer, a media recorder (CD-ROM,...), a battery, etc. According to a fourth embodiment, the processor 1 and the display unit 3 are part of a handheld device such as, for example, a cellphone, a Palm OS (registered trademark) device, a PocketPC (registered trademark) device, any personal digital assistant, etc.<br>
Furthermore, in some embodiments, the connection between the electrodes 2a and the acquisition unit 2, that between the acquisition unit 2 and the processor 1, and/or that between the processor 1 and the display unit 3 may be wireless connections, such as Bluetooth (registered trademark) connections.<br>

systems, provided that the events in the original time-varying signal are quasi-periodical and that the corresponding series of time intervals is chaotic, i.e. strongly dependent on initial conditions.<br><br><br>
