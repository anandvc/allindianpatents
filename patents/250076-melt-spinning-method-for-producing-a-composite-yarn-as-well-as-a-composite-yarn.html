				<td>MELT SPINNING METHOD FOR PRODUCING A COMPOSITE YARN AS WELL AS A COMPOSITE YARN<br>
The invention relates to a melt spinning method for producing a composite yam as defined in the preamble of claim 1, as well as a composite yam as defined in the preamble of claim 15.<br>
A generic method of melt spinning as well as a generic composite yarn are disclosed in DE 101 16 294AL<br>
For textile applications of synthetic fibers it is common to use in part so-called effect yams, which exhibit special yam effects, such as, for example structure effects, glaze effects, or color effects. Such yam effects can be produced by blending dissimilar synthetic fibers. In this connection, one distinguishes in the art between a two-stage method, wherein the synthetic fibers are produced separately from one another and wound to packages in a first process stage. In a second process stage, the yams are unwound fi-om feed yam packages and combined to a composite yam. A method of this type is disclosed, for example, in US 5,980,355 or US 5,943,852.<br>
In a second variant, the dissimilar fibers are extruded in a spinning process and combined to a composite yam in a single stage. The invention proceeds from this variant of producing a composite yam. In the melt spinning method disclosed in DE 101 16 294, two filament bundles are extruded side by side fi'om a polymer melt, for example, a polyester. After extrading, one of the filament bundles is cooled and drawn in such a manner that a POY yam with a preoriented molecular structure is formed. The parallel extmded second filament bundle is cooled and drawn in such a manner that an HOY yam forms with a highly oriented molecular structure. After cooling and drawing, the two yams are combined to a composite<br><br>
yam. Composite yams of this type distinguish themselves by a high shrinkage difference in the fibers, since a POY yam has a high boiling water shrinkage, and an HOY yam has a relatively low boiling water shrinkage in the fibers. These composite yams are especially suited for producing structure effects, such as, for example, bulkiness.<br>
In practice, however, it is desired to make such composite yams accessible to a wide spectrum of applications with different yam effects.<br>
US 5,858,290 discloses a melt spinning method for producing a composite yam, wherein two filament bundles are extruded parallel in side-by-side relationship, and cooled under identical conditions, so that after cooling two POY yams form with a preoriented molecular stmcture. Before combining the two yams, one of the yams is fully drawn, so that an FOY yam forms. The POY yam and the FOY yam are then combined to the composite yam. However, the fiber differences which originate from drawing, have the disadvantage that the limited withdrawal speed of a POY yam peermits producing only very limited differences in the physical properties of the fibers.<br>
In comparison therewith, DD 266 598 Al discloses a method of producing a composite yam, wherein the filament bundles advance through different setting zones directly after extruding and before cooling. In this process, the action of a so-called.afterheater is used to attain a delayed crstallization in one of the filament bundles. After a joint cooling, the filament bundles are combined and wound as a composite yam to a package. Likewise, this process permits producing different physical properties in the individual fibers only within relatively narrow limits. Thus, the composite yams disclosed in US 5,858,290 and DD 266 598 Al are limited to a maximum shrinkage difference in the fibers of at most 30%.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to further develop the generic melt spinning method for producing a composite yam as well as the composite yam such<br><br>
that a widest possible spectrum for producing yam effects is created while maintaining a highest possible shrinkage difference.<br>
A special object of the invention consists in attaining as much as possible for each desired yam effect an optimum of the fiber blend in the composite yam.<br>
In accordance with the invention, this object is accomplished by a melt spinning method with the steps of claim 1, as well as by a composite yam with the features of claim 15.<br>
Advantageous further developments of the invention are defined by the features and feature combinations of the respective dependent claims.<br>
The invention is based on the knowledge that the blending ratio of the fibers in the composite yam as well as the fiber cross sections are decisive for defining the characteristic and thus the possible application of the composite yam. In this connection, limit values have crystallized for the application in the textile field, which . are to be maintained for adjusting the yam effects that are common for textile applications. The filaments of the POY yams and the filaments of the HOY yams are thus combined in the composite yam at a mass ratio of MPOY/MHOY  2.0 deniers, and the filaments of the HOY yam have a denier of 
Depending on the case of application and the therewith connected yam effect, it is possible to produce the composite yam with different mass percentages of the POY yam and HOY yam. Thus, the ranges of the mass ratio of MPOY/MHOY from 1.0 to 2.5 are especially suited for producing structure effects and color effects in<br><br>
the composite yam. To produce color effects, a range of the mass ratio of MPOY/MHOY from 0.5 to 0.75 has also been found very advantageous.<br>
To be able to still better influence the possibility of combination and the characteristic of the composite yam, the further development of the method according to the invention is especially preferred, wherein the POY yam and the HOY yam are each formed from a different number of filaments in the filament bundle with different deniers of the filaments. With that, it is possible to realize individual combinations between the POY yams and the HOY yams.<br>
An essential aspect in the melt spinning process of a composite yam is the combination of the POY yam and the HOY yam. In this connection, the variant of the method has shown especially useful, wherein the composite is produced by a multistage entanglement, with a first stage occurring in an initial entanglement after cooling, and a second stage by a main entanglement before winding the composite yam. The initial entanglement occurring after cooling has the advantage that the POY yam and the HOY yam can jointly advance in the spinning process for their further treatment, without producing an overly intensive yam cohesion. Only before winding, will a main entanglement take place, which causes the two yams to combine by means of entanglement knots.<br>
In this process, an adequate yam cohesion will advantageously be reached, when the main entanglement is performed under an overpressure of the air, which permits producing in the composite yam at least a number of 25 entanglement knots per meter.<br>
In the case that the main entanglement is carried out between two godets, it is possible to perform as an alternative a third entanglement of the composite yam for purposes of causing the filaments to intermingle as is needed for the further treatment of the composite yam.<br>
To combine the filaments of the POY yam and the filaments of the HOY yam, the filaments of the POY yam are lubricated after cooling and advancing through a<br><br>
spin zone &gt; 800 mm. In this process, a greater spin zone of the POY yam enables a slower cooling, which is accompanied by an increase of the withdrawal speed.<br>
In. so doing, the filament bundle of the POY yam and the filament bundle of the HOY yam are withdrawn at the same withdrawal speed.<br>
In the case that the POY yam is cooled by a cooling air stream that is generated in the direction of the advancing yam, withdrawal speeds in range above 3,500 m/min. and higher are possible.<br>
To be able to attain yet maximal shrinkage differences in the composite yam, an advantageous further development provides for adjusting cooling and withdrawal of the filament bundle of the POY yam such that a boiling water shrinkage results of at least 50%, preferably in ranges from 50% to 70%. In comparison therewith, the cooling and withdrawal of the filament bundle of the HOY yam are adjusted such that a boiling water shrinkage results in the yam of at most 10%, preferably in a range from 4% to 10%. With that, it is possible to realize boiling water shrinkage differences in the composite yam of &gt;40%, preferably &gt;45%.<br>
Despite the common withdrawal of the two filament bundles, it is possible-to ensure a great individual adjustability while extmding and cooling the filament bundles, in that the method steps are performed by separately controllable processing units.<br>
At the end of the process, the composite yam is wound to a package, with the ta-keup speed being adjusted only insignificantly higher than the withdrawal speed. To be able to attain the characteristic of the POY yam and the HOY yam, the ta-keup speed differs fix)m the withdrawal speed only by a factor in a range from 0.95 to 1.2.<br>
The composite yam of the invention distinguishes itself as effect yam for textile applications. The composition of the POY yam and the HOY yam in accordance with the invention pemitts generating in the composite yam both stmcture effects<br><br>
and color effects in a particularly intensive way. The similar crystalline structure of the POY yam and the HOY yam is especially advantageous during a subsequent dyeing of the composite yam. The filaments of the composite yam absorb dyes with the same intensity, so that no color differences develop within the composite yam.<br>
It has been found that as a function of the desired yam effects, certain ranges of the mass ratios are considered especially suited for attaining between the POY yam and the HOY yam, effects that are directed in particular to the yam effects. In this connection, mass ratios of 1.0 to 2,5 or 0.5 to 0.75 have crystallized as advantageous ranges.<br>
It is thus possible to produce structure effects in particular at a mass ratio in a range fi'om 1.0 to 1.5, at which the broken filaments of the HOY yam are produced in a subsequent texturing process, to obtain, for example, a wooly effect or a spun-like effect. The filament deniers of the HOY yam are in a range of 
Color effects, such as, for example, a mixed color effect, can be very advantageously produced by the mass ratio MPOPY/MHOY in a range firom 1.5 to 2.0 or, altematively, also in a range from 0.5 to 0.75.<br>
The composite yam of the invention distinguishes itself in particular by the high shrinkage difference in the filament, so (hat so-called flat effects can be produced with high shrinkage differences of more than 40%. The composite yam of the invention opens totally new possibilities for textile applications, which have so far been reserved only to composite yams that were produced by the two-stage process.<br>
To guarantee the yam cohesion that is required for further processing the composite yam, the filaments of the POY yarn and the HOY yam are interconnected by a high number of entanglement knots. In this connection, it is absolutely necessary to maintain a lower limit value of 25 entanglement knots per meter.<br><br>
In the following, the method for producing the composite yam is described in greater detail by means of an embodiment with reference to Figure 1.<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic view of the setup of a spinning apparatus. The spinning apparatus comprises a POY spinning position 1 as well as an HOY spinning position 2, which are arranged side by side with no space inbetween. The spinning position 1 includes a driven spin pump 1.1 which connects to a source of melt not shown. The spin pump 1.1 connects to a spinneret 1,2. The spinneret 1.2 which experts also name spin pack is arranged in a beatable spin head 1.3. On its underside, the spinneret 1.2 comprises a plurality of spin holes (not shown). Downstream of the spin head 1.3, a cooling device 1.4 extends. The constmction of the cooling device 1.4 within the POY spinning position is basically disclosed in DE 101 16 294 Al, so that this publication is herewith incorporated by reference. The special feature of the cooling device 1.4 is that the filament strands are cooled by means of a cooling tube, in which a cooling air stream generated in the direction of the advancing yam cools the filament bundle as much as possible free of stress. At the outlet end of the cooling device 1.4, a yam lubrication device 1.5 is provided for combining the cooled filaments to a POY yam 3.<br>
The HOY spinnig position 2 comprises likewise a driven spin pump 2.1, which connects to a source of melt In the production of the composite yam fix&gt;m a polymer melt, it is common to connect the spin pumps 1.1 and 2.1 to an extruder.<br>
The spin pump 2.1 connects to a spinneret 2.2, which comprises on its underside a plurality of spin holes for extmding a plurality of filament strands. The spirmeret 2.2 is arranged in a beatable spin head 2.3. Downstream of the spin head 2.3, a cooling device 2.4 extends, and at the outlet end of the cooling device 2.4, a yam lubrication device 2.5 follows. The constmction of the cooling device is likewise disclosed in DE 101 16 294 Al, so that for the description of the cooling device, the foregoing publication is herewith incorporated by reference. Essential is that the cooling device 2.4 is operated separately and independently from the cooling<br><br>
device 1.4, so that the filaments produced in the HOY spinning position 2 are differently cooled than the filaments spun in the POY spinning position 1. In this connection, it is essential that the spin zone, in which the filaments are cooled, is made, because of process conditions,, substantially shorter in the HOY spinning position 2 than in the POY spinning position 1. In this connection, the spin zone is identified by the distance of the yam lubrication devices 1.5 and 2.5 from the respective undersides of spinnerets 1.2 and 2.2. In the case of the POY spinning position 1, the spin zone has a length of at least 800 mm. Preferably, it is made longer than the spin zone of the HOY spinning position 2, which has a maximum length of 900 mm.<br>
In the HOY spinning position 2, the yam lubrication device 2.5 combines the filaments to an HOY yam 4,<br>
The POY yam 3 and the HOY yam 4 are withdrawn by a godet unit 7, which comprises a driven withdrawal godet 8 and a guide roll 9. In so doing, the HOY yam 4 advances doAvnstream of the yam lubrication device 2.5 over deflection rolls 5.1 and 5.2 into the path of the advancing POY yam 3. As deflection rolls 5.1 and 5.2, it is preferred to use freely rotatable rolls, preferably supported in air bearings, to generate the least possible yam frictions. Downstream of the deflection roll 5.2 is a first entanglement unit 6. The first entanglement unit 6 comprises a yam channel, through which the POY yam 3 and the HOY yam 4 adviance jointly- The yam channel receives compressed air for entangling the filaments of the two yams, so that in a first stage, a yam cohesion occurs for forming a composite yam 10. After looping the godet unit 7 several times, the composite yam 10. advances over a subsequent draw godet 12 by partially looping same. Between the draw godet 12 and the godet unit 7, a main entanglement unit 11 extends, in which the filaments of the composite yam 10 receive a final yam cohesion.<br>
At the end, the composite yam 10 enters a takeup device 13, and is wound to a package 14.  The takeup device 13 is constmcted as a winding machine with a<br><br>
turret, as is disclosed, for example, in EP 0 937 008 Bl. With this type of takeup, it is possible to wind the composite yam to packages in a continuous operation. For a description in greater detail of the takeup device 13, the foregoing publication is herewith incorporated by reference.<br>
To carry out the method of the invention, the spinmerets 1.2 and 2.2 are selected with respect to the number of their spin holes and choice of the capillary diameters of the spin holes such that a defined mass ratio of the mass of the POY yam MpoY to the mass of the HOY yam MHOY adjusts in the composite yam. The spin holes of the spinneret 1.2 have a capillary diameter of at least 0.25 mm to be able to produce a filament denier in the POY yam of &gt; 2 deniers. In comparison therewith, the spin holes of the spinneret 2.2 are made smaller to be able to produce, for example a filament denier in the HOY yam of 
To produce the composite yam, a source of melt supplies a polymer melt, which is delivered by the spin pump 1.1 to the spinneret 1.2 and by the spin pump 2.1 to the spinneret 2.2. In their deliveries, the spin pumps 1.1 and 1.2 are adapted to the respective constellation of the spin holes in the spinnerets 1.2 and 2.2 as well as the selected withdrawal speed. Thus, it is possible to adjust in the POY spinning position 1 and the HOY spinning position 2 the deliveries of the spin pumps 1.1 and 1.2 each individually.<br>
After extruding the filament strands through the spinneret 1.2, same are cooled in the cooling device 1.4 by a cooling air stream that is largely directed in the direction of the advancing yam.  At the end of the spin zone, the filaments are com-<br><br>
bined by the yam lubrication device 1.5 to a POY yam 3. To be able to adjust a highest possible withdrawal speed, the method of the invention requires maintaining a spin zone of at least 800 mm during the cooling of the POY yam. It is preferred to select a still longer spin zone for a stressfree cooling of the filaments of the POY yam.<br>
In comparison therewith, the filament strands of the HOY yam are cooled in a spin zone that is shorter than 900 mm. Preferably the spin zone for producing the HOY yam 4 is shorter than the spin zone of the POY yam 3. These differences in lengths of the yam path make it possible to deflect the HOY yam, preferably downstream of the lubrication device, directly into the path of the POY yam, so as to enable a joint advance and a joint withdrawal by a withdrawal godet imit. To ensure the advance of the yam on the withdrawal godet unit 7, the POY yam 3 and the HOY yam 4 are entangled in a first stage. The entanglement by the first entanglement unit 6 is adjusted such that the filaments undergo a slight entanglement, so as to not impede the formation of the POY yam with a partially oriented molecular stmcture, and the formation of the HOY yam with a highly oriented molecular stmcture. In this connection, the withdrawal speed of the withdrawal godet unit 7 is adjusted to values above 3,500 m/min. With a corresponding cooling of the POY yam, it is possible to achieve withdrawal speeds greater than 5,000 m/min.<br>
The final combination of the filaments of the POY yam and the HOY yam to the composite yam proceeds in the main entanglement unit 11 after withdrawal by the godet unit 7. In this process, the compressed air entering the yam channel of the main entanglement unit 11 is adjusted to aart overpressure, which leads to an intensive knot formation. It is thus possible to produce in the composite yam a mini-mum number of 25 knots per running meter. The main entanglement of the composite yam 10 occurs between the godet unit 7 and the draw godet 12, In this process, the draw godet 12 is driven at a somewhat higher circumferential speed than the withdrawal godet 8, so that a predefined yam tension can be adjusted for<br><br>
the entanglement. Finally, the composite yam 10 is wound by the takeup device 13 to a package 14.<br>
In this* process, the composite yam 10 is wound at a takeup speed, which is only insignificantly higher than the withdrawal speed, so as to prevent unacceptable drawing. Preferably, the takeup speed is adjusted to differ from the withdrawal speed by a factor of 0.95 to 1.2.<br>
The constraction of the apparatus for carrying out tiie method of the invention as shown in Figure 1 is exemplary. Basically, the cooling devices 1.4 and 2,4 may include modifications, in which the filaments strands first advance through a first uncooled heating zone. In particular in the HOY spinning position 2, so-called annealers may be arranged between the cooling device 2.4 and the spin head 2.3 in order to produce an especially low-shrinkage HOY yam.<br>
Furthermore, the combination of the composite yam 10 can be further improved before the takeup by arranging a third entanglment unit between the draw godet 12 and the takeup device 12. With that, it is possible to achieve in a third stage a further entanglement of the filaments that is directed in particular to the yam lengths forming between the knots.<br>
The composite yam of the invention that is produced by the method of the invention is thus especially suited for use in textile applications as a effect yam with a stmctuxe effect or a color effect. As a function of the desired yam effect, a mass ratio of the filaments of the POY yam and the HOY yam is selected. In so doing, it is necessary to maintain certain filament deniers of the POY yam and the HOY yam respectively, to ensure on the one hand a strength of the yam as is required for its application, and to obtain on the other hand the desired effects in structure or color. The composite yam of the invention is therefore defined by limit ranges of the filament deniers. Thus, when combining the filaments, it is necessary to see that the filaments of the POY yam have a denier &gt; 2.0 deniers, and the filaments of the HOY yam a denier 
 <br>
ing, it is necessary to maintain a mass ratio of the filaments of the POY yam to the filaments of the HOY yam of MPOY/MHOY 
To produce conventional bulked synthetic composite yams with a high shrinkage difference, a combination of the POY yam and the HOY yam has been found especially advantageous, wherein the mass ratio is in a range from 1.2 to 2.5. Table 1 lists a plurality of typical composite yams, which were produced by the method of the invention. The composite yams are within a total denier range from 135 denier to 450 denier, with the number of filaments being at least 60 and at most 168. The composite yams listed in Table 1 were extruded from polyester. They are especially suited for producing a so-called flat effect with a high shrinkage difference. In all combinations, the boiling water shrinkage measured on the filaments of the POY yam ranged from 50 to 70%. In comparison therewith, it was possible to produce the HOY yam with a low boiling water shrinkage in a range from 4 to 10%, so that it was possible to adjust shrinkage differences of more than 60%. The takeup speeds were set in a range from 4,500 to 6,500 m/min.<br>
Tables 2 and 3 show further embodiments of the composite yam according to the invention, which were likewise extruded from a polyester material. The composite yams listed in Table 2 are preferred and suited to produce a so-called wooly effect. In this instance, the composite yam is textured in a further processing step, wherein individual breaks of the filaments of the HOY yam occur. With that, a surface is created, which is similar to a wool yam. For such structure effects, it is desired that the mass ratio MROY/MHOY be preferably in a range from 1.0 to 1,5. In this case, the filament deniers of the HOY yam are preferably 
Similar effects can be achieved with the composite yams shown in Table 3. The composite yams listed in Table 3 are preferably used for producing so-called<br><br>
spun-like effects. Likewise in this case the mass ratio MPOY/MHOY is in a range from 1.0 to 1.5.<br>
The composite yam of the invention is also particularly suited for dyeing. Because of similar crystallinity of the POY yam and the HOY yam, it is possible to achieve an intensive coloring. It is likewise possible to adjust special color effects, such as, for example, a mixed color effect. To do so, it has been found that the mass ratio MPOY/MHOY should be in a range from 1.5 to 2.0, or alternatively in a range from 0.5 to 0.75. In this respect, the composite yam can be used for textile applications in many ways. The combination between a POY yam and an HOY yam can be realized by the use of one polymer type, or also by the use of different modifications of a base polymer or a plurality of polymer types.<br>
The method of the invention distinguishes itself in particular by high withdrawal speeds and a thus accompanying high productivity in the production of a composite yam in a single stage process. Likewise, the expenditure for processing units is advantageous, in particular in the takeup region, since both parallel spun yams are jointly withdrawn at the saine withdrawal speed.<br><br>
