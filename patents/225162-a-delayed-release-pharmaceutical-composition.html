The solid oral compositions may be prepared by conventional methods of blending, filling or tabletting. Repeated blending operations may be used to distribute the active agent throughout those compositions employing large quantities of fillers. Such operations are of course conventional in the art. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in norma! pharmaceutical practice, in particular with an enteric coating.<br>
Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for/econstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conveniional additives such as suspending agents, for example sorbitol, syrup, methyl cellulose, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, aluminium stearate gel, hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), for example almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters such as esters of glycerine, propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol; preservatives, for example methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid; and if. desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents.<br>
For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilizing the compound and a sterile vehicle, and, depending on the concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions the compound can be dissolved in water for injection and filter sterilized before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, a preservative and buffering agent can be dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability, the composition can be frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner, except that the Compound (I) suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved, and sterilization cannot be accomplished by filtration. The compound can be sterilized by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound.<br>
As indicated the compositions are preferably in a unit dosage form in an amount appropriate for the relevant daily dosage.<br>
The present treatments and compositions may also contain other medicaments in addition to insulin sensitisers including other anti diabetic agents, such as insulin secretagogues, biguanide antihypergrycaemic agents and alpha glucosidase inhibitor antihyperglycaemic agents.<br>
In the treatment the medicaments may be administered from 1 to 6 times a day, suitably 1 or 2 times per day, preferably once per day.<br><br>
Compositions may contain from 0.1 % to 99% by weight, preferably from 10-60% by weight, of the active material, depending upon the method of administration.<br>
The composition may, if desired, be in the form of a pack accompanied by written or printed instructions for use.<br>
The method by which the Threshold Plasma Concentration, such as the SC50 concentration, for a given compound can be determined is:<br>
1)	first to obtain plasma concentrations versus time data for the compound, preferably using data from humans, by using standard pharmacokinetic compartmental modelling methods (for example for Compound (I), concentrations were fit to a one compartment model.);<br>
2)	the model predicted concentrations for the compound are then fed back into the model and used to determine the change in fasting plasma glucose levels after various doses;<br>
3)	the relationship between predicted plasma concentrations of compound and<br>
fasting plasma glucose can suitably be determined using an indirect pharmacological<br>
response model (model IV), for example that described in (Dayneka NL, Garg V- and Jusko<br>
WJ,.Comparison of Four Basic Models of Indirect Pharmacodynamic Responses. J of<br>
Pharmacokinetics and Biopharmaceutics. Vol 21, No 4. 1993). This model yields estimates<br>
of glucose input rate (Kin) and output rate (Kout), maximal stimulation of glucose output<br>
(Smax).Hill coefficient (gamma) and the Threshold Plasma Concentration, such as the<br>
SC50 concentration (i.e the concentration associated with a half maximal response) to be<br>
determined, for that compound.  This method forms a further part of the present invention.<br>
For Compound (I), it was necessary to account for a time delay between the time of actual initiation of dosing (week 0) and the observed change in fasting plasma glucose. This delay factor was estimated through the modelling for each dose level. The mean delay across dose levels for Compound (I) was found to be 292 hours. The delay factor was incorporated into the model for deriving fasting plasma glucose by assuming that the first dose of drug occurred only after the time dictated by the delay factor. It is considered that for this model a delay factor would be required for other thiazolidinedione insulin sensitisers and that this factor will be substantially similar to that found for Compound (I). Delay factors for other compounds may also be required to be determined using similar methodology to that disclosed herein.<br>
The invention also comprises the above mentioned method, optionally including the step of introducing the delay factor into the model.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising an insulin sensitiser and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier<br><br>
therefor, the composition being adapted to provide a plasma concentration of the insulin sensitizer of at least a Threshold Plasma Concentration of the insulin sensitiser, which process comprises formulating the insulin sensitiser and the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier so as to provide a plasma concentration of the insulin sensitiser of at least a        Threshold Plasma Concentration of the insulin sensitiser.<br>
Suitably, the composition is a modified release composition.<br>
Suitably, the carrier is adapted so as to provide a plasma concentration of the insulin sensitiser of at least a Threshold Plasma Concentration.<br>
The compositions for the treatment are prepared and formulated according to        conventional methods, such as those disclosed in standard reference texts, for example the British and US Pharmacopoeias, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co.), Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia (London, The Pharmaceutical Press) (for example see the 31st Edition page 341 and pages cited therein) and Harry's Cosmeticology (Leonard Hill Books) or the above mentioned publications.<br>
The modified release compositions may be formulated according to appropriate methods disclosed in for example Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems, Editor Joe R Robinson, Volume 7, published by Marcel Dekker under the title Drugs and the Pharmaceutical Sciences, Controlled Drug Delivery, 2nd Edition* edited by Joe Robinson and Vince Lee, Marcel Dekker, 19S7 and Drug Delivery to the Gastrointestinal Tract'Editors: J G Hardy, S S. Davis and C G Wilson also with reference to texts such as the British and US Pharmacopoeias, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co.), Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia (London, The Pharmaceutical Press) (for example see the 31st Edition page 341 and pages cited therein) and Harry's Cosmeticology (Leonard Hill Books).  - No adverse toxicoiogical effects are expected for the compositions or methods of the invention in the above mentioned dosage ranges.<br>
EXAMPLES Example: Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Modeling of Compound (I) in Type 2 Diabetes Patients<br>
A PK/PD model was developed to characterise the effect of Compound (I) on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations in diabetic patients. The model was developed using mean fasting plasma glucose data from a Phase III clinical trial which consisted of comparison of placebo and four doses/regimens of Compound (I) in a parallel-group design<br><br>
of 26 weeks duration. Dose regimens evaluated were: 4 mg once daily and 2 mg twice daily, and 8 mg once daily and 4 mg twice daily.<br>
Pharmacokinetics of Compound (1)<br>
The pharmacokinetics of Compound (I) were described using a one-compartment model with first order oral absorption. Individual bayesian estimates of Compound (I) oral clearance and steady-state volume of.distribution were predicted for each patient in the same Phase III clinical trial utilizing the population parameter estimates (priors) from the Phase 1 population pharmacokinetic analysis. Mean concentration-time profiles (Cp) for each regimen for use in the pharmacodynamic modeling were predicted using the mean post hoc oral clearance (2.68 L/h) and Vss/F (15.4 L) values across these patients (Figure 1).<br>
Pharmacodynamics of Compound (I)<br>
A modified indirect response model IV (Dayneka et al. 1993) was developed utilizing the pharmacokinetics of Compound (I) as the driving force for the change in fasting plasma glucose after various doses of Compound (I). Modeling fittings were done using ADAPT II, Release 4 (D'Argenio and Schumitzky.1979).<br>
In the absence of Compound (I), plasma glucose levels are governed by formation (kin) and utilization (kout). The action of Compound (I) was described as stimulation (S(t)) of the utilization of plasma glucose (kout), described in text as FPG reduction (Eq. 1). S^ represents the maximal stimulation, SGÂ» is the Compound (I) concentration associated with half-maximal stimulation and y represents a sigmoidicity parameter in the Hill type function (Eq.2).<br>
  Eql.<br>
where<br>
             Eq2.<br>
The mean fasting plasma glucose profiles from 6 weeks prior to dosing (time 0) through 26 weeks of treatment for the 5 treatment groups are shown in Figure 2. The PK/PD model accommodates the full nature of the fastmg plasma glocose response over the duration of the study period as evidenced by the close agreement between observed and predicted fasting plasma glucose concentrations (Figure 2). An estimated lag-time (292<br><br>
hours) between the first dose and onset of response was incorporated into the modeling. The lag-time allows the model to describe the slow onset of action of Compound (I) observed over the first 4 weeks of dosing.<br>
The Fitted plasma glucose concentrations at steady-state reflect the difference in response to varying total daily dose as well as different dosing frequencies (i.e. once vs twice daily) (Figure 2). The estimated pharmacodynamic parameter values are shown in the table below:<br><br>
Based on these data, the Smax of the model suggests a maximum FPG reduction of 160 mg/dL.<br>
Although clinically meaningful reductions in glycaemia are evident with once daily dosing of Compound (I), the observation from study 024 that twice daily dosing tended to be more efficacious than once daily can be explained by differences in the concentration-time profiles of Compound (I) across these dosage regimens. Following twice daily dosing of 4 mg. Compound (I) concentrations remain above the SC50 for approximately 21 hours compared with only 14 hours following once daily dosing with 8 mg (Figure 1).<br>
Conclusion<br>
The differential effects on FPG reduction following once vs twice daily dosing are well described with a PK/PD model.<br>
