Commutator for an electric machine<br>
The present invention relates to a commutator for an electric machine, comprising a support<br>
member made from an insulating molding compound, a plurality of metal conductor segments<br>
disposed thereon in evenly spaced manner around the commutator axis, with terminal elements<br>
disposed thereon for a rotor winding, and an interference-suppression device, to which the<br>
conductor segments are connected in electrically conductive manner.<br>
Commutators of various designs (drum commutators, flat commutators) are known in diverse<br>
configurations. To an increasing extent, commutators are being equipped with spark-suppression<br>
devices (interference-suppression devices), especially if they are designed as drum commutators,<br>
in order to prevent sparking at the commutator from impairing electronic assemblies disposed in<br>
physical proximity to the electric machine in question that is equipped with the commutator.<br>
Heretofore such interference-suppression devices have often been designed as annular<br>
interference-suppression disks, which are made of a material having voltage-dependent resistance<br>
and which are connected in electrically conductive manner to the conductor segments. In such<br>
cases the corresponding interference-suppression disk can be mounted on the one hand radially<br>
outward of the brush running surface (for example, see US 5895990 A, US 5717270 A,'<br>
GB 2183933 A and US 5796203 A), or on the other hand radially inward of the brush running<br>
surface (for example, see US 6285106 B1 and DE 19953231 A1). Also known are special forms<br>
of interference-suppressed drum commutators, in which the conductor segments are disposed on<br>
the outside of cylindrical interference-suppression sleeves (see DE 2055648 and DE 3614869<br><br>
C2). Finally, EP 364292 B1 describes a drum commutator with a support member made of<br>
thermoplastic material, in which a heat-resistant reinforcing ring is provided radially underneath<br>
the terminal lug, which ring is provided with an interference-suppressing coating or can be<br>
disposed adjacent to a separate interference-suppression ring; in common with the separate<br>
interference-suppression ring that may be provided in addition, this reinforcing ring is mounted<br>
on a seat of the support member, where it is retained by straps protruding from the conductor<br>
segments.<br>
Regardless of the respective specific arrangement of interference-suppression disks, the<br>
considerable costs for the interference-suppression device constitute a disadvantage in all<br>
commutators whose interference-suppression device comprises an annular interference-<br>
suppression disk, since the ceramic material from which such interference-suppression disks are<br>
usually made is very expensive; moreover, large quantities of waste are produced in the<br>
manufacture of annular interference-suppression disks, since they are cut out of a multi-layer<br>
metal-ceramic plate.<br>
Incidentally, among the known drum commutators that are interference-suppressed by using an<br>
interference-suppression disk, only compact drum commutators with interference-suppression<br>
disks disposed radially inward of the brush running surface are feasible for many practical<br>
applications, because the space available for the respective commutator is limited. A further<br>
problem of such drum commutators with interference-suppression rings disposed radially inward<br>
of the brush running surface results from the different thermal expansion behavior of the<br>
interference-suppression disk, which is usually made of ceramic material, compared with the<br><br>
other components of the commutators in question. Specifically, if the thermal stresses are large<br>
enough, they can cause premature failure of commutators due to broken interference-suppression<br>
disks and/or destroyed connections between the conductor segments and the interference-<br>
suppression disks, unless special precautions are taken. As a solution to this problem, it is<br>
proposed in DE 19953231 A1 that the interference-suppression disk be joined to the support<br>
member by means of an elastic adhesive and that the conductor segments be connected to the<br>
interference-suppression disk via thin wires, which are soldered on the one hand to the terminal<br>
lug of the associated conductor segment and on the other hand to an associated metallization<br>
zone of the interference-suppression disk. In contrast, according to US 6285106 B1, which<br>
discloses a drum commutator of the class in question, there are provided, for electrical contact<br>
between the conductor segments and the interference-suppression disks, leaf springs that are<br>
disposed inside an annular cavity, which is bounded by the support member, the conductor<br>
segments and an annular cover, and in which the interference-suppression disk is also housed.<br>
The leaf springs, which permit different radial thermal insulation of the interference-suppression<br>
disk on the one hand and of the other commutator components on the other hand, can be fixed in<br>
particular to the annular cover.<br><br>
A particular disadvantage of the two known drum commutators, evaluated in the foregoing, each<br>
with an interference-suppression disk disposed radially inward of the conductor segments is in<br>
particular the high expense of manufacture, which is substantially due to the high manufacturing<br>
costs of the interference-suppression disk (see hereinabove) and hampers the competitiveness of<br>
the drum commutators in question.<br><br>
Accordingly, the problem underlying the present invention is to provide a long-lived, reliable,<br>
interference-suppressed commutator of the class in question, which commutator, in view of its<br>
suitability for mass production, can be made at low costs with little manufacturing expense. A<br>
particularly preferable object is to manufacture an interference-suppressed commutator with<br>
substantially the same dimensions as a non-interference-suppressed commutator of the same<br>
design.<br>
This object is achieved according to the present invention by the fact that the interference-<br>
suppression device comprises a number of individual interference-suppression elements<br>
corresponding to the number of conductor segments and an equally large number of contact<br>
bridges, each of which connects two mutually adjacent interference-suppression elements to one<br>
another in electrically conductive manner, each contact bridge being provided with two inwardly<br>
directed legs, which are flexible relative to one another in circumferential direction and are<br>
connected to the two associated interference-suppression elements in electrically conductive<br>
manner, and with one outwardly directed foot portion, which is connected to the associated<br>
conductor segment in electrically conductive manner.<br>
A first characteristic feature of the commutator according to the present invention is therefore<br>
that the interference-suppression device comprises not an annular interference-suppression disk<br>
but instead a number of individual interference-suppression elements corresponding to the<br>
number of conductor segments; such individual interference-suppression elements, which as<br>
multi-layer capacitors can have in particular a parallelepiped shape, can be made from a multi-<br>
layer metal-ceramic plate without any kind of cutting and thus in particularly inexpensive<br><br>
manner. Furthermore, it is characteristic for the inventive commutator that two mutually adjacent<br>
interference-suppression elements are respectively connected to one another in electrical manner<br>
via one contact bridge each, the two legs at which the contact bridge in question is connected to<br>
the two interference-suppression elements in electrically conductive manner being designed to be<br>
flexible relative to one another in circumferential direction. In this sense, "flexible" means that<br>
the force necessary for deformation of the contact bridges in circumferential direction is smaller<br>
than the strength of the joints of the contact bridges with the interference-suppression elements.<br>
'The interference-suppression device characterizing the inventive commutator is composed in this<br>
way of individual interference-suppression elements and contact bridges, which are joined<br>
together in alternating sequence to form a ring structure. The flexibility of the contact bridges<br>
then has the effect that the ring structure in question is not rigid; to the contrary, the ring structure<br>
is flexible as a whole in circumferential direction, and so it can compensate for changes of the<br>
dimensions of the commutator caused by thermal expansion. Such manufacture of the contact<br>
bridges as separate components ensures that they can be selectively matched - largely without<br>
restriction - to the described function, by the fact that the material choice and dimensions are<br>
optimized in terms of flexibility and strength of the ring structure of the interference-suppression<br>
device as well as the joint of the contact bridges with the interference-suppression elements.<br>
The deformability of the contact bridges in their installation situation is based on the one hand on<br>
their flexible construction and on the other hand on the fact that the legs of the contact bridges<br>
are free, meaning that that they can be deformed without hindrance by adjoining components of<br>
the commutator during the normal thermal-expansion behavior of the commutator.<br><br>
As "electrically conductive connections" of the contact bridges with the contact poles or contact<br>
faces of the respective two adjacent interference-suppression elements, there can be considered,<br>
in the scope of the present invention, several electrically conductive contacting arrangements,<br>
provided they are also suitable for transmission of mechanical forces; in particular, a special<br>
joining material such as solder is preferably used (see hereinafter), but in any case it is not<br>
necessarily provided for all embodiments of the invention. Direct and indirect contacting of the<br>
contact bridges with the interference-suppression elements without having disadvantageous<br>
effects on the useful life of the commutator is achieved by the fact that the contact bridges can<br>
deform to compensate for different thermal-expansion behavior of the individual commutator<br>
components.<br>
By application of the present invention, therefore, it is obviously possible, by virtue of the<br>
combinations of the features characteristic of inventive commutators, to manufacture extremely<br>
inexpensive, long-lived and compact interference-suppressed commutators with minimal<br>
production expense. In this regard, the present invention is applicable for various commutator<br>
designs, specifically regardless of the construction of the brush running surface. Commutators<br>
with carbon running surfaces, such as are used for operating fuel pumps for motor vehicles, can<br>
be constructed particularly advantageously according to the present invention.<br>
Particularly preferably, the contact bridges are permanently connected to the interference-<br>
suppression elements by means of simple soldered joints or even joints formed with electrically<br>
conductive adhesive in the region of the contact points. The situation is analogous for the<br>
connection of the contact bridges to the respective conductor segments in the region of the foot<br><br>
portion in question that contacts the conductor segments. In this regard, suitable metallization<br>
(such as a coating of silver or tin) of the interference-suppression elements in the region of their<br>
contact poles and/or of the contact bridges in the region of the legs may prove favorable; and in<br>
this regard it is also favorable for the contact bridges to be manufactured from copper, brass or an<br>
alloy containing these metals. Such permanent connections of the contact bridges to the<br>
interference-suppression elements and/or to the conductor segments, which are subject to only<br>
small mechanical loads due to the flexible construction of the contact bridges in the<br>
circumferential direction, as is the case for the interference-suppression elements themselves,<br>
prove to be particularly advantageous when the inventive commutator is used in a corrosive<br>
environment.<br>
According to another preferred improvement of the inventive commutator, the interference-<br>
suppression elements are designed as parallelepiped multi-layer capacitors and are disposed<br>
around the commutator axis along the edges of a regular polygon, specifically in a manner in<br>
which each is expediently located at breaks between two mutually adjacent conductor segments.<br>
This in particular favors manufacture of the inventive commutator by a method that is simple and<br>
therefore inexpensive.<br>
Within the scope of the present invention, considerable margin for variation, which can be<br>
exploited in particular as a function of the commutator design, the dimensions and the specific<br>
requirements, is available for the structural design of the contact bridges. In this regard, a first<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention is characterized by the fact that the contact bridges are<br>
each disposed spatially between two mutually adjacent interference-suppression elements and are<br><br>
connected to the associated interference-suppression elements in the region of contact faces at the<br>
ends thereof. Each of these contact bridges can be made in particular of a bent metal strip, in<br>
which case the basic form of the contact bridges can then be described as substantially V-shaped.<br>
According to another preferred improvement of the invention, it is provided that the contact<br>
bridges are disposed in a plane axially offset relative to the interference-suppression elements<br>
and are connected to the associated interference-suppression elements in the region of laterally<br>
disposed contact faces. In this case, the contact bridges, whose shape may resemble in particular<br>
a horseshoe with a foot portion attached thereto, may be made of plane metal flat stock (such as<br>
sheet), which proves to be particularly favorable in terms of costs. Such a construction of the<br>
contact bridges also has advantageous effects on the way in which commutators are<br>
manufactured according to the present invention.<br><br>
Whereas the concept underlying the present invention can be advantageously adopted for<br>
commutators with different designs (drum commutators, flat commutators) and brush running<br>
surfaces of different constructions (such as those directly on metal conductor segments or those<br>
having carbon running surfaces), the advantages achievable with the present invention are<br>
particularly marked in the case that the commutator is designed as a drum commutator with a<br>
cylindrical brush running surface, since the invention permits a particularly compact design, now<br>
that the brush running surface can be extended in axial direction beyond the interference-<br>
suppression device.<br>
As regards the construction of the terminal elements, yet another preferred improvement of the<br>
invention is characterized in that the terminal elements are designed as terminal lugs, which in<br>
the case of design of the commutator as a drum commutator are disposed in the region of the end<br>
face of the commutator opposite the interference-suppression device. In this case, the risk of<br>
damage to the connections of the contact bridges to the conductor segments as well as to the<br>
interference-suppression elements during welding of the rotor winding onto the terminal lugs is<br>
minimal.<br>
To ensure that they will be secured in position - even during assembly - it is particularly<br>
preferable that each interference-suppression element be inserted into a support-member seat<br>
countersunk axially into the support member. To brace the interference-suppression element in<br>
question in radial direction, in circumferential direction and in axial direction, the bounding walls<br>
of such a seat are disposed opposite the radial inner and outer faces, the two end faces and one<br>
side face of the interference-suppression element. It is particularly preferable for each of these<br><br>
seats to be bounded in radially inward and circumferential direction by a ribbed ring and in<br>
radially outward direction by molding-compound projections of the support member.<br>
It is to be pointed out in this regard that, at least in the case in which the contact bridges are each<br>
spatially disposed between two mutually adjacent interference-suppression elements in the<br>
manner explained hereinabove, the individual seats for the interference-suppression elements are<br>
connected to one another by installation spaces for the contact bridges, the configuration of the<br>
installation spaces being matched to the shape of the contact bridges. Although this is<br>
advantageous, it is not absolutely necessary, if the contact bridges, as also explained hereinabove,<br>
are disposed in a plane axially offset relative to the interference-suppression elements and are<br>
connected to the associated interference-suppression elements in the region of lateral, or in other<br>
words axially disposed contact faces.<br>
As regards the manufacture of commutators according to the present invention, it is based on the<br>
method known as such and used in the relevant industry for the manufacture of a support<br>
member and of conductor segments provided with commutator blanks and embedded therein. To<br>
this extent the invention corresponds to the sufficiently known prior art, and so no further<br>
explanations are needed. In a departure from the previously employed method used for<br>
manufacture of known commutators, however, there are molded, during manufacture of the<br>
support member, seats disposed in the end faces thereof to accommodate the interference-<br>
suppression elements and if necessary installation spaces to accommodate the contact bridges<br>
connecting these seats to one another. As a rule, subsequent assembly of the individual<br>
interference-suppression elements and of the same number of contact bridges takes place in two<br><br>
separate, successive steps. In this sense, the prefabricated interference-suppression elements are<br>
first inserted into the said seats in the course of the further manufacturing process; thereafter the<br>
prefabricated contact bridges are attached in such a way that they each connect two mutually<br>
adjacent interference-suppression elements and one conductor segment in electrically conductive<br>
manner. For this purpose, the contact bridges can be soldered or adhesively bonded in the region<br>
of their leg to the two respective associated interference-suppression elements and in the region<br>
of the foot portion to the respective associated conductor segment.<br>
In this regard it is favorable to apply solder or adhesive onto the contact bridges, in the region of<br>
their subsequent electrically conductive connections to the interference-suppression elements and<br>
to the conductor segments, before they are attached.<br>
If the contact bridges are manufactured by being punched out of a plane sheet strip, as was<br>
explained hereinabove, their configuration during punching preferably corresponds to their<br>
configuration in the commutator to be manufactured. After these contact bridges have been<br>
punched out of the sheet strip, they are pressed back into it again, so that the sheet strip<br>
constitutes an assembly aid for the contact bridges. After the interference-suppression elements<br>
have been inserted into the seats, all contact bridges are transferred together onto the commutator<br>
blank, by being pressed out of the sheet strip into the installation spaces, if such are provided. In<br>
this technique, any solder or adhesive to be used is preferably applied onto the contact bridges<br>
after they have been pressed back into the sheet strips.<br>
The present invention will be explained in more detail hereinafter with reference to three<br><br>
preferred practical examples illustrated in the accompanying drawing, wherein<br>
Fig. 1	shows an axial section through a first embodiment of a drum<br>
commutator constructed according to the present invention,<br>

according to Fig. 1,<br>
Fig. 3	shows a detail, in an enlarged perspective view, of the end face<br>
shown in Fig. 1 of the drum commutator according to Figs. 1 and 2,<br>
Fig. 4	shows an axial section through a second embodiment of a drum<br>
commutator constructed according to the present invention,<br>
Fig. 5	shows a view from above of the end of the drum commutator<br>
according to Fig. 4,<br>
Fig. 6	shows a detail, in an enlarged perspective view of the end face<br>
shown in Fig. 4 of the drum commutator according to Figs. 4 and 5, and<br>
Fig. 7	shows a perspective view of a flat commutator constructed<br>
according to the present invention, with carbon running surface.<br><br>
The drum commutator illustrated in Figs. 1 to 3 contains as essential components a support<br>
member 1 made of insulating molding compound and ten conductor segments 3, which are<br>
disposed evenly around commutator axis 2 and whose cylindrical circumferential faces define<br>
brush running surface 4. Support member 1 is provided with a bore 5 concentric with axis 2 in<br>
order to mount the commutator on a rotor shaft (not illustrated).<br>
Armature parts 6 of conductor segments 3 are embedded in the molding compound of support<br>
member 1 in order to anchor the conductor segments securely even at high speeds, despite the<br>
centripetal forces then occurring. At the ends of conductor segments 3 there are provided<br>
terminal lugs 7, which function in a manner known as such as the terminals of the winding wires<br>
on the commutator.<br>
In the scope explained in the foregoing, the commutator according to Figs. 1 to 3 corresponds to<br>
the long-known prior art, and so no further explanations are needed for understanding in this'<br>
regard.<br>
In the region of end face 8 opposite terminal lugs 7, the commutator is provided with an<br>
interference-suppression device 9. This comprises ten individual, parallelepiped interference-<br>
suppression elements 10 of ceramic material disposed evenly around commutator axis 2, as well<br>
as ten contact bridges 11. These interference-suppression elements 10 are disposed at breaks'<br>
relative to conductor segments 3. Each has a capacitor function and is provided on two mutually<br>
opposite - in the circumferential direction with respect to the installation position in the<br>
commutator - end faces with metallized films 12, which represent contact poles 13 of the<br><br>
interference-suppression element in question. Each interference-suppression element 10 is<br>
housed in a pocket-like seat 14 of support member 1. Each seat 14 is bounded in radially inward<br>
and circumferential direction by a circumferential face 15 and two ribs 16 of a ribbed ring 17,<br>
which is part of support member 1; in radially outward direction, molding-compound projections<br>
18 of support member 1 bound the respective seats 14 for interference-suppression elements 10.<br>
Two conductor segments 3 bear against the outside of each molding-compound projection 18; air<br>
gaps 19, which respectively insulate two adjacent conductor segments 3 from one another, extend<br>
into molding-compound projections 18.<br>
Contact bridges 11 are each disposed spatially between two mutually adjacent interference-<br>
suppression elements 10 and are connected to the associated interference-suppression elements in<br>
the region of end-face contact poles 13. They each comprise a metal strip, which is multiply bent<br>
to form two legs 20 and a foot portion 21 (Fig. 3). In this sense the basic form of the contact<br>
bridges can be described as substantially V-shaped. The multiple bends of contact bridges 11<br>
means that, on the one hand, legs 21 can bear against contact poles 13 of parallelepiped<br>
interference-suppression elements 10, and that, on the other hand, elastic flexibility of the contact<br>
bridges is achieved both in circumferential direction and in radial direction. Contact bridges 11<br>
are firmly connected to interference-suppression elements 10 via one soldered joint 22 each in<br>
the region of legs 20 and to the respective associated conductor segment 3, at the radial inner side<br>
thereof, via a soldered joint 23 in the region of foot portion 21. Seats 14 for interference-<br>
suppression elements 10 are connected to one another by installation spaces 24 for contact<br>
bridges 11, which spaces are configured such that they do not hinder free deformation of contact<br>
bridges 11.<br><br>
As regards its essential geometric features, the second embodiment of the inventive commutator<br>
illustrated in Figs. 4 to 6 corresponds to the embodiment according to Figs. 1 to 3. In order to<br>
avoid repetitions, reference is made to the foregoing explanations.<br>
Nevertheless, interference-suppression device 9' in the commutator according to Figs. 4 to 6 has<br>
geometry substantially different from that in the case of the commutator according to Figs. 1 to 3.<br>
In this case contact bridges 11' are made of plane metal flat stock; the form of contact bridges<br>
11' corresponds approximately to that of a horseshoe forming the two legs 20', with a foot<br>
portion 21' attached thereto in the apex. Contact bridges 11' are disposed in a plane offset axially<br>
relative to parallelepiped interference-suppression elements 10', and their legs 20' bear on<br>
interference-suppression elements 10' in the respective region of metallized contact faces 25<br>
disposed laterally thereon, or in other words in an axial plane of the commutator. There, contact<br>
bridges 11' are firmly connected to interference-suppression elements 10' via soldered joints 26.<br>
Conductor segments 3 are each provided on their inside with a slot-like recess 27, in which the<br>
associated contact bridge 11' engages with its foot portion 21'. At the inner end of recess 27<br>
there is formed a bearing surface 27a for the associated contact bridge 11'. Contact bridges 11'<br>
and conductor segments 3 are each connected firmly to one another by means of a soldered joint<br>
28.<br>
{-'	<br>
In this embodiment also, seats 14' for interference-suppression elements 10' are connected to one<br>
another via installation spaces 24' for contact bridges 11', installation spaces 24' for the contact<br>
bridges having, by virtue of the axial offset of interference-suppression elements 10' and contact<br><br>
bridges 11', a smaller depth than seats 14' for interference-suppression elements 10'.<br>
Expedient geometries of flat commutators designed according to the invention can also be<br>
derived directly from the practical examples illustrated in drawings and explained in the<br>
foregoing, in each case for a drum commutator. A practical example for such a flat commutator<br>
is illustrated in Fig. 7. In a manner known in itself, this flat commutator comprises a support<br>
member 1" made of molding compound and eight conductor segments 3" embedded therein. A<br>
carbon segment 29 is connected to each conductor segment 3" in electrically conductive manner,<br>
the end faces of the carbon segments defining brush running surface 4". Terminal lugs 7" are<br>
disposed on conductor segments 3" on the side of the commutator opposite brush running surface<br>
4".<br>
The commutator is also provided on its side opposite brush running surface 4" with an<br>
interference-suppression device 9". This comprises eight substantially parallelepiped<br>
interference-suppression elements 10" and eight contact bridges 11", each of which is connected<br>
in electrically conductive manner to the two adjacent interference-suppression elements 10" as"<br>
well as to the associated conductor segment 3". Interference-suppression elements 10" are<br>
inserted into corresponding seats 14", which are molded into support member 1". Contact<br>
bridges 11" are inserted into installation spaces 24", each of which connects two adjacent seats<br>
14" to one another, but whose depth compared with seats 14" is smaller by the thickness of<br>
interference-suppression elements 10". Incidentally, interference-suppression device 9"<br>
implemented in the flat commutator illustrated in Fig. 7 has a structure corresponding to that of<br>
the interference-suppression device of the drum commutator according to Figs. 4 to 6. In order to<br><br>
avoid repetitions, reference is made to the explanations concerning that commutator. The same<br>
applies with regard to manufacture of the commutator.<br><br>
