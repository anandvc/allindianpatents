Spot-type Disc Brake<br>
The present invention relates to a spot-type disc brake, in<br>
particular for a motor vehicle, with a housing comprising a housing bridge, a first housing leg having an actuating unit and a second, outboard housing leg. In this arrangement, each one brake shoe with brake lining and back plate, acting upon a brake disc, is fitted at the inside surfaces of the housing legs. The housing and the brake shoes are slidably mounted on a mounting support on the vehicle in the direction of an axis of movement of the actuating unit. Further, a hold-down spring is provided on the side of the actuating unit between an abutment surface in the housing bridge and the brake shoe, the said spring preloading the brake shoe in relation to the mounting support and the abutment surface in order to prevent the brake shoe from rattling on the mounting support,<br>
DE 25 58 141 Al discloses a corresponding spot-type disc brake, which includes a piston-and-cylinder unit as actuating unit. When the brake is operated, the piston moves out of the cylinder and pushes the piston-side brake shoe against the brake disc until it abuts thereon. Now the piston-and-cylinder unit and the piston-side housing leg, respectively, moves away from the brake disc and pulls the opposite housing leg in the direction of the disc side there. As a result, the other brake shoe is also pressed against the brake disc, and both brake<br><br>
shoes exert a normal force on the brake disc. When the brake is released, hydraulic pressure does not prevail in the piston-and-cylinder unit, and the brake shoes exert no longer normal force on the brake disc. However, they still bear against the brake disc and, induced by friction, produce a residual brake torque, the so-called residual moment. In addition, the pads are thermally loaded to an increased degree, because no air flow develops between pad and disc, and pad and disc are not uncoupled thermally.<br>
In view of the above, an object of the invention is to<br>
disclose a spot-type disc brake with a hold-down spring, which exhibits an improved clearance behavior of the brake shoes, that means that the residual moment is reduced and, further, pad and disc are uncoupled thermally.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved in that the abutment surface of the hold-down spring in the housing bridge is arranged anti-parallel to the axis of movement, along which the movable component of the actuating unit is moving. Thus, not only a radial preloading force is produced, which presses the brake shoe against the mounting support, but also a force component normal thereto. This fact assists the retracting movement of the brake shoe and the moving component of the actuating unit away from the brake disc and improves the clearance behavior because a small air slot develops between brake shoe and brake disc.<br>
A favorable embodiment of the invention teaches that an angle<br>
a  greater than 0° is provided between the abutment surface and the axis of movement, and the angle a.  lies in a plane defined<br><br>
by the axis of movement and by a force vector of the resulting spring force FF. The result is that the spring, in addition to the radial preloading force FR, produces an axial force component Fx in parallel to the axis of movement, which returns the piston and the piston-side brake shoe into their initial position and, thus, improves the clearance operation.<br>
It has shown that the force component Fx that is in parallel to the axis of movement acts particularly effectively with regard to the clearance behavior when the angle a is greater than roughly 1.5°.<br>
In an especially favorable embodiment of the invention, the<br>
angle ex is limited to an area of approximately 1.5° to 11°. When the angle a.  exceeds 11 °, the radial preloading force FR of the brake shoe will decrease in favor of the force component Fx that is in parallel to the axis of movement to such an extent<br>
that no unfavorable operating performance results therefrom.<br>
Due to the material combination of hold-down spring and<br>
housing bridge and because of the ambient conditions in the application, the contact area between hold-down spring and abutment surface is exposed to major corrosion. Therefore, it proves particularly favorable when at least one small, spotlike contact area is provided between the hold-down spring and abutment surface in the housing bridge in order to minimize the corrosion element and thereby reduce the corrosion.<br>
To allow low-cost manufacture of the disc brake described above, abutment surface and housing bridge have an integral design. Additional costs  of manufacture are not incurred due<br><br>
to the fact that abutment surface and housing bridge are produced in one casting operation.<br>
In another favorable embodiment of the invention, abutment surface and housing bridge have a multi-part design. It can thus be ensured that, with an appropriate material selection, wear and/or corrosion of the abutment surface and spring can be slowed down when either especially hard and/or corrosion-inhibiting materials are used.<br>
Furthermore, advantages with respect to the costs of manufacture are achieved when wire or leaf springs are used as hold-down springs because they can be procured in large quantities at favorable conditions due to their simple type of<br>
construction.<br>
Further advantages of the invention become apparent especially<br>
when using hydraulic or electro-mechanical actuating units. Since only one active moving direction is mostly possible in a hydraulic actuating unit, there is no hydraulic retracting force for piston and brake shoe at all, with the result that the axial retracting force component Fx of the spring force FF is of great significance with regard to the functions of the brake. The force component Fx becomes especially necessary in the event of electromechanical actuation in case the actuating unit fails and is then no longer able to withdraw the brake shoe.<br>
Further details of the invention can be taken from the<br>
drawings by way of the description.<br><br>
In the accompanying drawings:<br>
Figure 1 is a first embodiment of the invention in a cross-section through a spot-type disc brake taken along line II-II;<br>
Figure 2 is another view of the above-mentioned embodiment taken along the line of intersection I-I; and<br>
Figure 3 is a perspective view of a spot-type disc brake according to another embodiment, in which the<br>
abutment surfaces are configured as add-on pieces.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 represent a first embodiment of a spot-type<br>
disc brake 1 in two sectional views. The spot-type disc brake 1 comprises a housing 2, which is composed of a first housing leg 6, a housing bridge 3, and a second housing leg 7 that is on the outside with respect to the housing. In this embodiment, a piston-and-cylinder unit 4, 5 is provided in the first housing leg 6, and a back plate 8 of a brake shoe 21 with brake lining 9 abuts on the piston 4 and is fixed there. Provided on the outboard housing leg 7 is another brake shoe 22 with back plate 10 and brake lining 11. The brake shoes 21, 22 act on parts of a brake disc (not shown). Housing 2 and brake shoes 21, 22 and their back plates 8, 10, respectively, are slidably mounted on two arms 27, 28 of a mounting support 12 in parallel to the axis of movement 13 of the piston-and-cylinder unit 4, 5. The housing 2 with the piston-side housing leg 6 is seated on two pins 20, 25 screwed into the mounting support 12. A spring 26 pulls the outboard housing leg 7 onto the arms 27, 28 of the mounting support (Figure 3), whereby<br><br>
the brake shoe 22 is braced between the arms 27, 28 of the holder 12 and the housing bridge 3. Similarly, the brake shoe 21 with the back plate 8 is also slidably supported on the arms 27, 28 of the mounting support 12. To prevent rattling noise, bracing of the brake shoe 21 between the arms 27, 28 and the housing bridge 3 is produced by the hold-down spring 14. Spring 14 in this embodiment is fixed in an accommodation 29 on the back plate 8 of the brake shoe 21 and presses with two spring arms 30, 31 against two abutment surfaces 15, 16. As this occurs, only a spot-like contact 17, 32 is constituted between the spring arms 30, 31 and abutment surfaces 15, 16 in order to minimize the corrosion element that develops. The abutment surfaces 15, 16 are inclined at an angle a with regard to the axis of movement 13 of the piston-and-cylinder unit 4, 5, with the angle a lying in a plane that is defined at the accommodation by the axis of movement 13 and by a force vector of the of the resulting spring force FF. A radial preloading force FR, which acts perpendicular to the arms 27, 28 of the mounting support 12, ensues thereby from the spring force FF. In addition, an axial force component Fx that is in parallel to the axis of movement 13 is achieved, which acts on the piston 4 and the brake shoe 21. It should be noted that the mounting support 12 is provided also directly at the wheel suspension or at the spring strut of a vehicle, forming a component part therewith.<br>
Embodiments are also feasible in which only one abutment surface or several abutment surfaces are provided in the housing bridge 3. The hold-down spring is then required to be configured accordingly in such a way that it develops, in interaction with one or more abutment surfaces, an axial force<br><br>
component Fx of the spring force FF, which is in parallel to the axis of movement 13 of the piston-and-cylinder unit 4, 5. It is exclusively significant in the configuration of one or more abutment surfaces that they are inclined at a determined angle a  relative to the axis of movement 13, thus, acting as axial sliding slope(s), with the angle a lying in a plane, which is defined by the axis of movement 13 and by a force vector of the resulting spring force FF.<br>
Figure 3 shows a perspective view of a spot-type disc brake 1 according to another embodiment, in which the abutment surfaces 15, 16 are realized as add-on pieces 18, 19. For better view of the arrangement, except for the piston-side back plate 8, both brake shoes are not shown. It thus becomes apparent in which manner the housing 2 with the housing leg 6 is displaceably attached on the mounting support 12 by way of the pins 20 and 25 and the brake shoes are braced between the abutment surfaces 15, 16 of the housing bridge 3 and the arms 27, 28 of the mounting support 12. Only the back plate 8, which abuts on the arms 27, 28, is illustrated in Figure 3 representative of the brake shoe 21 as a whole. Fixed on the accommodation 29 of the back plate 8 is spring 14, which supports the back plate 8 with both spring arms 30, 31 in relation to the abutment surfaces 15, 16 or the add-on pieces 18, 19, respectively, bracing it with the arms 27, 28 of the mounting support 12. The add-on pieces 18, 19 are screwed to the housing bridge by means of screws 23, 24. However, other fixing provisions such as by way of positive and frictional engagement and by molecular bond, or any other connections, are also feasible without departing from the spirit of the invention. It is only relevant in this case that the abutment<br><br>
surfaces are formed of separate components, which bring about an axial force component Fx in interaction with the hold-down<br>
spring 14.<br>
The function of the spot-type brake disc 1 is as follows: The brake shoes 21, 22 are arranged between the housing 2 and the mounting support 12, and a hold-down spring 14 preloads the piston-side brake shoe 21 relative to the abutment surfaces 15, 16, pressing it against the arms 27, 28 of the mounting support 12 in order to prevent rattling noise. Due to the angle a of the abutment surface 15, 16, an axial force component Fx being in parallel to the axis of movement 13 results from the spring force FF of the hold-down spring 14 relative to the radial preloading force FR. When the brake is applied, hydraulic pressure develops in the piston-and-cylinder unit 4, 5, shifting the piston 4 out of the cylinder<br>
5.	The brake shoe 21 is hereby caused to move towards the<br>
brake disc until its lining 9 abuts thereon. Consequently, the<br>
piston-and-cylinder unit 4, 5 or the piston-side housing leg<br>
6,	respectively, moves away from the brake disc and pulls the<br>
opposite housing leg 7 via the housing bridge 3 in the<br>
direction of the brake disc side there. Hence, the other brake<br>
shoe 22 is also pressed against the brake disc, and both brake<br>
shoes 21, 22 exert a normal force on parts of the contact<br>
surfaces of the brake disc. When the brake is released,<br>
pressure is no longer applied to the piston-and-cylinder unit<br>
4, 5, and the axial component Fx of the spring force FF, being<br>
in parallel to the axis of movement 13, shifts piston 4 and<br>
brake shoe 21 away from the brake disc into their initial<br>
position. It is thus ensured that the brake shoe 21 will not<br>
slide on the brake disc after the brake operation, thereby<br><br>
avoiding an unfavorable braking residual moment. Thus, the clearance behavior of the brake is significantly improved.<br><br>
