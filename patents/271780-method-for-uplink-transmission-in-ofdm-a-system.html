BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a wireless<br>
communication system, and more particularly, to a method for<br>
uplink transmission in an OFDM(A) wireless communication<br>
system.<br>
Discussion of the Related Art<br>
A current IEEE 802.16e system uses a tile and pilot<br>
structure as shown in FIG. 1 as an uplink Partial Usage of<br>
Subchannel (PUSC) structure. One transmit antenna is<br>
considered in the structure of FIG. 1. This uplink PUSC<br>
basic unit structure has a pilot overhead of 33.33%. In Fig.<br>
1, the pilot and data subcarriers refer to resource elements<br>
(REs) allocated for pilot and data respectively. Each RE<br>
represents a time-freauency resource defined by one OFDM(A)<br>
symbol and one subcarrier. In the following description, the<br>
terms "pilot subcarrier" and "data subcarrier" can be<br>
interchanged with the terms "pilot RE" and "data RE"<br>
respectively.<br>
Since only one transmit antenna is considered in the<br>
uplink tile structure used in the current IEEE 802.16e system,<br>
the uplink PUSC basic unit structure has a pilot overhead of<br>
33.33%. Thus, the ratio of pilot overhead to data is<br>
significant. Such pilot overhead reduces link throughput,<br>
causing a reduction in system performance. When an extended<br>
basic unit is employed as in IEEE 802.16m, one issue is to<br>
reduce pilot overhead.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a<br>
method for uplink transmission in an OFDM(A) system that<br>
substantially obviates one or more problems due to<br>
limitations and disadvantages of the related art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an<br>
uplink transmission method which can reduce pilot overhead<br>
and guarantee channel estimation performance even when the<br>
size of a basic unit for uplink has been extended in a time<br>
axis.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an<br>
uplink transmission method which guarantees backward<br>
compatibility for an IEEE 802.16e system.<br>
Additional advantages, objects, and features of the<br>
invention will be set forth in part in the description which<br>
follows and in part will become apparent to those having<br>
ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following<br>
or may be learned from practice of the invention. The<br>
objectives and other advantages of the invention may be<br>
realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed<br>
out in the written description and claims hereof as well as<br>
the appended drawings.<br>
In legacy IEEE 802.16e system, an uplink PUSC tile<br>
contains four contiguous subcarriers by three contiguous<br>
OFDM(A) symbols. The legacy IEEE 802.16e system applies<br>
permutation to distribute the uplink PUSC tiles within the<br>
corresponding frequency band in the procedure of mapping the<br>
uplink PUSC tiles to physical subcarriers. In particular,<br>
the permutation method configures every three OFDM(A) symbols<br>
to have the same logical tile index, whereby the uplink PUSC<br>
tiles can be spread within corresponding frequency band.<br>
Such permutation method could be easily modified for an<br>
extended tile structure by configuring multiplies of three<br>
OFDM(A) symbols, e.g. six, nine or twelve OFDM(A) symbols,<br>
which is contiguous in time domain and is within the same<br>
physical frequency band to have the same logical tile index.<br>
As such, the permutation method of the legacy IEEE 802.16e<br>
system could be extended to distribute radio resource in<br>
units of multiplies of three OFDM(A) symbols. Therefore it<br>
is preferable that IEEE 802.16m system under discussion forms<br>
uplink tile with four subcarrier by multiplies of three<br>
OFDM(A) symbols in case of supporting the legacy IEEE 802.16e<br>
system via frequency division multiplexing (FDM).<br>
In IEEE 802.16m system under discussion, basic frame<br>
structure includes a 20ms superframe supporting 5 MHz,8.75<br>
MHz 10 MHz, or 20 MHz bandwidth. Each superframe is divided<br>
into four equally-sized 5 ms radio frames and begins with the<br>
superframe header (SFH). Each 5 ms radio frame further<br>
consists of eight subframes. A subframe shall be assigned<br>
for either DL or UL transmission. There are three types of<br>
subframes depending on the size of cyclic prefix, i.e.<br>
subframe consisting of five, six or seven OFDM(A) symbols.<br>
The subframe carries smaller resource units with various<br>
types/sizes. The basic frame structure is applied to FDD and<br>
TDD duplexing schemes.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible,<br>
the same reference numbers will be used throughout the<br>
drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
The embodiments of the present invention provide a basic<br>
unit and a pilot structure which can reduce pilot overhead in<br>
uplink in an OFDM (A) system and can also guarantee high<br>
performance of channel estimation. In the embodiments of the<br>
present invention, pilot REs are allocated on the time axis<br>
in each basic unit taking into consideration coherent time so<br>
as to enable channel estimation that is robust to the low<br>
speed and high speed cases in the time domain in the basic<br>
unit. In addition, pilot REs are allocated on the frequency<br>
axis in each basic unit taking into consideration coherent<br>
bandwidth so as to achieve channel estimation that is robust<br>
to various delay spread in the frequency domain. The<br>
embodiments of the present invention also provide a basic<br>
unit and a pilot structure which can improve channel<br>
estimation performance using pilots of consecutive basic<br>
units which are allocated in the time/frequency axis.<br>
FIG. 2A illustrates an example wherein 1Tx or 1 stream<br>
pilots are allocated when each basic unit includes 4<br>
subcarriers x 3 OFDM(A) symbols according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. In each 4x3 basic unit, two pilot REs<br>
are arranged and pilot overhead is 16.57%. 4x3 basic units<br>
can be consecutively allocated on the frequency axis or the<br>
time axis.<br>
If two pilot REs are used per 4x3 basic unit, it is<br>
possible to reduce pilot overhead to half of that of the<br>
conventional IEEE 802.16e uplink PUSC structure. In order to<br>
guarantee robust channel estimation performance for both the<br>
low speed user case and high speed user case, it is<br>
preferable to arrange pilot REs in a 4x3 basic unit in a<br>
distributed manner at both ends (i.e., the first and third<br>
symbols) on the time axis in the 4x3 basic unit. In addition,<br>
in order to guarantee robust channel estimation performance<br>
taking into consideration frequency selectivity in channel<br>
estimation on the frequency axis, it is preferable to<br>
allocate pilot REs to both ends (i.e., the first and fourth<br>
subcarriers) on the frequency axis in a 4x3 basic unit.<br>
It can be seen from the left side of FIG. 2A that, in<br>
each 4x3 basic unit, pilot REs are located at a subcarrier<br>
index of "0" when s=0 and at a subcarrier index of "3" when<br>
s=2. Here, the subcarrier index is an integer of no less<br>
than 0, which increases from top to bottom and OFDM(A) symbol<br>
index "s" is an integer of no less than 0, which increases<br>
from left to right.<br>
It can also be seen from the right side of FIG. 2A that,<br>
in each 4x3 basic unit, pilot REs are located at a subcarrier<br>
index of "3" when s=0 and at a subcarrier index of "0" when<br>
s=2. The locations of the pilot REs can be cyclically<br>
shifted along the time axis or the frequency axis. These<br>
pilot patterns are summarized in the following tables.<br>

indicates the data RE, "s" indicates an OFDM (A) symbol index<br>

streams pilot REs are arranged for each antenna port and<br>
total pilot overhead is 16.57%, 4x6 basic units can be<br>
consecutively allocated on the frequency axis or the time<br>
axis. Pilot REs for the antenna port 0 are located at a<br>
subcarrier index of "0" when s=0 and at a subcarrier index of<br>
"3" when s=5. Pilot REs for the antenna port 1 are located<br>

index of "0" when s=3. In another example, pilot REs for the<br>
antenna port 0 are located at a subcarrier index of "3" when<br>

the antenna port 1 are located at a subcarrier index of '"'0"<br>
when s=2 and at a subcarrier index of "3" when s=3. The<br>
antenna ports 0 and 1 may be switched with each other. That<br>
is, the antenna ports 0 and 1 may be replaced with each other.<br>
For example. Pilot REs for the antenna port 0 are located at<br>
a subcarrier index of "3" when s=2 and at a subcarrier index<br>
of "0" when s=3. And Pilot REs for the antenna port 1 are<br>
located at a subcarrier index of '0" when s=0 and at a<br>
subcarrier index of "3" when s=5.<br>

FIGs. 8A-8C illustrate an example wherein 1Tx or 1<br>
stream, 2Tx or 2 streams, and 4Tx or 4 streams pilots are<br>
allocated when each basic unit includes 4 subcarriers x 6<br>
OFDM(A) symbols according to another embodiment of the<br>
present invention. 4x5 basic units can be consecutively<br>
allocated on the frequency axis or the time axis.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8A, if two pilot REs are used per 4x6<br>
basic unit, it is possible to reduce pilot overhead to half<br>
of that of the conventional IEEE 802.16e uplink PUSC<br>
structure. In order to guarantee robust channel estimation<br>
performance for the low speed user case, it is preferable to<br>
arrange pilots in a 4x6 basic unit in a distributed manner at<br>
both ends on the time axis in the 4x6 basic unit. In<br>
addition, in order to guarantee robust channel estimation<br>
performance taking into consideration frequency selectivity<br>
in channel estimation on the frequency axis, it is preferable<br>
to allocate pilots to a 4x5 basic unit at both ends (i.e.,<br>
the first and fourth subcarriers) on the frequency axis in<br>
the 4x6 basic unit. In each 4x6 basic unit, pilot REs are<br>
located at a subcarrier index of "0" and at a subcarrier<br>
index of "3" when s=0 and are located at a subcarrier index<br>
of "0" and at a subcarrier index of "3" when s=5. The<br>
locations of the pilot REs can be cyclically shifted along<br>
the time axis or the frequency axis. These pilot patterns<br>
are summarized in the following table.<br><br>
In Table 40, "P" indicates the pilot RE, '-" indicates<br>
the data RE, "s" indicates an OFDM(A) symbol index in the<br>
basic unit, and "SC" indicates a subcarrier index in the<br>
basic unit.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8B, in the 4x6 basic unit, two 2Tx or 2<br>
streams pilot REs are arranged for each antenna port and<br>
total pilot overhead is 16.67%. Pilot REs for the antenna<br>
port 0 are located at a subcarrier index of "0" when s=0 and<br>
at a subcarrier index of "3" when s=5. Pilot REs for the<br>
antenna port 1 are located at a subcarrier index of "3" when<br>
s=0 and at a subcarrier index of "0" when s=5. The antenna<br>
ports may be switched with each other. The locations of the<br>
pilot REs can be cyclically shifted along the time axis or<br>
the frequency axis. These pilot patterns are summarized in<br>
the following table.<br><br>
In Table 41, "P0" and "P1" indicate respective pilot REs<br>
for the antenna ports 0 and 1, "-" indicates the data RE, "s"<br>
indicates an OFDM(A) symbol index in the basic unit, and "SC"<br>
indicates a subcarrier index in the basic unit.<br>
These pilot patterns are especially preferable for<br>
uplink transmission with 2Tx antennas or 2 streams for the<br>
following reasons.<br>
First, in the case of a wireless communication system<br>
which supports Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) technologies,<br>
the pilot patterns of FIG. 8B can efficiently support Space<br>
Time Block Code (STBC) and Space Frequency Block Code (STBC).<br>
To support STBC, subcarriers for transmission of control<br>
information and data, excluding pilots, should constitute an<br>
even number of OFDM(A) symbols on the time axis. Especially,<br>
consecutively allocating paired OFDM(A) symbols in each<br>
subcarrier unit can achieve a further improvement in STBC<br>
performance. This is because that, in STBC, a high gain can<br>
be achieved if channels that paired OFDM(A) symbols in each<br>
subcarrier unit experience are identical or similar.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8B, OFDM(A) symbols in each subcarrier unit,<br>
excluding pilots, are consecutive on the time axis and are<br>
also even in number. To support SFBC, the number of<br>
subcarriers for transmission of control information and data,<br>
excluding pilots, should be even on the frequency axis.<br>
Especially, consecutively allocating paired subcarriers in<br>
each OFDM(A) symbol can achieve a further improvement in SFBC<br>
performance. This is because that, in SFBC, a high gain can<br>
be achieved if channels that paired subcarriers experience<br>
are identical or similar. Referring to FIG. 8B, subcarriers<br>
excluding pilots in each OFDM(A) symbol are consecutive and<br>
are also even in number. The pilot patterns of FIG. 8B can<br>
effectively support the MIMO system.<br>
Second, since pilots for the antenna ports 0 and 1 are<br>
allocated to the same OFDM (A) symbol, it is possible to<br>
improve performance of channel estimation through pilot<br>
boosting. For example, when data and pilots for the antenna<br>
port 0 are transmitted, no pilot REs for the antenna port 1<br>
are transmitted. In this case, power for allocation to the<br>
pilots for the antenna port 1 can be additionally allocated<br>
to the pilots for the antenna port 0. This can improve<br>
performance of channel estimation through pilot boosting.<br>
This also helps in solving the power balancing problem in<br>
uplink transmission with limited available power.<br>
Third, it is possible to perform efficient channel<br>
estimation using as much coherent time and coherent bandwidth<br>
as possible. Specifically, even in an environment in which<br>
channel delay spread is significant, channels almost never<br>
change or only slightly change in 4 consecutive subcarrier<br>
units. Unless the terminal is in motion at high speed,<br>
channel change is not great in 6 or less consecutive OFDM (A)<br>
symbols. In addition, even when the speed of the terminal is<br>
increased such that it experiences a high-speed channel, the<br>
channel linearly changes in 6 or less consecutive OFDM(A)<br>
symbols. Referring to FIG. 8B, 2 pilots for each of the<br>
antenna ports 0 and 1 are located at both diagonal ends of a<br>
4x6 basic unit. This utilizes as much coherent time and<br>
coherent bandwidth as possible, thereby achieving efficient<br>
channel estimation.<br>
Fourth, since pilots are allocated to each 4x6 basic<br>
unit at edges thereof, it is possible to prevent degradation<br>
of channel estimation performance due to extrapolation during<br>
channel estimation.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8C, in the 4x6 basic unit, two 4Tx or 4<br>
streams pilot REs are arranged for each antenna port and<br>
total pilot overhead is 33.34%. Pilot REs for the antenna<br>
port 0 are located at a subcarrier index of "0" when s=0 and<br>
at a subcarrier index of "3" when s=5. Pilot REs for the<br>
antenna port 1 are located at a subcarrier index of "3" when<br>
s=0 and at a subcarrier index of "0" when s=5. Pilot REs for<br>
the antenna port 2 are located at a subcarrier index of "1"<br>
when s=0 and at a subcarrier index of "2" when s=5. Pilot<br>
REs for the antenna port 3 are located at a subcarrier index<br>
of "2" when s=0 and at a subcarrier index of "1" when s=5.<br>
The antenna ports may be switched with each other. The<br>
locations of the pilot REs can be cyclically shifted along<br>
the time axis or the frequency axis. These pilot patterns<br>
are summarized in the following table.<br><br>
In Table 42, "P0" to "P3" indicate respective pilot REs<br>
for the antenna ports 0 to 3, "-" indicates the data RE, "s"<br>
indicates an OFDM(A) symbol index in the basic unit, and "SC"<br>
indicates a subcarrier index in the basic unit.<br>
FIGs. 9A-9C illustrates an example wherein 1Tx or 1<br>
stream, 2Tx or 2 streams, and 4Tx or 4 streams pilots are<br>
allocated when each basic unit includes 4 subcarriers x 6<br>
OFDM(A) symbols according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. 4x6 basic units can be consecutively allocated on<br>
the frequency axis or the time axis.<br>
As shown in FIG. 9A, pilot REs are located at a<br>
subcarrier index of "0" when s=0, at a subcarrier index of<br>
"3" when s=1, at a subcarrier index of "0" when s=4, and at a<br>
subcarrier index of "3" when s=5. In another example, pilot<br>
REs are located at a subcarrier index of "3" when s=0, at a<br>
subcarrier index of "0" when s=1, at a subcarrier index of<br>
"3" when s=4, and at a subcarrier index of "0" when s=5. The<br>
locations of the pilot REs can be cyclically shifted along<br>
the time axis or the frequency axis. These pilot patterns<br>
are summarized in the following tables.<br><br>
In Tables 43 and 44, "P" indicates the pilot RE, "-"<br>
indicates the data RE, "s" indicates an OFDM(A) symbol index<br>
in the basic unit, and "SC" indicates a subcarrier index in<br>
the basic unit.<br>
These pilot patterns are especially preferable for<br>
uplink transmission with a 1Tx antenna or 1 stream for the<br>
following reasons.<br>
First, the pilot patterns have a structure suitable for<br>
achieving a channel estimation gain through pilot boosting.<br>
In the case of the pilot patterns of FIG. 9A, pilot REs are<br>
located at different OFDM(A) symbols on the time axis.<br>
Accordingly, when pilot REs and data REs are simultaneously<br>
transmitted or pilot REs alone are transmitted, it is<br>
possible to improve channel estimation performance through<br>
pilot boosting effects. That is, a portion of power for<br>
allocation to data REs can be allocated to pilot REs, thereby<br>
achieving a performance gain through pilot boosting. However,<br>
in the case where a number of pilots for a single antenna are<br>
allocated to the same OFDM(A) symbol, the performance<br>
improvement is not great since limited power of data REs is<br>
distributed over a number of pilots. Specifically, in the<br>
case of the pilot patterns of FIG. 9A, a portion of power for<br>
allocation to 3 data REs in one OFDM (A) symbol is allocated<br>
to pilot REs, thereby achieving a performance gain through<br>
pilot boosting. However, in the case where 2 pilot REs are<br>
included in one OFDM (A) symbol, power for use in 2 data REs<br>
is allocated to 2 pilot REs and therefore the improvement of<br>
performance through pilot boosting is small, compared to when<br>
one pilot RE is included in one OFDM(A) symbol. Especially,<br>
taking into consideration the fact that uplink power is<br>
limited, the use of one pilot RE in one OFDM (A) symbol helps<br>
in solving the power balancing problem.<br>
Second, it is possible to perform efficient channel<br>
estimation using as much coherent time and coherent bandwidth<br>
as possible. Specifically, even when channel delay spread is<br>
significant, the coherent bandwidth is 4 or more subcarriers<br>
and thus the channel almost never changes or only slightly<br>
changes in 4 consecutive subcarriers. In addition, even when<br>
the speed of the terminal is increased such that it<br>
experiences a high-speed channel, the coherent time is 3 or<br>
more OFDM(A) symbols and thus the channel changes in units of<br>
3 or more OFDM(A) symbols (i.e., the channel almost never<br>
changes in 3 consecutive OFDM(A) symbols). In the pilot<br>
patterns of FIG. 9A, pilots are arranged such that the pilot<br>
spacing is maximized on the frequency axis and the time axis.<br>
Specifically, the pilot spacing is 3 subcarriers on the<br>
frequency axis and is 1 and 3 OFDM (A) symbols on the time<br>
axis. Accordingly, as much coherent time and coherent<br>
bandwidth can be utilized as possible, thereby improving<br>
channel estimation performance.<br>
As shown in FIG. 9B, in the 4x6 basic unit, two 2Tx or 2<br>
streams pilot REs are arranged for each antenna port and<br>
total pilot overhead is 15.67%. Pilot REs for the antenna<br>
port 0 are located at a subcarrier index of "0" when s=0 and<br>
at a subcarrier index of '3" when s=5. Pilot REs for the<br>
antenna port 1 are located at a subcarrier index of "3" when<br>
s=1 and at a subcarrier index of "0" when s=4. In another<br>
example, pilot REs for the antenna port 0 are located at a<br>
subcarrier index of "3" when s=0 and at a subcarrier index of<br>
"0" when s=5. Pilot REs for the antenna port 1 are located<br>
at a subcarrier index of "0" when s=1 and at a subcarrier<br>

such that they are arranged at intervals of 2 OFDM(A) symbols<br>
on the time axis so as to achieve greater robustness in the<br>

high speed case than in the low speed case. In addition,<br>
pilots are designed such that they are arranged at all<br>
positions on the frequency axis, thereby achieving greater<br>
robustness to channel delay spread. Here, pilot overhead is<br>
11,11%. 4x9 basic units can be consecutively allocated on<br>
the frequency axis or the time axis. Although FIG, 12 is<br>
illustrated for pilots for a single antenna, the pilot<br>
pattern of FIG. 12 can also be applied to multiple antennas<br>
in a manner similar to that illustrated in FIGs. 2 to 9.<br>
Specifically, pilot REs are located at a subcarrier<br>
index of "1" when s=1, at a subcarrier index of "3" when s=3,<br>
at a subcarrier index of "0" when s=5, and at a subcarrier<br>
index of "2" when s=7. In another example, pilot REs are<br>
located at a subcarrier index of "2" when s=1, at a<br>
subcarrier index of "0" when s=3, at a subcarrier index of<br>
"3" when s=5, and at a subcarrier index of "1" when s=7. The<br>
locations of the pilot REs can be cyclically shifted along<br>
the time axis or the frequency axis. These pilot patterns<br>
are summarized in the following table.<br><br><br>
In Tables 52 and 53, "P" indicates the pilot RE, "-"<br>
indicates the data RE, "s" indicates an OFDM (A) symbol index<br>
in the basic unit, and "SC" indicates a subcarrier index in<br>
the basic unit.<br>
FIG. 13 illustrates an example wherein 1Tx or 1 stream<br>
pilots are allocated when each basic unit includes 4<br>
subcarriers x 9 OFDM(A) symbols according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Pilot REs are designed<br>
such that they are arranged at intervals of 2 OFDM(A) symbols<br>
on the time axis so as to achieve greater robustness in the<br>
high speed case than in the low speed case. In addition,<br>
pilots are designed such that they are arranged at all<br>
positions on the frequency axis, thereby achieving greater<br>
robustness to channel delay spread. Here, pilot overhead is<br>
11.11%. 4x9 basic units can be consecutively allocated on<br>
the frequency axis or the time axis. Although FIG. 13 is<br>
illustrated for pilots for a single antenna, the pilot<br>
pattern of FIG. 13 can also be applied to multiple antennas<br>
in a manner similar to that illustrated in FIGs. 2 to 9.<br>
Specifically, pilot REs are located at a subcarrier<br>
index of "0" when s=0, at a subcarrier index of "3" when s=3,<br>
at a subcarrier index of "0" when s=5, and at a subcarrier<br>
index of "3" when s=8. In another example, pilot REs are<br>
located at a subcarrier index of "3" when s=0, at a<br>
subcarrier index of "0" when s=3, at a subcarrier index of<br>
"3" when s=5, and at a subcarrier index of "0" when s=8. The<br>
locations of the pilot REs can be cyclically shifted along<br>
the time axis or the frequency axis. These pilot patterns<br>
are summarized in the following table.<br><br>
In Tables 54 and 55, "P" indicates the pilot RE, "-"<br>
indicates the data RE, "s" indicates an OFDM(A) symbol index<br>
in the basic unit, and "SC" indicates a subcarrier index in<br>
the basic unit.<br>
In order to measure the channel estimation ability of<br>
the above pilot patterns xemplified by the present invention,<br>

stream and two streams transmissions.<br>
The pilot pilot pattern used in the comparative<br>
simulation are shown in the following table:<br>

applied to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 16, the base station generally includes<br>
a control system 1602, a baseband processor 1604, transmit<br>
circuitry 1606, receive circuitry 1608, multiple antennas<br>
1510, and a network interface 1612. The receive circuitry<br>
1508 receives a radio signal transmitted from a terminal<br>
through the multiple antennas 1610. Preferably, a low-noise<br>
amplifier and a filter (not shown) amplify the received<br>
signal and remove broadband interference from the signal.<br>
Downconversion and digitization circuitry (not shown)<br>

baseband frequency signal and then digitizes the<br>
downconverted signal into one or more digital streams.<br>
The baseband processor 1504 processes the digital<br>
received signal to extract information or data bits from the<br>
received signal. This processing includes demodulation,<br>
decoding, error correction, or the like. The baseband<br>
processor 1604 generally includes one or more Digital Signal<br>
Processors (DSPs). Thereafter, the received information is<br>
transmitted through a wireless network via a network<br>
interface or is transmitted to another terminal served by the<br>
base station. The network interface 1612 interacts with a<br>
circuit switched network that forms a part of a wireless<br>
network that can be connected to a Public Switched Telephone<br>
Network (PSTN) and a central network controller.<br>
On the transmitting side, the baseband processor 1604<br>
receives digital data, which can represent voice, data, or<br>
control information, from the network interface 1612, and<br>
encodes the data for transmission under control of the<br>
control system 1602. The encoded data is input to the<br>
transmit circuitry 1606. The transmit circuitry 1606<br>
modulates the encoded data using a carrier having a desired<br>
transmission frequency(s) . The amplifier (not shown)<br>
amplifies the modulated carrier signal to a level suitable<br>
for transmission. The amplified signal is transmitted to the<br>
multiple antennas 1610.<br>
FIG. 17 is a block diagram of a terminal that can be<br>
applied to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 17, the terminal may include a control<br>
system 1702, a baseband processor 1704, transmit circuitry<br>
1706, receive circuitry 1708, multiple antennas 1710, and<br>
user interface circuitry 1712. The receive circuitry 1708<br>
receives a radio signal including information from one or<br>
more base stations through the multiple antennas 1710.<br>
Preferably, a low-noise amplifier and a filter (not shown)<br>
amplify the received signal and remove broadband interference<br>
from the signal. Thereafter, downconversion and digitization<br>
circuitry (not shown) downconverts the filtered signal to an<br>
intermediate or baseband frequency signal and then digitizes<br>
the downconverted signal into one or more digital streams.<br>
The baseband processor 1704 processes the digital received<br>
signal to extract information or data bits from the received<br>
signal. This processing includes operations such as<br>
demodulation, decoding, and error correction. The baseband<br>
processor 1704 generally includes one or more Digital Signal<br>
Processors (DSPs) and Application Specific Integrated<br>
Circuits (ASICs).<br>
On the transmitting side, the baseband processor 1704<br>
receives digital data, which can represent voice, data, or<br>
control information, from the user interface circuitry 1712,<br>
and encodes the data for transmission under control of the<br>
control system 1702. The encoded data is input to the<br>
transmit circuitry 1706. The transmit circuitry 1706<br>
modulates the encoded data using a carrier having a desired<br>

FIG. 18 illustrates a block diagram of a transmitter<br>
that can be applied to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Although the structure of the transmitter of FIG, 18<br>
will be described with reference to a base station, it will<br>
be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the<br>
illustrated structure can be used for both uplink and<br>
downlink transmission. The illustrated transmission<br>
structure is intended to represent, without being limited to,<br>
a variety of multiple access structures including Code<br>
Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Frequency Division Multiple<br>
Access (FDMA), and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing<br>
(OFDM).<br>
Initially, the network transmits data for transmission<br>
to a terminal to the base station. In the base station, a<br>
data scrambling module 1804 scrambles scheduled data, which<br>
is a bitstream, in a manner reducing a peak to average power<br>
ratio associated with data. A CRC adding module 1806 then<br>
determines and adds a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) checksum<br>
for the scrambled data to the scrambled data. Then, a<br>
channel encoder module 1808 performs channel coding on the<br>
data to allow the terminal to perform recovery and error<br>
correction of the data. The channel coding enables efficient<br>
addition of redundancy to the data. The channel encoder<br>
module 1808 can use turbo encoding technologies.<br>
Then, a mapping module 1814 systematically maps the<br>
processed data bits to a corresponding symbol based on a<br>
selected baseband modulation mode. Here, a Quadrature<br>
Amplitude Modulation (QAM) or Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying<br>
(QPSK) modulation mode can be used. A bit group is mapped to<br>
a symbol representing a position in the amplitude-phase<br>
constellation. Then, a Space-Time Code (STC) encoder module<br>
1818 processes the symbol block. Specifically, the STC<br>
. encoder module 1818 processes the symbol according to a<br>
selected STC encoding mode and provides the same number of N<br>
outputs as the number of the multiple antennas 1610 of the<br>
base station. Each of a plurality of IFFT processing modules<br>
1820 inverse Fourier-transforms a symbol stream output from<br>
the STC encoder module 1818. Then, each of a plurality of<br>
prefix and RS insertion modules 1822 inserts a Cyclic Prefix<br>
(CP) and an RS to the inverse Fourier-transformed signal.<br>
Although RS is exemplified to be inserted after IFFT has been<br>
carried out, RS may be also inserted before IFFT. In this<br>
case, separate RS insertion module may be added before IFFT<br>
processing modules 1820. Then, each, of a plurality of<br>
digital upconversion (DUC) and digital to analog (D/A)<br>
conversion modules 1824 upconverts the processed signal from<br>
the prefix and RS insertion module 1822 to an intermediate<br>
frequency in the digital domain and then converts the<br>
upconverted signal into an analog signal. Then, analog<br>
signals created in this manner are simultaneously modulated,<br>
amplified, and transmitted through a plurality of RP modules<br>
1826 and the multiple antennas 1610.<br>
FIG. 19 is a block diagram of a receiver that can be<br>
applied to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Although the structure of the receiver of FIG. 19 will<br>
be described with reference to a terminal, it will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art that the illustrated<br>
structure can be used for both uplink and downlink<br>
transmission. When a transmission signal is received by<br>
multiple antennas 1710, each signal is demodulated and<br>
amplified through a corresponding RF module 1902. For the<br>
sake of convenience, only one of multiple reception paths is<br>
illustrated in FIG. 19. An analog to digital (A/D)<br>
conversion and digital downconversion module (DCC) 1904 then<br>
converts the analog signal into a digital signal for digital<br>
processing and donwnconverts the digital signal. The digital<br>
signal can be provided to and used in an Automatic Gain<br>
Control (AGO module 1906 in order to control amplifier gain<br>
of the RF module 1902 based on the received signal level.<br>
The digital signal is also provided to a synchronization<br>
module 1908. The synchronization module 1908 may include a<br>
coarse sync module 1910 that performs coarse synchronization,<br>
a fine sync module 1912 that performs fine synchronization,<br>
and a frequency offset Doppler/Clock estimation module that<br>
estimates a frequency offset or a Doppler effects value. A<br>
signal output from the synchronization module 1908 is<br>
provided to a frame alignment module 1914 and a frequency<br>
offset Doppler/Clock correction module 1918. A prefix<br>
removal module 1915 removes a CP from the aligned frame.<br>
Then, an FFT module 1922 Fourier-transforms the CP-removed<br>
data. Then, an RS extraction module 1930 extracts an RS<br>
signal spread in the frame and provides the RS signal to a<br>
channel estimation module 1928. Then, a channel<br>
reconstruction module 1926 reconstructs a radio channel using<br>
the channel estimation result. The channel estimation<br>
provides sufficient channel response information to enable an<br>
STC decoder 1932 to decode the symbol according to an STC<br>
encoding method used in the base station and to restore an<br>
estimation corresponding to transmission bits. The symbol<br>
obtained from the received signal and the channel estimation<br>
result of each reception path are provided to the STC decoder<br>
1932. The STC decoder 1932 then performs STC decoding on<br>
each reception path to restore the obtained symbol. The STC<br>
decoder 1932 can implement maximum likelihood decoding (MLD)<br>
for blast-based transmission. The output of the STC decoder<br>
1932 may be a Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) for each<br>
transmission bit. A symbol de-interleaver module 1934 then<br>
arranges STC-decoded symbols in the original order. Then, a<br>
de-mapping module 1936 de-maps the symbols into a bitstream<br>
and a bit de-interleaver module 1938 de-interleaves the<br>
bitstream. A rate de-matching module 1940 then processes and<br>
provides the de-interleaved bitstream to a channel decoder<br>
module 1942 to restore scrambled data and a CRC checksum.<br>
Here, the channel decoder module 1942 may use turbo decoding.<br>
A CRC module 1944 then removes the CRC checksum and checks<br>
the scrambled data according to a conventional method. A de-<br>
scrambling module 194 6 then reconstructs the CRC-checked data<br>
into original data 1948.<br>
