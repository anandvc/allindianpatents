				<td>CHARGE AIR COOLER DESIGNED FOR TIER 2 LOCOMOTIVE DIESEL ENGINE<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[1]	This patent application claims the benefit of provisional patent application 60/550,835, filed on March 5, 2004.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[2]	The present invention relates to charge air coolers of the type used in locomotive diesel engines for cooling air exiting the engine turbocharger, and more particularly to a charge air cooler having an absence of air by-pass therethrough.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[3]	Locomotive diesel engines generally utilize a combustion intake turbocharger which provides combustion charge air for the engine, and which is rotatably powered by exhaust of the engine. After being compressed in the turbocharger, the combustion charge air is hot, and is in need of cooling. This cooling is supplied by a charge air cooler (sometimes also referred to as an after cooler), located downstream of the turbocharger and upstream of the engine air box combustion chamber. An example of a prior art charge air system 10 is depicted at Figures 1 through 3, which should be referred to respecting the following description thereof.<br>
[4]	Referring firstly to Figures 1 through 2, a turbocharger 12 is interfaced with at least one prior art charge air cooler assembly 14 (two prior art charge air cooler assemblies 14', 14" being shown at Figure 1). The prior art charge air cooler assembly 14 includes a heat exchange core assembly 16 having a plurality of coolant tubes 14t arranged for a four-pass coolant path coolant tube arrangement, and having, for example, 26 to 27 coolant tubes deep, with a multiplicity of fins 14f connected in perpendicular relation thereto, wherein coolant (which may be liquid water or a liquid water and antiÂ¬freeze solution) circulates through the tubes via an external coolant system 18 and thereby extracts heat of the compressed charge air A from the turbocharger 12, whereupon cooled compressed charge air A' now passes to an engine air box combustion chamber 20.<br>
[5]	Each prior art charge air cooler assembly 14, 14' further includes a cooler plenum 22, 22' an inlet duct 24, 24' integrally connected to the cooler plenum and an outlet duct 26, 26' also integrally connected to the cooler plenum. The heat exchange core assembly 16 is slid into the cooler plenum 22, 22' through a flanged opening 22a (not visible, but clearly understood from Figure 1) and then bolted thereto at a flange 22f, 22f of the flanged opening 22a. Additionally, each inlet duct 24, 24' has a flange 24f, 24f for being sealingly connected to a flange 28f, 28f of a respective outlet port 28, 28' of the turbocharger 12; and each outlet duct 26, 26' has a flange 26f, 26f' for being sealingly connected to a respective flange 20f, (two such flanges being present, but only flange 20f is shown in Figure 2) of the engine air box combustion chamber 20.<br>
[6]	Now, referring to Figure 2, and with particularity to Figure 3, it will be seen that in order for the heat exchange core assembly 16 to be slidable into the cooler plenum 22, 22', a considerable amount of peripheral open space 32 exists between the heat exchange coolant core assembly and the cooler plenum. In operation, some air AB of the hot compressed charge air A from the turbocharger 12 by-passes the heat exchange core assembly 16 and is not cooled. As a result the cooled compressed charge air A' is actually a mixture of cooled air Ac that has passed through the heat exchange core assembly 16 and the by-pass air AB, that is A' = Ac + Ab.<br>
[7]	To the extent by-pass air Ab exists, the prior art charge air cooler 14 does not do its job of providing cooling of the hot compressed charge air exiting the turbocharger. Additionally, to the extent that the inlet<br>
and outlet ducts are integral with the cooler plenum, ease of interconnection with external components of the engine is limited.<br>
[8]	Accordingly, what is needed in the art is some configuration of a charge air cooler which eliminates by-pass air, and further which provides for easy interconnection with inlet and outlet components.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has promulgated standards which require locomotive manufacturers to comply after January 1, 2005 with "Tier 2" emissions standards. As a result, there is a need to achieve about a 50% reduction in particulate emissions along with about a 30% reduction in NOx (nitrogen oxides) emissions for locomotive two-stroke internal combustion diesel engines, dictating need for engine optimization. In accordance with the Tier 2 mandate, one aspect of the locomotive diesel engine which is subject to modification in order to comply with Tier 2 emission standards is the charge air cooler so that by-pass air is eliminated, which aspect is satisfied by the improved charge air cooler according to the present invention.<br>
[10]	The improved charge air cooler according to the present invention is designed to meet Tier 2 locomotive diesel engine standards, wherein the by-pass air is eliminated; and further, the heat exchange core is directly and readily connectable to any predetermined shape of inlet and outlet duct.<br>
[11]	The improved charge air cooler according to the present invention includes a heat exchange core assembly which is sealably attached in a selectively removable manner with any suitably shaped, and diametrically opposed, inlet and outlet ducts such that all of the hot charge air coming from the turbocharger passes entirely through the heat exchange core. In this regard, the heat exchange core assembly has a preferably four-pass coolant path coolant tube arrangement, as for example 24 to 25 coolant tubes deep, with a multiplicity of fins connected in perpendicular relation thereto, wherein<br>
a coolant (which may be liquid water or a liquid water and anti-freeze solution) circulates through the coolant tubing via an external coolant system and thereby extracts heat of the air passing therethrough.<br>
[12]	Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved charge air cooler which is designed to meet Tier 2 locomotive diesel engine standards, wherein by-pass air is eliminated; and further, the improved charge air cooler is readily connectable to any predetermined shape of inlet and outlet duct.<br>
[13]	This and additional objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become clearer from the following specification of a preferred embodiment.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
	Referring now to the drawings, Figures 4 through 9B depict an example of an improved charge air cooler 100 according to the present invention which is designed for meeting Tier 2 locomotive diesel engine standards for reduction of undesirable emissions, including NOx, without sacrificing fuel consumption. Such an optimized engine is, for example, an optimized General Motors Corporation Electromotive Division 710 locomotive diesel engine equipped with, among other optimizations, the improved charge air cooler according to the present invention which serves to lower the temperature of the hot, compressed charge air coming from the turbocharger by 15% over the prior art charge air cooler assembly discussed hereinabove with respect to Figures 1 through 3.<br>
[30]	Figure 4 depicts a schematic view of a charge air system 102 which utilizes the improved charge air cooler 100. In this regard, the improved charge air cooler 100 is configured so that an improved heat exchange core 104 thereof is directly sealed with any suitably shaped inlet and outlet ducts 106,108, and is, elsewhere, provided with cover panels 110 which thereby collectively necessitate that all of the hot charge air AA coming from the turbocharger 12 pass entirely through the heat exchange core assembly so as to provide cooled charge air AA' to the engine air box combustion chamber 20.<br>
[31]	More particularly, the improved heat exchange core 104 of the improved charge air cooler 100 includes a plurality of coolant tubes 104t, preferably of copper, which are in intimate contact with a multiplicity of perpendicularly oriented cooling fins 104f, also preferably of copper. In this regard, it is preferred for the coolant tubes 104t to be arranged 24 to 25 coolant tubes deep in a four-pass coolant path arrangement of the coolant tubes, as shown at Figure 6B.<br>
[32]	A first tube sheet 115a is connected to the coolant tubes 104t adjacent a first end coolant fin 104f', and a second tube sheet 115b is connected to the coolant tubes adjacent an opposite second end coolant fin 14f". The cover panels 110 include a first manifold 110M1 which is connected to the first tube sheet 115a by fasteners 125 and has a single baffle 110a, a second manifold 110M2 which is connected to the second tube sheet<br>
115b by fasteners 125 and has a pair of baffles 110b, a coolant inlet 1101 and a coolant outlet 1100. In this regard, the coolant circulates along arrows W in a counterflow, four-pass coolant path (as shown at Figure 6B), and is<br>
interconnected with an external coolant system 18 (as for example shown at Figure 4). The cover panels 110 further include a first side cover 110S1 and a second side cover 110S2, both being connected to the first and second tube sheets by fasteners. The peripheries of the first and second side cover 110S1, 110S2 and the first and second tube sheets 115a, 115b provide a pair of generally identical, diametrically disposed mounting frames 112 having threaded fastener attachment holes 118 which are utilized to connect the inlet and outlet ducts thereto.<br>
[33]	Operatively, coolant (which may be liquid water or a liquid water and anti-freeze solution) circulates through the coolant tubes 104t via the external coolant system 18 and thereby extracts, in cooperation with the fins 104f, heat of the compressed charge air AA coming from the turbocharger 12, whereupon the cooled compressed charge air AA' now passes to an engine air box combustion chamber 20.<br>
[34]	The improved heat exchange core 104 is preferably optimized to increase tube rows by thirty-three percent over the heat exchange core assembly of the prior art charge air cooler assembly discussed hereinabove with respect to Figures 1 through 3, resulting in an increased thermal effectiveness of five percent for the improved charge air cooler over the prior art charge air cooler assembly 14. Now, when this is added to an increase in thermal effectiveness of ten percent of the improved charge air cooler 100 over the prior art charge air cooler assembly 14, due to elimination of by-pass air in the improved charge air cooler 100, a total increase in thermal efficiency of fifteen percent, as mentioned hereinabove, is realized by the present invention over the prior art.<br>
[35]	The improved charge air cooler 100 has a preferably symmetrical six-sided box shape. In this regard, the improved heat exchange core 104 is also preferably box-shaped, having the aforementioned mounting frames 112 at diametrically opposed sides thereof for mounting thereto the inlet and outlet ducts, respectively, via the attachment holes 118, wherein a plurality of holes of mounting flanges 106f, 108f of each of the inlet and outlet<br>
ducts 106,108, respectively, receive threaded fasteners 116 therethrough (see by way of example Figure 7B) which then threadably engage the attachment holes 118 so as to sealingly connect each mounting frame 112 to a respective one of the inlet and outlet ducts.<br>
[36]	When all sides of the improved heat exchange core 104 are covered by either a duct 106, 108 or a cover panel 110, the collective result is a sealed plenum 122 surrounding the improved heat exchange core 104 such that all the air flowing thereinto from the inlet duct must entirely flow out through the outlet duct, passing entirely through the improved heat exchange core, without any air by-passing the improved heat exchange core. The inlet duct 106 directs hot, compressed charge air from the turbocharger discharge to the improved charged air cooler 100, wherein one end of the inlet duct has a suitably configured turbocharger connection flange 106f for being sealingly connected to an outlet port of the turbocharger. The outlet duct 108 directs cooled, compressed charge air from the improved charge air cooler 100 to the engine air box combustion chamber 20, wherein one end of the outlet duct has a suitably configured chamber connection flange 108f for being sealingly connected to a port of the engine air box combustion chamber.<br>
[37]	Since the shape of the improved charge air cooler 100 is symmetrical, the inlet and outlet ducts 106, 108 may be connected to the improved charge air cooler at selected opposing sides thereof. In this regard, the improved charge air cooler 100 may be connected in any direction to the turbocharger 12 and the engine air box combustion chamber 20, via any suitable ducting 106, 108, without altering its heat exchange characteristics. Therefore, the air direction across the improved heat exchange core 104 can be one way, or the opposite way, as desired for a particular installation, wherein the coolant flows in a perpendicular plane with respect to either direction of air flow.<br>
[38]	The inlet and outlet ducts 106, 108 have been designed to improve air flow distribution to and from the improved charge air cooler 100, and thereby assist in the charge air cooling efficiency thereof. The inlet and outlet ducts 106, 108 also serve to support the charge air cooler 100; accordingly, the inlet and outlet ducts are configured and enhanced to withstand vibrations and shock which can cause fatigue structural failure of previous designs of the prior art charge air cooler assembly as recounted above with respect to Figures 1 through 3. Additionally, the improved charge air cooler 100 and the inlet and outlet ducts 106,108 have been configured to provide ease of installation to the locomotive diesel engine, and to withstand misalignment during the installation process.<br>
	In that it is preferred for the turbocharger 12 to have two outlet ports, it is therefore preferred to provide two improved charge air coolers 100, a first improved charge air cooler 100' as shown at Figures 7A and 7B which interfaces with a first outlet port 28 of the turbocharger 12 (see Figure 1), and a second improved charge air cooler 100" as depicted at Figures 8A and 8B which interfaces with a second outlet port 28' of the turbocharger (see Figure 1). It will be seen that the first improved charge air cooler 100' has associated therewith a first inlet duct 106' and a first outlet duct 108'. Additionally, it will be noted that the second improved charge air cooler 100" has associated therewith a second inlet duct 106" and a second outlet duct 108".<br>
[40]	Referring now to Figures 9A and 9B, a typical installation example of the first improved charge air cooler 100' (and its associated first inlet and outlet ducts 106', 108') and the second improved charge air cooler 100" (and its associated inlet and outlet ducts 106", 108") are shown with respect to a turbocharger 12 and engine air box combustion chamber 20 of a locomotive diesel engine 130, such as, for example, an optimized General Motors Corporation Electromotive Division Model 710 diesel engine.<br>
[41]	Referring now to Figure 10, a pair of plots of thermal effectiveness versus mass flow, wherein plot 124 is for the improved charge air cooler 100 according to the present invention, and plot 126 is for the prior art charge air cooler assembly discussed hereinabove with respect to Figures 1 through 3. It will be seen that the improved charge air cooler 100 is improved by at least ten percent over the prior art charge air cooler assembly.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
