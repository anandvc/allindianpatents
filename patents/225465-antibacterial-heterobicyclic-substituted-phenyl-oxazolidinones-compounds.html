FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of phenyl oxazolidinone<br>
compounds having antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-<br>
negative bacteria, pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds,<br>
and methods of treating bacterial infections with the compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Oxazolidinones have been identified, within the last twenty years, as a<br>
new class of antibacterials which are active against numerous multidrug-<br>
resistant gram positive organisms. Particularly problematic pathogens include<br>
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), glycopeptide-<br>
intermediate resistant Staphylococcus aureus (GISA), vancomycin-resistant<br>
enterocci (VRE) and penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant Streptococcus<br>
pneumoniae. As a class, oxazolidinones exhibit a unique mechanism of<br>
action. Studies have shown that these compounds selectively bind to the 50S<br>
ribosomal subunit and inhibit bacterial translation at the initiation phase of<br>
protein synthesis. Exemplary members of oxazolidinones are linezolid (see<br>
WO 95/07271) and eperezolid.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,792,765 to Riedi et al. discloses a series of substituted<br>
oxazolidinones (cyanoguanidine, cyanoamidines, and amidines) useful as<br>
antibacterial medicaments.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 5,910,504 to Hutchinson discloses a series of hetero-<br>
aromatic ring substituted phenyl oxazolidinones, including indolyl substituted<br>
compounds useful as antibacterial agents.<br>
WO 98/54161 (Hester et al.) discloses amides, thioarnides, ureas, and<br>
thioureas which are antibacterial agents.<br>
WO 95/07271 (Barbachyn et al.) discloses oxazine and thiazine<br>
oxazolidinone derivatives such as linezolid and its analogs which are useful<br>
antimicrobial agents, effective against a number of human and veterinary<br>
pathogens, including gram-positive aerobic bacteria such as multiple-resistant<br>
staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci as well as anaerobic organisms<br>
such as Bacteroides spp. and Clostridia spp. species, and acid-fast organisms<br>
such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium and<br>
Mycobacterium spp.<br>
WO 93/09103 (Barbachyn et al.) discloses substituted aryl- and<br>
heteroarylphenyloxazolidinones which are useful as antibacterial agents.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Relative to the above description of the phenyl oxazolidinone<br>
compounds of the present invention, the following definitions apply.<br>
Unless specified otherwise, the terms "alkyl", "alkenyl", and "alkynyl"<br>
may be straight or branched groups with 1-8 carbon atoms.<br>
"Acyl" means an organic radical having the designated number of<br>
carbon atoms, derived from an organic acid by the removal of a hydroxyl<br>
group having the formula RCO, as in the case of acetyl where R is CH3.<br>
"Aryl" is an unsubstituted carbocyclic aromatic group including, but not<br>
limited to, phenyl, 1- or 2-naphthyl and the like. "Heteroaryl" refers to a cyclic<br>
aromatic radical having from five to ten atoms in the ring; where one to three<br>
ring atoms are independent heteroatoms such as S, O, and N, and the<br>
remaining ring atoms are carbon, for example, a pyridinyl, pyrazinyl,<br>
pyrimidinyl, pyrroyl, pyrazolyl, imidazolyl, thiazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl,<br>
thiadiazolyl, oxadiazolyt, thienyl, furanyl, quinolinyl, or isoquinolinyl, radical<br>
and the like.<br>
"Substituted aryl" or "substituted heteroaryl" refers to an aryl or<br>
heteroaryl substituted by independent replacement of 1-3 of the hydrogen<br>
atoms thereon with halogen, OH, CN, mercapto, nitro, C1-8-alkyl, halo-C-1-8-<br>
alkyl, C-1-8-alkoxy, thio-C1-8-alkyl, amino, C1-8-alkyl-amine, di(C1-C8-alkyl-<br>
)amino, formyl, carboxy, alkoxycarbonyl, C1-8-alkyl-CO-O-, C1-8-alkyl-CO-NH-,<br>
or carboxamide. Further, substituted-heteroaryl may be substituted with a<br>
mono-oxo to give, for example, a 4-oxo-1-H-quinoline. Substituted-heteroaryl<br>
may also be substituted with a substituted-aryl or a second substituted-<br>
heteroaryl to give, for example, a 4-phenyi-imidazol-1-yl or a 3-pyridinyl-<br>
imidazol-1-yl, and the like.<br>
The term "halo" or "halogen" means fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo.<br>
(mono-, di-, tri-, and per-) halo-alkyl is an alkyl radical substituted by<br>
independent replacement of the hydrogen atoms thereon with halogen. P<br>
denotes phosphorus.<br>
The compounds of the instant invention are asymmetric in the<br>
oxazolidinone ring at the 5- position and thus exist as optical antipodes. As<br>
such, ail possible optical antipodes, enantiomers or diastereomers resulting<br>
from additional asymmetric centers that may exist in optical antipodes,<br>
racemates and racemic mixtures thereof are also part of this invention. The<br>
antipodes can be separated by methods known to those skilled in the art such<br>
as, for example, fractional recrystallization of diastereomeric salts of<br>
enantiomerically pure acids. Alternatively, the antipodes can be separated by<br>
chromatography on a Pirkle column.<br>
The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" denotes salts of the<br>
free base which possess the desired pharmacological activity of the free base<br>
and which are neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable. These salts may<br>
be derived from inorganic or organic acids. Examples of inorganic acids are<br>
hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, or phosphoric<br>
acid. Examples of organic acids are acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid,<br>
lactic acid, pyruvic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, maleic acid,<br>
fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, rnandelic<br>
acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid,<br>
methyi sulfonic acid, saiicyclic acid and the like. Suitable salts are<br>
furthermore those of inorganic or organic bases, such as KOH, NaOH,<br>
Ca(OH)2, AI(OH)3, piperidine, morpholine, ethylamine, triethylamine and the<br>
like.<br>
Also included within the scope of the invention are the hydrated forms<br>
of the compounds which contain various amounts of water, for instance, the<br>
hydrate, hemihydrate and sesquihydrate forms.<br>
The term "subject" includes, without limitation, any animal or artificially<br>
modified animal. In the preferred embodiment, the subject is a human.<br>
The term "drug-resistant" or "drug-resistance" refers to the<br>
characteristics of a microbe to survive in presence of a currently available<br>
antimicrobial agent at its routine, effective concentration.<br>
The compounds of the present invention possess antibacterial activity<br>
against Gram-positive and certain Gram-negative bacteria. They are useful<br>
as antibacterial agents for the treatment of bacterial infections in humans and<br>
animals. Particularly, these compounds have antimicrobial activity against S.<br>
aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, E. faecium, Moraxelia<br>
catarrhalis, and H. influenzae. More particularly, these compounds are useful<br>
against resistant bacteria such as MRSA and GISA, and have a low<br>
susceptibility to acquired resistance mechanisms. Compounds of Formula I<br>
which are most preferred for such purposes are those in which R is any of the<br>
following:<br>
In addition Compounds of Formula I which are most preferred for such<br>
purposes are those in which Y is any of the following:<br>
Particular examples of the present invention include the following<br>
compounds:<br>
N-[[(5S)-3-[4-(1,3-Dihydro-2H-isoindol-2-yl)-3-fluorophenyl]-2-oxo-5-<br>
oxazolidinyl]methyl]acetamide;<br>
N-[[(5S)-3-[4-(1,3-Dihydro-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyridin-2-yl)-3-<br>
fluorophenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]acetamide;<br>
N-[[(5S)-3-[3-Fluoro-4-(5-oxido-2H-pyrrolo[3,4-clpyridin-2-yl)phenyl]-2-<br>
oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]acetamide;<br>
N-[[(5S)-3-[4-(5,7-dihydro-6H-pyrrolo[3.4-b]pyridin-6-yl)-3-fluorophenyl]-<br>
2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]acetamide;<br>
N-[(5S)-3-[4-(1,3-dihydro-1-oxo-2H-isoindol-2-yl)-3-fluorophenyl]-2-<br>
oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]acetamide; and<br>
(5R)-3-[4-(5,7-Dihydro-6H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyridin-6-yl)-3-fluorophenyl]-<br>
5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-oxazolidinone.<br>
The compounds of Formula I that are the subject of this invention may be<br>
prepared from readily available starting materials such as isoindole (Gawley<br>
et al., J. Org. Chem., 1988, 53:5381), 6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyridine<br>
and 6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyridine (US Pat. No. 5,371,090 to Petersen<br>
et al.) in accordance with synthetic methods well known in the art.<br>
Representative proceduresare outlined in Scheme I-V:<br>
In accordance with Scheme I, bicyclic heterocycles of general formula IV are<br>
treated with a substituted nitrobenzene derivative (L is an appropriate leaving<br>
group such as a halogen of trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy) in a suitable base<br>
and solvent, such as diisopropylamine and ethyl acetate, to give the<br>
substituted nitrophenyl compound V.<br>
The nitrobenzene derivative V is then reduced to the aniline by an<br>
appropriate reaction, for instance by treatment with SnCl2 or by catalytic<br>
hydrogenation in the presence of a suitable catalyst, such as palladium on<br>
carbon. The aniline is then treated with benzyl or methyl chloroformate and<br>
sodium bicarbonate to form the corresponding benzyl or methyl carbamate<br>
derivative VI.<br>
The Cbz aniline VI is then deprotonated with a lithium base such as n-<br>
butyllithium and reacted with (R)- glycidyl butyrate to afford the oxazolidinone<br>
VII. The hydroxymethyl group can then be converted to an amide as shown in<br>
Scheme I by preparation of the mesylate, conversion to azide VIII, and<br>
reduction to amine IX by an appropriate procedure such as hydrogenation.<br>
Alternatively displacement of a mesylate (Scheme II) or appropiate leaving<br>
group such as tosylate or chlorine with potassium phthalimide and removal of<br>
the phthaloyl protecting group by hydrazinolysis would provide amine IX. The<br>
amine IX can be converted to amide X by an acylation reaction using<br>
techniques known in the art, such as treatment with acetic anhydride in the<br>
presence of a base such as pyridine. Alternatively, amine IX can be<br>
converted to a carbamate XI by treatment with methylchloroformate and<br>
pyridine, or reacted with a sulfonyl chloride in an inert solvent in the presence<br>
of an organic base like pyridine to form a sulfonamide XII<br>
For the formation of oxazolidione in which R = O-Heteroaryl (XIII), the<br>
oxazolidinone carbinol VII can be converted to the corresponding mesylate or<br>
other appropriate leaving group and reacted with HO-Het (a suitible hydroxyl<br>
containing heterocycle), either in the presence of base or with HO-Het as a<br>
preformed alkoxide, in an appropriate solvent, for example DMF or acetonitrile<br>
(Scheme III). Alternatively, Mitsunobu conditions can be used to couple VII<br>
with HO-Heterocycle by treating with triphenylphosphine and diisopropyl<br>
azodicarboxylate (DIAD) in an appropriate solvent, such as THF, at a suitable<br>
temperature, preferably room temperature. Reaction conditions and leading<br>
references can be found in Gravestock et at, WO99/64416.<br>
Furthermore, by treating VII with a suitable, non-nucleophilic base, for<br>
example NaH, the displacement of a leaving group (LG), such as chlorine or<br>
bromine, can be effected from an appropriately reactive aza-heterocycle (LG-<br>
Het)(Scheme III).<br>
Compounds of structure XIV can be prepared as shown in Scheme IV.<br>
Amine IX can be converted to various functionalized amidines by reaction with<br>
activated imines, where Q is a leaving group such as methylthio or methoxy,<br>
in a suitable solvent, for example toluene or methanol, with or without a<br>
catalyst (such AgNO3) present at a temperature range of 0-110ºC.<br>
In accordance with Scheme V pyrrolidinone XV (prepared as in WO96/13502)<br>
is first reacted with methoxy-bis(dimethylamine) or other activated<br>
dimethylformamide reagent and, second, heated in a suitable solvent (for<br>
example DMF and benzene) with either substituted amidines, to form<br>
pyrrolopyrimidines oxazolidinones such as XVI, or substituted hydrazines, to<br>
form pyrrolopyrazole oxazolidinones such as XVII. Formation of the<br>
enamine, alkoxymethylene or alkoxycarbonyl derivatives of pyrrolidinone XV,<br>
according to Brighty et al in US 5037834A, would also allow access to these<br>
systems.<br>
Scheme VI<br>
As shown in Scheme VI compounds with the structure XIX can be<br>
achieved by oxidation of the various compounds, XVIII, using an appropriate<br>
oxidant (for example manganese dioxide, peroxyacetic acid, DDQ or air) in a<br>
suitable solvent such as methylene chloride.<br>
Oxo-derivatives of structure XXII in Scheme VII, (X = O, Y = H2 or X =<br>
H2, Y = O) can be constructed by reacting 1,2-aryl dicarboxaldehydes (where<br>
XXI, U = H) with aniline XX (prepared as in WO96/23788) in the presence of<br>
acids, such as acetic acid, in a suitable solvent such as methylene chloride.<br>
The di-oxo-derivatives ( structure XXII where X = Y = O) are prepared from<br>
the reaction of aniline XX with selected 1,2-aryl dicarbonyl reagents with a<br>
suitable leaving group (XXI where U = CI, Br, etc).<br>

the test method from the National Committee for Laboratory Standards<br>
(NCCLS). This method is described in the NCCLS Document M7-A4, Vol.17,<br>
N0.2, "Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test for Bacteria that<br>
Grow Aerobically-Fourth Edition", which is incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
In this method twofold serial dilutions of drug in cation adjusted<br>
Mueller-Hinton broth are added to wells in microdilution trays. The test<br>
organisms are prepared by adjusting the turbidity of actively growing broth<br>
cultures so that the final concentration of test organism after it is added to the<br>
wells is approximately 5x104 CFU/well.<br>
Following inoculation of the microdilution trays, the trays are incubated<br>
at 35ºC for 16-20 hours and then read. The MIC is the lowest concentration of<br>
test compound that completely inhibits growth of the test organism. The<br>
amount of growth in the wells containing the test compound is compared with<br>
the amount of growth in the growth-control wells (no test compound) used in<br>
each tray. As set forth in Table 1, some compounds of the present invention<br>
were tested against a variety of pathogenic bacteria resulting in a range of<br>
activities, from 1 to &gt;128 µg/mL depending on the organism tested. S. aureus<br>
OC2878 is a MRSA and E. faecium OC3312 is a vancomycin resistant<br>
enterococcus.<br>
This invention further provides a method of treating bacterial infections,<br>
or enhancing or potentiating the activity of other antibacterial agents, in a<br>
subject having conditions caused by or contributed to by bacterial infection,<br>
which comprises administering to the animals a compound of the invention<br>
alone or in admixture with another antibacterial agent in the form of a<br>
medicament according to the invention. The terms of "treating" and<br>
"treatment" include administering, either simultaneously, separately or<br>
sequentially, a pharmaceutically effective amount of a composition containing<br>
one or more of the compounds disclosed herein to a subject that desires<br>
inhibition of bacterial growth. The pharmaceutically effective amount of the<br>
compound used to practice the present invention for treatment varies<br>
depending on the manner of administration, the age, weight, and general<br>
health of the subject treated, and ultimately will be decided by physicians or<br>
veterinarians.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be administered to a<br>
subject such as a human by any route appropriate to the condition to be<br>
treated, suitable routes including oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal<br>
and sublingual), vaginal and parenteral (including subcutaneous,<br>
intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural). The<br>
preferred route may vary with, for example, the condition of the recipient as<br>
well as the ease of preparation and administration.<br>
When the compounds are employed for the above utility, they may be<br>
combined with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, e.g.,<br>
solvents, diluents, and the like, and may be administered orally in such forms<br>
as tablets, capsules, dispersible powders, granules, or suspensions<br>
containing for example, from about 0.5% to 5% of suspending agent, syrups<br>
containing, for example, from about 10% to 50% of sugar, and elixirs<br>
containing, for example, from about 20% to 50% ethanol, and the like, or<br>
parenterally in the form of sterile injectable solutions or suspensions<br>
containing from about 0.5% to 5% suspending agent in an isotonic medium.<br>
These pharmaceutical preparations may contain, for example, from about<br>
0.5% up to about 90% of the active ingredient in combination with the carrier,<br>
more usually between 5% and 60% by weight.<br>
Compositions for topical application may take the form of liquids,<br>
creams or gels, containing a therapeutically effective concentration of a<br>
compound of the invention admixed with a dermatologically acceptable<br>
carrier.<br>
In preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual<br>
pharmaceutical media may be employed. Solid carriers include starch,<br>
lactose, dicalcium phosphate, microcrystalline cellulose, sucrose and kaolin,<br>
while liquid carriers include sterile water, polyethylene glycols, non-ionic<br>
surfactants and edible oils such as corn, peanut and sesame oils, as are<br>
appropriate to the nature of the active ingredient and the particular form of<br>
administration desired. Adjuvants customarily employed in the preparation of<br>
pharmaceutical compositions may be advantageously included, such as<br>
flavoring agents, coloring agents, preserving agents, and antioxidants, for<br>
example, vitamin E, ascorbic acid, BHT and BHA.<br>
The preferred pharmaceutical compositions from the standpoint of<br>
ease of preparation and administration are solid compositions, particularly<br>
tablets and hard-filled or liquid-filled capsules. Oral administration of the<br>
compounds is preferred. These active compounds may also be administered<br>
parenterally or intraperitoneally. Solutions or suspensions of these active<br>
compounds as a free base or pharmacological acceptable salt can be<br>
prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxypropyl-<br>
cellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene<br>
glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and<br>
use, these preparations may contain a preservative to prevent the growth of<br>
microorganisms.<br>
The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile<br>
aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous<br>
preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form<br>
must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It<br>
must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be<br>
preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as<br>
bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium<br>
containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol<br>
and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.<br>
The effective dosage of active ingredient employed may vary<br>
depending on the particular compound employed, the mode of administration<br>
and the severity of the condition being treated. However, in general,<br>
satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds of the invention are<br>
administered at a daily dosage of from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 400 mg/kg of<br>
animal body weight, preferably given in divided doses two to four times a day,<br>
or in sustained release form. For most large mammals the total daily dosage<br>
is from about 0.07 g to 7.0 g, preferably from about 100 mg to 1000 mg.<br>
Dosage forms suitable for internal use comprise from about 100 mg to 500 mg<br>
of the active compound in intimate admixture with a solid or liquid<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. This dosage regimen may be adjusted<br>
to provide the optimal therapeutic response. For example, several divided<br>
doses may be administered daily or the dose may be proportionally reduced<br>
as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation.<br>
The production of the above-mentioned pharmaceutical compositions<br>
and medicaments is carried out by any method known in the art, for example,<br>
by mixing the active ingredients(s) with the diluent(s) to form a pharmaceutical<br>
composition (e.g. a granulate) and then forming the composition into the<br>
medicament (e.g. tablets).<br><br>
The following examples describe in detail the chemical synthesis of<br>
representative compounds of the present invention. The procedures are<br>
illustrations, and the invention should not be construed as being limited by<br>
chemical reactions and conditions they express. No attempt has been made<br>
to optimize the yields obtained in these reactions, and it would be obvious to<br>
one skilled in the art that variations in reaction times, temperatures, solvents,<br>
and/or reagents could increase the yields.<br><br>
Isoindoline was synthesized employing the method of R. E. Gawley, S. R.<br>
Chemburkar, A. L. Smith, T. V. Anklekar J. Org. Chem. 1988, 53, 5381.<br><br>
To 3,4-difluoronitrobenzene (3.02 mL, 27.3 mmols) in ethyl acetate at rt was<br>
added diisopropylethylamine (5.03 mL, 28.9 mmols) and then isoindoline<br>
(3.50 g, 29.4 mmols) and stirred overnight. A yellow precipitate (ppt) formed<br>
and was collected on a filter, washed with water and ether and dried in a<br>
vacuum oven (30°C) to provide the product as a bright yellow solid (6.69 g,<br>
95% yield). Mp = 200-202°C. MS (M + 1) = 327 m/z.<br>
To the above nitro compound (2.62 g, 10.2 mmols) in ethanol (100 mL) was<br>
added SnCI2 (9.84 g, 50.9mmols) and was refluxed for 16hrs. After cooling to<br>
rt the reaction mixture was added to 10% aq. NaOH (300 mL) and extracted<br>
with CH2CI2 (6x50 mL). The combined organic washings were washed with<br>
brine (100 mL), dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated to give 2.63 g of an olive<br>
green solid (aniline), which was used without further purification. To this<br>
aniline in acetone (150 mL) and water (20 mL) was added NaHCO3 (1.84 g,<br>
21.9 mmols) and then benzylchloroformate (1.68 mL, 11.8 mmols). After<br>
stirring overnight the mixture was poured into ice water (100 mL) and the<br>
resulting tan precipitate was collected on a filter, washed with water and dried<br>
in a vacuum to give the Cbz aniline as a tan solid (3.50 g, 95% yield). Mp =<br>
146-148°C. MS (M + 1) = 363 m/z.<br>
Step 3:<br>
To the above Cbz aniline (0.74 g, 2.04 mmols) in THF (10 mL) at -78ºC was<br>
added n-BuLi (2.5 M, 0.82 mL, 2.05 mmols) dropwise. After stirring for 40<br>
min, (R)-glycidyl butyrate (0.31 mL, 2.10 mmols) in THF (0.5 mL) was added<br>
dropwise and the resulting mixture was allowed to warm to RT overnight. A<br>
white precipitate had formed and was collected on a filter and washed with<br>
water and ether. Chromatography on silica gel with 25% ethyl acetate/hexane<br>
as eluent provided the product as a white solid (0.58 g, 87% yield). MS (M +<br>

5.31 mmols) and, after 10 min, methanesulfonyl chloride (0.2:8 mL, 3.62<br>
mmols). After allowing the reaction mixture to warm to RT over an hour<br>
starting material was still present so cooling and addition of tniethyl amine<br>
(0.37 mL, 2.65 mmols) and methanesulfonyl chloride (0.14 mL, 1.81 mmols)<br>
was repeated. The mixture was poured into water (50 mL) and extracted with<br>
CH2CI2 (6 X 20 mL), washed with brine (4 x 10mL), dried over Na2SO4,<br>
concentrated to afford the crude product as a brown oil (0.95 g). MS (M + 1)<br>

cooling to rt water was added and the mixture extracted with ethyl acetate<br>
(6X25 mL), washed with brine (4x10 mL), dried over Na2SO4, concentrated to<br>
give 0.48 g of a tan solid. MS (M + 1) = 354 m/z.<br>

The azide from Example 3 in ethyl acetate (25 mL) was placed in a Paar flask<br>
and nitrogen bubbled through for 15 min whereupon 10% Pd/C (0.15 g, 0.14<br>
mmol) was added. The mixture was pressurized with 50 psi of H2 (g) and<br>
shaken for 16 hrs whereupon an additional amount of 10% Pd/C (0.15 g, 1.4<br>
mmols) was added and the mixture shaken for an additional 6 hrs (at this<br>
point MS (M + 1) = 328 mlz). After placing the mixture under nitrogen,<br>
pyridine (0.22 mL, 2.72 mmol) and then Ac2O (0.51 mL, 5.30 mmol) were<br>
added and the mixture strred for 2 hrs. The mixture was filtered through<br>
celite, washing with ethyl acetate (100 mL), concentrated, and<br>
chromatographed on silica (gradient elution 1%-5% MeOH/CH2Cl2) and then<br>
triturated with ethyl acetate (3X3 mL) to give 0.19 g of a white solid<br>

methanol (600 mL) was added ammonium formate (59.0 g, 907 mmol).<br>
Nitrogen was bubbled through the reaction for approximately 30 minutes<br>
whereupon 10% Pd/C (2.20 g, 21 mmols) was added. After stirring overnight<br>
at rt under an atmosphere of nitrogen the reaction mixture was filtered through<br>
a pad of Celite, washing thoroughly with methanol (400 mL), and<br>
concentrated to a volume of ca. 200 mL. Water (300 mL) was added and the<br>
mixture extracted with ethyl acetate (5X200 mL). The combined organic<br>

was added followed by the dropwise addition of benzylchloroformate (34.2<br>
mL, 228 mmols). The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room<br>
temperature and stirred overnight whereupon a ppt formed. The reaction was<br>
poured into ice water (2 L) and the resulting precipitate was collected by<br>
o<br>
filtration. The solid was washed with water and dried in a vacuum oven (50 C)<br>
to afford the Cbz derivative (73.0 g, 97% yield) as a salmon colored powder.<br>

was cooled to -78ºC under a nitrogen atmosphere. To this mixture was<br>
added n-BuLi (2.5 M, 45.8 mL, 114.5 mmols) dropwise via syringe over fifteen<br>
minutes. The reaction was warmed to room temperature and allowed to stir<br>
for 45 minutes before again being cooled to -78ºC. At this point (R)-glycidyl<br>
butyrate (17.2 mL, 117 mmols) was added and the reaction mixture allowed to<br>
warm to rt overnight during which time a precipitate formed. The ppt was<br>
collected, washed with several portions of ether (5X100 mL) and dried in a<br>
vacuum oven (50ºC) to afford 40.6 g of the ether solvate of the lithium<br>
alkoxide as a tan fluffy powder. This material was then washed with several<br>
portions of water (4X200 mL) and dried in a vacuum oven (50ºC) to afford the<br>
oxazolidinone alcohol (34.1 g, 92% yield) as a tan granular solid. Mp = 208-<br>

reaction mixture was filtered through a pad of Celite, washing thoroughly with<br>
methanol and then copious amounts of 50% MeOH/CH2CI2 (ca. 2 L). The<br>
filtrate was evaporated to afford the crude acetamide in DMF. The mixture<br>
was slowly added to water (2 L) and the ppt collected on a filter, washed with<br>
water (5X400 mL) and dried in a vac oven (50ºC) to provide the acetamide as<br>
an analytically pure white solid (14.2 g, 63% yield). The combined filtrates<br>
