				<td>Field- of the Invention The present invention relates to novel small molecule antagonists of calcitonin gene-related peptide receptors ("CGRP-receptor"), pharmaceutical compositions comprising them, methods for identifying them, methods of treatment using them and their use in therapy for treatment of neurogenic vasodilation, neurogenic inflammation, migraine, cluster headache and other headaches, thermal injury, circulatory shock, flushing associated with menopause, airway inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other conditions the treatment of which can be effected by the antagonism of CGRP-receptors.<br>
Background of the Invention Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a naturally occurring 37-amino-acid peptide first identified in 1982 (Amara, S. G. et al, Science 1982,298, 240-244). Two forms of the peptide are expressed (αCGRP and ßCGRP) which differ by one and three amino acids in rats and humans, respectively. The peptide is widely distributed in both the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS), principally localized in sensory afferent and central neurons, and displays a number of biological effects, including vasodilation.<br>
When released from the cell, CGRP binds to specific cell surface G protein-coupled receptors and exerts its biological action predominantly by activation of intracellular adenylate cyclase (Poyner, D. R. et al, Br J Pharmacol 1992,105,441-7; Van Valen, F. et al, NeurosciLett 1990,119,195-8.). Two classes of CGRP receptors, CGRP1 and CGRP2, have been proposed based on the antagonist properties of the peptide fragment CGRP(8-37) and the ability of linear analogues of CGRP to activate CGRP2 receptors (Juaneda, C. et al. TiPS 2000, 21,432-438). However, there is lack of molecular evidence for the CGRP2 receptor (Brain, S. D. et al, TiPS 2002, 23, 51-53). The CGRP1 receptor has three components: (i) a 7 transmembrane calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR); (ii) the single transmembrane receptor activity modifying protein type one (RAMP1); and (iii) the intracellular receptor component protein (RCP) (Evans B. N. et al., J Biol Chem. 2000, 275,31438-43).<br><br><br>
RAMP1 is required for transport of CRLR to the plasma membrane and for ligand binding to the CGRP-receptor (McLatchie, L. M. et al, Nature 1998,393, 333-339). RCP is required for signal transduction (Evans B. N. et al., JBiol Chem. 2000, 275, 31438-43). There are known species-specific differences in binding of small molecule antagonists to the CGRP-receptor with typically greater affinity seen for antagonism of the human receptor than for other species (Brain, S. D. et al, TiPS 2002, 23, 51-53). The amino acid sequence of RAMP1 determines the species selectivity, in particular, the amino acid residue Trp74 is responsible for the phenotype of the human receptor (Mallee et al. J Biol Chem 2002,277,14294-8).<br>
Inhibitors at the receptor level to CGRP are postulated to be useful in pathophysiologic conditions where excessive CGRP receptor activation has occurred. Some of these include neurogenic vasodilation, neurogenic inflammation, migraine, cluster headache and other headaches, thermal injury, circulatory shock, menopausal flushing, and asthma. CGRP receptor activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of migraine headache (Edvinsson L. CNS Drugs 2001;15(10):745-53; Williamson, D. J. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2001,53,167-178.; Grant, A. D. Brit. J. Pharmacol. 2002,135, 356-362.). Serum levels of CGRP are elevated during migraine (Goadsby PJ, et al. Ann Neural 1990;28:183-7) and treatment with anti-migraine drugs returns CGRP levels to normal coincident with alleviation of headache (Gallai V. et al. Cephalalgia 1995;15: 384-90). Migraineurs exhibit elevated basal CGRP levels compared to controls (Ashina M, et al., Pain. 2000;86(1-2): 133-8.2000). Intravenous CGRP infusion produces lasting headache in migraineurs (Lassen LH, et al. Cephalalgia. 2002 Feb;22(l):54-61). Preclinical studies in dog and rat report that systemic CGRP blockade with the peptide antagonist CGRP(8-37) does not alter resting systemic hemodynamics nor regional blood flow (Shen, Y-T. et al, J Pharmacol Exp Ther 2001, 298, 551-8). Thus, CGRP-receptor antagonists may present a novel treatment for migraine that avoids the cardiovascular liabilities of active vasoconstriction associated with non-selective 5-HT1B/iD agonists, 'triptans' (e.g., sumatriptan).<br>
There are various in vivo migraine models known in the literature (see De Vries, P. et al, Eur J Phannacol 1999, 375, 61-74). Some electrically stimulate the trigeminal ganglion and measure dilation of the intracranial vessels which they<br><br>
innervate (e.g., Williamson et al. Cephalalgia 1997 17:518-24). Since facial arteries are also innervated by the trigeminal nerve, other models study changes in facial blood flow induced by electrical trigeminal activation (e.g., Escott et al. Brain Res 1995 669:93). Alternatively, other peripheral nerves (e.g., saphenous) and vascular beds (e.g., abdominal blood flow) are also studied (e.g., Escott et al. BrJPhannacol 1993 110,772-6;). All models have been shown to be blocked by pretreatment with the peptide antagonist CGPR(8-37) a peptide fragment that is absent the 1st seven residues, or by a small molecule CGRP-receptor antagonist. In some instances, exogenous CGRP has been used as a stimulus. However, these models are all invasive terminal procedures, and none have shown the clinically important abortive effect of reversing an established increase in artery dilation or increased blood flow using post-treatment of a CGRP-receptor antagonist. Williamson et al. Cephalalgia 1997 17:518-24, and Williamson etal. Cephalalgia. 1997 17:525-31: us&amp;d inter alia i.v. CGRP as a stimulus to increase intracranial dural artery diameter in sodium pentobarb anesthetized rats employing a terminal 'intravital' procedure that involved drilling to thin the skull and the creation of a closed cranial window to visualize dural arteries. The effect was blocked by pretreatment with i.v. CGRP(8-37). Escott et al. Brain Res 1995 669:93; inter alia drilled into the rat skull and used brain electrodes to electrically stimulate the trigeminal ganglion and measured laser Doppler facial blood flow in a terminal procedure in sodium pentobarb anesthetized rats involving neuromuscular blockade, tracheal intubation and artificial ventilation. The effect was blocked by pretreatment with CGRP(8-37). Escott et al. BrJPhannacol 1993 110, 772-6; inter alia used intradermal (i.d.) CGRP as the stimulus to increase blood flow in rat abdominal skin of sodium pentobarb anesthetized animals outfitted with cannulated jugular veins for anesthetic and drug delivery. The effect was blocked by pretreatment with i.v. CGRP(8-37). Chu et al. Neuwsci Lett 2001 310,169-72 used inter alia i.d. CGRP as the stimulus in rats and measured laser Doppler changes in blood flow in the skin of the back in a terminal method using sodium pentobarb anesthetized and tracheal cannulated animals; and showed pretreatment blockade by continuous release of CGRP(8-37) from subcutaneously (s.c.) implanted osmotic pumps. Hall et al BrJPhannacol 1995 114, 592-7 and Hall et al BrJPhannacol 1999 126,280-4 inter alia used topical CGRP to increase hamster cheek pouch<br><br>
arteriole diameter, and i.d. CGRP to increase blood flow in rat dorsal skin of sodium pentobarb anesthetized animals outfitted with cannulated jugular veins for anesthetic and drug delivery. The effect was blocked by pretreatment with i.v. CGRP(8-37). Doods et al. Br J Pharmacol. 2000 Feb;129(3):420-3 inter alia drilled into the skull of the marmoset (new world monkey) and used brain electrodes to produce electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion and measured facial blood flow in an invasive terminal procedure involving neuromuscular blockade and artificial ventilation of sodium pentobarbital anesthetized primates. Increase in flow was blocked by pretreatment of a small molecule CGRP antagonist. See also WO 03/272252 Isolated DNA Molecules Encoding Humanized Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Receptor, Related Non-Human Transgenic Animals and Assay Methods. Thus the method of the present invention procedure being inter alia a non-invasive survival model in primates measuring exogenous CGRP-induced changes in facial blood flow and demonstrating pre- and post-treatment effects of peptide and small molecule CGRP antagonists in spontaneously breathing isoflurane anesthetized marmosets who recover from the procedure offers significant advantages.<br>
A number of non-peptidic, small molecule CGRP-receptor antagonists have been recently reported. WO 97/09046 and equivalents disclose inter alia quinine and quinidine related compounds which are ligands, in particular antagonists, of CGRP-receptor. WO 98/09630 and WO 98/56779 and equivalents disclose inter alia variously substituted, nitrobenzamide compounds as CGRP-receptor antagonists. WO 01/32649, WO 01/49676, and WO 01/32648 and equivalents disclose inter alia a series of 4-ox.obutanamides and related cyclopropane derivatives as CGRP-receptor antagonists.  WO 00/18764, WO 98/11128 and WO 00/55154 and equivalents disclose inter alia benzimidazolinyl piperidines as antagonists to CGRP-receptor. Unrelated to CGRP, a series of somatostatin antagonists have been disclosed in WO 99/52875 and WO 01/25228 and equivalents. See also U.S. 6,344,449, U.S. 6,313,097, U.S. 6,521,609, U.S. 6,552,043 and related applications. Thus, novel CGRP-receptor antagonists effective for the treatment of neurogenie inflammation, migraine and other disorders would be greatly advantageous.<br><br><br>

[125I]-CGRP (Amersham Biosciences) was diluted to 60 pM in assay buffer and a volume of 50 uj was added to each well. SK-N-MC pellets were thawed, diluted in assay buffer with fresh 0.1% mammalian protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), and homogenized again. SK-N-MC homogenate (5 n,g/well) was added in a volume of 100 uj. The assay plates were then incubated at room temperature for two hours. Assays were stopped by addition of excess cold wash buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 0.1% BSA) immediately followed by filtration over glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/B) previously soaked in 0. 5% PEL Non-specific binding was defined with 1 j.iM beta-CGRP.

Cyclic AMP Assay<br>
Functional Antagonism. Antagonism of the compounds of invention was determined<br>
by measuring the formation of cyclic AMP (adenosine 3'5'-cyclic monophosphate) in SK-N-MC cells that endogenously express the human CGRP receptor. CGRP receptor complex is coupled with Gs protein and CGRP binding to this complex leads to the cyclic AMP production via Gs - dependent activation of an adenylate cyclase (Juaneda C et al., TiPS, 2000; 21:432-438; incorporated by reference herein). Consequently, CGRP receptor antagonists inhibit CGRP - induced cyclic AMP formation in SK-N-MC cells (Doods H et al., Br J Pharmacol,2000; 129(3):420-423) ; incorporated by reference herein). For cyclic AMP measurements SK-N-MC cells were incubated with 0.3 nM CGRP alone or in the presence of various concentrations of the compounds of invention for 30 min at room temperature. Compounds of<br><br>
invention were pre-incubated with SK-N-MC cells for 15 minutes before the addition of CGRP to allow receptor occupancy (Edvinsson et al., Eur J Pharmacol, 2001, 415:39-44; incorporated by reference herein). Cyclic AMP was extracted using the lysis reagent and its concentration was determined by radioimmunoassay using RPA559 cAMP SPA Direct Screening Assay Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). IC50 values were calculated using Excel fit. The tested compounds of invention were determined to be antagonists as they exhibited a dose - dependent inhibition of the CGRP - induced cyclic AMP production. See Table 3 for summary of results.<br>
Schild Analysis. Schild analysis can be used to characterize the nature of antagonism of the compounds of invention. The dose response of CGRP stimulated cAMP production was generated either with CGRP alone, or in the presence of various concentrations of compounds of invention. The antagonist dose is plotted asX against the dose ratio (defined as IC50 of agonist with the presence of the compounds divided by the 1C50 of the agonist alone) minus 1 as Y. Linear regression was then performed with both X and Y axis log-transformed. A slope that does not differ significantly from unity (1) indicates competitive antagonism. K^ is the dissociation constant of the antagonist.<br><br>

Ex Vivo Human Cerebral Artery Assay<br>
Rationale and Overview. To provided direct evidence of the ability for novel compounds to reverse CGRP-induced dilation in human cerebral vessels, an ex vivo assay was designed.  Briefly, isolated vessel rings were mounted in a tissue bath where vessels were pre-contracted with potassium chloride (KC1) and fully dilated with hCGRP, then this relaxation was reversed by the cumulative addition of CGRP-receptor antagonists (complete details follow).<br>
Tissue Samples. Autopsy samples of human arteries were obtained from vendors (ABS Inc. or NDRI). All vessels were transported on ice-cold HEPES buffer (composition in mM: NaCl 130, KC14, KH2PO4 1.2, MgSO4 1.2, CaC12 1.8, Glucose 6, NaHCO3 4, HEPES 10, EDTA 0.025). Upon receipt, the vessels were placed in cold Kreb's buffer (composition in mM: NaCl 118.4, KC14.7, KH2PO4 1.2, MgSO4 1.2, CaC12 1.8, Glucose 10.1, NaHCOS 25) saturated with carbogen (5% CO2 and 95 % oxygen).<br>
Isolated Tissue Baths. The vessels were cleaned of connective tissues and cut into cylindrical segments of 4-5mm in length. The vessels were then mounted in tissue baths between two stainless steel hooks; one of which is fixed and the other of which was connected to a force displacement transducer. The vessel tension was continuously recorded using a data acquisition system (Powerlab, ADInstruments, Mountain View, CA) connected to the transducer. The tissue baths containing Krebs buffer and mounted vessels were temperature (37 °C) and pH (7.4) controlled with continuous bubbling of carbogen. The artery segments were allowed to equilibrate for about 30-45 minutes until a stable resting tone was achieved. Prior to the assay,<br>
vessels were primed (conditioned) with 100 mM KC1 and subsequently washed. The vessels were pre-contracted with 10 mM KC1 and fully dilated with 1 nM hCGRP. Concentration-response curves to CGRP-receptor antagonists were performed by the cumulative addition of drugs in half log units in fully dilated vessels. At each concentration, the effects of the drugs were expressed as % reversal of CGRP-induced relaxation in each vessel. The actual assay and data analysis were performed for each vessel individually, fitting the concentration-response data to a four parameter logistic function by non-linear regression analysis, to estimate the EC50 values. A summary of results is provided in Table 3.<br>
Non-Terminal Method for Assessing In Vivo Efficacy of Small Molecule CGRP-receptor antagonists in Mammals<br>
Overview. Blocking cerebral artery dilation induced by calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has been proposed as a treatment for migraine headache, however, novel small molecule CGRP-receptor antagonists have shown species-specific differences with relatively poor activity in rodents (Mallee et al. J Biol Chem 2002 277:14294) requiring new models for assessment of in vivo efficacy. Non-human primates (e.g., marmosets) are the only animals known to have human-like CGRP receptor pharmacology conferred by the presence of the specific amino acid residue (Trp74) in their RAMP1 sequence which is responsible for the phenotype of the human receptor (Mallee et al. J Biol Chem 2002 277:14294). Since current migraine models primarily use rats (Escott et al. Brain Res 1995 669:93; Williamson et al. Cephalalgia 1997 17:525), or are invasive, terminal procedures in primates (Doods et al. Br J Pharmacol 2000 129:420), a novel non-invasive, survival model in non-human primates for in vivo efficacy assessment of CGRP-receptor antagonists as in the present invention is a significant contribution. While it is known that trigeminal activation increases both cerebral (Goadsby &amp; Edvinsson, 1993) and facial blood flow (Doods et al., 2000), demonstration of a direct relationship between facial blood flow and cerebral artery dilation conducted in the same animals was not known. Therefore, before initiating studies in non-human primates, laser Doppler measurement of facial blood flow was directly validated in the rat as a surrogate for cerebral artery dilation in terminal studies that measured both cerebral artery<br>
diameter and changes in facial blood flow in the same animals (see Figure 2. Direct Validation of Facial Blood Flow as Surrogate for Cerebral Artery Dilation in the Rat). In both measures, comparable increases were induced by i.v. CGRP and blocked by the peptide antagonist hccCGRP(8-37). Next, the method of i.v. CGRP-induced changes in facial blood flow was validated as a recovery model in isoflurane anesthetized rats using haCGRP(8-37). The survival method was then established in non-human primates and a dose-response study characterizing i.v. CGRP activity was completed (see Figure 3. Dose-Response for hccCGRP in Non-Human-Primate Laser Doppler Facial Blood Flow). Peptide and small-molecule CGRP-receptor antagonists were used to validate the non-human primate model. Pre-treatment with small molecule antagonists or haCGRP(8-37) dose-dependently inhibited i.v. CGRP-stimulated increases in primate facial blood flow (see Figure 4. Inhibitition of CGRP-Induced Changes in Non-Human Primate Facial Blood Flow), without altering blood pressure (see Figure 5. Effect of CGRP Antagonist on Non-Human Primate Blood Pressure). Post-treatment of antagonists also reversed CGRP-induced increases in facial blood flow (not shown). This survival model provides a novel, non-invasive recovery procedure for evaluating prophylactic and abortive effects of CGRP-receptor antagonists in non-human primates, or in transgenic animals with humanized RAMP1 (Trp74) which have similar CGRP receptor pharmacology, as a surrogate marker for activity in cerebral vessel diameter.<br>
Animals. Adult male and female common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) purchased from Harlan and weighing 350-550 g served as subjects. Other mammals endogenously expressing RAMP1 having Trp 74 or transgenic mammals with humanized RAMP1 having Trp 74 can also be employed in the method described herein.<br>
Anesthesia &amp; Surgical Preparation. Animals are anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation in an induction chamber (4-5% rapid induction, maintained with 1-2.5%; Solomon et al., 1999). Anesthesia is maintained by delivering a constant supply of ainoxygen (50:50) and isoflurane via face mask, or by intubation and ventilation (with blood gas monitoring). Body temperature is maintained at 38 ± 0.5 °C by<br>
placement on an automated temperature controlled surface with rectal probe. A small area of fur (approx. 1.5 cm square) is removed from one or both sides of the face by application of a depilatory cream and/or shaving. Surgical areas are clipped and prepared with betadine. An i.v. line is placed in any accessible vein for the administration of test compounds and CGRP-receptor agonist and, if needed, withdrawal of blood samples (max 2.5 nil, 10%) for blood gas monitoring and content analysis. A solution of 5% dextrose is administered i.v. in order to maintain blood sugar levels. Anesthesia depth is monitored by measuring blood pressure and heart rate using a non-invasive arm cuff method and a pulse oximeter, respectively. Guanethidine 5-10 mg/kg i.v., supplemented with 5 mg/kg i.v. as needed, may be given to stabilize the peak flux in facial blood flow seen with repeated stimulation-induced changes in blood flow (Escott et al., 1999; incorporated by reference herein). Microvascular blood flow is monitored by attaching a self adhesive laser Doppler flow probe to the facial skin.<br>
Compound Administration Test compounds may be administered i.v. (0.01-5 ml/kg), i.m. (0.01-0.5 ml/kg), s.c. (0.01-5 ml/kg) orp.o. (0.1-10 ml/kg) (Diehl et al., 2001; incorporated by reference herein). CGRP-receptor agonists may be delivered i.v. (0.01-5 ml/kg), i.d. (10-100 /^I/site) or s.c. (10-100 jtl/site).<br>
Laser Doppler Flowmetry A control increase in facial blood flow is induced by administration of a vasodilator, such as CGRP (0.05-100 /tg/kg i.v.) or 2-20 pmol/site i.d) or adrenomedullin (ADM, 0.05-5 mg/kg i.v. or 10-100 pmol/site i.d.). Test compound or vehicle is administered either before (pre-treatment) or after (post-treatment) subsequent repeat administration of the vasodilating agent, providing the ability to assess prophylactic or therapeutic actions. Blood pressure is monitored continuously to ensure adequate depth of anesthesia, and anesthetic is adjusted to maintain stable levels that match pre-treatment values. During collection of laser Doppler flowmetry data, isoflurane may be reduced to 0.25-0.75% as previous electrophysiologic studies in marmosets found that recordings were sensitive to isoflurane concentration (Solomon, 1999; incorporated by reference herein). To<br>
reduce the number of animals used, the effect of test compound on i.v. vasodilator-induced changes in blood flow may be repeated up to 6 times in a single session.<br>
Recovery Animals are returned to the transport cage which is placed on a temperature controlled surface to keep the animals warm until fully awake and ambulatory. Animals may be tested again after 7-14 days rest, and may be tested repeatedly at 7-14 day intervals depending on the health of the animal.<br>

Departures from Other Migraine Models. This invention represents a novel migraine model and is remarkably distinct from other migraine models. Some of the distinguishing characteristics of the method of the present invention include: (i) the<br>
only survival model of migraine in any species; (ii) the only model to demonstrate the abortive (post-treatment) effects of CGRP antagonists on active induced increases in blood flow; (iii) the only demonstration of a direct relationship between facial blood flow and intracranial artery dilation carried out in the same animals; (iv) the only model to use non-invasive surgical techniques, and does not require catheter placement, intubation, or neuromuscular blockade; (v) the only primate model to use exogenous CGRP as the stimulus and demonstrate pretreatment blockade by CGRP antagonism and post-treatment reversal by CGRP antagonism; (vi) the only migraine model to use isoflurane anesthesia in spontaneously breathing animals.
