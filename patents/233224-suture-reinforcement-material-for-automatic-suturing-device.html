				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
SUTURE REINFORCEMENT MATERIAL FOR AUTOMATIC SUTURING DEVICE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a tubular suture<br>
reinforcement material suitable for use in automatic suturing devices<br>
that are widely used in surgical operations, etc. More specifically,<br>
the present invention relates to a tubular suture reinforcement<br>
material with which a tubular shape is easily obtained, productivity<br>
is high, and removal of thread is easily achieved.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hitherto, stapler-type automatic suturing devices<br>
containing a plurality of staples have been employed for suturing<br>
tissues. However, when such a suturing device is applied to pulmonary<br>
surgery, etc., air leakage may occur from the sutured area. In<br>
addition, when applied to soft tissues, problems of tissue damage or<br>
tear may arise.<br>
In order to solve the above problems, the applicant has<br>
already filed previous applications relating to tubular suture<br>
reinforcement materials to be fitted to a staple part of the suturing<br>
device, thereby preventing air leakage from the sutured area,<br>
reinforcing the area, etc. (e.g., Japanese Registered Utility Model<br>
No. 2604025; Japanese Patent Nos. 3136392, 3237749, and 3237750;<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Nos. 1997-24050, 1997-308635,<br>
2000-157622, 2000-316963, and 2001-70433).<br>
As other applicants' applications relating to tubular<br>
suture reinforcement materials, Japanese Patent No. 3040930 and<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 1996-299427 can be<br>
mentioned.<br>
The above-mentioned applications disclose a structure<br>
wherein a sheet-like material, such as a nonwoven fabric or film made<br>
of a biodegradable and bioabsorbable material, is formed into a tubular<br>
shape, or a structure wherein a nonwoven fabric made of a biodegradable<br>
and bioabsorbable material and a stretchable fabric are integrally<br>
combined to form a tubular shape. The tubular shape is obtained, for<br>
example, by a method for temporarily adhering both ends (both edges)<br>
of stacked sheet-like materials and a method for basting both ends<br>
thereof using rough stitches. More specifically, a running stitch<br>
in which the front and back sides of stacked sheet-like materials are<br>
stitched in turn can be mentioned as an example.<br>
Temporary adhesion or basting of the sheet-like material<br>
as described above are conducted for the purpose of easily separating<br>
a suture reinforcement material that is to be removed with a lesion<br>
from a suture reinforcement material that is to be left in a human<br>
body, when the lesion is removed from the human body after the affected<br>
region has been sutured and the lesion is cut off from normal tissues<br>
using an automatic suturing device equipped with a suture<br>
reinforcement material.<br>
However, the tubular suture reinforcement material<br>
manufactured using temporary adhesion is disadvantageous in that<br>
sheet-like materials joined by adhesion tend to separate from each<br>
other, and the tubular suture reinforcement material manufactured<br>
using a running stitch is disadvantageous in that the sewing manner<br>
requires a lot of time and skill, and removal of thread is difficult<br>
depending on the kind of sheet-like material, sewing pitch, etc.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention aims to overcome the above-described<br>
drawbacks. The invention provides a novel suture reinforcement<br>
material for an automatic suturing device that can be manufactured<br>
without requiring advanced skill and from which a thread can be very<br>
smoothly removed irrespective of the kind of material used and the<br>
sewing pitch of the suture reinforcement material.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter, the invention will be described in detail.<br>
A sheet-like material of the invention is made of a material<br>
suitably selected from nonbioabsorbable materials, such as polyamide,<br>
polyester, silicone, fluororesin, etc., and biodegradable and<br>
bioabsorbable materials, such as polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid,<br>
a copolymer of glycolic acid and lactic acid, a copolymer of glycolic<br>
acid and caprolacton, a copolymer of glycolic acid and caprolacton,<br>
or a mixture thereof, polyparadioxanone, polycaprolactone, chitin,<br>
animal tissues, and the like. Examples of formations of the<br>
sheet-like material include a knitted material, a woven material, a<br>
nonwoven fabric, a film, a sheet, a sponge sheet, etc., made of the<br>
above-mentioned nonbioabsorbable materials and/or biodegradable and<br>
bioabsorbable materials.<br>
Particularly preferable materials include nonwoven<br>
fabrics made of polyglycolic acid, which is excellent in flexibility,<br>
breathability, rigidity, thickness, blood absorbing properties, ease<br>
of staple penetration, and hydrolyzability. Such nonwoven fabrics<br>
can be prepared by a suitable method, such as a needle punching method,<br>
a meltblown method, or the like.<br>
The suture reinforcement material of the invention is formed<br>
into a tubular shape by sewing both ends of one sheet-like material<br>
after the one sheet-like material is folded or by stacking two<br>
sheet-like materials, and then sewing both ends of the stacked<br>
sheet-like materials. When two sheet-like materials are stacked to<br>
form a tubular material, one of the two sheet-like materials may be<br>
a stretchable material. Preferable examples of such stretchable<br>
sheet-like materials include knitted or woven materials with<br>
stretchability in lengthwise and/or crosswise directions, in which<br>
rubber threads, polyurethane-based elastic threads, crimped threads,<br>
and bulky yarns, etc. are suitably interknitted or interwoven. A<br>
suture reinforcement material prepared by combining a stretchable<br>
material with a non-stretchable material facilitates fitting of the<br>
suture reinforcement material to an automatic suturing device,<br>
adjustment (position correction) after fitting, etc., and thus is<br>
preferable.<br>
Although there is no limitation to the mode of knitting or<br>
weaving of the stretchable sheet-like material, a powernet fabric<br>
produced by warp knitting stretchable threads obtained by covering<br>
polyurethane threads by nylon threads is preferable in view of easy<br>
cutting, easy sewing during formation of a tubular material, shape<br>
stability, etc.<br>
In the case of using one sheet-like material, the tubular<br>
material can be obtained by sewing together both ends of one sheet-like<br>
material that is cut according to the outer surface dimensions of a<br>
suturing device, after the one sheet-like material is folded.<br>
Alternatively, in the case of using two sheet-like materials, the<br>
tubular material can be obtained by stacking them, and then sewing<br>
together both ends of the sheet-like materials.<br>
The term "tubular" used herein denotes that both ends of a<br>
sheet-like material are joined together, and a tubular shape may be<br>
a cylinder, a prism, or a plane.<br>
The sewing methods for obtaining the tubular shape can be<br>
suitably selected from the method for sewing both ends of the<br>
sheet-like material (s) in parallel, the method for sewing the tip part<br>
thereof in a tapering manner, or the method for sewing the tip part<br>
thereof in a bag-like manner, etc. The tapered or bag-like tip part<br>
is advantageous in that the tubular material can be easily fitted to<br>
a suturing device.<br>
Although any threads used for sewing clothes can be generally<br>
used for sewing both ends, biodegradable and bioabsorbable surgical<br>
sutures, such as those made of polyglycolic acid, a copolymer of<br>
glycolic acid and lactic acid, a copolymer of lactic acid and<br>
caprolacton, etc., are preferable. This is because the suture<br>
reinforcement material is for use in medical applications, and the<br>
material might be erroneously left in the human body.<br>
The invention is characterized by the use of a chain stitch<br>
(intralooping stitch) with a single thread as a stitching style. The<br>
chain stitch (intralooping stitch) with a single thread creates<br>
stitches in which loops are formed with a single thread.<br>
Specific examples of stitching styles of the invention are<br>
shown in Figs. 1 to 7, but the invention is not limited thereto. The<br>
term "needle-insertion side" used in the following denotes the<br>
needle-insertion side of the stacked sheet-like materials, i.e., the<br>
upper side as viewed in the figures, and the term "rear side" denotes<br>
the side opposite to the needle-insertion side of the stacked<br>
sheet-like materials, i.e., the bottom side as viewed in the figures.<br>
In Figs. I to 6, the stacked sheet-like materials are not illustrated.<br>
Fig. 1 shows that a loop 3 passes through the stacked<br>
sheet-like materials from the needle-insertion side, and then is<br>
secured by intralooping with a succeeding loop on the rear side of<br>
the stacked sheet-like materials . In the invention, the "chain stitch<br>
(intralooping stitch)" denotes that a loop of thread passes through<br>
another loop formed by the same thread.<br>
Fig. 2 shows that a loop 3 passes into the stacked sheet-like<br>
materials from the needle-insertion side, appears on the<br>
needle-insertion side through a part of the stacked sheet-like<br>
materials, and then is secured by intralooping with a succeeding loop<br>
at the following needle-penetration point. Hereinafter, the phrase<br>
"appearing on the needle-insertion side after passing through a part<br>
of the sheet-like material" includes the case where a loop appears<br>
on the needle-insertion side passing across the end surface of the<br>
stacked sheet-like materials, the case where a loop appears on the<br>
needle-insertion side penetrating the sheet-like materials, etc.<br>
Fig. 3 shows that a loop 3 passes through the stacked<br>
sheet-like materials from the needle-insertion side, goes slightly<br>
ahead, passes through the stacked sheet-like materials to appear on<br>
the needle-insertion side, and then is secured by intralooping with<br>
a succeeding loop at the next needle-penetration point on the<br>
needle-insertion side of the sheet-like material.<br>
Fig. 4 shows that a loop 3 enters the stacked sheet-like<br>
materials from the needle-insertion side, passes through a part of<br>
the stacked sheet-like materials to appear on the needle-insertion<br>
side, and then is secured by intralooping with a succeeding loop at<br>
the next needle-penetration point on a stitch formation line (sewed<br>
line).<br>
Fig. 5 shows a modified example of the stitching style of<br>
Fig. 1, forming a zigzag pattern.<br>
Fig. 6 shows that a loop 3 passes through to appear on the<br>
rear side of the stacked sheet-like materials from the<br>
needle-insertion side, goes slightly back, passes through the stacked<br>
sheet-like materials to appear on the needle-insertion side, and then<br>
the loop 3 is secured by intralooping with a succeeding loop 3 which<br>
passes through the stacked sheet-like materials.<br>
Fig. 7 shows that a loop 3 goes through the stacked sheet-like<br>
materials and a loop that has already passed across the stacked<br>
sheet-like materials to appear on the needle-insertion side of the<br>
stacked sheet-like materials, and further the loop passing through<br>
is extended to the next needle-penetration point across the end surface<br>
of the stacked sheet-like materials.<br>
In each figure, the reference numeral 1 denotes a thread end<br>
at the sewing start, and the reference numeral 2 denotes a thread end<br>
at the sewing end. In Fig. 1, the reference numerals denote as follows:<br>
3, a loop; 7, stitches on the front side, and 8, stitches on the back<br>
side.<br>
Each example above shows a chain stitch (intralooping<br>
stitch) made by a single thread. In the chain stitch (intralooping<br>
stitch), by pulling the thread end(s) 2 at the sewing end(s), the<br>
thread(s) is removed from the formed loops, and thus the sewed seams<br>
are smoothly unstitched. Such sewing can be done by hand, and as a<br>
matter of fact, a commercially-available sewing machine can also be<br>
used. In the latter case, sewing can be done very efficiently.<br>
It is preferable to extend the thread end by a suitable length<br>
so that a part of the suture reinforcement material to be removed with<br>
the lesion (e.g., powernet fabric) can be easily separated from a part<br>
of the suture reinforcement material to be left in the human body (for<br>
example, a biodegradable and bioabsorbable material) . The extended<br>
thread ends at the sewing ends may be tied in the shape of a ring.<br>
As another example, the thread end(s) at the sewing start(s) may be<br>
tied to the sheet-like material (e.g., powernet fabric), and the<br>
extended thread ends at the sewing ends may be tied in the shape of<br>
a ring (annular) . In this case, the thread can be very easily removed,<br>
and the sheet-like material (e.g., powernet fabric) can be easily<br>
removed with the sewing thread after a surgical operation.<br>
In order to prevent the thread from being unintentionally<br>
drawn out from the suture reinforcement material, a stopper may be<br>
provided in a loop on the side of the thread end (s) at the sewing end (s),<br>
the thread end(s) may be passed through the anterior loop continuous<br>
to the thread end(s) at the sewing end(s), or the loop on the side<br>
10<br>
of the sewing end(s) may be passed through the immediately anterior<br>
loop, and may be tied by a single knot.<br>
Automatic suturing devices to which the suture reinforcement<br>
material of the invention can be applied include MULTIFIRE GIA80,<br>
MULTIFIRE GIA60, MULTIFIRE GIA50, and MULTIFIRE GIA90P (manufactured<br>
by U.S. SURGICAL) , PROXIMATE LINEAR CUTTER 55 mm and PROXIMATE LINEAR<br>
CUTTER 75 mm (manufactured by Ethicon Endo-Surgery), ENDO GIA(2)30,<br>
ENDO GIA(2)45, and ENDO GIA (2) 60 (manufactured by U.S. SURGICAL), and<br>
ENDOPATH END CUTTER ETS45 and ENDOPATH END CUTTER ETS EZ45<br>
(manufactured by Ethicon Endo-Surgery) .<br>
The suture reinforcement material of the invention is<br>
applied to a suturing device by encapsulating (fitting) it in both<br>
or either of a cartridge containing a staple and/or a frame having<br>
a staple receiving slot.<br>
In this case, to simplify the fitting of the tubular suture<br>
reinforcement material to an automatic suturing device, the sewing<br>
end portion(s) of the sheet-like material (s) forming the tubular<br>
suture reinforcement material can be extended to form a projection.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter, the suture reinforcement material of the<br>
invention will be described with reference to the drawings, but is<br>
not limited thereto.<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
Figs. 8 and 9 show the suture reinforcement material of the<br>
invention manufactured by the stitching style shown in Fig. 1. Fig.<br>
8 is a tubular suture reinforcement material 4 that is prepared by<br>
stacking a biodegradable and bioabsorbable nonwoven fabric 5 and a<br>
stretchable powernet 6, and sewing together both ends of the stacked<br>
materials with a DH-type chain stitching machine manufactured by<br>
Pegasus. Fig. 9 shows a bag-like tubular suture reinforcement<br>
material 4 whose tip part is closed. The bag-like tubular suture<br>
reinforcement material is obtained by folding one sheet of the nonwoven<br>
fabric 5, stacking both ends, and sewing them in a tubular shape with<br>
the same sewing machine as described above.<br>
Although not illustrated, as a modified example of Fig. 8,<br>
a suture reinforcement material whose tip part is sewed in a tapering<br>
manner can also be mentioned.<br>
In either case, the thread end(s) 2 at the sewing end(s) are<br>
suitably extended for easy removal of thread.<br>
Two pieces of the suture reinforcement material 4 thus<br>
obtained are individually fitted to a cartridge 11 containing staples<br>
and a frame 12 of the automatic suturing device 10 of Fig. 10 for use,<br>
as shown in an enlarged view of Fig. 11. The suture reinforcement<br>
material is fitted to the automatic suturing device 10 in such a manner<br>
that the extended thread end 2 at the sewing end is placed frontward,<br>
i.e., at the gripping part of the automatic suturing device 10.<br>
Embodiment 2<br>
Fig. 12 shows a structure of a suture reinforcement material<br>
according to another embodiment. The suture reinforcement material<br>
is a tubular suture reinforcement material, which is obtained by<br>
stacking a biodegradable and bioabsorbable nonwoven fabric 5 and a<br>
stretchable powernet fabric 6, and sewing both ends. The thread end<br>
1 at the sewing start is joined to the powernet fabric 6 and the thread<br>
ends 2 at the both sewing ends are tied to form a ring (annular).<br>
This structure with the ring-shaped thread end 2 at the sewing<br>
end facilitates the handling of the material and the removal of the<br>
thread. Further, since the thread end 1 at the sewing start is tied<br>
to the powernet material 6, the power net material is easily removed<br>
with the thread after a surgical operation.<br>

Figs. 13 and 14 each show another suture reinforcement<br>
material according to another embodiment that is structured to prevent<br>
the thread ends 2 at the sewing ends from unraveling.<br>
Fig. 13 shows that a stopper 9 passes through loops 3 of the<br>
thread ends 2 at the sewing end. The stopper 9 may be thread,<br>
finely-cut material or film, etc., and materials other than a fiber<br>
may be used. A suitably rigid material that can easily be passed<br>
through the loop and drawn out from the loop is preferable.<br>
Fig. 14 shows a suture reinforcement material in which the<br>
thread ends 2 at the sewing ends are passed through the anterior loops<br>
3 continuous to the thread ends 2, thereby preventing the thread ends<br>
2 at the sewing ends from unraveling as described above. The thread<br>
end 2 is passed through the loop 3 by the following steps 1 to 4 as<br>
shown in the figure. The thread ends 2 at the sewing ends are passed<br>
through the loop 3, and finally, the thread ends 2 are pulled to secure<br>
it.<br>
These methods for preventing the thread from unraveling keep<br>
the thread from being drawn out from the suture reinforcement material<br>
due to any tension that is unintentionally applied to the thread end<br>
2. Accordingly, after the predetermined suturing process is complete,<br>
the thread is drawn out from the loop 3 by removing the stopper,<br>
returning the thread end passing through the loop 3 to the original<br>
position, or pulling the thread.<br>
Fig. 15 shows another method for preventing a thread from<br>
unraveling.<br>
In the structure, the loop 3 at the sewing end is passed<br>
through a loop immediately before the loop 3 and is fixed by a single<br>
knot 15, thereby preventing the loop 3 from being drawn out from the<br>
sheet. More specifically, this structure can prevent the seam from<br>
unraveling, which is caused by tension applied when the material is<br>
fitted to a cartridge or a frame. After the suturing is complete,<br>
the edge of the biodegradable and bioabsorbable nonwoven fabric 5 is<br>
torn by pulling the thread end, and subsequently the seam is unraveled.<br>
Thus, the powernet material 6 can be easily removed together with the<br>
sewing thread.<br>
Any methods for preventing threads from unraveling can be<br>
employed in addition to the above methods. For example, a thread end<br>
can be temporarily adhered to a sheet-like material by applying<br>
adhesive to the sheet-like material, or a thread end can be temporarily<br>
fixed to a sheet-like material by adhesive tape, etc.<br>
Embodiment 4<br>
Fig. 16 shows a structure of a tubular suture reinforcement<br>
material which can be easily fitted to an automatic suturing device.<br>
More specifically, the sewing end portion of sheet-like materials<br>
forming the tubular suture reinforcement material is extended to form<br>
a projection 14. In this example, the sewing end portion of the<br>
powernet fabric 6 is cut in a convex shape to form the projection 14.<br>
By pulling the projection 14, the tubular suture reinforcement<br>
material can be easily fitted to an automatic suturing device.<br>
The projection 14 may be suitably formed into any shape and<br>
set to any dimensions considering its operability. Any method can<br>
be employed for forming a projection to the powernet fabric 6, in<br>
addition to cutting the material as described above. For example,<br>
such projection may be formed by adhering or sewing other materials,<br>
such as cloth, film, etc. The projection may be formed on a side of<br>
the biodegradable and bioabsorbable nonwoven fabric 5 side or on both<br>
sides of the nonwoven fabric 5 and the powernet material 6.<br>
EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the suture reinforcement material of the invention, a seam<br>
can be easily formed with an already-existing sewing machine, etc.<br>
Therefore, a tubular suture reinforcement material can be<br>
manufactured without requiring skill, and further the productivity<br>
is high and there are no variations in quality. As compared with<br>
stitches made by the conventional running stitch, a thread is smoothly<br>
removed, arid a sheet-like material can be separated with no<br>
difficulties after a surgical operation. Further, the suture<br>
reinforcement material of the invention can be easily fitted to an<br>
automatic suturing device and the unraveling of threads can be<br>
prevented during the process.<br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	A tubular suture reinforcement material for an automatic suturing device, wherein both ends of one or two sheet-like materials are sewed using a chain stitch (intralooping stitch) with a single thread to form a tubular shape, one or two thread ends at one or two sewing ends are suitably extended, and the extended thread end is passed through an anterior loop continuous to the thread end, thereby preventing a thread from unraveling.<br>
2.	A tubular suture reinforcement material for an automatic suturing device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the tip part of the suture reinforcement material is sewed in a tapering manner or sewed into a bag-like shape.<br>
3.	A tubular suture reinforcement material for an automatic suturing device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein at least one portion of the sheet-like material is made of at least one member selected from the group consisting of knitted materials, woven materials, nonwoven fabrics, and film, the at least one member being made of a biodegradable and bioabsorbable material.<br>
4.	A tubular suture reinforcement material for an automatic suturing device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the sheet-like material and a stretchable knitted material or woven material are stacked into a tubular shape.<br>
5.	A tubular suture reinforcement material for an automatic suturing device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein a projection is formed on the sewing end portion of the one or two sheet-like materials forming the tubular shape.<br>
6.	A tubular suture reinforcement material for art automatic suturing device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein extended thread ends at the sewing end are tied in a ring shape.<br>
7.	A method for manufacturing a tubular suture reinforcement material for an automatic suturing device comprising:<br>
sewing both ends of one or two sheet-like materials using a chain stitch (intralooping stitch) with a single thread to give a tubular suture reinforcement material,<br>
suitably extending one or two thread ends at one or two sewing ends, and<br>
the extended thread end is passed through an anterior loop continuous to the thread end, thereby preventing a thread from unraveling.<br>
8.	An automatic suturing device, comprising a cartridge containing staples<br>
and a frame equipped with a staple receiving slot, wherein a tubular<br>
suture reinforcement material for an automatic suturing device as<br>
claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5 is fitted to the cartridge and/or the<br>
