				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a multipurpose kit for the management of insects or rodents. The term management of insects includes monitoring, capturing and other modes of controlling the insects . In other words the device of the present invaition can be used for controlling the insects by capturing them by attracting, collecting and subsequently killing them. Accordingly the multipurpose device of the present invention can be used as zoological monitoring traps (e.g. light trap, sticky trap, fly trap, moth trap, pheromone trap, pitfall trap for insects; rodent trap), keeping means such as hive. In other words, the device of the present invention can be used for multiple apphcations for the management of various kinds of insects, including rodents. The device of the present invention can be of various sizes, shapes and colours to suit the particular requirement, application and the nature of insects. Irmumerable types of devices are known in the art for the management of insects such as traps and hives, published or patented. Most such devices are meant for a particular purpose with limited range of apphcations. For instance, insect traps can trap only insects but not other animals like rodents and vice versa Different model bee hives can be used only for keeping bees.<br>
The following are the illustrations of a few of the known devices.<br>
The modified Robinson light trap as described by Taylor and Brown (1972) and illustrated in Fig, A consists of a glass beaker (1) that protects the bulb (2) from rain, vertical baffle plates (3) that intersect the flying insects, a metal cone(4), a metal drum (5) and a drainage funnel (6) with metal gauze (7). The drawbacks  of this  trap are  that<br><br>
t is not handy and that it can be used only as a light trap. Nematoceran insects like nidges are difficult to collect in this trap. It employs only one source of light. Vlodel of Rothamsted light trap shown in Fig. B used in India (Kundu, 1985) :onsists of a G.I sheet roof (8) that covers an electric bulb (9), glass sheets (10) that direct attracted insects into a collecting container (11), a platform (12) that supports the glass sheets (10), a collecting container (11) and stand (13). This trap also has the drawbacks as that of modified Robinson light trap.<br>
The Pilani light trap shown in Fig. C is a modification of Rothamsted light trap (Kundu, 1985). It consists of wooden poles (14) with holder to adjust the height of the shelves (15), a G.I. sheet roof (16), an electric bulb (17), funnel (18), a collecting jar (19) in which killing agent (20) is taken. In addition to the drawbacks of the earlier two traps, it lacks baffles.<br>
The ICRISAT fly trap shown in Fig. D as described by Natarajan and Chelliah (1983) consists of a container (21) with entry ports (22), in which a fly attractant and insecticide soaked cotton are taken in two separate dispensers (23), a funnel (24), a collecting jar (25) and a stand (26). This trap is disadvantageous in that it needs a killing agent to kill the attracted flies.<br>
The ICRISAT standard pheromone trap shown in Fig. E as described by Pawar et al (1988) consists of a white plastic funnel (27) with an aluminium plate (28) rivetted above at a clearance of 5 cm. The pheromone source (29) is suspended below the plate at the centre. Insects are retained in the collecting polythene bag(30) wired below the funnel (27). The drawbacks of this trap are that it can be<br><br>
used only as a pheromone trap and that swift flying tiny insects like cotton pink boUworm moths cannot be trapped.<br>
The pheromone trap (Kendall, 1982) as illustrated in Fig. F consists of a bait chamber(31) with entry ports (22), in which the peromone bait (32) is hung, a funnel (33), a collecting jar (34) filled with a killer-perservative fluid (35) and a wire hanger (36). The drawbacks of this trap are that it can be used only as a pheromone trap and that it employs a perservative fluid to kill the attracted insects. This trap also lacks a non-return flap valve that prevents the return flight of the trapped insects from the collecting jar.<br>
The common household rat trap shown in Fig. G consists of a wooden box chamber (37) which is open in front, a trap door (38) with an associated spring(39), a bait holder(40) hooked to the trap door(38). The drawbacks of this trap are that it can be used exclusively as a rat trap and that the chamber (37) of the trap is accessible from only one side, i.e. the front opening.<br>
The Newton's bee hive shown in Fig, H is the most popular one in South India (David &amp; Kumaraswami, 1988). The wooden hive consists of a floor board(41) with an entrance (42) on the extension in front, a brood chamber (43) with separate brood frames inside, a super chamber(44) with separate super frames inside, a roof (45) with ventilative openings (46) guarded by wire guaze. Being wooden the cost of its construction is higher. The brood and super chambers are accessible only from the top and bottom and not from the sides.<br><br>

A careful examination of the available diversity of traps as explained above reveals that at least a chamber of one type or the other with peripheral units is required for the construction of any device and that they lack a common construction plan. Thus most devices are complex and exclusive in construction, costly and exclusive in application as well. Therefore there is a need to conceive a simple but uniquely manoeuvrable construction configuration that will make the resultant device obviously inclusive many applications and utility.<br><br>
Accordingly the  main objective     of the present  invention  is to  provide a<br>
multipurpose device for the management of insects, including rodents.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a multipurpose device for<br>
the management of insects by monitoring and capturing and by other modes of<br>
controlling the insects .<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a multipurpose device<br>
for controlling the insects by capturing them by attracting them and collecting them<br>
and subsequently killing them .<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a multipurpose device<br>
which is useful as zoological monitoring traps (e.g. light trap, sticky trap, fly trap,<br>
moth trap, pheromone trap, pitfall trap for insects; rodent trap), keeping means such<br>
as hive.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a multipurpose device for<br>
the management of insects which is easy to fabricate and operate, cheap and very<br>
handy and safe for use domestically as well as in the fields .<br>
With the above objectives in view, we have invented a multipurpose device based<br>
on our finding that an innovatively simple but uniquely manoeuvrable constructive<br>
plan scheme to fabricate a central unit (masterframe) enclosing a master chamber<br>
that is omnidirectionally accessible and uniquely manoeuvrable with peripheral<br>
units for diversified objectives,  can make the device  inclusive  (multipurpose) in<br>
its construction and applications unlike other devices that tend to be exclusive both<br>
in construction and applications.<br><br>

illustrated above, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to the above said embodiments . Various obvious modifications within the scope of the invention as illustrated embodiments are possible and are also envisaged within the Scope of the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides A multipurpose kit for the management of insects or rodents which comprises<br>
(a)	a masterframe (1) capable of assembled, in part or in full, employing plurality of removable transparent/translucent/opaque panels (2) on one axis and plurality of centrally windowed brackets (3,4,7&amp;8) on the other axis, the panels being kept in vertical axis in between the disk brackets(3&amp;4) in horizontal axis, one on top and the other at bottom, inserted clock-wise or anti-clockwise in a latero-centripetal orientation , the panels(2) bracing against each other in one axis leaving a proximal panel face(14) and a distal panel extension(15) as well as against the disk brackets(3&amp;4) in the other axis by placing the two dish brackets(7&amp;8) inverted outside the respective disk brackets(3&amp;4) and then by securing with means (9,10,11&amp;12) thereby forming an omnidirectionally accessible masterchamber(13),<br>
(b)	enticing means for insects or rodents such as a light source or food or pheromone as bait, the said means being fixed at the top or bottom or inside or outside the masterchamber (13)<br>
(c)	other accessories such as (i) plurality of collecting chamber or dish (ii) truncated cone or pyramid (iii) collard funnel (iv) reflector with a cover (v) holder for the light source or the   bait ( vi)  trap door with a balancer .<br><br>
The description of the device of the present invention (shown in Figs 1&amp;2) exemplifies a masterframe assembled from rectangular panels of choice (e.g. glass, plastic, grille, mesh, screen), disks/diskettes/dishes/bowls/plates/trays as brackets, cycle spokes as clamps, and fasteners, enclosing a cuboid masterchamber. It is to be understood that the particular masterframe in cuboid plan / configuration/scheme and its peripherals embodying the invention shown in Figs 1 &amp; 2 is given by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The panels and the brackets can be secured by means of clamps and fasteners. The dimension, number and volume of such panels and brackets may vary according to the plan/configuration/scheme of the masterchamber (e.g. cube, cuboid, prismatic, cylindroid, polygon, etc.). All these components offer a wide range of choice to choose from.<br>
Referring to the Figs 1&amp;2, it will be seen that the exemplified<br>
masterframe(l)      includes:	four     rectangular   panels (2);        two      disk<br>
brackets(3 &amp;4) that have central window (5) and peripheral guideways (6) in the plan configuration, namely, top disk bracket (3) and bottom disk bracket(4); two dish brackets ( 7&amp;8) with central window(5), namely, top dish bracket(7) and bottom dish bracket (8); number of clamps(9) with clamp fasteners(lO) and S-hooks as panel fasteners(ll). The masterframe(l) as illustrated in Figs J &amp; 2 can be assembled by keeping the four panels (2) in vertical axis in between the disk brackets(3&amp;4) in horizontal axis, one on top and the other at bottom, inserted clock-wise or anti-clockwise through the<br><br>
peripheral guideways(6). The panels(2) can then be braced up against the disk brackets(3&amp;4) by placing the two dish brackets (7&amp;8) inverted outside the respective disk brackets( 3&amp;4) and then by securing them with clamps(9) [e.g. 4 in an outer circle, 8 optional in an inner circle (4 each inside and outside of masterchamber(13) ] passed through optional slots (12) on both disk brackets(3&amp;4) and dish brackets ( 7&amp;8), and with clamp fasterners(lO). To prevent the panels(2) from slipping to the sides, each panel(2) can be independently fastened with the respective side outer clamp (9) with S-hook panel fasteners(ll). Alternatively, a string(l:ll) can be secured all around the panesl(2). The compact masterframe( 1) thus constructed encloses an inner chamber, i.e. masterchamber(13) (cuboid in the illustrated plan/configuration/scheme) formed by the four inner panel faces(14) on sides as well as by the centrally windowed brackets( 3,4,7&amp;8) on top and at bottom with independent access from all the six sides, if fully assembled. The four-corner extensions(15) [outside of masterchamber(13)] of the panels(2) [excluding the panel face(14)] can act as panel baffles (15), serving not only as baffles when required but also as handling space during insertion and removal of the panels(2).<br>
This embodiment of the masterframe(l) facilitates easy insertion and<br>
removal of the panels (2) from the sides through the peripheral<br>
guideways(6) on brackets(3&amp;4) and/or in between the guiding clamps(9), in<br>
case peripheral guideways (6) are lacking, in the desired plan/configuration.<br>
The indispensable four outer circle clamps (9) serve as pillars (16). The<br>
simple   features    of the   masterframe (1) and     the     innovative	principle.<br><br>
of mounting the panels(2) with a latero-centripetal orientation offer not only several optional modifications in the plan/configuration of masterchamber(13) but also adjustments while assembling without departing from the very scope of invention. For instance the dish brackets( 7&amp;8) and the eight inner circle guiding clamps(9) can be dispensed with, if the disk brackets(3&amp;4) have peripheral guideways(6) . This unit with disk brackets(3&amp;4) and clamp pillars(16) can also be constructed as a mould. In the absence of peripheral guideways(6), the disk brackets(3&amp;4) or the dish brackets(7&amp; 8) can be used independently or jointly with extra inner circle guiding clamps(9). The invention is illustrated by fabricating a light trap with reference to Fig 3<br>
In this embodiment of the present invention ( Fig 3 ) the masterframe (1) fabricated as explained above embodies a versatile light trap in which any source of light(17 ), i.e. bulb or tube light (ordinary or black light), can be used. Even inferior quality glass panels(2) when assembled often never develop cracks due to the heat from the light(17) as they can expand independently when hot. When plastic panels(2) are used, small holes punched on the panels surrounding the light (17) let the heat escape, preventing the panels from melting. In simple one-source one-way light trap, wherein insects can be collected only outside of masterchamber (13), an electric light (17) of choice can be fitted to a holder (18) screwed to another circular windowless dish, i.e.    the       light holder dish(19)     which     can   be    mounted either on top<br><br>
or at bottom and secured to the dish bracket(7 or8) with fastener clips(20). The power cable(21) leads out through a hole on light holder dish(19). The four-comer panel baffles(15) effectively serve as vertical baffles against swift flying insects, while the 4-side panel faces(14) intercept the attracted insects as well This trap (Fig. 3) with the light(17) at the top inside the masterchamber(13) can simply be placed inside a water-filled collecting container (22) that can be a shallow pan or a bucket.<br>
Alternatively, the trap (Fig 4) can be hung from a stand by a multi-clamp trap-hanger (23) secured by one end with a metal washer(24) and by other end with the top brackets( 3&amp;7). Now the collecting container(22) has to be hung around the base of the masterframe (1) by separate multiclamp container-hanger(25), each clamp carrying a clip fastener(20) at the distal end, suspended from the outer rim of top brackets( 3 &amp;7). Mounting the collecting container(22) on the bridge of clip fasteners (20) or such other means can facilitate easy removal. A horizontal row of drainage holes(26) punched 2-3 inches above the floor of collecting container(22) can allow the rainfall to overflow.<br>
In case the light source (17) is kept at bottom, as shown in Fig 4 the central window (5) of the top brackets(3&amp;7) can be closed with another windowless cover dish(27) and fastener clips(20). Tube light in the tall-form masterframe (1) can also be fitted inside the master frame chamber(13) with the two-side tube-light holders(18) fixed on the holder dishes(19), one each on either end, along with required electric/electronic appliances (e.g. choke, starter, switch) mounted extra (Fig.5).<br><br>
In one-source two-way light trap (Fig, 6) wherein insects can be trapped both exterior and interior of masterchamber(13), the light source(17) can be kept at bottom inside the masterchamber(13) and covered with a trasparent heat-resistant light cover(28) (e.g beaker ). Trasparent panels(2) with openings called entry ports(29) are now required to facilitate insect entry into the masterchamber(13). The size and number of entry ports(29) is optional depending on the nature of insects involved. On the one hand, attracted insects are intercepted both by the panel faces(14) and baffles(15) and collected in the collecting container(22) as explained in Figs 3-5. On the other hand, insects tend to move inside the masterchamber(13) through the entry ports(29). A considerable number of such insects can die inside the masterchamber(13) because of the heat from the light(17). Such dead and moribund insects get collected at bottom on the light holder-dish(19). Therefore, suitable openings made on this dish(19) around the two-side tube- light holder(18) let these insects pass under to be collected in the collecting container(22) below. On the other hand, they can also be collected on another removable windowless collecting dish(35) below secured with fastener clips(20) to another inverted windowed additional dish(36) interscrewed with the light holder-dish(19) as illustrated (Fig.6).<br>
In two-source light traps, in addition to the original source of light(17), a reflector (e.g. mirror) can be used to create a false image of the light (17) so that insects can be attracted towards both.<br><br>
In the two-source two/three-way light trap (Fig 7), the   arrangements are the<br>
same as in one-source two-way light trap (Fig 6), excluding the top coper dish(27).<br>
In addition a trasparent collecting dome(31) (box/beaker) inverted flush over   a<br>
trasparent truncated cone or funnel(30) both   mounted on the top dish bracket(7)<br>
and tucked up by the multi-clamp trap-hanger(23) serve as a non-return collecting-<br>
chamber(32). A  reflector(33)  housed   inside an opaque reflector cover(34)  and<br>
laid on the inverted collecting dome(31), reflects the light from the bottom light<br>
source (17), creating a false image that of a light(17) atop the non-return collecting<br>
chamber(32)   to   which   insects   show   equal   attraction   from   inside   the<br>
masterchamber(13). More often nematoceran Diptera can be collected in large<br>
number in the non-return collectingchamber(32). The catch can be even larger with<br>
special wave length light(17).<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention a two-source one-way light trap is provided (Fig 8) in which the light source(17) is encased in a heat-resistant light cover (28) and tucked by multi-clamp trap-hanger (23) and is mounted on top of the top disk bracket (3), the window (5) of which is closed with a heat-resistant transparent cover (27) so that the masterchamber (13) can be Hghted from above. The four panels (2) of the masterframe are made opaque so that light does not escape through the panels (2) but can only pass through the central window (5) of the bottom brackets (4&amp;8) only to be reflected to the sides at 360"* by means of areflector(33). When the reflector (33), preferably convex, housed inside a reflector cover (34) having entry ports(29) on its sides is   fixed from   below to  the  bottom disk bracket (8), it reflects<br><br>
in all directions Ught rays from inside the masterchamber(13) above. Attracted<br>
insects first enter the reflector cover(34) through the entry ports(29) and then the<br>
masterchamber(13) through an inverted   trasparent truncated-cone or funne 1(30)<br>
mounted   on   the   inner   edge   of  the   bottom   disk   bracket(4)   inside   the<br>
masterchamber(13). Thus the masterchamber(13) itself can act as the non-return<br>
CO llecting-chamber(3 2),<br>
The above trap as illustrated in Fig.8   can also be used upside down when it<br>
becomes a lighted pitfall trap (Fig. 9). It can either be buried in soil or grains to<br>
collect arthropods or be hung by means of one more set of multiclamp trap-<br>
hanger(23) to collect flying insects.<br>
When   tube   lights   (ordinary   or   UV)   are   used,   the   reflector(33)   on top may not work in vertical axis because the tube light holder dish(19) on top would obstruct the light from the tube light(17). Alternatively, the reflector(33) can be effectively employed when the masterframe(l) with tube light(17) is laid in horizontal axis as illustrated in Fig 10. The non-return collectingchamber(32) can now be assembled from   a   superimposed flush   pyramid-like truncated cone or funnel(30) open on top and a collecting   dome(31). Inverted, both the truncated-cone/funnel(30) and collecting dome(30) can be placed on the upper panel(2) o the   horizontal       masterframe( 1)   as   illustrated   (Fig, 10).    A   reflector(3 3 embedded    inside    an opaque reflector cover(34) can be    mounted on th inverted collecting dome(3l)    of the non-return collectingchamber(32) wher the insects are falsely lured once they enter  the masterchamber(13)  through<br><br>
series of entry ports(29) on the side panels(2) as well as on the lower panel(2). Entry ports(29) on the upper panel(2) allow the migration of insects from the masterchamber(13) to the upper non-return collectingchamber(32).<br>
Lamp<br>
The masterframe(l) plus the light(17) source can also serve as a lamp (Fig. 5). With proper electric/electronic appliances it can also be modified as an emergency lamp.<br>
Sticky Trap<br>
The device has the scope of a transparent sticky trap with insect-attracting source of<br>
light(17) inside the masterframe(l) (Fig.5) as well as of an opaque colour trap with or without a light source (17) inside (e.g. yellow sticky trap for whiteflies). In the transparent version, the outer surface of the panels(2) can be coated with the adhesive. Thin transparent sticky sheets can also be fixed against or inserted through two of the clamps(9) on the outer surface of each panel(2). In the opaque model panels(2)of optional colours can be used in place of transparent panels(2). Alternatively, coloured sheets can be fixed against the inner surface of transparent panels(2) and the adhesive may be applied in any one of the ways as before.<br>
Fly / Moth Trap<br>
This trap as illustrated in Fig. 11 is intended for collecting actively flying insects that are attracted to specific baits(37) (such as a fish-meal or protein hydrolysate for a variety of dipteran flies, methyl eugenol for fruit flies, fermenting products for<br><br>
both Lepidoptera and Diptera, or a pheromone septum for a variety of insects). Whatever the baitCSV), it can be taken on a windowless bait dislVbowl/box (38) having entry ports (29) all around its sides. This bait holder dish/bowl/box(38) can be attached to the bottom dish bracket(8)of the masterframe(l) with fastener(20). The space the bait holder dish/bowl(38) encloses in between it and the bottom dish bracket(8) can make a bait-chamber(39). An inverted transparent truncated cone/funnel(30) mounted on the top dish bracket(7) and an inverted transparent collecting dome(31) (box/beaker) resting on the transparent truncated-cone or funnel(30) can collect the insects inside the non-return collecting-chamber(32), A multi-clamp trap-hanger(23) secured with a washer(25) serve not only to hang the trap but also to hold the truncated-cone or funnel(30) and the collecting dome(31) intact. The rather air-tight construction of the masterchamber(13) contiguous with the non-return collectingchamber(32) makes the odour from the bait(37) in baitchamber(39) disperse freely on all directions through the entry ports(29) attracting insects more efficiently. Once inside the bait-chamber(39) at bottom, the insects start showing negative geotropism and move upwards into the masterchamber(13) and then into the non-return collectingchamber(32) above where ' death occurs due to asphyxiation either slowly, if the number of insects collected is small, or much more quickly if the collected insects are much crowded. Usually the trapped insects can never escape as they tend to move only to the sides of the non-return collectingchamber(32). The dead<br><br>
insects that accumulate inside the non-return collectingchamber(32) can be removed by gently lifting up the collecting dome(31) tucked by multiclamp trap-hanger(23).<br>
The odour dispersal from the bait(37) can be increased several folds by fixing at bottom a couple of centrally windowed(5) additional dishes(36) as illustrated in Fig. 12, The additional dishes(36) are so fastened together by their bases that one is upright and the other is inverted when assembled. Entry ports(29) are also made on the sides of the additional dishes(36) The removable bait holder dish(38) with entry ports(29) can be secured with fasteners(20) to the inverted additional dish(36).<br>
This trap can also be used to collect the insects alive, if necessary, by securing a<br>
perforated transparent bag on to the truncated end of the cone(30) or to the stem of<br>
funnel(30). Assorted mesh/screen can be employed not only at bottom or top or at<br>
both places of masterchamber(13), either from inside or from outside, but also at<br>
the aperture of the truncated- cone or funnel(30) to screen off non-target insects<br>
that try to enter one chamber from the other, based on their size, i.e. largest insects<br>
from	baitchamber(39)     to     masterchamber(13),     larger     insects     from<br>
masterchamber(13) to truncated-cone or funnel(30) above the top brackets(3,7), and large insects from there to non-return collectingchamber(32) by keeping the largest mesh/screen to close the central window(5) of    bottom brackets(4,8), by<br><br>
keeping the larger mesh/screen to close the aperture of truncated-cone/funnel(30) stem.<br>
The masterchamber(13) itself can serve as the non-return collectingchamber(32) when the central window(5) of the top bracket(3&amp;7) is closed with a windowless cover dish(27) and the inverted transparent truncated-cone or funnel(30) is mounted inside the masterchamber(13) on the inner edges of the bottom disk bracket (4)<br>
(Fig. 13).<br>
Simplified Versions of Fly/Moth Trap<br>
The flies and moths can also be effectively trapped with zero volume master<br>
chamber(13) by using the device of the present invention . For such an use the<br>
baitchamber(39)        becomes	contiguous        with        the        non-return<br>
collectingchamber(32) without employing the panels(2) as illustrated in Fig. 14 (I) (II)&amp; (III).<br>
Covered Funnel Bait Trap<br>
The masterfame(l) can also be modified into a 'covered funnel pheromone trap' in its vertical axis (as shown in Fig. 15). A collared funnel(40) is so mounted flush on the top dish bracket(7) that the funnel(40) stem aperture opens into the masterchamber( 13). An inverted windowless dish(41) mounted across the multiclamp of the trap-hanger(23) through slots can serve as the hood-dish(41). The   clamps of the trap-hanger(23) can be secured by their distal ends   with a<br><br>
washer(24) large enough to insert the trap-hanger clamps(23) as well as another central bait carrier clamp(42) passed through the washer(24) as well as through the centre of the hood-dish(41) holding the bait(37) (pheromone septum) below the hood dish(41) at its proximal end. The central bait carrier clamp(42) is movable up and down so that the bait(37) can be set at the right height just over the rim of the collared funnel(40). A stopper(43) secured to the central bait carrier clamp(42) can prevent the latter(42) from slipping low into the collared funnel(40) once set as it seats on the hood-dish(41). This trap facilitates unrestricted dispersal of the pheromone plume with omnidirectional access for the target insects from upwind. A thin-film (X-ray) L-shaped flap-valve(44) can be fixed to the exterior sloping side of the collared funnel(40) by its vertical arm so that its horizontal arm (44) dangles below the funnel stem opening at an angle, preventing the upward return flight of the insects that have fallen into the masterchamber(13) closed at bottom with a removable collecting dish(35) secured with fastener clips(20). Stout insects like Helicoverpa and Spodoptera can be collected by this trap means.<br>
Wind-oriented Pipe Trap<br>
Alternatively, when suspended on the horizontal axis by a multi-clamp trap-hanger(23), the device of the present invention can become a wind-oriented trap as air flows through the masterchamber(13) like a pipe as shown in Fig.l6A &amp; B. The inner panel face(14) of all the four panels(2)can be made sticky with adhesive (like castor oil). The bait(37) like pheromone lure suspended from or stuck to the panel(2) inside the masterchamber(13) attracts the insects from upwind, which get stuck to the adhesive panel face(14). Tiny insects like pink bollworm moths can be trapped by this trap.<br><br>
The wind-orientation can be promoted by fixing a fin(45) vertically against the vertical skyward panel(2) outside the masterchamber(13) as illustrated in Fig 16 . When the fin(45) is used this way, the trap has to be balanced on the horizontal axis with two variable lengths of hanger clamps (23). Alternatively, the fin(45) can also be kept vertically on top of the horizontal panel(2) when the trap needs no balancing.<br>
Box-Type Rodent Trap<br>
On a horizontal axis, the masterframe (1) can be modified into a box-type rodent trap as shown in Fig. 17 A and Fig 17 B. A trap-door(50), which bears a trap-door balancer(51), i.e. balancing screw in the centre, and a trap-door fastener(52) like a nipple) hinged terminally to a little off to the mid-point, can be hinged to the bracket(4) edge floor of the masterchamber(13) by means of a pair of trap¬door hinge(53). The four corners of the trap-door(50) have to be truncated in order to facilitate the free swing of the trap door(50) inside the masterchamber(13) when the four inner circle clamps(9) inside the masterchamber(13) are used. However, these four clamps(9) can be dispensed with and the four corners of the trap-door(50) need not be truncated when the disk brackets(3&amp;4) have peripheral guideways(6) to hold the panels(2) in position. A lateral bait-carrier clamp(42) having a stopper(43) at its distal end can be inserted through a slot a little off to the centre of a top cover dish (27). The attractant bait (37)   is   positioned   midway   through   the   length   of the   lateral   bait   carrier<br><br>
clamp (42), Another metal stopper (43) can be positioned next to the bait on the lateral bait carrier clamp(42) to prevent the bait(37) from moving towards the proximal end of the lateral bait carrier clamp(40) which may cause the rodent to enter the masterchamber(13) only half-way. Alternatively, the bait(37) can be attached to the lateral bait carrier clamp(42) by any other means like a hook or fastener clip(20), or the bait(37) can be placed in the gap(72) between the inner panel face (14) of the upper panel (2) and the trap-door (50). The trap-door fastener(52) is now secured to the lateral bait carrier clamp(42). The cover-dish(27) is then so attached to the top dish bracket(7) with fastener clips(20) that the bait carrier clamp(42) swings rather closer to one of the inner panel faces(14) of the masterchamber(13). Otherwise the downswing of the bait carrier clamp(40) when the trap-door(50) closes may be obstructed by the dorsum of the attracted animal inside the masterchamber(13). Two low-tension elastic bands/springs(54) can now be secured by one of their ends to the distal end of the bait carrier clamp(42), Their other ends can be stretched over two of the fastener clips(20) so that the elastic bands/springs(54) along with the top brackets(3&amp;7) and cover dish(27) assume a bow-like position with the trap-door(50) and the bait carrier clamp(42) acting as a two-piece foldable arrow. The tension from the elastic bands/springs conducted via the bait carrier clamp(42) makes the trap-door(50) swing up or down from the trap-door hinge(53) (cotter pins). The trap-door balancer(51) screw is now worked to balance the trap-door(50) inside the horizontal masterchamberr321 the tip of trap-door balancer(51) screw resting<br><br>
on the inner panel face(14) of the upper panel(2). At this position slightest upward test-push externally by the distal end of the lateral bait carrier clamp(42) can cause the trap-door(50) to lose balance, swinging down to shut<br>
the central window(5) of the bottom brackets(4&amp;8) acting as the entrance to the masterchamber(13) from inside. When the animal enters the masterchamber(13), it attempts to bite and pull the bait (37) off the bait carrier clamp(42) or from the gap(72) between the trap-door (50) and the upper panel (2), causing the trap-door(50) to shut. As the trapped animal can violently try to open the trap-door(50) by pulling the trap-door fastener(52) and the bait carrier clamp(42), the tension from the elastic band/ spring (54) outside the masterchamber(13) still continues to push the trap-door(50) inside against the edges of bottom disk bracket(7). The animal can not cause any damage even to a plastic trap-door(50) since there will be no sufficient space between the edges of trap-door(50) and panels(2) for its teeth to chew the closed trap-door(50). The trapped animal can be killed by immersing the entire trap into water. Alternatively, smaller rodents can be killed by pushing open the trap door(50) with fingers from outside through the entrance window(5) so slowly that the rat tries to escape by crawling in between the bottom floor panel(2) and the trap-door(50). Leaving the fingers when the rat has just exerted its head causes the trap-door(50) to shut crushing the rat to death.<br>
Bee Hive<br>
Construction of the masterframe(l) in cuboid plan/configuration offers scope for assembling  the  chambers  (brood  chamber,  super  chamber)  of the  bee<br><br>
nive       tor	keeping       honey       bees       (Figs.        20       &amp;       21).<br>
Rectangular      tray brackets ( 7 &amp; 8) (Fig 20) with central windows(5) with<br>
or without peripheral  guideways(6)  can  be  used  in place  of circular  dish<br>
brackets( 7&amp;8). The      chambers    can be had either by keeping two separate<br>
masterframes(l)  one over the other. On the other hand, the lower brood chamber<br>
can be had from one masterframe(l) while the super chamber can be assembled<br>
simply with additional trays as described below.<br>
The brood chamber of the hive can be easily assembled in the cuboid<br>
plan/configuration of the masterframe(l) with two rectangular tray brackets(7&amp;8)<br>
one inverted with central window(5) at the  bottom(8) and the other upright with<br>
window on the top(7). The clamps(9) passed through the slots (12) on the   tray<br>
brackets(7 &amp; 8) can hold both the inner transparent panel(2) and the outer opaque<br>
panel(2) in position. The transparent panels(2) are optional A string can also be<br>
tied around the panels(2) or S-hooks can be used as panel fasteners(ll).   Six to<br>
seven brood frames(55) can be hung inside the masterchamber(13), i.e. brood<br>
chamber,  from the breadthwise     window periphery  of the  top  upright  tray<br>
bracket(7). The central window(5) of bottom inverted tray bracket(8) can be closed<br>
with an inverted windowless cover tray(27) which acts as the floor  board of the<br>
hive as well<br>
Another    centrally   windowed      additional tray(36) can be laid inverted on the<br>
upright top tray bracket(7) of the brood chamber(13)  with the space enclosed by<br>
the additional tray(36) and the top tray bracket(7) serving as the super chamber(56),<br>
in which plurality of super frames(57) can be hung from the super frame rest(58)<br>
i.e. four to eight   long clamps fixed horizontally across the inverted additional<br>
tray(36) either high from the rim or low from the bottom. Two long clamps fixed<br>
horizontally across lengthwise near the sides, i.e. super frame checks(59), restraint<br><br>
the movement of super frames(56) to the sides. The windowed additional tray(36) of the super chamber(56) can be secured on to the top tray bracket of the brood chamber(13) with fastener clips(20). Alternatively, the peg-like clamp fasteners(lO) of the pillar clamps(16) can be made to keep the inverted additional tray(36) in position by making four slots on its rim to allow the clamp fasteners(16) to pass through. A pair of cover trays(27) with many ventiliative perforations, small enough not to allow the bees, on bottom of the first and on sides of the second, inverted one over the other on the inverted additional tray(3 6) of the super chamber(56) can provide the roofing. The bees can enter the hive through the hive entrance(60), a narrow slit in front on the sloping slide of the bottom tray bracket(8) in level with the base of the bottom windowless cover tray(27). Several holes punched on the base of the bottom windoless cover tray(27) can improve ventilation by permitting the atmospheric air to enter the masterchamber(13) (brood chamber) from below and to escape above through perforations on the roofing cover trays(27) as well as through the gaps in between the cover trays(27) and the additional tray(36), creating an air circulation, especially when it is hotter.<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
The advantages of this invention are many. The novel construction featuring a central masterframe with peripherals makes the device unique of its kind in terms of inventive manoeuvrability. It is simple and handy, cheap and efficient. Being inclusive in constructive plan, it offers a variety of applications. The device can be<br><br>
used to manage a wide range of insects, including rodents, not only in fields but also in households and other establishments. It can be used as an extremely versatile light trap. As a two-source light trap with an innovative reflector, which creates a false image of the original light source, the device uniquely lures the insects into the non-return collecting chamber. This novel feature can help reduce the cost of conventional fly traps that use high voltage electricity to kill the attracted flies. With suitable light source (e.g. uv black light) nematoceran insects (e.g. mosquitoes) can also be effectively collected. As a fly/moth trap the device is so effective that these insects (flies, moths both tiny and stout) are not only trapped but are killed without any killing agent. The L-shaped film valve in the covered funnel bait trap prevents the return of trapped insects through the funnel aperture. As a rat trap the device is easy to set. Just two low-tension rubber bands are enough to cause the trap-door to swing up and down. The balancer on the trap-door regulating the gap in between the upper panel face and the trap-door is a novel feature which is easy to operate. The construction of bee hive offers a cost-effective alternative to the conventional types. The device can be useful to researchers in many areas. The device offers scope to construct it as a case (e.g. lamps) as well.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
