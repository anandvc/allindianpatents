				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention is related to a novel and improved method for purification of glycopeptides, especially glycopeptide antibiotics. The method comprises contacting a solution of the glycopeptide to an ion exchange chromatography material. The product of this method has a surprisingly high purity.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Glycopeptide antibiotics can be classified in four groups based on their chemical structure (according to Yao, R.C. and Crandall, L.W., Glycopeptides, Classification, Occurrence, and Discovery in Glycopeptide antibiotics, ed. Nagarajan, R., Marcel Dekker, Inc., N.Y, N.Y., Chapter 1, pp. 1-27 (1994)):<br>
-	Group I (or the vancomycin type) has aliphatic amino acids at positions 1 and 3;<br>
-	Group II (or the avoparcin type) has aromatic amino acid residues at positions 1 and 3;<br>
-	Group III (or the ristocetin type) is similar to group II but for an ether linkage joining the aromatic amino acids at positions 1 and 3; and<br>
-	Group IV (or the Teicoplanin type) has the same amino acid arrangement as group III plus a fatty acid residue attached to the amino sugar.<br>
Examples on glycopeptide antibiotics are listed in US 4,845,194 A, and in EP 836 619 B1, wherein the term dalbaheptide is used for glycopeptide antibiotics. The glycopeptides can be manufactured as disclosed in the art, such as by fermentation.<br>
Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic produced by Actinoplanes teichomyceticus and was discovered during a scientific research program aiming to find new molecules of microbial origin that inhibited bacterial cell wall synthesis. (Goldstein, B. et al, Teicoplanin in Glycopeptide Antibiotics, ed. Nagarajan, R., Marcel Dekker, Inc., N.Y, N.Y., Chapter 8, pp. 273-307 (1994)). It was first described in 1978 and ten years later it was Introduced into clinical practice in Italy. (Parenti, F. et al, J. Chemotherapy, Vol. 12, pp. 5-14, (2000)).<br>
Numerous methods for purifying glycopeptide antibiotics have been disclosed. According to the method disclosed in EP 479 086 B1, in order to increase extraction efficiency of teicoplanin A2, the fermentation broth is adjusted to a pH between 10 and 11.5, prior to filtration. The filtrate of the fermentation broth is loaded on a potyamide resin and teicoplanin is precipitated from the eluate with an excessive amount of acetone and left to stand for 3 hours. The supernatant is decanted and the rest is filtered. The resulting cake is washed with acetone to recover teicoplanin A2. This method has the problem of solvent accumulation, since it uses an excessive amount of acetone in diverse steps.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,845,194 discloses a method for recovering vancomycin-type glycopeptide<br>
antibiotics (e.g. teicoplanin and vancomyctn), in which a cation exchange resin having a crosslinkage<br>
of 2% or less is added to the fermentation broth to adsorb teicoplanin to the resin and a<br>
100 mesh sieve is used to separate the mycelia from the resin. Then, the resin is washed with<br>
purified water, followed by elution to recover teicoplanin.<br>
Korean Patent Publication No. 2000-0066479 discloses a method for producing teicoplanin A2, in<br>
which a fermentation broth is adjusted to pH 11 and centrifuged, and the supernatant is adsorbed<br>
onto a synthetic adsorbent resin such as XAD-16, HP-20 and activated carbon or silica gel, eluted<br>
with a 50 to 80% methanol solution and recovered under reduced pressure to obtain teicoplanin as<br>
crude powder. The crude teicoplanin is dissolved in a solution of sodium acetate and purified by<br>
sugar affinity chromatography.<br>
US patent application 20040024177 A1 discloses method for purifying teicoplanin A2 comprising:<br>
(i) a primary pre-purification step of purifying a filtrate of fermentation broth of a strain using a<br>
synthetic adsorbent; (ii) a secondary pre-purification step of purifying the primary pre-purification<br>
solution using a cation exchange resin having a high cross-linkage, a catalytic resin or a chelate<br>
resin; (iii) a final purification step of purifying the secondary pre-purification solution using a<br>
reversed phase resin; and (iv) a powder-forming step.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
There still remains a need for a method that can be used to mass produce glycopeptide antibiotics<br>
with high purity. According to the present invention, it is possible to obtain glycopeptide antibiotics<br>
with high purity through a novel method for ion exchange chromatography.<br>
The present inventors have surprisingly found out that it is possible to obtain a glycopeptide,<br>
especially a glycopeptide antibiotic, in high purity by using a method comprising ion exchange<br>
chromatography of the g/yeopeptide containing solution with increased salt concentration and/or<br>
increased conductivity of the solution. Not wishing to be bound by theory, it is contemplated that<br>
this method can be used for purification of all glycopeptides that share a common structure, i.e. the<br>
dalbaheptide structure.<br>
In accordance with this finding, there is provided a method for purification of a glycopeptide,<br>
especially a glycopeptide of dalbaheptide type using ion exchange chromatography, which method<br>
comprises raising the salt concentration in a solution of the glycopeptide (and thereby raising the<br>
conductivity of the solution) to a level higher that hitherto disclosed, while the glucopeptide Is<br>
allowed to bind to an ion exchange resin.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for purification of a glycopeptide antibiotic or a derivative<br>
thereof (or a solution comprising the glycopeptide antibiotic or the derivative thereof), which<br>
comprises:<br>
a) adjusting the salt concentration in a solution of the glycopeptide to at least 0.2 M, and/or<br>
adjusting the conductivity of the solution of the glycopeptide to at least 20mS/cm;<br>
b) contacting the solution of the glycopeptide with an ion exchange material;<br>
c) optionally washing the ion exchange material; and<br>
d) removing the glycopeptide from the ion exchange material, using an eluent.<br>
Preferably, the glycopeptide antibiotic is an oligopeptide (e.g. heptapeptide) antibiotic,<br>
characterized by a multi-ring peptide core optionally substituted with saccharide groups, such as an<br>
antibiotic selected from the group consisting of: a dalbaheptide, a glycopeptide of group I<br>
(vancomycin type); a glycopeptide of group II (avoparcin type); a glycopeptide of group III<br>
(ristocetin type); a glycopeptide of group IV (teicoplanin type); derivatives of any of these; individual<br>
factors of any of these; and combinations thereof. Examples of glycopeptides included in this<br>
definition may be found in "Glycopeptides Classification, Occurrence, and Discover/', by Raymond<br>
C. Rao and Louise W. Crandall, ("Drugs and the Pharmaceutical Sciences"Volume 63, edited by<br>
Ramakrishnan Nagarajan, published by Marcal Dekker, Inc.). Additional examples of glycopeptides<br>
are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,639,433; 4,643,987; 4,497,802; 4,698,327; 5,591,714; 5,840,684;<br>
and 5,843,889; in EP 0 802 199; EP 0 801 075; EP 0 667 353; WO 97/28812; WO 97/38702; WO<br>
98/52589; WO 98/52592; and in J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 1996,118,13107-13108; J. Amer. Chem.<br>
Soc., 1997,119,12041-12047; and J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 1994, 116, 4573-4590. Representative<br>
glycopeptides include those Identified as A477, A35512, A40926, A41030, A42867, A47934,<br>

presently most interesting glycopeptide antibiotic to be purified is the teicoplanin complex (including<br>
the A2 factor), which results from a fermentation broth.<br>
More preferably the glycopeptide is selected from the group consisting of: A40926, A84575,<br>
Ardacin, kibdelin, MM55266, Parvodicin, vancomycin, the Teicoplanin complex and its factors, and<br>
derivatives of these.<br>
The term "derivatives" comprises glycopeptides that still comprise the cyclic peptide skeleton (e.g. the dalbaheptide skeleton), but differ from the above mentioned glycopeptides in that a substituent directly or indirectly bound to the skeleton has been removed or replaced by an other substituent. Examples on derivatives are: fully or partly deglycosylated glycopeptides, such as aglycones, and derivatives which are disclosed in the art, such as in WO 0198328 A, WO 0183521 A, WO 03018607 A, WO 03018608 A, WO 03029270 A, EP 201 251 A, US 20040087494 A1, US 5,164,484 A, US 5,916,873 A, and in references cited in any of these patent documents.<br>
It Is contemplated that both anion and cation exchange materials might be used, but it is presently preferred that the ion exchange material is an anion exchange resin, preferably an anion exchange resin in which the backbone has a polymeric hydrophilic nature, such as Macroprep High Q Support (BioRad).<br>
The conductivity of the solution of the glycopeptide is above preferably above 15mS/cm, more preferred above 20 mS/cm, above 25 mS/cm, or above 30 mS/cm. The conductivity can be above 40 mS/cm.<br>
It is preferred that the salt concentration during the ion exchange is higher than about 0.25 M, such as higher than 0.30 M or even higher than 0.35 M or 0.45 M, and it is preferred that the salt concentration during the ion exchange is lower than about 2.0 M, such as lower than 1.5 M, lower than 1.0 M or even lower than 0.7 M. It is presently preferred that the salt concentration is in the range of 0.4 to 0.7 M. The NaCl adjustment may be performed by measuring the added salt.<br>
Examples on salts that can be used in connection with the present invention for adjusting the salt concentration and/or the conductivity of the solution are alkali metal salts, e.g. selected from the group consisting of: Sodium, potassium or lithium salts of one of the following anions:   Cl-, HSO3-, BrO3-, Br-, NO3-, CIO3-, HSO4-, HCO3-, IO3-, HPO4-, formate, acetate, and propionate. Presently, NaCl is preferred. A mixture of different salts can be used.<br>
Examples on eluents that can be used (especially in connection with the anion exchange resin)<br>
are:<br>
An acid, such as an acid selected from the group consisting of:<br>
A)	a weak organic acid, preferably acetic acid or citric acid; or<br>
B)	a buffer composed of a weak organic acid and a corresponding base, preferably below pH 4.5; and<br>
a solution of a salt, such as a salt defined above, including mixtures thereof.<br>
It is presently preferred that the eluent is acetic acid, and/or that the concentration of the acid is higher than 0.1 M (such as higher than 0.3 M; 0.5 M; 0.8 M), and it is presently preferred that it is<br>
higher than 1.0 M. However, the concentration of the acid should be lower than 6.0 M, more<br>
preferred lower than 4.0 M. A mixture of different acids can be used. If an aqueous solution of a<br>

following steps:<br>
a) obtaining a crude fermentation broth containing a gtycopeptide antibiotic producing<br>
microorganism;<br>
b) adjusting the pH of the crude fermentation broth to between pH 8 and pH 12; and<br>
c) separating the fermentation broth from the glycopeptide antibiotic producing<br>
microorganism (mycelial mass), e.g. by centrifugation or filtration, thereby obtaining a<br>

Experimental<br>
Ex 1: Obtaining a solution of teicoplanin In water<br>
Ex1a<br>
A fermentation broth containing Teicoplanin is obtained by fermenting a culture of A.<br>
Teichomyceticus in a manner known per se, e.g. as disclosed in US patent 4,239,751.<br>
«<br>
5 L teicoplanin containing whole culture fermentation broth from a laboratory femnentor was<br>
adjusted to pH 9.5 (by addition of 1M NaOH) and brought under stirring. The solution was filtered<br>
through a 100 pm depth filter (Polygard, Millipore) at room temperature, following by ultra-filtration<br>
(500 000 Da, Biomax, Millipore) at 12-14 degrees Celsius. Residual Teicoplanin was recovered by<br>
diafiltration of the biomass in batch mode with 4*0.5 L water. About 80% of the teicoplanin present<br>
in the fermentation broth was recovered in the final clarified solution.<br>
Ex1b<br>
500 ml teicoplanin fermentation broth obtained as in ex 1 a was adjusted to pH 9.5 with 1M NaOH<br>
and a cell free solution was achieved by centrifugation in a laboratory centrifuge at 10 degree<br>
celcius. About 85% of the teicoplanin present in the fermentation broth was recovered In the final<br>
clarified solution.<br>
Ex 2: ion exchange chromatographv purification<br>
Ex 2a: Anton exchange chromatography purification of teicoplanin factor A2 (TA2)<br>
Clarified teicoplanin solution from ex 1a containing 0.5 g product was adjusted to pH 8 by addition<br>
of 1M HCI. NaCI was added to a final concentration of 0.5M, giving a conductivity of ca. 50 mS/cm.<br>
The methacrylate co-polymer anion exchange resin Macro-prep High Q support (Bio Rad) was<br>
packed into a chromatography column (inner diameter (i.d.) 1.6cm, bed height 12 cm, volume 24<br>
ml), and the prepared teicoplanin solution was added to the column at a flow rate of 3.4 ml/min.<br>
The column was washed with 48 ml 0.5M NaCI solution before eluting the product with 192 ml 3M<br>
acetic acid. 0.42 g teicoplanin was recovered in the elution pool, and the HPLC purity of the same<br>
pool did increase from about 70 area% to 90 area% TA2 by the operation, together with removal of<br>
a substantial amount of colored components.<br>
Optionally a wash step comprising high NaCI concentration (i.e. up to 2M) was included in the<br>
chromatography process giving even higher purity and less color of the final product pool, with only<br>
minor loss of teicoplanin.<br>
Ex 2b: Anton exchange chromatography purification of TA2<br>
Clarified teicoplanin solution from ex 1a containing 0.5 g product was adjusted to pH 8 by addition<br>
of 1M HCI. NaCI was added to a final concentration of 0.5M, giving a conductivity of ca. 50 mS/cm.<br>
The agarose based anion exchange resin Q Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) was<br>
packed into a chromatography column (inner diameter (i.d.)1.6 cm, bed height 12 cm, volume 24<br>
ml), and the prepared teicoplanin solution was added to the column at a flow rate of 3.4 ml/min.<br>
The column was washed with 48 ml 0.5M NaCI-solution before eluting the product with 192 ml 3M<br>
acetic acid. 0.35 g teicoplanin was recovered in the elution pool, and the HPLC purity of the same<br>
pool did increase to approximately 85 area% TA2.<br>
Ex 2c: Anion exchange chromatography for purification of TA2<br>
NaHCO3 is added to a concentration of 0.7M in clarified teicoplanin solution from ex 1a containing<br>
0.5 g product, and the pH of the solution is adjusted to pH 8 by addition of 1M HCI. The solution is<br>
thereafter applied to a column as described in example 2b. The column is washed with 48 ml 0.7M<br>
NaHC03-solution and eluted with 192 ml 3M acetic acid. Purified teicoplanin is recovered in the<br>
elution pool.<br>
Ex 2d: Anion exchange chromatography for purification of vancomycin<br>
A crude fermentation broth containing vancomycin can be produced according to the procedure of<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,413, and clarified by centrifugation. NaCI is added to clarified vancomycin<br>
solution, containing 0.5 g product, to a concentration of 0.5M and the pH of the solution is adjusted<br>
to pH 10 (by 1M NaOH). The vancomycin solution is thereafter applied to a column as described in<br>
example 2a. The column is washed with 48 ml 0.5M NaCI-solution followed by elution of target with<br>
192 ml 0.5M acetic acid. Purified vancomycin is recovered in the elution pool.<br>
Ex 2e: Cation exchange chromatography<br>
Clarified teicoplanin solution from ex 1 a containing 0.5 g product is adjusted to pH 2.8 by addition<br>
of 1M HCI. NaCI is added to a final concentration of 0.3M NaCI. The solution is applied to a column<br>
(i.d. 1.6 cm, bed height 12 cm, volume 24 ml) packed with a methacrylate co-polymer cation<br>
exchange resin, i.e. Macro-prep High S support (Bio Rad). The column is washed with 48 ml 0.3M<br>
NaCI-solution followed by elution of target with 192 ml 0.2M sodium acetate at pH 6.0. Purified<br>
teicoplanin is recovered In the elution pool.<br>
Ex3:<br>
Teicoplanin was produced by fermentation and clarified as described in example 1a. Equal<br>
amounts of clarified broth containing 1.0 g teicoplanin were mixed with different amounts of NaCI<br>
(see table 1 below) to give from 0 to 1M NaCI in the solution. After dissolution, the samples were<br>
applied to a column as described in example 2a at a flow rate of 3.4 ml/min. The column was<br>
washed with 48 ml NaCI-solution with the equal molarity as in the applisate following elution of<br>
target with 192 ml 3M acetic acid. The binding capacity for teicoplanin and the HPLC purity were<br>
assayed by a standard HPLC method. The pool was selected such that the area% TA2 was about<br>
The clarified (e.g. filtered or centrifuged) fermentation broth can be purified before applying the ion<br>
exchange step, and/or the solution from the Ion exchange step can be further purified by applying<br>
one or more purification methods, such as method known per se or as described below:<br>
Ex. 4a: Prepurification of Teicoplanin before anion exchange - loading to a hydrophobic backbone<br>
Clarified teicoplanin solution from ex 1 a containing 0.5 g product is adjusted to pH 8 by addition of<br>
1M HCI. and is applied to a column packed with a macroreticular aliphatic crosslinked polymer<br>
(XAD7HP, Rohm &amp; Haas) (inner diameter (i.d.)1.6 cm, height 10 crn, volume 20 mi) at a flow rate<br>
of 0.7 ml/min. After binding, the column is washed with 80 mi of water, before teicoplanin is<br>
recovered by elution with 100 ml of a 50/50 mixture of ethanol and water. The resulting eluate is<br>
committed to evaporation using a rotary evaporator unit, at 40 degree Celsius, 80 mbar. The<br>
resultant ethanol-free solution is treated as described In example 2a.<br>
Ex 4b: Further purification of TA2 in the ion exchange pool by loading to a hydrophobic interaction<br>
A column with diameter 1.6 cm and a bed height of 10 cm (volume 20 mt) is packed with a<br>
hydrophobic interaction resin, i.e. Octyl Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). The elution<br>
pool from example 2a is added ammonium sulfate to a concentration of 0.1M, and loaded to the<br>
column at pH 2.5 and a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. The column is washed with 40 ml 0.1 M ammonium<br>
sulfate solution and eluted by 120 ml water. Purified and less colored teicoplanin solution is<br>
recovered in the operation.<br>
Ex. 4c: Further purification of TA2 in the ton exchange pool by loading to a cation exchange resin<br>
Product from one of the examples 2a-2c containing 0.35-0.45 g teicoplanin in acetic acid solution<br>
at pH 2.5 is applied to a cation exchange resin (Macro-prep High S support (Bio Rad), inner<br>
diameter 1.6 cm, height 10 cm, volume 20 ml) at a flow of 2.5 ml/min. The column is washed with<br>
40 ml 0.1 M acetic acid solution, followed by elution of target with 120 ml 0.2 M sodium acetate at<br>
pH 6.0. Purified teicoplanin Is recovered in the elution pool.<br>
Ex. 4d: Decoiorization of TA2 in the ion exchange pool by carbon filtration<br>
The elution pool collected in example 2a was added 75 ml ethanol to a 50/50 vol% mixture before<br>
filtering through an immobilized active carbon filter (millistak+, 13cm2filterarea, Mitlipore). The filter<br>
was rinsed with 25 ml 50/50 vol% water/ethanol mixture. Teicoplanin was recovered in the almost<br>
color free product solution.<br>
Ex. 4e: Decoiorization of TA2 in the ion exchange pool by size exclusion chromatography<br>
10 ml of the elution pool from example 2a is loaded to a 30ml size exclusion column (Superdex 30<br>
prepgrade, Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Colored components in the sample<br>
that are larger than teicoplanin is eluted in front of tefcoplanin and is thereby removed.<br>
Ex. 4f: Precipitation of TA2 in the ion exchange pool by addition of an organic solvent<br>
Teicoplanin in the elution pool from example 2a is precipitated from the solution by addition of 1370<br>
ml acetone to a final concentration of 95%. The precipitate is harvested by filtration and the<br>
subsequent filter cake is washed twice with 10 ml acetone. The filter cake is thereafter dried in a<br>
vacuum oven at 40 degrees Celsius. Purified teicoptanin is recovered in the dry filter cake.<br>
