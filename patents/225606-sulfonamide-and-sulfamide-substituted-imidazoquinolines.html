Sulfonamide and Sulfamide Substituted Imidazoquinolines<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to imidazoquinoline compounds that have sulfonamide or sulfamide substitution at the 1-position and to pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds. A further aspect of this invention relates to the use of these compounds as immunomodulators, for inducing cytokine biosynthesis in animals and in the treatment of diseases including viral and neoplastic diseases.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The first reliable report on the l#-imidazo[4,5-cJquinoline ring system, Backman et al., J. Org. Chem. 15, 1278-1284 (1950) describes the synthesis of l-(6-methoxy-8-quinolinyl)-2-methyl-ltf-iirudazo[4,5-c]quinoline for possible use as an antimalarial agent. Subsequently, syntheses of various substituted lff-imidazo[4,5-c] quinolines were reported. For example. Jain et al.. J- Med. Chem. 11, pp. 87-92 (1968), synthesized the compound l-[2-(4-piperidyl)emyI]-l/Mmidazo[4,5-c]quinoline as a possible anticonvulsant and cardiovascular agent. Also, Baranov et al., Chem. Abs. 85, 94362 (1976}, have reported several 2-oxoimidazo[4,5-c]quinolines, and Berenyi et al., J. Heterocyclic Chem. 18, 1537-1540 (1981), have reported certain 2-oxoimidazo[4,5-c]quinolines.<br>
Certain l#-iimdazo[4,5-cJquinolin-4-aminesand 1-and 2-substituted derivatives thereof were later found to be useful as antiviral agents, bronchodilators and immunomodulators. These are described in, inter alia, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,689,338; 4,698,348; 4,929,624; 5,037,986; 5,268,376; 5,346,905; and 5,389,640, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
There continues to be interest in the imidazoquinoline ring system, as seen for example in WO 98/30562, EP 894 797 and WO 00/09506. EP 894 797 discloses amide substituted imidazoquinoline compounds that are disclosed to be useful as immune response modifying compounds, while WO 00/09506 discloses imidazoquinoline compounds that contain a sulfonamide substituent wherein the sulfonamide nitrogen is part of a saturated heterocyclic ring. Despite these efforts, however, there is a continuing<br><br>
need for compounds that have the ability to modulate the immune response, by induction of cytokine biosynthesis or other mechanisms.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
We have found a new class of compounds that are useful in inducing cytokine biosynthesis in animals. Accordingly, this invention provides compounds of Formula I:<br><br>
wherein R, Ri and R2 are as defined herein.<br>
The compounds of Formula I are useful as immune response modifiers due to their ability to induce cytokine biosynthesis and otherwise modulate the immune reponse when administered to animals. This makes the compounds useful in the treatment of a variety of conditions such as viral diseases and tumors that are responsive to such changes in the immune response.<br>
The invention further provides pharmaceutic compositions containing a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I and methods of inducing cytokine biosynthesis in an animal, treating a viral infection and/or treating a neoplastic disease in an animal by administering a effective amount of a compound of Formula I to the animal.<br>
In addition, methods of synthesizing compounds of Formula 1 and intermediates useful in the synthesis of these compounds are provided.<br>

Preparation of the Compounds<br>
Imidazoquinolines of the invention can be prepared according to Reaction Scheme I where R, Rj, R; and n are as defined above.<br>
In step (1) of Reaction Scheme I a 4-chlon&gt;3-nitroquinoline of Formula II is reacted with an amine of Fonnula R(NH: where Rj is as defined above to provide a 3-mtroquinolin-4-amine of Fonnula VSL The reaction can be carried out by adding amine to a solution of a compound of Formula II in a suitable solvent such as chloroform or dichloromethane and optionally heating. Many quinolines of Formula II are known compounds (see for example, U.S. Patent 4,689,338 and references cited therein).<br>
In step (2) of Reaction Scheme I a 3-nitroquinolin-4-amine of Formula III is reduced to provide a quinoline-3,4-diamine of Fonnula IV. Preferably, the reduction is carried out using a conventional heterogeneous hydrogenation catalyst such as platinum on carbon or palladium on carbon. The reaction can conveniently be carried out on a Parr apparatus in a suitable solvent such as isopropyl alcohol or toluene.<br>
In step (3) of Reaction Scheme I a quinoline-3,4-diamine of Formula IV is reacted with a carboxylic acid or an equivalent thereof to provide a ltf-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline of Formula V. Suitable equivalents to carboxylic acid include acid halides, orthoesters, and 1,1-dialkoxyalkyl alkanoates. The carboxylic acid or equivalent is selected such that it will provide the desired Ri substituent in a compound of Formula V. For example, tricthyl orthoformate will provide a compound where R; is hydrogen and triethy] orthoaceiate will provide a compound where R2 is methyl. The reaction can be run in the absence of solvent or in an inert solvent such as toluene. The reaction is run with sufficient heating to drive off any alcohol or water formed as a byproduct of the reaction.<br>

Step (5) involves (i) reacting a compound of Formula VI with an acylating agent and then (ii) reacting the product with an aminating agent. Part<br><br>
(i) of step (5) involves reacting an N-oxide of Formula VI with an acylating agent. Suitable acylating agents include alky]- or arylsulfonyl chlorides (e.g., benezenesulfonyl chloride, methanesulfonyl chloride, p-toluenesulfonyl chloride). Arylsulfonyl chlorides are preferred. Para-toluenesulfonyl chloride is most preferred. Part (ii) of step (5) involves reacting the product of part (i) with an excess of an aminating agent. Suitable animating agents include ammonia (e.g., in the form of ammonium hydroxide) and ammonium salts (e.g., ammonium carbonate, ammonium bicarbonate, ammonium phosphate). Ammonium hydroxide is preferred. The reaction is preferably carried out by dissolving the N-oxide of Formula VI in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane, adding the aminating agent to the solution, and then slowly adding the acylating agent. The product or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be isolated using conventional methods.<br>
Alternatively, step (5) may be carried out by (i) reacting an N-oxide of Formula VI with an isocyanate and then (ii) hydrolyzing the resulting product. Pan (i) involves reacting the N-oxide with an isocyanaie wherein the isocyanato group is bonded to a carbonyl group. Preferred isocyanates include trichloroacetyl isocyanate and aroyl isocyanates such as benzoyl isocyanate. The reaction of the isocyanate with the N-oxide is carried out under substantially anhydrous conditions by adding the isocyanate to a solution of the N-oxide in an inert solvent such as chloroform or dichloromethane. Part (ii) involves hydrolysis of the product from pan (i). The hydrolysis can be carried out by conventional methods such as heating in the presence of water or a lower alkanol optionally in the presence of a catalyst such as an alkali metal hydroxide or lower alkoxide.<br><br><br>

Further, the compounds may cause proliferation and differentiation of B-lymphocytes.<br>
Compounds of the invention also have an effect on the acquired immune response. For example, although mere is not believed to be any direct effect on T cells or direct induction of T cell cytokines, the production of the T helper type 1 (Th 1) cytokine IFN-y is induced indirectly and the production of the T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 are inhibited upon administration of the compounds. This activity means that the compounds are useful in the treatment of diseases where upregulation of the Th 1 response and/or downregulation of the Th2 response is desired. In view of the ability of compounds of Formula la to inhibit the Th2 immune response, the compounds are expected to be useful in the treatment of atopic diseases, e.g., atopic dermatitis, asthma,<br><br>
allergy, and allergic rhinitis; and systemic lupus erythematosis; as a vaccine adjuvant for cell mediated immunity; and possibly as a treatment for recurrent fungal diseases and chlamydia.<br>
The immune response modifying effects of the compounds make them useful in the treatment of a wide variety of conditions. Because of their ability to induce the production of cytokines such as IFN-a and/or TNF-ot, the compounds are particularly useful in the treatment of viral diseases and tumors. This immunomodulating activity suggests that compounds of the invention are useful in treating diseases such as, but not limited to, viral diseases including genital warts; common warts; plantar warts; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis C; Herpes Simplex Virus Type I and Type II; molluscum contagiosum; HIV; CMV; VZV; intraepithelial neoplasias such as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: human papillomavirus (HPV) and associated neoplasias; fungal diseases, e.g. Candida, aspergillus, and cryptoooccal meningitis; neoplastic diseases, e.g., basal cell carcinoma, hairy cell leukemia, Kaposi's sarcoma, renal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, myelogenous leukemia, multiple myeloma, melanoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and other cancers; parasitic diseases, e.g. Pneumocystis camii, cryptosporidiosis, histoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis, trypanosome infection, leishmaniasis; and bacterial infections, e.g., tuberculosis, mycobacterium avium. Additional diseases or conditions that can be treated using the compounds of the invention include eczema; eosinophilic, essential thrombocythaemia; leprosy; multiple sclerosis; Ommen's syndrome; discoid lupus; Bowen's disease; Bowenoid papulosis; and to enhance or stimulate the healing of wounds, including chronic wounds.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides a method of inducing cytokine biosynthesis in an animal comprising administering an effective amount of a compound of Formula I to the animal. An amount of a compound effective to induce cytokine biosynthesis is an amount sufficient to cause one or more cell types, such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and B-cells to produce an amount of one or more cytokines such as, for example, IFN-a, TNF-a, IL-1,6,10 and 12 that is increased over the background level of such cytokines. The precise amount will vary according to factors known in the art but is expected to be a dose of about lOOng/kg to about 50mg/kg, preferably about lOug/kg to about 5mg/kg. The invention also provides a method of treating a viral infection in an animal, and a method of treating a neoplastic disease in an animal, comprising<br><br>
administering an effective amount of a compound of Formula I to the animal. An amount effective to treat or inhibit a viral infection is an amount that will cause a reduction in one or more of the manifestations of viral infection, such as viral lesions, viral load, rate of virus production, and mortality as compared to untreated control animals. The precise amount will vary according to factors known in the art but is expected to be a dose of lOOng/kg to about 50mg/kg, preferably about lOug/kg to about 5mg/kg. An amount of a compound effective to treat a neoplastic condition is an amount that will cause a reduction in tumor size or in the number of tumor foci.   Again, the precise amount will vary according to factors known in the art but is expected to be a dose of about lOOng/kg to about 50mg/kg, preferably about 1 Oug/kg to about Smg/kg.<br>
