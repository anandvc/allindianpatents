				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a&gt;j/process for the preparation of a magnesium halide supported metallocene catalyst. More particularly it relates to the process for the preparation of the said catalyst which is supporied on magnesium chloride obtained by exploiting the solubility of magnesium chloride into tetrahydrofuran. The catalyst prepared by the process of the present invention is capable of olefin polymerization and copolymerization, giving olefin polymers and copolymers with high catalyst activity and capable of being used at high temperatures without any loss of activity.<br>
Metallocene based catalyst systems which have been developed recently allow unprecedented control on polyolefin structures through catalyst design and have enabled the synthesis of entirely new families of homo and copolymers. Olefin polymerization catalysts comprising of a metallocene and aluminum alkyl component are well known in the prior art. The molecular weight of the polymer product can be controlled by adjusting the reaction temperature or the amount of cocatalyst or by the addition of hydrogen. These catalysts require use of aluminoxane or cocatalyst, which is produced by reacting an aluminum alkyl with water. Such reaction is very rapid and highly exothermic. Processes for the production of olefins are known with the help of homogeneous catalysts system consisting of a transition metal component of the type,<br>
metallocene, and cocatalyst component of oligomeric aluminum compound of the type, aluminoxane ( usually methylaluminoxane, herein after refered to as MAO), which lead to the higher activity with narrow molecular weight distribution polymers or copolymers. Furthermore, US Pat. No. 4, 659, 685, discloses polymerization of olefins with the aid of a solid catalyst comprising a zirconium based metallocene and a cocatalyst consisting of an organoaluminimi compound, especially, MAO. However, this catalyst is preferably used in an aromatic hydrocarbon. It is not suited to heterogeneous processes of polymerization in suspension or in gaseous phase.<br>
The principle disadvantages of these soluble homogeneous metallocene-MAO catalyst system are , the need for the large excess of MAO,<br>
(Al/Metal &gt; 10^ ) for obtaining reasonable polymerization activities, poor control on polymer morphologies. Furthermore, when used in processes such as gas or slurry, there is a tendency for reactor fouling by forming deposits of the polymer on the surface or the walls of the reactor and stirrer. These deposits result in the agglomeration of the polymer particles when the metallocene and aluminoxanes or both exists in the suspension medium. Such deposits in the reactor system must be removed regularly. Otherwise they prevent adequate heat removal from the reaction, adversely affecting the product.quality.<br>
The above disadvantages can be obviated by the use of heterogeneous catalysis, suitable for suspension polymerization in aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon medium, and also in gas phase polymerization processes in which it is important to control the size, particle size distribution, and the morphology of the catalyst particle at the same time. Nevertheless, the catalyst should withstand the growth stresses during the course of gas-phase polymerization. It is also desirable that the solid catalyst be capable of producing an ethylene or an ethylenc copolymer with an easily controllable average molecular weight and a narrow molecular weight distribution which is a useful material for injection moulding.<br>
A number of patents e.g. JP 05, 125, 112; JP 05, 51, 411; JP 05, 320, 237; JP 05, 186, 524 (Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals) describe magnesium chloride supported zirconium based metallocene catalysts used lor the polymerization of propylene. A few patents are available in the literature for the polymerization of ethylene using magnesium chloride supported metallocene catalysts. According to Eur. Pat. Appl. No. EP 57d, 213 (Mitsubishi Petrochemical Co. Ltd.), polyethylene can be produced with the aid of a solid catalyst comprising of zirconium based metallocene supported on magnesium chloride-2-ethylhexanol. However, the catalyst thus obtained was found to be less active with a relatively broad molecular weight distribution, 3.59.<br>
JP 04, 275, 511, (Idemitsu Petrochemical Co. Ltd.) describes another magnesium ethoxide supported metallocene catalyst used for the suspension polymerization of ethylene in n-heptane. However, magnesium alkoxide support depresses polymerization activity.<br>
Eur. Pat. Appl. No. EP 435, 514 and EP 436, 326 (BP Chemicals Ltd. ) describes a solid supported zirconocene catalyst useful for the polymerization of ethylene in suspension and also in gas-phase. The support was prepared by a reaction of di-n-butylmagnesium with a tertiary butyl halide in presence of an ether such as diisoamyl ether with or without an alcohol such as, n-butanol in an aliphatic hydrocarbon medium. These catalysts are prepared by a multi step process involving compounds such as ether/alcohols in the catalyst forming steps. Ethers/alcohols are known to react with organoaluminum compounds and hence precise control of their proportions is necessary during catalyst preparation. Otherwise, catalyst with poor or irreproducible properties will be obtained.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide arocess for the preparation of a magnesium halide supported metallocene catalyst for olefin polymerization and copolymerization catalyst capable of producing high catalyst activity, narrow molecular weight distributions, especially at high temperatures and capable of being used either in gas<br>
phase or slurry phase processes. It is also an object of the present invention to provide a catalyst capable of giving olefin polymers and copolymers with excellent particle characteristics and high yield, especially at high temperature and at low aluminum to metal ratio. Another object of the present invention is to simplify the catalyst preparation steps.<br>

The process of the present invention is described herein below with examples which are illustrative only and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention in any manner.<br>
Example-1 These exaples illustrate the preparation of the catalyst precursor :<br>
All glass equipments were heated in vacuo and flushed with nitrogen. All manipulations involving air-sensitive compounds were performed inside a Labconco Model 50004 inert atmosphere glove box continuously purged with high purity N2 from a generator (Spantech<br>
Model NG 300-1) or under a positive pressure of high purity N2 using<br>
standard bench top inert atmosphere techniques. The solvent n-hexane, xylene and electron donor(tetrahydrofuran) used in each case freshly distilled over sodium under N2- Magnesium was estimated titrimelrically<br>
using EDTA. Chlorine was estimated by argeiHometric method. The amount of zirconium in the catalyst was determined by using Inductively Coupled Plasma taking zirconium atomic absorbtion standard solution.<br>
Example-2<br>
In a three neck round bottom flask equipped with magnetic needle, reflux condenser, N2 inlet and outlet which was previously flame dried<br>
under vacuum and cooled under N2 atmosphere. 0.30 g of magnesium<br>
turnings (corresponding to 0.0125 mol of Mg) were taken inside (he flask which was activated by iodine followed by addition of 40 niL of<br>
tetrahydrofuran and the slurry was stirred at a temperature of 25 lo 3()°C for 1/2 h.<br>
A mixture (10 mL) of 1,2-dichloroethane and tetrahydrofuran (1:1) was added to the slurry by means of a syringe over a period of 1/2 h. It was observed that all the magnesium turnings were slowly dissolved in tetrahydrofuran with the formation of a clear solution. Steady evolution of ethylene gas was also observed indicating the decomposition of the intermediate chloroethyl magnesium complex with the subs quent formation of magnesium dichloride tetrahydrofuran complex and its dissolution into tetrahydrofuran.<br>
In another round bottom flask 0.31 g of bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium<br>
dichloride (corresponding to 1.06x 10 ~3 mol as Zr) was dissolved in 20 mL of tetrahydrofuran and the solution was added to the previous<br>
solution over a period of 1/2 h at a temperature of about 25 to 30°C with<br>
constant stirring. The whole solution was then transferred into 500 mL round bottom flask containing 300 mL of n-hexane. The white solid precipitates out which was washed three to four times by n-hexane using 50 mL each time. Finally it was dried under vacuum and used as such for polymerization.<br>
The solid catalyst thus prepared, containing 0.65 wt% of Zr, 10.wt% of Mg and 65 wt% of THF respectively and a surface area of 18.5 m^/g.<br>
ExampIe-3<br>
In a three neck round bottom flask equipped with magnetic needle, reflux condenser, N2 inlet and outlet which was previously flame dried<br>
under vacuum and cooled under N2 atmosphere. 0.215 g of Mg turnings (corresponds to 0.01 mol of Mg) were taken inside the flask which was activated by iodine followed by addition of 40 mL of tetrahydrofuran<br>
and the slurry was stirred at a temperature of 25 to 30°C for 1/2 h.<br>
A mixture (10 mL) of 1,2-dichloroethane and tetrahydrofuran (1:1) was added to the slurry by means of a syringe over a period of 1/2 h. It was observed that all the magnesium turnings were slowly dissolved in tetrahydrofuran with the formation of a clear solution. Steady evolution of ethylene gas was also observed indicating the decomposition of the<br>
ntermediate chloroethyl magnesium complex with the subs quent formation of magnesium dichloride tetrahydrofuran complex and its dissolution into tetrahydrofuran.<br>
In another round bottom flask 0.243 g of bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride (corresponding to 8.31 x 10 '4 mol as Zr) was dissolved in 15 mL of tetrahydrofuran and the solution was added to the previous<br>
solution over a period of 1/2 h at a temperature of about 30°C with constant stirring. The whole solution was then transferred into 500 mL round bottom flask containing 250 mL of n-hexane. The white solid precipitates out which was washed three to four times by n- hexane using 50 mL each time. Finally it was dried under vacuum and used as such for polymerization.<br>
