New process for preparing 4-aminomethyl-3-alkoxyiminopyrrolidine methanesulfonate_<br>
*	»   i<br>
1  i ■<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing 4-aminomethyl-3-alkoxyiminopyrrolidine methanesulfonate of the following formula (I):<br><br>
wherein R represents CL-4 alkyl or CM haloalkyl, which is a useful intermediate for preparing quinolone antibiotics, particularly (R,S)-7-(3-aminomethyl-4-syn-alkoxyimino-pyn-olidin-l-yl)-l-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-4^ acid of the following formula (VI):<br><br>
wherein R is as defined above, salt, or hydrate thereof as described in USP 5,633,262 and EP 0 688 772 Al.<br>
The process of the present invention adopts a new synthetic pathway having shortened number of steps for preparing Compound (I) compared with the earlier processes, whereby Compound (I) is produced in a high yield. Accordingly, the present invention cuts the production cost down, and ultimately contributes to economic preparation of Compound (VI).<br><br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
W099/44991 and WO01/17961 disclose a process for preparing Compound (I) as depicted in Reaction Scheme 1:<br>
Reaction Scheme 1<br><br>
wherein R represents C1-4 alkyl or C1-4 haloalkyl, and P and P2 each represent the same or different protecting group.<br>
W099/44991 specifically describes a process from Compound (II) to Compound (3)-m the-above Re action-Scheme- 1, which consists of two reduction: steps-of-the-nitriie-group and one protection step of the amine group.<br>
Compound (1) is produced from Compound (II) by a hydrogenation process using such a catalyst as Ra-Ni, etc. for the first reduction of nitrile group. As the solvent, a mixture of water and isopropyl alcohol is used in an amount of 2 to 20 equiv with respect to Compound (II).<br>
Compound (2) is produced from Compound (1) by protecting the amine group. As the protecting group, formyl, acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, benzoyl, p-toluenesulfonyl, methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, t-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, p-methoxy-benzyl, trityl, tetrahydropyranyl, pivaloyl, etc. may be used. Among these protecting groups, t-butoxycarbonyl is particularly preferred. However, (BOQ2O used for the introduction of the t-butoxycarbonyl group is an expensive reagent to contribute about 1/3<br><br>
of the total cost for preparing Compound (2) from Compound (1). Furthermore, the reaction temperature is difficult to control due to high exothermic and fast reaction rate. Failure of the control of the reaction temperature led to the formation of the dimer of Compound (2). Also, Compound (2) should be separated through an extractive work-up and solidification process. These work-up processes make this process complicate.<br>
Compound (3) is produced from Compound (2) by the second hydrogenation process using Pd/C catalyst. The catalyst is used in an amount of 0.5-20% by weight, and an amine or buffer solution is used to prevent reduction of the carbonyl group at 3-position of the pyrrolidine ring.<br>
The process for preparing Compound (I) from Compound (4) is disclosed in WO01/17961, wherein the protecting group is removed using methanesulfonic acid to form a salt. However, this process requires two recrystallization processes to produce high quality product.   These operations lowered the productivity and resulted in low yield.<br>
Differently from the Reaction Scheme 1 above, EP 0 688 772 Al describes a process" for preparing Compound: (4) from Compound"(H)~as depicted in Reaction Scheme 2.<br><br>
wherein R represents C1-4 alkyl or C1-4 haloalkyl, and P and P' each represent the same or different protecting group.<br>
EP 0 688 772 Al provides a process for preparing Compound (4) from Compound<br><br>
(II) wherein the carbonyl and nitrile groups are reduced simultaneously to give the amino<br>
alcohol intermediate, and the alcohol group is selectively oxidized to give the carbonyl<br>
group again. This process requires reagents difficult to be applied to the industrial<br>
production, and so has little merit compared with the process of W099/44991. Particularly,<br>
this process uses a homogeneous catalyst for the hydrogenation of the nitrile group, but<br>
preparation of the homogeneous catalyst and its recovery and reproduction after the<br>
reaction are not easy.	,<br>
DISCLOSURE<br>
As mentioned above, the earlier processes for preparing Compound (I) have such problems as complicated process, high production cost, poor reproducibility, etc., and so it has been required to develop an improved new process.<br>
Extensive study led to the present invention wherein the two step hydrogenation of W099/44991 is converted into one step hydrogenation, and the use of expensive organic reagents, particularly (BOQ2O, and various organic solvents and reagents is avoided.<br>
Therefore, the present invention provides a new and effective process for preparing Compound (I).<br>
The present invention also provides a process for preparing Compound (VI) by using Compound (I) prepared by the above process.<br>
The present invention also provides new intermediates used in the process for preparing Compound (I).<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br><br>
As the first aspect, the present invention provides a process for preparing Compound (I): <br>
wherein R represents CM alkyl or CM haloalkyl, which comprises the steps of,<br>
a)	reacting Compound (II):<br><br>
wherein P represents a protecting group, with alkoxyamine or haloalkoxyamine or salt thereof in the presence of a base to give Compound (IE):<br><br>
wherein R and P each are as defined above,<br>
b)	reacting Compound (III) with methanesulfonic acid to give Compound (IV):<br><br>
wherein R is as defined above, and<br>
c)	adding methanesulfonic acid and hydrogenation catalyst to Compound (IV) and<br>
subjecting the compound to hydrogenation reaction to give Compound (I).<br>
In the above process, the protecting group P may include formyl, acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, benzoyl, p-toluenesulfonyl, methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, t-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, p-methoxybenzyl, trityl, tetrahydropyranyl, pivaloyl,<br><br>
etc., and the most preferable one is t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC).   Also, R is preferably<br>
methyl.<br>
The above process for preparing Compound (I) may be depicted as follows:<br><br>
wherein R represents Q-4 alkyl or CM haloalkyl, and P represents a protecting group.<br>
Step (a)<br>
The process for converting Compound (II) into Compound (HI) is carried out in the"presence"o"f a base.-A-preferably used base includes methylamine, tri-n-butylamirie, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, 4-(4-methyl-piperidin-l-yl)-pyridine, and sodium acetate. The base is preferably used in an amount of 0.01-10 equiv with respect to Compound (II).<br>
The reactant, alkoxyamine or haloalkoxyamine, is preferably used in the form of an acid addition salt, particularly hydrochloride form. The alkoxyamine, haloalkoxyamine, or salt thereof is used in an amount of 1 to 2 equiv with respect to Compound (E).<br>
Solvents, which can be used in this step include water, organic solvent, or a mixture thereof, preferably straight-chain or branched C1-6-alc'ohol, more preferably MeOH, EtOH, or IPA (isopropyl alcohol).<br>
The reaction temperature and time in step (a) may be varied depending on the base and solvent used. The reaction temperature ranges, for example, from room temperature to<br><br>
2001C. But, a person skilled in the art may easily determine the appropriate reaction temperature and time according to the base and solvent used.<br>
One best mode of the present invention, is to use triethylamine as the base. In this case, Compound (H) is refluxed with alkoxyamine hydrochloride in the presence of triethylamine and methanol for 22 hours.<br>
Another best mode of the present invention is to use sodium acetate as the base. In this case, Compound (II) is added to a solution of alkoxyamine hydrochloride and sodium acetate in ethanol or methanol, and the mixture is refluxed for about 18 hours.<br>
Another best mode of the present invention is to use pyridine as the base. In this case, Compound (II) is added to a solution of alkoxyamine hydrochloride and pyridine in isopropyl alcohol or methanol, and the mixture is reacted with stirring for about 5 hours. This process is convenient because it is carried out at room temperature.<br>
The pure Compound (III) may be obtained by applying the processes exemplified in the above best modes without any side product that is detected by HPLC.<br>
Step (b)<br>
The reaction from Compound (EI) to Compound (IV) is to remove the protecting group by methanesulfonic acid. Methanesulfonic acid is used in an amount of about 0.5 to 3 equiv, preferably about 1 to 1.2 equiv with respect to Compound (lH). The protecting group is easily removed by such an acid as methanesulfonic acid. As shown in the examples below, it can be identified by NMR, HPLC, etc. that the protecting group is easily removed by about 30minutes' reflux.<br>
Step (c)<br>
The reaction from Compound (IV) to the desired compound, Compound (I), is a<br>
selective hydrogenation reaction using such Raney type metal catalysts as Raney-Ni,<br>
Raney-Co, etc. or metal catalysts incorporated into supports such as activated carbon,<br>
alumina, silica, etc.   Metals used as the active site of the catalyst include the metals like<br>
7<br><br>
Ni, Co, Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh, Ir, Cu, etc. and the palladium precursors like palladium chloride, palladium nitrate, palladium acetate, etc., but the palladium catalyst is more preferable. Usually, activity of the catalyst may be changed by the influence of other metals added in a small amount in the form of a co-catalyst, or by reaction conditions such as pressure, temperature, etc., and so the selectivity for the desired product can be controlled thereby. The hydrogenation catalyst particularly preferable for being used in the present invention is Pd catalyst not only having 1 to 20% by weight of Pd but also incorporated in a support selected from the group consisting of carbon, silica, and alumina. This hydrogenation catalyst is preferably used in an amount of 0.01 to 10% by weight with respect to Compound (IV) based on the metal component.<br>
The hydrogenation reaction is carried out preferably under the temperature range of 0 to 50 °C and the hydrogen pressure of 1 to 100 atm.<br>
Methanesulfonic acid is added to the reaction solution in an amount of about 0.5 to 3 equiv, preferably about 1 to 1.2 equiv with respect to Compound (HI).<br>
As-the-selverrt-ttsed in-this step, one-or-more organic solvents selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane, dioxane, ethyl acetate and dichloromethane, preferably methanol can be mentioned.<br>
The step (c) reaction may also be carried out in the presence of an acid as a further additive. The acid includes hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, methanesulfonic acid, etc., and methanesulfonic acid is the most preferable. In order to increase the yield, it is preferable to add the acid in an amount to control the reaction solution to pH 1 to 2.5 during the hydrogenation reaction, and the acid may be added to the reaction solution at the time of initiation, or continuously in the middle, of the reaction.<br>
As the second aspect, the present invention provides a process for preparing Compound (I):<br><br><br><br>
This second process has such merits as explained for the first process, and is more effective since the number of steps is decreased from 3 to 2.<br>
Step (a)<br>
Step (a) of the second process is carried out according to the same manner as Step (a) of the first process.<br>
Step (b)<br>
In Step (b) of the second process, Steps (b) and (c) of the first process are concurrently carried out.<br>
The amount of methanesulfonic acid is the total amount of methanesulfonic acid used in Steps (b) and (c) of the first process, i.e., about 1 to 6 equiv, preferably about 1.5 to 2.5 equiv with respect to Compound (III). Further, the hydrogenation catalyst is introduced in an amount of 0.01 to 10% by weight with respect to Compound (HI) based on the metal component.<br>
The solvent used in Step (b) of the second process is an organic solvent selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane, dioxane, ethyl acetate and dichloromethane, or a mixture of this organic solvent and water. The mixture of an organic solvent and water is more preferable. When the mixture is used, the mixing ratio is between 0.2 to 50 volumes of the organic solvent to 1 volume of water. Particularly preferable solvent is a mixture of methanol and water.<br>
Besides, the same reaction conditions as Step (c) of the first process may be applied to this step.<br>
As the third aspect, the present invention provides a process for preparing Compound (VI):<br><br><br>
wherein R represents CM alkyl or CM haloalkyl, salt or hydrate thereof, which comprises the step of reacting Compound (I):<br><br>
wherein R is as defined above, which is prepared according to the first or second process as explained above, with Compound (V):<br><br>
wherein X represents a leaving group, preferably halogen.<br>
In this process, the reaction of Compound (I) with Compound (V) is preferably carried out in the presence of a base and in a solvent. The specific reaction conditions may be easily controlled by a person skilled in the art by referring to PCT/GB00/03358.<br>
Compound (VI) is preferably (R,S)-7-(3'-aminomethyl-4-syn-methoxyimino-pyrrolidin-1 -yl)-1 -cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic<br>
acid methanesulfonate or its hydrate.<br>
As the fourth aspect, the present invention provides new Compound (IE) with the following formula:<br><br><br>
wherein R represents CM alkyl or CM haloalkyl, and P represents a protecting group.<br>
P is preferably t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC).<br>
As the fifth aspect, the present invention also provides new Compound (IV) with the following formula:<br><br>
wherein R represents c1-4alkyl or C1-4 haloalkyl.<br>
Compounds (III) and (IV) above are useful as intermediates for preparing Compound (I).<br>
