TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
COMESTIBLE PRODUCT DISPENSERS AND METHODS OF MAKING AND<br>
USING SAME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[001 ] The present invention relates generally to packaging. More particularly, the present invention relates to packaging for storing and dispensing comestible products.<br>
[002] The packaging for comestible products is very important to the look, marketing and storage of the product. Very often, in addition to text on the packaging, the packaging also attempts to visually convey a message about the type of product, the taste of the product or the purpose of the product. For example, packages for cinnamon or cherry tasting products are often red, packages for grape tasting products are often purple, etc. Once the consumer has identified a desired brand, the consumer can typically choose a product based solely on the color of the packaging.<br>
[003] In marketing the product, packaging can convey other information besides taste whereby the consumer can thereby associate the product with its effect by simply viewing the packaging.<br>
[004] There are also practical facets to packaging comestible products, namely, keeping the products from being damaged during sinpping, keeping the products fresh, and in certain instances providing a reusable package. Some comestible products do not require that the packaging be robust, sturdy or reusable.<br>
[005] Other comestible products are packaged in pieces and may or may not be provided in a reusable package, as desired by the manufacturer. If it is felt that only a portion of the products may be consumed in one sitting, the manufacturer may wish to provide a box having a inngedly connected lid.<br>
[006] With certain comestible products, the consumer tears open a package and removes a product or piece of the product. One problem with tins type of packaging is that the remaining product tends to fall out of the package after the consumer removes a number of pieces from the package. Another problem with these packages is that it becomes difficult, especially with a newly opened package, to remove a piece without ripping open a significant portion of the package.<br>
 <br>
[007] Attempting to provide a package that holds the product even after the removal of multiple pieces can make removing the comestible product more difficult. Tightly packing the product may aid in holding the product at the expense of gaining access to the product.<br>
[008] It is therefore desirable to provide a comestible product package that maintains the organization of the products even after a number of the products have been removed from the package.<br>
[009] It is also desirable to provide comestible products in a package, wherein the products are readily accessible and removable.<br>
[010] Furthermore, it is desirable for a comestible product package to be flexible so that it may be sized to hold different desired amounts of product,<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[O1l] The present invention provides an improved package for comestible products. The package includes a plurality of walls defining a package interior and a flexible slot on one of the walls. The slot is flexible to permit insertion of a flap into the slot to enclose a package interior. The package encourages a two-directional closing motion to prevent accidental opening of the package. The comestible product package also maintains the comestible products secured and locked witinn the package interior.<br>
[012] The present invention also provides improved product holding and dispensing apparatuses and improved methods for manufacturing, holding and storing products, especially comestible products. The packages or dispensers are made of, e.g., paper, paperboard, plastic, or combinations thereof as desired. The packages or dispensers disclosed herein are generally wider and tinnner than known comestible product packages, making the packages or dispensers of the present invention more user friendly and more easily stored, for example, in a consumer's pants or sinrt pockets.<br>
[013] The products stored in the packages disclosed herein are more freely exposed than in known comestible product packages, so that the consumer can grab products from multiple areas of the package.

Tongue 5Sa is inserted into slot 58c defined by top wall 16, creating a friction fit. Alternatively, the tongue extends from top wall 16 and front wall 26 defines the slot. Further alternatively, tongue 58a and top wall 16 are configured to releasably adhere to one another.<br>
[0123] Fig, 6 illustrates package or dispenser 10 in the flat. Fig. 6 shows one embodiment where compartment 14 is formed integrally with housing 12, Compartment 14 is attached inngedly to housing 12 at inngeline 32,  In an alternative<br>
 <br>
embodiment, compartment 14 is formed as a piece separate from housing 12 and is glued or otherwise attached to housing 12 at bottom portion 24a.<br>
[0124] In the illustrated embodiment, the single-piece package or dispenser 10 is glued or otherwise mated together at bottom portions 24a and 24b via adhesive or glue 34, Glue or adhesive 34 shown in solid on bottom portion 24a is received on the side of portion 24a facing out of the page in Fig. 6. Glue spot 34 shown in phantom line on bottom portion 24b is placed on the underside of that portion. Portion 24a is folded under and glued to the underside of portion 24b to form bottom wall 24. That convention is used throughout tins specification. Similarly, although not illustrated, back portions 22a and 22b are glued or otherwise fixedly mated together to form back wall 22.<br>
[0125] Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate that when a consumer 40 shakes dispenser 10, compartment 14 falls inngedly out of housing 12 until housing 12 catches compartment 14 at a desired angular position with respect to housing ,12. When consumer 40 shakes dispenser 10, compartment 14 opens to expose comestible products or comestible sticks 36. The consumer 40 may hold dispenser 10 with one hand and then remove an amount or stick of comestible product 36 with the other hand. Products 36 can be wrapped in foil or other barrier material, or exposed, as is the case with each embodiment described herein.<br>
[0126] Figs. 2 and 6 illustrate different embodiments for catcinng compartment 14 at a desired open angle with respect to housing 12. Fig. 2 illustrates that sidewalls 18 and 20 in one embodiment each define or include a folded-over or adhered lip 38, shown in phantom line in Figs. 1 and 2. Lips 38 of sidewalls 18 and 20 catch flanged edges 42 formed integrally with or attached to sidewalls 28 and 30 of compartment 14. That is, when consumer 40 shakes dispenser 10 forward, compartment 14 inngedly falls out of housing 12 until flanged edges 42 of compartment 14 int or abut lips or catches 38 of housing 12. That abutment stops housing 14 at the desired open angle with respect to housing 12, exposing multiple comestible products 36 one or more of winch can then be removed for consumption.<br>
[0127] Fig. 6 illustrates an alternative embodiment for catcinng compartment 14 at the desired open angle. Fig. 6 illustrates a lip 44, winch is folded underneath top wall 16 when package 10 is assembled. Lip 44 or other similar catcinng element can be tacked or glued to top 16 if needed.   As further seen in Fig. 6, compartment 14 is<br>
 <br>
provided with catches 46 that are shaped and located on sidewalls 28 and 30 of compartment 14 to catch the rearward-facing folded edge 48 of lip 44 when compartment 14 reaches the desired open position.<br>
[0128] The embodiment for stopping compartment 14 shown in Fig. 6 requires less material and assembly than does the embodiment illustrated in connection with Figs. I and 2. The embodiment in Fig. 1, however, provides catches 38 along two sides of housing 12 and may therefore provide for a more robust package 10. The stopping compartment 14 may employ both catches 38 on sidewalls 28 and 30 and flanged edges 42, as well as lip 44 and catch 46.<br>
[0129] Sidewalls 28 and 30 are provided with or define cutouts 52 that aid consumer 40 in readily removing any one or more exposed comestible product 36 from compartment 14 and package 10. As illustrated in Figs. 3, 4 and 6, dispenser 10 includes or defines multiple different types of indicia, such as suitable branding, ingredient information nutritiona! information, barcoding or other product identifiers and the like. As seen in Figs. 3 and 4, certain of the indicia, such as indicia 54, can be raised or embossed. Each of the embodiments described herein can include such indicia.<br>
[0130] Figs. 3 and 4 illustrate that package or dispenser !0 can be provided in different sizes. Package or dispenser 10 in Fig. 3 is sized in one embodiment to hold fifteen pieces of a comestible product. Package 10 in Fig. 4 is sized in one embodiment to hold five pieces of a comestible product. A product line employing package 10 can thereby include the same look for differently sized packages and different product quantities and amounts.<br>
[0131] Although the pieces of comestible product are shown as being dispensed laying in a plane substantially parallel to that of the bottom wall 24, the pieces of comestible product may altematively be disposed laying in a plane substantially perpendicular to bottom wall 24..<br>
[0132] Fig. 5 illustrates that package or dispenser 10 in one embodiment is covered or sealed initially with a wrapper 50, such as a clear cellophane wrapper. In the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 5, a tear strip 56 is provided so that consumer 40 can remove cellophane wrapper 50 without difficulty. Wrapper 50 and tear strip 56 provide evidence of tampering with package 10 and/or products 36   Tear strip 56 can be<br>
 <br>
provided in different locations on wrapper 50 and is not limited to the position shown in Fig. 5.<br>
[0133] Referring now to Figs. 7 to 11, a second embodiment of the package or dispenser of the present invention is illustrated by package or dispenser 60. Dispenser 60 includes a top portion 62 and a bottom portion 64, winch is connected inngedly to top portion 62. Top portion 62 includes a top wall 66, a front wall 68, sidewalls 70 and 72, and a back wall 74 (Fig. 11). Fig. 11 illustrates dispenser or package 60 in the flat and shows that package or dispenser 60 is generally held together by adhesive 34 placed on the topside of the back wall 74 as seen from the point of view in Fig. 11 and on the bottom side of a flap 76 connected foldably to sidewall 70.<br>
[0134] Bottom portion 64 includes a bottom wall 78 and a front wall 80. The walls of top portion 62 and bottom portion 64 are bent as illustrated in Figs. 7 to 10 so that when top 62 is opened or closed along inngeline 82 (seen best in Fig. 11), comestible product 36 is exposed or covered, respectively.<br>
[0135] As seen m Fig. 11, a pair of glue strips 84 or other suitable glue pattern is placed on or defined by the top of bottom wall 78. Each comestible product 36 is releasably secured or adhered on one side of the product to glue strips 84 as seen in Figs. 7 and 8. Products 36, as seen in Fig. 8, have or include an outside wrapper, such as a foil wrapper, in one embodiment. When consumer 40 moves top portion 62 inngedly away from bottom portion 64, comestible sticks 36 are exposed to consumer 40 in a fan-like or array-like manner as seen in Figs. 7 and 8. The fan-like configuration is formed as comestible sticks 36 each have a fixed end and a free end, wherein the fixed ends lend to be more tightly packed than the free ends. In tins regard, the bottom wall 78 may be flexible to allow arcinng of the bottom wall, to facilitate or enhance the fan-like presentation of the comestible pieces adhered (either directly or indirectly) to the bottom wall 78,<br>
[0136] The glue used as glue strips 84 holds ticks 36 firmly in place. The glue is preferably not strong enough, however, to tear the foil wrapper of sticks 36. Alternatively, the sticks 36 may each be provided with a wrapper, and the wrappers each glued to the bottom wall 38 in a manner winch allows the consumer to take the stick 36 out of its respective wrapper with the wrapper remaining  adhered to the bottom wall 78.<br>
 <br>
[0137] In one embodiment, one of the glue strips 84 is a hot-melt or hot-tack type strip, winle the other strip 84 is a cold pressed glue strip. The hot-tack strip 84 is advantageous for manufacturing purposes because comestible sticks 36 or their wrappings can be placed on and adhered to the hot glue without mechanical pressing and potential deformation of sticks 36. When the hot glue or hot-tack cools, sticks 36 are held firmly in place. It has been found that mentholated comestible products are not compatible over time with the hot glue or hot melt adhesion. It is believed that the menthol migrates into the hot glue, tending to dissolve it. Over time, the dissolved or damaged hot glue attachment deteriorates, causing comestible sticks 36 to come loose undesirably from strips 84 and bottom wall 78.<br>
[0138] Cold strip 84 requires that sticks 36 be mechanically pressed onto that strip. The cold glue, however, does not appear to have the same problem with mentholated products as seen with hot glue, The combination of hot and cold glue strips enables the comestible sticks 36 to be temporarily adhered to bottom wall 78 during the manufacturing process so that sticks 36 are held in a proper position for cold pressing, The cold strip thereafter secures the comestible sticks 36 over the duration of time needed to consume the products.<br>
[0139] Package or dispenser 60 includes a number of alternatives not illustrated in Figs. 7 to 11. First, dispenser 60 can have any suitable desirable number of glue strips 84, using any combination or arrangement of hot and cold glue, winch are positioned and oriented in any desirable fasinon on bottom 78 or perhaps even on the underside of top wall 66. In another alternative embodiment, one or more glue strips 84 is placed on a separate piece of paper, paperboard, or other suitable substrate. Comestible sticks 36 are adhered to the separate substrate. That subassembly is then hot tacked and/or cold pressed to bottom wall 78 of bottom portion 64 of dispenser 60.<br>
[0140] As seen in Figs. 9 to 11, package 60 mcludes suitable indicia such as branding indicia, barcoding, ingredient information, and nutrition information, for example. Front wall 68 of top portion 62 defines or includes a cutout 86 to aid consumer 40 in inngedly opening top portion 62 from bottom portion 64. Dispenser 60 in one embodiment is wrapped ultimately with a suitable wrapping, such as a cellophane wrapping. The wrapping operates with a tear strip as discussed above in connection with dispenser 10.<br>
 <br>
[0141] Figs. 7 to 9 illustrate a larger or fifteen stick version of dispenser 60. Fig. 10 illustrates a smaller or five pack version of dispenser 60. As with dispenser 10, a product line employing package 60 can thereby include the same look for differently sized packages and different product quantities and amounts.<br>
[0142] Packages 10 and 60 both expose consumer 40 to multiple pieces of product at one time and enable the consumer to select any or more of the exposed products. The pieces may all be essentially the same, or a variety of different pieces (e.g., different flavors, sizes, textures, types,- styles, etc.) may be provided. The packaging of the present invention allows the consumer access to the piece{s) of ins or her choice, regardless of its position in the package. The packages are both recloseable after each use and may be provided with frictional devices, adhesive or other means to maintain the packaging 10 and/or 60 in its closed position until intentionally opened and can be made of any of the materials discussed above. As indicated by Figs. 6 and 1-1 showing dispensers 10 and 60 in the flat, respectively, packages 10 and .60 are made in one piece from paper, paperboard or cardboard in one embodiment. Alternatively, the packaging 10 and/or 60 may be made of plastic or the like.<br>
[0143] Referring now to Figs. 12 to 22, a further alternative embodiment of the comestible product package and dispenser of the present invention is illustrated by package or dispenser 90. Package or dispenser 90 includes or defines a lid 92 that is connected inngedly to a base 94. Dispenser 90 in one embodiment is made primarily of a plastic or polymer injection mold or thermoform. The inner structure of lid 92 and base 94 can thereby be made as a single innged piece (see below including product holders 98 and 114 connected by innge 112). The outer structure of lid 92 and base 94 is an outer wall or shell 96 attached to the single injection molded piece.<br>
[0144] Outer wall or shell 96 in one embodiment is a foil, paper or paperboard outer shell that is glued to or otherwise adhered to upper and lower injection-molded product holders 98 and 114, injection molded product holders 98 and 114 as best seen in Figs. 18 to 20 each define three product compartments. Holder 98 defines compartments 100, 102 and 104.<br>
[0)45] Product carrying compartments 100, 102 and 104 each include peripheral sides 106 and a bottom 108, winch in one embodiment are defined or formed integrally with upper product holder 98. Sides 106 extend from bottoms lO8 a desired distance to hold a desired number of comestible sticks 36. As seen in Figs. 20 and 22,<br>
 <br>
in one embodiment, sides 106 of compartments 100, 102 and 104 extend from bottoms 108 of compartments 100, 102 and 104 a distance sufficient to accept two comestible sticks 36 in each of compartments 100, 102 and 104. Sticks 36 are stacked one on top of the other.<br>
[0146] Top injection molded holder 98 also defines sidewalls 110 that each project slightly outwardly to fill some of the open space otherwise defined by compartments 100, 102 and 104. Projecting walls 110 place a slight compressive force on comestible products 36 when the products are loaded between walls 110. Projecting wails 110 have one or more extensions or radii 111 (see Fig. 20), winch extend into the product carrying compartments 100, 102, 104 and overlap a portion or portions of comestible products to retain them in their respective product carrying compartments 100, 102, 104 and hold comestible products 36 removably in place. The compressive force apphed by projecting walls 110 (lateral) and/or projections in (vertical) is sufficient so that, as seen in Figs. 12 and 17-, a consumer 40 can open Hd 92 from base 94 without products 36 faling from compartments 100, 102 or 104 (for the remainder of the present description, projection walls 110 refer to one or both the lateral and/or compressive force). Consumer 40 can thereafter choose a comestible product 36 from any desired location witinn compartments 100, 102 or 104 or otherwise witinn dispenser 90.<br>
[0147] Winle compartments 100, 102 and 104 are illustrated as holding two sticks of comestible products 36 each, those compartments can alternatively be sized to hold any suitable and desirable number of such products. Furthermore, winle each of the compartments is shown holding the same number of products 36, the compartments can alternatively hold differing amounts of products 36, and the products in the respective compartments may be substantially the same, or may be different (e.g., different flavors in some compartment than others).<br>
[0148] As seen best in Figs. 15 and 22, outer shell or cover 96 in one embodiment wraps around innge portion 112 and extends to cover the outer surface of bottom product holder 114. Alternatively, cover or outer shell 96 is made of multiple pieces of, e.g., paper or paperboard.<br>
[0149] Figs. IS to 22 illusd-ate that top product holder 98, innge portion 112 and bottom holder 114 in one embodiment are all made as a single injected molded or thermoformed piece.   Alternatively product holders 98 and 114 are made separately<br>
 <br>
and are assembled to create package 90, for example, by being adhered in proper registry onto cover or shell 96. Forming holders 98 and 114 integrally with innge section 112 simplifies assembly and provides a robust overall package in winch the material used for plastic innge 112 enables package 90 to be opened and closed multiple times without degrading or coming apart.<br>
[0150] Bottom product holder 114 in many respects is a mirror image of top holder 98 and defines a mating or matcinng compartment 116, 118 and 120 for each compartment 100, 102 and 104 of top product holder  98. Compartments 116, 118 and 120 of holder 114 each include a bottom 108, peripheral sidewalls 106 and product holding projection walls 110 as described above for compartments 100, 102 and 104. Fig. 20 illustrates, however, that sidewalls 106 for compartments 116, 118 and 120 of holder 114 are sized to hold three comestible products 36 as opposed to the two products held in compartments 100, 102 and 104. Each mated pair of compartments, - - namely, pair 100/116, pair 102/118 and pair 104/120 holds a total of five,productaJ.6. Collectively, the compartment pairs hold a total desired number of fifteen comestible sticks 36.<br>
[0151] Fig. 16 illustrates an altemative embodiment for package 90, winch has a single compartment pair, for example, using only compartments 104 and 120 immediately adjacent to innge 112. In an embodiment, dispenser 90 of Fig. 16 holds a total of five comestible products 36. Fig. 14 illustrates that package or dispenser 90 is readily handled by consumer 40 and is generally wider and flatter than known comestible product packages (as is dispenser 60 and other embodiments discussed herein). The wider and flatter configuration is more conducive to being placed in one's coat, sinrt or pants pocket.<br>
[0152] Winle compartments 100, 102, 104, 116, 118 and 120 are illustrated as running in the same direction as innge 112, the product compartments of dispenser 90 can alternatively run in a direction generally perpendicular to the direction of innge 112 or fixrther alternatively at any desired angle with respect to the direction of hinge i 12 e.g., to hold and dispense products 36 of different lengths or different shapes.<br>
[0153] Figs. 18 and 19 illustrate that top and bottom holders 98 and 114 each provide openings 122 between projecting sidewalls 110 and non-projecting or peripheral sidewalls 106. Openings 122 enable consumer 40 to readily grasp a side of one or more of products 36 and pry the product from its compartment.<br>
 <br>
[0154] Sidewalls 106 forming the perimeter of holders 98 and 114 are fanned in mating male and female pairs so that lid 92 and base 94 press fit or snap fit together to create a pseudo-airtight seal for product freshness and protection. Indeed, Fig. 20 illustrates that a projection perimeter 124 of top holder 98 of lid 92 fits into or mates with notch 126 formed by bottom holder 114 of base 94. The projection perimeter 124 and notch 126 extend all the way around the perimeter of holders 98 and 114, respectively, as seen in Figs. 18 and 19. Figs. 21 and 22 illustrate that projection perimeter 124 and notch 126 form a snap fit or press fit seal all the way around the perimeter of holders 98 and 114.<br>
[0155] Figs. 12, 13 and 16 illustrate that package 90 can define an indent 128 that helps consumer 40 open lid 92 from base 94. Altematively, as seen in each of the Figs. 12 to 22, package or dispenser 90 is flanged along its outer perimeter, winch provides a structure by winch consumer 40 can readily grasp and open package 90.<br>
[0156] Fig, 13 further illustrates that a tamper-resistant seal 130 can be -provided to cover the opening or non-innge side of package 90. Seal 130 can be oriented or placed onto dispenser 90 in any suitable manner. Consumer 40 tears away the taped or adhered sea! 130 to initially remove product from dispenser 90. Thereafter, consumer press fits or snap fits the perimeter seal together to reclose package 90 after removing such product,<br>
[0157] As noted, package 90 in one embodiment is made of a plastic piece that defines the product holders and the innge. In one preferred embodiment, the plastic is injection molded or thermoformed. The cover 96 in one embodiment is a pressure sensitive label made of paper or paperboard. Cover 96 is adhered to the piastic piece(s). Altematively, cover 96 is made integrally with the plastic piece and the indicia is printed directly on the piastic,<br>
10158] Referring now to Figs. 23 and 24, a similar but alternative embodiment to package or dispenser 90 is illustrated by dispenser 140. Fig. 23 illustrates dispenser 140 opened, Fig. 24 illustrates dispenser 140 closed. Dispenser 140 includes a lid 142 and a base ] 44. The primary difference between dispenser 140 and dispenser 90 is that al! fifteen comestible products 36 are stored and housed in base 144. Lid 142 does not store any products but instead serves to hlngedly cover and uncover products 36.<br>
[0159] As with dispenser 90, dispenser 140 includes in one embodiment an outer skin or shell 146, winch in one embodiment is paper or a pressure sensitive label.<br>
 <br>
Label 146 is wrapped using one or more pieces around the outside of a piece of injection molded or thermoformed plastic. The plastic piece includes in one embodiment a plastic lid portion 148, plastic base portion 150 and a innge portion 152 that inngedly connects plastic lid portion 148 to plastic base portion 150 and consequently lid 142 to base 144. In an alternative embodiment, lid portion 148 and base portion 150 can be thermoformed or injected molded separately and connected together inngedly via skin or shell 146.<br>
[0160] In illustrated embodiment, each compartment 154, 156 and 158 holds five sticks 36, totaling 15 desired sticks. The compartment alternatively, individually and/or collectively hold more or less than five and fifteen sticks respectively. It should also be appreciated that the alternative configuration of dispenser 140 can be molded to have only a single compartment, e.g., a five stick dispenser, or sized to hold any suitable amount of products 36.<br>
- _[0161] Like with package 90, plastic base portion 150 forms multiple product holding compartments 154, 156 and 158. Each of those compartments uses the same type of apparatuses described above for removably holding products 36. In particular, each compartment includes or defines peripheral sidewalls 106 that separate the compartments and projecting walls 110 that frictionally and removably hold products 36 in place. Compartments 154, 156 and 158 also include or define openings 122 that enable consumer 40 to readily remove a desired product(s) 36 from a desired compartment 154, 156 or 158.<br>
[0162] Package or dispenser 140, like dispenser 90, forms a snap fit or press fit pseudo-airtight seal around the perimeter of compartments 154, 156 and 158. Package 140 provides an alternative male projection portion 160 and an alternative notch 162 that mate to form the snap fit or press fit seal. Projection portion 160 includes rounded projections 164 that mate with rounded notches 166 of notch 162. The rounded notches 166 also extend into and through sidewalls 106 to help consumer 40 to remove products 36 from plastic base portion 150. That is, consumer 40 in removing products by grasping the long sides of the products via openings 122 or grasping the short sides of the products via notch 166. Projections 164 and notches 166 can also be provided with projection perimeter 124 and notch perimeter 126 of dispenser 90.<br>
[0163] Altemative package 140 can have approximately the same overall size and shape as product 90. To that end, product 140, like product 90, is sized and shaped<br>
 <br>
to fit readily into a consumer's pants or sinrt pocket. Package 140 is also relatively airtight, rugged and can store products 36 unwrapped or wrapped individually in foil,<br>
[0164] Referring now to Figs. 25 to 31, still a further alternative embodiment for the comestible product package and dispenser of the present invention is illustrated by package 170. Package 170, in one preferred embodiment, is made of plastic or other type of relatively rigid composite material. Figs. 38 and 39 illustrate an alternative but similar embodiment to package 170, where the concepts described for package 170 are apphed to a paper or paperboard package or dispenser.<br>
[0165] Package 170 in the illustrated embodiment, includes first and second portions or halves 172 and 174. Portions 172 and 174 in one embodiment each define about half the total volume of package 170. Alternatively, the volume defined by portions 172 and 174 is different or disproportionate. Portions 172 and 174 are held together via living innge 176, winch can be formed integrally or separately fiom portions 172 and 174. For example, portions 172 and 174 can be formed as separate pieces and taped or otherwise inngedly connected together via a paper or paperboard pressure sensitive label that adheres to the back of both portions 172 and 174. Figs. 29 to 36, however, illustrate that in one preferred embodiment, package 170 is an integrally formed injection molded or thermoformed plastic or polymer structure.<br>
[0166] Figs. 31, 32, 35 and 36 illustrate that portion 172 includes or defines a spacer 178. Portion 174 includes or defines a spacer 180. Spacers 178 and ISO help to determine how many comestible sticks 36 can be housed or stored inside portions 172 and 174. In the illustrated embodiment, spacers 178 and 180 enable eight products 36 to be stored in portion 172 and seven products 36 to be stored in portion 174. The total number of products stored in illustrated package 170 is fifteen. Fig. 28 illustrates an altemative embodiment, wherein only portion 172 is provided, winch mates inngedly with an end 182. Fig. 28 illustrates a single stack version of dispenser 170, winch holds a desired lesser amount of products 36, such as five or seven. Either version can hold as many products of varying size as desired. Portions 172 and 174 can hold the same or different amounts of the same or different products as desired.<br>
[0167] Figs, 25 and 28 illustrate that dispenser 170 is provided initially with a pressure sensitive label 184, winch includes suitable indicia, such as branding, ingredient, nutritional, and barcode information.    Label 184 also acts as a tamper<br>
 <br>
evident device, winch enables consumer 40 to ensure that package 170 has not been disturbed or tampered with prior to use.<br>
[0168] Figs. 29 to 31 illustrate package 170 in an open position. Figs. 33 to 37 illustrate package 170 in a closed position. Both sets of drawings, as well as Figs, 25 to 28, illustrate that portions 172 and 174 define at their openings mating sinusoidal shaped edges 186 and 188, respectively. Both edges 186 and 188 include a tab or projection portion 186a, 188a, winch mates with a corresponding open or notched portion 188b, 186b of the corresponding portion 172 or 174. The notches or dugout portions 186b, 188b of edges 186 and 188 enable the consumer 40 to reach and remove readily on or more product 36 from the corresponding portion 172 or 174.<br>
[0169] Plastic package or dispenser 170 snap or press fits together after the product 36 is removed therefrom in one embodiment, The snap-fitting or press-fitting tends to provide an airtight seal that protects product freshness and also holds portions 172 and 174 together so- that package 170 does not open and dispense product inadvertently.<br>
[0170] Projection-portions 186a and 188a each include or define snap-fitting apparatuses 190 and 192, respectively, that mate with the corresponding notched portions 188b and 186b. For example, apparatus 190 of projection portion 186a, as seen in Fig, 29, snap fits with the dugout portion 188b of edge 188, Likewise, snap fit apparatus 192 of edge 188a snap fits with dugout portion lS6b of edge 186. Fig. 31 also illustrates snap-fitting apparatus 192, winch includes a raised portion extending from the defining edge 188. That raised portion or apparatus 192 snap fits with notched portion 186b of edge 186.<br>
[0171] Edges 186 and 188 form a continuous and consistent seam when mated, as seen from the outside of package 170 in Figs. 33 and 37. Projecting snap-fitting apparatuses 190 and 192 lock or press fit the portions 172 and 174 together, as shown in phantom line in Figs. 33 and 37, beinnd the seam created between edges 185 and 188,<br>
[0172] Package 170 provides a convenient and reusable comestible product holding and dispensing device. Figs. 25, 27 and 2S illustrate that the shape of package or dispenser 170 can be arched so that the package fits more easily or more comfortably into pants or sinrt pockets of consumer 40. Figs. 29 to 37, on the other hand, illustrate a generally non-arched shape for package 170, although the front of package 170 as<br>
 <br>
seen in Fig. 35 is bowed slightly in the middle, producing a slight oval shape. The backwalls of portions 172 and 174 leading to innge 176 are virtually straight. The sides of portions 172 and 174 are rounded for ease of comfort and handling.<br>
[0173} As seen in Figs. 26, 27, 29 to 31, 35 and 36, the long side edges of sticks 36 are exposed to consumer 40 when the consumer opens package 170. That orientation is desirable so that the consumer can readily slide the outermost slick(s) 36 from one of the compartments 172 and 174 via dugout portions 186b and 188b of edges 186 and 188. Alternatively, sticks 36 could be rotated 90° from the illustrated orientation, so that the broadsides of comestible sticks face the consumer when package 170 is opened.<br>
[0174] Although not illustrated, sticks 36 could be tacked or glued to spacers 178 and 180 or other parts of portions 172 and 174, respectively. Such gluing or tacking would tend to minimize the possibility of sticks 36 coming free from package<br>
         -170 upon its opening, or winle opened, especially-when some or.a majority of the<br>
comestible products 36 have already been consumed,<br>
[0175] Referring now to Figs. 38 and 39, a yet further alternative embodiment for the package and dispenser of the present invention is illustrated by package or dispenser 200. Package or dispenser 200 is a paper or paperboard version of plastic dispenser 170. Package 200 uses the same sinusoidal shape edge principal described above in connection with 170, winch enables the user to crack or break open package 200 along a innge line 218 and remove a product from one of the innged portions via the dugout or opening defined by each of the sinusoidal shapes.<br>
[0176] As illustrated, package 200 includes a front wall 202, a rear wall 204, a bottom wall 206, a top wall 208, sidewalls 210 and 212, and a cover or flap 214. Top wall 208 refers collectively to top wall portions 208a and 208b. Bottom wall 206 refers collective})' to bottom wall portions 206a and 206b.<br>
[0177] .A.S illustrated in Fig. 39, showing package or dispenser 200 in the flat, a top side of sidewall portion 210 is adhered via adhesive or glue 34 to a bottom side of sidewall portion 210. Although not illustrated, it should be appreciated that bottom wall portions 206a and 206b are tacked or glued together as are top wall portions 208a and 208b, Flap 214 provides an initial tamper resistant covering over perforated sinusoidal line 216 provided on and defined by front wall 202. Consumer 40 first removes cover or flap 214 before cracking open package 200 along perforated line 216<br>
 <br>
and bending dispenser 170 in half via a fold line 218 to remove a comestible product 36 therefrom.<br>
[0178] Fig. 39 illustrates that perforated line 216 extends through sidewalls 210 and 212 so that when consumer 40 splits package 200 in half or in two, the split occurs not only along front wail 202 but along the sidewalls 210 and 212. Back wall 204 remains together but is folded along fold line 218.<br>
[0179] Products 36 can be loaded into package 200 in either the orientations illustrated in Fig. 38. Consumer 40 removes the products 36 from package 200 in the same manner as described above for package 170, removing one or more stick 36 via the dugout or cavity portion defined in each half by sinusoidal perforated line 216. When a product has been removed, the consumer closes the two portions of package 200 so that the edges defining line 216 are mated. Afterward, flap 214 is folded over line 216 to prevent the package from reopening between uses. To that end, flap 214 or front 202 can be provided with aa.amouitt of adhesive that helps flap 214 adhere or stick to front 202. Flap 214 and front 204 can alternatively be provided with a tongue and slot arrangement (illustrated in connection with Fig. 6), winch holds the package together frictionally and/or adhesively between uses.<br>
[0180] Package 200 is sized to hold fifteen sticks of comestible product 36 in one embodiment (e.g., seven sticks on one side of line 216 and eight on the other). Alternatively, package 200 can be sized to hoid a lesser or greater amount. In one embodiment, sticks 36 are tacked or glued to top wall 208 and bottom wall 206 to help hold the products in place. Glue strips, such as strips 84 (Fig. 11) may be used as can any combination of hot or cold glue.<br>
[0181] When initially packaged, package 200 can be wrapped by a suitable wrapper, such as a cellophane wrapper. That cellophane wrapper in one embodiment includes "a tear strip that also serves as a tamper evident device. As seen in Fig. 39, suitable indicia as described above is provided in various places on package 200.<br>
[01S2] Referring now to Figs. 40 to 46, a still another embodiment of the package and dispenser of the present invention is IHusfrated by package or dispenser 220. Package or dispenser 220 includes a cover 222 and a tray 224. Cover 222 as illustrated moves slidingly along tray 224 to expose one or more stack of comestible products 36. Cover 222 is generally a four-sided structure with a top 226, bottom 228 and sidewalls 230 and 232.  Sidewall 232 refers collectively to sidewali portions 232a<br>
 <br>
and 232b shown in Fig. 44. Sidewall portions 232a and 232b are glued or adhered together as indicated by adhesive 34 applied to the top side and bottom side, respectively, of sidewall portion 232a and 232b as seen in Fig. 44:<br>
[0IS3] Tray 224 is generally a three- or five-sided structure as seen respectively in Figs. 41 and 42 (showing three-sided) and 45 (showing five-sided). Tray 224 includes a bottom wall 234 and sidewalls 236 and 238. Fig. 45 illustrates that tray 224 can include additional top wall portions 240 and 242 that are bent over the top of the outer stacks of comestible products 36 to help hold those products in place. To that end, tack strips or glue strips 244 are provided on top wail portions 240 and 242 in one embodiment to help hold the comestible products 36 in place. Glue strips 244 can include any type of glue or adhesive described above. Glue can be applied directly to top wall portions 240 and 242 or be applied alternatively to a separate piece of paper 244, winch in turn is adhered to portions 240 and 242.<br>
- -   {Oir84] As seen in Figs. 42 and 44,- cover or sleeve 222 includes or defines.an. opening 246 in one embodiment that enables consumer 40 to readily slide tray 224 in and out of cover or sleeve 232.   Indeed, as seen in Fig. 41, opening 246 enables one-handed operation of package or dispenser 220.   As illustrated, opening 246 in one embodiment has an oval shape; however, opening 246 can have any desired shape.<br>
[0IS5] The relative sizes of sleeve 222 and tray 224 are selected so that consumer 40 can slide tray 224 in either direction against sleeve 222 to expose two product stacks and slide tray 224 from sleeve 222 in the opposite direction to expose the other stack of products 36. Sleeve 222 completely covers products 36 when the sleeve and tray are in registry. Nevertheless, products in the middle or center stack(s) are readily obtained. Package 220, like the other dispensers, exposes multiple stacks of products and enables consumer 40 to remove one or more products, selectively, from a desired and exposed stack. Further, dispenser 220 provides product access selectively from one or multiple open sides of the package.<br>
[0186] Fig. 40 illustrates a larger size package, winch in one embodiment includes three stacks of five sticks, totaling to the desired fifteen products 36. As before, the number of stacks can differ, the number of sticks in each stack can differ, and the-total number and size of products 36 can vary. Fig. 43 illustrates a smaller version, winch holds a lesser amount of product, e.g., five sticks 36. Figs. 40 and 43 both illustrate that sleeve 226 in one embodiment includes or defines a notch 248 that<br>
 <br>
also helps consumer 40 manipulate tray 224 witinn cover or sleeve 222. the packages are sized to hold any suitable amount of any suitably sized products.<br>
[0187] Figs. 41 and 46 illustrate that products 36 are individually provided in a foil wrapper. Each foil strip 36 is then placed inside an intermediate single stick wrapper 250. That is, an intermediate single strip wrpper 250 is provided for each foil-wrapped product 36. The single strip wrappers 250 are belly-banded together by a band 252. Band 252 is then adhered via adhesive 34 to a desirable location on bottom wall 234 of tray 224. Adhesive 34 can be any of the hot- or cold-type of adhesives described above. Adhesive strips similar to strips 244 may also be used.<br>
[0188] Belly band 252 is tightly wrapped about single strip wrappers 250 such that when consumer 40 pulls on one of the foil products 36, the product 36 is removed from single stick wrapper 250 as opposed to single stick wrapper 250 coming free from belly band 252. Additionally, a suitable adhesive or wax can be applied between single strip wrappers 250 and/or between-oneof more-of the outer single strip wrappers 250 and an inner surface of belly band 252.<br>
[0189] Product sticks 36 are arranged as illustrated in Figs. 41 and 42 so that the sticks slide through open ends of tray 224, winch open ends are oriented 90° from open ends of sleeve or cover 222. in that matter, products 36 cannot inadvertently slide out of package 220, Although not illustrated, package 220 can include one or more securing devices, e.g., tongue and slot, that prevents tray 222 from sliding inadvertently out of sleeve 222.<br>
[0190] As illustrated, package 220 includes any of the above-described indicia. Further, the package 220 is finally wrapped (not illustrated) by a suitable outer wrapper, such as cellophane. The outer wrapper in turn includes a tear strip winch also ser\'es as a tamper evident device,<br>
[0191] Figs. 47-49 illustrate a further embodiment of the present invention wherein package or dispenser 300 has a front wall 302, a rear wall 304, a bottom wall 306 and opposing sidewalls 308 and 310. The walls cooperate to define a package interior 312. Rear wall 304 includes a flap 314. Fold lines 316 and 318 enable flap 314 to move relative to the walls. For example, flap 314 may moved to overlap a portion of front wall 302. Flap 314 may be integral to or attached to rear wall 304. In an embodiment, flap 314 is integral to or is otherwise an extension of rear wall 304,<br>
 <br>
[0192] In an embodiment, package 300 may be made from a substrate 320 as shown in Fig. 49. Substrate 320 may be made of any foldable material as previously discussed {i.e., paper, cardboard, plastic or combinations thereof). Substrate 320 is substantially flat and has plurality of panels corresponding to the walls and flap of package 300. In an embodiment, substrate 320 is a plurality of panels that are integral to each other. It is underatood that adhesive 322 may be placed on tabs 324, 326, 328, 330, 332, 334 as necessary to maintain the panels of substrate 320 in the shape of package 300. Alternatively, the use of adhesive may be avoided by configuring tabs 324-334 in a tongue-and-slot arrangement as is commonly known in the art.<br>
[0193] Comestible product 36 may be loaded into package 300 in any of the orientations A (vertical), B (horizontal), or C (stacked) as shown in Fig. 48. In an embodiment, front wall 302 may include a die cut edge 335 that exposes the product and permits ready removal of the product from package 300.   In an embodiment,<br>
package 300 is-configured to hold about 15 sticks (three 5-stick packs) of comestible „	,<br>
product in orientation A. The skilled artisan will appreciate that the size of package 300 and the dimensions of package interior 312 may be varied as desired in order for package 300 to hold a lesser or a greater amount of product. Package 300 may be wrapped with an outer wrapper as previously discussed. Package 30 may also include labeling and advertising information as previously discussed.<br>
[0194] Front wall 302 includes a slot 336 and flap 314 includes a protruding member 338. Slot 336 and protruding member 338 are adapted for cooperative engagement with each other. Slot 336 may be disposed on front wall 302 in any suitable orientation to cooperatively receive protruding member 33 8. In an embodiment, slot 336 is a diagonally disposed or is otherwise offset on front wall 302 as shown in Figs. 47-49, Consequently, slot 336 may or may not be perpendicular to the bottom edge of front wall 302.<br>
[0195] To close contamer 300, flap 314 is moved to overlap front wall 302. The length of flap 314 may be adapted so that when flap 314 overlaps front wall 302, protruding member 338 is at substantially the same position as slot 336. Protruding member 338 is then slid along front wall 302 in a direction to enter slot 336, The sliding of flap 314 continues along front wall 302 until protruding member 338 is inserted into and matingly engages s)ot 336. The mated engagement between slot 336 and protruding member 338 securely retains the contents of package 300 witinn the<br>
 <br>
package interior. In an embodiment, a slit 340 disposed between flap 314 and protniding member 338 provides a friction fit between the protruding member, a slot edge 342 and the flap to hold the protruding member witinn slot 336 and keep package 300 closed.<br>
[0196] Package 300 may subsequently be opened by disengaging protruding member 338 from slot 336. Tins may be accomplished by sliding flap 314 along front wall 302 to move protruding member 338 away from slot 336. Once protruding member 338 is no longer in contact with slot 336, flap 314 may then be moved to expose the product to the consumer. The engagement and disengagement between the protruding member and the slot may be performed by a single hand of a user with relative ease,<br>
[0197] In an embodiment, at least one slot 336 may be disposed between a<br>
debossed area 344 and an embossed area 346, Alternatively, slot 336 may be disposed<br>
-	adjacent to either-one of debossed or embossed areas,344 and 346.   The surface.of<br>
debossed area 344 is lower than the surface of front wall 302 winle the surface of embossed area 346 is raised above the surface of front wall 302 as shown in Figs. 47-49. Areas 344 and 346 provide several, advantages. The lowered surface level of debossed area 344 provides a guide for protruding member 338 during the closing of package 300. When flap 314 is moved from an open position (i.e., exposure of the package interior) to a position overlapping front wall 302, protruding member 338 ahgns with debossed area 344. As the consumer slides flap 314 across the front wall, the recessed surface of debossed area 344 directs protruding member 338 into slot 336 for mated engagement,<br>
[0198] Embossed area 346 provides a space in winch protruding member may reside when inserted into slot 336. Provision of embossed area 346 thereby reduces the chance that the protruding member may interfere with the product and/or the wrapping of the product contained witinn package interior 312, The debossment-slot-embossment arrangement further contributes to the durability of the slot opening. The combination of the raised embossed area and the lowered debossed area provides a slot that endures repeated entry and exit of the protruding member without substantial degradation or reduction of the slot opening size. Tins enhances the integrity of the slot opening making package 300 well-suited for repeated use.<br>
 <br>
[0199] In an embodiment, the outline or outer perimeter 348 of areas 344 and 346 may define a geometric shape as shown in Figs. 48 and 49. Nonlimiting examples of geometric shapes suitable for outline 348 include a circle, an ellipse, a triangle, a square, a rectangle or a polygonal shape as desired. In an embodiment, the geometric shape is a circle as shown in Figs. 48 and 49. Outer edge 350 of protruding member 338 may be varied as desired to correspond to the geometrical shape of outline 348. For example, if the geometrical shape for outline 348 is a circle, outer edge 350 may be arcuate to cooperatively fit witinn embossed area 346. If the geometrical shape of outHne 348 is square, outer edge 350 may be substantially straight or a half-square shape to cooperatively fit under embossed area 346. The geometric shape may advantageously be used to draw attention to the cooperative engagement arrangement between the slot and protruding member. Geometric outline 348 may thereby draw consumer awareness to the reusability capability of package 300.<br>
[02QQ3-Eigs. 50-52 illustrate a further embodiment of the present invention ^_ _ wherein package or dispenser 300 has a body comprising a front wall 302, a rear wall 304, a bottom wall 306 and opposing sidewalls 308 and 310. The body includes a slot 336 and a flap 314 including a first portion 410 having a notch 400 adjacent the first portion, where the first portion 410 is engageable with the slot 336. Notch 400 makes engagement of the first portion 410 with the slot 336 easier, and reinforces the strength of the first portion 410.<br>
[0201] As discussed above, slot 336 may be disposed on the body in any suitable orientation to cooperatively receive first portion 410. Consequently, slot 336 may or may not be perpendicular to the bottom edge of the body. In an embodiment, as shown in Figs. 51 and 52, one or more notches or lips 402, 404 may be present adjacent to the slot. These lips aid in engagement of the first portion 410 with the slot 336, and additionally make the package resistant to tear. Additionally optional is a slit 406, preferably perpendicular to the slot 336. Slit 336 likewise aids in engagement of the protruding member 338 with the slot 336.<br>
[0202] Fig. 53 illustrates a further embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 53, the package or dispenser 300 has a body comprising a front wall 302, a rear wall 304, a bottom wall (not shown) and opposing sidewalls. The body includes a multi-segmented slot 500 and a flap 314 including a first portion 410. The first portion 410 is engageable with the mulfi-segmented slot 500,   Optionally present is are a debossed<br>
 <br>
area 344 and an embossed area 346, discussed above. One or more slits (not shown) or notches (not shown) may additionally be present, as discussed above.<br>
[0203] FIGS. 54-6i illustrate further embodiments of the present invention. As illustrated in FIG. 54, a package 401 is provided winch may include a front wall 412, a rear wall 417, a bottom wall 418, and opposing sidewalls 408, 411. The walls define a package interior. The front wall 412 may include a slot 532. A movable flap 413 may extend from the rear wall 417 and may include a protruding member 420. The movable flap 413 may be adapted to move relative to the walls 408, 411, 412 and 417. The protmding member 420 may be inserted into the slot 532 to enclose the package interior. In an embodiment, the package 401 may be configured to be portable and sized to fit in the palm of a hand and/or a pocket.<br>
[0204] In an embodiment, the flap 413 may be integral with or otherwise be an<br>
extension ofthe rear wall 417. The package 401 may be made of any foldable material<br>
	as discussed above.   The package 401 may be made-from a unitary piece or may be<br>
made from a plurality of panels that are connected to one another.  In an embodiment,<br>
the package 401 may be made from paperboard or the like.<br>
[0205] As discussed above, the slot 532 may be disposed on the front wall 412 in any suitable orientation to cooperatively receive the protruding member 338. For example, the slot 532 can be diagonally disposed on the front wall 412 so that it is non-parallel to a bottom edge 414 ofthe front wall 412. In another example, theslot may be disposed on the front wall 412 so that it may be parallel to an edge of the side walls 408, 411. In an embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 54, the slot may be offset or rotated at an acute angle with respect to a center axis 550. Tins angle requires the package to be closed using two directions, as desired, yet enables the consumer to close the package using fluid motions and only one hand. In another embodiment, tins angle may be less than or equal to 45 degrees. In other words, the slot may be diagonally disposed at a steep incline with respect to the bottom edge 414 ofthe front wall 412. In another embodiment, the slot 532 may be positioned to one side of the front wall 412 and towards either sidewall 40S, 411 so that the slot 532 does not intersect the center axis 550. In yet another embodiment, the slot 532 may be both diagonally disposed (i.e. offset) and located to a side of the front wall 412.<br>
[0206] As illustrated in FIG, 54, the slot 532 may define a first slot portion 509 and a second slot portion 510. The slot 532 lies in the plane of the front wall 412 and<br>
 <br>
extends into a straight line along the front wall 412. In an embodiment, tins straight line separates the first slot portion 509 from the second slot portion 510. In other words, the first slot portion 509 is an area of the front wall 412 to a first side of the slot 532 and the second slot portion 510 is an area of the front wall 412 to a second side of the slot 532.<br>
[0207] In an embodiment, the first slot portion 509 extends across the front wall<br>
412 towards at an outer perimeter 511. In another embodiment, the second slot portion<br>
510 extends across the front wall 412 towards an outer perimeter 512. In a further<br>
embodiment, the first and second slot portions are adjacent to each other and cooperate<br>
to define a single region surroumding the slot. Tins region may form a common or<br>
continuous outline. The outline may define any shape including such non-limiting<br>
examples as a circle, an ellipse, an ovoid or egg shape, and a polygon such as a triangle,<br>
square, or rectangle. As shown in FIG. 54, the outline (shape of 511 with 512) may<br>
define an ovoid or egg shape, ..	.	. _<br>
[0208] In another embodunent, the fu^st slot portion 509 can partially house a portion of the protruding member 420 beneath it when the package 401 is closed. The protruding member 420 may also lay substantially flat beneath the first slot portion 509. The protruding member 420 may enter the slot 532 under the first slot portion 509 and over the second slot portion 510. The protruding member 420 may be inserted into the slot 532 to enclose the package interior. In another embodiment, the protruding member 420 may include a tip 416 on an outer edge. A portion of the outer edge may correspond with the shape of the outer perimeter 511 of the first slot portion 509.<br>
[0209] As illustrated in FIG. 54, the front wall 412 may include a cut-out area 530 defined by the slot 532. The cut-out area 530 may be any shape including such non-limiting examples as a biconvex lens or football shape, an ellipse, a circle, a semicircle, a semiellipse, a crescent, and a polygon such as a triangle, square, or rectangle. In an embodiment, the cut-out area 530 may be located at a midpoint of the slot 532. In an alternate embodiment, the cut-out area 530 may be located towards either end of the slot 532. In another embodiment, the cut-out area extends over or across both the first and second slot portions 509 and 510. In other words, the cut-out area 530 may cut into regions of the first and second slot portions 509, 510.<br>
[0210] In an embodiment best illustrated in FIGS. 55 and 57, a gap 545 is formed simultaneously with the cut-out area.530 and is located between the first and<br>
 <br>
second slot portions 509, 510. The gap 545 may measure a distance between two distalmost ends of the cut-out area 530. Thus, the length of the gap 545 spreads apart the first slot portion 509 and the second slot portion 510, The gap 545 may be oriented perpendicularly to the slot 532. The gap 545 may have a length that is at least equal to the tinckness of the protruding member 420. In an embodiment, the gap 545 has a length of about 5 millimeters.<br>
[0211] The cut-out area 530, alone or in combination with the gap 545, is constructed and arranged to facilitate entry of the protruding member 420 witinn the slot 532. In other words, the cut-out area 530 creates a space for a tip 416 of the protruding member 420 to enter or weave between the first and second slot portions 509, 510. Inside the cut-out area 530 and witinn the gap 545, the tip 416 may penetrate the front wall 412 and slide underneath the first slot portion 509. Therefore, the cut-out area 530 and the gap 545 may act in concert with one another to furnish an opening for .. the protruding member to case between the first slot portion 509 and the second slot portion 510.<br>
[0212] The region of cut-out area 530 extending across (i.e. cut into) the second slot portion 510 provides enough space for the tip 416 to penetrate the fiont wall 412. In other words, the tip 416 is afforded enough space witinn tins region to dive beneath or dip under a plane of the second slot portion 510 ahead of the first slot portion 509. Thus, extending the cut-out area 530 across the second slot portion 510 permits the protruding member 420 to maneuver between the first and second slot portions by penetrating the front wall 412.<br>
[0213] The region of the cut-out area 530 extending across (i.e. cut into) the first slot portion 510 pennits the protruding member 420 to skim underneath the first slot portion 510, In other words, tins region permits varying edges of the fu-st slot portion 510 to progressively glide or float over an exterior side of the protruding member 420 as the protruding member 420 enters the slot 532. Tins way, the protruding member 420 may slide undemeath the first slot portion 509 little by little and may not directly collide with the first slot portion 509.<br>
[0214] In an embodiment, the first slot portion 509 may extend in an outward direction away from the package interior. As tins occurs, the length of the gap 545 may increase as the firs: slot portion 509 extends away from the plane of the front wall 412.<br>
 <br>
In other words, the length of the gap 545 may extend or increase in an outward direction with the first slot portion 509.<br>
[0215] in another embodiment, the second slot portion 510 may extend in an inward direction towards the package interior. As tins occurs, the length of the gap 545 may increase as the second slot portion 510 extends away from the plane of the front wall 412. In other words, the length of the gap 545 may extend or increase in an inward direction with the second slot portion 510.<br>
[0216] In a further embodiment, both the first and second slot portions may extend away from the plane of the fixmt wall 412 simultaneously. When tins occurs, the length of the gap 545 may increase with both the first and second slot portions 509, 510 by distances 546 and 548 as shown in FIG. 59 or by any distance therebetween. In yet another embodiment, the gap 545 may increase by a distance to acineve a total length of about 8 millimeters.<br>
[0217] In an embodirnent, the first slot portion 509 may outwardly extend from the front wall 412 to form an embossed surface "E". The embossed surface "E" extends from aside 516 of the slot 532 along the front wall 412. In an embodiment, the embossed surface "E" may be coextensive with the first slot portion 509. As shown in FIG. 59, or a cross-sectional view of the front wall 412 taken along line 59-59, the embossed surface "E" may be formed to place the first slot portion 509 ingher than the front wall 412. It is understood that embossing the first slot portion 509 may extend or increase the length of the gap 545 by a portion of the distance 546 measuring between the front wall 412 and the embossed surface "E". In other words, forming an embossed surface "E" may extend the length of the gap 545 in an outward direction with respect to the front wall 412, Thus, the length of the gap 545 may be increased to permitthe protruding member 420 to readily slide into the slot 532 and underneath the first slot portion 509.<br>
[0218] In yet another embodiment, the second slot portion 510 may inwardly extend from the front wall 412 to form a debossed surface "D". The debossed surface "D" extends from a side 518 of the slot 532 along the front wall 412. In an embodiment, the debossed surface "D" may be coextensive with the second slot portion 510.

 <br>
portion 510 may extend or increase the length of the gap 545 by a portion of the distance 546 measuring between the front wall 412 and the debossed surface "D". In other words, forming a debossed surface "D" may extend the length of the gap 545 in an inward direction with respect to the front wall 412. Thus, the length of the gap 545 may be increased to permit the protruding member 420 to readily slide into the slot 532 and underneath the first slot portion 509.<br>
[0219] It should also be understood that the front wall 412 may include both an embossed surface "E" and a debossed surface "D", as shown in FIGS. 59 and 61. In tins embodiment, forming both embossed and debossed surfaces "E", "D" increases the length of the gap 545 in an outward and inward direction respectively by a distance 546 as shown in FIG. 59. Tins distance 546 spreads apart the first and second slot portions 509, 510 to permit the protruding member 420 to readily slide into the slot 532.<br>
[0220] In an embodiment, the embossed surface "E" may be raised, bulged, ■ molded stretched, ridged, creased, shaped, elevated, or otherwise treated, or formed from a portion of the front wall 412 in a way to place the embossed surface "E" above the second slot portion 510 and/or above the front wall 412. In another embodiment, the debossed surface "D" may be lowered, molded, stretched, shaped, indented, creased, pushed, or otherwise treated or formed from a portion of the front wall 412 in a way to place the debossed surface "D" below the first slot portion 510 and/or above the front wall 412.<br>
[0221] In an embodiment, the second slot portion 510 may also include a slit 540 extending from the slot 532. The slit 540 permits the second slot portion 510 to extend away from the plane of the front wall 412 when the second slot portion is pressed inward towards the package interior. Thus, the slit 540 may permit the length of the gap 545 to further increase with the second slot portion 510. In an embodiment, the slit 540 enables a debossed second slot portion 510 to extend away from the front wall 412 and from an embossed surface "E" when the flap 413 enters the slot 532 (shown in phantom in FIG. 59). in tins embodiment, the length of the gap 545 is further increased by a distance 548 as shown in FIG. 59. in an embodiment, the slit 540 may extend perpendicularly from the cut-out area 530.<br>
[0222] The slot 532 may include a first slot end (near 534) and a second slot end (near 538). In an embodiment, a lip 534 may extend from a first slot end as shown in FIG. 54.   In an embodiment, the lip 534 may be curved in a direction towards the<br>
 <br>
second slot portion 510. The Up 534 may enable the second slot portion 510 to extend away from the plane of the front waI1412 when the second slot portion 510 is pressed inward towards the package interior. In an embodiment, the Up 534 may permit the debossed second slot portion 510 to extend in an inward direction (shown in phantom in FIG. 59). Thus, the lip 534 may also permit the length of the gap 545 to further increase with the second slot portion 510 by a distance 548 as shown in FIG. 59.<br>
[0223] The protruding member 420 may include a locking edge 440 on its perimeter as shown in FIG. 54. The locking edge 440 may engage the lip 534 to secure the protruding member 420 in the slot. When the package is frilly closed, the locking edge 440 may matingly engage the lip 534 in an interlocking manner, as shown in FIG. 60. The Up 534 may limit the movement of the protruding member 420 as the protruding member 420 engages the slot 532. Thus, a locking connection may prevent the flap 413 from uncovering the package interior and may also prevent accidental loss of comestible product. The connection may also, provide a friction fit to secure the. -protruding member 420 witinn the slot 532. In an embodiment, the Up 534 may bend around the locking edge 440. The bend may prevent tearing at an end of the slot. In another embodiment, the protruding member 420 may be enlarged in size to add structural integrity to the movable flap 413 when the flap is secured in mating engagement witinn the slot 532. Furthermore, lengthening the locking edge 440 may enhance the locking connection with the lip 534.<br>
[0224] As shown in FIG. 54, an end of the locking edge 440 may include a notch 430, The notch 430 may permit the protruding member 420 to flex away from a plane of the movable flap 413. Also, the notch 430 may prevent tearing at the locking edge 440. In another embodiment, the notch 430 cooperatively engages the Up 534, as shown in FIG. 60. The notch 430 may also provide a stopping point for the locking edge 440 as the protruding member engages the slot. Tins way, the locking edge may not continually tear into the flap 413 along an edge 450 after repeated insertion of the protruding member 420 into the slot 532.<br>
[0225] In another embodiment, a second Up 538 may extend from a second end of the slot. The second lip 538 may be bent similarly to the first lip 534. In an embodiment, both lips 534, 538 may be bent to form a U-shape with the slot 532. Tins U-shape enables the second slot portion 510 to be pressed inward towards the package interior,  increasing the  length of the  gap  545.     Thus,  the  lips  534,  538  may<br>
 <br>
cooperatively permit the length of the gap 545 to further increase by a distance 548 as the second slot portion 510 is pressed inward, as shown in FIG. 59. It should also be understood that the first lip 534 and the second lip 538 may be curved to create an S-shape with the slot.<br>
[0226] As previously discussed, the comestible product 36 may be placed into the package 401 of FIG. 54 in any orientation (vertical, horizontal, or stacked). As shown in an embodiment in FIG. 48, comestible products 36 may be placed in the package in three 5-stick packs. In another embodiment (not shown), comestible products 36 may be placed in the package 401 in a row where the stick faces are aligned parallel to the sidewalls 408, 411, The sidewalls 408 and 411 may be opposing or parallel in nature, allowing the package 401 to grow in capacity according to the width of the sidewalls. Furthermore, ahgning the sidewalls 408, 411 parallel to each other provides a secure and enclosed interior for the comestible products.<br>
—[0227] In yet another embodiment (not shown), the product may be arranged in . . _ , . a stack that is at least two products deep and wrapped in such an arrangement to retain the products against lateral movement witinn the package. The stack may be wrapped in a sheet as disclosed in commonly-owned co-pending patent application entitled "Package for Elongate Comestible Products and Methods of Making and Using Same", Attorney Docket No. 0112703-01092, concurrently filed herewith and winch is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
