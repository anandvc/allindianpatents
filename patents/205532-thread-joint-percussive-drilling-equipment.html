Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a thread joint and in particular to a thread joint for percussive drilling and also to a method of manufacturing of such thread joint<br>
Prior Art<br>
In a conventional thread joint between two components in a rock drilling equipment for percussive drilling one normally uses cut male and female threads, see for example SE-B-469,602. At manufacturing of such a male thread a blank of steel is fomed, which comprises a thick part which ends connect to a clearance surface or a clearance groove with less diameter for to receive at least portions of the threading tool and to a often conical free end. Subsequently, the tool's lateral and longitudinal feed are coordinated with the rotational movement of the thick portion such as to generate the thread in a conventional manner during at least one pass. Sharp edges are formed at the entrance and exit of the thread due to the geometry's of the clearance groove and the free end surface. Corresponding sharp edges are formed at threading of a female thread. The shart edges makes the male and female threads damaging each other foremost at the free end of the respective drilling element during mounting and dismounting of the joint. In addition, the threads are case hardened and the sharp edges become hardened too much such that the sharp edges define the area for the deepest case depth of the thread. Results from the hardening show cracking and fatigue in these areas during drilling, and therefore the lifespan of the joint becomes relatively short. Another conventional thread joint between two components in a rock drilling equipment for percussive drulling and experience cracking is shown in EP-A2-220 147 wherein the thread end is cut away to maintain a full thread profile to the end of the thread.<br><br>

The objects of the invention are realized by a thread joint, a male portion, a female portion and a method for manufacturing a threaded product. Below, one embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to the drawings wherein,<br>
FIG. 1 shows a cross-section of an end of a female portion according to the present invention;<br>
FIGS. 2A and 2B show an end of a male portion according to the present invention in a side<br>
view;<br>
FIG. 3 shows a partly sectioned view of a thread joint according to the invention; FIG. 4 shows an end view of the male portion;<br>
FIGS. 5A-5D show various cross-sections of a threaded component; and FIG. 6 shows all of the cross sections of FIGS. 5B-5D superimposed onto one another.<br>
DETAILED   DESCRIPTION   OF   A   PREFERRED   EMBODIMENT   OF   THE   INVENTION<br>
The drill rod 10 for percussive drilling shown in FIGS. 1, 2A and 2B is provided at one end with a sleeve-shaped part or a female portion 11 according to the present.<br><br>
invention at one end having a female thread or internal thread 12. The female portion 11 constitutes an integral part of the drill rod 10. At the other end the drill rod 10 is formed with a spigot or male portion 13 according to the present invention equipped with a male thread or external thread 14. The drill rod further has a through-going flush channel 15, through which a flush medium, generally air or water, is conducted. The female portion 11 bottom forms a ring-shaped abutment surface 16, which at mounting of two drill rods 10 is intended to abut against a corresponding annular abutment surface 17 at the free end of the shank 13 of the other drill rod.<br>
In Figs. 4 and 5A-5D are shown an end view of the male portion and different cross-sections I-IV of an entrance thread 30 and a finished full profile thread in shape of a trapezoidal thread 14A. The thread end 30 has a more rounded cross-section than the full profile thread 14A. The cross-sections I-IV are taken with 90°:s partition and towards the center exis CL of the male portion. At the section I according to Fig. 5A, here taken as reference at 0°, the threading tool does not reach the envelope surface of the thick part of the steel body and the entrance thread still has not started to be cut but instead is provided an end surface 18 only, which is defined by a straight line in the section I. The end surface 18 is usually conical. The entrance thread 30 describes at the section II according to Fig. 5B, at 90°:s difference from the section I counter-clockwise, a path which resembles a bell curve or the cross section of a symmetrical ridge has a smallest radius R1 which is bigger than 0.2 mm and a height h1. The entrance thread 30 comprises substantially identical flanks 30A and 30B. In the section according to Fig. 5C, at 90°:s difference from the section II counterclockwise, the cross-sectional area has grown further, whereby the ridge and the flanks have a smallest radius R2 which is bigger than 0.2 mm and a height h2. In Fig. 5D according to the section I, i.e. 360° from the above-described section I the entrance thread has entirely surpassed into a full profile thread or finished trapezoidal thread 14A with a smallest radius R3 that is bigger than 0.2 mm and a height h3. The full profile thread 14A has substantially identical  14B and 14C. It can be seen from Figs. 5A-5D that both the cross-<br><br>
4<br>
sectional area and the height of the entrance thread 30 increase from the start between the sections I and II circumferentially to the finished thread 14A while the sma/fest radius R1-R3 is not less than 0.2 mm. In case the finished thread is a trapezoidal thread 14A then the smallest radius R2 of the entrance thread 30 in the section ill is greater than the smallest radius R3 of the trapezoidal thread 14A. Since sharp edges do not exist at entrances and exits 30 of the thread 14 the hardening depth at heat-treatment, for example case hardening, becomes essentially constant along the entire thread, and therefor cracks and fatigue is avoided in these areas. At conventional cut threads one of the thread flanks at the thread end always has the same profile as the full profile thread except for being somewhat lower while both thread flanks 30A, 30B of the current thread end 30 have profiles which differ from the profile of the connected flanks 14B and 14C, respectively, of the full profile thread 14A, see Figs. 5B and 5D. Preferably there are provided two entrances and two exits at the thread ends.<br>
A corresponding soft profile is attained at the entrances and exits of the female thread 12.<br>
When the threaded connection, Fig. 3, of two drill rods 10 according to the present invention is mounted, the free end of the male portion 13 will enter at the area of the free end of the female portion. In most cases the rods must be rotated relative to each other during insertion such that the threads can come into engagement with each other. Before threading starts the soft thread ends prevent that the rods damage each other. Subsequently, the rods can be rotated until the front surface 17 of the rod abuts against the bottom 16. The full profile threads 12 and 14 are designed in a conventional manner such that when they have been mounted abutment arises only at the straight flank portions 14B and the corresponding flanks at the female portion. Consequently, contact between curved parties or between peaks and bottoms do not occur. At<br>
leats the thread joint according to the present invention has exhibited at least doubled tool life compared to conventional thread joints.<br><br>
Turning of the thread 12 or 14 is made in the following manner. In a conventional manner the lateral and longitudinal feed and cutting depth of the tool is co-ordinated with the rotational movement of the thick portion such that a thread is generated during at least one passage. This is attained by a thread master or via a threading program in a lathe. Having the threading tool deciding the thread profile substantially without being influenced by connecting clearances thereby attains soft entrances and exits at the thread ends. Subsequently at least the cut thread is heat treated for example through case hardening.<br>
Conceivable modifications of the invention<br>
Alternatively, the rod is provided in the shape of a drill tube and can also comprise shoulder abutment of the type that is illustrated in US-A-4,968,068 which hereby is incorporated into the description, in the shown embodiment a trapezoidal thread is shown but it is implicit that the invention can be utilized for all rock drilling threads, such as for example rope threads. The female portion or the male portion may alternatively be integrated with a rock drill bit instead of with a drill rod or a drill rod. The principles of the invention can be applied also at a thread joint between a shank adapter and the drill rod and between two drill rods with a loose threaded sleeve.<br>
Also in other respects the invention can be freely varied within the scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
