In another aspect, the invention provides processes for preparation of compounds of the formula I and intermediates used in the preparation thereof.<br>
The process for preparation of compounds of the general formula I comprises:<br>
The compounds of formula IE with a compound of formula IF<br><br>
wherein R , Rz, R , R and R~ are defined as previous, are reacted in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane and toluene and the like to produce the compounds of formula ID, <br>
ID Wherein R1, R2, R3, R4 and Rb are defined as previous.<br><br>
This reaction is carried out in the presence of an organic base such as tertiary amine, pyridine as a catalyst as well<br>
as an acid neutralizer at -20°C to 80°C.<br>
And then compounds of formula IA may be obtained by heating compounds of formula ID in an acidic aqueous solution, generally phosphoric acid aqueous solution:<br><br>
Wherein R1, R4-, R3, R4 and R5 are as previously defined.<br>
And then the compounds of formula I is obtained by a cyclization reaction of compounds of formula IA :<br><br>
Wherein R1, R2, R3, R4 and Rs are defined as previous.<br>
The cyclization reaction is similar to a convent: i ona.l method known for synthesis of pyrimidone. The reaction may<br><br>
be carried out by reflux in an appropriate solution under acidic, basic or neutral condition. Preferably using alkali metal salts of alcohol or amine, or an organic base, and ethanol as a solvent. Thus, for example, the cyclization reaction is carried out by refluxing in ethanol and in the presence of potassium tert-butoxide or sodium ethoxide.<br>
Also, compounds of formula I may be obtained directly by cyclization reaction of corresponding compounds of the formula ID.<br>
Generally, this reaction is carried out by heating the formula ID in a mixture of P2O5, water and tertiary amine,<br>
especially dimethyleyelohexylamine at 10CTC to 300"C .<br>
In an alternative procedure, the reaction may be carried out at room temperature or by heating in an alka line hydrogen peroxide water solution, for example a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and urea.<br>
The said reaction may also be carried out at room temperature or by heating under anhydrous or hydrous acidic-conditions generally using hydrochloric acid.<br>
The specific example of compounds of formula I wherein R' is S02NRI1Rlz' may be prepared by following process.<br>
Compounds of formula IC can be readily prepared from compounds of the formula IF and the IE wherein RJ i s H,<br><br><br>
wherein R1, R2, RJ and R4 are defined as previous.<br>
And then compounds of the formula IB are prepared by the reaction of compounds of the formula IC with chlorosulfonic acid:<br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 are defined as previous.<br>
The reaction is generally carried out by heating the formula IC in the presence of an excess amount of chlorosulf onic acid. Also, the said reaction may be performed in solvent, of dichloromethane, chloroform, and other inert or polar, non-proton solvents. In particular when the reactant has a poor solubility in chlorosulfonic acid, using above-mentioned solvents seem to be more important. The reaction can be carried out at the temperature as high ay<br><br>
100°C without producing any by-products, but generally in ice bath.<br>
Acylation reaction is carried out by reacting the compounds of the formula IB with proper amines to obtain the compounds of formula I wherein R5 is SC^NR^R"12, and R11, R1'" are defined as previous.<br>
The said acylation reaction may be performed in the solvents of dichloromethane, chloroform, tertiary amine and other<br>
inert or polar non-proton solvents at -78°C to 100°C using<br>
equal or excess amounts of amines. The excess amount of amine is used not only as a reactant, but also a solvent.<br>
Either, compounds of the formula I are prepared by reacting formula IG with compounds of formula IH, compound IG is compound I wherein R3 is H:<br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R4 and R5 are defined as previous,<br><br>
wherein X represents Cl, Br or I; RJ is defined as previous.<br><br>
The said reactions are carried out by heating reflux in the solvents of non-polar proton solvents with organic or non-organic base as catalyst, generally alkali carbonate such as potassium carbonate in ketone solvents such as acetone.<br>
Optionally, compounds of the formula I can be converted into the corresponding salts by reacting with pharmaceutically acceptable acids.<br>
The intermediates of formula IE are prepared from corresponding aromatic carboxylic acid that .1 y commercially available and thionyl chloride, oxalyl chloride by conventional synthesis method, of acyl chloride.<br>
If using oxalyl chloride, the reaction should be carried out in the non-proton solvents such as dichloromethane,<br>
chloroform, toluene etc. at the temperature of -10°C to 60<br>
°C for 2-10 hours using an equal or excess (no more than<br>
4 fold) amount of oxalyl chloride in the presence of 0.0.S-1 equivalent of dimethyIformamide as a catalyst. The said reaction solutions may be directly used in the preparation of the formula ID or distilled under the reduced pressure to prepare the purified compounds.<br>
If using thionyl chloride, the reaction should be performed in the non-proton solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, toluene etc., or the thionyl chloride itsel.f: is used as solvent, and better, under the conditions of<br><br>
reflux for 0.5-3 hours. The obtained solutions may be directly used in the preparation of the formula ID, or distilled under the reduced pressure to prepare the purified compounds.<br>
Intermediates of the formula IF used may be synthesized readily from malononitrile and correspondingly substituted 2-aminoketones by conventional synthetic procedures in accordance with literatures described below:<br>
Wiley R.H., etal, J Am. Chem. Soc, 1948. 70, 2005; Johnson<br>
R.W. etal, J Heterocyclic Chem. 1997, 14, 383; and Wamhof f H.et al, Synthesis 1976, 51.<br>
The reaction may be carried out in water in the presence of alkali metal hydroxide such as potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide etc. as the catalyst at the temperature<br>
of 4 °C to 60 °C . The reaction solution is diluted and<br>
filtrated, and dried to obtain the product. If the 1ow water-soluble substituted 2-aminoketones is used, the reaction may be carried out either in two phases of both water and organic reagents in the presence of phase transfer catalysts, or in organic solvents in the presence of nitrogenous organic base such as pyridine, triethyl ami ne as catalyst. The resulting compounds can be purlfied by recrystallization.<br>

Experiments of penis erection<br>
In order to demonstrate efficacy of the compounds of formula I in treatment of functional impotence, the penis erection experiment was established by using the male rabbit as experimental model cross reference to Bischoff's method. (Bischoff E. ; Schneider K, International Journal of Impotence Research, 2 0 01, 13, 2 30-2 35)<br>
The	hydrochloride	, of<br>
3,7-dihydropyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-one derivatives was<br>
dissolved into water*  and injected to conscious-rabbits<br>
intravenously (i.v.) (0.lmg-3mg/kg). Erection was accessed by comparing the length of penis before and at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after intravenous administration of the above-mentioned agents. The results of typica1 compounds in this erectile experiment were listed in table;<br><br><br><br>

Experiments of the effect of single administration on the coitus function of male rats<br>
After purchasing, the male rat and the estrogenized female rat were kept in the same cage for 2 days, and the male rat would acquire the sexual experiences. Then, the female rat was taken out of the cage, and the experiments began after the male rat stayed alone in a cage for 5 days. Each tested compound was orally administered in a dosage of 24mg/kg, the positive group was administered with Sildenafi1 citrate(Viagra) in a dosage of 2 4mg/kg, and the control group was administered with saline at the equal volume<br>
( 0.lml/lOg ) . Fifty minutes after administration, the<br>
tested male rats were placed within a observation container (both the diameter and the height of the container were 2 4cm) , and the male rats adapted the new environment for 5 minutes. After that, two estrogenized female rats were placed into the container. The sexual behavior of the male rats in 20 minutes was observed under the non-interfering condition using Panasonic WVCP410/G monitor, the latent-period of straddle, times of straddle, as well as the latent period of the coitus and times of the coitus. All the<br>
experiments were carried out at 21-24° C, and completed<br><br>
before 11:00 AM. The comparative results among the compounds of the invention, the blank and the positive control drug Sildenafil citrate were listed in Table 2.<br>
The experimental results showed that all the indexes of sexual function of the rats were obviously enhanced after they were administered with compound 1-HC1, namely, the latent period of straddle and coitus were remarkably shortened, and the times of the coitus was obviously increased. And the effect of the compound 1-HCl was stronger than that of the Sildenafil citrate group, especially, the times of the coitus was much more than that of the positive control group(p

The bioactivity inhibiting phosphodiesterase of compounds of formula I<br>
The bioactivity inhibiting phosphodiesterase 5 (PDES) of compounds of formula 1 was measured cross the reference of methods (Hidaka H, et al Biochirn. Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1976, 429, 485; Kim D-K, et al. , Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2001, 9, 3013) . The inhibiting activity of PDE5 was deterrni ned using SPA technique and the method of chemical fluorescence. The method was as follows: firstly, the reaction time curve and the enzyme concentration curve of PDES reaction system were determined by Microplate Scintillation &amp; Luminescence-Counter (TopCount Counter) , by which the optimal reaction condition was determined. Under the optimized conditions, the inhibition experiments on PDES were carried out.The results showed that compound I had stronger inhibiting rate on phosphodiesterase 5 than that of sildenafil. For example, when the concentration of compound 1-HC1 was 10~Bmol/L, the inhibiting rate of compound 1-HC1 on PDES was 65.62%, but the inhibiting rate of sildenaf11 on PDE5 was 31.67% .<br><br><br><br>
