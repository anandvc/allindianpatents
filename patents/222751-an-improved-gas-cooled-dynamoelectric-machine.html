				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a structure for enhancing cooling of<br>
generator rotors through surface profiling of the copper end turns and/or<br>
spaceblocks.<br>
The power output rating of dynamoelectric machines, such as large<br>
turbo-generators, is often limited by the ability to provide additional current<br>
through the rotor field winding because of temperature limitations imposed on<br>
the electrical conductor insulation. Therefore, effective cooling of the rotor<br>
winding contributes directly to the output capability of the machine. This is<br>
especially true of the rotor end region, where direct, forced cooling is difficult<br>
and expensive due to the typical construction of these machines. As<br>
prevailing market trends require higher efficiency and higher reliability in lower<br>
cost, higher-power density generators, cooling the rotor end region becomes<br>
a limiting factor.<br>
Turbo-generator rotors typically consist of concentric rectangular coils<br>
mounted in slots in a rotor. The end portions of the coils (commonly referred<br>
to as endwindings), which are beyond the support of the main rotor body, are<br>
typically supported against rotational forces by a retaining ring (see FIGURE<br>
1). Support blocks are placed intermittently between the concentric coil<br>
endwindings to maintain relative position and to add mechanical stability for<br>
axial loads, such as thermal loads (see FIGURE 2). Additionally, the copper<br>
coils are constrained radially by the retaining ring on their outer radius, which<br>
counteracts centrifugal forces. The presence of the spaceblocks and<br>
retaining ring results in a number of coolant regions exposed to the copper<br>
coils. The primary coolant path is axial between the spindle and the bottom of<br>
the endwindings. Also, discrete cavities are formed between coils by the<br>
bounding surfaces of the coils, blocks and the inner surface of the retaining<br>
ring structure. The endwindings are exposed to coolant that is driven by<br>
rotational forces from radially below the endwindings into these cavities (see<br>
FIGURE 3). This heat transfer tends to be low. This is because according to<br>
computed flow pathlines in a single rotating end winding cavity from a<br>
computational fluid dynamic analysis, the coolant flow enters the cavity,<br>
traverses through a primary circulation and exits the cavity. Typically, the<br>
circulation result in low heat transfer coefficients especially near the center of<br>
the cavity. Thus, while this is a means for heat removal in the endwindings, it<br>
is relatively inefficient.<br>
Various schemes have been used to route additional cooling gas<br>
through the rotor end region. All of these cooling schemes rely on either (1)<br>
making cooling passages directly in the copper conductors by machining<br>
grooves or forming channels in the conductors, and then pumping the gas to<br>
some other region of the machine, and/or (2) creating regions of relatively<br>
higher and lower pressures with the addition of baffles, flow channels and<br>
pumping elements to force the cooling gas to pass over the conductor<br>
surfaces.<br>
Some systems penetrate the highly stressed rotor retaining ring with<br>
radial holes to allow cooling gas to be pumped directly alongside the rotor<br>
endwindings and discharged into the air gap, although such systems can<br>
have only limited usefulness due to the high mechanical stress and fatigue life<br>
considerations relating to the retaining ring.<br>
If the conventional forced rotor end cooling schemes are used,<br>
considerable complexity and cost are added to rotor construction. For<br>
example, directly cooled conductors must be machined or fabricated to form<br>
the cooling passages. In addition, an exit manifold must be provided to<br>
discharge the gas somewhere in the rotor. The forced cooling schemes<br>
require the rotor end region to be divided into separate pressure zones, with<br>
the addition of numerous baffles, flow channels and pumping elements -<br>
which again add complexity and cost.<br>
If none of these forced or direct cooling schemes are used, then the<br>
rotor endwindings are cooled passively. Passive cooling relies on the<br>
centrifugal and rotational forces of the rotor to circulate gas in the blind, dead-<br>
end cavities formed between concentric rotor windings. Passive cooling of<br>
rotor endwindings is sometimes also called "free convection" cooling.<br>
Passive cooling provides the advantage of minimum complexity and<br>
cost, although heat removal capability is diminished when compared with the<br>
active systems of direct and forced cooling. Any cooling gas entering the<br>
cavities between concentric rotor windings must exit through the same<br>
opening since these cavities are otherwise enclosed - the four "side walls" of<br>
a typical cavity are formed by the concentric conductors and the insulating<br>
blocks that separate them, with the "bottom" (radially outward) wall formed by<br>
the retaining ring that supports the endwindings against rotation. Cooling gas<br>
enters from the annular space between the conductors and the rotor spindle.<br>
Heat removal is thus limited by the low circulation velocity of the gas in the<br>
cavity and the limited amount of the gas that can enter and leave these<br>
spaces.<br>
In typical configurations, the cooling gas in the end region has not yet<br>
been fully accelerated to rotor speed, that is, the cooling gas is rotating at part<br>
rotor speed. As the fluid is driven into a cavity by means of the relative<br>
velocity impact between the rotor and the fluid, the heat transfer coefficient is<br>
typically highest near the spaceblock that is downstream relative to the flow<br>
direction - where the fluid enters with high momentum and where the fluid<br>
coolant is coldest. The heat transfer coefficient is also typically high around<br>
the cavity periphery. The center of the cavity receives the least cooling.<br>
Increasing the heat removal capability of passive cooling systems will<br>
increase the current carrying capability of the rotor providing increased rating<br>
capability of the generator whole maintaining the advantage of low cost,<br>
simple and reliable construction.<br>
U.S. Patent No.,5.644,-1-79, the disclosure of which is incorporated by<br>
reference, describes a method for augmenting heat transfer by increasing the<br>
flow velocity of the large single flow circulation cell by introducing additional<br>
cooling flow directly into, and in the same direction as, the naturally occurring<br>
flow cell. While this method increases the heat transfer in the cavity by<br>
augmenting the strength of the circulation cell, the center region of the rotor<br>
cavity was still left with low velocity and therefore low heat transfer. The same<br>
low heat transfer still persists in the corner regions.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention enhances the heat transfer rate from the copper end<br>
turns of the field endwinding region by using surface machining or preparation<br>
to generate flow structures beneficial to cooling of the end turns. Improving<br>
cooling of the end turns in this region will provide the opportunity to increase<br>
the power output rating of a given machine leading to an improved cost basis<br>
on a dollar per kilowatt-hour basis. As the endwinding region is usually<br>
limiting in terms of satisfying maximum temperature constraints,<br>
improvements in this region should produce significant performance benefits.<br>
Heat transfer rates are increased by the increased surface area,<br>
improved turbulent mixing on the surface, and boundary layer breakup and<br>
subsequent reattachment. According to a first embodiment of the invention,<br>
at least one of the copper end turns is machined to increase the surface area<br>
thereof as compared to a planar surface. This may be accomplished by<br>
roughening the surface such as for example, by creating grooves.<br>
According to a second, alternate embodiment of the invention, the<br>
surface area of the end turns is increased by forming small dimples, similar to<br>
those provided on the surface of golf balls, on the rotor copper end turn<br>
sections. These dimples increase heat transfer rates by a factor of three or<br>
four while causing a negligible increase in the friction characteristics and<br>
overall pressure loss.<br>
In accordance with a further feature of the invention, in addition to or<br>
rather than modifying the copper end turns themselves, the support blocks or<br>
spaceblocks disposed between the copper end turns are modified. According<br>
to one exemplary embodiment, turbulators are placed on the spaceblock face<br>
disposed on the downstream side of the cavity. More specifically, each of the<br>
rotor spaceblocks is fabricated with roughness elements. These turbulators<br>
act to disturb the flow, leading to increased turbulence and incoherent mixing.<br>
The result is to improve the overall heat transfer rate.<br>
In another alternate embodiment, vortex generators are formed on the<br>
spaceblock face on the downstream side of the cavity. More specifically, for<br>
example, triangular sections are fabricated onto the spaceblock for the<br>
purpose of generating coherent vortex structures from the cooling gas flow<br>
across the spaceblocks.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to the drawings wherein identical reference numerals denote<br>
the same elements throughout the various views, FIGURES 1 and 2 show a<br>
rotor 10 for a gas-cooled dynamoelectric machine, which also includes a<br>
stator 12 surrounding the rotor. The rotor includes a generally cylindrical body<br>
portion 14 centrally disposed on a rotor spindle 16 and having axially<br>
opposing end faces, of which a portion 18 of one end face is shown in<br>
FIGURE 1. The body portion is provided with a plurality of circumferentially-<br>
spaced, axially extending slots 20 for receiving concentrically arranged coils<br>
22, which make up the rotor winding. For clarity, only five rotor coils are<br>
shown in FIGURE 2, although several more are commonly used in practice.<br>
Specifically, a number of conductor bars 24 constituting a portion of the<br>
rotor winding are stacked in each one of the slots. Adjacent conductor bars<br>
are separated by layers of electrical insulation 22. The stacked conductor<br>
bars are typically maintained in the slots by wedges 26 (FIGURE 1) and are<br>
made of a conductive material such as copper. The conductor bars 24 are<br>
interconnected at each opposing end of the body portion by end turns 27,<br>
which extend axially beyond the end faces to form stacked endwindings 28.<br>
The end turns are also separated by layers of electrical insulation.<br>
Referring specifically to FIGURE 1, a retaining ring 30 is disposed<br>
around the end turns at each end of the body portion to hold the endwindings<br>
in place against centrifugal forces. The retaining ring is fixed at one end to<br>
the body portion and extends out over the rotor spindle 16. A centering ring<br>
32 is attached to the distal end of the retaining ring 30. It should be noted that<br>
the retaining ring 30 and the center ring 32 can be mounted in other ways, as<br>
is known in the art. The inner peripheral edge of the centering ring 32 is<br>
radially spaced from the rotor spindle 16 so as to form a gas inlet passage 34<br>
and the endwindings 28 are spaced from the spindle 16 so as to define an<br>
annular region 36. A number of axial cooling channels 38 formed along slots<br>
20 are provided in fluid communication with the gas inlet passage 34 via the<br>
annular region 36 to deliver cooling gas to the coils 22.<br>
Turning to FIGURE 2, the endwindings 28 at each end of the rotor 10<br>
are circumferentially and axially separated by a number of spacers or<br>
spaceblocks 40. (For clarity of illustration, the spaceblocks are not shown in<br>
FIGURE 1). The spaceblocks are elongated blocks of an insulating material<br>
located in the spaces between adjacent endwindings 28 and extend beyond<br>
the full radial depth of the endwindings into the annular gap 36. Accordingly,<br>
the spaces between the concentric stacks of the end turns 27 are divided into<br>
cavities. These cavities are bounded on the top by the retaining ring 30 and<br>
on four sides by adjacent endwindings 28 and adjacent spaceblocks 40, as<br>
shown in FIGURE 3. As best seen in FIGURE 1, each of these cavities is in<br>
fluid communication with the gas inlet passage 34 via the annular region 36.<br>
A portion of the cooling gas entering the annular region 36 between the<br>
endwinding 28 and the rotor spindle 16 through the gas inlet passage 34 thus<br>
enters cavities 42, circulates therein, and then returns to the annular region 36<br>
between the endwinding and the rotor spindle. Air flow is shown by the<br>
arrows in FIGURES 1 and 3.<br>
The inherent pumping action and rotational forces acting in a rotating<br>
generator cavity produce a large single flow circulation cell, as schematically<br>
shown in FIGURE 3. This flow circulation cell exhibits its highest velocity near<br>
the peripheral edges of the cavity, typically leaving the center region<br>
inadequately cooled due to the inherently low velocity in the center region of<br>
the cavity. As can be seen from FIGURE 3, large areas of the corner regions<br>
are also inadequately cooled because the circular motion of the flow cell does<br>
not carry cooling flow into the corners.<br>
To improve generator field end winding cooling effectiveness, in an<br>
embodiment of the invention the copper end turn sections and/or mechanical<br>
spaceblocks are machined or otherwise surface profiled so as to define a non-<br>
planar surface profile on a surface thereof facing the adjacent endwinding<br>
cavity. These surface modifications increase the level of turbulent mixing and<br>
breaking up the thermal boundary layers developed by the flow moving along<br>
the surfaces. In each case, the corresponding pressure drop will increase.<br>
However, the gains in cooling the endwinding region generally produce overall<br>
benefits that are in excess of the penalty of increased windage loss.<br>
Thus, referring to FIGURE 4, the surface(s) of at least one of the end<br>
turns 127 bounding the cooling cavity are at least one of machined or surface<br>
profiled so as to at least one of increased the surface area thereof and<br>
generate a turbulent flow to thereby improve heat transfer.<br>
In accordance with a first embodiment, the exposed surfaces 144,146<br>
of the end turns 127 defining the endwinding 128 are extruded or machined to<br>
increase the surface area thereof. By way of example, the surface area can<br>
be increased by machining or extruding the copper turns to define at least one<br>
groove 148, 150 extending longitudinally of at least one exposed surface 144,<br>
146 of the end turn(s) 127.<br>
In an alternate embodiment, as illustrated in FIGURE 5, a plurality of<br>
dimples 252 are formed in at least one surface 244,246 of at least one of the<br>
copper end turns 227 defining the rotor endwinding 228.<br>
It is to be understood that the grooving and dimpling embodiments are<br>
merely examples of surface profiling that may be adopted to improve heat<br>
transfer. Indeed, other surface profiling techniques for increasing surface<br>
area, improving turbulent mixing on the surface, and/or boundary layer<br>
breakup and subsequent reattachment may be adopted without departing<br>
from this invention. For example, protrusions or recesses of other shapes and<br>
patterns may be provided. Also, the surface profiling need not be as<br>
pronounced as the illustrated embodiment. Thus, for example, a knurled<br>
surface may be provided as a further alternative.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, as illustrated in<br>
FIGURES 6-9, in addition to or as an alternative to surface profiling the end<br>
turns, at least the surface 156 disposed on the downstream side of the<br>
respective cavity 142 (hereinafter referred to as downstream surface) of at<br>
least some of the spaceblocks 140 is profiled so as to redirect flow impinged<br>
thereon. In a presently preferred embodiment, the downstream surface of the<br>
spaceblock is profiled by providing at least one flow disrupting structure<br>
thereon. In one example, the flow disrupting structures are turbulators 158<br>
provided on the downstream surface of the spaceblocks (only one turbulated<br>
spaceblock is shown for clarity). Each of the turbulators 158 has a generally<br>
rectangular and most preferably square shape in vertical section (FIGURE 6)<br>
and have a longitudinal axis inclined with respect to an axis of the rotor<br>
(FIGURE 7). As noted above, the turbulators may be provided on the<br>
spaceblocks instead of or in addition to the surface machining or profiling<br>
exemplified by FIGURES 4-5.<br>
According to another alternate example, the flow disrupting struptures<br>
are a plurality of vortex generators 258 provided on the surface 256 at least<br>
some of the spaceblocks 240 that faces and is disposed on the downstream<br>
side of the respective cavity 242. As shown in FIGURE 8, each of the vortex<br>
generators 258 has a generally triangular vertical cross-section and as shown<br>
in FIGURE 9, each vortex generator 258 is oriented with its longitudinal axis<br>
at an incline with respect to the axis of the rotor 10.<br>
While the invention has been described in connection with what is<br>
presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is<br>
to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the disclosed<br>
embodiments, but on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications<br>
