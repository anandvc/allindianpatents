TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to techniques for wirelessly collecting vehicle information<br>
and providing that information to the vehicle owner or other authorized person.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Telematics units are now widely in use on vehicles to provide drivers with various<br>
types of wireless assistance services (WAS). For example, "roadside assistance" which<br>
historically involved a disabled vehicle and a physical visit to the vehicle by a<br>
serviceman, can now in many instances be provided remotely via wireless<br>
telecommunication with the vehicle through existing cellular network facilities. Thus, a<br>
telephone call to a call center (WAS center) can be used to electronically unlock doors<br>
where the keys have inadvertently been locked inside. Also, navigation and emergency<br>
assistance services can be obtained by voice communication with an advisor at the call<br>
center. Monitoring of vehicle operating conditions by the call center is also possible via<br>
the telematics device. For example, an air bag deployment event can be automatically<br>
reported to the call center where it triggers a return call to the vehicle from a live advisor<br>
to determine if emergency services are needed. Other vehicle data such as diagnostic<br>
trouble codes (DTCs) can similarly be reported to the call center.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the invention, there is provided providing<br>
vehicle information to an owner or other recipient, comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	accessing vehicle data using a telematics unit of the vehicle;<br>
(b)	transmitting the vehicle data from the telematics unit to a central data system;<br>
(c)	selecting a message template from among a plurality of message templates;<br>
(d)	constructing a notification message using the selected message template; and<br><br>
(e) sending the notification message to a recipient via an electronic messaging<br>
system.<br>
The templates can include predefined static content, such as predefined text used<br>
in the notification message. Different templates can be used in different circumstances.<br>
For example, after a vehicle is purchased or leased, a welcome email notification<br>
message can be sent to the subscriber, with this email being constructed using a welcome<br>
template. Thereafter, monthly email notifications can be sent, with the monthly<br>
notifications being constructed using a monthly template. Other templates for specific<br>
notifications can also be used; for example, for low oil life and to report the occurrence of<br>
other specific diagnostic warnings.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention, vehicle data can be sent to a<br>
central data system based on the occurrence of a trigger, and a message template then<br>
used to build a notification message sent to a recipient. The particular message template<br>
used can be selected based on the type of trigger; for example, a monthly trigger would<br>
result in one template being selected whereas an low oil life trigger would result in a<br>
different template being selected.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a software-implemented<br>
administrative tool can be used to input static notification message content that is then<br>
used along with data from the vehicle to build a notification message that is then sent to<br>
the subscriber.<br>
In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, notification messages can<br>
be generated using vehicle data and a template that defines a plurality of different<br>
sections, with only those sections applicable to the particular vehicle being used in<br>
constructing the notification message. Thus, for example, the template can define content<br>
for satellite radio services account information, or for recall information, and these<br>
corresponding sections can be entirely eliminated from the generated notification<br>
message if they are not applicable (e.g., if the owner does not have a satellite radio<br>
installed or if there are no recalls in effect for the vehicle).<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The following terms used herein have the ascribed meanings. "Vehicle data"<br>
means information concerning a particular vehicle's condition or operation; for example,<br>
mileage, remaining oil life, GPS coordinates, door lock state, diagnostic trouble codes<br>
(DTCs), diagnostic results, air bag activation. "Vehicle information" is information<br><br>
related to a particular vehicle; for example, vehicle data, maintenance information, recall<br>
information, wireless assistance services (WAS) account information, satellite radio<br>
account information. A "subscriber" is a person or entity who either has legal title to the<br>
vehicle (e.g., a purchaser, corporation, parent) or has possession of the vehicle for regular<br>
use (e.g., a lessee, employee driving a company car, licensed minor), or both (e.g., a<br>
purchaser-driver), and who has opted to receive electronic messages from the email<br>
notification system. "Owner" is used interchangeably with "subscriber" and has the same<br>
meaning, except that an owner need not necessarily be one that receives electronic<br>
messages from the email notification system. A "trigger" is a defined event or vehicle<br>
condition that, when met, initiates notification processing (e.g., every 30 days, remaining<br>
oil life 
processing" is the process of determining whether an electronic message should be sent to<br>
a subscriber and, if so, the content of the message. "Language characters" are the<br>
individual components of a written language (e.g., alphanumeric characters), whether<br>
represented graphically using a graphics file format or represented textually or as<br>
characters using, for example, ASCII or some other type of numerical encoding. A<br>
"diagnostic result" is specific or general information concerning a monitored vehicle<br>
component, system, or operating condition. A specific diagnostic result could be, for<br>
example, the amount of oil life remaining (e.g., on a percentage basis 0-100%), whereas a<br>
general diagnostic result could be, for example, a graphical indicator such as a green,<br>
yellow, or red graphic that indicates whether some action is required to address one or<br>
more of the vehicle conditions and possibly the importance or severity of the vehicle<br>
condition. An "electronic message generating system" (EMGS) is an electronic system<br>
that builds and sends electronic messages such as Internet email messages. An<br>
"electronic messaging system" is a public or private email system, or any other system<br>
suitable for transmitting electronic messages to specific recipients, including text<br>
messaging using SMS (short messaging services) and including MMS (multimedia<br>
messaging services).<br>
The illustrated embodiment is directed to a vehicle email notification system and<br>
method in which triggers are used to initiate the generation and transmission of email<br>
messages that provide diverse types of dynamic vehicle information to the subscriber.<br><br>
The email notifications are triggered by different events, some of which are independent<br>
of the vehicle (e.g., a 30 day trigger to provide the subscriber with a monthly vehicle<br>
status report), and others of which occur at the vehicle, such as a mileage or low oil life<br>
trigger. Upon occurrence of a trigger, the notification system builds and sends to the<br>
subscriber an email message that contains the dynamic vehicle information and identifies<br>
any detected vehicle condition for which action is required or desired. The vehicle<br>
information generally falls into four categories: (1) diagnostic information;<br>
(2) maintenance information; (3) recall information, and (4) ancillary services<br>
information, such as account information for such things as wireless assistance services<br>
or satellite radio services. The email notification messages also provide supplemental<br>
information such as dealer contact information, regional specific information (such as a<br>
particular state's child car seat laws or front passenger seat belt laws), maintenance<br>
service pricing quotes and/or coupons, state licensing renewal date and/or notification,<br>
and lease financing information (e.g., next monthly payment due date and amount).<br>
These and other features will be discussed below in greater detail.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the disclosed email notification system 100 contains a number<br>
of different system components interconnected by one or more communication links.<br>
The vehicle 110 communicates with the remainder of the notification system via a<br>
wireless communication network 140, such as a cellular communication system that uses<br>
CDMA or other suitable communication technology. For this purpose, the vehicle 110 is<br>
equipped with a wireless communication module having a suitable modem to enable<br>
voice and data transmission over the wireless communication network 140. Also<br>
onboard the vehicle are various vehicle systems modules (VSMs) that access different<br>
types of vehicle information which can then be transmitted via the wireless<br>
communication module. These vehicle systems include such things as a diagnostics<br>
module that accesses different vehicle systems to determine whether any fault conditions<br>
exist. For example, the diagnostic module can access the engine and powertrain systems,<br>
the air bag system, antilock braking system, and the wireless communication module<br>
itself to obtain diagnostic information and even initiate a diagnostic check of these<br>
systems. Apart from diagnostics, the vehicle can include vehicle body and engine<br>
computers that can provide other dynamic vehicle information such as mileage and<br><br>
remaining oil life information. The construction and operation of each of these onboard<br>
vehicle systems is well known in the art and need not be discussed here in greater detail.<br>
The vehicle communicates with a vehicle data upload (VDU) 160 system that lies<br>
at the operational heart of the notification system 100. In general, the VDU 160 handles<br>
initial configuration of each subscriber's notification account upon enrollment, the setting<br>
and processing of triggers, the acquisition of data needed for populating the email<br>
notification message, and the initiation of actual email generation. These functions are<br>
implemented utilizing information obtained from a variety of databases and other systems<br>
including, in particular, a VDU administration tool (VAT) 182, an electronic message<br>
generating system (EMGS) 184, an email hosting facility 186, a wireless assistance<br>
services (WAS) center 170 as well as a user-configurable WAS website 188, and several<br>
other systems that supply information to the WAS center 170. As shown in Fig. 1, these<br>
other systems include a subscriber services center 190,, a CRM application 192, a quality<br>
information system 194, and a third party customer data and WAS subscription service<br>
196. Rather than maintaining the data in distributed databases or other systems, all of the<br>
needed information can be stored in a single database using different schemas in the<br>
database. These and other approaches for data management and handling will be known<br>
to those skilled in the art.<br>
The VDU administration tool (VAT) 182 is used to set up the VDU 160 and<br>
EMGS 184 by providing the basic content of the email messages along with various<br>
configuration items for the generation and sending of the messages. For example, the<br>
VAT 182 can provide various configurable parameters such as the type of email (plain<br>
text, html, SMS), the number and timing of email resends when a failed send is detected,<br>
and the conditions under which an alternate email address is used. The VAT is also used<br>
to specify various aspects of the VDU-to-vehicle communication, such as the conditions<br>
under which a call is placed by the vehicle back to the VDU (e.g., vehicle ignition ON<br>
only, OFF only, or DON'T CARE) or the grace period (e.g., 60 days) that the subscriber<br>
is given following the end of their WAS subscription period before the vehicle-to-VDU<br>
communication capability is switched off.<br><br>
The email notification messages generated by the system include both static<br>
content (predetermined text and possibly graphics) as well as dynamic content<br>
(information that normally changes over time). This static and dynamic content is<br>
accessed from different sources shown in Fig. 1 and combined into one digital file that<br>
constitutes the email message. Constructing the email message is preferably<br>
accomplished using one or more predefined templates with the VAT 182 specifying<br>
which template is to be used. Different templates can be used for different vehicle types<br>
and/or different types of triggers. The construction and content of the email messages<br>
and the use of these templates will be discussed in greater detail below in connection with<br>
Fig. 3.<br>
The electronic message generating system (EMGS) 184 is initiated by the VDU<br>
160 as the result of a vehicle trigger received by the VDU. It obtains the dynamic and<br>
static vehicle information from the VDU 160 and in some cases directly from other<br>
sources and builds the email message using the predefined template that has been<br>
specified by the VAT 182. Once the email is built, it is sent via the Internet by way of<br>
the email hosting facility 186 which actually handles the queuing and transmission of the<br>
email using standard Internet mail protocols such as smtp.<br>
Some of the vehicle or subscriber-specific static information used in the email<br>
message (subscriber name, dealer information, WAS account number, etc.) is obtained<br>
from the WAS database 174 which includes information originally obtained from yet<br>
other systems. For example, basic customer (subscriber) information can be maintained<br>
by a third party service 196 that provides a single source of cleansed customer data along<br>
with subscription and renewal information for their WAS account. Customer information<br>
from the CRM system 192 can also be used included in the WAS database 174.<br>
Subscriber-provided information inputted into a subscriber's website 190 (e.g., the<br>
mileage at the last oil change) can also be provided to the WAS database 174. This<br>
information can be used by the WAS center 170 to assist a live advisor in handling<br>
customer inquiries and addressing vehicle problems monitored by the WAS center. For<br>
the generation of the email notifications, at least some of this information is pulled from<br>
the WAS database 174 by the VDU 160 and provided to the EMGS 184 for inclusion in<br><br>
the email message. Personalized information previously supplied by the subscriber to a<br>
user-customizable WAS website 188 (MyWAS) can also be accessed automatically by<br>
EMGS 184 and included into the email. An example would be a user-supplied digital<br>
photograph of their vehicle which could be included in the email.<br>
The subscriber can also customize certain aspects of the system, such as the<br>
number of days used for the periodic triggers that generate status email notifications.<br>
Thus, rather than having a 30 day trigger, the subscriber can customize the trigger to<br>
occur perhaps once per week or once per quarter. This can be done via the subscriber<br>
website 190 which provides limited access to the VAT 182 to configure these items in the<br>
VDU 160.<br>
Vehicle diagnostic and other information obtained from the vehicle by the VDU<br>
160 can also be provided to the WAS database 174 for later retrieval by a live advisor or<br>
for other purposes. Also, at least some of this information can be supplied to the quality<br>
information system 194 for warranty analysis, trending and other evaluations. The<br>
provision of such information to the quality information system 194 can be automatic on<br>
every trigger, only for certain triggers, or only under certain conditions. For example, the<br>
mileage and oil life reading can be provided to the system 194 only in those instances<br>
where there is a DTC or particular DTC that has occurred.<br>
Before turning to the specifics of the email notification message itself, reference<br>
is made to Fig. 2 which provides some additional information concerning various<br>
centralized and onboard vehicle systems needed to implement the email notification<br>
system 100. The construction and operation of these onboard vehicle systems will be<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art given the functional descriptions provided herein in<br>
combination with the knowledge generally available about existing systems currently in<br>
use and the level of skill in the art. As shown in Fig. 2, motor vehicle 110 is depicted as a<br>
typical passenger sedan, and it will be appreciated that other mobile vehicles such as<br>
marine vehicles, aircraft, and other automobiles (e.g., vans, gas and diesel trucks, etc.)<br>
can be used as long as they are fitted with an appropriate wireless communication module<br>
that is connected onboard to communicate with the one or more vehicle systems from<br><br>
which vehicle information is to be obtained. Located within vehicle 110 are various<br>
electronic modules that include a telematics unit 120 connected by way of a on-board<br>
vehicle network 112 to one or more vehicle system modules (VSMs) 130. As will be<br>
described in greater detail, telematics unit 120 includes the vehicle's wireless<br>
communication module and this unit provides communication and interactivity with the<br>
driver and with various remote locations including the VDU 160, WAS center 170, and<br>
the dealer service center 180. The VSMs 130 provide various on-board vehicle<br>
diagnostic, monitoring, control, and reporting functions. For example, one VSM 130 can<br>
be used for controlling engine operation (e.g., fuel injection and ignition timing), while<br>
another VSM 130 can be a safety system that handles monitoring and deployment of air<br>
bags or other SIR safety systems on the vehicle. In the embodiment of FIG. 1, the VSMs<br>
include a diagnostic VSM 132, such as an on-board diagnostic system (e.g., an OBD-II<br>
system) which performs a diagnostic check of various vehicle sensors.<br>
In facilitating interactions among the various communication and electronic<br>
modules, vehicle communication network 112 uses any suitable network communication<br>
approaches, such as controller-area network (CAN), ISO Standard 9141, ISO Standard<br>
11898 for high-speed applications, ISO Standard 11519 for lower speed applications,<br>
SAE Standard Jl 850 for high-speed and lower speed applications, and/or the like.<br>
Telematics unit 120 can be implemented in various ways, but in the illustrated<br>
embodiment includes a processor 121, a wireless communications module 122 for<br>
communication to and from the vehicle via one or more antennas 123, a digital memory<br>
124 which stores programs 125 and a database 126, one or more pushbutton switches 127<br>
and a microphone 128 and one or more speakers 129 for enabling voice communication<br>
with the WAS live advisor and for use in hands free calling (HFC). Processor 121 can be<br>
implemented in various ways known to those skilled in the art, such as by a<br>
microprocessor or an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Processor 121<br>
executes one or more computer programs 125 to carry out its various functions of<br>
monitoring and processing data and communicating with the vehicle system modules<br>
130, vehicle user, and remote locations. As a part of the email notification system 100, it<br>
is also used to set the various triggers requested by the VDU 160 and monitor for the<br><br>
occurrence of a trigger and then initiate a call back to the VDU when the trigger<br>
occurrence is detected. Alternatively, a dedicated VSM 130 could be provided for trigger<br>
handling.<br>
Communications module 122 provides wireless communication via cellular (e.g.,<br>
CDMA, GSM), satellite, or other wireless path, and includes the ability to provide for<br>
both voice and data communications. This allows data communication with at least the<br>
VDU 160, as well as voice and, if desired, data communication with the WAS center 170<br>
and dealer 180.<br>
Memory 124 can any digital storage device that provides computer-readable<br>
storage of data and programs for use by processor 121. This includes volatile and/or non-<br>
volatile memory storage and can be implemented as one or more separate physical<br>
devices.<br>
Programs 125 include one or more computer programs that are executed by<br>
processor 121 to carry out the various functions of telematics unit 120. The database 126<br>
includes storage of the triggers set by the VDU 160 as well as associated information<br>
such as a listing of the vehicle systems to be accessed for purposes of acquiring and<br>
reporting dynamic vehicle information back to the VDU.<br>
Although depicted in FIG. 2 as separate individual modules, it will be appreciated<br>
by those skilled in the art that many of the components of telematics unit 120 can be<br>
integrated together, or integrated and/or shared with other vehicle systems so that, for<br>
example, memory 124 can be incorporated into processor 121 or located outside of<br>
telematics unit 120 and shared with one or more other vehicle systems.<br>
Wireless carrier system 140 can be a cellular and/or satellite wireless<br>
communication system used.to transmit voice and data between the vehicle 110 and<br>
various remote locations such as shown in Fig. 1. In one embodiment, wireless carrier<br>
system 140 is implemented as a CDMA, GSM or other cellular communication system<br>
142 that exchanges voice and data between the vehicle 110 and communication network<br>
150. Additionally or alternatively, wireless communication can be by way of satellite<br><br>
transmission which uses one or more satellites 144 to connect the vehicle to the<br>
communication network 150 via, for example, a central, ground-based satellite facility<br>
146. Communication network 150 can be a land-based wired system such as the public<br>
telephone system and/or cable system used for telephony and data communication<br>
including communication that is carried out over the Internet. For purposes of the<br>
embodiment discussed herein, the wireless communication between the vehicle 110 and<br>
VDU 160 is by way of a.cellular system 142 and the satellite 144 is used to provide<br>
ancillary services such as GPS coordinates or a satellite radio feed.<br>
VDU 160 is a central data system that can be implemented using one or more<br>
computer systems located either at an independent remote location or, for example, at the<br>
WAS center 170. A typical computer system is shown in Fig. 2 and includes a modem<br>
and/or router 162, a computer 164, and database 166 all connected by an Ethernet LAN<br>
168. Database 166 can be implemented using a separate network attached storage (NAS)<br>
device or can be stored on a computer 164 itself, or can be located elsewhere, as desired.<br>
The computer 164 has an application program that handles all of the VDU processing,<br>
including communication with the vehicle 110 and the setting and processing of triggers.<br>
VDU 160 can also communicate with WAS center 170 and/or the dealer service center<br>
180 either via network 150 or by some more direct path. Suitable hardware and software<br>
configurations are known to those skilled in the art. While VDU 160 is depicted as being<br>
implemented using a single computer 164, it will be appreciated that the various<br>
functions carried out by the VDU can be implemented using a number of local or<br>
distributed computers. Furthermore, VAT 182 and EMGS 184 can both be implemented<br>
either as standalone systems or can be separate processes running on the same hardware<br>
used by the VDU 160.<br>
WAS center 170 can be one or more locations staffed by one or more live<br>
advisors 176 who handle calls from vehicle drivers and/or who monitor for various<br>
vehicle conditions such as an airbag deployment. The WAS center can include one or<br>
more servers 172 that include the necessary commiinication capabilities with network<br>
150, data storage 174, and a LAN 178 for connecting these components together along<br>
with the computers) used by the live advisors 176. If desired, the VDU 160 can be<br><br>
integrated into WAS center 170 rather than utilizing two separate systems. Suitable call<br>
center facilities are known and currently in use to provide remote live assistance in<br>
connection with in-vehicle safety and security systems. Apart from using live advisors,<br>
the advisor 176 can be implemented as an automaton or a program running on a computer<br>
• operatively disposed to respond to subscriber requests.<br>
Dealer service center 180 is a vehicle dealership where vehicle maintenance and<br>
repair is carried out. The dealer service center is connected by way of communication<br>
network 150 with the vehicle 110 so that the driver can initiate a telephone call with a<br>
technician or service scheduler at the dealership.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 3, there is shown an exemplary email notification message<br>
generated by the system. The email message is made up at least in part using language<br>
characters, whether as words using the English alphabet or a different foreign language<br>
that utilizes textual or graphical characters. The illustrated email message is provided<br>
using html to provide attractive formatting and display of the message contents. Other<br>
markup languages such as xml can be used as well. Alternatively, the email can be<br>
provided as plain text with no formatting or markup language used. The email message<br>
itself is formatted into a number of regions, including an upper region that provides basic<br>
vehicle and introductory information, a second region that provides diagnostic<br>
information, a third region that provides maintenance information, a fourth region that<br>
lists various notifications (possible vehicle recalls and ancillary services account and<br>
subscription information), and a fifth region that provides miscellaneous information<br>
such as dealer contact information. As shown, the message can also contain a header and<br>
footer, with the header providing space for a company logo and tabs that connect the user<br>
to different websites, such as the main website for the WAS services. The footer can<br>
provide support contact information, use of information legal disclaimers, etc.<br>
The first, upper region contains an introductory message such as shown. This<br>
message is built using an email template that is particular to the type of trigger that<br>
initiated the email. For example, the illustrated email message of Fig. 3 is a welcome<br>
email that is generated and sent to the subscriber within 24 hours of their enrollment into<br><br>
the service. Although this email could be automatically • generated and sent by the<br>
notification system 100 without communicating with the vehicle 110, it is desirable to<br>
include different pieces of vehicle information in the email message including, for<br>
example, mileage, remaining oil life, and the diagnostic status of various vehicle systems.<br>
Thus, this email is built using a welcome template that includes the static content<br>
(predefined text) from the template as well as fields denoting vehicle-specific<br>
information. These fields are populated with the appropriate data accessed from the<br>
WAS database 164 or elsewhere, as discussed above. The fields can be identified using<br>
xml or in any other suitable manner. Dynamic content related to the individual<br>
subscriber or his or her demographics can be included in this upper region as well.<br>
Similarly, the content of this region could be automatically varied by the EMGS 184 in<br>
accordance with certain features of the subscriber's WAS subscription, such as how long<br>
they have been enrolled, where they are in a particular subscription period, and according<br>
to other aspects related to where the subscriber is in the WAS lifecycle.<br>
The welcome message text of this first region also identifies three action<br>
indicators: green (no issues found), yellow (action suggested), and red (immediate<br>
attention required). These action indicators are represented by symbols as shown, and<br>
these symbols and their short textual description are preferably included in each email.<br>
At the right side of the first region, a digital photograph of the make and model (and<br>
preferably style and color) of the subscriber's vehicle is provided. This picture can either<br>
be accessed from a standard library of vehicle pictures, or can be a user-supplied<br>
photograph of his or her own vehicle obtained, for example, from the personalized WAS<br>
website. Underneath the pictured vehicle is the particular VIN number for the vehicle so<br>
that the email provides a convenient source of this information when needed by the<br>
subscriber.<br>
The second through fourth regions of the email message are each separated into a<br>
number of sections, with each section relating to a particular type of information useful to<br>
the subscriber. For the diagnostic region, in the example provided in Fig. 3, it is divided<br>
up into four sections: engine and/or transmission, air bag system, antilock braking system<br>
(ABS), and the vehicle wireless communication module. Each section includes a section<br><br>
label identifying the particular vehicle system, a diagnostic test status indicator, and a<br>
diagnostic result indicator. The diagnostic test status indicator identifies whether or not<br>
the diagnostic test of the vehicle system was successful - if so, the email message<br>
includes a "Diagnostic: Completed." If the test did not complete, the message can state<br>
.. "Diagnostic: Failed." along with a request to contact the WAS support. The diagnostic<br>
result indicator provides the subscriber with a general diagnostic result about the<br>
particular vehicle system, and this diagnostic result indicator can be implemented using<br>
the action indicator symbol noted above (green, yellow, or red symbol), and the section<br>
can further state whether some action is required by the owner to address a problem or<br>
abnormal condition identified during the diagnostic test. A hypertext link to more<br>
information can also be provided to give the subscriber additional information about the<br>
diagnostic test that was run and what the results mean.<br>
The maintenance region of the email message includes a first section that provides<br>
information concerning the remaining engine oil life and a second section that provides<br>
vehicle mileage information. The colored action indicators are used here as well to<br>
identify whether any action is needed by the owner.<br>
Where some servicing is required, either for maintenance or to address diagnostic<br>
issues, the email message can include a link to a dealer to schedule the vehicle service, or<br>
can provide pricing or coupon information to encourage the subscriber to obtain the<br>
necessary service either from a particular dealer or any local dealer. For example, where<br>
an oil change is needed, the email message can include a notice stating that the subscriber<br>
can print out the email message and take it with them to the dealer to obtain a discounted<br>
price or additional services when having the engine oil changed. Alternatively, the email<br>
message can provide a link that the subscriber can click to access a dealer coupon, and<br>
this coupon can either provide a general discount that is unrelated to the specific vehicle<br>
service needed or can be specifically tailored to the servicing required (for example, by<br>
offering additional related services or by providing specific pricing or discounts for the<br>
service needed).<br><br>
The notification region is separated into four sections: vehicle recalls, WAS<br>
account and subscription information, hands free calling (HFC) account information, and<br>
satellite radio account and subscription information. The recall section lists each recall in<br>
effect and can provide additional detail concerning the purpose and scope of the recall.<br>
Only recalls applicable to the particular vehicle involved are reported. The WAS<br>
subscription section identifies the subscriber's account number, type of service plan, and<br>
expiration date, and can include additional information if desired. The hands free calling<br>
section provides information on cellular voice telephone services that are available<br>
through the same wireless communication module 122 that is used to provide the WAS<br>
services. This section identifies the vehicle telephone number along with account<br>
information. For prepaid plans or monthly plans that offer a fixed number of included<br>
minutes, the number of remaining minutes is provided. The satellite radio account<br>
section provides account and subscription information for satellite radio services. As<br>
shown for the WAS subscription section, any of these renewable services can include a<br>
button in their individual section to redirect the subscriber to a subscription renewal<br>
website, and these buttons can be provided only once the renewal date approaches (e.g.,<br>
within 120 days of the renewal date). Also, each of the ancillary services sections<br>
preferably include the ability for the user to click through to the service website itself to<br>
obtain additional account information, etc. Other sections can be shown in this<br>
notification region. For example, where the vehicle's registration is near expiration (e.g.,<br>
within 60 days), if this information is included in one of the databases accessible to the<br>
VDU or EMGS, then a state registration renewal notification with contact information<br>
and hypertext links can be provided in the email.<br>
The fifth region can be used for miscellaneous information such as the dealer<br>
contact shown. This can include a link to the dealer website and/or selection of a<br>
"mailto:" or similar link that initiates an email message to the dealer. Some or all of the<br>
vehicle information (VIN, mileage, diagnostic results, etc.) can be automatically included<br>
in this dealer email by suitable programming or scripting known to those skilled in the<br>
art. Alternatively, the entire subscriber's notification email can be included in or attached<br>
(e.g., forwarded) as a part of tins dealer email. Apart from dealer information, insurance<br>
information and lease or loan information can be included in this fifth region as well, or<br><br>
can be included in another dedicated or shared region of the email. These other sections<br>
can include informatioii for the subscriber such as insurance contact information or loan<br>
balance and payment due date information, as well as the ability to direct an email to the<br>
insurer or loan company.<br>
As mentioned above in connection with the various vehicle systems that provide<br>
vehicle information and wireless communication, each of the ancillary service systems<br>
that provide, for example, the WAS, HFC, and satellite radio services, are existing<br>
systems and the construction and operation of these systems are known to those skilled in<br>
the art. Similarly the interconnections and prograinrning necessary to interface with these<br>
, systems and extract the desired accounting and subscription information are also known<br>
to those skilled in the art.<br>
In some instances, there will be no information to be placed in a particular region<br>
or section of a region. For example, when there are no recalls in effect for the vehicle, or<br>
once the vehicle has had the recall servicing performed, the recall section will be empty.<br>
If desired, this can be implemented by a short message placed in the section such as "No<br>
recalls in effect." Alternatively, it may be desirable to eliminate the section altogether, in<br>
which case the email template will include a provision for collapsing the section out of<br>
existence if there is no data to display. This can be done for other regions; for example,<br>
where the vehicle does not have an ABS system, or as another example, if the notification<br>
system is designed to allow subscribers to customize their email reports, one subscriber<br>
might wish to display powertrain systems diagnostic information whereas another might<br>
not. Rather than providing separate templates for each such potential combination of<br>
notifications, the email template can be setup to collapse the undesired sections of the<br>
diagnostic region for those users who do not want to see that powertrain information.<br>
This subscriber customization could be implemented via the VAT 182 through the<br>
subscriber website 190, and the configuration for that subscriber can be stored in the<br>
VDU database 164. Preferably, the sections are collapsed only when it is desired not to<br>
display the related information (e.g., no recalls in effect, or subscriber does not want<br>
powertrain information included). Where there is no data available for a section that is to<br>
be displayed (e.g., the diagnostic test failed and no data has been reported), then rather<br><br>
than collapsing the section, a diagnostic failed message is displayed, as discussed further<br>
above. This same approach can be used for the other regions so that, for example, where<br>
no satellite radio account information is available because that third party system is<br>
offline, then that fact would be noted rather than collapsing the satellite radio section out<br>
of existence.<br>
As noted above, the template used can be selected using the VAT 182 and this can<br>
be done by providing a plurality of different templates from among which the system<br>
selects the appropriate template based on the type of trigger and/or type of vehicle. Other<br>
selection criteria can be used as well; for example, based on a language preference such<br>
as English or Spanish. This language preference can be supplied by the subscriber with<br>
via a website (MyWAS 188 or the owner center 190) or to the dealer or to the WAS<br>
center 170 such as by way of a call from the vehicle. This permits the subscriber to<br>
customize this language feature of the templates in the same manner as is done for the<br>
other customizable template features discussed above. In implemented the use of<br>
multiple selection criteria for template selection, a different, unique template can be<br>
defined for each combination of selection criteria. For example, if vehicle type, trigger<br>
type, and language preference are used in selecting the appropriate template, there will be<br>
a different template for each different combination of these three criteria. Thus, for<br>
example, a monthly email constructed for an English speaking Cadillac® owner will be<br>
constructed using a different template than a monthly email constructed for an English<br>
speaking Chevrolet owner. This allows a vehicle manufacturer to provide different looks<br>
to the emails that vary by brands to help perpetuate brand identities.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 4, there is provided an overview of the process for<br>
enrollment into the notification system 100, setting and processing of triggers, and the<br>
subsequent generation and transmission of the notification emails. The subscriber can<br>
enroll via one of several methods, two of which are shown. As one method, the<br>
subscriber can enroll through a website that is either dedicated to this service or<br>
incorporated into a more comprehensive vehicle services website, such as the subscriber<br>
website 190 shown in Fig. 1. A second method is by placing a call from the vehicle to a<br>
WAS live advisor 176 which can be done by using the WAS advisor call button 127<br><br>
involves the VDU setting an initial trigger to generate (504, 506) a welcome email as<br>
shown in Fig. 3, and this will then be followed by automatically triggered periodic emails<br>
(e.g., once eveiy 30 days). For subscribers already enrolled, a call to the WAS center 170<br>
can be used to specially request a notification email or a resend (508, 510) of the most<br>
recent email. This can be done via a button press of pushbutton 127 to access the live<br>
advisor 176 or to access a voice response unit which translates the driver's request into a<br>
command that is sent to the VDU 160 to generate the email notification message.<br>
When enrolling via a web interface, such as the subscriber center 190, the system<br>
authenticates the subscriber via the identification provided by the user login (512) and<br>
from there the relevant vehicle and subscriber data is accessed and displayed for the<br>
subscriber (514). The subscriber can then complete the enrollment process following<br>
which the initial trigger is set in the vehicle that ultimately results in the welcome email<br>
and subsequent email notifications (504, 506).<br>
Portions of the enrollment process can be automated and Fig. 6 depicts greater<br>
detail concerning these features. Initially, the manufacturer hotlines the vehicle's<br>
wireless communication module 122 prior to delivery to the dealer (600). This hotlining<br>
can be carried out through the wireless network carrier and it causes any calls from the<br>
vehicle to be redirected to the vehicle manufacturer for proper setup of the vehicle<br>
wireless account. Prior to delivery to the dealer, the manufacturer can also set a 400 mile<br>
trigger on the vehicle (602) which will be used to help insure that the manufacturer<br>
receives the owner (customer) information and an opportunity to enroll the owner in the<br>
email notification program and other services (WAS, HFC, satellite radio, etc.). When<br>
the vehicle is delivered to the customer, the dealer creates a customer delivery record<br>
(CDR) that is generated (604) and then transmitted to the manufacturer and made<br>
available to the notification system 100. This CDR is used to automatically create a<br>
subscriber account for the vehicle (606). Alternatively, the account can be created using<br>
data obtained from the subscriber via a website (608) such as through the subscriber<br>
center website 190. Once the subscriber account is created (606), the system attempts to<br>
connect to the vehicle (610, 612) and, if not successful, implements a retry strategy (614)<br>
that might involve, for example, another call attempt after a predetermined amount of<br><br>
mounted in the vehicle to initiate a voice call with the advisor. The live advisor 176 then<br>
has computer access to the subscriber's account information and to the VDU 160 for the<br>
purpose of carrying out the enrollment. Other methods of enrollment include a direct<br>
landline call into the VDU 160 or enrollment via the dealer 180 from which the vehicle<br>
was originally purchased or leased. Once enrolled into the service, the VDU 160 initiates<br>
a communication session with the vehicle 110 which, in the disclosed embodiment<br>
involves placing a call to the vehicle wireless communication module 122 via the<br>
wireless communication network 140. During this call, the VDU 160 supplies the<br>
vehicle with one or more triggers. This can include a time based trigger (e.g., monthly)<br>
and/or triggers based on vehicle conditions (e.g., the occurrence of certain DTCs or an oil<br>
life trigger). Then, upon occurrence of a trigger, the vehicle 110 initiates a<br>
communication session (e.g., call) with the VDU 160 and supplies the dynamic vehicle<br>
information needed for the email notification message. The VDU 160 stores this<br>
information either internally in the VDU database 174 and/or provides it to the WAS<br>
database 164 for storage there. The VDU also initiates the EMGS 184 process to build<br>
and then send the email message to the subscriber.<br>
In this embodiment, all triggers are set in the vehicle and all monitoring for the<br>
occurrence of a trigger happens at the vehicle. However, it will be appreciated by those<br>
skilled in the art that at least some of the triggers can be monitored at the VDU end and<br>
then a call placed to the vehicle to obtain the desired diagnostic and other information.<br>
Fig. 5 depicts the process flow involving the subscriber and live advisor 176 in<br>
the enrollment and email generation process. The individual steps shown in Fig. 5 are<br>
referenced below with numerals enclosed in parentheses. Enrollment via the live advisor<br>
involves an initial call from the subscriber to opt into the email notification program<br>
(500). When done via a button press within the vehicle, the needed vehicle specific<br>
information (e.g., VTN) is provided to the live advisor automatically which enables him<br>
or her to access the proper information concerning the vehicle and owner. Much of the<br>
owner information is normally accessible as the result of a customer delivery record<br>
(CDR) executed by the dealer at the time of vehicle sale. Using this information, the live<br>
advisor initiates the email notification program for the subscriber (502), and this typically<br><br>
time or at a predetermined time of day. Once a call to the vehicle is established, the VDU<br>
160 then sets up its configuration for that vehicle (616), sets one or more triggers on the<br>
vehicle (618), and then completes the carrier provisioning (620) for HFC calling, etc.<br>
Apart from that discussed elsewhere in this description, the VDU setup configuration<br>
involves obtaining the station ID (STID) of the vehicle's wireless communication module<br>
122, associating it with the VIN, and enabling the VDU operation for that STID. The<br>
carrier provisioning ends the hotlining and establishes preferred roaming lists and the<br>
like, as will be known to those skilled in the art. The call is then ended and enrollment is<br>
complete (622).<br>
The subscriber can also enroll by pressing the pushbutton 127 in the vehicle (624)<br>
and connecting to the live advisor 176 at the WAS center (626). The live advisor<br>
accesses the system data to determine whether the customer account already exists and<br>
whether the station ID (STID) of the vehicle's wireless communication module 122 is<br>
already entered into the system (628). If not, the customer account can be manually setup<br>
(606) by the live advisor 176 and the initial connection attempt to the vehicle is carried<br>
out in the manner discussed above. If the account and STID are already setup in the<br>
system, then the process proceeds to setup the VDU configuration (616), set the vehicle<br>
triggers (618), and complete the earner provisioning (620).<br>
In the event that no CDR is created and supplied by the dealer at the time of<br>
vehicle delivery, and if the customer does not initiate enrollment and setting up of their<br>
account, the 400 mile trigger set in the vehicle by the manufacturer will initiate a call to<br>
the WAS center 170 when the vehicle odometer has reached 400 miles (630). As with<br>
the live advisor enrollment process, the WAS center 170 checks to determine whether a<br>
customer account already exists and whether the station ID (STID) of the vehicle's<br>
wireless communication module 122 is already entered into the system (628). The<br>
remaining enrollment and setup process is then the same as discussed above in the case of<br>
enrollment using the live advisor.<br>
As will be appreciated from Fig. 6, as long as an account is setup via, for<br>
example, the use of a CDR from the dealer, the enrollment process can be entirely<br><br>
automated. This can be useful for commercial fleets where the purchaser wishes to have<br>
all vehicles uniformly enrolled in the email notification system 100. Automatic<br>
enrollment can then occur either directly following the creation of the account using the<br>
CDR, or can occur as the result of the vehicle calling due to the 400 mile trigger.<br>
Furthermore, apart from using a factory set (400 mile) trigger, an initial trigger can be set<br>
in the vehicle by way of a software robot that can be downloaded into the vehicle system.<br>
When the trigger goes off in each vehicle, the vehicle calls in and the enrollment is<br>
automatically established using the procedure described above. This allows a<br>
commercial entity to purchase a fleet of vehicles and then later enroll them en masse into<br>
the notification system. The equipment and programming needed to use software robots<br>
to download and set these triggers on the vehicle are known by those skilled in the art.<br>
Other aspects that might be unique to fleet management can be included in the<br>
notification system 100. For example, for fleet vehicles equipped with GPS units, the<br>
location of the vehicle can be included in the data provided from the vehicle following a<br>
trigger, and this data can be included in the email notification showing where the vehicle<br>
is located either in coordinates or by mapping the location and including the map<br>
graphically in the email. Triggers can then also be defined that are based on location so<br>
that an email notification is generated and sent when the vehicle arrives at a particular<br>
location or moves outside of a defined geographic region. The email notification<br>
messages can be sent to the driver and fleet manager, or to only one of these.<br>
Furthermore, messages from the fleet managers to the drivers can be combined into the<br>
email notification messages so that, for example, the manager can generate a message to<br>
the drivers which causes the VDU to send an immediate callback trigger to each of the<br>
vehicles. Once a vehicle then calls back, the email notification message to the driver is<br>
generated and the manager's message is included in the email.<br>
As discussed above, once enrollment and VDU configuration is complete in a<br>
typical individual subscriber scenario, an initial 24 hour trigger is set in the vehicle by a<br>
call from the VDU 160 to the vehicle 110. Once this trigger goes off in the vehicle, it<br>
calls back to the VDU 160 under the appropriate conditions (e.g., vehicle ignition ON)<br>
and provides the various vehicle information (mileage, oil life, diagnostic status of<br><br>
vehicle systems, WAS and other account information, etc.) which is then included in the<br>
welcome email that is built by the EMGS 184 and sent to the subscriber. The VDU then<br>
sets one or more additional triggers, preferably during this same call from the vehicle.<br>
These triggers include, for example, a monthly trigger to give the subscriber a complete<br>
vehicle and account status update once a month, as well as an oil life trigger to warn the<br>
subscriber when the remaining oil life is below a predefined amount (e.g., less than 20%<br>
oil life remaining). The oil life trigger can be set to go off when the oil life is below this<br>
threshold or within a range of values (e.g., 19.6% to 20%), but this can result in multiple<br>
triggers (repeat calls from the vehicle) each time it checks the oil life value. These repeat<br>
triggers can be used to send multiple messages to the subscriber or, if that is not desired,<br>
the repetitive triggers can be ignored by the VDU so only one email message is sent to<br>
the subscriber. Alternatively, the oil life trigger can be setup to go off when the oil life<br>
equals a predetermined amount (e.g., trigger goes off when oil life is at 20%, but not<br>
when it is above or below this amount), and this latter approach can be used to avoid<br>
getting repeat calls from the vehicle. Multiple oil life trigger points can be set if desired.<br>
The construction and operation of vehicle systems that monitor and determine remaining<br>
oil life are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Some triggers can be persistent triggers that are not cleared when they go off. For<br>
example, a monthly trigger set in the vehicle to go off on the 15th of each month need not<br>
be cleared, but can be left set as long as monthly triggers are desired. Such a trigger can<br>
be set to go off at a certain time of day so that it only occurs once on the appointed day of<br>
the month. Alternatively, some or all of the triggers can be cleared automatically or by<br>
request of the VDU each time they go off. This provides flexibility in handling different<br>
types of triggers. For example, with an oil life trigger, it can be cleared once it goes off,<br>
and can remain cleared with no new oil life trigger set until the oil is changed and the oil<br>
life goes back up to a reset point, either above the threshold trigger level (e.g., 20%) or to<br>
some higher reset limit (e.g., above 80%, or back to 100%). Once it is determined that<br>
the oil life is back to (or above) the reset point, the oil life trigger is reset which can be<br>
done, for example, by a new oil life trigger being provided by the VDU. Where the<br>
vehicle also uses monthly or other time-based triggers, these triggers can continue to be<br>
processed and used to report oil life regardless of whether the remaining oil life is above<br><br>
or below the threshold value. Thus, for example, oil life notifications can be sent to the<br>
subscriber using the following process:<br>
(a)	determining a remaining oil life by monitoring data at the vehicle;<br>
(b)	sending an oil life value from the vehicle to a central data system when the oil<br>
life falls below a first threshold;<br>
(c)	sending an electronic message to the subscriber using the oil life value<br>
obtained from the central data system;<br>
(d)	monitoring the oil life by iteratively repeating step (a); and<br>
(e)	repeating steps (b) and (c) only after the oil life has exceeded a second<br>
threshold that is greater than the first threshold; and<br>
(f)	periodically repeating the following two steps:<br>
(fl) sending an oil life value from the vehicle to the central data system; and<br>
(£2) sending an electronic message to the subscriber using the oil life value<br>
obtained from the central data system.<br>
The time-based (periodic) emails of step (f) can be carried out and processed<br>
independently of the oil life threshold approach of step (b). By using this method, the<br>
system avoids sending multiple emails due to low oil life yet continues to send the<br>
periodic (e.g., monthly) email reports. Once the oil life returns to the reset point (i.e.,<br>
above the second threshold), then another low oil life email will be sent once that point is<br>
reached. Determination of the resetting of the oil life above the reset point can be done in<br>
any suitable manner, including by monitoring a calculated oil life and comparing it to the<br>
second threshold, or by detecting that the oil has been changed such as by a system reset<br>
carried out at the service station or dealer at the time of vehicle servicing. This process<br>
can be implemented by the use of triggers as discussed above, and the monitoring of oil<br>
life and resetting of the oil life trigger can be done at the back end (VDU) or can occur<br>
automatically at the vehicle so that no new call to the vehicle is needed to reset the oil life<br>
trigger.<br>
When vehicle data is to be transmitted to the VDU as the result of a trigger, this<br>
data is preferably sent by the vehicle during the triggered call that is placed to the VDU<br>
by the vehicle. The desired vehicle data (diagnostic, mileage, etc.) can be pre-specified<br><br>
to the vehicle as a part of the initial setting of the trigger. For example, the vehicle can be<br>
configured at the factory or by subsequent programming to provide particular vehicle<br>
data in response to particular types of triggers. This can be done, for example, using a<br>
lookup table in memory where the particular type of trigger is used to determine the<br>
particular type of diagnostics to run and vehicle data to be returned. Then, when a trigger<br>
occurs, this data is automatically passed to the VDU during the call from the vehicle.<br>
Alternatively, the VDU can specify during a particular triggered call from the vehicle<br>
exactly what data it wants. In this scenario, the particular customizations of the email<br>
notification (e.g., include ABS system diagnostics, but not powertrain) can be used by the<br>
VDU to specify to the vehicle what data it wants so that the vehicle need only transmit<br>
the desired data.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 7, there is shown an exemplary process for handling of the<br>
triggers by the VDU when a call comes in from the vehicle. The basic function of this<br>
routine is to determine what trigger(s) are to be processed (700) and then initiate that<br>
processing. The routine includes lost call handling so that, if the call is dropped or<br>
otherwise lost before being completed (702), a lost call notification is created (704) and a<br>
retry strategy is implemented (706). A lost call can happen, for example, if the vehicle<br>
ignition is turned off during the call, or the wireless communication with the vehicle is<br>
temporarily lost, or the VDU computer system goes offline, or for other reasons. The<br>
retry strategy can involve a set of rules to be followed for lost calls. For example, one<br>
retry strategy is for the vehicle to be responsible for re-calling in the event that the call<br>
never goes through to the point of being established with the VDU. In this instance the<br>
vehicle can retry periodically, e.g., every 10 minutes, or at an appointed time, until the<br>
call gets through. However, in this retry strategy, if the call goes through and connects<br>
with the VDU, but is then dropped before being complete, then the VDU can be<br>
responsible for calling back either periodically or at a certain time. When the call is<br>
initially connected between the vehicle and VDU, either the vehicle's VTN or the wireless<br>
communication module's STID can be given to the VDU and, if successfully received,<br>
this can be used to transfer to the VDU the responsibility of calling back if the call is<br>
dropped. When the VDU calls back, the vehicle data that was to be exchanged as a result<br>
of the trigger can be sent to the VDU. Alternatively, the call back from the VDU can be<br><br>
simply to set a retry trigger so that, again, the vehicle will thereafter place the call that is<br>
used to transmit the desired vehicle information. In either arrangement, the number of<br>
retries can be limited to a certain number, following which an error notification can be<br>
sent to the subscriber and/or WAS live advisor. This retry strategy is exemplary only,<br>
and other retry strategies can be used as desired for a particular application.<br>
There are a variety of trigger types that can be set in the vehicle, some of which<br>
are not used to generate email notifications. Thus, as shown in Fig. 7, the process<br>
determines what type of trigger has been received (708). Of these, only the "Email<br>
Trigger" (710) is used by the VDU to initiate an email notification message via EMGS<br>
184, and that Email Trigger can be one of many different types as discussed above (e.g., a<br>
welcome trigger, monthly notification trigger, oil life trigger). Other non-email<br>
notification types of triggers shown in Fig. 7 include a hands free calling (HFC) 30 day<br>
trigger (712), a deactivate trigger (714), a process retry trigger (716), a business vehicle<br>
manager trigger (718), an auto DTC trigger (720), a monthly auto trigger (722), and an<br>
erase trigger (724). Some of these triggers are used for other systems and services that<br>
are outside of the email notification system. Others can be utilized as part of the<br>
notification system, such as the deactivate trigger (714) that can be set if the subscriber<br>
ends his or her subscription to the notification system program, in which case this trigger<br>
can deactivate the VDU processing for that subscriber's particular vehicle. Similarly, the<br>
erase trigger (724) can be used to erase any existing triggers on the vehicle when the<br>
subscriber terminates their subscription to the email notification system program.<br>
Once a particular trigger is identified and processed in Fig. 7, the system then<br>
checks to see if any additional triggers have occurred that need to be processed (726,<br>
728). If so, the process repeats and, if not, the VDU configuration is updated (730) as the<br>
result of the trigger processing (e.g., new triggers set, etc.).<br>
Fig. 8 is an exemplary flowchart depicting notification processing when an Email<br>
Trigger of Fig. 7 is received. As shown in Fig. 8, the processing is distributed over<br>
various systems, including the VDU 160, a VehComm system (which is a system that<br>
interfaces the VDU to the wireless carrier to send and receive information from the<br><br>
vehicle), the vehicle 110 itself, and the EMGS 184. Assuming the owner is opted into the<br>
email notification system program (800), the particular type of email trigger is identified;<br>
e.g., welcome, monthly, oil life (802). Then, the VDU requests the needed vehicle data<br>
(804) by, for example, requesting that various vehicle diagnostic tests be run. This<br>
* request is validated and processed by the VehComm (806) which then transmits the<br>
diagnostic data request to the vehicle where the diagnostics are performed (808). The<br>
vehicle then returns a diagnostic response (including, for example, DTCs), and this<br>
diagnostic data is then converted into diagnostic results (810) and passed to the VDU to<br>
be supplied to the EMGS for inclusion in the email in the manner discussed above in<br>
connection with Fig. 3.<br>
In some cases, it may not be desirable to send the subscriber an email even though<br>
a desired trigger has gone off. This may be, for example, because it is not desirable to<br>
inundate the subscriber with too many emails from the system. Thus, the system can<br>
check the number of emails sent to the subscriber within the last 30 days (812) and, if that<br>
number is more than one (814), the system can simply ignore the trigger in the sense that<br>
no email is generated (816). If there has not been more than one email recently sent, then<br>
the system then instructs the EMGS to build and send the email (818). Failed sent<br>
message handling (820) can be built into the system as well, and a retry strategy can be<br>
used for this was well, such as resending the email or setting a retry trigger on the vehicle<br>
(822) so that, rather than simply resending the email a day or so later, the system can<br>
process a new trigger to get the most up-to-date information available from the vehicle.<br>
Failed attempts to send the email to the user can be logged and a notice placed on the<br>
subscriber center website 190 or MyWAS 188, or sent to the live advisor, or even sent to<br>
the vehicle and either noted to the driver via a voice message or displayed on a driver<br>
information center if the vehicle is so equipped.<br>
A number of other features can be included in the email notification system.<br>
Sometimes, a trigger actually occurs at a time when it is not possible or desirable for the<br>
vehicle to call into the VDU. However, the trigger can be time-stamped by the vehicle so<br>
that, when the vehicle next calls the VDU, the exact time that the trigger occurred can be<br>
given to the VDU. This can also be used to set the system so that calls from the vehicle<br><br>
always occur at a certain time or event (e.g., at vehicle start-up). Apart from the<br>
subscriber receiving emails as the result of triggers, the system can allow the user to<br>
specifically request an email at any time. As discussed above, this can be by way of a<br>
burton press of pushbutton 127 on the vehicle (either by requesting an email from a live<br>
advisor or by using a voice response unit). Alternatively, the subscriber can request this<br>
by sending an email to, for example, the EMGS or WAS. The email can be sent to an<br>
address of the form <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d98f909799bdb6b4b8b0b7f7adb5bd">[email&#160;protected]</a>, where the VTN is the vehicle identification number<br>
and domain.tld is the domain of the email handling facility. This email message can be<br>
used to instruct the VDU to automatically generate an immediate trigger that is sent to the<br>
vehicle, executed, and the results returned to the subscriber via the email notification<br>
message, so that the subscriber gets a quick vehicle status update. This can be useful, for<br>
example, to check the vehicle before leaving on vacation. Preferably, each of the emails<br>
sent to the subscriber are also provided to the WAS system so that they are accessible to<br>
the live advisor.<br>
Apart from retry strategies that are used when a call is dropped, the VDU can also<br>
be programmed to monitor for anticipated triggers from each vehicle so that, for example,<br>
if a vehicle is supposed to be calling in on a monthly trigger, but does not, the VDU can<br>
call the vehicle to determine its availability and set a new trigger to obtain diagnostic<br>
data, etc.<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
TITLE: ' A METHOD OF PROVIDING VEHICLE INFORMATION TO AN<br>
OWNER AND OTHER RECIPIENT'<br>
The invention relates to a vehicle email notification system and method I which<br>
templates are used to automatically generate email messages that provide the<br>
recipient with diverse types of dynamic vehicle information. The email<br>
notifications are triggered by different events , some of which are independent of<br>
the vehicle (e.g. a monthly trigger), and others of which occur at the vehicle,<br>
such as a mileage or low oil life trigger. The notification system selects an<br>
appropriate template based on the type of trigger and uses the template to build<br>
and send to the subscriber an email message that contains the dynamic vehicle<br>
information and identifies any detected vehicle condition for which action is<br>
needed. In addition to trigger type, different templates can be defined for each<br>
combination of vehicle type, trigger type, and a language preference.</td>
