DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of vehicle seat 10 attached with vehicle seat tracks 11. Vehicle seat tracks 11 permit vehicle seat 10 to move as indicated by arrow. In the embodiment of Figure 1, vehicle seat 10 is moved manually. In other embodiments, vehicle seat 10 may be moved automatically.<br>
Figure 2 is a perspective view of a portion of vehicle seat track 11 showing lower track 12 and upper track 14. Lower track 12 may be attached, e.g.,<br><br>
bolted, with a vehicle (not shown). Upper track 14 moves along lower track 12. Upper track 14 is attached, e.g., fastened, with vehicle seat 10 such that as upper track 14 moves along lower track 12, vehicle seat 10 moves along lower track 12.<br>
As described below, latch assembly 16 selectively locks upper track 14 in place relative to lower track 12 as upper track 14 moves along lower track 12. Upper track 14 includes through holes 17 which permit latch assembly 16 to be mechanically attached, e.g., pinned, with upper track 14.<br>
Figure 3A is a side view of latch assembly 16 showing latch assembly 16 locked with web 24. Web 24 is attached, e.g., bolted, welded, with lower track 14. Latch assembly 16 includes upper housing 18 and lower housing 20. Upper housing 18 and lower housing 20 snap fit together at snap fit location 21. In alternative embodiments, latch assembly 16 may include a one-piece housing or a multi-piece housing. Lower housing 20 includes lower housing holes 26 which, in combination with upper track holes 17, permit latch assembly 16 to be attached, e.g., bolted, with upper track 14. Latch assembly 16 also includes tapered locks 22 and key pin 28. Locks 22 selectively lock with web 24 as latch assembly 16 and upper track 14 move along lower track 12. Key pin 28 moves locks 22 between locked and unlocked positions. Key pin 28 may be operatively attached with any conventional seat adjust lever system (not shown) such that an occupant may directly or indirectly move the seat lever up (or down depending on the system) to move key pin 28 and thus locks 22 from the locked to the unlocked position. If the occupant holds locks 22 in the unlocked position via the seat lever, the occupant may move seat 10 along lower tracks 12.<br>
Figure 3B is a end view, in cross-section, of lower track 12, upper track 14, and web 24 taken along section line 3B-3B of Figure 3A. Bearings 25 facilitate the movement of upper track 14 as it moves relative to lower track 12 and web 24. In alternative embodiments, tracks 12, 14 may have any desired configuration.<br><br>
Figure 4 is a perspective view of a portion of web 24 showing holes 40 and partitions 42. As described below, locks 22 of latch assembly 16 selectively engage portions of web 24 as latch assembly 16 and upper track 14 move relative to lower track 12 and web 24.<br>
Figure 5 is a perspective view, in cross-section, of latch assembly 16 and web 24 showing locks 22 in the locked position. Latch assembly 16 includes coil springs 30 which snap to snap features 32 of upper housing 18. Locks 22 include shaped features 34 to receive portions of coil springs 30. As locks 22 move from the locked to the unlocked position, coil springs 30 compress, storing energy for later use in moving the locks from the unlocked to locked position. As locks 22 move from the unlocked to the locked position, coil springs 30 decompress. Locks 22 each include key way 36 which allows key pin 28 to pass through locks 22. As described above, key pin 28 may move up or down in slot 38 thus moving locks 22 between the locked and unlocked positions. Lower housing 20 includes aligning ways 39 that are shaped to align, e.g., limit the horizontal movement of, locks 22 as they move relative to web 24. In alternative embodiments, the housing may be configured differently and some other element, if present, may act to align locks 22.<br>
Figure 6A is a bottom view of lower housing 20, locks 22, and web 24. Locks 22 are in the locked position and are on either side of partition 42. In this position, latch assembly 16 and upper track 14 are not free to move relative to lower track 12. In the embodiment of Figure 6A, locks 22 have a circular cross-section. In alternative embodiments, locks 22 may have any desired cross-section, e.g., square.<br>
Figure 6B is a bottom view of lower housing 20, locks 22, and web 24. Locks 22 are in the locked position, each are within the same hole 40, and each are adjacent a partition 42, In this position, latch assembly 16 and upper track 14 are not free to move relative to lower track 12.<br>
Figure 7A is a side view, in cross-section, of locks 22 and web 24 showing locks 22 in the locked position and on either side of partition 42. In this<br><br>
position, latch assembly and upper track 14 are not free to move relative to lower track 12.<br>
Figure 7B is a side view, in cross-section, of locks 22 and web 24 showing one of locks 22 in the unlocked position and in contact with partition 42 and the other of locks 22 in the locked position. In this position, latch assembly 16 and upper track 14 are free to move relative to lower track 14 until lock 22 in the unlocked position drops into the locked position in one of holes 40.<br>
Figure 7C is a side view, in cross-section, of locks 22 and web 24 showing locks 22 in the locked position and each in contact with a partition 42. In this position, latch assembly and upper track 14 are not free to move relative to lower track 12.<br>
While embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it is not intended that these embodiments illustrate and describe all possible forms of the invention. Rather, the words used in the specification are words of description rather than limitation, and it is understood that various changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
