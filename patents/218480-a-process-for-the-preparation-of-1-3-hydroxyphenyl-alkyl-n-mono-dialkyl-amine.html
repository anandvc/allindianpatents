COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10) <br>
A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF  1(-3-HYDROXYPHENYL) ALKYL- (N-MONO/DIALKYL) AMINE<br>
SUN PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES LTD.<br>
A company incorporated under the laws of India having their office at ACME PLAZA, ANDHERI-KURLA ROAD, ANDHERI (E), MUMBAI-400059, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF l-(3-HYDROXYPHENYL) ALKYL- (N-MONO / DIALKYL) AMINE<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of l-(3-hydroxyphenyl) alky]- (N-mono/dialky]) amine of formula I,<br><br>
wherein R1 is a lower alkyl that may be linear or branched or cyclic; allyl, propargyl or benzyl: R2 is hydrogen or lower alkyl, R3 is hydrogen or lower alkyl or R2 and R3 together with the nitrogen to which they are attached may-form a cyclic moiety of three to eight members, with or without a hetero atom like nitrogen or oxygen or sulfur.<br>
The l-(3-hydroxyphenyl) alkyl- (N-mono/dialkyl)amine of formula I may be used as an intermediate in the preparation of phenyl carbamates of formula HI, that are useful as pharmaceutical agents producing anticholinesterase activity in the central nervous system, <br>
Formula III<br>
—wherein R1 ,R2, R3 are as mentioned above ;  R4 is hydrogen, lower alkyl, cyclohexyl,<br>
 allyl or benzyl; and R5 is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or propyl; optionally R4 and R5 may, together with the nitrogen to which they are attached, form a morpholino or piperidino radical<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The process for the preparation of l-(3-hydroxyphenyl) alkyl- (N-mono/dialkyl) amine of formula I from l-(3-methoxyphenyl) alkyl- (N-mono/dialkyl) amine by demethylation is known in the prior art. For example, J. Labelled Comp. And Radiopharm., 1997, 39(8), 651-668    involving a final step of-demethylation of the methoxy function of l-(3-methoxyphenyl) ethyl-(N,N-aimethyl)amine, using hydrobromic acid in the presence of hexadecyltributyl phosphonium bromide as the phase transfer catalyst, to yield l-(3-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl- (N, N-dimethyl) amine. The use of hydrobromic acid, with or without the use of phase transfer catalysts, for demethylation of the methoxy function has a disadvantage in that the quality of the final product is not satisfactory due to-a number of impurities formed in the reacion   and tne use of expensive reagents such as phase transfer catalysts. The present invention is advantageous over this prior art since cheaper reagents like sulfuric acid are used and phase transfer catalysts related  drawbacks like low  thermal  stability,  hygroscopicity,  separation  problems  and reusability are not encountered.<br>
European Patent No. 359647(Indian reference not available) discloses a process for the preparation of morphinane derivatives involving demethylation of 3-methoxylated compounds using a sulphonic acid chosen from among methanesulphonic acid and trifluoromethanesulphonic acid, in tne presence of a sulphide. However, the disadvantage of using sulfonic acid such as methanesulfonic acid is that it is a very expensive reagent and large volumes of the acid are required to isolate the final product. Further, this prior art does not specifically provide the intermediate made by the process of the present invention.<br><br>
There exists a need for a process for the preparation of l-(3-hydroxyphenyi) alky!-(N-mono/dialkyl)amines such that the process utilizes easily available starting materials, simple reagents and standard reaction conditions. The process should result in l-(3-hydroxyphenyI)alkyi-(N-mono/dialkyl)amines of satisfactory quality, in a satisfactory<br>
yield.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of l-(3-hydroxypheny!) a]kyJ-(N-mono/dialkyl)amine, wherein readily available starting material such as l-(3-alkoxyphenyl) aIkyl-(N-mono/dialkyl)amine, compound of formula H wherein R maybe selected from methyl, ethyl and benzyl, is subjected to dealkylation using simple reagents. The process of the present invention yields the l-(3-hydroxyphenyl) alkyl-(N-mono/dialkyl)amine in a satisfactory quality and quantity.<br>
A more specific object is to provide a process for the preparation of l-(3-hydroxy phenyl)ethyr-(N,N"-dimethyl)arnine by demethylation of compound of formula II (wherein R is methyl).<br>

eight members, with or without a hetero atom like nitrogen or oxygen or sulfur; comprising dealkylating compound of formula II<br><br>
wherein R is methyl, ethyl or benzyl; R , R and R are as defined above, said dealk-ylation comprising reaction of compound of formula II with a mixture of thioether and mineral acid.<br>
