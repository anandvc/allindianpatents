				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
DIAMINE DERIVATIVES, PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE SAME, AND PLANT DISEASE CONTROL AGENTS CONTAINING THE SAME AS ACTIVE<br>
INGREDIENTS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to new diamine derivatives, process for producing them, and plant disease control agents containing them as active ingredients.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The pest control plays an important role in cultivating paddy rice.  In particular, a rice blast is a significant disease.  Therefore, various plant disease control agents have been developed and put into use.  However, every agent does not have a satisfactory plant disease control activity, nor is at a satisfactory level with respect to harm to useful crops.  In recent years, fungi having resistance to chemical agents have appeared due to a heavy use of plant disease control agents and, sometimes, known chemical agents do not have satisfactory activities.  Accordingly, a new plant disease control agent capable of controlling harmful fungi at a low agent concentration has been required.  Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2003-096046 discloses diamine<br>
 <br>
derivatives different from the compounds of the present invention and plant disease control agents containing them as active ingredients.  However, in this document, there is no description on the usefulness of diamine derivatives including an oxycarbonyl group having a halogenated hydrocarbon.<br>

The plants were put into an artificial weather room (set conditions: 22°C, 12-hour daik light cycle) and spray-inoculated with a suspension of Pyriculc/rid oryzae spores. The artificial weather room was<br>
<br>
kept at high humidity, and the examination was conducted after<br>
7days.<br>
