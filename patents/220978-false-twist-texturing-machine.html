The invention relates to a false twist texturing machine for false twist texturing a plurality of synthetic filament yarns,<br>
DE 3324243 relates to a false-twist crimping machine and process for bridging brief voltage losses on textile machines and EP 0389849 relates to a control system for a textile machine.<br>
It is known to use false twist texturing machines of this type for texturing melt-spun multifilament yarns, and to thus reproduce, if possible, yarns that are similar to natural fibers in their structure and appearance. To this end, the false twist texturing machine comprises a plurality of processing stations. In each processing station, at least one yarn is treated for its improvement by a plurality of processing units. In this process, the yarn is essentially drawn and textured in a false twist zone, and wound to a package after texturing. The processing units, such as, for example, feed roll systems, heaters, cooling devices, and false twist texturing units are arranged on a machine frame to form a station, so that a predetermined yarn path results in the processing stations. Such a false twist texturing machine is disclosed, for example, in WO 01/92615. In the known false twist texturing machine, the plurality of processing stations is divided into a plurality of sections. Thus, for example, the use of a plurality of 216 processing stations permits forming, for example, 18 sections with 12 processing stations each. To<br><br>
increase flexibility, the processing sections* xn unc known false twist texturing machine are controllable independently of one another.  To this end, the processing sections are constructed such that in each processing station a station setup is realized for purposes of being able to texture a yarn in an optimal manner with a defined yarn path and predetermined yarn treatments.<br>
New development tendencies in the improvement of yarn by false twist texturing, as are disclosed, for example, in EP 1 103 641 Al and EP 1 202 848 Al, show an increased interest in so-called novelty yarns, which t can be produced by a false twist texturing process. This requires additional treatment steps in the yarn path, which the known false twist texturing machine is unable to realize without incurring problems.  Until now, the production of novelty yarns has remained with air texturing machines, as disclosed, for example, in DE 36 23 370 Al.  Such texturing machines possess few processing stations with individually driven and adjustable processing units, so that it is possible to operate the processing stations individually.  This kind of great flexibility cannot be economically realized in false twist texturing machines because of the plurality of processing stations.  On the contrary, false twist texturing machines are based on  the concept of driving processing units in groups for purposes of keeping the costs for drives and control within limits.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to further develop false twist texturing machines of the described type, so that a flexible use is possible for producing textured yarns of different types and structures.<br><br>
The object of the invention is accomplished by a false twist texturing machine for false twist texturing a plurality of synthetic filament yams with processing stations divided into a plurality of processing sections, with each of the processing sections comprising a station setup with a plurality of processing units for withdrawing yarns associated to the processing section parallel from feed yam packages, for texturing, drawing and winding them to packages, characterized in that the station setups of the processing sections are constructed different in the number and/or the type of processing units.<br>
Advantageous further developments of the invention are defined by the features and feature combinations as described herein.<br>
The invention departs from the proviso that a false twist texturing machine with a plurality of processing stations be used exclusively for producing a certain yam. On the contrary, the invention is directed to enabling in a false twist texturing machine the production of different yam types parallel to one another in side-by-side relationship. To this end, the false twist texturing machine of the invention is realized with different station setups in groups of processing sections. The station setups of the processing sections differ in number and/or type of processing units, which are needed for guiding and treating one or several yams. A station setup means the arrangement of the processing units within a processing section, which are necessary for withdrawing, texturing, and drawing the yarns that are associated to the processing section. Thus, it would be possible to achieve an additional treatment of the yams in one of the processing sections, in that one includes additional processing units in the station setup of the group of processing stations, such as, for example, additional heaters. However, different treatments of the yams associated to the processing sections can also be achieved alone in that the number of the processing units is the same within the station setup, but that the type of processing units of at least one group differs from the type of processing units of another group. For example, it would be<br><br>
possible that in one of the processing sections, tne processing sections provided for heat treatment are so-called contact heaters, wherein the yarn is treated in contact with a heated surface.  In an adjacent processing section, however, one could use heating devices, wherein the yarns are heated in a noncontacting way.  In these heating devices, also known as so-called high temperature heaters, the yarns advance over a highly heated surface without contacting it.  With that, the invention has the special advantage that the plurality of the processing stations that are divided into groups can be used in a flexible manner for processing yarns.  It is thus possible to produce in an advantageous manner with one machine different yarns at the same time.<br>
To further improve the flexibility in the use of the false twist texturing machine according to the invention, at least one portion of the processing units is held within the station setups of the processing sections by processing modules, which are exchangeably mounted to a section of the machine frame that is constructed as a module frame.  This makes it possible to modify the station setup of the processing section in a simple manner.<br>
In this connection, it will be especially advantageous, when the module frame according to an advantageous further development of the false twist texturing machine can be optionally provided per processing section with one or more processing modules. The processing modules mount at least one group of processing units, which perform each a process step in the processing stations of the processing section. Thus, the selection and composition of a plurality of processing modules permit producing in an advantageous<br><br>
manner types of yarn that are formed. Dy a piuranuy of filaments. With that, a flexible station setup exists for integrating additional processing units, which are needed via-a-vis a standard process for producing special novelty yarns.<br>
According to a particularly advantageous further development of the invention, each processing module comprises an electric distributor, which connects to the processing units of the processing module, and which comprises inputs and outputs for an electric coupling of the processing units.  This makes it possible to greatly reduce on the one hand the cabling requirements for supplying individual processing units within the processing sections, and to greatly simplify on the other hand the exchange of individual processing modules by simply separating plug connections between supply lines and the electric distributor.<br>
The drivable processing units, which are largely formed by feed roll systems, are preferably operated by individual drives.  These individual drives are supplied and controlled via the electric distributor.  In this connection, a group frequency changer controls all individual drives of the processing units that are accommodated on the processing module.  However it is also possible to associate on the processing module, a frequency changer directly to each individual drive.<br>
It has shown that the different treatments for producing different yarn types substantially occur in the yarn feed phase of the process.  From this recognition, an advantageous further development of the false twist texturing machine according to the invention provides that the module frame is arranged in<br><br>
the inlet region of the machine, and that it mounts within the station setups of the processing sections, the group of the processing units, which withdraws a yarn from a feed yarn package. Such processing units are formed by withdrawal roll systems.<br>
To further increase the flexibility in particular in the inlet region of the machine, the processing modules are advantageously equipped in each processing station with additional receiving devices, which permit optionally integrating additional processing units in the processing module within the processing station.<br>
For each processing station, additional feed systems, draw pins, entanglement devices and/or yarn feed points may be optionally provided as additional processing units. Thus, for example, the yarn feed point permits supplying on the processing module, a second yarn to the process for producing a composite yarn in the processing station. A draw pin or an entanglement device would permit treating before the false twist texturing step in addition a yarn that has been unwound by the withdrawal roll system.<br>
To enable the operability of the processing units within the false twist machine in a simple manner, an advantageous further development of the invention provides for an operator aisle between the module frame and a processing frame. In this development, the processing frame mounts at least one portion of the processing units, such as the false twist unit and feed roll systems. Preferably, one operator is able to operate the processing units from the operator aisle toward both sides.<br>
The further developments of the invention ensure   that the   yarns<br><br>
advancing in the false twist texturing machine do not cross one another.  The yarn path with few deflections within a processing station makes it possible to guide the yarn, irrespective of its type, in a very stable and short threadline.  The arrangement of the heater and the cooling device above the operator aisle has in addition the advantage that an adequate length can be realized for heat treating and cooling the false twist yarn.  The processing and takeup frames that are combined to one  frame section, make it additionally possible to realize a compact construction of the false twist texturing machine.<br>
To change the adjustment of the process parameters, such as withdrawal speeds, draw ratios, or heater settings in a simple manner, the processing units forming the station setup of one of the processing sections are controlled and monitored independently of the processing units of the adjacent procession section.  To this end, it is preferred to associate to each processing section a field control unit, which is used to define and modify all process parameters within the group.<br>
In the following the invention is described in greater detail with reference to an embodiment and to the attached drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic top view of an embodiment of a false twist texturing machine according to the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic cross sectional view of a processing station of a processing section in the embodiment of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 schematically illustrates views of a processing module of the processing section according to Figure 2;<br><br>
Figure 4 is a schematic cross sectional view of the processing station of another processing section of the embodiment of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 5 schematically illustrates views of processing modules of the processing section according to Figure 4;<br>
Figure 6 schematically illustrates views of further embodiments of processing modules; and<br>
Figure 7 schematically illustrates views of further embodiments of processing modules.<br>
Figure 1 schematically illustrates a top view of an embodiment of a false twist texturing machine according to the invention.  The false twist texturing machine comprises a machine frame 4.  The machine frame 4 is formed by a module frame 4.1, a processing frame 4.2, and a takeup frame 4.3, which are rigidly interconnected.  A separate creel frame 7 extends in spaced relationship with module frame 4.1.<br>
In the machine frame 4, a plurality of processing stations 1.1, 1,2, 1.3, etc. are arranged in the longitudinal direction parallel to one another in side-by-side relationship.  Normally, a false twist texturing machine is provided with over 200 processing stations, preferably 218 processing stations.  In the embodiment shown in Figure 1, only the first three processing stations are identified, for example, by numerals 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3.  In each of the processing stations at least one yarn is processed.  The plurality of processing stations is divided into a plurality of processing sections 2.  In the embodiment shown in Figure 1, 12 juxtaposed processing stations 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc. form each one processing section 2.  To this end, Figure 1 shows, for example, the first two processing sections 2.1 and 2.2, as well as in part a<br><br>
third processing section 2.3.  Each processing section 2.1/ 2.2, 2.3, etc. includes a plurality of processing units, which are accommodated in the machine frame 4 to a station setup for parallel withdrawing from feed yarn packages yarns that are associated to the processing stations of the processing section, for texturing, drawing, and winding them to packages.<br>
Figure 1 schematically illustrates only a portion of the processing units provided in the processing section or in the individual processing stations and bearing the numerals 10, 11, 12, 13/ 16, and 18.  Numeral 10 identifies a group of withdrawal roll systems, with one withdrawal roll system being associated to each processing station for withdrawing a yarn 38 from a feed yarn package 8.  The feed yarn package 8 is accommodated in creel frame 7.  For drawing and texturing, the yarn 38 advances in a processing station, for example, processing station 1.1, to a false twist zone, which is formed by primary heater 10, cooling device 12, and false twist texturing unit 13,  Subsequently, the yarn 38 undergoes in each of the processing stations a heat aftertreatment, which is performed by secondary heater 16.  At the end of its processing, the yarn 38 is wound in takeup device 18 to a package 21 that is held in a package holder 46.  The take up devices 18 occupy a width of three processing stations.  For this reason, as will be described in greater detail further below, three takeup devices are arranged on top of one another to form a column in the takeup frame 4.3.<br>
To control the processing units that are shown in Figure 1 only in part at numerals 10, 11, 13, 16, and 18, a field control unit 42 is associated to each processing section.  Thus, the field control unit<br><br>
42.1 is associated to processing section 2.1, and field control unit 42.2 to processing section 2.2.  The field control units 42.1 and 42.2, as well as the field control units of subsequent processing sections not shown in greater detail connect to a machine control unit 43.  With that, it is possible to control and monitor the processing units of a processing section independently of the processing units of an adjacent processing section.<br>
The processing sections 2 of the false twist texturing machine have each a certain station setup for processing the yarns that are supplied to the processing section.  In the following, the station setup of processing section 2.1 is described with reference to a cross sectional view of a processing station of this processing section as shown in Figure 2.  The station setup of processing station 2.2 is described with reference to the cross sectional view of one of the processing stations of this processing section as shown in Figure 4.<br>
Figure 2 schematically illustrates a cross sectional view of a processing station 1 of processing section 2.1.  The processing units that are arranged in the machine frame 4 to form a station setup, include a withdrawal roll system 10, a primary heater 11, a cooling device 12, a false twist texturing unit 13, a draw roll system 14, an entanglement device 40, a set roll system 15, a secondary heater 16, a feed roll system 17, and a takeup device 18.  The processing units are arranged one following the other to form a yarn path.<br>
In the processing section 2.1, each processing station comprises a withdrawal roll system 10.  The withdrawal roll systems 10 of the processing<br><br>
section 2.1 are arranged on a processing module 3.1. The processing module 3.1 is mounted to the module frame 4.1.  Both the configuration of the processing module and the type of the module frame 4.1 are described in greater detail in the following.<br>
One of the feed yarn packages 8 arranged in the creel frame 7 is associated to each of the withdrawal roll systems.  In the creel frame 7, a reserve yarn package 44 is associated to each of the feed yarn packages 8, with the trailing yarn end of feed yarn package 8 being knotted to the leading yarn end of reserve yarn package 44.  From the feed yarn package 8, the withdrawal roll system 10 unwinds the yarn 38 via a yarn guide 45 and yarn guides 9.1 and 9.2.<br>
In the following, the further processing units in the station setup are described with reference to the path of the yarn 38 within the processing station of processing section 2.1.  In the direction of the advancing yarn downstream of the withdrawal roll system 10, the elongate primary heater 11 extends, through which the yarn 38 advances and is heated to a certain temperature.  The primary heater 11 could be constructed as a high-temperature heater, wherein the heating surface temperature is more than 300°C.  In this case, it would be preferred to heat the yarn 38 without contacting the heated surface.  In the present embodiment, the primary heater possesses two parallel tracks, so that the yarns 38 of two adjacent processing stations advance simultaneously through the primary heater 11.<br>
In the direction of the advancing yarn downstream of primary heater 11, the cooling device 12 is provided.  In the present embodiment, the primary<br><br>
heater 11 and cooling device 12 extend in one plane, one following the other, above the module frame 4,1 and processing frame 4,2, with an operator aisle 5 being formed between the module frame 4.1 and processing frame 4.2.  In the inlet region of the primary heater 11, a yarn guide 9.3 is arranged, preferably in the form of a deflection roll, so that the yarn 38 advances from the module frame 4.1 along a V-shaped path to the processing frame 4.2.  However, it would also be possible to configure the station setup such that the primary heater 11 and the cooling device 12 are arranged in two planes that extend relative to each other in the shape of a roof.<br>
On the side facing the module frame 4.1, the processing frame 4.2 is arranged.  The processing frame 4.2 successively mounts in the direction of the advancing yarn, the false twist texturing unit 13, draw roll system 14, entanglement device 40, and set roll system 15.  The yarn 38 advances from the outlet of cooling device 12, which is preferably a cooling rail, to the false twist texturing unit 13.  The false twist texturing unit 13, which may be formed, for example, by a plurality of overlapping friction disks, is driven by a false twist drive 26.  Preferably, the false twist drive 26 is an electric motor, which is likewise mounted to the processing frame.<br>
The draw roll system 14 withdraws the yarn 38 from the false twist zone that forms between the false twist texturing unit 13 and the withdrawal roll system 10.  The draw roll system 14 and withdrawal roll system 10 are driven, at different speeds for drawing the yarn 38 in the false twist zone.<br>
Downstream of the draw roll system 14, the yarn 38 advances through entanglement device 40.  The<br><br>
set roll system 15 guides the yarn 38 into the secondary heater 16. To this end, the secondary heater 16 is arranged on the underside of processing frame 4.2 and takeup frame 4.3, which are both combined to a frame section. The secondary heater 16 forms the yarn passage from the processing frame 4.2 to the takeup frame 4.3, thereby realizing a very compact construction.<br>
The underside of takeup frame 4.3 mounts feed roll system 17, which withdraws the yarn 38 directly from the secondary heater 16, and advances the yarn 38, after deflecting it, to the takeup device 18. The set roll system 15 and the feed roll system 17 are driven at different speeds, so as to enable a shrinkage treatment of the yarn 38 within the secondary heater 16. In this connection, a biphenyl-heated contact heater could form the secondary heater 16.<br>
In the present embodiment, a yarn traversing device 20, a drive roll 19, a package holder 46 (not shown), and a package 21 schematically identify takeup device 18. In addition, the takeup device 18 includes a tube magazine 22 for performing an automatic package doff. Auxiliary devices as are needed for doffing fully wound packages are not shown in greater detail. In the takeup frame 4.3, a total of three takeup devices 18 of adjacent processing stations overlie one another in tiers. The takeup devices of the processing section form a longitudinal side of the machine, with a doffing aisle 6 extending over the length thereof. From the doffing aisle 6, the full packages can be removed.<br>
The feed roll systems 10, 14, 15, and 17 in the station setup of<br>
processing section 2.1 are identical in their arrangement, so that same is<br>
described in the following by referring to the example	<br><br>
of withdrawal roll system 10.  Each feed roll system is formed by a godet 23 and a guide roll 24 associated therewith.  The godet 23 is driven via an individual drive 25.  Preferably, the individual drive 25 is formed by an electric motor.  The guide roll 24 is supported for free rotation, with the yarn 38 advancing over the godet 23 in a plurality of loops.<br>
In the processing stations, the station setup of processing section 2,1 as shown in Figure 2 comprises processing units for drawing and texturing a fed yarn 38 by a basic method.  To this end, the withdrawal roll system 10 unwinds the yarn 38 from the feed yarn package 8, and advances it into the false twist zone.  The false twist texturing unit 13 at the end of the false twist zone imparts to the yarn 38 a false twist, which returns as far back as the primary heater 11.  Within the primary heater 11 and cooling device 12, the crimp produced in the multifilament yarn 38 by texturing undergoes a setting.  From the false twist zone, the yarn 38 is withdrawn and drawn by draw roll system 14.  To this end, the draw roll system 14 is driven at a higher speed than the withdrawal roll system 10.  After the texturing step, the yarn 38 undergoes further treatment by entangling and heating. Subsequently, the yarn 38 is wound to a package 21.<br>
To operate the machine, an operator aisle 5 is formed between the module frame 4.1 and the processing frame 4.2.  This permits operating the processing units on module frame 4.1 and the processing units on processing frame 4.2 advantageously by one operator from, the operator aisle 5.  For receiving and removing the packages 21, a doffing aisle 6 is provided on the longitudinal side of the takeup frame 4.3.<br><br>
To describe in greater detail the station setup of processing section 2.1 in the inlet region of the machine, Figure 3 illustrates some views of a cutout of module frame 4.1 of processing section 2.1. While Figure 3.1 is front view of the processing module 3.1, Figure 3.2 illustrates a rear view of processing module 3.1.  The following description will apply to both Figures, unless explicit reference is made to one of the Figures.<br>
The processing module 3.1 is exchangeably arranged on  module frame 4.1 via a plurality of mounting elements 27.  In this connection, the module frame 4.1 comprises a plurality of module locations 47. Altogether, three module locations 47.1, 47.2, and 47.3 are realized on module frame 4.1.  The module location 47.1 mounts processing module 3.1.  The processing module 3.1 of processing section 2.1 includes the group of withdrawal roll systems 10.  Figures 3.1 and 3.2 illustrate respectively three adjacent withdrawal roll systems 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3.  Each of the withdrawal roll systems 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3 is driven by an individual drive 25.1, 25.2, and 25.3.  Thus, individual drive 25.1 drives withdrawal roll system<br>
10.1,	and individual drive 25.2 withdrawal roll system<br>
10.2,	Each of the withdrawal roll systems 10.1, 10.2,<br>
10.3,	etc. of the processing stations unwinds a yarn 38<br>
from a feed yarn package via the yarn guide 9.1.  On<br>
processing module 3.1, all individual drives 25 of the<br>
withdrawal roll systems 10 connect to an electric<br>
distributor 48.  The electric distributor 48 possesses<br>
a plurality of plug connections 49.  Via the plug<br>
connections 49 and electric distributor 48, the<br>
individual drives 25 of the withdrawal roll systems 10<br>
are electrically linked up.  To this end, it is<br><br>
preferred to control the individual drives 25 via a group frequency changer.  The group frequency changer could be a component of the electric distributor 48, or be externally arranged in an electronic unit associated to one of the processing sections 2.1,<br>
The station setup of the adjacent processing section 2,2 of the embodiment is shown in Figure 4 by way of a cross sectional view of a processing station of processing section 2.2.  The station setup of processing section 2.2 is largely identical with the station setup of processing section 2.1, so that the foregoing description is herewith incorporated by reference, and that in the following only differences in the station setup are described.  Because of simplicity, components of the same function are identified by like numerals.<br>
In the inlet region of processing section 2.2, the module frame 4.1 mounts two processing modules 3.1 and 3.2 one below the other.  The processing module 3.1 holds the withdrawal roll systems 10 of the processing stations of processing section 2.2.  The setup of processing module 3.1 is identical with the processing module arranged in the adjacent processing section 2.1.  To this extent, the foregoing description is herewith incorporated by reference.  The second processing module 3.2 accommodates in each processing station, a feed roll system 29 and a yarn feed point 36.  In each processing station, the yarn feed point 36 on processing module 3.2 mounts a feed yarn package 37, which supplies an additional yarn 39.  The additional yarn 39 is withdrawn by feed roll system 29 on processing module 3.2, and supplied to draw roll system 14 by means of deflection rolls 41.1 and 41.2 arranged above the operator aisle 5.  In the entanglement device<br><br>
40 downstream of draw roll system 14, the additional yarn and yarn 38 are combined to a composite yarn.<br>
The station setup of processing section 2.2 thus includes additional processing units for producing a composite yarn in each of the associated processing stations of processing section 2.2.  For example, an elastan yarn could be added as additional yarn to the crimped yarn.  To this end, the withdrawal roll system 10 unwinds the yarn 38 in each of the processing stations of processing section 2.2, and supplies it to the false twist zone.  In each of the processing stations, the feed roll system 29 withdraws the additional yarn 39 from feed yarn package 37 via a yarn guide 35 arranged on processing module 3.2.  To his end, the feed yarn package 37 is arranged in yarn feed point 36 of processing module 3.2.  The additional yarn 39 advances via deflection rolls 41.1 and 41.2, past the false twist zone, directly to the draw roll system 14.  After texturing and drawing the yarn 38, the yarn 38 and additional yarn 39 are combined in the entanglement device 40,  After a heat treatment in the secondary heater 16, the thus-produced composite yarn is wound to a package 21.<br>
Figures 5.1 and 5.2 schematically illustrate different views of the inlet region of processing sections 2.2 for describing in greater detail the processing modules 3.1 and 3.2.  While Figure 5.1 is a front view of a cutout from the operator aisle 5, Figure 5.2 shows a cutout of the back side of module frame 4.1.  In the processing section 2.2, the module frame 4.1 mounts processing modules 3.1 and 3.2 respectively in module locations 47.1 and 47.2.  The processing module 3.1 in processing section 2.2 is identical with processing module 3.1 of processing<br><br>
section 2.1.  To this extent, the foregoing description is herewith incorporated by reference.<br>
The processing module 3.2 mounts the group of feed roll systems 29 of processing section 2.2.  Figure 5.1 illustrates the first three feed roll systems 29.1, 29.2, 29.3 of the groups.  A driven godet 31 and a guide roll 30 form each of the feed roll systems 29. The godet 31 is driven via an individual drive 33. Shown are the individual drives 33.1, 33.2, and 33.3 of the first three feed roll systems 29.1, 29.2, and 29.3. For an electric supply of the individual drives 33, the processing module 3.2 likewise comprises an electric distributor 48, which connects to the individual drives 33 of feed roll systems 29.  The electric distributor 48 connects via plug connections 49 to an external energy supply and control device.<br>
On the processing module 3.2, below the feed roll systems 29, each processing station of processing section 2.2 comprises a yarn feed point 36 that is provided for receiving a feed yarn package 37.  Between the yarn feed point 36 and the feed roll system 29, each processing station comprises a yarn guide 35 arranged on the processing module 3.2.  With the processing modules 3.1 and 3.2 it is thus possible to withdraw in each processing station two yarns 38 and 39 and to process them to a composite yarn by subsequent processing units within processing section 2.2.  The control of the processing units of processing section 2.2 is determined by the associated field control unit 42.2.<br>
The subsequent processing sections of the embodiment may each comprise a station setup, which corresponds to the station setup of processing section 2.1 as shown in Figure 2, or to the station setup of<br><br>
processing section 2.2 as shown in figure v.     nuwev^x, it is also possible that at least one of the processing stations of the embodiment comprises a third, different station setup for producing a further yarn type. Normally, such false twist texturing machines are however operated with few different station setups in the processing sections.<br>
In the above-described embodiment, the station setups of the processing sections are largely modified by additional processing units, which are largely arranged in the inlet region of the machine. Basically, all processing units arranged within the station setup are suitable for producing a modification in the station setup.  Thus, for example, it would be possible to modify the station setup of processing section 2.1 of the embodiment in that the secondary heater 16 is not operated, so that a false twist textured yarn is wound to a package without a heat aftertreatment.  It is likewise possible to use in a processing section a primary heater 11 that is constructed as a noncontacting heater, and to use in an adjacent processing section a contact heater as primary heater 11.  Nor is the invention limited to arranging the processing module exclusively in a module frame that is placed in the inlet region.  In particular, the processing frame is thus also suited to accommodate as a module frame one or more processing modules with one or more groups of processing units.  In particular, it would be possible to arrange in the foregoing embodiment, between the entanglement device 40 and the draw roll system 14, a processing module that is constructed corresponding to processing module 3.1. With that, an additional feed roll system would precede<br><br>
the entanglement device 40, so as to permit a separate tension adjustment for entangling the yarn or yarns.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates further embodiments of processing modules 3, as could be used, for example, in one of the processing sections.  The processing module 3 shown in Figure 6.1 is especially suited for producing a composite yarn.  To this end, the withdrawal roll system 10 and the feed roll system 29 are both arranged on processing module 3.  Figure 6.1 illustrates the setup of processing module 3 in a processing station.  On processing module 3, the yarn feed point 36 and yarn guide 35 are associated to the feed roll system 29.  The yarn feed point 36 mounts a feed yarn package 37.  The withdrawal roll system 10 and feed roll system 29 are arranged on processing module 3, preferably in different planes of the yarn path, to guide two parallel advancing yarns into the processing station without additional deflection.<br>
Figure 6.2 illustrates a further embodiment of a processing module 3, which comprises the withdrawal roll system and a further feed roll system 29.  Both feed roll systems are formed by a guide roll and a godet.  Between the feed roll systems 10 and 29, the processing module mounts an entanglement device 40. The entanglement device 40 connects to a source of compressed air (not shown), so that the yarn 38 advancing through a yarn channel is entangled by a compressed-air stream.  This pretreatment of yarn 38, which precedes the false twist crimping step leads to an improvement in the bulkiness of the yarn in its crimped state..<br>
Figure 7 schematically illustrates a cutout view of a further embodiment of a processing module 3 for a processing station, with Figure 7.1 showing the<br><br>
processing module 3 in a first configuration, ana Figure 7.2 in a second configuration.  The processing module 3 shown in Figure 7.1 mounts the previously described withdrawal roll system 10.  Associated to the withdrawal roll system 10 is a plurality of receiving devices 28, which permit accommodating additional processing units.  In the case of the embodiment shown in Figure 7.1, the processing module 3 is described without additional processing units mounted in receiving devices 28.<br>
In Figure 7.2, the receiving devices of the processing module 3 are taken by an additional feed roll system 29 and a draw pin 34.  In this embodiment, the withdrawal roll system 10 unwinds a yarn 38 from a feed yarn package in each processing station of the processing section.  From the withdrawal roll system 10, the yarn advances into a first draw zone, which extends between the withdrawal roll system 10 and the feed roll system 29.  Within the draw zone, a heated draw pin 34 is arranged.  The draw pin 34 could be heated to a surface temperature from 80° to 160°C.  The yarn 38 loops about draw pin 34 and is withdrawn by feed roll system 29.  In the case that the yarn is to perform only a partial looping about draw pin 34, it would be possible to associate a yarn guide to the draw pin 34 on the processing module 3.  For adjusting a certain looping angle, this yarn guide would be changeable in its position.  From the feed system 29, the thus predrawn yarn 38 advances into the false twist texturing zone.  The further path of the yarn could correspond to. the station setup of processing section 2.1 of the described embodiment.  The electric supply and control of feed roll systems 10 and 29 and draw pin<br><br>
*34 occur via the previously described electric distributor (not shown in the Figure).<br>
The false twist texturing machine of the present invention is thus extremely flexible, so as to permit producing as many different yarn types as possible at the same time.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
