Also, the patent does not disclose or suggest  the vanadium antimony oxides  iir^lanted into alumina, magnesia,  zirconia and hafnia  to be  useful  catalysts.  Some indication that alumina can be used as a matrix material comes from the data on propane ammoxidation over vanadium-antimony, vanadium-antimony-alximinum and vanadium-antimony-tungsten-aluminum oxide catalysts recently published by J. Nilsson et. al in J. Catalysis,    1999,    186,    442.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the present invention, a catalyst precursor is prepared by<br>
precipitation of hydroxides from a solution of  compounds of<br>
vanadium,  antimony,  M  (which is understood to include M'  as<br>
appropriate in this description)  and,  optionally,  Q  (which is<br>
understood to include Q' as appropriate in this description). In<br>
this description, "solution" includes not only a solution wherein<br>
a solute is completely dissolved but also a solution in a slurry<br>
state wherein a part of the solute is present undissolved.<br>
■ The vanadium,  antimony, M and Q compounds are preferably<br>
soluble in wacer, saturated alcohol or a mixture of water and<br>
alcohol. When a compound is insoluble in water, an acid or alkali<br>
nay be used for dissolving it, or the solution may be heated to a<br>
"emperature of from 50 to 90°C to facilitate the dissolution.<br>
Generally, a solution can be prepared by dissolving two and more<br>
:ompounds, for instance by adding the antimony compound to the<br>
solution  of  the  compound containing M.  In  the  alternative,<br>
solutions of each of the vanadium, antimony or M compounds were<br>
jrepared separately.<br>
Exemplary  soluble  vanadium  compounds ■ include  ammonium « letavanadate, vanadyl acetylacetonate, vanadyl chloride, vanadium<br>
)enta^luoride  and  other  vanadium  halides.  Exemplary  soluble<br>
mtimony compounds include antimony oxide, antimony oxychloride.<br><br>
SERIAL NO. 	^		PATENT APPLICATION<br>
MAMEDOV, BETHKE, SHAIKH, ARAUJO, iOJLKARNI,KHQDAKOV     STC-Q1-0Q02<br>
antimony trichloride, antimony pentachloride and other antimony halides. The compound containing an element represented by M can be a nitrate, chloride, carbonate, oxalate, hydroxide and other preferably soluble compounds. Similar cortipounds can serve as a source for an element represented by Q.<br>
The solution thus obtained is then added and mixed with base to precipitate metal hydroxides. This procedure can be carried out by adding an aqueous solution of an ammonium hydroxide, ammonium carboxylate (e.g., ammonium acetate, ammoni'jm tar-rate or ammonium citrate), urea or alcohol. A pH of from 5 to 10 is attained and, preferably, maintained. It is more "preferred to have a pH of about 3. To maintain the pH level, it may be necessary to progressively leutralize the acidity possibly formed during the precipitation of aetal hydroxides (e.g., hydrohalic acid is formed when a halide of intimony is used) using a basic compound. In the process of making :he invention, it is preferable to carry out this neutralization Dy adding aqueous ammonium hydroxide to the precursor solution or rice  versa.<br>
After precipitation of the metal hydroxides of the invention, :hey are separated from the solvent liquid by any conventional lechniqwe', in particular for the present invention by filtration ir evaporation. The isolated metal hydroxides are then dried at itmospheric pressure at a temperature ranging from 30 to 200°C, jreferably from 100 to 150°C.<br><br>
SERIAL NO. 		PATENT APPLICATION<br>
MAMEDOV, BETHKE, SHAIKH, ARAUJO, KULKAJINI, KHODAKOV     STC-01-0002<br>
The dried hydroxides are calcined with final temperatures ranging from 600 to 950°C, most preferably from 650 to 850°C, in different atmospheres, preferably in air.<br>
The composite oxides of vanadium, antimony, M and Q thus obtained can comprise individual and mixed oxide phases, predominantly containing antimony and elements represented by M. It is believed that the presence of mixed oxides of M elements with antimony, such as Mg^Sb^O,, AlSbO, and Nb^SbjO^j, infers that they do not play a mere role of support or diluent but do constitute with vanadium and antimony a part of the catalytically active components. Another feature of these compositions revealed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) is the absence of vanadium-containing phases (denoted by an "*"} which indicates isolation of vanadium sites in the catalyst composition. As shown in the Figure, a catalyst which is supported on zirconia (ZrO,) has peaks as denoted with "*" while a catalyst which has zrO, incorporated into the catalyst as disclosed in the present invention does not exhibit these distinctive peaks. These findings indicate that the catalyst composition of the present invention is different from compact and supported vanadium-antimony oxides of prior art catalysts which usually contain VSbOj phases in the morphology of the active components effective for the ammoxidation reaction.<br>
Compounds containing Q elements can either be added before precipitation or impregnated on the VSb^M^, oxide before or after<br><br>

the calcination step. If a compound containing Q element(s) is added to calcined VSb^M^ oxide, the resulting solid may again be calcined at a temperature up to 950°C but preferably under 850°C.<br>
The catalyst can be employed in the powder form or be shaped, e.g., beads, spheres, pellets, extrudes or crushed particles, according to various techniques known in the art. In the examples of invention below, freshly prepared catalysts were ground to fine powder, tabletted at 20 Kpsi, crushed, sieved to 18-30 mesh and loaded to the reactor.<br>
In the ammoxidation process of the present invention, the reaction is run in , the gas phase.. by- conracting ■ a mixture containing paraffin, ammonia and molecular oxygen, and diluent, if any, in a fixed bed of catalyst, or a fluidized bed, or a moving bed [riser reactor) . The mole ratio of paraffin to ammonia is usually in the range from 0.5 to 10, preferably from 1 to 2.5, and the mole ratio of paraffin to oxygen is usually from 0.1 to 10, preferably from 0.5 to 2. The mole ratio of gaseous diluent, e.g., Nj, He, Ar, COj and H^O, to paraffin usually ranges from 0 to 2 0, preferably from 0 to 10. Higher molar ratios can be used but are usually uneconomical.<br>
In the present process, the paraffin as the starting material is not particularly limited, and it may be any lower alkane having from 2 to 8 carbon atoms. However,- frfim the viewpoint of industrial application of the obtainable nitriles, it is preferred<br><br>

to employ propane or isobutane. Low-weight olefins, such as propylene and isobuCylene, can also be employed for production of acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile, respectively. The process according to the invention is more particularly suitable for the ammoxidation of propane.<br>
The reaction temperature range can vary from 350 to 550°C, preferably from 425 to 500°C. The latter temperature range is especially useful in the case of propane ammoxidation to acrylonitrile.<br>
The pressure of the reaction can be greater than or egual to atmospheric pressure and "can range from I to 40 psig. Preferably, pressure is 1 to 20 psig.<br>
The effective contact time is in the range from 0.01 to 10 seconds, but is preferably from 0.05 to 8 seconds, more preferably from 0.1 to 5 seconds.<br>
The most advantageous combination of temperature, pressure and contact time for a given desired result from a given feed can be determined by routine experimentation.<br>
The present invention is described in further detail in the following Examples. However, it should be understood that the present invention is by no means restricted to such specific Examples.<br><br>

SACKGRODND OF THE INVENTIOM<br>
.eld of thg Invention<br>
The invention relates to a catalyst for the catalytic nmoxidation of alkanes and olefins, more specifically Cj to C-araffins or olefins, such as propane or isobucane and propylene c isobutylene, to the corresponding a, [i-unsaturated mononitriles, .g., acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile, utilizing the disclosed atalyst-. In addition, the catalyst may be used in the mraoxidation of ,.&gt;cylene3, and methylpyridines to the corresoondinc ono- and di-nitriles.<br>
The invention is directed also to making the catalyst: ontaining isolated vanadium and antimony species in a matrix ormed by the oxides of elements usually used as supports or [iluents. The invention is directed also to using the catalyst in L process for catalytic ammoxidation of alkanes and olefins.<br></td>
