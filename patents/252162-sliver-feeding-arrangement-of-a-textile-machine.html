FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a sliver feeding arrangement of a textile machine. Particularly, the inventions relates to a guiding arrangement for feeding slivers eliminating preparation of slivers with reduced diameters at their front portion before routing the slivers from respective sliver cans to nip of inlet rollers in the textile machine.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Textile machines such as Draw Frame, Lap Former have feeding arrangement, also known as creel arrangement for feeding sliver from the plurality of feed sliver cans arranged on both sides of the feeding device to the inlet arrangement of the textile machine The sliver from the feed cans are fed to the feed roller contact roller pair of the feeding device and delivered to the nip of the pair of inlet rollers which are being arranged on the material in feed end of the textile. While the feed roller is driven by the drive arrangement of the textile machine, the contact roller which is positioned above the feed roller is driven by friction means. The contact roller is provided with means for radially swinging to facilitate the laying of the sliver in between the feed roller and the contact roller. The bottom inlet roller is also driven by the drive arrangement of the drafting arrangement. The top inlet roller which is positioned above the bottom contact roller is driven by friction means. The drafting arrangement is arranged downstream of the inlet rollers and the material<br><br>
supplied in the form of slivers are processed by the drafting arrangement of the textile machine and delivered in the form of sliver and deposited in to the sliver cans arranged beneath the coiler arrangement.<br>
In textile industries for joining slivers in the textile machines, referring to figures 1 and 2 contact roller (2) is to be lifted from the feed roller (3) and then the sliver (4) from the feed can (1) is to be inserted in to the sliver guide (5) after preparation of the sliver by reducing the diameter at front portion for easy insertion into the sliver guide opening, laid between the contact roller (2) and feed roller (3), routed in between respective adjacent guide member (6) and laid up to the nip of the inlet rollers attached to the textile machine. The machine is run at slow speed for a shorter duration and then the respective contact rollers (2) are swung back to its working position on the respective feed roller (3) . Subsequently the machine is switched to its normal working speed.<br>
The disadvantages with the existing technology is that the sliver diameter at its one end is required to be reduced to fit for the diameter of the sliver funnel before it is routed to the nip of the inlet rollers from the sliver cans. This leads to increase in the time for routing the sliver to the inlet rollers which subsequently increase the total processing time of slivers in a textile machine.<br>
Thus there is need for a sliver feeding arrangement which could eliminate preparation reduced diameter at one end of<br><br>
the sliver before routing it from the sliver cans to. the nip of the inlet roller in a textile machine. Such arrangement further provides automatic insertion of sliver in between feed rollers and the contact rollers without lifting the contact roller.<br>
The present inventors have found that by way of unique arrangement comprising an axially movable guiding element appropriate guidance of the sliver to the nip of the inlet rollers without reducing the diameter of one end of the sliver is possible.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to overcome the disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a sliver feeding arrangement comprising a guiding arrangement for feeding slivers eliminating preparation of slivers with reduced diameters.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a unique guiding element.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide automatic insertion of sliver in between the feed roller and the contact roller,<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring to figures 4 for joining the sliver, the sliver (4) from the feed can (1) is inserted in to the first sliver guide element (7) constructed with passage opening adequate enough for the easy passage of the sliver without the preparation (reduction in diameter) and then to the second sliver guide element (8) constructed with passage opening adequate enough for the easy passage of the sliver without the preparation (reduction in diameter) and routed in between respective adjacent guide members (6) and laid up to the nip of the inlet rollers (9, 10) attached to the textile machine. The machine is run at slow speed for a shorter duration and then switched to its normal working speed. The configuration and the routing of the sliver facilitates the automatic insertion of the sliver in between the feed roller (3) and the contact roller (2) without the requirement of lifting of the contact roller (2) for laying the sliver in-between the feed roller and contact roller and re positioning of the contact roller (2) later on.<br>
Referring to figures 4, 5 and 6 the arrangement of the present invention comprise the first sliver guide element (7) which comprises sliver funnel (7a) with a passage opening larger than the diameter of the sliver to facilitate the free passage of the sliver without the need<br><br>
for reducing the diameter of the sliver for inserting. Arm<br>
(7b)  (also shown in an enlarged view in figure 7)  is<br>
provided with its first end attached to the sliver funnel<br>
(7a)  (also shown in an enlarged view in figure 7) and the<br>
other end connected to the setting collar (7c) (also shown<br>
in an enlarged view in figure 7). The setting collar (7c)<br>
being provided with means for fixing the first sliver guide<br>
(7)  on the  holding member  (9)  attached to  the  creel<br>
assembly.<br>
The holding member (12) also houses the second sliver guide element (8) , feed roller (3) , contact roller (2) and the guide member (6),<br>
The first sliver guide element (7) is radially rotatable / swiveled along the horizontal axis of the holding member/means (9) and means (not shown in the figures) are provided for its fixing at the required angular position for proper guidance of the sliver from the respective sliver cans to the second sliver guide element (8).<br>
The second sliver guide element (8) comprises guide (8a) (also shown in an enlarged view in figure 8) which is constructed in the shape of a bow with a straight end and having smooth surface for the guidance of the sliver through it. For example the guide may be constructed from cylindrical metallic wire which of course do not restrict the scope of the present invention. The straight end of the guide (8a) being connected to the retaining member (8b) provided with means for fixing the second sliver guide element (8) on the holding member (12) attached to the creel assembly. The second sliver guide element (8) can be<br><br>
swiveled with respect to the horizontal axis of the holding member (9) and can be fixed at the required/desired angular position for the proper guidance of the sliver.<br>
Working of invention:  (with reference to figure 4)<br>
When ever there is discontinuity of sliver in the creel area between contact roller (2) and feed roller (3) pair and the sliver can; in the region between the contact roller (2) and feed roller (3) pair and inlet roller pair (9,10) for reasons like sliver breakage or absence of sliver in the sliver can, the stop motion send signal and the machine is switched 'off. Then the sliver (4) from the feed can (1) is inserted in to the first sliver guide element (7) and then taken through to the second sliver guide element (8) and routed in between respective adjacent guide members (6) and laid up loosely up to the nip of the inlet roller (9,10) attached to the textile machine, through the corresponding eye  (11a)  of the sliver guide<br>
(11) -<br>
The inlet roller pair (9,10) being driven at a slightly higher surface speed than that of the surface speed of the contact roller (2) and feed roller (3) pair there by the sliver in the region of contact roller (2) and feed roller (3) and bottom inlet roller (9,10) and the top inlet roller (10) is kept under desirable tension, known astension draft. The machine is run at slow speed for a pre determined shorter duration of time period and during this period the sliver is automatically inserted in between the feed roller (3) and the contact roller (2) by tension draft, without the requirement of lifting of the contact<br><br>
roller (2). The machine is subsequently switched to its normal working speed.<br>
The invention has been described in a preferred form only and many variations may be made in the invention which will still be comprised within its spirit.<br>
The invention is not limited to the details cited above. The holding means, retaining members as herein described do not limit the scope of the present invention and can be replaced by its technical equivalence and yet the invention can be performed. The structure thus conceived is susceptible of numerous modifications and variations, all the details may furthermore be replaced with elements having technical equivalence. In practice the materials and dimensions may be any according to the requirements, which will still be comprised within its true spirit.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
