				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an unproved speed regulator for use with fan and other allied electrical loads such as electric motor driven pump, blower and toy, By way of example, but without employing any limitation thereto the speed regulator of the present invention may advantageously be employed as a fan regulator. Thus, reference to a fan regulator made subsequently herein is only by way of an exemplary embodiment and without intending to imply any limitation to the scope of me invention.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fan regulators known in the art, normally comprise a resistor provided with a plurality of tappings connected to a switch. In operation, the voltage is dropped across the resistor so that the fan motor gets a lower voltage and results in a speed reduction. Several distinct disadvantages are associated with such a known construction of a fan regulator. One such disadvantage is that generation of heat losses. Another disadvantage is that of power consumption by the resistor itself<br>
In order to obviate such a disadvantage, it is known to employ a triac which blocks the voltage for a part of the wave and allows only the remainder of the voltage to be applied to the fan. A disadvantage associated with the use of a triac is that of the presence of harmonics. It is known that any periodic function contains only odd harmonics such as the third, fifth and higher odd harmonics.<br>
It is known that an Electronic speed Regulator which works on the principle of chopping off a portion of the AX. Sinusoidal wave of electric supply and thereby reducing the resultant voltage across the motor.<br>
When a portion of such sinusoidal wave is cut off with the use of a "TRIAC" &amp; "DIAC", the remaining portion of the wave, as per FOURIERS SERIES of Mathematics will be equivalent to one fundamental frequency wave followed by a series of harmonies e.g. 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th etc. as per the following expression.<br>
-2-<br><br><br>
Fundamental 2nd Harmonic 3rd Harmonic<br>
If the waveform is symmetric, which in this case is, because it is cut off in both positive and negative cycles of wave form, we would have only as follows ;<br><br>
i.e. all even harmonics would be off as per mathematics.<br>
Now as sin30 i.e. the third harmonic is most detrimental to an electric motor and it creates noise, vibration &amp; also causes radio interference. This is quite clear when an electronic regulator is put to the slowest speed position during a winter season's nighttime.<br>
The presence of the odd harmonies and particularly the third harmonic is therefore not desired in an electric motor.<br>
Since a capacitor regulator does not use any electric part like DIAC &amp; TRIAC. it has only capacitive reactance and hence no chopping off of any portion of the sinusoidal supply voltage wave form. So no harmonics get even generated. Only the fundamental persists and this system avoids any further generation of even or odd harmonics resulting in zero deformation of the original supply line sinusoidal wave form.<br>
Still another disadvantage of the presence of such harmonic is that it creates a noise and vibration level and also creates radio interference<br>
A further disadvantage of electronic regulator is that it makes the "power factor" very<br>
low, say even 0,4 at slowest speed and lagging,<br>
P = VICos <br>
Where P = Power in watts<br>
V = Voltage in Volts<br>
I = Current in amps<br>
Cos  = power Factor<br>
  = Electrical angle between voltage &amp; current vector.<br><br>
When the current vector lags behind the voltage vector, it ia lagging power factor. If current vector leads the voltage vector, it is leading power factor.<br>
Also, when a power factor is low, it would draw more current to deliver the same electric power.<br>
Also most of the other electrical loads have lagging power factor and use of such electronic regular would add further to the problem of needing more current to deliver the same Electric Power, which episode is a burning problem associated with any electrical machine or load and needs continuous efforts and solution to minimise enormous wastages associated with any electrical load in use.<br>
Hence, one would like to have a power factor which is very close to unity i.e. 1.0 and preferably on the leading side because that can compensate the other already existing lagging electrical loads and thereby reduce the total supply current to deliver the same load.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose an improved construction of a speed regulator for use with an electrical load. Another object of this invention is to propose a speed regulator for use with a fan or other similar loads.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a speed regulator, which obviates the disadvantages associated with the known art.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a speed regulator which has a leading power factor having values near unity.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to propose a speed regulator, which no longer has substantial heat losses associated with the known speed regulators having resistors.<br>
4-<br><br>
A still further object of this invention is to propose a speed regulator, which is compact<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description.<br>
An improved regulator for fan and other allied electrical loads comprising plurality of capacitors (C1, C3, C3) one terminal of each of said capacitors being in a short circuit condition and connected to a terminal of a double deck switch, the other terminals of said capacitors (C1, C2, C3) provided in a parallel relationship to each other and connected to terminals of said double deck switch having a terminal connected to an electrical input, the said speed regulator being controlled through said capacitance bank providing different values of capacitive reactance to the regulator circuit and hence different values of voltage reaching the motor terminals by selecting different combinations of the capacitors.<br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to non-limiting exemplary embodiments of me invention represented in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the regulator Figure 2 shows the doubledeck switch with various connection points. Figure 3 shows the doubledeck switch as connected to C1, C2, C3 Figure 4 shows the doubledeck switch as connected to C2 and Cs<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a speed regulator (14) comprising two or more capacitors (C1, C2, C3), each of a different value, one terminal (6,7 and 8) of each of said capacitor being in a short circuit condition, the other terminals (9, 10 and 11) of said capacitor provided in a parallel relationship to each other and connected to a double deck switch (12). The doubledeck switch (12) has 6 different settings 1,2,3,4, 5 and off for speed regulation.<br>
-5-<br><br>
C1 is connected to terminal 1, C2 at terminal 2, C1 + C3 at terminal 3,<br>
C2 + C3 at terminal 4. The terminal 5 is connected to Fan and off (13) is connected to<br>
power supply.<br>
One of the terminals (6,7,8) of the capacitor (C1, C2, C3) is short circuited. The other terminal (9,10,11) of each capacitor (C1, C2, C3) is connected to one of the decks of the double deck switch (12) and such mat any one capacitor (C1, C2, C3) is in circuit depending on me selection mode of the switch (1). Further, me double deck switch (2) in a particular operative mode allows two or more capacitors (C1, C2, C3) to be in parallel connection so as to increase the value of the capacitance in circuit which otherwise would need a much larger size and hence not economic.<br>
Existing Resistance regulators have significant heat loss due to current following through the resistor and thereby generating 1" R loss<br>
Where I = Current in Amperes &amp; R - Resistance in Ohms.<br>
In the proposed capacitor Regulator, there is no resistance element It is only capacitance in Microfarad, which drops the voltage due to its capacitive reactance<br><br>
where f = frequency of supply wave<br>
C = Capacitance in Microfarad<br>
Xc - Capacitor reactance in Ohms<br>
Voltage is changing as per above mathematical relationship when Voltage drop across capacitor<br><br>
where I - Live current in Amperes<br>
-6-<br><br>
Now,<br>
Supply Voltage - Voltae Drop across capacitor = Voltage at Load Terminals This is a Vector substation. Hence, the load terminal voltage is less than the supply voltage, resulting in reduced speed.<br>
When an AC sinusoidal Electric supply current passes through a capacitance, the electric current vector leads the voltage vector by 90 and hence there is no power consumption in the capacitor &amp; hence no heat loss.<br>
Also, there would be no distortion of the supply voltage sinusoidal waveform even after current passes through the capacitor. The reduced voltage received on the motor terminal would also be of exact sinusoidal wave form. Hence there would be no harmonic content and also no noise, vibration &amp; no radio-interference.<br>
In summary several advantages arise by the regulator (14) of the present invention. One such advantage is that it has a leading power factor. Another advantage is that me heat losses are negligible. A still former advantage is mat it is compact in size. Further it keeps me sinusoidal wave of the electric supply system undisturbed and hence causes no interference with radio and television etc. Further, there is a power saving for all electric supply companies due to the load operating at a leading power factor.<br>
Most of the existing loads have lagging power factor. Hence, a leading power factor when used in mass scale such as with domestic fans and other allied products, would reduce the J-Component of the electric current vector and hence reduce the resultant magnitude of the electric supply current.<br>
The invention described hereinabove is in relation to non limiting embodiments and as defined by me accompanying claims.<br>
