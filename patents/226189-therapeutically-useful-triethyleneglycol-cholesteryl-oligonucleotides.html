FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to cholesteryl-conjugated oligonucleotide compositions and<br>
their use for the inhibition of cellular proliferation, induction of apoptosis, modification of cell<br>
cycle progression and modulation of extracellular matrix-cell interaction.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Proliferation is the culmination of a cell's progression through the cell cycle resulting in<br>
the division of one cell into two cells. The five major phases of the cell cycle are G0, G1, S, G2,<br>
and M. During the G0, phase, cells are quiescent. Most cells in the body, at one time, are in this<br>
stage. During the G1 phase, cells, responding to signals to divide, produce the RNA and the<br>
proteins necessary for DNA synthesis. During the S-phase (SE, early S-phase; SM, middle S-<br>
phase; and SL, late S-phase) the cells replicate their DNA. During the G2 phase, proteins are<br>
elaborated in preparation for cell division. During the mitotic (M) phase, the cell divides into two<br>
daughter cells. Alterations in cell cycle progression occur in all cancers and may result from<br>
over-expression of genes, mutation of regulatory genes, or abrogation of DNA damage<br>
checkpoints (Hochhauser D., Anti-Cancer Chemotherapeutic Agents, 8:903,1997).<br>
Apoptosis or programmed cell death is the physiological process for the killing and<br>
removal of unwanted cells, and a mechanism whereby chemotherapeutic agents kill cancer cells.<br>
Apoptosis is characterized by distinctive morphological changes within cells that include<br>
condensation of nuclear chromatin, cell shrinkage, nuclear disintegration, plasma membrane<br>
blebbing, and the formation of membrane-bound apoptotic bodies (Wyllie et al., Int. Rev. Cytol.,<br>
68: 251, 1980). The translocarion of phosphatidylserine from the inner face of the plasma<br>
membrane to the outer face coincides with chromatin condensation and is regarded as a cellular<br>
hallmark of apoptosis (Kooptnan, G. et al., Blood, 84:1415, 1994). The mechanism of apoptosis<br>
is known to be mediated by the activation of a family of cysteine proteases, known as caspases.<br>
Caspases recognize three major peptide sequences as substrates (Thomberry et al., J.<br>
Biol. Chem. 272:17907, 1997): (i) Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp (YVAD, caspase-1, -4), (ii) Asp-Glu-Val-<br>
Asp (DEVD, caspase-2, -3 and -7), and, (iii) Ile-(Leu)-Glu-X-Asp (I(L)EXD; caspase-8 and -10).<br>
Sequence recognition in a protein target results in a limited and specific proteolysis of the target,<br><br>
such as activation of caspase-7 by caspase-3, degradation of structural protein targets including,<br>
but not limited to, lamins, or activation of enzymes including, but not limited to, poly(ADP-<br>
ribose) polymerase. Caspase-3 was reported to be cleaved into its catalyrically active subunits<br>
(17 and 13 kDa) following pro-apoptotic signals, leading to apoptosis (Susin et al., J. Exp. Med.<br>
186:25, 3997).<br>
During apoptosis, the activation of caspases results in proteolytic cleavage of numerous<br>
substrates. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a nuclear enzyme involved in DNA repair, is<br>
a well-known substrate for caspase-3 cleavage during apoptosis. Its cleavage is considered to be<br>
a hallmark of apoptosis (O'Brien et al., Biotechniques 30:886,2001).<br>
The extracellular matrix (ECM) impacts behavior of normal and tumor cells (Radisky et<br>
al., Seminars Cancer Biol., 11:87, 2001). Therefore, the interaction between tumor cells and the<br>
ECM components, when tumor cells are plated on the ECM, will activate signal transduction<br>
events mimicking several biopathological characteristics of tumors in vivo, such as modulation<br>
of cell-cell contacts (Weaver et al., J. Cell Biol., 137:231, 1997).<br>
Synthetic oligonucleotides are polyanionic sequences that are internalized in cells<br>
(Vlassov et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 11197:95, 1994). Synthetic oligonucleotides were<br>
reported that bind selectively to nucleic acids (Wagner, R-, Nature, 372:333, 1994), to specific<br>
cellular proteins (Bates et al., J. Biol. Chem., 274:26369, 1999) and to specific nuclear proteins<br>
(Scaggiante et al., Eur. J. Biochem, 252:207, 1998) in order to inhibit proliferation of cancer<br>
cells.<br>
Synthesis and physical properties of oligonucleotides with a cholesteryl moiety have been<br>
described. The attachment of a cholesteryl moiety to the 3'-end of antisense oligonucleotides<br>
enhances their activities (Letsinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86:6553, 1989;<br>
Boutorin et al., FEBS Letter, 254:129, 1989; Comas et al., J. Neurooncol. 31:171, 1997; US<br>
Patent No. 4,958,013; WO Patent No. 9714440). The attachment of a cholesteryl moiety to the<br>
3'-end enhances the uptake of antisense molecules by cells (Comas et al., J. Neurooncol. 31:171,<br>
1997), and increases antisense vascular retention in vivo (Fleser et al.. Circulation 92:1296,<br>
1995). Intemucleoside cholesteryl side chains linked to phosphorous via phosphoramidate bonds<br>
have been described as a modification to increase the activity of antisense molecules (US Patent<br>
No. 4,958,013). Homopolymers of 15 cytidine or thymidine residues with a cholesteryl moiety at<br>
the 5'-end were found to modulate cytosolic Ca2+ levels in pro-myelocytic leukemia cells, while<br>
heteropolymeric sequences with a cholesteryl moiety at the 5'-end or cholesteryl-modified<br>
phosphorothioate sequences were inactive (Saxonetal., Antisense Res. Dev. 2:243, 1992).<br>
Heteropolymers consisting of 15 phosphorothioate deoxynucleotides with alternating cytosine<br><br>
and adenosine residues, or homopolymers with 15 cytosine or thymidine residues, were shown to<br>
be potent inhibitors of methotrexate transport when a cholesteryl group was linked to the 5'-end<br>
(Henderonetal., NucJ. Acids Res. 25:3726, 1995). The covalent modification of a 10 base<br>
homocytidine phosphorothioate oligonucleotide with a cholesteryl moiety at the 5'-end blocked<br>
the formation of syncitia in T lymphocytes infected with HIV-1 or HIV-2 through inhibition of<br>
HIV reverse transcriptase (Stein et al., Biochemistry 5:2439, 1991).<br>
The attachment of a cholesteryl moiety to oligonucleotides has minimal effects on the<br>
growth of cancer cells (Henderon et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 25:3726, 1995). Typical features of<br>
apoptotic cell death were not observed in cancer cell lines treated with 3'-end cholesteryl<br>
oligonucleotides (Corrias et al., J. Neurooncol. 31:171, 1997).<br>
Most anti-cancer therapies, whether directed to inhibition of proliferation, induction of<br>
cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis, stimulation of the immune system or modulation of<br>
extracellular matrix-cell interaction have proven to be less than adequate for clinical<br>
applications. Many of these therapies are inefficient or toxic, have significant adverse effects,<br>
result in development of drug resistance or immunosensitization, and are debilitating for the<br>
recipient.<br>
Therefore, there is a continuing need for novel compositions and methods that induce cell<br>
cycle arrest in cancer cells, that induce apoptosis in cancer cells, and that modulate extracellular<br>
matrix-cell interactions.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention fulfills this need by providing a composition, wherein a<br>
triethyleneglycol (TEG) cholesteryl moiety is attached to the 3' end of synthetic oligonucleotide<br>
sequences SEQ ID NO: 1 (5' OH-GGGTGG-OH 3'), SEQ ID NO:2 (5' OH-GGGAGG-OH 3'),<br>
SEQ ID NO:3 (5' OH-CCACCC-OH 3'), or SEQ ID NO:4 (5' OH-GTG-OH 3'), resulting in<br>
corresponding 5'-OH, 3' TEG cholesteryl novel synthetic oligonucleotide sequences<br>
SEQ ID NO:5 (5' OH-GGGTGG(TEG-cholesteryl) 3'), SEQ ID NO:6 (5' OH-GGGAGG(TEG-<br>
cholesteryl) 3'), SEQ ID NO:7 (5' OH-CCACCC(TEG-cholesteryl) 3'), or SEQ ID NO:8 (5' OH-<br>
GTG(TEG-cholesteryl) 3'). The present invention also provides methods tor using these novel<br>
synthetic oligonucleotide sequences by combining them with an acceptable carrier to make a<br>
composition, and administering the composition in vitro or in vivo. The composition is<br>
administered to an animal, including a human, in order to induce a response in a cell. Such<br>
responses include, but are not limited to, inhibition of cellular proliferation, induction of cell<br>
cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis, activation of caspase, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)<br><br>
polymerase, or modulation of extracellular matrix-cell interactions, or a combination thereof. A<br>
preferred cell for induction of the response is a cancer cell or a synovial cell. Any disease or<br>
condition characterized by undesired cellular proliferation may be treated with the compositions<br>
of the present invention. Such diseases or conditions characterized by undesired cellular<br>
proliferation include, but are not limited to, autoimmune disease, inflammation,<br>
lymphoproliferative disease, arthritis and cancer.<br>

acceptable carrier and administered as a composition in vitro in cells or tissues in culture, or in<br>
vivo to an animal or human. Further, the compositions of the present invention may be<br>
administered together with one or more therapeutic agent. Such administration of the<br>
compositions of the present invention may occur before, during or after administration of one or<br>
more therapeutic agents known to one of ordinary skill in the medical or veterinary arts. Any<br>
therapeutic agent known to one of ordinary skill in the medical or veterinary arts, and employed<br>
to treat diseases, may be used in combination with these novel sequences. Such combinations<br>
may permit use of lower dosages of therapeutic agents, thereby decreasing unwanted side effects.<br>

sequences of the present invention to an animal or human is a therapeutic treatment that prevents,<br>
treats or eliminates a disease or condition characterized by undesired cellular proliferation. Such<br>
diseases and conditions are known to one of skill in the medical or veterinary arts and include,<br>

lymphoma, and metastases derived therefrom.<br>
Methods and routes of administration of therapeutic agents to animals and humans are<br>
known to one of ordinary skill in the art and may be employed to administer compositions<br>
comprising the sequences of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>

carrier are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the sequence and the<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The terms "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" or<br>
"pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle" are used herein to mean, without limitation, any liquid,<br>
solid or semi-solid, including, but not limited to, water or saline, a gel, cream, salve, solvent,<br>
diluent, fluid ointment base, ointment, paste, implant, liposome, micelle, giant micelle, and the<br>
like, which is suitable for use in contact with living animal or human tissue without causing<br>
adverse physiological responses, and which does not interact with the other components of the<br>
composition in a deleterious manner. Other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or vehicles<br>
known to one of skill in the art may be employed to make compositions for delivering the<br>
oligonucleotide sequences of the present invention. Liquid carriers are aqueous carriers, non-<br>
aqueous carriers or both and include, but are not limited to, aqueous suspensions, dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide, ethanol, oil emulsions, water in oil emulsions, water-in-oil-in-water emulsions, site-<br>
specific emulsions, long-residence emulsions, sticky-emulsions, microemulsions and<br>
nanoemulsions. Solid carriers are biological carriers, chemical carriers or both and include, but<br>
are not limited to, viral vector systems, particles, microparticles, nanoparticles, microspheres,<br>
nanospheres, minipumps, bacterial cell wall extracts and biodegradable or non-biodegradable<br>
natural or synthetic polymers that allow for sustained Telease of the sequences. Emulsions,<br>
minipumps and polymers can be implanted in the vicinity of where delivery is required. Methods<br>
used to complex a sequence(s) to a solid carrier include, but are not limited to, direct adsorption<br>
to the surface of the solid carrier, covalent coupling to the surface of the solid carrier, either<br>
directly or via a linking moiety, and covalent coupling or electrostatic coupling to the polymer<br>
used to make the solid carrier. Optionally, a sequence(s) can be stabilized by the addition of non-<br>
ionic or ionic polymers such as polyoxyethylenesorbitan monooleates (Tweens), hyahironic acid<br><br>
or aluminum hydroxide. Other carriers known to one of ordinary skill in the art may be<br>
employed.<br>
Preferred aqueous carriers include, but are not limited to, water, saline and<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable buffers. Preferred non-aqueous carriers include, but are not limited<br>
to, a mineral oil or a neutral oil including, but not limited to, a diglyceride, a triglyceride, a<br>
phospholipid, a lipid, an oil and mixtures thereof, wherein the oil contains an appropriate mix of<br>
polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids. Examples include, but are not limited to, soybean oil,<br>
canola oil, palm oil, olive oil and myglyol, wherein the fatty acids can be saturated or<br>
unsaturated. Optionally, excipients may be included regardless of the pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier used to present the sequence to the responding cells. These excipients include,<br>
but are not limited to, anti-oxidants, buffers, and bacteriostats, and may include suspending<br>
agents and thickening agents.<br>
The sequences of the present invention may be combined with pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers and administered as compositions in vitro to cells or tissues in culture, or in<br>
vivo to animals or humans. Forms of administration include, but are not limited to, injections,<br>
solutions, creams, gels, implants, pumps, ointments, emulsions, suspensions, microspheres,<br>
particles, microparticles, nanoparticles, liposomes, pastes, patches, tablets, transdermal delivery<br>
devices, sprays, aerosols, or other means familiar to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are commonly known to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention can be prepared by procedures known in<br>
the art using well known and readily available ingredients. For example, the compounds can be<br>
formulated with common excipients, diluents, or carriers, and formed into tablets, capsules,<br>
suspensions, powders, and the like. Examples of excipients, diluents, and carriers that are<br>
suitable for such formulations include the following: fillers and extenders (e.g., starch, sugars,<br>
mannitol, and silicic derivatives); binding agents (e.g., carboxymethyl cellulose and other<br>

stearate); solid polyethyl glycols; and mixtures thereof.<br>
The formulations can be so constituted that they release the active ingredient only or<br>
preferably in a particular location, possibly over a period of time. Such combinations provide yet<br><br>
a farther mechanism for controlling release kinetics. The coalings, envelopes, and protective<br>
matrices may be made, for example, from polymeric substances or waxes.<br>
One or more sequences may be administered alone, or in combination with other<br>

transmucosal administration include but are not limited to creams, pastes, patches, sprays, and<br>
gels. Some examples of appropriate delivery mechanisms for subcutaneous administration<br>
include but are not limited to implants, depots, needles, capsules, and osmotic pumps.<br>
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include but are not limited to aqueous and<br>
non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats<br>
and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient, and<br>
aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and<br>
thickening agents. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from<br>
sterile powders, granules and tablets commonly used by one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The sequences of the invention may be combined with one or more pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers or excipients to form a composition. These compositions may conveniently<br>
be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by conventional pharmaceutical<br>
techniques. Such techniques include the step of bringing into association the compositions<br>
containing the active ingredient and the pharmaceutical carrier(s) or excipient(s). In general, the<br><br>
formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active<br>
ingredient with liquid carriers. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a dose or<br>
unit, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the administered ingredient. It should be understood<br>
that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, formulations comprising the<br>
compositions of the present invention may include other agents commonly used by one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The volume of administration will vary depending on the route of administration. Such<br>
volumes are known to one of ordinary skill in the art of administering compositions to animals or<br>
humans. Depending on the route of administration, the volume per dose is preferably about 0.001<br>
to 100 ml, more preferably about 0.01 to 50 ml, and most preferably about 0.1 to 30 ml.<br>
Preferably, the amount of sequence administered per dose is from about 0.001 to 100 ing/kg of<br>
body weight, more preferably from about 0.01 to 10 mg/kg and most preferably from about 0.1<br>
to 5 mg/kg. The sequence, combination of sequences, and/or additional therapeutic agents can be<br>
administered in a single dose treatment, in multiple dose treatments or continuously infused on a<br>
schedule and over a period of time appropriate to the disease being treated, the condition of the<br>
recipient and the route of administration. Moreover, the sequence can be administered before, at.<br>
the same time as, or after the administration of the therapeutic agent. The particular sequence and<br>
the particular therapeutic agent administered, the amount per dose, and the route of<br>
administration should be decided by the practitioner using methods known to those skilled in the<br>
art and will depend on the disease or condition being treated, for example the type of cancer, the<br>
severity of the cancer, the location of the cancer and other clinical factors such as the size,<br>
weight and physical condition of the recipient. In addition, various in vitro and in vivo assays<br>
may optionally be employed to help identify optimal ranges for sequence and for sequence plus<br>
therapeutic agent administration.<br>
A sequence in combination with therapeutic agent, for example a chemotherapeutic agent<br>
or an anti-arthritic agent, is administered to an animal, or human, having cancer or arthritis in an<br>
amount effective to enhance the anti-neoplastic effect of a chemotherapeutic agent or the anti-<br>
arthritic effect of an anti-arthritic agent. Preferably, the amount of therapeutic agent administered<br>
per dose is from about 0.001 to 1000 mg/m2 of body surface OT from about 0.01 to 1000 mg/kg<br>
of body weight, more preferably from about 0.01 to 500 mg/m2 or about 0.01 to 500 mg/kg and<br>
most preferably from about 0.1 to 100 mg/m2 or about 0.1 to 100 mg/kg. The particular sequence<br>
and the particular therapeutic agent administered, the amount per dose, the dose schedule and the<br>
route of administration should be decided by the practitioner using methods known to those<br>
skilled in the art and will depend on the type of disease, the severity of the disease, the location<br><br>
of the disease and other clinical factors such as the size, weight and physical condition of the<br>
recipient. In addition, various in vitro and in vivo assays may optionally be employed to help<br>
identify optimal ranges for sequence and for sequence plus therapeutic agent administration.<br>
Various assays useful for this purpose are described in PCT CA00/01467 (WO 01/44465).<br>
Additional assays for evaluation of the efficacy of the sequences of the present invention, and for<br>
evaluation of the efficacy of these sequences in combination with other therapeutic agents are<br>
described by Oncogene Research Products, P.O. Box 12087, La Jolla, California, 92039<br>
(Apoptosis Catalog and Technical Guide 2002-2003, especially pages 5-295). Such assays<br>
include assays designed to analyze DNA fragmentation, apoptosis, mitochondrial markers,<br>
endoplasmic reticulum markers, free nucleosomes, nuclear matrix proteins, detection and activity<br>
of numerous caspases and related proteins, including but not limited to caspases 1 through 14,<br>
glutathione, superoxide dismutase, members of the bcl-2 family, analysis of the Fas/TNR-R<br>
super family, PARP related products, analysis of apoptotic signal transducers, analysis of various<br>
signaling receptors including death receptors, Apo2, decoy receptors, analysis of apoptotic<br>
membrane proteins, nervous system apoptotic markers, numerous markers for cell cycle and<br>
cellular proliferation, mitotic kinases, bromodeoxyuridine assays, and p53 assays. The efficacy<br>
of the sequences of the present invention may also be evaluated in terms of other agents,<br>
including therapeutic agents, including but not limited to, anti-arthritic agents, or inducers of<br>
apoptosis and cell synchronization reagents as described by Oncogene Research Products, P.O.<br>
Box 12087, La Jolla, California, 92039 (Apoptosis Catalog and Technical Guide 2002-2003,<br>
especially pages 99-104 and pages 214-255). Such agents include but are not limited to<br>
actinomycin D, amphidocolin, A23187, caffeine, camptothecin, cycloheximide, dexamethasone,<br>
doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, hydroxyurea, paclitaxel, staurosporine, thymidine, vmblastme,<br>
retinoic acid, etoposide, okadaic acid, vincristine and methotrexate.<br>
Various in vitro and in vivo assays and models known to one skilled in the art may be<br>
employed for evaluation of the efficacy and optimal dose ranges of sequences, alone or in<br>
combination with a therapeutic agent or agents, for the treatment of arthritis. Animal models<br>
include but are not limited to adjuvant disease models, oily adjuvant-induced models,<br>
microorganisms and their cell wall components-induced models, cartilage components-mduced<br>
models, transgenic and knockout models, non-irnrmmologic osteoarthiitis models, and partial<br>
syndromes models, as described in Waxman, B.H., Scand. J. Immunol., 56:12, 2002. Model<br>
animals include but are not limited to rats, mice, primates, guinea pigs, and rabbits<br>
To determine a cell cycle stage, various assays and procedures known to one skilled in<br>
the art may be employed. One such procedure uses a CYCLETEST™ PLUS DNA commercial<br><br>
kit (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Briefly, nuclei from cells are obtained by dissolving<br>
the cell membrane in a nonionic detergent, eliminating the cell cytoskeleton and nuclear proteins<br>
with trypsin, digesting the cellular KNA with RNase, and stabilizing the nuclear chromatin with<br>
spermine. Propidhun iodide is added to the cell nuclei and their fluorescence was analyzed in a<br>
flow cytometer equipped with electronic doublet discrimination capability (FACSCalibur,<br>
Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NT). Accumulation of cells in G0/G1, early S (SE), mid S<br>
(SM), late S (SL) or G2/M phases of the cell cycle may be analyzed using MODFIT LT software<br>
(Verity Software House Inc., Topsham, MA), or other appropriate software.<br>
Various in vitro and in vivo assays may be used to evaluate the influence of the<br>
extracellular microenvironment on behavior of normal cells and tumor cells. Such assays may<br>
employ MATRIGEL® (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ),which is a solubilized basement<br>
membrane preparation extracted from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm murine sarcoma.<br>
Multicellular spheroids (MS) is an example of a special in vitro assay, in which tumor<br>
cells are cultured in a 3 -dimensional manner to form a "tumor-like" structure. In this system,<br>
there is a reinforcement of cell-cell interactions that mimic microenvironmental conditions of<br>
malignant cells in solid tumors in vivo. In this type of assay, no extracellular matrix components<br>
are added. Cells cultured in this MS system differ from those in 2-dimensional systems<br>
(monolayer culture conditions). Some of these differences are related to structural and functional<br>
differentiation of tumor cells, changes in the cell cycle of tumor cells, "multicellular drug<br>
resistance", and changes in the diffusion and penetration of drugs throughout layers of tumor<br>
cells (reviewed in Green et al., Anticancer Drug Des. 14:153, 1999).<br>
The following examples will serve to further illustrate the present invention without, at<br>
the same time, however, constituting any limitation thereof. On the contrary, it is to be clearly<br>
understood that resort may be had to various other embodiments, modifications, and equivalents<br>
thereof which, after reading the description herein, may suggest themselves to those skilled in<br>
the art without departing from the spirit of the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of nucleotide sequences<br>
Phosphodiester synthetic nucleotide sequences and conjugated 3'-TEG cholesteryl<br>
synthetic nucleotide sequences were prepared by Sigma-Genosys (Woodlands, TX, USA) using<br>
Abacus Segmented Synthesis Technology. Sequences terminating at their 3'-ends with TEG<br>
cholesteryl were synthesized on TEG CPG support (Glen Research, Sterling, VA, USA). The<br>
sequences were dispersed in water or in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) immediately prior to use.<br><br>
All cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,<br>
Rockville, MD) and were cultured in the medium recommended by the ATCC. Breast cancer cell<br>
lines were cultured in medium recommended by the ATCC or described in published articles<br>
(Herrera-Gayol and Jothy, Int. J. Exp. Path., 82:193, 2001). Table 1 shows the cell lines, their<br>
origin and their biopathological characteristics as described in the literature (Hackett et al.,<br>
Cancer Inst, 58:1795, 1977; Price et al., Cancer Res., 50:717, 1990; Thompson et al., J. Cell<br>
Physiol., 150:534,1992; and Peiper M et al., Int. J. Cancer 71: 993, 1997).<br><br>
Example 3<br>
Induction ofapoptosis in MEG-01 cells by SEO ID NO: 5 and SEQ ID NO: 6.<br>
Redistribution of plasma membrane phosphatidylserine is a characteristic of cells<br>
undergoing apoptosis (Martin et al., J. Exp. Med., 182:1545, 1995). The redistribution of<br>
phosphatidylserine in the plasma membrane during apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry<br>
using FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate)-conjugated annexin V (BD Pharmingen, San Diego,<br><br>
CA). MEG-01 cells, a human chronic myelogeneous leukemia cell line positive for the<br>
Philadelphia chromosome and having a BCR-ABL gene fusion, were incubated at 2.5x105<br>
cells/ml for 48 hours with 5.3, 26.5 and 53.0 uM final concentrations of SEQ ID NO:1,<br>
SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:5, SEQ ID NO:6 and cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite molecule.<br>
The percentage of cells in apoptosis after exposure to the SEQ ID NOs:1, 2, 5, 6, or cholesteryl-<br>
TEG phosphoramidite treatment is reported in Table 2. The percentage of apoptosis in untreated<br>
MEG-01 cells was 12%.<br><br>
As shown in Table 2, SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO:2 and cholesteryl-TEG<br>
phosphoramidite are inactive against MEG-01. Unexpectedly the addition of a cholesteryl-TEG<br>
phosphoramidite at the 3'-end of SEQ ID NO:1, resulting in SEQ ED NO: 5, and at the 3'-end of<br>
SEQ ED NO:2, resulting in SEQ ED NO:6, conferred to these inert oligonucleotides the capacity<br>
to induce apoptosis in MEG-01 cells as measured by the translocation of phosphandylserine at<br>
the cell surface.<br>
Example 4<br>
Induction of apoptosis in EL-4 cells by SEQ ID NO:7<br>
EL-4 cells, a murine T lymphoma cell line, were incubated at 2.5X105 cells/ml for<br>
24 hours with 0.53, 5.3 and 53.0 M concentrations of SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:7 or<br>
cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite. The percentage of cells in apoptosis after exposure to SEQ ID<br>
NO:3, SEQ ID NO:7 or cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite treatment is reported in Table 3. The<br>
percentage of apoptosis in untreated EL-4 cells was 7%.<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 3, neither SEQ ID NO:3 nor cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite caused<br>
apoptosis in EL-4 cells. Unexpectedly, the addition of a cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite at the<br>
3'-end of SEQ ID NO:3, resulting in SEQ ID NO:7, conferred to this inert oligonucleotide the<br>
capacity to induce apoptosis in EL-4 cells as measured by the translocation of phosphatidylserine<br>
at the cell surface.<br>
Example 5<br>
Activation of caspase 3 by SEQ ID NO: 7<br>
EL-4 cells (2.5x105 cells/ml) were incubated for 72 hrs with 0 M (control), 53 M of<br>
SEQ ID NO:3 or 53 M of SEQ ID NO:7. After incubation, both control and treated cells were<br>
washed, fixed, permeabilized and incubated with a Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated antibody that<br>
recognizes the active catalytic unit of caspase 3 (Clone: C92-605; BD Pharmingen, San Diego,<br>
CA, USA) using the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Fluorescence associated with<br>
active caspase 3 was analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCALIBUR using the program<br>
CellQUEST (both from Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA). The percentage of cells<br>
containing active caspase 3 in EL-4 cells treated with 53 M of sequences is reported in the<br>
Table 4.<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 4, SEQ ID NO:3 was inactive against EL-4. Unexpectedly the<br>
addition of a cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite at the 3'-end of SEQ ID NO:3, resulting in<br>
SEQ ID NO: 7 conferred to this inert oligonucleotide the capacity to induce apoptosis as<br>
measured by the activation of caspase-3.<br>
Example 6<br>
Cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase by SEQ ID NO: 7<br>
EL-4 cells (2.5X105 cells/ml) were incubated for 72 h with 0 uM (control), 53 M of<br>
SEQ ID NO.3 or 53 uM of SEQ ID NO:7. After incubation, both control and treated cells were<br>
washed, fixed, permeabilized and incubated with an FITC -conjugated antibody that recognizes<br>
specifically the S5 kDa fragments of cleaved PARP (BioSource, Camarillo, CA, USA) using the<br>
conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Fluorescence associated with cleaved PARP was<br>
analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur using the program CellQUEST (both from<br>
Becton Dickinson). The percentage of cells containing cleaved PARP in EL-4 cells treated with<br>
53 M final concentration of sequences is shown in Table 5.<br><br>
As shown in Table 5, SEQ ID NO:3 was inactive against EL-4. Unexpectedly the<br>
addition of a cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite at the 3'-end of SEQ ID NO.3, resulting in<br>
SEQ ID NO.7, conferred to this inert oligonucleotide the capacity to induce apoptosis as<br>
measured by cleavage of PARP.<br>
Example 7<br>
Effect of SEQ ID NO:2 SEQ ID NO.3, SEQ ID N0:4. SEQ ID N0.6, SEQ ID N0:7, and<br>
SEQ ID NO:8 on proliferation of synovial cells<br>
Adherent HIG-82 cells, a synovial cell line, were incubated at 1.0x105 cells/ml for 48<br>
hours with 53 M (final concentration) of SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID<br>
NO:6, SEQ ID NO:7, or SEQ ID NO:8. Cellular proliferation was measured using<br>
dimethylthiazol-diphenyl-tetrazolium (MTT) reduction (Mosman et al., J. Immunol. Methods<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 6, SEQ ID NO.2, SEQ ID NO:3 and SEQ ID NO:4 did not inhibit<br>
proliferation of synovial HIG-82 cells. Unexpectedly the addition of a cholesteryl-TEG<br>
phosphoramidite at the 3'-ends of SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, and SEQ ID NO:4, resulting in<br>
SEQ ID NOs:6, 7, and 8, respectively, conferred the capacity to inhibit the cellular proliferation<br>
of HIG-82 cells.<br>
Example 8<br>
Induction ofapoptosis in proliferating synovial cells by SEQ ID NO:5 and SEQ ID NO:6<br>
Adherent HIG-82 cells were incubated at l.OxlO5 cells/ml for 48 hours with 53 M final<br>
concentration of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:5 or SEQ ID NO.6. Since<br>
phosphatidylserine/annexin V detection of apoptosis was not reliable after adherent cell<br>
harvesting techniques, such as trypsinization (van Engeland, Cytometry, 31:1, 1998), apoptosis<br>
in HIG-82 cells was evaluated using flow cytometry by the detection of fragmented DNA by<br>
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase enzyme-mediated bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate-biotm<br>
nick end-labeling (TUNEL) using a commercial assay (APO-BRDU™ kit; BD Pharmingen).<br>
The percentage of cells containing nuclear DNA fragmentation was determined. After 24 hours,<br>
untreated HIG-82 cells were essentially negative for nuclear DNA fragmentation.<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 7, SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO:2 were inactive against<br>
exponentially growing synovial cells. Unexpectedly the addition of a cholesteryl-TEG<br>
phosphoramidite at the 3'-end of SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO:2, resulting in SEQ ID NO:5<br>
and SEQ ID NO:6, respectively, conferred the capacity to induce apoptosis in HIG-82 cells as<br>
measured by the percentage of cells showing fragmented nuclear DNA.<br>
Example 9<br>
Induction of cell cycle arrest by SEQ ID NO: 6<br>
Exponentially growing MEG-01 cells (2xlO5 cells/ml) were incubated for 24 h with 0<br>
M (control), 53 M of SEQ ID NO:2 or 53 uM of SEQ ID NO:6. The cells were collected,<br>
centrifiiged, and cell cycle stage was determined.<br><br>
As shown in Table 8, SEQ ID NO:2 was inactive against MEG-01 when compared to<br>
untreated control cells. Unexpectedly the addition of a cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite at the<br>
3'-end of SEQ ID NO:2, resulting in SEQ ID NO:6, conferred the capacity to induce cell cycle<br>
arrest at the SL + G2/M phase in MEG-01 cells.<br><br>

Either 20x103 MDA-MB-231 (MDA-231) or Hs578T cells were plated into individual<br>
wells of 24-well plates in regular culture medium (RCM) presence or absence (control) of 53 M<br>
(final concentration) of SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:7, 53 M cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite,<br>
or corresponding control media (regular culture medium (RCM) for SEQ ID NO:3, RCM with<br>
the same amount of water as the amount added with the SEQ ID NO:7, and RCM with the same<br>
amount of acetonitrile as the amount added with cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite). Cells were<br>
cultured for 72 hrs, removed with trypsin and counted with an hemocytometer using the Trypan<br>
blue exclusion technique. Results of three independent assays (mean and standard deviation<br>
(s.d.) of percentage of changes compared to controls) are shown in Table 9.<br><br>
As shown in Table 9, SEQ ID NO:3 and cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite did not<br>
significantly affect cellular proliferation. Unexpectedly, the addition of cholesteryl-TEG<br>
phosphoramidite at the 3' end of SEQ ID NO:3, resulting in SEQ ID NO:7, conferred the<br>
capacity to inhibit cellular proliferation of two highly aggressive toman breast cancer cells.<br>

Changes in 3-dimensional structure formation induced by SEQ ID NO:5 m MATRIGEL®<br>
outgrowth experiments '<br>
MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 (MDA-231), Hs578T and Mpanc-96 cells were cultured<br>
separately in regular culture medium, trypsinized, and counted. 100x103 of MDA-231 cells,<br>
100x103 of Hs578T cells, 150xl03 of MCF-7 cells and 150xl03 of Mpanc-96 cells were<br><br>
separately pre-incubated for 1 hr at 37°C in a final concentration of 53 uM of SEQ ID NO:1, 53<br>
M of SEQ ID NO:5 or RCM, and plated on top of MATRIGEL®-coated plates (MATRIGEL®<br>
Basement membrane matrix coated cellware 24-well plate,) for 3 days. Plates were fixed with<br>
10% formalin. Digital photographs of the cells in the 24-well plates were taken using a Nikon<br>
Coolpix 990 digital camera (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) connected to a Nikon inverted<br>
microscope model TMS. While SEQ ID NO:1 did not change cell morphology, SEQ ID NO:5<br>
prevented the formation of 3-dimensional structures similar to those formed when cells were<br>
cultured in the regular culture medium on MATRIGEL® (see Figure 1).<br>
As shown in Figure 1, SEQ ID NO: 1 was inactive while, unexpectedly, the addition of<br>
cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite at the 3'-end of SEQ ID NO:1, resulting in SEQ ID NO:5,<br>
conferred the capability to prevent formation of 3-dimensional structures similar to those formed<br>
when cells were cultured in regular culture medium on MATRIGEL®. It is believed that SEQ<br>
ID NO:5 interfered with cell-extracellular matrix interactions thereby modulating cell-cell and<br>
cell-extracellular matrix adhesion mechanisms.<br>
Example 12<br>
Changes in 3-dimensional structure formation induced by SEQ ID NO:8 in MATRIGEL®<br>
(Beckton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) outgrowth experiments /'<br>
MDA-MB-231 (MDA-231) and Hs578T were cultured in regular culture medium,<br>
trypsinized and counted. 100x103 of MDA-MB-231 cells or 100x103 of Hs578T cells, were<br>
separately pre-incubated for 1 hr at 37°C in a final concentration of 53 uM of SEQ ID NO:4, 53<br>
uM of SEQ ID NO: 8 or RCM and plated on MATRIGEL®-coated plates for 3 days. Plates were<br>
fixed with 10% formalin. Digital photographs of the cells in the 24-well plates were taken using<br>
a Nikon Coolpix 990 digital camera (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) connected to a Nikon<br>
inverted microscope model TMS. While SEQ ID NO:4 did not change the cellular morphology,<br>
SEQ ID NO: 8 disrupted the growth pattern of tumor cells plated on MATRIGEL® (see Figure<br>
2).<br>
As shown in Figure 2, SEQ ID NO:4 was inactive while, unexpectedly, the addition of<br>
cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite at the 3'-end of SEQ ID NO:4, resulting in SEQ ID NO:8,<br>
conferred the capability to prevent formation of 3-dimension structures, similar to those formed<br>
when cells were cultured in the regular culture medium on MATRIGEL®-coated wells. It is<br>
believed that SEQ ID NO:8 interfered with cell-extracellular matrix interactions thereby<br>
modulating interactions between tumor cells and the ECM components.<br><br>
Example 13<br>
Changes in 3-dimensional structure formation of MCF-7 cells induced by SEQ ID NO:7 in<br>
MATRIGEL® outgrowth experiments<br>
MCF-7 cells were cultured in regular culture medium (RCM), trypsinized and counted.<br>
15OxlO3 of MCF-7 cells, in wells of 24-well plates coated with 350 ul of MATRIGEL®. After<br>
the formation of 3-dimensional structures during 48 hrs without any treatment, the medium was<br>
changed and the structures were exposed to a final concentration of 53 uM of SEQ ID NO.3, 53<br>
M of SEQ ID NO:7, 53 uM of cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite, RCM or their respective<br>
control media (RCM with water, RCM with DMSO, or RCM with acetonitrile). The treatments<br>
were repeated every 3-4 days until a maximum time in culture of 19-20 days. The experiment<br>
was repeated three times. Digital photographs of the cells in the 24-well plates were taken using<br>
a Nikon Coolpix 990 digital camera connected to a Nikon inverted microscope model TMS.<br>
While the respective control media (data not shown), SEQ ID NO:3 and cholesteryl-TEG<br>
phosphoramidite did not affect the 3-dimensional structures compared to controls, SEQ ID NO:7<br>
disrupted the growth pattern of the structures thereby affecting cell-cell and cell-extracellular<br>
matrix interactions (see Figure 3).<br>
As shown in Figure 3, SEQ ID NO:3 and cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite were inactive while,<br>
unexpectedly, the addition of cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite at the 3'-end of SEQ ID NO:3,<br>
resulting in SEQ ID NO.7, conferred the capability to disrupt pre-formed 3-dimensional<br>
structures.<br>
Example 14<br>
Changes in 3-dimensional structure formation of MDA-MB-231 cells induced by SEQ ID NO:7<br>
in MATRIGEL® outgrowth experiments<br>
The MDA-MB-231 (MDA-231) cells were cultured in regular culture medium,<br>
trypsinized and counted. 100x103 of MDA-231 cells were plated in regular culture medium<br>
(RCM), in wells of 24-well plates coated with 350 ul of MATRIGEL®. After the formation of 3-<br>
dimensional structures during 48 hrs without any treatment, the medium was changed, and<br>
structures were exposed to a final concentration of 53 uM of SEQ ID NO:3, 53 M of<br>
SEQ ID NO:7, 53 M of cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite, RCM, or their respective control<br>
media (RCM with water, RCM with DMSO or RCM with acetonitrile). The treatments were<br>
repeated every 3-4 days until a maximum time in culture of 17-21 days. The experiment was<br>
repeated three times. Digital photographs of the cells in the 24-well plates were taken using a<br>
Nikon Coolpix 990 digital camera connected to a Nikon inverted microscope model TMS. While<br><br>
the respective control media (data not shown), SEQ ID NO:3 and cholesteryl-TEG<br>
phosphoramidite did not affect the 3-dimensional structures, being similar to the structures<br>
cultured in the RCM (negative control medium), SEQ ID NO:7 disrupted the growth pattern of<br>
the structures thereby affecting cell-cell and cell-extracellulaT matrix interactions (see Figure 4).<br>
As shown in Figure 4, SEQ ID NO:3 and cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite were inactive while,<br>
unexpectedly, the addition of cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite at the 3'-end of SEQ ID NO:3,<br>
resulting in SEQ ID NO:7, conferred the capability to disrupt 3-dimensional structures by<br>
interfering with cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions.<br>
Example 15<br>
Changes in cell cycle induced by SEQ ID NO: 7 when the Hs578T cells were cultured as<br>
multicelhdar spheroids /<br>
About 100x103 Hs578T cells per spheroid were cultured in presence of 53 M final<br>
concentration of SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:7, 53 M final concentration of cholesteryl-TEG<br>
phosphoramidite (cholTEG) or corresponding control media (regular culture medium (RCM),<br>
RCM with the same amount of water (RCMW) as the amount added with the SEQ ID NO: 7, and<br>
RCM with the same amount of acetonitrile (RCMA) as the amount added with cholesteryl-TEG<br>
phosphoramidite). Five spheroids per each experimental condition were cultured for 72 hrs.<br>
Afterwards, cell cycle progression was evaluated by propidium iodide (PI) staining (Calbiochem,<br>
Novabiochem Corporation, San Diego, CA) using a FACScalibur flow cytometer (Becton<br>
Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Changes in the percentage of cells in the different phases of the<br>
cell cycle were analyzed using MODFIT LT software (Verity Software House Inc). Results are<br>
shown in Figure 5.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, SEQ ID NO:3, cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite or control media did not<br>
significantly modify cell cycle progression compared to those spheroids exposed to the regular<br>
culture medium alone. Unexpectedly, exposure to SEQ ID NO:7 increased the percentage of<br>
cells in G2M and S-phase and decrease the percentage of cells in Go/G, (p
test). The addition of cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite conferred to an inactive oligonucleottde<br>
tested in the MS assay the capacity to modify cell cycle progression in a complex 3-dimensional<br>
system that mimics several biopathological characteristics of in vivo tumors.<br><br>
Example 16<br>
Changes in the release of nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA) by MDA-MB-231 human<br>
breast cancer cells wiien incubated with SEQ ID NO: 5<br>
MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured as mono-layers in respective control media, with 53<br>
M final concentration of SEQ ID NO:1 or 53 M final concentration of SEQ ED NO: 5 for 72<br>
hrs. The release of nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA) was used as a measure of<br>
apoptosis. NuMA was determined using a commercial (ELISA kit (Oncogene, Cambridge, MA)<br>
following the manufacturer's protocol. Results are shown in Table 10 and are expressed as the<br>
percentage increase in NuMA release compared to respective controls based on optical density<br>
measurements.<br>
Table 10<br>
Changes in the release of nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA) in MDA-MB-231 human<br>
breast cancer cells<br><br>
As shown in Table 10, the release of nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA) increased<br>
by 430% after cells were incubated with SEQ ID NO:5. Unexpectedly, the addition of<br>
cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite to the 3' end of SEQ ID NO: 1, resulting in SEQ ID NO:5,<br>
conferred the capacity to induce apoptosis.<br>
Example 17<br>
Changes in the release of nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA) by Hs578T human breast<br>
cancer cells when incubated with SEQ ID NO:6<br>
Hs578T cells were cultured as monolayer in negative control conditions or with 53 uM<br>
final concentraition of SEQ ID NO:2, 53 M of SEQ ID NO:6 for 72 hrs. The release of nuclear<br>
mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA) was used as a measure of apoptosis. NuMA was determined<br>
using a commercial ELISA kit following the manufacturer's protocol. Results are shown in Table<br>
11 and are expressed as the percentage increase in NuMA release compared to control conditions<br>
based on optical density measurements.<br><br><br>
Table 11<br>
Changes in the release of nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA) by Hs578T human breast<br>
cancer cells<br>
As shown in Table 11, the release of nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA) increased<br>
by 288% after cells were incubated with SEQ ID NO:6 Unexpectedly, the addition of<br>
cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite to the 31 end of SEQ ID NO:2 conferred to an inactive<br>
oligonucleotide the capacity to induce apoptosis.<br>
Example 18<br>
Effect of SEQ ID NO: 1 SEQ ID NO.2, SEQ ID N0:5, and SEQ ID NO: 6 on MEG-01 cells in<br>
athymic nude mice<br>
MEG-01 cells are inoculated subcutaneously into athymic nude mice as previously<br>
described (Takeo et al., Leukemia 7:1286, 1993). The mice are divided into 13 groups of 10<br>
mice. On day 0, group 1 mice receive saline, group 2 mice receive 1 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:1, group<br>
3 mice receive 10 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:1, group 4 mice receive 100 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:1, group 5<br>
mice receive 1 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:2, group 6 mice receive 10 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:2, group 7<br>
mice receive 100 mg/kg SEQ ID NO.2, group 8 mice receive 1 mg/kg, SEQ ID NO:5, group 9<br>
mice receive 10 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:5, group 10 mice receive 100 mg/kg SEQ ID NO.5, group<br>
11 mice receive 1 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:6, group 12 mice receive 10 mg/kg SEQ ID NO.6 and<br>
group 13 mice receive 100 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:6 After 4 weeks of treatment, the mice are<br>
sacrificed and tumor mass is determined. Mice in groups 8-13 have less tumor mass than mice in<br>
groups 1-7. Mice in groups 8-13 display less tumor mass in a dose-dependent fashion.<br>
Example 19<br>
Effect of SEQ ID NO: 3 and SEQ ID NO: 7 on growth of lymphoma cells in mice<br>
EL-4 murine T lymphoma cells are implanted subcutaneously into C57/BL6 mice as<br>
previously described (Krawczyk et al., Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 40:347, 1995). The mice<br>
are divided into 7 groups of 10 mice. On day 0, group 1 mice receive saline, group 2 mice<br>
receive 1 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:3, group 3 mice receive 10 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:3, group 4 mice<br>
receive 100 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:3, group 5 mice receive 1 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:7, group 6 mice<br><br>
receive 10 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:7, group 7 mice receive 100 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:7. After 4 weeks<br>
of treatment, the mice are sacrificed and tumor mass is determined. Groups 5-7 have less tumor<br>
mass than mice in groups 1-4. Mice in groups 5-7 display less tumor mass in a dose-dependent<br>
fashion.<br>
Example 20<br>
Effect of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:5 and SEQ ID NO:6 on rats with<br>
streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis s^<br>
Streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis in LEW/N rats resembles a localized neoplasm<br>
consisting of, in part, of a proliferative and invasive population of fibroblast-like synovial cells<br>
(Yocum et al., Am. J. Pathol. 132:38, 1988). The arthritis is induced in LEW/N rats by intra-<br>
articular injection of streptocococcal cell wall (SCW) from group A Streptococcus pyogenes.<br>
The rats are divided into 13 groups of 10 rats. On day 0, group 1 rats receive SCW, group 2 rats<br>
receive SCW + 1 mg/kg SEQ ED NO:1, group 3 rats receive SCW + 10 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:1,<br>
group 4 rats receive SCW + 100 mg/kg SEQ ID NO: 1, group 5 rats receive SCW + 1 mg/kg<br>
SEQ ID NO:2, group 6 rats receive SCW + 10 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:2, group 7 rats receive SCW +<br>
100 mg/kg SEQ ID NO.-2, group 8 rats receive SCW + 1 mg/kg SEQ ID NO.5, group 9 rats<br>
receive SCW + 10 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:5, group 10 rats receive SCW + 100 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:5,<br>
group 11 rats receive SCW + 1 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:6, group 12 rats receive SCW + 10 mg/kg<br>
SEQ ID NO:6, group 13 rats receive SCW + SEQ ID NO:6. The joint inflammation is monitored<br>
daily for two weeks. Group 8-13 rats show less inflammation than group 1-7 rats. Rats in groups<br>
8-13 have less inflammation in a dose-dependent fashion.<br>
Example 21<br>
Effect of sequences conjugated with TEG cholesteryl on cell morphology and cell cycle when<br>
cancer cells are grown as monolayers, on MATRIGEL® or as multicelhdar spheroids<br>
Different types of malignant cell lines from breast, pancreas, colon, ovary and prostate<br>
are cultured as monolayers, on MATRIGEL®-coated wells or as multicelmlar spheroids (MS).<br>
Cells are treated individually with oligonucleotide sequences of different lengths (3 and 6 bases)<br>
with or without conjugated cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite for at least 1-3 days. Such<br>
sequences include, but are not limited to SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO.5, SEQ ID NO:2,<br>
SEQ ID NO:6, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:7; SEQ ID NO.4, or SEQ ID NO:8. Cell<br>
proliferation/necrosis (measured by Trypan blue exclusion), apoptosis (measured by flow<br>
cytometry, release of nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA), detection of fragmented DNA<br>
by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase enzyme-mediated bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate-<br><br>
biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL)), cell cycle progression studied by flow cytometry (PI<br>
staining) and morphology of tumor cells plated on MATRIGEL®-coated wells or as<br>
multicellular spheroids (MS) are studied.<br>
Oligonucleotide sequences conjugated with cholesteryl-TEG phosphoramidite increase<br>
cell death (necrosis and apoptosis), modify cell cycle progression when cells are cultured as MS<br>
or on MATRIGEL®-coated plates, and change cell morphology when cells are cultured as MS<br>
or on MATRIGEL®-coated wells. Unconjugated oligonucleotides are inactive.<br>
Example 22<br>
Effect of SEQ ID NO: 3 and SEQ ID NO:7 on MDA-MB-231 xenotransplanted tumors<br>
MDA-MB-231 cells are xenotransplanted subcutaneously into nude mice. The mice are<br>
divided into 7 groups of 10 mice. After the tumors reach 5 mm in diameter, group 1 mice receive<br>
saline, group 2 mice receive 0.5 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:3, group 3 mice receive 5 mg/kg<br>
SEQ ID NO:3, group 4 mice receive 50 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:3, group 5 mice receive 0.5 mg/kg<br>
SEQ ID NO:7, group 6 mice receive 5 mg/kg SEQ ID NO.7, group 7 mice receive 50 mg/kg<br>
SEQ ID NO:7. Treatments are given intravenously every 3 days for 6 doses maximum. Mice are<br>
sacrificed when tumor reach 1 cm in diameter, at any sign of distress or at the end of the study (3<br>
months from cell injection). Complete autopsies are performed. Tumor mass, presence of<br>
invasion and metastasis are determined. Groups 5-7 have less tumor mass than group 1-4 mice.<br>
Mice in groups 5-7 display less tumor mass in a dose-dependent fashion.<br>
Example 23<br>
Effect of SEQ ID NO: 3 and SEQ ID NO:7 on MDA-MB-231 xenotransplanted tumors<br>
Breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells are xenotransplanted subcutaneously in nude mice<br>
(lx107 cells). The mice are divided into 7 groups of 10 mice. After the tumors reach 5 mm in<br>
diameter, group 1 mice receive saline, group 2 mice receive 0.4 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:3, group 3<br>
mice receive 4 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:3, group 4 mice receive 40 mg/kg SEQ ID NO.3, group 5<br>
mice receive 0.4 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:7, group 6 mice receive 4 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:7, group 7<br>
mice receive 40 mg/kg SEQ ID NO:7. Treatments are given intravenously every 3 days for 6<br>
doses maximum. Mice are sacrificed when tumor reach 1 cm in diameter, at any sign of distress<br>
or at the end of the study (3 months from cell injection). Complete autopsies are performed.<br>
Tumor mass, presence of invasion and metastasis are determined. Groups 5-7 have less tumor<br>
mass and metastasis than group 1-4 mice. Mice in groups 5-7 display less tumor mass and<br>
metastasis in a dose-dependent fashion.<br><br>
