				<td>The present invention relates to a carbon supported activated alumina adsorbent useful for the removal of fluoride ions from water. The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of carbon supported activated alumina adsorbent useful for the removal of fluoride ions from water.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Even though water is abundantly available on the earth in the form of<br>
oceans, lakes, rivers etc., only a little portion is fit for drinking purposes. Hence,<br>
most of the rural population depends on the ground water. The poor quality of<br>
ground water makes the people to suffer due to different diseases. The problem of<br>
excessive fluorides in drinking water is a matter of serious concern around the<br>
world. Fluoride as low as 1ppm (mg\L) causes breakdown of collagen, the most<br>
abundant of the body's protein at 30%. The concentration above 2ppm gives<br>
permanent teeth a chalky-white appearance or the mottled brown-satin coloration to<br>
children less than 10 years of age. Fluoride above 4ppm in drinking water can<br>
cause a condition of dense and brittle bones, known as osteoporosis, or marble<br>
bones called skeleton fluorosis. Fluoride replaces hydroxides in bones and thus is<br>
deposited in bones and causes chronic effect, known as skeleton fluorosis. The<br>
acceptable limits of fluoride ion in drinking water according to W. H. O. is	1.5<br>
mg / litre of water. Hence it is utmost important to purify the water before its use. by Adsorption technology for removal of fluoride ion from water is one of the commercially viable technology.<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of carbon supported activated alumina adsorbent useful for removal of fluoride ion from water.<br>
An invention relating to a process in removing fluoride ion from waste water from silicon processing, through neutralization was disclosed in a US patent No.US6436297 This invention highlights the method based on physicochemical processing for the removal of F'form water using milk of lime (Ca(OH)2 suspended in water) which is based on the spontaneous precipitation in the form of calcium<br>
fluoride (CaF2) of the fluoride ions in the presence of  calcium ions following the equation:<br>
Reference may be made to another US patent 2059553 discloses the removal of fluoride by adsorption process on the activated alumina in presence of alkali metals. The pH of the water is maintained at 4-8. Reference may be made to yet another US patent 2043705 gave a comparative study of the adsorption properties of the hydroxides of aluminium, iron, zinc and manganese based on the precipitation method. Among all aluminium hydroxide is observed as the best. A publication by A.M.Raichur in separation and purification Technology (24 (2001) 121-127), explained about the removal of F" using rare earth oxides. Another publication by R. H. Me kee in Industrial Enganeering chemistry (26 (1934) 849) reveals the defluoridation by active carbon. Yet another reference may be made to a publication on defluoridation by R. Leyva Ramos , et al in Carbon (37 (1999) 609-619), which reports the use of Al impregnated on activated carbon using aluminum nitrate precursor. This catalyst adsorbs F" in acidic condition (i.e. pH- 3).<br>
The main limitations of the above mentioned patents and publications are:<br>
1.	Adsorption processes requires acidic conditions.<br>
2.	Addition of alkali metal ions for best adsorption.<br>
3.	In the precipitation method the separation of the pure water is a tedious<br>
process and there is no recovery of the catalyst.<br>
On the contrary, the present invention highlights the very simple way of making a highly efficient adsorbent for removal of fluoride ion without using alkali metal ions and easy way of operation i.e., in neutral pH-conditions.<br>
Objectives of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to utilize the combined characteristics of alumina (aluminum hydroxide) and carbon prepared through deposition - precipitation route.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to prepare carbon supported activated alumina wherein the activated alumina precursor is selected from aluminum nitrate and the precipitating agent is selected from ammonia solution.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a process for the removal of high F" levels in the drinking water by using carbon supported activated alumina, as absorbent.<br>
Still another object is to provide a process wherein the defluoridation step can be performed at neutral PH. <br>

Detail description of the invention<br>
Activated alumina can be applied as a successful defluoridation medium. Out of the several advantages associated with the usage of alumina, its specificity for F" and a relatively high exchange capacity of this ion are the major ones for it to acts as an efficient defluoridation material. The mechanism behind its action is chemisorption where activated alumina acts as an anianite, charged with S042" ions. During the processes of activation of alumina with aluminum sulphate, the formation of a complex-ligand takes place in the initial stage which then acts as an anion exchanger in the next stage for the removal of F" by the exchange of SO42" with F". Further, the sorption capacity of the material may be restored by using a regeneration solution like NaOH.<br>
The common adsorbents viz., carbon and alumina have certain advantages and drawbacks in terms of their performance towards the removal of fluoride.<br>
The present report discloses the use of a novel adsorbent carbon supported activated alumina (CSAA) which posses both the advantageous characteristics of carbon and alumina viz., the high specific surface area associated with activated carbon and high sorption capacity of alumina towards F'. Carbon supported activated alumina has an added advantage of its usage in the neutral pH unlike alumina and alumina impregnated carbon which are found to be efficient only in acidic pH. It is more efficient compared to carbon in terms of its sorption capacity towards F". However the working principle of CSAA is similar to that of alumina but more efficient and works even in the neutral pH. The advantage of carbon supported activated alumina is the formation smaller activated alumina crystallites on the carbon. Activated alumina is better dispersed on activated carbon because activated carbon is a high surface area material.<br>
The following examples are given by the way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention<br>
Example-1<br>
A series of carbon supported activated alumina with varying carbon loading 5 to 50 wt. %, are prepared by deposition precipitation method. Finely powdered activated carbon is added to the aqueous solution containing requisite amount of 10% aluminum nitrate by weight. It is precipitated with 5% ammonia solution by adding drop-wise slowly under vigorous stirring conditions until the pH reaches to a value of 10. The precipitated aluminum hydroxide deposited on activated carbon is filtered with thorough washings until the pH of the filtrate reaches to neutral. These precipitates are kept for drying at 120 °c for over night in the oven. The dried catalysts are calcined at 350°C for 3h under nitrogen atmosphere. These calcined catalysts are activated with aluminum sulphate. 10 gm catalyst is soaked in a 100 ml of 3 % aluminum sulphate solution for 1h followed by decantation and washings thoroughly with deionised water to bring the neutral pH. The catalysts are dried for 4h in oven at 120°C. The catalysts thus prepared are ready for the reaction. The catalyst with carbon contents of 5%, 15%, 25% and 50% by weight are designated as CSAA 5, CSAA 15, CSAA 25 and CSAA 50 respectively.<br>
Example-2<br>
The defluoridation ability of the three catalysts, two are commercially available alumina (obtained from M/S Sude Chemie, India) and activated carbon (Source : Norrit obtained from M/S. Fluka, Netherlands) and the other is CSAA 25 as prepared in Example-l are shown in Table - 1. The fluoridated water with F" concentration of 20ppm is prepared by dissolving requisite amount of NaF in deionized water. The 20ppm F" containing water is passed continuously over the catalyst of 1 gram, taken in a fixed bed glass reactor (10 mm diameter and 200 mm long). The concentration of the fluoride ion present in the out let water after 5h is analyzed using a Advanced lon-Chromatograph (M/S. Metrohm Switzerland) with conductivity detector and with anion column Sup - 5 and mixture of aqueous<br>
solution containing sodium carbonate and bicarbonate. It is clearly observed that the catalyst prepared in the Example-l is the best adsorbent among the three adsorbents. The fluoride adsorption capacity of CSAA 25 as prepared in the Example-l is twice than that of the y-AfeOa and is approximately 25 times more active than activated carbon which is given in the Table-1.<br>
Example-3<br>
The F" adsorption capacities of different samples of activated alumina with varying compositions of carbon are listed in Table-2. A flow of 20ppm F" water is passed continuously over the catalysts CSAA 5, CSAA 15, CSAA 25 and CSAA 50 separately and the concentration of F" at the out let after 6h, is analyzed by advanced ion-Chromatograph with conductivity detector and with anion column Sup - 5 and mixture of aqueous solution containing sodium carbonate and bicarbonate . The increase in carbon content up to 50 wt% by weight enhanced the adsorption capacity.<br>
Example-4<br>
The defluoridation capability of CSAA 25 at regular internals is listed in the Table-3. The 20ppm F" containing water is passed continuously over the catalyst of 1 gram, taken in a fixed bed glass reactor (10 mm diameter and 200 mm long). The concentration of the fluoride ion present in the out let water at regular intervals is analyzed using an Advanced lon-Chromatograph with conductivity detector and with anion column Sup - 5 and mixture of aqueous solution containing sodium carbonate and bicarbonate. The data explains the excellent defluoridation capability of CSAA <br><br><br><br>
