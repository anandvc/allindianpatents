				<td>Process for the preparation of sulphonamide-substituted imidazotriazinones<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of sulphonamide-substituted imidazotriazinones.<br>
It is known that compounds which are able to inhibit cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate-metabolizing phosphodiesterases (cGMP PDEs) can be employed for the treatment of impotence (cf., for example, EP-B 0 702 555; K. Murray, Drugs, News &amp; Perspectives 6 (1993), 150).<br>
In WO 99/24433, sulphonamide-substituted imidazotriazinones are described as potent inhibitors of either one or more of the cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate-metabolizing phosphodiesterases (cGMP PDEs). According to the nomenclature of Beavo and Reifsnyder (Trends in Pharmacol. Sci. 11, 150-155, 1990), these cGMP PDEs are the phosphodiesterase isoenzymes PDE-I, PDE-H and PDE-V.<br>
According to WO 99/24433, the sulphonamide-substituted imidazotriazinones described therein are prepared from corresponding 2-ethoxyphenyl-substituted imidazotriazinones by reaction with chlorosulphonic acid and subsequent reaction with an appropriate amine, as is illustrated by the following scheme (R1 TO R6 here have the meanings indicated in WO 99/24433):<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
In this process, highly reactive chlorosulphonic acid has to be used as a reagent. Moreover, the imidazotriazinonesulphonyl chlorides formed as intermediates are sensitive to hydrolysis, which, in particular in the conversion of this preparation process to the industrial scale, can lead to not inconsiderable yield variations.<br>
It was therefore the object of the present invention to make available a process'for the preparation of sulphonamide-substituted imidazotriazinones in which the disadvantages of the above process known from the prior art are avoided.<br>
This object is achieved according to the present invention by a process as in Claim 1. In particular, in the process according to the invention as in Claim 1 the use of chlorosulphonic acid is avoided by introduction of the sulphonic acid via a reaction with sulphuric acid and subsequent reaction with thionyl chloride. Moreover, the reaction with thionyl chloride and the subsequent reaction with an amine is carried out in a one-pot process, so that the imidazotriazinonesulphonyl chloride intermediate, which is sensitive to hydrolysis, does not need to be isolated. By means of this, yield variations on account of partial hydrolysis of this intermediate can be<br>
excluded. As a result of these advantages, the process according to the invention is much simpler to carry out on the industrial scale than the process described in WO 99/24433.<br>
The process according to the invention comprises the preparation of compounds of the formula (I)<br>

The compounds of the general formula (XI) are known per se or can be prepared according to customary methods. For example, according to WO 99/24433, these are accessible from the corresponding phenol derivatives by etherification.

Suitable solvents for these reactions are the customary organic solvents which do not change under the reaction conditions. These are preferably alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or iso-propanol, ethers such as diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, glycol dimethyl ether, or hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, cyclohexane or petroleum fractions, or halogenohydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, trichloromethane, tetrachloromethane, dichloroethane, trichloroethylene or chlorobenzene, or ethyl acetate, dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoramide, acetonitrile, acetone, dimethoxyethane or pyridine or acetic acid. It is likewise possible to use mixtures of the solvents mentioned.<br>

The reaction of the compound of the formula (XBI) with hydrazine hydrate is particularly preferably carried out in methanol.<br>
These reactions are in general carried out at normal pressure. However, it is also possible to work at elevated pressure or at reduced pressure (e.g. in a range from 0.5 to 5 bar).<br>
The reaction temperature can in general be varied within a relatively wide range. In general, the reaction is carried out in a range from -20°C to 200°C, preferably from 0°C tol00°C.<br>
The reaction of the compounds of the formula (XI) to give the compounds of the formula (XH) is carried out in the presence of a base.

The compounds according to the invention are inhibitors of cGMP-metabolizing PDEs and are already described in WO 99/24433.<br>
The present invention is shown in greater detail below with the aid of non-restricting preferred examples and comparison examples. If not stated otherwise, all quantitative data relate to percentages by weight.<br>
