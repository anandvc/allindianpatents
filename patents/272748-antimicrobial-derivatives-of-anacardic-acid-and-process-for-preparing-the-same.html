PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION<br>
Section 10<br>
Antimicrobial derivatives of anacardic acid and process for<br>
preparing the same<br>
Unichem Laboratories Ltd., an Indian company of Mahalaxmi Chambers, 22 Bhulabhai Desai Road, Mumbai - 400026, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes and the nature of this invention:<br>
 <br>
Field of invention:<br>
The invention discloses derivatives of anacardic acid having anti-microbial activity against microorganisms more specifically towards Stapphalococcus aureus and Methicillin resistant Stapphalococcus aureus (MRSA) and process for preparing said derivatives.<br>
Background of invention:<br>
Anacardic acid is a non-isoprenoid long chain phenolic acid primarily obtained from the nut shells of the plant Anacardium occidentale native of South America. The solvent extracted cashewnut shell liquid (CNSL) is a rich source of many long chain phenolic compounds of which anacardic acids constitutes about 60-65% of the CNSL. The other major long chain constituents being cardol a dihydric component (15-20%) and cardanol a phenolic compound (10%).<br>
The long aliphatic side chain of these phenolic constituents exists as a mixture of monoene, diene and triene, with the saturated component being present in negligible amount. Anacardic acids in CNSL exists as a mixture of monoene (38.4%), diene (17.4%) and triene (44.1 %).<br>
CNSL has for a long time being used as a raw material for the manufacture of polymers, paints, varnishes, brake linings etc. Apart from the industrial uses, the nut shell oil has also been used in the traditional medicine world wide for the treatment of inflammation, diarrhea, treatment of cracked foot etc.<br>
Anacardic acid (6-pentadecyl salicylic acid) has been screened for various biological activities. It has been shown to be an inhibitor of lipoxygenase and xanthine oxidase. The antibacterial properties of anacardic acids has also been extensively studied by various groups. Kubo et al studied the anti bacterial activity of the monoene (C15:1), diene (C15:2), triene(C15:3) and saturated (C15:0) anacardic acids against Stapphalococcus aureus and Methicillin resistant Stapphalococcus aureus. They have shown that the triene (C15:3) has a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 6.5µg/mL while the saturated anacardic acid (C15:0) has a MIC of 1600 µg/mL against<br>
2<br>
 <br>
MRSA. They have also studied the effect of the length of the side chain on the antibacterial activity and showed that the antibacterial activity was greater as the length of the alkyl chain increased.<br>
Though a lot of study has been done to use the naturally occurring anacardic acids as such or in combination with known antibiotics to demonstrate the antimicrobial activity, there are no reports on the synthetic modifications of anacardic acids to enhance their antimicrobial activity.<br>
Antibiotic resistance is a very serious problem in the hospitals and is growing at a rapid pace. Resistant strains have been isolated for almost all the existing antibiotics. With the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance there is a dire need for an effective molecule to combat this problem. The objective of this invention is to enhance the antimicrobial activity of saturated anacardic acid (C15:0) especially against MRSA, by synthetic modifications.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
The present invention discloses antimicrobial derivativer of anacardic acid and process for preparing said derivative. The invention specifically relates to the process for the preparation of antimicrobial derivatives of saturated anacardic acid (C15:0) .The mixture of anacardic acids chromatographically purified from CNSL was hydrogenated using Pd-C to get the saturated anacardic acid (Cis:o). Said derivatives were prepared by adopting the techniques used in synthetic chemistry for nitration, halogenation and acetylation of various organic compounds. The synthesized derivatives were assayed for anti bacterial activity against Stapphalococcus aureus and Methicillin resistant Stapphalococcus aureus by the broth assay used for antibiotic sucesptibility tests and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) determined. The derivatives showed a MIC of 1-10 µg/mL and MBC of 2-10 µg/mL against MRSA and Stapphalococcus aureus. A few of the derivatives showed a MBC of 2 µg/mL and MIC of 1 µg/mL.<br>
3<br>
 <br>
The invention provides for process for preparation of 6-Pentadecyl-2-acetyloxybenzoic acid, 3,5-Dinitro-6-pentadecyl-2-hydroxybenzoic, 3,4-Dinitro-6-pentadecyl-2-hydroxybenzoic, 3,5-Dinitro-6-pentadecyl-2-acetyloxybenzoic, 3,4-Dinitro-6-pentadecyl-2-acetyloxybenzoic acid, 3,5-Dibromo-6-pentadecyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3-nitro-6-pentadecyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3-nitro-6-pentadecyl-2-acetyloxybenzoic acid, 5-nitro-6-pentadecyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 5-nitro-6-pentadecyl-2-acetyloxybenzoic acid, 4-nitro-6-pentadecyl-2-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-nitro-6-pentadecyl-2-acetyloxybenzoic acid and their use for preventing the growth of microorganisms including gram-negative or gram positive microorganisms such as Stapphalococcus aureus, and Methicillin resistant Stapphalococcus aureus etc.<br>
Detailed description of the invention:<br>
The following examples are provided to illustrate the different embodiments of the invention:<br>
Example-1: Preparation of 6-Pentadecyl-2-acetyloiybenzoic acid (AAA):  A<br>
mixture of saturated anacardic acid (100 mg, 0.287 mmol) and acetyl chloride (5ml) was stirred at room temperature for 3 hrs. The reaction mixture was poured into ice-cold water. The product precipitated out and was extracted into ethyl acetate (25ml x 2). The ethyl acetate layer was washed with water (25 ml x 4) and dried over anhydrous Na2S04. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue obtained was triturated with hexane at 10°C. The solid obtained was separated by centrifugation, washed with hexane and dried under vacuum. The yield obtained was 85%( 92 mg). The product had a melting point of 62- 66 °C.<br>
Example-2: Preparation of 3,5-Dinitro-6-pentadecyl-2-bydroxybenzoic acid (DAA): A suspension of anacardic acid (200 mg, 0.574 mmol) in cone. H2SO4 (8ml) was cooled to 0°C. To the cold mixture, cone.
