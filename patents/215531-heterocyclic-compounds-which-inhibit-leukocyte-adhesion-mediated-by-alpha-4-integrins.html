State of the Art<br>
[0033] VLA-4 that is very late antigen-4(also referred to as a4b1 integrin and CD49d/CD29), first<br>
identified by Hemler and Takada,1 is a member of the b1 integrin family of<br>
cell surface receptors, each of which comprises two subunits, an a chain and a<br>
b chain. VLA-4 contains an a4 chain and a b1 chain. There are at least nine<br>
ÃŸ1 integrins, all sharing the same ÃŸ1 chain and each having a distinct a chain.<br>
These nine receptors all bind a different complement of the various cell matrix<br>
molecules, such as fibronectin, laminin, and collagen. VLA.-4, for example,<br>
binds to fibronectin. VLA-4 also binds non-matrix molecules that are<br>
expressed by endothelial and other cells. These non-matrix molecules include<br>
VCAM-1 that is, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 which is expressed on cytokine-<br>
activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells in culture. Distinct epitopes of<br>
VLA-4 are responsible for the fibronectin and VCAM-1 binding activities and<br>
each activity has been shown to be inhibited independently.2<br>
[0034] Intercellular adhesion mediated by VLA-4 and other cell surface<br>
receptors is associated with a number of inflammatory responses. At the site<br>
of an injury or other inflammatory stimulus, activated vascular endothelial<br>
cells express molecules that are adhesive for leukocytes. The mechanics of<br>
leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells involves, in part, the recognition and<br>
binding of cell surface receptors on leukocytes to the corresponding cell<br>
surface molecules on endothelial cells. Once bound, the leukocytes migrate<br>
across the blood vessel wall to enter the injured site and release chemical<br>
mediators to combat infection. For reviews of adhesion receptors of the<br>
immune system, see, for example, Springer3 and Osborn.4<br>
[0035] Inflammatory brain disorders, such as experimental autoimmune<br>
encephalomyelitis (EAE), multiple sclerosis (MS) and meningitis, are<br>
examples of central nervous system disorders in which the<br>
endothelium/leukocyte adhesion mechanism results in destruction to otherwise<br>
healthy brain tissue. Large numbers of leukocytes migrate across the blood<br>
brain barrier (BBB) in subjects with these inflammatory diseases. The<br>
leukocytes release toxic mediators that cause extensive tissue damage resulting<br>
in impaired nerve conduction and paralysis.<br>
[0036] In other organ systems, tissue damage also occurs via an adhesion<br>
mechanism resulting in migration or activation of leukocytes. For example, it<br>
has been shown that the initial insult following myocardial ischemia to heart<br>
tissue can be further complicated by leukocyte entry to the injured tissue<br>
causing still further insult (Vedder et al.).5 Other inflammatory or medical<br>
conditions mediated by an adhesion mechanism include, by way of exaraple,<br>
asthma6-8, Alzheimer"s disease, atherosclerosis,9-10 AIDS dementia,11 diabetes12-<br>
14 (including acute juvenile onset diabetes), inflammatory bowel disease15<br>
(including ulcerative colitis and Crohn"s disease), multiple sclerosis,16-17<br>
rheumatoid arthritis,18-21 tissue transplantation,22 tumor metastasis,23-28<br>
meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, and other cerebral traumas, nephritis, retinitis,<br>
atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, myocardial ischemia and acute leukocyte-<br>
mediated lung injury such as that which occurs in adult respiratory distress<br>
syndrome.<br>
[0037] Substituted aminopyrimidines, as a class, have been disclosed as<br>
inhibiting binding of VLA-4 to VCAM-1 and, accordingly, exhibit anti-<br>
inflammatory properties.29 While these compounds possess antagonist<br>
properties to such binding, enhanced bioavailability of these compounds<br>
would augment their efficacy.<br>
[0038] This invention is directed to the discovery that certain N-[2-N",N"-<br>
diethylamino-5-aminosulfonylphenylpyrimidin-4-yl]-p-carbomyloxy-<br>
pbenylalanine compounds possess unexpectedly superior bioavailability, as<br>
measured by their AUC, as compared to other substituted aminopyrimidine<br>
compounds previously disclosed.<br>

[0073] As above, this invention relates to compounds which inhibit leukocyte<br>
adhesion and, in particular, leukocyte adhesion mediated at least in part by a4<br>
integrins, preferably VLA-4. However, prior to describing this invention in<br>
further detail, the following terms will first be defined.<br>
Definitions<br>
[0074] Unless otherwise stated, the following terms used in the specification<br>
and claims have the meanings given below:<br>
[0075] As used herein, "lower alkyl" refers to monovalent alkyl groups having<br>
from 1 to 5 carbon atoms including straight and branched chain alkyl groups.<br>
This term is exemplified by groups such as methyl, ethyl, iso-propyl, n-propyl,<br>
n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl, n-pentyl and the like.<br>
[0076] The term "lower alkylene" refers to divalent alkylene groups of from 1<br>
to 4 carbon atoms including straight and branched chain alkylene groups. This<br>
term is exemplified by groups such as methylene, ethylene, n-propylene, iso-<br>
propylene (-CH2CH(CH3)- and -CH(CH3)CH2-) and the like.<br>
[0077] The term "lower alkenyl" refers to an alkenyl group preferably having<br>
from 2 to 6 carbon atoms and having at least 1 site and preferably only 1 site<br>
of alkenyl unsaturation (i.e., &gt;C=C
such as allyl, ethenyl, propenyl, butenyl, and the like.<br>
[0078] The term "lower alkynyl" refers to an alkynyl group preferably having<br>
from 2 to 6 carbon atoms and having at least 1 site and preferably only 1 site<br>
of alkynyl unsaturation (i.e., -OC-). This term is exemplified by groups such<br>
as acetyl (-OCH), propargyl (-CH2-C=CH), 3-butynyl<br>
(-CH2CH2C=CH3) and the like.<br>
[0079] The term "lower cycloalkyl" refers to cyclic alkyl groups of from 3 to 6<br>
carbon atoms having a single cyclic ring including, by way of example,<br>
cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl.<br>
[0080] The term "lower alkylenecycloalkyl" refers to the group consisting of a<br>
lower alkylene-lower cycloalkyl, as defined herein. Such groups are<br>
exemplified by methylenecyclopropyl (-CH2-cyclopropyl),<br>
ethylenecyclopropyl and the like.<br>
[0081] "Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" means a carrier that is useful in<br>
preparing a pharmaceutical composition that is generally safe, non-toxic and<br>
neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable, and includes a carrier that is<br>
acceptable for veterinary use as well as human pharmaceutical use. "A<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" as used in the specification and claims<br>
includes both one and more than one such carrier.<br>
[0082] "Treating" or "treatment" of a disease includes:<br>
(1) preventing the disease, i.e., causing the clinical symptoms of the<br>
disease not to develop in a mammal that may be exposed to or predisposed to<br>
the disease but does not yet experience or display symptoms of the disease,<br>
(2) inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting or reducing the development of<br>
the disease or its clinical symptoms, or<br>
(3) relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease or its<br>
clinical symptoms.<br>
[0083] A "therapeutically effective amount" means the amount of a compound<br>
that, when administered to a mammal for treating a disease, is sufficient to<br>
effect such treatment for the disease. The "therapeutically effective amount"<br>
will vary depending on the compound, the disease and its severity and the age,<br>
weight, etc., of the mammal to be treated.<br>
[0084] "Pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts of a compound of Formula I which salts are derived from a<br>
variety of organic and inorganic counter ions well known in the art and<br>
include, by way of example only, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium,<br>
ammonium, tetraalkylammonium, and the like; and when the molecule<br>
contains a basic functionality, salts of organic or inorganic acids, such as<br>
hydrochloride, hydrobromide, tartrate, mesylate, acetate, maleate, oxalate and<br>
the like.<br>
[0085] Integrins are a large family of homologous transmembrane linker<br>
proteins that are the principal receptors on animal cells for binding most<br>
extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagen, fibronectin, and laminin. The<br>
integrins are heterodimers comprised of an a chain and a b chain. To date,<br>
twenty different integrin heterodimers, made from 9 different a subunits and<br>
14 different p subunits, have been identified. The term " a4 integrins" refers to<br>
the class of heterodimer, enzyme-linked cell-surface receptors that contain the<br>
a4subunit paired with any of the b subunits. VLA-4 is an example of an a4<br>
integrin, and is a heterodimer of the a4 and b1 subunits, and is also referred to<br>
as a4b1 integrin.<br>
Compound Preparation<br>
[0086] The compounds of this invention can be prepared from readily<br>
available starting materials using the methods and procedures set forth in the<br>
examples below. These methods and procedures outline specific reaction<br>
protocols for preparing N-[2-N",N"-diethylammo-5-ammosulfonylphenyl-<br>
yrimidin-4-yl]-p-carbomyloxy-phenylalanine compounds. Compounds within<br>
the scope not exemplified in these examples and methods are readily prepared<br>
by appropriate substitution of starting materials which are either commercially<br>
available or well known in the art.<br>
[0087] Other procedures and reaction conditions for preparing the compounds<br>
of this invention are described in the examples set forth below. Additionally,<br>
other procedures for preparing compounds useful in certain aspects of this<br>
invention are disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,492,372, issued December 10,2002;<br>
the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Pharmaceutical Formulations<br>
[0088] When employed as Pharmaceuticals, the compounds of this invention<br>
are usually administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. These<br>
compositions can be administered by a variety of routes including oral, rectal,<br>
transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, and intranasal. These<br>
compositions are effective by both injectable and oral delivery. Such<br>
compositions are prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art<br>
and comprise at least one active compound.<br>
[0089] This invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions which<br>
contain, as the active ingredient, one or more of the compounds of Formula I<br>
above associated with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. In making the<br>
compositions of this invention, the active ingredient is usually mixed with an<br>
excipient, diluted by an excipient or enclosed within such a carrier which can<br>
be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container. The excipient<br>
employed is typically an excipient suitable for administration to human<br>
subjects or other mammals. When the excipient serves as a diluent, it can be a<br>
solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium<br>
for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets,<br>
ÃŸ1lls, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions,<br>
solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments<br>
containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the active compound, soft<br>
and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile<br>
packaged powders.<br>
[0090] In preparing a formulation, it may be necessary to mill the active<br>
compound to provide the appropriate particle size prior to combining with the<br>
other ingredients. If the active compound is substantially insoluble, it<br>
ordinarily is milled to a particle size of less than 200 mesh. If the active<br>
compound is substantially water soluble, the particle size is normally adjusted<br>
by milling to provide a substantially uniform distribution in the formulation,<br>
e.g., about 40 mesh.<br>
[0091] Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose,<br>
sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates,<br>
tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, syrup, and methyl cellulose. The<br>
formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as talc,<br>
magnesium stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and<br>
suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and propylhydroxy-<br>
benzoates; sweetening agents; and flavoring agents. The compositions of the<br>
invention can be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed<br>
release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employing<br>
procedures known in the art.<br>
[0092] The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form, each<br>
dosage containing from about 5 to about 100 mg, more usually about 10 to<br>
about 30 mg, of the active ingredient. The term "unit dosage forms" refers to<br>
physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and<br>
other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active<br>
material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association<br>
with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient.<br>
[0093] The active compound is effective over a wide dosage range and is<br>
generally administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. It, will be<br>
understood, however, that the amount of the compound actually administered<br>
will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances,<br>
including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the<br>
actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual<br>
patient, the severity of the patient"s symptoms, and the like.<br>
[0094] For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active<br>
ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid<br>
preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a<br>
compound of the present invention. When referring to these preformulation<br>
compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is<br>
dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be<br>
readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets,<br>
pills and capsules. This solid preformulation is then subdivided into unit<br>
dosage forms of the type described above containing from, for example, 0.1 to<br>
about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention.<br>
[0095] The tablets or pills of the present invention may be coated or otherwise<br>
compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged<br>
action. For example, the tablet or ÃŸ1ll can comprise an inner dosage and an<br>
outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the<br>
former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which<br>
serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component<br>
to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of<br>
materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials<br>
including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with<br>
such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate.<br>
[0096] The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present<br>
invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include<br>
aqueous solutions suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and<br>
flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut<br>
oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.<br>
[0097] Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and<br>
suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or<br>
mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain<br>
suitable phannaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. Preferably<br>
the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for<br>
local or systemic effect. Compositions in preferably pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable solvents may be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized<br>
solutions may be breathed directly from the nebulizing device or the<br>
nebulizing device may be attached to a face masks tent, or intermittent positive<br>
pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions<br>
may be administered, preferably orally or nasally, from devices which deliver<br>
the formulation in an appropriate manner.<br>

and emulsifying wax are incorporated and stirred until dissolved. The active<br>
ingredient is added and stirring is continued until dispersed. The mixture is<br>
then cooled until solid.<br>
[00115] Another preferred formulation employed in the methods of the<br>
present invention employs transdermal delivery devices ("patches"). Such<br>
transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous<br>
infusion of the compounds of the present invention in controlled amounts.<br>
The construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of<br>
pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent<br>
5,023,252, issued June 11,1991, herein incorporated by reference. Such<br>
patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of<br>
pharmaceutical agents.<br>
[00116] Direct or indirect placement techniques may be used when it is<br>
desirable or necessary to introduce the pharmaceutical composition to the<br>
brain. Direct techniques usually involve placement of a drug delivery catheter<br>
into the host"s ventricular system to bypass the blood-brain barrier. One such<br>
implantable delivery system used for the transport of biological factors to<br>
specific anatomical regions of the body is described in U.S. Patent 5,011,472<br>
which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
[00117] Indirect techniques, which are generally preferred, usually involve<br>
formulating the compositions to provide for drug latentiation by the<br>
conversion of hydrophilic drugs into lipid-soluble drugs. Latentiation is<br>
generally achieved through blocking of the hydroxy, carbonyl, sulfate, and<br>
primary amine groups present on the drug to render the drug more lipid soluble<br>
and amenable to transportation across the blood-brain barrier. Alternatively,<br>
the delivery of hydrophilic drugs may be enhanced by intra-arterial infusion of<br>
hypertonic solutions which can transiently open the blood-brain barrier.<br>
Utility<br>
[00118] The compounds of this invention inhibit, in vivo, adhesion of<br>
leukocytes to endothelial cells mediated at least in part by a4 integrins,<br>
preferably VLA-4, by competitive binding to a4 integrins, preferably VLA-4.<br>
Accordingly, the compounds of this invention can be used in the treatment of<br>
mammalian diseases mediated at least in part by a4 integrins, preferably VLA-<br>
4, or leucocyte adhesion. Such diseases include inflammatory diseases in<br>
mammalian patients such as asthma, Alzheimer"s disease, atherosclerosis,<br>
AIDS dementia, diabetes (including acute juvenile onset diabetes),<br>
inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn"s disease),<br>
multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, tissue transplantation, tumor<br>
metastasis, meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, and other cerebral traumas,<br>
nephritis, retinitis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, myocardial ischemia and acute<br>
leukocyte-mediated lung injury such as that which occurs in adult respiratory<br>
distress syndrome.<br>
[00119] The amount administered to the mammalian patient will vary<br>
depending upon what is being administered, the purpose of the administration,<br>
such as prophylaxis or therapy, the state of the patient, the manner of<br>
administration, and the like. In therapeutic applications, compositions are<br>
administered to a patient already suffering from a disease in an amount<br>
sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease and its<br>
complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as<br>
"therapeutically effective dose." Amounts effective for this use will depend on<br>
the disease condition being treated as well as by the judgment of the attending<br>
clinician depending upon factors such as the severity of the inflammation, the<br>
age, weight and general condition of the patient, and the like.<br>
[00120] The compositions administered to a patient are in the form of<br>
pharmaceutical compositions described above. These compositions may be<br>
sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered.<br>
The resulting aqueous solutions may be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized,<br>
the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior<br>
to administration. The pH of the compound preparations typically will be<br>
between 3 and 11, more preferably from 5 to 9 and most preferably from 7 to<br>
8. It will be understood that use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers,<br>
or stabilizers will result in the formation of pharmaceutical salts.<br>
[00121] The therapeutic dosage of the compounds of the present invention<br>
will vary according to, for example, the particular use for which the treatment<br>
is made, the manner of administration of the compound, the health and<br>
condition of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. For<br>
example, for intravenous administration, the dose will typically be in the range<br>
of about 20 Âµg to about 500 Âµg per kilogram body weight, preferably about<br>
100 Âµg to about 300 Âµg per kilogram body weight. Suitable dosage ranges for<br>
intranasal administration are generally about 0.1 pg to 1 mg per kilogram body<br>
weight. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves<br>
derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.<br>
[00122] The following synthetic and biological examples are offered to<br>
illustrate this invention and are not to be construed in any way as limiting the<br>
scope of this invention. Unless otherwise stated, all temperatures are in<br>
degrees Celsius.<br>

nitropyrimidin-4-yl)-L-tyrosine tert-butyl ester (37.39 g, 0.087 mol) in CH2C12<br>
(150 mL) was added DMAP (10.59 g, 0.087 mol). After 5 minutes<br>
triethylamine (TEA) (18.19 mL, 0.131 mol) was added drop wise.<br>
1-Pyrrolidinecarbamoyl chloride (14.42 mL, 0.131 mol) was added dropwise,<br>
and the reaction was heated to reflux (40 C) overnight. The reaction mixture<br>
was concentrated in vacuo and taken up in EtOAc (300 mL). The organic<br>
phase was washed with 0.2 N citric acid (3 x 150 ml-), water (1x150 mL),<br>

[00151] The following methods may be used to test compounds of this<br>
invention.<br>
Example A<br>
a4b1 Integrin Adhesion Assay:<br>
Jurkatâ„¢ Cell Adhesion to Human Plasma Fibronectin<br>
Procedure;<br>
[00152] 96 well plates (Costar 3590 EIA plates) were coated with human<br>
fibronectin (Gibco/BRL, cat #33016-023) at a concentration of 10 Âµg/ml.<br>
overnight at 4Â°C. The plates were then blocked with a solution of bovine<br>
serum albumin (BSA; 0.3%) in saline. Jurkatâ„¢ cells (maintained in log phase<br>
growth) were labeled with Calcein AM according to the manufacturer"s<br>
instructions, and suspended at a concentration of 2 x 106 cells/mL in<br>
Hepes/Saline/BS A. The cells were then exposed to test and control<br>
compounds for 30 minutes at room temperature before transfer to individual<br>
wells of the fibronectin coated plate. Adhesion was allowed to occur for 35<br>
minutes at 37Â°C. The wells were then washed by gentle aspiration and<br>
ÃŸ1petting with fresh saline. Fluorescence associated with the remaining<br>
adherent cells was quantified using a fluorescence plate reader at EX 485/EM<br>
530.<br>
[00153] Cell cultures were prepared by first splitting the stationary phase<br>
Jurkatâ„¢ cells at 1:10 on day one, and 1:2 on day two to perform assay on day<br>
3. The cells split 1:10 on day one were split 1:4 on day 3 for a day 4 assay.<br>
[00154] The assay plates were prepared by first making a working solution of<br>
Gibco/BRL Human Fibronectin (cat # 33016-023) in PBS++, at 10 Âµg/mL<br>
A Costar 3590 EIA plate was then coated with 50 ÂµL/well for 2 hours at room<br>
temperature (thought it can also be left overnight at 4Â°C). Finally the plate<br>
was asperated and blocked with Hepes/Saline Buffer, 100 ÂµL/well, for 1 hour<br>
at RT followed by washing 3X with 150 ÂµL of PBS++.<br>
[00155] Compound dilutions were accomplished by preparing 1:3 serial<br>
dilutions of compounds as follows. For each plate (4 compounds/plate) 600<br>
ÂµL were added to 4 Bio-Rad Titertubes in a Titertube rack. Enough compound<br>
was added to each appropriate tube to give a 2X concentration using methods<br>
well known in the art. Using Falcon Flexiplates, 100 ÂµL of Hepes/Saline<br>
buffer or human serum were added to rows B through G. A multi-channel<br>
pipetter set to 180 ÂµL was used to with four tips spaced evenly the pipetter.<br>
Each set of four tubes was mixed 5 times and 180 ÂµL of 2X compound was<br>
transferred to the first column of each compound dilution in Row B, leaving<br>
Row A empty. 180 ÂµL were added to the other wells in Row A. Serial<br>
dilutions were performed down the plate by transferring 50 ÂµL to the next<br>
dilution and mixing 5 times, changing tips each time after mixing. Dilutions<br>
were stopped at Row F. Row G had no compound present.<br>
[00156] A 20 Âµg/mL solution in Hepes/Saline buffer or human serum, of 21/6<br>
antibody was the positive control and was set aside in a reagent trough to add<br>
to cell suspension plate.<br>
[00157] The cell staining was accomplished by first harvesting the log-phase<br>
Jurkatâ„¢ cells by centrifugation in 50 mL tubes (1100 rpm for 5 minutes). The<br>
cells were resuspended in 50 mL PBS++, spun, and resuspend in 20 mL<br>
PBS++. The cells were stained by adding 20 ÂµL of Calcein AM for 30<br>
minutes RT. The volume was brought to 50 mL with Hepes/Saline buffer and<br>
the cells were counted, spun, and resuspend to 2 x 106 cells/mL in<br>
Hepes/Saline buffer or human serum.<br>
[00158] The compounds were incubated using the following procedure. In a<br>
new flexiplate, 65 ÂµL of stained cells were added to Rows B through H. Then<br>
65 ÂµL of 2X compounds were added to the appropriate rows following the<br>
plate setup and mixed three times. 65 ÂµL of 2X-21/6 antibody were added to<br>
Row H and mixed 3X. Finally the plate was incubated at room temperature<br>
for 30 minutes.<br>
[00159] Fibronectin adhesion was measured using a fluorescent plate reader<br>
at EX 485/EM 530 after the following work up procedure. After incubation,<br>
the cells were mixed three times and 100 ÂµL were transfered to the Fibronectin<br>
coated plates and incubated at 37Â°C for about 35 minutes. Each plate was<br>
washed, row by row, by gently pipetting 100 ÂµL of RT. PBS++ down the<br>
sides of the wells and turning the plate 90 degrees to asÃŸ1rate. This procedure<br>
was repeated for a total of 3 washes. Each well was filled with 100 ÂµL after<br>
washing by pipetting down the side of the well.<br>
[00160] An IC50 value was calculated for each compound, both in the<br>
presence of the human serum and in the absence of human serum. IC50 is<br>
concentration at which the growth or activity is inhibited by 50%. The data<br>
is presented in the following tables.<br>
Example B<br>
In vitro Saturation Assay For Determining Binding of<br>
Candidate Compounds to a4ÃŸ1<br>
[00163] The following describes an in vitro assay to determine the plasma<br>
levels needed for a compound to be active in the Experimental Autoimmune<br>
Encephalomyelitis ("EAE") model, describe in the nert example, or in other<br>
in vivo models.<br>
[00164] Log-growth Jurkat cell are washed and resuspended in normal<br>
animal plasma containing 20 Âµg/mL of the 15/7 antibody (Yednock, et al., J.<br>
Biol Chem., (1995) 270(48)-28740).<br>
[00165] The Jurkat cells are diluted two-fold into either normal plasma<br>
samples containing known candidate compound amount in various<br>
concentrations ranging from 66 ÂµM to 0.01 ÂµM, using a standard 12 point<br>
serial dilution for a standard curve, or into plasma samples obtained from the<br>
peripheral blood of candidate compound-treated animals.<br>
[00166] Cells are then incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature, washed<br>
twice with phosphate-buffered saline ("PBS") containing 2% fetal bovine<br>
serum and 1mM each of calcium chloride and magnesium chloride (assay<br>
medium) to remove unbound 15/7 antibody<br>
[00167] The cells are then exposed to phycoerythrin-conjugated goat F(ab")2<br>
anti-mouse IgG Fc (Imrnunotech, Westbrook, ME), which has been adsorbed<br>
for any non-specific cross-reactivity by co-incubation with 5% serum from the<br>
animal species being studied, at 1:200 and incubated in the dark at 4Â°C for 30<br>
minutes.<br>
[00168] Cells are washed twice with assay medium and resuspended in the<br>
same. They are then analyzed with a standard fluorescence activated cell<br>
sorter ("FACS") analysis as described in Yednock et al. J. Biol. Chem., 1995,<br>
270.-28740.<br>
[00169] The data is then graphed as fluorescence versus dose, e.g., in a<br>
normal doss-response fashion. The dose levels that result in the upper plateau<br>
of the curve represent the levels needed to obtain efficacy in an in vivo model.<br>
Example C<br>
Cassette Dosing and Serum Analysis<br>
for determination of Bioavailability<br>
[00170] The oral bioavailability was screened by dosing rats with a cassette,<br>
i,e. mixture of 6 compounds per dosing solution. The cassette included 5 test<br>
articles and a standard compound, for a total dose of 10 mg/kg. Each<br>
compound/test article was converted to the sodium salt with equimolar 1N<br>
NaOH and dissolved in water at 2 mg/mL. The cassette was prepared by<br>
mixing equal volumes of each of the six solutions. The cassette dosing<br>
solution was mixed well and then the pH was adjusted to 7.5-9. The dosing<br>
solution was prepare the day before the study and stirred ovenight at room<br>
temperature.<br>
[00171] Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats from Charles River Laboratories, 6-8<br>
weeks old were used in this screen. Rats were quarantined for at least one day<br>
and had continuous access to food and water. On the night before die<br>
administration of the cassette, the rats were fasted for approximately 16 h.<br>
[00172] Four SD rats were assigned in each cassette. A single dose of the<br>
dosing solution was administered orally to each rat. The dosing volume (5<br>
ml/kg) and time were recorded and rats were fed 2 h after dosing.<br>
[00173] Blood samples were collected via cardiac puncture at the following<br>
time points: 4 h, 8 h and 22 h. Immediately prior to blood collection, rats were<br>
anesthetized with CO2 gas within 10-20 seconds. After the 12-h samples were<br>
collected, the rats were euthanized via CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical<br>
dislocation.<br>
[00174] Blood samples were kept in heparinized microtainer tubes under sub-<br>
ambient temperature (4Â°C) before they were processed. Blood samples were<br>
centrifuged (10000 rpm for 5 minutes) and plasma samples were removed and<br>
stored in a -20Â°C freezer until analyzed for drug levels. Drug levels in the<br>
plasma were analyzed using the following protocol, for direct plasma<br>
preciÃŸ1tation.<br>
[00175] The in vivo plasma samples were prepared in a 1.5 mL 96-well plate,<br>
by adding, in order, 100 ÂµL of the test plasma, 150 ÂµL of methanol, followed<br>
by vortexing for 10-20 seconds. 150 ÂµL of 0.05 ng/ÂµL of an Internal Standard<br>
in acetonitrile were added and vortexed for 30 seconds.<br>
[00176] The standard curve samples were prepared in a 1.5 mL 96-well plate,<br>
by adding, in order, 100 ÂµL of control mouse plasma, followed by 150 ÂµL of<br>
methanol and vortexing for 10-20 seconds. 150 ÂµL of 0.05 ng/ÂµL of an<br>
Internal Standard in acetonitrile were added and vortexed for 30 seconds. The<br>
samples were spiked with 0-200 ng (10 concentrations) of the compound of<br>
interest in 50% methanol to obtain a standard curve range of 0.5 ng/mL -<br>
2,000 ng/mL. Again, the sample was vortexed for 30 seconds.<br>
[00177] The samples were then spun for 20-30 minutes at 3000 rpm in an<br>
Eppendorf microfuge before 80-90% of supernatant was transferred into a<br>
clean 96-well plate. The organic solvent was then evaporated until the<br>
samples were dry (under N2 at 40Â°C/ 30-60 min (ZymarkTurbovap)).<br>
[00178] The residue was then dissolved in 200 - 600 L mobile phase (50%<br>
CH3OH/0.1%TFA). LC/MS/MS was then run using a PE-Sciex API-3000<br>
triple quadurpole mass spectrometer (SN0749707), Perkin-Elmer,<br>
Series200auto-sampler, and shimadzu 10A pump. Acquisition was done with<br>
PE-Sciex Analyst (v1.1) and data analysis and quantification were<br>
accomplished using PE-Sciex Analyst (v1.1). A 5-50 ÂµL sample volume was<br>
injected onto a reverse phase ThermoHypersil DASH-18 column (Keystone<br>
2.0 x 20 mm, 5 Âµm, PN: 8823025-701) using a mobile phase of 25% CH3OH,<br>
0.1% TFA-100% CH3OH, 0.1% TFA. The run time was about 8 minutes at a<br>
flow rate of about 300 ÂµL/minutes.<br>
[00179] The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was calculated using the linear<br>
trapezoidal rule from t=0 to the last sampling time tx (see Handbook of Basic<br>
Pharmacokinetics, Wolfgang A. Ritschel and Gregory L. Kearns, 5th ed, 1999).<br>
AUC0-tx = S((Cn + Cn+1)/2)) â€¢ (tn+1 - tn) [(Âµg/mL)h]<br>
[00130] In the case of the cassette dosing paradigm, samples at 4, 8 and 12 h<br>
post extravascular dosing, the AUC was calculated from t = 0 to t = 12 h. The<br>
AUC0?12h values were calculated for each individual animal and the average<br>
AUC0?12h are reportedin the table below.<br>

Asthma Models<br>
[00182] Inflammatory conditions mediated by a4b1 integrin include, for<br>
example, eosinophil influx, airway hyper-responsiveness and occlusion that<br>
occurs with chronic asthma. The following describes animal models of asthma<br>
that were used to study the in vivo effects of the compounds of this invention<br>
for use in treating asthma.<br>
Rat Asthma Model<br>
[00183] This model follows the procedures described by Chapman et al, Am<br>
J. Resp. Crit. Care Med,. 153 4, A219 (1996) and Chapman et al, Am. J. Resp.<br>
Crit Care Med 155:4, A881 (1997), both of which are incorporated by<br>
reference in their entirety. Ovalbumin (OA; 10mg/mL) were mixed with<br>
aluminum hydroxide (10 mg/mL) and injected (i.p.) in Brown Norway rats on<br>
day 0. Injections of OA, together with adjuvant, were repeated on days 7 and<br>
14. On day 21, sensitized animals were restrained in plastic tubes and exposed<br>
(60 minutes) to an aerosol of OA (10 mg/kg) in a nose-only exposure system.<br>
Animals will be sacraficed 72 hours later with pentobarbital (250 mg/kg, i.p.).<br>
The lungs were lavaged via a tracheal cannula using 3 aliquots (4 mL) of<br>
Hank"s solution (HBSS x 10,100 mL; EDTA 100 mM, 100 mL; HEPES 1 M,<br>
25 mL; made up to 1 L with H2O); recovered cells were pooled and the total<br>
volume of recovered fluid adjusted to 12 mL by addition of Hank"s solution.<br>
Total cells were counted (Sysmex microcell counter F-500, TOA Medical<br>
Electronics Otd., Japan) and smears were made by diluting recovered fluid (to<br>
approximately 106 cells/mL) and pipetting an aliquot (100 ÂµL) into a<br>
centrifuge (Cytospin, Shandon, U.K.). Smears were air dried, fixed using a<br>
solution of fast green in methanol (2 mg/mL) for 5 seconds and stained with<br>
eosin G (5 seconds) and thiazine (5 seconds) (Diff-Quick, Browne Ltd. U.K.)<br>
in order to differentiate eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and<br>
lymphocytes. A total of 500 cells per smear were counted by light microscopy<br>
under oil immersion (x 100). Compounds of this invention were formulated<br>
into a 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose and 2% Tween80 suspension and<br>
administered orally to rats which had been sensitized to the allergen,<br>
ovalbumin. Compounds which inhibited allergen-induced leucocyte<br>
accumulation in the airways of actively sensitized Brown Norway rats were<br>
considered to be active in this model.<br>
Mouse Asthma Model<br>
[00184] Compounds were also evaluated in a mouse model of acute<br>
pulmonary inflammation following the procedures described by, Kung et al.,<br>
Am J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 13:360-365, (1995) and Schneider et al., (1999).<br>
Am J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 20:448-457, (1999), which are each<br>
incorporated by reference in their entirety. Female Black/6 mice (8-12 weeks<br>
of age) were sensitized on day 1 by an intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of 0.2 mL<br>
ova/alum mixture containing 20 Âµg of ova (Grade 4, Sigma) and 2 mg inject<br>
Alum (Pierce). A booster injection was administered on day 14. Mice are<br>
challenged on days 28 and 29 with aerosolized 1% ova (in 0.9% saline) for 20<br>
minutes. Mice are euthanized and bronchaveolar lavage samples (3 mL) are<br>
collected on day 30,48 hours post first challenge. Eosinophils were quantified<br>
by a FACs/FITC staining method. Compounds of this invention were<br>
formulated into a 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose and 2% Tween80 suspension<br>
and administered orally to mice which had been sensitized to the allergen,<br>
ovalbumin. Compounds which inhibited allergen-induced leucocyte<br>
accumulation in the airways of actively sensitized C57BL/6 mice were<br>
considered to be active in this model.<br>
Sheep Asthma Model<br>
[00185] This model follows the procedures described by Abraham et al,<br>
J.Clin, Invest, 93:776-787 (1994) and Abraham et al, Am J. Respir Crit Care<br>
Med 156:696-703 (1997), both of which are incorporated by reference in their<br>
entirety. Compounds of this invention have been evaluated by intravenous<br>
(saline aqueous solution), oral (2 % Tween80, 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose),<br>
and aerosol administration to sheep which are hypersensitive to Ascaris suum<br>
antigen. Compounds which decrease the early antigen-induced bronchial<br>
response and/or block the late-phase airway response, e.g. have a protective<br>
effect against antigen-induced late responses and airway hyper-responsiveness<br>
("AHR"), are considered to be active in this model.<br>
[00186] Allergic sheep which are shown to develop both early and late<br>
bronchial responses to inhaled Ascaris suum antigen were used to study the<br>
airway effects of the candidate compounds. Following topical anesthesia of<br>
the nasal passages with 2% lidocaine, a balloon catheter was advanced through<br>
one nostril into the lower esophagus. The animals were then incubated with a<br>
cuffed endotracheal tube through the other nostril with a flexible fiberoptic<br>
bronchoscope as a guide.<br>
[00187] Pleural pressure was estimated according to Abraham (1994).<br>
Aerosols (see formulation below) were generated using a disposable medical<br>
nebulizer that provided an aerosol with a mass median aerodynamic diameter<br>
of 3.2 Âµm as determined with an Andersen cascade impactor. The nebulizer<br>
was connected to a dosimeter system consisting of a solenoid valve and a<br>
source of compressed air (20 psi). The output of the nebulizer was directed<br>
into a plastic T-piece, one end of which was connected to the inspiratory port<br>
of a piston respirator. The solenoid valve was activated for 1 second at the<br>
beginning of the inspiratory cycle of the respirator. Aerosols were delivered at<br>
VT of 500 mL and a rate of 20 breaths/minute. A 0.5% sodium bicarbonate<br>
solution only was used as a control.<br>
[00188] To assess bronchial responsiveness, cumulative concentration-<br>
response curves to carbachol was generated according to Abraham (1994).<br>
Bronchial biopsies were taken prior to and following the initiation of treatment<br>
and 24 hours after antigen challenge. Bronchial biopsies were preformed<br>
according to Abraham (1994).<br>
[00189] An in vitro adhesion study of alveolar macrophages were also<br>
performed according to Abraham (1994), and a percentage of adherent cells<br>
calculated.<br>
Aerosol Formulation<br>
[00190] A solution of the candidate compound in 0.5% sodium<br>
bicarbonate/saline (w/v) at a concentration of 30.0 mg/mL is prepared using<br>
the following procedure:<br>
Procedure:<br>
1. Add 0.5g sodium bicarbonate into a 100 mL volumetric flask.<br>
2. Add approximately 90.0 mL saline and sonicate until dissolved.<br>
3. Q.S. to 100.0 mL with saline and mix thoroughly.<br>
Procedure:<br>
1. Add 0.300 g of the candidate compound into a 10.0 mL<br>
volumetric flask.<br>
2. Add approximately 9.7 mL of 0.5% sodium bicarbonate / saline<br>
stock solution.<br>
3. Sonicate until the candidate compound is completely dissolved.<br>
4. Q.S. to 10.0 mL with 0.5% sodium bicarbonate / saline stock<br>
solution and mix thoroughly.<br>
Example E<br>
10-Day Toxicity Study on C57B6 Mice<br>
[00193] A 10-day study was conducted to evaluate the toxicity of compounds<br>
of the present invention to female C57B6 mice. The compound was<br>
administered by gavage at five dose levels, 0 (vehicle control), 10, 30, 100,<br>
300 and 1000 mg/kg (mpk), with five mice in each dose level. The dose<br>
volume for all levels was 10 mL/kg. Dose solutions or suspensions were<br>
prepared in 2% Tween 80 in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and new<br>
dose solutions or suspensions were prepared every two - three days. In-life<br>
observations included body weights (study day 1, 2,3,5, 7,8 and 11), daily<br>
cageside clinical observations (1-2/day) and periodic (study day -1,2 and 9)<br>
functional observation battery.<br>
[00194] At termination, blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture for<br>
clinical pathology (hematology and clinical chemistry) and drug levels. The<br>
EDTA blood samples were analyzed for total white blood cell count, red blood<br>
cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocyte indices (MCV, MCH,<br>
MCHC), platelets and a WBC five part differential (neutrophil, lymphocytes,<br>
monocytes, eosinophils and basophils). Heparinized plasma samples were<br>
analyzed for alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline<br>
phosphatase, total bilirubin, albumin, protein, calcium, glucose, urea nitrogen,<br>
creatinine, cholesterol and triglycerides.<br>
[00195] After blood collection, the carcass was necropsied and organs (liver,<br>
spleen, kidneys, heart and thymus) were weighed. Tissue samples; brain,<br>
salivary glands, thymus, heart, lung, liver, kidney, adrenal spleen, stomach,<br>
duodenum, ileum, colon and uterus/ovary, were collected and formalin fixed.<br>
Tissues from the vehicle control and 300 and 1000 mpk group animals were<br>
processed to H &amp; E stained glass slides and evaluated for histopathological<br>
lesions.<br>
[00196] Body weight changes, absolute and relative organ weights and<br>
clinical pathology results were analyzed for statistical significant differences<br>
compared to the vehicle controls by Dunnet"s multiple comparison test using<br>
Prism software. The functional observation battery results were analyzed for<br>
differences using the Dunnet"s, Fisher"s exact tests and dose trend effects by<br>
the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel correlation test using SAS software.<br>
[00197] Using a conventional oral formulation, compounds of this invention<br>
would be active in this model.<br>
Example F<br>
Adjuvant-Induced Arthritis in Rats<br>
[00198] Adjuvant induced arthritis ("ALA") is an animal model useful in the<br>
study of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which is induced by injecting M.<br>
tuberculosis in the base of the tail of Lewis rats. Between 10 and 15 days<br>
following injection, animals develop a severe, progressive arthritis.<br>
[00199] Generally, compounds are tested for their ability to alter hind paw<br>
swelling and bone damage resulting from adjuvant-induced edema in rats. To<br>
quantitate the inhibition of hind paw swelling resulting from AIA, two phases<br>
of inflammation have been defined: (1) the primary and secondary injected<br>
hind paw, and (2) the secondary uninjected hind paw, which generally begins<br>
developing about eleven days from the induction of inflammation in the<br>
injected paw. Reduction of the latter type of inflammation is an indication of<br>
immunosuppressive activity. Cf. Chang, Arth. Rheum., 20,1135-1141 (1977).<br>
[00200] Using an animal model of RA, such as AIA, enables one to study the<br>
cellular events involved in the early stages of the disease. CD44 expression on<br>
macrophages and lymphocytes is up-regulated during the early development of<br>
adjuvant arthritis, whereas LFA-1 expression is up-regulated later in the<br>
development of the disease. Understanding the interactions between adhesion<br>
molecules and endothelium at the earliest stages of adjuvant arthritis could<br>
lead to significant advances in the methods used in the treatment ot RA.<br>
