Amino acids in position 2 and/or 5 may have the D or L configuration. Preferably each of them has the L configuration.<br>
The compounds of formula I may exist e.g. in free or salt form. Salts include acid addition salts with e.g. organic acids, polymeric acids or inorganic acids, for example with hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, aspartic acid, benzoic acid, succinic acid or pamoic acid, or e.g. alkali metal salts when R1 comprises a COOH group. Acid addition salts may exist as mon- or divalent salts, e.g. depending whether 1 or 2 acid equivalents are added to the Compound of formula I in free base form. Preferred salts are the aspartate di-salt or the pamoate monosalt.<br>
The process of production according to the invention comprises a cyclisation step of a corresponding linear peptide in protected form. It has now surprisingly been found that the cyclisation step is particularly dependent on the selection of the 2 terminal amino acids of the corresponding linear peptide. Out of 6 cyclisation possibilities, it has surprisingly been found that the cyclisation between amino acids 3 and 4, or 4 and 5, or 6 and 1 provides significantly interesting results. The cyclisation between amino acids 4 and 5 is particularly preferred. The cyclisation according to the invention between the amino acids 3 and 4, or 4 and 5, or 6 and 1 lead to improved yields with reduced isomerisation at the chiral sites. Furthermore, these cyclisation steps can be performed with less stringent conditions and reactants: e.g. cyclisation through the use of an azide can be avoided.<br>
In a first embodiment of the invention, there is provided a process for preparing a compound<br>
of formula I or a salt thereof as indicated above,<br>
comprising cyclizing a linear somatostatin analogue of formula II<br><br><br>
H-{4-(RrNHCO-0)-Pro}-(D or DPhg-DTrpfR^ )-Lys(4-NHR12)-NH-CH-CO-Phe-OH      IV<br>
CH2-R2<br>
wherein R1 and R2 are as defined,<br>
each of R1 and R12, independently, is an amino protecting group<br>
whereby when R1 comprises a terminal NH2, this terminal NH2 is also protected by an amino<br>
protecting group,<br>
and where required removing the protecting group(s),<br>
and recovering a compound of formula I thus obtained in free form or in salt form.<br>
Suitable amino protecting groups are e.g. as described, for example, in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", T. W. Greene et al., John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., Second Edition 1991. Examples of such amino protecting groups are e.g. acetyl or amino groups as used in peptide synthesis, e.g. tert.-butoxy-carbonyi, carbobenzoxy, fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl, atloxycarbonyl, 1-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocycIohexylidene)ethyl, 1-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohexylidene)-3-methylbutyl, 4-methyitrityl. (W.C. Chan and P.D. White, Fmoc solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, Oxford University Press, 2000).<br>
Cyclisation may conveniently be performed in the presence of an aminium- or phos-phonium-based derivative for in situ carboxy activation e.g. O-(benzotriazol-1-yl)N,INI,N\N'-tetramethyluronium-hexafluorophosphate, benzotriazoM-yloxytris(pyrrolidino) phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, N-[(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)(dimethylamino)methylene]-N-methyl methanaminium tetrafluoroborate N-oxide, N-KdimethylaminoJ-IH-1,2,3--triazolo-[4-5]-pyri-dine-1-ylmethylene]-N-methylmethanaminiumf 7-azabenzotriazol-1yloxytris(pyrrolidino)-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate. Preferably the reaction may be carried out in the presence of a base, e.g. an organic amine, e.g. N-ethyl diisopropyl amine, N-methylmorpholine, triethyiamine, or tribenzyl amine, and in the presence of an auxiliary nucleophile, e.g. 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, N-hydroxysuccinimide, 3-hydroxy-3,4-dihydro-1,2,3-benzotriazine-4-one or 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazoie.<br>
The cyclisation of a compound of formula II, III or IV leads to a compound of formula I in protected form, i.e. a compound of formula I wherein one or more or ail amino groups present in the molecule are protected by an amino protecting group. Examples of such compounds are e.g. cyclo[(2St4R)-4-(Boc-NH-CH2-CHrNH-CO-O)-Pro-Phg-D-Trp(Boc)-Lys(Boc)-Tyr(Bzl)-Phe-], cyclo[(2S,4R)-4-(Boc-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-CO-O)-Pro-Phg-D-Trp-Lys(Boc)-Tyr(Bzl)-Phe-]andcyclo[(2S,4R)-4-(Boc-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-CO-O)-Pro-DPhg-D-Trp-Lys(Boc)-Tyr(Bzl)-Phe-],<br><br>
The amino protecting groups may be removed according to methods known in the art, e.g. by cleavage, e.g. with trifluordacetic acid; 3M HCI, EtOAc; Me3CCI, phenol, CH2CI2; 10% H2SO4, dioxane; bromocatecholborane.<br>
Compounds of formulae II, III and IV or salts thereof are novel and form part of the invention. These compounds may be prepared by linking together by an amide bond two peptide units, each of them containing at least one amino acid in protected or unprotected form, wherein the amide bond is in such a way that the desired amino acid sequence as defined in formulae II, III or IV is obtained.<br>
The synthesis may be performed in accordance to methods known in the art, e.g. in solution or by solid phase synthesis, starting with the first amino acid. In the solid phase synthesis, the first amino acid is attached to a resin, e.g. a commercially available polystyrene-based resin, optionally through a suitable linker, e.g. a linker which is cleavable under mild conditions to keep the side chain protection intact, e.g. an optionally substituted trityl based linker, for example 4-(hydroxyl-diphenyl-methyl)-benzoic acid wherein one of the phenyl groups may optionally be substituted, e.g. by CI. The building-up of the desired peptide chain, whether in solution or by solid phase synthesis, may be effected in conventional manner, e.g. using amino acids wherein the terminal amino groups are Fmoc-protected, the side chain amino groups where present being protected with a different amino protecting group, e.g. Boc or CBO.<br>
When the synthesis is effected by solid phase synthesis, the built-up peptide is then removed from the resin in accordance with methods known in the art, e.g. with acetic acid; trifluoracetic acid; acetic acid-trifluoroethanol-dichloromethane; hexafluoroisopropanol in dichloromethane. A preferred process for removing the built-up peptide from the solid phase, e.g. when using a non-chlorinated trityl based linker, is e.g. the treatment with methanol/dichloromethane, preferably at room temperature, or a treatment with a ketone, e.g. ethyl methyl ketone, preferably at a temperature of about 50°C.<br>
Examples of compounds of formulae II, III and IV are e.g.<br>
H-Lys(Boc)-D-Tyr(Bzl)-Phe-(2S(4R)-4-(Boc-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-CO-0)-Pro-Phg-D-Trp(Boc)-<br>
OH<br>
H-Lys(Boc)-D-Tyr(Bzl)-Phe-(2SI4R)-4-(Boc-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-CO-O)-Pro-Phg-D-Trp^OH<br>
H-(2S,4R)-4-(Boc-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-CO-O)-Pro-Phg-D-Trp(Boc)-Lys(Boc)-Tyr(Bzl)-Phe-OH<br>
H-Tyr(Bzl)-Phe-(2S,4RM-(Boc-NH-CH2-CHrNH-CO-0)-Pro-DPhg-DTrp(Boc)-Lys(Boc)-OH<br>
H-Tyr(Bzl)-Phe-(2S,4R).4-(Boc-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-CO-0)-Pro-Phg-DTrp-Lys(Boc)-OH<br><br>
H-Tyr(Bzl)-Phe-(2S?4R)-4-(Boc-NH-CH2-CH2-NH«CO-O)-Pro-Phg-D-Trp(Boc)Lys(Boc)-OH.<br>
Compounds of formula II, III or IV may exist in a salt form as disclosed above for the compounds of formula I.<br>
The compounds of formula I are valuable somatostatin agonists, and have interesting pharmacological properties as disclosed e.g. in WO 97/01579 or WO 02/10192, the contents thereof disclosing the pharmacological properties being incorporated herein by reference. A preferred compound is cyclo [{(4'NH2-C2H4-NH-CO-0)-Pro}-Phg-DTrp-Lys-Tyr(4-Benzyl)-Phe], or a salt thereof. Preferred salts are the aspartate (mono- or di-aspartate) or pamoate.<br>
When using the process of the invention, a cyclisation yield of the corresponding linear peptide of formula II, III or IV higher than 70% may be obtained.<br>

Example 2:<br>
Preparation of 4-(Chloro(diphenyI)methyl)benzoyJ aminomethyl polystyrene resin<br><br>
The synthesis is carried out in a manually operated 1 L stirred batch reactor equipped with sintered glass frit under nitrogen. Commercial available aminomethylpolystyrene resin (30.4 g, 41.07 mmol), pretreated with DMF, reacted at RT overnight with a solution of 4-(hydroxyl-diphenyl-methyl)benzoic acid (15.0 g, 49.28 mmol, 1.2 equiv.), hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) (7.54 g, 49.28 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) and DICI (12.43 g, 98.57 mmoi, 2.4 equiv.) in DMF (140 mi). Solvent is removed by filtration through the frit under reduced pressure, and the resin is washed by turns five times with DMF and five times with methanol. Drying in vacuum at 40° yields 44.69 g resin. This resin is used as starting material for the following synthesis of the hexapetides.<br>
Procedure for the synthesis of the protected linear peptide<br>
The resin-linked linear hexapeptides are assembled manually in the Oto N direction by iterative coupling reactions in a stirred batch reactor equipped with sintered glass frit under nitrogen. 4-(Chloro(diphenyl)methyl)benzoyl aminomethyl polystyrene resin is used as starting material and carried through a standard protocol consisting of repetitive cycles of Na--deprotection (20% v/v diethylamine (DAEM) in DMF), repeated washings with DMF and IPK in turns, and couplings (DIPCi/HOBT, DIEPA und DMF) at RT. In slight modification of this coupling procedure, special care is taken to minimize racemisation of phenylgiycine by carrying out coupling of this amino acid at 0°. Before cleavage of the completely assembled protected linear peptide from its resin support, Na-Fmoc protection is removed.<br>
Fmoc-(2S,4R)-4-(Boc-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-CO-O)-Pro-OH is synthesized as disclosed in WO02/101192. All other amino acids are commercial available.<br>
Synthesis of H-TyrfBzO-Phe-(2S,4R-4-(Boc-NH-CH2-CH-NH-CO-O)-Pro-Phg-D-Trp(Boc)Lys(Boc)-OH<br><br><br>
a) Synthesis of Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-0-resin<br>
4-{Chioro(diphenyl)methyl)benzoyl aminomethyl polystyrene resin (20 g, 19.4 mmol),<br>
pretreated with toluene, is treated for 4 hours with acetyl chloride (7.6 g, 97 mmol) in toluene<br>
at RT. After filtration, the procedure is repeated overnight, thereafter, the resin is filtered and<br>
washed with toluene and dichloromethane. Coupling is carried out with a mixture of Fmoc-<br>
Lys(Boc)-OH (18.2 g, 38.8 mmol; 2 equiv.) and N-methylmorpholine (3.94g, 38.8 mmol, 2<br>
equiv.) for 4 hours at RT. After filtration, the resin is washed with DMF and IPA 3 times in<br>
turns and dried in vacuum to get 26.5 g of a yellowish Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-O-resin with a<br>
capacity of 0.566 mmol/g (determined with the Fmoc-method).<br>
(Lit. Fmoc-method: Meienhofer, J.; Waki, M; Heimer, E.P.; Lambros, T.J.; Makofske, R.C.;<br>
Chang, C. D. Int. J. Pep. Prot. Res. 1979, 13, 35)<br>
b)Resin-0-Lys(Boc)-D-Trp(Boc)-Phg-(2SARH-(Boc-NH^<br>
Tyr(Bzl)-H<br>
Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-Oresin (28.0 g, 19.96 mmol) is suspended in DMF and treated with a<br>
solution of DAEM in DMF (20% v/v) for 10 minutes at RT. After being filtered, the procedure<br>
is repeated and then washed with DMF and IPA 3 times in turns, followed by 3 times<br>
washings with DMF. This procedure of No- Fmoc- deprotection and washings is repeated<br>
after each coupling step.<br>
Coupling is carried out with a mixture of amino acid, HOBT and DICI which is stirred 30<br>
minutes at RT, and then added to the resin at once. Coupling is continued until completion,<br>
i.e. until complete disappearance of residual amino groups is monitored by negative "Kaiser"<br>
Ninhydrin test. After being coupled, the resin is washed 5 times with DMF, and is then ready<br>
for Fmoc-protection.<br>
The following amino acid-derivatives are sequentially coupled:<br>
Fmoc-D-Trp(Boc)-OH (16.81 g, 31.92 mmol, 2 equiv.), DIF (100 ml), HOBT (4.93 g, 32.24<br>
mmol, 2.02 equiv.), DICI (5.35 g, 42.45 mmol, 2.66 equiv.).<br><br>
Fmoc-Phg-OH (11.92 g, 31.92 mmol, 2 equiv.), THF (70 ml), HOBT (4.93 g, 32.24 mmol, 2.02 equiv.), DICi (5.35 g, 42.45 mmol, 2.66 equiv.). Special care is taken to minimize racemisation of phenylglycine by carrying out coupling of this amino acid at 0 °C. Fmoc-(2S,4R) 4-(Boc-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-CO-0)-Pro-OH (17.26 g, 31.92 mmol, 2 equiv.), DIF (100 ml), HOBT (4.93 g, 32.24 mrnoi, 2.02 equiv.), DICI (5.35 g, 42.45 mmol, 2.66 equiv.). Fmoc-Phe-OH (12.36 g, 31.92 mmol, 2 equiv.), DIF (100 ml), HOBT (4.93 g, 32.24 mmol, 2.02 equiv.), DICI (5.35 g, 42.45 mmol, 2.66 equiv.).<br>
Fmoc-Tyr(Bzl)-OH (15.75 g, 31.92 mmol, 2 equiv.), DIF (100 ml), HOBT (4.93 g, 32.24 mmol, 2.02 equiv.), DICI (5.35 g, 42.45 mmol, 2.66 equiv.).<br>
Before cleavage of the completely assembled protected linear peptide from its resin support,<br>
Na-Fmoc protection is removed by treating the resin with a solution of DAEM in DMF (20%<br>

The resin (4-(Chloro(diphenyl)methyl)benzoyl aminomethyl polystyrene resin) is washed 3 times with methanol and dried and could be reused. Purification<br>
For analytical purposes the linear peptides were purified by RP chromatography. Characterization<br>
The structure of a analytical sample purified by RP-chromatography is confirmed by FAB-MS, LC-MS and NMR-data (DMSO in ppm, 1.16,1.34,1.55,1.61 (3H), 1.66, 2.05, 2.20, 2.51, 2.83 (2H),2.91, 2.96, 2.98, 3.02, 3.41, 3.78, 4.13, 4.61, 5.13, 5.51, 6.74, 6.83, 6.88 (2H), 7.01 (2H), 7.11 (2H),7.38, 7.42 (2H), 7.49, 7.72, 8.01, 8.29, 8.48, 8.62, 8.75.) The amino acid configuration is determined by amino acid analysis: the compound is hydrolyzed under acidic conditions, converted to derivatives and the configuration of the each individual amino acid is assigned by enantioselective gas chromatography/chemical ionization mass spectrometry.<br>
Additional proof of structure is the conversion of the different linear peptides to well characterized cyclic peptide.<br>
The following compounds were synthesized according to the described procedure.<br>
H-Lys(Boc)-Tyr(Bzl)-Phe-(2S,4R)-4-(Boc-NH-CH2-CH2-NH-CO-0)-Pro-Phg-D-Trp(Boc)-OH;<br>
