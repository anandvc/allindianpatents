COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"APPARATUS  FOR A  QUICK  RELEASE  MECHANISM  IN  A  RAILCAR HAND BRAKE"<br>
WESTINGHOUSE AIR BRAKE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION, of 1001 Air Brake Avenue, Wilmerding, Pennsylvania 15148, United States of America<br>
15-4-2005<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION The invention taught in the present application is closely-related to the invention taught in co-pending patent application titled "Quick Release Mechanism For A Railcar Hand Brake", filed<br>
concurrently herewith and   having serial number '	.  This<br>
application is assigned to the assignee of the present application. The teachings of this co-pending patent application are incorporated herein by reference thereto.<br>
FIELD OF' THE INVENTION The present invention relates, in general, to a railcar hand brake, and more particularly, to an apparatus for a quick release mechanism in a railcar vertical wheel hand brake. The present invention will maintain a hand brake in the released position until an application is made.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
t<br>
Prior to the present invention, a. railcar vertical hand brake includes a brake release mechanism that provides quick release,, of the brakes by disengaging the winding gear _. to permit free rotation of the main gear wheel. A force is exerted on the release lever to move the attached brake release shaft, whereby-releasing the main gear wheel and the tension on the brake chain, which in turn releases the brake.  When the force on the<br><br>
release lever is removed,  the main gear wheel re-engages.<br>
However, the brake may not be fully released. When a railcar<br>
negotiates a curve in the track, the truck rotates and can exert<br>
a force on the brake chain.   The chain resists  the truck<br>
movement and tends to pull on the hand brake lever.  This action<br>
can apply the brakes to the truck while the train is in motion. Friction and wear between the brake shoes and the wheels, and the wheels and the rail may occur as a result.<br>
An example of this type hand brake is taught in U.S. Patent No. 3,668,944, and the Universal 7400 Model Hand Brake. The teachings of these references are incorporated herein by reference thereto.<br>

The housing has a front casing with an inside wall of a predetermined size and shape, a back plate, and an operating shaft rotatably mounted in the housing, including a first end, a second end, and a ratchet wheel rotatable with the operating shaft intermediate of the first and second ends. A release shaft is rotatably mounted in the housing. The quick release mechanism comprises a projection of a predetermined size and 'shape disposed substantially perpendicular to the ratchet wheel, and a flexible clamp of a predetermined size and shape<br><br>
																														3<br><br>
mounted inside the housing. A member is disposed substantially perpendicular to and about the circumference of the release shaft. A first element is disposed on such member wherein the first element interposes with the flexible clamp when the quick release shaft is rotated to achieve and maintain full brake release, and a second element is disposed on such member and engageable with the projection disposed on the ratchet wheel when the operating shaft is rotated to disengage the first element from the flexible clamp to allow for brake application.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides for a combination with a railcar hand brake having a brake chain, brake drum, gear mechanism, ratchet device further including a ratchet wheel, clutch device, quick release mechanism, and a housing adapted for mounting on a railcar. The improvement comprises a projection of a predetermined size and shape disposed substantially perpendicular to the ratchet wheel, and a flexible clamp of a predetermined size and shape mounted inside the housing. A member is disposed perpendicular to and about the circumference of the release shaft, with a first element disposed on said member wherein the first element interposes with the flexible clamp when the. release shaft is rotated to achieve and maintain full brake release, and a second element disposed on said member and engageable with the projection when<br>
4	"	.<br><br>
