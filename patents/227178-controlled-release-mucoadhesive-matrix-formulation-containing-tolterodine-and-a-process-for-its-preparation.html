INTRODUCTION<br>
The present invention relates to a controlled release mucoadhesive matrix formulation containing a therapeutically effective amount of tolterodine or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrugs and metabolites thereof The present invention particularly relates to a controlled release mucoadhesive matrix formulation containing tolterodine tartrate in a tablet dosage form. The formulation of the present invention is useful for the treatment of urge incontinence and other symptoms of unstable or overactive urinary bladder.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of controlled release mucoadhesive matrix formulation containing a therapeutically effective amount of tolterodine or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrugs and metabolites thereof<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION:<br>
A substantial part (5-10%) of the adult population suffers from overactive or unstable urinary bladder, often also referred to as urinary incontinence. The symptoms of an unstable or overactive bladder comprise urge incontinence, urgency and urinary frequency. The prevalence of overactive bladder, particularly of so-called urge incontinence, increases with age. It is assumed that unstable or overactive bladder is caused by uncontrolled contractions of the bundles of smooth muscle fibers forming the muscular coat of the urinary bladder (the detrusor muscle) during the filling phase of the bladder. These contractions are mainly controlled by cholinergic muscarinic receptors, and the pharmacological treatment of unstable or overactive bladder has been based on muscarinic receptor antagonists. The drug of choice has for a long time been oxybutynin. Recently, however, an improved muscarinic receptor antagonist, tolterodine, (R)-N, N-diisopropyl-3- (2-hydroxy-5-me1hylphmyl)-3-phenylpropanamine, has been marketed for the treatment of urge incontience and other symptoms of unstable or overactive urinary bladder. Both tolterodine and its major, active metabolite, the 5-hydroxymetiiyl derivative of tolterodine, which significantly contributes to the therapeutic effect, have<br><br>
considerably less side effects than oxybutynin, especially regarding the propensity to cause dry mouth.<br>
The currently marketed administration form of tolterodine is a simple film coated tablet containing 1 mg or 2 mg of tolterodine L-tartrate for immediate release in the gastrointestinal tract, the recommended dosage usually being 2 mg twice a day and also as 4 mg extended release pellets filled in capsules. While, as mentioned, the side effects, such as dry mouth, are much lower than for oxybutynin, they still exist, especially at higher dosages.<br>
Tolterodine tartrate is a muscarinic receptor antagonist and it is chemically (+)-N, N-diisopropyl-3- (2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)"3"phenylpropylamine L-hydrogen tartrate. The oral administration of tolterodine results in its metabolization in the liver, resulting in the formation of its 5-hydroxymethyl derivative, which is a major pharmacologically active metabolite. The 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite exhibits an anti-muscarinic activity similar to that of the main compound tolterodine, which contributes significantly the therapeutic effect.<br>
The most common side effects of tolterodine include dry mouth, dyspepsia, headache, constipation, xerophtiialmia and abnormal vision.<br>
The US Patmt No. 5382600 describes preparation of certain novel 3,3-diphenyl propylamines, their use as anticholinergic agents and their pharmaceutical compositions, as plain tablets and capsules for immediate release.<br>
The US Patent No, 5559269 also elaborates on similar compounds and generally includes various galenical forms without detailing any compositions.<br>
The US Patent Publication No.20030027856 described pharmaceutical compositions in the form of immediate release tablets and transdermal devices comprising tolterodine metabolites. The ingredients for immediate release detailed in this prior art comprise Des-<br><br>
isopropyl-tolterodine, microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, calcium stearate and FD&amp;C blue #1 lake. In this prior art, process details not described.<br>
The US Patent publication No.20030124179 describes transdennally administered tolterodine as anti-muscarinic agent for the treatment of overactive bladder. The process described in this prior art is very complex, not economical and release of drug will be subjected to several variables related to product and patirats.-<br>
Canadian patent No. 2311755 details a controlled release formulation of tolterodine or its salts for treating unstable or overactive urinary bladder that.administer the drug at a controlled rate for at least 24 hours. It details the production of a controlled release (CR) capsule containing non-pareil beads coated by (i) an ethyl cellulose layer (ii) a tolterodine / HPMC layer, and iii) a sustained release ethyl cellulose / HPMC layer. This process involves a multi-step manufacturing and may not be cost effective besides being time consuming.<br>
US Patent No. 6630162 relates to a pharmaceutical formulation containing tolterodine or its derivatives, which exhibit a controlled in vitro release of the active ingredient in phosphate buffer at pH 6.8 of not less than about 80% after 18 hours. After oral administration to a patient it is capable of maintaining a substantially constant serum level of the active moiety or moieties for 24 hours. The process detailed in this prior art comprises sugar spheres coated with Surelease seal coat, drug coat, Surelease / HPMC controlled release coating. The coated spheres were filled in hard gelatin capsules to obtain 2mg and 4mg tolterodine L-tartrate capsules. It was also said that the controlled release beads may be provided as a tablet.<br>
As per the processes described in the above said prior art, drug release occurs preferentially by diffusion process through pores created by hydrophilic materials such as HPMC that leads to burst effect of drug release during early hours of drug administration.<br><br>
The above multi-particulate system (a plurality of beads that can be loaded into either a capsule or tablet, each of the "beads" is sorted for a characteristic rate of disintegration) is quite complex, adding significantly to the cost of design and manufacture.<br>
Often, a multi-particulate system may even require specialized equipment, further increasing manufacturing costs. Variation in the surface and coating thickness can also translate to incomplete release of the active ingredients one of the shortcomings of this type of technology.<br>
A problem frequently encountered with controlled release dosage form is the inability to increase residence time of the dosage form in the stomach and proximal portion of the small intestine. Under fast condition, gastric residence of a dosage form is typically short, which is not more than an hour and it is also common for dosage form to transit rapidly through the small intestine for not more than 3 hours. Rapid GI transit phenomena may consequently diminish the extent of absorption of many drugs.<br>
Since many drug compounds are absorbed exclusively in the small intestine or in a limited segment of the intestine, it would therefore be beneficial to develop sustained release dosage form, which remains in the stomach and / or in the proximal portion of the intestine for an extended period of time.<br>
Several approaches have been tried to prolong gastrointestinal residence, one of which is the use of oral mucoadhesive formulation.<br>
Mucoadhesive polymers have been utilized in many different dosage forms in efforts to achieve systemic delivery of drugs through the different mucosae. The term mucoadhesive is commonly used for materials that bind to the mucin layer of a biological membrane. To serve as mucoadhesive polymers, the polymers should possess some general physiochemical features such as predominantly anionic hydrophilicity with numerous hydrogen bond forming groups, suitable surface property for wetting mucus/mucosal tissue surfaces and sufficient flexibility to penetrate the mucus network<br><br>
or tissue crevices. Mucin molecule behaves as anionic polyelectrolytes at neutral pH. At low pH values, such as found in the stomach, sialic acids are protonated and as resuh, are not charged. Numerous hydroxyl groups of carbohydrates on mucin molecules have the potential to interact with other polymers that can form hydrogen bonds. The interaction between two molecules is composed of attraction and repulsion. For mucoadhesion .to occur, the attractive interaction should be large than nonspecific repulsion. Mucin molecules are negatively charged at neutral pH due to the presence of carboxylate and sulphate groups. A number of charged or neutral polymers have been classified as bio/mucoadhesives, since they are known to bind to mucous via co-valent bonds. Diverse classes of polymers have been investigated for potential use as mucoadhesives. These include synthetic polymers such as poly (acrylic acid) (PAA), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and poly (methacrylate) derivatives, as well as naturally occurring polymers such as hyaluronic acid and chitosan.<br>
Hence there is a need to work on a process, which proves easy and economical for large-scale production and yet at the same time ensures a 24-hour release mechanism by remaining in the stomach or in the proximal portion of the intestine for extended period of time.<br>
Accordingly, the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved oral controlled release matrix dosage formulation in a therapeutic dose, in the tablet form, mini tablets in capsules containing 2 and 4-mg tolterodine tartrate for 24 hour release useful for the treatment of urge incontinence and other symptoms of unstable or overactive urinary bladder. The unit dose may vary according to the age of the patient and the nature and severity of the urge incontinence and other symptoms of unstable or overactive urinary bladder. It generally ranges from 2 to 4 mg, in a single administration, for a daily treatment.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a dosage form that reduces fluctuations in blood plasma concentration of Tolterodine so as to have an optimum effective therapeutic window.<br><br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a dosage form enabling the patient to be comparatively free from the side effects such as dry mouth, dyspepsia, headache, constipation, xerophthalmia and abnormal vision.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a dosage form which releases the drug throughout the gastro-intestinal tract by meeting both temporal and spatial requirements of a once a day medication through its mucoadhesive nature in gastro intestinal tract.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide control release mucoadhesive matrix tablets, prepared by wet and/or dry granulation processes and direct compressions.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide controlled release mucoadhesive mini tablets prepared by wet and/or dry granulations processes and direct compression and filled into capsules.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a barrier coating for preventing adhesion to oral mucous membrane during administration.<br>
Accordingly in the present invention, controlled release mucoadhesive matrix (monolithic) tablets are prepared where the drug is dissolved and/or dispersed in the polymer matrix system. The tablet will bind to the mucin layer of a biological membrane of gastro intestinal tract at the pH range of 1.2 to 6.8 preferentially at pH 4.5 to 6.2. The release of drug from the dosage form is by diffusion through hydrogel (swelling) and controlled erosion of the matrix.<br>
More especially, the present invention describes a controlled release mucoadhesive matrix tablet that can be administered by the oral route and that enables sustained and controlled release of the active ingredient, tolterodine tartrate for the treatment of urge<br><br>
incontinence and other symptoms of unstable or overactive urinary bladder, by providing more consistent plasma levels.<br>
