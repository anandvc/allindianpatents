STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED<br>
RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT<br>
Not applicable.<br>
BACKGROUND D OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the detection of<br>
glucose in samples which ray also contain potential<br>
interfering compounds, Such as α-hydroxy acids or (3-<br>
diketones.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
The complexation of carbohydrates, including glucose,<br>
with phenylboronic acid las been known for a long time<br>
and the reversibility of that interaction has served as a<br>
basis for the chromatographic separation of sugars.<br><br>
Specifically, in 1959, Iorand and Edwards reported<br>
association constants fcr aqueous associations of<br>
phenylboronic acid with many saturated polyols; binding<br>
interactions ranged fron very weak (e.g., ethylene<br>
glycol, Kd=360 mM) to moderately strong (e.g., glucose,<br>
Kd=9.1 mM) . See J. Yoon, et al., Bioorganic and Medicinal<br>
Chemistry 1(4):267-71 (3993). The binding mechanism is<br>
believed to occur throuch bonding of adjacent hydroxyl<br>
groups on glucose to hycroxyl groups on a boronate<br>
moiety.<br>
U.S. Patent '5,503,773 (James, et al.) describes a<br>
fluorescent boronic acid-containing compound that emits<br>
fluorescence of a high intensity upon binding to<br>
saccharides, including glucose. The fluorescent compound<br>
has a molecular structure comprising a fluorophore, at<br>
least one phenylboronic acid moiety and at least one<br>
amine-providinig nitrogex atom where the nitrogen atom is<br>
disposed in the vicinity of the phenylboronic acid moiety<br>
so as to interact intramolecularly with the boronic acid.<br>
Such interaction thereby causes the compound to emit<br>
fluorescence upon saccharide binding. See also T. James,<br>
et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 117(35):8982-87 (1995).<br>
Additionally, fluorescent sensors using an<br>
anthrylboronic acid-containing compound for detecting<br>
blood glucose are known in the art. For example, J.<br>
Yoon, et al., J. Am. Chum. Soc. 114:5874-5875 (1992)<br>
describe that anthrylboronic acid can be used as a<br>
fluorescent chemosensor for signaling carbohydrate<br>
binding, including binding of glucose and fructose.<br>
Unfortunately, compounds which interact with glucose<br>
in the manner described above also have a tendency to<br>
interact with other compounds having hydroxyl groups,<br>
thus reducing the specilicity of a glucose assay,<br>
especially when assaying physiological samples which may<br><br>
contain interfering amounts of lactate, acetoacetate,<br>
etc. For example, some diabetic patients also develop<br>
lactic acidosis, in which blood lactate levels are<br>
greater than 5 mmol/liter. Thus, there remains a great<br>
need for glucose assays which are relatively insensitive<br>
to potentially interfering hydroxyl compounds, such as.<br>
lactate.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides a way<br>
to detect the presence or concentration of glucose in a<br>
sample which may also contain interfering compounds, such<br>
as α-hydroxy acids or β-diketones. Such potentially<br>
interfering compounds incude lactate, acetoacetate, (3-<br>
hydroxy butyric acid, etc.<br>
The present invention is carried out using an<br>
indicator compound which is capable of recognizing<br>
glucose in a sample, but which is less likely to<br>
recognize interfering conpounds in the sample. The<br>
indicator compound has a least two recognition elements<br>
for glucose, oriented such that the interaction between<br>
the indicator compound and glucose is more stable than<br>
the interaction between the indicator compound and the<br>
interfering compounds.<br>
Suitable recognition elements include moieties which<br>
are capable of a preferaily reversible interaction with<br>
glucose, especially with the diol groups present in<br>
glucose. Several such recognition elements are known,<br>
and preferably include boronic acid, boronate ion,<br>
arsenious acid, arsenite ion, telluric acid, tellurate<br>
ion, germanic acid, germanate ion, etc. Most preferred<br>
are recognition elements containing boron. It will be<br><br>
understood that until use, the recognition elements may<br>
be capped with a protecting group. Such groups are well<br>
known, and include neoper:yl glycol, pinacol, etc. In<br>
certain embodiments, the capped recognition element is<br>
decapped in the medium in which the compound is to be<br>
used (see, e.g., Example 5).<br>
The recognition elements are preferably spaced on the<br>
indicator compound a sui :able distance from each other so<br>
as to allow at least two of the recognition elements to<br>
interact with a glucose nolecule, resulting in increased<br>
specificity. In general the recognition elements may<br>
have a spacer of up to about 30 atoms between them.<br>
Preferably, the recognition elements are oriented such<br>
that they are capable of being about 6Å apart when<br>
interacting with glucose<br>
The indicator compourds of the present invention have<br>
a detectable quality that changes in a concentration-<br>
dependent manner when the compound is exposed to a sample<br>
containing glucose. Many such qualities are known and<br>
may be used xn the present invention. For example, the<br>
indicator compound may include a luminescent (fluorescent<br>
or phosphorescent) or chemiluminescent moiety, an<br>
absorbance based moiety, etc. The indicator compound may<br>
include an energy donor noiety and an energy acceptor<br>
moiety, each spaced such that there is a detectable<br>
change when the indicator compound interacts with<br>
glucose. The indicator compound may include a<br>
fluorophore and a quencher, configured such that the<br>
fluorophore is quenched by the quencher when glucose is<br>
absent. In that situation, when glucose is present, the<br>
indicator undergoes a configurational change which causes<br>
the quencher to move sufficiently distant from the<br>
fluorophore so that fluorescence is emitted. Conversely,<br>
the fluorophore and quencher may be configured such that<br><br><br>
in the absence of glucose, they are sufficiently<br>
separated and the fluorophore emits fluorescence; upon<br>
interaction with glucose, the fluorophore and quencher<br>
are moved in sufficient proximity to cause quenching.<br>
The configurational change concept is described in more<br>
detail in our co-pending application Serial No.<br>
09/754,219, filed January 5, 2001, entitled "Detection of<br>
Analytes", incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Alternatively, the indicator may include a moiety<br>
such as a fluorophore capable of interacting with the<br>
recognition element or another moiety spatially disposed<br>
with respect to the reccgnition element such that in the<br>
absence of glucose, the fluorophore emits fluorescence.<br>
Upon addition of glucose, the glucose competes with the<br>
interaction between the fluorophore and the recognition<br>
element, or the interaction between the fluorophore and<br>
the other moiety spatially disposed with respect to the<br>
recognition element, causing a reduction in fluorescence.<br>
An example of that concept is illustrated in Example 6.<br>
It will also be recognized that the indicator may be<br>
chosen such that the fluorophore emits no fluorescence,<br>
or a relatively low leveL of fluorescence, when the<br>
fluorophore interacts wi ;h the recognition element or<br>
another moiety spatially disposed with respect to the<br>
recognition element in tie absence of glucose. Upon<br>
addition of glucose, the glucose competes with the<br>
interaction between the fluorophore and the recognition<br>
element, or the interact .on between the fluorophore and<br>
the other moiety spatially disposed with respect to the<br>
recognition element, causing an increase in fluorescence.<br>
Other detectable moieties include those whose<br>
fluorescence is affected by glucose interaction via<br>
photoinduced electron transfer or inductive effects.<br>
These include the lantharide chelates disclosed in<br><br>
copending U.S. Application Serial No. 09/265,979 filed<br>
March 11, 1999 (and published as PCT International<br>
Application WO 99/46600 on September 16, 1999),<br>
incorporated herein by reference; polyaromatic<br>
hydrocarbons and their derivatives; coumarins; BoDiPy;<br>
dansyl; catechols; etc. Another class of moieties<br>
include those whose abso::bance spectrum changes upon<br>
interaction of the indicator compound with glucose,<br>
including Alizarin Red, etc. Another class of moieties<br>
include those whose fluorescence is modulated by<br>
proximity effects, e.g., energy donor/acceptor pairs such<br>
as dansyl/dabsyl, etc.<br>
Preferably, the detectable quality is a detectable<br>
spectral change, such as changes in absorptive<br>
characteristics (e.g., absorbtivity and/or spectral<br>
shift), in fluorescent decay time (determined by time<br>
domain or frequency domain measurement), fluorescent<br>
intensity, fluorescent ahasotropy or polarization; a<br>
spectral shift of the emission spectrum; a change in<br>
time-resolved anisotropy decay (determined by time domain<br>
or frequency domain measurement) , etc.<br>
The indicator compounds of the present invention, if<br>
soluble, may be used directly in solution if so desired.<br>
On the other hand, if the desired application so<br>
requires, the indicator compounds may be immobilized<br>
(such as by mechanical entrapment or covalent or ionic<br>
attachment) onto or within an insoluble surface or matrix<br>
such as glass, plastic, polymeric materials, etc. When<br>
the indicator compound i 3 entrapped within, for example,<br>
another polymer, the entrapping material preferably<br>
should be sufficiently permeable to glucose to allow<br>
suitable interaction between glucose and the indicator<br>
compound.<br><br>
If the indicator compounds are sparingly soluble or<br>
insoluble in water, yet detection in an aqueous medium is<br>
desired, the indicator compound may be co-polymerized<br>
with a hydrophilic mononer to form a hydrophilic<br>
macromolecule as described in co-pending U.S. application<br>
Serial No. 09/632,624, filed August 4, 2000, the contents<br>
of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Preferred indicator compounds have the following<br>
structure:<br><br>
wherein:<br>
-R1 and R2 are the same or different and are selected<br>
from the following: hydrogen; ii) a substituent to<br>
modify the pKa and hydrolytic stability of the R8<br>
moiety, iii) a detectable moiety, or iv) a linking<br>
group capable of attachment to a solid support or a<br>
polymeric matrix, sa..d support or matrix optionally<br>
containing a detectable moiety;<br>
-R3 is hydrogen or a linking group capable of<br>
attachment to a solid support or a polymeric matrix,<br>
said support or matrix optionally containing a<br>
detectable moiety;<br>
-R4 and R5 are the sane or different and are selected<br>
from the following: i) hydrogen, ii) a substituent to<br>
modify the pKa and hydrolytic stability of the R8<br>
moiety, iii) a detectable moiety, or iv) a linking<br>
group capable of attachment to a solid support or a<br><br>
polymeric matrix, said support or matrix optionally<br>
containing a detectable moiety;<br>
-each Z is independently carbon or nitrogen;<br>
-R6 and R7 are the same or different and are<br>
i) linking groups havnig from zero to ten contiguous<br>
or branched carbon and/or heteroatoms, or ii) a<br>
linking group capable of attachment to a solid<br>
support or a polymeric matrix, said support or matrix<br>
optionally containing a detectable moiety;<br>
-R is selected from the following: i) an aliphatic<br>
and/or aromatic spacer containing from 1 to 10<br>
contiguous atoms selected from the group consisting<br>
of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus,<br>
ii) a detectable moiety, or iii) a linking group<br>
capable of attachment to a solid support or a<br>
polymeric matrix, said support or matrix optionally<br>
containing a detectable moiety;<br>
-each R8 is the same or different and is an optionally<br>
protected moiety whicn when unprotected is capable of<br>
interaction with the vicinal diol groups present in<br>
glucose; and<br>
-R9 and R10 are the sane or different, and are i)<br>
hydrogen, ii) a detectable moiety, iii) a group<br>
which is a) a linking group capable of attachment<br>
to a solid support or a polymeric matrix, said<br>
support or matrix optionally containing a<br>
detectable moiety, ard/or b) includes a functional<br>
group capable of altering the physical properties<br>
of the compound;<br>
with the proviso that the indicator compound contains at<br>
least one detectable moiety associated therewith, either<br>
directly or as part of the solid support or polymeric<br>
matrix.<br><br>
Suitable groups for modifying the: pKa and hydrolytic<br>
stability of the R8 moities would be readily apparent to<br>
one of ordinary skill, and include groups such as<br>
halogen; nitro; amino; halogen substituted alkyl;<br>
optionally substituted carboxyl; acyl; keto; nitrile;<br>
amide; ester; alkoxy; etc..<br>
Suitable linking groups for any substituent may<br>
include groups from about 1 to about 20 contiguous atoms,<br>
which may be branched or substituted and which may<br>
include one or more hetreroatoms, which terminate in a<br>
functional group capable of further reaction or<br>
attachment to a polymer or support. Examples of suitable<br>
linking groups include alkyl; aryl; acyl; polyamide;<br>
polyether; all optionally substituted, and combinations<br>
thereof.<br>
R9 and R10 may further include functional groups<br>
capable of altering the physical properties of the<br>
compound, such as solubility, pKa, etc. For example,<br>
these include optionally substituted carboxylates, amino<br>
groups, quartenary ammonium groups, sulfonates, PEG, etc.<br>
It will be understood that when any of the<br>
substituents is a detecable moiety, that could also<br>
include suitable linking groups which link the detectable<br>
moiety to the rest of the indicator compound. Suitable<br>
linking groups include those listed above. Suitable<br>
detectable moieties include those defined above.<br>
R8 is preferably selected from the group consisting of<br>
boronic acid, boronate ion, arsenious acid, arsenite ion,<br>
telluric acid, tellurate ion, germanic acid, germanate<br>
ion, and combinations thereof.<br>
It will also be understood from the above definition<br>
that the present compounds and detection systems may be<br>
in polymeric form. Thus, an integral compound<br>
(containing recognition elements and detectable moiety)<br><br>
could be linked to an existing polymer, or the integral<br>
compound in monomeric form could be polymerized or co-<br>
polymerized with another suitable monomer to form a<br>
polymer. Alternatively, two separate monomeric<br>
components (e.g., one containing the recognition<br>
elements, and one containing a detectable moiety) could<br>
be co-polymerized so that the resulting polymer contains<br>
all necessary elements of the system (see Example 6).<br>
Many uses exist for the indicator compounds of the<br>
present invention, including uses as indicators in the<br>
fields of energy, medicine and agriculture. For example,<br>
the indicator compounds can be used to detect sub-levels<br>
or supra-levels of gluccse in physiological buffers or<br>
fluids, such as blood, plasma, serum, interstitial fluid,<br>
cerebrospinal fluid, urine, saliva, intraocular fluid,<br>
lymph, tears, or sweat, thus providing valuable<br>
information for diagnosing or monitoring such diseases as<br>
diabetes and adrenal insufficiency.<br>
Medical/pharmaceutical production of glucose for<br>
human therapeutic application requires monitoring and<br>
control.<br>
Uses for the present invention in agriculture include<br>
detecting levels of gluccse in soybeans and other<br>
agricultural products. Glucose must be carefully<br>
monitored in critical harvest decisions for such high<br>
value products as wine crapes. As glucose is the most<br>
expensive carbon source and feedstock in fermentation<br>
processes, glucose monitoring for optimum reactor feed<br>
rate control is importart in power alcohol production.<br>
Reactor mixing and control of glucose concentration also<br>
is critical to quality control during production of soft<br>
drinks and fermented beverages, which consumes the<br>
largest amounts of glucose and fermentable (vicinal diol)<br>
sugars internationally.<br><br>
When the indicator compounds incorporate fluorescent<br>
indicator substituents, various detection techniques also<br>
are known in the art. For example, the compounds of the<br>
invention can be used ir fluorescent sensing devices<br>
(e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,517,313) or can be bound to<br>
polymeric material such as test paper for visual<br>
inspection. This latter technique would permit, for<br>
example, glucose measurement in a manner analogous to<br>
determining pH with a strip of litmus paper. The<br>
compounds described herein may also be utilized as simple<br>
reagents with standard benchtop analytical<br>
instrumentation such as spectrofluorometers or clinical<br>
analyzers as made by Shimadzu, Hitachi, Jasco, Beckman<br>
and others. These molecules would also provide analyte<br>
specific chemical/optica . signal transduction for fiber<br>
optic-based sensors and analytical fluorometers as made<br>
by Ocean Optics (Dunedin Florida), or Oriel Optics.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,517,311, the disclosure of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference, describes a<br>
fluorescence sensing device in which the compounds of the<br>
present invention can be used to determine the presence<br>
or concentration of glucose in a liquid medium. The<br>
sensing device comprises a layered array of a fluorescent<br>
indicator molecule-contaning matrix (hereafter<br>
"fluorescent matrix"), a high-pass filter and a<br>
photodetector. In this device, a light source,<br>
preferably a light-emitting diode ("LED"), is located at<br>
least partially within the indicator material, or in a<br>
waveguide upon which the indicator matrix is disposed,<br>
such that incident light from the light source causes the<br>
indicator molecules to fluoresce. The high-pass filter<br>
allows emitted light to reach the photodetector, while<br>
filtering out scattered incident light from the light<br>
source. The fluorescence of the indicator molecules<br><br>
employed in the device described in U.S. Patent 5,517,313<br>
is modulated, e.g., attenuated or enhanced, by the local<br>
presence of glucose.<br>
In the sensor described in U.S. Patent 5,517,313, the<br>
material which contains the indicator molecule is<br>
permeable to the analyte. Thus, the analyte can diffuse<br>
into the material from the surrounding test medium,<br>
thereby affecting the fluorescence emitted by the<br>
indicator compounds. The light source, indicator<br>
compound-containing material, high-pass filter and<br>
photodetector are configured such that at least a portion<br>
of the fluorescence emitted by the indicator compounds<br>
impacts the photodetector, generating an electrical<br>
signal which is indicative of the concentration of<br>
glucose in the surrounding medium.<br>
In accordance with other possible embodiments for<br>
using the indicator compounds of the present invention,<br>
sensing devices also are described in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,910,661, 5,917,605 and 5,894,351, all incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can also be<br>
used in an implantable device, for example to<br>
continuously monitor blood glucose levels in vivo.<br>
Suitable devices are described in, for example, co-<br>
pending U.S. Patent Appllication Serial No. 09/383,148<br>
filed August 26, 1999, as well as U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,833,603, 6,002,954 and 6,011,984, all incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be<br>
prepared by persons skilled in the art without an undue<br>
amount of experimentation using readily known reaction<br>
mechanisms and reagents, for example including reaction<br>
mechanisms which are consistent with the general<br>
procedures described below.<br><br>

C. Preparation of N,N-dimethylacrylamide hydrogel with<br>
glucose indicator:<br>
A solution of N,N-dimethylacrylamide (40% wt.) and<br>
N,N=-methylenebisacrylamide (0.8% wt.) in ethylene glycol<br>
was prepared. 9,10-bis[N-[2-(5,5-dimethylborinan-2-yl)-<br>
benzyl]-N-[3-(methacrylauido)propylamino]methylanthracene<br>
(17.8 mg, 2xl0-5 mole) and 40 μL of aqueous ammonium<br>
persulfate (5% wt) were combined with 1 mL of ethylene<br>
glycol monomer solution. The resulting solution was<br>
placed in a glove box purged with nitrogen. An aqueous<br>
solution of N,N,N=,N=-tetramethylethylenediamine (80 uL,<br>
.5% wt.) was added to the nonomer formulation to<br>
accelerate polymerization. The resulting formulation was<br>
poured in a mold constructed from microscope slides and<br><br>
100 micron stainless steel spacer. After being kept for<br>
8 hours in nitrogen atmosphere the mold was placed in<br>
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (10 mM PBS, pH=7.4), the<br>
microscope slides were separated, and the hydrogel was<br>
removed. The hydrogel was washed with 100 mL of PBS<br>
containing 1 mM lauryl sulfate sodium salt and 1 mM EDTA<br>
sodium salt for 3 days, 1 he solution being changed every<br>
day, followed by washing with DMF/PBS (10/90 by vol., 3 x<br>
100 mL), and finally with PBS (pH=7.4, 3 x 100 mL). The<br>
resulting hydrogel polymer was stored in PBS (10 mM PBS,<br>
pH=7.4) containing 0.2% wt. sodium azide and 1 mM EDTA<br>
sodium salt.<br>
II. Modulation of Fluorescence With Glucose, Lactate and<br>
Acetoacetate<br>
The modulation of the fluorescence of the indicator<br>
compound (which contains two recognition elements)<br>
prepared in this example by glucose, lactate and<br>
acetoacetate was determined. Figure 4 shows the<br>
normalized fluorescence emission (I/Io @ 427 nm) of a<br>
hydrogel containing the glucose recognition molecule of<br>
this example in 10 mM PB! , pH 7.4 containing 0.2% NaN3 and<br>
1 mM EDTA containing various amounts of sodium-L-lactate,<br>
lithium acetoacetate or c-D-glucose. Data were recorded<br>
using a Shimadzu RF-5301 spectrofluorometer with<br>
excitation @365 nm (slit - 3 nm) and emission at 427 nm<br>
(slit = 3 nm) at low sensitivity at 37°C using a<br>
temperature controlled sample holder. The cuvettes<br>
containing 3 mL of the de sired solution were equilibrated<br>
at 37°C for 15 minutes before measurement. Each hydrogel<br>
sample was measured in four independent samples. Error<br>
bars are standard deviation with quadruplicate values for<br>
each data point. The hygrogels containing a glucose<br>
recognition molecule were prepared as previously<br>
described. The hydrogels were mounted on glass slides<br><br>
and covered with polyester mesh in PMMA cuvettes at 4 5D<br>
to the incident light. Solutions of 1, 5, 10 and 20 mM<br>
sodium L-lactate [Aldrich], 5, 10 and 20 mM lithium<br>
acetoacetate [Aldrich], and 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20 mM<br>
α-D-glucose were prepared in 10 mM PBS, pH 7.4 containing<br>
0.2% NaN3 and 1 mM EDTA. The fluorescence of the<br>
copolymer was affected by the presence of glucose, but<br>
not by the presence of lactate or acetoacetate.<br>

sodium salt for 3 days the solution being changed every<br>
day, followed by washing with MeOH/PBS (20/80 by vol., 3<br>
x 100 mL) , and finally with PBS (pH=7.4, 3 x 100 mL) .<br>
Hydrogel polymer was stored in PBS (10 mM PBS, pH=7.4)<br>
containing 0.2% wt. sodium azide and 1 mM EDTA sodium<br>
salt.<br>
F. Modulation of Absorbance With Glucose and Lactate<br>
The modulation of the absorbance of the indicator<br>
hydrogel (which contains two recognition elements)<br>
prepared in this example by glucose and lactate was<br>
determined. The acrylamide gel was mounted in PMMA cell<br>
in the same way as described in Example 4. Phosphate<br><br>
buffered saline (PBS), pH=7.4 containing desired amount<br>
of glucose or sodium lactate was heated to 37°C in a<br>
water bath and placed in the PMMA cell containing the gel<br>
after which the PMMA c ell was allowed to equilibrate for<br>
15 min at 37°C. Absorbance measurement for each glucose<br>
or lactate concentration was conducted in triplicate.<br>
For each measurement, absorbance at 650 nm was used as a<br>
blank, A(650 nm) was subtracted from all values of<br>
A(450nm) and A(530 nm).<br>
Figure 6 shows the absorbance spectra for acrylamide<br>
gel (30%) containing 4 mM Alizarin Red S monomer and 44<br>
mM bis boronic acid monomer with and without glucose.<br>
Figure 7 shows the effect of glucose on absorbance of<br>
acrylamide gel (30%) containing 4 mM Alizarin Red S<br>
monomer and 4 4 mM bis boronic acid monomer. Figure 8<br>
shows the effect of sodium lactate on absorbance of<br>
acrylamide gel (30%) containing 4 mM Alizarin,Red S<br>
monomer and 4 4 mM bis boronic acid monomer. The<br>
absorbance of the indicator was affected by the presence<br>
of glucose, but not substantially affected by the<br>
presence of lactate.<br>
G. Modulation of Fluorescence With Glucose and Lactate<br>
The modulation of the fluorescence of an acrylamide<br>
gel synthesized substantially in accordance with this<br>
Example 6 (except that 1.9 mg of N-[3-(methacrylamido)-<br>
propyl]-3,4-dihydroxy-9,10-dioxo-2-anthracenesulfonamide<br>
and 35 mg of α,α'-bis [N-[2-(5,5-dimethylborinan-2-yl)-<br>
benzyl]-N-[3-(methacrylamido)propylamino]-1,4-xylene were<br>
used) was determined.<br>
The experiment was conducted in a Shimadzu RF-5301<br>
PC spectrofluorimeter equipped with a variable<br>
temperature attachment (excitation at 470 nm, slits 3/10<br>
nm, high sensitivity). The acrylamide gel was attached<br>
to a piece of a glass slide which was glued in a PMMA<br><br>
fluorescence cell at a 5° angle. The cell was filled<br>
with 2.5 ml of PBS (pH=7.4) and heated to 37°C. Stock<br>
solutions of glucose (1)0 mM and 500 mM) in PBS (pH=7.4)<br>
were prepared and heated to 37°C in a water bath. An<br>
aliquot of heated glucose stock solution was added to the<br>
PMMA cell periodically while the fluorescence intensity<br>
at 550 nm was monitored as a function of time (1<br>
measurement every 2 minutes). Glucose concentration in<br>
the PMMA cell was measured using a YSI Model 2300 STAT<br>
plus glucose analyzer. The results, shown in Figure 9,<br>
show that the addition of glucose reduces the fluorescent<br>
intensity of the indicator hydrogel. The same effect is<br>
seen in Figure 10, which shows the effect of glucose on<br>
the fluorescence spectrum of the same type of gel.<br>
That effect is beJieved to occur because of the<br>
following considerations. The methacrylamide monomer of<br>
Alizarin Red S (reporter molecule) contains a vicinal<br>
diol functionality and monomer functionality (see<br>
structure below). In i.queous solution and in organic<br>
solvents, the Alizarin Red S and bis-boronate recognition<br>
element monomers (see structure below) are capable of<br>
reversible reaction with each other to form a boronate<br>
ester. The boronate ester molecule formed in this<br>
reversible reaction is fluorescent, while the Alizarin<br>
Red S monomer by itself displays virtually no<br>
fluorescence emission in aqueous solution and in organic<br>
solvents, such as MeOH. Thus upon binding to the glucose<br>
recognition element, Alizarin Red S changes its optical<br>
properties, such as absorbance and quantum yield of<br>
fluorescence, for example.<br><br><br>
A solution of Alizarin Red S with monomer<br>
functionality and glucose recognition element with<br>
monomer functionality can be prepared together with a<br>
hydrogel monomer and a crosslinker. Copolymerization of<br>
this mixture produces a hydrogel material which is<br>
diffusable to various small and medium size molecules;<br>
thus it is capable of analyte detection and quantitation.<br>
An analyte, such as glucose for example, would diffuse<br>
inside the hydrogel matrix and displace the reporter<br>
molecule previously bound to the recognition element.<br>
This event causes a change in the optical properties of<br>
the hydrogel film since it now contains a greater number<br>
of reporter molecules unbound to the recognition element.<br>
The modulation of the fluorescence of the indicator<br>
compound (which contains two recognition elements)<br>
prepared in this example by glucose and lactate was also<br>
determined. The experiment was conducted in a Shimadzu<br>
RF-5301 PC spectrofluorimeter equipped with a variable<br>
temperature attachment (excitation at 470 nm, slits 5/10<br>
nm, low sensitivity). The acrylamide gel was attached to<br>
a piece of a glass slide which was glued in a PMMA<br>
fluorescence cell at a 45° angle. The cell was filled<br>
with 2.5 ml of PBS (pH=7.4) and heated to 37°C in a water<br><br>
bath. A stock solution of sodium lactate (100 mM) in PBS<br>
(pH=7.4) was prepared and heated to 37 °C in a water bath.<br>
Stock solutions of glucose (100 mM and 500 mM) in PBS<br>
(pH=7.4) were prepared and heated to 37°C in a water<br>
bath. An aliquot of heated lactate stock solution was<br>
added to the PMMA cell periodically while the<br>
fluorescence intensity at 550 ran was monitored as a<br>
function of time (1 measurement every 2 minutes), until<br>
the lactate concentration reached 8 mM. Then, an aliquot<br>
of heated glucose stock solution was added to the PMMA<br>
cell periodically while the fluorescence intensity at 550<br>
nm was monitored as a function of time (1 measurement<br>
every 2 minutes). Glucose concentration in the PMMA cell<br>
was measured using a YSI Model 2300 STAT plus glucose<br>
analyzer. The results shown in Figure 11, show that the<br>
addition of lactate had no significant effect on the<br>
fluorescent intensity of the indicator hydrogel, and the<br>
subsequent addition of glucose reduced the fluorescent<br>
intensity of the indicator hydrogel.<br>

subsequently evaporatec to yield a solid. To this solid,<br>
1 mL of phosphate buffer solution containing monomers was<br>
added. After sonicaticn for 10 min this solution was<br>
filtered through a 0.2 uM PTFE membrane filter. Aqueous<br>
ammonium persulfate (2C μL, 5% wt.) was combined with the<br>

E. Modulation of Fluorescence with Glucose.<br>
The modulation of the fluorescence of the 6-<br>
(cyclohexanecarboxamido)hexylamine indicator/DMA hydrogel<br>
film prepared in this example by glucose and lactate was<br>
determined. Figure 14 shows the relative fluorescence<br>
emission (I @ 430 nm) of the hydrogel film in PBS (pH 7.4<br>
containing 0.02% NaN3 and 1 mM EDTA) containing 0 to 20 mM<br>
α-D-glucose, 0 to 10 mM I-sodium lactate, and 0-20 mM α-<br>
D-glucose in the presence of 4 mM L-sodium lactate. The<br><br>
hydrogel film (100 μM thickness, 8 mm diameter disk) was<br>
mounted in a PMMA cuvette at a 45° angle. All<br>
measurements were made at 37°C in a Shimadzu RF-5301<br>
spectrofluorometer with excitation at 370 nm (slit = 3<br>
nm) and emission at 4 30 nm (slit = 3 nm) at low PMT<br>
sensitivity. Glucose and L-sodium lactate concentrations<br>
were checked using the YSI Model 2300 STAT plus glucose<br>
analyzer. Error bars are standard deviation with<br>
triplicate values for each data point. The fluorescence<br>
was affected by the presence of glucose, but not by the<br>
presence of lactate. Moreover, the presence of lactate<br>
(4 mM) had no significant effect on the 0-20 mM glucose<br>
calibration curve.<br>

1 mM EDTA) containing 0 to 20 mM α-D-glucose, 0 to 10 mM L-<br>
sodium lactate, and 0-20 mM glucose in the presence of 3 mM<br>
L-sodium lactate. The hydrogel film (100 μm thickness, 8<br>
mm diameter disk) was mounted in a PMMA cuvette at a 4 5°<br><br>
angle. All measurements were made at 37°C in a Shimadzu RF-<br>
5301 spectrofluorometer with excitation at 370 nm (slit =<br>
3 nm) and emission at 430 nm (slit = 3 nm) at low PMT<br>
sensitivity. Glucose and L-sodium lactate concentrations<br>
were checked using the YSI Model 2300 STAT plus glucose<br>
analyzer. The data is plotted as the average of triplicate<br>
values for each data point. The fluorescence was affected<br>
by the presence of glucose, but not by the presence of<br>
lactate. Moreover, the presence of lactate (4 mM) had no<br>
significant effect or the 0-20 mM glucose calibration<br>
curve.<br>

2 ml of MeOH. This solution was sonicated until all<br>
fructose dissolved and evaporated to yield a solid. To<br>
this solid 1 ml of phosphate buffer solution containing<br>
monomers was added. After sonication for 10 minutes this<br>
solution was filtered through 0.2 μM PTFE filter.<br>
Aqueous ammonium persulfate (20 μL, 5% wt.) was combined<br>
with the formulation. The resulting solution was placed<br>
in a glove box purged with nitrogen. An aqueous solution<br>
of N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (40 μL, 5% wt.)<br>
was added to the monomer formulation to accelerate<br>
polymerization. The resulting formulation was poured in<br><br>
a mold constructed from microscope slides and a 100 μM<br>
stainless steel spacer. After being kept for 8 hours in<br>
a nitrogen atmosphere the mold was placed in phosphate<br>
buffered saline (10 mM, pH=7.4), the microscope slides<br>
were separated, and the hydrogel was removed. The<br>
hydrogel was washed with 100 ml of phosphate buffered<br>
saline (PBS) containirg 1 mM lauryl sulfate sodium salt<br>
and 1 mM EDTA tetrasocium salt for 3 days, the solution<br>
being changed every day, followed by washing with<br>
EtOH/PBS (20/80 by vol., 3 x 100 ml), and finally with<br>
PBS (pH=7.4, 3 x 100 ml). The resulting hydrogel film<br>
was stored in PBS (10 mM, pH=7.4) containing 0.02% wt.<br>
sodium azide and 1 mM EDTA tetrasodium salt.<br>
Effect of glucose and L-sodium lactate on hydrogel<br>
film containing glucose indicator.<br>
The experiment was conducted in a Shimadzu RF-5301<br>
PC spectrofluorimeter equipped with a variable<br>
temperature attachment. Excitation wavelength was set at<br>
370 nm,slits 3/3 nm, low PMT sensitivity, emission was<br>
scanned from 400 to 600 nm. Glucose and L-sodium lactate<br>
concentrations were checked using YSI Model 2300 STAT<br>
plus glucose analyzer.<br>
The hydrogel filn (100 μm thickness, round shape - 8<br>
mm diameter) was mounted in a PMMA cuvette at 45° angle.<br>
Phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH=7.4 containing the<br>
desired amount of glucose, L-sodium lactate, and glucose<br>
with L-sodium lactate were heated to 37 °C in a water bath<br>
and placed in the PMMA cell containing the mounted<br>
hydrogel. After each addition the PMMA cell was allowed<br>
to equilibrate for 45 min at 37°C. Fluorescence intensity<br>
measurements for each glucose/lactate concentration were<br>
conducted on two different samples and an average value<br>
was used in the calibiation curve. Calibration curves<br><br>
(Fluorescence Intensity at 430 nm vs. concentration) were<br>
obtained for glucose L-sodium lactate, and glucose in<br>
the presence of 3 mM L-sodium lactate. The results are<br>
shown in Figure 16.<br>
