				<td>ENCODING MODE CONTROL METHOD AND DECODING MODE<br>
DETERMINING APPARATUS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an encoding mode control method and a decoding mode determining apparatus in a digital cellular radio communication system, as well as a power control method and system that utilize the inventive idea.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In present digital cellular communication systems a speech .encoder rate is chosen at call setup and is fixed throughout the call. This strategy is used in the D-AMPS and GSM systems. However, this strategy gives good performance with respect to channel robustness and speech quality over only a limited range of channel conditions.In CDMA, systems, such as IS-95, there is a variable speech and channel encoder scheme, but the speech and channel coder mode decision for one link is based on speech signal characteristics and is independent of the mode of a return link.It has also been suggested [1] to use dynamically changing encoding modes with different mixes of speech/channel encoding suitable for different radio environments. However, these methods are too slow, since they need to keep signaling overhead as low as possible.References [2, 3] describe systems in which a receiver may request a mode change from a transmitter over a dedicated back channel.It would be desirable to dynamically allocate speech. and channel coder rates depending upon local radio conditions on a frame by frame basis in order to achieve<br>
a close to optimum performance in a larger range of conditions, and to let the coding mode of one link control the allocation of coding mode for the return link.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an encoding mode control method that dynamically adapts the coding rate to prevailing radio conditions on a frame by frame basis and allows at least one party to base its transmission mode decision at least partially on the mode received on the other link.This object is achieved by a method in accordance with claim 1.Another object of the present invention is to provide a decoding mode<br>
determining apparatus that syjnchronizes the receiver 	decoding  mode with Jtie transmitter<br>
encoding mode.<br>
This object is achieved by an apparatus in accordance with claim 14.<br>
A further object is a power control method and system based on these mode switching capabilities.<br>
This object is achieved by a method in accordance with claims 15, 16 and a system in accordance with claims 24, 25.<br>
Briefly, the present invention achieves the above objects by monitoring the local radio environment around the transmitter and dynamically selecting a speech-/channel encoding rate combination suitable for the current radio environment, all combinations having the same total gross bit rate (the total bit rate available for information transfer on a given channel if no channel protection is provided). In a_ preferred embodiment the recejverjrjajjclej£^^<br>
con^jbaii0ns.and~seJectsJbje-m	Finally<br>
the receiver selects the same encoding mode for the return link to the transmitter. This encoding scheme is very fast (frame by frame) and requires no handover.<br>
Furthermore, the coding gain/loss obtained by this mode switching may be utilized for power adjustments that reduce the overall interference level of the communication system.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention will be described with reference to TDMA systems, in particular to the European GSM system. However, it is to be understood that the same principles may be used also for other TDMA systems, such as the American system in accordance with the standards IS-54 and IS-136, as well as FDMA systems and CDMA systems, for example the CDMA system in accordance with the standard IS-95..<br>
The basic feature of the present invention is mode switching. This feature will be described in the next section "MODE SWITCHING". The section "POWER CONTROL" is an example of an important application where this feature is used.<br>
MODE SWITCHING<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the data format of a speech frame in the European GSM system. The speech frame consists of 260 bits of user data (encoded speech). These 260 bits have been divided into three different classes depending on their sensitivity to bit errors. The more sensitive bits are provided with more error protection than the less sensitive bits. The 50 most sensitive bits are protected first with a 3 bit errors detecting code (EDC), and then the resulting 53 bits along with the 132 next most sensitive bits are encoded with an error correcting code (ECC) up to 378 bits. The remaining 78 bits are transmitted without channel protection of any kind. Thus, the final code word representing the original speech frame will consist of 456 bits.At the receiver the decoder extracts the 78 unprotected bits and performs error correction on the remaining 378 bits. Errors among the 78 unprotected bits are neither detected nor corrected. Errors among the 132 channel protected bits are rare<br>
due to the error correction, but when they occur they are impossible to detect. Finally, errors in the 50 most sensitive bits are likely to be detected by the 3 bit error detection code.<br>
As illustrated in figure 2 this channel_encoding scheme for a GSM full rate channel implies that a certain amount of redundancy is added to the user data that is to be transmitted. However, within the same total available gross bit rate it is possible to use other proportions between user data and redundancy. Thus, if radio conditions are good it may be possible to reduce the data protection and thereby the redundancy. Since the total gross bit rate is assumed to be constant, this means that more bits are available for user data. This is illustrated by the data block in the middle of figure 2. Since more user data bits now are available, a more accurate speech encoding algorithm (that requires more bits) may be used, thereby increasing the quality of the speech decoded at the receiver. On the other hand, if the radio conditions are poor it may be necessary to increase the data protection. This leads to an increase in the number of redundant bits, and therefore to a reduction of the number of bits used for speech encoding. In this case a less accurate speech encoding method has to be used. A data block representing such a more protected mode is shown at the bottom of figure 2. The advantage of such a mode is that the added data protection increases the probability of correctly receiving and decoding the encoded speech. The argument for this is that it is preferable to correctly receive speech encoded with somewhat lower accuracy than to incorrectly receive speech encoded with higher accuracy. The perceived speech quality at the receiver will still be better in the first mentioned case.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates how mode switching in accordance with the present invention improves performance. The curve denoted MODE 1 represents the characteristics of a mode with high quality speech encoding and low redundancy. This mode gives good perceived speech quality at the receiver when the radio conditions are good. As the radio conditions degrade the perceived speech quality will be reduced due to frequently occurring bit errors. Here it would be better to use MODE 2, which uses a more compact speech coding algorithm, but protects the transmitted bits better from errors caused by the channel. As the radio conditions degrade further, the speech<br>
encoding algorithm is once again changed to MODE 3, which produces few user data bits and protects them even better against the deteriorating channel. Thus, if mode switching is used the optimum portions of the curves representing MODE 1, MODE 2 and MODE 3 may be used, as indicated by the thick solid line in figure 3.<br>
From the above discussion it is clear that mode switching would be a desirable feature of a cellular radio communication system. However, before this feature can be implemented it is necessary to find a way to synchronize the encoder in the transmitter with the decoder in the receiver. In other words, the receiver must knovy which mode to_decode after a mode._switch in transsmitter. Furthermore, it is usually desirable to have the receiver changed to the same encoding mode on the return link from the receiver to the transmitter (one reason for this is that the path loss is the same in both directions). Methods for such a mode synchronization will now be described with reference to figures 4-9.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a typical scenario. A base station BS transmits speech data to a mobile MS over a first radio link. Mobile MS transmits speech data back to base station BS over a second radio link. Base station BS continuously monitors the local radio environment around the station. This radio environment may be effected by, for example, propagation fading, shadow fading, Rayleigh fading, interference situations, system load and/or received signal strength. In the GSM system a base station (and also the mobile station) has access to measurements like the RxQual and RxLev parameters, which estimate the received bit error probability and received signal strength, respectively. Based on one or several of such parameters base station BS may form a measure to decide which encoding mode to use on the first radio link. Base station BS instructs the speech encoder to switch to the corresponding speech encoding mode and also instructs the channel encoder to switch to the corresponding channel encoding mode. Here it is assumed that the speech encoder is capable of handling different encoding rates, i. e. a variable rate encoder. Alternatively it may comprise an embedded encoder (see [4, 5]), such that the channel encoder may remove information from a fixed rate speech encoded data stream for obtaining different speech encoding modes.<br>
Mobile station MS receives the transmitted code word, which may be corrupted by the first radio link. In order to be able to perform proper speech decoding at mobile station MS, the channel decoder has to deliver proper user data to the speech decoder. Thus, the receiver has to decide which mode actually was used by base station BS. This can be done in several ways.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates a preferred embodiment of a coding mode identification method. In this method the (possibly corrupted) received code word is channel decoded in every possible mode 1,..., N by performing the usual decoding steps for each respective mode. This step is represented by block 12. The result is N estimates of the onginany transmitted user data, one estimate for each mode.<br>
In the next step these estimates are used for channel encoding in block 14. The purpose of this channel encoding is to produce code word estimates corresponding to each user data estimate. These code word estimates are used in a mode decision represented by block 16. This mode decision is based on a comparison of each code word estimate with the actually received- code word. The code word estimate that best matches (for example, has the fewest differing bits) the received code word is considered to be the correct code word and the corresponding user data estimate is chosen by a switch SW and transferred to the speech decoder. The speech decoder may switch to the corresponding speech decoding mode by measuring the length of the received user data. As an alternative block 16 may also control the speech decoding mode. When mobile station MS has determined the received mode it may be synchronized with base station BS by switching to the same encoding mode on the second radio link.<br>
Blocks 12, 14 and 16 in fig. 5 are preferably implemented by one or several micro processors or micro/signal processor combinations.<br>
Error protection (detection and/or correction) schemes may also be cascaded in any number of steps.<br>
The method in accordance with the present invention is summarized in the flow chart in figure 6. In step 110 base station BS determines the local radio environment. In step 120 it selects an encoding mode compatible with that environment. In step 130 it transmits to the mobile station in the selected encoding mode. In step 140 mobile<br>
•station MS determines the received encoding mode, for example in accordance with the method described with reference to figure 5. In step 150 mobile station MS decodes received data using a decoding mode corresponding to the received encoding mode. In step 160 it selects an encoding mode for the second radio link to base station BS based on the previous mode decision. Usually mobile station MS will use the same mode on the second radio link as base station BS used on the first radio link. Finally, in step 170 mobile station MS will transmit in the selected encoding mode on the second radio link.<br>
Figure 7 shows a flow chart of a preferred embodiment of mode identification step 140 in figure 6. This method corresponds to the method illustrated in figure 5, but in this case only three modes will be examined at the receiving end, namely the mode received in the previous frame (steps 210, 220), the neighbor mode having less channel protection (steps 230,240) and the neighbor mode having more channel protection (steps 250, 260). The mode giving the best match is selected (step 270). This embodiment reduces the workload of the system by reducing the number of modes that have to be trial decoded and also reduces the number of mode changes.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates a more elaborate mode identification method. As in the method in accordance with figure 7 only three modes are examined (steps 310-360). However, in this case the received frame is not only channel decoded, but also speech decoded__in all three modes. In step 370 the three decoded speech frames are compared with the previous speech frame, and the decoding mode giving the best match is selected as the current mode. Here use is made of the fact that speech signals are strongly correlated in time. For example, the spectral characteristics of the previous frame may be compared to the spectral characteristics of the three decoded speech frames.<br>
A less complex mode identification method comprises using the error detection code bits to decide which mode to use. If the error detection bits indicate that there are no errors for one of the modes, this is probably the correct mode.<br>
In the above examples the received mode has been detected by trial decoding of several mode candidates. Another possibility would be to convey the mode information directly in a mode code word separated from the data code word, either in the same transmitted frame or in a separate information channel. Mobile station MS would then be able to decide which mode to use by decoding the mode code word first and then only channel and speech decode the indicated mode. A typical format of such a transmitted code word is illustrated in figure 9. This method has the advantage of being less complex, but also has the "disadvantage of taking up part of the available band width for signalling purposes.<br>
In the above description it has been assumed that base station BS bases its mode decision on measured characteristics of the local radio environment and that mobile station MS switches to the same mode. In this case base station BS is considered the master and mobile station MS is considered the slave. This seems reasonable,<br>
&gt;<br>
since the base station usually has access to a lot of system and radio statistics, and it also leaves the implementation of the mobile station quite simple, since no measurements for mode switch purposes have to be made in the mobile station.<br>
However, in a more symmetrical system it is possible to let both base station and mobile station base their transmit mode decisions partly on the measured local radio environment and partly on the received mode. Thus, in such an embodiment these two parameters are weighted together for a final decision. Also in this embodiment it is possible to let the base station be the master by giving more weight to the radio environment measurements at the base station than at the mobile station.<br>
Some of the merits of the invention are summarized below:<br>
•  It gives better overallperceived speech quality over a larger range of radio<br>
art.<br><br>
•	It gives a fast implicit way of requesting mode changes that does not necessarily<br>
require transmission of a special mode message. A symmetry is possible between<br>
base and mobile station giving roughly the same perceived speech quality for both<br>
parties.<br>
•	It gives the possibility of letting only one party decide upon mode changes.<br>
•	It gives the possibility of having the same modes in both directions in spite of the<br>
fact that modes are changed dynamically.<br>
•	In GSM neither the base station controller (BSC) nor the mobile switching centre<br>
(MSC) need to participate in the mode decision (no handover required).<br>
•	In case of an embedded encoder neither the BSC nor the MSC have to be<br>
informed of the actual mode changes.<br>
POWER CONTROL<br>
An important feature of the above described mode switching methods is that a coding gain/loss is obtained by the different encoding modes. This coding gain/loss may be used to adjust the output power of a transmitter, as will now be described.<br>
Fig. 10 is a diagram illustrating the concept of output power adjustment. Assume that the radio conditions have been such that MODE 1 has previously been used for encoding. Furthermore, assume that the radio conditions have now become worse and may be described by a C/l level CQ1. If MODE 1 is maintained this would give a speech quality level SQL It is assumed that level SQ1 is still an acceptable level. Thus, it is actually not absolutely necessary to switch to MODE 2, although this mode would give a more optimal speech quality. However, the same speech quality SQ1 may also be obtained by switching to MODE 2 and using the resulting coding gain to reduce the transmitting power, as indicated by the arrow. The reduced output power will reduce C/l to CQ2, but the obtained speech quality will still be SQ1 since the new encoding mode is MODE 2. If every transmitter in the TDMA system uses the coding gain obtained by mode switching to decrease output power the overall C/l level will increase, thereby improving the performance of the whole system.<br>
Fig. 11 is a diagram illustrating mode switching combined with output power adjustment in the reverse situation, namely when the radio conditions improve. Assume that MODE 2 has been used at a C/l level CQ2 and has given speech quality SQ1. Furthermore, assume that radio conditions have now improved to C/l level CQ3. If the mode remained the same the speech quality would slide up the curve MODE 2 to level SQ3. A mode switch to MODE 1 would only give the original speech quality SQ1 at C/l level CQ4. However, if this mode switch is combined with a slight output power increase (indicated by the small arrow) C/l would increase from CQ4 to CQ5 and the speech quality would slide up the curve MODE 1 to the same level SQ3. However, note that in this case speech quality SQ3 may be obtained at the lower C/l level CQ5 rather than the higher level CQ3 that is associated with MODE 2.<br>
Fig. 12 is a diagram illustrating fine tuning of output power within the same encoding mode. As before SQ1 is considered an acceptable speech quality level lying on curve MODE 2 and being associated with C/l level CQ2. If radio conditions improve slightly the C/l level will increase slightly. If the output power is not changed the speech quality would slide up the curve MODE 2 to give a slightly better perceived speech quality. However, speech quality level SQ1 was already acceptable, which implies that the C/l increase may be used to slightly decrease output power instead, thereby contributing to better system performance. Thus, the output power may be reduced to bring the speech quality level back to SQL Similarly, if the radio conditions become slightly worse, so that the speech quality would slide down the curve MODE 2, the output power may be slightly increased to compensate for the reduced C/l level. These two cases are represented by the curved arrow in fig. 12.<br>
Fig. 13 is another diagram illustrating fine tuning of speech quality within the same encoding mode. As in fig. 12 speech quality SQ1 is obtained in MODE 2 at C/l level CQ2. Furthermore it is assumed that the transmitter transmits at its minimum output power. Thus, if radio conditions improve to a C/l level CQ6 it is not possible to decrease the output power further as in fig. 12. Instead the output power is kept constant, which will result in an improved speech quality level SQ6 by letting the speech quality slide up the curve MODE 2.<br>
Fig. 14 is a diagram qualitatively illustrating the benefits of combined mode switching and output power adjustment. Generally speaking the effect of combined mode switching and output power adjustment, as compared to only mode switching, is to somewhat decrease the speech quality for the less channel protected rpodes and to increase the speech quality of the more channel protected modes, thus giving a more even speech quality over a large range of C/l levels.<br>
Fig. 15 is a simplified block diagram of a power control system operating in accordance with the described principles. In order to simplify the description only blocks that are essential to the present invention have been included.<br>
A speech encoder 30 receives and encodes speech samples. Speech encoder 30 may be a variable rate or embedded speech encoder (a variable rate encoder may also be implemented by switching between several fixed rate encoders). Encoded speech is forwarded to a channel encoder 32, which has a channel encoding mode corresponding to each speech encoder mode. The output from channel encoder 32 fits into a constant gross bit rate.<br>
A power control unit 34 controls channel encoder 32 to operate in the proper channel encoding mode. Power control unit 34 also controls speech encoder 30 if it is of variable rate type (this is indicated by the dashed line between power control unit 34 and speech encoder 30). If speech, encoder 30 is of the embedded type it is not necessary to control it, since it will always deliver a constant rate bit stream. In this case channel encoder will truncate necessary bits as required by the selected channel encoding mode. Such an embodiment is especially useful if power control unit 34 and speech encoder 30 are in different locations in the TDMA system and fast communication between them is difficult.<br>
Blocks 30, 32. 34 are tvpicallv implemented as micro or micro/siqnal processor combinations.<br>
Power control unit 34 also controls a power adjustment unit 36, typically an adjustable power amplifier, to increase or decrease the output power from the transmitter depending on the selected encoding mode.<br>
The mode decision in power control unit 34 is based on local information L, such as measured signal strength, C/l, traffic or system load, etc. Optionally an inband control channel, such as the above described CTRL channel, may be used as a back channel to convey quality information, such as the decoded bit error rate, from the receiving end back to the transmitting end.<br>
Basic power adjustments may be associated with each mode. These basic adjustments may be pre-calculated off-line and stored for later use. These basic power adjustments may be performed when there are drastic changes in radio conditions, for example due to shadowing. When there are only small changes in radio conditions only fine tuning of the output power around corresponding basic power levels is performed. This fine tuning adapts the output power to keep the received speech quality at an essentially constant level in the current mode.<br>
After transmission over the radio channel 38 the received signal is decoded in channel decoder 40 and speech decoder 42. An optional quality check unit 44 receives quality information from channel decoder 40 and speech decoder 42. Locally measured information L (signal strength, C/l, etc.) may also be forwarded to quality check unit 44. After evaluation a speech quality measure, for example an estimated decoded bit error rate, is transmitted back to the transmitter on the back channel CTRL.<br>
Fig. 16 is a flow chart illustrating an example of the power control method. The power adjustments are radio environment controlled as described above. Step 50 determines the current radio environment. Step 52 determines whether a mode change is required. If a change is necessary step 54 switches to another speech encoding mode and step 56 switches to a corresponding channel encoding mode. Thereafter step 58 performs the corresponding power adjustment. If no mode change is necessary in step 52, the old speech and channel encoding modes are used in steps<br>
60 and 62, respectively. Although the mode has not changed a fine adjustment of the output power may still be performed as described above. In step 68 the current mode is indicated. Step 70 gets the next speech frame and returns to the beginning of the flow chart.<br>
In the above description it has not been specified whether the transmitter is a base station or a mobile station. Since both stations include both a transmitter and a receiver this means that the system may be symmetrical. However, typically more information is available in one of the stations, usually the base station, which implies that it is natural to let this station control both its own as well as the other station's transmission mode.<br>
The described power control method leads to several advantages, namely:<br>
•	A better TDMA system capacity due to the reduced interference level.<br>
•	Signaling may be very fast, involving only the base station and the mobile station<br>
and not the base station controller (GSM) or mobile services switching center (no<br>
handover required).<br>
•	The mode control algorithms and settings may vary between cellular operators,<br>
thus giving different service characteristics. This introduces a tool for tailoring the<br>
offered services towards different segments of the market.<br>
It will be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications and changes may be made to the present invention without departure from the spirit and scope thereof, which is defined by the appended claims.<br>

We Claim:<br>
1.	A power control method in a digital cellular radio communication system<br>
comprising a transmitting end and a receiving end said digital cellular radio<br>
communication system having traffic channels, at least some of which are<br>
associated with a set of speech/channel encoding modes, each mode having a<br>
different mix of speech encoder bit rate and data protection bit rate but the same<br>
total available gross bit rate, characterized by the following steps at the<br>
transmitting end of a link using such a traffic channel:<br>
replacing a mode allocated to said channel by another mode in a said set having higher (lower) data protection bit rate and lower (higher) speech encoder bit rate if radio conditions become worse (better) and/or traffic load in the system increases (decreases);<br>
identifying the selected encoding mode in a mode indicator field transmitted together with the encoded bits; and<br>
reducing (increasing) the output power of said traffic channel to a lower (higher) level such that an estimated decoded speech quality measure at the receiving end of said link is essentially the same as before the change in radio conditions and/or traffic load.<br>
2.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the following steps at the receiving<br>
end of said link:<br>
decoding the received signal in several decoding modes corresponding to said speech/channel encoding modes; and<br>
selecting the decoding mode that is most likely to give the best decoded speech quality as the current decoding mode.<br>
3.	The method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the following steps are performed at<br>
the receiving end of said link:<br>
estimating said decoded speech quality measure;<br>
requesting a mode change to the transmitting end on a return link from the receiving end to the transmitting end if the estimated decoded speech quality measure has changed more than a predetermined amount; and<br>
changing to a decoding mode that corresponds to the new received speech/channel encoding mode.<br>
4.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the following steps are performed at<br>
the transmitting end of said link:<br>
estimating said decoded speech quality measure on a return link from the receiving end to the transmitting end;<br>
using the estimated decoded speech quality measure at the transmitting end as a measure of the estimated decoded speech quality at the receiving end; and<br>
changing encoding mode if the estimated decoded speech quality measure at the transmitting end has changed more than a predetermined amount.<br>
5.	The method as claimed in claim 3, wherein a requested mode field is transmitted in said return channel to identify the encoding mode that is requested by the receiving end.<br>
6.	The method as claimed in any of the preceding claims 1 - 5 wherein only one of the receiving end and transmitting end is allowed to control mode switching.<br>
7.	The method as claimed in claim 6, wherein only a base station is allowed to control mode switching.<br>
8.	The method as claimed in any of the preceding claims 1-7, wherein the estimated decoding speech quality measure comprises an estimated decoded bit error rate.<br>
9.	The method as claimed in any of the preceding claims 1-8, wherein said digital cellular radio communication system being a TDMA system.<br>
10.	A power control system in a digital cellular radio communication system<br>
comprising a transmitting end and a receiving end said digital cellular radio<br>
communication system having traffic channels, at least some of which are<br>
associated with a set of speech/channel encoding modes, each mode having a<br>
different mix of speech encoder bit rate and data protection bit rate but the same<br>
total available gross bit rate, characterized by the following elements at the<br>
transmitting end of a link using such a traffic channel:<br>
means (34) for replacing a mode allocated to said channel by another mode in said set having higher (lower) data protection bit rate and lower (higher) speech encoder bit rate if radio conditions become worse (better) and/or traffic load in the system increased (decreases);<br>
means (34) for including a mode indicator identifying the selected encoding mode in the bit stream that contains the encoded bits; and<br>
means (36) for reducing (increasing) the output power of said traffic channel to a lower (higher) level such that an estimated decoded speech quality measure at the receiving end of said link is essentially the same as before the change in radio conditions and/or traffic load.<br>
11.	A power control system in a digital cellular radio communication system as<br>
claimed in claim 10, wherein the receiving end comprises:<br>
means (12) for decoding the received signal in several decoding modes corresponding to said speech/channel encoding modes; and<br>
means (14, 16) for selecting, the decoding mode that is most likely to give the best decoded speech quality as the current decoding mode.<br>
12.	The power control system as claimed in claim 10 or 11, wherein said digital<br>
cellular radio communication system being a TDMA system.<br>
13.	A power control method in a digital cellular radio communication system<br>
substantially as herein described with the reference to and as illustrated in the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
14.	A power control system in a digital cellular radio communication system substantially as herein described with reference to and as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</td>
