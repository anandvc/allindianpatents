The following Specification particularly describes the invention and the<br>
manner in which it is to be performed<br>
1<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention, in general, relates to modification of character placement on keypad of wireless terminals to optimize the typing speed in Wireless terminals. More particularly, the present invention relates to modified keypad to optimize the typing speed in wireless terminals.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Due to limited number of keys on keypad of Wireless terminals, three or four alphabets (also referred to as letters) are placed on each key. Letters are arranged in alphabetical order on keys.<br>
1)	To get the display of any letter, the number of key presses required varies depending upon position of letter on the key. For example in the current approach, if letter’S’ is required, the key with display “7 (pqrs)” needs to be pressed 4 times to get display of ‘S’<br>
2)	The desired consecutive letters are on the same key, there will be a waiting period after typing first letter and before typing the next letter, which introduces delay. For example if the desired word is “SPEED”, letter ‘S’ which is on key “7(pqrs)” needs to be typed first and letter ‘P’ which resides on the same key needs to be typed next. Since letters ‘S’ and ‘P’ are on the same key, there will be some delay in typing ‘P’<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
Existing approach has following disadvantages: -<br>
1.	More frequently used letters might be requiring more number of key presses based on its position in keypad.<br>
2.	Introduces delay in typing and requires more number of key presses.<br>
3.	Waiting for a time out to get the letters successively on the same key<br>
2<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the current invention, letter placement on keypad is modified to reduce the number of key presses and to increase typing speed by incorporating the following methods:<br>
1.	Position of a letter on keypad is decided based on the frequency of its occurrence.<br>
2.	More frequently occurring letter pairs (like t-h, h-e, a-n etc.,) will be placed on different keys.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a modified keypad to optimize the typing speed in wireless terminals wherein the position of a letter on keypad is based on the frequency of the said letter occurrence in the English language where more frequently occurring letter pairs are placed on different keys.<br>
To optimize the letter placement on keys of a keypad, letters are placed to avoid the waiting period to type the second letter after typing the previous letter. The first sets of letters are placed in first position on available keys of the keypad. The number of letters in the first set is equal to the number of available keys of the keypad. The second, third and fourth sets of letters are placed in second, third and fourth position on the keys of the keypad. The number of letters in second, third and fourth set is not more than the maximum number of available keys of the keypad. After placing all the letters based on their frequency of occurrence, a check is done to find if any of the letters on any keys have high letter pair frequency. If any of the letters on any keys have high letter pair frequency then a different key on which any one letter among the letter pair is placed is determined. Determination of the different key on which any one letter among the letter pair is placed is done in such a way that the letter which is transferred to the new different key has minimum letter pair frequency with the letters already in the different key.<br>
The above procedure illustrates a sequence of steps for optimized letter<br>
3<br><br>
placement on keypad. There can be different sequence of performing these steps to achieve the same purpose.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
4<br><br>
In the current invention, the keypad is modified by altering the position of letters on keys based on frequency of occurrence. Table 1.1 gives a list of average frequencies for letters in the English language (Ref [1]). This is the standard table most frequently used in cryptanalysis and other code breaking techniques. (Note: The frequencies given in this table are average frequencies.)<br>
Table 1.1 indicates that the average frequency of occurrence of ‘E’ is 12.702%, which means ‘E’ occurs approximately 13 times for every 100 characters in English. In the current keypad layout, character (E’ is in second position on a key, which means approximately 26 key presses are required (13*2) to type the 13 ‘E’s that may occur in an English statements of about 100 characters. If the character ‘E’ is placed in first position on a key, number of key presses can be reduced from 26 to 13. Similarly for character T which has an approximate frequency of 6.966% (i.e. 7%) is in third position on a key. Number of key presses required will be 21 (7 * 3). If it is placed in first position on a key, the number of key presses can be reduced from 21 to 7. Hence, more frequently used characters are placed in first position on available keys of a keypad and then the next frequently used characters are placed in the second position on the keys and soon.<br>
Next step to optimize the letter placement on keypad to reduce the number of key presses and hence to increase the typing speed is to place the more frequently occurring letter pairs on different keys. Table 1.2 shows alphabet orderings in order of likelihood to follow each letter. Second column in each row shows the ordering of letters based on their frequency of occurrence, which are likelihood to follow the letter in the first column of the table.<br>
For example, letter ‘A’ which is followed by<br>
‘NRTSLDIYCVMKBGPUFWXZHJAEOQ’. It denotes that most frequently occurring letter after ‘A’ is ‘N’ Next more frequently occurring letter after ‘A’ is ‘R’ and so on.<br>
5<br><br>
Table 1.2 lists the orderings of letter pairs, which is derived from Mayzner and Tresselt’s table (Ref [2]) which was compiled from 100 samples of 200 words. Each sample was drawn at random from a variety of sources, including newspapers, magazines, and fiction and non-fiction books. This table is widely used in cryptanalysis and other code breaking techniques.<br>
Based on this data (i.e. table 1.2), letters on keys of a keypad can be placed appropriately to avoid the waiting period to type the second letter after typing the previous letter. For example: If the word “ONLINE” has to be typed, in the current keypad layout, key “6(mno)” has to be pressed 3 times to get display of first letter ‘O’ Next letter ‘N’ cannot be immediately typed since ‘N’ is on the same key as that of letter ‘O’ and hence have to wait for certain duration to use the same key consecutively. If the letters ‘O’ and ‘N’ are placed on different keys in appropriate positions based on the letter frequency, the waiting period can be avoided. (Note: It might not be possible to avoid waiting period for all letter pairs. But for most frequently occurring letter pairs, this method can be utilized.)<br>
In the examples given above, we used the statistics available for the English language. Same methods can be applied for any language and hence this method is language independent.<br>
The above-explained procedure is illustrated with an example.<br>
1)	By referring to Table 1.1, we know that frequently occurring letters in decrementing order are e,t, a,o,I,n,s,r,d,l,c,u,m,w,f,g,y,p,b,k,j,x,q,z. First 8 letters can be placed in first position on available keys of the keypad (Refer Figure 2).<br>
2)	Place the next 8 letters in second position on the keys and the remaining letters in 3rd and 4th position of the keys as shown in Figure 2.<br>
6<br><br>
3)	After placing all the letters based on their frequency of occurrence, next step is to check if any of the letters on any keys have high letter pair frequency.<br>
4)	From Figure 2, we can find that few letters with high letter pair frequency like letter pair “ER” are placed on same key “2(ERG)” Hence we need to remove either “E” or “R” from key “2(ERG)”<br>
5)	If “R” has to be moved, then appropriate key on which it can be placed in second position should be determined. When “R” is placed on some key, it should not have high letter pair frequency with other letters on that key or the second letter from that key which will be placed on key “2(ERG)” should not have high letter pair frequency with “E” or “G”.<br>
6)	An appropriate key on which “R” can be placed is “6(IUV)”.   “R” does not have high letter pair frequency with “I” or “V”. Letter “U” which should be moved onto key “2(ERG)” does not have high letter pair frequency with “E” or “G”. Hence, the letter “R” and “U” can be interchanged as shown in Figure 3.<br>
7)	Similarly other letters like “GE” “PL” etc., which have high letter pair frequency and are placed on same key, should be disunited.<br>
Table 1.1    Average frequency of occurrence of Individual letters in English language<br>
By letter	By frequency<br>
Letter Frequency Letter Frequency<br>
A	0.08167	e	0.12702 <br>
B	0.01492	t	0.09056<br>
C	0.02782	a	0.08167<br>

It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from.<br>
