Description<br>
Switching arrangement and method for operating an<br>
electromagnetic relay<br>
The invention relates to a switching arrangement for operating<br>
an electromagnetic relay which has a relay coil and relay<br>
contacts, in which two switching devices are arranged in a<br>
current path with the relay coil such that a first switching<br>
device is connected to a first connection of the relay coil and<br>
a second switching device is connected to a second connection<br>
of the relay coil; and a control device is provided, which is<br>
designed to close both switching devices in order to produce a<br>
current flow through the relay coil, and to open both switching<br>
devices in order to interrupt a current flow through the relay<br>
coil. The invention relates furthermore to a corresponding<br>
method for operating an electromagnetic relay.<br>
Electromagnetic relays are frequently used in order to carry<br>
out controlled switching operations in electrical appliances.<br>
Electromagnetic relays normally comprise a relay coil and at<br>
least one pair of electrical relay contacts. When an electric<br>
current is applied to the relay coil, then a magnetic field is<br>
produced around the relay coil as a result of which - in the<br>
case of a self-opening relay - the relay contacts are closed,<br>
such that current can flow via the relay contacts. When the<br>
current flowing through the relay coil is interrupted again,<br>
then the moving part of the relay contacts is moved back to its<br>
original position, for example by means of a spring device,<br>
thus opening the relay contacts and interrupting the current<br>
flow via them. In the case of self-closing relays, the contacts<br>
are<br><br>
closed when no current is flowing through the relay coil, and<br>
they are opened when current is flowing through it.<br>
Electromagnetic relays are normally used where the aim is to<br>
switch a comparatively high current on or off in a switching<br>
circuit, by means of a comparatively low current from a control<br>
circuit. In this case, the electromagnetic relay provides<br>
galvanic decoupling between the control circuit and the<br>
switching circuit.<br>
Electromagnetic relays are used, for example, in electrical<br>
protective devices for monitoring electrical power supply<br>
systems in order to trip an electrical circuit breaker, by<br>
closing the relay contacts of a so-called "command relay", thus<br>
interrupting the fault current, in the event of a fault (for<br>
example a short circuit) in the electrical power supply system.<br>
When electromagnetic relays are used in safety-relevant areas<br>
such as these, it is of very major importance to reliably<br>
prevent inadvertent switching on or off, in order on the one<br>
hand to ensure a high level of safety in the event of a fault,<br>
and on the other hand to avoid costly spurious tripping.<br>
In order to monitor the state of the relay contacts, it is<br>
first of all possible to feed back their actual state, that is<br>
to say whether they are open or closed, to the control device<br>
of the relay coil. If there is a difference between the nominal<br>
state and the actual state of the relay contacts, a fault in<br>
the relay operation is deduced.<br><br>
However, such monitoring is comparatively complex because, in<br>
this case, the galvanic decoupling achieved by the relay<br>
between the control circuit and the switching circuit must be<br>
exceeded in order to feed back information relating to the<br>
state of the relay contacts. Furthermore, in this case, a fault<br>
can be identified only after it has already occurred, that is<br>
to say the relay contacts have already assumed an undesirable<br>
state. Predictive monitoring is impossible.<br>
Efforts have therefore been made to make the control circuit<br>
for the relay coil as fail-safe as possible. By way of example,<br>
faults in switching devices can occur by melting of the<br>
switching contents as a result of an excessively high switching<br>
power or excessively high temperature, as a result of which the<br>
corresponding switching device is permanently short-circuited.<br>
In the case of semiconductor switches, for example transistors,<br>
a similar effect is known as so-called "breakdown" of the<br>
connections of the semiconductor switch. It is likewise<br>
possible, both in the case of mechanical switching devices and<br>
semiconductor switches, for the switches to permanently block<br>
the current flow because of an internal fault. Furthermore, a<br>
fault can also occur in the relay coil itself, as a result of<br>
which, for example, current can no longer flow through the<br>
relay coil because of a broken line, for example.<br>
In order to design the control circuit to be as fail-safe as<br>
possible, the relay coil is operated not only via a single<br>
switching device, which may be susceptible to faults, but<br>
instead of this via two switching devices located in the<br>
current path of the relay coil. The relay coil is operated only<br>
when both switching devices are closed at the same time. As<br>
soon as one<br><br>
switching device has opened, the current flow through the<br>
relay coil is interrupted. This<br><br><br>
achieves relatively high operating reliability with respect to<br>
inadvertent activation of the relay coil, since a faulty,<br>
permanently short-circuited switching device cannot on its own<br>
undesirably activate the relay coil. By way of example, one<br>
such switching device is known from German patent specification<br>
DE 44 09 287 C1, which discloses a relay coil which has two<br>
switching devices in the form of transistors located in one<br>
current path.<br>
The invention is based on the object of specifying a switching<br>
arrangement and a method of the type mentioned initially, which<br>
allow predictive checking of the relay coil and of both<br>
switching devices for the possible occurrence of faults.<br>
With regard to the switching device, this object is achieved by<br>
a switching arrangement of the type mentioned initially, in<br>
which the control device is designed to transmit test signals<br>
to the first and the second switching devices, wherein the test<br>
signals are created such that they do not influence the<br>
instantaneous state of the relay contacts; a measurement<br>
voltage is applied to one input of a conversion device and is<br>
tapped off between one connection of the relay coil and one of<br>
the switching devices, wherein the conversion device is<br>
designed to convert the measurement voltage to a binary<br>
response signal; and a monitoring device is connected to one<br>
output of the conversion device, evaluates the profile of the<br>
binary response signal during the transmission of the test<br>
signal by the control device, and indicates a fault in the<br>
relay coil or one of the switching devices if the profile of<br>
the binary response signal differs from an expected profile.<br><br>
The particular advantage of the switching arrangement according<br>
to the invention is that the correct operation of the relay-<br>
coil and of the two switching devices can be checked easily<br>
even before the relay has carried out a faulty switching<br>
operation. This makes it possible to check the relay coil and<br>
the two switching devices for possible faults, so to speak<br>
predictively. In this context, "predictively" therefore means<br>
that the serviceability can be checked without having to carry<br>
out a switching operation of the relay contacts. To do this,<br>
just a single measurement signal in the form of the measurement<br>
voltage is tapped off and monitored, in a comparatively simple<br>
manner. A malfunction of the two switching devices or of the<br>
relay coil can advantageously be achieved as the relay, both in<br>
the switched-on state and in the switched-off state, by<br>
applying test signals to the two switching devices which,<br>
however, do not influence the instantaneous state of the relay<br>
contacts.<br>
If a fault is discovered in one of the switching devices or in<br>
the relay coil during the monitoring, then an operator of an<br>
appliance in which the electromagnetic relay is installed - for<br>
example the operator of a corresponding electrical protective<br>
device - can be informed of this by a fault message relating to<br>
this, as a result of which he can initiate replacement of the<br>
assembly fitted with the relay and its control circuit.<br>
One advantageous embodiment provides that the two switching<br>
devices are semiconductor switches, in particular transistors.<br>
Semiconductor switches such as these can be switched on and off<br>
particularly quickly and with low switching power levels.<br><br>
Furthermore, a further advantageous embodiment of the switching<br>
arrangement according to the invention provides that one<br>
connection of in each case one damping capacitor is arranged in<br>
the current path of the relay coil, in each case between one<br>
connection of the relay coil and one switching device. The<br>
damping effect of the capacitors allows the profile of the<br>
measurement voltage and therefore the profile of the binary<br>
response signal to be extended in time, so as to allow<br>
particularly simple evaluation.<br>
Furthermore, a further advantageous embodiment of the switch<br>
arrangement according to the invention provides that the<br>
conversion device has a voltage divider which is arranged in<br>
parallel with the current path of the relay coil, and to whose<br>
voltage divider tap a measurement voltage is on the one hand<br>
applied, and on the other hand the measurement voltage is<br>
supplied to an operating input of a further switching device in<br>
order to obtain the binary signal. This allows a binary<br>
response signal to be produced from the measurement voltage,<br>
without a high level of circuit complexity.<br>
By way of example, the further switching device may be a<br>
semiconductor switch, in particular a MOSFET (metal oxide<br>
semiconductor field effect transistor). Field effect<br>
transistors are operated by voltages and are therefore, in the<br>
present case, particularly highly suitable for converting the<br>
measurement voltage to a binary response signal.<br>
With regard to the method, the abovementioned object is<br>
achieved by a method for operating an electromagnetic relay<br>
which has a relay coil and relay contacts, in which two<br>
switching devices are closed in order to produce a current flow<br>
through the relay coil, and two switching devices are opened in<br>
order to interrupt a current flow through the relay coil,<br><br>
wherein the switching devices are arranged in a current path<br>
with the relay coil such that the first switching device is<br>
connected to a first connection of the relay coil, and the<br>
second switching device is connected to a second connection of<br>
the relay coil, wherein, in the case of the method according to<br>
the invention, the control device emits test signals to the two<br>
switching devices, which test signals do not influence the<br>
instantaneous state of the relay contacts; a measurement<br>
voltage is tapped off between one connection of the relay coil<br>
and one of the switching devices; the measurement voltage is<br>
converted to a binary response signal; and a fault in the relay<br>
coil or in one of the two switching devices is indicated if the<br>
profile of the binary response signal differs from an expected<br>
profile. The described method advantageously allows predictive<br>
checking of the control circuit of the electromagnetic relay.<br>
It is furthermore considered to be an advantageous development<br>
for test signals which are shorter than the response time of<br>
the relay to be emitted to the two switching devices when the<br>
relay contacts are in the open state. In this case, the<br>
response time of the relay is considered to be that time which<br>
a magnetic field produced by the relay coil requires to react<br>
to a sudden change in a voltage applied to the relay coil by a<br>
change in the switching state of the relay contacts.<br>
For example, if the relay coil is switched off when a magnetic<br>
field has been formed completely, then the magnetic field<br>
decays only after a certain time delay. The state of the relay<br>
contacts does not change until the magnetic field strength is<br>
no longer adequate to<br><br>
hold the relay contacts in their previous position. If the<br>
relay coil is switched on again<br><br>
in good time, then the magnetic field builds up again, and the<br>
relay contacts remain in their state, without any change.<br>
In the converse situation, a voltage is suddenly applied to the<br>
relay coil, through which no current was previously flowing, a<br>
magnetic field of the relay coil requires a certain time period<br>
before its magnetic field strength is sufficient to operate the<br>
relay contacts. If the current flow is interrupted again in<br>
good time, then the- state of the relay contacts does not<br>
change.<br>
The time duration of the test signals must therefore be created<br>
such that they are sufficiently short to ensure that no change<br>
in the state of the relay contacts occurs, because of the<br>
inertia of the building-up or decaying magnetic field of the<br>
relay coil.<br>
The method according to the invention can be used to check the<br>
two switching devices and the relay coil for possible faults<br>
both when no current is flowing through the relay coil and when<br>
current is flowing through the relay coil.<br>
Specifically, for example, a check is carried out when no<br>
current is flowing through the relay coil and with the<br>
measurement voltage being tapped off between the second<br>
connection of the relay coil and the second switching device,<br>
by test signals being emitted in the following sequence:<br>
a)	a test signal is emitted to the second switching<br>
device;<br>
b)	no test signal is emitted during a signal pause;<br><br><br>
c) a test signal is emitted to the first switching device.<br><br><br>
When the measurement voltage is tapped off between the first<br>
connection of the relay coil and the first switching device,<br>
the distribution of the test signals between the switching<br>
devices is correspondingly reversed.<br>
When current is flowing through the relay coil, a check can be<br>
carried out according to one advantageous development by<br>
permanently operating the first switching device, while the<br>
second switching device is operated via a pulsed test signal.<br>
By way of example, the time profile of the binary response<br>
signal can be continuously compared with the expected profile.<br>
However, one particularly advantageous embodiment of the method<br>
according to the invention provides that in order to determine<br>
whether there is a fault in the relay coil or one of the<br>
switching devices, the binary response signal is compared with<br>
the expected profile at at least two characteristic times,<br>
wherein at least one change relating to the state of at least<br>
one signal has taken place between the characteristic times. In<br>
this embodiment, the monitoring device's computation power<br>
which is required for the comparative process is kept<br>
relatively minor, since the profile of the binary response<br>
signal and the expected profile need in the simplest case be<br>
compared with one another at only two particularly<br>
characteristic times, and in consequence there is no need for<br>
continuous comparison. Since a 100% match between the binary<br>
response signal and the expected profile can normally be<br>
achieved only with difficulty in any case, a further advantage<br>
of this embodiment is that, if the times under consideration<br>
are chosen sensibly - specifically sufficiently far away from<br>
those times at which a<br><br>
change in the test signals occurs - insignificant differences<br>
between the profile of the binary response signal and the<br>
expected profile will not lead to a fault message.<br>
In order to allow the two switching devices and the relay coil<br>
to be monitored continuously for possible faults, the method<br>
according to the invention should be repeated at regular time<br>
intervals.<br>
The control device advantageously emits different test signals,<br>
depending on the state of the relay contacts.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail in the following<br>
text with reference to exemplary embodiments. In this case:<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic block diagram of one general<br>
embodiment of a switching arrangement for operating<br>
an electromagnetic relay,<br>
Figure 2 shows a circuit diagram of one possible embodiment of<br>
a switching arrangement for operating an<br>
electromagnetic relay,<br>
Figure 3 shows a plurality of diagrams in order to explain<br>
examples of test signals and the measurement voltages<br>
caused by them, and binary response signals, when the<br>
relay coil is checked without any current flowing<br>
through it,<br>

exemplary embodiment of a check with no current<br>
flowing through the relay coil,<br><br><br>
Figure 5 shows a monitoring test signal sequence with no<br>
current flowing through the relay coil,<br>
Figure 6 shows a plurality of diagrams in order to explain<br>
examples of test signals and the measurement voltages<br>
caused by them, and binary response signals when the<br>
relay coil is checked with current flowing through<br>
it, and<br>
Figure 7 shows a method flowchart in order to explain one<br>
exemplary embodiment of a check with current flowing<br>
through the relay coil.<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic block diagram of one exemplary<br>
embodiment of a switching arrangement for operating an<br>
electromagnetic relay. A control circuit for the<br>
electromagnetic relay comprises a series circuit in a current<br>
path 10 of a relay coil 11 with a first switching device 12a<br>
and a second switching device 12b, with the switching devices<br>
12a and 12b being symbolized, just by way of example, by<br>
mechanical switching devices in figure 1. The switching devices<br>
12a and 12b may be formed by mechanical switches or<br>
semiconductor switches, such as transistors.<br>
A high and a low voltage level are respectively indicated by<br>
"V+" and "V-". By way of example, the high voltage level V+ may<br>
be 10V, while the low voltage level V- is 0V. The first<br>
switching device 12a is connected to a first connection 11a of<br>
the relay coil 11 on the side with the high voltage level, V+,<br>
while the second switching device 12b is connected to a second<br>
connection l1b of the relay coil 11 on the side with the low<br>
voltage level V-.<br><br>
The control inputs of the first and the second switching<br>
devices 12a and 12b are connected to a control device 13 . The<br>
switching devices 12a and 12b can be switched on and off via<br>
the control device 13. The control device 13 is designed to<br>
emit test signals to the control inputs of the first and second<br>
switching devices 12a and 12b, as will be explained in more<br>
detail later.<br>
A measurement voltage Umeas is tapped off via a branch 14 at the<br>
connection of the second connection 11b of the relay coil 11 to<br>
the second switching device 12b, and is supplied to a<br>
conversion device 15. The conversion device 15 is designed to<br>
convert the measurement voltage Umeas to a binary response<br>
signal BS, and to emit this at its output. The binary response<br>
signal BS is supplied to a monitoring device 16, which can<br>
interchange information with the control device 13 . The<br>
monitoring device 16 may either form an autonomous unit - as<br>
illustrated in figure 1 - or else may be integrated in the<br>
control device 13, - although this is not illustrated in figure<br>
1. Both the control device 13 and the monitoring device 16 may<br>
have a microprocessor or some other logic module (for example<br>
an ASIC) which controls its operation.<br>
Although this is not illustrated in figure 1, the measurement<br>
voltage Umeas can also be arranged at the connection between the<br>
first switching device 12a and the first connection of the<br>
relay coil 11. The sequence of the test signals for monitoring<br>
the current path 10, as described in the following text, should<br>
in a situation such as this be subdivided in a correspondingly<br>
reversed manner between the two<br><br><br>
switching devices 12a and 12b, and the fault situations<br>
described below should likewise be appropriately adapted.<br>
However, the following examples are intended to be based on the<br>
measurement voltage Umeas being tapped off as shown in figure 1,<br>
that is to say between the second switching device 12b and the<br>
second connection of the relay coil 11.<br>
In one possible more specific embodiment, a switching<br>
arrangement for operating an electromagnetic relay may be<br>
designed, for example, as shown in figure 2. The same reference<br>
symbols are used in figure 2 for components corresponding to<br>
figure 1.<br>
Figure 2 shows a relay coil 11 whose first connection 11a on<br>
the side with the high voltage level V+ is connected to a first<br>
switching device 12a, while the second connection 11b of the<br>
relay coil 11 on the side with the low voltage level V- is<br>
connected to a second switching device 12b.<br>
By way of example, the switching devices 12a and 12b are<br>
illustrated in figure 2 as semiconductor switches in the form<br>
of transistors.<br>
A dashed-line boundary indicates a group of switching elements<br>
corresponding to the conversion device 15 shown in figure 1.<br>
The core piece of the conversion device 15 in the embodiment<br>
shown in figure 2 is formed by a voltage divider 22 which, for<br>
example, comprises two non-reactive resistors 22a and 22b. A<br>
voltage divider tap 23 is located between the two non-reactive<br>
resistors 22a and 22b and is connected on the one hand to the<br>
branch 14 for the measurement voltage, and<br><br><br>
on the other hand to a control input of a further switching<br>
device 24.<br>
A series circuit 25 is arranged in parallel with the relay coil<br>
11 and the switching device 12a, is composed of a non-reactive<br>
resistor 25a and a diode 25b, and is used to cope with<br>
overvoltages which can occur when the current flow through the<br>
relay coil 11 is interrupted. A further non-reactive resistor<br>
26 is used to set the voltage level of the binary response<br>
signal BS.<br>
One connection of a first damping capacitor 27a is connected to<br>
the first connection 11a of the relay coil 11 at the connection<br>
of the first switching device 12a, and its other connection is<br>
at the low voltage level V-. A second damping capacitor 27b is<br>
connected in a corresponding manner by its first connection to<br>
the connection between the second switching device 12b and the<br>
second connection 11b of the relay coil 11, and its second<br>
connection is likewise at the low voltage level V-.<br>
The method of operation of the switching arrangement<br>
illustrated in figure 2 will be explained in more detail in the<br>
following text, in particular with reference to the checking of<br>
the two switching devices 12a and 12b and of the relay coil 11<br>
for possible faults. Reference will also be made to figures 3<br>
to 7, in addition to figure 2, for this purpose.<br>
The control device 13 is first of all used to produce a current<br>
flow through the relay coil 1, or to interrupt it, by<br>
simultaneously opening or respectively closing the switching<br>
devices 12a and 12b. Simultaneously closing the two switching<br>
devices 12a and 12b results in a current flow through the relay<br>
coil 11, as a result of which a<br><br><br>
corresponding magnetic field is developed in the relay coil 11<br>
and, beyond a certain magnetic field strength, results in a<br>
change in the state of the relay contacts (not illustrated) of<br>
the electromagnetic relay. In order to interrupt the current<br>
flow in the relay coil, the control device 13 opens the two<br>
switching devices 12a and 12b, as a result of which the<br>
magnetic field produced by the relay coil 11 decays again. When<br>
the field strength produced by the magnetic field is no longer<br>
sufficient to keep the relay contacts in their position, they<br>
change over to their normal position - for example by the<br>
influence of spring force.<br>
In the situation when a fault is present in one of the two<br>
switching devices 12a and 12b or the relay coil 11, it is no<br>
longer possible to ensure correct operation of the relay coil<br>
11 and therefore of the switching circuit arranged at the relay<br>
contacts. For the situation in the example, in which the<br>
electromagnetic relay is a command relay for operating an<br>
electrical circuit breaker, a malfunction such as this can, for<br>
example, cause undesirable spurious tripping of the circuit<br>
breaker, or intended tripping of the circuit breaker may be<br>
prevented. The current path 10 comprising the two switching<br>
devices 12a and 12b of the relay coil is checked for this<br>
reason. Irrespective of whether or not current is flowing<br>
through the relay coil 11, the control device 13 emits<br>
different test signals P_A, P_B to the switching devices 12a<br>
and 12b, resulting in a change in the voltage level at the<br>
branch 14.<br>
The measurement voltage Umeas that is present at this branch 14<br>
is supplied to the conversion device 15, where it is converted<br>
to a binary<br><br><br>
response signal BS. The profile of the binary response signal<br>
BS is compared by the monitoring device 16 with an expected<br>
profile, and a fault in the current path 10 is identified if<br>
the expected profile and the actual profile of the binary<br>
response signal BS differ from one another. In order to allow<br>
the expected profile and the actual profile of the binary<br>
response signal BS to be compared with one another, the<br>
monitoring device 16 is able to interchange information with<br>
the control device 13 in order, for example, to be informed of<br>
the start of the sending of the test signals P_A, P_B to the<br>
two switching devices 12a and 12b.<br>
When the monitoring device 16 identifies a fault in the current<br>
path 10, an appropriate fault message can be emitted which<br>
informs an operator of an appliance in which the<br>
electromagnetic relay is installed of the fault. The operator<br>
of the appropriate appliance can then replace the corresponding<br>
faulty assembly even before the electromagnetic relay can<br>
actually malfunction.<br>
A check of the current path 10 for possible faults can be<br>
carried out with or without current flowing through the relay<br>
coil, and correspondingly with the relay contacts switched off<br>
or switched on, without having to influence the state of the<br>
relay contacts in the process.<br>
Figures 2, 3 and 4 will first of all be used to explain in the<br>
following text how the current path 10 is checked when<br>
(deliberately) no current is flowing through the relay coil.<br>
For this purpose, the two upper diagrams in figure 3 show the<br>
profiles of the test signals P_A and P_B, while the<br><br><br>
following ten diagrams, in each case on the left-hand side,<br>
show the measurement voltages which are present at the branch<br>
14 when no faults are present and for various fault situations,<br>
while the right-hand side in each case shows the binary<br>
response signals, which result from the respective measurement<br>
voltages, when no fault is present and for various fault<br>
situations.<br>
As can be seen from figure 3, a test signal P_B is first of all<br>
supplied to the second switching device, in order to start a<br>
test process. This test signal P_B switches the second<br>
switching device 12B to its closed state.<br>
In this case, the duration of the test signal P_B is chosen<br>
such that, even in the situation in which the first switching<br>
device 12a has been permanently short-circuited because of a<br>
fault, the duration of a current flow which then results<br>
through the relay coil 11 has no effect on the state of the<br>
relay contacts. The duration of the test signal P_B must<br>
therefore be less than the response time, as already explained<br>
earlier, of the relay. Normally, the duration of a test signal<br>
is for this purpose chosen to be between a lower and an upper<br>
limit, with the lower limit indicating that time which is<br>
required to generate a correct binary response signal in the<br>
conversion device 15, and the upper limit allowing an<br>
adequately safe margin from the response time of the relay. By<br>
way of example, the possible range for the time duration of the<br>
test signals are between approximately 40 and approximately<br>
200 us.<br>
As can be seen from figure 3, the emission of the test signal<br>
P_B to the second switching device 12b is ended again after a<br>
short time period chosen in this way, and this is followed by a<br>
signal pause, during which no test signal is emitted to the<br>
switching<br><br><br>
devices 12a or 12b. The switching pause is followed by a<br>
further test signal P_A to be emitted to the first switching<br>
device 12a, causing the switching device 12a to close. The time<br>
duration of the test signal P_A must also be chosen to be<br>
sufficiently short that the state of the relay contacts is not<br>
influenced even if the second switching device 12b is in a<br>
permanently short-circuited state because of the fault. The<br>
time duration of the test signal P_A must therefore also be<br>
shorter than the response time of the relay.<br>
The test process is ended after the end of this test signal<br>
sequence; a further test process can be started after a pause<br>
of any defined length. For example, it is possible for another<br>
test process to be initiated every 250 us.<br>
The diagrams arranged in the second line of figure 3 show the<br>
profile of the measurement voltage  in the situation when<br>
both the switching devices 12a and 12b and the relay coil 11<br>
are in a correct, that is to say fault-free, state (corr =<br>
correct). The profile of the measurement voltage  will now<br>
be explained with reference to figure 2. This is based on the<br>
assumption that the two switching devices 12a and 12b are<br>
operating correctly and they are both first of all in the<br>
switched-off state.<br>
Initially, the measurement voltage  is at a mid-voltage<br>
level, which is predetermined by the voltage divider 22. The<br>
binary response signal   is at a high level, since the<br>
measurement voltage   is sufficient to switch on the<br>
further switching device 24. The emission<br><br><br>
of the test signal P_B to the second switching device 12b<br>
closes the switching device 12b, and the measurement voltage<br>
  at the branch 14 is drawn to the low voltage level V-,<br>
since the second switching device 12b bridges the lower<br>
resistor 22b in the voltage divider 22. The profile of the<br>
measurement voltage  in figure 3 thus exhibits a sudden<br>
fall, as soon as the test signal P_B closes the switching<br>
device 12b. In a corresponding manner, the binary response<br>
signal BScorr falls to a low level, since the further switching<br>
device is switched off because of the low measurement voltage<br>
  applied to it. When the test signal P_B ends, the second<br>
switching device 12b returns to the switched-off state, and the<br>
previously discharged damping capacitors 27a and 27b are<br>
charged via the upper resistor 22a in the voltage divider 22.<br>
If the damping capacitors 27a and 27b and the non-reactive<br>
resistor 22a in the voltage divider are of adequate size, this<br>
charging process takes place sufficiently slowly but virtually<br>
no rise in the measurement voltage  is perceptible toward<br>
the signal pause. The rise in the measurement voltage  is<br>
at least not sufficient to change the further switching device<br>
24 in the conversion device 15 to its state in which current is<br>
passed through, as a result of which the binary response signal<br>
BScorr still remains at the low level during the signal pause.<br>
When the test signal P_A acts on the first switching device 12a<br>
after the signal pause, and this switching device 12a is<br>
switched to its state in which current passes through it, the<br>
damper capacitors 27a and 27b are charged comparatively<br>
quickly, since the upper resistor 22a in the voltage divider 22<br>
is bridged, and the high voltage level V+ is applied directly<br>
to the damping capacitors 27a and 27b. This rapid charging<br>
process can also be seen from the<br><br><br>
profile of the measurement voltage   which rises rapidly<br>
while the second measurement signal P_A is being emitted.<br>
Finally, the measurement voltage  is at the high voltage<br>
level V+. As soon as the measurement voltage  has reached<br>
a level which causes the further switching device 24 to switch<br>
on, the binary response signal rises suddenly to its high<br>
level. When the emission of the first test signal P_A ends<br>
after the appropriate time period has elapsed, the mid-voltage<br>
level, which is predetermined by the voltage divider 22, is<br>
assumed again at the branch 14, after the damping capacitors<br>
27a and 27b have discharged via the lower resistor 22b in the<br>
voltage divider 22.<br>
As already explained in conjunction with figure 2, the binary<br>
response signal is transmitted to the monitoring device 16,<br>
which compares the profile of the binary response signal with<br>
an expected profile. A comparison such as this can be carried<br>
out either continuously throughout the entire test process, or<br>
can be carried out discontinuously only at specific<br>
characteristic times in order on the one hand to save<br>
computation capacity in the monitoring device and on the other<br>
hand to be insensitive to insignificant differences between the<br>
binary response signal and the expected profile, which would<br>
not indicate a fault in the current path 10.<br>
For this purpose, figure 3 shows two monitoring times t1 and<br>
t2, which are each indicated by circles in the profile of the<br>
binary response signals. In consequence, for the correct<br>
profile of the binary response signal, the signal level must be<br>
low at the measurement time t1, and must be high at the<br>
measurement time t2. If the monitoring device 16 identifies the<br>
correct profile on the basis of the signal levels measured at<br>
these times, then it deduces that<br><br>
there are no faults in the current path 10, and does not carry-<br>
out any further actions, until the next test process is<br>
initiated.<br>
The profiles of the respective measurement voltages and of the<br>
binary response signals which result from them will be<br>
discussed in the following text for fault situations in which<br>
one of the two switching devices 12a or 12b is permanently<br>
short-circuited or permanently switched off, or there is a<br>
broken line in the relay coil 11.<br>
First of all, the fault situation F1 will be considered, in<br>
which the second switching device 12b is permanently switched<br>
off because of a fault. In this situation, the emission of a<br>
test signal P_B to the second switching device 12b has no<br>
effect whatsoever since the permanently switched off switching<br>
device 12b cannot be changed to the switched-on state in this<br>
way. In consequence, the corresponding measurement voltage<br>
  remains at the mid-voltage level set by the voltage<br>
divider 22 and it does not fall, as expected according to the<br>
profile of the correct measurement voltage  indicated by a<br>
dashed line, to the low voltage level V-. Correspondingly, the<br>
binary response signal BSF1 remains at its high level. During<br>
the signal pause, no test signal is emitted to the switching<br>
devices 12a or 12b, as a result of which the measurement<br>
voltage  and the resultant binary response signal BSF1<br>
correspondingly do not change. The emission of the test signal<br>
P_A to the first switching device 12a switches it to its<br>
switched-on state - since it is operating correctly - as a<br>
result of which the measurement voltage which is present at the<br>
branch 14 rises to the high voltage level V+ after charging of<br>
the damping capacitors 27a and 27b. However, this increase in<br>
the measurement voltage to the high voltage level V+<br><br><br>
has no effect on the profile of the binary response signal<br>
BSF1, because the binary response signal BSF1 is already at its<br>
high level. After the end of the test signal P_A, the first<br>
switching device 12a is switched off again and the damping<br>
capacitors 27a and 27b are discharged to the mid-voltage level<br>
which is predetermined by the voltage divider 22. In<br>
consequence, the monitoring device 16 detects a binary response<br>
signal BSF1 which is permanently at the high level throughout<br>
the test process. In the case of a discontinuous analysis of<br>
the times t1 and t2, the monitoring device 16 identifies a<br>
difference between the binary response signal BSF1 and the<br>
expected profile (indicated by a dashed line) at the time t1,<br>
since the binary response signal BSF1 is at a high level and is<br>
not, as expected, at a low level. From this, the monitoring<br>
device 16 deduces that there is a fault in the current path 10,<br>
and emits a fault signal in order to warn the operator of an<br>
electrical appliance containing the electromagnetic relay.<br>
The fault situation F2 will be considered next, in which the<br>
second switching device 12b is permanently short-circuited, as<br>
a result of which current can flow continuously via the<br>
switching device 12b. The measurement voltage which is<br>
present at the branch 14 in this situation is already at the<br>
low level voltage V- before the start of the test process,<br>
because of the short-circuited switching device 12b. Switching<br>
on the test signal P_B has no influence on this, since the<br>
switching device is in the open state in any case. The<br>
resultant binary response signal BSF2 is in consequence<br>
permanently at its low level before the start of the test<br>
process and while the test signal P_B is being emitted. During<br>
the signal pause, the state of both the measurement voltage<br><br><br>
 that of the binary response signal BSF2 do not change,<br>
since the short-circuited switching device 12b keeps the branch<br>
14 permanently at the low voltage level V-. The emission of the<br>
test signal P_A to the first switching device 12a changes<br>
nothing relating to this, either; the branch 14 remains<br>
permanently at the low voltage level V- as a result of the<br>
short-circuited switching device 12b, even when the switching<br>
device 12a is closed. This fault situation F2 illustrates the<br>
importance of the time duration of the test signals since, if<br>
the test signal P_A were chosen to be too long, the response<br>
time of the relay would be exceeded if the switching device 12b<br>
were to be permanently short-circuited, and the state of the<br>
relay contacts would therefore change undesirably. Emitting the<br>
test signal P_A for a correspondingly short time is the only<br>
way to ensure that, although on the one hand it is possible to<br>
detect the binary signals BSF2, the response time of the relay<br>
is, on the other hand, not exceeded, so that the state of the<br>
relay contacts does not change. In this fault situation F2, the<br>
monitoring device 16 is supplied with a binary response signal<br>
BSF2 which is permanently at the low level. If the binary<br>
response signal BE?1 is analyzed discretely at the times t1 and<br>
t2, a difference will be found at the time t2, where the binary<br>
response signal BSF2 is at the low level, instead of at the<br>
expected high level. The monitoring device 16 therefore emits a<br>
fault signal in order to indicate a fault in the current<br>
path 10.<br>
The next fault situation F3 comprises both faults, in which the<br>
switching device 12a is switched off permanently and there is a<br>
broken line in the relay coil 11 (or both) , such that no<br>
current can flow via the relay coil 11. In this case, the<br>
measurement voltage starts at the<br><br><br>
mid-voltage potential, which is predetermined by the voltage<br>
divider 22, and, on emission of the test signal P_B, falls to<br>
the low voltage level because the second switching device 12b<br>
is then short-circuited. In a corresponding manner, the binary<br>
response signal BSF3 falls to its low level. During the signal<br>
pause, the damping capacitor 27b (in the event of a broken line<br>
in the relay coil 11) or both damping capacitors 27a and 27b<br>
(if the first switching device 12a is permanently switched off)<br>
is or are charged again via the upper resistor 22a in the<br>
voltage divider 22, with this charging process taking place<br>
sufficiently slowly, as already mentioned, that the state of<br>
the further switching device 24 does not change. In<br>
consequence, the binary response signal BSF3 remains at the low<br>
level. Since, in the fault situation F3 under consideration<br>
here, either the first switching device 12a or the relay coil<br>
11 (or both) 'are or is switched off permanently, the emission<br>
of a test signal P_A to the first switching device 12a cannot<br>
produce any current flow through the switching device 12a and<br>
the relay coil 11, as a result of which the process of charging<br>
the damping capacitors 27a and 27b via the resistor 22a<br>
continues correspondingly slowly, as a result of which the<br>
measurement voltage which is present at the branch 14 is<br>
also not sufficient to switch on the further switching device<br>
24 while the test signal P_A is being emitted. In consequence,<br>
the binary response signal BSF3 remains at the low level. The<br>
monitoring device 16 is supplied with a low level of the binary<br>
response signal BSF3 at each of the times t1 and t2, as a result<br>
of which a difference from the expected profile is found at the<br>
time t2, and a fault signal is emitted.<br>
Finally, the fault situation F4 will be considered, in which<br>
the first switching device 12a is permanently short-circuited.<br><br><br>
Since, in this case, the upper resistor 22a in the voltage<br>
divider 22 is permanently bridged, the measurement voltage<br>
 in this case starts at the high voltage level V+ even<br>
before the start of the test process. The binary response<br>
signal BSF4 is correspondingly at the high level. Emission of<br>
the test signal P_B closes the second switching device 12b, and<br>
the voltage level at the branch 14 therefore falls to the low<br>
voltage level V-. This sudden change can be seen from the<br>
profile of the measurement voltage and also from the<br>
binary response signal BSF4 which results from this. After the<br>
end of the test signal P_B, the second switching device 12b<br>
once again is switched off, as a result of which the capacitors<br>
27a and 27b are charged very quickly to the high voltage level<br>
V+ via the permanently short-circuited switching device 12a. In<br>
consequence, the binary response signal BSF4 jumps to the high<br>
level again even during the signal pause. In consequence,<br>
emission of the test signal P_A to the first switching device<br>
12a has no more effect whatsoever on the measurement voltage<br>
and on the binary response signal BSF4 resulting from<br>
this, since the first switching device 12a is permanently<br>
short-circuited in any case, and the branch 14 is already at<br>
the high voltage level V+. In consequence, in this fault<br>
situation, the monitoring device 16 is supplied with the<br>
profile of the binary response signal BSF4 as illustrated in<br>
figure 3. Even when the times t1 and t2 are considered<br>
discretely, the monitoring device 16 identifies a difference<br>
between the binary response signal BEF4 and the expected<br>
profile at the time t1, and emits a fault signal.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the timing of the test process for<br>
discontinuous testing at the times t1 and t4,<br><br><br>
once again in a summarized form on the basis of a method<br>
flowchart. After the start of the test process ("TEST Start"),<br>
the test signal P_B is first of all emitted to the second<br>
switching device 12b by the control device 13, in step 40. A<br>
wait from a specific time period, for example 40 us, takes<br>
place according to step 41, before the second test signal P_B<br>
is switched off again in step 42. A wait for a predetermined<br>
time period, for example 40 us again, once again takes place<br>
during the signal pause in step 43, during which no test signal<br>
is emitted. Once this time period has elapsed, a check is<br>
carried out in step 44 to determined whether the binary<br>
response signal is at the expected low level (annotated "0" in<br>
figure 4). If this is not the case, a fault message is emitted.<br>
However, if the check in step 44 shows that the binary response<br>
signal is at the expected low level, then the test signal P_A<br>
is switched on according to step 45, in order to switch on the<br>
switching device 12a. The test signal P_A is maintained in step<br>
46 for a predetermined time period, for example of 40 us again,<br>
before the monitoring device 16 checks, in step 47, whether the<br>
binary response signal is at the expected high level (the high<br>
level is annotated "1" by way of example, in figure 4). If a<br>
binary response signal difference is found, a fault message is<br>
once again emitted. If a correct binary response signal is<br>
identified, then the test signal P_A is switched off in a next<br>
step 48, and the test process is successfully completed ("TEST<br>
OK") .<br>
After a predetermined time period has elapsed, the test process<br>
can be initiated once again by activating the sequence "TEST<br>
Start", in order to ensure continuous testing of the current<br>
path 10.<br><br><br>
The monitoring of the current path 10 for the situation in<br>
which (deliberately) current is flowing through the relay coil<br>
11 will now be described with reference to figures 5 to 7. In<br>
this case as well, there is once again a requirement for the<br>
check to have no influence whatsoever on the state of the relay<br>
contacts.<br>
The switching-on and holding process of the electromagnetic<br>
relay is illustrated first of all in figure 5. As is known, a<br>
relay coil requires more power to be supplied to it in order to<br>
operate the relay contacts, for example while the relay<br>
contacts are being switched on, and is required to hold the<br>
relay contacts in their operated position. In consequence, the<br>
two switching devices 12a and 12b are first of all switched on<br>
at the same time at the time to, in order to move the relay<br>
contacts. The simultaneous operation of both switching devices<br>
12a and 12b ensures a permanently high current flow through the<br>
relay coil 11, as a result of which the contacts can be quickly<br>
moved to their activated position. This activation phase of the<br>
relay contacts lasts, as shown in figure 5, from the starting<br>
time to to the time t*, at which the relay contacts have been<br>
moved to their activated state.<br>
A so-called pulse-width-modulated holding current can then be<br>
passed through the relay coil 11 by pulsed operation of the<br>
second switching device 12b, producing less power, averaged<br>
over time (and therefore also less power loss in the relay<br>
coil), and which is adequate to hold the relay contacts in<br>
their activated state. Once again, in this case as well, the<br>
inertia of the electromagnetic relay is used since - as already<br>
described above - the magnetic field in the relay coil 11 does<br>
not decay until after a certain response time to such an extent<br>
that the relay contacts would once again change to their<br>
deactivated state, such that this response time<br><br><br>
is always undershot, and the relay contacts remain permanently<br>
in their activated state, if the pulses are appropriately<br>
short.<br>
This procedure of providing a lower holding current overall for<br>
the electromagnetic relay by a pulse-width-modulated current<br>
flow in the relay coil 11, is already known per se.<br>
The operation of the second switching device 12b, which is<br>
pulsed in any case, is now advantageously also used as the<br>
pulsed test signal P_B for monitoring the corresponding<br>
measurement voltage Umeas at the branch 14, in order to monitor<br>
the current path 10. For explanatory purposes relating to this,<br>
each of the two upper diagrams in figure 6 shows the profile of<br>
the test signals P_A and P_B while the test signal P_B is being<br>
pulsed, and this is emphasized by a border in figure 5. In this<br>
case, the test signal P_A is emitted continuously, while the<br>
test signal P_B is emitted in a pulsed form.<br>
The correct profile of the measurement voltage and the<br>
correct profile of the binary response signal BScorr* resulting<br>
from this are illustrated in the second line of the two<br>
diagrams in figure 6. The profile of the measurement voltage<br>
 and the binary response signal BScorr* will be explained<br>
with reference to figure 2.<br>
For the situation in which both the two switching devices 12a<br>
and 12b as well as the relay coil 11 are fault-free, the<br>
switching device 12a is in its closed state at the start of the<br>
test sequence, while the switching device 12b is switched off,<br>
because there is no test signal P_B. In consequence, the high<br>
voltage level V+ is produced at the branch 14, which is<br>
produced by switching on the further switching device 24,<br><br><br>
and the binary response signal BScorr is in consequence at the<br>
high level. When the test signal P_B is emitted, the switching<br>
device 12b, which is then closed, draws the measurement voltage<br>
 the branch 14 to the lower voltage level V-, since in<br>
this case the lower resistor 22b in the voltage divider 22 is<br>
bridged. Both the measurement voltage and the binary<br>
response signal BScorr* which results from it correspondingly<br>
fall suddenly. As long as the test signal P_B is emitted, the<br>
measurement voltage remains at the low voltage level V-, and<br>
the binary response signal BScorr remains at the low level.<br>
When the test signal p_B ends, the second switching device 12b<br>
is switched off again. The sudden interruption in the current<br>
flow in the relay coil 11 and the magnetic field decay<br>
resulting from this induce an overvoltage, which decays slowly<br>
via the current flowing through the resistor 25a and the diode<br>
25b. The measurement voltage tapped off at the branch 14<br>
correspondingly first of all rises above the high voltage level<br>
V+, and then falls gradually to the high voltage level V+<br>
again. Before the current were to fall below the holding<br>
current again, with the magnetic field strength therefore no<br>
longer being adequate to hold the relay contacts in their<br>
activated position, the test signal P_B must be switched on<br>
again, in order to close the current path 10 again.<br>
The measurement voltage illustrated in figure 6 in<br>
consequence results in a binary response signal BScorr* which,<br>
after the end of the emission of the test signal P_B, once<br>
again changes to its high level again, because the measurement<br>
voltage then rises.<br><br><br>
The monitoring device 16 is supplied with the profile of the<br>
binary response signal BS. As when no current is flowing<br>
through the relay coil, the correct profile of the binary<br>
response signal can be tested continuously or discontinuously.<br>
Figure 6 shows two characteristic times t3 and t4 for the<br>
discontinuous analysis, at which the monitoring device 16<br>
checks the profile of the binary response signal. If the<br>
profile of the binary response signal is correct, corresponding<br>
to BScorr*, a low level must in consequence be identified at the<br>
time t3, and a high level at the time t4.<br>
The fault situations which can possibly be identified,<br>
specifically a permanently short-circuited or a permanently<br>
switched-off switching device 12b, a permanently switched-off<br>
switching device 12a or a broken line in the relay coil 11,<br>
will now be explained in the following text.<br>
Since the switching device 12a is in any case permanently held<br>
in its closed state by the emission of a continuous test signal<br>
P_A, the test sequence when current is flowing through the<br>
relay coil 11 cannot identify the state in which the first<br>
switching device 12a is permanently short-circuited as a result<br>
of a fault. However, since this would not initially lead to any<br>
malfunction of the electromagnetic relay - the first switching<br>
device 12a should be permanently short-circuited in any case -<br>
the lack of capability to identify a fault such as this is not<br>
a disadvantage of the test process. It will be simple to<br>
identify a fault such as this during the check, as already<br>
described above, when no current is flowing through the relay<br>
coil.<br><br><br>
The fault situation F5 will be dealt with first of all, in<br>
which the second switching device 12b is in a permanently<br>
switched-off state. In a situation such as this, the branch 14<br>
would remain permanently at the high voltage level V+ because<br>
of the deliberately short-circuited switching device 12a. Since<br>
emission of the test signal P_B has no influence on the<br>
switching state of the second switching device 12b, because<br>
this second switching device 12b is permanently switched off<br>
because of the fault, the measurement voltage at the<br>
branch 14 remains at the high voltage level V+ irrespective of<br>
the state of the test signal P_B. The binary response signal<br>
BSF5 which results from this in consequence remains<br>
continuously at the high level, as a result of which the<br>
monitoring device 16 finds a difference between the profile of<br>
the binary response signal BSF5 and the expected profile. In<br>
the case of the discontinuous analysis at the times t3 and t4,<br>
the monitoring device 16 finds a difference in the binary<br>
response signal BSF5 at the time t3, with the response signal<br>
being at the high level rather than the low level, and can<br>
generate a fault signal.<br>
The fault situation F6 will be dealt with next, in which the<br>
second switching device 12b is permanently short-circuited. In<br>
this case, the measurement voltage at the branch 14 is<br>
continuously at the low voltage level V- because the switching<br>
device 12b is permanently short-circuited, thus resulting in<br>
the profile of the measurement voltage as shown in figure<br>
6. In this case, the measurement voltage is at the low<br>
voltage level V- irrespective of the test signal P_B, as a<br>
result of which the resultant binary response signal BSF6 also<br>
remains permanently at the low level. The monitoring device 16<br>
can in consequence detect a difference from the expected<br>
profile both in continuous monitoring and discontinuous<br>
monitoring of the profile of the binary<br><br><br>
response signal; in the case of discontinuous analysis, the<br>
monitoring device 16 identifies a low level of the binary<br>
response signal BSF6 instead of an expected high level at the<br>
time t4, as a result of which a fault signal can be emitted.<br>
Finally, the fault situation F7 will be considered, in which<br>
either the relay coil 11 has a broken line or the first<br>
switching device 12a is switched off permanently. In this case,<br>
the measurement voltage at the branch 14 first of all<br>
starts at a mid-voltage level, which is set via the voltage<br>
divider 22, since the second switching device 12b also prevents<br>
current from flowing. The binary response signal BSF7 in<br>
consequence starts at the high level. After the test signal P_B<br>
has been switched on, and the second switching device 12b has<br>
in consequence between closed, the measurement voltage <br>
the branch 14 is drawn to the low voltage level V-. This also<br>
results in the binary response signal BSF7 falling to the low<br>
level. The measurement voltage remains at the low voltage<br>
level V-, for as long as the test signal P_B holds the second<br>
switching device 12b in the closed state. After the end of the<br>
test signal P_B, the damping capacitor 27b (in the event of a<br>
broken line in the relay coil 11) or both damping capacitors<br>
(in the event of the first switching device 12a being switched<br>
off permanently) is or are once again charged to the mid-<br>
voltage level through the upper resistor 22a in the voltage<br>
divider 22.<br>
However, once again, this takes place correspondingly slowly,<br>
as a result of which the binary response signal BSF7 initially<br>
remains at the low level. The monitoring device 16 therefore<br>
identifies a<br><br><br>
difference between the binary response signal BSF7 and the<br>
expected profile. In discontinuous analysis, the monitoring<br>
device 16 identifies a low level instead of an expected high<br>
level of the binary response signal at the time t4, and can<br>
emit a fault signal.<br>
Finally, figure 7 shows the procedure for the test process when<br>
current is flowing through the relay coil 11, for discontinuous<br>
monitoring of the binary response signal at the times t3 and<br>
t4. After initiation of the test process ("TEST Start"), the<br>
test signal P_B is switched on in a first step 71. After<br>
waiting for a short time period to pass in step 72, a check is<br>
carried out in step 73 to determine whether the binary response<br>
signal BS has assumed a low level ("0") .<br>
The time period required in step 72 may be chosen only to be<br>
sufficiently long that the reaction of the binary response<br>
signal BS to the second switching device 12b being switched on<br>
by the test signal P_B can be detected correctly.<br>
A fault message is emitted if a difference is found between the<br>
binary response signal BS and the expected low level at the<br>
time t3 in step 73. However, if the binary response signal BS<br>
in step 73 corresponds to the expected profile, then, after a<br>
time period which is sufficient to produce the required holding<br>
current has elapsed in step 74, the test signal P_B is switched<br>
off again in step 75, and waiting takes place for a further<br>
short time period in step 76, which time period is chosen such<br>
that a reaction of the binary response signal can be detected.<br>
A check is carried out in step 77 to determine whether the<br>
binary response signal BS is at the expected high level. If<br>
this is not the case, a fault is once again emitted.<br><br><br>
However, if the binary response signal is at the expected high<br>
level, then the test process is successfully ended, and can be<br>
started once again after a predetermined time period has<br>
elapsed.<br>
The information interchange that this makes possible between<br>
the control device 13 and the monitoring device 16 makes it<br>
possible for the monitoring device 16 to include the expected<br>
profile of the binary response signal, as appropriate for the<br>
respective nominal state of the relay coil 11 (either with or<br>
without current flowing through it) in its check.<br>
Finally, it should also be mentioned that, in the case of<br>
discontinuous checking each of two characteristic measurement<br>
times, accurate fault differentiation is not possible all the<br>
time, depending on the nature of the fault that has occurred,<br>
since a plurality of fault types at the characteristic times<br>
generally indicate mutually corresponding differences from the<br>
desired profile of the binary response signal. However, there<br>
is also frequently no need to precisely distinguish the nature<br>
of the fault since the only interest of the operator of an<br>
electrical appliance in which the electromagnetic relay is used<br>
is to determine whether the relay operation is correct or<br>
faulty. If one of the possible faults occurs, then the operator<br>
will replace the appropriate switching group with the relay<br>
control and the electromagnetic relay, irrespective of the<br>
nature of the fault, in order to ensure that his electrical<br>
appliance operates correctly.<br>
If precise fault differentiation is nevertheless desirable,<br>
then either the binary response signal must be continuously<br>
monitored by means of the monitoring device or the number of<br>
measurement times must be increased correspondingly by further<br>
characteristic times,<br><br><br>
since this makes it possible to indicate further meaningful<br>
differences in the binary response signal. In this case, it is<br>
possible for the monitoring device to also emit the nature of<br>
the fault, at the same time as its fault message.<br>
However, in the case of the discontinuous analysis described<br>
with just two measurement times, it is also feasible to at<br>
least correspondingly isolate the choice of possible types of<br>
fault. For example, during the check with the relay coil 11 in<br>
the switched-on state, it is possible during the check of the<br>
level according to step 77 (see figure 7) for a more specific<br>
fault message to be emitted if a difference is found,<br>
indicating that either the second switching device 12b is<br>
permanently short-circuited or the first switching device 12a<br>
is switched off permanently, or that there is a broken<br>
conductor in the relay coil 11. Isolation to a permanently<br>
switched-off second switching device 12b is already possible<br>
during the check of the level of the binary response signal in<br>
step 73, as shown in figure 7. By way of example, fault<br>
messages such as these can be helpful for repairing a defective<br>
relay assembly, or when searching for a systematic fault cause.<br><br><br>
