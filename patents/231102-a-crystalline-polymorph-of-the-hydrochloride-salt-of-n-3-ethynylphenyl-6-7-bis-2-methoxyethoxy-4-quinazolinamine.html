Background, of the Invention<br>
N-(3-ethynylphenyl)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)-4-quinazolinamine, in either its hydrochloride or mesylate forms, or in an anhydrous and hydrous form, is useful in the treatment of hyperproliferative disorders, such as cancers, in mammals.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,747,498, issued May 5, 1998, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, refers, in Example 20, to [6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)-quinazolin-4-yl]-(3-ethynylphenyl)amine hydrochloride, which, the patent discloses, is an inhibitor of the erbB family of oncogenic and protooncogenic protein tyrosine kinases, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and is therefore useful for the treatment of proliferative disorders, such as cancers, in humans.<br>
The mesylate form, described in PCT International Publication No. WO 99/55683 (PCT/IB99/00612, filed April S, 1999), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference,<br><br>
and assigned to a common assignee, and shown in formula 1 below:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
is useful for the treatment of proliferative disorders, and more preferred with parenteral methods of administration, as compared to the hydrochloride compound, i.e. with greater effectiveness in solution.<br>
The mesylate compounds are more soluble in aqueous compositions than the hydrochloride compound, and thus the mesylate compounds are easily delivered according to parenteral methods of administration. The hydrochloride compound is however preferred with respect to solid administration such as with tablets and oral administration.<br><br>

It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a method for the production of the hydrochloride salt of N-(3-ethynylphenyl) -6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)-4-quinazolinamine in HC1 form (Formula 2):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
making it more suitable for tablet and oral administration and consisting essentially of the stable polymorphic form (polymorph form B) as well as the compound in such polymorph B form and the intermediate polymorph A in essentially pure form.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide such stable polymorph form B in a pharmaceutical orally administered composition.<br><br>
Stability of the hydrochloride compound is of concern for its use in the treatment of patients since variations will affect effective dosage level and administration. It has been discovered<br>
that the hydrochloride of N-(3-ethynylphenyl)-6,7~bis (2-methoxyethoxy)-4-quinazolinamine exists in two polymorph states, polymorph A and B. This contrasts with the mesylate compounds which exist in three polymorph states (mesylate polymorphs A, B and C) . Polymorph B of the hydrochloride was found to be the thermodynamically most stable and desirable form and the present invention comprises the polymorph B compound in the substantially pure polymorphic B form and pharmaceutical compositions of the substantially pure form of polymorph B, particularly in tablet form and a method of the selective production of the compound.<br>
The hydrochloride compound disclosed in the U.S. Patent No. 5,747,4 98 actually comprised a mixture of the polymorphs A and B, which, because of its partially reduced stability (i.e., from the polymorph A component) was not more preferred for tablet form than the mesylate salt forms.<br>
Specifically, the present invention relates to methods of producing the hydrochloride compound forms of N-(3-ethynylphenyl)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)-4-quinazolinamine and for producing the stable form B in high yield. The mesylate salt of N- (3-ethynylphenyl)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)-4-quinazolinamine has been discovered to exist in at least three polymorphic forms which have been designated A, B, and C, of increasing stability with different X-ray powder diffraction patterns. The X-ray powder diffraction patterns for the hydrochloride polymorph A (Ax and A2) and B (B1 and B2) forms are shown in Figures 1-4 as follows: graphs of Figures 1 and 3 are over a larger range to fully show the first peaks for A and B, respectively, and graphs of Figures 2 and 4 are over a shorter range to show more overall detail for A and B, respectively.<br><br>
The data contained in the above X-ray diffraction patterns of Figure 1-4 are tabulated in the following Tables 1-4:<br>

It is expected that the compound of the invention can render abnormal cells more sensitive to treatment with radiation for purposes of killing and/or inhibiting the growth of such cells.<br><br>
Accordingly, this invention further relates to a method for sensitizing abnormal cells in a mammal to treatment with radiation which comprises administering to the mammal an amount of the compound of the invention, pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, or prodrug thereof, which amount is effective in sensitizing abnormal cells to treatment with radiation. The amount of the compound, salt, solvate, or prodrug in this method can be determined according to the means for ascertaining effective amounts of the compound of the invention described herein.<br>
The subject invention also includes isotopically-labelled compounds, which compounds are identical to the above recited compound of the invention, but for the fact that one or more atoms thereof are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from' the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the compound of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, such as 2H 3H, 13C, l4C, 15N, 18O and 170, respectively. Compounds of the present invention, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H and 14c are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., 3Hr and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased In vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances.

Patients that can be treated with the compound of the invention, alone or in combination, include, for example, patients that have been diagnosed as having psoriasis, BPH, lung cancer, bone cancer, pancreatic cancer, skin cancer, cancer of the head and neck, cutaneous or intraocular melanoma, ovarian cancer, rectal cancer, cancer of the anal region, stomach cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer,  gynecologic tumors  (e.g.,  uterine sarcomas, carcinoma of the fallopian tubes, carcinoma of the endometrium, carcinoma of the cervix, carcinoma of the vagina or carcinoma of the vulva),  Hodgkin's disease,  cancer of the esophagus, cancer of the small intestine, cancer of the endocrine system (e.g., cancer of the thyroid, parathyroid or adrenal glands), sarcomas of soft tissues, cancer of the urethra, cancer of the penis, prostate cancer, chronic or acute leukemia, solid tumors of childhood, lymphocytic lymphohas,  cancer of the bladder, cancer of the kidney or ureter (e.g., renal cell carcinoma, carcinoma of the renal pelvis), or neoplasms of the central nervous system (e.g.r primary CNS lymphona, spinal axis tumors, brain stem gliomas or pituitary adenomas).<br><br>
Activity<br>
The in vitro activity of the compounds of the present invention in inhibiting the receptor tyrosine kinase (and thus subsequent proliferative response, e.g.. cancer) may be determined by the following procedure.<br>
The activity of the compounds of the present invention, in vitro,     can be determined by the amount of inhibition of the phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate (e.g.. Lys, - Gastrin or polyGluTyr (4:1) random copolymer (I. Posner et al. , J. Biol. Chem. 267 (29), 20638-47 (1992)) on tyrosine by epidermal growth factor receptor kinase by a test compound relative to a control. Affinity purified,  soluble  human  EGF receptor  (96  ng)  is obtained according to the procedure in G. N. Gill, W. Weber, Methods  in  Enzymology  146.  82-88  (1987)  from A431  cells (American  Type  Culture  Collection,   Rockville,   MD)   and preincubated  in  a  microfuge  tube  with  EGF  (2µg/ml)  in phosphorylation buffer + vanadate (PBV: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4; 125 mM NaCl; 24 mM MgCl2; 100 µM sodium orthovanadate) , in a total volume of 10 µl, for 20-30 minutes at room temperature.  The test compound, dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), is diluted in PBV, and 10µl is mixed with the EGF receptor /EGF mix, and incubated for  10-30 minutes  at  30°C.   The phosphorylation reaction is initiated by addition of 20µl 33P-ATP/ substrate mix (120 pM Lys3-Gastrin (sequence in single letter code for amino acids, KKKGPWLEEEEEAYGWLDF), 50 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 40 µM ATP, 2 pCiγ -[33P] -ATP) to the EGFr/EGF mix and incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature.  The reaction is stopped by addition of 10 µl  stop solution (0.5 M EDTA, pH 8; 2mM ATP) and 6 µl 2N HCl. The tubes are centrifuged at 14,000 RPM, 4°C, for 10 minutes. 35 µl of supernatant from each tube is pipetted onto a 2.5 cm circle of Whatman P81 paper, bulk washed four times in 5% acetic acid, 1 liter per wash, and then air dried. This results in the binding of substrate to the paper with loss of free ATP on washing.    The  [33P]  incorporated  is  measured  by  liquid<br><br>
scintillation counting. Incorporation in the absence of substrate (e.g., lys3-gastrin) is subtracted from all values as a background and percent inhibition is calculated relative to controls without test compound present. Such assays, carried out with a range of doses of test compounds, allow the determination of an approximate IC50 value for the In vitro inhibition of EGFR kinase activity.<br>
Other methods for determining the activity of the compounds of the present invention are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,747,498, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein.<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
The pharmaceutical composition may, for example and most preferably, be in a form suitable for oral administration as a tablet, capsule, pill, powder, sustained release formulations, solution, and suspension. Less preferred (with the mesylate form being the preferred form) are compositons for parenteral injection as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion, for topical administration as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration as a suppository. The pharmaceutical composition may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. The pharmaceutical composition will include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and a compound according to the invention as an active ingredient. In addition, it may include other medicinal or pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, etc.<br>
Exemplary parenteral administration forms include solutions or suspensions of active compounds in sterile aqueous solutions, for example, aqueous propylene glycol or dextrose solutions. Such dosage forms can be suitably buffered, if desired.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical  carriers  include  inert diluents  or fillers, water and various organic solvents.  The pharmaceutical<br><br>
compositions may, if desired, contain additional ingredients such as flavorings, binders, excipients and the like. Thus for oral administration, tablets containing various excipients, such as cirric acid may be employed together with various disintegrants such as starch, alginic acid and certain complex silicates and with binding agents such as sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often useful for tableting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules. Preferred materials, therefor, include lactose or milk sugar and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions or elixirs are desired for oral administration the active compound therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matters or dyes and, if desired, emulsifying agents or suspending agents, together with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin, or combinations thereof. Additionally, it is also possible to administer the compound of the invention topically and this may be done by way of creams, jellies, gels, pastes, ointments and the like, in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice.<br>
The compound of the invention may also be administered to a mammal other than a human. The dosage to be administered to a mammal will depend on the animal species and the disease or disorder being treated. The compound may be administered to animals in the form of a capsule, bolus, tablet or liquid drench. The compound may also be administered to animals by injection or as an implant. Such formulations are prepared in a conventional manner in accordance with standard veterinary practice. As an alternative, the compound may be administered with the animal feedstuff, and for this purpose a concentrated feed additive or premix may be prepared for mixing with the normal animal feed.<br><br>
Methods of preparing various pharmaceutical compositions with a specific amount of active compound are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art. For examples, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. Mack Publishing Company, Easter, Pa., 15th Edition (1975).<br>
Administration and Dosage<br>
Administration of the compounds of the present invention (hereinafter the "active compound(s)" ) can be effected by any method that enables delivery of the compounds to the site of action. These methods preferably include oral routes such as in the form of tablets, intraduodenal routes, parenteral injection (including intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion), topical, and rectal administration. While parenteral administration is usually preferred, oral administration is preferred for the hydrochloride B polymorph.<br>
The amount of the active compound administered will be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration and the judgement of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 1 to about 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.05 to about 7 g/day, preferably about 0.2 to about 2.5 g/day. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, provided that such larger doses are first divided into several small doses for administration throughout the day.<br>
[6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)quinazolin-4-yl]-(3-ethynylphenyl)-amine hydrochloride, preferably the stable polymorph B form, at doses of 1-7000 mg/day, preferably 5-2500 mg/day, most preferably 5-200 mg/day, is also useful for the treatment of patients (as measured, for example, by increased survival times)<br><br>
by using combination therapies, for example in NSCLC (Illb/V), as a 1st line therapy with carboplatin/paclitaxel or gemcitabine/cisplatin, in NSCLC (Illb/V), as a 2nd line therapy with taxotere, and in head and neck cancers, as a 2nd line therapy with methotrexate for patients refractory to 5FU/cisplatin.<br>
[6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)quinazolin-4-yl]-(3-ethynylphenyl)-amine hydrochloride, preferably the stable polymorph B form, at doses of 1-7000 mg/day, preferably 5-2500 mg/day, most preferably 5-200 mg/day, is also useful for the treatment of patients with additional conditions, including pancreatic cancer, with or without gemcitabine co-treatment, as first line therapy, for renal cancer, gastric cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer (e.g. as a 2nd line therapy for patients who have failed 5FU/LCV/Irinotecan therapy), and also for hepatocellular, bladder, brain, ovarian, breast, and cervical cancers. For such treatments, in advanced disease patients with refractory disease, treatment effectiveness is readily monitored by an increased response rate, an increased time to progression or an increase in survival time.<br>
[6, 7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)quinazolin-4-yl]-(3-ethynylphenyl)-amine hydrochloride, preferably the stable polymorph B form, is typically used at doses of 1-7000 mg/day, preferably 5-2500 mg/day, most preferably 5-200 mg/day, for any of the above treatments.<br>

The reaction mixture was cooled to 20-25°C and added slowly to a stirred solution of sodium bicarbonate 64.2 kg and water 274L cooled to 4°C so that the temperature was maintained at less than 10°C. The final pH of the mixture was adjusted to within the range 7.0 to 8.0 by using 50% sodium hydroxide solution as required.  The biphasic mixture<br><br>
was stirred for fifteen to twenty minutes and allowed to settle for a minimum of thirty minutes at 10-20°C. The layers were separated and the organic layer was concentrated to 1/3 of its volume by removing methylene chloride. 375L of heptane was added with continued distillation of the remaining methylene chloride until the distillate reached a temperature between 65 and 68°C. The mixture was then cooled to 0 to 5°C over 4 hour and granulated for a minimum of 1 hour with the solids being isolated by filtration and washed with 90L heptane.<br>

compound of formula	6, as intermediate,  and the compound of<br>
formula 2:<br>
Materials	Quantity        Units	Equivalents/Volumes<br>
Compound of formula 5	61.1	kg	1.2 equivalents<br>

Example 4 - Preparation of compound of formula 2<br>
The following procedure is exemplary of the procedure to follow in the synthesis of the formula 2 compound and intermediate compound of formula 6:<br>
61.1 kg of formula 5 compound, 4.5 kg sodium hydroxide pellets and 489 L toluene were charged to a clean, dry, reaction vessel under nitrogen atmosphere and the reaction temperature is adjusted to between 105 to 108 °C. Acetone was removed over four hours by atmospheric distillation while toluene is added to maintain a minimum volume of 6 L of solvent per kg of formula 5 compound. The reaction mixture was then heated at reflux temperature, returning distillates to pot, until the reaction was complete. The mixture was then cooled to between 20 to 25 °C, at which time a slurry of 40.0 L toluene and 0.5 kg filteraid was charged to the reaction mixture and the mixture was agitated for ten to fifteen minutes. The resultant material was filtered to remove filteraid, and the cake is washed with 30 L toluene (compound of formula 6).<br>
The filtrate (compound of formula 6) was placed in a clean, dry reaction vessel under nitrogen atmosphere, and 90.8 kg of the compound of formula 4 was charged into the reaction vessel together with 732 L acetonitrile. The reaction vessel was heated to reflux temperature and well agitated. Agitator speed was lowered when heavy solids appear. When the reaction was complete, the contents of reaction vessel were cooled to between 19 to 25 °C over three to four hours and the contents were agitated for at least one hour at a temperature between 20 and 25 °C. The solids (compound of formula 2, polymorph A form, or mixture of polymorph A and B) were then isolated by filtration and the filter cake was washed with two portions of 50 L acetonitrile and dried under vacuum at a temperature between 4 0 and 4 5 °C.<br><br><br>
It has been discovered that the production of the A polymorph is favored by the reduction of the amount of acetonitrile relative to toluene, and particularly favored if isopropanol is used in place of acetonitrile. However, the use of isopropanol or other alcohols as cosolvents is disfavored because of tne propensity to form an ether linkage between the alcoholic oxygen and the 4-carbon of the quinazoline, instead of the desired ethynyl phenyl amino moiety.<br>
It has been further discovered that adjusting the pH of the reaction to between pH 1 and pH 7, preferably between pH 2 and pH 5, more preferably between pH 2.5 and pH 4, most preferably pH 3, will improve the rate of the reaction.<br>
Example 5 - Recrystallization of compound of formula 2 (which may be in polymorph A form or a mixture of polymorphs A and B) to Polymorph B (Step 3) Reaction:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The following materials were used in the conversion of polymorph A (or mixtures of polymorphs A and B) to polymorph B of the compound of formula 2:<br>
Materials	Quantity	Units	Equivalents/Volumes<br>
Polymorph A (formula 2)	117.6	kg                    1 equivalent<br>
2B-ethanol	1881.6	L                          16 L/kg<br>
Water	470.4	L                         4  L/kg<br>
The following procedure is exemplary of procedures used to convert polymorph A (or mixtures of polymorphs A and B) into the more thermodynamically stable polymorph B of the compound of formula 2:<br><br>
117.6 kg of the polymorph A (or mixtures of polymorphs A and B)  were charged to a clean,  dry,  reaction vessel together 1881.6 L 2B-ethanol and 470.4 L water under a nitrogen atmosphere. The temperature was adjusted to reflux (-80 °C) and the mixture was agitated until the solids dissolve. The solution was cooled to between 65 and 70 °C and clarified by filtration. With low speed agitation, the solution was further cooled to between 50 and 60 °C over a  minimum  time  of  2  hours  and  the  precipitate  was granulated for 2 hours at this temperature. The mixture was further cooled to between 0 and 5 °C over a minimum time of 4 hours and granulated for a minimum of 2 hours at this temperature. The solids  (polymorph B) were isolated by filtration and washed with at least 100 L 2B-ethanol.  The solids were determined to be crystalline polymorph B form of     [6,7-bis (2-methoxyethoxy) quinazolin-4-yl] - ( 3-ethynylphenyl)-amine hydrochloride substantially free of the polymorph A from.  The solids obtained by this method are substantially homogeneous polymorph B form crystals relative to the polymorph A form.  The method allows for production of polymorph B in an amount at least 70% by weight, at least 80% by weight, at least 90% by weight, at least 95% by weight, and at least 98% by weight relative to the weight of the polymorph A.   It is to be understood that the methods described herein are only exemplary and are not  intended to exclude variations  in the above parameters which allow the production of polymorph B in varying granulations and yields, according to the desired storage, handling and manufacturing applications of the compound.  The solids were vacuum dried at a temperature below 50°C and the resultant product was milled to provide the polymorph B in usable form.<br><br>
Example 6 - Clinical studies utilizing treatment with the stable polymorph B form of [6 , 7-bis (2-methoxyethoxy) quinazolin-4-yl] -(3-ethynylphenyl) -amine hydrochloride .<br>
The stable polymorph B form of [6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)quinazolin-4-yl]-(3-ethynylphenyl)-amine hydrochloride is a potent, selective and orally active inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EFGR) protein-tyrosine kinase, an oncogene that has been associated with the aberrant growth that is characteristic of cancer cells. This compound is being evaluated in clinical trials in normal healthy volunteers and in cancer patients in order to assess its safety profile and effectiveness.<br>
Phase I Clinical Studies<br>
Phase I clinical studies of the stable polymorph B form of [6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)quinazolin-4-yl]-(3-ethynylphenyl)-amine hydrochloride have been effectively completed in volunteers, initially, and subsequently in cancer patients, at single doses ranging from 25-200 mg/day or 100-1600 mg/week. Data from these studies revealed no adverse events that were greater than moderate in severity for a dose of 150 mg/day. In a daily dosing regimen study the dose limiting toxicity at 200 mg/day was diarrhea. This observed side effect was effectively controlled at the 150mg daily dose level using Loperamide (Imodium®). The second adverse event observed in these studies, and most significant toxicity at 150 mg daily, was a monomorphic acneiform rash analogous to that reported for other EGFR inhibitor agents in clinical trials. This rash had an "above-waist" distribution including face, scalp, neck, arms, chest and back. The rash has a unique histopathology of PMN infiltration with mild epidermal hyperproliferation. It is not consistent with drug hypersensitivity nor does it appear to be a "named" dermatological condition. This rash has not been a significant impediment to patients staying on the Phase II trials. The stable polymorph B form of [6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)quinazolin-<br><br>
4-yl] -(3-ethynylphenyl)-amine hydrochloride has been tested in a total of 290 patients in Phase I and ongoing Phase II studies and demonstrates a well tolerated safety profile. Furthermore, preliminary evidence of effectiveness was observed in Phase I studies. For example, in one Phase I study of 28 patients, 8 patients remain alive over a year after inception of treatment and 12 patients remained alive from 9-22 months.<br>
In order to establish a suitable safety profile, the stable polymorph B form of [6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)quinazolin-4-yl]-(3-ethynylphenyl)-amine hydrochloride is also used at doses of 1-7000 mg/day, preferably 5-2500 mg/day, most preferably 5-200 mg/day, in Phase I clinical combination studies with one or more additional drugs or treatments, preferably selected from one of the following group - Taxol, Gemcitabine, Taxotere, Capcitabine, 5FU, Cisplatin, Temozolomide, radiation treatment, and chemoradiation treatment.<br>
Phase II and Phase III Clinical Studies<br>
Three Phase II single agent studies of the stable polymorph B form of [ 6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)quinazolin-4-yl]-(3-ethynylphenyl)-amine hydrochloride in refractory non-small cell lung cancer, advanced head and neck cancer and refractory ovarian cancer, at a 150 mg daily dose were initiated.<br>
Indications of single agent anti-tumor activity for the stable polymorph B form of [6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)quinazolin-4-yl]-(3-ethynylphenyl)-amine hydrochloride was seen in patients with advanced cancers in several different tumor types. For example, initial findings indicate that the stable polymorph B form of [6, 7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)quinazolin-4-yl]-(3-ethynylphenyl)-amine hydrochloride is a well-tolerated oral medication that is active as a monotherapy when administered to patients with advanced head and neck cancer. In preliminary results 3 patients had objective partial responses, while another 9 patients showed evidence  of  a  stabilization  of  their  disease status.  The<br><br>
acneiform rash, which is apparently characteristic of all the anti-EGFR inhibitors undergoing clinical testing, was reported in approximately 70% of the first group of patients in this study.<br>
The early data emerging from the 48 patient Phase II study in refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients also indicates the effectiveness of treatment with the stable polymorph B form of [6, 7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)quinazolin-4-yl]-(3-ethynylphenyl)-amine hydrochloride as a single agent anti¬tumor drug for NSCLC. Of the first 19 evaluable patients in the study, 5 had objective partial responses, while another 4 patients showed evidence of a stabilization of their disease status. Partial responses were observed in two patients who had been treated previously with two and three different chemotherapy regimens. Thus it appears that the stable polymorph B form of [6 , 7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)quinazolin-4-yl]-( 3-ethynylphenyl)-amine hydrochloride is a well tolerated, oral medication which is active in non-small cell lung cancer.<br>
Qualification criteria for the open label, single agent study required the patients to have failed platinum-based chemotherapy and to have tumors that are histopathologically confirmed to be EGFR positive. The primary endpoint in the study is response rate with stable disease and time-to-progression amongst the secondary end-points.<br>
Evidence of anti-tumor activity can also be seen in the patients with ovarian cancer in the on-going Phase II study. In preliminary results 2 patients had objective partial responses, while another 4 patients showed evidence of a stabilization of their disease status. Documented evidence of anti-tumor activity was also seen in other EGFR positive tumor types, including colorectal and renal cell carcinoma, from Phase I studies in cancer patients with multiple tumor types.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1.	A process for producing a crystalline polymorph of the hydrochloride salt of N-(3-ethynylphenyl)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)-4-quinazolinamine designated the B polymorph that exhibits an X-ray powder diffraction pattern having characteristic peaks expressed in degrees 2-theta at 6.26, 12.48, 13.39, 16.96, 20.20, 21.10. 22.98, 24.46, 25.14 and 26.91, said process comprises the step of recrystallizing	N-(3-ethynylphenyI)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)-4-quinazolinamine hydrochloride in a solvent comprising alcohol and water.<br>
2.	The process according to claim 1, wherein the recrystallization process for the production of the crystalline polymorph comprises the steps of:<br>
a) heating to reflux alcohol, water and the hydrochloride salt of N-(3-ethynylphenyl)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)-4-quinazolinamine so as to form a solution;<br>
b)	Cooling the solution to between about 65 and 70°C;<br>
c)	clarifying the solution; and<br>
d)	precipitating  polymorph  B   by   further  cooling  the  clarified solution.<br></td>
