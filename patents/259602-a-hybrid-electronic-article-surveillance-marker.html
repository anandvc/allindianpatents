				<td>The present invention relates to a hybrid electronic article surveillance marker.<br>
This application is related to, and claims priority under 35 USC §119(e) of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/634,121, filed on August S, 2000, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
1.   [     Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to electronic article surveillance systems (EAS) and markers for use therein. More particularly, the invention provides an integrated hybrid tag which can be detected by both a magnetic harmonic article surveillance system and a radio frequency article surveillance system.<br>
2.        Description of the Prior Art<br>
The problem of protecting articles of merchandise in stores against shoplifting has been the subject of numerous technical solutions. Among these solutions is securing a tag or marker to an article to be protected. The marker responds to an interrogation signal from transtnitting apparatus situated at an exit door of the store. A receiving coil on the opposite side of the exit door receives a signal produced by the marker in response to the interrogation signal. The presence of the response signal indicates that the marker has not been removed or deactivated by . the cashier, and that the article bearing it may not have been paid for or properly checked out.<br>
A number of different types of markers have been widely used. In one type, the functional portion of the marker consists of an electrical resonant circuit. "When placed in an electromagnetic field transmitted by the interrogation apparatus, the resonant circuit marker causes an increase in absorption of the transmitted signal in order to reduce the signal in the receiving coil. The detection of the signal level change indicates the presence of the marker. A commercially used marker of this type is operated at radio frequency (JRF) region, e.g., 8.2 MHz, and referred as an RF tag.<br>
A second type of marker consists of an elongated element of a ferromagnetic material having a high magnetic permeability placed adjacent to a second element of a ferromagnetic material having a higher coercivity than the first element. When subject to an electromagnetic radiation at an interrogation frequency, the marker causes high harmonics of the interrogation frequency to be developed in the receiving coil. Detection of such harmonics indicates the presence of the marker. Deactivation of the marker is accomplished by changing the magnetization state of the second element. Thus, when the marker is exposed to a dc magnetic field, the magnetization state in the second element changes and the amplitude of the harmonic chosen for detection is significantly changed. This change can be readily detected in the receiving coil. This is a typical magnetic harmonic EAS tag. A commonly used interrogation frequency for the harmonic tag is in the range of a few thousand Hertz.<br>
The most economic way to affix the anti-theft marker onto merchandise is during the manufacturing process on the production line. However, both the radio frequency tag and the magnetic harmonic tag described above are widely used in various retail stores. At the merchandise manufacturing stage, there is no knowledge of which store the merchandise is going to and what type of  detecting system will be used. As a result, the manufacturer would have to put both types of tags on the merchandise. Also, at the checkout counter of a retail store, the cashier would have to deactivate both tags to eliminate false alarm even though the store only uses one kind of detection system. Installing two separate markers at the merchandise manufacture would cause operational complications and overall cost increase.<br>
The object of this invention is to make a deactivatable hybrid marker that can be detected by both RF detection and harmonic detection systems. One type of a hybrid marker was disclosed in French Patent No. 2,701,146 issued in 1994. However, in that patent, the hybrid marker merely consists of two types of markers, i. e., an RF marker and a harmonic marker, arranged on one substrate. The RF part of the marker and the harmonic part of the marker are separated from each other in the proposed design. Also, there is no deactivation function designed.<br>
The present invention provides an integrated hybrid marker. The harmonic part of the marker is an active part of the RF resonant circuit. Also, the present hybrid marker can be deactivated in a single process.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides an integrated hybrid marker comprising a harmonic element made of a strip of a high magnetic permeability material which is inserted into a RF circuit as an active apart of the resonant circuit. The electrical contact between the element and the rest of the circuit is achieved by using conductive paste material. The deactivation of the marker is accomplished by employing another element of a magnetic material having a high coercivity.<br>
The present invention also provides a deactivatable marker which comprises at least one joint having a conductive paste material.<br>
When placed in a RF interrogation field, the hybrid marker causes an increase in absorption of the transmitted signal reducing the signal in the receiving coil of the RF surveillance system. When placed in an interrogation zone of a magnetic harmonic article surveillance system, the marker generates high harmonics of the interrogation frequency that can be detected by the receiver of the surveillance system. The hybrid marker cart be deactivated in both RF and harmonic functions by a single process.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION   Referring to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 of the drawings, an integrated hybrid marker was fabricated as follows:<br>
(1)	The RF circuit, made from conductive materials, preferably a copper or aluminum foil, is laid down on a suitable substrate, preferably an adhesive paper substrate 100;<br>
(2)	The deactivating elements 10, made of a high coercivity magnetic material, were also placed on the adhesive paper substrate 100;<br>
(3)	The harmonic elements 20, made of a material having a high magnetic<br>
 permeability, were then placed on top of the deactivating elements 10 to complete the circuit with the conductive foil 40. Two strips of amorphous metal material, made from Honeywell International Inc. METGLAS®2714A, for example, having a width of about 1 mm and a total length of about 76 mm were used; and<br>
(4)	The electrical contact between the conductive circuit 40 and the harmonic<br>
material 20, as well as between the harmonic materials, were made by<br>
utilizing a conductive paste 30, such as silver paint in this case.<br>
With regard to materials of construction for the conductive materials of the RF circuit, while metallic foil such as copper and aluminum foils are preferred comedies nonetheless be understood that any conductive material which fulfills the function described hereinafter can be used. Other metals, as well as metal alloys in the shape of wires, foils, strips, or other geometric forms are contemplated is being useful, it being only require that they operate as described hereinafter. Also, conductive films or pastes which generally can described as a conductive material embedded within a nonconductive matrix, typically a polymer, paint, or other composition can also be utilized. Similarly, with regard to the material of construction for the deactivating elements 10, any of those known in the art may be used. With regard to the suitable substrate 100, paper is conveniently used due to its low-cost, nonconductive nature, and that can easily shaped in the manner described turn after. Nevertheless, other materials including woven and nonwoven paper-like materials, films, sheets, can also be utilized. One such materials known as TYVEK (ex. DuPont) which is physically strong, nonconductive, and handled in a manner similar to paper. With regard to the material construction for the conductive paste 30, any suitable conductive paste which will perform the function described hereinafter can be used.<br>
For example, is contemplated that one or more conductive materials embedded or suspended in any nonconductive or poorly conductive matrix such as a polymer, paint or other composition can be used. With regard to the amorphous metal material, any former or grade-of amorphous metal can be used and to such of course can differ from the METGLAS@2714A described above.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the circuit of the present invention was then folded with another copper foil circuit. These two circuits were aligned face-to-face, and aplastic film 110 was placed between the two circuits. The plastic film is a dielectric material between the two circuits and functions as a capacitor of the RF resonance circuit. To secure the stable structure of the marker, double-sided adhesive plastic films were used. One line of the circuit, 120, was kept uncovered by the plastic film. And two such uncovered lines 120 in the opposite circuits were glued using conductive paste to complete the RF resonant circuit.<br>
The hybrid tag, or marker, was tested in both radio frequency (RF) and magnetic harmonic detection systems. In the RF detection system, a standard 8.2 MHz frequency was employed. When the marker was exposed to a RF filed within the interrogation zone, the signal in the receiver coil dropped by more than 30%. Under the same testing condition, a commercial RF tag showed a 55% reduction of the signal in the receiver coil.<br>
In the harmonic detection system, a fundamental frequency of 2,500 Hz was employed and the 25x harmonic was selected to detect. The hybrid marker generated a signal of 130 mV in the testing system. Fox comparison, a commercial harmonic tag was also tested by the same detection system. The commercial harmonic tag had a length of about 90 mm. The 25th harmonic signal of the commercial tag was about 250 mV under the same test condition.<br>
When deactivated by using a dc magnetic field, the strength of which was high enough to • saturate the harmonic marker, the hybrid marker did not show any detectable harmonic signal. Also the deactivated marker did not respond to the RF interrogation field. The signal in the receiver coil of the RF surveillance system did not change by the presence of a deactivated marker. Therefore, by applying a dc magnetic field, the hybrid marker was deactivated in both harmonic and RF functions. The deactivation mechanism of the RF function is such that electrical contact of amorphous metal material and copper circuit is disturbed during the magnetic deactivation. The contacts are made by conductive paint so that the mechanical and electrical links between the two parts are made strong enough to maintain the RF function intact<br>
prior to deactivation. Upon deactivation, a loose contact increases the electrical resistance of the RF circuit and drives the circuit out of the resonant condition at the interrogation frequency.<br>
The marker design described above, therefore, reduces .a true integrated hybrid, marker with a sufficiently high signal in both harmonic and Rf detection systems. Also the hybrid markers can be totally deactivated by a single process.<br>
Another way to make the hybrid marker is shown in FIGs. 3 and A of the drawings. First, the deactivation elements 10 and harmonic element 20 are placed on an adhesive paper substrate as described above. Then the RF circuit 50, as well as the electrical contacts with the amorphous metal part, is printed on the paper using a conductive paste. The two circuits of the same type are then folded together face to face with a plastic sheet in between. One aim of the circuit, 120, is not covered by the plastic sheet and is glued to the opposite side using conductive glued. In this way, the hybrid tag can be produced on a mass manufacturing scale..<br>
An economic way to manufacture a large quantity of the hybrid marker according to the present invention is described in FIG. 5. first, the Jong strips of a high-coercivity deactivation material, 3 0, are placed on the adhesive paper, 100. On top of the deactivation strip is a strip of harmonic material, 20, i.e., an amorphous metal material. Then the RF circuits, 50, are printed using conductive paste. The rest of the steps include folding them "with a plastic sheet in between, cutting them to individual pieces, and securing the electrical contact between the opposite sides to complete the RF resonant circuit The whole process can be accomplished on an automated production line.<br>
A further aspect of the invention provides a deactivatable marker which comprises at least one joint having a conductive paste material.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 6 and FIG. 7 of the drawings, such a marker is fabricated as •follows, or may have the following configuration:<br>
(1)	Portions of an RF circuit 40, made from conductive materials, preferably a copper or aluminum foil, is laid down on a suitable substrate, preferably an adhesive paper substrate 100;<br>
(2)	The deactivating elements 10, made of a high coercivity magnetic material, were also placed on the adhesive paper substrate 100;<br>
(3)	The RF circuit is completed by next providing a conductive paste 30, such as a silver paint at one or more convenient points, and subsequently remaining portions of the RF<br>
circuit 40, also made from conductive -materials, preferably a copper or aluminum foil, is laid down on so to contact the conductive paste 30, and thereby complete the RF circuit. According to this embodiment harmonie.'dements are not necessary, with the consequence that such markers are not expected to be useful in harmonic detection systems. However, these markers are expected to be very well suited to be used in RF detection systems such as discussed previously.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the circuit of the present invention may be folded with another RF circuit formed of a suitable conductive material. These two circuits are aligned face-to-face, and a plastic film 110 may be placed between the two circuits. The plastic film is a dielectric material between the two circuits and functions as a capacitor of the RF resonance circuit To secure the stable structure of the marker, double-sided adhesive plastic films were used, although other materials may also be used. One line of the circuit, 120, is kept unobscured by the plastic film; two such unobscured portions 120 in each of the two RF circuits are next glued using the aforementioned conductive paste in order to complete the RF resonant circuit.<br>
In use, these latter markers may also be deactivated by using a do magnetic field, the strength of which was high enough to saturate the harmonic marker. The deactivation mechanism  of the RF function is such that electrical contact between portions of the RF circuit is disturbed -or interrupted, as the conductive contacts made between portions of the RF circuit by the conductive paint are weakened or interrupted whereby the electrical resistance of the RF circuit is altered which drives the circuit out of the resonant condition at the interrogation frequency.<br>
The marker design described above, therefore, provides a true integrated hybrid marker with a sufficiently high signal in both harmonic and RF detection systems. Also, both the hybrid markers as well as the latter, non-hybrid RF markers can be totally deactivated by a single process.<br>
Having thus described the invention in rather full detail, it will be understood that such detail need not be strictly adhered to but that various changes and modifications may suggest themselves to one skilled in the art, all falling within the scope of the invention as defined by the subjoined claims.<br><br><br><br>
