This invention relates to functional colloids and a method<br>
for their manufacture.<br>
Colloids have been known for a long time. The can arise,<br>
for  example,  via  sol-gel  technique,  or  in  natural<br>
processes,  such  as  in  bodies  of  water  and  during<br>
condensation processes in the gas phase. It is typical for<br>
such colloids that they are only stable in an aqueous<br>
solution if prevented from aggregating via stabilizing<br>
factors. Aggregation can be initiated through interactions<br>
between the colloid particles,  e.g.,  via van-der-Waals<br>
forces, hydrogen bridges, hydrophobic interactions, dipole-<br>
dipole-interactions or chemical bonds. Given the extremely<br>
large  surface,  the  tendency  toward  aggregation  is<br>
particularly  great.  Colloidal  particle  normally  have<br>
dimensions not exceeding 0.2  m.<br>
In general, colloid stabilization takes place via a<br>
corresponding zeta potential, i.e., the formation of a dual<br>
charge cloud around the colloid. This can be caused by a<br>
varying electron affinity, or a charging of particles with<br>
ions or electrons, e.g., by setting the pH value. However,<br>
it can also take place via the agglomeration of specific<br>
molecules on the surface, e.g., via the agglomeration of<br>
humic acid in natural bodies of water. However, all of<br>
these processes assume that the colloids have been<br>
generated by a preceding reaction, and that conditions<br>
leading to such a stabilization have been established in<br>
the environment of the colloid.<br>
While other methods for manufacturing small particles,<br>
e.g., high-energy milling, shatter the crystalline<br>
structure down to nanoscale proportions, they cannot<br>
prevent subsequent aggregation. Such aggregated particles,<br>
which  are  in  part  also  manufactured  via  targeted<br><br>
- 2<br>
condensation from gas phases,  can only be deaggregated<br>
under specific conditions. For example, metal particles<br>
have been successfully dispersed in oil, since the oil can<br>
shift between weakly interacting metal surfaces. However,<br>
weakly interacting metal surfaces are only obtained if the<br>
metal particles are fabricated in a high vacuum,  i.e.,<br>
under ultra-pure conditions, so that no oxide surface is<br>
formed. If this is not the case, it becomes practically<br>
impossible to disperse the particles any longer. In the<br>
aforementioned high-energy milling process, a redispersion<br>
to primary crystallite size is hence no longer possible.<br>
As shown above for metal particles redispersible in oil,<br>
such systems can only be controlled from a process<br>
standpoint in exceptional cases. Process control requires a<br>
method that sets the colloid particles during manufacture<br>
in such a way that they satisfy the respective process-<br>
related requirements. In this way, it would be possible to<br>
impart the desired properties or functions to the colloid<br>
particles during manufacture. For example, it would be<br>
possible to stabilize, compatibilize, intertize or<br>
reactivate the colloid particles relative to the<br>
environment.<br>
Commercially available milling aggregates commonly only<br>
make it possible to obtain particles in the submicrometer<br>
range, and even that only with so-called milling aids,<br>
which prevent freshly generated fractured surfaces from<br>
recombining again. Comminution to colloidal dimensions, in<br>
particular to a range of 0.002 to 0.05 m, is generally not<br>
possible.<br>
The object according to the invention was now to fabricate<br>
colloids that exhibit an outstanding stability relative to<br>
aggregation, wherein the colloid particles can be extremely<br>
small (preferably under 0.2 m, in particular under 0.05<br>
m) , and the properties or functions of the colloid or<br><br>
- 3<br>
colloid particles can be adjusted to the respective<br>
requirements. Surprisingly, the object according to the<br>
invention could be achieved by using a chemomechanical<br>
reactive comminution process to realize a<br>
functionalization, accompanied simultaneously by<br>
stabilization relative to an aggregation of the obtained<br>
colloid particles.<br>
Accordingly, this invention provides a method for the<br>
chemomechanical manufacture of a functional colloid, in<br>
which particles are subjected to mechanical reactive<br>
comminution in a dispersant in the presence of a modifying<br>
agent, so that the modifying agent is at least partially<br>
chemically bound to the comminuted colloid particles.<br>
According  to  the  invention,  generally  low-molecular<br>
modifying agents that can enter into a chemical bond with<br>
the particles are used in milling aggregates or other<br>
dispersing aggregates to generate functional colloids out<br>
of particles,  which exhibit molecular residues of the<br>
modifying agent rigidly bound with the surface of the<br>
particles  as  functional  groups,  wherein  the  average<br>
smallest dimension of the functionalized particles can<br>
extend as far down to 0.01 and even 0.002  m, if needed.<br>
The method according to the invention makes it possible to<br>
obtain stable colloids with average smallest dimensions<br>
preferably  not  exceeding  0.2   m  from  coarse-grained<br>
particles.   Modifying   the   colloid   particles   with<br>
comparatively small molecules that can rapidly diffuse on<br>
the  newly  formed  surfaces  prevents  or  inhibits  an<br>
aggregation,  while  at  the  same  time  resulting  in  a<br>
functionalization of  the  colloid or colloid particles<br>
tailored to the respective requirements.<br>
The used particles are solid particles made out of any<br>
suitable material. For example, they can be organic (or<br>
polymer)   or  inorganic  particles,  wherein  inorganic<br><br>
- 4<br>
particles are preferred. Examples of inorganic particles<br>
include particles consisting of an element, an alloy or an<br>
element compound. The inorganic particles preferably<br>
consist of metals, alloys and in particular of metal<br>
compounds and semiconductor element compounds, e.g., Si or<br>
Ge, or boron.<br>
Examples for particles from an element are particles from<br>
carbon,  like  soot  or  activated  charcoal,  from  a<br>
semiconductor,  like  silicon  (including  industrial  Si,<br>
ferrosilicon and pure silicon) or germanium or a metal such<br>
as iron  (also steel),  chromium,  tin,  copper,  aluminum,<br>
titanium, gold and zinc. Examples of particles from an<br>
alloy include particles from bronze or brass.<br>
Examples for preferred metal compounds and compounds of<br>
semiconductor elements or boron include  (if necessary,<br>
hydratized)  oxides,  such as ZnO,  CdO,  SiO2, GeO2, TiO2,<br>
ZrO2/ CeO2, SnO2, A12O3 (in all modifications, in particular<br>
as  a  corundum,  bomite,  AlO(OH),  also  as  aluminum<br>
hydroxide) , In2O3, La2O3, Fe2O3, Cu2O, Ta2O5, Nb2O5, V2O5, MoO3<br>
or WO3, corresponding mixed oxides, e.g., indium tin oxide<br>
(ITO), antimony-tin oxide (ATO), fluorine-doped tine oxide<br>
(FTO) and those with a perowskite structure, such as BaTiO3<br>
and PbTiO3, chalcogenides, for example sulfides (e.g., CdS,<br>
ZnS, PbS and Ag2S) , selenides (e.g., GaSe, CdSe and ZnSe)<br>
and tellurides (e.g., ZnTe or CdTe), halogenides, such as<br>
AgCl, AgBr, Agl, CuCl, CuBr, Cdl2 and Pbl2, carbides, such<br>
as CdC2 or SiC, silicides, such as MoSi2, arsenides, such<br>
as  AlAs,  GaAs  and GeAs,  antimonides,  such  as  InSb,<br>
nitrides, such as BN, AlN, Si3N4 and Ti3N4, phosphides, such<br>
as GaP,  InP,  Zn3P2  and Cd3P2,  as well  as  carbonates,<br>
sulfates, phosphates, silicates, zirconates, aluminates and<br>
stannates of elements,  in particular of metals or Si.,<br>
e.g., carbonates of calcium and/or magnesium, silicates,<br>
such as alkali silicates, talcum, clays(kaolin) or mica,<br>
and sulfates of barium or calcium.  Other examples of<br><br>
- 5<br>
expedient particles include magnetite, maghemite, spinelles<br>
(e.g., MgO.Al2O3) , mullite, eskolaite, tialite, SiO2.TiO2,<br>
or bioceramics, e.g., calcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite.<br>
They can also be particles made of glass or ceramics.<br>
They can also be particles that are usually used to<br>
manufacture glass  (e.g.,  borosilicate glass,  soda-lime<br>
glass or silica glass), glass ceramics or ceramics (e.g.,<br>
based on the oxides SiO2, BeO, A12O3, ZrO2 or MgO or the<br>
corresponding mixed oxides, electro- and magnetoceramics,<br>
such as titanates and ferrites, or non-oxide ceramics, such<br>
as  silicon  nitride,  silicon  carbide,  boronitride  or<br>
borocarbide). The particles can also serve as fillers or<br>
pigments.  Technically important fillers  include fillers<br>
based on SiO2,  such as quartz, cristobalite,  tripolite,<br>
novaculite,  diatomite,  silica,  pyrogenic silicic acids,<br>
precipitated silicic acids and silica gels, silicates, such<br>
as   talcum,   pyrophyllite,   kaolin,   mica,   muscovite,<br>
phlogopite,   vermiculite,   wollastonite   and   perlite,<br>
carbonates,  such  as  calcites,  dolomites,  chalk  and<br>
synthetic calcium carbonates, soot, sulfates, such as light<br>
spar  and  heavy  spar,  iron  mica,  glasses,  aluminum<br>
hydroxides, aluminum oxides and titanium dioxide.<br>
Mixtures of these particles can also be used. Especially<br>
preferred materials for the particles are metal oxides,<br>
silicon oxides and silicates, in particular talcum, ZrO2,<br>
A12O3, TiO2 and SiO2 or mixtures thereof.<br>
The particles used according to the invention can be<br>
manufactured in a conventional manner, e.g., via flame<br>
pyrolysis, plasma procedures, gas-phase condensation<br>
procedures, colloid techniques, precipitation procedures,<br>
sol-gel processes, controlled nucleation and growth<br>
processes, MOCVD processes and (micro)emulsion procedures.<br>
These methods are extensively described in the literature.<br>
In particular, use can be made of metals (e.g., after the<br><br>
- 6<br>
reduction of the precipitation procedure), ceramic oxide<br>
systems (via deposition from solution), along with salt-<br>
like systems or multi-component systems.<br>
The useable particles are generally frequently available on<br>
the market as well. Examples of SiO2 particles include<br>
commercially available silicic acid products, e.g., silica<br>
sols, such as Levasile , silica sols from Bayer AG, or<br>
pyrogenic silicic acids, e.g., the Aerosil products from<br>
Degussa. Of course, all particles to be used as fillers can<br>
normally be procured on the market.<br>
The particles can be used in the form of a powder or<br>
directly as a dispersion in a dispersant. The particles can<br>
also be obtained in the dispersant via the deposition of a<br>
dissolved prestage in situ.<br>
The particle size of the used particles generally exceeds<br>
that of the colloid particles obtained via the method<br>
according to the invention. Even though the particle size<br>
of the used particles can be selected as desired, particles<br>
with an average particle diameter of less than 100 m,<br>
preferably less than 10 m, and an average particle<br>
diameter exceeding 0.001 m, preferably exceeding 0.01 m,<br>
are expedient.<br>
The dispersant can be any solvent desired, provided it does<br>
not or essentially does not dissolve the particles to be<br>
treated, and is also inert or essentially inert relative to<br>
the used modifying agent. The suitable dispersant is<br>
preferably selected form water or organic solvents,<br>
depending on the particles to be treated, but inorganic<br>
solvents are also possible, such as carbon disulfide.<br>
One particularly preferred dispersant  is water,  e.g.,<br>
deionized water. Suitable organic dispersants include both<br>
polar and nonpolar and aprotic solvents. Examples include<br><br>
- 7<br>
alcohols, e.g., aliphatic and alicyclic alcohols with 1 to<br>
8 carbon atoms (in particular methanol, ethanol, n- and i-<br>
propanol, butanol, octanol, cyclohexanol) , ketones, e.g.,<br>
aliphatic and alicyclic ketones with 1 to 8 carbon atoms<br>
(in  particular  acetone,  butanone  and  cyclohexanone),<br>
etsters, e.g., acetic acid ethyl esters and glycol esters,<br>
ethers,  e.g.,  diethyl  ether,  dibutyl  ether,  anisol,<br>
dioxane,  tetrahydrofurane  and  tetrahydropyrane,  glycol<br>
ethers,  such as mono,  di,  tri and polyglycol ethers,<br>
glycols, such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol and<br>
propylene glycol,  amides and other nitrogen compounds,<br>
e.g., dimethyl acetamide, dimethyl formamide, pyridine, N-<br>
methylpyrrolidine   and   acetonitrile,   sulfoxides   and<br>
sulfones,  e.g.,  sulfolan and dimethyl sulfoxide,  nitro<br>
compounds, such as nitrobenzene, halogen hydrocarbons, such<br>
as  dichloromethane,  chloroform,  tetrachlorocarbon,  tri,<br>
tetrachloroethene, ethylene chloride, chlorofluorocarbons,<br>
aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g., with 5<br>
to 15 carbon atoms, e.g., pentane, hexane, heptane and<br>
octane,    cyclohexane,    benzine,    petroleum    ether,<br>
methylcyclohexane,  decalin,  terpene  solvents,  benzene,<br>
toluene  and  xylenes.  Of  course,  mixtures  of  such<br>
dispersants can also be used.<br>
Preferably used organic dispersants include aliphatic and<br>
alicyclic alcohols, such as n- and i-propanol, glycols,<br>
such as ethylene glycol, and aliphatic, alicyclic and<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons, such as hexane, heptane, toluene and<br>
o-, m- and p-xylene. Particularly preferred dispersants are<br>
ethanol and toluene.<br>
The particles are subjected to mechanical reactive<br>
comminution in the dispersant in the presence of a<br>
modifying agent, i.e., mechanical comminution is<br>
accompanied by a chemical binding of the modifying agent to<br>
the particles or comminuted particles in a chemical<br>
reaction. Such a reaction under a mechanical load is also<br><br>
- 8<br>
referred to as a chemomechanical reaction. As known to the<br>
expert, the surface of particles usually has groups that<br>
cannot be found in this form inside the particles. These<br>
surface groups usually involve functional groups, which are<br>
generally relatively reactive. For example, such particles<br>
have surface groups like residual valences, e.g., hydroxy<br>
groups and oxy groups, e.g., in the case of metal oxide<br>
particles, or thiol groups and thio groups, e.g., in the<br>
case of metal sulfides, or amino-, amide- and imide groups,<br>
e.g., in the case of nitrides.<br>
In particular, the modifying agent has a functional group<br>
that can enter into a chemical bond with the surface groups<br>
of the particles, at least under conditions of mechanical<br>
comminution. The chemical bond preferably involves a<br>
covalent, ionic or a coordinative bond between the<br>
modifying agent and the particle, but can also be hydrogen<br>
bridge bonds. Coordinative bonds are understood to a<br>
complex formation. For example, an acid/base reaction<br>
according to Bronsted or Lewis, complex formation or<br>
esterification can take place between the functional groups<br>
of the modifying agent and the particles.<br>
The functional group encompasses the modifying agent, and<br>
preferably involves carbonic acid groups, acid chloride<br>
groups, ester groups, nitrile and isonitrile groups, OH<br>
groups, SH groups, epoxide groups, anhydride groups, acid<br>
amide groups, primary, secondary and tertiary amino groups,<br>
Si-OH groups, hydrolysable residues of silanes (the<br>
following described Si-OR groups) or C-H acid groupings, as<br>
in -dicarbonyl compounds.<br>
The modifying agent can also encompass more than one such<br>
functional group, e.g., in betaines, amino acids, EDTA.<br><br>
- 9<br>
In one variant of the method according to the invention,<br>
the used modifying agent can simultaneously also serve as a<br>
dispersant, so that the same bond can be used for both.<br>
The modifying agents are not surfactants. This means that<br>
the modifying agent in the solvent used as the dispersant<br>
is unable  to form micelles,  even when used in high<br>
concentrations. The modifying agent used according to the<br>
invention,  which differs  from a surfactant,  dissolves<br>
homogeneously in the solvent used as the dispersant. The<br>
modifying agents then are present as discrete molecules or<br>
molecule ions, homogeneously distributed in the solution.<br>
By contrast,  surfactants in a solvent accumulate at an<br>
interface at a low concentration, lower the interfacial<br>
tension, and at high concentrations form micelles, meaning<br>
that  they  are  heterogeneously  distributed.  The  above<br>
information relates to the behavior in a pure dispersant.<br>
In  the  presence  of  particles,  the  modifying  agents<br>
naturally enter into the chemical interactions with the<br>
particles as described in the invention.<br>
While the modifying agents at least in part enter into<br>
covalent, ionic or coordinative chemical bonds with the<br>
surface groups of the particles as indicated above, the<br>
interactions of surfactants are generally less specific,<br>
e.g., typically involve adsorption or wetting interactions.<br>
In addition to the at least one functional group that can<br>
enter into a chemical bond with the surface group of the<br>
particle, the modifying agent generally has a molecular<br>
residue, which modifies the properties of the particle<br>
after linking the modifying agent via the functional group.<br>
The molecular residue, or a portion thereof, can be<br>
hydrophobic or hydrophilic, for example, or carry a second<br>
functional group, so as to in this way functionalize the<br>
colloid particles relative to the environment, i.e., e.g.,<br>
stabilize, compatibilize, intertize or reactivate. In this<br><br>
- 10<br>
way, the colloid particles obtained according to the<br>
invention are provided by this molecular residue with a<br>
function or surface functionalization. In this sense, the<br>
colloids from the colloid particles modified with the<br>
modifying agent or surface modifying agent involve<br>
functional colloids. The invention makes it possible to<br>
obtain functional colloids tailored to the desired<br>
application. Depending on the system, covalent bonds, ionic<br>
bonds and complex bonds can be present as principles for<br>
coupling to the particles, while hydrogen bridge bonds are<br>
also suitable.<br>
Hydrophobic molecular residues can include alkyl,  aryl,<br>
alkaryl, aralkyl or fluorine-containing alkyl groups, which<br>
can lead to intertization or rejection given a suitable<br>
environment.  Examples  for hydrophilic  groups  would be<br>
hydroxy-,  alkoxy- or polyether groups.  If present,  the<br>
second functional group of the modifying agent can be an<br>
acid, base or ionic group. It can also be a functional<br>
group suitable for a chemical reaction with a selected<br>
reactant. Since the second functional group can be the same<br>
as the one also suitable as a functional group for binding<br>
to the particle, reference is made to the examples cited<br>
there. Other examples for a second functional group include<br>
epoxide, acryloxy-, methacryloxy-, acrylate or methacrylate<br>
groups. There can be two or more identical or different<br>
functional groups of this kind.<br>
The modifying agent preferably has a molecular weight not<br>
exceeding 500, more preferably not exceeding 400, and<br>
especially not exceeding 200. The bonds are preferably<br>
liquid under normal conditions. The functional groups that<br>
carry these bonds primarily depend on the surface groups of<br>
the solid particles and the desired interaction with the<br>
environment. The molecular weight also plays an important<br>
role with respect to diffusion on the freshly formed<br>
particle  surfaces.  Small molecules  result  in a rapid<br><br>
- 11<br>
occupation   of   the   surface,   thereby   preventing<br>
recombination.<br>
Hence,  examples  of  suitable  modifying  agents  include<br>
saturated or unsaturated mono- and polycarbonic acids, the<br>
corresponding acid anhydrides, acid chlorides, esters and<br>
acid amides, amino acids, imines, nitriles, isonitriles,<br>
epoxy  compounds,  mono-  and  polyamines,   -dicarbonyl<br>
compounds,  silanes and metal  compounds,  which have a<br>
functional group that can interact with the surface groups<br>
of the particles. Particularly preferred modifying agents<br>
include silanes, carbonic acids, amino acids and amines.<br>
The carbon chains of these compounds can be interrupted by<br>
O-, S- or NH-groups. One or more modifying agents can be<br>
used.<br>
Preferred saturated or unsaturated mono- and polycarbonic<br>
acids (preferably monocarbonic acids) are ones with 1 to 24<br>
carbon atoms, e.g., formic acid, acetic acid, propionic<br>
acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, caproic acid, acrylic<br>
acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, citric acid, adipic<br>
acid,  succinic acid, glutaric acid, oxalic acid, maleic<br>
acid, fumaric acid, itoconic acid and stearic acid, as well<br>
as the corresponding acid hydrides, chlorides, esters and<br>
amides,  e.g.,  caprolactam.  The  aforementioned carbonic<br>
acids  also  encompass  those  whose  carbon  chains  are<br>
interrupted by O-, S- or NH-groups. Especially preferred<br>
are ether carbonic acids,  such as mono- and polyether<br>

The silanes can be manufactured according to known methods;<br>
see W. Noll, "Chemistry and Technology of Silicones",<br>
Verlag Chemie GmbH, Weinheim/Bargstra e (1968).<br>
Examples for metal compounds that have a functional group<br>
include metal compounds of a metal M from the primary<br>
groups III to V and/or the secondary groups II to IV of the<br>
periodic table of elements. Compounds of Al, Ti or Zr are<br>
preferred. Examples include RGMX4-C (M=Ti or Zr and c=l, 2,<br>
3) , wherein X and R are defined as above in formula (I) ,<br>
wherein one R or several R's in conjunction can also stand<br>
for a complexing agent, e.g., a  -dicarbonyl compound or a<br>
(mono)carbonic    acid.     Zirconium    and    titanium<br>
tetraalcoholates are here preferred, in which ha portion of<br>
the alkoxy groups has been replaced by a complexing agent,<br>
e.g.,  a   -dicarbonyl  compound  or  a  carbonic  acid,<br>
preferably a monocarbonic acid.<br>
The substances used according to the invention can be mixed<br>
together in any sequence desired. Mixing can take place<br>
directly in the comminution machine, or beforehand in a<br>
separate container, e.g., a mixer. Otherwise, no further<br>
additives are preferably added, i.e., the mixture to be<br>
subjected to reactive comminution consists of at least one<br>
dispersant,  at  least  one  modifying  agent,  which  can<br>
coincide with the dispersant in special instances, and the<br>
particles, which preferably are particles consisting of<br>
only a single material. Examples of additives that can be<br>
added as desired include antifoaming agent, pressing aid,<br>
organic   binders,   photocatalysts,   preservatives   and<br>
rheological additives. Additives need only be supplied if<br>
required for further processing. Therefore, these additives<br>
can also be supplied after processing according to the<br>
invention. One advantage to prior addition may lie in the<br>
homogeneous mixture obtained by milling.<br><br>
- 17<br>
During the execution of  the method according to the<br>
invention, the content of particles depends heavily on the<br>
type of particle, but generally measures up to 60 %v/v of<br>
the suspension, normally ranging between 50 and 0.5 %v/v,<br>
preferably between 30 and 1 %v/v, in particular between 25<br>
and 2.5 %v/v of the dispersion. The remaining suspension<br>
consists of dispersants and modifying agents. The weight<br>
ratio between the particles and modifying agents here<br>
generally measures 100:1 to 100:35, in particular 100:2 to<br>
100:25, and especially preferred 100:4 to 100:20.<br>
The quantity ratio of particles to milling elements present<br>
in the milling chamber is inevitably derived from the solid<br>
content of the suspension and the used fill level of<br>
milling balls and the bulk density of the milling balls.<br>
Mechanical comminution generally takes place in mills,<br>
kneaders, cylinder mills or, for example, in high-velocity<br>
dispersers. Suitable comminution machines for mechanical<br>
comminution include homogenizers,  turbo-agitators,  mills<br>
with loose milling implements, such as ball, rod, drum,<br>
cone, tube, autogenous, planetary, vibration and agitating<br>
mills, heavy roller kneader, mortar mills, colloid mills<br>
and cylinder mills. Comminution, which can involve milling<br>
and  homogenizing,   preferably  takes  place  at  room<br>
temperature. The duration depends on the type of mixing,<br>
and the used comminution machine.<br>
Mills with loose milling implements are preferably used.<br>
The milling implements or milling bodies can be balls, rods<br>
or short cylindrical pieces,  for example. The container<br>
performs a rotating, planetary or agitating motion,  for<br>
example, or the milling bodies are moved with an agitator.<br>
Especially preferred mills are agitating ball mills with a<br>
moving agitator and milling balls as the milling bodies.<br><br>
- 21<br>
wherein little or no aggregation takes place, so that the<br>
average particle diameter can essentially be retained.<br>
The functional colloids or functional colloid particles can<br>
be further processed via methods known to the expert. For<br>
example, it can be reacted with other surface modifiers,<br>
dispersed in organic or aqueous solvents,  and soluble<br>
polymers,  oligomers  or  organic  monomers  or  sols  or<br>
additives, e.g., of the kind mentioned above, can be added.<br>
Such mixtures, preparations or the functional colloids or<br>
the very functional colloid particles according to the<br>
invention can be used to manufacture coatings or in other<br>
applications, for example.<br>
Examples for the use of functional colloids, functional<br>
colloid particles or mixtures encompassing these functional<br>
colloids or functional colloid particles include the<br>
manufacture of ceramic moldings, films, membranes and<br>
coatings, or of polymer matrix compounds. The coatings or<br>
layers can be used for a wide variety of purposes, e.g.,<br>
coatings with low-energy surfaces or abrasion-proof<br>
microbicides, photocatalytic, microstructurable or<br>
microstructured, holographic, conductive, UV-absorbing,<br>
photochromic and/or electrochromic layers.<br>

Mills with very small milling bodies are preferably used,<br>
which enables the application of small-dimensional shearing<br>
forces. The finest dispersing step is preferably performed<br>
using milling bodies having a diameter not exceeding 2.5<br>
mm,  preferably not  exceeding  1.5  mm,  and  especially<br>
preferred not exceeding 1.0 mm, and measuring no less than<br>
0.05 mm, preferably no less than 0.07 mm, and especially<br>
preferred no less than 0.09 mm. The milling bodies normally<br>
consist  of  steel,  plastic,  hard metal,  A12O3,  agate,<br>
zirconium silicate, ZrO2, YZrO2, Ce-ZrO2, glass, SiC, SiN or<br>
mixtures of these materials, wherein especially preferred<br>
milling body materials are stabilized zirconium oxides,<br>
zirconium silicate and steel.<br>
Comminution can also take place in two or more stages. For<br>
example, it can involve a preceding comminution (pre-<br>
comminution) and subsequent finest comminution, wherein the<br>
modifying agents can be present in each stage or in at<br>
least one stage, e.g., the last one. For example, milling<br>
with milling bodies can be preceded by a milling step with<br>
coarser milling bodies to achieve the optimal, efficient<br>
initial particle size for the finest comminution step.<br>
The preferred particle size (average diameter or average<br>
smallest dimension) for the finest comminution step<br>
measures 30 to 1,000 nm, preferably 50 to 500 nm, and<br>
especially preferred 60 to 150 nm.<br>
Depending on the design of the used comminution machine, in<br>
particular of a mill, fill levels of 50 to 100% are used<br>
for milling bodies, for example, wherein fill levels<br>
preferably measure 60 to 98%, especially preferably 70 to<br>
95%.<br>
The comminution process in agitating ball mills takes place<br>
at agitator speeds of 900 to 5,000 RPM, for example, with<br><br>
- 19<br>
speeds of 1,000 to 4,500 RPM being preferred, and speeds of<br>
2,000-4,200 RPM being especially preferred.<br>
The milling duration depends in particular on the type of<br>
used particles, and can last several minutes up to days,<br>
e.g., 10 minutes to 5 days, preferably between 1 hour and<br>
12 hours.<br>
Reactive comminution can be supported through additional<br>
energy supply (combined with the mechanical energy), e.g.,<br>
microwave and/or ultrasound, wherein these two methods can<br>
also be used simultaneously. It is especially preferred to<br>
supply energy to the dispersion process directly in the<br>
comminution machine, but this can also take place outside<br>
of the comminution machine in the product circulation.<br>
The method according to the invention is preferably carried<br>
out at room temperature (approx. 20 C) up to the boiling<br>
point of the dispersing medium. Suitable temperature<br>
moderation (cooling) of the milling chamber of the mill<br>
makes it possible to set these corresponding operating<br>
temperatures.<br>
The method can be used both continuously in the single-pass<br>
mode, multi-pass mode (oscillating process) or circular<br>
process, as well as continuously in the batch mode.<br>
Reactive comminution according to the invention chemically<br>
binds the modifying agent to the comminuted particles. At<br>
least a portion of the used modifying agent molecules are<br>
here bound to the particles. The percentage that becomes<br>
chemically bound depends on the type of particles, the used<br>
quantity in relation to the particles, the obtained size,<br>
and hence the available particle surface.<br>
Combining the use of modifying agents  and mechanical<br>
comminution according to the invention makes it possible to<br><br>
- 20<br>
generate functional colloids that have chemical compounds<br>
rigidly bound to the colloid particles. This enables the<br>
fabrication of colloid particles of a smallest dimension<br>
extending even as far down as 0.01 to 0.002 m.<br>
The average smallest dimension (average diameter, average<br>
height or width) of the particles manufactured in the<br>
method according to the invention must not exceed 0.2 m,<br>
preferably not exceed 0.1 m, and especially preferred not<br>
exceed 0.05 m. If needed, comminution can even yield<br>
particles with an average smallest dimension not exceeding<br>
0.01, and even one exceeding 0.002 m.<br>
The average smallest dimension the average particle<br>
diameter for spherical particles, and the average height<br>
for plate-like particles. In this description, average<br>
particle diameter is understood to be the d50 value of<br>
volume distribution. The expert is aware of methods for<br>
determining these particle sizes, along with details<br>
relating to these methods. Examples for suitable measuring<br>
procedures include dynamic laser light scattering (e.g.,<br>
with an ultrafine particle analyzer (UPA)), X-ray disk<br>
centrifuging or quantitative image analysis of electron<br>
microscopic photographs.<br>
If desired, functional colloid particles usable as powder<br>
can be obtained from the resultant functional colloid by<br>
removing the dispersant. Any method known to the expert can<br>
be used for removal purposes, e.g., evaporation,<br>
centrifugation or filtration. In another separation method,<br>
the expert uses known methods to set the isoelectric point<br>
in order to obtain a flocculation that can then be filtered<br>
out. The surface of the obtained functional colloid<br>
particles has the chemically bound modifying agent<br>
molecules, the functionality of which can be used to<br>
control the particle properties. The colloid particles can<br>
then be absorbed again in the same or another dispersant,<br><br>
