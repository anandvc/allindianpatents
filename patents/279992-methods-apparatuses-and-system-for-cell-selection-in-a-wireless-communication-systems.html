				<td>BACKGROUND<br>
I.	Field<br>
[0002]	The following description relates generally to wireless communications<br>
and, more particularly, to determining a cell for use based upon signal-to-noise ratio and<br>
II.	Background<br>
[0003]	Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various<br>
types of communication content such as, for example, voice, data, and so on. Typical<br>
wireless communication systems can be multiple-access systems capable of supporting<br>
communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (e.g.,<br>
bandwidth, transmit power, ...). Examples of such multiple-access systems can include<br>
code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA)<br>
systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency<br>
division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, and the like.<br>
[0004]	Generally, wireless multiple-access communication systems can<br>
simultaneously support communication for multiple mobile devices. Each mobile device can communicate with one or more base stations via transmissions on forward and reverse links. The forward link (or downlink) refers to the communication link from base stations to mobile devices, and the reverse link (or uplink) refers to the communication link from mobile devices to base stations. Further, communications between mobile devices and base stations can be established via single-input single-output (SISO) systems, multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, and so forth.<br>
[0005]	MIMO systems commonly employ multiple (NT) transmit antennas and<br>
multiple (NR) receive antennas for data transmission. A MIMO channel formed by the NT transmit and NR receive antennas can be decomposed into Ns independent channels,<br>
 <br>
which can be referred lo as spatial channels, where Ns 
independent channels corresponds to a dimension. Moreover, MIMO systems can provide improved performance (e.g., increased spectral efficiency, higher throughput and/or greater reliability) if the additional dimensionalities created by the multiple transmit and received antennas are utilized.<br>
[0006]	MIMO systems can support various duplexing techniques to divide<br>
forward and reverse link communications over a common physical medium. For instance, frequency division duplex (FDD) systems can utilize disparate frequency regions for forward and reverse link communications. Further, in time division duplex (TDD) systems, forward and reverse link communications can employ a common frequency region. However, conventional techniques can provide limited or no feedback related to channel information.<br>

[0038]	Referring now to Fig. 1, a wireless communication system 100 is<br>
illustrated in accordance with various embodiments presented herein. System 100 comprises a base station 102 that can include multiple antenna groups. For example, one antenna group can include antennas 104 and 106, another group can comprise antennas 108 and 110, and an additional group can include antennas 112 and 114. Two antennas are illustrated for each antenna group; however, more or fewer antennas can be utilized for each group, Base station 102 can additionally include a transmitter chain and a receiver chain, each of which can in turn comprise a plurality of components associated with signal transmission and reception (e.g., processors, modulators, multiplexers, demodulators, demultiplexers, antennas, etc.), as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art.<br>
[0039]	Base station 102 can communicate with one or more mobile devices such<br>
as mobile device 116 and mobile device 122; however, it is to be appreciated that base station 102 can communicate with substantially any number of mobile devices similar to mobile devices 116 and 122. Mobile devices 116 and 122 can be, for example, cellular phones, smart phones, laptops, handheld communication devices, handheld computing devices, satellite radios, global positioning systems, PDAs, and/ov any other suitable device for communicating over wireless communication system 100. As depicted,<br>
 <br>
mobile device 116 is in communication with antennas 112 and 114, where antennas 112<br>
and 114 transmit information to mobile device 116 over a forward link 118 and receive<br>
information from mobile device I16 over a reverse link 120. Moreover, mobile device<br>
122 is in communication with antennas 104 and 106, where antennas 104 and 106<br>
transmit information to mobile device 122 over a forward link 124 and receive<br>
information from mobile device 122 over a reverse link 126. In a frequency division<br>
duplex (FDD) system, forward link 118 can utilize a different frequency band than that<br>
used by reverse link 120. and forward link 124 can employ a different frequency band<br>
than that employed by reverse link 126, for example. Further, in a time division duplex<br>
(TDD) system, forward link 118 and reverse link 120 can utilize a common frequency<br>
band and forward link 124 and reverse link 126 can utilize a common frequency band.<br>
[0040]	The set of antennas and/or the area in which they are designated to<br>
communicate can be referred to as a sector of base station 102. For example, multiple antennas can be designed to communicate to mobile devices in a sector of the areas covered by base station 102. In communication over forward links 118 and 124, the transmitting antennas of base station 102 can utilize beamforming to improve signal-to-noise ratio of forward links 118 and 124 for mobile devices 116and 122. Also, while base station 102 utilizes beamforming to transmit to mobile devices 116 and 122 scattered randomly through an associated coverage, mobile devices in neighboring cells can be subject to less interference as compared to a base station transmitting through a single antenna to all its mobile devices.<br>
[0041]	Now referring to Fig. 2, an example system 200 is disclosed for<br>
facilitating wireless communication. In conventional wireless communication configurations, there is one frequency available and thus the available frequency is used in communication. However, with multiple frequencies, a device can select a frequency to use during communication. To select a frequency (e.g., and a cell to use to communicate upon the frequency), signal-to-noise ratio or signal-to-power ratio can be measured and a highest ranking cell is selected for communication pertaining to both metrics. The system 200 enables signal-to-noise ratio as well as signal-to-power ratio to be taken into account in cell selection.<br>
[0042]	Differently than for intra-frequency cell reselection where Ec/No (signal-<br>
to-noise ratio) and RSCP (Reference symbol received power - otherwise known as signal-to-power ratio) can be used interchangeably as FDD (Frequency Division<br>
 <br>
Duplex) quality measure for cell reseleclion ranking (2 quantities could give a same ranking result since RSSI (Received signal strength indicator) is the same for all intra-frequency cells), inter-frequency cell reseleclion ranking can significantly change depending on which measurement quantity is used, since RSSI on the 2 frequencies can be different. Similar considerations can apply to LTE (Long Term Evolution), when there is consideration that inter-frequency cell reseleclion could be based on either RS-SINR (Reference symbol signal to interference plus noise ratio - otherwise known as signal-to-noise ratio) or RSRP.<br>
[0043]	In some WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) FDD<br>
multi-carrier (muiti frequency) scenarios, cell reseleclion ranking based either on RSCP only or on Ec/No (e.g., RS-SINR) only measurements could not be optimal, In particular, in those problematic scenarios where service/coverage continuity and load balancing are crucial, both RSCP and Ec/No quality measures could be important for inter-frequency cell reselection performance.<br>
[0044]	A mobile device 202 can communicate with a base station 204 to<br>
facilitate selection of an appropriate cell. An evaluator 206 can compare a primary<br>
quality measure 208 and a secondary quality measure 210 of a principal cell against a<br>
primary quality measure and a secondary quality measure of at least one supplemental<br>
cell. A mathematical result can be produced highlighting cell ranking in the<br>
aforementioned quality aspects. A designator 212 can select a cell for use as a function<br>
of a result of the comparison, commonly though use of a look-up table, rule set,<br>
artificial intelligence technique, and the like. According to one embodiment, the<br>
primary quality measure is signal-to-noise ratio or signal-to-power ratio and the<br>
secondary quality measure is signal-to-noise ratio or signal-to-power ratio, where the<br>
primary quality measure and the secondary quality measure are different.<br>
[0045]	Artificial intelligence techniques can employ one of numerous<br>
methodologies for learning from data and then drawing inferences and/or making determinations related to dynamically storing information across multiple storage units (e.g., Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and related prototypical dependency models, more general probabilistic graphical models, such as Bayesian networks, e.g., created by structure search using a Bayesian model score or approximation, linear classifiers, such as support vector machines (SVMs), non-linear classifiers, such as methods referred to as "neural network" methodologies, fuzzy logic methodologies, and other approaches<br>
 <br>
that perform data fusion, ere.) in accordance with implementing various automated aspects described herein. In addition, these techniques can also include methods for capture of logical relationships such as theorem provers or more heuristic rule-based expert systems. Furthermore, it is to be appreciated that more than two quality measures can be taken into account when selecting a cell for use in wireless communication.<br>
[0046]	To facilitate operation, the base station 204 can use various modules to<br>
enable the mobile device 202 to make an appropriate decision. An identifier 214 can determine a primary quality measure and a secondary quality measure for communication to the mobile device 202. For example, a request message can be emitted to the base station 204 and an automatic setting can instruct the base station 204 to emit information, the base station 204 can make an inference on what should be provided through use of artificial intelligence techniques, etc. An analyzer 216 can measure the primary quality measure and the secondary quality measure. An engager 218 can transfer the primary quality measure and the secondary quality measure, commonly to the mobile device 202. While disclosed as part of the base station 204, it is to be appreciated that the analyzer 216 can function as an independent module and apart from the identifier 214 and engager 218. Similarly, the primary quality measure can signal-to-noise ratio or signal-to-power ratio and the secondary quality measure can be signal-to-noise ratio or signal-to-power ratio, where the primary quality measure and the secondary quality measure are different.<br>
[0047]	The following is example operation concerning the system 200 as well as<br>
regarding other aspects disclosed herein. The primary quality measure can be a selected<br>
FDD reselection quality measure (Ec/No or RSCP) while the secondary quality measure<br>
can be another FDD reselection quality measure (RSCP or Ec/No). The system 200 can<br>
function to identify an overall best ranked cell that can be a highest ranked cell after<br>
ranking a serving and at least one neighbor cell based on the primary quality measure<br>
[0048]	According to one embodiment, a cell reselection algorithm can be used<br>
for UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System). If a network indicates to UE (user equipment, such as the mobile device 202), in addition to a certain FDD reselection quality measure, to evaluate both RSCP and Ec/No quantities for cell reselection {e.g., by means of a parameter sent), the UE can measure both CPICH (Common Pilot Channel) Ec/No and RSCP for each cell (serving and neighbors). The<br>
 <br>
UE can also rank the serving and neighbor cells based on the primary quality measure,<br>
but associating to each ceil both quality measures. Moreover, if there are cells in (he<br>
ranking list which have higher RSCP and Ec/No than the serving cell, then the UE can<br>
reselect to a cell with the highest primary quality measure among them. Additionally, if<br>
no cell fulfils an aforementioned condition, then the UE can reselect to the overall best<br>
ranked cell, if different than the serving cell (as per current standard mechanism, using<br>
only the primary quality measure), otherwise not reselect.<br>
[0049]	There can also be a different cell reselection algorithm for an LTE<br>
situation. A network can indicate to the UE, in addition to a certain reselection quality<br>
measure, to evaluate both RSRP and RS-SINR quantities for cell reselection (by means<br>
of a parameter sent), the UE can measure both RSRP and RS-SINR for each cell<br>
(serving and neighbors). Through use of a result of the measurement, there can be<br>
ranking the serving and neighbor cells based on the primary quality measure, but<br>
associating to each cell both quality measures. If there are cells in the ranking list which<br>
have higher RSRP and RS-SINR than the serving cell, reselection can occur to the cell<br>
with the highest primary quality measure among them. However, if no cell fulfils<br>
condition aforementioned conditions, the UE can reselect to the overall best ranked<br>
cell, if different than the serving cell, otherwise not reselect.<br>
[0050]	Other algorithms can be used, such as in an UMTS context. If a<br>
network indicates to the UE, in addition to a certain FDD reselection quality measure, to evaluate both RSCP and Ec/No quantities for cell reselection and indicates the coefficients that should be used to weight the RSCP and Ec/No measurements (by means of a parameters sent), the UE can measure both CPICH Ec/No and RSCP for each cell (serving and neighbors). With the measurement, there can be rank the serving and neighbor cells based on the following formula:<br>
Quality of the cell = A * (RSCP + B) + C * (Ec/No + D)<br>
[0051]	Where A, B, C, and D can be coefficients sent in the BCCH (Broadcast<br>
Control Channel). The UE can reselect to the overall best ranked cell, if different than the serving cell otherwise not reselect.<br>
[0052]	There can also be an alternative algorithm for use in an LTE<br>
configuration. If a network indicates to the UE, in addition to a certain FDD reselection quality measure, to evaluate both RSRP and RS-SINR quantities for cell reselection and<br>
 <br>
indicates the coefficients that should be used to weight the RSCP and Ec/No measurements (by means of a parameters sent), the UE should measure both RSRP and RS-SINR for each cell (serving and neighbors). With the measurement, there can be ranking the serving and neighbor cells based on the following formula:<br>
Quality of the cell = A * (RSRP + B) + C * (RS-SINR + D)<br>
[0053]	Where A, B, C, and D can be coefficients sent in the BCCH. Upon using<br>
the formula, the UEcan reselect to the overall best ranked cell, if different than the serving cell otherwise not reselect.<br>
[0054]	Now referring to Fig. 3, an example system 300 is disclosed for ranking<br>
different cells in order to determine a cell for use in wireless communication. A mobile device 202 requests for a base station 204 to provide quality measure information. The base station 204 can be part of a cell where three different antennas are used. An identifier 214 can determine quality measures desired by the mobile device 202 and an engager 218 can transfer quality measure information to the mobile device 202. Multiple base stations 204 can supply quality measure information and a mobile device 202 can determine a desirable (e.g., best) cell to use.<br>
[0055]	An evaluator 206 can compare quality measure information amount<br>
available base stations 204. A designator 212 can select an appropriate cell to use based upon a result of the comparison. To facilitate selection, various modules can be used to rank and distinguish different cells. A classifier 302 can rank the cells (e.g., principal cells, supplemental cells, etc.) as a function of the primary quality measure. In addition, an arranger 304 can rank the cells as a function of the secondary quality measure, While shown as distinct entities, it is to be appreciated that the classifier 302 and the arranger 304 can function as a single module. A leveier 306 can balance a cell rank of the primary quality measure against a cell rank of the secondary quality measure, a result of the balance is used in selection.<br>
[0056]	It is possible for a single cell to have a highest rank of the primary<br>
quality measure and the secondary quality measure. In this instance, the leveier 306 can automatically designate the highest ranking cell for selection. However, if there are different highest rankings, then a decision can be made as to what cell should be used. This can include a cell that is highest ranking in at least one, a cell with a highest ranking average, and the like. Additionally, the leveier 306 can include logic to<br>
 <br>
distinguish when a tie ranking occurs (e.g., selecting a more important factor, random selection, and the like).<br>
[0057]	According to one embodiment, the leveler 306 can balance a cell rank of<br>
the primary quality measure against a cell rank of the secondary quality measure<br>
functions through use of weight coefficients. For instance, the primary quality measure<br>
can be provided two times the weight of the secondary quality measure. The leveler<br>
306 can use an algorithm to determine a cell for designation.<br>
[00581	Now referring to Fig. 4, an example system 400 can function to shift<br>
cells among a mobile device 202, The mobile device 202 and base station 204 can<br>
engage with one another through an evaluator 206, designator 212, identifier 214, and/or<br>
engager 1 1 8 as previously discussed. Commonly, a user can be using a cell when on a<br>
wireless communication, where the used ceil can be referred to as a servicing cell. A<br>
recognizer 402 can identify a servicing cell, where the servicing cell can be designated<br>
as the principal cell. According to one embodiment, there can be an interest to have a<br>
communication retain upon a cell. Therefore, a different cell is not selected and/or<br>
implemented (e.g., communication transferred from the principal cell to the<br>
supplemental cell) unless there is a substantial reason, such as both a primary quality<br>
measure and secondary quality measure improve against the supplemental cell.<br>
[0059]	A checker 404 can determine if a supplemental cell has a higher primary<br>
quality measure and a higher secondary quality measure than the servicing cell. Commonly, values of the quality measures can be taken and compared and a result of the comparison analyzed. Quality measures can be represented as numerical values, levels (e.g., high, medium, low), status (e.g., on/off), &amp;nd the like. A selector 406 can choose the supplemental cell for usage if the supplemental cell has higher primary quality measure and higher secondary quality measure than the servicing cell. However, a stopper 408 can retain (e.g., facilitate the mobile device 202 to retain) the principal cell as the servicing cell if the supplemental eel! does not have higher primary quality measure and higher secondary quality measure than the servicing cell. Thus, the checker can operate as a controller, where active signals can be fed to the selector 406 and/or stopper 408 based upon the determination. It can be possible for more than one cell to be better than a servicing cell. Therefore, an assignor 410 can be used that designates a cell for use if there is more than one supplemental cell has higher primary quality measure and higher secondary quality measure than the servicing cell.<br>
 <br>
[0060]	Now referring to Fig. 5, an example system 500 for ranking cells in<br>
regard to wireless communication. The mobile device 202 and base station 204 can engage with one another through an evaluator 206, designator 212, identifier 214, and/or engager 218 as previously discussed. Based upon a comparison of cells, ranks can be use to distinguish cells from one another. A placer 502 can rank the principal cell and the at least one supplemental cell as a function of the primary quality measure and the secondary quality measure - commonly, a highest ranking cell is selected. Rankings can be dependent (e.g., cell A is V amount bigger than cell B and the rank takes V into account) or independent {e.g., if cell A is higher than cell B, then cell A is given a rank of 'y' while cell B is given a rank of 'y-t-1' regardless of how much higher cell B is then cell A).<br>
[0061]	Once ranked, a confirmer 504 can check if a ranked cell has a highest<br>
primary quality measure and a highest secondary quality measure. If a cell has higher quality measures then other cells, then the cell can be automatically selected (e.g., a top rated cell in all categories is therefore the top rated cell). Depending on a configuration, ties can be included or excluded. Thus, a cell with the highest primary quality measure and the highest secondary quality measure can be elected. A calculator 506 can be used to measure the primary quality measure or the secondary quality measure, commonly of a cell used by the mobile device 202. This can save needless communication (e.g., and thus save resources) with a base station (e.g., the base station 204) that provides a servicing cell. Measurements of the calculator 506 can be used by the evaluator 206, designator 212, confirmer 504, calculator 506, other entities pertaining to the mobile device 202, etc.<br>
[0062]	Referring to Figs. 6-9, methodologies relating to a cell selection are<br>
illustrated. While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of acts, it is to be understood and appreciated that (he methodologies are not limited by the order of acts, as some acts can, in accordance with one or more embodiments, occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state diagram. Moreover, not all illustrated acts can be required to implement a methodology in accordance with one or more embodiments.<br>
 <br>
[0063]	Now referring lo Fig. 6, an example methodology 600 is disclosed Re-<br>
producing quality measures to a mobile device. At action 602, there can be determining a primary quality measure and a secondary quality measure for communication to a mobile device. This can be done through request of a user, artificial intelligence determination, observation of information transferred from other base stations, provided through a central host, and the like.<br>
[0064]	At event 604, measuring the primary quality measure and the secondary<br>
quality measure can occur. According to one embodiment, measurement of various<br>
quality measures can occur without provocation from action 602. When action 602 is<br>
processed, measured information can be designated. However, measurement can also<br>
be performed with the determination is made and set to idol otherwise.<br>
[0065]	Quality measure information can be emitted at act 606; thus, there can be<br>
transferring the primary quality measure and the secondary quality measure. Transferring of information can be continuous (e.g., as information is gathered), performed upon completion, performed upon completion of a quality measure, and the like. According to one configuration, the primary quality measure is signal-to-noise ratio or signal-to-power ratio and the secondary quality measure is signal-to-noise ratio or signal-to-power ratio, where the primary quality measure and the secondary quality measure are different.<br>
[0066]	Now referring to Fig. 7, an example methodology 700 is disclosed for<br>
selecting cells based upon comparing rankings. Different rankings can be tracked based upon varying quality measures {e.g., one ranking for signal-to-noise ratio, another ranking for signal-to-power ratio, etc.) Act 702 can represent ranking the cells as a function of the primary quality measure while event 704 represents ranking the cells as a function of the secondary quality measure.<br>
[0067]	It is possible that one cell ranks higher in all metrics - a check 706 can<br>
determine if this is a case, commonly through a quick comparison. If there is not absolute best cell, then balancing a cell rank of the primary quality measure against a ceil rank of the secondary quality measure can occur at event 708 (e.g., through use of weight factors). There can be a comparison of a primary quality measure and a secondary quality measure of a principal cell against a primary quality measure and a secondary quality measure of at least one supplemental cell through act 710. Ultimately, there can be a selection of a cell for use as a function of a result of the<br>
 <br>
comparison can occur at event 712 if an absolute best cell is determined through the<br>
check 706, identified through the comparison at act 710, and the like.<br>
[0068]	Now referring to Fig. 8, an example methodology 800 is disclosed that<br>
relates to managing a communication session concerning leaving one celi for another. A determination can be made if a communication session is active for a mobile device and if there is an active communication session, then there can be identifying a servicing cell at act 802. According to one embodiment, the servicing cell can be designated as the principal cell.<br>
[0069]	Cells can be analyzed at action 804 (e.g., principal cell, at least one<br>
supplemental ceil, etc.) and at check 806 there can be determining if a supplemental ceil has a higher primary quality measure and a higher secondary quality measure than the servicing ceil. The determination can be made through comparing a primary quality measure and a secondary quality measure of a principal cell against a primary quality measure and a secondary quality measure of at least one supplemental celi. If another cell is not considered better (e.g., all metrics are not greater than those of a servicing cell, a cell is not better after application of weight factors, etc.), then the methodology 800 can move to act 808 to retain the principal cell as the servicing celi if the supplemental cell does not have higher primary quality measure and higher secondary quality measure than the servicing cell.<br>
[0070]	If there is another cell that is better, then a check 8 1 0 can be performed<br>
to determine if there is more than one improved cell. With multiple improved cells, there can be designating a cell for use at act 812. Thus, this can occur if there is more than one supplemental cell has higher primary quality measure and higher secondary quality measure than the servicing cell. After designating a cell, upon determining there is not more than one cell at check 810, there can be choosing the supplemental cell for usage at act 814 if the supplemental cell has higher primary quality measure and higher secondary quality measure than the servicing cell. Act 814 can function as selecting a cell for use as a function of a result of the comparison.<br>
[0071]	Now referring to Fig. 9, an example methodology 900 for measuring<br>
quality metrics in relation to a cell used in wireless communication. At block 902, there can be measuring a primary quality measure or the secondary quality measure for at least one cell. At act 904, there can be comparing a primary quality measure and a secondary quality measure of a principal cell against a primary quality measure and a<br>
 <br>
secondary quality measure of at least one supplemental cell. The compared measures can be obtained through practice of block 902.<br>
[0072]	Based upon the comparison, a check 906 can be performed to determine<br>
if there is another cell that is better than the principal cell. If another ceil is designated as better, then another cell can be selected at act 908. However, if the check 906 determines that there is no better cell, then a servicing cell can be retained at event 910. Act 908 and/or event 910 can function as selecting a cell for use as a function of a result of the comparison.<br>
[00731	It will be appreciated that, in accordance with one or more aspects<br>
described herein, inferences can be made regarding a particular cell to select, a weight<br>
given to a quality measure, etc. As used herein, the term to "infer" or "inference" refers<br>
generally to the process of reasoning about or inferring states of the system,<br>
environment, and/or user from a set of observations as captured via events and/or data.<br>
Inference can be employed to identify a specific context or action, or can generate a<br>
probability distribution over states, for example. The inference can be probabilistic—that<br>
is, the computation of a probability distribution over states of interest based on a<br>
consideration of data and events. Inference can also refer to techniques employed for<br>
composing higher-level events from a set of events and/or data. Such inference results<br>
in the construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and/or stored<br>
event data, whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity, and<br>
whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources.<br>
[0074]	According to an example, one or more methods presented above can<br>
include making inferences pertaining to selecting a cell based in part on the situation, By way of further illustration, an inference can be made related to selecting a number of quality measures to use in cell selection, a specific cell for use in communication, etc. It will be appreciated that the foregoing examples are illustrative in nature and are not intended to limit the number of inferences that can be made or the manner in which such inferences arc made in conjunction with the various embodiments and/or methods described herein.<br>
[0075]	Fig. 10 is an illustration of a mobile device 3 000 that facilitates selection<br>
of a cell for wireless communication. Mobile device 1000 comprises a receiver 1002 that receives a signal from, for instance, a receive antenna (not shown), and performs typical actions thereon (e.g., filters, amplifies, downconverts, etc.) the received signal<br>
 <br>

Memory 1008 can additionally store protocols and/or algorithms associated with estimating and/or utilizing a channel (e.g., performance based, capacity based, etc.).<br>
[0077]	It will be appreciated that the data store (e.g., memory 1008) described<br>
herein can be either volatile memory or nonvolatile memory, or can include both<br>
volatile and nonvolatile memory. By way of illustration, and not limitation, nonvolatile<br>

(DRRAM). The memory 1008 of the subject systems and methods is intended to<br>
comprise, without being limited to, these and any other suitable types of memory.<br>
[0078]	Processor 1002 is further operatively coupled an evaluator 1010 and/or a<br>
designator 1012. The evaluator 1010 can compares a primary quality measure and a secondary quality measure of a principal cell against a primary quality measure and a secondary quality measure of at least one supplemental cell. The designator 1012 can<br>
 <br>
select a cell for use as a function of a result of the comparison. Mobile device 1000 still further comprises a modulator 1014 and the transmitter 1016 that transmits a signal (e.g., base CQI and differential CQI) to, for instance, a base station, another mobile device, etc. Although depicted as being separate from the processor 1006, it is to be appreciated that theevaluator 1010 and/or the designator I012can be part of processor 1006 or a number of processors (not shown).<br>
[0079]	Fig. 11 is an illustration of a system 1100 that facilitates communication<br>
through use of a cell. System 1 100 comprises a base station 1102 (e.g., access point, ...) with a receiver 1110 that receives signal(s) from one or more mobile devices I 104 through a plurality of receive antennas 1106, and a transmitter 1 122 that transmits to the one or more mobile devices 1104 through a plurality of transmit antennas 1108. Receiver 1110 can receive information from receive antennas \ 106 and is operatively associated with a demodulator 1112 that demodulates received information - example information can include a PDU and/or control PDU. Demodulated symbols are analyzed by a processor 1114 that can be similar to the processor described above with regard to Fig. 10, and which is coupled to a memory 1116 that stores information related to estimating a signal (e.g., pilot) strength and/or interference strength, data to be transmitted to or received from mobile device(s) 1104 (or a disparate base station (not shown)), and/or any other suitable information related to performing the various actions and functions set forth herein.<br>
[0080]	Processor 11 14 is further coupled to an identifier 1118 and/or an engager<br>
1120. The identifier 1118 can determine a primary quality measure and a secondary quality measure for communication to a mobile device. The engager 1120 can transfer the primary quality measure and the secondary quality measure. Although depicted as being separate from the processor I 1 14, it is to be appreciated that the identifier 1118 and/or an engager 1120 can be part of processor 11 14 or a number of processors (not shown).<br>
[0081]	Fig. 12 shows an example wireless communication system 1200. The<br>
wireless communication system 1200 depicts one base station 1210 and one mobile device 1250 for sake of brevity. However, it is to be appreciated that system 1200 can include more than one base station and/or more than one mobile device, wherein additional base stations and/or mobile devices can be substantially similar or different from example base station 1210 and mobile device 1250 described below. In addition,<br>
 <br>
it is to be appreciated thai base station 1210 and/or mobile device 1250 can employ the systems (Figs. 1-5 and 10-11) and/or methods (Figs. 6-9) described herein to facilitate wireless communication there between.<br>
[0082]	At base station 1210, traffic data for a number of data streams is<br>
provided from a data source 1212 to a transmit (TX) data processor 1214. According lo<br>
an example, each data stream can be transmitted over a respective antenna. TX data<br>
processor 1214 formats, codes, and interleaves the traffic data stream based on a<br>
particular coding scheme selected for that data stream to provide coded data.<br>
[0083]	The coded data for each data stream can be multiplexed with pilot data<br>
using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) techniques. Additionally or alternatively, the pilot symbols can be frequency division multiplexed (FDM), time division multiplexed (TDM), or code division multiplexed (CDM). The pilot data is typically a known data pattern that is processed in a known manner and can be used at mobile device 1250 to estimate channel response. The multiplexed pilot and coded data for each data stream can be modulated {e.g., symbol mapped) based on a particular modulation scheme (e.g., binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), M-phase-shift keying (M-PSK), M-quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM), eic.) selected for that data stream to provide modulation symbols. The data rate, coding, and modulation for each data stream can be determined by instructions performed or provided by processor 1230.<br>
[0084]	The modulation symbols for the data streams can be provided to a TX<br>
MIMO processor 1220, which can further process the modulation symbols (e.g., for OFDM). TX MIMO processor 1220 then provides AV modulation symbol streams to AV transmitters (TMTR) 1222a through I222t. In various embodiments, TX MIMO processor 1220 applies beamforming weights to the symbols of the data streams and to the antenna from which the symbol is being transmitted.<br>
[0085]	Each transmitter 1222 receives and processes a respective symbol stream<br>
to provide one or more analog signals, and further conditions (e.g., amplifies, filters, and upconverts) the analog signals to provide a modulated signal suitable for transmission over the MIMO channel. Further, AV modulated signals from transmitters 1222a through 1222t are transmitted from AV antennas 1224a through 1224t, respectively.<br>
 <br>
[0086]	At mobile device 1250, the transmitted modulated signals are received<br>
by Na antennas 1252a through I252r and the received signal from each antenna 1252 is provided to a respective receiver (RCVR) 1254a through 1254r. Each receiver 1254 conditions (e.g., filters, amplifies, and downconverts) a respective signal, digitizes the conditioned signal to provide samples, and further processes the samples to provide a corresponding "received" symbol stream.<br>
[0087]	An RX data processor 1260 can receive and process the NR received<br>
symbol streams from NR receivers 1254 based on a particular receiver processing technique to provide Nr "detected" symbol streams. RX data processor 1260 can demodulate, deinterieave, and decode each detected symbol stream to recover the traffic data for the data stream. The processing by RX data processor 1260 is complementary to that performed by TX MIMO processor 1220 and TX data processor 1214 at base station 1210.<br>
[0088]	A processor 1270 can periodically determine which preceding matrix to<br>
utilize as discussed above. Further, processor 1270 can formulate a reverse link<br>
message comprising a matrix index portion and a rank value portion.<br>
[0089]	The reverse link message can comprise various types of information<br>
regarding the communication link and/or the received data stream. The reverse link message can be processed by a TX data processor 1238, which also receives traffic data for a number of data streams from a data source 1236, modulated by a modulator 1280, conditioned by transmitters 1254a through 1254r, and transmitted back to base station 1210.<br>
[0090]	At base station 1210, the modulated signals from mobile device 1250 are<br>
received by antennas 1224, conditioned by receivers 1222, demodulated by a demodulator 1240, and processed by a RX data processor 1242 to extract the reverse link message transmitted by mobile device 1250. Further, processor 1230 can process the extracted message to determine which precoding matrix to use for determining the beamforming weights.<br>
[0091]	Processors 1230 and 1270 can direct (e.g., control, coordinate, manage,<br>
etc.) operation at base station 1210 and mobile device 1250, respectively. Respective processors 1230 and 1270 can be associated with memory 1232 and 1272 that store program codes and data. Processors 1230 and 1270 can also perform computations to<br>
 <br>
derive frequency and impulse response estimates for the uplink and downlink, respectively.<br>

[0095]	With reference to Fig. 13, illustrated is a system 1300 that effectuates<br>
communication through use of a cell. For example, system 1300 can reside at least partially within a mobile device. It is to be appreciated that system 1300 is represented as including functional blocks, which can be functional blocks that represent functions implemented by a processor, software, or combination thereof {e.g., firmware). System 1300 includes a logical grouping i 302 of electrical components that can act in conjunction. For instance, logical grouping 1302 can include an electrical component<br>
