FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates in general to an optical recording apparatus for writing information into an optical storage medium, more particularly but not necessarily exclusively an optical storage disc. Specifically, the present invention relates to a timing control circuit for an optical recording apparatus. Hereinafter, the present invention will be explained for the case of an optical storage disc, and the apparatus will also be indicated as "optical disc drive".<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
As is commonly known, an optical storage disc comprises at least one track, either in the form of a continuous spiral or in the form of multiple concentric circles, of storage space where information may be stored in the form of a data pattern. Optical discs may be read-only type, where information is recorded during manufacturing, which information can only be read by a user. The optical storage disc may also be a writable type, where information may be stored by a user. For writing information in the storage space of a writable optical storage disc, an optical disc drive comprises, on the one hand, rotating means for receiving and rotating an optical disc, and on the other hand optical means for generating an optical beam, typically a laser beam, and for scanning the storage track with said laser beam. Since the technology of optical discs in general, and the way in which information can be stored in an optical disc, is commonly known, it is not necessary here to describe this technology in great detail For understanding the present invention, it is sufficient to mention that the laser beam is modulated such as to cause a pattern of locations where properties of the disc material have changed, such pattern corresponding to coded information.<br>
More particularly, the laser drive signal is a digital signal which can assume one of two values, indicated as HIGH and LOW or "1" and "0", respectively. If the laser driver signal is LOW, the laser output power is such that it gives rise to a so-called "land" on the disc material. If the laser driver signal is HIGH, the laser output power is such that it gives rise to a so-called "pit". The translation of the encoder signal to a laser beam control<br><br>
signal is generally termed a write-strategy and is generally performed by a Write Strategy Generator (WSG).<br>
Said optical scanning means comprise an optical pickup unit, which comprises a laser diode and a laser diode driver. The laser diode driver comprises a flipflop device, as well as a Write Strategy Generator and a laser current driver determining the laser diode driving signal. As will be explained in more detail, the flipflop device has two inputs for receiving a data signal and a clock signal, respectively. Briefly stated, the clock signal is a digital signal determining the timing of changes in the flipflop output signal, whereas the data signal determines the value which the flipflop output signal takes at the moments determined by the clock signal.<br>
For reliably setting a flipflop device to a desired state (i.e. HIGH/LOW), such flipflop device requires that the input signals are stable during a certain time window around the active clock signal edge (setup and hold requirements). If these requirements are not met, data errors may occur.<br>
In this respect, some individual flipflop devices may have more strict setup and hold requirements than others. In fact, these requirements may differ from batch to batch and even from device to device. On the other hand, the clock signal and the data signal are provided by an encoder device, and a phase relationship between the clock signal and the data signal may be different for different encoder devices and may even vary with time for one encoder device, caused for instance by variations in temperature or power supply. The problems mentioned above have increasing severity with increasing writing speed (data rate).<br>
Therefore, it is an important objective of the present invention to reduce the chances on data errors by increasing the stability of the clock signal and the data signal during said flipflop-determined time window.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to an important aspect of the present invention, this objective is attained by providing an automatic alignment between edges of the clock signal and edges of the data signal. This will eliminate or at least reduce phase variations such as for instance caused by process spread, temperature variations, and power supply variations.<br>
It is noted that US-A-5.475.664 describes a method for reading information from a disc, wherein a read signal is processed to regenerate a data signal and a clock signal by means of a PLL circuit, and wherein the beam focus is adapted to reduce a time difference<br><br>
between an edge of the PLL clock signal and a transition point of the data signal. In contrast, the present invention relates to the write channel, where the timing and frequency of the data signal and the clock signal, respectively, are fixed by the encoder device.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
These and other aspects, features and advantages of the present invention will be further explained by the following description of the present invention with reference to the drawings, in which same reference numerals indicate same or similar parts, and in which:<br>
Figure 1 schematically shows a block diagram of an optical writing system;<br>
Figure 2 is a graph illustrating an aligned timing relationship between a data signal, a clock signal and a retimed data signal;<br>
Figures 3 A-B are graphs, similar to figure 2, illustrating possible misalignment;<br>
Figure 4 is a schematical block diagram illustrating a timing control circuit according to the present invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 schematically shows an optical writing system 2 of an optical disc writing apparatus 1. The optical writing system 2 comprises an encoder device 10 having an input 11 for receiving a data signal SD from a data source not shown for sake of simplicity. The encoder 10 performs a coding operation, typically the well-known eight-to-fourteen modulation coding (EFM), and provides an EFM data signal SEFMdata at a data output 12 and an EFM clock signal SCLK at a clock output 13. Since eight-to-fourteen modulation coding is known per se, it is not necessary here to explain this coding scheme in detail.<br>
The optical writing system 2 further comprises a laser diode 30 and a driver circuit 20 for driving the laser diode 30. The driver circuit 20 has a data input 22 coupled to the data output 12 of the encoder 10 for receiving the data signal SEFMdata , and has a clock input 23 coupled to the clock output 13 of the encoder 10 for receiving the clock signal SCLK-The driver circuit 20 further has a drive output 24 coupled to the laser diode 30, providing a<br>
laser diode drive signal SL.<br>
As shown in figure 1, the driver circuit 20 comprises a laser current driver unit 26, which has an input 27 and an output 28 connected to the drive output 24 of the driver<br><br>
circuit 20. The laser current driver unit 26 in this example comprises a write strategy generator, which is not shown individually.<br>
As shown in figure 1, the driver circuit 20 further comprises a D-type flipflop drive device 25, having a data input D coupled to data input 22 of the driver circuit 20, having a clock input CLK coupled to clock input 23 of the driver circuit 20, and having an output Q coupled to the input 27 of the laser current driver unit 26.<br>
Figure 2 schematically illustrates the operation of the driver circuit 20. The coded data signal SEFMdata is a digital signal which can take two values, indicated as HIGH and LOW or as "1" and "0", respectively; transitions between these two values are indicated as signal edges. Likewise, the clock signal SCLK ls a digital signal which can take two values, indicated as HIGH and LOW or as "1" and M0", respectively; transitions between these two values are likewise indicated as signal edges. In both cases, a transition from "0" to "1" will be indicated as a rising edge, while a transition from "1" to "0" will be indicated as a falling edge-Each time a falling edge of the clock signal SCLK is received at its clock input CLK, the D-type flipflop device 25 makes the value of its output signal at its output Q equal to the instantaneous value of the data signal SEFMdata at its data input D, and this output signal is maintained until the next arrival of a falling edge of the clock signal SCLK- Thus, at time tl in figure 2, flipflop output signal SQ becomes high. At times t2 and t3, flipflop output signal SQ remains high because the data signal SEFMdata at flipflop data input D is still high, but at time t4 flipflop output signal SQ becomes low because now the data signal SEFMdata at flipflop data input D is low. Flipflop output signal SQ can be considered to establish a data signal similar to the data signal SEFMdata but with a different timing, for which reason flipflop output signal SQ is also indicated as retimed data signal.<br>
In the situation shown in figure 2, since the flipflop device 25 is responsive to falling edges of the clock signal, the falling edges of the clock signal are indicated as active edges whereas the rising edges of the clock signal are indicated as passive edges.<br>
In the situation shown in figure 2, edges of the data signal SEFMdata are aligned with the passive edges of the clock signal SCLK- A timing parameter Τ  DC between the data signal SEFMdat and the clock signal SCLK will be defined as the time difference between edges<br><br>
of the data signal SEFMdat and the passive edges of the clock signal SQLK- This timing parameter Τ  DC is equal to zero in the situation shown in figure 2.<br>
Figure 3 A illustrates a situation where the edges of the data signal SEFMdat arrive somewhat later than the passive edges of the clock signal SCLIG in this case, the timing parameter Τ  DC will be defined as being positive.<br>
Figure 3B illustrates a situation where the edges of the data signal SEFMdat arrive somewhat earlier than the passive edges of the clock signal SCLK; in this case, the timing parameter Τ  DC will be defined as being negative.<br>
It should be clear that the absolute value of the timing parameter Τ  DC is always smaller than half the period of the clock signal.<br>
With respect to setup and hold time requirements of the flipflop 25, the situation of figure 2 (timing parameter Τ  DC = 0) is ideal, because then die time interval between the occurrence of a data signal edge and the closest active clock signal edge is maximal.<br>
The timing parameter Τ  DC may vary from device to device, while for one<br>
device the timing parameter Τ  DC may vary with time. This is represented by internal delays 41 and 42 at the outputs 12 and 13 of the encoder 10, and by internal delays 43 and 44 at the inputs 22 and 23 of the driver 20. Internal delays 41 and 42 represent timing differences as occurring inside the encoder 10, whereas internal delays 43 and 44 represent timing differences as caused by the signal transfer between encoder 10 and flipflop 25.<br>
It is desirable to have the timing parameter Τ  DC as measured at the D and CLK<br>
inputs of flipflop 25 to be as small as possible, preferably equal to zero.<br>
To this end, the present invention provides a timing control circuit 50, which can be implemented as a unit to be connected between encoder 10 and driver 20, but which preferably, as illustrated in figure 4, is arranged directly before the D and CLK inputs of flipflop 25.<br>
It is noted that the timing control circuit 50 is an embodiment of the present invention which may be usable for other applications.<br>
The timing control circuit 50 has two inputs 51 and 52 for receiving two signals SI and S2, and two outputs 58 and 59 for outputting two signals S3 and S4. In the practical application illustrated in figure 4, first input 51 receives the data signal SEFMdat as<br><br>
Srst input signal SI, and second input 52 receives the clock signal SCLK as second input signal S2, while first output 58 and second output 59 are connected to the data input D and the clock input CLK of flipflop 25, respectively.<br>
A first signal path from first input 51 to first output 58 is indicated at 53; a second signal path from second input 52 to second output 59 is indicated at 54. In at least one of said signal paths 53, 54, a controllable delay is incorporated. In the embodiment as illustrated, a controllable delay 60 is incorporated in first signal path 53, having a signal input 61 connected to first input 51, having a delayed signal output 62 connected to first output 58, and having a control input 63.<br>
The controllable delay device 60 is designed to provide at its delayed signal output 62 a first delayed signal S3 which is equal to the first input signal SI received at its signal input 61 but delayed over a first predetermined delay time τ  l, the duration of which is determined by a control signal received at control input 63. Since controllable delay devices are known per se, whereas the present invention does not relate to controllable delay devices as such, while a known per se controllable delay device can be used when implementing the present invention, it is not necessary here to discuss the design and operation of the controllable delay device in more detail<br>
The timing control circuit 50 further comprises a phase comparator 70, having a first input 71 connected to first output 58, having a second input 72 connected to second output 59, and having a control output 73 connected to control input 63 of the controllable delay device 60.<br>
The phase comparator 70 is designed to compare the phases of two signals<br>
received at its two inputs 71, 72, and to generate a control signal Sc for the controllable delay device 60, such that the time difference between edges of both input signals is reduced, preferably zero.<br>
Since phase comparators are known per se, whereas the present invention does not relate to phase comparators as such, while a known per se phase comparator can be used when implementing the present invention, it is not necessary here to discuss the design and operation of the phase comparator in more detail.<br>
Preferably, the phase comparator 70 comprises a low-pass filter function for filtering the input signals received at its two inputs 71,72.<br>
In case the first signal SI, i.e. data signal SEFMdab is somewhat ahead of the second signal S2, i.e. clock signal SCLK, aligning the two signals can be easily achieved by<br><br>
the timing control circuit 50 because the phase comparator 70 generates its control signal Sc for applying a relatively small delay to the first signal SI. In case, however, the first signal SI is somewhat behind the second signal S2, applying a small delay to the first signal SI will only increase the time difference between edges of both input signals, and a large delay is necessaRy, in the order of the clock period minus the original timing difference. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, as illustrated also in figure 4, the timing control circuit 50 further comprises a second delay device in the other of the two transfer paths, namely a second delay device 80 in second signal transfer path 54. The second delay device 80 has a signal input 81 connected to second input 52 and has a delayed signal output 82 connected to second output 59.<br>
Then, it is effectively possible to delay the clock signal with respect to the data signal.<br>
The second delay device 80 may be a controllable delay device, like the first delay device 60, but this is not necessaiy. It is sufficient if the second delay device 80 is a fixed delay device 80 designed to provide at its delayed signal output 82 a second delayed signal S4 which is equal to the second input signal S2 received at its signal input 81 but delayed over a second predetermined delay time T2, the duration of which being fixed.<br>
In case the first signal SI is already aligned with the second signal S2, the<br>
phase comparator 70 generates its control signal Sc such that the first delay time tl is equal<br>
to the second delay time T2, so that the output signals S3 and S4 are also aligned.<br>
In case the first signal SI is somewhat ahead of the second signal S2, the phase comparator<br>
70 generates its control signal Sc such that the first delay time xl is larger than the second<br>
delay time x2 (more particularly: xl = x2 + x).<br>
In case the first signal SI is somewhat behind the second signal S2, the phase comparator 70 generates its control signal Sc such that the first delay time xl is smaller than the second delay time x2 (more particularly: xl = x2 - x).<br>
Preferably, the phase comparator 70 is associated with a non-volatile memoiy 90. Into this memory 90, the timing control circuit 50 stores a value representing the magnitude (voltage) of the control signal Sc, The timing control circuit 50 may be designed to regularly store the magnitude of the current control signal, or to store this magnitude just before power off. In any case, the timing control circuit 50 is designed to read the memory 90<br><br>
on power up and to use the stored value for determining (an initial value of) the control signal<br>
So<br>
In a possible embodiment, a digital value representing the magnitude of the current control signal may be stored into the memory 90 using an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), not shown for sake of simplicity, while the control signal may be restored using a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC), not shown for sake of simplicity, for reading the memory 90.<br>
Thus, the present invention succeeds in providing an optical recording apparatus for writing information into an optical storage medium such as for instance an optical storage disc, which apparatus comprises a laser diode 30, a laser driver circuit 20 comprising a flipflop device 25, and a timing control circuit 50. The flipflop receives a digital data signal and a digital clock signal.<br>
The timing control circuit 50 either delays the digital data signal or the digital clock signal, such as to substantially align data signal edges with passive clock signal edges.<br>
It should be clear to a person skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited to the exemplary embodiments discussed above, but that various variations and modifications are possible within the protective scope of the invention as defined in the appending claims.<br>
For instance, the output signal of driver circuit 20 may be inverted with respect to the EFM data signal.<br>
Also, the flipflop device 25 may respond to rising edges of the clock signal, in which case phase difference zero corresponds to alignment of data signal edges with falling clock signal edges.<br>
Further, the controllable delay device may be incorporated in the clock signal transfer line 54 while the data signal transfer line 53 may contain a fixed delay device or may contain no delay device.<br>
Further, it is possible that the optical writing system 2 comprises an inverter arranged between clock signal output 13 of the encoder 10 and second input 52 of the timing control circuit 50, in order to effect that rising edges in the clock signal SCLK become falling edges in the clock signal S4 as appearing at the clock signal input CLK of the flipflop 25, and vice versa. Such inverter is preferably a controllable inverter, for instance implemented as an EXOR gate, receiving the clock signal SCLK at one input terminal and receiving a selection<br><br>
signal at a second input terminal, as will be clear to a person skilled in the art With such controllable inverter, it is possible to select either the falling edges or the rising edges of the encoder output clock signal S<xk as active edge depending on whether the data signal edges></xk>
are closer to the falling edges or the rising edges of the encoder output clock signal SCLK- In that case, a suitable value for the fixed delay T2 of the second delay device 80 is one quarter of the clock period, and the required delay time tl of the controllable delay device 60 may be selected in the range from zero to one half of the clock period.<br>
Further, it is noted that the invention is applicable in optical recording apparatus for write-once recording material as well as for rewritable recording material. Further, it is noted that the invention is not limited to recording material in the shape of rotating discs.<br><br>
