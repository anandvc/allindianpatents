Moreover, the invention relates to a process for preparing these compounds, to compositions comprising 2-pyrimidines and to their use for controlling phytopathogenic harmful fungi.<br>
Fungicidal pyrimidines carrying a cyanamino substituent in the 2-position are known from WO-A 01/96314. Furthermore, fungicidal 2-pyrimidyl-N-methoxyamidines are known from WO-A 03/43993.<br>
However, in many cases the activity of the abovementioned pyrimidines is unsatisfactory. It is an object of the present invention to provide compounds having improved activity.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the pyrimidines of the formula I defined at the outset. Moreover, we have found processes for their preparation and compositions comprising them for controlling harmful fungi.<br>
The compounds I can be obtained by different routes.<br>
1)      It is possible, for example, to use sulfones of the formula II whose preparation is described in detail in WO-A 02/074753 or DE 10156279.9 as starting materials. Reaction of the sulfones II with metal cyanides III (Me+CN~) yields the nitriles IV. Metal cyanides are to be understood as meaning primarily alkali metal cyanides or alkaline earth metal cyanides or else covalent cyanides, such as tin tetracyanide.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Here, the compounds of the formula IA are initially converted with the aid of strong bases into the anion and then reacted with the corresponding acid chlorides to give IA' (see J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans I, 1995, p. 3043). This gives compounds in which X is a C=O bridge. Bases suitable for preparing the anion are, for example, sodium amide and sodium hydride.<br>
What was said above refers in particular to the preparation of compounds in which R3 is an alkyl group. If R3 is a cyano group or an alkoxy substituent, the radical R3 can be introduced by reaction with alkali metal cyanides and alkali metal alkoxides, respectively.<br>

animal origin, aliphatic, cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons, for example toluene, xylene, paraffin, tetrahydronaphthalene, alkylated naphthalenes or their derivatives, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, cyclohexanol, cyclohexanone, isophorone, strongly polar solvents, for example dimethyl sulfoxide, N-methylpyrrolidone and water.<br>
Powders, materials for spreading and dustable products can be prepared by mixing or concomitantly grinding the active substances with a solid carrier.<br>
Granules, for example coated granules, impregnated granules and homogeneous granules, can be prepared by binding the active compounds to solid carriers. Examples of solid carriers are mineral earths such as silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, attaclay, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials, fertilizers, such as, for example, ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas, and products of vegetable origin, such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders and other solid carriers.<br>
In general, the formulations comprise from 0.01 to 95% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 90% by weight, of the active compound. The active compounds are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum).<br>
The following are examples of formulations: 1. Products for dilution with water<br>
A)	Water-soluble concentrates (SL)<br>
10 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are dissolved in water or in a water-soluble solvent. As an alternative, wetters or other auxiliaries are added. The active compound dissolves upon dilution with water.<br>
B)	Dispersible concentrates (DC)<br>
20 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are dissolved in cyclohexanone with addition of a dispersant, for example polyvinylpyrrolidone. Dilution with water gives a dispersion.<br>
C)	Emulsifiable concentrates (EC)<br><br>
15 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are dissolved in xylene with addition of calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and castor oil ethoxylate (in each case 5% strength). Dilution with water gives an emulsion.<br>
D)	Emulsions (EW, EO)<br>
40 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are dissolved in xylene with addition of calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and castor oil ethoxylate (in each case 5% strength). This mixture is introduced into water by means of an emulsifier (Ultraturvax) and made into a homogeneous emulsion. Dilution with water gives an emulsion.<br>
E)	Suspensions (SC, OD)<br>
In an agitated ball mill, 20 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are comminuted with addition of dispersants, wetters and water or an organic solvent to give a fine active compound suspension. Dilution with water gives a stable suspension of the active compound.<br>

75 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are ground in a rotor-stator mill with addition of dispersants, wetters and silica gel. Dilution with water gives a stable dispersion or solution of the active compound.<br>
2.      Products to be applied undiluted H)     Dusts (DP)<br>
5 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are ground finely and mixed intimately with 95% of finely divided kaolin. This gives a dustable product.<br><br>
I)       Granules (GR, FG, GG, MG)<br>
0.5 part by weight of a compound according to the invention is ground finely and associated with 95.5% carriers. Customary methods are extrusion, spray-drying or the fluidized bed. This gives granules to be applied undiluted.<br>
J)      ULV solutions (UL)<br>
10 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are dissolved in an organic solvent, for example xylene. This gives a product to be applied undiluted.<br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or of the application forms prepared therefrom, e.g. in the form of directly sprayable solutions, powders, suspensions or dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dustable products, preparations for broadcasting or granules, by spraying, atomizing, dusting, broadcasting or watering. The application forms depend entirely on the intended uses; they should always ensure the finest possible dispersion of the active compounds according to the invention.<br>
Aqueous application forms can be prepared from emulsifiable concentrates, pastes or wettable powders (spray powders, oil dispersions) by addition of water. To prepare emulsions, pastes or oil dispersions, the substances can be homogenized in water, as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, by means of wetting agents, tackifiers, dispersants or emulsifiers. However, it is also possible to prepare concentrates comprising active substance, wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and possibly solvent or oil which are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
The concentrations of active compound in the ready-for-use preparations can be varied within relatively wide ranges. In general, they are between 0.0001 and 10%, preferably between 0.01 and 1%.<br>
The active compounds can also be used with great success in the ultra-low volume (ULV) process, it being possible to apply formulations with more than 95% by weight of active compound or even the active compound without additives.<br>
Oils of various types, wetting agents, adjuvants, herbicides, fungicides, other pesticides and bactericides can be added to the active compounds, if need be also not until<br><br>
immediately before use (tank mix). These agents can be added to the preparations according to the invention in a weight ratio of 1:10 to 10:1.<br>
The preparations according to the invention can, in the application form as fungicides, also be present together with other active compounds, e.g. with herbicides, insecticides, growth regulators, fungicides or also with fertilizers. On mixing the compounds I or the preparations comprising them in the application form as fungicides with other fungicides, in many cases an expansion of the fungicidal spectrum of activity is obtained.<br>
