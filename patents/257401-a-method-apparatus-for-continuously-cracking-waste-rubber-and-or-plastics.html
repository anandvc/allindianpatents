THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY	DESCRIBES	THE<br>
INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
1<br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention is about a new continuously cracking technology of waste rubber or plastics and its useful equipment, which is the key to produce oil by use of waste rubber or plastics.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
As is known, waste rubber or plastics can be re-produced into gasoline, diesel oil and others after being cracked, that not only gives out a good means for disposal of the industrial rubbish, like rubber, plastics, etc. from waste tyres and so on in modern society, but also provides a new plan for the improvement of decreasing resources and energy. However, almost none of present technologies can realize continuous production. Besides, the existing technology costs too much and has high risks for it fails to resolve the problem of remaining air in raw materials as well as the problem of air separation in the course of transport of raw materials and derivation of products. Therefore, the technology of producing oil by use of waste tyres and other rubber or plastics hasn't realized industrial continuous production.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
To the shortage existing in present technologies, this invention provides a continuously cracking technology of waste rubber or plastics and its equipment, which has high security but low cost, can realize continuous and industrial production of oil by use of waste rubber or plastics.<br>
The cracking course in this invention is to extrude and transport catalyst and rubber or plastics in the aim of separating air or preventing oxidization and transporting raw materials into the sealed cracking chamber, i.e. to expel air among and in raw materials out of the cracking chamber, meanwhile, to transport materials into it, which ensures material delivery and separation of cracking chamber and air outside both. In the cracking chamber, raw materials is transported from the inlet orifice to the discharge hole by the corresponding unit,<br><br>
cracking is finished in this process, and finally the products are automatically deviated through the discharge hole, which is also separated from the air outside. Via this process, the security in the cracking chamber can be ensured, and the continuous and industrial manufacture achieved.<br>
In specific manufacture, the air-separating or oxidization-preventing feedings can be achieved by the structure of screw conveyor unit, which has variable pitch and can operate extrusion on rubber when propelling. As the extrusion goes on, the cleft between raw materials contracts and the air ejects gradually. To some extent, not only this part of air but that in raw materials will also be forced out, so as to realize no gas exists in raw materials on arriving at the cracking chamber, and because of the closely dense space, the separation between the cracking chamber and the air outside is also achieved, which ensures the hermetical effect of the cracking chamber and the safe operation of cracking. In order to make all air in the raw materials discharged completely, the rubber or plastics may as well be heated after or simultaneously with the air separation or oxidization prevention of material feedings. After heated, air in raw materials will fully eject; especially when heated in the meantime of extrusion, the inner air in raw materials will also be discharged compulsorily, and the best effect of extrusion and separation will be achieved. In fact, if raw materials are transported to the cracking chamber directly at the same time of cracking, because of the high temperature in the cracking chamber, in the course of transport of raw materials, as they approach, heat radiation and heat conduction will occur, raw materials will surely be heated simultaneously and the friction drag in the process of feedings will also be lessened, which smoothes the air separating and oxidization preventing feedings. To guarantee the extrusion effect, the late stages of the air separating and oxidization preventing feedings may as well be operated in the hermetical cracking chamber.<br>
The gaseous products from cracking can adopt general methods. For example, we can realize sealing by the way of liquid passing. However, for solid products, the mode of spiral propeller can be used, i.e. a spiral propeller unit, which links with the discharge hole for solid products of the hermetical cracking chamber and whose front end stays higher than the back end. Under the help of weight, the solid products will be compacted at the discharge hole and sealing effect can be reached. On this basis, some space between the back-end of the screw blades of the working parts in the screw conveyor unit and the back-end of<br><br>
the discharge pipes may as well be made into cavity for a better sealing effect.<br>
To make sure the movement of raw materials in the hermetical cracking chamber, the external force shall be imposed, such as pushing by the spiral propeller and so on. Surely, a revolving drum linking closely around can also be used, whose angle of inclination is greater than 0°, equal to 10° or less; the inlet orifice and discharge hole of the cracking chamber are equipped at upper and bottom position respectively. Thus, on one hand, under the help of weight, raw materials are inclined to move to the discharge hole; on the other hand, when the drum is revolving, raw materials can move forward in a screw way, and continuous cracking goes smoothly. Besides, this method can also be useful to realize the time length of reaction needed by smaller drums and reaches the effect of less space and less cost.<br>
In addition, in order to make sure the balance of the temperature in the revolving drum and the cracking effect, the heating mode to the cracking chamber can adopt the way of inputting thermal medium reversely by two different pipes at the two terminals of the cracking chamber, i.e. thermal medium can be inputted from the two ends of the cracking chamber and through two pipes, and then goes out from their other ends respectively. That method can only use the internal heating pipes, i.e. installing the internal heating pipes through the cavity of the cracking chamber, dividing them into two parts and each inputting different ends of the cracking chamber and going out from the other ends; or only use the external heating mode, which realizes the balance of the temperature by the same heating method to the internal one. Apart from that, internal heating pipes and external heating cavity can be used simultaneously, which make the thermal medium inside move reversely and realize the balance of the temperature. Surely, an insulating unit shall be designed outside the external heating cavity to avoid loss of heat quantity as much as possible.<br>
In the above cases, the cracking temperature of this technology can choose from 350 to 550 ⁮, and the average retention time of every part of raw materials in the cracking chamber is from 20 to 60 minutes. In this way, complete cracking of raw materials can be achieved.<br>
According to the technological requirements, this invention has also designed the corresponding equipment for production. This equipment covers: a hermetical cracking chamber with the inlet orifice and discharge hole; an air-separating  and oxidization-preventing  feeding  unit during  extrusion  and<br><br>
transport, which links with the inlet orifice; in the cracking chamber, a unit transporting raw materials from the inlet to the outlet and operating cracking; and a discharge unit, which is separated from the outside air, connecting with the discharge. As is stated before, the air-separating and oxidization-preventing feeding unit can adopt an extrusion unit with continuously or discontinuously variable pitch. If raw materials need heating during transport so as to reach the best separation effect, the back-end of the feeding pipes of the air-separating and oxidization-preventing feeding unit shall be inserted into the deep of the cracking chamber. After using of the above structure, if the back space of the screw unit becomes small enough, the effect of air separation and oxidization prevention can be guaranteed. However, this may affect the feeding speed, lengthen operating period of the whole equipment and raise its cost. In the light of this, some space will be kept especially in this invention between the back-end of the feeding pipes of the screw conveyor unit and the end of the screw, and thus a cavity will be formed and complete sealing will be obtained.<br>
After the sealing problem of the inlet orifice on air separation or oxidization prevention being solved, its principle can be naturally applied into the problem of gas sealing of the discharge hole, i.e. the discharge unit will also be achieved by the spiral propulsive unit, which links with the discharge hole for solid products of the hermetical cracking chamber. Similarly, at the critical point of the best sealing, the spiral propulsive unit shall be designed to be low front-end and high back-end. Some space shall be kept between the back-end of screw blades and the back-end of the discharge pipe, and wherein a cavity will be formed.<br>
The mechanism of transportation or movement of raw materials in the cracking chamber in this invention can be realized not only by present technology, but a sealing revolving drum with heating unit can also be adopted into it. The angle between the axis of the revolving drum and the level line shall be greater than 0° and equal to 10° or less; both ends of the revolving drum can be connected through the sealing unit with the two end covers fixed at the supporting frame; the inlet orifice and discharge hole of the cracking chamber are equipped at the upper and bottom end covers respectively.<br>
As is described, the heating system in this invention can only include the internal heating pipes which are installed at the two end covers and go throughout the cavity of the cracking chamber, and also set an external heating unit with thermal insulation at the outside of the revolving drum. What's more, the external<br><br>
heating unit may as well be designed to have an outer cylinder which is equipped at the outside of the revolving drum and a thermal insulation around the outer cylinder. There is a thermal medium cavity between the revolving drum and the outer cylinder, whose liquid inlet and the liquid outlet of the internal heating pipes stay at the same end of the cracking chamber while whose liquid outlet and the liquid inlet of the internal heating pipes locate at the cracking chamber's other one. On this basis, the balance of the temperature in the cracking chamber will be guaranteed and the best cracking effect will be achieved.<br>
All in all, through separation of air and oxygen at the inlet orifice and discharge hole of the cracking chamber, this invention can completely avoid the hidden dangers brought out by letting oxygen into the cracking chamber, thus realize the industrial production of continuous feedings. The equipment of this invention can achieve cooperation between internal and external heating, so that the cracking chamber can be heated evenly and highly, and the quality of the discharge oil can be improved. The ratio of the oil can be raised from 19% in current technology to 45%-48%, and the loss of production equipment can be reduced. Therefore, production cost will become lower, safety measurement will become better and highly effective and continuous production will really come true.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Example 1:<br>
The technological process of this example is as following: transport the blocks or tablets of the rubber or plastics added with catalyst into the hermetical cracking chamber during extrusion for removing the gas among the raw materials; put pressure on the internal of the raw materials to discharge the possibly existing gas; then send the raw materials into the hermetical cracking chamber. The catalyst used in this example is well known in the fields of the cracking of rubber or plastics. In the cracking chamber, raw materials are flowing from the inlet orifice to the discharge hole under the influence of the external force or self-weight, and the cracking reaction occurs at the same time. The cracking temperature may be reached by the present technology. When the materials reaches the end of the cracking chamber, the gas formed before will be exhausted through a water-sealed unit and the solid products will be lead through the discharge hole into the equipment in the next process.<br>
The equipment in this example may adopt direct extrusion unit, peripheral exhaust unit, and finally hermetical pipes to realize extrusion and air trap. The cracking chamber can use a vertical structure, which can ensure the movement and cracking of raw materials under the direct help of gravity or the indirect influence of external forces, such as turning. After reaction, when raw materials arrive at the end of the cracking chamber, the solid products can be led out by gravity. On the other hand, the piled solid products can also seal the discharge hole<br>
Although  this   method  can  complete  the  production   automatically,  its feedings  are  generally  discontinuous.  Besides,  some  problems  in  practical application may exist, such as poor technological reliability, simple and crude equipments, large volume, and so on. Example 2:<br>
The technological process of this example is as following: transport the blocks or tablets of rubber or plastics added with catalyst into the hermetical cracking chamber at the same time of extrusion with variable pitch, The rest parts exercise the same technology as that in example 1 and here are skipped.<br>
The equipment in this technology is similar to Example 1 except the air<br><br>
trapping feeding unit is altered into the feeding unit by the screw conveyor unit, which has variable pitch and can operate extrusion on rubber when propelling. By this way, raw materials can be compacted when reaching the cracking chamber, separate the air outside and guarantee the sealing at the inlet orifice of the cracking chamber.<br>
Compared with Example 1, this example can achieve continuous feedings and provide great help to the completion of the technological process. However, problems of Example 1 in other parts still exist. Example 3:<br>
The technological process of this example is based on Example 1 or 2: Heat raw materials at the same time of air separating or oxidization preventing feedings of the rubber or plastics added with catalyst. In this way, gas inside can be extruded smoothly and the best sealing effect in the cracking chamber can be guaranteed. But the realization of this effect may adopt the mode of the installment of a heating unit in or outside of the transport unit. The corresponding equipment is improved on the basis of Example 1 and 2, for example, adding a heating unit in the feeding screw shaft or around the peripheral part of the charging line. Other parts are the same as Example 1 or 2. Example 4:<br>
The technological process of this example is as following: connect the technological process of air separating or oxidization preventing feedings stated in Example 1 and 2 with the inlet orifice of the cracking chamber. In the process of feeding, as approaching, raw materials will be heated by the heat radiation of the high temperature in the cracking chamber or the heat conduction of the charging line, which is useful to the discharge of the gas in raw materials and can strengthen the trapping effect of the cracking chamber. The rest parts in this example exercise the same technology as that in example 1 or 2 and here are skipped.<br>
The equipment in this technology is the same as that in Example 1 or 2 except the direct connection between the outlet of the extrusion feeding parts and the inlet orifice of the cracking chamber. Example 5:<br>
The technological process of this example is as following: transport raw materials into the cracking chamber following the technology in Example 1 or 2 or 3 or 4. In order to exclude adequately the gas in the raw materials and form a<br><br>
cylindrical hermetical construction naturally, the process of transport needs to push a distance forward in the cracking chamber. The other parts may adopt directly the same technology as stated in the above examples.<br>
The specific way of realization is, based on the technology in Example 1 or 2 or 3 or 4, to insert the feeding pipes some distance into the cracking chamber. This program will surely be more simple and convenient based on the structure of Example 4. Example 6:<br>
The inputting and cracking process of raw materials in this example may choose any mode from the above examples. However, because the solid products will be discharged out through the solid discharge hole, the sealing between the discharge hole and the external world will be required strictly, i.e. the process of deviation of solid products shall be sealed, which may be realized by the spiral propeller unit whose outlet end stays higher than its inlet end. What's more, the weight of the solid products and the influence of the internal pressure make the discharge hole compacted and thus the function of separation and air trap is realized.<br>
The oblique spiral propeller unit is installed at and connected with the discharge hole of the cracking chamber. This unit includes a discharge pipe, which is linked with the solid discharge hole of the cracking chamber and a screw. The position where the screw runs through the discharge pipe is higher than the inlet of the discharge pipe, and the screw connects with the driving unit. Example 7:<br>
The technological process of this example is on the basis of Example 6 to keep a cavity without spiral propelling at the end of the discharge pipe.<br>
Based on Example 6, the equipment in this technology is the spiral propelling unit, whose end of the discharge pipe is longer than the working part of the screw. Only the polish rod passes through the longer part of the discharge pipe and connects the screw and the driving part, which reinforces the sealing of air separation or oxidization prevention by the piled solid products. Example 8:<br>
The technological process of this example is the improvement of the above methods by adopting a new-style cracking chamber different from the above ones. This kind of cracking chamber includes an inclined revolving drum. The space between the drum and its fixing structure around is sealed by the present<br><br>
technology, such as steel ring, asbestos and so on. The angle of inclination of the revolving drum can range from 0° and 10° (including 10°), such as 0.01°, 0.05°,<br>
0.1°, 0.3°, 0.5°, 0.8°, 1.0°, 1.5°, 2.5°, 3°, 3.5°, 4°, 4.5°, 5°, 5.5°, 6°, 6.5°, 7°, 7.5°, 8<br>
°, 8.5°, 9°, 9.5°, 10° and so on.<br>
The equipment in the above technology needs to equip both ends of the revolving drum on two fixed end covers. Their connecting point will be sealed by current technology, like steel ring, asbestos, etc. to realize sealing at the dynamic condition and form a hermetical cracking chamber. In order to realize the movement of raw materials from the inlet orifice to the discharge hole, the inlet orifice and the discharge hole of the cracking chamber are equipped at upper and bottom end covers respectively. The driving of the revolving drum adopts the present technology, like the supporting roller below, and can also use a sprocket fixed around the drum to realize turning by the chains linking with the driving unit. Example 9:<br>
The technological process of this example can exercise any form in the examples mentioned before, except a new-style heating mode. The specific contents are as follows: transport two heat sources into the pipeline and import thermal medium from two ends of the cracking chamber reversely. The specific realizing mode in this example is to install heating pipes fixed at the two ends of the cavity of the cracking chamber. One part of the heating pipes transports heat from the discharge hole to the inlet orifice, and the other part reversely.<br>
The equipment in this example can get further realization under the help of the above examples. The specific structure is to install heating pipes fixed at the two ends of the cavity of the cracking chamber. These pipes are divided into two parts, from different entrances on two ends importing thermal medium reversely. Example 10:<br>
The technological process of this example can exercise any form in the examples mentioned before, except a new-style heating mode in the process of cracking. The specific contents are as follows: transport two heat sources into the pipeline and import thermal medium from two ends of the cracking chamber reversely. The specific realizing mode in this example is to install external<br><br>
heating pipes or heating cavities fixed at the two ends of bulkhead of the cavity of the cracking chamber. One part of the heating pipes or one heating cavity transport heat from the discharge hole to the inlet orifice, and the other part or cavity reversely.<br>
The equipment in this example can get further realization under the help of the above examples. The specific structure is to install external heating pipes or two external heating cavities fixed at the two ends of the bulkhead of the cavity of the cracking chamber. These pipes are divided into two parts, from different entrances on two ends importing thermal medium reversely. Example 11:<br>
The technological process of this example can exercise any form in the Example 1 to 8, except a new-style heating mode in the process of cracking. The specific contents are as follows: transport two heat sources into the pipeline and import thermal medium from two ends of the cracking chamber reversely. The specific realizing mode in this example is to install heating pipes fixed at the two ends of the cavity of the cracking chamber, to equip external heating cavity outside the cracking chamber and to make thermal medium transmitted reversely in the internal and external units.<br>
Based on any kind of equipment in Example 1 to 8, the specific equipment in this example is internal heating pipes in the cracking chamber and external heating cavity on the bulkhead of the cracking chamber. During production, the thermal medium inside flows reversely and thus the balance of the temperature in the cracking chamber can be achieved. Example 12:<br>
The technological process in this example is as following This example adopts the way of screw extrusion conveyance firstly to realize the air-separating feedings. Raw materials are transported directly some distance into the cracking chamber, and the end of the working part of the screw extrusion conveyance is shorter than the end of the feeding pipe, and thus a cavum without screw appears. The cracking process is carried on within a revolving drum, the temperature inside is 350⁮, and the average retention time of every part of raw materials in the cracking chamber is ranging from 20 to 60 minutes. The inside cavity of the revolving drum uses the internal heating mode and the outside has external heating unit, both transporting thermal medium oppositely for the balance of the temperature in the revolving drum. The gas<br><br>
formed from cracking at the end of the revolving drum is discharged at the hydraulic sealing outlet, and the solid discharge hole is connected with the declining spiral propeller, which adopts the uniform pitch unit or the increasing pitch unit. Besides, the inlet linking directly with the discharge pipe of the spiral propeller and the solid discharge hole of the cracking chamber stays lower than its outlet. At the end of the working part of the screw, which is longer than the end of the discharge pipe, some space is kept and thus a cavity is formed for automatic discharge.<br>
The structure of the equipment in this example is as following:<br>
It includes a motor frame 33; an outer cylinderl4 fixed on the motor frame 33 and the angle between whose axis and the level line shall be greater than 0° and less than or equal to 10°(such as 0.01°, 0.05°, 0.1°, 0.3°, 0.5°, 0.8°, 1.0°, 1.5°, 2.5, 3°, 3.5°, 4°, 4.5°, 5°, 5.5°, 6°, 6.5°, 7°, 7.5°, 8°, 8.5°, 9°, 9.5°, 10° and so on); a revolving drum 30 with the same axis to the outer cylinder 14 in it; the two ends of the revolving drum 30 are set on the two end covers 5 and 19 of the motor frame 33, and the linking parts are sealed strictly in present way; by the retarding unit 32, the electrical motor 31 drives the sprocket 7 which is fixed at the outside of the revolving drum 30 to realize the turning of the revolving drum 30; on the motor frame 33, a load-bearing rolling wheel 23 is equipped cooperating with the turning table 6 fixed at the revolving drum 30.<br>
In the revolving drum 30 of this invention, the two ends of the internal heating pipe 28 is fixed on the end covers 5 and 19 for the flowing of the thermal medium. There is a thermal insulation 29 in the outer cylinder 14, and the thermal medium cavity 11 between the outer cylinder 14 and the revolving drum 30, the inlet 8, 9 and outlet 15, 16 on the two ends of the outer cylinder 14. The flow direction of the thermal medium in the thermal medium cavity 11 is opposed to that in the internal heating pipe 28.<br>
The feeding inlet of the revolving drum 30 is set on the above end cover, and connected with air-separating feeding unit. This unit includes the feeding pipe 2 and the screw 10 which is equipped in the feeding pipe 2 and connected with the electrical motor 34 and has continuously or discontinuously smaller pitch.
