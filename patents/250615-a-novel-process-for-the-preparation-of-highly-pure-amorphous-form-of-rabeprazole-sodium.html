TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
"A NOVEL PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF HIGHLY PURE AMORPHOUS FORM OF RABEPRAZOLE SODIUM"<br>
We, CADILA HEALTHCARE LTD., a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, of Zydus Tower, Satellite Cross Roads., Ahmedabad - 380 015, Gujarat, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be  performed:<br><br><br>
A novel process for the preparation of highly pure amorphous form of Rabeprazole sodium.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Rabeprazole is a substituted benzimidazole derivative that inhibits gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme system. It has been shown, Rabeprazole significantly decreases base!! acid output as well as meal-stimulated acid output and to increase mean gastric pH after oral administration.<br>
The pharmacology of Rabeprazoli: sodium is also well described in Drugs of Future 16(1) 19 (1991) and J. Med. Chem., 35 1049 (1992).<br>
Rabeprazole sodium is represented by structural Formula (I) while Rabeprazole is represented as Formula-(II).<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Preparation of compounds of Formulae (I) and (II) are well disclosed in EP 0268956, US 5045552 and WO 01/04109. Preparation of Rabeprazole sodium (I) is described in 0268956 equivalent to US 5,045,552 in which it is obtained as white crystals with melting point of l40°C to l41°C.<br>
Japanese Patent No. 2001-39975 discloses two crystalline forms, which are characterized as Crystal-I and Crystal-II. This patent describes obtaining these two forms by the crystallization of amorphous Rabeprazole sodium or an acetone clathrate of Rabeprazole sodium from the ester solvents such as ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, etc.<br>
JP 2001-39975 does not disclose the required scientific characterization data of polymorph Crystal-I, whereas X-ray powder diffractogram, IR-spectra and DSC data are provided for characterization for polymorph Crystal-II.<br><br>
2<br><br>
WO 03/082858 discloses two crystalline forms characterized as Form-X and Form-Y. The process for producing both the crystalline forms involves reacting free Rabeprazole of the Formula (II) with C1-C4 alcoholic sodium hydroxide followed by removal of solvent. Traces of alcohol are removed by azeotropic distillation with C1-C3 halogen substituted hydrocarbon solvent. When reaction mass thus obtained is treated with the mixture of halogenated hydrocarbon solvents having C1-C3 carbon atoms and linear or cyclic hydrocarbon solvent selected from C5-Q0 alkyl series Form-X crystallizes out. But when reaction mass is treated with the mixture of alcohol having C3-C5 straight or branched alkane chain and ether solvent, Form-Y crystallizes out.<br>
X-ray powder diffractogram and IR-spectra are provided for both the Form-X and Form-Y. WO 03/082858 also teaches Form-X and Form-Y are non-solvated and hydrated compounds.<br>
WO 03/101452 describes powder form of Rabeprazole sodium afforded by the process of lyophilization. X-ray powder diffractogram and IR spectrum are not mentioned. The technique of lyophilisation is time consuming and expensive due to high energy consumption, which reduces the efficiency of production and enhances the production cost. Summary of the invention:<br>
The dissolution characteristics of an amorphous form is better than the crystalline compound, this nature is well described in Chem. Pharm. Bull. 38, 2003-2007 (1990), hence there is a constant need for the process which enables the preparation of Rabeprazole sodium in an amorphous form without simultaneous formation of crystalline forms or which will enable the conversion of crystalline forms into amorphous form.<br>
Since bioavailability of pharmaceutical compound differs from one polymorphic form to another, it is desirable to investigate all solid forms of a drug, for properties including of stability, dissolution and flow properties.<br>
This invention relates to the preparation of amorphous form of Rabeprazole sodium, which is highly pure and stable and also matches economical aspects and is suitable to the plant operations. This process also overcomes the drawbacks of previous processes. Each step of the process disclosed in this invention is important since it removes the impurity and improves quality of the product. <br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings<br>
Figs. 1 and 2 show X-ray powder diffractograms of rabeprazole sodium of the present invention. The diffractograms confirm that the product of the present invention is amorphous.<br>
3<br><br>
Disclosure of invention<br>
The compound described herein representing Formula-(II), free Rabeprazole which is chemically known as 2-[[[4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-2-methyl-2-pyridinyl]methyl]sulfinyl]-lH-benzimidazole is dissolved in organic solvent, preferably hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylene etc. or alcohol containing lower alkyl chain C1-C4, preferably isopropyl alcohol (IPA) or mixtures thereof, at temperature 10°C to 20°C. A separately prepared alcoholic solution of sodium hydroxide, most preferably sodium hydroxide solution prepared in methanol or sodium hydroxide solution prepared in methanol-water mixture is then added to Rabeprazole solution in suitable organic solvent under cooling, along with stirring. The reaction mass is then filtered through fine filter bed. The solvents are removed under reduced pressure and traces of water are removed by azeotropic distillation.<br>
Thus obtained technical grade Rabeprazole sodium is then purified by dissolving in toluene and subsequent distillation of toluene under reduced pressure. This exercise may be repeated till traces of water are removed. Finally Rabeprazole sodium is dissolved in toluene and added into straight or branched hydrocarbon solvent or mixture thereof. This affords precipitating out fine powder. The product thus obtained is then filtered and dried under reduced pressure to afford amorphous Rabeprazole sodium. This is confirmed by X-ray powder diffractograms [Figure-1 and Figure-2].<br>
The process described as here in above consistently provides pure amorphous Rabeprazole sodium having individual related substances and unknown substances 
The scope of present invention is not limited by the description, examples and suggested uses described herein, and modifications can made without departing from the spirit of invention, for example, charcoalization can be done at any stage before filtration in hot condition or at ambient temperature at the purification stage, or intermediate stage may involve solvate formation herein this process for the purpose of preparing amorphous Rabeprazole sodium. <br>
