SUPPORTING HYBRID AUTOMATIC RETRANSMISSION REQUEST IN ORTHOGONAL<br>
FREQUENCY DIVISION MULTIPLEXING ACCESS RADIO ACCESS SYSTEM<br>
[DESCRIPTIPN]<br>
FECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing Access<br>
(OFDMA) radio access system, and more particularly, to supporting a hybrid automatic<br>
retransmiseion request (HARQ) In the OFDMA radio access system. Although the present<br>
invention is suitable for a wide scope of applications, it is particularly suitable for reducing<br>
overhead generated from the retransmission despite the non-existence of transmission error if a<br>
signal is transmitted via a plurality of antennas via the same uplink or downlink data burst when<br>
using a multi-antenna system In the OFDMA radio access system supporting the HARQ.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Generally, an automatic repeat request (ARQ) Is a response message notified by a<br>
receiving side to a transmitting side after receiving the data transmitted from the transmitting<br>
side. The ARQ informs the transmitting side whether the data was correctly received.<br>
Furthermore, the ARQ can be classified Into three systems, as shown in FIGs. 1A to 1C,<br>
respectively.<br>
FIG. 1A shows a 'stop-and-walf ARQ system, in which a transmitting side waits after<br>
data transmission to receive an ACK or NACK message. The transmitting side then sends new<br>
data or retransmits former data.<br>
FIG. 1B shows a 'go-back-N1 ARQ system, In which a transmitting side continuously<br>
transmits data regardless of a response from a receiving side. After receiving a NAOK signal,<br>
the transmitting side retransmits data from a corresponding portion.<br>
FIG. 1C shows a 'selective-repeat' ARQ system, in which a transmitting side<br>
continuously transmits data regardless of a response from a receiving side. After receiving a<br><br>
WO 2006/071049	PCT/KR2005/004576<br>
-2-<br>
NACK signal, the transmitting side retransmits the data corresponding to the received NACK<br>
signal only.<br>
Hybrid ARQ {HARQ) is proposed to solve a problem occurring when a larger error<br>
occurs over a channel as a higher coding rate (Rc = 5/6, 3/4), a high-order modulation (Mod =<br>
16-QAM, 64-QAM) and the like are selected due to a demand for a data rate over 2Mbps,<br>
10Mbps or higher in a packet transmission communication system.<br>
The erroneous data In transmission Is stored in a buffer to have forward error correction<br>
(FEC) applied thereto by being combined with retransmitted Information In the HARQ system.<br>
In contrast, the erroneous data in transmission Is discarded In the ARQ system. The HARQ<br>
system is a type of system generated from combining FEC and ARQ together. Moreover, the<br>
HARQ can be mainly classified Into the following four systems.<br>
In the first system, a Type 1 HARQ system shown in FIG. 2, data is always attached to<br>
an error detection code to preferentially detect FEC (forward error correction), if there still<br>
remains an error in a packet, retransmission is requested. An erroneous packet Is discarded<br>
and a retransmitted packet is used with a same FEC code.<br>
In the second system, a Type II HARQ system called IR ARQ (Incremental redundancy<br>
ARQ) shown in FIG. 3, an erroneous packet Is not discarded but is stored in a buffer to be<br>
combined with retransmitted redundancy bits, in retransmission, parity bite except data bits are<br>
retransmitted only. The retransmitted parity bits are changed each retransmission.<br>
In the third system, a Type III HARQ system shown in FIG. 4, which is a special case of<br>
the Type II HARQ system, each packet is self-decodable. The packet is configured with an<br>
erroneous part and data to be retransmitted. This system Is more accurately decodable than<br>
the Type II HARQ system but is disadvantageous In the aspect of coding gain.<br>
In the fourth system, a Type I with soft combining' HARQ system shown In FIG. 5, a<br>
function of data initially received and stored by a transmitting Bide with retransmitted data is<br>
added to the Type I HARQ system. The Type 1 with soft combining' HARQ system Is called a<br>
metric combining or a chase combining system. This system Is advantageous in the aspect of<br><br>
WO 2006/071049	PCT/KR2005/004576<br>
-3-<br>
slgnal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) and always uses the same parity bits of the<br>
retransmitted data.<br>
Recently, many efforts have been made to research and develop OFDM (orthogonal<br>
frequency division multiplexing) or OFDMA (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access)<br>
suitable for high-speed data transmission over a wired/wireless channel. In OFDM, frequency<br>
use efficiency is raised using a plurality of carrier waves having mutual orthogonality. A process<br>
of modulating/demodulating a plurality of the carrier waves In a transmission/reception has the<br>
same result as performing IDFT (inverse discrete Fourier transform)/DFT (discrete Fourier<br>
transform) and can be implemented at a high speed using IFFT(inverse fast Fourier<br>
transformVFFT (fast Fourier transform).<br>
A principle of the OFDM is to reduce relative dispersion in a time domain by multi-path<br>
delay spread In a manner of increasing a symbol duration by dividing a high-speed data stream<br>
into a plurality of low-speed data streams and by simultaneously transmitting a plurality of the<br>
low-speed data streams using a plurality of subcarriers. And, a transmission of data by the<br>
OFDM uses a transmission symbol as a unit.<br>
Since the modulation/demodulation in the OFDM can be collectively handled for ail<br>
subcarriers using DFT (discrete Fourier transform), it Is unnecessary to design a<br>
modulator/demodulator for each of the individual subcarriers.<br>
FIG 6 illustrates a configuration of an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)<br>
modulator/demodulator. Referring to FIG. 6, a serially Inputted data stream is transformed into<br>
parallel data streams amounting to the number of subcarriers.    Inverse discrete Fourier<br>
transform (IDFT) Is carried out on each of the parallel data streams. For fast data processing,<br>
IFFT (inverse fast Fourier transform) is used. The Inverse-Fourier-transformed data is then<br>
converted to serial data again to be transmitted through frequency conversion. A receiving side<br>
receives the corresponding signal to demodulate through a reverse process.<br>
In a mobile communication system, resources include frequency channels, i.e.,<br>
frequency bands. Multiple access is a methodology of allocating the limited frequency bands to<br>
users for efficient use.  Duplexing is a connection methodology of identifying an uplink (UL)<br><br>
WO 2006/071049	PCT/KR2005/004576<br>
-4-<br>
connection and a downlink (DL) connection In bi-directional communication. Radio multiple<br>
acce68 and multiplexing systems are the basic platform technology of the radio transmission to<br>
use the limited frequency resource efficiently and depend on an assigned frequency band, the<br>
number of users, a data rate, mobility, a cell structure, a radio environment, etc.<br>
OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing), which is a 6ort of MCM (multlcanier<br>
transmission/modulation) system that uses several carriers, is a system that parallels Input data<br>
as many as the number of used carriers to transmit the data loaded on the corresponding<br>
carriers. The OFDM is a strong candidate for a radio transmission technology meeting the<br>
requirements of a fourth generation mobile communication Infrastructure and can be classified<br>
into OFDM frequency division multiple access (OFDM-FDMA), OFDM time division multiple<br>
access (OFDM-TDMA) and OFDM code division multiple access (OFDM-CDMA) according to a<br>
user's multiple access system. Each of the OFDM-FDMA, OFDM-TDMA and OFDM-COMA<br>
systems has its merits and demerits. Moreover, schemes exist to compensate for the demerits.<br>
The OFDM-FDMA (OFDMA), which is suitable for a fourth generation macro/micro<br>
cellular infrastructure, has no intra-ceil interference, a high efficiency of frequency reuse and<br>
excellent adaptive modulation and granularity. Using dispersed frequency hopping, multiple<br>
antennas, powerful encoding and the like to compensate for the demerits of the OFDM-FDMA,<br>
diversity can be raised and the Influence of Inter-cell interference can be reduced. The OFDMA<br>
can efficiently distribute resources by allocating the number of subcaniers differently according<br>
to a data rate requested by each user. Furthermore, the OFDMA can raise the transmission<br>
efficiency since it is unnecessary for each user to perform initialization using a preamble prior to<br>
data reception like OFDM-TDMA. In particular, the OFDMA, which Is suitable for a case using<br>
numerous subcarriers (e.g., a case wherein an FFT size is large), is efficiently applied to a radio<br>
communication system having a relatively wide cell area. Also, the frequency-hopping OFDMA<br>
system is used in raising a frequency diversity effect and obtaining an Intermediate interference<br>
effect by overcoming a case where a subcarrler In deep fading exists in a radio channel or a<br>
case where there exists subcarrier interference caused by another user. FIG. 6 shows the<br><br>
WO 2006/071049	PCT/KR2005/004576<br>
-5-<br>
OFDMA system, In which an allocated grid performs frequency-hopping In a frequency domain<br>
according to a time slot.<br>
FIG. 7 is a structural diagram of a data frame in an OFDMA radio communication system<br>
according to the related art. Referring to FIG. 7, a horizontal axis Is a time axis represented by<br>
a symbol unit and a vertical axis is a frequency axis represented by a subchannel unit The<br>
subchannel refers to a bundle of a plurality of subcarriers. In particular, in an OFDMA physical<br>
layer, active carriers are divided into groups to be transmitted to different receiving ends,<br>
respectively. Thus, the group of subcarriers transmitted to one receiving end Is called a<br>
subchannel. In this case, the carriers configuring the subchannel can be adjacent to each other<br>
or can be spaced uniformly apart from each other.<br>
A slot allocated to each user, as shown in FIG. 7, is defined by a data region of a two-<br>
dimensional space, which is a set of consecutive subchannels allocated by a burst. In the<br>
OFDMA, one data region, as shown in FIG. 7, can be represented as a rectangle determined by<br>
time and subchannel coordinates. Such a data region can be allocated to a specific user's<br>
uplink. Also, a base station can transmit such a data region to a specific user in downlink.<br>
In the related art OFDM/OFDMA radio communication system, in case that data exists to<br>
be transmitted to a mobile subscriber station (MSS), a base station (BS) allocates a data region<br>
to be transmitted via a DL-MAP (downlink-MAP). The mobile subscriber station receives the<br>
data via the allocated region (DL bursts #1 to #5 in FIG. 7).<br>
In FIG. 7, a downlink subframe starts with a preamble used for synchronization and<br>
equalization In a physical layer and a structure of an entire frame Is defined via broadcast-<br>
formatted downlink MAP (DL-MAP), and uplink-MAP (UL-MAP) messages defining locations and<br>
usages of bursts allocated-to the unlink and downlink, respectively.<br>
The-DL-MAP message defines the usage allocated per burst to a downlink interval in a<br>
burst-mode physical layer, and the UL-MAP message defines the usage of the burst allocated to<br>
an uplink interval. In an information element (IE) configuring the DL-MAP message, a downlink<br>
traffic interval is identified on a user end by DIUC (downlink Interval usage code) and position<br>
information (e.g., subchannel offset, symbol offset, subchannel number, symbol number) of the<br><br>
WO 2006/071049	PCT/KR2005/004576<br>
-6-<br>
burst. Meanwhile, In an Information element configuring the UL-MAP massage, the usage is<br>
determined by UIUC (uplink interval usage code), per CID (connection ID) and a position of a<br>
corresponding interval is regulated by 'duration'. In this case, the usage per interval is<br>
determined according to a value of the UIUC used in the UL-MAP. Each Interval starts from a<br>
point having a distance away from a previous IE start point, wherein the distance is as far as the<br>
'duration' regulated by the UL-MAP IE.<br>
A DCD (downlink channel descriptor) message and a UCD (uplink channel descriptor)<br>
message include modulation types, FEC code types and the like as physical layer associated<br>
parameters to be applied to the burst intervals allocated to the downlink and the. uplink,<br>
respectively. Also, necessary parameters {e.g., K, R, etc. of R-S code) according to various<br>
forward error correction code types are provided. These parameters are given by burst profiles<br>
provided for the UIUC (uplink interval usage code) and DIUC (downlink Interval usage code) in<br>
the UCD and DCD, respectively.<br>
In the OFDMA communication system, the burst allocating method can be classified into<br>
a general MAP method and a HARQ method according to whether the HARQ system Is<br>
supported.<br>
The burst allocating method of the general MAP in downlink teaches a rectangular shape,<br>
as shown in FIG. 7, configured with time and frequency axes. Namely, it teaches a start symbol<br>
number (symbol offset), a start subchannel number (subchannel offset), the number of used<br>
symbols (No. OFDMA symbols) and the number of used subchannels (No. Subchannels).<br>
Since a method of allocating bursts to a symbol axis sequentially is used in the uplink, uplink<br>
bursts can be allocated by teaching the number of the used symbols only.<br>
FIG. 8 is a diagram of a data frame according to a HARQ MAP. Referring to FIG. 8, in<br>
the HARQ MAP, a method of allocating bursts along a subchannel (subcarrler) axis sequentially<br>
Is used in both uplink and downlink, which is different from that of a general MAP. In the HARQ<br>
MAP, a length of a burst Js informed only. In this method, bursts, as shown in FIG. 8, are<br>
sequentially allocated. A start position of a burst corresponds to a position where a previous<br>
burst ends and occupies a radio resource amounting to an allocated length from the start<br><br>
WO 2006/071049	PCT/KR2005/004576<br>
-7-<br>
posltion. The method explained In the following relates to a method for allocating bursts In an<br>
accumulative form along a frequency axis. A method for allocating bursts along a time axis<br>
follows the same principle.<br>
In the HARQ MAP, a MAP message may be divided into a plurality of MAP messages<br>
(e.g., HARQ MAP#1, HARQ MAP#2, .... , HARQ MAP#N) so that each of the divided MAP<br>
messages can have Information of a random burst. For instance, a MAP message #1 can<br>
Include Information of a burst #1, a MAP message #2 can Include information of a burst #2, and<br>
a MAP message #3 can include Information of bursts #3~#5.<br>
As mentioned in the foregoing description, the OFDMA system uses the HARQ MAP to<br>
support the HARQ. Since a HARQ MAP pointer IE is Included In the DL MAP, a method exists<br>
for allocating bursts sequentially along a downlink subchannel axis in the HARQ MAP If a<br>
position of the HARQ MAP is informed. A start position of a burst corresponds to a position<br>
where a previous burst ends and occupies a radio resource amounting to an allocated length<br>
from the start position, which is applied to the uplink as it is.<br>
In the HARQ MAP, control Information should be informed. Table 1 shows a data format<br>
of a HARQ control IE to indicate the control information.<br>
[Table 1]<br><br>
Syntax	Size (bits)	Nates<br>
HARQ_Control_lB0{		<br>

		1= enable HARQ<br>

SPED	2	Subpacket ID<br>
ACID	4	HARQ CH ID<br>
}else{		<br>
reserved	3	Shall be set to zero<br>
}		<br>
}		<br>
The control information includes AI_SN, SPID, SCID, etc. The AI_SN is a value, which<br>
is toggled between '0' and '1' if a burst transmission Is successful over a same ARQ channel, for<br>
indicating whether a transmitted burst is a new burst or corresponds to a retransmission of a<br><br>
WO 2006/071049	PCT/KR2005/004576<br>
-8-<br>
prevlous burst Four kinds of redundancy bits are reserved for the data bits put in each burst for<br>
the HARQ transmission. The SPID Is a value for selecting a different redundancy bit during<br>
each retransmission. The SCID Is a HARQ channel ID.<br>
An ACK signal region of the uplink is informed via an ACK/NACK signal whether, the<br>
transmitted data burst was successfully received. If a mobile subscriber station receives a burst<br>
at an i* frame, the ACK/NACK signal is sent to the ACK signal region of the uplink of an (l+j)*<br>
frame. A value of 'J' Is sent by the UCD. In allocating the ACK signal region, one method exists<br>
for allocating the ACK signal region to the uplink for each HARQ message. Another method<br>
exists wherein at least two of a plurality of HARQ MAP messages of a frame uses one ACK<br>
signal region.<br>
A method wherein slots of an ACK/NACK signal of a burst Indicated by a HARQ MAP<br>
message is sequentially informed by deciding an HARQ ACK region of a frame as one Is<br>
explained in detail as follows.<br>
FIG. 9 Is a diagram of a method for allocating an HARQ signal region In an HARQ MAP<br>
message. In an HARQ MAP message, an ACK signal region Is allocated to an uplink using a<br>
start position of the ACK signai region and four' kinds of information (OFDMA symbol offset,<br>
Subchannel offset, No. OFDMA Symbols, No. Subchannels). Each mobile subscriber station<br>
sequentially inputs an ACK/NACK signal to the ACK signal region (FIG. 9) allocated to the<br>
uplink for indicating whether a respective burst has been successfully received. A start position<br>
of the ACK/NACK signai corresponds to a position next to that of the previously received<br>
ACK/NACK information. A sequence of ACK/NACK signals follows a burst sequence of a<br>
downlink within the HARQ MAP message. Namely, like the sequence of bursts #1 to #7, the<br>
ACK/NACK signals within the allocated HARQ ACK region of the uplink are sent in a sequence<br>
that corresponds to the sequence of the bursts #1 to #7.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, a MAP message #1 includes allocation Information of burate #1 and<br>
#2, a MAP message #2 Includes allocation information of bursts #3 and #4, and a MAP<br>
message #3 includes allocation information of bursts #5 to #7. Mobile subscriber station #1<br>
(MSS#1) reads the information of the burst #1 in the contents of the MAP message #1 and then<br><br>
WO 2006/071049	PCT/KR2005/004576<br>
-9-<br>
informs an initial slot within the HARQ ACK signal region Indicated by an HARQ MAP message<br>
whether the transmitted data was successfully received. MSS#2 knows its position within the<br>
HARQ ACK signal region by recognizing that it is sequentially next to that of the ACK/NACK<br>
signal slot of the burst #1 within the ACK signal region (position within the HARQ ACK region is<br>
known by incrementing a count of the burst #1 wtthln the contents of the MAP message #1).<br>
MSS#3 knows its position within the HARQ ACK region by calculating a total amount of slots of<br>
the bursts #1 and #2 of the MAP message #1. Thus, the positions within the HARQ ACK region<br>
can be sequentially known.<br>
In case that one'mobile subscriber station supporting a multi-antenna to an area of the<br>
downlink burst loads data on the same area to transmit or In case that several mobile subscriber<br>
stations load data on the same area to transmit, the ACK signal is sent only If there Is no error In<br>
a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for all layers. Otherwise, the NACK signal Is sent in this<br>
case, a layer means a coding unit of the transmitted data and the number of layers directly<br>
corresponds to the number of antennas depending on how the data is transmitted. For example,<br>
 if the entire daja to be transmitted is coded. A CRC is then inserted in the coded data. This is<br>
then divided by the number of antennas. If the divided data are transmitted via all the antennas,<br>
the number of layers is equal to one. In another example, if data to be loaded on each antenna<br>
is coded. A CRC is then inserted in the coded data. If the coded data Is transmitted, the<br>
number of layers is equal to the number of antennas (cf. FIG. 10). The above-explained<br>
situation is applicable to a case Where a mobile subscriber station transmits a burst in uplink<br>
and a case where a base station having received the burst sends an ACK signal In downlink.<br>
The above-explained related art method can be simply applied to a system that is not a<br>
multi-antenna system. Yet, In case of the multi-antenna system, the related art method brings<br>
about a waste of resources. For example, If a base station detects a case that two mobile<br>
subscriber stations #1 and #2 load their data on the burst #2, the number of layers is 2.<br>
Furthermore, the burst of the mobile subscriber station #1 Is not erroneous but the burst of the<br>
mobile subscriber station #2 is erroneous. The base station then sends a NACK signal to both<br>
the mobile subscriber stations #1 and #2 according to the aforesaid principle of the related art<br><br>
WO 2006/071049	PCT/KR2005/004576<br>
-10-<br>
If so, both of the mobile subscriber stations should send the data again.  Consequently, the<br>
errorless, data of the mobile subscriber station #1 is discarded to be retransmitted, which is a<br>
waste of resources.  Moreover, the same problem of the uplink can be directly applied to the<br>
case of the downlink.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to supporting hybrid automatic retransmission request<br>
(HARQ) in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access (OFDMA) radio access system.<br>
Specifically, the present invention relates to transmitting packet data in a wireless<br>
communication system configured to support multiple input and multiple output.<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible,<br>
the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to* refer to the same or like<br>
parts.<br>
The present invention discloses a method for sending an ACK or NACK signal per layer<br>
when a multi-antenna system is applied to an uplink or downlink data burst. In other words,<br>
ACK/NACK signal transport channels amounting to the number of layers allocated to the data<br>
burst are allocated to % uplink or downlink data burst having the multi-antenna system applied<br>
thereto.<br>
When a mobile subscriber station supporting a multi-antenna in a downlink burst sends<br>
data loaded in the same frame or in case that several mobile stations send data loaded in the<br><br>
WO 2006/071049	PCT/KR2005/004576<br>
-16-<br>
same frame, signals of all layers are loaded in the same frame. Yet, a receiving side detects the<br>
signals and identifies the signal per the layer. And, it Is able to know a presence or non-<br>
presence of ecror of the per layer signal by performing a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for the<br>
signal of the identified layer.<br>
The present invention intends to enable a transmitting side to know the presence or non-<br>
presence of error of the signal per layer by transmitting an ACK or NACK signal. To support this,<br>
allocation of an ACK or NACK channel per layer is needed so that the presence or non-<br>
presence of error can be carried. Via the channels, a side having transmitted a burst can<br>
receive the ACK or NACK signal per layer and then decide a next transmission form. For<br>
example, by re-transmitting the signal of the layer corresponding to the received NACK or by<br>
stopping transmission of the signal of the layer corresponding to the received ACK until other<br>
layers receive the ACK signals according to an implementation method of the system,<br>
interference with other signals is reduced.<br>
By loading other data, the system Is able to increase a transmission capacity. Thus, to<br>
use a different transmission method per layer, control Information should be given to each layer.<br>
For example, in the related art, the combined control information is given since all layers receive<br>
the ACK or NACK together. Yet, according to the present invention, various kinds of control<br>
information is preferably given such as information indicating whether each layer receives the<br>
ACK or NACK, whether to give a new burst, whether to retransmit a previous burst (AI_SN),<br>
which redundancy bit of four types (SPID) will be given and information regarding an H-ARQ<br>
channel ID (SCID).<br>
FIG 11 is a diagram of a data frame In an OFDMA radio access system in accordance<br>
with a preferred embodiment of the present Invention. Preferably, an ACK/NACK transport<br>
channel allocating method conducted by a base station transmitting data by two layers to a<br>
plurality of mobile subscriber stations applying a multi-antenna system is shown.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, a base station allocates a downlink ACK region (DL-ACK SIGNAL<br>
REGION) to a downlink (DL) subframe and an uplink ACK signal region (UL-ACK SIGNAL<br>
REGION) to an uplink (UL) subframe. The downlink ACK signal region is a region allocated for<br><br>
WO 2006/071049	PCT/KR2005/004576<br>
-17-<br>
an ACK or NACK signal transmitted by the base station In response to data transmitted from a<br>
plurality of mobile subscriber stations. The uplink ACK signal region Is a region allocated for<br>
ACK or NACK signals transmitted by one or more of mobile subscriber stations In response to<br>
data transmitted from the base station.<br>
In case that the base station transmits data bursts comprising two layers, the mobile<br>
subscriber stations receiving the data bursts by the two layers check for a transmission error of<br>
the data transmitted per each layer of the base station (e.g., CRC check). If there is no<br>
transmission error per .layer according to a checked result, a corresponding mobile subscriber<br>
station transmits an ACK signal. If there exists the transmission error, a corresponding mobile<br>
subscriber station transmits a NACK signal. One ACK/NACK transport channel is allocated for<br>
the mobile subscriber stations receiving the data burst transmitted with one layer by the base<br>
station. Consequently, ACK/NACK transport channels #1-1, #1-2, #2-1, #2-2, #3, #4 ...<br>
amounting to the same number of layers used for the.base station to transmit the respective<br>
data bursts are allocated to the uplink ACK signal region of the uplink subframe for the mobile<br>
subscriber stations, respectively.<br>
Within the downlink ACK signal region, the base station allocates the ACK/NACK<br>
transport channels #2-1 and #2-2 per layer for the mobile subscriber station transmitting data by<br>
 two layers and one ACK/NACK transport channel #1, #3, #4 or the like for each of the mobile<br>
subscriber stations that use one, layer each. The base station checks for a transmission error<br>
 for the data transmitted from the corresponding mobile subscriber station (e.g., CRC check). If<br>
there is no transmission error per layer according to a checked result, the base station transmits<br>
an ACK signal. If a transmission error exists, the base station transmits a NACK signal.<br>
The ACK/NACK transport channel can be sequentially allocated along a time axis within<br>
 the uplink ACK signal region and the downlink ACK signal region, along a frequency axis, or<br>
along frequency and time axes alternately. Alternatively, a half subchannel may be used per<br>
one ACK or NACK signal to be allocated along frequency and time axes alternately in order, as<br>
shown in FIG. 12. Preferably, the half subchannel includes twenty-four subcarriers.<br><br>
WO 2006/071049	PCT/KR2005/004576<br>
-18-<br>
FIG 13 is an exemplary diagram of a method for allocating the ACK/NACK transport<br>
channels within uplink and downlink ACK signal regions in accordance with another<br>
embodiment of the present Invention. Preferably, an uplink or downlink ACK region for a mobile<br>
subscriber station having a multi-antenna system is separately allocated within an uplink ACK<br>
signal region and a downlink ACK signal region.<br>
Referring to FIG. 13, for a mobile subscriber station transmitting a data burst by two<br>
layers (2-layer) within a downlink ACK region, one ACK/NACK transport channel #2-1 for a first<br>
layer is allocated together with an ACK/NACK transport channel for a mobile subscriber station<br>
transmitting a data burst by one layer. The other ACK/NACK transport channel #2-2 tor a<br>
second layer is allocated by establishing a separate ACK region within the downlink ACK region.<br>
Preferably, the same method is applied to an uplink ACK region (UL-ACK region).<br>
In FIG. 13, a base station transmits an HARQ DL burst #2 by four layers (4-layer). The<br>
separate ACK region allocated for the second or higher-order layer Is preferably allocated next<br>
to the region to which the ACK/NACK transport channel for the first layer is allocated.<br>
FIG 14 Is an exemplary diagram of a method for allocating the ACK/NACK transport<br>
channels within uplink and downlink ACK signal regions in accordance with another<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In FIG. 14, an uplink or downlink ACK region for a mobile subscriber station having a<br>
multi-antenna system Is'separately allocated within an uplink ACK signal region and a downlink<br>
ACK signal region. The method shown in FIG. 14 differs from the method embodied in FIG. 13<br>
in that a plurality of ACK/NACK transport channels #2-2, #2-3 and #2-4 for the same data burst<br>
having a plurality of layers applied thereto are allocated as one ACK/NACK transport channel<br>
using a codeword. Namely, in the example shown in FIG 14, the codeword Is used to reduce a<br>
range of the uplink ACK region because the range of the uplink ACK region can be<br>
   unnecessarily extended ifithe number of layers is raised.<br>
Table 2 and Table 3 show examples of codewords to support FIG 14.<br>
[Table 2]<br><br>
Codeword [layer4, layer3, layer2]	Group sets (total 24 subcarriers)<br><br>
WO 2006/071049	PCT/KR2005/004576<br>
-19-<br><br>
In transmission of an uplink ACK/NACK signal, as mentioned in the foregoing description,<br>
a half subchannel includes twenty-four subcarriers per one ACK or NACK signal. If the<br>
codeword in Table 2 or Table 3 is used, it is able to transmit one to three ACK or NA£K signals<br>
using the twenty-four subcarriers. The examples in Table 2 and Table 3 define the codeword for<br>
four layers, which are applicable to two or three layers as well. Preferably, for the data burst<br>
having three layers appjied thereto, the codeword associated with the layer-4 In Table 1 and<br>
Table 3 is ignored. For the data burst having two layers applied thereto, the codewords<br>
associated with the layer-4 and the layer-3 In Table 1 and Table 3 are ignored.<br>
Meanwhile, in case of downlink, like the related art method, the necessity for using the<br>
codeword is lowered if an ACK/NACK signal is transmitted using one bit<br>
FIG. 15 Is an exemplary diagram of a method for allocating the ACK/NACK transport<br>
channels within uplink and downlink AOK signal regions in accordance with another<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
WO 2006/071049	PCT/KR2005/004576<br>
-20-<br>
Referring to FIG. 15, an ACK region for a mobile subscriber station using a data burst<br>
and having a multi-antenna system applied thereto Is separately allocated in the same manner<br>
as FIG 13 or FIG. 14. ACK/NACK transport channels are allocated to the rest uplink or<br>
downlink ACK region. Hence, an ACK signal is sent only if a CRC is not erroneous for all layers.<br>
Otherwise, a NACK signal Is sent<br>
Table 4 and Table 5 show formats of MIMO compact DL-MAP IE and MIMO compact UL-<br>
MAP IE according to one embodiment of the present Invention, respectively,<br><br>

Since it is unable to provide control Information per layer, the related art Information<br>
element (IE) is not capable of supporting the present Invention. Hence, the information<br>
message (MIMO Compact DL/UL MAP IE) to support the HARQ multi-antenna should be<br>
provided with various kinds of control information to enable each layer to have a different<br>
operation. In this case, the various kinds of control Information Include information Indicating<br>
whether a new burst will be given or a previous burst will be retransmitted according to ACK or<br>
NACK provided to each layer (AI_SN), Information indicating which redundancy bit of the four<br>
types will be given (SPID), and information of H-ARQ channel ID (SCID). The various kinds of<br>
control information can have fields directly arranged In the Information message (MIMO<br>
Compact DL/UL MAP IE) supporting the HARQ multi-antenna if necessary. Alternatively, the<br>
various kinds of control information can be used in a manner of inserting the related art<br>
information element 'Control_IE' in the information message (MIMO Compact DL/UL MAP iE)<br>
supporting the HARQ multi-antenna.<br>
Accordingly, in the present Invention, in case that the multi-antenna system transmits<br>
signals by a plurality of antennas via the same upilnk or downlink data burst, the ACK or NACK<br>
signal is transmitted per layer. Hence, the present Invention can reduce the overhead<br>
generated from the retransmission regardless of the transmission error.<br>

present invention may also be used In any wireless communication systems using mobile<br>
devices, such as PDAs and laptop computers equipped with wireless communication<br>
