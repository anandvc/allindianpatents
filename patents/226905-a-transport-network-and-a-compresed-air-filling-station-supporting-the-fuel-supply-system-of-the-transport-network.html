				<td>TRANSPORT NETWORKâ€” COMPRISING A FLEET OF VEHICLES, BOAT<br>
AND-COMPRESSED AIR FILLING STATION FOR SUCH A NETWORK<br><br>
The present invention relates to a transport network<br>
comprising a fleet of self-propelled vehicles.<br>
particularly boats, each of which, to propel it, calls<br>
upon an on-board autonomous source of compressed gas,<br>
particularly compressed air.<br>
The invention relates to navicration in this way on a<br>
water course and more particularly to the driving and<br>
powering of a fleet of river buses or river boats,<br>
particularly in an urban environment, so as, for<br>
example, to form a river-borne public transport<br>
network.<br>
Passenqer transport boats such as river buses and the<br>
like are mainly powered by diesel engines and are thus<br>
particularly polluting.<br>
At the present time, projects for clean boats powered<br>
by electric motors are being envisaged, but they are<br>
very expensive to power.<br>
Numerous patent applications published, in the name of<br>
the applicant of the current patent application, under<br>
the numbers WO 96/27737, WO 97/39232, WO 97/48884,<br>
WO 9B/15440_and WO 98/32963 are known, these describing<br>
and depicting propulsion systems operating on<br>
compressed air with the injection of additional<br>
compressed air to produce pollution-free or<br>
de-polluting engines.<br>
These engines are applied to land vehicles but can also<br>
be applied to boats and other snips sucn as pleasure<br>
boats on rivers or passenger transport boats in an<br>
urban environment, such as river buses.<br><br>
These engines are supplied with compressed air by high-<br>
pressure reservoirs installed on board the vehicle,<br>
particularly on board the boat, and these on-board,<br>
high-pressure reservoirs are filled either by a<br>
compressor, which is itself on board and driven by an<br>
electric motor (see French patent application<br>
No. WO 98/12 062) or by transferring volumes of<br>
compressed air from an external high-pressure reservoir<br>
which forms a kind of service station for resupplying<br>
with compressed air.<br>
The invention aims to propose a transport network in<br>
which the compressed-air filling Station can be<br>
installed and operate particularly economically,<br>
without causing pollution, and which can easily be<br>
incorporated into the landscape.<br>
To this end, the invention proposes a transport network<br>
comprising a fleet of self-propelled vehicies each of<br>
which, to propel it, calls upon an on-board autonomous<br>
source of compressed gas, particularly compressed air,<br>
and at least one pressurized-gas filling station,<br>
characterized in that the station is installed near a<br>
natural or forced water caurse and comprises a turbine<br>
driven by the flow of the water and a gas, particularly<br>
air, compressor which is driven by the turbine.<br>
According to another embodiment, the station is<br>
installed near a sea or an ocean and comprises a<br>
turbine driven by the movement of the waves or by tidal<br>
energy.<br>
The high-pressure reservoirs of the service station are<br>
thus filled completely or in part by a compressor<br>
driven directly by a water turbine itself driven by the<br>
current of the water course or by a drop formed therein<br>
or alternatively by the movement of the waves or by<br>
tidal energy, thus making the transport line in<br>
question independent in terms of its energy.<br><br>
According to other features of the network:<br>
the filling station comprises means of storing the<br>
pressurized gas;<br>
the water turbine is arranged at the foot of a<br>
natural or artificial drop in the water course;<br>
the vehicles comprise a fleet of boats which<br>
navigate on the water course;<br>
each boat takes a route in tne form or a loop, and<br>
the filling station is installed at some point in<br>
the loop.<br>
The invention also DroDoses a boat for a network<br>
according to the invention characterized in that it<br>
comprises means of connection to the station for<br>
refilling its pressurized-gas reserve.<br>
Finally, the invention also proposes a pressurized-gas,<br>
particularly compressed-air, filling station for a<br>
network according to the teachings of the invention.<br>
Other objects, advantages and characteristics of the<br>
invention will become apparent from reading the<br>
(nonlimiting) description of several embodiments, which<br>
description is given with reference to the appendea<br>
drawings, in which:	<br>
figure 1 is a schematic perspective view of a<br>
river bus belonging to a transport network<br>
according to the teachings of the invention and<br>
which is illustrated while it is being refilled<br>
with compressed air in a filling station according<br>
to the teachings of the invention; and<br>
figure 2 is a diagrammatic view which depicts the<br>
installation of the network and of the station in<br>
an urban environment in combination with a fleet<br>
of land vehicles.<br>
Figure 1 shows a quay 10 alongside a river 12 on which<br>
a river bus 14 floats, this being a public transport<br><br>
vehicle whose means of propulsion, not depicted,<br>
comprise, in a known way, an engine which calls upon a<br>
source of compressed air consisting of a high-pressure<br>
reservoir, not depicted, held on board the boat and<br>
which has regularly to be refilled with compressed air.<br>
For this purpose, a filling service station 16 is built<br>
on the quay 10 and in particular comprises a first<br>
compressed-air filling point 18 to which the boat 14,<br>
when refilling is in progress, is connected by a pipe<br>
20.<br>
The service station 16 may also comprise a second<br>
filling point 22 which is designed more specifically<br>
for refilling the high-pressure compressed-air<br>
reservoir of a land vehicle 24.<br>
The two points 18, 22 will of course be connected to a<br>
reserve 26 of compressed air under pressure which is<br>
here depicted schematically in the form of a tank or<br>
reservoir buried in the quay 10.<br>
According to another embodiment, the reservoir is<br>
buried underground at a depth that allows some<br>
geothermal energy to be recovered by heating the<br>
compressed air.<br>
According to the teachings of the invention, the<br>
reserve 26 is refilled with compressed air via a<br>
compressor 28 which is driven by a water turbine 30<br>
which is itself driven or propelled by the flow of the<br>
water in the water course 12.<br>
Thus, the source of power driving the turbine 30 is<br>
free insofar as it consists of the flow of the river.<br>
In order to improve the refilling capacities of the<br>
reserve 26, the filling station 16 may be installed at<br><br>
a point in the water course such that the turbine 30<br>
lies at a natural or contrived drop in the river 12.<br>
The link between the compressor 28 and the turbine 30<br>
may be via various suitable means depending on the<br>
installation and on the nature of the compressor 28 and<br>
of the turbine 30.<br>
By way of a numerical example, the turbine 30 is, for<br>
example, a 500-kilowatt microturbine driving an air<br>
compressor capable of producing 2 000 m3 of compressed<br>
air per hour. The capacity of the reserve is 4 000 m3<br>
to resupply 6 river buses each of which has a reservoir<br>
that holds 900 m3 of compressed air at a pressure of<br>
300 bar, consumes 300 m3 per hour and resupplies every<br>
three hours.<br>
As can be seen in the diagram of figure 2, the filling<br>
station 16 may be installed at a point on the bank of<br>
the water course 12 which also constitutes a point of<br>
embarkation onto the river buses 14. The station 16 may<br>
also be installed near a parking area 32 onto which<br>
several vehicles 24 can draw up and refill with<br>
compressed air at the station 16, the latter therefore<br>
preferably having several refilling points 18 and<br>
refilling points 22 for the boats 14.<br>
The design according to the invention thus makes it<br>
possible, particularly in an urban environment, to have<br>
a free, non-polluting source of power which is not<br>
dangerous to score.<br>
In the case of longer routes, it is of course possible<br>
to install several autonomous filling stations each<br>
comprising its own water turbine-compressor assembly,<br>
for example at each of the ends of the route.<br>
The invention also has the advantage of reducing the<br>
nuisance occasioned by installing compressed-air<br><br>
vehicle filling stations in that it is no longer<br>
necessary for them to be installed near a source of<br>
electrical power for driving the compressor in<br>
rotation, or near a road allowing the compressor to be<br>
resupplied with fuel.<br>
The invention finds an application regardless of the<br>
type of boat or ship that is to be resupplied with<br>
compressed air, and regardless of the type of water<br>
course, river, major river, or alternatively of a sea<br>
or an ocean, etc.<br><br>
