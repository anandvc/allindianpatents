The present invention relates to a process for preparing hydrogen peroxide.<br>
It is known that a mixture of gaseous oxygen and gaseous hydrogen forms an explosive material. Virtually all currently produced hydrogen peroxide is produced by indirectly combining hydrogen and oxygen. Thus, the primary conventional industrial method for production of hydrogen peroxide uses a chemical agent first for the reduction or hydrogenation. Typically  alkylanthraquinone, such as ethyl or tertiary butyl anthraquinone, is used as the chemical agent. This working solution contains organic solvents such as di-isobutylcarbinol and methyl naphthalene. Oxidation of the intermediate product of the reduction reaction produces hydrogen peroxide and the original alkylanthraquinone. The anthraquinone is recycled back through the process. This method has the shortcoming that there is a considerable loss of the anthraquinone and the organic solvents from oxidation and thermal degradation of these organic<br><br>
materials.     The  presence  of  these  organics  with  oxygen  and hydrogen  peroxide  presents  safety  hazards  from  their  potential reactions.     This  destruction  of  organics  involves  high  operating losses  for  the  currently  practiced  commercial  process.<br>
Various  methods  have  been  attempted  to  directly  combine oxygen  and  hydrogen  to  overcome  the  above-described  problems. The  direct  combination  of  hydrogen  and  oxygen  to  form  hydrogen peroxide  has  the  advantage  of  not  requiring  the  use  of  any organic  or  combustible  materials.     The  direct  process,   however, does  require  careful  control  of  the  gaseous  mixture  of  oxygen  and hydrogen  so  that  they  are  always  outside  the  explosive  range.<br>
There  have  been  numerous  patents  issued  for  the  direct combination  of  hydrogen  and  oxygen  to  produce  hydrogen  peroxide. U.S.   Patents  4,347,232  and  4,336,240  employ  an  two  phase  system through  the  use  of  organic  compounds  to  form  a  second  phase. However,   the  organics  can  react  with  oxygen  or  hydrogen  peroxide to  render  these  processes  uneconomical.<br>
Other  patents  employ  a  fixed  bed  catalyst  within  a reaction  vessel  which  has  low  conversion  per  pass  or  low  reactor productivity  (see  for  example,   U.S.   Patents  4,336,239  and 5,082,647).<br>
U.S.   Patent  5,169,618   ('618  patent),  to  Marischino describes  establishing  a  pulse-flow  regime  in  a  catalyst  bed. The  '618  patent  has  the  limitation  of  low  conversion  of  hydrogen peroxide  per  pass  and  high  equipment  costs.<br><br>
U.S.   Patent  4,996,039  describes  first  absorbing hydrogen  into  the  aqueous  reaction  mixture  with  a  catalyst; dropping  the  pressure  to  remove  all  the  hydrogen  in  the  gas phase;   and  then  introducing  the  oxygen  in  order  to  produce hydrogen  peroxide.     This  technique  minimizes  the  presence  of hydrogen  in  the  gaseous  phase.     This  process   is  expensive  to repressor  the  reactor  with  oxygen  and  doesn't  lend  itself  to continuous  processing.<br>
Continuous  modes  of  operation  for  the  direct combination  process  have  also  been  proposed,   as  disclosed  in  U.S. Patents   4,009,252;   4,279,883;   4,681,751;   and   4,772,458.     These patents  employ  a  catalyst  as  a  slurry   in  an  agitated  reactor. These  patents  have  the  drawback  of  having  either  low  conversion per  pass  or  low  volumetric  efficiency  either  of  which  is uneconomical.<br>
U.S.   Patent  4,661,337   ('337   patent)   describes  a  process for  direct  combination  for  producing  hydrogen  peroxide  of increased  concentration.     The  volume  of  the  reaction  mixture occupies  a  small  portion  of  the  available  volume  of  the  reactor. It  is  taught  in  the  '337  patent  that  the  layer  of  reaction mixture  has  a  thickness  of  no  more  that  2  millimeters.     This patent  has  the  disadvantage  that  the  majority  of  the  reactor  is in  the  gas  phase  in  which  no  hydrogen  peroxide  if  formed.<br>
In  all  the  above  described  patents,   there  is  a  separate continuous  gaseous  phase  in  which  it  is  necessary  to  inject  an<br><br>
inert  gas  such  as  nitrogen,   argon  or  helium  in  order  to  remain outside  the  explosive  range  of  hydrogen  and  oxygen.<br>
Other  attempts  for  the  direct  formulation  of  hydrogen peroxide  use  liquid  filled  reactors  without  a  continuous  gas phase.     U.S.   Patent  5,104,635  describes  a  liquid  filled  reactor with  two  internal  membranes  which  each  are  permeable  only  for hydrogen  and  oxygen,   respectively.     This  reaction  system  requires considerable  capital  for  the  use  of  the  membranes.<br>
U.S.   Patent  No.   4,279,883  describes  a  process  for preparing  hydrogen  peroxide   in  an  aqueous  medium.     The  aqueous medium  contains  dissolved  hydrogen  and  a  platinum-group  catalyst having  absorbed  thereto  hydrogen.     Inert  nitrogen  and  argon  are blown  into  the  aqueous  medium  so  that  no  dissolved  oxygen  is present  in  the  aqueous  medium  during  the  hydrogen  absorbing treatment.     Oxygen  gas  is  injected  into  the  medium  after  the absorption  of  the  hydrogen  on  the  catalyst  and  the  gaseous  zone and  liquid  zones  are  stirred.     This  patent  has  the  shortcoming  of requiring  an  injection  of  an  inert  gas  into  the  reactor  during the  hydrogen  absorption  phase  to  prevent  an  explosion  between  the hydrogen  and  oxygen  gases.<br>
U.S.   Patent  No.   5,194,242   ('242  patent)   describes  a process  for  preparing  hydrogen  peroxide  in  which  an  acidic aqueous  solution  fills  an  elongated  reaction  zone  in  a  tubular reactor.     A  catalyst  is  provided  to  the  reaction  zone.     Oxygen together  with  recycled  gas  and  then  hydrogen  are  dispersed  into the  solution  in  proportions  that  are  above  the  lower  flammability<br><br>
limit  for  hydrogen  and  oxygen  and  are  maintained  at  a  temperature and  pressure  until  the  reaction  mixture  has  decreased  to  below the  lower  flammability  limit  for  the  hydrogen  and  oxygen  mixture. The  partial  pressure  of  hydrogen  and  oxygen  is  super-atmospheric in  the  range  of  about  20  to  about  400  psi.     The  aqueous  solution flows  through  the  reactor  at   liquid  velocity  at  rate   from  about  4 to  about  8  ft/sec.<br>
In  the   '242  patent,   the  ratio  of  the  flow  of  the aqueous  medium  to  the  aggregate  flow  of  the  hydrogen  and  oxygen is  such  that  a  gas  phase  regime  of  large  elongated  bubbles  may  be produced,   which,   if  reacted  violently  would  not  be  surrounded  by sufficient  liquid  volume  to  cool  the  gas  mixture,   resulting  in elevated  temperature  and  pressure  which  can  result  in  an explosion  of  the  gas  mixture.     Patentees  provide  no  teaching  of the  importance  of  operating  in  a  regime  in  which  snail  discrete individual  bubbles  exist  which  can  be  quenched  by  the  surrounding medium.     It  is  desirable  to  provide  a  safe  direct  combination process  for  producing  hydrogen  peroxide  which  has  low manufacturing  costs-<br>
OBJECTS  OF  THE  INVENTION<br>
It  is  thus  a  primary  object  of  the  invention  to  provide a  process  for  the  reaction  of  oxygen  and  hydrogen  which  is efficient  and  safe.<br>
It  is  a  further  related  object  of  the  invention  to provide  a  process  which  operates  in  the  flammable  range  of<br><br>
oxygen/hydrogen  mixtures  so  as  to  benefit  from  increased  reaction rate,   without  sacrificing  the  safety  aspects  of  the  process.<br>
It  is  still  a  further  related  object  of  the  invention to  substantially  completely  react  hydrogen  during  the  process  in order  to  maximize  the  efficiency  of  utilization  of  that  expensive reactant.<br>
It  is  still  a  further  related  object  of  the  invention to  minimize  or  avoid  entirely  the  necessity  of  recycling  spent gases  from  the  reaction  to  the  reaction  zone.<br>
It  is  still  a  further  object  of  the  invention  to  carry out  the  process  with  minute  bubbles  of  hydrogen  and  oxygen supplied  to  the  reaction  zone  at  a  rate  and  in  such  a  way  as  to obviate  the  risk  of  explosion.<br>
SUMMARY  OF  THE   INVENTION Briefly  described,   the  invention  comprises  a  method  and apparatus  for  producing  hydrogen  peroxide  in  which  hydrogen  and oxygen  are  separately  injected  into  a   liquid  filled  reactor  to form  a  plurality  of  discrete  individual  bubbles  in  a  continuous rapidly  flowing  liquid  stream.     Each  bubble  is  surrounded  by  a continuous  liquid  phase  such  that  if  the  hydrogen  and  oxygen  gas reacted,   there  is  sufficient  liquid  available  to  quench/cool  down the  reaction  in  order  to  prevent  an  explosion  propagating throughout  the  reactor.     It  has  been  found  that  it  is  critical  to maintain  the  ratio  of  the  volume  of  flow  of  aqueous  medium  to  the aggregate  volume  of  flow  of  hydrogen  and  oxygen,   at  a  high  value<br><br>
'    so  as  to  avoid  uncontrolled  reaction  of  hydrogen  and  oxygen<br>
bubbles  to  form  water.     By  controlling  the  ratio  of  the  volume  of flow  of  aqueous  medium  to  the  volume  of  flow  of  hydrogen  and oxygen,   both  independently,   and,   in  the  aggregate,   there  is sufficient  liquid  volume  present  to  quench  any  runaway  reaction that  might  take  place.     It  is  also  important  to  maintain  the  flow velocity  of  aqueous  medium  at  at  least  ten  feet  per  second  to obtain  a  dispersed  bubbly  flow  regime.     The  prevention  of  a reaction  from  expanding  allows  the  concentration  of  unreacted hydrogen  and  oxygen  within  the  reactor  to  be  within  the  explosive range.<br>
Preferably,   a  pipeline  reactor  is  used  having  a plurality  of  passes  within  the  reactor.     The  pipeline  reactor  can be  formed  of  a  plurality  of  tubes  arranged  vertically  or horizontally  and  connected  with  curved   (elbow)   tubes.     The   liquid stream  can  be  formed  of  water,   a  dilute  acid  and  a  Group  VIII metal  catalyst.     The  Group  VIII  metal  catalyst  can  be  platinum  or palladium  or  a  mixture  of  the  two  on  an  inert  support  such  as alumina,   silica  or  carbon.     The  liquid  stream  fills  the  reactor. Fine  dispersed  hydrogen  gas  bubbles  can  be  dissolved  into  the flowing  liquid  stream.    After  the  hydrogen  is  dissolved,   finely dispersed  oxygen  gas  bubbles  are  injected  into  the  liquid  stream for  reacting  with  hydrogen  to  form  hydrogen  peroxide.    After  this first  reaction  is  complete,   multiple  injections  of  first  hydrogen and  then  oxygen  can  be  used  to  raise  the  concentration  of hydrogen  peroxide  produced  to  a  predetermined  level.     The  number<br><br>
of injections of hydrogen and oxygen bubbles can be varied for producing the desired concentration of the hydrogen peroxide.<br>
The present invention has the advantage of avoiding a continuous gas phase between the hydrogen and oxygen and having full utilization of the entire volume of the reactor. The production of hydrogen peroxide occurs in the liquid phase between the dissolved hydrogen gas and oxygen in the presence of a catalyst. The method prevents an explosive reaction from expanding, thereby allowing the concentration of unreacted hydrogen and oxygen to be within the explosive range.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for preparing hydrogen peroxide by reaction of hydrogen and oxygen in the presence of a catalyst, comprising the steps of: (a) establishing a continuous flow of aqueous reaction medium containing finely divided catalyst for the said reaction in an elongated reaction zone; (b) sparging from one to twenty moles of oxygen and one mole of hydrogen into said continuously flowing aqueous medium, said hydrogen and oxygen being sparged at points distanced from one another along the path of said continuous flow and thereby forming dispersed tiny bubbles of hydrogen and oxygen, respectively, in said aqueous medium; (c) maintaining (i) the ratio of the flow of said aqueous medium to the aggregate flow of said gaseous hydrogen and oxygen, at from 300 to 30; (ii) the linear flow rate of aqueous medium at least 10 feet per second; and (iii) the temperature and pressure conditions of the flow medium so as to cause the bubbles of hydrogen and oxygen to react catalytically to form hydrogen peroxide; (d) introducing the said reaction medium into a gas-liquid separator and therein separating unreacted gases from the aqueous reaction medium containing hydrogen peroxide; and (e) recovering hydrogen peroxide from said aqueous medium.<br><br>
The invention will be more fully described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which<br>
Fig. I is a schematic diagram of an apparatus for continuously producing hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen and oxygen according to an environment of the invention.<br>
Fig.2 is a schematic diagram of an apparatus for producing hydrogen peroxide in a semicontinuous batch process according to another embodiment of the invention.<br>
Fig.l illustrates a schematic view of the apparatus 10 for producing hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen and oxygen. Water 12 and catalyst 14 are added to tank 16. Catalyst 14 is preferably a supported Group VIII metal catalyst. Preferably, catalyst 14 is palldium or platinum or mixtures thereof<br><br>
Examples of a support useful for supporting the catalyst in a dispersed fashion are carbon, silica and alumina. It will be appreciated that other catalysts known in the art of hydrogen peroxide  production  can  be  used  in  the  present  invention.<br>
Preferably,   an  amount  of  hydrogen  peroxide  stabilizer 15   is  added  to  tank  16.     Stabilizer  15  can  be  an  acidic  solution having  a  Ph  in  the  range  of  about  2  to  7.     Examples  of  acids useful  for  the  present  invention  are  hydrochloric,   phosphoric, and  other  commercially  available  inorganic  acids.     Typically,   the amount  of  stabilizer  15  added  to  water  is  less  than  about  1%  of the  reaction  medium.     Solution  17  within  tank  16  can  be  stirred with  an  automatic  or  manual  agitation  means  18.  <br>
Solution  stream  20  is  circulated  with  recirculating pump  22  as  input  stream  24.     Liquid  stream  24   is  received  at pipeline  reactor  26  and  fills  pipes  27  of  pipeline  reactor  26. Liquid  stream  24  has  a  flow  velocity  of  greater  than  10  feet  per second  for  avoiding  the  presence  of  a  continuous  gas  phase  or elongated  bubbles  within  reactor  26.     It  is  known  that  dispersed bubble  regime  occurs  when  water  has  a  velocity  of  greater  that  10 feet  per  second.     "The  Flow  of  Complex  Mixtures  of  Pipes."  G.W. Govier,   Robert  Kreiger  Publishing  Conpany,   Malaber,   Florida,   page 523.     Preferably,   the  flow  velocity  of  liquid  stream  24   is  in  the range  of  more  than  10  feet  per  second  to  about  50  feet  per second.     Most  preferably,   the  flow  velocity  of  liquid  stream  24 is  in  the  range  of  about  11  to  about  20  feet  per  second.<br><br>
Pipeline  reactor  26  is  preferably  formed  of  a  plurality of  pipes  27  joined  with  a  180°  bend.     Joined  pipes  27  can  be arranged  either  vertically  or  horizontally.     The  length  and diameter  27  of  pipes  are  predetermined  for  providing  the  desired flow  velocity.     Preferably,   pipes  27  are  formed  of  a  commercially available  heavy  wall  pipe  such  as  a  U.S.   schedule  160  which  has  a wall  thickness  form  0,44  to  1.3l  inches  over  the  size  range  of  3 to  12  inches.     Pipes  27  useful  for  practice  of  the  .present invention  can  have  diameter  in  the  range  of  2   inches  to  at  least 12  inches.     The  preferred  length  of  pipeline  reactor  26  can  vary widely  depending  on  the  number  of  joined  pipes  27  used  in  the reactor.     Typically,   joined  pipes  27  have  a  total  length  in  the range  of  about  50  to  about  60,000  feet.     Preferably,   joined  pipes 27  have  a  length  of  about  2,000  to  about  45,000  feet.'<br>
It  will  be  appreciated  that  the  number  of  pipes  27  used in  pipeline  reactor  26  can  be  varied  to  change  the  number  of injection  points  or  passes  in  the  pipeline  reactor  26^ Preferably,   the  number  of  passes  of  pipeline  reactor  26   is between  about  six  and  about  48  passes.<br>
The  pipeline  reactor  26  operates  at  a  pressure  in  the range  of  about  between  30  to  about  300  atm.     The  reaction temperature  normally  is  in  the  range  of  0»C  to  eo'C.     The  lower the  temperature  of  the  aqueous  medium  the  higher  the  solubility of  hydrogen  is  in  solution.     Similarly,   the  higher  the  pressure, the  greater  the  solubility  of  hydrogen  is  in  solution.     The reaction  temperature  can  be  maintained  by  providing  jacketing  on<br><br>
each  pipe  27  or  by  installing  the  entire  pipeline  reactor  26 within  a  vessel  in  which  a  refrigerant  is  being  evaporated  or cold  liquid  solution  is  circulated.<br>
It  has  now  been  found  that  it  is  important  to  maintain the  ratio  of  the  volumetric  flows  of  the  aqueous  reaction  medium and  the  aggregate  flows  of  the  gaseous  hydrogen  and  oxygen  at  of broadly  from  300  to  30,   preferably  from  200  to  40  and  most desirably  from  150  to  50.     If  the  flow  ratios  are  maintained within  these  ranges  and  the  velocity  of  the  flowing  liquid  is maintained  at  above  10  feet  per  second,   as  described  above,   a regime  of  tiny  bubbles  surrounded  by  adequate  aqueous  medium  is created  and  the  risk  of  runaway  explosion.by  reaction  of  bubbles is  substantially  obviated.     Statistically,   the  local  increase  of the  temperature  due  to  the  reaction  of  hydrogen  and  oxygen bubbles  to  form  water  is  desirably  less  than  3'C.     This  is achieved  with  the  volumetric  flow  rates  and  velocities  of  the invention.<br>
Broadly,  the  volumetric  ratio  of  oxygen  to  hydrogen  may be  in  the  range  of  1:1  to  50:1.     The  art  has  recognized  that higher  ratios  of  oxygen  to  hydrogen  may  be  desirable  to  force  the reaction  to  completion.     It  is  recognized  that  oxygen  is  by  far the  cheaper  of  the  reactants  and  accordingly,   excess  oxygen  can be  vented  from  the  system  without  excessive  economic  penalty. Desirably,   the  reaction  takes  place  in  the  flammable  range,   the volume  ratio  of  oxygen  to  hydrogen  being  from  1:1  to  20:1.<br><br>
The  foregoing  ratios  of  the  flows  of  aqueous  medium  to the  aggregate  volumetric  flows  of  hydrogen  and  oxygen,   in  turn set  the  ratios  of  the  volume  of  aqueous  medium  to  each  of  the volumes  of  hydrogen  and  oxygen,   respectively,   at  the  several hydrogen  and  oxygen  gas  inlets.     Broadly,   the  ratio  of  the volumetric  flow  of  aqueous  medium  to  the  volumetric  flow  of hydrogen  at  each  hydrogen  gas  inlet,   is  broadly  from  15,000  to 60.     The  ratio  of  the  volumetric  flow  of  aqueous  medium  to  the volumetric  flow  of  oxygen  is  from  about  15,000  to  60.-<br>
A  gaseous  stream  of  hydrogen  28   is  injected  by  valve  30, into  a  flowing  liquid  stream  24  at  point  31.     Liquid  stream  24 flows  between  points  31  and  33   of  pipe  27.     Hydrogen  is  dissolved in  a  liquid  stream  24.     A  gaseous  stream  of  oxygen  34  is  injected by  valve  32   into  liquid  stream  24  at  point  33.     Within  pipeline reactor  26,   the  dissolved  hydrogen  2 8  reacts  with  the  gaseous oxygen  34  to  form  hydrogen  peroxide  in  solution.<br>
Preferably,   gaseous  hydrogen  28  and  gaseous  oxygen  34 are  sparged  into  liquid  stream  24  by  a  small  diameter  nozzle  for producing  a  plurality  of  minute  bubbles.     Preferably,   the  nozzle has  a  diameter  in  the  range  of  about  0.001  inches  to  about  0.25 inches  to  produce  fine  minute  bubbles  which  are  surrounded  by rapidly  flowing  liquid  stream  24.     The  minute  bubbles  of  hydrogen and  oxygen  are  of  a  size  which  is  small  enough  to  be  surrounded by  flowing  liquid  stream  24.     The  volume  of  liquid  stream  is sufficiently  large  and  continuous  so  that  in  the  event  of  any explosion  of  a  single  bubble  the  surrounding  liquid  can<br><br>
expeditiously  quench  the  explosion  within  the  bubble  to  prevent the  propagation  of  the  explosion  throughout  the  entire  regime  of the  reactor.     The  flow  rate  of  liquid  stream  24  and  the  injection of  minute  bubbles  provide  a  dispersed  bubbly  regime  in  liquid stream  24.<br>
Additional  gaseous  hydrogen  23  can  be  injected  at  a plurality  of  passes  through  pipeline  reactor  26  with  respective valves   35,   46,   50,   55  and  59   at  points   36,   47,   51,   56  and  60  for dissolution  into   liquid  stream  24.     Additional  gaseous  oxygen  34 can  be  injected  downstream  of  hydrogen  injection  points  36,   47, 51,   56  and  60  with  respective  valves  40,   48,   53,   57  and  61  at respective  points  41,   49,   54,   58  and  62  for  reacting  with  the dissolved  hydrogen.<br>
Desirably,   the  point  of  oxygen  introduction  is sufficiently  distanced  from  that  of  hydrogen  injection  to  permit the  hydrogen  to  have  become  distributed  throughout  the  aqueous medium  as  tiny  dispersed  bubbles  and  to  dissolve  in  the  aqueous medium.     Desirably,   the  second  volume  of  hydrogen  and  subsequent volumes  of  hydrogen  introduced  along  the  elongated  reaction  zone are  introduced  after  about  50%  of  the  previously  introduced hydrogen  has  been  reacted  with  oxygen  and  preferably  after  at least  75%  of  the  previously  introduced  hydrogen  has  been  reacted-<br>
After  the  multi-pass  reaction,   stream  64  flows  from pipeline  reactor  26.     In  the  event  the  off-gas  from  the  reactor is  in  the  flammable  range,   a  diluent  gas  66  can  be  added  to<br><br>
.   stream  64.     An  example  of  a  diluent  gas  useful  for  practice  of the  invention  is  nitrogen.<br>
A  pressure  letdown  valve  68   can  be  used  before  gas-liquid  separator  70  for  reducing  the  pressure  of  the  inlet mixture  69  to  gas-liquid  separator  70.     Gas   liquid  separator  70 separates   liquid  72  from  gas  74.     Gas   74   containing  unreacted oxygen,   nitrogen  and  some  unreacted  hydrogen  from  separator  70 can  be  recycled  with  recycled  gas  compressor  78  and  can  be injected  at  point  75  into  liquid  stream  24,     Alternatively, separated  gas  74  can  be  purged  with  valve  76.     It  will  be appreciated  that  a  gas  liquid  separator  useful  for  practice  of the  present  invention  is  known  in  the  art.     Stream  64  can  be received  at  additional  pipeline  reactors  26  for  connecting  the reactors  in  series  before  gas  liquid  separator  70.<br>
Separated  liquid  72  containing  the  hydrogen  peroxide product  in  the  aqueous  solution  of  catalyst  and  acid  is  passed  to filter  80  for  recovering  the  catalyst  as  a  filter  cake  82-Filter  cake  82  can  be  added  to  tank  16  for  recycling  the catalyst.     Filtrate  84  includes  the  hydrogen  peroxide  product  and the  aqueous  acid  water  solution.     Filtrate  84   is  received  at  ion exchange  apparatus  86  for  removing  the  acid  from  the  filtrate. .<br>
Hydrogen  peroxide  product  88  from  ion  exchange apparatus  8 6  can  be  directly  used  as  a  hydrogen  peroxide  product. Alternatively,   hydrogen  peroxide  product  88  can  be  received  at column  90  for  concentrating  the  hydrogen  peroxide  product  88  in order  to  produce  a  concentrated  hydrogen  peroxide  product  94.<br><br>
Column  90  can  be  an  evaporation  or  distillation  column.     Water  92 removed  from  column  90  can  be  recycled  into  water  stream  12  as make-up  water.<br>
The  concentration  of  hydrogen  peroxide  product  82 produced  by  pipeline  reactor  2 6  depends  on  the  number  of injections  of  hydrogen  and  oxygen  in  the  passes  of  pipeline reactor  26.     Preferably,   hydrogen  peroxide  product  82  has  a concentration  in  the  range  of  about  2%  to  about  30%  of  hydrogen peroxide  in  solution.     Preferably,   hydrogen  peroxide  product  94 has  up  to  70%  concentration.<br>
The  present  invention  has  the  advantage  of  providing  an economical  and  safe  process  for  producing  hydrogen  peroxide.     The process  does  not  specifically  inject  an  inert  gas  or  chemical agent  within  the  reactor,   thereby  reducing  costs.     The  entire regime  of  the  pipeline  reactor  comprises  a  dispersed  bubbly regime  in  a  rapidly  flowing  liquid  stream  for  preventing  the formation  of  an  explosive  gas  phase  with  the  reactor.     The  entire pipeline  is  utilized  for  the  production  of  the  hydrogen  peroxide. In  addition,   the  high  surface  to  volume  relationship  of  the reactor  provides  inexpensive  removal  of  heat  from  the  reactor.<br>
EXAMPLE   I Continuous  Process A  circulating  aqueous  stream  of  a  suspended  group  VIII metal  catalyst  deposited  on  an  inert  carrier  with  an  acid stabilizer  is  delivered  at  a  pressure  of  200  atmospheres<br><br>
(3000  psi)   to  the  first  of  two  tubular  reactors  operated  in series  at  a  flow  rate  of  195,000  pounds  per  hour  per  reactor  in the  reactor  shown  in  Fig.   1.     The  reactor  consists  of  4"  schedule 160  pipes  100  feet  long,   each  connected  together  by  180""  U  bends. The  liquid  flow  rate  has  a  liquid  velocity  of  13  feet/second. The  liquid  stream  is  introduced  into  the  reactor  at  15°C.<br>
J\.t  the  reactor  inlet  27.2  pounds  per  hour  of  hydrogen gas  is  injected  through  a  nozzle  to  form  fine  individual  bubbles in  the  liquid  stream  flowing  at  13  feet/second.     This  produces  a bubbly  flow  regime  with  a  continuous  liquid  phase  and  small evenly  dispersed  individual  bubbles.     Recycled  gas  from  the  gas-liquid  separator  can  be  injected  into  the  process  fluid.     This  is followed  by  the  injection  of  43 2  Ibs/hr.   of  oxygen  as  finely dispersed  bubbles  which  reacts  with  the  hydrogen  to  form  hydrogen peroxide.     This  is  followed  by  repeated  injections  for  each reactor  of  first  hydrogen  and  the  oxygen  to  form  hydrogen peroxide  of  increasing  concentration.     The  heat  of  reaction  is removed  by  the  circulation  of  cooled  water   (or  refrigerant) outside  the  reactor  pipes.<br>
After  passing  through  the  second  reactor,   the  effluent flows  through  a  pressure  letdown  valve  before  a  gas-liquid separator.     Nitrogen  or  other  diluent  gas  is  added  to  the  reactor effluent  as  needed  to  assure  the  exit  gas  from  the  separator  is outside  the  explosive/flammable  limits  of  hydrogen  and  oxygen. This  gas  can  be  either  recycled  to  the  first  reactor  or  vented  to atmosphere.<br><br>
The  liquid  phase  is  filtered  to  remove  the  suspended catalyst  slurry  so  that  it  can  be  resuspended  in  the  aqueous medium.     This  is. done  in  a  mix  tank  where  the  concentration  of each  ingredient  is  checked  and  adjusted  as  needed.     This  includes the  acid  used  as  a  stabilizer  for  hydrogen  peroxide.     The filtrate  from  the  filter  that  contains  the  desired  hydrogen peroxide  product  passes  over  an  ion  exchange  or  equal  agent  to remove  residual  acid  values  fron  the  hydrogen  peroxide  product. This  product  can  then  be  used  directly  or  can  be  concentrated  in an  evaporator  or  distillation  column  to  concentrated  in  an evaporator  or  distillation  column  to  concentrations  up  to  70% following  conventional  practice.    A  total  production  of 100,000,000  pounds  per  year  of  hydrogen  peroxide  can  be  produced from  these  two  reactors.<br>
EXAMPLE   II Batch  Semicontinuous  Process Fig.   2  illustrates  an  alternate  method  of  operating  the process  of  the  invention  in  a  batch,   semicontinuous  fashion.     A fresh  batch  of  reaction  medium  consisting  of  a  group  VIII  metal catalyst  on  an  inert  support  in  an  acidic  aqueous  solution,   is charged  through  valve  1  to  separator  2.     The  solution  is  charged to  the  reactor  via  valve  3  and  recirculating  pump  4.     Once  the system  is  filled,   flow  of  fresh  solution  is  stopped  by  closing valve  1.     The  pressure  in  the  system  is  increased  by  closing valve  5.<br><br>
The  velocity  of  the  medium  is  maintained  at  10  feet  per second  or  more.     Hydrogen  is  injected  at  injection  system  6.     The amount  of  hydrogen  introduced  is  at  or  less  than  the  solubility limit  in  the  flowing  medium.     Oxygen  is  introduced  at  point  8,   at a  sufficient  distance  downstream   (pipe  length  7)   to  ensure  the absorption  of  hydrogen.     At  full  capacity,   hydrogen  flow  is  about 15  pounds  per  hour  and  oxygen  flow  is  approximately  2 50  pounds per  hour.     Sufficient  pipe  length  9  is  provided  downstream  of  the oxygen  injection  to  permit  the  maximum  conversion  to  hydrogen peroxide.     The  pipeline  is  cooled  by  a  coolant  on  the  outside  of the  pipe  to  maintain  an  operating  temperature  between  5  and  SO'C.<br>
The  reactor  effluent  passes  to  separator  2  to  disengage the  gas  10  from  the  liquid.     The  exit  gas  is  outside  the flammable  range  so  it  can  be  recycled  back  to  the  reactor  by recycle  compressor  11.     As  needed,   fresh  oxygen  12   is  added  to the  recycle  stream  before  it  is  injected  at  point  8.     If  the  exit gas  is  in  flammable  region,   nitrogen  13  is  injected  into  the effluent  stream.     Effluent  gas  14   is  then  vented  from  the  system.<br>
Pump  4  recirculates  the  liquid  medium  until  the hydrogen  peroxide  reaches  its  desired  concentration,   desirably between  4-15%  by  weight,   preferably  5-8%.     Gas  injection  will continue  for  from  one  to  three  hours.     The  reactor  system, including  the  separator,   pump  and  piping  is  then  drained.     The system  is  then  refilled  with  a  fresh  reactor  charge  following  the procedure  outlined  above.     This  batch  semicontinuous  procedure produces  from  1,000,000-1,500,000  pounds  per  year  of  hydrogen<br><br>
peroxide  product.     With  smaller  or  larger  diameter  pipe  of  the sa'me  length,   lower  or  higher  quantities,   respectively,   of hydrogen  peroxide  are  produced.<br>
EXAMPLE  III Modified  Batch  Semicontinuous  Process<br>
The  batch  semicontinuous  process  described  in  Example II  can  be  carried  out  in  a  modified  way  to  reduce  both  the capital  costs  and  operating  costs  of  the  reaction  system.     The basic  flow  diagram  of  Fig.   2   is  used  with  the  exception  that  a second  reaction  medium  charge  pump  is  provided  in  parallel  with recirculating  pump  4   in  order  to  fill  the  system  and.  the  pressure let  down  valve  5,   rather  than  being  at  the  effluent  of  the reactor  pipeline  upstream  of  the  separator,   is  downstream  of  the separator  in  the  gas  effluent  line.<br>
In  operation,  the  operating  pressure  in  the  separator remains  high   (1,000-4,000  psi)   throughout  the  course  of  the reaction.     Pressure  is  maintained  by  "head"  gas  above  the separator  liquid.     The  gas  to  be  recycled  enters  recycle compressor  upstream  of  the  pressure  letdown  valve.     The  exit  gas in  line  10  passes  through  a  pressure  letdown  valve.     By configuring  the  process  in  this  way,   any  residual  dissolved  gas in  the  reactor  effluent  stays  in  solution  while  passing  through the  separator  because  the  latter  remains  at  pressure.     Thus,   it is  not  necessary  to  rediscover  gases  in  the  recirculating  reactor effluent  and  both  the  separated  liquid  and  unreacted  gas  need  not be  repressurized  as  in  Example  II.     Configuring  the  process<br><br>
thusly  should  reduce  the  capital  and  operating  costs  of  the recirculation  pump,   the  recycle  compressor,   the  separator  and other  parts  of  the  process.<br>
While  the  invention  has  been  described  with  reference to  the  preferred  embodiment,   this  description  is  not  intended  to be  limiting.     It  will  be  appreciated  by  those  of  ordinary  skill in  the  art  that  modifications  may  be  made  without  departing  from the  spirit  and  scope  of  the  invention.<br><br><br>
