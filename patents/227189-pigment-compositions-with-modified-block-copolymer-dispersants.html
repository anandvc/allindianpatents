The present invention relates to a composition containing modified block copolymer dispersants and dispersible inorganic or organic pigment particles, a process for preparing the composition, a pigment dispersion containing modified block copolymer dispersants and dispersible inorganic or organic pigment particles, a process for preparing the pigment dispersion and to the use of the pigment dispersion for preparing coatings, images, lacquers and others.<br>
Dispersions containing pigments and polymer additives are used in an almost unlimited number of different technical applications, e.g. as coating materials, for printing inks, colouring plastic materials, including fibres, glasses, or ceramic products, for formulations in cosmetics, or for the preparation of paint systems, in particular automotive, industrial and decorative paints.<br>
The function of polymers in pigment dispersions is manifold. They may act as solubilisers in the given carrier liquid, e.g. water or organic solvents. Suitable polymers are also needed as stabilisers to prevent precipitation or flocculation. Polymers may also improve the gloss of the pigment dispersion or enhance its rheology. Depending on the type and polarity of the dispersing agent, e.g. water, organic solvents or mixtures thereof, polymers of variable structure are chosen. In view of ecological requirements, the use of aqueous pigment dispersions is particularly preferred, as well as dispersions based on organic solvents with high solids content. In aqueous systems, mixtures of hydrophobic and hydrophilic polymers or block copolymers, so-called A-B block copolymers, containing hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer blocks are present. The hydrophobic "A" blocks (homo- or copolymers of methacrylate monomers) associate with either pigment or emulsion polymer surfaces or both. With hydrophilic "B" blocks (neutralised acid or amine containing polymers), these copolymers are useful for preparing water based pigment dispersions, cf H. J. Spinelli, Progress in Organic Coatings 27(1996), 255-260.<br>
Many different well-established methods are available for preparing the polymers used in pigment dispersions. Most methods have the disadvantage that uncontrollable recombination reactions of initiator radicals may occur immediately after their formation with the effect that variable ratios between initiator radicals and stable free radicals are produced. Consequently, in some cases there is an inefficient control of the polymerisation process.<br>
Group transfer polymerisation (GTP) is a well-established method for producing A-B block copolymers of defined structure from methacrylate monomers. Despite its wide applicability _<br><br>
and usefulness the GTP method still has several drawbacks. The polymerisation initiators used in this method, such as the silyl ketene acetals disclosed in U.S. Patent Specification 4,656,226, e.g. 1-trimethylsilyloxy-1-isobutoxy-2-methylpropene, are highly reactive and diffi¬cult to prepare in a multi-step synthesis. This necessitates the use of carefully dried and pu¬rified reactants, which limits this method in industrial applications operating on a large scale.<br>
WO 96/30421 discloses a controlled or "living" polymerisation process of ethylenically un¬saturated polymers, such as styrene or (meth)acrylates, by employing the Atomic Transfer Radical Polymerisation (ATRP) method. This method produces defined oligomeric homo-polymers and copolymers, including block copolymers. Initiators are employed, which gene¬rate radical atoms, such as •CI, in the presence of a redox system of transition metals of different oxidation states, e.g. Cu(l) and Cu(ll), providing "living" or controlled radical po¬lymerisation.<br>
A general drawback of this prior art method is seen in the fact that the polymer chains pre¬pared by ATRP contain halogen as terminal fragment, which has been transferred from the polymerisation initiator. The content of halogen is generally undesirable in polymers. Halo¬gen, especially chlorine and bromine, is subject to the removal as hydrogen halide depend¬ing on temperature, especially above 150°C. The double bond thus formed is subject to a reaction with atmospheric oxygen, which decreases the antioxidative resistance of the poly¬mer. Moreover, hydrogen halide liberated from the polymer reacts with other functional groups present in the polymer, such as ester groups present in acrylates. Depending on the type of the polymer, chlorine is also removed in the form of a radical, which might initiate un¬desirable chain reactions in the polymer structure. The removal of halogen from the polymer structure, especially from the terminal position of the polymer chain, and its replacement with suitable substituents in a subsequent process step is described in WO 00/18807.<br>
U.S. Patent Specification 4,581,429 discloses a free radical polymerisation process by the controlled or "living" growth of polymer chains. A specific process embodiment is the use of initiators of the partial formula R'R"N-0-X. In the polymerisation process the free radical species R'R"N-0* and *X are generated. «X is a free radical group, e.g. a tert-butyl or<br>
cyanoisopropyl radical, capable of polymerising monomer units containing ethylene groups. The monomer units A are substituted by the initiator fragments R'R"N-0» and «X and polym¬erise to structures of the type: R'R"N-0-A-X (A: polymer block). Specific R'R"N-0-X initiators mentioned are derived from cyclic structures, such as 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine, or open chain molecules, such as di-tert-butylamine.<br><br>
Recently some alternative polymerisation regulators have been published. WO 98/30601 discloses heterocyclic &gt;N-0-R compounds suitable for controlled polymerisation processes. WO 98/13392 discloses open chain alkoxyamines, which are derived from NO-gas or from nitroso compounds. The advantage of these prior art polymerisation methods over the ATRP-method is seen in the fact that no subsequent replacement of terminal groups of the polymer chains is needed.<br>
In view of the almost unlimited range of different technical applications, there remains a growing need for pigment dispersions of improved pigment affinity and rheology, as ex¬pressed by the viscosity of the mill base at a given shear rate and improved gloss of surface<br>
coatings.<br>
A prior art solution to this problem is disclosed in WO 00/40630, wherein pigment disper¬sions are disclosed containing block copolymers as dispersants, prepared by the ATRP-method. The block copolymers consist of defined hydrophobic and hydrophilic poly¬mer blocks. The difference in polarity is obtained by copoiymerising polymer blocks A and B wherein different amounts of monomer units with hydrophilic functional groups are present, such as amino or alkylated amino groups. This changes the hydrophilic/ hydrophobic char¬acter of the block copolymer dispersant. In one embodiment, the individual hydrophobic "A" blocks based on uncharged homo- or copolymers of methacrylate monomers form steric stabiliser blocks in solvent based coating formulations. The presence of more hydrophilic "B" blocks (e.g. amino functional acrylates or methacrylates) is the basis for pigment affinity to certain organic or inorganic pigments.<br>
it has surprisingly been found that the addition of salt forming components, such as mono-, bi- or tricyclic sulphonic, carboxytic and phosphonic acids, in the event that monomer units containing amino groups are present in the hydrophilic polymer blocks, produces pigment dispersions having improved properties for the above-mentioned technical applications.<br>

Solid/liquid dispersions that apply consist of a two-phase system containing insoluble solid particles or solid particles of low solubility within a liquid. The dis¬persing agent enables solid particles, in the instant case pigment particles, to be distributed homogeneously within a liquid phase, e.g. water or organic solvent, or mixtures of both, or a polymer melt. Homogeneous distribution means that the concentration of the solid particles within the liquid phase in any volume fraction of the liquid phase is identical or approximately identical (even distribution of the solid particles).<br>

Another embodiment of the invention relates to the process for preparing the above-men¬tioned pigment dispersion, which comprises preparing the block copolymer (I) by copolym-erising the fragments A and B by free radical polymerisation and<br>
cc) modifying the block copolymer with the salt forming component, isolating and adding the modified block copolymer to dispersible pigment particles and optionally binder materials, fillers or other conventional additives; or<br>
p) modifying the block copolymer with the salt forming component in the presence of dis¬persible pigment particles and optionally binder materials, fillers or other conventional ad¬ditives.<br>
The method of free radical polymerisation that applies is the so-called living polymerisation with the &gt;N-0-X' compounds (A) defined above (&gt;N-0-R method). In the alternative, one of<br>
X and Y represents the fragment of one of a free radical initiator and the other one repre¬sents the chain terminal group from the free nitroxyl radical (B). The method of polymerisa¬tion that applies is the so-called living polymerisation with &gt;N-0» compounds in the presence of the free radical initiators mentioned above.<br>
The polymerisation process may be carried out in bulk or in the presence of water or an or¬ganic solvent or mixtures thereof. Additional co solvents or surfactants, such as glycols or ammonium salts of fatty acids, may be added to the reaction mixture. The amount of solvent should be kept as low as possible. The reaction mixture may contain the above-mentioned monomers or oligomers in an amount of 1.0 to 99.9% by weight, preferably 5.0 to 99.9% by weight, and especially preferably 50.0 to 99.9% by weight, based on the monomers present in the polymerisate.<br>
If organic solvents are used, suitable solvents or mixtures of solvents are typically pure al-kanes (hexane, heptane, octane, isooctane), hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, xylene), halogenated hydrocarbons (chlorobenzene), alkanols (methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether), esters (ethyl acetate, propyl, butyl or hexyl acetate) and ethers (diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, or mix¬tures thereof.<br><br>
If water is used as a solvent the reaction mixture can be supplemented with a water-miscibie or hydrophilic co solvent. The reaction mixture will then remain in a homogeneous single phase throughout the monomer conversion. Any water-soluble or water-miscibie co solvent may be used, as long as the aqueous solvent medium is effective in providing a solvent system that prevents precipitation or phase separation of the reactants or polymer products until full completion of the polymerisation. Exemplary co solvents useful in the process may be selected from the group consisting of aliphatic alcohols, glycols, ethers, glycol ethers, pyr¬rolidines, N-alkyipyrrolidinones, N-alkylpyrrolidones, polyethylene glycols, polypropylene gly¬cols, amides, carboxylic acids and salts thereof, esters, organosulphides, sulphoxides, sul-phones, alcohol derivatives, hydroxyether derivatives such as butyl carbitol or cellosotve, amino aicohols, ketones, and the like, as well as derivatives and mixtures thereof. Specific examples include methanol, ethanol, propanol, dioxane, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, di-ethylene glycol, glycerol, dipropylene glycol, tetrahydrofuran, and other water-soluble or wa¬ter-miscibie materials, and mixtures thereof- When mixtures of water and water-soluble or water-miscibie organic solvents are selected for the process, the water to co solvent weight ratio is typically in the range of about 100 ; 0 to about 10 : 90.<br>
When monomer mixtures or monomer/oligomer mixtures are used, the calculation of mol% is based on an average molecular weight of the mixture.<br>
Hydrophilic monomers, polymers and copolymers of the present invention can be separated from one another or from the polymerisation reaction mixture by, for example, distillation, precipitation, extraction, changing the pH of the reaction media or by other well known con¬ventional separation techniques.<br>
The polymerisation temperature may range from about 50°C to about 180°C, preferably from about 80°C to about 150°C. At temperatures above about 180°C, the controlled conversion of the monomers into polymers may decrease, and undesirable by-products like thermally initiated polymers are formed or decomposition of the components may occur.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the process, the polymerisation is performed by employing the Atomic Transfer Radical Polymerisation (ATRP) method in the presence of a suitable catalyst capable of activating controlled radical polymerisation and the polymerisation initia¬tor X-Y, which contains a radically transferable atom or group »X. Initiators of that type are described in WO 96/30421 and WO 98/01480. A preferred radically transferable atom or group »X is "CI or »Br, which is cleaved as a radical from the initiator molecule and subse¬quently replaced after polymerisation as a leaving group with the &gt;N -&gt; O compound (V) de¬fined below.<br><br>
Specific initiators are selected from the group consisting of a,cc'-dichloro- or cc.a'-dibromoxy-lene, p-toluene sulphonyl chloride (PTS), hexakis-(a-chloro- or a-bromomethyl)-benzene, 2-chloro- or 2-bromopropionic acid, 2-chloro- or 2-bromoisobutyric acid, 1-phenethyl chloride or bromide, methyl or ethyl 2-chloro- or 2-bromopropionate, ethyl-2-bromo- or ethyl-2-chloro-isobutyrate, chloro- or bromoacetonitrile, 2-chloro- or 2-bromopropionitrile, a-bromo-benz-acetonitrile and a-bromo-^butyrolactone {= 2-bromo-dihydro-2(3H)-furanone).<br>
A suitable catalyst capable of activating controlled radical polymerisation is a transition metal complex catalyst salt is present as an oxidisable complex ion in the lower oxidation state of a redox system. Preferred examples of such redox systems are selected from the group con¬sisting of Group V(B), VI(B), VII(B), VIII, IB and IIB elements, such as CuVCu2*, Cu°/Cu\ Fe°/Fe2+, Fe27Fe3+, Cr^'Cr3*, Co7Co2+, Co'VCo3*, Ni7Ni+, Ni7Ni2+, Ni^/NI3*, Mn°/Mn2+, Mn27Mn3+, Mn^/Mn4* or ZnTZn2*.<br>
The ionic charges are counterbalanced by anionic ligands commonly known in complex chemistry of transition metals, such hydride ions (H") or anions derived from inorganic or or¬ganic acids, examples being halides, e.g. F, CI", Br" or I", halogen complexes with transition metals, such as Cu'Br2\ halogen complexes of the type BF4", PFe", SbFe" or AsF6". anions of oxygen acids, such as sulphate, phosphate, perchlorate, perbromate, periodate, antimonate, arsenate or nitrate, alcoholates or acetylides or anions of cyclopentadiene.<br>
Anionic ligands and neutral may also be present up to the preferred coordination number of the complex cation, especially four, five or six. Additional negative charges are counterbal¬anced by cations, especially monovalent cations such as Na+, K\ NfV or (d^alkyl^N*.<br>
Suitable neutral ligands are inorganic or organic neutral ligands commonly known in complex chemistry of transition metals. They coordinate to the metal ion through a a-, n-, u.-, retype bonding or any combinations thereof up to the preferred coordination number of the complex cation. Suitable inorganic ligands are selected from the group consisting of aquo (H20), amino, nitrogen, carbon monoxide and nitrosyl. Suitable organic ligands are selected from the group consisting of phosphines, e.g. (CeHgJaP, (i-C3H7)3P, (C5H9)3P or (C6Hi,)3P, di-, tri-, tetra- and hydroxyamines, such as ethylenediamine, ethylenediaminotetraacetate (EDTA), N,N-Dimethyl-N',N'-bis(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-ethylenediamine (Me6TREN), catechol, N,N'-<br>
dimethyl-1,2-benzenediamine, 2-{methylamino)phenol, 3-(methylamino)-2-butanol or N,N'-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine, N,N,N',N",N"-pentamethyldiethyltriamine<br>
(PMDETA), d-Ce-glycols or glycerides, e.g. ethylene or propylene glycol or derivatives thereof, e.g. di-, tri- or tetraglyme, and monodentate or bidentate heterocyclic e~ donor li¬gands.<br><br>
The oxidisable transition metal complex catalyst can be formed in a separate preliminary re¬action step from its ligands or is preferably formed in-situ from its transition metal salt, e.g. Cu(l)CI, which is then converted to the complex compound by addition of compounds corre¬sponding to the ligands present in the complex catalyst, e.g. by addition of ethylenediamine, EDTA, Me6TREN or PMDETA.<br>
The various advantages of a polymerisation process of this type allowing flexible polymerisa¬tion reactions are described by K. Matyjaszewski in ACS Symp. Ser. Vol. 685 (1998), pg. 2-30.<br>
After completing the polymerising step process, the polymers obtained may be isolated or the &gt;N -&gt; O compound of the formula:<br><br>
which corresponds to the group Ao and wherein Rt - R4 and Ra and Rb are as defined above, is added in-situ. The isolating step of the present process may be carried out by known pro¬cedures, e.g. by distilling and filtering off unreacted monomer. After completing the substi¬tution of the polymerisate with the &gt;N-»0 compound (V), the catalyst salt is filtered off, fol¬lowed by evaporation of the solvent or by precipitation of the &gt;N-»0 polymer (I) in a suitable liquid phase, filtering the precipitated polymer and washing and drying.<br>
The elimination of the leaving group -X, e.g. halogen, and the substitution of the polymeri¬sate with the &gt;N -»O compound (V) is advantageously performed in such a way that the polymerisate is dissolved in a solvent and the &gt;N-»0 compound (V) is added. The reaction takes place within a temperature range from room temperature to the boiling temperature of the reaction mixture, preferably from room temperature to 100°C. The transition metal in the oxidisable transition metal complex catalyst salt is converted from its lower oxidation state in the above-mentioned redox systems to its higher oxidation state. In a preferred embodiment of that process a Cu(l) complex catalyst salt is converted to the corresponding Cu(ll) oxida¬tion state.<br>
Because the present polymerisation is a "living" polymerisation, it can be started and termi¬nated practically at will. The block copolymers (I) as obtained by the process defined above have a low polydispersity. Preferably the polydispersity is from 1.01 to 2.2, more preferably from 1.01 to 1.9, and most preferably from 1.01 to 1.5.<br><br>
According to the process variant a) the block copolymer (I) is modified by addition of the salt forming component (ii) defined above, and isolating the modified block copolymer (I) in pure form or as a solution or dispersion in water or an organic solvent or a mixture of both. The modified block copolymer is then added in pure form or as a solution or dispersion to dis¬persible pigment particles and optionally binder materials, fillers or other conventional addi¬tives.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the process the polymers or copolymers can be further processed and used in most cases without any further purification step. This is an important advantage when industrial scale-up is intended. According to the process variant P) the block copolymer (I) is modified with the salt forming component (ii) in the presence of dis¬persible pigment particles and optionally binder materials, tillers or other conventional addi¬tives. A separate mixture of the salt forming component (ii), dispersible pigment particles and the optional components, such as binder materials, fillers or other conventional additives, e.g. solvent, is prepared to which the block copolymer (I) is added.<br>
The sequential order of performing the individual mixing steps comprising the block copoly¬mer (I), the salt forming component (ii) and the optional components of the composition is non-critical according to the process of above.<br>
The pigments are added to the polymer dispersant by using conventional techniques, such as high speed mixing, ball milling, sand grinding, attritor grinding or two or three roll milling. The resulting pigment dispersion may have a pigment to dispersant binder weight ratio of about 0.1 :100.0 to 1500.0 :100.0.<br>
The organic solvents present in the dispersion are mentioned above, cf. process, and pref¬erably are commonly used solvents in coatings technology. For water based coatings appli¬cations, aside from water, preferably polar, water-miscible solvents such as C^alkohols, e.g. methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol, glycol ethers like butyl glycol, or methoxypropylene glycol, polyols, e.g. glycerol, or ethylene, diethylene, triethylene, triethylene or propylene glycol are used. For solvent based coating systems, preferably less polar solvents like ali¬phatic hydrocarbons, esters like n-butyl acetate, or glycol ethers like methoxypropylene gly¬col or glycol ether esters like methoxypropylene glycol acetate are used.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the process variants a) or p), fine pigment dispersions are prepared by mixing the pigments with a solution of the polymers or an aqueous emulsion of the polymers, concentrating the resulting mixture by distilling off the solvents and/or water, preferably to dryness, and optionally further subjecting the resulting concentrate to thermal and/or mechanical treatment to prepare a mixture comprising pigments and polymers which<br><br>
may then be subsequently dispersed in aqueous and/or organic solvents. According to this process, the solid composition of pigment and modified block copolymer is easy to disperse and does not require time and energy intensive grinding to be incorporated into e.g. a paint formulation.<br>
The above-mentioned methods for preparing the composition, such as high speed mixing, ball milling, sand grinding, attritor grinding or two or three roll milling may in the alternative be employed when preparing the dispersion.<br>
The present invention also relates to the use of the pigment dispersion described above for preparing coating compositions, prints, images, inks, lacquers, pigmented plastics, adhe-sives, casting resins, filled composites, glass fibre reinforced composites, laminates, cement based construction materials like plaster and tile adhesives. Likewise of particular interest is a specific embodiment of the above-mentioned process for preparing the dispersion, wherein coating compositions, for example paints, are prepared. The invention therefore also relates to compositions, wherein film-forming binders c) for coatings are added to the composition comprising components a) and b) described above.<br>
The novel coating composition preferably comprises 0.01-100.0 parts by weight of the com¬bined components a) and b) in the composition, in particular 0.05 - 50.0 parts, especially 0.1 - 20.0 parts, per 100.0 parts by weight of solid binder c).<br>
The binder c) can in principle be any binders which are customary in industry, for example those described in UHmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Edition, Vol. A18, pp. 368-426, VCH, Weinheim 1991, Germany. In general, the film-forming binder is based on a thermoplastic or thermosetting resin, predominantly on a thermosetting resin. Examples thereof are alkyd, acrylic, polyester, phenolic, melamine, epoxy and polyurethane resins and mixtures thereof. Also resins curable by radiation or air-drying resins can be used.<br>
Component c) can be any cold-curable or hot-curable binder. The addition of a curing cata¬lyst may be advantageous. Suitable catalysts that accelerate the curing of the binder are de¬scribed, for example, in UHmann's, Vol. A18, p.469.<br>

Examples of possible components are those described in UHmann's, Vol. A18, pp. 429-471.<br>
Possible drying catalysts or curing catalysts are, for example, organometallic compounds, amines, amino-containing resins and/or phosphines. Examples of organometallic com¬pounds are metal carboxylates, especially those of the metals Pb, Mn, Co, Zn, Zr or Cu, or metal chelates, especially those of the metals Al, Ti or Zr, or organometallic compounds such as organotin compounds.<br>
Examples of metal carboxylates are the stearates of Pb, Mn or Zn, the octanoates of Co, Zn or Cu, the naphthenoates of Mn and Co or the corresponding linoleates, resinates or tallates.<br>
Examples of metal chelates are the aluminium, titanium or zirconium chelates of acetyl ace¬tone, ethyl acetyl acetate, salicylaldehyde, salicylaldoxime, o-hydroxyacetophenohe or ethyl trifluoroacetyl acetate, and the alkoxides of these metals.<br>
Examples of organotin compounds are dibutyltin oxide, dibutyltin dilaurate or dibutyltin dioc-toate.<br>
Examples of amines are, in particular, tertiary amines, for example tributylamine, triethano-lamine, N-methyldiethanolamine, N-dimethylethanolamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-methylmor-pholine or diazabicyclooctane (triethylenediamine) and salts thereof. Further examples are quaternary ammonium salts, for example trimethylbenzylammonium chloride.<br>
Amino-containing resins are simultaneously binder and curing catalyst. Examples thereof are amino-containing acrylate copolymers.<br>
The curing catalyst used can also be a phosphine, for example triphenylphosphine.<br>
The novel coating compositions can also be radiation-curable coating compositions. In this case, the binder essentially comprises monomeric or oligomeric compounds containing eth-ylenically unsaturated bonds, which after application are cured by actinic radiation, i.e. con¬verted into a crosslinked, high molecular weight form. Where the system is UV-curing, it generally contains a photo initiator as well. Corresponding systems are described in the above-mentioned publication UHmann's, Vol. A18, pages 451-453. In radiation-curable coat-<br><br>
ing compositions, the novel stabilisers can also be employed without the addition of sterically hindered amines.<br>
The coating compositions according to the invention can be applied to any desired sub¬strates, for example to metal, wood, plastic or ceramic materials. They are preferably used as topcoat in the finishing of automobiles. If the topcoat comprises two layers, of which the lower layer is pigmented and the upper layer is not pigmented, the novel coating composition can be used for either the upper or the lower layer or for both layers, but preferably for the upper layer.<br>
The novel coating compositions can be applied to the substrates by the customary methods, for example by brushing, spraying, pouring, dipping or electrophoresis; see also Ullmann's, Vol. A18, pp. 491-500.<br>
Depending on the binder system, the coatings can be cured at room temperature or by heating. The coatings are preferably cured at 50 - 150°C, and in the case of powder coatings or coil coatings even at higher temperatures.<br>
The coatings obtained in accordance with the invention have excellent resistance to the damaging effects of light, oxygen and heat; particular mention should be made of the good light stability and weathering resistance of the coatings thus obtained, for example paints.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to a coating, in particular a paint, which has been stabi¬lised against the damaging effects of light, oxygen and heat by a content of the compound of the formula (I) according to the invention. The paint is preferably a topcoat for automobiles. The invention furthermore relates to a process for stabilising a coating based on organic polymers against damage by light, oxygen and/or heat, which comprises mixing with the coating composition a mixture comprising a compound of the formula (I), and to the use of mixtures comprising a compound of the formula (I) in coating compositions as stabilisers against damage by light, oxygen and/or heat.<br>
The coating compositions can comprise an organic solvent or solvent mixture in which the binder is soluble. The coating composition can otherwise be an aqueous solution or disper¬sion. The vehicle can also be a mixture of organic solvent and water. The coating composi¬tion may be high-solids paint or can be solvent-free (e.g. a powder coating material). Powder coatings are, for example, those described in Ullmann's, A18, pages 438-444. The powder coating material may also have the form of a powder-slurry (dispersion of the powder pref¬erably in water).<br><br>
Likewise preferred is the use of the coating composition as a topcoat for applications in the automobile industry, especially as a pigmented or unpigmented topcoat of the paint finish. Its use for underlying coats, however, is also possible.<br>
The above-mentioned coating compositions or disperse systems may additionally contain fillers, such as calcium carbonate, silicates, glass fibres, glass beads, talc, kaolin, mica, barium sulphate, metal oxides and hydroxides, carbon black, graphite, wood powders, pow¬ders and fibres of other natural products, synthetic fibres, plasticisers, lubricants, emulsifiers, pigments, rheology additives, catalysts, flow auxiliaries, optical brighteners, flame retardants, antistatics, blowing agents.<br>

2. Preparation and testing of pigment dispersions containing modified block copolymers<br>
The performance of the different block copolymers modified with the acid addition salt components is evaluated in millbase preparations and corresponding coating formulations made therefrom.<br>
2.1 Preparation and testing of the millbase:<br>
A polyester millbase formulation is prepared according to the following prescription:<br><br>
Dependent on the active content of the different dispersants used and optional addi¬tions of acids, the formulation is slightly adjusted by solvents and DYNAPOL resin in order to adjust a pigment binder ratio of about 1. The components are ground with glass beads on a shaking machine (DIN 53238-13} for 4 hours. The viscosity of the millbase after grinding is measured at different shear rates with a cone-plate rheome-ter (Paar Physica UDS 200). Good dispersant efficiency can be seen by lowering of the millbase viscosity especially at mid to low shear rates, e.g. at a shear rate of 16. Two different processes for the preparation of the millbase are used:<br>
Process a)<br>
The modified block copolymer dispersant is prepared separately in form of a con¬centrate additive solution. This additive solution is added together with the other components of the millbase and then ground for 4 hours.<br>
Process P)<br>
The aminic block copolymer and the corresponding acids are added separately to the other components of the millbase and then ground for 4h. In this case, the modified block copolymer is formed "in situ" during the grinding of the millbase.<br><br>

The full shade formulation is drawn down on glass, dried at room temperature and then cured at 130°C for 30 min. Gloss measurements are made on the cured coatings. High gloss is indicative for a good dispersion of the pigment in the final coating.<br>
4.	Results<br>

Table 4 shows the results with modified block copolymers tested in an alkyd/melamine coating system with the pigment Irgazin® DPP Red BTR. In comparison with the references, the formulations containing the modified block copolymers exhibit lower viscosities of the millbase and improved gloss in the cured coating.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a composition containing modified block copolymer dispersants and dispersible inorganic or organic pigment particles, a process for preparing the composition, a pigment dispersion containing modified block copolymer dispersants and dispersible inorganic or organic pigment particles, a process for preparing the pigment dispersion and to the use of the pigment dispersion for preparing coatings, images, lacquers and others.<br>
Dispersions containing pigments and polymer additives are used in an almost unlimited number of different technical applications, e.g. as coating materials, for printing inks, colouring plastic materials, including fibres, glasses, or ceramic products, for formulations in cosmetics, or for the preparation of paint systems, in particular automotive, industrial and decorative paints.<br>
The function of polymers in pigment dispersions is manifold. They may act as solubilisers in the given carrier liquid, e.g. water or organic solvents. Suitable polymers are also needed as stabilisers to prevent precipitation or flocculation. Polymers may also improve the gloss of the pigment dispersion or enhance its rheology. Depending on the type and polarity of the dispersing agent, e.g. water, organic solvents or mixtures thereof, polymers of variable structure are chosen. In view of ecological requirements, the use of aqueous pigment dispersions is particularly preferred, as well as dispersions based on organic solvents with high solids content. In aqueous systems, mixtures of hydrophobic and hydrophilic polymers or block copolymers, so-called A-B block copolymers, containing hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer blocks are present. The hydrophobic "A" blocks (homo- or copolymers of methacrylate monomers) associate with either pigment or emulsion polymer surfaces or both. With hydrophilic "B" blocks (neutralised acid or amine containing polymers), these copolymers are useful for preparing water based pigment dispersions, cf H. J. Spinelli, Progress in Organic Coatings 27(1996), 255-260.<br>
Many different well-established methods are available for preparing the polymers used in pigment dispersions. Most methods have the disadvantage that uncontrollable recombination reactions of initiator radicals may occur immediately after their formation with the effect that variable ratios between initiator radicals and stable free radicals are produced. Consequently, in some cases there is an inefficient control of the polymerisation process.<br>
Group transfer polymerisation (GTP) is a well-established method for producing A-B block copolymers of defined structure from methacrylate monomers. Despite its wide applicability _<br><br>
and usefulness the GTP method still has several drawbacks. The polymerisation initiators used in this method, such as the silyl ketene acetals disclosed in U.S. Patent Specification 4,656,226, e.g. 1-trimethylsilyloxy-1-isobutoxy-2-methylpropene, are highly reactive and diffi¬cult to prepare in a multi-step synthesis. This necessitates the use of carefully dried and pu¬rified reactants, which limits this method in industrial applications operating on a large scale.<br>
WO 96/30421 discloses a controlled or "living" polymerisation process of ethylenically un¬saturated polymers, such as styrene or (meth)acrylates, by employing the Atomic Transfer Radical Polymerisation (ATRP) method. This method produces defined oligomeric homo-polymers and copolymers, including block copolymers. Initiators are employed, which gene¬rate radical atoms, such as •CI, in the presence of a redox system of transition metals of different oxidation states, e.g. Cu(l) and Cu(ll), providing "living" or controlled radical po¬lymerisation.<br>
A general drawback of this prior art method is seen in the fact that the polymer chains pre¬pared by ATRP contain halogen as terminal fragment, which has been transferred from the polymerisation initiator. The content of halogen is generally undesirable in polymers. Halo¬gen, especially chlorine and bromine, is subject to the removal as hydrogen halide depend¬ing on temperature, especially above 150°C. The double bond thus formed is subject to a reaction with atmospheric oxygen, which decreases the antioxidative resistance of the poly¬mer. Moreover, hydrogen halide liberated from the polymer reacts with other functional groups present in the polymer, such as ester groups present in acrylates. Depending on the type of the polymer, chlorine is also removed in the form of a radical, which might initiate un¬desirable chain reactions in the polymer structure. The removal of halogen from the polymer structure, especially from the terminal position of the polymer chain, and its replacement with suitable substituents in a subsequent process step is described in WO 00/18807.<br>
U.S. Patent Specification 4,581,429 discloses a free radical polymerisation process by the controlled or "living" growth of polymer chains. A specific process embodiment is the use of initiators of the partial formula R'R"N-0-X. In the polymerisation process the free radical species R'R"N-0* and *X are generated. «X is a free radical group, e.g. a tert-butyl or<br>
cyanoisopropyl radical, capable of polymerising monomer units containing ethylene groups. The monomer units A are substituted by the initiator fragments R'R"N-0» and «X and polym¬erise to structures of the type: R'R"N-0-A-X (A: polymer block). Specific R'R"N-0-X initiators mentioned are derived from cyclic structures, such as 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine, or open chain molecules, such as di-tert-butylamine.<br><br>
Recently some alternative polymerisation regulators have been published. WO 98/30601 discloses heterocyclic &gt;N-0-R compounds suitable for controlled polymerisation processes. WO 98/13392 discloses open chain alkoxyamines, which are derived from NO-gas or from nitroso compounds. The advantage of these prior art polymerisation methods over the ATRP-method is seen in the fact that no subsequent replacement of terminal groups of the polymer chains is needed.<br>
In view of the almost unlimited range of different technical applications, there remains a growing need for pigment dispersions of improved pigment affinity and rheology, as ex¬pressed by the viscosity of the mill base at a given shear rate and improved gloss of surface<br>
coatings.<br>
A prior art solution to this problem is disclosed in WO 00/40630, wherein pigment disper¬sions are disclosed containing block copolymers as dispersants, prepared by the ATRP-method. The block copolymers consist of defined hydrophobic and hydrophilic poly¬mer blocks. The difference in polarity is obtained by copoiymerising polymer blocks A and B wherein different amounts of monomer units with hydrophilic functional groups are present, such as amino or alkylated amino groups. This changes the hydrophilic/ hydrophobic char¬acter of the block copolymer dispersant. In one embodiment, the individual hydrophobic "A" blocks based on uncharged homo- or copolymers of methacrylate monomers form steric stabiliser blocks in solvent based coating formulations. The presence of more hydrophilic "B" blocks (e.g. amino functional acrylates or methacrylates) is the basis for pigment affinity to certain organic or inorganic pigments.<br>
it has surprisingly been found that the addition of salt forming components, such as mono-, bi- or tricyclic sulphonic, carboxytic and phosphonic acids, in the event that monomer units containing amino groups are present in the hydrophilic polymer blocks, produces pigment dispersions having improved properties for the above-mentioned technical applications.<br>

The term dispersing agent is defined within the limits of a so-called solid/ liquid dispersion, as opposed to other types of dispersions, such as liquid/ liquid (e.g. emulsions) or solid/gas (e.g. fumes) dispersions. Solid/liquid dispersions that apply consist of a two-phase system containing insoluble solid particles or solid particles of low solubility within a liquid. The dis¬persing agent enables solid particles, in the instant case pigment particles, to be distributed homogeneously within a liquid phase, e.g. water or organic solvent, or mixtures of both, or a polymer melt. Homogeneous distribution means that the concentration of the solid particles within the liquid phase in any volume fraction of the liquid phase is identical or approximately identical (even distribution of the solid particles).<br>

Another embodiment of the invention relates to the process for preparing the above-men¬tioned pigment dispersion, which comprises preparing the block copolymer (I) by copolym-erising the fragments A and B by free radical polymerisation and<br>
cc) modifying the block copolymer with the salt forming component, isolating and adding the modified block copolymer to dispersible pigment particles and optionally binder materials, fillers or other conventional additives; or<br>
p) modifying the block copolymer with the salt forming component in the presence of dis¬persible pigment particles and optionally binder materials, fillers or other conventional ad¬ditives.<br>
The method of free radical polymerisation that applies is the so-called living polymerisation with the &gt;N-0-X' compounds (A) defined above (&gt;N-0-R method). In the alternative, one of<br>
X and Y represents the fragment of one of a free radical initiator and the other one repre¬sents the chain terminal group from the free nitroxyl radical (B). The method of polymerisa¬tion that applies is the so-called living polymerisation with &gt;N-0» compounds in the presence of the free radical initiators mentioned above.<br>
The polymerisation process may be carried out in bulk or in the presence of water or an or¬ganic solvent or mixtures thereof. Additional co solvents or surfactants, such as glycols or ammonium salts of fatty acids, may be added to the reaction mixture. The amount of solvent should be kept as low as possible. The reaction mixture may contain the above-mentioned monomers or oligomers in an amount of 1.0 to 99.9% by weight, preferably 5.0 to 99.9% by weight, and especially preferably 50.0 to 99.9% by weight, based on the monomers present in the polymerisate.<br>
If organic solvents are used, suitable solvents or mixtures of solvents are typically pure al-kanes (hexane, heptane, octane, isooctane), hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, xylene), halogenated hydrocarbons (chlorobenzene), alkanols (methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether), esters (ethyl acetate, propyl, butyl or hexyl acetate) and ethers (diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, or mix¬tures thereof.<br><br>
If water is used as a solvent the reaction mixture can be supplemented with a water-miscibie or hydrophilic co solvent. The reaction mixture will then remain in a homogeneous single phase throughout the monomer conversion. Any water-soluble or water-miscibie co solvent may be used, as long as the aqueous solvent medium is effective in providing a solvent system that prevents precipitation or phase separation of the reactants or polymer products until full completion of the polymerisation. Exemplary co solvents useful in the process may be selected from the group consisting of aliphatic alcohols, glycols, ethers, glycol ethers, pyr¬rolidines, N-alkyipyrrolidinones, N-alkylpyrrolidones, polyethylene glycols, polypropylene gly¬cols, amides, carboxylic acids and salts thereof, esters, organosulphides, sulphoxides, sul-phones, alcohol derivatives, hydroxyether derivatives such as butyl carbitol or cellosotve, amino aicohols, ketones, and the like, as well as derivatives and mixtures thereof. Specific examples include methanol, ethanol, propanol, dioxane, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, di-ethylene glycol, glycerol, dipropylene glycol, tetrahydrofuran, and other water-soluble or wa¬ter-miscibie materials, and mixtures thereof- When mixtures of water and water-soluble or water-miscibie organic solvents are selected for the process, the water to co solvent weight ratio is typically in the range of about 100 ; 0 to about 10 : 90.<br>
When monomer mixtures or monomer/oligomer mixtures are used, the calculation of mol% is based on an average molecular weight of the mixture.<br>
Hydrophilic monomers, polymers and copolymers of the present invention can be separated from one another or from the polymerisation reaction mixture by, for example, distillation, precipitation, extraction, changing the pH of the reaction media or by other well known con¬ventional separation techniques.<br>
The polymerisation temperature may range from about 50°C to about 180°C, preferably from about 80°C to about 150°C. At temperatures above about 180°C, the controlled conversion of the monomers into polymers may decrease, and undesirable by-products like thermally initiated polymers are formed or decomposition of the components may occur.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the process, the polymerisation is performed by employing the Atomic Transfer Radical Polymerisation (ATRP) method in the presence of a suitable catalyst capable of activating controlled radical polymerisation and the polymerisation initia¬tor X-Y, which contains a radically transferable atom or group »X. Initiators of that type are described in WO 96/30421 and WO 98/01480. A preferred radically transferable atom or group »X is "CI or »Br, which is cleaved as a radical from the initiator molecule and subse¬quently replaced after polymerisation as a leaving group with the &gt;N -&gt; O compound (V) de¬fined below.<br><br>
Specific initiators are selected from the group consisting of a,cc'-dichloro- or cc.a'-dibromoxy-lene, p-toluene sulphonyl chloride (PTS), hexakis-(a-chloro- or a-bromomethyl)-benzene, 2-chloro- or 2-bromopropionic acid, 2-chloro- or 2-bromoisobutyric acid, 1-phenethyl chloride or bromide, methyl or ethyl 2-chloro- or 2-bromopropionate, ethyl-2-bromo- or ethyl-2-chloro-isobutyrate, chloro- or bromoacetonitrile, 2-chloro- or 2-bromopropionitrile, a-bromo-benz-acetonitrile and a-bromo-^butyrolactone {= 2-bromo-dihydro-2(3H)-furanone).<br>
A suitable catalyst capable of activating controlled radical polymerisation is a transition metal complex catalyst salt is present as an oxidisable complex ion in the lower oxidation state of a redox system. Preferred examples of such redox systems are selected from the group con¬sisting of Group V(B), VI(B), VII(B), VIII, IB and IIB elements, such as CuVCu2*, Cu°/Cu\ Fe°/Fe2+, Fe27Fe3+, Cr^'Cr3*, Co7Co2+, Co'VCo3*, Ni7Ni+, Ni7Ni2+, Ni^/NI3*, Mn°/Mn2+, Mn27Mn3+, Mn^/Mn4* or ZnTZn2*.<br>
The ionic charges are counterbalanced by anionic ligands commonly known in complex chemistry of transition metals, such hydride ions (H") or anions derived from inorganic or or¬ganic acids, examples being halides, e.g. F, CI", Br" or I", halogen complexes with transition metals, such as Cu'Br2\ halogen complexes of the type BF4", PFe", SbFe" or AsF6". anions of oxygen acids, such as sulphate, phosphate, perchlorate, perbromate, periodate, antimonate, arsenate or nitrate, alcoholates or acetylides or anions of cyclopentadiene.<br>
Anionic ligands and neutral may also be present up to the preferred coordination number of the complex cation, especially four, five or six. Additional negative charges are counterbal¬anced by cations, especially monovalent cations such as Na+, K\ NfV or (d^alkyl^N*.<br>
Suitable neutral ligands are inorganic or organic neutral ligands commonly known in complex chemistry of transition metals. They coordinate to the metal ion through a a-, n-, u.-, retype bonding or any combinations thereof up to the preferred coordination number of the complex cation. Suitable inorganic ligands are selected from the group consisting of aquo (H20), amino, nitrogen, carbon monoxide and nitrosyl. Suitable organic ligands are selected from the group consisting of phosphines, e.g. (CeHgJaP, (i-C3H7)3P, (C5H9)3P or (C6Hi,)3P, di-, tri-, tetra- and hydroxyamines, such as ethylenediamine, ethylenediaminotetraacetate (EDTA), N,N-Dimethyl-N',N'-bis(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-ethylenediamine (Me6TREN), catechol, N,N'-<br>
dimethyl-1,2-benzenediamine, 2-{methylamino)phenol, 3-(methylamino)-2-butanol or N,N'-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine, N,N,N',N",N"-pentamethyldiethyltriamine<br>
(PMDETA), d-Ce-glycols or glycerides, e.g. ethylene or propylene glycol or derivatives thereof, e.g. di-, tri- or tetraglyme, and monodentate or bidentate heterocyclic e~ donor li¬gands.<br><br>
The oxidisable transition metal complex catalyst can be formed in a separate preliminary re¬action step from its ligands or is preferably formed in-situ from its transition metal salt, e.g. Cu(l)CI, which is then converted to the complex compound by addition of compounds corre¬sponding to the ligands present in the complex catalyst, e.g. by addition of ethylenediamine, EDTA, Me6TREN or PMDETA.<br>
The various advantages of a polymerisation process of this type allowing flexible polymerisa¬tion reactions are described by K. Matyjaszewski in ACS Symp. Ser. Vol. 685 (1998), pg. 2-30.<br>
After completing the polymerising step process, the polymers obtained may be isolated or the &gt;N -&gt; O compound of the formula:<br><br>
which corresponds to the group Ao and wherein Rt - R4 and Ra and Rb are as defined above, is added in-situ. The isolating step of the present process may be carried out by known pro¬cedures, e.g. by distilling and filtering off unreacted monomer. After completing the substi¬tution of the polymerisate with the &gt;N-»0 compound (V), the catalyst salt is filtered off, fol¬lowed by evaporation of the solvent or by precipitation of the &gt;N-»0 polymer (I) in a suitable liquid phase, filtering the precipitated polymer and washing and drying.<br>
The elimination of the leaving group -X, e.g. halogen, and the substitution of the polymeri¬sate with the &gt;N -»O compound (V) is advantageously performed in such a way that the polymerisate is dissolved in a solvent and the &gt;N-»0 compound (V) is added. The reaction takes place within a temperature range from room temperature to the boiling temperature of the reaction mixture, preferably from room temperature to 100°C. The transition metal in the oxidisable transition metal complex catalyst salt is converted from its lower oxidation state in the above-mentioned redox systems to its higher oxidation state. In a preferred embodiment of that process a Cu(l) complex catalyst salt is converted to the corresponding Cu(ll) oxida¬tion state.<br>
Because the present polymerisation is a "living" polymerisation, it can be started and termi¬nated practically at will. The block copolymers (I) as obtained by the process defined above have a low polydispersity. Preferably the polydispersity is from 1.01 to 2.2, more preferably from 1.01 to 1.9, and most preferably from 1.01 to 1.5.<br><br>
According to the process variant a) the block copolymer (I) is modified by addition of the salt forming component (ii) defined above, and isolating the modified block copolymer (I) in pure form or as a solution or dispersion in water or an organic solvent or a mixture of both. The modified block copolymer is then added in pure form or as a solution or dispersion to dis¬persible pigment particles and optionally binder materials, fillers or other conventional addi¬tives.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the process the polymers or copolymers can be further processed and used in most cases without any further purification step. This is an important advantage when industrial scale-up is intended. According to the process variant P) the block copolymer (I) is modified with the salt forming component (ii) in the presence of dis¬persible pigment particles and optionally binder materials, tillers or other conventional addi¬tives. A separate mixture of the salt forming component (ii), dispersible pigment particles and the optional components, such as binder materials, fillers or other conventional additives, e.g. solvent, is prepared to which the block copolymer (I) is added.<br>
The sequential order of performing the individual mixing steps comprising the block copoly¬mer (I), the salt forming component (ii) and the optional components of the composition is non-critical according to the process of above.<br>
The pigments are added to the polymer dispersant by using conventional techniques, such as high speed mixing, ball milling, sand grinding, attritor grinding or two or three roll milling. The resulting pigment dispersion may have a pigment to dispersant binder weight ratio of about 0.1 :100.0 to 1500.0 :100.0.<br>
The organic solvents present in the dispersion are mentioned above, cf. process, and pref¬erably are commonly used solvents in coatings technology. For water based coatings appli¬cations, aside from water, preferably polar, water-miscible solvents such as C^alkohols, e.g. methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol, glycol ethers like butyl glycol, or methoxypropylene glycol, polyols, e.g. glycerol, or ethylene, diethylene, triethylene, triethylene or propylene glycol are used. For solvent based coating systems, preferably less polar solvents like ali¬phatic hydrocarbons, esters like n-butyl acetate, or glycol ethers like methoxypropylene gly¬col or glycol ether esters like methoxypropylene glycol acetate are used.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the process variants a) or p), fine pigment dispersions are prepared by mixing the pigments with a solution of the polymers or an aqueous emulsion of the polymers, concentrating the resulting mixture by distilling off the solvents and/or water, preferably to dryness, and optionally further subjecting the resulting concentrate to thermal and/or mechanical treatment to prepare a mixture comprising pigments and polymers which<br><br>
may then be subsequently dispersed in aqueous and/or organic solvents. According to this process, the solid composition of pigment and modified block copolymer is easy to disperse and does not require time and energy intensive grinding to be incorporated into e.g. a paint formulation.<br>
The above-mentioned methods for preparing the composition, such as high speed mixing, ball milling, sand grinding, attritor grinding or two or three roll milling may in the alternative be employed when preparing the dispersion.<br>
The present invention also relates to the use of the pigment dispersion described above for preparing coating compositions, prints, images, inks, lacquers, pigmented plastics, adhe-sives, casting resins, filled composites, glass fibre reinforced composites, laminates, cement based construction materials like plaster and tile adhesives. Likewise of particular interest is a specific embodiment of the above-mentioned process for preparing the dispersion, wherein coating compositions, for example paints, are prepared. The invention therefore also relates to compositions, wherein film-forming binders c) for coatings are added to the composition comprising components a) and b) described above.<br>
The novel coating composition preferably comprises 0.01-100.0 parts by weight of the com¬bined components a) and b) in the composition, in particular 0.05 - 50.0 parts, especially 0.1 - 20.0 parts, per 100.0 parts by weight of solid binder c).<br>
The binder c) can in principle be any binders which are customary in industry, for example those described in UHmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Edition, Vol. A18, pp. 368-426, VCH, Weinheim 1991, Germany. In general, the film-forming binder is based on a thermoplastic or thermosetting resin, predominantly on a thermosetting resin. Examples thereof are alkyd, acrylic, polyester, phenolic, melamine, epoxy and polyurethane resins and mixtures thereof. Also resins curable by radiation or air-drying resins can be used.<br>
Component c) can be any cold-curable or hot-curable binder. The addition of a curing cata¬lyst may be advantageous. Suitable catalysts that accelerate the curing of the binder are de¬scribed, for example, in UHmann's, Vol. A18, p.469.<br>
preference \s given to coating compositions in which component c) is a binder comprising a functional acrylate resin and a cross linking agent. Examples of coating compositions con¬taining specific binders are:<br>
1) Paints based on cold- or hot cross linkable alkyd, acrylate, polyester, epoxy or melamine resins or mixtures of such resins, if desired with addition of a curing catalyst;<br><br>
2)	Two-component polyurethane paints based on hydroxyl-containing acrylate, polyester or polyether resins and aliphatic or aromatic isocyanates, isocyanurates or polyisocyanates;<br>

In addition to the components mentioned above, the coating composition according to the invention preferably comprises a light stabiliser of the sterically hindered amine type, the 2-{2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine and/or the 2-hydroxyphenyl-2H-benzotriazole types. Further examples for light stabilisers of the 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine type advantageously to be added can be found e.g. in the published patent literature, e.g. US-A-4,619,956, EP-A-0 434 608, US-A-5,198,498, US-A-5,322,868, US-A-5,369,140, US-A-5,298,067, WO-<br><br>
94/18278, EP-A-O 704 437, GB-A-2 297 091, WO-96/28431. Of special technical interest is the addition of the 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazines and/or 2-hydroxyphenyl-2Hbenzo-triazoles, especially the 2-(2-hydroxypbenyl)-1,3,5-triazines.<br>
Apart from the components mentioned above, the coating composition can also comprise further components, examples being solvents, pigments, dyes, plasticisers, stabilisers, thixo-tropic agents, drying catalysts and/or levelling agents. Examples of possible components are those described in UHmann's, Vol. A18, pp. 429-471.<br>
Possible drying catalysts or curing catalysts are, for example, organometallic compounds, amines, amino-containing resins and/or phosphines. Examples of organometallic com¬pounds are metal carboxylates, especially those of the metals Pb, Mn, Co, Zn, Zr or Cu, or metal chelates, especially those of the metals Al, Ti or Zr, or organometallic compounds such as organotin compounds.<br>
Examples of metal carboxylates are the stearates of Pb, Mn or Zn, the octanoates of Co, Zn or Cu, the naphthenoates of Mn and Co or the corresponding linoleates, resinates or tallates.<br>
Examples of metal chelates are the aluminium, titanium or zirconium chelates of acetyl ace¬tone, ethyl acetyl acetate, salicylaldehyde, salicylaldoxime, o-hydroxyacetophenohe or ethyl trifluoroacetyl acetate, and the alkoxides of these metals.<br>
Examples of organotin compounds are dibutyltin oxide, dibutyltin dilaurate or dibutyltin dioc-toate.<br>
Examples of amines are, in particular, tertiary amines, for example tributylamine, triethano-lamine, N-methyldiethanolamine, N-dimethylethanolamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-methylmor-pholine or diazabicyclooctane (triethylenediamine) and salts thereof. Further examples are quaternary ammonium salts, for example trimethylbenzylammonium chloride.<br>
Amino-containing resins are simultaneously binder and curing catalyst. Examples thereof are amino-containing acrylate copolymers.<br>
The curing catalyst used can also be a phosphine, for example triphenylphosphine.<br>
The novel coating compositions can also be radiation-curable coating compositions. In this case, the binder essentially comprises monomeric or oligomeric compounds containing eth-ylenically unsaturated bonds, which after application are cured by actinic radiation, i.e. con¬verted into a crosslinked, high molecular weight form. Where the system is UV-curing, it generally contains a photo initiator as well. Corresponding systems are described in the above-mentioned publication UHmann's, Vol. A18, pages 451-453. In radiation-curable coat-<br><br>
ing compositions, the novel stabilisers can also be employed without the addition of sterically hindered amines.<br>
The coating compositions according to the invention can be applied to any desired sub¬strates, for example to metal, wood, plastic or ceramic materials. They are preferably used as topcoat in the finishing of automobiles. If the topcoat comprises two layers, of which the lower layer is pigmented and the upper layer is not pigmented, the novel coating composition can be used for either the upper or the lower layer or for both layers, but preferably for the upper layer.<br>
The novel coating compositions can be applied to the substrates by the customary methods, for example by brushing, spraying, pouring, dipping or electrophoresis; see also Ullmann's, Vol. A18, pp. 491-500.<br>
Depending on the binder system, the coatings can be cured at room temperature or by heating. The coatings are preferably cured at 50 - 150°C, and in the case of powder coatings or coil coatings even at higher temperatures.<br>
The coatings obtained in accordance with the invention have excellent resistance to the damaging effects of light, oxygen and heat; particular mention should be made of the good light stability and weathering resistance of the coatings thus obtained, for example paints.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to a coating, in particular a paint, which has been stabi¬lised against the damaging effects of light, oxygen and heat by a content of the compound of the formula (I) according to the invention. The paint is preferably a topcoat for automobiles. The invention furthermore relates to a process for stabilising a coating based on organic polymers against damage by light, oxygen and/or heat, which comprises mixing with the coating composition a mixture comprising a compound of the formula (I), and to the use of mixtures comprising a compound of the formula (I) in coating compositions as stabilisers against damage by light, oxygen and/or heat.<br>
The coating compositions can comprise an organic solvent or solvent mixture in which the binder is soluble. The coating composition can otherwise be an aqueous solution or disper¬sion. The vehicle can also be a mixture of organic solvent and water. The coating composi¬tion may be high-solids paint or can be solvent-free (e.g. a powder coating material). Powder coatings are, for example, those described in Ullmann's, A18, pages 438-444. The powder coating material may also have the form of a powder-slurry (dispersion of the powder pref¬erably in water).<br><br>
Likewise preferred is the use of the coating composition as a topcoat for applications in the automobile industry, especially as a pigmented or unpigmented topcoat of the paint finish. Its use for underlying coats, however, is also possible.<br>
The above-mentioned coating compositions or disperse systems may additionally contain fillers, such as calcium carbonate, silicates, glass fibres, glass beads, talc, kaolin, mica, barium sulphate, metal oxides and hydroxides, carbon black, graphite, wood powders, pow¬ders and fibres of other natural products, synthetic fibres, plasticisers, lubricants, emulsifiers, pigments, rheology additives, catalysts, flow auxiliaries, optical brighteners, flame retardants, antistatics, blowing agents.<br>

2. Preparation and testing of pigment dispersions containing modified block copolymers<br>
The performance of the different block copolymers modified with the acid addition salt components is evaluated in millbase preparations and corresponding coating formulations made therefrom.<br>
2.1 Preparation and testing of the millbase:<br>
A polyester millbase formulation is prepared according to the following prescription:<br><br>
Dependent on the active content of the different dispersants used and optional addi¬tions of acids, the formulation is slightly adjusted by solvents and DYNAPOL resin in order to adjust a pigment binder ratio of about 1. The components are ground with glass beads on a shaking machine (DIN 53238-13} for 4 hours. The viscosity of the millbase after grinding is measured at different shear rates with a cone-plate rheome-ter (Paar Physica UDS 200). Good dispersant efficiency can be seen by lowering of the millbase viscosity especially at mid to low shear rates, e.g. at a shear rate of 16. Two different processes for the preparation of the millbase are used:<br>
Process a)<br>
The modified block copolymer dispersant is prepared separately in form of a con¬centrate additive solution. This additive solution is added together with the other components of the millbase and then ground for 4 hours.<br>
Process P)<br>
The aminic block copolymer and the corresponding acids are added separately to the other components of the millbase and then ground for 4h. In this case, the modified block copolymer is formed "in situ" during the grinding of the millbase.<br><br>
3.	Preparation and testing of a full shade coating of type polvester/melamineyCAB<br>
Full shade formulations with a pigment content of 5% are made from the polyester-millbase according to the following general prescription:<br><br>
The full shade formulation is drawn down on glass, dried at room temperature and then cured at 130°C for 30 min. Gloss measurements are made on the cured coatings. High gloss is indicative for a good dispersion of the pigment in the final coating.<br>
4.	Results<br>
Table 3 shows the results of application tests of comparative formulations with block co¬polymers and formulations with modified block copolymers as well as the composition of the dispersants, Application results are based on the pigment Iragazin® Rubine TR in a coating system polyester/melamine/CAB.<br>
Table 4 shows the results with modified block copolymers tested in an alkyd/melamine coating system with the pigment Irgazin® DPP Red BTR. In comparison with the references, the formulations containing the modified block copolymers exhibit lower viscosities of the millbase and improved gloss in the cured coating.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
