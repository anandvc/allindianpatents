Description<br>
The present invention relates to pesticide compositions in the form of a water<br>
absorbent granular material which are suitable for combating arthropod pests, snails<br>
and nematodes, in particular for combating soil living pests. The invention also relates<br>
to a method for combating such pests, which comprises applying to the soil a<br>
pesticidally effective amount of at least one pesticide composition.<br>
Soil-living pests, including soil-living arthropod pests and nematodes, are often<br>
combated by applying an effective amount of a suitable pesticide compound to the soil.<br>
The pesticide compounds may be applied as a solid or liquid composition, in particular<br>
as a dust or granule formulation comprising an inert carrier such as clay. Such methods<br>
suffer from several disadvantages. For example, most soil-applied pesticides have<br>
potential for leaching. Therefore, care must be taken to minimize both surface and<br>
ground water contamination. Moreover, the effectiveness of the pesticide may vary<br>
depending on environmental conditions - e.g. properly timed rain is needed for the<br>
successful functioning of the chemistry in the soil, but too much rain may reduce the<br>
effectiveness and may cause leaching. A long-lasting effect against soil living pest is<br>
difficult to achieve.<br>
Furthermore, most of the present methods for combating soil living pests, in particular<br>
the methods for combating termites, are tedious and labour intensive and therefore<br>
expensive. Standard techniques for combating termites include e.g. trenching, rodding<br>
or drilling. Trenching requires digging deep trenches around the foundation and pouring<br>
large amounts of a liquid termiticide composition into the trench, together with soil.<br>
Rodding means inserting penetrating rods into the bottom of a trench around the<br>
foundation. The rods should be inserted no more than 15-30 cm apart to achieve a<br>
close barrier around the foundation. Drilling requires piercing the foundation and<br>
applying the liquid termiticide below the foundation, e.g. by means of a soil injection<br>
nozzle.<br>
WO 98/28973 discloses a process for protection of buildings against damage caused<br>
by insects, whereby an effective amount of an insecticidally active compound,<br>
preferably a 1-arylpyrazole compound, is spread around or under the building at<br>
discrete locations. The active compounds are applied as dilutions of conventional<br>
formulations and thus the process suffers from the aforementioned drawbacks.<br>
WO 89/12450 describes delivery compositions for pesticides comprising one or more<br>
solid superabsorbent polymers and one or more pesticidal agents, e.g. herbicides<br><br>
fungicides or an insecticide. The delivery compositions usually contain large amounts<br>
of additional substances such as film-forming agents or oil in order to slow the release<br>
rate of the active ingredient. The effectiveness of these compositions are not entirely<br>
satisfactory. This document does not address the problems associated with combating<br>
soil-living arthropod pests.<br>
DE 10124297 discloses formulations of active ingredients comprising superabsorbent<br>
polymers, which provide a reduced phytotoxicity of the active ingredient and thus are<br>
suitable for use in nutrient media for plants. The formulations are obtained by kneading<br>
the superabsorbent polymer and the active ingredient in the presence of water. The<br>
effectiveness of these formulations is not entirely satisfactory. This document does not<br>
address the problems associated with combating soil-living arthropod pests or<br>
nematodes.<br>
DE 10157350 discloses formulations of active ingredients comprising superabsorbent<br>
polymers which are obtained by kneading the superabsorbent polymer and the active<br>
ingredient in the presence of water. The tested formulations contain fungicides. The<br>
effectiveness of these compositions is not entirely satisfactory. This document does not<br>
address the problems associated with combating soil-living arthropod pests.<br>
WO 01/10212 discloses compositions containing an active ingredient and a water-in-oil<br>
polymer dispersion, wherein the oil phase contains water-swellable polymers. This<br>
document does not address the problems associated with combating soil-living<br>
arthropod pests.<br>
GB 2 210 884 discloses pesticide containing granules based on hydrophylic polymers.<br>
The granules are prepared by adding an aqueous emulsion containing the pesticide<br>
compounds to hydrophilic polymer granules and then drying the mixture. A spray-<br>
coating process is not described.<br>
US 4,983,390 discloses the use of superabsorbent polymers in pesticide compositions<br>
A granular pesticide composition, wherein the pesticide compound and the<br>
superabsorbent polymer make up at least 90% of the composition is not disclosed.<br>
WO 89/12451 and EP 285404 disclose flowable insecticidal delivery compositions<br>
containing superabsorbent polymers.<br>
WO 99/00187 discloses superabsorbent polymers. Pesticide compositions comprising<br>
these polymers were not described.<br><br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide compositions which are<br>
suitable for combating soil-living pests and which overcome the problems associated<br>
with the known techniques. In particular the compositions should be applicable easily<br>
and provide a long-lasting action on soil-living pests. Moreover, environmental<br>
conditions should not have an adverse effect on the effectiveness of the pesticide.<br>
It has now been found that the problems associated with combating soil-living pests by<br>
pesticide treatment of the soil can be overcome by a pesticide composition in the form<br>
of a water absorbent granular material as described herein.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to pesticide compositions in the form of a<br>
water absorbent granular material as described herein and to the use of such<br>
compositions for combating arthropod pests, in particular soil-living arthropod pests,<br>
snails and nematodes, with particular preference given to soil-living insect pests.<br><br>
The pesticide compositions according to the invention are a water absorbent granular<br>
material, which contains:<br>
i) from 0.001 to 10% by weight of at least one organic pesticide compound, in<br>
particular a pesticide compound that is active against said soil-living arthropod<br>
pest,<br>
ii) from 80 to 99.999% by weight of at least one granular super absorbent polymer,<br>
and<br>
iii) water,<br>
wherein the % by weight are based on the total weight of the composition, except for<br>
water and wherein the components i) and ii) make up at least 90% by weight of the<br>
composition except for water, and wherein the water absorbent granular material is<br>
obtainable by a process which comprises the treatment of superabsorbent polymer<br>
granules with a liquid aqueous composition containing the at least one pesticide<br>
compound.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for combating pests, selected from arthropod<br>
pests and nematodes, which comprises contacting said pests, their habitat, breeding<br>
ground, food supply, plant, seed, soil, area, material or environment in which the pests<br>
are growing or may grow, or the materials, plants, seeds, soils, surfaces or spaces to<br>
be protected from an attack of or infestation by said pest, with a pesticidally effective<br>
amount of at least one pesticide composition as defined herein.<br>
The invention in particular relates to a method for combating soil-living arthropod pests,<br>
and nematode pests, which comprises applying to the soil a pesticidally effective<br>
amount of at least one pesticide composition as defined herein.<br>
The term "soil-living" means that the habitat, breeding ground, area or environment in<br>
which a pest or parasite is growing or may grow is the soil.<br>
The term "organic pesticide compound" means an organic compound that is suitable<br>
for combating animal pests, in particular arthropod pests, snails and nematode pests.<br>
The term "granular material" means that the composition has the form of granule<br>
particles. The granule particles contain the at least pesticide compound.<br>
The method of the present invention provides several advantages over conventional<br>
methods of combating pests, in particular soil-living arthropod pests and nematodes. In<br>
particular they are less tedious than conventional methods and less amount of<br>
pesticide compound is necessary to provide effective control of the pests. Moreover the<br><br>
compositions provide a long lasting action on soil-living pests and nematodes and<br>
environmental conditions have less effect on the effectiveness of the pesticide. The risk<br>
of leaching of the pesticide is minimal and thus the risk of environmental contamination,<br>
in particular surface and ground water contamination, is minimized by the compositions<br>
as defined herein.<br>
The granular pesticide compositions according to the invention preferably contain from<br>
85 to 99.998% by weight, in particular from 90 to 99.995% by weight, based on the<br>
total weight of the composition except for water, of at least one granular<br>
superabsorbent polymer.<br>
Superabsorbent polymers are well-known synthetic particulate organic polymers which<br>
are solid and hydrophilic, which are insoluble in water and which are capable of<br>
absorbing a multiple of their weight of water or aqueous solutions, thereby forming a<br>
water containing polymer gel, but which on drying again form particles. Superabsorbent<br>
polymers according to the present invention are generally capable of absorbing at least<br>
100 parts by weight of water per one part by weight of superabsorbent polymer<br>
(deionised water at 25°C, pH 7.5, 1 bar). The amount of water or aqueous solution a<br>
superabsorbent polymer is capable of absorbing, is also termed as absorption capacity<br>
or maximal absorption. For purposes of the invention, superabsorbent polymers are<br>
preferred which have an absorption capacity for deionised water (pH 7.5, 25°C, 1 bar)<br>
of at least 150 g/g, e.g. 150 to 500 g/g, in particular 200 to 500 g/g, more preferably<br>
300 to 500 g/g of superabsorbent polymers. For purposes of the invention,<br>
superabsorbent polymers are preferred which have an absorption capacity for a 0.1%<br>
by weight aqueous solution of sodium chloride of at least 100 g/g, in particular 100 to<br>
300 g/g of superabsorbent polymer (pH 7.5, 25°C, 1 bar). The maximal absorption or<br>
absorption capacity can be determined by routine methods known e.g. from F. L.<br>
Buchholz et al. "Modern Superabsorbent Polymer Technology", Wiley-VCH 1998, p.<br>
153 (absorbent capacity method) or EP 993 337, example 6.<br>
Preferred superabsorbent polymer granules are those which have a moderate swelling<br>
rate, i.e. superabsorbents, wherein the time required to achieve 60% of the maximal<br>
absorption is at least 10 minutes, in particular from 10 to 100 minutes. These values<br>
can be determined according to standard methods as described in F. L. Buchholz et<br>
al., loc. cit., p. 154 (swelling kinetics methods).<br>
The superabsorbent polymers may be nonionic or ionic crosslinked polymers. For the<br>
purpose of the invention, the superabsorbent polymer is preferably selected from<br>
crosslinked anionic superabsorbent polymers, in particular from covalently crosslinked<br>
anionic superabsorbent polymers. A survey of suitable superabsorbent polymers is e.g.<br>
given in F. L. Buchholz et al., loc. cit., p. 11-14.<br><br>
Crosslinked anionic superabsorbent polymers are crosslinked polymers which<br>
comprise anionic functional groups or acidic groups, which can be neutralized in water,<br>
e.g. sulfonic acid groups (SO3H or SO3"), phosphonate groups (PO3H2 or PO32") or<br>
carboxylate groups (CO2H or CO2")- These polymers are in principle obtainable by a<br>
process which comprises copolymerizing a monoethylenically unsaturated acidic<br>
monomer and a crosslinking monomer optionally in the presence of a grafting base and<br>
optionally in the presence of one or more further neutral monoethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomers. In preferred superabsorbent polymers the carboxylate groups make up at<br>
least 80 mol-%, in particular at least 95 mol-%, of the acidic groups.<br>
Suitable acidic monomers include monoethylenically unsaturated mono- and<br>
dicarboxylic acids having preferably from 3 to 8 carbon atoms such as acrylic acid,<br>
methacrylic acid, ethacrylic acid, a-chloroacrylic acid, crotonic acid, maleic acid, maleic<br>
anhydride, itaconic acid, citraconic acid, mesaconic acid, glutaconic acid, aconitic acid<br>
and fumaric acid; monoesters of monoethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acids<br>
having from 4 to 10 and preferably from 4 to 6 carbon atoms, for example monoesters<br>
of maleic acid such as monomethyl maleate; monoethylenically unsaturated sulfonic<br>
acids and phosphonic acids, for example vinylsulfonic acid, allylsulfonic acid, sulfoethyl<br>
acrylate, sulfoethyl methacrylate, sulfopropyl acrylate, sulfopropyl methacrylate,<br>
2-hydroxy-3-acryloyloxypropylsulfonicacid, 2-hydroxy-3-methacryloyloxypropylsu!fonic<br>
acid, styrenesulfonic acid, 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid, vinylphosphonic<br>
acid and allylphosphonic acid and the salts, especially the sodium, potassium and<br>
ammonium salts, of these acids. The acidic monomers usually make up at least 15 %,<br>
by weight, preferably at least 20 % by weight, of the superabsorbent polymer, e.g. 15 to<br>
99.9 % by weight, in particular from 20 to 99.8 % by weight, based on the acidic form of<br>
the anionic superabsorbent polymer.<br>
Preference is given to crosslinked anionic superabsorbent polymers, wherein the<br>
polymerized acidic monomers comprise at least one monoethylenically unsaturated<br>
carboxylic acid CA or a salt thereof. Preferably the monoethylenically unsaturated<br>
carboxylic acid CA or the salt thereof accounts for at least 80 mol-%, in particular at<br>
least 95 mol-% of the total amount of polymerized acidic monomeres.<br>
Useful crosslinking monomers include compounds having at least two, for example 2,<br>
3, 4 or 5, ethylenically unsaturated double bonds in the molecule. These compounds<br>
are also referred to as crosslinker monomers. Examples of crosslinker monomers are<br>
N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide, polyethylene glycol diacrylates and polyethylene glycol<br>
dimethacrylates, each derived from polyethylene glycols having a molecular weight<br>
from 106 to 8500 and preferably from 400 to 2000, trimethylolpropane triacrylate,<br>

ether or polyethylene glycol digiycidyi ether with 2 mol of pentaerythritol triallyl ether or<br>
allyl alcohol, and divinylethyleneurea. The amount of crosslinker monomer is generally<br>
in the range from 0.05 to 20% by weight, preferably in the range from 0.1 to 10% by<br>
weight and especially in the range from 0.2 to 5% by weight, based on the weight of the<br>
superabsorbent polymer in the acidic form.<br>
Suitable grafting bases can be of natural or synthetic origin. They include oligo- and<br>
polysaccharides such as starches, i.e. native starches from the group consisting of<br>
corn (maize) starch, potato starch, wheat starch, rice starch, tapioca starch, sorghum<br>

polysaccharides, for example cyclodextrins having from 4 to 8 ring members. Useful<br>
oligo- and polysaccharides further include cellulose and also starch and cellulose<br>
derivatives. It is also possible to use polyvinyl alcohols, homo- and copolymers of<br>
N-vinylpyrrolidone, polyamines, polyamides, hydrophilic polyesters or polyalkylene<br>
oxides, especially polyethylene oxide and polypropylene oxide as a grafting base. The<br>
amount of grafting base may be up to 50 % by weight of the weight of the<br>
superabsorbent polymer in the acidic form, e.g. from 1 to 50 % by weight.<br>
The monomers forming the superabsorbent polymer may also contain neutral<br>

an acidic group. Examples are monoethylenically unsaturated hydrophilic monomers,<br>
i.e. monomers having a water solubility of at least 80 g/l at 25°C 1 bar, including<br>
hydroxyalkyl esters of monoethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acids, e.g. the<br><br>

weight, in particular from 20 to 79.9 % by weight of the superabsorbent polymer in the<br>
acidic form.<br>

Preferably, the carboxylic acid CA and the amide AM make up at least 80% by weight,<br>
e.g. from 80 to 99.95% by weight, and more preferably at least 90% by weight, e.g.<br>
from 90 to 99.9% by weight, of the ethylenically unsaturated monomers M forming the<br>
superabsorbent polymer. In this embodiment the crosslinking monomer will generally<br>
make up from 0.05 to 20% by weight, in particular from 0.1 to 10% by weight of the<br>
monomers M.<br>
In a particular preferred embodiment, the monomers M comprise at least 90% by<br>

embodiment the crosslinking monomer will generally make up from 0.05 to 20% by<br>
weight, in particular from 0.1 to 10% by weight of the monomers M.<br>
In particular, the superabsorbent polymer of this embodiment comprises in polymerized<br>

Preferably, the average particle size of the superabsorbent polymer granules ranges<br>
from 0.1 to 5 mm, preferably from 0.2 to 5 mm, in particular from 0.5 to 4 mm. The<br>
average particle size is the weight average of the diameter which may be determined<br>
by microscopy or by sieving analysis.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the superabsorbent polymer granules,<br>
which are used for preparing the pesticide composition are surface crosslinked (see<br>
F.L. Buchholz, loc. cit. pp. 97 to 103, and the literature cited therein). In the surface<br>
crosslinked polymer granules some of the functional group in the surface region of the<br>
superabsorbent polymer granules have been crosslinked by reaction with<br>
polyfunctional compounds. Surface crosslinking can be a covalent or ionic crosslinking.<br>
Apart from surface crosslinking, the surface of superabsorbent polymer granules, which<br>
are used for preparing the pesticide composition, may have been treated with additives<br>
to reduce their dustiness and/or to ease their flow, including treatment with anti-caking<br>
additives such as particulate silica, in particular fumed silica, optionally in combination<br>
with polyols, or quaternary surfactants.<br>
The water absorbent composition also comprises at least one organic pesticide<br>
compound, which is active against arthropod pest and/or nematodes. Generally, the<br>
pesticide compound is a non-polymeric organic compound having a molecular weight<br><br>
ranging from 150 to 1000 Dalton. Suitable pesticide compounds may be solid or liquid<br>
at room temperature. Usually they are not volatile at room temperature, i.e. they have a<br>
vapour pressure of not more than 1 mbar at 298 K, in particular not more than<br>
0.1 mbar.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the pesticide compound is selected from a<br>

Metaflumizone, Chlorfenapyr, Abamectin, Endosulfan, Spinosad, the compounds of<br>

Amongst the pesticide compounds mentioned herein, preference is given to<br>
compounds which do not have a repellent activity against the target organism.<br>
Likewise, preference is given to compounds which provide a slow-acting toxin against<br>
the target organism.<br><br>
Particularly preferred pesticide compounds, which are particularly useful for combating<br>
soil living arthropod pests, include Fipronil, Metaflumizone, Chlorfenapyr and<br>
compounds of the formula I, in particular compounds of the formula I, wherein X and Y<br>
are chlorine, Z is trifiuoromethyl, R1 is methyl or ethyl, R2 and R3 are methyl, or R2 and<br>
R3 together with the adjacent carbon atom are 2,2-dichlorocyclopropyl or<br>

Thus a very preferred embodiment of the invention relates to compositions, which<br>
contain fipronil.<br>
Another preferred embodiment of the invention relates to compositions, which contain<br>
metaflumizone.<br>
Another preferred embodiment of the invention relates to compositions, which contain<br>
chlorfenapyr.<br>
A further preferred embodiment of the invention relates to compositions, which contain<br>
at least a compound of the formula P5, as defined herein.<br>
The compositions of the invention preferably contain from 0.005 to 8 % by weight, in<br>
particular from 0.01 to 5 %, most preferably from 0.01 to 1 % by weight, based on the<br>
total weight of the composition except for water, of at least one, e.g. 1, 2 or 3 pesticide<br>
compounds.<br>
In the compositions of the invention, the at ieast one pesticide compound is absorbed<br>
to the granules of the superabsorbent polymer. It is assumed that the at least one<br>
pesticide compound is distributed non-uniformly within the granules of the pesticide<br>
composition, the major portion of the at least one pesticide compound, preferably at<br>
least 80 % by weight, being located in the outer parts of the granules, in particular on<br>
the surface or close to the surface of the granules. Therefore it is assumed that the<br>
granules of the composition comprise a shell region, containing the major portion of the<br>
at least one pesticide compound, and a core region containing no or only small<br>
amounts of the pesticide compound.<br>
The average particle size of the granules containing the pesticide compound is similar<br>
to the size of the superabsorbent polymer granules used for the preparation and will<br>
generally be in the range from 0.1 to 5 mm, preferably from 0.2 to 5 mm and more<br>
preferably from 0.5 to 4 mm.<br>
The pesticide compositions of the invention also comprise water. The amount of water<br>
may vary over a broad range. Though the pesticide composition is generally applied to<br><br>
the soil in the dry state, a certain amount of water is necessary to increase the activity<br>
of the composition (bio-enhanced state). In the dry state means that the pesticide<br>
composition contains only small amounts of water, e.g. from 0.1 to 15 % by weight, in<br>
particular from 0.5 to 10 % by weight, based on the weight of superabsorbent polymer<br>
in the composition, and the granules are mechanically stable and can be stored over<br>
prolonged period. In the bio-enhanced state, the water absorbent composition usually<br>
contains at least 5 % by weight, frequently at least 10 % by weight, preferably at least<br>
15 % by weight, more preferably at least 50 % by weight, based on the weight of<br>
superabsorbent polymer in the composition, by weight of water, but the amount of<br>
water might be as high as 100 % by weight, based on the weight of superabsorbent<br>
polymer in the composition, or higher, the upper limit being the swelling capacity of the<br>
superabsorbent polymer in the composition (e.g. up to 150, 300 or 500 times of the<br>
weight of the superabsorbent polymer in the composition).<br>
Additionally, the pesticide compositions may comprise co-formulants (additives), i.e.<br>
compounds which are present in conventional pesticide formulations or which are<br>
incorporated in the pesticide formulation to modify their properties. The amount of co-<br>
formulant will generally not exceed 10 % by weight or 5 % by weight, based on the total<br>
weight of the composition, except for water. Frequently, co-formulants are present in<br>
amounts ranging from 0.01 to 10 %, by weight, in particular from 0.1 to 5 % by weight,<br>
based on the total weight of the composition, except for water.<br>
Suitable co-formulants (additives) include<br>
a)	surfactants, including dispersants, wetting agents and emulsifiers;<br>
b)	organic solvents;<br>
c)	defoamers (anti-foams);<br>
d)	thickeners;<br>
e)	preservatives;<br>
f)	dyes or pigments; and<br>
g)	neutralizing agents; and<br>
h)	attractants.<br>

reacted with an alkyleneoxide, in particular with a C2-C4-alkylene oxide, preferably with<br>
ethyleneoxide or with a mixture of ethyleneoxide and propyleneoxide to form an<br>

The water absorbent pesticide compositions of the invention are prepared by a process<br>
which comprises the treatment of superabsorbent polymer with an aqueous liquid<br>
composition of the pesticide compound, in particular with an aqueous dilution of a<br>
conventional pesticide formulation. In this process, the superabsorbant polymer<br>
material is used in the term of polymer granules having an average particle size from<br>
0.1 to 5 mm, in particular from 0.2 to 5 mm or from 0.5 to 4 mm.<br>
As used herein and readily understood by a skilled person, a dilution is a composition<br>
which has been obtained by diluting a formulation with a diluent, in particular water or a<br>
mixture thereof with an organic solvent.<br>
Treatment of the superabsorbent polymer granules can be achieved by analogy to<br>
conventional methods for treating solid granules with liquid material. Suitable<br>
techniques include spraying an aqueous liquid composition containing at least one<br>
pesticide compound and the aqueous liquid carrier to the superabsorbent polymer<br>
granules. Preference is given to methods, which comprise treatment of the<br>
superabsorbent polymer granules with the liquid aqueous pesticide composition,<br>
preferably with am aqueous dilution of a conventional pesticide formulation, in a<br>
fluidized state (fluidized bed techniques). Likewise suitable is the treatment in a mixer<br>
or granulator, including drum granulators, pan granulators, high shear granulators,<br>
mixer granulators, in a Nauta-mixer, a plowshare mixer, in paddel mixers and the like.<br>
The superabsorbent polymer granules may be in the swollen state or preferably in the<br>
dry state when treated with the pesticide compound or with a composition containing<br>
the pesticide compound. Dry state means that the superabsorbent polymer granules<br>
contain not more than 15% of its weight of water, in particular less than 10% by weight.<br>
Preferably, the superabsorbent polymer is in the form of granules, in particular dry<br>
granules containing less than 10% of their weight of water.<br><br>
Liquid compositions suitable for treating the superabsorbent polymer granules include<br>
conventional aqueous liquid formulations - i.e. formulations containing the pesticide<br>
compound dissolved, suspended or emulsified in an aqueous liquid carrier, which can<br>
be water or a mixture of water with an organic solvent, or an aqueous dilution of a<br>
conventional formulation, which might not be necessarily an aqueous formulation.<br>
Suitable conventional formulations for preparing an aqueous dilution include any<br>
conventional formulation including liquid formulations as well as solid formulations,<br>
which usually contain the pesticide compound and optionally a solid or liquid carrier.<br>
Examples of liquid formulations, which can be used for preparing an aqueous dilution,<br>
include solutions, soluble concentrates (SL), dispersible concentrates (DC), aqueous<br>
and non-aqueous suspensions (SC, FS, OD), emulsifiable concentrates (EC), oil-in-<br>
water-emulsions (EW), water-in-oil-emulsions (EO), Micro-emulsions, multiple<br>
emulsions, oil enhanced suspension concentrates (OESC), suspo-emulsions etc.<br>
Examples of suitable solid formulations, which can be used for preparing an aqueous<br>
dilution, include wettable powders (WP), water dispersible granules (WG) and water<br>
dispersible tablets (TB). The concentration of the pesticide compound in the<br>
conventional formulation may vary from 0.5 to 80% by weight, in particular from 1 to<br>
60% by weight, in particular from 5 to 50% by weight, based on the weight of the<br>
conventional formulation.<br>
Preferably, the superabsorbent polymer granules are treated with an aqueous liquid<br>
composition containing the at least one pesticide compound, in particular with an<br>
aqueous dilution of a conventional formulation. The composition that is applied to the<br>
superabsorbent polymer granules is an aqueous liquid composition, - i.e. the liquid<br>
carrier is water or a mixture of water with an organic solvent. In the preferred aqueous<br>
liquid compositions water will generally make up at least 50% by volume, preferably at<br>
least 80% by volume in particular at least 90% by volume, based on the total volume of<br>
the liquid carrier. In particular, the aqueous liquid composition is a dilution of a<br>
conventional formulation, that is a composition which has been diluted with an aqueous<br>
diluent. The aqueous diluent is water or a mixture of at least 50 v/v of water with an<br>
organic solvent. In the preferred aqueous diluent water will generally make up at least<br>
60% v/v, preferably at least 99% v/v, based on the total volume of the aqueous diluent.<br>
Preferably, the concentration of the pesticide compound in the aqueous liquid<br>
composition suitable for treating the superabsorbent polymer is from 0.01 to 20%, by<br>
weight, in particular from 0.1 to 15% by weight and more preferably from 0.5 to 10% by<br>
weight, based on the total weight of the composition. Preferably at least a part of the<br>
liquid carrier is removed during or after treatment of the superabsorbent polymer, e.g.<br>
by evaporation.<br><br>
In addition to the liquid carrier and the at least one pesticide compound, the liquid<br>
compositions, which are applied to the superabsorbent polymer, may contain<br>
conventional additives (co-formulants) as described above. These additives are<br>
conventional for formulations of pesticide compounds and may depend on the type of<br>
formulation used. Since these additives are usually not removed after mixing with the<br>
superabsorbent polymer, the compositions of the invention may contain one or more of<br>
the aforementioned additives. However, the total amount of these additives will not<br>
exceed 10% by weight and is e.g. from 0.1 to 10% by weight, based on the total weight<br>
of the composition, except for water.<br>
It has been proven advantageous when the treatment of the superabsorbent polymer<br>
granules with the liquid pesticide composition is performed at temperatures from 15 to<br>
90°C, in particular from 30 to 80°C and more preferably from 35 to 60°C. In particular it<br>
is preferred to heat the superabsorbent polymer granules to the temperatures given<br>
above, before treating them with the liquid formulation.<br>
For purposes of the invention it has been proven advantageous to perform treatment of<br>
the superabsorbent polymer granules by using spray coating techniques. In the spray-<br>
coating process the liquid pesticide composition, in particular an aqueous liquid<br>
composition of the pesticide compound, is sprayed on the superabsorbent polymer<br>
granules and at least a part of the liquid carrier is removed by evaporation. The thus<br>
obtainable water-absorbent pesticide compositions have particularly beneficial<br>
properties and therefore they are also subject of the present invention as well as the<br>
spray coating process described herein.<br>
Preferably, the viscosity of the liquid formulation which is used for spray coating does<br>
not exceed 10 mPa s, and ranges in particular from 0.8 to 5 mPas, more preferably<br>
from 0.9 to 2 mPa.s (at room temperature).<br>
Spray coating can principally be achieved by any conventional spray drying, spray<br>
coating and spray granulating techniques known in the art. Preferred techniques are<br>
fluidized bed spray coating techniques.<br>
In the fluidized bed spray coating, the liquid pesticide composition is sprayed, e.g. by<br>
means of one or more nozzles, to the superabsorbent polymer particles, which are<br>
maintained in a fluidized state during spraying. Fluidized state means that the apparent<br>
density of the superabsorbent polymer particles is reduced by mechanical means or in<br>
particular by introducing a gas stream into the superabsorbent polymer granules,<br>
thereby taking them upwards and maintaining them in fluidized bed state.<br><br>
Suitable fluidized bed processes work according to the principle that the liquid<br>
formulation of the at least one pesticide is finely atomized and the droplets randomly<br>
collide with the superabsorbent polymer granules which are held in a fluidized state.<br>
The size of the droplets should be inferior to the particle size of the superabsorbent<br>
polymer granules and usually does not exceed 500 urn. Droplet size can be<br>
manipulated in a well known manner by the type of nozzle, the spraying conditions i.e.<br>
temperature, concentration, viscosity of the liquid formulation. The droplets of the liquid<br>
pesticide formulation may be introduced either concurrently with the particle flow of the<br>
polymer granules (bottom-spray coating) or from the side into the particle flow<br>
(tangential spray coating), and may also be sprayed from the top onto a fluidized bed of<br>
the superabsorbent polymer granules (top spray coating).<br>
Preferably the fluidized state of the superabsorbent polymer granules is achieved by<br>
means of a carrier gas which is introduced into the superabsorbent polymer granules<br>
and which keeps them in a fluidized bed state. Suitable carrier gas include air, and inert<br>
gas such as nitrogen, argon and the mixtures thereof.<br>
It is advantageous that the gas stream of the carrier gas, which preferably enters the<br>
spray drying apparatus from below, is chosen such that the total amount of the<br>
superabsorbent polymer granules is fluidized in the apparatus. The gas velocity for the<br>
fluidized bed is usually above the minimum fluidization velocity (measurement method<br>
described in Kunii and Levenspiel "Fluidization engineering" 1991) and below the<br>
terminal velocity superabsorbent polymer granules, preferably 10% above the minimum<br>
fluidization velocity. The gas stream also acts to vaporize the liquid carrier, i.e. water or<br>
the organic solvents.<br>
Spray-coating may be preformed in a batch or continuously. Continuous means that<br>
fresh superabsorbent polymer particles are continuously fed to the spray-coating<br>
device and that treated superabsorbent polymer is continuously taken from the spray-<br>
coating device after passing all spraying-zones inside the device.<br>
Suitable spray coating devices, which make use of fluidized bed technique, include for<br>
example the fluidized or suspended bed coaters and spouted bed coaters familiar in<br>
seed dressing and in the pharmaceutical industry. Examples for spray coating<br>
processes and devices which make use of for fluidized bed techniques and which are<br>
suitable for the process of the present invention include the spray mixers of the<br>
Telschig type, the Wurster process and the Glatt-Zeller process. Likewise suitable are<br>
Schuggi mixers, turbolizers or plowshare mixers.<br>
The Wurster and the Glatt-Zeller processes are described for example in<br>
"Pharmazeutische Technologie, Georg Thieme Verlag, 2nd edition (1989), pages 412-<br><br>
413" and also in "Arzneiformenlehre, Wissenschaftliche Verlagsbuchhandlung mbH,<br>
Stuttgart 1985, pages 130-132". Particularly suitable batch and continuous fluidized<br>
bed processes on a commercial scale are also described in Drying Technology, 20(2),<br>
419-447 (2002). Mixers of the Telschig type are e.g. described in Chemie-Technik, 22<br>
(1993), Nr. 4, p. 98 ff. Each of these processes can be used by analogy for the<br>
treatment of superabsorbent polymer granules with pesticide formulations. The spouted<br>
bed technology uses a simple slot instead of a screen bottom to generate the fluidized<br>
bed and is particularly suitable for materials which are difficult to fluidize.<br>
Suitable spray drying / spray coating equipments making use of the fluidized bed<br>
technique are commercially available, e.g. the laboratory devices of type series MP-<br>
Micro™, MP-1 Multi-Processor™, and Strea-1™ and the production devices of type<br>
series Precision Coater™ and Multi-Processor™ (all of GEA-Aeromatic Fielder AG,<br>
Switzerland); the fluidized bed dryers or granulaters of the type series WST and WSG,<br>
the powder coater granulators of the type series GPCG, the continuous granulation<br>
devices of the type series AGT, the continuous fluidized bed dryers of the type series<br>
GF, the semi continuous fluidized bed dryers of the Multicell™ series, the spouted bed<br>
coaters of the Procell™ series (all of Glatt Maschinen- und Apparatebau AG). A<br>
suitable apparatus for the Glatt-Zeller process has also been described for example in<br>
US 5,211,985.<br>
The thus obtainable water absorbent pesticide compositions contain the at least one<br>
pesticide compound and the superabsorbent polymers, water and optionally further<br>
additives contained in the liquid formulation. The relative amounts of these constituents<br>
are given above. The pesticide compound is mainly iocated on the surface of the<br>
granules, however, it may be partly absorbed into the interior of the granules.<br>

snails.<br>

The soil living pests may generally be controlled by contacting the target pest, its food<br>
supply, or its locus with a pesticidally effective amount of pesticidal compositions as<br>
described herein. "Locus" means a habitat, breeding ground, area, material or<br>
environment in which a pest or parasite is growing or may grow. In general,<br>
"pesticidally effective amount" means the amount of active ingredient needed to<br>
achieve an observable effect on growth, including the effects of necrosis, death,<br>
retardation, prevention, and removal, destruction, or otherwise diminishing the<br>
occurrence and activity of the target organism. The pesticidally effective amount can<br>
vary for the various compositions used in the invention. A pesticidally effective amount<br>
of the compositions will also vary according to the prevailing conditions such as desired<br>
pesticidal effect and duration, target species, locus, mode of application, and the like.<br>
The water-absorbent pesticide compositions of the present invention are particularly<br>
useful for combating soil living pests and thus the composition is preferably applied to<br>
the soil. In particular the composition is introduced into the soil or applied<br>
subterraneously, e.g. from 0.5 to 50 cm below. The pesticide composition, however,<br>
can also be applied onto the soil.<br>
The amount of pesticide compound, which is necessary to achieve effective control of<br>
the target pest may depend on the type of pest and pesticide compound and may vary<br>
from 0.1 g to 2000 g per hectare, desirably from 1 g to 600 g per hectare, more<br>
desirably from 5 g to 500 g per hectare of pesticide compound. As a rule of thumb, the<br>
water-absorbent pesticide composition allow a reduction of the amount of pesticide<br>
compound, which is necessary to achieve effective control of the target pest, of at least<br>
20%, in particular of at least 40%, in comparison with conventional pesticide granule<br>
formulations.<br>
As outlined above, the presence of water is necessary to activate the compositions of<br>
the present invention. Small amounts such as 5% by weight, based on superabsorbent<br>
polymer in the composition, may be sufficient, however effectiveness increases, when<br>
the amount of water exceeds 10% by weight, preferably 20% by weight, in particular<br>
50% by weight, in particular 100% by weight, based on superabsorbent polymer in the<br>
composition. Due to the swelling properties of the superabsorbent polymers in the<br>
composition, the dry composition can be activated either by addition of water or by<br><br>
absorbing humidity from the atmosphere or from the soil. Preferably the compositions<br>
are applied to the soil in their dry state and optionally activated by addition of water.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention relates to the protection of buildings<br>
such as houses, outhouses, carports, factories etc., which are susceptible to attack of<br>
or infestation with arthropod soil-living pests, in particular termites. In this embodiment,<br>
the pesticide composition may be applied to the soil to form a treated area completely<br>
surrounding a building which is to be protected against attack of or infestation with the<br>
soil-living pest. The treated area surrounding the building can be prepared by digging a<br>
narrow trench into the soil, introducing the water absorbent pesticide composition into<br>
the trench, optionally moistening with water and refilling the trench, e.g. with the<br>
excavated soil. Moistening can also be performed after refilling the trench. Likewise,<br>
the excavation can be mixed with the water absorbent pesticide composition and<br>
thereafter the mixture is optionally moistened and refilled into the trench. It is likewise<br>
possible to apply the herein described pesticide composition onto the soil. It is then,<br>
however, be advantageous to cover the composition with soil. The amounts of<br>
pesticide, which is necessary to achieve effective control may vary depending on the<br>
pesticide compound in the composition but will generally be from 0.05 mg/m2 to<br>
100 mg/m2, in particular from 0.1 mg/m2 to 50 mg/m2 of the treated area and<br>
calculated as the pure pesticide compound. It is likewise possible to apply the pesticide<br>
composition to the soil to form discrete treated areas along the perimeter of the<br>
building.<br>
In a similar manner, any material which is susceptible to attack of or infestation with<br>
arthropod soil-living pests, in particular termites and/or ants, can be protected, said<br>
materials including wooden materials such as trees, board fences, sleepers, furniture,<br>
etc., and wooden construction materials, but also leathers, fibers, vinyl articles, electric<br>
wires and cables etc. In order to protect the material it is, however, also possible to<br>
apply the pesticide compositions of the invention to lumbered articles such as surfaces<br>
of the under-floor concrete, alcove posts, beams, plywoods, furniture, etc., wooden<br>
articles such as particle boards, half boards, etc. and vinyl articles such as coated<br>
electric wires, vinyl sheets, heat insulating material such as styrene foams, etc.<br>
Another preferred embodiment of the present invention relates to the protection of<br>
fields of cultivated plants, which are susceptible to attack of or infestation with<br>
arthropod soil-living pests. In this embodiment, effective control is achieved by<br>
incorporation the pesticide composition into the soil in the fields which are to be<br>
protected against attack or infestation of the soil-living pests. Application may be<br>
broadcast, in furrows or bands. If necessary, the compositions can be activated by<br>
addition of water. It may be advantageous to cover the composition with soil. The<br>
amounts of pesticide, which is necessary to achieve effective control may vary,<br><br>
depending on the pesticide compound contained in the pesticide composition. The<br>
amount will be generally from 0.5 to 1000 g/ha in particular from 1 to 500 g/ha,<br>
calculated as the pure pesticide compound. This embodiment is particularly useful for<br>
achieving effective control of Diabrotica sp, white grubs (Phyllophaga, etc.), wireworms<br>
(Agriotes, etc.) and termites. Crop, which can be protected that way include soybeans,<br>

In case of application against ants doing harm to crops or human beings, the<br>
composition of the present invention may be directly applied to the nest of the ants or<br>
to its surrounding.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the pesticide compositions are used for the<br>
protection of seeds against harmful pest. In this method the seed material is applied to<br>
the soil together with the granular pesticide composition described herein. Preferably, a<br>
mixture of the granular pesticide composition and the seed is applied, when sowing<br>
seed. However it is also possible to apply the seed material and the pesticide<br>
composition separately, but ensuring that the seed and the pesticide composition are<br>
both present in the soil. The amounts of pesticide, which is necessary to achieve<br>
effective protection may vary, depending on the pesticide compound contained in the<br>
pesticide composition. The amount will be generally chosen that the amount of<br>
pesticide compound contained in the composition is from 0.1 g to 10 kg per 100 kg of<br>
seed, preferably from 1 g to 5 kg per 100 kg of seed, calculated as pesticide<br>
compound. This embodiment is particularly useful for achieving effective control of<br>
Seed, which can be protected that way include soybeans, beans, oil seed rape,<br>
potatoes, corn, maize, wheat, barley, oats, sorghum, rice, seeds of sugar beet,<br>
sunflower, sugarcane, turf and forage, peas, cotton, ornamentals and of vegetable<br>
such as cucurbits, tomatoes, lettuce, carrots, onions and cruciferous.<br>
