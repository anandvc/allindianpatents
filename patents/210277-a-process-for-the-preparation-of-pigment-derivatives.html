The present invention relates to novel compounds which can direct and control the growth and/or crystal phase of pigment particles. Such compounds are particularly useful when present during the synthesis of the pigment.<br>
A number of patents describe processes for the direct synthesis of pigments in a pigmentary form to avoid the additional expensive and oftentimes environmentally unfriendly pigment finishing processes (e.g. processes for particle size reduction and/or crystal-form modification). For example E.P. Patent No. 643,110 and U.S. Patent No. 5,424,429 describe a direct synthesis of quinacridone solid solutions and 2,9-dichloroquinacridone in pigmentary form, respectively, in the presence of quinacridone phthalimidomethyl derivatives. E.P. Patent No. 685,530 describes the preparation of a direct synthesis of pigmentary grade dioxazine in the presence of a dioxazine derivative.<br>
It is also known that sulfonic acid derivatives of certain pigments can effectively diminish the crystal growth during the isolation of the pigment from a reaction mixture. Such sulfonic acid derivatives are described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 3,386,843. Other patents describe the use of sulfonic acid derivatives of pigments to stabilize against recrystailization and   change of crystal modification as, for example, in G.B. Patent No. 1,544,839 which is directed to phthalocyanine pigments.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,755,873 describes a method for the preparation of quinacridone pigments in which a quinacridone derivative is incorporated during synthesis and copending provisional application Ser. No. 60/087,773 describes a direct synthesis of pigmentary diketopyrrolopyrrole pigments in the presence of quinacridone or diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives.<br>
The Japanese Patent No. 061 45 546 describes phthalimidomethyl dihydroquinacridones and the use thereof as pigment dispersants.<br>
Known particle growth inhibitors which are derived from pigment derivatives are often strongly colored and can behave as an impurity.<br><br>
Based on the state of the art it is unexpected that non planar molecules can act as particle growth inhibitors and crystal phase directors for pigment crystals composed of planar organic pigment molecules.<br>
Although the addition of such known pigment derivatives can be advantageous, pigment synthesis in the presence of such derivatives in many cases does not provide the favored pigmentary crystal size, shape or crystal modification. Therefore many pigments so synthesized may still require finishing steps to obtain pigments with the preferred color characteristics.<br>
The present invention is based on the discovery that new selected pigment derivatives in which a specific aromatic or hetero aromatic group is linked by a methylene group to a pigment molecule are particularly effective for directing and controlling the growth and/or crystal modification of pigment particles when present during the pigment synthesis step.<br>
Such pigment particle growth directors can be prepared by simple synthesis procedures and offer the pigment manufacturer a means to prepare a pigment providing the preferred color characteristic without requiring additional pigment finishing step.<br>
The inventive compounds allow the manufacturer to produce high performance organic pigments in an economical and environmentally friendly manner of producing high performance organic pigments and thus, are of extreme commercial importance.<br>

A further embodiment of the present invention is a process for the preparation of compounds of formula I or II, wherein:<br>
a)	the pigment of the pigment moiety Q1 or Q2 is dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid;<br>
b)	the intermediate X1 or X2is added into the solution and dissolved at a temperature below 50°C;<br>
c)	para-formaldehyde is added at a temperature below 50°C;<br>
d)	and then is heated to a temperature from to 50 to 100°C;<br>
e)	and then isolated.<br>
The pigment moiety Q1 or Q2 and the intermediate X1 or X2, a substantial portion of which is the moiety of group X1 or X2, are reacted with formaldehyde in the inventive process.<br>
Preferably the reaction is carried out in concentrated (95-98%) sulfuric acid. In one preferred method, the pigment of the pigment moiety Q1 or Q2 is dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid at a concentration of about 5 to 30 weight percent, most preferably about 10 to 20 weight percent at a temperature below about 50°C, preferably at about 35 to 45'°C. The intermediate X1 or X2 is added to the pigment solution at a temperature below about 50*^0, preferably at about 35 to 45°C and is also dissolved. Finally the formaldehyde is added, preferably in the form of para-formaldehyde, at a temperature below about 50°C, preferably at about 35 to 45°C. The reaction mixture is heated to a temperature from to 50 to 100°C and stirred at that temperature until the reaction is complete, preferably for about 30 minutes to 6 hours, most preferably from about 30 to 90 minutes, and drowned into ice water. The slurry is stirred for about 5 minutes to 6 hours, preferably from about 30 minutes to 3 hours, at a temperature from about 0 to 50°C, preferably from about 10 to 25°C. The reaction mixture is drowned into water to provide a precipitate. Then the inventive compounds are then isolated by filtration or centrifugation and are preferably washed with water. The resulting product cake can be dried or can be used in the form of an aqueous cake as an additive during the pigment synthesis.<br>
In general a stochiometric amount of pigment, intermediate X1 or X2and formaldehyde is used; however an excess of the intermediate X1 or X2 or formaldehyde may be used to<br><br>
achieve the desired product. Preferably, the molar ratio of the pigment: intermediate X1 or X2: formaldehyde is 1 : 1 to 1.2 :1 to 2.<br>
if a high degree of sulfonation is desired, the reaction mixture is stirred at higher temperature, for example, above 60°C. If it is desirable to have a low degree of sulfonation, the reaction is maintained at lower temperature, for example, below 60°C.<br>
The isolated samples can be analyzed by known methods, for example, by elementary analysis or mass spectrometry such as LCMS, GCMS or the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization technique (MALDI) or by the HPLC method, all of which are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Using the preferred technical preparation method described above, which does not include specific cleaning steps, the purity of the isolated product is generally not 100 % and contains, depending on the starting materials and reaction temperature, some remaining starting materials or other byproducts which, when in a concentration that does not impact the effect of the particle size and crystal phase director, are tolerated and can actually provide additional advantageous effects. By technically well known methods, such as solvent treatments, recrystallization or precipitation from basic polar solvent solutions, for example in basic dimethyl sulfoxide or dimethyl formamide, such products can be further purified, if desired.<br>
Generally, the inventive pigment particle growth and crystal phase director compounds are added at a concentration of about 0.1 to 15 percent, preferably about 0.3 to 10 percent and most preferably about 0.5 to 8 percent, based on the pigment to be synthesized, before or during the final steps of pigment synthesis.<br>
The inventive pigment particle growth and/or crystal phase directors are suitable as additives for the synthesis of pigments of several pigment classes including pigments of the anthraquinone, phthalocyanine, perinone, perylene, diketopyrrolopyrrole, thioindigo, iminoisoindoline, iminoisoindolinone, quinacridone, flavanthrone, dioxazine, indanthrone, anthrapyrimidine and quinophthalone pigment classes. Preferably, but not essentially, the pigment used in the pigment moiety Q1 of the inventive compounds belongs to the same pigment class as the pigment being synthesized.<br>
The inventive compounds of formula I are particularly suitable for the synthesis of direct pigmentary grade diketo pyrrolopyrrole and quinacridones and/or its solid solutions, and<br><br>
6,13-dihyciroquinacriclones of formula II are particularly suitable for the synthesis of direct pigmentary grade diketo pyrrolopyrrole and quinacridones and/or its solid solutions, Said compounds of formula I and II are highly suitable for the synthesis of quinacridone pigments in their specific crystal modifications, such as the alpha, beta or gamma quinacridone, 2,9-dichloroquinacridone, 2,9-dimethyl-quinacridone, 4,11-dichioroquinacridone and solid solutions thereof. The inventive pigment particle growth directors are particularly effective when said pigment particle growth directors are completely or partially soluble in the reaction media in which the pigment is being synthesized.<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention concerns a process for the direct synthesis of a pigmentary grade anthraquinone, phthalocyanine, perinone, perylene, diketopyrrolopyrrole, thioindigo, iminoisoindoline, iminoisoindolinone, quinacridone, flavanthrone, dioxazine, indanthrone, anthrapyrimidine or quinophthalone pigment wherein said pigment is synthesized in the presence of 0.1 to 25 weight percent of a pigment particle growth and/or crystal phase director compound of formula I or II of claim 1, based on the weight pigment being synthesized.<br>
Preferably, the process for the direct synthesis of a pigmentary grade quinacridone, quinacridone, 2,9-dichloroquinacridone, 4,11-dichloroquinacridone, 2,9-dimethyl-quinacridone, wherein said pigment or solid solution thereof is synthesized in the presence of 0.1 to 25 weight percent of a pigment particle growth and/or crystal phase director compound of formula I, based on the weight pigment being synthesized.<br>
Further, the present invention concerns a process for the preparation of a pigmentary grade -anthraquinone, phthalocyanine,-perinone, perylene, dikelopyrroloptyrrole, thioindigo, iminoisoindoline, iminoisoindolinone, quinacridone, flavanthrone, dioxazine, indanthrone, anthrapyrimidine and quinophthalone pigment comprising a kneading, solvent or aqueous milting finishing step or a premilling followed by an after treatment step in an organic solvent, preferably concerns a process for the preparation of a pigmentary grade diketopyrrolopyrrole quinacridone or comprising a premilling followed by an after treatment step in an organic solvent, in the presence of 0.1 to 25 weight percent of a 6,13-dihydroquinacridone of formula I, based on the weight of the pigment being finished.<br>
In addition, the present invention concerns a process for the preparation of a direct pigmentary diketopyrrolopyrrole or quinacridone pigment or a solid solution thereof<br><br>
comprising the step of synthesizing said pigment or solid solution in the presence of 0.1 to 25 percent by weight of at least one compound of formula I, or of 0.5 to 8 percent by weight of a 6,13-dihydroquinacridone of formula II, based on the pigment being synthesized.<br>
Without limiting this invention to any particular theory, it is believed that the inventive particle growth director molecule adheres to the synthesized pigment molecule and by doing so directs the crystal growth and crystal phase. The term "directing the crystal growth" refers to controlling the synthesis of pigment particles to have a suitable pigmentary size as well as directing the growth of the crystals to generate particles of a specifically desired shape, such as platelet, needle, cubic, leaflet, prismatic and other geometric forms, in a desired crystal phase. The effect can be influenced by the chemical structure of the organic pigment, the selection of the reaction media and the concentration and chemical structure of the inventive particle growth inhibitor.<br>
Under circumstances in which the reaction media of the pigment to be synthesized is oxidative, the inventive 6,13-dihydroquinacridone derivative may be partially or completely oxidized to the corresponding quinacridone derivative during the pigment synthesis. Therefore, the inventive 6,13-dihydroquinacridone derivatives are particularly useful for the quinacridone pigment synthesis when the quinacridone pigment is obtained by the oxidation of the corresponding 6,13-dihydroquinacridone as described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,840,901.<br>
During the isolation of the pigment, for example in the filtration step, these compounds -<br>
when soluble in the reaction media - can be washed out and if desirable, be recollected from<br>
the filltrate or wash liquid. Typically, these compounds are partially left on	the pigment<br>
surface and can have additional benefits. Such benefits are, for example, improved pigment properties such as rheological properties, dispersibility and wetting behavior, flocculation resistance and improved heat stability.<br>
Additionally, it has been found that phthalimidomethyl dihydroquinacridone, previously described as a pigment dispersant, can be an effective pigment particle growth controller and pigment crystal phase director.<br>
In certain cases, it is advantageous to use the inventive compounds in mixture or in combination with other additives including known pigment particle growth inhibitors such as,<br><br>
for example, phthalimidomethyl-, imidazolmethyl- or pyrazolmethyl-quinacridone, pigment sulfonic acids or specific polymers; or other optional ingredients such as wetting agents, surfactants, defoamers, antioxidants, UV absorbers, light stabilizers, plastisizers, or general texture improving agents and so forth. Any such additional additives may be used as long as said additives are stable under the pigment synthesis conditions and have no negative impact on the final pigment properties or the environment. Generally such additives can be used in a concentration from about 0.1 to 25 percent, preferably from about 0.2 to 15 percent and most preferably from about 0.5 to 8 percent, based on the pigment to be synthesized. The resulting pigment/additive mixture can be used in any conventional pigment application, such as in the formation of paints, inks, color filters, fibers, paper and textiles.<br>
Suitable polymers are, for example, polyacrylic acid, polymethacrylic acid, polymaleic anhydride, polyurethane, polyvinylether, polyvinylalcohol, polyalkylene glycol, polyethylene oxide, cellulose derivatives, polyimine, polyvinylpyridine, or copolymers such as copolymers of acrylic acid with styrene, acrylonitriie, vinylacetate, vinylphosphonate, vinyipropionate, vinylchloride, itaconic acid or maleic anhydride, or a mixture thereof, or polymeric derivatives like ethoxylated or propoxylated fatty amines such as ethoxylated cocoalkyi, oleyl or soyaalkyi amines; ethoxylated or propoxylated fatty quaternary salts such as ethoxylated cocoalkyltrimethyl ammonium chloride; ethoxylated fatty amides such as ethoxylated oleamides; alkyl-, cycloalkyi- or alkylaryl-oxypoly (ethylen-oxy)ethanol, cycloalkyloxypoly(ethylenoxy)laurate or oleate, polyethylene glycol 400 laurate or oleate, alkyl-, cycloalkyi- or alkylaryl-poly(ethylenoxy)carboxylate or phosphonate.<br>
Suitable surfactants include anionic surfactants such as aikylbenzene- or alkylnaphthalene-^ulphonates, alkylsulfosuccinates or naphthalene formaldehyde sulfonates; cationic surfactants including, for example, quaternary salts such as benzyl tributyl ammonium chloride; or nonionic or amphoteric surfactants such as polyoxyethylene surfactants and alkyl- or amidopropyl betaines, respectively<br>
Suitable texture improving agents are, for example, fatty acids such as stearic acid or behenic acid, and fatty amines such as laurylamine and stearylamine. In addition, fatty alcohols or ethoxylated fatty alcohols, polyols such as aliphatic 1,2-diols or epoxidized soy bean oil, waxes, resin acids and resin acid salts may be used for this purpose.<br><br>
Suitable UV stabilizers are, for example, the known benzotriazol derivatives known under the trade name TINUVIN or CIBA Fast H Liquid an aryl sulfonated benzotriazol, both being products of CIBA Specialty Chemicals Corporation,<br>
Due to the ability to act as an antiflocculant as well as an excellent particle growth inhibitor and phase director, the inventive compounds can generally be used in the pigment finishing, pigment treatment, or pigment application such as an additive during the pigment dispersion step in bead mills, extruder, calander and so forth, as well as during pigment synthesis. Also, the inventive compounds are themselves strongly colored and can be used as coloring agents, for example in the paints, inks, color filters, plastics, fibers, and in the paper or textile industry.<br>
The present invention concerns the use of compounds of formula I or II to enhance heat stability, rheological and flocculant properties of pigments particles.<br>
Further, the present invention concerns a method of improving the heat stability, rheological and flocculant properties of pigment particles, said method comprising adding to said pigment particles at least one compound of claim 1 in an amount sufficient to reduce flocculation or improve the heat stability.<br>
Pigment finishing processes in which the inventive 6,13-dihydroquinacridone derivatives can be used are for example the known kneading, solvent or aqueous milling processes.<br>
Additionally, many of the inventive compounds provide physical properties that are similar to<br>
those of pigments' specifically low solubility in organic-solvents or the 	application media.<br>
Therefore, said compounds are non-bleeding and, for example, will not migrate into food when a pigment composition containing the inventive compound is used as a coloring agent in food packaging materials.<br>
Particulariy effective are the inventive 6,13-dihydroquinacridone derivatives when present in pigment finishing processes in which a pigment crude is premilled and after treated in an organic solvent, a process as described for example in the US patents Nr, 5,194,088 and 2,857,400.<br><br>
The said 6,13-clihydroquinacridone derivatives are particularly suited for pigments of various pigment classes having different shades because they themselves are only slightly colored and therefore, the presence of the inventive compounds does not lower the saturation or change the hue of the pigment.<br>
Furthermore, the present 6,13-dihydroquinacridones derivatives are non planar molecules. Based on the state of the art it is unexpected that non planar molecules can act as particle growth inhibitors and crystal phase directors for pigment crystals composed of planar organic pigment molecules.<br>
The following examples further describe some preferred embodiments of the invention, but do not limit the scope of the invention. In the examples, all parts are by weight unless otherwise indicated.<br>
