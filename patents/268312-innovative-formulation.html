				<td>INNOVATIVE FORMULATION Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of insecticide, acaricide, fungicide, snailcide and vermicide compositions, particularly those in which the active principle (A) is mixed with synergistic substances (B) having various mechanisms of action, for example substances inhibitory to detoxification mechanisms in insects. New formulations in microcapsules based on polyesters, polyarnides, polyureas, polycarbamates, polyurethanes or urea-formaldehyde polymers are described in which the effect of (A) and (B) is further enhanced by the different release times of the two components, and in which the average release time of component (A) [t(A)] is delayed by a time interval At ~ 0<a of between and hours preferably relative to the average release time component said innovative formulations are particularly more effective than those available commercially mainly against damaging species which have developed resistance biological activity prior art></a>
The problem of tolerance and resistance to insecticidal, acaricidai, fungicidal, snailcidal and vermicidal activity is particularly serious and of growing importance, leading to the ever more difficult control and eradication of damaging species (insects, mites, moulds, snails, worms) so that protection against their action in agriculture, veterinary medicine, domestic hygiene and in manufactured articles becomes necessary.<br>
Many damaging species have strengthened their natural defences and immune systems against the toxins with which they come into contact, so that to achieve their eradication, dosages have to be increased or new insecticides, acaricides, fungicides, snailcides or vermicides must be continually used with consequent greater risks and damage to the entire ecosystem and the overall food chain up to man, and with rising costs.<br>
It is widely reported in the literature that the use of substances such as piperony! butoxide (PBO) and its analogues, sesamol, verbutin, MGK 264 and DEF, can enhance insecticidal, acaricidai, fungicidal, snailcidal and vermicidal activity in vitro<br><br>
and/or in vivo, either by inhibiting the activity of certain insect metabolic enzymes involved in detoxification and resistance or by other mechanisms of action [see for example Gunning R.V. et al., "Piperonyl Butoxide", pages 215-225, Academic Press (1998); Benchaoui HA et al. J.Pharm.Pharmacol. 1996, 48, 753-759; Wen Z. et al., Pest Science 1997, 49, 367-371; Zhao J-Z J. Econ. Entomol. 2000, 93,1508-1514; Nishiwaki H. et al., J. Pest Science 2004, 29,110-116 and the patent applications DE 4426942, EP 617890].<br>
In order to better demonstrate the synergistic activities, particularly in cases where the damaging species is most resistant, treatment with the synergistic product at different times prior to the active principle or a repeated treatment with active principle was proposed; pre-treatment with the synergistic compound is particularly beneficial in that subsequent exposure to the active principle occurs on the already sensitised damaging species, thus with weakened capacity to defend themselves, and is therefore more effective. Separate administrations however are not very practical and are economically unfavourable compared with a single application of the two components.<br>
Also described in the literature and in patent applications are insecticide, acaricide, fungicide, snaibde and vermicide formulations in microcapsules based on polymers such as polyesters, polyamides, polyureas, polycarbamates, polyurethanes or based on urea-formaldehyde polymers, and the corresponding preparation procedures [see for example Gimeno M., J. Environ. Sci. Health, 1996, B31(3), 407-420 , Finch C.A. in "Encapsulation and controlled release", special publication , Royal Society of Chemistry 1993, 138, 1-12 and the patent applications EP183999, WO03/051116, US2003/0119675T US2002/0158356 A1, WO00/04776, EP 322820]. The main purposes of said formulations are: greater stability, prolonged biological effect due to a gradual release over time with consequent dilution of side-effects over time, and lower toxicity for operators, other animal species and the ecosystem etc. Although some principles and the methodology of this type of formulation have been known for some time, in order to follow the established objectives it is nevertheless necessary to modulate the characteristics of the encapsulation system. The use of some active principles microencapsulated in polymer matrices based on<br><br>
polyesters, polyamides, polyureas, polycarbamates, polyurethanes or based on urea-formaldehyde polymers in optional combination with non-encapsulated or separately encapsulated synergistic products has been generically described [ZA 8700881, DE3708671] while a formulation simultaneously containing an insecticide active principle (A) and a synergistic compound (B) in a monolayer or multilayer microcapsule is exemplified and claimed in WO97/14308, without however any data on improvement of biological activity compared to the same microencapsulated product in the absence of the synergistic compound. The previous literature, even when combined, has therefore not provided the expert of the art with any useful information for preparing the innovative formulation of the present invention, nor has it suggested an effectiveness of said formulation surprisingly superior to that of a mixture of the two components (A) and (B) administered simultaneously on insecticidal, acaricidaf, fungicidal, snailcidal or vermicidal activity for agricultural applications, for veterinary medicine use, for domestic hygiene or for the protection of manufactured articles. The result achieved with the present invention enables to overcome the drawbacks of the known art and to significantly improve the performance of commercially known active principles by means of a single treatment, particularly for resistant damaging species. Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an innovative formulation, characterised by the presence of two components, one of which (A) possesses insecticidal, acaricidal, fungicidal, snailcidal or vermicidal activity and the other (B) exhibits synergistic activity with the first by enhancing its effectiveness, and in which the average release time of component (A) [t(A)3 is delayed by a time interval At = [t(A)]-[T(B)] of between 1 and 12 hours, preferably between 2 and 10 hours, relative to the average release time of component (B) [t(B))].<br>
The invention also relates to its use for eradicating damaging species in agriculture, veterinary medicine, domestic hygiene or in manufactured articles. The new formulation is obtained according to one of the following alternatives using per se known procedures (in addition to the scientific and patent literature already cited, see for example the following patents US3577515, US 4280833, US 4285720<br><br>
and patent application US 2002/0158356 whose teachings are herein incorporated).<br>
a)	individual microencapsulation of both components (A) and (B) within a multilayer system based on polyesters, polyamides, polyureas, polycarbamates, polyurethanes or urea-formaldehyde polymers in which component (A) is in a more interior portion of the capsule than component (B), and is separated from the latter by a polymer layer of suitable thickness as in figure 1;<br>
b)	microencapsulation of both components within a single layer system of suitable thickness based on polyesters, polyamides, polyureas, polycarbamates, polyurethanes or urea-formaldehyde polymers as in figure 2, in combination with an immediate-release emulsion/microemulsion containing an additional amount of component (B).<br>
When the polymer is polyurea, the process is as follows:<br>
a)	an oil phase, containing the component (A) alone or (A)+(B) to be encapsulated, a possible solvent (e.g. Solvesso 200) if the active substances are solids, and a polyisocyanate alone or mixed with a variable quantity of a different polyisocyanate e.g. toluene diisocyanate, is dispersed in an aqueous phase containing a surfactant such as a lignin sulfonate<br>
b)	a polyamine such as hexamethylenediamine which gives rise to polymerisation is then added, or alternatively heating is applied to induce a partial hydrolysis of the isocyanate groups which subsequently self-condense under hot conditions<br>
c)	the capsules thus formed consist of a polyurea wall within which component (A) alone or components (A)+(B) are present<br>
d)	where the capsule contains component (A) alone, the operation can be repeated such that the new polymerisation takes place this time in the presence of the species (B) to obtain multilayer capsules such as those shown in figure 1.<br>
Alternatively if the single layer capsule already contains the two components (A) and B, a emulsion/microemulsion formed by mixtures of anionic and nonionic surfactants containing the immediate-release component (B) is added in order to obtain the desired formulation (figure 2).<br>
In general the material constituting the capsule wall represents a fraction of the capsule weight, ranging between 5% and 30%.<br><br>
When the polymer is polyamide the process is as follows:<br>
a)	an oil phase, containing the component (A) alone or (A)+(B) to be encapsulated, a possible solvent (e.g. Solvesso 200) if the active substances are solids, and an acid chloride e.g. sebacoyl chloride alone or mixed with a variable quantity of other acid chlorides, is dispersed in an aqueous phase containing a surfactant such as a Itgnin sulfonate<br>
b)	a poiyamine or a polyoxyalkylene polyamine (e.g. Jeffamine D-230) is added, alone or mixed with ammonia or with other amines or inorganic bases neutralizing the acidity formed during polymerisation<br>
c)	the capsules thus formed consist of a polyamide wail, formed by discontinuous or continuous process, within which component (A) alone or components (A)+(B) are present.<br>
d)	where the capsule contains component (A) alone the operation can be repeated so that the new polymerisation takes place this time in the presence of the species (B) to obtain multilayer capsules such as those shown in figure 1.<br>
Alternatively if the single layer capsule already contains the two components (A) and B, a emulsion/microemulsion formed by mixtures of anionic and nonionic surfactants containing the immediate-release component (B) is added in order to obtain the desired formulation (figure 2).<br>
In a similar manner, capsules can be formed having as membrane a polyester, a poiycarbamate, a polyurethane or a urea-formaldehyde polymer by selecting suitable monomer precursors of the capsule polymer.<br>
By adjusting the relative ratio of the quantities of co-monomers as well as the relative ratio of the quantities of substances to be encapsulated and the quantities of components of the polymer and the surfactant, the thickness and structure of the capsule membrane can be controlled. Other modulatable parameters for this purpose are: temperature and time of polymerisation, quantity of solvent, use of polymerisation inhibitors in suitable quantities, addition of polymer cross-linking substances. Consequently the time of encapsulated substance release can be controlled as can, most important for the purposes of the present invention, the average release time of component (A) [t<a>] being delayed by a time interval At = [t{Aj]-<br><br>
[t(B)] of between 1 and 12 hours, preferably between 2 and 10 hours, relative to the<br>
average release time of component (B) [t(B)].<br>
By "average release time ftT it is meant the time by which 50% (by weight) of the<br>
total amount of (A) present in the microcapsule has been released.<br>
By "average release time [t(B)]", it is meant the time by which 50% (by weight) of the<br>
total amount of (B) present in the microcapsule has been released; in the particular<br>
embodiment of figure 2, [t(B)] is always set to zero because the immediate-release<br>
emulsion/microemulsion   releases   (B)   immediately   after   administration;   the<br>
immediate-release emulsion /microemulsion always contains 50% or more of the<br>
total (B) present in the formulation, therefore [t(B)] in figure 2 cannot be higher than<br>
zero; accordingly, in figure 2, [t(B)] = 0, and At = [t(A)].<br>
The term "immediate-release" is used to highlight the standard behaviour of<br>
emulsions/microemulsions, which do not cause any appreciable delay in releasing<br>
the emulsified active principle, as compared to normal solutions; thus no particular<br>
provisions       are       required       for       preparing       the       immediate-release<br>
emulsions/microemulsions of component (B), and they can be obtained by reference<br>
to standard procedures for preparing emulsions/microemulsion.<br>
The microcapsules of the invention are stable when moist ; the breakage of the<br>
microcapsule  wall   and,  consequently,   the   phenomenon  of   release   initiates<br>
immediately when microcapsules start to dry.<br>
As stated above, the release from the microcapsules initiates immediately after the<br>
solution is removed, i.e. typically when the formulation is applied/ sprayed e.g. onto a<br>
plant, in the ground, in the air, etc). In this way, the above referred At corresponds to<br>
the actual difference in time of administration to plants and insects.<br>
The determination of t(A) and t<b can be made as follows. an aliquot of the></b>
suspension of the microcapsules is immediately put onto a series of glass plates; the<br>
loaded glass plates are maintained at standard ambient conditions for different<br>
times; at the end of each time, the corresponding glass plate is washed with a solvent<br>
of (A) or (B) which is not solvent of the microcapsule wall (typically n-hexane); in such<br>
a way only the released components are extracted for quantification, by e.g. HPLC.<br>
The time corresponding to a 50% release (as compared to the total (A) or (B) loaded<br><br>
into the microcapsules), will be respectively the t(A) or t(B).<br>
Other well known techniques such as electron microscopy enable to determine the<br>
average diameter of the microcapsules, being in the range of 1-100 micron,<br>
preferably less than 50 micron.<br>
The new formulation is particularly effective against damaging species that have<br>
developed resistance to treatment with the same active substance, and induces, for<br>
the same quantity of active principle, a substantially higher mortality of the damaging<br>
species than that demonstrated by the same components (A) and (B) used in a<br>
mixture as such or microencapsulated separately within the same polymer materials<br>
or microencapsulated jointly but with the same release time.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>

a multilayer system;<br>
Figure 2 shows microencapsulation of both components within a single layer system<br>
of     suitable     thickness     in     combination     with     an     immediate-release<br>

Preferred examples of synergistic compounds (B) are piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and its analogues, sesamol, verbutin, MGK 264 and DEF, with PBO and its analogues and verbutin being preferred. PBO is particularly preferred. The synergistic compounds can be used as such or already pre-formulated with additives; an example of a commercially available pre-formulation is designated as PB80EC-NF which contains 88% PBO and 12% emuisifier (dialkylsulfosuccinate, also known as SOITEM).<br>
The quantity of component (A) relative to component B (calculated in its total quantity, i.e.    both    that    co-encapsulated    with    (A)    and    that    present    in    the<br><br>
emuIsiorVmicroemulsion), is between 1% and 1500%, preferably between 2% and<br>
200% and even more preferably between 5% and 100%.<br>
Emulsifiers, UV stabilizers, antioxidants and other additives non-specific for active<br>
principle activity but useful for the specific application can also be present in the<br>
aforesaid formulation.<br>
The quantity of said additives relative to the constituent polymer of the capsule is<br>
preferably between 0% and 30% (weight/weight), more preferably between 1% and<br>
15%. These percentages refer to all additives present, also including those already<br>
present in the pre-formulations of the active principles utilized.<br>
Usable emulsifiers are for example dodecylbenzenesulfonate, dialkylsulfosuccinate,<br>
lignin sulfonates, phospholipids, polyethylene glycols.<br>
Usable UV stabilizers are for example 2~hydroxy-4-methoxy-benzophenone, 2-<br>
hydroxy-4-octoxy-benzophenone, 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyIpiperidinesebaca-te.<br>
A usable antioxidant is for example 2,6-di-tert-butyl-1 -hydroxy-toluene.<br>
For those formulations of the present invention wherein a synergistic compound is<br>
also present as a emuision/microemulsion, the latter can be the same as or different<br>
from that present in the microcapsule.<br>
The  composition of the invention  can  be provided as a solid,  as an  oily<br>
solid/suspension composition or as a homogeneous emuision/microemulsion and is<br>
soluble or completely emulsifiable in water or in aqueous mixtures of water-miscible<br>
solvents. Said formulations can be used as such or previously emulsified in water or<br>
in aqueous solutions of water-miscible solvents, such as a C1-4 alcohol; the content<br>
of water miscible solvent is between 0% and 99%, preferably between 0% and 60%.<br>
The process for preparing the microcapsules, forming the basis of the aforesaid<br>
compositions, uses per se known technologies.<br>
More specifically the process for preparing the microcapsules can be performed in<br>
accordance with one of the following methods, indicated as process (i) and process<br>
(ii) respectively.<br>
Process (i) (multilayer microcapsule) (figure 1):<br>
a) a concentrated aqueous microcapsule suspension containing component (A) is<br>
prepared by interfacial polymerisation in a water/oil mixture in the presence of the<br><br>
required quantity of component A, the surfactant and the necessary quantities of suitable monomers and co-monomers of the encapsulating polymer;<br>
b)	component (B) and further quantities of the surfactant and suitable monomers and co-monomers of the encapsulating polymer are added to the concentrated aqueous microcapsule suspension obtained in (a), the latter being subjected to further encapsulation.<br>
c)	the microcapsules obtained in (b) can be recovered and stored in water or in any other suitable solvent which does not dissolve the microcapsule wall, or in an emulsion/microemulsion containing further amounts of component B.<br>
Process (ii) (single layer microcapsule) (figure 2):<br>
a)	a concentrated aqueous suspension of microcapsules containing components (A) and (B) is prepared by interfacial polymerisation in a water/oil mixture in the presence of the required quantities of components (A) and B, the surfactant and the necessary quantities of suitable monomers and co-monomers of the encapsulating polymer<br>
b)	the emulsioned/microemulsioned component (B) (in such a quantity that at least 50% of the total (B) present in the final formulation is contained in the emulsion/microemulsion) and other additives useful for the specific application are added to the concentrated aqueous suspension of microcapsules obtained in (a), to obtain the formulative composition of figure 2, ready for use.<br>
The presence of encapsulated component (B) can have various functions useful for the application: for example modulating even more precisely the release time of component A, for the same encapsulating membrane; sensitising damaging species which may have resisted initial contact with component B; possibility of using two different synergists when considered necessary.<br>
Possible further components of said formulations, as previously indicated, can be mixed as solids or as emulsion/microemulsions immediately prior to use. A further aspect of the invention is the use of said formulations as insecticides, acaricides, fungicides, snailcides or vermicides in agriculture, for veterinary medicine use, for eradicating household insects and for the protection of manufactured articles. The formation of a formulation, characterised by the presence of two components, one  of which   (A)  possesses  insecticidal,  acaricidal,  fungicidal,  snailcidal  or<br><br>
vermicidal activity and the other (B) exhibits synergistic activity with the first by<br>
enhancing its effectiveness, and in which the average release time of component (A)<br>
p</a><a is delayed by a time interval at="[ICAJ-RBJ" of between and hours preferably></a>
between 2 and 10 hours, relative to the average release time of component (B) [t(B)],<br>
has surprisingly resulted in a significant increase in composition effectiveness<br>
compared to mixtures of the two components used as such or microencapsulated<br>
individually or microencapsulated jointly but with the same release time. By means of<br>
the invention an enhanced interaction between the active principle and the synergistic<br>
compound is achieved; in comparative trials performed by the inventors, said<br>
enhancement was always found to be greater than 50%; the effect is therefore of<br>
great importance.<br>
Enhancement of activity leads to various advantages of industrial significance: for<br>
example for the same active substance used, compositions with higher activity can<br>
be obtained; or compositions with an effectiveness equal to known compositions can<br>
be obtained but with reduced active substance use; the lesser amount of active<br>
substance used leads to lowed product cost, lower environmental impact of the<br>
manufacturing process, and lower volume/weight ratio of the final composition, with<br>
further practical advantages for the operator concerned with the procedures for using<br>
these formulations.<br>
Consequently with the present invention insecticide, acaricide, fungicide, snailcide or<br>
vermicide formulations are unexpectedly obtained which are highly effective and less<br>
costly than known formulations.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention without however in any way limiting it.<br>

Example 12<br>
Evaluation of release time from polyurea microcapsules at room temperature<br>
The evaluation of release time for active principle and PBO from polyurea<br>
microcapsules is performed as follows:<br>
The formulation containing active principle and PBO encapsulated together in PU<br>
and microemulsified PBO is diluted at a temperature of about 20°C with distilled<br>
water, so as to obtain a dilution of agronomic type (e.g. 20 g active principle /1000 I<br>
water).<br>
The suspension is homogenised under stirring, and a 100 ml sample thereof is<br>
withdrawn; the sample, maintained homogenised by stirring, is split into four 25 ml<br>
aliquots. Three aliquots are simultanously transferred onto three glass plates, and<br>
kept at ambient conditions, respectively for 1,2,6 hrs.<br>
At the end of each exposure time, the corresponding glass plate is washed with a<br>
fixed amount of n-hexane (which dissolves both active principle and PBO, but not the<br>
polymeric wall). The organic phase, containing all released active principle and PBO,<br>
is then analysed by HPLC, thereby assessing the amount of release at the given time<br><br>
point. The fourth aliquot, used to determine the release at time zero, is directly added with n-hexane;the organic phase, containing all PBO (and possible active ingredient) being immediately available form the formulation, is separated and assayed as above by HPLC, to determine the amounts of the two components. The obtained release data are as follows:<br><br><br>
Entomol. Res. 85,181-187,1995.<br>
Cotton plants possypium hirsutum L.) were grown without any exposure to the<br>
insecticides. The leaves were cut up into disc shapes and immersed in an aqueous<br>
solution of insecticide containing 0.01 % of Agral then left to dry at 25°C.<br>
Control leaves were immersed in Agral and distilled water only.<br>
About 20 adult insects were placed onto the small discs of treated cotton leaf.<br>
The insects were allowed to feed and maximum mortality was evaluated at 24 and 48<br>
hours.<br>
By using the formulations prepared in example 1 the results given in table 1 were<br>
obtained.<br>
LC50% a.i. (= active ingredient) and LC99% a.i. indicate the quantity of insecticide<br>
able to achieve mortality for 50% and 99% of the insects tested.<br>
As a comparison, the data obtained with commercial bifenthrin in the absence of the<br>
synergistic compound (PBO) and the data obtained with commercial bifenthrin in a<br>
mixture with the same quantity of PBO present in the formulation product of example<br>
1 are given in the same table.<br>
The data demonstrate that the formulation of example 1 is much more effective.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
