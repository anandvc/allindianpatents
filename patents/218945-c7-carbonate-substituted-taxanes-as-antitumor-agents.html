BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to novel taxanes which have exceptional utility as antitumor agents.<br>
The taxane family of terpenes, of which baccatin III and taxol are members, has been the subject of considerable interest in both the biological and chemical arts. Taxol itself is employed as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent and possesses a broad range of tumor-inhibiting activity. Taxoi has a 2'R, 3'S configuration and the following structural fomula:<br><br>
wherein Ac is acetyl<br>
Colin et al. reported In U.S. Patent 4,814,470 that certain taxol analogs have an activity significantly greater than that of taxoi. One of these analogs, commonly refered to as docetaxei, has the following structural formula:<br><br>
Although taxol and docetaxei are useful chemotherapeutic agents, there are limitations on their effectiveness, including limited efficacy against certain types of cancers and toxicity to subjects when administered at various doses. Accondingly, a need remains for additional chemotherapeutic agents with improved efficacy and less toxicity.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Among the objects of the present invention, therefore, is the provision of taxanes which compare favorably to taxol and docetaxel with respect to efficacy as anti-tumor agents and with respect to toxicity. In general, these taxanes possess a carbonate substituent at C-7, a hydroxy substituent at C-10, and a range of 0(2). 0(9), 0(14), and 0(13) side chain substituents.<br>
Briefly, therefore, the present invention is directed to the taxane composition, per se, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the taxane and a pharmaceutically acceptable earner, and to methods of administration.<br>

Taxanes having the genera) fonmula 1 may be obtained by treatment of a p-lactam with an aikoxide having the taxane tetracyclic nucleus and a C-13 metallic oxide substituent to form compounds having a ^-amido ester substituent at C-13 (as described more fully in Holton U.S. Patent 5,466,834), followed by removal of the hydroxy protecting groups. The P-lactam has the following structural formula {3);<br><br>
wherein Pg is a hydroxy protecting group and Xj and X5 arenas previously defined and the aikoxide has the staictural formula (4):<br><br>
wherein M is a metal or ammonium, P^Q is a hydroxy prcitecting group and R2, R^, R7 and Ri4 are as previously defined.<br>
Aikoxide 4 may be prepared from 10-deacetylbaccatin III (or a derivative thereof) by selective protection of the C-10 hydroxyl group and then acylation of the C-7 hydroxy! group followed by treatment with a metallic amide. In one embodiment of the present invention, the C(10) hydroxyl group of 10-deacetylbaccatin III is selectively protected with a silyl group using, for example, a silylamide or bissilyamlde as a siiylating agent. Prefen"ed silylating agents include tri(hydrocarbyl)silyl-trifiuoromethylacetamides and bis tri(hydrocarbyl&gt;<br><br>
sily!trtfiuorDmethyiacetamides (with the hydracarijyl moiety being substituted or unsubstituted alky( or aryt) such as N,0-bis-(trimethyisiiy[) trifluoroacetamide, N,0-bis-{triethylsily!)trifiuoroacetamide, N-methyl-N-triethyisiiyltrifluoroacetamide, and N,0-bis(t-butyldimethylsilyl)tnf)uoroacetamide. The sifylating agents may be used either aione or in combination with a catalytic amount of a base such as an alkali metal base. Alkali metal amides, such as lithium amide'catalysts, in general, and lithium hexamethyldisiiazide, in particular, are preferred. The solvent for the selective silylation reaction is preferably an ethereal solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. Alternatively, however, other solvents such as ether or dimettioxyethane may be used. The temperature at which the C(10) selective silylation is carried out is not narrowly critical. In general, however, it is canied out at 0 X or greater.<br>
Selective acylation of the C(7) hydroxyl group of a C(10) protected taxane to form a C(7) carbonate can be achieved using any of a variety of common acylating agents such as a haioformates. In general, acylation of the C(7) hydroxy group of a C(10) protected taxane are more efficient and more selective than are C(7) acylations of a 7,10-dihydroxy taxane such as 10-DAB; stated another way, once the C(10) hydroxy! group has been protected, there is a significant difference in the reactivity of the remaining C(7), C(13), and C(1) hydroxy! groups. These acylation reactions may optionally be carried out in the presence or absence of an amine base.<br>

Processes for the preparation and resolution of the (3-lactam starting material are generally well known. For example, the (3-lactam may be prepared as described in Holton, U.S. Patent No. 5,430,160 and tiie resulting enatiomeric mixtures of p-lactams may be resolved by a stereoselective hydrolysis using a lipase or enzyme as described, for example, in Patel, U.S. Patent No. 5,879,929 Patel U.S. Patent No. 5,567,614 or a liver homogenate as described, for example.<br><br>
in PCT Patent Application No. 00/41204. In a prefen-ed embodiment in which the p-]actam is ftjryl substituted at the C(4) position, the p-lactam can be prepared as illustrated In the following reaction scheme:<br><br>
wherein Ac is acetyl, NEtj is triethyiamine, CAN is eerie ammonium nitrate, and p-TsOH is p-toluenesulfonic acid. The beef liver resolution may be carried out, for example, by combining the enatiomeric P-lactam mixture with a beef liver suspension (prepared, for example, by adding 20 g of frozen beef liver to a blender and then adding a pH 8 buffer to make a total volume of 1 L).<br>

WhiJe not being bound to a particular theory, it is believed that the ethanol solubility of the antitumor compound may be directly related to its efficacy. The antitumor compound can also be capable of being crystallized from a solution.

However, the dosage may vary depending on the dosing schedule which can be adjusted as necessary to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. It should be noted that the ranges of effective doses provided herein are not intended to limit the invention and represent preferred dose ranges. The most preferred dosage will be tailored to ^e individual subject, as is understood and determinable by one of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation.<br>

Example 5 in Vitro cytotoxicity measured by the cell colony formation assay<br>
Four hundred ceils (HCT116) were plated in 60 mm Petri dishes containing 2.7 mL of medium {modified McCoy's 5a medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/mL penicillin and 100 g/mL streptomycin). The ceils were Incubated in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 5 h for attachment to the bottom of Petri dishes.   The compounds identified In Example 2 were made up fresh in medium at ten times the final concentration, and then 0.3 mL of this stock solution was added to the 2.7 mL of medium in the dish. The ceils were then incubated with drugs for 72 h ai 37 " C. At the end of Incubation the dnjg-containing media were decanted, the dishes were rinsed with 4 mL of Hank's Balance Salt Solution (HBSS), 5 mL of fresh medium was added, and the dishes were returned to the incubator for coiony formation. The ceil colonies were counted using a colony counter after Incubation for 7 days.
