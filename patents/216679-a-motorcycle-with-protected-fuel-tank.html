				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a motorcycle with a protected fuel tank.<br>
4<br>
In the known motorcycle, the fuel tank is mounted between the handle bar and the rider"s seat, on the top of the vehicle main frame.<br>
The  location of the fuel tank, which is open  to sky and, therefore, to exposure to direct sunlight, has  the following drawbacks:<br>
*	The fuel in the tank evaporates quicker due to heating up of the tank in the sun, resulting in wastage of fuel.<br>
*	The fuel tank is likely to be damaged whenever  the motorcycle falls down, especially, on its side.<br>
This invention therefore proposes a motorcycle which minimises the above mentioned drawbacks.<br>
Various other features of the motorcycle proposed herein will be discernible from the following further description thereof.<br><br>
In the motor cycle with  a  protected  fuel-  tanK according to this invention, the tank is  fixed to the space  frame of the vehicle and disposed beneath  protective member also fixed to the space frame, .said member being  located between the handle bar of  the vehicle  and  the rider"s  seat and  being  of, a predetermined  size and shape so as to extend over  and around the fuel tank; and an inlet for the fuel  tank, with a cap for opening and closing the inlet.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference  to the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, and not by way of limitation, three of possible embodiments of the motorcycle proposed herein,<br>
Fig. 1 illustrating a view of one such embodiment<br>
Fig. 2 illustrating an orthographic view of the  view in Fig. 1<br>
Fig.  3  illustrating a view of another embodiment  of this invention<br><br>
Fig.4  illustrating a view of yet another embodiment of this invention.<br>
A   protective  member  3 is fixed to the  space  frame tubes  2A and 2B of the space frame of the  motorcycle. The  member  3 is located between the handlebar of     the vehicle and the rider"s seat s.<br>
The member 3 will take any predetermined size and shape so as to extend over and around the fuel tank 1, whereby adeguate protection is given to the said tank from the sun and also from the conseguences of any fall of the motorcycle, especially, on its side. The member 3 in its various forms will be sturdy enough to withstand falls and will also, preferably, be of a heat insulating material so that the heat from the sun does not pass through the member and affect the fuel tank 1.<br>
One of the forms the member 3 can take will  have a utilitarian value,  namely, as a  storage compartment<br><br>
provided with a hinged lid 3A, the location of the hinge being indicated by 3B so that the lid 3A can be opened away from the rider to provide access to the interior of the compartment 3.<br>
The  hinge  can alternatively be provided  at  either side  of the lid at the location 3D or 3E so  that  the lid  can be opened sidewards; however, it it  preferred to  have  the hinge at the location 3B, since  this  is convenient  in operation and use. The compartment  and lid will be provided with a lock for security purposes.<br>
The fuel tank 1 is disposed beneath the  member   3. The tank 1 is also fixed to the tubes 2A and 2B of  the space  frame. The fuel tank is provided with  a  fuel inlet 1B and  cap lA.<br>
The interior of the compartment 3 is, optionally, provided with a plurality of sub-compartments for storing different articles, apart from a crash-helmet, therein, such as, a tool-kit, articles of personal use.<br>
According to one construction, the member and  the<br><br>
tank are irremovably fixed to the space frame.<br>
According to another, alternative, construction, the member and the tank are detachably fixed  to  the space frame. This provision facilitates removal of  the member  and tank, whenever necessary, as for  instance, for   cleaning  the  member  and  tank,  and   for replacing  the member  and tank in position on  the space frame.<br>
According to one construction,  the fuel inlet and  cap are disposed on the top of the fuel tank, as illustrated for example in Figs. 2 and 3<br>
According  to another construction, the fuel inlet  and cap are disposed at the side of the fuel tank Fig.4<br>
According to yet another construction, the fuel  inlet and cap are provided with a cover 3C, adjacent the  lid (Fig. 3). In such event, preferably, the surfaces  of the lid 3A and the cover 3C are in alignment to provide a smooth, continuous contour for the said surfaces. The cover  3C  protects the fuel inlet IB and cap  lA - from<br><br>
dust and grime. The cover C will be hinged to "enable the same to be opened and closed over the inlet Cap lA.<br>
The term "motorcycle" used in this specification not only means a motorcycle properly so called but.also a motorcycle behind or around the front portion of which a body is built to run on three or more wheels as, for instance, a vehicle in which the front portion of a motorcycle is provided while the rest of such vehicle accommodates seating arrangement for passengers.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention to exclude any equivalents of the features illustrated and described but it is understood that various other embodiments of the motorcycle proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this Invention,<br><br><br>
