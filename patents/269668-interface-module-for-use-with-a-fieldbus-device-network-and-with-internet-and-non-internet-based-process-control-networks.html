				<td>INTERFACE MODULE FOR USE WITH A FIELDBUS DEVICE NETWORK<br>
AND WITH INTERNET AND NON-INTERNET BASED PROCESS<br>
CONTROL NETWORKS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates generally to process-control systems<br>
and, more particularly, to an interface module for exchanging data between a Fieldbus<br>
device network and Internet and non-Internet based process control networks.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
[0002] Process control systems, like those used in chemical, petroleum or<br>
other processes, typically include at least one centralized process controller<br>
communicatively coupled to at least one host or operator workstation and to one or<br>
more field devices via analog and/or digital buses or other communication lines or<br>
channels. The field devices, which may be, for example, valves, valve positioners,<br>
switches, transmitters (e.g., temperature, pressure and flow rate sensors), etc. perform<br>
functions within the process such as opening or closing valves and measuring process<br>
parameters. The process controller receives signals indicative of process<br>
measurements made by the field devices and/or other information pertaining to the<br>
field devices via an input/output (I/O) device, uses this information to implement a<br>
control routine and then generates Control signals which are sent over the buses or<br>
other communication channels via the input/output device to the Field devkes to<br>
control the operation of the process. Information from the "field devices and the<br>
controller is typically made available to one or more applications executed by the<br>
operator workstation to enable an operator to perform any desired function with<br>
respect to the process, such as viewing the current state of the process, modifying the<br>
operation of the process, configuring the process, documenting the process, etc.<br>
[0003] In the past decade or so, smart field devices including a<br>
microprocessor and a memory have become prevalent in the process control industry.<br>
In addition to performing a primary Junction within the process, smart field devices<br>
may store data pertaining to the device, communicate with the controller and/or other<br>
devices in a digital or combined digital and analog format, and perform secondary<br>
tasks such as self-calibration, identification, diagnostics, etc. A number of standard<br>
and open smart device communication protocols such as the HART®, PROFIBUS®,<br>
Actuator Sensor Interface (hereinafter "AS-Interface" or "ASI"), WORLDFIP®,<br>
Device-Net®, CAN, and FOUNDATION™ Fieldbus (hereinafter "Fieldbus") protocols,<br>
and have been developed to enable smart field devices made by different<br>
manufacturers to be used together within the same process control network. These<br>
process control networks may be implemented using Internet-based protocols, such as<br>
FOUNDATION™ Fieldbus over High Speed Internet, Modbus TCP, ProfiNet and OPC,<br>
and non-Internet based protocols, such as Modbus, Profibus DP, DeviceNet, HART®,<br>
CANOpen, and the like.<br>
[0004] One such standard communication protocol for smart field devices is<br>
the Profibus DP protocol. The Profibus DP protocol defines a message structure that<br>
controllers will recognize and use regardless of the types of networks over which they<br>
communicate. It establishes a common format for the layout and content of message<br>
fields. Profibus DP defines a process for the controllers to request access to other<br>
devices, for the controllers and devices to respond to requests, and for error detection<br>
and reporting. During communications on a Profibus DP network, the protocol<br>
determines how each controller or device will know its device address, recognize a<br>
message addressed to it, determine the kind of action to be taken based on a service<br>
code contained in the message, and extract any data or other information contained in<br>
the message. If a reply is required, the slave device will construct the reply message<br>
and send it to the master device using the Profibus DP protocol. The Profibus DP<br>
protocol is known in the art and is described in detail in numerous articles, brochures<br>
and specifications published, distributed and available from, among others,<br>
manufacturers of devices using the Profibus DP protocol. As a result, the details of<br>
the Profibus DP communication protocol will not be described in detail except to the<br>
extent they relate to the present invention.<br>
[0005] Profibus DP employs a master-slave query-response cycle for<br>
exchanging information between controllers and field devices. Each device is<br>
assigned an address ranging between 0 and 125. One device, the master, initiates<br>
transactions, such as queries, set point changes, diagnostics, and the like, by<br>
transmitting a message addressed to another device, the slave. Under the Profibus DP<br>
protocol, the message transmitted by the master is formatted to include the device<br>
address of the slave device, a service code defining the requested action, any data to<br>
be sent to the slave device, and error-checking information. The slave device detects<br>
and receives the message from the master based on the address in the message, and<br>
processes the transaction or service indicated by the service code in the message.<br>
After processing the transaction or performing the requested service, the slave<br>
transmits a response message constructed using the Profibus DP protocol and<br>
containing information confirming the action taken, any data to be returned to the<br>
master, and error-checking information. In addition to individual messages, the<br>
master may send messages to a defined group of slave devices (multi-cast messages),<br>
or may broadcast a message to all connected slaves. The master transmits broadcast<br>
and multi-cast messages as global control messages to the slaves using address 127<br>
and, in the case of multi-cast messages, an optional group number for a targeted group<br>
of slave devices. While the slaves respond to messages addressed to them<br>
individually, the slaves do not respond to broadcast or multi-cast messages from the<br>
master device.<br>
[0006] Data is exchanged between devices in the Profibus DP network<br>
using service access points. Each Profibus DP device has a profile including the<br>
specified set of process control parameters associated with device, and each process<br>
control parameter used in the Profibus DP network is assigned a corresponding<br>
service access point from a range of available service access points. The devices in<br>
the Profibus DP network are configured to store and exchange the process control<br>
parameters according to their assigned service access points. In order to obtain the<br>
value of a process control parameter from a slave device, a master device formats and<br>
transmits a request message including the address of the slave device and the service<br>
access point for the process control parameter. Upon receiving the request message,<br>
the slave device reads the current value for the service access point, and formats and<br>
transfers a response message with the service access point and its stored value.<br>
Another example of a non-Internet based protocol is the Modbus protocol, which is<br>
described more fully in co-pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/354,525<br>
filed on January 30, 2003 from which the present application-claims priority and the<br>
specification of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
|0007] Generally speaking, the Fieldbus protocol is an all-digital, serial,<br>
two-way communication protocol that provides a standardized physical -interface to a<br>
two-wire loop or bus that interconnects field devices. The Fieldbus protocol provides,<br>
in effect, a local area network for field devices within a process, which enables these<br>
field devices to perform process control functions (using function blocks) at locations<br>
distributed throughout a process facility and to communicate with one another before<br>
and after the performance of these process control functions to implement an overall<br>
control strategy. The Fieldbus protocol is known in the art and is described in detail<br>
in numerous articles, brochures and specifications published, distributed, and<br>
available from, among others, the Fieldbus Foundation, a not-for-profit organization<br>
headquartered in Austin, Texas. As a result, the details of the Fieldbus<br>
communication protocol will not be described in detail herein except to the extent<br>
they relate to the present invention.<br>
[0008] A Fieldbus process control network may include one or more<br>
interconnected Fieldbus segments, with each segment having one or more field<br>
devices, linked together via a bus. For communication to occur, one of the devices on<br>
each segment of the bus operates as a link active scheduler (LAS) that actively<br>
schedules and controls communication on the associated segment of the bus. The<br>
LAS for each segment of the bus stores and updates a communication schedule (a link<br>
active schedule) containing the times that each function block of «ach device is<br>
scheduled to start periodic communication activity on the bus and the length of time<br>
for which this communication activity is to occur. The LAS also controls<br>
asynchronous communication activities that may occur when no synchronous<br>
communication is taking place on the bus segment. During the time that synchronous<br>
communication is not occurring, each field device is allowed, in rum upon receipt of a<br>
pass token message from the LAS, to transmit alarm data, view data, etc. in an<br>
asynchronous manner.<br>
[0009] Under the Fieldbus protocol, field devices are able to communicate<br>
with each other over a bus using unique addresses that are assigned to each field<br>
device. The field devices are attached to nodes of the bus, and each node has a<br>
designated physical address that identifies the field device attached thereto for use in<br>
communicating with the other field devices in the process control network. The<br>
unique address for the field device is included in the messages published by the<br>
device on the bus. The field device or devices to which the messages are published<br>
are configured to listen to the bus segment to which it is connected for messages<br>
containing the address of the publishing field device. When the subscribing field<br>
devices detect messages with the address of the publishing field device, they decode<br>
and process the messages as necessary to effect process control.<br>
[0010] Field devices are able to publish or transmit data and messages over<br>
the bus using one of three types of virtual communication relationships (VCRs)<br>
defined in each field device. A client/server VCR is used for queued, unscheduled,<br>
user initiated, one-to-one, communications between devices on the bus. A field<br>
device may use a client/server VCR when it receives a pass token message from an<br>
LAS to send a request message to another device on the bus. The requester is called<br>
the "client" and the device that receives the request is called the "server." The server<br>
sends a response when it receives a pass token message from the LAS and processes<br>
the client's request. The client/server VCR is used, for example, to effect operator<br>
initiated requests such as set point changes, tuning parameter access and changes,<br>
alarm acknowledgments, and device uploads and downloads.<br>
[0011] A report distribution VCR is used for queued, unscheduled, user<br>
initiated, one-to-many communications. For example, when a field device with an<br>
event or a trend report receives a pass token from an LAS, that field device sends its<br>
message to a "group address" defined in the device. Devices that are configured to<br>
listen on that VCR will receive the report. The report distribution VCR type is<br>
typically used by Fieldbus devices to send alarm notifications to operator consoles.<br>
[0012] Finally, a publisher/subscriber VCR type is used for buffered, oneto-<br>
many communications. Buffered communications are ones that store and send<br>
only the latest version of the data and, thus, new data completely overwrites previous<br>
data. Function block outputs, for example, comprise buffered data. A "publisher"<br>
field device publishes or broadcasts a message using the publisher/subscriber VCR<br>
type to all of the "subscriber" field devices on the bus when the publisher device<br>
receives a compel data message from the LAS or from a subscriber device. The<br>
publisher/subscriber relationships are predetermined and are defined and stored within<br>
each field device. Like Profibus DP and Fieldbus, other protocols provide<br>
communication strategies to allow smart field devices to exchange information and<br>
implement process control strategies.<br>
 [0013] As previously indicated, non-Internet based protocols, such as the<br>
Profibus DP, Modbus and Fieldbus protocols, and Internet-based protocols have been<br>
in use in process control systems for the last decade or so. As a result, conditions may<br>
arise wherein process control networks using the Fieldbus protocol may co-exist with<br>
process control networks using other protocols in the same plant or facility. For<br>
example, an installation having an incumbent process control system operating under<br>
the Profibus DP protocol may convert a portion of the process control network to<br>
operate under the Fieldbus protocol in order to implement a particular control strategy<br>
or capability that is supportable by the Fieldbus protocol. However, despite the<br>
partial conversion, the Profibus DP portion of the process control network may still<br>
require information and data from the Fieldbus portion of the process control network.<br>
As a further example, a plant or facility with an existing process control network<br>
operating under the Profibus DP protocol may be expanded to include additional<br>
processes having process control networks operating under the Fieldbus protocol, or<br>
vice versa. Moreover, the facility may include other processes having process control<br>
networks operating under Internet-based protocols. As with the previous example, it<br>
may be necessary to communicate data and information between the Fieldbus<br>
network, the Profibus DP network and the Internet-based network. In current<br>
implementations, data cannot be communicated between these divergent process<br>
control networks. Therefore, a need exists for an interface module that may be<br>
connected between process control networks using differing communication protocols<br>
to allow information and data from the various networks to be communicated between<br>
the devices in the networks.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014] An interface module is operatively connected to a Fieldbus process<br>
control network and to at least one non-Fieldbus process control network to facilitate<br>
the exchange of process control information between the networks. The interface<br>
module stores a database in which the process control parameters of the function<br>
blocks in the field devices of the Fieldbus process control network are mapped to<br>
corresponding process control parameters of the non-Fieldbus process control<br>
network. Once the Fieldbus process control parameters are mapped to the non-<br>
Fieldbus process control parameters, the interface module is adapted to transmit<br>
request messages on the Fieldbus process control network to the Fieldbus field<br>
devices for the current values of the process control parameters, receive response<br>
messages from the interface module containing the current values of the process<br>
control parameters from the Fieldbus field devices, and store the current values of the<br>
process control parameters in the service access point database. The interface module<br>
may also function in the other direction to map non-Fieldbus process control<br>
parameters to corresponding Fieldbus process control parameters.<br>
[0015] Field devices in the non-Fieldbus process control network may<br>
obtain the values of the Fieldbus process control parameters by transmitting request<br>
messages to the interface module for the current values of the non-Fieldbus process<br>
control parameters to which the Fieldbus process control parameters have been<br>
mapped. Upon receiving the requests, the interface module reads the database «ntry<br>
corresponding to the non-Fieldbus process control parameter to obtain the value of the<br>
Fieldbus process control parameter. The interface module formats and transmits a<br>
response to the requesting non-Fieldbus field device containing the non-Fieldbus<br>
process control parameter and value of the corresponding Fieldbus process control<br>
parameter from the database. In order to configure the database to associate the<br>
Fieldbus process control parameters with the non-Fieldbus process control<br>
parameters, the interface module may include an Internet connection to which a user<br>
interface, such as a personal computer, may be connected. Web server software in the<br>
interface module and web browser software at the user interface may be used to<br>
provide a graphical interface for the service access point database configuration<br>
process.<br>
[0016] In one aspect, the invention is directed to an interface module for use<br>
in a process control system including a Fieldbus process control network having a<br>
plurality of Fieldbus field devices and at least a first non-Fieldbus process control<br>
network having a plurality of non-Fieldbus field devices. The interface module may<br>
operatively connect the Fieldbus process control network to the first non-Fieldbus<br>
process control network and may be adapted to facilitate the exchange of process<br>
control information between the Fieldbus process control network and the first non-<br>
Fieldbus process control network. The interface module may include a Fieldbus I/O<br>
module operatively connected to the Fieldbus process control network and adapted to<br>
transmit and receive Fieldbus protocol messages on the Fieldbus process control<br>
network, a first non-Fieldbus I/O module operatively connected to the first non-<br>
Fieldbus process control network and adapted to transmit and receive messages<br>
communicated using a protocol other than the Fieldbus protocol on the first non-<br>
Fieldbus process control network, and a controller operatively connected to the<br>
Fieldbus I/O module and the first non-Fieldbus I/O module, and including a processor<br>
and a memory operatively connected to the processor. The controller may be<br>
programmed to cause the Fieldbus I/O module to transmit messages to and receive<br>
messages from Fieldbus field devices on the Fieldbus process control network, and to<br>
cause the first non-Fieldbus I/O module to transmit messages to and receive messages<br>
from non-Fieldbus field devices on the first non-Fieldbus process control network.<br>
10017] In another aspect, the invention is directed to a method of<br>
exchanging process control information between a Fieldbus process control network<br>
having a plurality of Fieldbus field devices and a non-Fieldbus process control<br>
network having a plurality of non-Fieldbus field devices. The method may include<br>
operatively connecting an interface module to the Fieldbus process control network<br>
and to the non-Fieldbus process control network. The interface module may be<br>
configured to transmit and receive Fieldbus protocol messages on the Fieldbus<br>
process control network and to transmit and receive non-Fieldbus protocol messages<br>
on the non-Fieldbus process control network. The method may also include storing in<br>
the interface module a database wherein at least one process control parameter of one<br>
of the process control networks is associated with a process control parameter of the<br>
other of the process control networks, causing the interface module to request a<br>
current value of the at least one process control parameter from a corresponding one<br>
of the field devices in the one of the process control networks, and storing the current<br>
value of the at least one process control parameter of the one of the process control<br>
networks in the database with the associated process control parameter of the other of<br>
the process control networks. The method may further include causing the interface<br>
module to transmit a response message to one of the field devices of the other of the<br>
process control networks with the current value of the at least one process control<br>
parameter of the one of the process control networks and the process control<br>
parameter of the other of the process control networks in response to receiving a<br>
request message from the one of the field devices of the other of the process control<br>
networks at the interface module for the current value of the associated process<br>
control parameter of the other of the process control networks.<br>
[0018] In a further aspect of the invention, an interface module is provided<br>
for use in a process control system including a Fieldbus process control network<br>
having a plurality of Fieldbus field devices and a Profibus DP process control network<br>
having a plurality of Profibus DP field devices. The interface module may<br>
operatively connect the Fieldbus process control network to the Profibus DP process<br>
control network and may be adapted to facilitate the exchange of process control<br>
information between the Fieldbus process control network and the Profibus DP<br>
process control network. The interface module may include a Fieldbus I/O module<br>
operatively connected to the Fieldbus process control network and adapted to transmit<br>
and receive Fieldbus protocol messages on the Fieldbus process control network, a<br>
Profibus DP I/O module operatively connected to the Profibus DP process-control<br>
network and adapted to transmit and receive Profibus DP protocol messages on the<br>
Profibus DP process control network, and a controller operatively connected to the<br>
Fieldbus I/O module and the Profibus DP I/O module, with the controller including a<br>
processor and a memory operatively connected to the processor.<br>
[0019] The controller of the interface module may be programmed to store<br>
in the memory a service access point database wherein at least one Fieldbus process<br>
control parameter of the Fieldbus process control network is associated with a<br>
Profibus DP service access point of the Profibus DP process control network, and be<br>
programmed to cause the Fieldbus I/O module to request a current value of the at least<br>
one Fieldbus process control parameter from a corresponding one of the Fieldbus field<br>
devices. The controller may further be programmed to store the current value of the<br>
at least one Fieldbus process control parameter in the service access point database<br>
with the associated Profibus DP service access point, and may be programmed to<br>
cause the Profibus DP I/O module to transmit a response message to one of the<br>
Profibus DP field devices with the current value of the at least one Fieldbus process<br>
control parameter and the associated Profibus DP service access point in response to<br>
receiving a request message from the one of the Profibus DP field devices at the<br>
Profibus DP I/O module for the current value of the associated Profibus DP service<br>
access point.<br>
 [0020] According to another aspect of the invention, a process control<br>
system includes a Fieldbus process control network having a plurality of Fieldbus<br>
field devices, a Profibus DP process control network having a plurality of Profibus<br>
DP field devices, and an interface module operatively connecting the Fieldbus process<br>
control network to the Profibus DP process control network which may be adapted to<br>
facilitate the exchange of process control information between the Fieldbus process<br>
control network and the Profibus DP process control network. The interface module<br>
may include a Fieldbus I/O module operatively connected to the Fieldbus process<br>
control network and adapted to transmit and receive Fieldbus protocol messages on<br>
the Fieldbus process control network, a Profibus DP I/O module operatively<br>
connected to the Profibus DP process control network and adapted to transmit and<br>
receive Profibus DP protocol messages on the Profibus DP process control network,<br>
- and a controller operatively connected to the Fieldbus I/O module and the Profibus<br>
DP I/O module which may include a processor and a memory operatively connected<br>
to the processor.<br>
{0021] The controller may be programmed to store in the memory a service<br>
access point database wherein at least one Fieldbus process control parameter of the<br>
Fieldbus process control network is associated with a Profibus DP service access<br>
point of the Profibus DP process control network, and to cause the Fieldbus I/O<br>
module to request a current value of the at least one Fieldbus process control<br>
parameter from a corresponding one of the Fieldbus field devices. The controller may<br>
further be programmed to store the current value of the at least one Fieldbus process<br>
control parameter in the service access point database with the associated Profibus DP<br>
service access point, and to cause the Profibus DP I/O module to transmit a response<br>
message to one of the Profibus DP field devices with the current value of the at least<br>
one Fieldbus process control parameter and the associated Profibus DP service access<br>
point in response to receiving a request message from the one of the Profibus DP field<br>
devices at the Profibus DP I/O module for the current value of the associated Profibus<br>

|0022] According to a still further aspect of the invention, a method of<br>
exchanging process control infprmation between a Fieldbus process control network<br>
having a plurality of Fieldbus field devices and a Profibus DP process control network<br>
having a plurality of Profibus DP field devices may include the steps of operatively<br>
coupling an interface module to the Fieldbus process control network and to the<br>
Profibus DP process control network, the interface module being adapted to transmit<br>
and receive Fieldbus protocol messages on the Fieldbus process control network and<br>
to transmit and receive Profibus DP protocol messages on the Profibus DP process<br>
control network, and storing in the interface module a service access point database<br>
wherein at least one Fieldbus process control parameter of the Fieldbus process<br>
control network is associated with a Profibus DP service access point of the Profibus<br>
DP process control network. The method may further include causing the interface<br>
module to request a current value of the at least one Fieldbus process control<br>
parameter from a corresponding one of the Fieldbus field devices, and storing the<br>
current value of the at least one Fieldbus process control parameter in the service<br>
access point database with the associated Profibus DP service access point. Still<br>
further, the method may include the step of causing the interface module to transmit a<br>
response message to one of the Profibus DP field devices with the-current value of the<br>
at least one Fieldbus process control parameter and the associated Profibus DP service<br>
access point in response to receiving a request message from the one of the Profibus<br>
DP field devices at the interface module for the current value of the associated<br>
Profibus DP service access point.<br>

numerous different embodiments of the invention, it should be understood that the<br>
legal scope of the invention is defined by the words of the claims set forth at the end<br>
of a patent. The detailed description is to be construed as exemplary only and does<br>
not describe every possible embodiment of the invention since describing every<br>
possible embodiment would be impractical, if not impossible. Numerous alternative<br>
embodiments could be implemented, using either current technology or technology<br>
developed after the filing date of this provisional patent application, which would still<br>
fall within the scope of the claims defining the invention.<br>
[0029] It should also be understood that, unless a term is expressly defined<br>
in this patent using the sentence "As used herein, the term ' ' is hereby defined<br>
to mean..." or a similar sentence, there is no intent to limit the meaning of that term,<br>
either expressly or by implication, beyond its plain or ordinary meaning, and such<br>
term should not be interpreted to be limited in scope based on any statement made in<br>
any section of this patent (other than the language of the claims). To the extent that<br>
any term recited in the claims at the end of this patent is referred to in this patent in a<br>
manner consistent with a single meaning, that is done for sake of clarity only so as to<br>
not confuse the reader, and it is not intended that such claim term by limited, by<br>
implication or otherwise, to that single meaning. Finally, unless a claim element is<br>
defined by reciting the word "means" and a function without the recital of any<br>
structure, it is not intended that the scope of any claim element be interpreted based<br>

[0030] Referring now to Fig. 1, a process control system 10 may include a<br>
non-Internet based protocol process control network 12 connected to a Fieldbus<br>
process control network 14, and to an Internet-based protocol process control network<br>
17 by an interface module 16. The non-Internet based process control network 12<br>
may include a host device or controller 18 connected to a plurality of field devices 20-<br>
24 and one or more user interfaces 26. In this system, the host 18 may be used to<br>
implement process control in the non-Internet based process control network 12 and<br>
serve as a master device initiating transactions that are received by the devices 20-24<br>
and user interface 26, depending on the requirements of the process control network<br>
and non-Internet based protocol under which the network 12 may be operating. The<br>
devices 20-24 and user interface 26 may respond by supplying requested data to the<br>
host 18, or by taking action requested by the query.<br>
[0031] The Fieldbus process control network 14 may include a host or<br>
controller 28 connected to a number of other devices such as a program logic<br>
controller (PLC) 30, a number of controllers 32, another host device 34 and a set of<br>
field devices 36-66 via a two-wire Fieldbus loop or bus 68. The Fieldbus process<br>
control network 14 may include different sections or segments, 68a, 68b, 68c and-68d.<br>
Some segments, such as segment 68b, may be connected directly to the bus 68, while<br>
other segments, such as segments 68a and 68c, may be connected to the bus 68 by<br>
bridge devices 70, 74. Still further, the Fieldbus process control network 14 may<br>
include segments, such as segment 68d, connected to the Fieldbus process control<br>
network 14 by the interface module 16. Each of the sections 68a, 68b, 68c and 68d<br>
interconnects a subset of the devices to enable communications between the devices<br>
in a manner previously described. For communication to occur, one of the devices on<br>
each segment of the bus 68 operates as the link active scheduler (for example,<br>
controller 28 and devices 36, 48, 56 and 64) that actively schedules and controls<br>
communication on the associated segment of the bus 68.<br>
[0032] The non-Internet based network 12 is connected to the Fieldbus<br>
network 14 by the interface module 16. The interface module 16 is connected to the<br>
non-Internet based network 12 via an input/output (I/O) port configured to be<br>
protocol-compatible with the non-Internet based process control network 12, and to<br>
nodes on one or more of the segments 68a, 68b, 68c and 68d of the Fieldbus network<br>
14 via Fieldbus-compatible I/O ports. To facilitate communications to andlrorn the<br>
interface module 16 in the non-Internet based network 12, the interface module 16<br>
may be assigned a device address within the protocol of the network 12, and the<br>
interface module 16 may be configured so that the devices 18-26 ^an format and<br>
transmit messages for the interface module 16, and the interface module 16 can<br>
receive, identify and process the messages, perform the requested action, and transmit<br>
response messages to the devices 18-26 via the protocol-compatible I/O port using the<br>
protocol of the network 12 in the same manner as other devices 18-26 of the network<br>
12.<br>
|0033] The interface module 16 may also be configured as a link master<br>
device of the Fieldbus process control network 14 so that the interface module 16 may<br>
function as the link active scheduler for one or more of the segments of the Fieldbus<br>
process control network 14 attached thereto. Moreover, as previously discussed, the<br>
interface module 16 may also function as a bridge device to facilitate communications<br>
between a segment, such as segment 68d, that may not be connected directly to the<br>
bus 68 and/or the other segments 68a, 68b and 68c of the Fieldbus process control<br>
network 14.<br>
[0034] As with the non-Internet based network 12, the interface module 16<br>
is capable of communicating on the segments 68a, 68b, 68c and 68d of the bus 68 to<br>
which it is connected via the Fieldbus I/O ports. The interface module 16 is assigned<br>
a Fieldbus device address so that the interface module 16 is recognized by the devices<br>
36-66 on the segments 68a, 68b, 68c and 68d to which it is attached. The link master<br>
schedules in the LAS devices 36, 48, 56 and 64 are configured so that pass token<br>
messages will be transmitted to the interface module 16 during the asynchronous<br>
periods of the link master schedules. The VCRs in the devices 36-66 and at the<br>
interface module 16 are configured so that the interface module 16 may transmit<br>
messages to the field devices 36-66 requesting the values of the process control<br>
parameters for which the interface module 16 is configured to store, and the field<br>
devices 36-66 may transmit response messages to the interface module 16 containing<br>
the current values of the requested Fieldbus process control parameters.<br>
[0035] The Internet-based protocol process control network 17 may include<br>
one or more host devices or controllers 76 connected to a plurality of field devices 78-<br>
82 and one or more user interfaces 84 that may communicate using the Internet-based<br>
protocol under which the process control network 17 operates, hi the process control<br>
network 17, the host device(s) 76 and field devices 78-82 may be configured to<br>
implement a process control strategy using the Internet-based protocol associated with<br>
the process control network 17. The Internet-based process control network may also<br>
be connected to the non-Internet based process control network 12 and/or the Fieldbus<br>
process control network 14 by the interface module 16. The interface module 16 is<br>
connected to the Internet-based process control network 17 via an Internet-compatible<br>
input/output (I/O) port, which may allow the devices 76-84 of the network 17 to<br>
communicate with the interface module 16, and to exchange information with the<br>
other process control networks 12, 14 in a manner described more fully below. As<br>
with the other networks 12, 14, the interface module 16 may be assigned a device<br>
address within the protocol of the network 17 to facilitate communications to and<br>
from the interface module 16 and the Internet-based network 17. Configured in this<br>
way, the interface module 16 can receive, identify and process the messages, perform<br>
the requested action, and transmit response messages to the devices 76-84 via the<br>
Internet-compatible I/O port using the protocol of the network 17 in the same manner<br>
as other devices 76-84 of the network 17.<br>
[0036] In order to communicate with the Internet-based network 17, and to<br>
configure the interface module 16 and display data compiled therein, the interface<br>
module 16 may be programmed with web server software. Configuration of the<br>
interface module 16 may be accomplished over the Internet-compatible I/O port using<br>
the standard web browser software available in any personal computer, such as user<br>
interface 86. Web pages provided by the web server software of the interface module<br>
16 to the web browser software of the user interface 86 allow a process monitor or<br>
operator to map process control parameters of the devices 36-66 of the Fieldbus<br>
network 14 to corresponding parameters for use in the Internet and non-Internet based<br>
networks. The web pages may also allow the monitor or operator to view the current<br>
values of the process control parameters from the interfaced networks that may be<br>
mapped to corresponding parameters in one or more of the other interfaced networks<br>
and stored in the interface module 16.<br>
|0037J Referring now to Fig. 2, the interface module 16 may include a<br>
controller 90 connected to memory 92, a non-Internet based protocol-compatible I/O<br>
module 94, Fieldbus I/O modules 96-102, and Internet-compatible I/O module 104.<br>
The controller 90 may be embodied in hardware that is commercially available, such<br>
as in a 16 or 32 bit, 16 megahertz (MHZ) 80C960SA microcontroller, which is<br>
commercially available from Intel, or may be embodied in any other suitable<br>
microcontroller. The controller 90 may include a processor 106 that is<br>
communicatively coupled to a memory 108 via a bus 110. The memory 108 of the<br>
controller 90 may be random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM),<br>
such as a semi-conductor ROM, or any suitable combination thereof. Alternatively or<br>
additionally, the memory 108 may include any one of, or any suitable combination of,<br>
an electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), a one-time<br>
programmable electrically programmable read-only memory (OTP EPROM), a static<br>
random access memory (SRAM), flash or any other suitable memory element may be<br>
externally connected to the processor 106 of the controller 90. Furthermore, the<br>
memory(ies) may be embodied in other computer-readable media such as optical<br>
media, e.g., CDs, rewritable CDs, DVDs and the like, or magnetic media, e.g., floppy<br>
discs, hard drives, zip discs and the like.<br>
[0038] The non-Internet I/O module 94 connects the controller 90 to the<br>
non-Internet based protocol network 12 using, for example, an RS485 serial port, a<br>
port for an Ethernet connection, such as a standard RJ, 45/10/1 OObt connector, or any<br>
other suitable connection to the particular non-Internet based protocol network known<br>
in the art. The non-Internet I/O module 94 is configured to communicate with the<br>
host 18, field devices 20-24 .and user interface 26 using the corresponding non-<br>
Internet based protocol. For example, where the non-Internet based network 12 is a<br>
Profibus DP network, the non-Internet I/O module 94 may be configured to receive<br>
messages transmitted on the Profibus DP network 12, and to detect messages<br>
transmitted by the host 18 or other master devices containing the Profibus DP address<br>
assigned to the interface module 16. Once detected, the non-Internet I/O module 94<br>
may be capable of extracting and, if necessary, reformatting the data contained in the<br>
message and transferring the information to the controller 90 for executing the service<br>
request from the host 18. The non-Internet I/O module 94 may be further configured<br>
to receive data from the controller 90, which may be provided in response to a service<br>
request from the host 18, formatting an appropriate Profibus DP protocol message,<br>
and transmitting the message through the non-Internet I/O module 94 over the<br>
Profibus DP network 12.<br>
[0039] Those skilled in the aft will understand that the non-Internet I/O<br>
module 94 may be implemented in any appropriate manner to facilitate<br>
communications between the devices of the non-Internet based network 12 and the<br>
interface module 16 using the corresponding protocol. For example, the non-Internet<br>
I/O module 94 may be implemented as software within the interface module 16 that<br>
may be programmed to communicate between the network 12 and interface module<br>
16 using the non-Internet protocol implemented in the network 12. In such an<br>
implementation, the I/O module 94 may be programmed or reprogrammed at the<br>
interface module 16 via a download of programming instructions from an external<br>
storage device. Alternatively, the I/O module 94 may be reprogrammed and<br>
reconfigured by downloading code from the user interface 86 connected to the<br>
interface module 16 via the Internet. Still further, the interface module 16 may be<br>
preprogrammed with the software for multiple non-Internet based protocols that may<br>
be used in process control networks to which the interface module 16 may be<br>
connected. Once the protocol of the process control network 12 to which the interface<br>
module 16 is to be connected is identified, the interface module 16 may be configured<br>
to execute the software for the particular one of the available protocols to enable the<br>
non-Internet I/O module 94 to communicate with the devices 18-26 of the process<br>
control network 12 using the appropriate protocol. As a further alternative, the I/O<br>
module 94 may be modular such that the physical module for one non-Internet<br>
protocol may be disconnected and removed from the interface module 16 and<br>
replaced with another physical module configured to communicate using the<br>
appropriate protocol for the process control network 12 to which the interface module<br>
16 is to be connected.<br>
[0040] In a similar manner as the non-Internet I/O module 94, the Fieldbus<br>
I/O modules 96-102 connect the controller 90 to the Fieldbus segments 6°8a, 68b, 68c<br>
and 68d using, for example, HI I/O cards, and facilitate communications between the<br>
controller 90 and the Fieldbus field devices 36-66. One or more of the Fieldbus I/O<br>
modules 96-102 are attached to nodes of the segments 68a, t&gt;8b, 68c and 68d,<br>
respectively, and the interface module 16 is assigned a Fieldbus address to be used for<br>
communicating with the field devices 36-66 connected to the segment 68a, €8b, 68c,<br>
and 68d. The link active schedules are configured so that pass token messages for the<br>
interface module 16 are transmitted by the LAS field devices 36,48, 56 and-64 during<br>
the asynchronous communications periods of the schedules. Fieldbus I/O modules<br>
96-102 detect the pass token messages for the interface module 16, and any other<br>
messages for the interface module 16 transmitted on the segments 6Sa, 68b, 68c and<br>
68d, and transmit the information in the messages to the controller 90 for processing.<br>
When the interface module 16 communicates with the field devices 36-66 of the<br>
Fieldbus network 14, controller 90 causes the Fieldbus I/O modules 96-102 to format<br>
Fieldbus protocol messages, and to transmit the messages on the appropriate Fieldbus<br>
segment 68a, 68b, 68c or 68d.<br>
[0041] The Internet I/O module 104 may connect the interface module 16 to<br>
an Internet-based process control network, such as process control network 17, and/or<br>
to a user interface 86. The interface module 16 may be programmed with standard'<br>
web server software so that a computer with a web browser, such as the user interface<br>
86, connected thereto may be used to configure the interface module 16 and to view<br>
process control information stored therein. An Internet I/O module 104 is connected<br>
to the controller 90 and may include a port for an Ethernet connection, such as, for<br>
example, a standard RJ 45/10/1 OObT connector. Alternatively, the Internet I/O<br>
module 104 may include an appropriate port for any other type of Internet connection,<br>
and may even by configured for wireless communications capabilities for<br>
communicating with the Internet-based process control network 17 and/or the user<br>
interface 86. Depending on the particular implementation of the interface module 16,<br>
the Internet connection may be used to connect the interface module 16 directly to the<br>
user interface 86 or, alternatively, to a local area network wherein multiple networked<br>
devices with web browser software may be provided with access to the information<br>
contained in the interface module 16. Moreover, the user interface 86 may be a<br>
device within the Internet-based process control network 17. Similar as for the non-<br>
Internet I/O module 94, the interface module 16 may be programmed or<br>
reprogrammed to cause the Internet I/O module 104 to communication with the<br>
Internet process control network 17 using the associated Internet-based<br>
communications protocol.<br>
[0042] In some implementations, the interface module 16 is configured to<br>
obtain and store process control information from the Fieldbus process control<br>
network 14, and to provide the stored Fieldbus process control information to the<br>
process control networks 12, 17 upon receiving requests from the devices of the<br>
process control networks 12, 17. In order to allow devices in the process control<br>
networks 12, 17 to request the values of process control parameters used in the<br>
Fieldbus network 14, the process control parameters used in the Fieldbus network 14<br>
may be mapped to corresponding parameters or data structures in the process control<br>
networks 12, 17, with the values of the Fieldbus process -control parameters being<br>
stored at the interface module 16 in a database or databases in memory 108. Once the<br>
Fieldbus process control parameters are mapped to data structures in the process<br>
control networks 12, 17, the devices of the process control networks 12, 17 may be<br>
configured to transmit messages to the interface module 16 using the corresponding<br>
communication protocol and requesting the values of the data structures to which the<br>
Fieldbus process control parameters are mapped. Upon receiving the request<br>
messages at the interface module 16, the processor 106 of the controller 90 looks up<br>
values stored in the database in memory 108 corresponding to the data structure in the<br>
request messages, and causes the corresponding I/O module 94, 104 to format and<br>
transmit protocol-specific response messages with the data structure and<br>
corresponding Fieldbus process control parameter values. The requesting devices<br>
receive and process the response messages in the same manner as any response<br>
message transmitted by a device of the corresponding process control network 12,17.<br>
[0043] As previously discussed, Fieldbus process control parameters are<br>
mapped to corresponding data structures for the process control networks 12, 17 in<br>
databases stored in the memory 108 of the interface module 16. Yig. 3 illustrates one<br>
example of a database 120 that may be constructed at the interface module 16 and<br>
stored in the memory 108 of the controller 90 mapping Fieldbus process control<br>
parameters to Profibus DP service access points. In this example, the non-Internet<br>
based process control network 12 may be a Profibus DP process control network as<br>
known in the art. For each Fieldbus process control parameter that is mapped to a<br>
Profibus DP service access point 122, the service access point database 120 may<br>
include a segment identifier 124, a device identifier 126, a function block identifier<br>
128 and a parameter identifier 130, along with a current value 132 of the Fieldbus<br>
process control parameter. The example of Fig- 3 illustrates one implementation of<br>
the interface module 16 in accordance with the invention wherein the master devices<br>
of the Profibus DP process control network 12, such as the host 18, may be able to<br>
obtain, via the interface module 16, the output value and the output status of some or<br>
all of the function blocks of the Fieldbus process control network 14. In the service<br>
access point database 120 of Fig. 3, service access points in the range of 45,001-<br>
45,999 may be mapped to store the current output status of various Fieldbus function<br>
blocks, and service access points in the range of 47,001-47,999 may be mapped to<br>
store the output values of the various Fieldbus function blocks. For example, in the<br>
database 120 of Fig. 3, the output status of a thermal transducer TT-01-1 of device<br>
848-01 on segment 1 may be mapped to Profibus DP service access point 45,001,<br>
while the output value of the thermal transducer TT-01-1 may be mapped to Profibus<br>
DP service access point 47,001. Similarly, the output status of a pressure transducer<br>
pp-44-1 of device 3051-44 on segment 3 may be mapped to Profibus DP service<br>
access point 45,324, while the output value of the pressure transducer PP-44-1 may be<br>
mapped to service access point 47,647. Once the Fieldbus process control parameters<br>
are mapped to the Profibus DP service access points, the master devices in the<br>
Profibus DP network 12 may request the current values of Fieldbus process control<br>
parameters from the interface module 16 using the corresponding service access point<br>
122 in the manner described more fully herein.<br>
(0044] While the service access point database 100 illustrated herein maps<br>
output values and output statuses of the function blocks to Profibus DP service access<br>
points, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that any process control<br>
parameters used by the Fieldbus devices of a Fieldbus process control network may<br>
be mapped to Profibus DP service access points in a service access point database. It<br>
will be appreciated that the Fieldbus process control parameters mapped to the<br>
Profibus DP service access points may be determined by the requirements of process<br>
control system in which the interface module 16 is implemented. Moreover,<br>
parameters of the Fieldbus process control network 14 may be mapped to<br>
corresponding date structures for process control networks 12,17 connected to the I/O<br>
modules 94, 104. Also, the interface module 16 may map process control parameters<br>
for the process control networks 12, 17 to Fieldbus process control parameters, or<br>
parameters for non-Fieldbus process control networks may be mapped to parameters<br>
for other non-Fieldbus process control networks connected to the interface module 16,<br>
in order to facilitate the exchange of information as necessary to integrate the process<br>
control networks connected by the interface module 16.<br>
[0045J Returning to the Profibus DP example, in order to establish the<br>
service access point database 120, the interface module 16 must first identify the<br>
function blocks and process control parameters existing in the field devices 36-66 of<br>
the Fieldbus network 14. As previously discussed, once the interface module 16 is<br>
connected to one or more of the segments 68a, 68b, G8c and 68d of the Fieldbus<br>
network 14 via the Fieldbus I/O modules 96-102, the link active schedules of the<br>
corresponding LAS field devices 36, 48, 56 and 64 are configured to transmit pass<br>
token messages for the interface module 16 during the asynchronous period of the<br>
schedule. When the interface module 16 receives a pass token message on one of the<br>
segments 68a, 68b, 68c or 68d, the interface module 16 transmits messages on the<br>
segment to poll the corresponding field devices for information relating to their<br>
existence, the function blocks contained therein, and the process control parameters<br>
used by the function blocks. For example, when the interface module 16 is connected<br>
to segment 68a, and LAS field device 36 transmits a pass token message to the<br>
Fieldbus address of the interface module 16, the Fieldbus I/O module 96 detects the<br>
past token message and communicates to the controller 90 that the interface module<br>
16 may transmit messages on segment 68a. The controller 90 causes the Fieldbus I/O<br>
module 96 to transmit messages on the segment 68a polling the field devices 36-42<br>
for information pertaining to the function blocks and process control parameters<br>
contained therein. The field devices 36-42 respond by transmitting messages to the<br>
interface module 16 containing the requested information. The response messages are<br>
detected by the Fieldbus I/O module 96, which relays the information to the controller<br>
90. The processor 106 of the controller 90 causes the information from the field<br>
devices 36-42 to be stored in memory 108 for use in constructing the service access<br>
point database 120. Similar polling'of the field devices 44-66 of the segment 68b, 6Sc<br>
and 68d, if any, to which the interface module 16 is attached will be performed by the<br>
controller 90.<br>
[0046] Once information relating to the process control parameters of the<br>
Fieldbus network 14 has been compiled by the interface module 16, the process<br>
control parameters may be mapped to Profibus DP service access points using the<br>
web browser of the user interface 86. Information for the available process control<br>
parameters stored in the memory 108 may be transmitted from the controller 80<br>
through the Internet I/O module 104 to the to user interface 86 upon receiving a<br>
service request from the user interface 86. Once displayed, the web pages provided<br>
by the web server software of the controller 90 allow the user to view the available<br>
process control parameters and to map the process control parameters to Profibus DP<br>
service access points for use by the Profibus DP network 12. As service access points<br>
are assigned to the process control parameters, the information may be transmitted<br>
from the user interface 86 to the interface module 16 and, after the information is<br>
received at the Internet I/O module 104, the processor 106 of the controller 90 may<br>
cause the service access points to be stored in the service access point database 120 in<br>
entries corresponding to the associated process control parameters.<br>
[0047] In an alternative embodiment, the Fieldbus process control<br>
parameters may be mapped to the Profibus DP service access points at the user<br>
interface 86 using software other than a web browser. The mapping may be<br>
performed using commercially available software applications such as, for example,<br>
the Microsoft® Excel spreadsheet program, or custom developed software<br>
applications. The software application may issue a request for information for the<br>
available process control parameters stored in the memory 108 via the Ethernet<br>
connection between the user interface 86 and the interface module 16. The processor<br>
106 of the controller 90 may respond by retrieving the requested information stored in<br>
the memory 108 and causing the Internet I/O module 104 to transmit the retrieved<br>
information to the user interface 86 via the Internet connection. Once the information<br>
is received by the user interface 86 and displayed by the software application, the<br>
software application allows the user to view the information relating to the available<br>
process control parameters, and to manipulate the information to map the process<br>
control parameters to Profibus DP service access points for use by the Profibus DP<br>
network 12. As service access points are assigned to the process control parameters<br>
using the software application, the updated information may be transmitted from the<br>
user interface 86 to the interface module 16 and, after the information is received at<br>
the Internet I/O module 104, the processor 106 of the controller 90 may cause the<br>
service access points to be stored in the service access point database 120 in entries<br>
corresponding to the associated process control parameters.<br>
[0048J In addition to an operator manually mapping the Profibus DP service<br>
access points to the Fieldbus process control parameters using the web browser at the<br>
user interface 86, the interface module 16 may include an automatic mapping mode<br>
whereby the controller 90 of the interface module 16 automatically assigns service<br>
access points to the process control variables at the field devices 36-66. The<br>
automatic mapping may assign service access points randomly or sequentially without<br>
regard to the type of parameter being mapped or, alternatively, pre-determined ranges<br>
of service access points may be designated for various types of parameters that may<br>
be used in the Fieldbus network 14.<br>
[0049) Once the process control parameters of the Fieldbus network 14 are<br>
mapped to the service access points of the Profibus DP network 12, th« host 18 and<br>
other master devices are configured to issue service requests to the interface module<br>
16 for the values of Profibus DP service access points to which the process control<br>
parameters of the Fieldbus network 14 have been mapped. The configuration of the<br>
Profibus DP devices may be performed manually by an operator at a particular<br>
Profibus DP master device. Alternatively, the configuration process may be -semiautomated<br>
by having the processor 106 of the controller 90 cause the non-Internet I/O<br>
module 94 to transmit messages to the master devices,of the Profibus DP network 12<br>
that contain the service access points that have been mapped to Fieldbus process<br>
control parameters. The data contained in these messages may be used by the<br>
operator to configure the Profibus DP master devices to issue service -request<br>
messages to the interface module 16 to retrieve the values associated with the mapped<br>
service access points.<br>
[0050] The service request messages issued by the Profibus DP master<br>
devices include the Profibus DP device address for the interface module 16, a service<br>
code requesting the interface module 16 to read the value of a service access point or<br>
service access points, and the service access point or numbers to be read by the<br>
interface module 16. The request messages are received at the non-Internet I/O<br>
module 94, which decodes the request message and communicates the requests to the<br>
controller 90. Upon receiving the request, the processor 106 of the controller 90 reads<br>
the service access point database 120 stored in the memory 108 to retrieve the values<br>
of the process control parameters corresponding to the service access point or<br>
numbers requested by the Profibus DP master devices. Once the value or values have<br>
been retrieved, the processor 106 causes the non-Internet I/O module 94 to format and<br>
transmit a Profibus DP response message or messages containing the values stored in<br>
the service access point database 120 to the requesting master device or devices.<br>
[0051] In order to insure that the service access point database 120 includes<br>
current values of the Fieldbus process control parameters stored therein, the processor<br>
106 of the controller 90 may cause the Fieldbus I/O modules 96-102 to transmit<br>
Fieldbus request messages to the field devices 36-66. Upon receiving pass token<br>
messages on the corresponding segment 68a, 68b, 68c and 68d, the Fieldbus I/O<br>
modules 96-102 may transmit messages to each of the field devices 36-66 for which<br>
at least one process control parameter has been mapped to a Profibus DP service<br>
access point. These messages may be transmitted each time a pass token message is<br>
received, or may be transmitted less frequently depending on the type of process<br>
control parameter or field device, or on the message transmission volume limitations<br>
of the Fieldbus network 14. Alternatively, upon receiving a request from a Profibus<br>
DP master device for the current value of a Profibus DP service access point, the<br>
controller 90 may be configured to cause the corresponding one of the Fieldbus I/O<br>
modules 96-102 to transmit a request to the appropriate one of the field devices 36-66<br>
for the current value of the process control parameter. Once the one of the field<br>
devices 36-66 responds with the requested process control parameter value, the<br>
processor 106 may update the service access point database 120 with the new value<br>
and cause the non-Internet I/O module 94 to transmit the appropriate response<br>
message to the requesting Profibus DP master device.<br>
[0052J As previously stated, the illustrated Fieldbus-to-Profibus DP<br>
mapping is exemplary only. The interface module 16 may further be configured to<br>
map service access points of the Profibus DP network 12 to Fieldbus parameters of<br>
the Fieldbus network 14 such that the interface module 16 may store values of the<br>
service access points from the Profibus DP devices and transmit those values in<br>
response to requests from the Fieldbus devices. As another example, a ModBus TCP<br>
network may be connected to the interface module 16 at the Internet I/O module 104,<br>
with parameters of the Fieldbus network mapped to ModBus TCP data structures and<br>
vice versa and, if desired, data structures of the ModBus TCP network mapped to data<br>
structures of a non-Internet network connected to the non-Internet I/O module 94 or<br>
another Internet-based network connected to the internet I/O module 104. Still<br>
further, the interface module 16 may be configured with additional I/O modules 84-<br>
104 to facilitate connection and integration of a desired number of process control<br>
networks 12,14,17.<br>
 [0053] In order to ensure a substantially constant connection between the<br>
process control networks connected by the interface module 16, the interface module<br>
16 and the connection provided thereby may be configured with redundant systems in<br>
addition to any redundancy mechanisms implemented in within the connected process<br>
control networks. In one embodiment, multiple interface modules 16 may be<br>
connected between two or more process control networks in the same -configuration<br>
such that each interface module 16 may be -capable of receiving messages and<br>
responding on the process control networks. Moreover, the interface modules 16 may<br>
be connected to the user interface 86 such that each of the interface modules 16 may<br>
be configured by the user interface 86 in the manner discussed above. The user<br>
interface 86 may be configured to configure each of the interface modules 16 so that<br>
each of the interface modules 16 is prepared to operate to communicate information<br>
between the process control networks. In operation, one of the interface modules 16<br>
may be active at a given time to respond to requests from the field devices of the<br>
process control networks, while the remaining interface modules) 16 may be ^et to a<br>
standby mode wherein the interface module(s) 16 receive information from the field<br>
devices and update the information stored in the database(s) in order to remain<br>
synchronized with the active interface module 16. Mode control for the interface<br>
modules 16 may be effected via a connection between the interface modules 16, via<br>
the user interface 86, or via another common connection between interface modules<br>
16 such that the status of the interface modules 16 may be monitored, and the<br>
operational mode of the interface modules 16 as active or standby may be adjusted,<br>
either manually or automatically based on changes in the status of the interface<br>
modules 16 so that an active connection may be maintained between the connected<br>
process control networks.<br>
[0054] As a further alternative, redundancy may be built into the interface<br>
modules 16 themselves by providing either multiple I/O modules 94, 104, or multiple<br>
input ports for the I/O modules 94, 104 so that a constant connection of the interface<br>
module 16 to a given process control network may be maintained. Fig. 4 illustrates an<br>
embodiment of the interface module 16 wherein a second Internet I/O module 140 is<br>
provided, at least in part, to provide redundancy within the interface module 16. The<br>
Internet I/O module 140 may be similar to the Internet I/O module 104, and may be<br>
connected to the controller 90 and include a communications port or wireless<br>
communications capability for connecting the Internet I/O module 140 to the Internetbased<br>
process control network 17 and/or the user interface 86. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, the Internet I/O modules 104, 140 may be connected to the Internetbased<br>
process control network 17 to facilitate communications between the interface<br>
module 16 and the process control network 17 and user interface 86. At a given time,<br>
one of the Internet I/O modules 104, 140 may be designated by the controller 90 as<br>
the active module for communications with the Internet process control network 17<br>
and the user interface 86, while the other of the Internet I/O modules 104,140 may be<br>
designated by the controller 90 as the standby module that is available in the event<br>
communications through the active module are disrupted, such as in the event of a<br>
software failure or loss of connection to the process control network 17. The<br>
controller 90 may be configured to detect such communication disruptions and to<br>
place the standby module into active status for communications with the process<br>
control network 17, and to disable the active module from service so that the<br>
communication disruption may be remedied. Additionally, the controller 90 may<br>
transmit a message regarding the status of the disabled I/O module 104, 140 to an<br>
appropriate device in one of the connected process control networks 12, 14, 17 for<br>
notifying a system operator of the condition of the interface module 16. While the<br>
redundancy illustrated and described herein relates to the Internet I/O modules 104,<br>
140, those skilled in the art will understand that similar redundancy strategies may be<br>
implemented with any of the I/O modules of the interface module 16 to ensure<br>
constant communication links with any process control networks 12,14,17 connected<br>
thereto.<br>
