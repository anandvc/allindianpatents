Description<br>
The present invention relates to active compound concentrates having herbicidal<br>
action, comprising<br>
a) at least one 4-benzoyl-substituted pyrazole compound of the formula I<br>
in which <br>
R1, R3 independently of one another are hydrogen, halogen, methyl,<br>
halomethyl, methoxy, hatomethoxy, methylthio, methylsuifinyl or<br>
methylsulfonyl;<br>
R2	is a 5-membered heterocyclic radical which is unsubstituted or carries 1,<br>
2, 3 or 4 substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen, C1-C6-alkyl,<br>
 C1-C4-alkoxy, C1-C4-hatoatkyi, C1-C4-haloalkoxy and C1-C4-<br>
alkylthio;<br>
R4	is hydrogen, halogen or methyl;<br>
R5	is C1-C6-aikyl, C3-C6-cycloalkyi or C3-C6-cycloalkyimethyl; and<br>
R6	is hydrogen or C1-C4-alkyl;<br>
or one of its agriculturally useful salts, and<br>
b) 2-chloro-ISI-(2,4-dimethyl-3-th(enyl)-N-(2-methoxy-1-methylethyl)acetamide<br>
(dimethenamid).<br>
The invention also relates to the use of such active compound concentrates for<br>
controlling unwanted vegetation, in particular for controlling graminaceous harmful<br>
plants.<br>
Pure crops of agriculturally interesting useful plants are required for efficient and<br>
profitable practice of industrialized agriculture and for ensuring a consistent product<br>
quality. The selective sensitivity of different plant groups with respect to certain<br>
metabolic inhibitors or other cell toxins may be utilized for the targeted control of<br><br>
unwanted foreign vegetation (growth of harmful plants) on the areas under agricultural<br>
cultivation. Here, it is desirable in principle to enhance both the absolute efficacy and<br>
the specificity of the active compounds used (herbicides) against harmful plants.<br>
The specificity and, within certain limits, the absolute efficacy can be enhanced by<br>
using combinations of a plurality of specific active compounds which attack at different<br>
points of the metabolism of the target plants. If the activity of the combination exceeds<br>
the sum of the individual activities significantly, this is referred to as synergism<br>
(occasionally also as superadditive effects).<br>
The herbicidal action of the 4-benzoyl-substituted pyrazole compounds of the formula I<br>
is known from WO 96/26206 and WO 98/31681.<br>
The herbicidal action of 2-chloro-N-(2,4-dimethyl-3-thienyl)-N-(2-methoxy-1-methyl-<br>
ethyl)acetamide, also referred to as dimethenamid, is known from GB 2,114,566. Ow-<br>
ing to the presence of two chiral elements (the chiral axis along the bond between the<br>
3-position of the thiophene ring and the nitrogen atom of the amide group, and a center<br>
of asymmetry at carbon 1 of the 2-methoxy-1-methy!ethyl group), dimethenamid is a<br>
mixture of four stereoisomers. The stereoisomers of dimethenamid which, with respect<br>
to the asymmetric carbon atom of the 2-methoxy-1-methylethyl group, have the S-<br>
conflguration are also referred to as S~isomer or as dimethenamid-P.<br>
It is known from WO 99/65314 that the joint application of 4-benzoyl-substituted<br>
pyrazole compounds of the formula I and dimethenamid results in a herbicidal action<br>
which is increased compared to the application of the individual compounds.<br>
Formulations comprising both active compounds are not described in this publication.<br>
What is desired, not least for reasons of practicability, are formulations comprising both<br>
the 4-benzoyi-substituted pyrazole compound of the formula I and dimethenamid in<br>
relatively concentrated form. Here, a number of problems have to be solved, in<br>
particular if the formulation comprises the active compounds in concentrated form.<br>
Since, prior to their application, such active compound concentrates are usually diluted<br>
with water, it has to be ensured that the concentrates can be diluted with water without<br>
any problems, and that the resulting aqueous dilution comprises the active compounds<br>
in relatively uniformly distributed form. However, frequently, especially concentrated<br>
active compound formulations (active compound concentrates) have, on prolonged<br>
storage, a tendency to undergo phase separation and/or to precipitate solids. On<br>
dilution with water, this then results in an uneven distribution of the active compounds<br><br>
in the aqueous dilution and/or inaccuracies when metering out the active compounds,<br>
which frequently eliminates the desired superadditive effect.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a formulation for a<br>
mixture of 4-benzoyl-substituted pyrazole compounds of the formula I, as defined at the<br>
outset, and dimethenamid which comprises the two active compounds in relatively<br>
concentrated form.<br>
According to a first subject matter of the present invention, this and further objects are<br>
achieved by a non-aqueous active compound concentrate, which comprises<br>
a)	from 10 to 100 g/l, in particular from 20 to 50 g/l, of at least one 4-benzoyl-<br>
substituted pyrazole compound of the formula I as defined above or one of its<br>
agriculturally useful salts,<br>
b)	from 200 to 700 g/l, in particular from 400 to 600 g/l, of 2-chloro-N-(2,4-dimethyl-<br>
3-thieny!)-N-(2-methoxy-1 -methylethyl)acetamide, and<br>
c)	from 10 to 200 g/l, in particular from 20 to 100 g/l, of at least one surfactant S<br>
selected from a mixture of at least one anionic surfactant or surface-active<br>
compound and at least one nonionic surfactant or surface-active compound,<br>
where the components a), b) and c) are present dissolved in a mixture of organic<br>
solvents consisting to at least 95% by weight, in particular at least 99% by weight,<br>
based on the solvent mixture, of<br>
d1) at least one aprotic polar organic solvent having a miscibility with water at 25°C<br>
and 1 bar of at least 50 g/l, and<br>
d2) at least one organic solvent having a solubility in water at 25°C and 1 bar of less<br>
than 5 g/i, in particular less than 1 g/l.<br>
Such non-aqueous active compound concentrates are particularly storage-stable and<br>
can be diluted without any problems with water to the desired application<br>
concentration. The aqueous active compound preparations prepared using the non-<br>
aqueous active compound concentrates moreover show little foaming (determined<br>
according to Ross-Miles). In addition, the aqueous active compound preparations<br>
obtained are particularly stable toward demixing (determined according to CIPAC MT).<br>
Furthermore, surprisingly, on application of the non-aqueous active compound<br><br>
concentrates according to the invention, an increased herbicidal action compared to<br>
the joint application of separate active compound formulations of active compounds of<br>
the formula I and dimethenamid is observed.<br>
According to a second subject matter of the present invention, the abovementioned<br>
objects are also achieved by an aqueous active compound concentrate, which<br>
comprises<br>
a) from 10 to 100 g/l, in particular from 20 to 50 g/l, of at least one 4-benzoyi-<br>
substituted pyrazole compound of the formula I, as defined above,<br>
b)	from 200 to 700 g/l, in particular from 400 to 600 g/l, of 2-chioro-N-(2,4-dimethyl-<br>
3-thienyi)-N-(2-methoxy-1 -methylethyl)acetamide, and<br>
c)	from 10 to 200 g/l, in particular from 20 to 100 g/l, of at least one surfactant S<br>
selected from nonionic surfactants and mixtures thereof with anionic surfactants,<br>
where the components a) and b) are present in disperse form in an aqueous diluent.<br>
The aqueous active compound compositions according to the invention, too, are<br>
storage-stable even at elevated temperature for a prolonged period of time and can be<br>
diluted without any problems with water to the desired application concentration.<br>

The present invention relates in particular to active compound concentrates of<br>
compounds of the formula I in which R1 and R3 independently of one another are<br>
preferably halogen, methyl, methylthio, methylsulfinyl or methylsulfonyl. R2 is in<br>
particular a radical selected from the group consisting of thiazol-2-yl, thiazol-4-yl,<br>
thiazol-5-yl, isoxazol-3-yl, isoxazol-4-yl, isoxazol-5-yl, 4,5-dihydroisoxazol-3-yl, 4,5-<br>
dihydroisoxazol-4-yl and 4,5-dihydroisoxazol-5-yl, where the radicals mentioned above<br>
are unsubstituted or may be substituted in the manner mentioned above and are in<br>
particular unsubstituted or may carry 1 or 2 methyl groups as substituents. R2 is in<br>
particular selected from the group consisting of isoxazol-5-yl, 3-methylisoxazol-5-yl,<br>
4,5-di hydroisoxazol-3-y1, 5-methyI-4,5-dihydroisoxazol-3-yl, 5-ethyI-4,5-dihydro-<br>
isoxazol-3-yl and 4,5-dimethyl-4,5-dihydroisoxazol-3-yl. R4 is in particular hydrogen. R5<br>
is in particular methyl. R6 is in particular hydrogen or methyl. In particular, R1 is chlo-<br>
rine, methyl or methylsulfonyl, R2 is hydrogen or 4,5-dihydroisoxazol-3-yl, R3 is chlorine<br>
or methylsulfonyl, R4 is hydrogen, R5 is methyl and R6 is hydrogen or methyl.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the active compound<br>
concentrates comprise a compound of the formula I in which R1 is methyl, R2 is 4,5-<br>
dihydroisoxazol-3-yl, R3 is methylsulfonyl, R4 is hydrogen, R5 is methyl and R6 is<br><br>
hydrogen, i.e. the component a) is 4-[2-methyl-3-(4,5-dihydroisoxazol-3-yl)-4-<br>
methylsulfonylbenzoyl]-1-methyl-5-hydroxy-1 H-pyrazole (common name:<br>
topramezone).<br>
Component b) of the active compound concentrates according to the invention can be<br>
employed as a racemic mixture of diastereomers or in the form of a mixture comprising<br>
one, two or three of the four diastereomers in enriched form. Particularly preferred<br>
components are the "S-isomer" of dimethenamid, i.e. dimethenamid-P, and also<br>
mixtures of the stereoisomers of this compound consisting predominantly of 1S-2-<br>
chloro-N-(2,4-dimethyl-3-thienyl)-N-(2-methoxy-1 -methylethyl)acetamide. From among<br>
these, a particularly preferred component b) is pure dimethenamid-P or mixtures of the<br>
stereoisomers of this compound in which the ratio of "S-isomer" (dimethenamid-P, i.e.<br>
stereoisomers of dimethenamid having the S-configuration at the asymmetric carbon<br>
atom of the 2-methoxy-1-methylethyl group) to "R-isomer" (stereoisomers having the<br>
R-configuration at the asymmetric carbon atom of this group) is at least 8 : 2 and in<br>
particular at least 9:1.<br>
In addition to the active compounds of the formula I and dimethenamid or<br>
dimethenamid-P, the non-aqueous active compound concentrates according to the<br>
invention comprise at least one surfactant suitable for stabilizing the active<br>
compound/solvent droplets formed on dilution with water in the aqueous diluent.<br>
According to the invention, this is a mixture of at least one anionic surfactant and at<br>
least one nonionic surfactant. The weight ratio of the at least one anionic surfactant to<br>
the at least one nonionic surfactant is typically in the range of from 1 : 10 to 10 : 1.<br>
Suitable anionic surfactants are, in principle, all anionic surfactants typically used for<br>
stabilizing aqueous o/w emulsions. These are generally organic compounds having a<br>
hydrophobic radical, typically a hydrocarbon radical having 6 to 40, frequently 6 to 30<br>

weight and in particular 1% by weight, based on the total weight of the non-aqueous<br>
active compound concentrate.<br>
The non-aqueous active compound concentrates according to the invention can be<br>
prepared analogously to the preparation of conventional emulsifiable concentrates.<br>
Preferably, a solution of the at least one 4-benzoyl-substituted pyrazole compound I in<br>
at least part of the aprotic polar solvent is first prepared. If appropriate, the preparation<br>
of this solution is carried out with heating; however, temperatures of 80°C should<br>
preferably not be exceeded. In general, the solution is prepared at ambient<br>
temperature or in the range of from 10 to 50°C. The other components of the<br>
formulation are then added to the solution obtained in this manner, it being possible to<br>
add dimethenamid or dimethenamid-P in dissolved form or as a solid. Frequently, the<br>
hydrocarbon solvent, dimethenamid or dimethenamid-P, the surfactants and, if appro-<br>
priate, further components are added successively to the solution of the compound of<br>
the formula I in the aprotic polar organic solvent, and the mixture obtained in this man-<br>
ner is homogenized using suitable apparatus, for example using suitable stirrers, dis-<br>
solves and the like, until a clear homogeneous mixture is obtained. The addition of<br>
hydrocarbon solvent, dimethenamid or dimethenamid-P, surfactants and, if appropriate,<br>
further components and the homogenization are typically carried out at ambient<br><br>
temperature or in the range of from 10 to 50°C. The active compound concentrate<br>
obtained in this manner can then be formulated and packaged in a customary manner.<br>
A second subject matter of the present invention relates to an aqueous active<br>
compound concentrate in accordance with the above definition.<br>
In the aqueous active compound concentrates according to the invention, the active<br>
compounds the formula I and dimethenamid are present in disperse form, i.e. in the<br>
form of finely distributed particles. Here, the term "particle" embraces both solid active<br>
compound particles and liquid active compound droplets. Without subscribing to any<br>
theory, it is assumed that the predominant part of the at least one active compound of<br>
the formula I is present in the form of solid active compounds particles, whereas the<br>
predominant part of the dimethenamid is presumably present in the form of oily<br>
droplets. The particle size of the active compound particles (solid active compound<br>
particles and droplets) is typically not more than 50 μm, in particular 20 urn and espe-<br>
cially 10 μm (the dgo value, i.e. the value which is exceeded by at most 10% by weight<br>
of the active compound particles present in the concentrate). The weight-average<br>
particle size (dso value) is typically in the range of from 0.1 to 10 μm and in particular in<br>
the range of from 0.5 to 5 μm. The values given here refer to the values determined by<br>
quasi-elastic light scattering using dilute aqueous samples of the active compound<br>
concentrates (rate of dilution 1 : 20 to 1 : 200).<br>
According to the invention, the aqueous active compound concentrates comprise at<br>
least one nonionic surfactant or a mixture thereof with at least one anionic surfactant.<br>
According to the invention, the total concentration of surfactants, i.e. the concentration<br>
of nonionic surfactant plus any anionic surfactants present, if appropriate, is in the<br>
range of from 10 to 200 g/l, in particular in the range of from 15 to 150 g/l and<br>
especially in the range of from 20 to 100 g/l. If the aqueous active compound<br>
concentrates according to the invention comprise a mixture of at least one nonionic<br>
surface-active compound and at least one anionic surface-active compound, the weight<br>
ratio of nonionic surfactant to anionic surfactant is preferably from 100 : 1 to 10 : 1, in<br>
particular from 50 : 1 to 5 : 1.<br>
Suitable nonionic surfactants are, in principle, all nonionic surfactants mentioned above<br>
for the non-aqueous active compound concentrates, preferably nonionic surfactants<br>
from the group of the poly(C2-C3-alkoxylates), for example substances from groups<br>
c.10. to c.16, in particular nonionic surfactants from groups c.10, c.11 and c.12. From<br>
among these, particular preference is given to the poly(ethoxylate-co-propoxylates) of<br>
groups c.10. and c.11. Such compounds can be described by the general formula (III)<br><br>
R-0-[(A-0)x;(E-0)y]R'	(III)<br>
in which<br>
R is C10-C22-alkyl, C8-C22-alkylphenyl, mono-, di- or tristyryl,<br>
R' is hydrogen, C1-C10-alkyl, benzyl, formyl or C1-C10-alkylcarbonyl, in particular<br>

A is CH(CH3)CH2,<br>
E is CH2CH2,<br>
x is a number in the range of from 1 to 30, in particular from 1 to 10, and<br>
y is a number in the range of from 2 to 50, in particular from 2 to 30.<br>
Suitable nonionic surfactants in particular also include ethylene oxide/propylene oxide<br>
copolymers as already mentioned in connection with the non-aqueous active<br>
compound concentrates, in particular the triblock copolymers mentioned there.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the nonionic surfactant comprises at least one nonionic<br>
surfactant of groups c. 10 to c. 16, in particular of groups c. 10. and/or c. 11, and<br>
especially at least one nonionic surfactant of the general formula III, and also, if<br>
appropriate, at least one EO/PO copolymer, especially an EO/PO block copolymer of<br>
the type described above. In this embodiment, the weight ratio of the at least one<br>
surfactant of groups c.10. to c.16 to the EO/PO copolymer(s) is typically in the range of<br>
from 100 : 1 to 1 : 1 and especially in the range of from 50 : 1 to 5 : 1.<br>
In addition, the aqueous active compound concentrate according to the invention may<br>
also comprise one or more anionic surfactants. In principle, suitable surfactants are all<br>
those which have been mentioned above in connection with the non-aqueous active<br>
compound concentrates, in particular anionic surfactants of groups c.1 to c.9. and<br>
especially anionic surfactants of group c.9.<br>
The aqueous active compound concentrates according to the invention may addition-<br>
ally also comprise further substances which are not directly relevant to the aim of the<br>
compositions, but which improve their applicability and/or practical properties.<br>
Examples of these are in particular<br>
-	viscosity-regulating substances (thickeners),<br>
-	preservatives,<br>
-	antifoams,<br>
-	agents for adjusting the pH,<br><br>
- antifreeze agents.<br>
Such substances are familiar to the person skilled in the art. The total amount of such<br>
substances will generally not exceed 10% by weight (= about 100 g/l), based on the<br>
active compound concentrate, and is typically in the range of from 0.1 to 10% by weight<br>
(= 1 to 100 g/l), based on the total weight of the active compound concentrate.<br>
The viscosity-modifying additives (thickeners) include in particular compounds which<br>
are known to impart pseudoplastic flow behavior to aqueous formulations, i.e. high<br>
viscosity in the state of rest and low viscosity in the state of motion. Suitable are, in<br>
principle, all compounds used for this purpose in aqueous active compound<br>
concentrates. Mention may be made, for example, of inorganic substances, such as<br>
bentonite or attapulgite (for example Attaclay® from Engelhardt), and organic<br>
substances, such as polysaccharides and heteropolysaccharides, such as Xanthan<br>
Gum® (Kelzan® from Kelco), Rhodopol® 23 (Rhone Poulenc) or Veegum® (from R.T.<br>
Vanderbilt), with Xanthan-Gum® preferably being used. The amount of viscosity-<br>
modifying additives is frequently from 0.1 to 5% by weight, based on the total weight of<br>
the active compound concentrate.<br>
Suitable antifoams are, for example, silicone emulsions (Silikon® SRE, from Wacker, or<br>
Rhodorsil®, from Rhodia), long-chain alcohols, fatty acids, defoamers of the type of<br>
aqueous wax dispersions, solid defoamers ("compounds"), organofluorine compounds<br>
and mixtures thereof known for this purpose. The amount of antifoam is typically from<br>
0.1 to 3% by weight, calculated as foam-active substance and based on the total<br>
weight of the active compound concentrate.<br>
Examples of preservatives are those based on isothiazolones, for example Proxel®<br>
from ICI or Acticide® RS from Thor Chemie or Kathon® MK from Rohm &amp; Haas. The<br>
amount of preservatives, if present, is typically from 0.05 to 0.5% by weight, based on<br>
the total weight of the active compound concentrate.<br>
Suitable antifreeze agents are liquid alkanols, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol,<br>
n-butanol, polyols, for example ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or glycerol. The<br>
amount of antifreeze agents, if present, is generally from 1 to 10% by weight, based on<br>
the total weight of the active compound concentrate.<br>
The aqueous active compound concentrates according to the invention can be<br>
prepared analogously to known processes for preparing suspension concentrates or<br>
suspoemulsion concentrates comprising at least two different active compounds.<br><br>
To this end, in general, an aqueous suspension of the at least one active compound of<br>
the formula I and, separately therefrom, an aqueous suspension or emulsion of<br>
dimethenamid are prepared, and the two suspensions or the suspension and the<br>
emulsion are combined to give the aqueous active compound concentrate according to<br>
the invention. The suspensions of the compounds I, like the suspensions or emulsions<br>
of dimethenamid, can be prepared analogously to the preparation of aqueous<br>
suspension concentrates of organic crop protection agents.<br>
For example, a first aqueous suspension of the at least one active compound of the<br>
formula I can be prepared by initially preparing an aqueous slurry of the at least one<br>
active compound of the formula I, followed by grinding to achieve the desired particle<br>
size. In general, the aqueous slurry comprises part of the surfactants present in the<br>
concentrate, for example an ethylene oxide/propylene oxide copolymer and, if<br>
appropriate, an anionic surfactant, and also, if appropriate, defoamers and, if<br>
appropriate, part or all of the antifreeze agent. Water and further components, for<br>
example the residual amount of antifreeze agent, thickener and biocide, can then be<br>
added to the aqueous suspension, obtained in this manner, of the at least one active<br>
compound I, the auxiliaries typically being added in the form of an aqueous solution.<br>
The aqueous emulsion or suspension of dimethenamid can be prepared in a manner<br>
known per se analogously to the preparation of aqueous concentrates of<br>
dimethenamid. Frequently, an aqueous solution comprising at least part of the<br>
surfactants, in particular at least one surfactant of the formula III, is initially charged,<br>
and dimethenamid is suspended or emulsified therein, if appropriate with heating. The<br>
aqueous initial charge may additionally comprise part or all of the further components<br>
of the aqueous active compound concentrate, for example thickener, biocide, part of<br>
the antifreeze agent and, if appropriate, defoamer.<br>
The suspension of the at least one active compound of the formula I is then combined<br>
by mixing with the aqueous suspension or emulsion of the dimethenamid, for example<br>
with stirring, giving the finished formulation. It is, of course, also possible to add part of<br>
the optional additives subsequently thereto, preferably in the form of an aqueous<br>
solution.<br>
The non-aqueous active compound concentrates according to the invention, like the<br>
aqueous active compound concentrates according to the invention, are suitable in a<br>
manner known per se for controlling unwanted vegetation. The active compound<br>
concentrates according to the invention are particularly suitable for controlling<br><br>
unwanted vegetation on non-crop areas, especially at high application rates. In crops<br>
such as cereals, for example wheat, rye, barley, oats, millet and triticale, and also in<br>
corn, they act against broad-leaved weeds and weed grasses without causing any<br>
significant damage to the crop plants. This effect is mainly observed at low rates of<br>
application.<br>
Depending on the application method in question, the active compound concentrates<br>
according to the invention can additionally be employed in a further number of crop<br>
plants for eliminating unwanted plants.<br>
In addition, the active compound concentrates can also be used in crops which tolerate<br>
the action of herbicides owing to breeding, including genetic engineering methods.<br>
The active compound concentrates are generally applied in the form of an aqueous<br>
spray liquor. To this end, the active compound concentrates according to the invention<br>
are, depending on the application rate, diluted with water to a multiple of their volume,<br>
for example 10- to 10 000-fold, in particular 20- to 1000-fold. The active compound<br>
concentration in the spray liquor is then typically in the range of from 10 mg/l to 10 g/l.<br>
Application may be by the pre-emergence method, by the post-emergence method or<br>
together with the seed of a crop plant. It is also possible to apply the active compounds<br>
of the formula I and dimethenamid or dimethenamid-P present in the active compound<br>
concentrates using the active compound concentrates according to the invention by<br>
treating seed of a crop plant with an aqueous dilution of the active compound<br>
concentrates and sowing the seed treated in this manner. If the active compounds<br>
present in the active compound concentrates according to the invention are less well<br>
tolerated by certain crop plants, application techniques may be used in which the<br>
application forms prepared using the active compound concentrates are sprayed, with<br>
the aid of the spraying equipment, in such a way that as far as possible they do not<br>
come into contact with the leaves of the sensitive crop plants, while the active<br>
compounds reach the leaves of unwanted plants growing underneath, or the bare soil<br>
surface (post-directed, lay-by).<br>
Based on the total amount of active compound, the application rates are, depending on<br>
the control target, the season, the target plants and the growth stage, from 0.001 to<br>
3.0, preferably from 0.01 to 1.0, kg of active substance (a.s.)/ha.<br>
To widen the activity spectrum and to achieve synergistic effects, the active compound<br>
concentrates may, prior to application, be mixed with numerous representatives of<br><br>
other herbicidal or growth-regulating groups of active compounds and then applied<br>
jointly, for example by the tank-mix method. Suitable components for mixtures are, for<br>
example, 1,2,4-thiadiazoles, 1,3,4-thiadiazoles, amides, aminophosphoric acid and<br>
derivatives thereof, aminotriazoles, anilides, (het)aryloxyalkanoic acid and derivatives<br>
thereof, benzoic acid and derivatives thereof, benzothiadiazinones, 2-aroyl-1,3-<br>
cyclohexanediones, 2-hetaroyl-1,3-cyclohexanediones, hetaryl aryl ketones, benzyli-<br>
soxazolidinones, meta-CF3-phenyl derivatives, carbamates, quinolinecarboxylic acid<br>
and derivatives thereof, chloroacetanilides, cyclohexenone oxime ether derivatives,<br>
diazines, dichloropropionic acid and derivatives thereof, dihydrobenzofurans, dihydrofu-<br>
ran-3-ones, dinitroanilines, dinitrophenols, diphenyl ethers, dipyridyls, halocarboxylic<br>
acids and derivatives thereof, ureas, 3-phenyluracils, imidazoles, imidazolinones, N-<br>
phenyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalimides, oxadiazoles, oxiranes, phenols, aryloxy- or het-<br>
eroaryloxyphenoxypropionic esters, phenylacetic acid and derivatives thereof, phenyl-<br>
propionic acid and derivatives thereof, pyrazoles, phenylpyrazoles, pyridazines, pyridi-<br>
necarboxylic acid and derivatives thereof, pyrimidyl ethers, sulfonamides, sulfony-<br>
lureas, triazines, triazinones, triazolinones, triazolecarboxamides and uracils.<br>
It may furthermore be beneficial to mix the active compound concentrates prior to<br>
application with other crop protection agents, followed by joint application, for example<br>
with agents for controlling pests or phytopathogenic fungi or bacteria. Also of interest is<br>
the miscibility with mineral salt solutions, which are employed for treating nutritional<br>
and trace element deficiencies. It is also possible to add nonphytotoxic oils and oil<br>
concentrates.<br>
