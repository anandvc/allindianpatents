				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to toners for developing electrostatic<br>
images of electrophotography, electrostatic recording, electrostatic printing, and<br>
the like; and to developers, toner containers, process cartridges, image forming<br>
apparatuses, and image forming methods using the toners.<br>
Background Art<br>
Image formation by e.g. electrophotographic method is generally carried<br>
out by a series of processes including forming a latent electrostatic image on a<br>
photoconductor (latent electrostatic image bearing member),' developing the<br>
latent electrostatic image by a developer containing a toner to form a visible<br>
image (toner image),' then transferring the visible image to a recording medium<br>
such as paper," and fixing the image to form an fixed image.<br>
The toner is a colored particle comprising a binder (binder resin),<br>
colorant, charge controlling agent, etc. which are contained in the binder. As<br>
the method for producing the toner, pulverization and suspension<br>
polymerization are mainly known.<br>
The pulverization is a method for producing a toner in which a colorant,<br><br>
charge controlling agent, etc. are melt-mixed and are uniformly dispersed into a<br>
binder to obtain a toner composition, and the obtained toner composition is<br>
grinded, classified, etc. to form a toner. The pulverization has drawbacks as<br>
follows. Specifically, a grinder, etc., are required to grind a toner composition,<br>
resulting in high cost, and thus the method is not effective. In addition, during<br>
the grinding, toner particles with wide distribution of particle diameter tend to<br>
be formed. Therefore, in order to obtain images with high resolution and high<br>
gradation, a portion of the toner particles, for example, minute particles of 5 µm<br>
or less in diameter and large grains of 20 µm or more, must be removed by<br>
classification, inviting a significant reduction of yield. Furthermore, it is<br>
difficult to disperse additives such as a colorant, and charge controlling agent<br>
into the binder uniformly. The use of the toner in which the additives are not<br>
dispersed uniformly deteriorates flowability, developability, durability, image<br>
quality, etc.<br>
Recently, to overcome these problems in pulverization, a method for<br>
producing a toner by polymerization of monomer is proposed and carried out.<br>
For example, toner particles are produced by suspension polymerization.<br>
However, toner particles obtained by suspension polymerization are generally<br>
spherical and have drawback of poor cleaning ability. Poor cleaning ability<br>
causes non-transferred residual toner on a photoconductor, and the<br>
accumulation of such residual toner leads to background smear. Moreover,<br>
residual toner oontaminates components such as a charging roller, which<br><br>
charges a photoconductor by contact charging, and subsequently reduces the<br>
charging performance of the charging roller.<br>
Therefore, a method for producing toner particles is proposed in which<br>
emulsion polymerization is used to form resin fine particles, which are<br>
subsequently associated to obtain toner particles having irregular shapes (See<br>
Patent literature 1). However, toner particles formed by emulsion<br>
polymerization have residual surfactants in large amounts inside the particles<br>
as well as on the surface thereof, even after being washed by water. As a result,<br>
charge stability of toner is reduced, the distribution of the amount of charge is<br>
increased, causing background smear on a printed image. In addition, the<br>
residual surfactant contaminates photoconductor, charging roller, developing<br>
roller, etc. Therefore, toner cannot fulfill its original function.<br>
On the other hand, for the fixing process by contact heating, in which<br>
heating members such as a heating roller are used, the toner particles must<br>
possess releasability, which may be referred to as "offset resistance" hereinafter,<br>
from the heating members. In such case, offset resistance can be improved by<br>
allowing a releasing agent to exist on the surface of toner particles. In contrast,<br>
methods to improve offset resistance are disclosed in which resin fine particles<br>
are not only contained in toner particles, but are concentrated at the surface of<br>
the toner particles (See Patent Literatures 2 and 3).<br>
These proposals, however, cause increase of lowest fixing temperature,<br>
resulting in unsatisfactory fixing ability at low temperatures, i.e. energy-saving<br><br>
fixing ability. In addition, this method, in which resin fine particles obtained<br>
by emulsion polymerization are associated to provide irregularshaped toner<br>
particles, has another problem. Generally, releasing agent particles are<br>
additionally associated to improve the offset resistance. However, the releasing<br>
agent particles are captured inside the toner particles and therefore the<br>
improvement of the offset resistance is not sufficient. Moreover, since each<br>
toner particle is formed by a random adhesion of molten resin fine particles,<br>
releasing agent particles, colorant particles, and the like, the composition (the<br>
ratio at which each component is contained), molecular mass of the resin, and<br>
the like may be different and dispersed for each obtained toner particle. In<br>
result, the surface properties of toner particles are different from one another,<br>
and it is impossible to form stable images for a long period. Additionally, in a<br>
low-temperature fixing system, the resin fine particles that are concentrated at<br>
the surface of the toner particles inhibit fixing and therefore the range of fixing<br>
temperature is not sufficient.<br>
Recently, a new method for producing a toner, called solution suspension<br>
method (Emulsion-aggregation method (EA method), has been suggested (See<br>
Patent Literature 4). In this method, particles are formed from polymers that<br>
are dissolved in an organic solvent or the like whereas in suspension<br>
polymerization, polymer particles are formed from monomers, and the method is<br>
advantageous in that, for example, there is a larger selection of resins that can<br>
be used and polarity can be controlled. Furthermore, the method is<br><br>
advantageous in that it is possible to control the structure of toner particles<br>
(core/shell structure control). However, the shell structure is a layer consisting<br>
only of a resin and the purpose thereof is to lower the exposure of pigment and<br>
wax to the surface. The purpose is not to alter the structure in the resin, and<br>
the structure is not capable for such purpose (See Non-Patent Literature 1).<br>
Therefore, although the toner particle has a shell structure, the surface of the<br>
toner particle is a usual resin without any ingenious feature so that when the<br>
toner particle is targeted at fixing at a lower temperature, there is a problem<br>
that it is not satisfactory from the standpoint of anti-heat preservability and<br>
environmental charge stability.<br>
In any of the conventional methods such as the suspension<br>
polymerization, emulsion polymerization, and solution suspension,<br>
styrene-acrylic acid ester copolymer is used as a binder resin in many cases.<br>
Polyester resins are not generally used because they are difficult to be made into<br>
particles, it is uneasy to control particle diameter, diameter distribution, particle<br>
shape, etc., and their fixing ability is insufficient under the condition of fixing at<br>
a lower temperature.<br>
In pulverization, in order to achieve fixing at low temperatures, a<br>
polyester resin having a high acid value is used. For example, Patent<br>
Literature 5 and Patent Literature 6 propose toners comprising a resin of which<br>
acid value, hydroxyl value, molecular mass distribution, THF insoluble content,<br>
or the like, are defined. The toner in these proposals, however, causes the<br><br>
reduction of melting temperature at the same time, resulting in the<br>
deterioration of offset resistance. In order to achieve all of fixing property at<br>
low temperatures, offset resistance and anti-heat preservability, further<br>
improvement is needed.<br>
Much work has been done from various angles of approach in the field of<br>
electrophotography to improve quality, and it is being recognized that it is<br>
extremely effective to reduce the size and increase the sphericity of the toner<br>
particle. However, as the diameter of toner particles becomes smaller, the<br>
transferability and fixing ability tend to decrease, and image quality becomes<br>
poor. Especially, with respect to fixing, fixing ability at a halftone portion<br>
becomes worse. This is because at the halftone portion, the adhesive amount of<br>
toner is low, the toner, transferred to the concave portion on a transfer material,<br>
is given extremely small amount of heat from a fixing roller, causing generation<br>
of offset phenomenon easily. In addition, it is known that by making toner<br>
particles round, the transferability rises (See Patent Literature 7).<br>
In such situation, ever-faster image production is desired in the field of<br>
color copiers and printers. For a faster printing, the "tandem method" is<br>
effective (See Patent Literature 8). The "tandem method" is a method in which<br>
images formed by respective image forming units are overlaid and sequentially<br>
transferred onto a sheet of paper that is advanced by a transfer belt so that a<br>
full-color image is obtained on the sheet. In a color image forming apparatus<br>
using tandem method, various kinds of paper can be used, the quality of<br><br>
full-color images is high, and full-color images can be formed at high speed.<br>
The high-speed output of full-color images is especially characteristic and no<br>
other color image reproduction machines have that characteristic. There are<br>
other attempts to increase speed while improving the quality by using round<br>
toner particles. In order to increase speed more, the round toner is required to<br>
be fixed quickly; however, in a present situation, such round toner that has both<br>
quick fixing ability and fixing ability at low temperature has not been achieved.<br>
Toner may be subjected to severe circumstances such as high<br>
temperature and humidity, and low temperature and humidity during storage<br>
and transport after the production. There has been a demand for a toner which<br>
does not aggregate to each other, of which flowability, transferability, and fixing<br>
ability do not deteriorate or rarely do, and which has excellent preservability,<br>
even after storage for a long period under such circumstances. However, in the<br>
present situation, effective means for such demand has not been found<br>
especially with respect to spherical toner.<br>
In electrophotographic system, a heat-pressure fixing method by means<br>
of a heating roller is conventionally used. In the method, while the surface of a<br>
heat roller possessing releasability for a toner is brought contact with the toner<br>
image on the surface of a receiving sheet under pressure, the receiving sheet is<br>
allowed to pass through to thereby fix the toner image. In this method, the<br>
surface of the heat roller and toner image on the receiving sheet are brought into<br>
contact with each other under pressure. Thus, heat efficiency during the<br><br>
melt-fixing of toner image on the receiving sheet is extremely satisfactory, which<br>
enables quick fixation.<br>
By the way, in the heat pressure fixing method by means of a heating<br>
roller, the surface of the heating roller and toner image are brought into contact<br>
with each other in a melted state and under pressure. A portion of toner image<br>
is transferred to the surface of fixing roller to adhere, and the transferred<br>
portion of toner image is re-transferred to the next receiving sheet, leading to<br>
the pollution of the receiving sheet. This so-called offset phenomenon is greatly<br>
influenced by the fixing speed and fixing temperature. This is because almost<br>
constant amount of heat for fixing toner is given to toner without depending on<br>
the fixing speed.<br>
In general, when the fixing speed is slow, the surface temperature of<br>
heating roller is set to relatively low temperature. In contrast, when the fixing<br>
speed is fast, the surface temperature of heating roller is set to relatively high<br>
temperature.<br>
The toner on the receiving sheet forms several toner layers. Thus,<br>
particularly, in a system where fixing speed is fast, the surface temperature of<br>
heating roller is high an uppermost layer of toner layers which contacts with a<br>
heating roller and a lowermost of toner layers which contacts with the receiving<br>
sheet temperature difference becomes large. Therefore, when the surface<br>
temperature of heating roller is high, the toner of the uppermost layer tends to<br>
cause offset phenomenon, and when the surface temperature of heating roller is<br><br>
low, toner does not fix to the receiving sheet because the toner of the lowermost<br>
layer does not melt sufficiently, causing low-temperature offset phenomenon<br>
easily.<br>
As a way to solve this problem, when the fixing speed is fast, a method<br>
is normally carried out in which pressure during fixing is increased, making the<br>
toner to be anchored to the receiving sheet. This method can reduce heating<br>
roller temperature to some degree, and can prevent high-temperature offset<br>
phenomenon of the uppermost layer of toner layers. However, shearing force<br>
on the toner becomes very large, receiving sheet winds around the fixing roller,<br>
i.e., so-called winding offset occurs, and a trace of separating pawls for<br>
separating the receiving sheet from the fixing roller is likely to appear on a fixed<br>
image. Further, inferior fixed images are likely to occur, such as such as failure<br>
of line images during fixing and toner scattering, due to a high pressure.<br>
Moreover, in a high-speed fixing system, a toner having a lower melt<br>
viscosity is generally used than in the case of low speed fixation, and the surface<br>
temperature of the heating roller and fixing pressure are lowered. Thus, a<br>
toner image is fixed while obviating the high-temperature offset and winding<br>
offset. However, the use of such a toner having a low melt viscosity in low<br>
speed fixation is likely to cause an offset phenomenon at high temperature.<br>
Accordingly, in fixing, there has been demand for a toner which shows a<br>
wide fixable temperature range and excellent offset resistance and is applicable<br>
from a low-speed apparatus to a high-speed apparatus.<br><br>
In order to obtain high quality image, an attempt to make the size of<br>
toner particles smaller has been made. Smaller particle size toner increases<br>
the resolution and clearness of an image, but impairs the fixability of a halftone<br>
image. This phenomenon is particularly noticeable in high-speed fixation.<br>
This is because the adhesive amount of toner in a halftone part is small and the<br>
toner transferred to a concave portion of a receiving sheet receives only a small<br>
quantity of heat from a heating roller and the pressure applied thereto is also<br>
suppressed because of the convex portion of the receiving sheet. The toner<br>
transferred onto the convex portion of the receiving sheet in a halftone part<br>
receives a larger shearing force per toner particle because of thin toner layer<br>
thickness, compared with that in a solid image part with thick toner layer<br>
thickness. Thus, offset phenomenon is likely to be caused and fixed image is<br>
likely to have low quality.<br>
Until now, in order to pursue fixing performance and anti-hot offset, a<br>
variety of studies, mainly on binder resin, have been made. For example,<br>
Patent Literature 9 proposes resin having a molecular mass distribution such<br>
that the distribution has at least one local maximal value in each of the region of<br>
a molecular mass of 103 to 7x104 and the region of a molecular mass of 105 to<br>
2x106 in a chromatograph by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) of resin for<br>
toner. Further, in Patent Literature 10 and Patent Literature 11, the<br>
molecular mass distribution of vinyl copolymer is defined and releasing agent<br>
such as polyethylene is added to pursue fixing ability and hot offset.<br><br>
Furthermore, in Patent Literature 12, by combining a resin having low viscosity<br>
with resin having high viscosity, an attempt to improve fixing property at low<br>
temperatures and hot offset property simultaneously is made. In other Patent<br>
Literatures, many techniques have been proposed that pursue optimization of<br>
balance of preservability, fixing ability, and hot offset that are difficult to pursue<br>
simultaneously by widening the molecular mass distribution of binder resin (See<br>
e.g. Patent Literature 10, Patent Literature 11, and Patent Literatures 13 to<br>
16).<br>
In electrophotography, anti-heat preservability, which is influenced by<br>
elements with a low molecular mass, must be also satisfied besides these two<br>
properties that are difficult to pursue simultaneously. For example, in Patent<br>
Literature 17, attempts to improve anti-heat preservability, etc. by using a<br>
novolac type phenol resin or polyurethane other than molecular mass<br>
distribution have been made.<br>
In these proposals, the effect by defining the molecular mass<br>
distribution or the effect by olefin having low molecular mass improves fixing at<br>
low temperatures and anti-heat preservability; however, these binder resins do<br>
not meet the recent demand for energy-saving and low-power enough and<br>
further investigation has been desired.<br>
In particular, in order to improve fixing property at low temperatures, it<br>
is required to lower the glass-transition temperature (Tg) and molecular mass of<br>
binder resin. However, in the present situation, it is difficult to develop such<br><br>
toner that satisfies all these properties in light of balance between hot offset<br>
property and preservability.<br>
For example, Patent literature 18 proposes a dry toner containing a<br>
urethane-modified polyester (A) as a toner binder obtained by elongation<br>
reaction and having a practical sphericity of 0.90 to 1.00 in order to improve the<br>
fluidity, fixing property at low temperatures, and hot offset property. Further,<br>
a dry toner is proposed that has excellent powder fluidity and transferability,<br>
although the toner has a small particle diameter, and is also excellent in any of<br>
anti-heat preservability, fixing property at low temperatures, and hot offset<br>
resistance. The dry toner produces glossy images, especially, when used in e.g.<br>
a full-color copier and does not require application of oil to a heat roller.<br>
Although the dry toner proposed by Patent Iiteraturel8 is novel in that<br>
binder obtained as a result of a urethane reaction is employed, it is produced by<br>
a pulverization process and does not have satisfactory fixing ability at low<br>
temperatures. In addition, specific conditions enabling a small particle<br>
diameter and controlling particle shape so as to be spherical are not described.<br>
Moreover, Patent Literature 19 and Patent literature 20 propose a dry<br>
toner comprising a toner binder formed from an elongation and/or a crosslinking<br>
reaction of an isocyanate group containing prepolymer, and a colorant, wherein<br>
the dry toner is formed of particles formed from an elongation and/or a<br>
crosslinking reaction of the modified polyester (A) by amines (B) in an aqueous<br>
medium. Patent literatures 19 and 20 also propose a method for producing<br><br>
the toner, which is an economically affordable method to obtain a dry toner.<br>
The toners proposed in these Patent Literatures 19 and 20 are prepared<br>
by granulation in water. However, in such granulation in water, a pigment in<br>
an oil phase aggregates at the interface with an aqueous phase, which leads to<br>
decreased volume resistivity or uneven pigment distribution and causes<br>
problems in fundamental properties of the toner, To achieve simultaneously a<br>
small particle diameter and a satisfactorily controlled shape of a toner for use in<br>
a machine without application of oil, the specific shape and/or properties must<br>
be defined and without such specified shape and/or properties, effect cannot be<br>
achieved. However, each Patent Literature dose not describe adequately the<br>
effects of the combination of properties and/or processes or effects of the balance<br>
between detailed conditions, and thus effects on the problems may not be<br>
significantly achieved. Particularly, in the case of toner particles prepared by<br>
granulation in water, pigment and/or wax is likely to gather on the surface of the<br>
particles of toner. Toner particles having a particle diameter of about 6 µm or<br>
less have a large specific surface area, thus design of the particle surface<br>
becomes important for achieving desired charging properties fixing properties in<br>
addition to the design of the polymer component.<br>
In general, conventional electrophotographic image forming apparatus<br>
comprises a heat fixing unit in which a pressure member such as a pressure<br>
roller is brought into contact with a heating member such as heating roller<br>
having a heat source inside thereof, a recording medium on which image has<br><br>
been transferred is passed therebetween and while the recording medium being<br>
transported, toner images on the recording medium are fixed.<br>
In this type of heat fixing unit, so-called offset phenomenon that toner<br>
on the recording medium adheres to a heating member may occur. It is known<br>
that when this offset phenomenon occurs, offset toner also adheres to the<br>
pressure member, and toner adhered to those heating member and pressure<br>
member is transferred back to a recording medium to contaminate the recording<br>
medium. In order to prevent the occurrence of offset, in a conventional heat<br>
fixing unit, for example, the surface of a heating member was coated with<br>
fluorine. However, it is difficult to prevent offset phenomenon completely<br>
depending on environmental conditions, types of recording medium, etc,<br>
eventually causing reverse transfer.<br>
Therefore, a heat fixing unit is proposed in which a cleaning member<br>
such as cleaning roller is provided in contact with a heating member and<br>
pressure member to thereby remove toner adhered to the heating member and<br>
pressure member. In this heat fixing unit, cleaning member, made of pure<br>
metal material, is brought into contact with a heating member or pressure<br>
member having improved surface releasability, thereby removing toner due to<br>
the difference of surface releasability.<br>
Recently, an image forming apparatus has been constructed in the<br>
following manner in order to prevent a waste of energy. Specifically, during the<br>
standby state, current to the heat source of a heat fixing unit is stopped, only<br><br>
when image forming starts, current is allowed to flow to the heat source, and the<br>
temperature of the heating member is raised to the fixing temperature.<br>
Therefore, the heating member is required to have improved response to<br>
temperature, for example, a heating roller has a thickness of 1 mm or less,<br>
thereby shortening the time to rise to a fixing temperature to approximately 10<br>
seconds.<br>
In such image forming apparatus, the heating member of a heat fixing<br>
unit has a low thermal capacity, thus heat easily moves to a recording medium<br>
at the time of fixing or to a member contacting with the heating member, or the<br>
heating member is liable to be influenced by the flow of the wind around the<br>
heating member. These cause a problem that the temperature distribution of<br>
the heating member is likely to become uneven in the direction of width.<br>
Therefore, it is impossible to make the temperature distribution even over the<br>
entire region in terms of space and cost.<br>
In a heat fixing unit, uneven temperature distribution of heating<br>
member in the direction of width leads to unstability of fixing performance, and<br>
at the same time, offset is likely to occur. In addition, there is a problem that<br>
deterioration by heat makes the lifetime of a heating member shorter. In<br>
particular, the use of polymerized toner produced by polymerization described in<br>
Patent Literature 18 and Patent Literature 20 causes a problem that tone<br>
adheres to a cleaning member and accumulates thereon, and the masses of<br>
toner melt again and the toner is transferred back to a recording medium. This<br><br>
is because when pulverized toner produced by pulverization is used, the toner<br>
adhered to the cleaning member has a high storage modulus and is unlikely to<br>
melt; however, when polymerized toner produced by polymerization is used, the<br>
toner adhered to the cleaning member has a low storage modulus, as is expected<br>
to toner produced by polymerization.<br>
This problem is caused especially when recording medium, e.g. a paper,<br>
with small size compared with maximum size to which sheet is run through is<br>
passed through. The reason for this is considered as follows. The passed<br>
region by a recording medium with small size is narrow and thus the contact<br>
area with a heating member is small. Therefore, only the narrow region has<br>
decreased temperature and temperature sensor corresponding to the region<br>
dictates switch-on of a heat source, resulting in unnecessary rise in temperature<br>
of the region where sheet has not passed. This causes the toner on a cleaning<br>
member corresponding to the region where sheet has not passed to melt and be<br>
transferred back.<br>
In attempting to solve such problem of back transfer, Patent literature<br>
21 proposes a heat fixing unit in which in order to make the temperature<br>
distribution of heating roller uniform in the direction of width, wind is applied<br>
thereby preventing the region where sheet has not passed of the heating roller<br>
from having excessively raised temperature.<br>
In addition, Patent Literature 22 proposes a heat fixing unit in which<br>
air holes are provided along a cleaning roller so that air in the heat fixing unit is<br><br>
circulated with rotation of the cleaning roller to thereby prevent the<br>
temperature of the cleaning roller from being raised.<br>
However, there has not been provided a toner which can fix<br>
satisfactorily immediately after power activation and even under low-power<br>
condition, which has releasability applicable to from low-speed through<br>
high-speed image forming apparatuses, which is excellent in offset resistance,<br>
blocking resistance, and flowability, which does not affect fixing efficiency in a<br>
heat fixing unit, and which is not transferred back when adhered to a cleaning<br>
member, and related techniques. Thus, in the present situation, it has been<br>
desired that such toner and related techniques are provided as soon as possible.<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
A first object of the invention is to provide a toner such that the toner<br>
corresponds to a low-temperature fixing system, is excellent in both of offset<br>
resistance and anti-heat preservability and especially, even after a large number<br>
of copies are to be produced over a long period, the toner does not aggregate to<br>
each other, deterioration of flowability, transferability, and fixing ability is<br><br>
extremely rare, the toner makes it possible to form stable images on any<br>
transferring medium without transfer errors and with good reproducibility, and<br>
further does not contaminate fixing unit and images, and is also to provide a<br>
developer, toner container, process cartridge, image forming apparatus, and<br>
image forming method using the toner.<br>
A second object of the invention is to provide a toner which can fix<br>
satisfactorily immediately after power activation and even under low-power<br>
condition, which has releasability applicable to from low-speed to high-speed<br>
image forming apparatuses, which is excellent in offset resistance, blocking<br>
resistance, and flowability, which does not affect fixing efficiency in a heat fixing<br>
unit, and which is not transferred back when adhered to a cleaning member,<br>
and is also to provide a developer, toner container, process cartridge, image<br>
forming apparatus, and image forming method using the toner.<br>
A third object of the invention is to provide a toner such that images<br>
with high density and resolution without fogging can be obtained from<br>
low-speed to high-speed image forming apparatuses; and is also to provide a<br>
developer, toner container, process cartridge, image forming apparatus, and<br>
image forming method using this toner.<br>
From a dedicated investigation of relationship between fixing ability,<br>
particularly, offset resistance, and heat characteristic obtained from a capillary<br>
type flow tester that has been carried out by the present inventors to settle<br>
above issues, it is found that the following toner can settle above issues.<br><br>
Specifically, firstly, the toner has a 1/2 flow beginning temperature, Tma of<br>
130°C to 200°C. Secondly, temperature difference ΔTm, Tma - Tmb, is 0°C to<br>
20°C, wherein Tma is 1/2 flow beginning temperature of the toner and Tmb is<br>
1/2 flow beginning temperature of a melt kneaded mixture of the toner in which<br>
the toner is completely uniformly melted and dispersed by sufficient melting,<br>
shearing, and kneading.<br>
Namely, the primary cause of hot offset is a resin having a low softening<br>
point in the toner, and thus it is important to make this resin to have an<br>
appropriate flow temperature. In addition to above-noted resin, toner typically<br>
also contains a resin having highly cross-linked structure such as a gel<br>
component, releasing agent, etc., and a capillary type flow tester is suitable for<br>
measuring comprehensive flow temperature of these. The higher the heat<br>
characteristic is, especially, the higher the 1/2 flow beginning temperature is, the<br>
better hot offset resistance tends to become; however, the correlation between<br>
them was low. The reason for this is considered, for example, as follows. In<br>
the case of toner having a so-called core/shell structure where a resin having<br>
highly cross-linked structure concentrates on the toner surface and a resin<br>
having a low softening point exists inside the toner; or toner having a seα-island<br>
structure where a gel component is present in a resin having a low softening<br>
point, only measurement of heat characteristic of toner itself is not considered to<br>
be appropriate to know the heat characteristic of the toner at the time when<br>
heat and pressure are sufficiently applied in a fixing section. Therefore, even if<br><br>
toner having a core/shell structure, as polymerized toner often has, or the like<br>
has a sufficiently high 1/2 flow beginning temperature, the core/shell structure is<br>
destroyed at the time of fixing and a resin having a low melting point flows out<br>
to the outside of the shell, which may cause offset. In contrast, the present<br>
inventors have found that there is a high correlation between: 1/2 flow beginning<br>
temperature of a kneaded mixture of toner in which toner composition is<br>
completely uniformly melted and dispersed by melting, shearing, and kneading<br>
of toner; and hot offset resistance, and particularly, have found that remarkably<br>
high hot offset resistance can be obtained by satisfying the above-mentioned<br>
first and second conditions of the invention.<br>
Further, the present inventors have found that when toner is obtained<br>
by dissolving or dispersing a polymer (prepolymer) that is reactive with an<br>
active hydrogen group containing compound, releasing agent and colorant at<br>
least in an organic solvent to form a toner solution, dispersing the solution or<br>
dispersion in an aqueous medium, reacting the polymer that is reactive with an<br>
active hydrogen group containing compound, after or during the reaction,<br>
removing the organic solvent, washing and drying, the toner improves the effect<br>
of the invention.<br>
In addition, the present inventors further intensively investigated toner<br>
which is excellent in flowability, transferability, fixing ability, hot offset property,<br>
image quality, and anti-heat preservability, which does not affect fixing<br>
efficiency in a heat fixing unit, and which is not transferred back when adhered<br><br>
to a cleaning roller. As a result, the dry toner described in JP-A Nos. 11-149180<br>
and 2000-292981 is formed of particles formed from an elongation and/or a<br>
crosslinking reaction of the modified polyester (A) by amines (B) in an aqueous<br>
medium and the toner is granulated in water. The dry toner has a particle<br>
structure wherein the particle surface of the toner is moderately coated with a<br>
modified polyester, low Tg polyester and modified polyester are present inside<br>
the particle of toner, wax as a releasing agent is dispersed near the particle<br>
surface, and further, the surface is coated with polymeric resin fine particles<br>
which serves as a surface layer of the toner particle. It realized that in the heat<br>
roller type fixing, a low softening polymer having low heat characteristic inside<br>
the particle bleeds out promptly to contribute to fixing. In addition, it has<br>
found that formation of thin layer made of resin fine particles as a surface layer<br>
of toner enables preservability (especially heat resistance) at the same time due<br>
to control of heat characteristic and molecular mass, in particular, since binder<br>
having a low softening point prevents blocking by its heat.<br>
Moreover, it has found that by the improvement of fixing ability as a<br>
result of allowing toner particle to have a small particle diameter, toner has<br>
fixing property at low temperatures, preservability, fixing property at low<br>
temperatures, releasability, small particle diameter, and highly dispersed<br>
pigment, thereby enabling high image quality.<br>
In normal image output, the toner, adhered to a fixing roller from a<br>
recording paper due to electrostatic offset or the like, is transferred to a pressure<br><br>
roller at a nip portion where the fixing roller and pressure roller contacts to each<br>
other. The toner adhered to the pressure roller is collected by a cleaning roller<br>
at a nip portion between the pressure roller and cleaning roller. The toner<br>
adhered to the fixing roller through such process is collected by the cleaning<br>
roller and approximately several grams of toner are collected by the cleaning<br>
roller after copied 150,000 sheets.<br>
 Here, as shown in FIG. 16, when a toner is adhered to a cleaning roller<br>
600 and a fixing unit 610 is rotated under the heater control of a heater 603<br>
arranged inside of a fixing roller 602 without making a recording paper to pass<br>
through, no problem occurs in the case of pulverized toner composed of<br>
conventional uniform dispersion of pigment, wax, and resin. This is because<br>
the resin used as a binder has a relatively high glass-transition temperature<br>
(Tg), around 60°C, thus the toner, which adheres to a cleaning roller during<br>
cleaning, has a high viscosity, and even if the temperature rises as the number of<br>
copy increases, the adhered toner is unlikely to remelt. This is also because the<br>
temperature at which toner melts doe not vary before and after fixing process<br>
due to uniformity of the adhered toner.<br>
On the other hand, when polymerized toner having a core/shell<br>
structure, as described in JP-A No. 2000-292981, is used, heat is required for<br>
melting polymeric resin of a shell at the time of fixing. However, once toner<br>
undergoes fixing process, the core/shell structure is destroyed, temperature<br>
characteristic of low molecular mass resin, which melts at relatively low<br><br>
temperature, becomes dominant and the toner tends to melt at lower<br>
temperature than the temperature set for fixing. Therefore, as shown in FIG.<br>
16, when a toner is adhered to a cleaning roller 600 and a fixing unit 610 is<br>
rotated under the heater control of a heater 603 arranged inside of a fixing roller<br>
602 without making a recording paper to pass through, collected toner adversely<br>
remelts and adheres again to the pressure roller 601 and fixing roller 602. If<br>
images are formed with this state, a problem is caused that the remelted toner<br>
adheres to a recording paper, contaminating both sides of the recording paper.<br>
In order to achieve fixing property at low temperatures, this core/shell structure<br>
is very advantageous toner structure in that a resin having a lower<br>
glass-transition temperature (Tg) compared with that of resin in pulverized<br>
toner can be used and that even if low molecular mass resin is used, both of<br>
preservability and fixing property at low temperatures can be pursued.<br>
However, it has found that with respect to adhesion of toner to the fixing<br>
cleaning roller, the adhered toner has a glass-transition temperature (Tg) lower<br>
than that of pulverized toner by about 5°C to about 15°C, the toner adhered to<br>
the cleaning roller remelts due to the heat of fixing roller during copying and is<br>
transferred back to the fixing roller.<br>
Accordingly, the present inventors have developed a toner such that the<br>
toner structure remains to be a core/shell structure, fixing property at low<br>
temperatures and preservability, hot offset property, and prevention of<br>
remelting of toner from a cleaning roller of a fixing roller are pursued at the<br><br>
same time, and further the toner enables images with high resolution.<br>
Specifically, it has found that the toner including a toner material and<br>
has resin fine particles on the surface thereof, wherein the toner has a<br>
glass-transition temperature (Tg) of 30°C to 46°C, the resin fine particles have a<br>
glass-transition temperature (Tg) of 50°C to 70°C, when the toner is masticated<br>
with Labo Plastomill, the 1/2 flown-out temperature is 95°C to 120°C, and before<br>
the toner is masticated, 1/2 flown-out temperature is 120°C to 145°C, is unlikely<br>
to cause remelting of toner and can satisfy fixing property at low temperatures<br>
and hot offset property.<br>

inventors and the means for solving the problems are as follows. Specifically,<br> A toner including a toner material, wherein the toner satisfies the<br>

type flow tester, and<br>

recording medium. In the image forming method, the latent electrostatic<br>
image is formed on the latent electrostatic image bearing member in the latent<br>
electrostatic image forming. The visible image is transferred onto the recording<br>
medium in the transferring. The transferred image is fixed on the recording<br>

anti-heat preservability and especially, even after a large number of copies are to<br>
be produced over a long period, the toner does not aggregate to each other,<br>
deterioration of flowability, transferability, and fixing ability is extremely rare,<br>
and the toner makes it possible to form stable images on any transferring<br>
medium without transfer errors and with good reproducibility.<br><br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
(Toner)<br>
The toner of the invention, in a first aspect, comprises toner material,<br>
wherein the toner satisfies the following formula:<br>
0°C≤ΔTm≤20°C where ΔTm represents Tma - Tmb, Tma (°C) is 1/2 flown-out<br>
temperature of the toner by a capillary type flow tester, and Tmb (°C) is 1/2<br>
flown-out temperature of a melt kneaded mixture of the toner by the capillary<br>
type flow tester, and wherein Tma is from 130°C to 200°C.<br><br>
Here, the toner in the melt kneaded mixture of toner can be melted and<br>
kneaded by any method without limitation if the toner is sufficiently melted,<br>
sheared and kneaded, compositions such as a binder resin and releasing agent<br>
in a toner can be completely and uniformly melted and dispersed by the method<br>
and the method can be appropriately selected according to the purpose.<br>
Examples of the kneading machine include such as a uniaxial extruding<br>
kneader, biaxial extruding kneader, batch-type kneader, and the like. The<br>
kneading temperature is preferably 130°C to 150°C. Conditions of kneading<br>
such as torque, rotation number, and time are preferably such a degree that<br>
molecular chain of the composition of toner such as a binder resin is not cleaved.<br>
The conditions are determined approximately to the degree where gel content in<br>
a toner does not vary between before and after kneading. Details about<br>
measurement of gel content will be described later.<br>
Here, the melt-kneading was carried out as follows. Specifically, batch<br>
type kneading was carried out using a Labo Plastomill 4C 150 type (by Toyo<br>
Seiki Seisaku-sho, Ltd.) and a melt kneaded mixture of toner was obtained.<br>
The toner amount used in kneading was 45 g, the heating temperature was<br>
130°C, the rotation number was 50 rpm, and the kneading time was 15 minutes.<br>
In the toner of the first aspect of the invention, 172 flow beginning<br>
temperature Tma obtained from capillary type flow tester is required to be<br>
130°C to 200°C, preferably 145°C to 180°C. If the Tma is lower than this range,<br>
satisfactory hot offset resistance can not be obtained, besides, anti-heat<br><br>
preservability may be deteriorated. In addition, toner offset to the fixing<br>
member such as fixing roller is cleaned with e.g. a cleaning device on a fixing<br>
roller, which toner may cause such phenomenon that accumulated toner melts<br>
again and is transferred to fixing member, leading to contamination. Tma<br>
higher than this range is not preferable because offset resistance becomes<br>
extremely satisfactory, but fixing property at low temperatures is impaired, thus<br>
not preferable.<br>
The temperature difference ΔTm between 1/2 flow beginning<br>
temperature of the toner Tma and 1/2 flow beginning temperature of toner<br>
mixture Tmb, in which toner compositions are sufficiently evenly melted and<br>
dispersed by sufficient melting, shearing, and kneading of the toner, is required<br>
to be 0°C to 20°C, preferably 5°C to 20°C, more preferably 7°C to 15°C, most<br>
preferably 7°C to 10°C. Larger temperature difference than this range causes<br>
fusion of resins having a low softening point to a fixing member easily even if the<br>
1/2 flown-out temperature of toner Tma satisfies 130°C to 200°C, and therefore<br>
it is impossible to expect sufficient hot offset resistance. Further, it is required<br>
to have appropriate temperature difference. This indicates that toner has a<br>
core/shell structure, which makes mechanical strength of toner strong and also<br>
has an effect of reducing exposure of wax to the surface, thus enabling<br>
prevention of wax spent. Furthermore, even if resin having low molecular<br>
mass is used in a toner, less contamination of photoconductor, developing<br>
member, carrier, etc. by toner occurs because the resin on the surface serves as a<br><br>
shell.<br>
Here, the 1/2 flown-out temperature is measured using, for example, a<br>
capillary type flow tester (CFT-500C, by Shimadzu Corporation) and is the value<br>
representing the temperature at the time when half of the sample has flown out.<br>
Measurement was carried out under the condition of Load: 30 kg, Die<br>
diameter: 1 mm, Temperature rising rate: 3°C/min.<br>
Preferably, the toner of the first aspect of the invention has volume<br>
average particle diameter (Dv), volume average particle diameter (DvVnumber<br>
average particle diameter (Dn), average circularity, gel content, molecular mass<br>
peak, glass-transition temperature (Tg), etc. as described below.<br>
The volume average particle diameter (Dv) of the toner is, for example,<br>
preferably 3 µm to 7 µm, more preferably 4 to 7, most preferably 5 to 6. Here,<br>
the volume average particle diameter is defined as: Dv = [(∑(nD3)/ ∑n)1/3, where<br>
n is number of particle and D is particle diameter.<br>
When the volume average particle diameter is less than 3 µm, the toner<br>
of two-component developer is likely to fuse onto the carrier surfaces as a result<br>
of stirring in the developing unit for a long period and the charging capability of<br>
carrier may be deteriorated. On the other hand, one-component developer is<br>
likely to cause filming to the developing roller or fusion to the members such as<br>
blade for reducing toner layers thickness. If the volume average particle<br>
diameter is more than 7 µm, obtaining high-resolution, high-quality images<br>
becomes difficult, and the particle diameter of toner may fluctuate when toner<br><br>
inflow/outflow is implemented in the developer.<br>
The ratio (Dv/Dn) of the volume average particle diameter (Dv) to the<br>
number average particle diameter (Dn) in the toner is preferably 1.25 or less,<br>
more preferably 1.00 to 1.20, and most preferably 1.10 to 1.20.<br>
When the ratio is 1.25 or less, the toner is likely to have relatively sharp<br>
particle size distribution, thus improving the fixing properties. When the ratio<br>
is less than 1.00, the toner of two-component developer is likely to fuse onto the<br>
carrier surfaces due to stirring in a developing unit for a long period, thereby de<br>
grading charging capability of the carrier or cleaning properties, and<br>
one-component developer is likely to cause filming to the developing roller or<br>
fusion to the member such as blade for reducing toner layer thickness. When<br>
the ratio is more than 1.20, obtaining high-resolution, high-quality images<br>
becomes difficult, and the particle diameter of toner may fluctuate when toner<br>
inflow/outflow is implemented in the developer.<br>
The volume average particle diameter and the ratio (Dv/Dn) of the<br>
volume average particle diameter to the number average particle diameter are<br>
measured using a measuring device for particle size distribution of toner<br>
according to a Coulter counter method. Examples of the measuring device<br>
include a Coulter counter TA-II, and Coulter Multisizer IIe (both by Beckman<br>
Coulter Inc.). In the invention, measurement is carried out using the Coulter<br>
counter TA-II connected with an Interface producing a number distribution and<br>
a volume distribution (by The Institute of Japanese Union of Scientists &amp;<br><br>
Engineers) and a personal computer PC9801 (by NEC Corporation).<br>
The average circularity can be obtained by dividing the circumference of<br>
an equivalent circle having the same area as the projected area of the shape of<br>
toner particle by the circumference of actual toner particle. For example, the<br>
average circularity is preferably 0.94 to 0.99 and more preferably 0.950 to 0.98.<br>
Preferably, the amount of the particle having an average circularity of less than<br>
0.94 is 15% or less.<br>
When the average circularity is less than 0.94, sufficient transfer<br>
properties or high quality images with no dust may not be obtained. When the<br>
average circularity is more than 0.99, it is likely to cause image smears resulted<br>
from cleaning failures on the photoconductor or transfer belt in the<br>
image-forming system utilizing cleaning blades. Specifically, in the case of<br>
image formation having large image area such as photo graphic images, a<br>
residual toner resulted from forming untransferred images on the<br>
photoconductor due to paper feed failure or the like, is accumulated and causes<br>
background smear on the formed image, or pollutes charging rollers which<br>
contact-charge the photoconductor and inhibit charging rollers to exhibit<br>
original charging ability.<br>
The average circularity is measured, for example, by the optical<br>
detection zone method in which a suspension containing toner is passed through<br>
an image-detection zone disposed on a plate, the particle images of the toner are<br>
optically detected by CCD camera, and the obtained particle images are<br><br>
analyzed. For example, the flow-type particle image analyzer FPIA-2100 by<br>
Sysmex Corp. may be employed for such method.<br>
The THF insoluble content of toner refers to polymer gel content with a<br>
crosslinked structure. Gel content contained in a toner is preferably 10% by<br>
mass to 55% by mass, more preferably 10% by mass to 40% by mass, and most<br>
preferably 15% by mass to 30% by mass. If the gel content is less than this<br>
range, improvement of hot offset resistance can not be expected. Conversely,<br>
larger gel content may deteriorate fixing property at low temperatures.<br>
Here, the gel content is measured as follows. 1 g of toner is weighed, to<br>
this, 100 g of tetrahydrofuran (THF) is added, and left at 10°C for 20 hours to 30<br>
hours. After 20 hours to 30 hours, gel fraction, THF insoluble components,<br>
absorbs THF as a solvent, and swells to precipitate, and then this is separated<br>
with a filter paper. Separated gel fraction is heated at 120°C for 3 hours,<br>
absorbed THF is volatilized, and then mass is weighed. Thus, gel fraction is<br>
measured.<br>
Preferably, the molecular mass distribution of the toner measured by gel<br>
permeation chromatography (GPC) has at least one peak in a molecular mass<br>
region of 5,000 to 25,000. Molecular mass 8,000 to 20,000 in the molecular<br>
mass distribution is more preferable, most preferably molecular mass 13,000 to<br>
18,000. The toner having molecular mass peak in this range has satisfactory<br>
balance of fixing property at low temperatures and hot offset resistance.<br>
Here, the molecular mass distribution is measured according to the<br><br>
following method. First, the column inside the heat chamber of 40°C is<br>
stabilized, To the column at this temperature, THF as a solvent is drained at a<br>
current speed of 1ml/minute and 50 µl to 200 µl of THF sample solution of the<br>
toner whereof a sample density is adjusted to 0.05% by mass to 0.6% by mass, is<br>
poured and measured. In the measurement of molecular mass of the sample, a<br>
molecular mass distribution of the sample is calculated from the relationship<br>
between log values of the analytical curve made from several monodisperse<br>
polystyrene standard samples and counted numbers. The standard<br>
polystyrene sample for making analytical curves is preferably the one with a<br>
molecular mass of 6x102, 2.1x102, 4x102 1.75x104, 5.1x104, L1x105, 3.9x105,<br>
8.6x105, 2x106 and 4.48x106 by Pressure Chemical Co. or Toyo Soda<br>
Manufacturing Co., Ltd. and at least using approximately 10 pieces of the<br>
standard polystyrene sample is preferable. A refractive index (RI) detector may<br>
be used for above-mentioned detector.<br>
The glass-transition temperature (Tg) of the toner is not particularly<br>
limited and can be appropriately selected according to the purpose, for example,<br>
preferably 50°C to 70°C, more preferably 55°C to 65°C. In the toner, polyester<br>
resins which underwent a crosslinking reaction and/or an elongation reaction<br>
are existed together, which allows the toner to show satisfactory preservability<br>
although the toner has low glass-transition temperature compared with a<br>
conventional polyester resin.<br>
If the glass-transition temperature (Tg) is less than 50°C, the anti-heat<br><br>
preservability of toner may be deteriorated. If Tg exceeds 70°C, the fixing<br>
property at low temperatures may not be sufficient.<br>
The glass-transition temperature can be measured using, for example,<br>
TG-DSC system TAS-100 (by Rigaku Denki Co., Ltd.) according to the following<br>
method. Initially, about 10 mg of toner is placed in an aluminum sample vessel.<br>
The vessel is placed on a holder unit, which is then set in an electric furnace.<br>
The sample is heated from room temperature to 150°C at a temperature rising<br>
rate of 10°C/min. After being allowed to stand at 150°C for 10 minutes, the<br>
sample is cooled to room temperature and allowed to stand for 10 minutes.<br>
Then, in a nitrogen flow, DSC measurement is carried out using a differential<br>
scanning calorimeter (DSC) while heating the sample to 150°C at a temperature<br>
rising rate of 10°C/min. Glass-transition temperature (Tg) is determined using<br>
the analyzing system of the TG-DSC system TAS-100 system as a temperature<br>
at the intersection of the base line and a tangential line of the endothermic curve<br>
near the glass-transition temperature (Tg).<br>
The toner of the invention, in a second aspect, comprises a toner<br>
material and resin fine particles on the surface of the toner, wherein the toner<br>
has a glass-transition temperature (Tg) of from 30°C to 46°C, the resin fine<br>
particles have a glass-transition temperature (Tg) of from 50°C to 70°C, and<br>
wherein, when the toner has been masticated with Labo Plastomill, the toner<br>
has a 1/2 flown-out temperature of from 95°C to 120°C, and before the<br>
mastication of the toner, the toner has a 1/2 flown-out temperature of from<br><br>
120°C to 145°C.<br>
In the toner of the second aspect of the invention, resin fine particles<br>
adhered to the surface of the toner is solider than the resin inside of toner.<br>
Thus, when heat characteristic is measured with a flow tester, the heat<br>
characteristic cannot be evaluated appropriately because of influence of the<br>
resin particles adhered to the surface. Therefore, appropriate evaluation<br>
becomes possible by masticating with certain energy to destroy a layer of resin<br>
fine particles of the surface and by measuring heat characteristic of the toner<br>
layer inside the particle. With respect to the conditions under which toner is<br>
masticated with Labo Plastomill, if shearing energy is high, not only resin<br>
particles on the toner particle surface but also resin molecules of the toner layer<br>
inside the toner particle are cut, making it impossible to achieve goal, that is, to<br>
measure heat characteristic of the toner layer inside the toner. In contrast, if<br>
shearing energy is weak, it is impossible to evaluate due to the influence of resin<br>
fine particles on the surface. Therefore, the condition under which toner is<br>
masticated with Labo Plastomill is such that resin fine particle layer of the toner<br>
surface is destroyed, but the toner layer inside of a toner particle is not destroyed.<br>
Specifically, evaluation is carried out under the following conditions.<br><labo plastomill kneading condition><br>
Mixer	:R60<br>
Temperature	: 130°C<br>
Time	: 15minutes<br><br>
Sample amount 45 g<br>
Mixer rotation number: 50 rpm<br>
In the case of pulverized toner, it is not necessary to masticate a toner<br>
because resin fine particles are not adhered to the surface. However, the toner<br>
having a core/shell structure of the invention needs this evaluation because<br>
when the toner is used in a copying machine, this influence of toner surface and<br>
heat characteristic inside of the toner influences largely on fixing quality.<br>
When the toner is masticated with Labo Plastomill, 1/2 flown-out<br>
temperature is 95°C to 120°C. The 1/2 flown-out temperature before the<br>
mastication of toner is 120°C to 145°C.<br>
If the 1/2 flown-out temperature after mastication with the Labo<br>
Plastomill is less than 95°C, hot offset and remelting of toner from a fixing<br>
cleaning roller may be likely to occur. If the 1/2 flown-out temperature exceeds<br>
120°C, remelting of toner is improved, but fixing property at low temperatures is<br>
not satisfactory. The value of flow tester before mastication is a range for<br>
obtaining optimum value after mastication. If this value is not satisfied, it is<br>
difficult to satisfy both fixing property at low temperatures and hot offset<br>
property.<br>
Preferably, THF insoluble content (gel content) contained in the toner of<br>
the second aspect is 5% by mass to 25% by mass. This allows the toner<br>
adhering to a cleaning roller to have high elasticity, making it difficult for the<br>
toner to remelt even if the temperature of the cleaning roller increased. In the<br><br>
case of conventional toner, remelting of toner was not serious technical problem.<br>
Specifically, it was difficult to make the glass-transition temperature (Tg) below<br>
about 55°C, thus the toner adhering to the cleaning roller of a fixing roller is a<br>
toner having high softening point because resin component having relatively<br>
high glass-transition temperature (Tg) adheres to the cleaning roller.<br>
Therefore, the conventional toner does not remelt easily after the increase of<br>
roller temperature. However, in the case of this capsule-like toner, resin<br>
having low Tg is used in the toner inside the particle in order to enable fixing at<br>
lower temperature. Thus, the toner adhering to the fixing roller is such a toner<br>
having low Tg, leading to easy occurrence of remelting from the cleaning roller,<br>
and this characteristic of the toner is in a trade-off relationship with fixing at<br>
low temperatures. As a result of investigation of this toner adhered to the<br>
fixing cleaning roller, it was found that the adhered toner had remarkable fewer<br>
wax component which was added during initial time. When molecular mass<br>
distribution of the adhered toner was measured by GPC, it was observed that<br>
higher-molecular mass components of resins constituting toner adhered,<br>
indicating that toner components fixing are low-molecular mass components<br>
having affinity to a paper.<br>
In this case, in the heat fixing unit in which a recording medium is<br>
passed through between a heating member and pressure member and while the<br>
recording medium being conveyed, toner images on the recording medium are<br>
fixed, the toner to be fixed adheres to a heating roller in trace amount. The<br><br>
adhered toner is a component which does not contain wax in the particle, or a<br>
toner component which is a component with high elasticity and cannot fix.<br>
Therefore, conditions under which remelting of toner from the fixing<br>
cleaning roller does not occur are as follows.<br>
(1)	The amount of adhering to a roller is as small as possible.<br>
(2)	The adhering toner is high-molecular components of toner and when<br>
components with high softening point or components with high elasticity<br>
adhered, the toner does not remelt easily.<br>
(3)	Toner in which wax is dispersed uniformly in the particle does not adhere to<br>
a cleaning roller easily.<br>
(4)	The sharper the distribution in a particle size distribution is, the less the<br>
adhesion of toner in trace amount occur because heat is uniformly applied to<br>
toner at the time of fixing, thus smaller amount of toner adheres to a fixing<br>
cleaning roller.<br>
It is estimated that fixing to a paper by a roller fixing or belt fixing<br>
begins at an effective temperature of near 70°C to 100°C in recent energy saving<br>
copiers, printers, facsimiles, etc. For enabling melting of toner, toner must<br>
begin to flow near this temperature, thus it is said that toner must be softened<br>
and begin to fix at least near 90°C to 110°C.<br>
However, in order for a toner to be softened at 90°C, glass transition<br>
must be 46°C or less based on preservability data. The glass-transition<br>
temperature (Tg) of such polymer is also relates to molecular mass. Normally,<br><br>
when the glass-transition temperature (Tg) of toner becomes 46°C or less, fixing<br>
ability becomes satisfactory, but preservability is not satisfied.<br>
Therefore, in the toner of the second aspect of the invention, toner is<br>
designed by a binder so that the toner has a glass-transition temperature (Tg) of<br>
30°C to 46°C, which is extremely low temperature, and resin fine particles<br>
having a glass transition of 50°C to 70°C are present on the surface layer of the<br>
particle by 0.3% by mass to 2.0% by mass relative to toner particle. Particles<br>
uniformly coating toner particles serve as particles constituting pseudocapsule<br>
that protect binder having low softening from heat. The reason for the effect<br>
for hot offset, fixing property at low temperatures, and anti-heat preservability<br>
is that the binder resin of the toner surface has high-molecular mass by a urea<br>
bond resulting from reaction of prepolymer and amines, and part of the surface<br>
has a network structure and adopts three-dimensional structure which is<br>
relative strong to stress.<br>
Further, while resin fine particles having the same heat characteristic<br>
as that of a conventional toner are used on the surface layer of the particle,<br>
inside the particle, polyester resin having low Tg is used as a toner binder,<br>
which is a structure advantageous to fixing property at low temperatures<br>
compared to an uniformly kneaded pulverized toner. FIG. 17 shows this toner<br>
particle model. 620, 621, 622, 623, and 624 represent a toner, resin fine<br>
particle, wax, polyester resin not being modified, and modified polyester resin,<br>
respectively. During fixing, the resin fine particle 621 coating the toner surface<br><br>
layer must respond to the thermal capacity of the heating roller quickly and<br>
make the toner particle binder soak out of surface layer. The balance between<br>
anti-heat preservability and the degree of soaking out is controlled by the<br>
amount of resin fine particles to be adhered.<br>
Therefore, the average particle diameter of the resin fine particles<br>
adhered to the toner surface is preferably 10 nm to 200 nm. The amount of the<br>
adhering resin fine particles is 0.3% by mass to 2% by mass. If the average<br>
particle diameter is less than 10 nm, the resin fine particles do not work<br>
properly, and if it exceeds 200 nm, the resin fine particles remain thickly on the<br>
surface layer, causing the decrease of fixing ability.<br>
The glass-transition temperature (Tg) of the toner is required to be 30°C<br>
to 46°C, the range enabling lower temperature fixing. If the Tg of the toner is<br>
less than 30°C, the toner is difficult to be made into particle, and if it is more<br>
than 46°C, fixing property at low temperatures may not be obtained effectively.<br>
The glass-transition temperature of the toner can be measured in the<br>
same way as in the first aspect.<br>
Here, the residue rate (adhesion rate) of the resin fine particles can be<br>
measured by analyzing substances not resulting from toner particles but from<br>
resin fine particles with a pyrolysis gas-chromatography mass spectrometer,<br>
and by calculating the peak area. Detector is preferably a mass spectrometer,<br>
but is not particularly limited.<br>
The volume average particle diameter (Dv) of the toner of the second<br><br>
aspect of the invention is preferably 3.0 µm to 7.0 µm, more preferably 3.0 µm to<br>
6.0 µm. The ratio of the volume average particle diameter (Dv) to the number<br>
average particle diameter (Dn) is preferably 1.25 or less, more preferably 1.00 ≤<br>
Dv/Dn ≤ 1.20. This makes it possible to obtain a toner allowing high resolution<br>
arid quality. This allows the toner to be excellent in any of anti-heat<br>
preservabihty, fixing property at low temperatures, and hot offset resistance.<br>
Particularly, fixing property at low temperatures had been achieved by lowering<br>
Tg; however, there was a limitation for lowering Tg in terms of preservability.<br>
Thus, by making the particle diameter small, further lower temperature fixing<br>
was made possible. On the other hand, if the toner contains particles having a<br>
particle diameter of 8 µm or more in large quantity, not only fixing ability but<br>
also tone is impaired. From the point of quality, 2% by mass or less of the<br>
particles having a particle diameter of 8 urn or more do not cause large<br>
drawback. Further, in a two-component developer, even when toner<br>
inflow/outflow is implemented for a long period, the particle diameter of toner in<br>
the developer fluctuates less, and even in the case of stirring in a developing<br>
device for a long period, satisfactory and stable developability can be obtained.<br>
Generally, it is said that the smaller the particle diameter of toner is, the more<br>
advantageous to produce high resolution and quality images. However, it is<br>
disadvantageous for transferability and cleanability.<br>
When the volume average particle diameter is smaller than the<br>
above-mentioned range, the toner in a two-component developer adheres to the<br><br>
surface of a carrier due to stirring in a developing device for a long period,<br>
resulting in deterioration of chargeability of the carrier. The toner in a<br>
one-component developer tends to cause filming over a developing roller and<br>
adhere to a cleaning member such as a blade for reducing toner layer thickness.<br>
The particle diameter distribution around 3 µm largely relates to these<br>
phenomena, in particular, when the particles with a particle diameter of 3 µm or<br>
less by Coulter method exceed 2% by mass, it causes adhesion to carrier or<br>
adversely affects stability of charge at high level. In addition, cleanability as<br>
well as shape remarkably deteriorates.<br>
Conversely, when the volume average particle diameter of the toner is<br>
larger than 6.0 µm, exceeding the range defined in the invention, obtaining<br>
high-resolution, high-quality images becomes difficult, and the particle diameter<br>
of toner fluctuates in many cases when toner inflow/outflow is implemented in<br>
the developer. This is also true of the toner with a volume average particle<br>
diameter/number average particle diameter more than 1.20.<br>
The volume average particle diameter and the ration of volume average<br>
particle diameter to the number average particle diameter (Dv/Dn) can be<br>
measured in the same way as in the first aspect.<br>
In the toner of the second aspect of the invention, molecular mass<br>
distribution of the binder component of the toner is measured by the method<br>
shown below. About 1 g of toner is precisely weighed in a conical flask, then 10<br>
g to 20 g of tetrahydrofuran (THF) is added to prepare a THF solution with a<br><br>
binder concentration of from 5% to 10%. The column inside the heat chamber<br>
of 40°C is stabilized. To the column at this temperature, THF as a solvent is<br>
drained at a current speed of 1ml/minute and 20 µl of THF sample solution is<br>
poured. Molecular mass of the sample is calculated from the relationship<br>
between log values of the analytical curve made from several monodisperse<br>
polystyrene standard samples and retention time. The analytical curve is<br>
prepared using a polystyrene standard sample. The monodisperse polystyrene<br>
standard sample is, for example, a product by Tosoh Corporation, having a<br>
molecular mass of 2.7x102 to 6.2x106. A refractive index (RI) detector can be<br>
used as the detector. The columns are, for example, combinations of TSKgel,<br>
G1000H, G2000H, G2500H, G3000H, G4000H, G5000H, G6000H, G7000H and<br>
GMH, all of which are available from Tosoh Corporation.<br>
THF soluble component has a molecular mass distribution such that a<br>
main peak molecular mass is preferably from 2,500 to 10,000, more preferably<br>
from 2,500 to 8,000, most preferably from 2,500 to 6,000. When the amount of<br>
the component having the molecular mass less than 2,500 is increased,<br>
anti-heat preservability of the resultant toner tends to deteriorate. When the<br>
amount of the component having a molecular mass greater than 10,000 is<br>
increased, fixing property at low temperatures of the resultant toner simply deteriorates. However, a balance control of the content can prevent the<br>
deterioration. A content of a component having a molecular mass greater than<br>
30,000 is from 1% to 10%, and preferably from 3% to 6%, although depending on<br><br>
the toner material.<br>
The number average molecular mass of the THF soluble component is<br>
1,500 to 15,000. 1,500 or less results in difficulty of pigment dispersion and<br>
control of making into particles during emulsion, causing a problem in wax<br>
dispersibility, and more than 15,000 makes it difficult to form particles.<br>
The shape and diameter distribution, based on the number, of the toner<br>
of the second aspect of the invention can be measured, for example, by a flow<br>
type particle image analyzer, FPIA-2100 by Sysmex Corporation. The<br>
diameter distribution by a flow type particle image analyzer is more accurate<br>
than that by Coulter method in the measurement of particle less than 2 µm.<br>
The shape is represented by circularity. The circularity can be measured by<br>
the method described later, the circularity is the value calculated by dividing the<br>
circumference of an equivalent circle having the same projected area as the<br>
projected area of toner particle by the circumference of actual toner particle.<br>
Therefore, the circularity of perfect circle is 1.000. As the value becomes<br>
smaller from 1, the shape tend to become spindle shaped (ellipse shaped).<br>
The average circularity of the toner of the second aspect of the invention<br>
is 0.900 to 0.960, and the toner preferably has spindle shape as shown in FIG. 22.<br>
The toner having an average circularity less than 0.900 has irregular shape and<br>
sufficient transferability or high quality images with no dust cannot be obtained.<br>
Particles having irregular shape have many contact points with smooth media<br>
such as a photoconductor, and charge concentrates on the top of projection at the<br><br>
high points. Thus, particles having irregular shape have relatively stronger<br>
van der Waals force and image force than spherical particles. Therefore, in the<br>
case of toners where irregular particles and spherical particles are mixed, in an<br>
electrostatic transfer step, spherical particles move selectively and resulted in<br>
dropouts in letter images or line images. Moreover, the residue toner must be<br>
removed for the next developing step, leading to the requirement for a cleaning<br>
unit, or problems occur such as low toner yield (the rate of toner to be used in<br>
image forming). The circularity of pulverized toner measured by this analyzer<br>
is normally 0.910 to 0.920.<br>
The average circularity can be measured in the same way as in the first<br>
aspect.<br>
The production method or material of the toner according to the first<br>
and second aspects of the invention is not particularly limited as long as the<br>
above-mentioned conditions are satisfied, and can be appropriately selected<br>
according to the purpose. For example, the binder resin to be used is preferably<br>
polyester resin in terms of fixing property at low temperatures.<br>
Those prepared by the following way is suitable as the toner.<br>
Specifically, toner material containing at least active hydrogen group containing<br>
compounds and reactive polymers thereof is dissolved in an organic solvent to<br>
prepare toner solution, then the toner solution is dispersed into an aqueous<br>
medium to prepare dispersion, the active hydrogen group containing compounds<br>
and reactive polymers thereof are allowed to react in the aqueous medium to<br><br>
generate an adhesive base material in particle form, and the organic solvent is<br>
removed to obtain toner.<br>
The above-mentioned production method of polymerized toner has high<br>
selectivity of resin and in the method, polyester resin having high fixing<br>
property at low temperatures can be used. In addition, because of the excellent<br>
ability to form particles and easily controlled particle diameter, particle size<br>
distribution and shape, the toner produced by the above-mentioned production<br>
method is preferable.<br>
The toner material contains at least active hydrogen group containing<br>
compounds and reactive polymers thereof, binder resin, releasing agent,<br>
adhesive base material produced by reaction with colorant, and other element<br>
such as resin fine particles, charge controlling agent, and the like as necessary.<br>
-Adhesive base material-<br>
The adhesive base material may exhibit adhesiveness with recording<br>
medium such as paper and contain adhesive polymer produced from a reaction<br>
between the active hydrogen group containing compounds and reactive<br>
polymers thereof and may also contain binder resin selected from known binder<br>
resins.<br>
The average molecular mass (Mw) of adhesive base material is not<br>
particularly limited and can be appropriately selected according to the purpose.<br>
For example, it is preferably 1,000 and more, more preferably 2,000 to<br>
10,000,000 and most preferably 3,000 to 1,000,000.<br><br>
If the average molecular mass is less than 1,000, hot offset resistance<br>
may be deteriorated.<br>
The storage modulus of the adhesive base material is not particularly<br>
limited and may be selected according to the purpose. For example, the<br>
temperature TG', at which the storage modulus determined at 20Hz is<br>
10.000dyne/cm2, is normally 100°C or more and preferably from 110°C to 200°C.<br>
If the temperature TG' is less than 100°C, hot offset resistance may be<br>
deteriorated.<br>
The viscosity of adhesive base material is not particularly limited and<br>
may be selected accordingly. For example, the temperature Tn, at which the<br>
viscosity determined at 20Hz is 1,000 poises, is normally 180°C or less and<br>
preferably from 90°C to 160°C. If the temperature (Tn) is more than 180°C,<br>
fixing ability at low temperature may be deteriorated.<br>
From the viewpoint of simultaneous pursuit of hot offset resistance and<br>
fixing ability at low temperature, the temperature TG' is preferably higher than<br>
the temperature Tn.. Specifically, the difference between TG' and Tn, TG' - Tn,<br>
is preferably 0°C or more, and more preferably 10°C or more and most<br>
preferably 20°C and more. The higher the difference, the better the effect will<br>
be.<br>
From the viewpoint of simultaneous pursuit of hot offset resistance and<br>
fixing ability at low temperature, the difference between TG' and Tq is<br>
preferably from 0°C to 100°C, more preferably from 10°C to 90°C and most<br><br>
preferably from 20°C to 80°C.<br>

and may be selected accordingly. Suitable examples thereof are polyester resin,<br>
and the like.<br>

(B) as an active hydrogen group -containing compound, and isocyanate<br>
group containing polyester prepolymer (A) as a polymer reactive with active<br>
hydrogen group containing compound in the aqueous medium.<br>

as well as a urea bond. A molar ratio of the urea bond content to the<br>
urethane bond content is preferably 100/0 to 10/90, more preferably 80/20 to<br>

— Active Hydrogen Group containing Compound —<br>
The active hydrogen group containing compound functions as an<br>
elongation initiator or crosslinking agent at the time of elongation reactions<br>
or crosslinking reactions with the polymer reactive with aforesaid compounds<br>
in the aqueous medium.<br>
The active hydrogen group containing compounds are not<br>
particularly limited as long as containing active hydrogen group, and may be<br>
selected accordingly. For example, if a polymer reactive with the active<br>
hydrogen group containing compounds is an isocyanate group containing<br>
polyester prepolymer (A), from the viewpoint of ability to increase molecular<br>
mass by reactions such as elongation reaction, crosslinking reaction, or the<br>
like, with the isocyanate group containing polyester prepolymer (A), amines<br>
(B) may be suitably used.<br>
Active hydrogen groups are not particularly limited and may be<br>
selected accordingly. Examples include hydroxyl groups such as alcoholic<br>
hydroxyl group and phenolic hydroxyl group, amino groups, carboxyl groups,<br>
mercapto groups, and the like. These may be used alone or in combination.<br><br>

mixture of diamine (Bl) with a small amount of polyamine having 3 or more<br>
valence (B2) are especially preferable.<br>
Examples of diamine (Bl) include aromatic diamine, alicyclic diamine<br>

the amines (B), [NCO]/[NHx], is preferably from 1/3 to 3/1, more preferably from<br>
1/2 to 2/1 and most preferably from 1/1.5 to 1.5/1.<br>
When the mixture equivalent ratio [NCO]/[NHx] is less than 1/3, fixing<br>
ability at low temperature may deteriorate, and when it is more than 3/1, the<br>
molecular mass of ureα-modified polyester becomes low, possibly imparing hot<br><br>

Generally, the equivalent mixing ratio, [NCO] / [OH], of isocyanate<br>
group [NCO] of polyisocyanate (PIC) to hydroxyl group [OH] of active hydrogen<br>
group containing polyester resin such as hydroxyl group containing polyester<br>
resin at the time of reaction, is preferably 5/1 to 1/1, more preferably 4/1 to 1.2/1<br>
and most preferably 3/1 to 1.5/1.<br>
If the value of isocyanate group [NCO] is more than 5, fixing property at<br>
low temperature may be deteriorated, and if it is less than 1, off-set resistance<br>
may be deteriorated.<br>
The content of polyisocyanate (PIC) in the isocyanate group containing<br>
polyester prepolymer (A) is not particularly limited and may be adjusted<br>
accordingly. It is preferably 0.5% by mass to 40% by mass, more preferably 1%<br>
by mass to 30% by mass and most preferably 2% by mass to 20% by mass.<br>
If the content is less than 0.5% by mass, hot off-set resistance may be<br>
deteriorated, making it difficult to pursue anti-heat preservability and fixing<br>
property at low temperature simultaneously and if it is more than 40% by mass,<br>
fixing property at low temperature may be deteriorated.<br>
The average quantity of isocyanate group contained within one<br>
molecule of the isocyanate group containing polyester prepolymer (A) is<br><br>
preferably 1 or more, more preferably 1.2 to 5 and most preferably 1.5 to 4.<br>
If the average quantity of isocyanate group is less than 1, molecular<br>
mass of polyester resin (RMPE) modified with urea bond formation group<br>
becomes low and hot off-set resistance may be deteriorated.<br>
The average molecular mass (Mw) of the polymer reactive with active<br>
hydrogen group containing compound, in terms of molecular mass distribution<br>
by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) of tetrahydrofuran (THF) soluble<br>
component, is preferably 1,000 to 30,000 and more preferably 1,500 to 15,000.<br>
If the average molecular mass (Mw) is less than 1,000, anti heat preservability<br>
may be deteriorated and if it is more than 30,000, fixing property at low<br>
temperature may be deteriorated.<br>
The measurement of molecular mass distribution by gel permeation<br>
chromatography (GPC), for example, may be performed as follow.<br>
First, the column inside the heat chamber of 40°C is stabilized. At this<br>
temperature, tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a column solvent is drained at a current<br>
speed of 1ml/minute and 50µl to 200µl of tetrahydrofuran sample fluid of the<br>
resin whereof a sample density is adjusted to 0.05% by mass to 0.6% by mass, is<br>
poured and measured. In the measurement of molecular mass of the sample, a<br>
molecular mass distribution of the sample is calculated from the relationship<br>
between log values of the analytical curve made from several monodisperse<br>
polystyrene standard samples and counted numbers. The standard<br>
polystyrene sample for making analytical curves is preferably the one with a<br><br>
molecular mass of 6x102,2-lx102, 4x102,1.75X104, l.1x105, 3.9x105, 8.6x105,<br>
2x106 and 4.48x106 by Pressure Chemical Co. or Toyo Soda Manufacturing Co.,<br>
Ltd. and at least using approximately 10 pieces of the standard polystyrene<br>
sample is preferable. A refractive index (RI) detector may be used for<br>
above-mentioned detector.<br>
--Binder resin-<br>
The binder resin is not particularly limited and may be selected<br>
accordingly. Examples thereof are polyester resin, and the like and unmodified<br>
polyester resin, that is a polyester resin not being modified, is especially<br>
preferable.<br>
Containing unmodified polyester resin in a toner can improve fixing<br>
property at low temperature and glossiness.<br>
Examples of unmodified polyester resin include the one similar to urea<br>
bond formation group containing polyester resin such as polycondensation of<br>
polyol (PO) and polycarboxylic acid (PC), and the like. The unmodified<br>
polyester resin of which a part is compatible with the urea bond formation<br>
group containing polyester resin (RMPE), that is, having similar structures that<br>
are compatible to each other, is preferable in terms of fixing property at low<br>
temperature and hot off-set resistance.<br>
The average molecular mass (Mw) of unmodified polyester resin, in<br>
terms of the molecular mass distribution by GPC (Gel permeation<br>
chromatography) of tetrahydrofuran (THF) soluble component, is preferably<br><br>
1,000 to 30,000 and more preferably 1,500 to 15,000. The content of the<br>
component of which the average molecular mass (Mw) is less than 1,000, should<br>
be 8% by mass to 28% by mass in order to prevent deterioration of anti heat<br>
preservability. If the average molecular mass (Mw) is more than 30,000, fixing<br>
property at low temperature may be deteriorated.<br>
The glass transition temperature of the unmodified polyester resin is<br>
generally 30°C to 70°C, preferably 35°C to 70°C, more preferably 35°C to 50°C<br>
and most preferably 35°C to 45°C. If the glass transition temperature is less<br>
than 30°C, anti-heat preservability of the toner may be deteriorated and if it is<br>
more than 70°C, fixing property at low temperature may be insufficient.<br>
The hydroxyl value of unmodified polyester resin is preferably 5<br>
mgKOH/g or more, more preferably 10 mgKOH/g to 120 mgKOH/g and most<br>
preferably 20 mgKOH/g to 80 mgKOH/g. If the hydroxyl value is less than 5<br>
mgKOH/g, it is difficult to pursue anti-heat preservability and fixing property at<br>
low temperature simultaneously.<br>
The acid value of unmodified polyester resin is preferably 1.0 mgKOH/g<br>
to 50.0 mgKOH/g, more preferably 1.0 mgKOH/g to 45.0 mgKOH/g and most<br>
preferably 15.0 mgKOH/g to 45.0 mgKOH/g. In general, a toner tends to<br>
become electrically negative by having acid values.<br>
When unmodified polyester resin is contained in a toner, the mixing<br>
mass ratio, RMPE / PE, of urea bond formation group containing polyester resin<br>
(RMPE) to unmodified polyester resin (PE) is preferably 5/95 to 25/75 and more<br><br>
preferably 10/90 to 25/75.<br>
If the mixing mass ratio of unmodified polyester resin is more than 95,<br>
hot off set resistance may be deteriorated, making it difficult to pursue anti-heat<br>
preservability and fixing property at low temperature simultaneously, and if it is<br>
less than 25, glossiness may be deteriorated.<br>
The content of unmodified polyester resin in the binder resin, for<br>
example, is preferably 50% by mass to 100% by mass, more preferably 70% by<br>
mass to 95% by mass and most preferably 80% by mass to 90% by mass. If the<br>
content is less than 50% by mass, fixing property at low temperature or<br>
glossiness of the image may be deteriorated.<br>

The content of the colorant in the toner is not particularly limited and<br>
may be adjusted accordingly and it is preferably 1% by mass to 15% by mass<br><br>
and more preferably 3% by mass to 10% by mass.<br>
It the content is less than 1% by mass, tinctorial power of the colorant is<br>
degraded, and if the content is more than 15% by mass, a dispersion failure of<br>
pigments in the toner may occur, resulting in degradation of tinctorial power or<br>
electric properties of the toner.<br>
The colorant may be used as a master batch being combined with a<br>
resin. Such resin is not particularly limited and may be selected from known<br>
colorants accordingly. Examples thereof include polymers of styrene or<br>
substituted styrenes, styrene copolymers, polymethyl methacrylates, polybuthyl<br>
methacrylates, polyvinyl chlorides, polyvinyl acetates, polyethylenes,<br>

polyamides, polyvinyl butyral, polyacrylic acid resin, rosin, modified rosin,<br>
terpene resins, aliphatic or alicyclic hydrocarbon resins, aromatic petroleum<br>
resins, chlorinated paraffin, paraffin, and the like. These may be used alone or<br>
in combination.<br>

polyester resin, polystyrene, poly p chlorostyrene, polyvinyl toluene, and the like.<br>
Examples of styrene copolymers include styrene-p-chlorostyrene copolymer,<br>

styrene-vinyl methyl ketone copolymer, styrene-butadiene copolymer,<br>
styrene-isoprene copolymer, styrene-acrylonitrile-indene copolymer,<br>
styrene-maleic acid copolymer, styrene-maleic ester copolymer, and the like.<br>
The master batch can be obtained by mixing and kneading a resin for<br>
master batch and the colorant with high shear force, To improve interaction<br>
between colorant and resin, an organic solvent may be used. In addition, the<br>
"flushing process" in which a wet cake containing colorant can be applied<br>
directly, is preferable because it requires no drying. In the flushing process, a<br>
water-based paste containing colorant and water is mixed and kneaded with the<br>
resin and an organic solvent so that the colorant moves towards the resin, and<br>
that water and the organic solvent are removed. The materials are<br>
preferably mixed and kneaded using a triple roll mill and other high-shear<br>
dispersing devices.<br>
The releasing agent is not particularly limited and may be selected from<br>
known agents accordingly and examples include waxes, and the like.<br>
Examples of wax include carbonyl group containing wax, polyolefin wax,<br>

tristearate, distearyl maleate, and the like. Examples of polyalkanoic acid<br>
amide include dibehenyl amide and the like. Examples of polyalkyl amide<br>
include trimellitic acid tristearyl amide, and the like. Examples of dialkyl<br>

and the like.<br>
A melting point of the releasing agent is not particularly limited and<br>
may be selected accordingly. It is preferably 40°C to 160°C, more preferably<br>
50°C to 120°C, and most preferably 60°C to 90°C.<br>
When the melting point is less than 40°C, the wax may adversely affect<br>
anti-heat preservability. When the melting point is more than 160°C, it is<br>
liable to cause cold offset at the time of fixing at low temperatures.<br>
A melt viscosity of the releasing agent is preferably 5 cps to 1,000 cps,<br>
and more preferably 10 cps to 100 cps by a measurement at a temperature of<br>
20°C higher than the melting point of the wax.<br><br>
If the melt viscosity is less than 5 cps, releasing ability may be<br>
deteriorated. If the melt viscosity is more than 1,000 cps, on the other hand, it<br>
may not improve offset resistance, and fixing property at low temperature.<br>
The content of releasing agent in the toner is not particularly limited<br>
and may be adjusted accordingly and it is preferably 0% by mass to 40% by<br>
mass and more preferably 3% by mass to 30% by mass.<br>
If the content is more than 40% by mass, flowability of the toner may be<br>
deteriorated.<br>
The charge controlling agent is not particularly limited, and may be<br>
selected from known agents accordingly. The charge controlling agent is<br>
preferably made of a material with color close to transparent and/or white<br>
because colored materials may change color tone.	Examples of charge<br>
controlling agent include triphenylmethane dye, molybdic acid chelate<br>
pigment, rhodamine dye, alkoxy amine, quaternary ammonium salt such as<br>
fluoride modified quaternary ammonium salt, alkylamide, phosphoric simple<br>
substance or compound thereof, tungsten simple substance or compound<br>
thereof, fluoride activator, salicylic acid metallic salt, salicylic acid derivative<br>
metallic salt, and the like. These may be used alone or in combination.<br>

a phenol condensate by Orient Chemical Industries, Ltd.; TP-302 and TP-415<br>
of a quaternary ammonium salt molybdenum metal complex by Hodogaya<br>
Chemical Co.,' Copy charge PSY VP2038 of a quaternary ammonium salt,<br>

Co., Ltd.; quinacridone, azo pigment, and other high-molecular mass<br>
compounds having functional group of sulfonic acid, carboxyl, quaternary<br>
ammonium salt, or the like.<br>
The charge controlling agent may be dissolved and/or dispersed in the<br>
toner material after melt kneading with the master batch. The charge<br>
controlling agent may also be added directly at the time of dissolving and<br>
dispersing in the organic solvent together with the toner material. In<br>
addition, the charge controlling agent may be added onto the surface of the<br>
toner particles after toner particle production.<br>
The content of the charge controlling agent in the toner depends on<br>
the type of binder resin, presence or absence of external additives, and the<br>
dispersion process selected to use and there is no defined prescription.<br>
However, the content of charge controlling agent is preferably 0.1 part by<br>
mass to 10 parts by mass and more preferably 0.2 part by mass to 5 part by<br>
mass relative to 100 parts by mass of the binder resin, for example. When<br>
the content is less than 0.1 parts by mass, charge may not be appropriately<br><br>
controlled. If the content is more than 10 parts by mass, charge ability of<br>
the toner becomes excessively large, which lessens the effect of charge<br>
controlling agent itself and increases electrostatic attraction force with a<br>
developing roller, leading to developer flowability or image density<br>
degradation.<br>
The inorganic fine particle is not particularly limited, and may be<br>
selected from known inorganic fine particles accordingly. Specific examples of<br>

inorganic fine particle by BET method is preferably 20 m2 / g to 500 m2 / g.<br>
The content of the inorganic fine particle in the toner is preferably<br>
0.01% by mass to 5.0% by mass, more preferably 0.01% by mass to 2.0% by<br>
mass.<br>
If these fluidizers are surface-treated to increase hydrophobicity,<br>
degradation of flowability or charging ability can be prevented even under a<br><br>
high humidified condition. Examples of suitable surface treatment agents<br>
include silane coupling agents, silyl agents, silane coupling agents having<br>
fluorinated alkyl group, organic titanate coupling agents, aluminium coupling<br>
agents, silicone oils and modified silicone oils.<br>

on the photoconductor or primary transferring medium after transferring<br>
process include fatty acid metal salts such as zinc stearate, calcium stearate,<br>
stearic acid, and the like; polymeric particles manufactured by soap-free<br>

The magnetic material is not particularly limited, and may be selected<br>
from known inorganic fine particles accordingly. Examples thereof include<br>
iron powder, magnetite, ferrite, and the like. Among these, those with white<br>
color are preferable in terms of color tone.<br>

second aspect of the invention have a glass-transition temperature (Tg) of 50°C<br>

When the glass-transition temperature is less than 50°C, blocking of<br>
toner deteriorates, and when the glass-transition temperature is more than<br><br>
70°C, softening of toner particle at the time of fixing is prevented.<br>
The resin fine particles adhere to uppermost surface of toner particle<br>
after emulsification, and thereby the toner particle has a toner structure which<br>
prevents blocking of a low softening polymer inside the particle. Resin fine<br>
particles may be spherical as 621 of FIG. 17, or may be irregular. In addition,<br>
the resin fine particles may form layer so as to coat the toner surface due to the<br>
influence of an organic solvent or subsequent processes for producing toner.<br>
The resin fine particles according to the first and second aspects are<br>
not particularly limited as long as they are capable of forming an aqueous<br>
dispersion in an aqueous medium, and may be selected from known resins<br>

obtained resin solution is subjected to precipitation by adding a poor solvent or<br>
cooling after heating and dissolving, the solvent is sequentially removed to<br>
thereby obtain resin fine particles, and then the obtained resin fine particles are<br>

dispersing agent, thereby obtaining the aqueous dispersion of the resin fine<br>
particles; (7) a preparation method of aqueous dispersion of the resin fine<br>

high-speed-shear disperser, friction disperser, high-pressure-jet disperser,<br>
supersonic disperser, and the like. Of these, high-speed-shear disperser is<br>
preferable, because it is capable of controlling particle diameter of the dispersing<br>
element (oilspot) to be within a range of 2 µm to 20 µm.<br>
When the high-speed shear disperser is used, conditions like rotating<br>
speed, dispersion time, dispersion temperature, and the like are not particularly<br>
limited and may be adjusted accordingly. However, rotating speed is<br><br>
preferably l,000rpm to 30,000rpm and more preferably 5,000rpm to 20,000rpm.<br>
The dispersion time is preferably 0.1minute to 5 minutes for batch method.<br>
The dispersion temperature is preferably 0°C to 150°C and more preferably<br>
40°C to 98°C under pressure. Generally speaking, the dispersion is more<br>
easily carried out at a high dispersing temperature.<br>
An exemplary manufacturing process of the toner according to the first<br>
and second aspects of the invention in which toner is manufactured by<br>
producing adhesive base material in a form of particles is described below.<br>
In the process in which toner is manufactured by producing adhesive<br>
base material in a form of particles, a preparation of an aqueous medium phase,<br>
a preparation of toner solution, a preparation of dispersion, an addition of<br>
aqueous medium and other processes such as synthesis of active hydrogen<br>
group -containing compound and reactive prepolymer thereof or synthesis of<br>
active hydrogen group containing compound, and the like, for example.<br>
The preparation of aqueous medium phase may be, for example, done<br>
by dispersing resin fine particles in the aqueous medium. The amount of resin<br>
fine particles added to the aqueous medium is not limited and may be adjusted<br>
accordingly and it is preferably 0.5% by mass to 10% by mass, for example.<br>
The preparation of toner solution may be done by dissolving and/or<br>
dispersing toner materials such as active hydrogen group containing compound,<br>
reactive polymer thereof, colorant, releasing agent, charge controlling agent and<br>
unmodified polyester resin, and the like in the organic solvent.<br><br>
These toner materials except reactive polymer (prepolymer) with active<br>
hydrogen group containing compound may be added and blended in the<br>
aqueous medium when resin fine particles are being dispersed in the aqueous<br>
medium in the aqueous medium phase preparation, or they may be added into<br>
the aqueous medium phase together with toner solution when toner solution is<br>
being added into the aqueous medium phase.<br>
The preparation of dispersion may be carried out by emulsifying<br>
and/or dispersing the previously prepared toner solution in the previously<br>
prepared aqueous medium phase. At the time of emulsifying and/or<br>
dispersing, the active hydrogen group containing compound and the polymer<br>
reactive with the compound are subjected to elongation and/or crosslinking<br>
reaction, thereby forming the adhesive base material.<br>
The adhesive base material (e.g. the aforementioned ureα-modified<br>
polyester) is formed, for example, by (1) emulsifying and/or dispersing the<br>
toner solution containing the polymer reactive with the compound (e.g.<br>
isocyanate group containing polyester prepolymer (A)) in the aqueous<br>
medium phase together with the active hydrogen group containing compound<br>
(e.g. amines (B)) so as to form a dispersion, and then the active hydrogen<br>
group containing compound and the polymer reactive with the compound are<br>
subjected to elongation and/or crosslinking reaction in the aqueous medium<br>
phase; (2) emulsifying and/or dispersing toner solution in the aqueous<br>
medium previously added with the active hydrogen group containing<br><br>
compound to form a dispersion, and then the active hydrogen<br>
group containing compound and the polymer reactive with the compound are<br>
subjected to elongation and/or crosslinking reaction in the aqueous medium<br>
phase; (3) after adding and mixing toner solution in the aqueous medium, the<br>
active hydrogen group containing compound is sequentially added thereto so<br>
as to form a dispersion, and then the active hydrogen group containing<br>
compound and the polymer reactive with the compound are subjected to<br>
elongation and/or crosslinking reaction at an interface of dispersed particles<br>
in the aqueous medium phase. In the process (3), it should be noted that<br>
modified polyester resin is preferentially formed on the surface of<br>
manufacturing toner particles, thus it is possible to generate concentration<br>
gradient in the toner particles.<br>
Condition of reaction for forming adhesive base material by<br>
emulsifying and/or dispersing is not particularly limited and may be adjusted<br>
accordingly with a combination of active hydrogen group containing<br>
compound and the polymer reactive with the compound. A suitable reaction<br>
time is preferably from 10 minutes to 40 hours and more preferably from 2<br>
hours to 24 hours. A suitable reaction temperature is preferably from 0°C to<br>
150°C and more preferably from 40°C to 98°C.<br>
A suitable formation of the dispersion containing the polymer reactive<br>
with active hydrogen group containing compound (e.g. the isocyanate<br>
group containing polyester prepolymer (A)) in the aqueous medium phase is,<br><br>
for example, a process in which the toner solution, produced from toner<br>
materials such as the polymer reactive with the active hydrogen<br>
group containing compound (e.g. the isocyanate group containing polyester<br>
prepolymer (A)), colorant, releasing agent, charge controlling agent,<br>
unmodified polyester, and the like that are dissolved and/or dispersed in the<br>
organic solvent, is added in the aqueous medium phase and dispersed by<br>
shear force. The detail of the dispersion process is as described above.<br>
When preparing dispersion, a dispersing agent is preferably used in<br>
order to stabilize the dispersing element (oil droplets formed from toner<br>
solution) and sharpen the particle size distribution while obtaining a<br>
predetermined shape of the dispersing element.<br>
The dispersing agent is not particularly limited and may be selected<br>
accordingly. Examples of dispersing agent include surfactant,<br>

Examples of celluloses include methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl<br>
cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, and the like.<br>
In the preparation of dispersion, a dispersing stabilizer may be<br>
employed as necessary. The dispersing stabilizer is, for example, acid-soluble<br>
or alkali-soluble compound such as calcium phosphate, and the like.<br>
When dispersing stabilizer is employed, calcium phosphate is dissolved<br>
by acid such as hydrochloric acid, and then washed with water or decomposed<br>
by enzyme, etc. to be removed from particles.<br>
In the preparation of dispersion, a catalyst for the elongation and/or<br>
crosslinking reaction may be employed as necessary. The catalyst is, for<br><br>
example, dibutyltin laurate, dioctyltin laurate, and the like.<br>
The organic solvent is removed from the obtained dispersion (emulsified<br>
slurry). The removal of organic solvent is carried out, for example, by the<br>
following methods; (1) the temperature of the dispersion is gradually increased,<br>
and the organic solvent in the oil droplets is completely evaporated and<br>
removed; (2) emulsified dispersion is sprayed in a dry atmosphere and the<br>
water-insoluble organic solvent is completely evaporated and removed from the<br>
oil droplets to form toner particles, while aqueous dispersing agent is evaporated<br>
and removed simultaneously.<br>
The circularity of the toner can be controlled by the strength of liquid<br>
stirring before this removal of organic solvent and the time for removing the<br>
solvent. When the removal of the solvent is slowly performed, the shape<br>
becomes near to perfect sphere and the circularity increases to 0.980 or more.<br>
When the stirring is performed vigorously and the removal of the solvent is<br>
performed within a short period of time, the shape becomes uneven or irregular<br>
and the circularity decreases to 0.900 to 0.960. When the emulsified liquid,<br>
obtained after emulsification and dispersion in an aqueous medium, and further<br>
by being subjected to an extension reaction, is stirred with a strong stirring force<br>
at a temperature of 30°C to 50°C in a stirring tank during removal of the solvent,<br>
it is possible to control the circularity in a range of 0.850 to 0.990. This is<br>
considered to be attained by occurrence of volume shrinkage during formation of<br>
particles due to abrupt removal of ethyl acetate contained therein, and the<br><br>
shape can be controlled by stirring force and time. The time for removing the<br>
solvent is within one hour. If the time is one hour or more, pigment begins to<br>
aggregate, leading to the reduction of volume specific resistance.<br>
The emulsified dispersion is sprayed in a dry atmosphere and the<br>
water insoluble organic solvent is completely evaporated and removed from the<br>
oil droplets to form toner particles, and simultaneously, aqueous dispersing<br>
agent can also be evaporated and removed. Generally, the dry atmosphere into<br>
which the dispersion is sprayed may be a heated gas, such as air, nitrogen,<br>
carbon dioxide or combustion gas, particularly, a gas flow heated above the<br>
boiling point of the solvent having the highest boiling point of the solvents used.<br>
A short-time treatment with a spray drier, a belt drier or a rotary kiln can<br>
provide toner particles with intended quality.<br>
When the particle size distribution during emulsification and dispersion<br>
is wide and washing and dry treatment is carried out keeping the particle size<br>
distribution, the particle size distribution can be adjusted by classifying into<br>
desired particle size distribution.<br>
Once organic solvent is removed, toner particles are formed. The toner<br>
particles are then preceded with washing, drying, and the like. And then toner<br>
particles may be classified as necessary. The classification is, for example,<br>
carried out by cyclone, decanter, or centrifugal separation thereby removing<br>
particles in the solution. Alternatively, the classification may be carried out<br>
after toner particles are obtained as powder by drying.<br><br>
The obtained toner particles are subjected to mixing with particles such<br>
as colorant, releasing agent, charge controlling agent, etc., and mechanical<br>
impact, thereby preventing particles such as releasing agent felling off from the<br>
surface of the toner particles.<br>
Examples of the method for imparting mechanical impact include a<br>
method in which an impact is imparted by rotating a blade at high speed, and a<br>
method in which an impact is imparted by introducing the mixed particles into a<br>
highspeed flow and accelerating the speed of the flow so as to make the<br>
particles to clash with each other or to make the composite particles to clash<br>
with an impact board. Examples of device employed for such method are<br>
angmill by Hosokawa Micron Corporation, modified I-type mill by Nippon<br>
Pneumatic Mfg. Co., Ltd. to decrease crushing air pressure, hybridization<br>
system by Nara Machinery Co., Ltd., kryptron system by Kawasaki Heavy<br>
Industries, Ltd., automatic mortar, and the like.<br>
The coloration of the toner according to one of the first and second<br>
aspects of the invention is not particularly limited and may be selected<br>
accordingly. For example, the coloration is at least one selected from black<br>
toner, cyan toner, magenta toner and yellow toner. Each color toner is obtained<br>
by appropriately selecting the colorant to be contained therein. It is preferably<br>
a color toner.<br>
(Developer)<br>
The developer of the invention at least contains the toner according to<br><br>
one of the first and second aspects of the invention and further contains other<br>
appropriately selected components such as the aforementioned carrier. The<br>
developer can be either one component developer or two-component developer.<br>
However, the two-component developer is preferable in terms of improved life<br>
span when the developer is used, for example, in a high-speed printer that<br>
corresponds to the improvement of recent information processing speed.<br>
The one-component developer using the toner of the invention exhibits<br>
less fluctuation in the toner particle diameter after toner inflow/outflow, and the<br>
toner filming to the developing roller or the fusion of toner onto the members<br>
such as blades for reducing toner layer thickness are absent, therefore providing<br>
excellent and stable developing property and images over long-term use<br>
(stirring) of the developing unit. The two-component developer using toner of<br>
the invention exhibits less fluctuation in the toner particle diameter after toner<br>
inflow/outflow for prolonged periods, and the excellent and stable developing<br>
property can be obtained after stirring in a developing unit for prolonged<br>
periods.<br>
The carrier is not particularly limited and may be selected accordingly.<br>
It is preferably the one having a core material and a resin layer coating the core<br>
material.<br>
The core material is not particularly limited and may be selected from<br>
known materials. For example, 50 emu/g to 90 emu/g of manganese, strontium<br>
(Mn, Sr) materials, manganese, magnesium (Mn, Mg) materials, and the like<br><br>
are preferred. Highly magnetizable materials such as iron powder (100 emu/g<br>
or more), magnetite (75 emu/g to 120 emu/g), and the like are preferred in terms<br>
of ensuring appropriate image density. Weak magnetizable materials such as<br>
copper — zinc (Cu - Zn) materials (30 emu/g to 80 emu/g) are preferred in terms<br>
of reducing the impact on photoconductor where toner is forming a magnetic<br>
brush, therefore advantageous for improving image quality. These may be<br>
used alone or in combination.<br>
The average particle diameter (volume average particle diameter (D50))<br>
of the core material is preferably 10 µm to 200 µm and more preferably 40 µm to<br>
100 µm.<br>
When the average particle diameter (volume average particle diameter<br>
(D50)) is less than 10 µm, the amount of fine powder in the carrier particle size<br>
distribution increases whereas magnetization per particle decreases resulting in<br>
the carrier scattering. When the average particle diameter is more than 150<br>
µm, toner scattering may be caused due to the decrease of specific surface area.<br>
Therefore, for a full-color image having many solid parts, reproduction of the<br>
solid parts in particular may be insufficient.<br>
The resin material is not particularly limited and may be selected from<br>
known resins accordingly. Examples of resin material include amino resin,<br>
polyvinyl resin, polystyrene resin, halogenated olefin resin, polyester resin,<br>
polycarbonate resin, polyethylene resin, polyvinyl fluoride resin, polyvinylidene<br>
fluoride resin, polytrifluoroethylene resin, polyhexafluoropropylene resin,<br><br>
copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and acryl monomer, copolymers of vinylidene<br>
fluoride and vinyl fluoride, fluoroterpolymer such as terpolymer of<br>
tetrafiuoroethylene, vinylidene fluoride and non-fluoride monomer, silicone resin,<br>
and the like. These may be used alone or in combination.<br>
Examples of amino resin include ureα-formaldehyde resin, melamine<br>
resin, benzoguanamine resin, urea resin, polyamide resin, epoxy resin, and the<br>
like. Examples of polyvinyl resin include acryl resin, polymethylmetacrylate<br>
resin, polyacrylonitrile resin, polyvinyl acetate resin, polyvinyl alcohol resin,<br>
polyvinyl butyral resin, and the like. Examples of polystyrene resin include<br>
polystyrene resin, styrene acryl copolymer resin, and the like. Examples of<br>
halogenated olefin resin include polyvinyl chloride, and the like. Examples of<br>
polyester resin include polyethyleneterephtalate resin and<br>
polybutyleneterephtalate resin, and the like.<br>
The resin layer may contain, for example, conductive powder, etc. as<br>
necessary. Examples of conductive powder include metal powder, carbon black,<br>
titanium oxide, tin oxide, zinc oxide, and the like. The average particle<br>
diameter of conductive powder is preferably lum or less. When the average<br>
particle diameter is more than 1µm, controlling electrical resistance may be<br>
difficult.<br>
The resin layer may be formed by, for example, dissolving silicone resin,<br>
etc. in a solvent to prepare a coating solution, uniformly applying the coating<br>
solution to the surface of core material by known method, drying, and baking.<br><br>
Examples of application method include immersion, spray, and brushing, etc.<br>
The solvent is not particularly limited and may be selected accordingly.<br>
Examples of solvent include toluene, xylene, methyethylketone,<br>
methylisobutylketone, cerusolbutylacetate, and the like.<br>
The baking is not particularly limited and may be done by external<br>
heating or internal heating. Examples of baking method include the one using<br>
fixed electric furnace, flowing electric furnace, rotary electric furnace, burner or<br>
microwave.<br>
The content of resin layer in the carrier is preferably 0.01% by mass to<br>
5.0% by mass. When it is less than 0.01% by mass, the resin layer may not be<br>
formed uniformly on the surface of the core material. When it is more than<br>
5.0% by mass, the resin layer may become excessively thick causing granulation<br>
between carriers, and the uniform carrier particles may not be obtained.<br>
When developer is a two-component developer, the content of the carrier<br>
in the two-component developer is not particularly limited and may be selected<br>
accordingly. For example, the content is preferably 90% by mass to 98% by<br>
mass and more preferably 93% by mass to 97% by mass.<br>
The mixing ratio of toner to carrier of the two-component developer is<br>
1part by mass to 10.0 parts by mass of toner relative to 100 parts by mass of<br>
carrier, in general.<br>
The developer of the invention contains the toner according to one of the<br>
first and second aspects of the invention and has excellent offset resistance and<br><br>
co-polymerized. Examples of vinyl resin include styrene-(meth)acrylic acid<br>
ester resin, styrene-butadiene copolymer, (meth)acrylic acid-acrylic acid ester<br>
copolymer, styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer, styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer,<br>
styrene-(meth)acrylic acid copolymer, and the like.<br>
Moreover, the resin fine particles may be formed of copolymer<br>
containing a monomer having at least two or more unsaturated groups.<br>
The monomer having at least two or more unsaturated groups is not<br>
particularly limited and may be selected accordingly. Examples of such<br>
monomer include sodium salt of sulfuric acid ester of methacrylic acid ethylene<br>
oxide adduct (Eleminol RS-30 by Sanyo Chemical Industries Co.),<br>
divinylbenzene, l,6hexanediol acrylate, and the like.<br>
The resin fine particles are formed by polymerization performed by the<br>
method appropriately selected from known methods. The resin fine particles<br>
are preferably obtained in a form of aqueous dispersion of the resin fine particles.<br>
Examples of preparation method of such aqueous dispersion include (1) a direct<br>
preparation method of aqueous dispersion of the resin fine particles in which, in<br>
the case of the vinyl resin, a vinyl monomer as a raw material is polymerized by<br>
suspension-polymerization method, emulsification-polymerization method, seed<br>
polymerization method or dispersion-polymerization method; (2) a preparation<br>
method of aqueous dispersion of the resin fine particles in which, in the case of<br>
the polyaddition and/or condensation resin such as polyester resin, polyurethane<br>
resin, or epoxy resin, a precursor (monomer, oligomer or the like) or solvent<br><br>
anti-heat preservability, therefore it is capable of forming excellent, clear and<br>
high-quality images constantly.<br>
The developer of the invention may be suitably used in forming images<br>
by various electrophotographic methods known such as magnetic<br>
one-component developing, non-magnetic one-component developing,<br>
two-component developing, and the like. In particular, the developer of the<br>
invention may be suitably used in the toner container, process cartridge, image<br>
forming apparatus, and image forming method of the invention as described<br>
below.<br>
(Toner container)<br>
The toner container of the invention comprises a container; and the<br>
toner according to one of the first and second aspects of the invention and/or the<br>
developer of the invention contained therein.<br>
The container is not particularly limited and may be selected from<br>
known containers. Preferable examples of the container include one having a<br>
toner container body and a cap.<br>
The toner container body is not particularly limited in size, shape,<br>
structure or material and may be selected accordingly. The shape is preferably<br>
a cylinder. It is particularly preferable that a spiral ridge is formed on the<br>
inner surface and the contained toner is movable toward discharging end when<br>
rotated and the spiral part, whether partly or entirely, serves as bellows.<br>
The material of the toner container body is not particularly limited and<br><br>
preferably being dimensionally accurate. For example, resins are preferable.<br>
Among resins, polyester resin, polyethylene resin, polypropylene resin,<br>
polystyrene resin, polyvinyl chloride resin, polyacrylic acid, polycarbonate resin,<br>
ABS resin, polyacetal resin, and the like are preferable.<br>
The toner container of the invention is easy to preserve and ship and is<br>
handy. It is suitably used by being detachably mounted on the process<br>
cartridge, image forming apparatus, and the like which are described later, for<br>
supplying toner.<br>
(Process cartridge)<br>
The process cartridge of the invention at least comprises a latent<br>
electrostatic image bearing member for bearing a latent electrostatic image and<br>
a developing unit for developing the latent electrostatic image on the latent<br>
electrostatic image bearing member using developer and further comprises<br>
charging unit, exposing unit, developing unit, transferring unit, cleaning unit,<br>
discharging unit and other units selected accordingly.<br>
The developing unit at least contains a developer container for storing<br>
the toner and/or developer of the invention and a developer carrier for carrying<br>
and transferring the toner and/or developer stored in the developer container<br>
and may further contain a layer thickness control member for controlling the<br>
thickness of carried toner layer.<br>
The process cartridge of the invention may be detachably mounted on a<br>
variety of electrophotographic apparatuses, facsimile and printers and is<br><br>
preferably detachably mounted on the electrophotographic apparatus of the<br>
invention, which is described later.<br>
The process cartridge comprises, for example as shown in FIG. 1,<br>
photoconductor 102, charging unit 103, developing unit 104, and cleaning unit<br>
105 and, 101 represents an entire process cartridge.<br>
In this process cartridge, plural constituent elements, among<br>
constituent elements such as a photoconductor, developing unit, charging unit,<br>
cleaning unit, etc., may be constructed as the process cartridge and this process<br>
cartridge is placed onto the main body of image forming apparatus such as a<br>
copier and printer as detachable.<br>
FIG. 21 shows an example of the process cartridge using a<br>
two-component developer of the invention and has the same configuration and<br>
effects as those of the process cartridge shown in FIG. 1. The symbols used in<br>
FIG. 21 correspond to the symbols used in FIG. 1.<br>
In the image forming apparatus comprising the process cartridge of the<br>
invention, the photoconductor is rotationally driven at a predetermined<br>
circumferential speed. The photoconductor receives uniform charge of positive<br>
or negative predetermined potential from a charging unit in the roating process,<br>
then is exposed to image exposure light from an image exposing unit such as a<br>
slit exposure and laser beam, and thus latent electrostatic images are<br>
sequentially formed on the surface of the photoconductor. Thus formed latent<br>
electrostatic images are developed by toner with a developing unit, developed<br><br>
toner images are sequentially transferred on a transfer material by a<br>
transferring unit, which is fed from a paper feeding part between the<br>
photoconductor and a transferring unit so as to match the rotation of the<br>
photoconductor. The transfer material having transferred images is separated<br>
from the surface of the photoconductor, introduced to an image fixing unit, and<br>
images are fixed, and printed out as a copy to the outside of the apparatus.<br>
The surface of the photoconductor after image transfer is cleaned as a result of<br>
removal of residue toner remaining after transfer, further discharged, and then<br>
is used for image forming repeatedly<br>

-Latent Electrostatic Image Forming and Latent Electrostatic Image Forming<br>
Unit-<br>
The latent electrostatic image forming is a step that forms a latent<br>
electrostatic image on the photoconductor.<br>
Materials, shapes, structures or sizes, etc. of the latent electrostatic<br>
image bearing member (may be referred to as "photoconductive insulator",<br>
"photoconductor") are not limited and may be selected accordingly and it is<br>
preferably drum-shaped. The materials thereof are, for example, inorganic<br>
photoconductors such as amorphous silicon, selenium; organic photoconductors<br>
such as polysilane, phthalopolymethine, and the like. Of these examples,<br>
amorphous silicon is preferred for its longer operating life.<br>
For the amorphous silicon photoconductor, a photoconductor, (hereafter<br>
may be referred to as "α-Si series photoconductor") having a photo-conductive<br>
layer made of a_Si that is formed on the support by coating method such as<br>
vacuum deposition, sputtering, ion-plating, thermo-CVD, photo-CVD,<br>
plasma-CVD, and the like, while support is being heated at 50°C to 400°C, may<br>
be used. Of these coating methods, plasma-CVD, whereby a_Si cumulolayer is<br>
formed on the support by decomposition of the material gas by direct current,<br>
high-frequency wave or microwave glow discharge, is preferable.<br>
Examples of the layer structure of the amorphous silicon<br><br>
photoconductor are as follows. FIGS. 9 through 12 are schematic diagrams for<br>
explaining the layer structure of the photoconductor.<br>
With reference to FIG. 9, a photoconductor for electrophotography 500<br>
comprises a support 501 and a photoconductive layer 502 thereon. The<br>
photoconductive layer 502 is formed of α-Si:H, X, and exhibits photoconductivity.<br>
With reference to FIG. 10, a photoconductor for electrophotography 500<br>
comprises a support 501, a photoconductive layer 502 and an amorphous silicon<br>
surface layer 503 arranged on the support 501. The photoconductive layer 502<br>
is formed of α-Si:H, X, and exhibits photoconductivity.<br>
With reference to FIG. 11, a photoconductor for electrophotography 500<br>
comprises a support 501, and on the support 501, a photoconductive layer 502,<br>
an amorphous silicon surface layer 503 and an amorphous silicon charge<br>
injection inhibiting layer 504. The photoconductive layer 502 is formed of<br>
a-Si:H, X, and exhibits photoconductivity.<br>
With reference to FIG. 12, a photoconductor for electrophotography 500<br>
comprises a support 501 and a photoconductive layer 502 thereon. The<br>
photoconductive layer 502 includes a charge generating layer 505 formed of<br>
a-Si:H, X and a charge transport layer 506. An amorphous silicon surface layer<br>
503 is arranged on the photoconductive layer 502.<br>
The support of the photoconductor may be conductive or electrically<br>
insulating. Examples of the conductive support include metals such as Al, Cr,<br>
Mo, Au, In, Nb, Te, V, Ti, Pt, Pd, and Fe, or alloys thereof e.g. stainless steel.<br><br>
The support may also be an electrically insulating support of a film or sheet of<br>
synthetic resin such as polyester, polyethylene, polycarbonate, cellulose acetate,<br>
polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, and polyamide, or of glass,<br>
ceramic, or the like, wherein at least a surface on the photosensitive layer<br>
formed side of the electrically insulating support is treated to have conductivity.<br>
The shape of the support may be a cylinder, plate, or endless belt having<br>
a smooth or uneven surface, its thickness may be determined appropriately so<br>
that a desired photoconductor for image forming apparatus can be formed;<br>
however, when bendability as a photoconductor for image forming apparatus is<br>
required, the thickness can be made as thin as possible as the function of the<br>
support can be well exhibited. However, the support is normally required to be<br>
10 µm or more in thickness from the points of production and handling,<br>
mechanical strength, etc.<br>
In the amorphous photoconductor, it is effective to dispose a charge<br>
injection inhibiting layer between the conductive support and the<br>
photoconductive layer according to necessity (See, FIG. 11). The charge<br>
injection inhibiting layer inhibits a charge injection from the conductive support.<br>
The charge injection inhibiting layer has a dependency on the polarity.<br>
Specifically, when charges of a certain polarity are applied to a free surface of the<br>
photoconductor, the charge injection inhibiting layer inhibits a charge from<br>
being injected into the photosensitive layer from the support. However, the<br>
charge injection inhibiting layer does not when charges of the opposite polarity<br><br>
are applied, i.e., the charge injection inhibiting layer has a dependency on the<br>
polarity. In order to attain such function, the charge injection inhibiting layer<br>
contains relatively larger amounts of atoms controlling conductivity, compared<br>
with the photoconductive layer.<br>
The thickness of the charge injection inhibiting layer is preferably 0.1<br>
µm to 5 µm, more preferably 0.3 µm to 4 µm, and most preferably 0.5 µm to 3 µm<br>
for desired electrophotographic properties and better economical efficiency.<br>
The photoconductive layer may be disposed on an undercoat layer<br>
according to necessity. The thickness of the photoconductive layer 502 is<br>
determined appropriately as desired in terms of electrophotographic properties<br>
and better economical efficiency. The thickness is preferably 1 µm to 100 µm,<br>
more preferably 20 µm to 50 µm, and most preferably preferably 23 µm to 45 µm.<br>
When the photoconductive layer is constructed with plural layers to<br>
separate its function, the charge transport layer mainly serves as a layer to<br>
transport charge. The charge transport layer comprises at least a silicon atom,<br>
carbon atom, and fluorine atom as its essential components, and optionally<br>
comprises a hydrogen atom and oxygen atom so that the charge transport layer<br>
is formed of a-SiC(H,F,0). Such charge transport layer exhibits desirable<br>
photoconductivity, especially charge holding property, charge generating<br>
property, and charge transporting property. In the invention, it is particularly<br>
preferable that the charge transport layer comprises an oxygen atom.<br><br>
	The thickness of the charge transport layer is determined appropriately<br>
as desired in terms of electrophotographic properties and better economical<br>
efficiency. The thickness thereof is preferably 5 µm to 50 |im, more preferably<br>
10 µm to 40 µm, and most preferably 20 µm to 30 1 µm.<br>
When the photoconductive layer is constructed with plural layers to<br>
separate its function, the charge generating layer mainly serves as a layer to<br>
generate charge. The charge generating layer comprises at least a silicon atom<br>
as its essential component does not substantially comprise a carbon atom, and<br>
optionally comprises a hydrogen atom so that the charge generating layer is<br>
formed of α-Si:H. Such charge generating layer exhibits desirable<br>
photoconductivity, especially charge generating property and charge<br>
transporting property.<br>
The thickness of the charge generating layer is determined<br>
appropriately as desired in terms of electrophotographic properties and better<br>
economical efficiency. The thickness thereof is preferably 0.5 µm to 15 µm,<br>
more preferably 1 µm to 10 µm, and most preferably 1 µm to 5 µm.<br>
The amorphous silicon photoconductor may further comprise a surface<br>
layer disposed on the photoconductive layer on the support as mentioned above<br>
according to necessity. The surface layer is preferably an amorphous silicon<br>
layer. The surface layer has a free surface and is disposed to attain an object of<br>
the invention mainly in moisture resistance, usability in continuous repeated<br>
use, electric strength, stability in operating environment, and durability.<br><br>
In general, the thickness of the surface layer is preferably 0.01 µm to 3 <br>
µm, more preferably 0.05 µm to 2 µm, and most preferably 0.1 µm to 1 µm. If<br>
the thickness is less than about 0.01 µm, the surface layer may be lost during<br>
the use of the photoconductor due to abrasion. If it is more than 3 µm,<br>
electrophotographic properties may be impaired such as an increase of residual<br>
potential.<br>
The amorphous silicon photoconductor has a high surface hardness and<br>
high sensitivity with light with long wavelength, such as semiconductor laser<br>
light (770 nm to 800 nm). In addition, little deterioration is observed after<br>
repeated use, and thus the amorphous silicon photoconductor is used as a<br>
photoconductor for electrophotography, for example, in a high-speed copier or a<br>
laser beam printer (LBP).<br>
The latent electrostatic image may be formed, for example, by uniformly<br>
charging the surface of photoconductor, and exposing it imagewise, and this may<br>
be performed by the latent electrostatic image forming unit.<br>
The latent electrostatic image forming unit, for example, contains a<br>
charger which uniformly charges the surface of latent electrostatic image<br>
bearing member, and an irradiator which exposes the surface of latent<br>
electrostatic image bearing member imagewise.<br>
Charging may be performed, for example, by applying a voltage to the<br>
surface of latent electrostatic image bearing member using the charger.<br>
The charger is not limited and may be selected accordingly. Examples<br><br>
of charger include known contact chargers equipped with conductive or<br>
semi-conductive roller, brush, film or rubber blade and non-contact chargers<br>
using corona discharges such as corotron or scorotron, etc.<br>
Here, FIG. 8 shows a schematic configuration of an example of the<br>
image forming apparatus using a contact charger. A photoconductor 10 as a<br>
member to be charged or image bearing member, is rotationally driven in the<br>
arrow direction at a predetermined speed (process speed). A charging roller<br>
152 as a charging member is brought into contact with this photosensitive drum<br>
10 and comprises, as a basic configuration, a cored bar 521 and a conductive<br>
rubber layer 522 formed on the outside circumferential surface of this cored bar<br>
in the form of roller concentrically. The both terminals of the cored bar are<br>
supported with e.g. bearings (not shown) so that the charging roller can rotate<br>
freely, and the charging roller is pressed to the photosensitive drum at a<br>
predetermined pressure by a pressurization unit (not shown). This charging<br>
roller in this figure rotates along with the rotational driven of the photosensitive<br>
drum. The charging roller is formed with a diameter of 16 mm in which a<br>
cored bar having a diameter of 9 mm is coated with a rubber layer having a<br>
moderate resistance of approximately 100,000 Ώcm.<br>
A power supply 153 shown in the figure is electrically connected with<br>
the cored bar 521 of the charging roller, and a predetermined bias is applied to<br>
the charging roller by the power supply. Thus, the surface of the<br>
photoconductor is uniformly charged at a predetermined polarity and potential.<br><br>
The configuration of charging members may be of magnetic brush, fur<br>
brush or any other configurations other than of the roller, and may be selected<br>
according to the specification or configuration of the electrophotographic<br>
apparatus. In the apparatus where magnetic brush is used, the magnetic<br>
brush is constructed with various ferrite particles such as Zn-Cu ferrite that are<br>
used as charging members, nonmagnetic conductive sleeve supporting the<br>
charging member, and the magnet roll contained in the nonmagnetic conductive<br>
sleeve. When a brush is used, for example, fur is made conductive by carbon,<br>
copper sulfide, metal or metal oxide and it is winded around, or stuck to the<br>
cored bar which has been made conductive by metal and others to use as a<br>
charger.<br>
The charger is not limited to above-mentioned contact chargers,<br>
however, it is preferable to use contact chargers because of the ability to decrease<br>
the ozone generated from charger in the image-forming apparatus.<br>
Exposures may be performed by exposing the surface of photoconductor<br>
imagewise using exposure machines, for example.<br>
The exposure machine is not limited as long as it is capable of exposing<br>
the surface of photoconductor that has been charged by a charger to form an<br>
image as it is expected, and may be selected accordingly. Examples thereof<br>
include various exposure machines such as copy optical system, rod lens array<br>
system, laser optical system, and liquid crystal shutter optical system, etc.<br>
A backlight system may be employed in the invention by which the<br><br>
photoconductor is exposed imagewise from the rear surface.<br>
- Developing and Developing Unit -<br>
Developing is a step by which a latent electrostatic image is developed<br>
using the toner according to one of the first and second aspects of the invention<br>
and/or the developer to form a visible image.<br>
The visible image may be formed, for example, by developing a latent<br>
electrostatic image using toner and/or developer, which may be performed by a<br>
developing unit.<br>
The developing unit is not limited as long as it is capable of developing<br>
an image by using the toner according to one of the first and second aspects of<br>
the invention and/or developer, for example, and may be selected from known<br>
developing unit accordingly. Suitable examples thereof include those having<br>
developing units that contain the toner according to one of the first and second<br>
aspects of the invention and/or developer that can supply toners to the latent<br>
electrostatic images by contact or with no contact, developing units that contain<br>
the toner container of the invention are more preferable.<br>
The developing unit may be of dry developing system or wet developing<br>
system and may also be for single or multiple colors. Preferred examples<br>
include one having mixer whereby toner and/or developer is charged by<br>
friction-stirring and rotatable magnet rollers.<br>
In the developing unit, the toner and the carrier may, for example, be<br>
mixed and stirred together. The toner is thereby charged by friction, and forms<br><br>
a magnetic brush on the surface of the rotating magnet roller. Since the<br>
magnet roller is arranged near the latent electrostatic image bearing member<br>
(photoconductor), a part of the toner constructing the magnetic brush formed on<br>
the surface of the magnet roller is moved toward the surface of the latent<br>
electrostatic image bearing member (photoconductor) due to the force of<br>
electrical attraction. As a result, a latent electrostatic image is developed by<br>
the use of toner, and a visible toner image is formed on the surface of the<br>
photoconductor.<br>
In the developing unit, a vibration bias voltage formed of a<br>
direct-current voltage overlapped with an alternating voltage is applied to a<br>
developing sleeve from a power supply as a developing bias. Potentials of a<br>
background and an image portions are positioned between a maximum value<br>
and a minimum value of the vibration bias potential. Thus, an alternate<br>
electric filed alternating its direction is formed in a developing section. In this<br>
alternate electric filed, a toner and a carrier in the developer vibrate hard, and<br>
the toner escapes from an electrostatic binding force to the developing sleeve<br>
and/or carrier. Then, the toner soars to a photoconductive drum and adheres to<br>
the photoconductive drum in accordance with a latent image thereon.<br>
A difference between maximum and minimum values of the vibration<br>
bias voltage (a Voltage between peaks) is preferably from 0.5 kV to 5 kV and a<br>
frequency is preferably from 1 kHz to 10 kHz. Waveform of the vibration bias<br>
voltage may be a rectangular wave, a sine wave, a triangular wave, or the like.<br><br>
The direct-current voltage of the vibration bias is a value between the potentials<br>
of the background and image as mentioned above, and the value is preferably<br>
closer to the potential of the background than to that of the image to prevent<br>
foggy images in a potential area of the background, or a toner adhesion.<br>
When the vibration bias voltage has a rectangular waveform, it is<br>
desirable that a duty ratio be not greater than 50%. Here, the duty ratio is a<br>
time ratio while the toner goes for the photoconductor in a cycle of the vibration<br>
bias. In this way, the difference between a peak value of the toner going for the<br>
photoconductor and an average time of the bias can be large. Consequently, the<br>
movement of the toner becomes further activated hence the toner is accurately<br>
adheres to the potential distribution on a surface of a latent image, and surface<br>
roughness and an image resolution can be improved. Moreover, the difference<br>
between a peak value of the carrier, having a charge of the opposite polarity to<br>
the toner, going for the photoconductor and an average time of the bias can be<br>
small. Therefore, the movement of the carrier can be restrained and the<br>
possibility of the carrier adhesion to the background of a latent image can<br>
largely be reduced.<br>
The applied bias of the developing unit used in the invention is not<br>
limited as mentioned above, but it is preferable to apply a bias in such a way as<br>
mentioned above in order to obtain images with high resolution without surface<br>
roughness.<br>
The developer contained in the developing unit is the developer<br><br>
containing the toner according to one of the first and second aspects of the<br>
invention, and it may be one-component or two-component developer. The<br>
toner contained in the developer is the toner according to one of the first and<br>
second aspects of the invention.<br>
- Transferring and Transferring Unit -<br>
Transferring is a step that transfers the visible image to a recording<br>
medium. In a preferable aspect, the first transferring is performed, using an<br>
intermediate transferring member by which the visible image is transferred to<br>
the intermediate transferring member, and the second transfer is performed<br>
wherein the visible image is transferred to the recording medium. In a more<br>
preferable aspect, using toner of two or more colors and preferably of full-color,<br>
and the first transferring is performed by transferring the visible image to the<br>
intermediate transferring member to form a compounded transfer image, and<br>
the second transferring is performed by transferring the compounded transfer<br>
image to the recording medium.<br>
Transferring of the visible image may be carried out, for example, by<br>
charging the latent electrostatic image bearing member (photoconductor) using<br>
a transferring charger, which can be performed by the transferring unit. In a<br>
preferable aspect, the transferring unit contains the first transferring unit<br>
which transfers the visible image to the intermediate transferring member to<br>
form a compounded transfer image, and the second transferring unit which<br>
transfers the compounded transfer image to the recording medium.<br><br>
The intermediate transferring member is not limited and may be<br>
selected from known transferring members and preferred examples include<br>
transfer belts.<br>
The stationary friction coefficient of intermediate transferring member<br>
is preferably 0.1 to 0.6 and more preferably 0.3 to 0.5. The volume resistance of<br>
intermediate transferring member is preferably more than several Ώ cm and<br>
less than 103 Ώ cm. By keeping the volume resistance within a range of<br>
several Ώ cm to 103 Ώ cm, the charge over intermediate transferring member<br>
itself can be prevented and the charge given by the charging unit is unlikely to<br>
remain on the intermediate transferring member. Therefore transfer<br>
nonuniformity at the time of secondary transferring can be prevented and the<br>
application of transfer bias at the time of secondary transferring becomes<br>
relatively easy.<br>
The materials making up the intermediate transferring member is not<br>
particularly limited, and may be selected from known materials accordingly.<br>
Examples are named hereinafter, (1) Materials with high Young's modulus<br>
(tension elasticity) used as a single layer belt such as polycarbonates (PC),<br>
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polyalkylene terephthalate (PAT), blend<br>
materials of PC/PAT, ethylene tetrafluoroethylene copolymer (ETFE)/PC, and<br>
ETFE/PAT, thermosetting polyimides of carbon black dispersion, and the like.<br>
These single layer belts having high Young's modulus are small in their<br>
deformation against stress during image formation and are particularly<br><br>
advantageous in that registration error is least likely to occur during color image<br>
formation. (2) A double or triple layer belt using above-described belt having<br>
high Young's modulus as a base layer, added with a surface layer and an<br>
optional intermediate layer around the peripheral side of the base layer. The<br>
double or triple layer belt has a capability of preventing dropouts in a lined<br>
image that is caused by hardness of the single layer belt. (3) A belt with<br>
relatively low Young's modulus that incorporates a rubber or an elastomer.<br>
This belt is advantageous in that there is almost no print defect of unclear center<br>
portion in a line image due to its softness. Additionally, by making width of the<br>
belt wider than drive roller or tension roller and thereby using the elasticity of<br>
edge portions that extend over rollers, it can prevent meandering of the belt. It<br>
is also cost effective for not requiring ribs or units to prevent meandering.<br>
Conventionally, intermediate transfer belts have been adopting fluorine<br>
resins, polycarbonate resins, polyimide resins, and the like," however, recently,<br>
elastic belts in which elastic members are used in all layers or a part thereof are<br>
used as the intermediate transfer belts. There are some issues over transfer of<br>
color images by resin belt as described below.<br>
Color images are typically formed by four colors of color toners. In one<br>
color image, toner layers of layer 1 to layer 4 are formed. Toner layers are<br>
pressurized as they pass through the primary transferring (in which toner is<br>
transferred to the intermediate transfer belt from the photoconductor) and the<br>
secondary transferring (in which toner is transferred to the sheet from the<br><br>
intermediate transfer belt), and the cohesive force among toner particles<br>
increases. As the cohesive force increases, phenomena such as dropouts of<br>
letters or dropouts of edges of solid images are likely to occur. Since resin belts<br>
are too hard to deform corresponding to the toner layers, they tend to compress<br>
the toner layers and therefore letter drop outs are likely to occur.<br>
Recently, the demand toward printing full color images on various types<br>
of paper such as Japanese paper or the paper having a rough surface is<br>
increasing. However, the paper having a rough surface is likely to have a gap<br>
between toner and sheet at the time of transferring and therefore leading to<br>
transfer errors. When the transfer pressure of secondary transfer section is<br>
increased in order to increase adhesiveness, the cohesive force of the toner layers<br>
becomes high, resulting in the letter drop outs as described above.<br>
Elastic belts are used for the following purpose. Elastic belts deform<br>
corresponding to the surface roughness of toner layers and the sheet having low<br>
smoothness in the transfer section. In other words, since elastic belts deform<br>
complying with local roughness and an appropriate adhesiveness can be<br>
obtained without excessively increasing the transfer pressure against toner<br>
layers, it is possible to obtain transfer images having excellent uniformity with<br>
no letter drop outs even with the paper of low flatness.<br>
The resin of the elastic belts is not limited and may be selected<br>
accordingly. Examples thereof include polycarbonates, fluorine resins (ETFE,<br>
PVDF), styrene resins (homopolymers and copolymers including styrene or<br><br>
substituted styrene) such as polystyrene, chloropolystyrene,<br>
poly α-methylstyrene, styrene-butadiene copolymer, styrene-vinyl chloride<br>
copolymer, styrene-vinyl acetate copolymer, styrene-maleic acid copolymer,<br>
styrene-acrylate copolymers (styrene-methyl acrylate copolymer, styrene-ethyl<br>
acrylate copolymer, styrene-butyl acrylate copolymer, styrene-octyl acrylate<br>
copolymer, and styrene-phenyl acrylate copolymer), styrene-methacrylate<br>
copolymers (styrene-methyl methacrylate copolymer, styrene-ethyl<br>
methacrylate copolymer, styrene-phenyl methacrylate copolymer, and the like),<br>
styrene-achloromethyl acrylate copolymer, styrene-acrylonitrile acrylate<br>
copolymer, and the like, methyl methacrylate resin, butyl methacrylate resin,<br>
ethyl acrylate resin, butyl acrylate resin, modified acrylic resins<br>
(silicone-modified acrylic resin, vinyl chloride resin-modified acrylic resin,<br>
acrylic urethane resin, and the like), vinyl chloride resin, styrene-vinyl acetate<br>
copolymer, vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer, rosin-modified maleic acid<br>
resin, phenol resin, epoxy resin, polyester resin, polyester polyurethane resin,<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutadiene, polyvinylidene chloride, ionomer<br>
resin, polyurethane resin, silicone resin, ketone resin, ethylene-ethylacrylate<br>
copolymer, xylene resin and polyvinylbutylal resin, polyamide resin, modified<br>
polyphenylene oxide resin, and the like. These may be used alone or in<br>
combination.<br>
Rubber and elastomer of the elastic materials are not limited and may<br>
be selected accordingly. Examples thereof include butyl rubber, fluorine rubber,<br><br>
acrylic rubber, ethylene propylene rubber (EPDM), NBR,<br>
acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene natural rubber, isoprene rubber,<br>
styrene-butadiene rubber, butadiene rubber, ethylene-propylene rubber,<br>
ethylene-propylene terpolymer, chloroprene rubber, chlorosufonated<br>
polyethylene, chlorinated polyethylene, urethane rubber, syndiotactic<br>
1,2-polybutadiene, epichlorohydrin rubber, silicone rubber, fluorine rubber,<br>
polysulfurized rubber, polynorbornen rubber, hydrogenated nitrile rubber,<br>
thermoplastic elastomers (polystyrene elastomers, polyolefin elastomers,<br>
polyvinyl chloride elastomers, polyurethane elastomers, polyamide elastomers,<br>
polyurea elastomers, polyester elastomers, and fluorine resin elastomers), and<br>
the like. These may be used alone or in combination.<br>
The conductive agents for resistance adjustment are not limited and<br>
may be selected accordingly. Examples thereof include carbon black, graphite,<br>
metal powders such as aluminum, nickel, and the like and electric conductive<br>
metal oxides such as tin oxide, titanium oxide, antimony oxide, indium oxide,<br>
potassium titanate, antimony tin oxide (ATO), indium tin oxide (ITO), and the<br>
like. The conductive metal oxides may be coated with insulating particles such<br>
as barium sulfate, magnesium silicate, calcium carbonate, and the like. The<br>
conductive agents are not limited to those mentioned above.<br>
Materials of the surface layer are required to prevent contamination of<br>
the photoconductor by elastic material as well as to reduce the surface friction of<br>
the transfer belt so that toner adhesion is lessened while cleaning ability and the<br><br>
secondary transfer property are improved. Materials which reduces surface<br>
energy and enhances lubrication by the use of alone or combination of<br>
polyurethane, polyester, epoxy resin, and the like may be dispersed for use.<br>
Examples of such materials include alone, combination of two or more or<br>
combination of different particle diameters of powders or particles such as<br>
fluorine resin, fluorine compound, carbon fluoride, titanium dioxide, silicon<br>
carbide, and the like. In addition, it is possible to use a material such as<br>
fluorine rubber that is treated with heat so that a fluorine-rich layer is formed<br>
on the surface and the surface energy is reduced.<br>
Examples of manufacturing processes of the belts include, but not<br>
limited to centrifugal forming in which material is poured into a rotating<br>
cylindrical mold to form a belt, spray application in which a liquid paint is<br>
sprayed to form a film, dipping method in which a cylindrical mold is dipped into<br>
a solution of material and then pulled out, injection mold method in which<br>
material is injected between inner and outer mold, a method in which a<br>
compound is applied onto a cylindrical mold and the compound is vulcanized<br>
and grounded. In general, two or more processes are combined for<br>
manufacturing belts.<br>
Methods to prevent elongation of the elastic belt include using a core<br>
resin layer that is difficult to elongate on which a rubber layer is formed,<br>
incorporating a material that prevents elongation into the core layer, and the<br>
like, but the methods are not particularly limited to the manufacturing<br><br>
processes.<br>
Examples of the materials constructing the core layer that prevent<br>
elongation include alone or combination of natural fibers such as cotton, silk and<br>
the like: synthetic fibers such as polyester fibers, nylon fibers, acrylic fibers,<br>
polyolefin fibers, polyvinyl alcohol fibers, polyvinyl chloride fibers,<br>
polyvinylidene chloride fibers, polyurethane fibers, polyacetal fibers,<br>
polyfluoroethylene fibers, phenol fibers, and the like; inorganic fibers such as<br>
carbon fibers, glass fibers, boron fibers, and the like, metal fibers such as iron<br>
fibers, copper fibers, and the like, and materials that are in a form of a weave or<br>
thread may be used. It should be noted that the materials are not limited to<br>
those described above.<br>
A thread may be one or more of filaments twisted together, and any<br>
twisting and plying forms are accepted such as single twisting, multiple twisting,<br>
doubled yarn, and the like. Further, fibers of different materials selected from<br>
above-mentioned group may be spun together. The thread may be treated-<br>
before use in such a way that it becomes electrically conductive. On the other<br>
hand, the weave may be of any type including plain knitting, and the like. It is<br>
possible to use a union weave for making it electrically conductive.<br>
The manufacturing process of the core layer is not particularly limited.<br>
Examples include a method in which a weave that is woven in a cylindrical<br>
shape is placed on a mold or the like and a coating layer is formed on top of it, a<br>
method in which a cylindrical weave is dipped in a liquid rubber or the like so<br><br>
that coating layer(s) is formed on one side or on both sides of the core layer and a<br>
method in which a thread is wound helically to a mold or the like in an arbitrary<br>
pitch, and then a coating layer is formed thereon.<br>
If the elastic layer is too thick, elongation and contraction of the surface<br>
becomes large and may cause cracks on the surface layer depending on the<br>
hardness of the elastic layer. Moreover, as the amount of elongation and<br>
contraction increases, the size of images are also elongated and contracted<br>
significantly. Therefore, too much thickness, about 1mm or more, is not<br>
preferable.<br>
The transferring units of the first and the second transferring<br>
preferably contain an image-transferring unit which releases the visible image<br>
formed on the photoconductor to the recording-medium side by charging.<br>
There may be one, two or more of the transferring unit.<br>
The transferring unit may be a corona transferring unit based on corona<br>
discharge, transfer belt, transfer roller, pressure transfer roller, or adhesion<br>
transferring unit, for example.<br>
The recording medium is not limited as long as it is capable of<br>
transferring unfixed images after development and may be selected accordingly.<br>
The recording medium is typically plain paper, and other materials such as<br>
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheets for overhead projector (OHP) may be<br>
utilized.<br>
The fixing is a step that fixes the visible image transferred to the<br><br>
recording medium using a fixing unit. The fixing may be carried out for each<br>
color when being transferred to the recording medium, or simultaneously when<br>
all colors are being laminated.<br>
The fixing unit is not limited and may be selected accordingly, however<br>
it is preferably known heat application and pressurization unit. Examples of<br>
such unit include a combination of heating roller and pressure roller, and a<br>
combination of heating roller, pressure roller, and endless belt, and the like.<br>
The heating temperature in the heat application and pressurization<br>
unit is preferably 80°C to 200°C.<br>
Further, known optical fixing unit may be used in addition to or in place<br>
of fixing and fixing unit, depending on the application.<br>
In a preferable aspect, the fixing unit is a heat fixing unit which fixes a<br>
toner image on a recording medium while the recording medium is passed<br>
between a heating member and a pressure member and is transported.<br>
In this case, it is preferable that the heat fixing unit comprises a<br>
cleaning member which removes the toner adhered to at least one of the heating<br>
member and the pressure member and that the surface pressure (roller<br>
load/contact area) applied between the heating member and pressure member is<br>
1.5x105Pa or less.<br>
As shown in FIG. 20, the fixing unit is, for example, a heat fixing unit in<br>
which a recording medium is passed between a heating member 230 and<br>
pressure member 232 and while the recording medium being transported, toner<br><br>
images on the recording medium are fixed. The heat fixing unit comprises a<br>
cleaning member 274 which removes toners adhered to the heating member and<br>
the surface pressure (roller load/contact area) applied between the heating<br>
member and pressure member is adjusted to 1.5x105 Pa or less. Higher surface<br>
pressure improves the fixing and/or prevents hot offset in a wider range;<br>
however, strong pressure cause e.g. crumple on a paper easily. The cleaning<br>
member 274 may be directly brought into contact with the heating member 230<br>
or pressure member 232 to remove toners adhered thereto, but not limited to<br>
this case, as shown in this FIG. 20, the cleaning member may remove toners<br>
adhered to the pressure member 232 via a toner removing member 284.<br>
Alternatively, the cleaning member may remove toners adhered to the heating<br>
member 232 via a toner removing member 284 to be brought into contact with<br>
the heating member 230 although drawing is omitted.<br>
In a preferable aspect, the fixing unit comprises a heating member<br>
equipped with a heat generator, a heating member equipped with a heat<br>
generator; a film which contacts with the heating member,' and a pressure<br>
member which makes pressure contact with the heating member via the film,<br>
wherein a recording medium, on which an unfixed image is formed after<br>
electrostatic transfer, is passed between the film and the pressure member to<br>
thereby heat and fix the unfixed image.<br>
Such fixing unit includes, for example, so-called surf fixing device, in<br>
which a fixing film is rotated to fix an image, as shown in FIG. 13.<br><br>
In this surf fixing device, the fixing film 351 is a heat resistant film<br>
having the shape of an endless belt, which is spanned around a driving roller<br>
356, driven roller 357 and heating member 352 which is fixedly supported by a<br>
heater supporter located between and below both of these rollers.<br>
The driven roller 357 also serves as a tension roller of the fixing film,<br>
and the fixing film 351 rotates clockwise due to a clockwise rotation, shown in<br>
the figure, of the driving roller. This rotational speed of the fixing film, is<br>
adjusted to be equivalent to the speed of a transfer material at a fixing nip area<br>
L where a pressure roller and the fixing film contact each other.<br>
Here, the pressure roller has a rubber elastic layer having good<br>
releasability such as silicone rubbers, and rotates counterclockwise while<br>
pressure contacting the fixing nip area L at an overall contact pressure of from 4<br>
kg to 10 kg.<br>
Such film that is excellent in heat resistance, releasability and<br>
durability is preferable as the fixing film 351, and its total thickness is not more<br>
than 100 µm, preferably, not more than 40 µm. Examples include a monolayer<br>
film of heat resistant resin such as polyimide, polyetherimide, polyethersulfide<br>
(PES), PFA (tetrafluorostyrene-peifluoroaliylvinylether copolymer resin), or the<br>
like; or multi-layer film comprising, for example, a 20 µm thick base layer, and,<br>
in the side coming in contact with the image, a 10 µm thick parting layer of<br>
fluoro-resin such as PTFE (tetrafluoro-ethylene resin), PAF, or the like, which is<br>
coated on the base layer and contains electrically conductive material, or an<br><br>
elastic layer of e.g. a fluorocarbon rubber or a silicone rubber, which is coated on<br>
the base layer.<br>
In FIG. 13, the heating member 352 in this aspect is composed of a flat<br>
substrate 353 and a fixing heater 355, and the flat substrate 353 is formed of a<br>
material having a high heat conductivity and a high electric resistance such as<br>
alumina. A fixing heater formed of a resistance heat generator is arranged on a<br>
surface of the heating member contacting the fixing film in the longitudinal<br>
direction. The fixing heater is one obtained by coating an electric resistant<br>
material such as Ag/Pd and Ta2N by e.g. a screen printing so as to have a linear<br>
shape or belt shape. Both ends of the fixing heater have electrodes (not shown)<br>
and the resistance heat generator generates a heat when electricity passes<br>
though the electrodes. Further, a fixing temperature sensor 358 formed of a<br>
thermistor is provided to the substrate on the surface opposite to the surface on<br>
which the fixing heater is arranged.<br>
Temperature information of the substrate detected by the fixing<br>
temperature sensor 358 is transmitted to a controller (not shown), then an<br>
electric energy supplied to the fixing heater by the controller, and the heating<br>
member is controlled to a predetermined temperature.<br>
The fixing unit is not limited to the above-mentioned surf fixing device?"<br>
however, it is preferable to use the surf fixing device because of availability of<br>
image forming apparatus such that a fixing unit which is efficient and can<br>
shorten the rise time.<br><br>
In a preferable aspect, the fixing unit comprises a heating roller, a<br>
fixing roller, an endless belt-like toner heating medium, and a pressure roller,<br>
wherein the heating roller is formed of a magnetic metal and is heated by<br>
electromagnetic induction, the fixing roller is arranged parallel to the heating<br>
roller, the toner heating medium is spanned over the heating roller and the<br>
fixing roller, is heated by the heating roller, and is rotated by these rollers, the<br>
pressure roller is brought into pressure contact with the fixing roller via the<br>
toner heating medium and rolls in the forward direction towards the toner<br>
heating medium to form a fixing nip portion, and wherein a recording medium,<br>
on which an unfixed image is formed after electrostatic transfer, is passed<br>
between the toner heating medium and the pressure member to thereby heat<br>
and fix the unfixed image.<br>
Suitable examples of such fixing unit include the fixing unit according to<br>
an electromagnetic induction heating (IH) process as shown in FIG. 14.<br>
The IH fixing unit used was so-called electromagnetic induction heating<br>
fixing unit (fixing unit according to an IH process) in which a heating unit<br>
thereof is, as shown in FIG. 14, a unit configured to cause a heating member<br>
containing a metal member to generate heat by electromagnetic induction,<br>
namely, the Joule heat caused by eddy current generated to a magnetic metal<br>
member due to an alternating magnetic field.<br>
The image-fixing apparatus shown in FIG. 14 comprises a heating roller<br>
301, fixing roller 302, heat resistant belt (toner heating medium) 303, and<br><br>
pressure roller 304. The heating roller 301 is heated by electromagnetic<br>
induction of an induction heating unit 306. The fixing roller 302 is arranged<br>
parallel to the heating roller 301. The endless heat resistant belt 303 is<br>
spanned over the heating roller 301, fixing roller 302 and is heated by the<br>
heating roller 301, and rolls in the arrow A direction by the rolling of one of these<br>
roller. The pressure roller 304 is brought into pressure contact with the fixing<br>
roller 302 via the belt 303, and rolls in the forward direction towards the belt<br>
303.<br>
The heating roller 301 comprises hollow circular cylindrical magnetic<br>
metal member made of, for example, iron, cobalt, nickel, or alloys of these metals,<br>
and this configuration enables low thermal capacity and fast temperature<br>
rising.<br>
The fixing roller 302 comprises a cored bar 302a made of metal such as<br>
stainless-steel and an elastic member 302b which is made of silicon rubber<br>
having heat resistance in solid form or in foam form and coats the cored bar<br>
302a. In order to form contact parts with a predetermined width between the<br>
pressure roller 304 and the fixing roller 302 by a pressing force from the<br>
pressure roller 304, the outside diameter of the fixing roller is set to larger than<br>
that of the heating roller 301. This configuration makes the thermal capacity<br>
of the heating roller 301 to be smaller than that of the fixing roller 302, and thus<br>
the heating roller 301 is rapidly heated and warm up time is shortened.<br>
The belt 303 which is spanned over the heating roller 301 and the fixing<br><br>
roller 302, is heated at a contact site W1 between itself and the heating roller<br>
301 which is heated by the induction heating unit 306. Then, by rolling of<br>
rollers 301 and 302, inside of the belt 303 is consecutively heated and as a result,<br>
the entire belt is heated. The pressure roller 304 comprises a cored bar 304a<br>
which is a circular member made of metal having good heat conductance such as,<br>
for example, copper or aluminum; and an elastic member 304b which is<br>
arranged on the surface of this cored bar 304a and has high heat resistance and<br>
toner releasing properties. Besides the above-mentioned metals, stainless<br>
(SUS) may be used in the cored bar 204a.<br>
The pressure roller 304 presses the fixing roller 302 via the belt 303 to<br>
form a fixing nip portion N. In this aspect, the pressure roller 304 has higher<br>
hardness than the fixing roller 302, and thus the pressure roller 304 makes<br>
inroads into the fixing roller 302 (and belt 303), which causes the recording<br>
medium 311 to be arranged along the circumferential shape of the surface of the<br>
pressure roller 304. In this way, the effect that the separation of the recording<br>
medium 311 from the belt 303 is facilitated is achieved.<br>
The induction heating unit 306 which heats the heating roller 301 by<br>
means of electromagnetic induction comprises, as shown in FIGS. 14, 15A and<br>
15B, an exciting coil 307 as a magnetic field generating unit, and a coil guide<br>
plate 308 around which the exciting coil 307 is winded. The coil guide plate 308<br>
is closely arranged to the outer circumferential surface of the heating roller 301<br>
and is in a half cylinder shape. As shown in FIG.15B, a long piece of wire rod<br><br>
for an exciting coil is alternately winded along the coil guide plate 308 in the<br>
axial direction of the heating roller 301 to form the exciting coil 307. Note that<br>
the oscillation circuit of the exciting coil 307 is connected to a frequency-variable<br>
driving power source (not shown). Outside the exciting coil 307, an exciting coil<br>
core 309 which is formed of a ferromagnetic material such as ferrite and is in a<br>
half cylinder shape is fixed to an exciting coil core supporting member 310 and<br>
closely arranged to the exciting coil 307. Note that an exciting coil core 309 for<br>
use in this aspect has a relative magnetic permeability of 2,500. A<br>
high-frequency alternating current of 10 to 1 MHz, and preferably 20 kHz to 800<br>
kHz is supplied from the driving power source to the exciting coil 307, thereby<br>
an alternating magnetic field is generated. The alternating magnetic field<br>
works on the heating roller 301 and the heat generating layer of the belt 303 in<br>
the contact region W1 of the heating roller 301 and the fixing belt 303 and in the<br>
vicinity thereof. Inside them, eddy currents I flow in the direction B preventing<br>
change of the alternating magnetic field. This eddy currents I cause to<br>
generate the Joule heat depending on the resistance of the heat roller 201 and<br>
the heat generation layer of the belt 303, i.e., mainly in the contact region of the<br>
heat roller 301 and the belt 303 and in the vicinity thereof, the belt 303<br>
comprising the heat roller 301 and the heat generating layer is heated by means<br>
of electromagnetic induction.<br>
The inner surface temperature of the thus-heated belt 303 is detected by<br>
means of temperature detecting means 305 which is arranged in contact with<br><br>
the inner surface of the belt 303 in the vicinity of the entrance of the fixing nip<br>
portion N and comprises temperature-sensitive element having high thermal<br>
responsiveness such as a thermistor.<br>
The fixing unit used in the invention is not limited to above-mentioned<br>
fixing unit according to an IH process. However, it is preferable to use a fixing<br>
unit according to an IH process because it has higher efficiency of heat transfer<br>
than that of the hear roller type fixing unit, enabling the shortening of warm-up<br>
time and an image forming apparatus, in which a fixing unit allowing quick<br>
start-up or energy-saving is utilized, is achieved.<br>
The charge-eliminating is a step that applies a discharge bias to the<br>
photoconductor to discharge it, and may be performed by a charge-eliminating<br>
unit.<br>
The charge-eliminating unit is not particularly limited as long as it is<br>
capable of applying discharge bias to the photoconductor such as discharge<br>
lamps, and may be selected from known charge-eliminating units accordingly.<br>
The cleaning is a step in which residual electrophotographic toner on<br>
the latent electrostatic image bearing member is removed, and typically<br>
performed by a cleaning unit.<br>
Any known cleaning unit that is capable of removing residual<br>
electrophotographic toner on the latent electrostatic image bearing member may<br>
be used, the cleaning unit may be properly selected from known cleaner and<br>
examples include magnetic brush cleaner, electrostatic brush cleaner, magnetic<br><br>
roller cleaner, blade cleaner, brush cleaner, and web cleaner, etc.<br>
The recycling is a step in which the electrophotographic color toner<br>
removed by the cleaning is recycled for use in the developing, and typically<br>
performed by a recycling unit.<br>
The recycling unit may be properly selected from known transport<br>
units.<br>
The controlling is a step in which the respective processes are controlled<br>
and typically carried out by a controlling unit.<br>
Any known controlling unit that is capable of controlling the<br>
performance of each unit may be selected accordingly. Examples include<br>
instruments such as sequencers or computers, etc.<br>
An aspect of the operation of the image forming method performed by<br>
the image forming apparatus of the invention is described referring to FIG. 2.<br>
The image forming apparatus 100 shown in FIG. 2 is equipped with the<br>
photoconductor drum 10 (hereafter referred to as "photoconductor 10") as a<br>
latent electrostatic image bearing member, the charge roller 20 as a charging<br>
unit, the exposure apparatus 30 as an exposure unit, the developing unit 40 as a<br>
developing unit, the intermediate transferring member 50, the cleaning device<br>
60 having a cleaning blade as a cleaning unit and the discharge lamp 70 as a<br>
discharging unit.<br>
The intermediate transferring member 50 is an endless belt that is<br>
being extended by the three roller 51 placed inside the belt and designed to be<br><br>
moveable in arrow direction. A part of three roller 51 function as a transfer<br>
bias roller that can imprint a specified transfer bias, the primary transfer bias,<br>
to the intermediate transferring member 50. The cleaning unit 90 with a<br>
cleaning blade is placed near the intermediate transferring member 50, and the<br>
transfer roller 80, as a transferring unit which can imprint the transfer bias for .<br>
transferring the developed image, toner image (second transferring), onto the<br>
transfer paper 95 as the final transfer material, is placed face to face with the<br>
cleaning unit 90. In the surrounding area of the intermediate transferring<br>
member 50, the corona charger 58, for charging toner image on the intermediate<br>
transferring member 50, is placed between contact area of the photoconductor<br>
10 and the intermediate transferring member 50 and contact area of the<br>
intermediate transferring member 50 and the transfer paper 95 in the rotating<br>
direction of the intermediate transferring member 50.<br>
The development unit 40 is constructed with developing belt 41 as a<br>
developer bearing member, black developing unit 45K, yellow developing unit<br>
45Y, magenta developing unit 45M and cyan developing unit 45C that are<br>
juxtapositioned in the surrounding area of developing belt 41. The black<br>
developing unit 45K is equipped with developer container 42K, developer<br>

developing belt 41 is an endless belt and is extended between a number of belt<br>
rollers as rotatable and the part of developing belt 41 is in contact with the<br>
photoconductor 10.<br>
For example, the charge roller 20 charges the photoconductor drum 10<br>
evenly in the image forming apparatus 100 as shown in FIG. 2. The exposure<br>
apparatus 30 exposes imagewise on the photoconductor drum 10 and forms a<br>
latent electrostatic image. The latent electrostatic image formed on the<br>
photoconductor drum 10 is then developed with the toner fed from the<br>
developing unit 40 to form a toner image. The toner image is then transferred<br>
onto the intermediate transferring member 50 by the voltage applied from the<br>
roller 51 as the primary transferring and it is further transferred onto the<br>
transfer paper 95 as the secondary transferring. As a result, a transfer image<br>
is formed on the transfer paper 95. The residual toner on the photoconductor<br>
10 is removed by the cleaning unit 60 and the charge built up over the<br>
photoconductor 10 is temporarily removed by the discharge lamp 70.<br>

When an original is copied using this copier, a main switch (not shown)<br>
is switched on and the original is set to the document table of the automatic<br>
document feeder 600. When a book is copied, for example, automatic document<br>
feeder 600 is opened, an original is set directly on the contact glass 257 of the<br>
image scanner 450, automatic document feeder 600 is closed and pushed down.<br>
By pushing the start switch (not shown), the document is transported<br>
by a sheet transport roller through a document transport path and moved onto<br><br>

reflected by a plurality of mirrors 254, passes through the optical lens for<br>
imaging 255, enters an image sensor 256, and the image sensor 256 reads the<br>
content of the original.<br>
Simultaneously, the photoconductor 210 is rotated by a photoconductor<br>
drive motor (not shown), in case of the example shown in the figure, first, the<br>
surface is uniformly charged by the charging device 211 in which a charge roller<br>
is used, then image information is written with a laser writing unit 247 by<br>
irradiating with laser light according to the content of the original scanned by<br>
the above-mentioned image scanner 450. A latent electrostatic image is formed<br>
on the surface of the photoconductor 210, and after that, toner is adhered by the<br>
developing device 212 to make the latent electrostatic image a visible image.<br>
Simultaneously with the push of start switch, sheets "S" are sent out by<br>
the pick-up roller 262 from the sheet cassette 261 corresponding to the selected<br>
size of a plurality of sheet cassettes 261 accommodated in the sheet bank 500,<br><br>
and are separated one by one by the following feeding roller 263 and separating<br>
roller 264, fed to the sheet supply path R1, transported by the sheet transport<br>
roller 266, guided to the sheet transport path R, and stopped running down to<br>
the resist roller 221. The resist roller 221 is rotated in synchronism with the<br>
rotation of the aforementioned visual toner image on the photoconductor 210<br>
thereby a sheet being fed in the right of the photoconductor 210. Alternatively,<br>
the manual sheet tray 267 of the manual sheet feeding section 268 is opened<br>
and sheets, set manually on the manual sheet tray 267, are sent out by the<br>
pick-up roller 262, separated one by one by the following feeding roller 263 and<br>
separating roller 264, fed to the manual sheet feeding path R2, transported by<br>
the sheet transport roller 266, guided to the sheet transport path R, and fed in<br>
the right of the photoconductor 210 by the resist roller 221 in synchronism with<br>
the rotation of the photoconductor 210.<br>
Then the toner image on the photoconductor 210 is transferred onto the<br>
sheet "S", fed in the right of the photoconductor 210, by, in case of the example<br>
shown in the figure, the transferring device 213, at the transfer position B to<br>
form an image. The residual toner on the photoconductor 210 after the image<br>
transfer is removed by the cleaning device 214 and cleaned, residual potential<br>
on the photoconductor 210 is removed by a discharging device (not shown) to<br>
prepare for the next image forming, which starts from the charging device 211.<br>
The sheet "S" after the image transfer is transported by the transfer belt<br>
217, fed to the heat fixing unit 222, passed between the heating roller 230 and<br><br>
pressure roller 232 and while the sheet being transported, heat and pressure are<br>
applied by them to fix the toner image on the sheet "S". Subsequently, the<br>
sheet is provided with tear-resistance through the discharge roller 235, first<br>
pressure roller 236, second pressure roller 237, and roller for providing<br>
tear-resistance 238, discharged on the discharge stack part 239, and stacked<br>
there.<br>
When images are formed on both sides of the sheet, the discharge<br>
switching pawl 234 is switched. The sheet, on the surface of which a toner<br>
image is transferred, is fed from the sheet transport path R to the inverting path<br>
R3l; transported by the sheet transport roller 266 to the switch back position 244;<br>
switched back by a switch back roller 243; thereby inverted, introduced to the<br>
re-transport path R4&gt;' transported by the sheet transport roller 266, guided<br>
again to the sheet transport path R; and images are also transferred on the back<br>
side of the sheet in the same way as described above.<br>
There are two types of tandem electrophotographic apparatus by which<br>
the image forming of the invention is performed by the image forming<br>
apparatus of the invention. In direct transfer type, images on the<br>
photoconductor 1 is transferred sequentially by the transferring unit 2 to the<br>
sheet "s" which is being transported by the sheet transport belt 3 as shown in<br>
FIG. 4. In the indirect transfer type, images on the photoconductor 1 is<br>
temporarily transferred sequentially by the primary transferring unit 2 to the<br>
intermediate transferring member 4 and then all the images on the<br><br>
intermediate transferring member 4 are transferred together to the sheet "s" by<br>
the secondary transferring unit 5 as shown in FIG. 5. The transferring unit 5<br>
is generally a transfer/transport belt; however roller types may be used.<br>
The direct transfer type, compared to the indirect transfer type, has a<br>
drawback of growing in size in the direction of sheet transportation because the<br>
paper feeding unit 6 must be placed on the upper side of the tandem image<br>
forming apparatus T where the photoconductor 1 is aligned, whereas the fixing<br>
unit 7 must be placed on the lower side of the apparatus. On the other hand, in<br>
the indirect transfer type, the secondary transfer site may be installed relatively<br>
freely, and the paper feeding unit 6 and the fixing unit 7 may be placed together<br>
with the tandem image forming apparatus T making it possible to be downsized.<br>
To avoid size-growing in the direction of sheet transportation, the fixing<br>
unit 7 must be placed close to the tandem image forming apparatus T.<br>
However, it is impossible to place the fixing unit 7 in a way that gives enough<br>
space for sheet "s" to bend, and the fixing unit 7 may affect the image forming on<br>
the upper side by the impact generated from the leading end of the sheet "s" as it<br>
approaches the fixing unit 7 (this becomes distinguishable with a thick sheet), or<br>
by the difference between the transport speed of the sheet when it passes<br>
through the fixing unit 7 and when it is transported by the transfer/transport<br>
belt. The indirect transfer type, on the other hand, allows the fixing unit 7 to<br>
be placed in a way that gives sheet "s" an enough space to bend and the fixing<br>
unit 7 has almost no effect on the image forming.<br><br>
For above reasons, the indirect transfer type of the tandem<br>
electrophotographic apparatus is particularly being emphasized recently.<br>
And this type of color electrophotographic apparatus as shown in FIG. 5,<br>
prepares for the next image forming by removing the residual toner on the<br>
photoconductor 1 by the photoconductor cleaning unit 8 to clean the surface of<br>
the photoconductor 1 after the primary transferring. It also prepares for the<br>
next image forming by removing the residual toner on the intermediate<br>
transferring member 4 by the intermediate transferring member cleaning unit 9<br>
to clean the surface of the intermediate transferring member 4 after the<br>
secondary transferring.<br>
The tandem image forming apparatus 100 as shown in FIG. 6 is a<br>
tandem color image forming apparatus. The tandem image forming apparatus<br>
120 is equipped with the copier main body 150, the feeding paper table 200, the<br>
scanner 300 and the automatic document feeder (ADF) 400.<br>
The intermediate transferring member 50 in a form of an endless belt is<br>
placed in the center part of the copier main body 150. The intermediate<br>
transferring member 50 is extended between the support roller 14,15 and 16 as<br>
rotatable in the clockwise direction as shown in FIG. 6. The intermediate<br>
transferring member cleaning unit 17 is placed near the support roller 15 in<br>
order to remove the residual toner on the intermediate transferring member 50.<br>
The tandem developing unit 120 is placed on the intermediate transferring<br>
member 50. In the tandem developing unit, four image forming units 18,<br><br>
yellow, cyan, magenta and black, are positioned in line along the transport<br>
direction in the intermediate transferring member 50, which is being extended<br>
between the support roller 14 and 15. The exposure unit 21 is placed near the<br>
tandem developing unit 120. The secondary transferring unit 22 is placed on<br>
the opposite side where tandem developing unit 120 is placed in the<br>
intermediate transferring member 50. The secondary transfer belt 24, an<br>
endless belt, is extended between a pair of the roller 23 and the transfer paper<br>
transported on the secondary transfer belt 24 and the intermediate transferring<br>
member 50 are accessible to each other in the secondary transferring unit 22.<br>
The fixing unit 25 is placed near the secondary transferring unit 22.<br>
The sheet inversion unit 28 is placed near the secondary transferring<br>
unit 22 and the fixing unit 25 in the tandem image forming apparatus 100, in<br>
order to invert the transfer paper to form images on both sides of the transfer<br>
paper.<br>
The full-color image formation, color copy, using the tandem developing<br>
unit 120 is explained. At the start, a document is set on the document table<br>
130 of the automatic document feeder (ADF) 400 or the automatic document<br>
feeder 400 is opened and a document is set on the contact glass 32 of the scanner<br>
300 and the automatic document feeder 400 is closed.<br>
By pushing the start switch (not shown), the scanner 300 is activated<br>
after the document was transported and moved onto the contact glass 32 when<br>
the document was set on the automatic document feeder 400, or the scanner 300<br><br>
is activated right after, when the document was set onto the contact glass 32,<br>
and the first carrier 33 and the second carrier 34 will start running. The light<br>
from the light source is irradiated from the first carrier 33 simultaneously with<br>
the light reflected from the document surface is reflected by the mirror of second<br>
carrier 34. Then the scanning sensor 36 receives the light via the imaging lens<br>
35 and the color copy (color image) is scanned to provide image information of<br>
black, yellow, magenta and cyan.<br>
Each image information for black, yellow, magenta and cyan is<br>
transmitted to each image forming unit 18: black image forming unit, yellow<br>
image forming unit, magenta image forming unit and cyan image forming unit,<br>
of the tandem developing unit 120 and each toner image of black, yellow,<br>
magenta and cyan is formed in each image forming unit. The image forming<br>
unit 18: black image forming unit, yellow image forming unit, magenta image<br>
forming unit and cyan image forming unit of the tandem image forming<br>
apparatus 120 as shown in FIG. 7 is equipped with the photoconductor 10:<br>
photoconductor 10K for black, photoconductor 10Y for yellow, photoconductor<br>
10M for magenta and photoconductor 10 C for cyan, the charger 60 that charges<br>
photoconductor evenly, an exposing unit by which the photoconductor is exposed<br>
imagewise corresponding to each color images based on each color image<br>
information as indicated by L in FIG. 7 to form a latent electrostatic image<br>
corresponding to each color image on the photoconductor, the developing unit 61<br>
by which the latent electrostatic image is developed using each color toner: black<br><br>
toner, yellow toner, magenta toner and cyan toner to form toner images, the<br>
charge-transferring unit 62 by which the toner image is transferred onto the<br>
intermediate transferring member 50, the photoconductor cleaning unit 63 and<br>
the discharger 64. The image forming unit 18 is able to form each<br>
single-colored image: black, yellow, magenta and cyan images, based on each<br>
color image information. These formed images: black image formed on the<br>
photoconductor 10K for black, yellow image formed on the photoconductor 10Y<br>
for yellow, magenta image formed on the photoconductor 10M for magenta and<br>
cyan image formed on the photoconductor 10C for cyan, are transferred<br>
sequentially onto the intermediate transferring member 50 which is being<br>
rotationally transported by the support rollers 14,15 and 16 (the primary<br>
transferring). And the black, yellow, magenta and cyan images are overlapped<br>
to form a synthesized color image, a color transfer image.<br>
In the feeding table 200, one of the feeding rollers 142 is selectively<br>
rotated and sheets (recording paper) are rendered out from one of a plurality of<br>
feeding cassettes in the paper bank 143 and sent out to feeding path 146 after<br>
being separated one by one by the separation roller 145. The sheets are then<br>
transported to the feeding path 148 in the copier main body 150 by the transport<br>
roller 147 and are stopped running down to the resist roller 49. Alternatively,<br>
sheets (recording paper) on the manual sheet tray 51 are rendered out by<br>
rotating a feeding roller 150, inserted into the manual feeding path 53 after<br>
being separated one by one by the separation roller 52 and stopped by running<br><br>
down to the resist roller 49 in the same way. Generally, the resist roller 49 is<br>
used being grounded; however, it is also usable while bias is imposed for the<br>
sheet powder removal.<br>
The resist roller 49 is rotated in synchronism with the synthesized color<br>
image (color transfer image) on the intermediate transferring member 50, and a<br>
sheet (recording paper) is sent out between the intermediate transferring<br>
member 50 and the secondary transferring unit 22. The color image is then<br>
formed on the sheet (recording paper) by transferring (secondary transferring)<br>
the synthesized color image (color transfer image) by the secondary transferring<br>
unit 22. The residual toner on the intermediate transferring member 50 after<br>
the image transfer is cleaned by the intermediate transferring member cleaning<br>
unit 17.<br>
The sheet (recording paper) on which the color image is transferred and<br>
formed is taken out by the secondary transferring unit 22 and sent out to the<br>
fixing unit 25 in order to fix the synthesized color image (color transfer image)<br>
onto the sheet (recording paper) under the thermal pressure. Triggered by the<br>
switch claw 55, the sheet (recording paper) is discharged by the discharge roller<br>
56 and stacked on the discharge tray 57. Alternatively, triggered by the switch<br>
claw 55, the sheet is inverted by the sheet inversion unit 28 and led to the<br>
transfer position again. After recording an image on the back side, the sheet is<br>
then discharged by the discharge roller 56 and stacked on the discharge tray 57.<br>
The image forming method and image forming apparatus of the<br><br>
invention can produce high quality images efficiently since the method and<br>
apparatus uses the toner of the invention which corresponds to a<br>
low-temperature fixing system, is excellent in both of offset resistance and<br>
anti-heat preservability and especially, even after a large number of copies are to<br>
be produced over a long period, the toner does not aggregate to each other,<br>
deterioration of flowability, transferability, and fixing ability is extremely rare,<br>
the toner makes it possible to form stable images on any transferring medium<br>
without transfer errors and with good reproducibility, and further does not<br>
contaminate fixing unit and images.<br>

and mixed in a TK homomixer at a rotation speed of 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes<br>
and filtered twice to obtain a filter cake.<br>
The filter cake was then dried in a circulating air dryer at 45°C for 48<br>
hours, and sieved through a sieve of 75 µm mesh to obtain a toner-base particle.<br>
This is referred to as "toner-base particle 1".<br>

For the obtained "toner 1", volume average particle diameter (Dv),<br>
particle size distribution (Dv/Dn), average circularity, 1/2 flown-out temperature<br>
Tma, 1/2 flown-out temperature after melt kneading of toner Tmb, difference<br>
between Tma and Tmb, ΔTm, gel content, molecular mass peak, and<br><br>
glass-transition temperature (Tg) were measured as follows. Results are<br>
shown in Table 2.<br><volume average particle diameter and size distribution><br>
The volume average particle diameter and particle size distribution of a<br>
toner at an aperture diameter of 100 µm was measured using a particle size<br>
meter, Coulter Counter TA-II by Coulter Electronics Ltd. And the figure of<br>
volume average particle diameter / number average particle diameter was<br>
calculated based on these results.<br><average circularity><br>
The average circularity of the toner was measured by a flow type<br>
particle image analyzer, FPIA-2100 by Sysmex Corporation. Specifically, the<br>
measurement was performed by adding 0.1 ml to 0.5 ml of alkylbenzene<br>
sulfonate surfactant as a dispersing agent to 100 ml to 150 ml of water from<br>
which solid impurities had been removed in advance, in a container, and then<br>
0.1 g to 0.5 g of each toner was added and dispersed. The dispersion was<br>
subjected to dispersion treatment for 1 minute to 3 minutes using an ultrasonic<br>
disperser by Honda Electronics, and the toner shapes and distribution were<br>
measured by the above apparatus at a dispersion concentration of 3,000/µl to<br>
10,000/µl and the average circularity was calculated from the result above.<br><l flown-out temperature tma flownout after></l>
melt-kneading of toner, Difference between Tma, and Tmb ΔTm &gt;<br>
The 1/2 flownout temperature of toner was measured using a capillary<br><br>
type flow tester (CFT500C, by Shimadzu Corporation) under the conditions of<br>
Load 30 kg, Die diameter 1 mm, Temperature rising rate 3°C/min.<br>
The toner was melt-kneaded by batch type kneading using a Labo<br>
Plastomill 4C 150 type (by Toyo Seiki Seisaku-sho, Ltd.). The toner amount<br>
was 45 g, heating temperature 130°C, rotation number 50 rpm, and kneading<br>
time 15 minutes.<br><gel content><br>
The gel content was measured as follows. 1 g of toner was weighed, to<br>
this, 100 g of tetrahydrofuran (THF) was added, and left at 10°C for 20 hours to<br>
30 hours. After 20 hours to 30 hours, gel fraction, THF insoluble components,<br>
absorbed THF as a solvent, and swelled to precipitate, and then this wass<br>
separated with a filter paper. Separated gel fraction was heated at 120°C for 3<br>
hours, absorbed THF was volatilized, and then mass was weighed. Thus, gel<br>
fraction was measured.<br><molecular mass peak><br>
Molecular mass peak of the toner was measured as follows. The<br>
column inside the heat chamber of 40°C was stabilized. At this temperature,<br>
THF as a column solvent was drained at a current speed of 1ml/minute and 50µl<br>
to 200µl of THF sample fluid whereof a sample density was adjusted to 0.05% by<br>
mass to 0.6% by mass, was poured and measured. In the measurement of<br>
molecular mass of the sample, a molecular mass distribution of the sample was<br>
calculated from the relationship between log values of the analytical curve made<br><br>
from several monodisperse polystyrene standard samples and counted numbers.<br>
The standard polystyrene sample for making analytical curves was the one with<br>
a molecular mass of 6x102,2.1x102, 4x102 1.75x104, 5.1x104, 1.1x105, 3.9x105,<br>
8.6x105, 2x106 and 4.48x106 by Toyo Soda Manufacturing Co., Ltd. A refractive<br>
index (RI) detector was used for the detector.<br><glass_transition temperature><br>
The glass-transition temperature can be measured using TG-DSC<br>
system TAS100 (available from Rigaku DenM Co., Ltd.) according to the<br>
following method. Initially, about 10 mg of toner is placed in an aluminum<br>
sample vessel. The vessel is placed on a holder unit, which is then set in an<br>
electric furnace. The sample is heated from room temperature to 150°C at a<br>
temperature rising rate of 10°C /min. After being allowed to stand at 150°C for<br>
10 minutes, the sample is cooled to room temperature and allowed to stand for<br>
10 minutes. Then, in a nitrogen flow, DSC measurement is carried out using a<br>

Remelting means such a phenomenon that the toner, adhered to a<br>
fixing roller at the time of fixing, is transferred to a pressure roller and the<br>
toner is collected by a cleaning roller; however, the collected adhered toner<br>
starts to melt again due to the heat of a heating roller, and the remelted toner<br>
is transferred to a pressure roller, resulting in adhesion to or contamination of<br>
images.<br>
As the test method, continuous running of remelting is carried out in<br>
which toner is allowed to adhere to a cleaning roller and whether or not the<br>
toner has remelted is observed. Images were produced according to the<br>

In any of Examples B-l to B-5, fixing at low temperatures could be<br>
achieved, and smear due to remelting of toner from a fixing cleaning roller was<br>
not observed.<br>
In Comparative Example B-1, the toner did not have resin fine particles,<br>
had a large particle diameter and poor fixing property at low temperatures.<br>
The toner had decreased flowability because the amount of particles of 3 µm or<br>
less was large.<br>

and had deteriorated hot offset property, and smear due to remelting of toner<br>
from a fixing cleaning roller was observed.<br>
In Comparative Example B-3, lower limit of fixing was high because the<br>
glass-transition temperature (Tg) of resin fine particles was high.<br>
In Comparative Example B-4, anti-heat preservability was deteriorated<br>
because the glass-transition temperature (Tg) of resin fine particles was low.<br>
In Comparative Example B-5, 1/2 flown-out temperature after<br>
mastication was low, and thus smear due to remelting of toner from a fixing<br>
cleaning roller was observed.<br>
In Comparative Example B-6, the toner did not have resin fine particles,<br><br>
had a high glass-transition temperature (Tg), and thus had deteriorated fixing<br>
