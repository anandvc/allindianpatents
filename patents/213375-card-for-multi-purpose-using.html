CARD FOR MULTI-PURPOSE USING<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
1. Field of the<br><br>
Invention<br><br><br><br>
10<br><br>
The present invention generally relates to a multi-functional card, and more particularly, to a card suitable for utilizing in a magnetic stripe card reader, an IC card reader, and an optical driver. Such card contains multi-functions of a magnetic stripe card, an IC card and an optical disc, thereby improving the convenience, memory capacity, security, and functionality.<br>
2. Description of the Prior Art<br><br>
cards such as identification.<br>
Rapidly towards  an information community, recently people have already entered a plastic card era. Every one holds, in his wallet, plenty of magnetic stripe cards and IC cards for finance management, security, medical treatment and entrance guard purpose.<br><br>

represents the chip 19 of the socket 115 of<br>
The dual<br>
Please refer to FIG. 1A and FIG. IB, which represent a three-dimensional view and a cross-sectional view of a dual mode (IC chip/magnetic stripe) card, respectively. The dual mode card 15 comprises a magnetic stripe 17 and an IC chip 19 formed on a plastic card according to International Standard ISO 7816 (85.6mm x 53.98mm x 0.8mm). "A"<br>

thickness. The data stored in the magnetic stripe 17 or the IC dual mode card 15 can be read through a wiping slot 113 or a a card reader 11.mode card 15 is convenient for its small size and portability.<br>
However, a magnetic stripe only has a memory capacity of 1.2K bytes and<br>
 25     an IC chip on a conventional IC card only has a memory capacity of 250K bytes. It is obvious that such a dual mode card is limited in its memory size and is insufficient for the modern applications.<br>
Please   refer   to   FIG.   2A   and   FIG.   2B,   which   represent   a<br>
three-dimensional view and a cross-sectional view of a conventional optical<br>
30    disc, respectively. According to Compact Disc Digital Audio Standard<br><br>
2 <br>
10<br>
15<br><br>
introduced by Philips and Sony, commonly known as "the Red Book," and Compact Disc Recordable (CD-R) Standard introduced by Philips and Sony, commonly mown as "the Orange Book, Part II", the optical disc 20 has a diameter of 120mm (or 80mm) and a thickness of 1.2mm. "B" represents the thickness. In addition, there is provided an aperture 21 in the center of the optical disc 20. Around the aperture 21 is a reading zone 25, comprising a storage medium 257 sandwiched between a transparent substrate 259 and a passive layer 253. The data such as audio data, video data and large software systems can be digitally processed as 0's and l's. Those of ordinary skill in the art are readily aware that the storage medium 257 contain areas of high reflectivity (land) 255 and low reflectivity (pit) 251. When read with a laser, a transition from land to pit or from pit to land represents a "1", and all other areas represents a "0". When one wants to read the da a stored in the optical disc 20, all he has to do is insert the optical disc 20 into an optical driver 30. A motor 39 in the optical driver 30 drives the ODtical disc 20 via the aperture 21. Then, the stored data can be read at a distance "C" between the storage medium 257 and the optical head 32 by using a laser 31 accompanied with a splitter 33, a detector 35, and a transmission device 37.<br><br><br><br>
20<br><br><br>
Conven<br>
ionally, the optical disc 20 includes memory capacity of 650M<br>
bytes, which is more suitable for large software system than a dual mode card 15 having memory capacity of 250K bytes. However, the diameter of such an optical disc is 120mm and is not as portable as the dual card 15. Therefore, developing a card-shaped compact disc with memory capacity of<br><br>
25     50M bytes<br>
would be encouraging. Examples are seen in US Pat. No.<br>
6,016,298, entitled "Calling card" (Adivan High Tech AG, Wangen, CH) and in R.O.C. (Taiwan) Pat. No. 374375, entitled "Card-shaped compact disc" (RITEK Corp., TW), as denoted by the device 40 in FIG. 3.<br>
Even though the card-shaped compact disc is convenient for its 30 portability like IC cards and magnetic stripe cards. However, the card-shaped compact disc has a thickness of 1.2mm (B), while the dual mode card has a thickness of 0.8mm (A), resulting in a difference of 0.4mm. Therefore, there is technical difficulty with combining the both advantages of the card-shaped compact disc and the dual mode card; such as 35     convenience for either magnetic stripe or IC chip reading and  larger<br><br>

memory capacity accessing.<br>
i i<br>
allowed is no more than 0.1mm; otherwise, errors in focusing g may occur and lead to failure in reading data from the optical disc.<br><br>
For example, if a thickness of 1.2mm (B) is'chosen, it is impossible to perform magnetic stripe and IC chip reading in a conventional card reader 11, and thus to read out the recorded data from the magnetic stripe 17 and the IC chip 19. On the contrary, if a thickness of 0.8mm (A) is chosen, it is impossible for the detector 35 to precisely determine the 0's or l's stored in the storage medium 257 when a card is inserted into the optical driver 30, because the. distance between the storage medium 257 and the optical head 32 is smaller than "C". Based on the theoretical analysis, the depth of the pit 251 is one fourth (1/4) of the wavelength of the laser 31. The distance difference and trackiri  <br><br><br>

stripe/IC c advantages<br>
Therefore, there is need in providing a novel card for multi-purpose using, combining the functions of a conventional dual mode (magnetic<br>
lip) card and a conventional optical disc, so as to achieve such as convenience for either magnetic stripe or IC chip<br><br>
reading and larger memory capacity accessing.<br>

The sum of the thickness of the card 80 (Al) and. the thickness of the card thin film 82 (A2) is about 0.8mm, which conforms to International Standard ISO 7816 (0.76mm ~ 0.82mm). For example, the thickness of the card 80 (Al) is 0.6mm, while the thickness of the card thin film 82 (A2) is 0.2mm. Therefore, a card 80 attached with a card thin film 82 can be read by performing magnetic stripe swiping and/or IC chip accessing in a card reader so as to read the data stored in the magnetic stripe 87 or the IC chip 89. Apparently, the thickness of the loading zone 93 can be expressed as D3 = B3-A3, wherein B3 denotes the thickness of the casing plate 90 and A3 denotes the depth of the loading zone 93. In order to fit in with Compact Disc Digital Audio Standard known as "the Red Book," and Compact Disc Recordable (CD-R) Standard known as "the Orange Book, Part II", the sum of the thickness of the card 80 (Al) and the thickness of the loading zone 93 (D3) is determined to be about 1.2mm. For example, in the present embodiment, the" sum of the thickness of the card 80 (Al) is 0.6 mm, while the thickness of the loading zone 93 (D3) is 0.6 mm. Therefore, when a card 80 attached with a card thin film 82 is stored fixedly in the loading zone 93 of the casing plate 90, the thickness of the reading area 85 could be 1.2mm by combining with the loading zone 93. In this manner, such a card for multi-purpose using can be inserted into and accessed by a conventional optical drive, as shown in FIG. 9.<br><br><br><br>
