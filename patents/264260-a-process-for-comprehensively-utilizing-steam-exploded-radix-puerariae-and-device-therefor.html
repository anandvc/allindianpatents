				<td>Description<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a comprehensive utilization of plant resources, in particular, to a process for co-producing ethanol and Radix Pueranae flavones as well as utilizing Radix Pueranae fibers from Radix Pueranae, and also to a device used therein The process comprises the following steps first pretreatmg the raw matenal, i e Radix Pueranae, by steam explosion, producing fuel ethanol by continuously coupled solid state fermentation of Radix Pueranae starch, then extracting Radix Pueranae flavones and Radix Pueranae fibers from residues of the solid state fermentation, thereby accomplishing a graded transformation, comprehensive and clean utilization of Radix Pueranae<br>
Background of the art<br>
Radix Pueranae is the underground root of Puerana, 1 e a perennial leguminous plant As first recorded in Shennong's Chinese Materia Medice, Radix Pueranae was listed as a medium grade drug Because of being nch in starch and isoflavones, Radix Pueranae is listed as both food and medicme by the Ministry of Health There are more than 30 types of Puerana in the world, which are distnbuted m China, Japan and southeast Asia Among others, China, owning about 9 types of Puerana and 2 mutations thereof, is the distnbution center Puerana resources, including P Lobata(will)Ohwi, P Thomsom Berth, P edulis Pamp, P Omeiensis Wang, and P pedunculans Crah ex Benth, etc are all over the whole country, wherein P Lobata(will)Ohwi and P Thomsom Berth are the most common Pueraiaee and have the highest resource amount From a preliminary calculation, the growth area of Puerana (including wild and cultivated) is approximately 400,000 hm2, and the annual resource amount is over 1,500,000 tons Radix Pueranae has become the focus of economic crop development project in many places in China, so its planting area is huge<br>
The main components of Radix Pueranae are starch, cellulose, protein and Radix Pueranae isoflavones, and a small amount of fat, pectin, tannin and alkaloid, etc are also contained It is reported that the dry Radix Pueranae has 50-60% of starch, 9-15% of cellulose, 5-8% of raw protein and 3-5% of isoflavones However, the fresh Radix Pueranae contains about 50-60% of water, and 18 5-27 5% of starch. Therefore, when considering extracting and utilizing Radix Pueranae flavones, le the active pharmaceutical ingredient of Radix Pueranae, Radix Pueranae, as a starch-type energy source plant, may also be fermented to produce ethanol<br>
It has been reported that Hie extraction methods of Radix Pueranae flavonoids are water extraction method, alcohol extraction method, water extraction and alcohol precipitation method, alcohol extraction and water precipitation method, and the like In 1970s, Radix Pueranae flavonoids were prepared by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences by means of a basic lead acetate precipitation method, I e a classic alcoholization method of flavones Nevertheless, such method commonly causes heavy metal contamination, so it is not suitable to be used m pharmaceutical industry Although the components of Radix Pueranae are very complicated, the pretreatment of Radix Pueranae for the extraction of flavones normally is only a simple mechanical crush<br>
The current application of Radix Pueranae's active ingredients is most likely in the processes for extracting Radix Pueranae starch and flavones, respectively However, since Radix Pueranae contains a large amount of fibers, the mechanical crush requires a lot of energy, which leads to a complicated and incompleted starch extraction process and causes a waste of raw material If the extracted Radix Pueranae starch is utilized to produce ethanol according to the process for producing ethanol from food-type starch, l e a process of steam boiling at a high or low temperature - gelatinizing - liquefying - sacchanfymg - liquid fermenting - pnmary distilling, wherein the energy depleted for steam boiling the raw matenal amounts to 30-40% of the total energy needed for the production of ethanol Furthermore, such a process results in a great amount of highly concentrated organic waste water, which is not only likely to pollute the environment but also difficult to be used to<br>
extract Radix Pueranae flavones Thus, for reasonably utilizing Radix Pueranae resources, it is required to make use of the charactenstics of Radix Pueranae and develop a process suitable for co-producing ethanol and Radix Pueranae flavones as well as utilizing Radix Pueranae fibers from Radix Pueranae, thereby accomplishing a comprehensive utilization of Radix Pueranae resources<br>

For the above purposes, we measured some critical indexes for realizing the system of the invention, the results are shown as follows<br>
1 The influence of steam explosion pressure on Radix Pueranae<br>
Radix Pueranae was steam exploded under a steam pressure of 0 5~ 1 0 Mpa for 2 5 mm The contents of water, water-soluble reducing sugar and water-soluble total sugar of Radix Pueranae as well as the yield of Radix Pueranae flavones after pretreatment under different steam explosion conditions were measured respectively The results are shown m Table 1<br>
Table 1 the effect of steam explosion pressure on Radix Pueranae<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
As shown in Table 1, the effect of pre-treatment by steam explosion on Radix Pueranae was different under different steam pressures Steaming increased the water content of Radix Puerariae after steam explosion As the steam explosion pressure increased, the contents of water-soluble reducing sugar and water-soluble total sugar first increased and then decreased The heating mechanical chemical action of the steam explosion broke cell walls of plant tissues, damaged structures of the solid material (i e Radix Pueranae), and raised the sugar concentration generated from the hydrolysis of Radix Pueranae starch However, when the steam explosion pressure was further increased, the water-soluble sugar in the materials might be lost for undesired reactions The amount of extracted Radix Pueranae flavonoids was closely related to the charactenstics of the materials The dextnnization level of Radix Pueranae starch was also different after the treatment under different steam explosion pressures, which directly affected the separation of Radix Pueranae flavones Therefore, after the steam explosion treatment, the amount of extracted Radix Pueranae in the matenals varied with the steam explosion pressure Selecting a suitable pressure will increase the amount of extracted Radix Pueranae flavones Based on the preliminary consideration of the steam explosion effect of Radix Puerariae, 0 8 Mpa was selected as the steam explosion pressure for the following experiments<br>
2 The effect of steam explosion pressure holding time on Radix Pueranae<br>
According to the experiment concerning the effect of steam explosion pressure on Radix Pueranae, 0 8MPa was selected as the steam explosion pressure m this experiment The pressure was mamtamed for 2 0-4 0 mm The contents of water, water-soluble reducing sugar and water-soluble total sugar as well as the yield of Radix Pueranae flavones after different steam explosion pressure holding times were measured respectively The results are shown m Table 2<br>
Table 2   the effect of steam explosion pressure on Radix Pueranae<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
As shown in Table 2, the length of the steam explosion pressure holding time directly influenced the effect of the pretreatment on the matenals When the pressure was maintained at 0 8MPa for 3 5 mm, the contents of water-soluble reducing sugar and water-soluble total sugar as well as the amount of extracted Radix Pueranae flavones all reached a better level<br>
3 The changes of components of Radix Pueranae before and after the steam explosion treatment<br>
The main components of Radix Pueranae not only include starch and Radix Pueranae flavones, but also include approximately 10% raw fibers Does the steam explosion treatment also affect these components? Therefore, we measured the Radix Pueranae components before and after steam explosion The results are shown in Table 3 It was shown that before and after steam explosion, the component contents in Radix Pueranae vaned dramatically After the steam explosion treatment, the component of neutral detergents decreased by about 10%, I e from 70 7112% m the Radix Pueranae before steam explosion to about 60% in the steam exploded Radix Pueranae The relative content of<br>
cellulose in Radix Pueranae did not change much, 1 e change from 8 17% before steam explosion to about 10% after the explosion But the relative content of hemicellulose increased by about 30%, i e from 19 0253% to about 25 0% The changing tendency of the relative content of hgnin is not very clear, whereas after steam explosion, the relative content of ash increased from 0 8254% of the onginal Radix Pueranae to about 1 5%, I e almost doubled<br>

4 Ethanol fermentation of Radix Pueranae after steam explosion treatment<br>
Glucoamylase was added to the pre-treated Radix Pueranae in an amount of 65 U<br>
glucoamylase per gram of dry steam exploded Radix Pueranae   Sacchanfication was<br>
performed m 58°C water bath for 30 mm The saccharified materials were cooled down to 30-35°C, and sterilized with UV for 15-20 mm Under sterile conditions, (NH4)2SO4, KH2PO4 and an activated yeast were added, and continuous solid state fermentation was earned out to produce ethanol The yield of ethanol, the contents of remaining reducing sugar and remaining total sugar m the fermented materials, as well as the amount of Radix Puerariae flavones extracted from the fermented materials were measured respectively The results are shown in Table 4<br>
Table 4 the fermentation production of ethanol with steam exploded Radix Puerariae<br>
(based on fermented materials)<br>
(TABLE REMOVED) <br>
AS shown in Table 4, the steam explosion pressure was raised from 0 5MPa to 1 OMPa, and also held for 2 5 nun The yield of ethanol in the fermented materials tended to first increase and then decrease When fermentation was performed after the steam explosion treatment under 0 7MPa and with a pressure hoidmg time of 2 5mm, the yield of ethanol in the<br>
fermented materials was the highest, reaching 9 62%, whereas the yield of flavones in the fermented materials increased as the steam explosion pressure became larger When the steam explosion pressure was maintained at 0 8MPa, and the pressure holdmg time was extended from 2 0 mm to 4 0 nun, the effect of the variation m steam explosion pressure on the yield of ethanol and the amount of extracted flavones m the fermented matenals was similar to the effect on Radix Pueranae fermentation When fermentation was performed after the steam explosion treatment under 0 8MPa and with a pressure holding time of 3 5 mm, the yield of ethanol in the fermented matenals could reach 8 01%, and the extraction rate of Radix Pueranae flavones reached 0 8917% Regarding the yield of ethanol from the Radix Pueranae fermentation, as well as the amount of Radix Pueranae flavones extracted from the fermented matenals, the optimized condition for pre-treatmg Radix Pueranae by low pressure steam explosion was 0 8MPa and a pressure holding time of 3 5 mm<br>
5	The extraction of flavones from the fuel ethanol residues obtained from Radix Pueranae<br>
fermentation<br>
It can be seen m Table 4 that after Radix Pueranae was pre-treated by steam explosion under 0 8MPa for a pressure holing time of 3 5 min, the amount of Radix Pueranae flavones extracted from the residues of the solid state fermentation for producing ethanol reached 0 8917% (based on the fermented matenals) The water content of the fermented matenals was 75 71%, whereas approximately 46g dry matenals were obtamed after the fermentation of lOOg dry Radix Pueranae Based on these, it was calculated that approximately 1 7g flavones was extracted from the residues obtained from the fermentation of every l00g dry Radix Pueranae, which maintained the same level as the amount of flavones extracted from the matenals before fermentation Radix Pueranae was extracted at the same time the ethanol was fermented<br>
6	The classifying and utilizing of the Radix Pueranae fibers in the fermentation residues<br>
Ethanol fermentation was performed after the different parts of Radix Pueranae were<br>
pre-treated by steam explosion The components of the fermentation residues were measured,<br>
and the results were shown in Table 5 The different parts of Radix Pueranae were subjected<br>
to ethanol fermentation, respectively The content of raw fibers in the fermentation residues was 18 245~29 889% The content of hemicellulose in the fermentation residues of Radix Pueranae was 52 154%, which was much higher than the contents of hemicellulose in the fermentation residues of other parts However, the contents of hemicellulose in the fermentation residues of Radix Pueranae stalks and leafstalks were only 29 391% and 27 438%, respectively<br>
The fermentation residues (60-70%) were dned directly with hot air until the water content reached about 25% Then two portions, l e fiber portion and protein powder portion were mechanically classified using ratchets Among those, the fiber portion accounted for 70% of the total fermentation residues and its fiber length was measured as 2 4mm at maximum, 0 75mm at minimum, and 1 59 on average, so it is a nice raw material for making paper The protein powder portion (short fiber portion) contained about 21 8% of protein, so it may be used as raw matenal for feedstuff<br>

7	Process and embodiments<br>
Based on above experimental results, we chose to co-produce ethanol and Radix Pueranae flavones as well as utilize Radix Pueranae fibers after pre-treating Radix Pueranae with low pressure steam explosion.<br>
8	The pnmary features of the process<br>
Starting from the charactenstics of Radix Pueranae, a graded transformation and a<br>
comprehensive and clean utilization of Radix Pueranae components were accomplished, with the features and merits shown below<br>
1)	A novel steam explosion method for Radix Pueranae without pollution<br>
Radix Pueranae is pre-treated by means of a short-time (2-4 nun) nonpolluting steam explosion technique The heat mechanical chemical action of the steam explosion breaks cell walls of plant tissues, damages structures of the solid matenal 1 e Radix Pueranae, and raises the dextruuzation rate of Radix Pueranae starch The steam exploded Radix Pueranae can be fermented directly to produce fuel ethanol The pre-treatment of Radix Pueranae with the steam explosion technique avoids a long-time steam boiling procedure (30-120 mm) of the raw material starch, reduces the energy depleted in the fermentation for producing ethanol, shortens the penod of production, and decreases the cost of production<br>
2)	A novel method for synchronously sacchanfied solid state fermentation Radix Pueranae If the synchronously sacchanfied solid state fermentation is utilized to produce ethanol, only a small amount of water is required to be added, which dramatically lowers the water content in the fermented mash. Such method is used to reduce the energy depletion for distillation while increasing the ethanol content in the fermented mash, thereby cutting down the succeeding procedures for disposing water waste, providing conditions for reusing the fermentation residues while performing a clean production and reducing the production cost So it benefits the comprehensive utilization of Radix Pueranae<br>
3)	A novel technique for co-producing the fuel ethanol and Radix Pueranae flavones<br>
The synchronously sacchanfied fermentation of Radix Pueranae to produce fuel ethanol is a process in which the structure of Radix Pueranae fibers is damaged, Radix Pueranae starch is released and the fuel ethanol is made from Radix Pueranae starch If Radix Pueranae flavonoids are not extracted from the residues when the synchronously saccharified fermentating Radix Pueranae is used to produce the fuel ethanol, it not only causes resource waste, but also gives nse to environment issues If Radix Pueranae flavones are extracted from the fermentation residues, Radix Pueranae will be utilized comprehensively, which<br>
boosts the economic effects and benefits the industrial production of Radix Pueranae<br>
4)	A method for producing ethanol by continuous solid state fermentation<br>
There is a problem that the Radix Pueranae solid state fermentation ethanol technique can not be earned out continuously As such, the invention provides a method for performmg the Radix Pueranae solid state fermentation ethanol using a continuous solid state fermentation device A study of ethanol fermentation was earned out using the continuous solid state fermentation device shown in Figure 2 Fermentation and separation were coupled m such a device, and CO2 was used as a circulating earner gas to separate the ethanol obtained by fermentation Scorn the fermented matenals In this way, the effect of the heat generated during fermentation on the fermentation may be reduced on the one hand, and the inhibition of ethanol may be decreased on the other hand.<br>
5)	A comprehensive utilization of the remaining fermented fibrous residues<br>
Because the novel process of solid state fermentation is used, the water content in the<br>
fermentation residues is very low (60-70%), which is suitable for the comprehensive<br>
utilization Directly as feedstuff, the residues contain a low level of protein and a high level<br>
of raw fibers Thereby a novel method for separating the fiber portion is developed In such<br>
method, the mechanically separated fibers are used as raw matenai for making paper or<br>
fabnc, whereas the solid powder residues having a high content of protein are used as<br>
protein feedstuff<br>
The results of the study indicate that the fiber content in the fermentation residues is approximately 18% The fiber length of the fiber portion is measured, wherein the maximal length is 2 4 mm, the minimal length is 0 75 mm, and the average length is 1 59 mm, so the fiber portion is a mce raw matenai for making paper The protein powder portion (short fiber portion) contains about 21 8% of protein, so it may be used as raw matenai for feedstuff<br>
6)	A novel method for fermenting the remaining fibrous residues and separating protein<br>
powder<br>
The fermentation residues (60-70%) are dried directly with hot air until the water content reaches about 25% Then the two portions, 1 e the fiber portion and protem powder portion are mechanically classified using ratchets<br>
