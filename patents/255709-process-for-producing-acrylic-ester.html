				<td>PROCESS FOR PRODUCING ACRYLIC ESTER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing<br>
an acrylic ester, and more particularly, to a process for<br>
producing an acrylic ester from acrylic acid and an aliphatic<br>
or alicyclic alcohol having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms using a<br>
strongly acidic cation exchange resin.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Acrylic esters can be produced from acrylic acid and<br>
various alcohols, for example, as disclosed in Japanese Patent<br>
Laid-open Publication No. Shou 52-57116, by an esterification<br>
reaction using a homogeneous catalyst such as sulfuric acid or<br>
phosphoric acid, or alternatively, for example, as disclosed<br>
in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publications Nos. Hei 2-279655 and<br>
Hei 3-52843, by an esterification reaction using a<br>
heterogeneous catalyst such as a strongly acidic cation<br>
exchange resin.<br>
In the continuous production of an acrylic ester, there<br>
have heretofore been carried out operations in which acrylic<br>
acid and an alcohol are esterified in a<br><br>
reactor using a catalyst such as an inorganic acid, e.g. ,<br>
sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid, or a strongly acidic<br>
cation exchange resin, the resulting reaction liquid<br>
is supplied to a low-boiling separation column to<br>
separate it into a high-boiling substance composed<br>
mainly of a generated acrylic ester and a low-boiling<br>
component composed mainly of an unreacted alcohol,<br>
acrylic acid, and generated water, and an acrylic ester<br>
is collected from the former high-boiling substance and<br>
circulated to the reaction system.<br>
In a process using an inorganic acid such as<br>
sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid as an esterification<br>
catalyst (e.g., see Japanese Patent Laid-open<br>
Publication No. Shou 52-57116), the use of a highly<br>
corrosive inorganic acid has no other choice to select<br>
an anti-corrosive material for apparatus, which causes<br>
problems that the apparatus becomes expensive and the<br>
waste liquid treatment to make an inorganic acid<br>
contained in the waste liquid harmless becomes highly<br>
costly.<br>
In an esterification reaction using an ion<br>
exchange resin, there is no drawback that will be<br>
involved when an inorganic acid is used as an<br>
esterification catalyst. As for acrylic acid to be<br>
used as a raw material, acrylic acid purified to remove<br><br>
low-boiling impurities and high-boiling impurities is<br>
used, the production cost of acrylic acid rises due to<br>
the removal of high-boiling impurities, and therefore,<br>
the use of unpurified acrylic acid would become<br>
advantageous. However, when acrylic acid containing<br>
a high-boiling acid component is used as a raw material,<br>
unfavorable polymerization reaction and side reaction<br>
occur, facilities such as piping systems are clogged<br>
by polymers, the unit consumption of acrylic acid or<br>
an alcohol increases, and the quality of a product is<br>
deteriorated. Thus, in Japanese Patent Laid-open<br>
Publication No. 2003-171347, there is proposed a<br>
countermeasure that the concentration of impurities<br>
such as maleic acid, B-acryloxypropionic acid (i.e.,<br>
a dirtier of acrylic acid), furfural, and benzaldehyde<br>
is restricted to a specific concentration or lower.<br>
Of these high-boiling impurities, in particular,<br>
high-boiling acid components such as maleic acid and<br>
β-acryloxypropionic acid can easily be removed from<br>
waste oil in the production of an ester using a<br>
low-boiling alcohol having 4 or less carbon atoms as<br>
a raw material, thereby causing no particular problem.<br>
However, in the production of an ester using an<br>
aliphatic or alicyclic alcohol having from 5 to 8 carbon<br>
atoms as a raw material, it is difficult to separate<br><br>
high-boiling acid components, which has remarkable<br>
influences on the loss in quality of a product and the<br>
deterioration of the unit consumption of the main raw<br>
material, and which requires uneconomical operation,<br>
thereby causing serious problems. In particular,<br>
β-acryloxypropionic acid is generated during the<br>
storage after the acrylic acid production process, and<br>
therefore, the control of temperature and the like<br>
during the storage are sometimes required, which makes<br>
it difficult to maintain the stable quality and the low<br>
unit consumption of raw materials in the production of<br>
an acrylic ester.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Under these circumstances, it is an object of the<br>
present invention to provide a process for producing<br>
an acrylic ester with excellent economic efficiency,<br>
which can eliminate the conventional problems to<br>
maintain the stable quality and the low unit<br>
consumption of raw materials, in the process for<br>
producing an acrylic ester using acrylic acid<br>
containing high-boiling acid components such as maleic<br>
acid and β-acryloxypropionic acid influencing the loss<br>
in quality and the unit consumption of raw materials,<br>
and an aliphatic or alicyclic alcohol having from 5 to<br><br>
8 carbon atoms as raw materials, and using a strongly<br>
acidic cation exchange resin as a catalyst.<br>
The present inventors have made various studies,<br>
and as a result, they have found the following facts<br>
to complete the present invention: in the production<br>
of an acrylic ester from acrylic acid and an aliphatic<br>
or alicyclic alcohol having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms<br>
using a strongly acidic cation exchange resin, the<br>
yield of a product acrylic ester can be improved without<br>
lowering the quality of a product and the amount of waste<br>
oil can be reduced to improve production efficiency by<br>
supplying the bottom liquid of a rectifying column, in<br>
which a crude acrylic ester is rectified, to a<br>
high-boiling separation column and/or a thin-film<br>
evaporator to separate it into an acrylic ester<br>
component and a high-boiling substance, and by taking<br>
out the separated acrylic ester component as a<br>
distillate and supplying it to the low-boiling<br>
separation column for its recovery; and further, an<br>
acrylic ester can be produced at the lower unit<br>
consumption of raw materials, while maintaining the<br>
stable quality of a product, by mixing all or part of<br>
the distillate from the high-boiling separation column<br>
and/or the thin-film evaporator with water to carry out<br>
the extraction treatment of high-boiling acid<br><br>
components. In particular, the application of the<br>
extraction treatment is also effective for reducing the<br>
burdens on the purification of raw material acrylic<br>
acid and the storage management by making it possible<br>
to expand the width of high-boiling acid component<br>
content in acrylic acid which can be used in the<br>
production of an acrylic ester from acrylic acid<br>
influenced markedly by high-boiling acid components<br>
such as maleic acid and β-acryloxypropionic acid, and<br>
an aliphatic or alicyclic alcohol having from 5 to 8<br>
carbon atoms.<br>
That is, the present invention provides a process<br>
for producing an acrylic ester by supplying acrylic<br>
acid and an aliphatic or alicvclic alcohol having from<br>
5 to 8 carbon atoms to an esterification reactor to cause<br>
an esterification reaction using a strongly acidic<br>
cation exchange resin as a catalyst in the reactor, the<br>
process comprising supplying an obtained reaction<br>
product to a low-boiling separation column to distill<br>
an alcohol, acrylic acid, and water from a top of the<br>
low-boiling separation column, and separating them<br>
into a water phase and an organic phase containing the<br>
alcohol and acrylic acid, the organic phase being<br>
circulated as a circulated liquid to the reactor,<br>
supplying a crude acrylic ester, which is withdrawn<br><br>
from a bottom of the low-boiling separation column, to<br>
a rectifying column, taking out a rectified acrylic<br>
ester from a top of the rectifying column, and supplying<br>
a high-boiling substance containing an acrylic ester,<br>
which is withdrawn from a bottom of the rectifying<br>
column, to a high-boiling separation column and/or a<br>
thin-film evaporator to separate it into an acrylic<br>
ester component and a high-boiling substance, the<br>
separated acrylic ester component being taken out as<br>
a distillate and supplied to the low-boiling separation<br>
column for its recovery.<br>
The process for producing an acrylic ester<br>
according to the present invention preferably further<br>
comprises, before the distillate taken out from the<br>
high-boiling separation column and/or the thin-film<br>
evaporator is supplied to the low-boiling separation<br>
column for its recovery, mixing all or part of the<br>
distillate with water to extract and remove a<br>
high-boiling acid component contained in the<br>
distillate into a water phase, and supplying an<br>
obtained organic phase to the low-boiling separation<br>
column for its recovery. For the extraction and<br>
removal of the high-boiling acid component, a process<br>
wastewater generated in a step of producing an acrylic<br>
ester can preferably be used. The process wastewater<br><br>
may include reaction water generated in the<br>
esterification reaction and/or steam drain exhausted<br>
when a steam ejector is used for reducing pressure in<br>
a pressure reduction step included in a step of<br>
producing an acrylic ester. The ratio of water to be<br>
used to extract and remove the high-boiling acid<br>
component, relative to the distillate taken from the<br>
high-boiling separation column and/or the thin-film<br>
evaporator, may preferably be within a range of from<br>
0.5:1 to 2.0:1, more preferably from 0.8:1 to 1.5:1,<br>
by mass ratio.<br>
In the process for producing an acrylic ester<br>
according to the present invention, the acrylic acid<br>
to be used as a raw material is acrylic acid containing<br>
high-boiling acid components such as maleic acid and<br>
β-acryloxypropionic acid, for example, acrylic acid<br>
containing from 10 to 5,000 ppm of maleic acid and/or<br>
from 10 to 5,000 ppm of β-acryloxypropionic acid,<br>
preferably acrylic acid containing from 10 to 500 ppm<br>
of maleic acid and/or from 10 to 3,600 ppm of<br>
β-acryloxypropionic acid.<br>
According to the present invention, in the<br>
production of an acrylic ester using acrylic acid and<br>
an aliphatic or alicyclic alcohol having from 5 to 8<br>
carbon atoms as raw materials and using a strongly<br><br>
acidic cation exchange resin as a catalyst, the yield<br>
of an acrylic ester can be improved without lowering<br>
the quality of a product by the effective separation<br>
of the acrylic ester from high-boiling acid components<br>
influencing the quality of a product and the unit<br>
consumption of raw materials. In the extraction<br>
treatment of high-boiling acid components, process<br>
wastewater generated in a step of producing an acrylic<br>
ester, including reaction generated water, can be used<br>
as extraction water, and therefore, there is no need<br>
to introduce fresh water, from the outside of the system,<br>
leading to an increase in the amount of wastewater.<br>
Further, the application of the extraction treatment<br>
of high-boiling acid components makes it possible to<br>
separate and remove, by an inexpensive method,<br>
high-boiling acid components difficult to be separated,<br>
and to use low-purity acrylic acid containing<br>
relatively great amounts of high-boiling acid<br>
components, as well as makes it easy to carry out the<br>
storage management of acrylic acid as a raw material,<br>
thereby making it possible to broaden the accepted<br>
range of raw material acrylic acid which can be used<br>
in the production of an acrylic ester from acrylic acid<br>
and an aliphatic or alicyclic alcohol having from 5 to<br>
8 carbon atoms.<br><br>
For these reasons, the present invention can<br>
provide a process for producing an acrylic ester with<br>
very excellent economic efficiency.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The process for producing an acrylic ester<br>
according to the present invention (hereinafter<br>
referred to simply as "the production process of the<br>
present invention" in some cases) is a process for<br>
producing an acrylic ester by supplying acrylic acid<br><br>
and an aliphatic or alicyclic alcohol having from 5 to<br>
8 carbon atoms to an esterification reactor to cause<br>
an esterification reaction using a strongly acidic<br>
cation exchange resin as a catalyst in the reactor, the<br>
process comprising supplying an obtained reaction<br>
product to a low-boiling separation column to distill<br>
an alcohol, acrylic acid, and water from the top of the<br>
low-boiling separation column, and separating them<br>
into a water phase and an organic phase containing the<br>
alcohol and acrylic acid, the organic phase being<br>
circulated as a circulated liquid to the reactor,<br>
supplying a crude acrylic ester, which is withdrawn<br>
from the bottom of the low-boiling separation column,<br>
to a rectifying column, taking out a rectified acrylic<br>
ester from the top of the rectifying column, and<br>
supplying a high-boiling substance containing an<br>
acrylic ester, which is withdrawn from the bottom of<br>
the rectifying column, to a high-boiling separation<br>
column and/or a thin-film evaporator to separate it<br>
into an acrylic ester component and a high-boiling<br>
substance, the separated acrylic ester component being<br>
taken out as a distillate and supplied to the<br>
low-boiling separation column for its recovery.<br>
In this case, all or part of the distillate from<br>
the high-boiling separation column and/or the<br><br>
thin-film evaporator may preferably be mixed with water<br>
to extract and remove a high-boiling acid component<br>
contained in the distillate into a water phase, and an<br>
obtained organic phase is supplied to the low-boiling<br>
separation column for its recovery.<br>
In the production process of the present invention,<br>
acrylic acid containing high-boiling acid components<br>
such as maleic acid and β-acryloxypropionic acid, even<br>
if it is, for example, acrylic acid containing from 10<br>
to 5,000 ppm of maleic acid and/or from 10 to 5,000 ppm<br>
of β-acryloxypropionic acid, and even if it may<br>
preferably be acrylic acid containing from 10 to 500<br>
ppm of maleic acid and from 10 to 3,600 ppm of<br>
β-acryloxypropionic acid as shown in Examples<br>
described below, can be used as a raw material.<br>
Incidentally, high-boiling acid components contained<br>
in acrylic acid can be analyzed by, for example, gas<br>
chromatography.<br>
As an aliphatic or alicyclic alcohol having from<br>
5 to 8 carbon atoms (hereinafter referred to simply as<br>
"the alcohol" in some cases), there can be mentioned,<br>
although not particularly limited thereto, so long as<br>
an acrylic ester can be formed using a strongly acidic<br>
cation exchange resin, for example, 2-ethylhexanol and<br>
cyclohexanol. Such an alcohol may be linear or<br><br>
branched. Further, an unreacted alcohol recovered<br>
from the low-boiling separation column after the<br>
esterification reaction is circulated and recycled.<br>
In the production process of the present invention,<br>
a strongly acidic cation exchange resin is used as a<br>
catalyst for esterification reaction. In the case of<br>
a strongly acidic cation exchange resin, a porous or<br>
gel type resin can be used, and a porous type resin may<br>
preferably be used. In particular, when a low-purity<br>
acrylic acid is used, a porous type resin having<br>
excellent resistance to organic contamination may<br>
preferably be used. As a porous type strongly acidic<br>
cation exchange resin, for example, there may<br>
preferably be used those which have a degree of<br>
cross-linking of from 2% to 16%, a porosity of from 0.1<br>
to 1.0 mL/g, and an average pore diameter of from 10<br>
to 60 nm, specific examples of which are C-26C<br>
(available from Duolite International Co.), PK-208,<br>
PK-216, PK-228 (available from Mitsubishi Chemical<br>
Corporation), MSC-1, 88 (available from The Dow<br>
Chemical Company), Amberlyst-16 (available from Rohm<br>
and Haas Company) , SPC-108, and SPC-112 (available from<br>
Bayer AG).<br>
The esterification reaction is carried out by<br>
monitoring the conversion of acrylic acid through<br><br>
analyzing the compositions of an inlet liquid and an<br>
outlet liquid in the reactor, and adjusting the<br>
reaction temperature so that the conversion of acrylic<br>
acid becomes substantially constant. The conversion<br>
of acrylic acid may preferably be within a range of from<br>
-5% to +5%, more preferably from -3% to +3%, based on<br>
the conversion of acrylic acid in the steady state<br>
reached after the start of operation.<br>
The esterification reaction may preferably be<br>
carried out within a range of from 50°C to 100°C, more<br>
preferably from 70°C to 100°C, although depending on<br>
the intended esterification reaction. Further, the<br>
esterification reaction is carried out in a liquid<br>
phase, and the type of reaction may be on a fluid or<br>
fixed bed.<br>
In the esterification reaction, a polymerization<br>
inhibitor can be used as applied in ordinary cases.<br>
Examples of the polymerization inhibitor may include<br>
hydroquinone, methoxyhydroquinone, phenothiazine,<br>
hydroxylamine, and phenylenediamine. Incidentally,<br>
the effect of a polymerization inhibitor can further<br>
be enhanced when the esterification reaction is carried<br>
out in the presence of molecular oxygen.<br>
The thus obtained esterification reaction product<br>
is supplied to a low-boiling column for its<br><br>
distillation, and substantially all the amount of<br>
high-boiling substance composed mainly of a generated<br>
acrylic ester is withdrawn from the bottom of the<br>
low-boiling separation column and supplied to a<br>
rectifying column for its distillation, thereby<br>
obtaining a product acrylic ester as a distillate from<br>
the top of the rectifying column.<br>
On the other hand, from the top of the low-boiling<br>
separation column, low-boiling components composed<br>
mainly of an unreacted alcohol, unreacted acrylic acid,<br>
and generated water are distilled and condensed to<br>
separate them into a water phase and an organic phase<br>
composed mainly of an alcohol and acrylic acid. The<br>
organic phase is circulated as a circulated liquid to<br>
the reactor. On the other hand, the water phase may<br>
be discarded as wastewater or may be recycled as process<br>
wastewater.<br>
To allow the esterification reaction to proceed<br>
smoothly, it is advantageous to decrease the amounts<br>
of acrylic ester and water and to increase the amounts<br>
of alcohol and acrylic acid in the composition of a<br>
circulated liquid. Therefore, as for the circulated<br>
liquid, although depending on the intended acrylic<br>
ester and reaction conditions, the total amount of<br>
alcohol and acrylic acid may preferably be 50% by mass<br><br>
or higher, more preferably 60% by mass or higher, and<br>
the concentration of water may preferably be 5% by mass<br>
or lower, more preferably 2% by mass or lower. Further,<br>
the amount of circulated liquid to be circulated to the<br>
reactor is not preferred when it is too high or too low<br>
because of an increase in the amount of catalyst<br>
necessary for the esterification reaction. The amount<br>
of circulated liquid may suitably be from 1 to 5 times<br>
the total amount of alcohol and acrylic acid newly<br>
supplied.<br>
A polymerization inhibitor can also be used in the<br>
low-boiling separation column. Examples of the<br>
polymerization inhibitor may include the same as<br>
exemplified regarding the esterification reaction.<br>
In the same manner as described above, the effect of<br>
a polymerization inhibitor can be enhanced when the<br>
operation of the low-boiling separation column is<br>
carried out in the presence of molecular oxygen.<br>
A high-boiling substance containing an acrylic<br>
ester is withdrawn from the bottom of the rectifying<br>
column and supplied to a high-boiling separation column,<br>
and an acrylic ester component is recovered from the<br>
top of the high-boiling separation column. The<br>
high-boiling substance withdrawn from the bottom of the<br>
high-boiling separation column may be discharged as<br><br>
waste oil, or may be further introduced into a thin-film<br>
evaporator to recover an acrylic ester, after which it<br>
may be discharged as waste oil. On the other hand, an<br>
acrylic ester in the distillate from the high-boiling<br>
separation column and/or the thin-film evaporator is<br>
supplied to the low-boiling separation column for its<br>
recovery.<br>
All or part of the distillate from the<br>
high-boiling separation column and/or the thin-film<br>
evaporator is mixed with water to extract and remove<br>
high-boiling acid components such as maleic acid and<br>
β-acryloxypropionic acid contained together with an<br>
acrylic ester in the distillate into a water phase, and<br>
the organic phase is supplied to the low-boiling<br>
separation column to recover the acrylic ester. At<br>
this time, the distillate from the high-boiling<br>
separation column may be supplied without any treatment<br>
to the low-boiling separation column, and all or part<br>
of the distillate from the thin-film evaporator may be<br>
mixed with water to carry out an extraction treatment.<br>
In this way, the extraction treatment of high-boiling<br>
acid components can reduce the amount of waste oil<br>
without increasing the amount of acid components<br>
contained in the product acrylic ester. Further, it<br>
can expand the accepted range of raw material acrylic<br><br>
acid. In this case, low-purity acrylic acid containing<br>
relatively great amounts of high-boiling acid<br>
components, for example, even acrylic acid containing<br>
from 10 to 5,000 ppm of maleic acid and/or from 10 to<br>
5,000 ppm of β-acryloxypropionic acid, can be used as<br>
a raw material, and as shown in the following Examples,<br>
acrylic acid containing from 10 to 500 ppm of maleic<br>
acid and from 10 to 3,600 ppm of β-acryloxypropionic<br>
acid can preferably be used as a raw material.<br>
Incidentally, as water to be mixed with all or part<br>
of the distillate, a process wastewater generated in<br>
a step of producing an acrylic ester may preferably be<br>
used. Examples of the process wastewater may include<br>
reaction water generated in the esterification<br>
reaction and steam drain exhausted in the case of using<br>
a steam ejector to reduce pressure in a pressure<br>
reduction step included in a step of producing an<br>
acrylic ester. In this way, the cost for wastewater<br>
treatment is not increased because of no increase in<br>
the amount of wastewater by making use of wastewater<br>
discharged from a step of producing an acrylic ester<br>
without introducing fresh water from outside the<br>
system.<br>
Further, the ratio of water to be used to extract<br>
and remove the high-boiling acid components relative<br><br>
to the distillate from the high-boiling separation<br>
column and/or the thin-film evaporator may preferably<br>
be within a range of from 0.5 to 2.0, more preferably<br>
from 0.8 to 1.5, by mass ratio.<br>
The production process of the present invention<br>
will be described below in more detail by reference to<br>
accompanying FIGs. 1 and 2. The production process of the<br>
present invention comprises supplying a high-boiling<br>
substance containing an acrylic ester, which is withdrawn<br>
from the bottom of a rectifying column, to a high-boiling<br>
separation column and/or a thin-film evaporator to<br>
separate it into an acrylic ester component and a<br>
high-boiling substance, the separated acrylic ester<br>
component being taken out as a distillate and supplied<br>
to a low-boiling separation column for its recovery.<br>
At this time, all or part of the distillate from the<br>
high-boiling separation column and/or the thin-film<br>
evaporator is mixed with water to extract and remove<br>
high-boiling impurities in the distillate into a water<br>
phase, and the obtained organic phase is supplied to<br>
the low-boiling separation column for its recovery.<br>
Therefore, the production process of the present<br>
invention is not limited to the production processes<br>
shown in FIGs. 1 and 2, and can be carried out by adding<br>
appropriate modifications and/or changes to these<br><br>
production processes unless such modifications and/or<br>
changes depart from the purport of the present<br>
invention.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram showing one example<br>
of the preferred production process to carry out the<br>
production process of the present invention. This<br>
production process is characterized in that<br>
high-boiling acid components are decreased from the<br>
bottom liquid of a rectifying column 600 using a<br>
high-boiling separation column 700 and a thin-film<br>
evaporator 800 in a portion designated as "A", and then<br>
all or part of the distillate containing an acrylic<br>
ester separated and recovered is circulated to a<br>
low-boiling separation column 500.<br>
Acrylic acid is supplied through a line 1 to an<br>
esterification reactor 100 filled with a strongly<br>
acidic cation exchange resin. An alcohol is also<br>
supplied through a line 2 and a distillation column 200<br>
to the reactor 100. An alcohol and reaction water are<br>
distilled out and introduced through a line 4 into the<br>
decanter 300. In the decanter 300, a water phase and<br>
an organic phase composed mainly of an alcohol are<br>
separated. Then, part of the organic phase is supplied<br>
through a line 5 to the esterif icat ion reactor 100, and<br>
the residue of the organic phase is sent through a line<br><br>
6	as waste oil to a waste-oil treatment step. On the<br>
other hand, the water phase is stored through a line<br>
7	in a process wastewater tank 400, and sent through<br>
a line 8 as wastewater to an alcohol recovery step or<br>
a wastewater treatment step.<br>
An esterification product containing a generated<br>
ester, unreacted acrylic acid, an unreacted alcohol,<br>
and generated water is supplied through a line 9 from<br>
the reactor 100 to the low-boiling separation column<br>
500 for its distillation. The bottom liquid of the<br>
low-boiling separation column 500 contains<br>
substantially all the amount of acrylic ester, and is<br>
supplied through a line 10 to the rectifying column 600.<br>
The top liquid of the low-boiling separation column 500<br>
contains unreacted acrylic acid, an unreacted alcohol,<br>
and generated water, and discharged through a line 11<br>
to separate into a water phase and an organic phase<br>
composed mainly of acrylic acid and an alcohol. Then,<br>
part of the organic phase is circulated as a circulated<br>
liquid through a line 12 to the esterification reactor<br>
100, and the residue of the organic phase is circulated<br>
as reflux through a line 13 to the low-boiling<br>
separation column 500. On the other hand, the water<br>
phase is sent through a line not shown in the figure<br>
as wastewater to an alcohol recovery step or a<br><br>
wastewater treatment step.<br>
The acrylic ester supplied to the rectifying<br>
column 600, after rectified, is discharged from the top<br>
of the rectifying column 600 through a line 14; part<br>
thereof becomes a finished product through a line 15,<br>
and the residual part is circulated as reflux through<br>
a line 16 to the rectifying column 600. The bottom<br>
liquid of the rectifying column is a high-boiling<br>
substance containing high-boiling acid components such<br>
as maleic acid and β-acryloxypropionic acid together<br>
with a small amount of acrylic ester, and is supplied<br>
through a line 17 to the high-boiling separation column<br>
700.<br>
The top liquid of the high-boiling separation<br>
column 700 (referred to as "distillate" in some cases)<br>
contains the acrylic ester separated and recovered, and<br>
all or part of the top liquid is circulated through a<br>
line 18 and the line 9 to the low-boiling separation<br>
column 500. The high-boiling substance containing<br>
high-boiling acid components such as maleic acid and<br>
β-acryloxypropionic acid is sent from the bottom of the<br>
thin-film evaporator 800 through a line 21 to a<br>
waste-oil treatment step.<br>
In the production process shown in FIG. 1, the<br>
high-boiling separation column 700 and the thin-film<br><br>
evaporator 800 are used to separate and recover the<br>
acrylic ester contained in the bottom liquid of the<br>
rectifying column 600; however, it is not necessary to<br>
use both of them, and for example, it is possible that,<br>
using only the high-boiling separation column 700, the<br>
top liquid of the high-boiling separation column 700,<br>
containing the acrylic ester separated and recovered,<br>
is circulated to the low-boiling separation column 500,<br>
and the bottom liquid of the high-boiling separation<br>
column 700, containing high-boiling acid components<br>
such as maleic acid and β-acryloxypropionic acid, is<br>
sent as waste oil to a waste-oil treatment step; or using<br>
only the thin-film evaporator 800, a distillate<br>
containing the acrylic ester separated and recovered<br>
is withdrawn from the top of the thin-film evaporator<br>
800 and circulated to the low-boiling separation column<br>
500, and a residual liquid containing high-boiling acid<br>
components such as maleic acid and [3-acryloxypropionic<br>
acid is discharged from the bottom of the thin-film<br>
evaporator 800 and sent as waste oil to a waste-oil<br>
treatment step.<br>
In such a production of an acrylic ester,<br>
esterification reaction is carried out so that the<br>
conversion of acrylic acid is always kept constant, and<br>
therefore, the composition of an esterification<br><br>
product is stable and the operation conditions of the<br>
low-boiling separation column 500 are also kept stably.<br>
That is, the operation temperature of the low-boiling<br>
separation column 500 is constant, and the composition<br>
and amount of the organic phase to be circulated as a<br>
circulated liquid to the esterification reactor 100 are<br>
both constant.<br>
FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram showing another<br>
example of the preferred production process to carry<br>
out the production process of the present invention.<br>
This production process is characterized in that a<br>
high-boiling acid substance containing an acrylic<br>
ester, which is withdrawn from the bottom of the<br>
rectifying column 600, is supplied to a high-boiling<br>
separation column 700 and a thin-film evaporator 800<br>
in a portion designated as "A" to separate it into an<br>
acrylic ester component and a high-boiling substance,<br>
the separated acrylic ester component being taken out<br>
as a distillate, and all or part of the distillate is<br>
mixed with water in a portion designated as "B" to<br>
extract and remove high-boiling acid components in the<br>
distillate into a water phase, the obtained organic<br>
phase being supplied to the low-boiling separation<br>
column 500 for its recovery. Further, this production<br>
process is the same as the production process shown in<br><br>
FIG. 1 up to the stage of reducing high-boiling acid<br>
components from the bottom liquid of the rectifying<br>
column 600 using the high-boiling separation column 700<br>
and the thin-film evaporator 800, that is, except for<br>
a portion designated as "B". Therefore, there will be<br>
described herein a step of extracting and removing<br>
high-boiling acid components contained in the top<br>
liquid of the high-boiling separation column 700<br>
(referred to as "water extraction step" in some times).<br>
In FIG. 2, the same equipments as in FIG. 1 are<br>
designated by the same numbers.<br>
All or part of the top liquid of the high-boiling<br>
separation column 700 is supplied through a line 22 and<br>
a line 2 3 to an extraction tank 900. At this time, it<br>
is supplied to the extraction tank 900 after being mixed<br>
in the line 23 with wastewater from the process<br>
wastewater tank 400. In the extraction tank 900,<br>
high-boiling acid components such as maleic acid and<br>
β-acryloxypropionic acid are extracted and removed<br>
into a water phase. Then, an organic phase containing<br>
an acrylic ester is circulated through the line 24 and<br>
the line 9 to the low-boiling separation column 500.<br>
On the other hand, the water phase containing<br>
high-boiling acid components such as maleic acid and<br>
β-acryloxypr'opionic acid is sent through a line 25 as<br><br>
wastewater to a wastewater treatment step. As water<br>
to be used to extract and remove high-boiling acid<br>
components, any water discharged in the production<br>
process may be used, although it is not particularly<br>
limited, and process water generated in the production<br>
process of an acrylic ester, including reaction water,<br>
may preferably be used.<br>
In the production process shown in FIG. 2, the step<br>
of extracting, with water, all or part of the top liquid<br>
of the high-boiling separation column 700 is carried<br>
out in a portion designated as NXB"; however, all or part<br>
of the top liquid of the high-boiling separation column<br>
700 may be circulated without any treatment to the<br>
low-boiling separation column 500, and only for the<br>
distillate from the thin-film evaporator 800, the step<br>
of extracting, with water, all or part of the distillate<br>
may be carried out in a portion designated as "B" .<br>
In FIGs. 1 and 2, the mixing ratio of wastewater<br>
from the process wastewater tank 400 to be used to<br>
extract and remove high-boiling acid components,<br>
relative to the distillate from the high-boiling<br>
separation column 700 or the thin-film evaporator 800,<br>
i.e., the distillate containing an acrylic ester<br>
separated and recovered, may preferably be within a<br>
range of from 0.5 to 2.0, more preferably from 0.8 to<br><br>
1.5, by mass ratio. When the mixing ratio is within<br>
this range, high-boiling acid components can<br>
efficiently be extracted and removed into a water phase,<br>
and an acrylic ester from which high-boiling acid<br>
components have sufficiently been removed can be<br>
circulated to the low-boiling separation column 500.<br>

of waste oil was discharged from the bottom of the<br>
thin-film evaporator 800, and 90 kg/h of the distillate<br>
from the high-boiling separation column 700 was<br>
circulated to the low-boiling separation column 500.<br>

acrylic ester were in an amount of from 220 to 280 ppm<br><br>
(in terms of acrylic acid). The results are shown in<br>
Table 1.<br>&gt;<br>
To the esterification reactor 100 shown in FIG.<br>

100 to 500 pm of maleic acid and from 500 to 3,600 ppm<br>
of β-acryloxypropionic acid, 740 kg/h of 2-ethyl-<br>

and after 230 days of operation, the reaction was<br>

conversion of acrylic acid of 50%, thereby giving a<br>
product acrylic ester at a yield of 997 kg/h from the<br>
top of the rectifying column 600. At this time, 18 kg/h<br>
of waste oil was discharged from the bottom of the<br>
thin-film evaporator 800, and 125 kg/h of the<br>
distillate from the high-boiling separation column 700<br>
and 140 kg/h of wastewater from the process wastewater<br>
tank 400 were mixed and supplied to the extraction tank<br>
900 shown in FIG. 2. The water phase was removed as<br>
wastewater, and the organic phase containing an acrylic<br>
ester was circulated to the low-boiling separation<br>
column 500. The acid components contained in the<br>
obtained product acrylic ester were in an amount of from<br>
35 to 50 ppm (in terms of acrylic acid). The results<br>
are shown in Table 1.<br><br>&gt;<br>
To the esterification reactor 100 shown in FIG.<br>
3 were supplied 400 kg/h of acrylic acid containing from<br>
100 to 500 ppm of maleic acid and from 500 to 3,600 ppm<br>
of β-acryloxypropionic acid, 740 kg/h of 2-ethyl-<br>
hexanol, and 1,590 kg/h of a recovered alcohol liquid,<br>
and after 230 days of operation, the reaction was<br>

conversion of acrylic acid of 50%, thereby giving a<br>
product acrylic ester at a yield of 845 kg/h from the<br>
top of the rectifying column 600. At this time, 170<br>
kg/h of waste oil was discharged from the bottom of the<br>
rectifying column 600. The acid components contained<br>
in the obtained product acrylic ester were in an amount<br>
of from 150 to 170 ppm (in terms of acrylic acid) . The<br>
results are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
As can be seen from Table 1, in Examples 1 and 2,<br>
the yield of a product acrylic ester was able to be kept<br>
high in such a manner that when an acrylic ester was<br>
produced using the production process shown in FIG. 1,<br>
a high-boiling substance containing an acrylic ester,<br>
which was withdrawn from the bottom of a rectifying<br>
column, was supplied to a high-boiling separation<br>
column and/or a thin-film evaporator to separate it<br>
into an acrylic ester component and a high-boiling<br>
substance, and the separated acrylic ester component<br>
was taken out as a distillate and supplied to a<br>
low-boiling separation column for its recovery,<br>
thereby decreasing the loss of an acrylic ester from<br>
waste oil. At this time, no problem was caused on the<br>
quality of a product.<br>
Further, in Examples 3 and 4, when an acrylic ester<br>
was produced using the production process shown in FIG.<br>
2, a high-boiling substance containing an acrylic ester,<br>
which was withdrawn from the bottom of a rectifying<br>
column, was supplied to a high-boiling separation<br>
column and/or a thin-film evaporator to separate it<br>
into an acrylic ester component and a high-boiling<br>
product, and the separated acrylic ester component was<br>
taken out as a distillate, all or part of which was mixed<br>
with water to extract and remove high-boiling acid<br><br>
components such as maleic acid and β-acryloxypropionic<br>
acid contained together with an acrylic ester in the<br>
distillate into a water phase, the water phase being<br>
discharged as wastewater, and the organic phase being<br>
supplied to a low-boiling separation column to recover<br>
an acrylic ester. In Examples 3 and 4 including a step<br>
of water extraction, it became possible to further<br>
decrease the loss of an acrylic ester from waste oil<br>
and improve the yield of a product acrylic ester,<br>
compared with those of Examples 1 and 2, without<br>
deteriorating the quality of a product. In the<br>
production of an acrylic ester controlling the constant<br>
conversion of acrylic acid, the reaction temperature<br>
is raised with extending the duration of using a<br>
strongly acidic cation exchange resin accordingly, in<br>
which case the amount of high-boiling acid components<br>
such as β-acryloxypropionic acid influencing the<br>
quality of a product increases, and therefore, it<br>
becomes necessary to make a response by increasing the<br>
amount of waste oil to maintain the quality of a product<br>
acrylic ester. However, according to the conditions<br>
of Example 4 into which a step of water extraction was<br>
introduced, the stable quality of a product acrylic<br>
ester and the stable yield of a product were able to<br>
be obtained without remarkably increasing the amount<br><br>
of waste oil from the early period of reaction in Example<br>
3.	The yield of a product under conditions of a high<br>
reaction temperature was quite noticeable as compared<br>
with Example 2 and Comparative Example 2.<br>
In contrast, in Comparative Examples 1 and 2, when<br>
an acrylic ester was produced using the production<br>
process shown in FIG. 3, the bottom liquid of a<br>
rectifying column was subjected as waste oil without<br>
any treatment to a step of waste treatment, and<br>
therefore, although the amount of high-boiling acid<br>
components contained in the product acrylic ester<br>
obtained as part of the top liquid of the rectifying<br>
column did not change as compared with Examples 1 to<br>
4,	the yield of a product acrylic ester was remarkably<br>
decreased as compared with Examples 1 to 4, and the<br>
amount of waste oil was remarkably increased as<br>
compared with Examples 1 to 4 .<br>
From these facts, it can be understood that the<br>
loss of an acrylic ester from waste oil can be decreased<br>
and the yield of a product acrylic ester can be increased,<br>
without deteriorating the quality of a product acrylic<br>
ester, by supplying the bottom liquid of a rectifying<br>
column to a high-boiling separation column and/or a<br>
thin-film evaporator, separating and taking out, as a<br>
distillate, an acrylic ester remaining in the bottom<br><br>
liquid of the rectifying column from a high-boiling<br>
substance, and supplying the distillate to a<br>
low-boiling separation column for its recovery; and<br>
further, that a decrease in the loss of an acrylic ester<br>
from waste oil can more stably be achieved to improve<br>
production efficiency, by introducing a step of water<br>
extraction in which all or part of the distillate from<br>
the high-boiling separation column and/or the<br>
thin-film evaporator is mixed with water generated in<br>
the production process to extract and remove<br>
high-boiling acid components into a water phase, which<br>
is discharged as wastewater, and a organic phase is<br>
supplied to the low-boiling separation column to<br>
recover an acrylic ester.<br>
Further, in Example 5, an acrylic ester was<br>
produced in almost the same manner as described in<br>
Examples 1 and 2 using the production process shown in<br>
FIG. 1, except that a low-purity acrylic acid was used<br>
as a raw material. Although the amount of high-boiling<br>
acid components contained in the product acrylic ester<br>
was great, in spite of using a low-purity acrylic acid<br>
as a raw material, the yield of a product acrylic ester<br>
and the amount of waste oil were at about the same level<br>
as those in Examples 1 and 2.<br>
Further, in Example 6, an acrylic ester was<br><br>
produced in almost the same manner as described in<br>
Examples 3 and 4 using the production process shown in<br>
FIG. 2, except that a low-purity acrylic acid was used<br>
as a raw material. In spite of using a low-purity<br>
acrylic acid as a raw material, the yield of a product<br>
acrylic ester was increased as compared with Example<br>
5, and the amount of waste oil was remarkably decreased<br>
as compared with Example 5, both of which were by no<br>
means inferior to Examples 3 and 4 using a relatively<br>
high-purity acrylic acid as a raw material.<br>
In contrast, in Comparative Example 3, an acrylic<br>
ester was produced in almost the same manner as<br>
described in Comparative Examples 1 and 2 using the<br>
production process shown in FIG. 3, except that a<br>
low-purity acrylic acid was used as a raw material. The<br>
yield of a product acrylic ester was remarkably<br>
decreased as compared with Examples 5 and 6, and<br>
although the amount of high-boiling acid components<br>
contained in the product acrylic ester was smaller than<br>
that in Example 5, it was very great as compared with<br>
Example 6, and the amount of waste oil was remarkably<br>
increased as compared with Examples 5 and 6.<br>
From these facts, it can be understood that the<br>
loss of an acrylic ester form waste oil can be suppressed<br>
on a low level, without deteriorating the quality of<br><br>
a product acrylic ester, to improve production<br>
efficiency and achieve the stable production, even when<br>
low-purity acrylic acid containing great amounts of<br>
high boiling acid components such as maleic acid and<br>
β-acryloxypropionic acid is used as a raw material, or<br>
even when relatively high-purity acrylic acid is used<br>
as a raw material, by introducing a step of water<br>
extraction in which the bottom liquid of a rectifying<br>
column is supplied to a high-boiling separation column<br>
and/or a thin-film evaporator, an acrylic ester<br>
remaining in the bottom liquid of the rectifying column<br>
is taken out as a distillate through separating a<br>
high-boiling substance, all or part of the distillate<br>
is mixed with water generated in the production process<br>
to extract and remove high-boiling acid components into<br>
a water phase, which is discharged as wastewater, and<br>
an organic phase is supplied to a low-boiling<br>
separation column to recover an acrylic ester.<br>
As described above, the production process of the<br>
present invention makes it possible to stably achieve<br>
a large reduction in the production cost of an acrylic<br>
ester.<br>
The present invention provides a process for<br>
producing an acrylic ester using acrylic acid<br>
containing high-boiling acid components, such as<br><br>
maleic acid and β-acryloxypropionic acid, influencing<br>
the loss in quality of an acrylic ester and the unit<br>
consumption of raw materials, and an aliphatic or<br>
alicyclic alcohol having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms, as<br>
raw materials, and a strongly acidic cation exchange<br>
resin as a catalyst, which process is excellent from<br>
an economical point of view because it can eliminate<br>
the conventional problems to maintain the stable<br>
quality and the low unit consumption of raw materials,<br>
and which process makes a great contribution to the<br>
filed of acrylic ester production.<br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1. A process for producing an acrylic ester by supplying<br>
acrylic acid and an aliphatic or alicyclic alcohol having<br>
from 5 to 8 carbon atoms to an esterif ication reactor to<br>

acid containing high-boiling acid components<br>
influencing the loss in quality and the unit<br>
consumption of raw materials, and an aliphatic or<br>
alicyclic alcohol having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms, as<br>
raw materials, and using a strongly acidic cation<br>
exchange resin as a catalyst. In such a process for<br>
producing an acrylic ester, a crude acrylic ester<br>
withdrawn from the bottom of a low-boiling separation<br>
column is supplied to a rectifying column, a rectified<br>
acrylic ester is taken out from the top of the rectifying<br>
column, while a high-boiling substance containing an<br>
acrylic ester, which is withdrawn from the bottom of<br>
the rectifying column, is supplied to a high-boiling<br>
separation column and/or a thin-film evaporator to<br>
separate it into an acrylic ester component and a<br>
high-boiling substance, and the separated acrylic<br>
ester component is taken out as a distillate and<br>
supplied to the low-boiling separation column for its<br><br>
recovery.</td>
