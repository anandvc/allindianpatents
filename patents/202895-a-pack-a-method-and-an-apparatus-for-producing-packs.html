PACKAGE, PARTICULARLY A CIGARETTE PACKAGE, AND METHOD AND DEVICE FOR THE PRODUCTION THEREOF<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a pack, in particular cigarette pack, having a large-surface-area front side and a corresponding rear side and also having an outer wrapper made of film which has a tear-open strip running all the way round, a separate blank being positioned, as a printing carrier, in particular a coupon, between the outer wrapper and the (cigarette) pack. The invention also relates to a method of producing such packs and to an apparatus.<br>
There are increasing requirements, in the fabrication of cigarette packs, for sheet-like inserts with printed information or advertising material to be fitted on the pack. Various proposals are known for adding printing carriers made of thin paper or the like to the cigarette pack, to be precise even in the region between the conventional outer wrapper made of film and the pack itself.<br>
The object of the invention is to propose a pack in the case of which the insert, namely the separate blank, is fitted straightforwardly in packaging terms and is presented in a user-friendly manner when the pack is opened for the first time, with the result that the advertising or information reaches the consumer.<br>
In order to achieve this object, the pack according to the invention is characterized by the following features:<br>
a)  the blank or printing carrier is fitted in the region between one of the large-surface-area pack<br><br>
side, on the one hand, and the outer f wrapper, on the other hand,<br>
b)  the blank or printing carrier is connected to the outer wrapper by adhesive bonding.<br>
Positioning the printing carrier in particular on the large-surf ace-area rear side of the (cigarette) pack makes available a corresponding surface area for imparting information even with the pack closed, because the printing carrier can cover the entire side or rear side of the pack. When the pack is opened for the first time, namely when the wrapper is removed, the fact that the printing carrier is connected to the wrapper additionally draws the consumer's attention thereto.<br>
A cigarette pack according to the invention in the case of which the printing carrier is fitted on the rear side of the pack and is connected to a top outer-wrapper part which can be detached by tear-open strips - a film cap - is particularly advantageous. When this pack is customarily opened for the first time, the film cap is detached from the outer wrapper. In this case, the printing carrier, which is connected to said film cap, is drawn out of the position within the pack and presented to the consumer.<br>
The amount of printing surface area available may be increased by a multi-layered, in particular concertina like design of the printing carrier. Moreover, it is a special feature that the printing carrier is connected to the pack or the rear side thereof, to be precise by releasable adhesive bonding. A possible connecting means is a "stick/no stick" type of adhesive, that is to say an adhesive which automatically loses its effect after a certain period of time.<br><br>
During production of a pack within the context of the invention, the procedure is such that a film web for producing the outer wrapper is provided with areas of glue in a precisely positioned manner, in the region of a film cap which is to be produced, for the attachment of the printing carrier. Spots of glue are preferably applied to the film web in pairs at appropriate intervals from one another, a glue in the form of both a hot-melt and a long-term adhesive being advantageous.<br>
Further details regarding the configuration and production of the packs according to the invention are explained in more detail hereinbelow with reference to the drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1  shows a perspective view of a cigarette pack,<br>
Figure 2 shows, likewise in a perspective illustration, the pack according to Figure 1 during a production phase,<br>
Figure 3 shows the pack according to Figure 2 without a printing carrier,<br>
Figure 4 shows a side view of the pack according to Figure 1,<br>
Figure 5 shows an illustration corresponding to Figure 4 of a different exemplary embodiment of the pack,<br>
Figure 6 shows a perspective illustration of the pack according to Figure 1 during the opening process,<br>
Figure 7  shows,    likewise    in    a    perspective<br>
illustration, the pack according to Figure 5 during the opening process,<br><br>
Figure 8  shows a schematic side view of an apparatus<br>
for producing packs with printing carriers, and<br>
Figure 9  shows a portion of a film web for an outer wrapper of a pack.<br>
The drawings concern the configuration and production of cigarette packs, that is to say of cuboidal pack, which have at least two mutually opposite (large) surfaces. This applies to the packs 10 of the hinge-lid-box type, which are illustrated as the preferred example. This type of pack is constructed from a (bottom) box part 11 and a lid 12. The two parts are connected to one another such that they can be pivoted in the region of a transversely directed linear articulation 14 in the region of a large-surface-area rear side 13 of the pack 10. Accordingly, the rear side 13 of the pack 10 is in one piece throughout.<br>
A correspondingly large-surface-area front side 15 is formed opposite. Furthermore, the pack 10 is bounded by narrow, upright side surfaces 16 and by a base surface 17 and end surface 18.<br>
The resulting pack 10 is fully enclosed by an outer wrapper 19. The latter consists of a thin, transparent or clear film. The outer wrapper 19 is removed, at least in part, when the pack 10 is opened for the first time. For this purpose, connected to the outer wrapper 19, in a top region directed toward the end surface 18, is a tear-open strip 20 running all the way round. A free, outer end of the tear-open strip 20 serves as a grip end 21. For the purpose of opening the outer wrapper 19, the latter is severed with the aid of the tear-open strip 20 such that a top sub-region of the outer wrapper 19 is completely detached from a bottom part. The top part of the outer wrapper, a film cap 22, is removed.<br><br>
The pack 10 is provided with a separate blank 23. The latter consists of thin material, in particular paper. The blank 23 serves as a printing carrier, that is to say for receiving printed information and/or decoration, for example advertising and factual information, but also details for participation in prize draws.<br>
The blank 23 is positioned in the region between the pack 10 and the outer wrapper 19, to be precise on one of the large pack surfaces. It is particularly-favorable for the blank 23 to be arranged in the region of the large-surface-area rear side 13, since the latter is designed in one piece throughout. The blank 23 is dimensioned such that it extends more or less over the entire surface of the rear side 13. The outside of the blank 23 is clearly visible through the outer wrapper 19, with the result that appropriate printing and/or information may be provided in this region.<br>
The blank 23 is dimensioned and positioned such that a sub-region of the same is located in that part which can be removed when the outer wrapper 19 is opened, that is to say in the region of the film cap 22. The blank 23 is connected to the outer wrapper 19 such that the blank 23 is removed with this outer wrapper 19.<br>
A special feature is the connection of the blank 23 to the detachable film cap 22 in the region of a cap rear wall 24. When the outer wrapper 19 is opened, the connection causes the blank 23 to be drawn out of position along with the film cap 22, to be precise without being destroyed or impaired in any other way (Figure 6).<br>
The blank 23 is connected to the outer wrapper 19 by adhesive bonding. It is favorable for the blank 23 to<br><br>
be fastened on the cap rear wall 24 by a plurality of, in particular two, spots of glue 25, 26. These are spaced apart from one another adjacent to the end boundary of the blank 23, namely virtually at the top corners of the blank 23. The spots of glue 25, 2 6 may comprise a long-lasting adhesive, to be precise also in hot-melt form.<br>
Provision is also made for the blank 23 to be connected to the pack 10 in a region which is located at the bottom or remote from the spots of glue 25, 26, namely connected to the rear side 13 of the pack in the region of the box part 11. This connection has to be easily releasable in order that the blank 23 can easily be withdrawn from the position on the rear side 13 when the film cap 22 is removed. Provided for this purpose is a single, central blob of glue 27, which connects the blank 23 to the rear side 13. This connection has, in particular, the purpose of ensuring that the blank 23 is positioned precisely on the pack 10 during the production process and thereafter, at any rate before the pack is opened for the first time. The blob of glue 27 may advantageously consist of the "stick/no stick" type of glue, that is to say glue with a decreasing adhesive action.<br>
In order to increase the useful surface area, the blank 23 may be of multi-layered design. According to Figure 5, the blank 23 is folded in a concertina-like manner as an elongate strip, for example to the width of the rear side 13. An inner leg 28 butts against the rear side 13 and has a free end directed downward. An outer leg 29 is directed toward the outer wrapper 19 and has a free end oriented upward. The inner leg 28 is connected (in a releasable manner) to the pack 10 in the bottom region, via the blob of glue 27, and the outer leg 29 is connected to the outer wrapper 19 or the film cap 22 via preferably two spots of glue 25, 26. In the case of the concertina-like arrangement of<br><br>
the blank 23, folding lines are directed transversely at the top and bottom regions of the rear side 13.<br>
When the pack 10 is opened for the first time by virtue of the film cap 22 being lifted off, the latter causes the folded blank 23 first of all to be unfolded and then to be drawn out of the position on the rear side 13 (Figure 7) . Accordingly, the blank 23 is not just drawn out of the position between the outer wrapper 19 and the pack 10, but is also unfolded in the process.<br>
A further special feature is the production of packs 10 of the type described. In the case of the apparatus shown schematically in Figure 4, a film web 30 is withdrawn from a reel 31 and fed to a blank subassembly 32. In the region of the latter, blanks for the outer wrapper 19 are severed in the region of a vertical plane and transferred to packs 10, which can be fed along a horizontal pack path 33, likewise to the blank subassembly 32.<br>
In the region of a glue station 34, the film web 30 is provided with glue, preferably with the spots of glue 25, 26, for the purpose of fixing the blank 23. A glue subassembly 35 is provided for this purpose, and preferably applies the spots of glue by glue nozzles.<br>
The tear-open strip 20 is then applied to the film web, to be precise as a strip web 36, which is likewise withdrawn from a reel 37. The blank for the outer wrapper 19, this blank being produced in the blank subassembly 32, thus already has the tear-open strip 2 0 and spots of glue 25, 26. As can be seen from Figure 9, the latter are applied in a precisely positioned manner to the film web 30 as pairs of spots of glue 25, 26, corresponding to the position within the blank which is to be produced, to be precise alongside the tear-open strip 20 or the strip web 36.<br><br>
The packs 10, which are fed from a corresponding packer, are glued, namely provided with the blob of glue 27, on the upwardly oriented rear side 13 of the pack 10, in the region of the pack path 3 3, by a glue subassembly 38. The glue subassembly 3 8 has a glue nozzle which discharges an appropriate portion of glue from above.<br>
Following the glue subassembly 38, a subassembly for applying the blanks 23 to the packs 10, that is to say a blank supplier 39, is positioned above the pack path 33. Said blank supplier transfers a blank 23 of the configuration according to Figure 4 or 5, with precise relative positioning in each case, onto the rear side of the pack 10, the blank 23 being fixed by the blob of glue 27. Thereafter, in the region of the blank station 32, the blank of the outer wrapper 19 is folded in the customary manner around the pack 10, which has been prepared in respect of the blank 23.<br>
The measures described can also be used analogously for cigarette packs of the soft-carton type or capped-box type. With corresponding fabrication, the blank 23 may alternatively be connected to the outer wrapper 19 and/or the pack 10 by thermal sealing.<br><br>
