				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a tray container/package and in particular to a tray container/package obtained of single piece package material preferably paper board with or without lamination on the surface to obtain complete leak proof tray container/package. The tray container/package of the invention involves selective folding of the single piece package material to favour obtaining of the container tray/package, which would be free of rough edges or cuts thereby favouring proper containing of contents therein. The container tray/package is thus simple to obtain and manufacture and can provide for a totally leak proof and hygienic container tray/package, which would also be cost effective and user friendly.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is well known to provide containing trays or packages for containing/storing variety of products depending upon its characteristics and intended purpose of its containment in the tray container/package. Accordingly, while products which can be easily handled and do not require careful provision for packaging can have diverse possible packaging for storing of the same without concerns of affecting its quality and character during storage, however, there are variety of other products such as those related to the food industry, in particular, sweet meat and the like, which due to its soft and delicate nature as well as possible liquid content essentially require good quality, seepage proof and smooth packaging, which would not effect the purity and maintain the soft and delicate nature of the products and also would not lead to damage of the package itself . Moreover, maintaining desired hygienic characteristic of the packaging so as not to affect the food value and its contamination free characteristic, packaging for food products such as sweet meat and like call for very special and selective attention for selecting the package material and developing of packaging construction to suit such basic and inherent demands of packaging of such delicate products.<br>
Importantly, it is experience that since sweet meat products involve liquid contents such as syrups, edible oil, ghee etc., it is commonly found that as and when packaging of such sweet meats and allied products are done in conventional paper packages, the package containing the sweet meat assumes a very poor and unhygienic outer appearance due to absorption of liquid contents of the sweet<br>
meats/food leading to soiling of the package and in extreme cases even damaging the package completely needing an immediate replacement. Moreover, considering that such conventional packages are usually made from ordinary mill board pasted with low quality paper obtained from very poor quality scrap, it is also found that contents in such poor quality packages usually get stuck with the paper such that either the sweet meat or like food product get attached to the paper and/or any colors/chemicals from the paper come in contact with the sweet meat thereby contaminating the contents and affecting its purity apart from making the box soggy, smelly, and flimsy.<br>
The above concerns related to packaging of food products such sweet meats and the like have lead to development of better quality packages such as sweet packing in boxes having glassine paper (butter paper) loosely pasted inside bottom of the box with a flap of the same paper to avoid direct contact of the sweet meat with the material used for box making. Such provision of butter paper in sweet meat boxes was found useful and to certain extent avoid the problems of contamination and sogginess conventional sweet meet boxes.<br>
The above success in providing for a more hygienic and safe sweet meat packing involving the use of butter paper and its wide acceptance in the market motivated the Applicants herein to develop further variety of improved boxes of sweet meet and another variety of sweet meet boxes were introduced by way of a laminated duplex board linear tray inside the bottom (box) with the glassine paper pasted on the linear side of the lid. This was also found to be of good quality and was successfully accepted in the market. Importantly, this development introduced for the first time the concept of developing food packages for the food industry, which would have attractive outlook and would therefore, favour its use for gifting packages in social occasion such as marriages and festivals.<br>
The above development was further followed with possible improvement in packaging of regular sweet boxes and the Applicants herein, further introduced a variety of box, which was made from a superior quality mill board/gray board laminated with pearlised, BOPP film with the help of selective adhesive. This development further protected the box and contents therein, by preventing moisture entry and/or seeping of liquids from the box to large extent.<br>
While such BOPB film coated boxes where found to be useful, however, the same was not sufficiently self-containing as far as arresting seepage of contents from<br>
the box leading to damage of the box. In particular, it was noticed that the boxes in spite of having such BOPP film in the base or at the sides, had serious limitations in arresting seepage from the corners, which allowed liquid and like content permeability through the box. In order to avoid such problems, people in the art have been using PVC/plastic trays in the boxes to prevent the corner seepage. However, as is well known, use of plastic or PVC is highly discouraging being environmentally hazardous and not at all eco-friendly. The above state of art on packages especially related to packaging of sweet meat involving delicate and liquid content go to show the continuing problem to provide an effective container/package for sweet meat and the like, which would facilitate seepage free and properly contained packaging of sweet meat and the like.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for a new variety of containing tray/packaging for sweet meat involving delicate and liquid content, which would take care of problems of seepage through corners of conventional packages and at the same time would be attractive and user friendly.<br>
Another object of the present invention is provide for a tray container/package obtained of a single piece package material such as die cut paper board of desired shape and sizes, which would avoid problems of seepage through corners and further avoid problems of environmentally hazardous PVC/plastic trays presently in use.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to a tray container/package for sweet meat and the like adapted by way of folding in such a way that the inner surface of the tray is maintained contiguous with the walls or inner side as well as the outer side.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is directed to a tray container/package for sweet meat and the like obtained of a single piece package material such as paper board, which would not require provision of cut corners but essentially obtained of folding and assembling of the package material/paper board such that the tray container/package is free of edges or cuts, which could come in contact with the contents and damage the later or vice-verse.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is directed to a tray container/package, which would avoid problems of seepage through the corners and can be provided with walls having channel like shape and configuration thereby adding to the aesthetic eye appeal of the package.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide for a tray container/package for sweet meat and the like, which would be safe and convenient to carry sweet meat and the like products with side walls of variety of dispositions selected from substantially vertical inner and outer wall, substantially slanted/angular inner and /or outer walls.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES<br>
The details of the invention, in particular, the single piece paperboard tray container/package, its objects and advantageous are explained hereunder in greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary illustrations detailing the manufacture of the container tray/package, wherein:<br>
Figures 1 to 6 illustrates in sequence the manner of manufacture of the tray container/package in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Reference is first invited to accompanying figure 1, which illustrates the single piece paper board (PB) used in the manufacture of the tray container/package of the invention. As discussed above, the package of the invention is obtained by way of a selective outward folding of edges of the package, which is explained hereunder and illustrate in sequence in figures 1 to 6:<br>
To facilitate the manufacture of the package of desired size, the dimension of the base (B) of the package are defined. Thereafter the depth of the side walls are identified and based on the selective depth of the side walls, in particular, the inner side wall, the first side walls (FSW) of the container are determined and marked by foldable edges, such that when folded along with the edge of the base (B) the side walls assumes the desired depth of the tray/package. The corner portions (CP) between two adjacent first side walls (FSW) are adapted to fold in a manner such that when folded this corner portion (CP) assumes a triangular configuration and can be disposed at the rear of any one of the two adjacent first side walls (FSW) to which this corner flap is connected free of any cuts and edge.<br>
Once, the first side walls (FSW) are erected and the corner flaps disposed selectively at the rear of said first side walls, the package tray can thereafter, provide for a channelized (CH) width of the tray/container. For the purpose, along the top edges of the first side walls, its outwardly extending wings are given a first outward fold (Fl), thereafter a second outward fold (F2) matching with the depth of the first side walls is provided to constitute the outer side walls of the box/tray and finally, a final third outward fold (F3) extends underneath the base of the tray/box to be secured by adhesives to thereby constitute the box configuration.<br>
Importantly, in order to provide for proper support to the channel, one of the two 'Adjacent side wall portions are provided with an extended first fold (EF1), extended second fold (EF2) and the extended third fold (EF3), which area adapted such that when the corner flap is folded and the adjacent walls define the container size, the extended fold member cover the corner flap fold and the at the same time provide for a support for the overlapping first (Fl) second (F2) and the third fold (F3) of the adjacent of the first side wall (FSW).<br>
It would be clearly evident from the above that the box of the invention involves basically a single piece package materials/paper boards and a selective outwardly folding technique, which fac9ilitates provision of a seepage free continuous corner region apart from a continuous base and side walls for the container. The corners, which are obtained free of any rough cuts or edges, therefore, not only avoid problems of seepage, but also provide for avoiding any damaging rough edges or cuts, which would coming contact to damage the contents of the box. Importantly, as further apparent from the above description and illustrations, the walls of the box can be channels of varied width depending upon the relative size or the walls can be straight folded without the channel formation in which case the second fold region (F2) need not be provided. The outer sidewalls can be substantially vertical along with the inner sidewalls or the outer and inner sidewalls can be selectively substantially vertical or inclined or tapered.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, it is possible to easily laminate the smooth contiguous surface portion of the tray container/package to made it totally leak proof and such that it can hold many kind liquid content.<br>
The box of the invention can be covered by any convenient lids/top cover, also made of paper board or like to cover the box structure. The container tray/package of the invention, therefore, avoid the problems and complicities resulting from seepage along corners of conventional packages, especially for sweet meat and other liquid content and also possibly provide for leak proof liquid content in a tray container/package. The package of the invention being obtained of eco-friendly material is environmentally safe, easy to manufacture and provide for the much required hygienic quality and characteristics for tray container/packages by way of the present cost effective and user -friendly container/tray/package of the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
