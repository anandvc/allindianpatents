3.PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br><br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner<br>
in which it is to be performed.	<br><br><br><br>
Technical field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the synthesis and purification of antimalarial drug involving Grignard reaction.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Lumefantrine (formerly known as benflumetol of Formula -I), was synthesized originally by Academy of Military Medical Sciences in Beijing, China. It is a racemic fluorene derivative with the chemical name 2-dibutylamino-l-[2,7-dichloro-9-(4-chlorobenzylidene)-9H-fluoren-4-yl]-ethanol.<br><br>
Malaria, transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito and caused by protozoa of the Plasmodium genus is a disease, which occurs in about 100 million people each year, and almost a million people die every year, mortality is more among children under 5 years of age who are especially sensitive because of their lack of immunity to the disease. There exist various forms of malaria Malaria tropica (caused by plasmodium falciparum), Malaria tertiana (caused by plasmodiumvivax or plasmodium ovale) and Malaris quartana (caused by plasmodium malariae). Malaria tropica is the most severe form of the disease, which is responsible for producing severe complication and celebral malaria, which can cause the patient to lapse into coma and ultimately to death. Severe P. falciparum infections are common in both rural and urban areas and the management of these cases has become difficult because of emerging problem of drug resistant infections. Lumefantrine has emerged as a new drug for the treatment of chloroquine<br>
2<br><br>
resistant, pernicious malignant malaria. The synthesis of lumefantrine was disclosed in Chinese patent CN 1042535 (1990). (Published on 30 May 1990), Atkinson et al J. Med. Chem. 11,1223(1968) and Atkinson et al., J. Med. Chem. 17, 1009 (1974). (Scheme I)<br><br><br><br>

NaOH/ p-chloro benzahdehyde<br><br>
The compound of formula II is reacted with dibutyl amine resulting in compound of Formula III which is further reacted with p-chloro benzaldehyde in ethanol in presence of sodium hydroxide for 24 hrs to give lumefantrine.<br>
The disadvantage of the prior art process is that reaction of compound of formula II with p-chloro benzaldehyde is very sluggish, the reaction does not go to completion even after 2 days and the starting material remains to the extent of about 5%, also the reaction generate lot of impurities (clearly seen on TLC), the resulting product has to be purified repeatedly to achieve a purity level acceptable for pharmaceutical use. This results in yield loss making the process cumbersome and uneconomical. Also the process for the preparation of 2,7 dichloro fluorene as disclosed in the prior art, involves the use of chlorine gas, using this process monchloro and trichoro impurities are formed resulting in a low yield of the product about 40%, hence there is a need for a process which generates<br>

less impurity and provide good yield. The yield of 2,7, dichloro fluorene will subsequently affect overall yield of lumefantrine in the process.<br>
And also there is need for an industrially viable process for the synthesis of lumefantrine, which generates less impurity and increased efficiency.<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the synthesis of antimalarial drug involving Grignard reactions more particularly for the synthesis of lumefantrine.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the synthesis of an intermediate 2,7 dichlorofluorene in good yield and purity.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the purification and isolation of lumefantrine.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
The present invention discloses improved processes for the synthesis and purification of antimalarial drug lumefantrine involving Grignard reaction. The process comprises condensation of 2,7-dihloro-9H-fluorene-4oxiran with p-chloro benzaldehyde in presence of a base to yield 2,7-dichloro -9-(4-chloro benzylidine) fluorine-4-oxirane; reaction of 22,7-dichloro -9(4-chloro benzylidine) fluorine-4-oxirane with a Grignard reagent of Formula IV in suitable organic solvent and isolation of the lumefantrine of Formula I from a suitable organic solvent.<br>
Another process comprises reaction of 2,7-dihloro-9H-fluorene-4oxiran with Grignard reagent of Formula IV to obtain compound of Formula V; reaction of compound V with p-Chloro benzaldehyde in presence of base in suitable solvent to yield lumefantrine of Formula I.<br>

In another aspect the present invention provides a new process for the synthesis of compound of formula I which comprises reacting compound of formula II with p-chloro benzaldehyde in presence of a base like sodium hydroxide potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate etc. preferably potassium carbonate using a suitable organic solvent like C1-C4 alcohols, acetonitrile, dimethyl formamide, etc. preferably dimethyl formamide at a temperature ranging from ambient to reflux temperature resulting in compound of formula III.<br>

In yet another aspect the compound of formula I was isolated using a suitable organic solvent like acetonitrile, C1 to C4 alcohol, diisopropyl ether, dichloromethane, hexane, dimethylformamide, water or mixtures thereof preferably acetonitrile.methanol mixture more preferably acetonitrile. Compound of formula I was dissolved in a suitable solvent preferably toluene and precipitated by adding an antisolvent like methanol, acetonitrile. Lumefantrine was also purified by just refluxing the slurry of crude product in a suitable solvent preferably acetonitrile or mixture of the above mentioned solvent and filtering the product at ambient temperature. Lumefantrine with HPLC purity of about 99.8% was achieved using the isolation method of the present invention.<br>

Example 5<br>
Magnesium turning (5 gms) was suspended in dry tetrahydrofuran (15 ml) at ambient temperature. Ethyl bromide (14.4 ml) dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (30 ml) was added dropwise to the reaction mass. After completion of addition reaction mass was heated to 60° for 1 hr and then cooled to room temperature. Dibutylamine (37 ml) dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (40ml) was added dropwise to the above reaction mass and further stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. The Grignard reagent formed was kept aside. In another reaction flask 2,7-dichloro-9-(4-chloro benzylidene) fluorene 4-oxirane(45 gms) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (250 ml) and chilled to 0°C . The Gignard reagent prepared earlier was added dropwise to the above reaction mass maintaining the temperature between 0-5°C and further stirred at 0°C for additional 2 hrs. The reaction mass was then quenched into 5% chilled ammonium chloride solution (1.5 ltr) under stirring. The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate. Ethyl acetate layer was dried over sodium sulphate and concentrated to residue. The residue was dissolved in hexane and the insoluble impurity was filtered. The hexane layer was concentrated to residue, the residue was stirred in a mixture of acetonitrile: methanol (1:1) (300 ml) and stirred for 8 hr. the resulting solid was filtered and recrystallised from acetonitrile and dried under vacuum at 60°C to give 2-dibutylamino-l-[2,7-dichloro-9-(4-chlorobenzylidene)-9 H-fluoren-4-yl]-ethanol (40 gms, 99.8% HPLC purity).<br>
