Step A - Pre-treatment and CED coating of object<br>
•	Surface of the object to be painted is cleaned and made free from rust<br>
•	Degreasing of said object<br>
•	Activating surface of said object<br>
•	Phosphating surface of said object<br>
•	Passivating surface of said object<br>
•	Cathodic electro deposition (CED) of said object after rinsing with DM water<br>
•	Ultra filtrate rinsing of said object<br>
•	Dewatering said surface of object<br>
•	Curing of said object Step B -Preparation of object<br>
•	Correction of imperfections of object by sanding, denting etc.<br>
•	Application of sole sealant and underbody compound<br>
•	Curing of said object Step C -Intermediate coating<br>
•	Application of surfacer coat on said object<br>
•	Air flash off on said surface<br>
•	Curing of surfacer coat<br><br><br>
Step D - Final finish Coating<br>
•	Wet sanding of the said object<br>
•	Tac - O - rag application<br>
•	Application of final finish coat on said object<br>
