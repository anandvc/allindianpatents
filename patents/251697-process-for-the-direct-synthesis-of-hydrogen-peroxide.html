				<td>Process for the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of<br>
an organic or aqueous-organic hydrogen peroxide solution<br>
by direct synthesis from a gaseous mixture containing<br>
hydrogen and oxygen, in the presence of a noble metal<br>
catalyst, it being possible for said process to be carried<br>
out in a stainless steel reactor without corrosion<br>
occurring on the reactor material.<br>
It is known to prepare hydrogen peroxide by direct<br>
synthesis from gaseous mixtures containing hydrogen and<br>
oxygen by reacting the gaseous mixture on a noble metal<br>
catalyst in the presence of a liquid aqueous, aqueous-<br>
organic or organic reaction medium. The organic or<br>
aqueous-organic hydrogen peroxide solutions obtainable by<br>
the direct synthesis process are of interest as oxidizing<br>
agents for the catalytic oxidation of organic compounds.<br>
A problem with the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide<br>
is the fact that the noble metal catalysts used have an<br>
unwanted catalytic activity in the catalytic decomposition<br>
of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. This unwanted<br>
activity of the catalyst can be inhibited by adding a<br>
sufficient concentration of a strong acid and a halide to<br>
the liquid reaction medium. However, because of the need<br>
to add acid and halide in order to achieve a high hydrogen<br>
peroxide selectivity, the liquid reaction medium becomes<br>
strongly corrosive towards metallic materials,<br>
particularly stainless steel.<br>
To be able to dissipate the high heat of reaction when<br><br>
carrying out the reaction on the industrial scale, it is<br>
desirable to use a reactor made of a metallic material.<br>
However, corrosion of the reactor material by the reaction<br>
medium gives rise to safety problems, especially if the<br>
direct synthesis is carried out at elevated pressure,<br>
which is desirable for achieving a high space-time yield.<br>
Furthermore, metal ions dissolved out of the reactor<br>
material by corrosion also have an adverse effect on the<br>
stability of the hydrogen peroxide solutions prepared, and<br>
cause unwanted secondary reactions when the solutions are<br>
used in oxidation reactions.<br>
The problem of corrosiveness due to the simultaneous<br>
presence of acid and halide ions in the reaction medium is<br>
known from EP-A 0 978 316 and EP-A 1 344 747. In both<br>
these documents, it is proposed to carry out the reaction<br>
in the presence of special catalysts in which the noble<br>
metal is applied to a catalyst support containing acid<br>
groups. Although the use of the proposed catalyst<br>
supports makes it possible to lower the acid concentration<br>
in the reaction medium, it is still necessary to add 3 to<br>
34 ppm of HBr in order to inhibit the decomposition<br>
activity of the noble metal catalyst, so the liquid<br>
reaction mixture remains corrosive. Because of the<br>
corrosive properties, EP-A 0 978 316 therefore uses<br>
autoclaves which are either made of the particularly<br>
corrosion-resistant alloy Hastelloy C or are made of<br>
stainless steel and have a glass insert to contain the<br>
liquid reaction medium.<br>
When carrying out the direct synthesis on the industrial<br>
scale, the use of highly corrosion-resistant alloys such<br>
as Hastelloy C or of reactor inserts or reactor coatings<br>
made of inert materials, for example glass or PTFE, as are<br>
known from the state of the art, incurs considerable extra<br><br>
expenditure and high costs in the manufacture of the<br>
reactors and hence makes the process uneconomic. There is<br>
therefore a need for a process for the direct synthesis of<br>
hydrogen peroxide in the presence of the concentration of<br>
acid and halide that is necessary to achieve a high<br>
hydrogen peroxide selectivity, it being possible for said<br>
process to be carried out in a reactor made of a<br>
commercially available stainless steel material without<br>
corrosion occurring on the reactor.<br>
It is known from DE-A 196 42 770 to carry out the direct<br>
synthesis in a methanolic reaction medium containing<br>
0.4 wt.% of sulfuric acid, 0.1 wt.% of phosphoric acid and<br>
6 ppm of bromide in the form of sodium bromide, and to use<br>
a shaped body made of V4A steel fabric coated with<br>
palladium metal as the catalyst. Because the V4A steel<br>
fabric is coated with metallic palladium, the V4A steel<br>
fabric used as the catalyst support is not in direct<br>
contact with the corrosive reaction mixture. The document<br>
thus provides no teaching as to how the corrosion of<br>
stainless steel on direct contact with the corrosive<br>
reaction mixture can be avoided.<br>
DE-A 198 57 137 describes the direct synthesis of hydrogen<br>
peroxide in a methanolic reaction medium containing<br>
0.3 wt.% of sulfuric acid, 0.03 wt.% of phosphoric acid<br>
and 5 ppm of bromide in the form of sodium bromide. The<br>
reaction is carried out in a V4A steel autoclave operated<br>
as a continuous stirred tank. The autoclave is operated<br>
in this case with a gas stirrer to disperse the gaseous<br>
mixture in the liquid reaction medium. For a construction<br>
of this type, the autoclave has to contain a gas cushion<br>
in the region of the cover so that the gas stirrer can<br>
suck in gas and distribute it in the reaction mixture.<br>
The document does not disclose the period of time over<br><br>
which the direct synthesis was carried out in the V4A<br>
stirred autoclave described. The document also does not<br>
disclose whether and to what extent corrosion occurred on<br>
the reaction vessel and how the reaction can be conducted<br>
so as to avoid corrosion of the reaction vessel.<br>
WO 03/082458 describes a process for the direct synthesis<br>
of hydrogen peroxide in which the gaseous mixture and the<br>
liquid reaction medium are passed at high velocity through<br>
a tubular reactor so that a coherent gas phase does not<br>
form in the reactor. As materials suitable for the<br>
reactor, the document mentions duplex stainless steels<br>
having a PREN number of more than 34. Said duplex<br>
stainless steels have a substantially higher chromium and<br>
molybdenum content than commercially available austenitic<br>
stainless steels and are therefore also substantially more<br>
expensive and less readily available. Because of the<br>
necessary high flow velocity of 1.2 m/s or more, the<br>
process described in WO 03/082458 also requires<br>
particularly long and hence expensive reactors. Thus, for<br>
example, a pressure reactor with a length of more than<br>
2000 m is used in Example 1 of WO 03/082458.<br>
It has now been found that the direct synthesis of<br>
hydrogen peroxide from a gaseous mixture containing<br>
hydrogen and oxygen, in the presence of a liquid reaction<br>
medium containing bromide and a strong acid, can be<br>
carried out in a reactor made of commercially available<br>
stainless steel without corrosion occurring on the reactor<br>
material if the reaction is carried out in such a way<br>
that, during the reaction, the surface of the stainless<br>
steel is at no point in permanent contact with the gaseous<br>
mixture passing through the reactor. The possibility of<br>
avoiding corrosion of the stainless steel reactor material<br>
by limiting the contact time between the reactor material<br><br>
and the gaseous mixture passing through the reactor is<br>
surprising to those skilled in the art and could not be<br>
anticipated from the state of the art because, in the<br>
state of the art, it was always assumed that corrosion is<br>
caused by the corrosive liquid medium and will always<br>
occur if the liquid reaction medium is in contact with the<br>
stainless steel.<br>
The invention therefore provides a process for the<br>
preparation of an organic or aqueous-organic hydrogen<br>
peroxide solution by direct synthesis, wherein a non-<br>
explosive gaseous mixture containing hydrogen and oxygen,<br>
and a liquid reaction medium containing at least one<br>
water-soluble organic solvent, a bromide and/or iodide in<br>
a concentration of 10-6 to 10-2 mol/kg and a strong acid in<br>
a concentration of 0.0001 to 0.5 mol/kg, are passed over a<br>
fixed bed arranged in the reactor and consisting of<br>
supported catalyst particles or a mixture of catalyst-<br>
containing and catalyst-free particles, characterized in<br>
that the reaction is carried out in a stainless steel<br>
reactor and, during the reaction, the surface of the<br>
stainless steel is at no point in permanent contact with<br>
the gaseous mixture passing through the reactor.<br>
The invention also provides a process for the catalytic<br>
oxidation of an organic substrate from the group<br>
comprising olefins, aromatic hydrocarbons that can carry<br>
substituents from the group comprising alkyl, alkoxy and<br>
hydroxyl, and carbonyl compounds, with an organic or<br>
aqueous-organic hydrogen peroxide solution, in the<br>
presence of an oxidation catalyst from the group<br>
comprising titanium silicalites and vanadium, molybdenum<br>
and/or tungsten compounds, wherein the organic or aqueous-<br>
organic hydrogen peroxide solution used has been obtained<br>
by the above-mentioned direct synthesis process according<br><br>
to the invention.<br>
In the process according to the invention, a gaseous<br>
mixture containing hydrogen and oxygen, and a liquid<br>
reaction medium containing a bromide and a strong acid,<br>
are passed over a fixed bed of catalyst, a stainless steel<br>
reactor being used and the liquid reaction medium being<br>
passed through the reactor in such a way that the surface<br>
of the stainless steel is at no point in permanent contact<br>
with the gaseous mixture passing through the reactor.<br>
"To be in permanent contact" is understood here as meaning<br>
that the surface of the stainless steel is not wetted by<br>
the liquid reaction medium for a prolonged period of time,<br>
but is in direct contact with the gas phase. At no point<br>
of the reactor does the surface of the stainless steel<br>
remain unwetted by the liquid medium for longer than 30<br>
minutes. The surface of the stainless steel preferably<br>
remains unwetted by the liquid medium for no longer than<br>
30 seconds and particularly preferably for no longer than<br>
1 second. In the most preferred embodiment, the liquid<br>
reaction medium is passed through the reactor in such a<br>
way that the surface of the stainless steel is<br>
continuously wetted by the liquid reaction medium at every<br>
point.<br>
The process according to the invention is preferably<br>
carried out in such a way that the reactor is flooded with<br>
the liquid reaction medium, and the gaseous mixture is<br>
distributed in the form of gas bubbles in the liquid<br>
reaction medium contained in the reactor. The reactor is<br>
constructed and operated so that gas cushions,- in""Which<br>
the gaseous mixture is in permanent contact with the<br>
reactor wall or with stainless steel reactor fittings, do<br>
not form in the reactor. An example of such an embodiment<br><br>
according to the invention is to carry out the reaction in<br>
a bubble column, the liquid reaction medium and the<br>
gaseous mixture being fed into the bottom part of the<br>
bubble column and the organic or aqueous-organic hydrogen<br>
peroxide solution prepared, together with unreacted gas,<br>
being withdrawn at the highest point of the bubble column<br>
reactor. The bubble column reactor in this case contains<br>
a fixed bed of supported catalyst particles or a mixture<br>
of catalyst-containing and catalyst-free particles, the<br>
fittings that hold the fixed bed of catalyst in the<br>
reactor being designed so that at no point does a gas<br>
cushion form which is in permanent contact with the<br>
reactor wall or with stainless steel fittings.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the process according to the<br>
invention can also be carried out in a trickle bed reactor<br>
in which suitable devices ensure that the entire reactor<br>
wall always "remains wetted by the liquid reaction medium.<br>
Preferably, for this purpose, at least part of the liquid<br>
reaction medium fed into the reactor is sprayed into the<br>
top end of the reactor in such a way that the entire inner<br>
wall of the reactor is wetted by sprayed reaction medium<br>
running down said wall.<br>
In terms of the invention, stainless steel is understood<br>
as meaning any metallic material which has iron as the<br>
main constituent and also has a chromium content in the<br>
range from 16.5 to 19 wt.%, a nickel content in the range<br>
from 10.5 to 15 wt.% and a molybdenum content of up to<br>
4 wt.%. Those skilled in the art are familiar with such<br>
stainless steels as materials for chemical reactors, for<br>
example under the DIN material references 1.4401, 1.4404,<br>
1.4406, 1.4429, 1.4541 and 1.4571 and the AISI material<br>
references 316, 316L, 316N and 316Ti.<br><br>
In the process according to the invention, the organic<br>
solvents used in the liquid reaction medium are capable of<br>
dissolving the hydrogen peroxide formed in the direct<br>
synthesis and the water formed as by-product. Said<br>
organic solvents are preferably ketones and alcohols<br>
having up to 6 carbon atoms, especially up to 4 carbon<br>
atoms. Particularly preferred solvents for carrying out<br>
the direct oxidation are methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and<br>
n-butanol, especially methanol.<br>
As regards the use of the hydrogen peroxide solution as an<br>
oxidizing agent for the oxidation of organic compounds, it<br>
is advantageous, where possible, for the water content of<br>
the organic solvent to be kept low. Advantageously, the<br>
water content of the organic medium is limited to max.<br>
20 wt.%, preferably 10 wt.%. Particularly preferably, the<br>
solvent used is methanol with a water content of 2 to<br>
10 wt.%.<br>
In addition to organic solvent and optionally water, the<br>
liquid reaction medium used for the direct synthesis also<br>
contains a strong acid and a halide in an amount that is<br>
appropriate for inhibiting the decomposition of hydrogen<br>
peroxide on the noble metal catalyst during the direct<br>
synthesis.<br>
In terms of the invention, strong acids are any acids with<br>
a pKa of less than 3 and preferably a pKa of less than 2.<br>
Mineral acids, such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and<br>
nitric acid, are particularly suitable. Sulfonic acids<br>
and phosphonic acids that are soluble in the medium can<br>
also be used. The acid concentration in the organic or<br>
aqueous-organic liquid medium ranges from 0.0001 to<br>
0.5 mol/kg, preferably from 0.001 to 0.2 mol/kg and<br>
particularly preferably from 0.01 to 0.1 mol/kg. If the<br><br>
acid concentration is above the claimed range, corrosion<br>
by the liquid phase can also occur; if it is below the<br>
claimed range, the hydrogen peroxide selectivity achieved<br>
is normally no longer sufficient. Lower acid<br>
concentrations are preferred in view of the subsequent use<br>
of the hydrogen peroxide solution formed.<br>
The halides used are bromide and iodide, preferably<br>
bromide. The liquid reaction medium contains the halide<br>
in a concentration ranging from 10-6 to 10-2 mol/kg,<br>
preferably from 10-5 to 10-3 mol/kg and particularly<br>
preferably from 10-5 to 5.10-4 mol/kg. If the halide<br>
concentration is above the claimed range, the stability of<br>
the hydrogen peroxide solution prepared is reduced; if it<br>
is below the claimed range, the hydrogen peroxide<br>
selectivity achieved is normally no longer sufficient.<br>
Lower halide concentrations are preferred in view of the<br>
subsequent use of the hydrogen peroxide solution formed.<br>
The halide can be added to the reaction medium in the form<br>
of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salt,<br>
preferably NaBr or Nal. The halide can also be added in<br>
the form of the hydrohalic acid, for example HBr or HI.<br>
The liquid reaction medium is preferably fed into the<br>
reactor at a rate such that the cross-sectional loading by<br>
the liquid phase in the reactor ranges from 0.3 to<br>
200 m/h, based on the unloaded cross section of the<br>
reactor. The cross-sectional loading ranges preferably<br>
from 0.3 to 20 m/h and particularly preferably from 1 to<br>
10 m/h. In the preferred range of cross-sectional<br>
loading, hydrogen peroxide solutions with a hydrogen<br>
peroxide content of 4 to 12 wt.% can be prepared, a high<br>
hydrogen peroxide selectivity, a high space-time yield and<br>
a long catalyst life being achieved at the same time.<br><br>
The composition of the gaseous mixture containing hydrogen<br>
and oxygen that is passed over the fixed bed containing<br>
the catalyst is chosen so that the gaseous mixture is not<br>
explosive. The gaseous mixture used is preferably one<br>
which reliably falls outside the explosion limit, even<br>
when the solvent partial pressure that develops is taken<br>
into account. Advantageously, the gaseous mixture also<br>
contains one or more inert gases, preferably nitrogen.<br>
The hydrogen content of the gaseous mixture is limited to<br>
max. 6 vol.%, preferably max. 5 vol.%. In particular, the<br>
hydrogen content ranges from 3 to 5 vol.%. The oxygen<br>
content of the gaseous mixture can be stoichiometric or<br>
hyperstoichiometric and preferably ranges from 10 to<br>
50 vol.%, especially from 15 to 40 vol.%. The hydrogen<br>
and oxygen are preferably fed into the reactor separately.<br>
The oxygen can be introduced either in pure form, or in<br>
the form of air, or in the form of oxygen-enriched air.<br>
The residual gas obtained at the outlet of the reactor can<br>
be wholly or partially recycled into the reactor in order<br>
to reduce the cost of recovering unreacted hydrogen.<br>
The process according to the invention can be carried out<br>
using any catalysts known from the state of the art for<br>
the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide and containing<br>
one or more noble metals, in the form of a fixed bed.<br>
Examples of suitable catalysts are known from<br>
EP-A 1 160 196 or US 6,168,775. It is also possible to<br>
use other commercially available noble metal catalysts,<br>
for example 3% Pd Degussa 105XR/W dried.<br>
The catalytically active component of the catalyst<br>
contains one or more noble metals in pure form or in the<br>
form of alloys. Preferred noble metals are the platinum<br>
metals, especially palladium and platinum, as well as<br>
gold. Elements from the group comprising Rh, Ru, Ir, Cu<br><br>
and Ag can also be present. Particularly preferred<br>
catalysts contain as catalytically active metals at least<br>
80 wt.% of palladium and 0 to 20 wt.% of platinum, as well<br>
as 0 to 20 wt.% of gold and/or 0 to 5 wt.% of silver in<br>
alloyed or unalloyed form.<br>
The catalysts can be either unsupported or supported, the<br>
latter being preferred. The catalytically active noble<br>
metal(s) can be present on the surface of a support<br>
material and/or be arranged as particles uniformly<br>
distributed within a bed of inert support material.<br>
The support materials are particulate materials such as<br>
powders, extrudates, granules or other shaped bodies<br>
formed from a pulverulent material. It is preferable to<br>
use oxide-based or silicate-based support materials,<br>
especially aluminium oxide, silica, titanium dioxide,<br>
zirconium dioxide and zeolites. An alternative<br>
possibility is to use carbon-based supports, for example<br>
activated carbon supports.<br>
It is possible to mix the catalytically active component,<br>
present in very finely divided form, with a pulverulent<br>
support material, plasticize and shape the mixture and<br>
consolidate the shaped bodies by calcination. According<br>
to one alternative, it is also possible to impregnate an<br>
already prefabricated, shaped support with a suspension<br>
containing the very finely divided, catalytically active<br>
component to give a so-called shell catalyst. When the<br>
catalytically active material is applied onto or into the<br>
support material, known binders, such as water glass,<br>
calcium oxalate, boric acid and other glass-forming<br>
compositions, can also be present. The application of the<br>
catalytically active material to a support material is<br>
conventionally followed by a calcination step at 300 to<br><br>
600°C. Finally, the catalytically active supported<br>
catalysts can also be obtained by impregnation of the<br>
support with a solution containing a compound of the<br>
catalytically active metals, followed by hydrogenation,<br>
calcination and washing steps.<br>
The size of the particles in the fixed bed can vary within<br>
wide limits and especially in the range from 0.1 to 10 mm.<br>
When using mixtures of catalytically active and inactive<br>
particles, it is also possible to use catalytically active<br>
particles with a size ranging from 0.02 to 0.1 mm. A<br>
small particle size leads to a larger pressure drop; if<br>
the particle size is too large, the catalytically active<br>
surface area decreases. Particle sizes ranging from 0.1<br>
to 5 mm, especially from 0.1 to 2 mm and particularly<br>
preferably from 0.1 to 0.5 mm lead to high productivities.<br>
As regards pressure and temperature, the reaction<br>
conditions correspond to those known from the state of the<br>
art. Thus the reaction temperature generally ranges from<br>
0 to 90°C, the preferred temperature range being from 20 to<br>
50°C. The pressure generally ranges from atmospheric<br>
pressure or a slightly reduced pressure to about 10 MPa.<br>
The reaction is preferably carried out at a pressure<br>
ranging from 0.5 to 5 MPa.<br>
Particularly advantageously, the process according to the<br>
invention can be integrated into an overall process for<br>
the oxidation of an organic substrate with hydrogen<br>
peroxide. Accordingly, a process has been found for the<br>
catalytic oxidation of an organic substrate from the group<br>
comprising olefins, aromatic hydrocarbons which can carry<br>
one or more substituents from the group comprising alkyl,<br>
alkoxy and hydroxyl groups, and carbonyl compounds, with<br><br>
an organic or aqueous-organic hydrogen peroxide solution<br>
prepared by direct synthesis in a stainless steel reactor,<br>
wherein, during the reaction to prepare the hydrogen<br>
peroxide, at no point does the surface of the stainless<br>
steel come into permanent contact with the gaseous mixture<br>
passing through the reactor. The oxidation takes place in<br>
the presence of an oxidation catalyst from the group<br>
comprising titanium silicalites and other vanadium,<br>
molybdenum and/or tungsten compounds, preferably in the<br>
presence of a titanium silicalite. The organic substrate<br>
is preferably an olefin oxidized to the epoxide and<br>
particularly preferably propene oxidized to propylene<br>
oxide. The oxidation process according to the invention<br>
is preferably carried out with a methanolic hydrogen<br>
peroxide solution containing 2 to 12 wt.% of water.<br>
The oxidation process according to the invention is<br>
distinguished by an improved selectivity of the oxidation<br>
reaction and a long life of the oxidation catalyst,<br>
especially if a titanium silicalite is used as the<br>
catalyst, since interfering transition metal ions enter<br>
the oxidation process in only trace amounts because<br>
corrosion is avoided in the preparation of the hydrogen<br>
peroxide solution.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the Examples and<br>
Comparative Examples which follow.<br>
Examples:<br>
Example 1<br>
Direct synthesis in a stainless steel bubble column<br>
reactor<br>
The direct synthesis was carried out in a bubble column<br><br>
reactor made of V4A stainless steel (material 1.4571) with<br>
an internal diameter of 16 mm and a length of 40 cm. The<br>
reactor contained a fixed bed of catalyst with a bulk<br>
volume of about 80 ml. The catalyst used was a mixture of<br>
catalytically active metal particles and inert particles.<br>
Catalytically active particles consisting of 95% of Pd and<br>
5% of Au were prepared analogously to DE 199 12 733. The<br>
inert material used was granular alpha-aluminium oxide<br>
from Ceramtech AG with the reference "Stemalox spray<br>
particles, fired, 0-0.5 mm, 85% Al2O3 content". Before<br>
use, the 
sieving. The very finely divided metallic catalyst powder<br>
was mixed with the oxidic support powder. The Pd content<br>
of the mixture of catalyst particles and inert particles<br>
was 0.25 wt.%.<br>
The reactor was operated as a flooded bubble column<br>
reactor with the gas and liquid flowing in cocurrent, at a<br>
pressure of 5 MPa (50 bar) and a reaction temperature of<br>
25°C. The liquid reaction medium used was methanol<br>
containing 0.0002 mol/1 of sodium bromide and 0.01 mol/1<br>
of sulfuric acid. The liquid reaction medium was fed into<br>
the bottom end of the reactor at 120 ml/h. The flow<br>
velocity of the liquid and the reactor cross section<br>
produced a liquid cross-sectional loading of 0.6 m/h.<br>
230 Nl/h of a gaseous mixture consisting of 3 vol.% of<br>
hydrogen, 20 vol.% of oxygen and 77 vol.% of nitrogen were<br>
simultaneously fed into the bottom end of the reactor.<br>
The reaction product, together with unreacted gas, was<br>
withdrawn from the top end of the reactor in such a way<br>
that no gas cushion formed inside the reactor.<br>
After 24 h the H2 conversion was 65%. The H2O2 selectivity<br>
based on the converted H2 was 74%. The H2O2 concentration<br>
at the end of the reactor was 5.2 wt.%. The palladium<br><br>
productivity was 14.1 g H2O2/g Pd-h.<br>
When the experiment had run for 600 h, the reaction was<br>
stopped and the reactor was emptied and examined for<br>
corrosion of the reactor material. No corrosion could be<br>
found in the reaction zone or in the top part of the<br>
reactor.<br>
Example 2 (Comparative Example)<br>
Direct synthesis in a Hastelloy C trickle bed reactor<br>
Example 1 was repeated except that a Hastelloy C4<br>
(material 2.4610) trickle bed reactor of the same<br>
dimensions was used, the liquid reaction medium and the<br>
gaseous mixture being fed into the top end of the reactor.<br>
After 24 h the H2 conversion was 69%. The H2O2 selectivity<br>
based on the converted H2 was 70%. The H2O2 concentration<br>
at the end of the reactor was 5.09 wt.%. The palladium<br>
productivity was 13.7 g H2O2/g Pd-h.<br>
After the experiment had run for 500 h, the reaction was<br>
stopped and the reactor was emptied and examined for<br>
corrosion of the reactor material. In the top part of the<br>
reactor, pronounced pitting corrosion was detectable in<br>
those areas which had been in permanent contact with the<br>
gas phase.<br>
Corrosion tests with reaction mixtures from the direct<br>
synthesis<br>
The corrosion tests were carried out on 60 x 20 mm V4A<br>
stainless steel (material 1.4571) or Hastelloy C4<br>
(material 2.4610) test pieces with a central TIG weld<br>
seam, which had been pickled with a mixture of HF and HNO3<br><br>
before the experiments.<br>
Example 3<br>
In a closed apparatus at 22 - 26°C, the weighed test pieces<br>
were completely immersed (c) or half immersed (h) in a<br>
methanolic reaction mixture from the direct synthesis<br>
which contained 2.20 wt.% of H2O2, 0.0002 mol/1 of NaBr and<br>
0.0005 mol/1 of H2SO4, the mixture being stirred. After 14<br>
days the test pieces were removed and visually examined<br>
for corrosion. They were then cleaned with 20 wt.% HNO3<br>
and reweighed in order to determine the erosion rates due<br>
to corrosion. The results of the corrosion tests are<br>
collated in Table 1. Pitting corrosion was only observed<br>
on those parts of the test pieces which had been in<br>
permanent contact with the gas phase forming above the<br>
reaction mixture.<br>
Table 1<br>
Corrosion after 14 days with 0.0002 mol/1 of NaBr and<br>
0.0005 mol/1 of H2SO4<br><br>
Example 4<br>
Example 3 was repeated with a methanolic reaction mixture<br>
from the direct synthesis which contained 3.63 wt.% of<br>
H2O2, 0.001 mol/1 of NaBr and 0.005 mol/1 of H2SO4. The<br><br>
test pieces were removed after 7 days and examined. The<br>
results of the corrosion tests are collated in Table 2.<br>
Pitting corrosion was only observed on those parts of the<br>
test pieces which had been in permanent contact with the<br>
gas phase forming above the reaction mixture.<br><br><br>
