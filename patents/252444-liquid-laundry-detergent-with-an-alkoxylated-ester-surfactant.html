LIQUID LAUNDRY DETERGENT WITH AN ALKOXYLATED ESTER SURFACTANT<br>
5<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to liquid aqueous laundry detergent compositions comprising alkoxylated carboxylic acid 10 ester surfactants in combination with free radical scavengers.<br>
     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Liquid laundry detergents are popular with the consumers. While 15 a variety of surfactants is available to manufacturers to .<br>
formulate these, it is desirable to include alkoxylated ester surfactants, due to its better bio-degradability in comparison to alcohol-based alkoxylates. In addition, alkoxylated ester surfactants are derived from a renewable source - oil and fat. 20 Unfortunately, alkoxylated ester surfactants hydrolyse in the presence of water, and especially under alkaline conditions. The hydrolysis has a dual disadvantage of destroying the surfactant and introducing fatty acid, one of the degradation products, which is, essentially, oily soil. The hydrolysis of 25 acid esters occurs in an aqueous, high pH environment, and so may occur in the bottled compositions on storage (most laundry compositions are aqueous and have pH of 6-10) .<br>
The following art describes compositions, in some instances 30 laundry compositions, that may include various, broadly ranging carboxylic acid esters and/or alkoxylated derivatives thereof: Koester et al.

II<br>
R1-C-0-(R2-0)n-R3<br>
invention have Formula (I) as follows: , 5 Where Ri is selected from linear or branched C6 to C22 alkyl or alkylene groups;<br>
R2 are selected from C2H4 or C3H6 groups;<br>
R3 are selected from H, CH3, C2HS or C3H7 groups,-and n has a value between 1 and 20.<br>
10<br>
Preferably,   RI   is  selected  from Ci2  to CiB,<br>
R2   is  C2H4,<br>
R3 is selected from CH3 and C2HS/ and n is a value between 3 and<br>
15, most preferably from 5 to 12.<br>
15<br>
The preferred compounds of formula (I) in the inventive<br>
compositions are selected from alkoxylated derivatives derived<br>
from coconut, palm, palm kernel, palm stearin, tallow, soybean<br>
and rapeseed oil due to their availability.<br>
20<br>
Carboxylic acid esters are available commercially or may be<br>
prepared by the alcoholysis of glycerides, preferrably from<br>
natural oil or fat, and the esterification of carboxylic acid<br>
with alcohol, e.g. methanol or ethanol, to form carboxylic acid<br>
25 ester; the alkoxylated derivatives may be obtained by the<br>
alkoxylation of carboxylic acid ester with alkylene oxide with<br>
the presence of catalyst. Carboxylic acid esters are also<br><br>
WO 2007/039026<br><br>
5<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/008423<br><br>
widely available as "bio-diesel". Twin River Technologies provides various types of carboxylic acid esters. Huntsman provides various alkoxylated carboxylic methyl esters.<br>
5 The amount of the alkoxylated derivative of ester employed in the inventive compositions is in the range of from 1% to 80%, preferably from 2% to 50%, most preferably from 3% to 20%, optimally from 4% to 15%, by weight of the composition. The concentration of alkoxylated esters in an aqueous wash liquor<br>
10 preferably in the range of from 1 ppm to 1000 ppm.<br>
i<br>
Generally, the amount of the alkoxylated ester surfactant in the inventive compositions is substantially the same upon storage, due to the ability of the free radical scavenger to<br>
15 preserve this surfactant. Preferably, the stability upon storage of the inventive compositions is that at least 70%, preferably at least 80%, most preferably at least 90% of the originally formulated amount of the alkoxylated ester surfactant, is still present in the composition upon storage at<br>
20 4 0°C for 3 months.<br>
SURFACTANT<br>
The overall amount of surfactant in the inventive compositions 25 is generally in the range of from 5 to 80%, preferably from 10 to 60%, most preferably from 15 to 30%. The alkoxylated ester of the present invention is a nonionic surfactant. Thus, the alkoxylated ester may be the sole surfactant in the composition, or may be co-present with other surfactants. 30 Preferably the alkoxylated ester surfactant is included in the inventive compositions in combination with anionic, cationic and amphoteric surfactant, most preferably anionic surfactant.<br><br>
WO 2007/039026	PCT/EP2006/008423 '<br>
6<br>
The preferred ratio of alkoxylated ester surfactant to the sum of other surfactants is between 5:1 to 1:5, and more preferably between 3:1 to 1:3.<br>
Furthermore, it is to be understood that any surfactant 5 described below may be used in combination with any other surfactant or surfactants.<br>
Anionic Surfactant Detergents<br>
Anionic surface active agents which may be used in the present 10 invention are those surface active compounds which contain a long chain hydrocarbon hydrophobic group in their molecular structure and a hydrophilic group, i.e. water soluble group such as carboxylate, sulfonate or sulfate group or their corresponding acid form. The anionic surface active agents 15 include the alkali metal (e.g. sodium and potassium) and<br>
nitrogen based bases (e.g. mono-amines and polyamines) salts of water soluble higher alkyl aryl sulfonates, alkyl sulfonates, alkyl sulfates and the alkyl polyether sulfates. They may also include fatty acid or fatty acid soaps. One of the preferred 20 groups of mono-anionic surface active agents are the alkali metal, ammonium or alkanolamine salts of higher alkyl aryl sulfonates and alkali metal, ammonium or alkanolamine salts of higher alkyl sulfates or the mono-anionic polyamine salts. Preferred higher alkyl sulfates are those in which the alkyl 25 groups contain 8 to 26 carbon atoms, preferably 12 to 22 carbon atoms and more preferably 14 to 18 carbon atoms. The alkyl group in the alkyl aryl sulfonate preferably contains 8 to 16 carbon atoms and more preferably 10 to 15 carbon atoms.  A particularly preferred alkyl aryl sulfonate is the sodium, 30 potassium or ethanolamine Cio to C16 benzene sulfonate, e.g. sodium linear dodecyl benzene sulfonate. The primary and secondary alkyl sulfates can be made by reacting long chain<br><br>
WO 2007/039026<br><br>
7<br><br>
PCTYEP2006/008423<br><br>
olefins with sulfites or bisulfites, e.g. sodium bisulfite. The alkyl sulfonates can also be made by reacting long chain normal paraffin hydrocarbons with sulfur dioxide and oxygen as describe in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,503,280, 2,507,088, 3,372,188 5 and 3,260,741 to obtain normal or secondary higher alkyl sulfates suitable for use as surfactant detergents.<br>
The alkyl substituent is preferably linear, i.e. normal alkyl, however, branched chain alkyl sulfonates can be employed,<br>
10 although they are not as good with respect to biodegradability. The alkane, i.e. alkyl,   substituent may be terminally sulfonated or may be joined, for example, to the 2-carbon atom of the chain, i.e. may be a secondary sulfonate- It is understood in the art that the substituent may be joined to any<br>
15 carbon on the alkyl chain. The higher alkyl sulfonates "can be used as the alkali metal salts, such as sodium and potassium. The preferred salts are the sodium salts. The preferred alkyl sulfonates are the Ci0 to C18 primary normal alkyl sodium and potassium sulfonates, with the Ci0 to Cis primary normal alkyl 20 sulfonate salt being more preferred.<br>
Mixtures of higher alkyl benzene sulfonates and higher alkyl sulfates can be used as well as mixtures of higher alkyl benzene sulfonates and higher alkyl polyether sulfates.<br>
25<br>
The higher alkyl polyethoxy sulfates used in accordance with the present invention can be normal or branched chain alkyl and contain lower alkoxy groups which can contain two or three carbon atoms. The normal higher alkyl polyether sulfates are<br>
30 preferred in that they have a higher degree of biodegradability than the branched chain alkyl and the lower poly alkoxy groups are preferably ethoxy groups.<br><br>
WO 2007/039026<br><br>
8<br><br>
PCT/EP2006rt)08423<br><br>
The preferred higher alkyl polyethoxy sulfates used in accordance with the present invention are represented by the formula:<br>
5      R1 - O (CH2CH20) p - S03M,<br>
where R1 is C8 to C2o alkyl, preferably C10 to C18 and more preferably Ci2 to C15;   p is 1 to 8, preferably 2 to 6, and more preferably 2 to 4; and M is an alkali metal, such as sodium and 10 potassium, an ammonium cation or polyamine. The sodium and potassium salts, and polyaimines are preferred.<br>
A preferred higher alkyl poly ethoxylated sulfate is the sodium salt of a triethoxy Ci2 to C15 alcohol sulfate having the 15 .formula:<br>
C12-15-O- (CH2CH20)3-S03Na<br>
Examples of suitable alkyl ethoxy sulfates that can be used in 20 accordance with the present invention are C12-15 normal or<br>
primary alkyl triethoxy sulfate, sodium salt; n-decyl diethoxy sulfate, sodium salt; C12  primary alkyl diethoxy sulfate, ammonium salt; Ci2 primary alkyl triethoxy sulfate, sodium salt; C15 primary alkyl tetraethoxy sulfate, sodium salt; mixed C14-15 25 normal primary alkyl mixed tri- and tetraethoxy sulfate, sodium salt; stearyl pentaethoxy sulfate, sodium salt; and mixed C10-18 normal primary alkyl triethoxy sulfate, potassium salt.<br>

WO 2007/039026	PCT/EP2006/008423<br>
9<br>
The anionic surfactant is present in an amount of from 0 to 70%, preferably at least 5%, generally from 5 to 50%, more preferably from 5 to 20%.<br>
5 Additional Nonionic Surfactant<br>
Nonionic surfactants in addition to the alkoxylated ester<br>
surfactants may be included.<br>
As is well known, the nonionic surfactants are characterized by<br>
,10 the presence of a hydrophobic group and an organic hydrophilic group and are typically produced by the condensation of an organic aliphatic or alkyl aromatic hydrophobic compound with ethylene oxide (hydrophilic in nature). Typical suitable nonionic surfactants are those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
15 4,316,812 and 3,630,929, incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Usually, the nonionic surfactants are polyalkoxylated lipophiles wherein the desired hydrophile-lipophile balance is obtained from addition of a hydrophilic poly-alkoxy group to a<br>
20 lipophilic moiety. A preferred class of nonionic detergent is the alkoxylated alkanols wherein the alkanol is of 9 to 20 carbon atoms and wherein the number of moles of alkylene oxide (of 2 or 3 carbon atoms) is from 3 to 20. Of such materials it is preferred to employ those wherein the alkanol is a fatty<br>
25 alcohol of 9 to 11 or 12 to 15 carbon atoms and which contain from 5 to 9 or 5 to 12 alkoxy groups per mole.  Also preferred is paraffin - based alcohol (e.g. nonionics from Huntsman or Sassol).<br>
30 Exemplary of such compounds are those wherein the alkanol is of 10 to 15 carbon atoms and which contain about 5 to 12 ethylene oxide groups per mole, e.g. Neodol 25-9 and Neodol 23-6.5,<br><br>
WO 2007/039026	PCT/EP2006/008423<br>
10<br>
which products are made by Shell Chemical Company, Inc. The former is a condensation product of a mixture of higher fatty alcohols averaging about 12 to 15 carbon atoms, wit about 9 moles of ethylene oxide and the latter is a corresponding 5 mixture wherein the carbon atoms content of the higher fatty alcohol is 12 to 13 and the number of ethylene oxide groups present averages about 6.5. The higher alcohols are primary alkanols.<br>
10 Another subclass of alkoxylated surfactants which can be used contain a precise alkyl chain length rather than an alkyl chain distribution of the alkoxylated surfactants described above. Typically, these are referred to as narrow range alkoxylates. Examples of these include the Neodol-1(R&gt; series of surfactants<br>
15 manufactured by Shell Chemical Company.<br>
Other useful nonionics are represented by the commercially well known class of nonionics sold under the trademark Plurafac by BASF. The Plurafacs are the reaction products of a higher<br>
20 linear alcohol and a mixture of ethylene and propylene oxides, containing a mixed chain of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, terminated by a hydroxyl group. Examples include Ci3-Ci5 fatty alcohol condensed with 6 moles ethylene oxide and 3 moles propylene oxide, C13-Ci5 fatty alcohol condensed with 7 moles<br>
25 propylene oxide and 4 moles ethylene oxide, Ci3-C15 fatty<br>
alcohol condensed with 5 moles propylene oxide and 10 moles ethylene oxide or mixtures of any of the above.<br>
Another group of liquid nonionics are commercially available 30 from Shell Chemical Company, Inc. under the Dobanol or Neodol trademark: Dobanol 91-5 is an ethoxylated C9-C11 fatty alcohol with an average of 5 moles ethylene oxide and Dobanol 25-7 is<br><br>
WO 2007/039026<br><br>
11<br><br>
PCT7EP2006/00S423<br><br>
an ethoxylated Ci2-Cls  fatty alcohol with an average of 7 moles<br>
ethylene oxide per mole of fatty alcohol.	 <br>
In the compositions of this invention, preferred nonionic 5 surfactants include the Ci2-C15 primary fatty alcohols with relatively narrow contents of ethylene oxide in the range of from about 6 to 9 moles, and the C9 to Cn fatty alcohols ethoxylated with about 5-6 moles ethylene oxide.<br>
10 Another class of nonionic surfactants which can be used in accordance with this invention are glycoside surfactants. Glycoside surfactants suitable for use in accordance with the present invention include those of the formula:<br>
15      RO- (R20)y- (2)x<br>
wherein R is a monovalent organic radical containing from about 6 to about 30 {preferably from about 8 to about 18) carbon atoms; R2 is a divalent hydrocarbon radical containing from<br>
20 about 2 to 4 carbons atoms; O is an oxygen atom; y is a number which can have an average value of from 0 to about 12 but which is most preferably zero; Z is a moiety derived from a reducing saccharide containing 5 or 6 carbon atoms; and x is a number having an average value of from 1 to about 10 {preferably from<br>
25 about 1 1/2 to about 10).<br>
A particularly preferred group of glycoside surfactants for use in the practice of this invention includes those of the formula above in which R is a monovalent organic radical {linear or 30 branched) containing from about 6 to about 18 (especially from about 8 to about 18) carbon atoms; y is zero; z is glucose or a moiety derived therefrom; x is a number having an average value of from 1 to about 4 (preferably from about 1 1/2 to 4).<br><br>
WO 2007/039026<br><br>
12<br><br>
PCTYEP2006/008423<br><br>
Nonionic surfactants which may be used include polyhydroxy amides as discussed in U.S. Patent No. 5,312,954 to Letton et al. and aldobionamides such as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5 5,389,279 to Au et al., both of which are hereby incorporated by reference into the subject application.<br>
Mixtures of two or more of the nonionic surfactants can be used.<br>
10<br>
Generally, nonionics {other than alkoxylated esters required by the present invention) would comprise 0-75%, preferably 2 to 50%, more preferably 0 to 15%, most preferably 0 to 10%. The level of nonionic surfactant may be lowered compared to the<br>
15 typical compositions, due to the unexpected advantage of the esters/alkoxylated derivatives in the iriventive compositions contribution to the oily soil removal.<br>
Preferred inventive compositions comprise both anionic and 20 nonionc surfactants, typically in a weight ratio of from 1:4 to 4:1.<br>
Cationic Surfactants<br>
Many cationic surfactants are known in the art, and almost any 25 cationic surfactant having at least one long chain alkyl group of about 10 to 24 carbon atoms is suitable in the present invention. Such compounds are described in "Cationic Surfactants", Jungermann, 1970, incorporated by reference.<br>
30 Specific cationic surfactants which can be used as surfactants in the subject invention are described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 4,497,718, hereby incorporated by reference.<br><br>
WO 2007/039026	PCT/EP2006/008423<br>
13<br>
As with the nonionic and anionic surfactants, the compositions of the invention may use cationic surfactants alone or in combination with any of the other surfactants known in the art. 5 Of course, the compositions may contain no cationic surfactants at all.<br>
Amphoteric Surfactants<br>
10 Ampholytic synthetic surfactants can be broadly described as derivatives of aliphatic or aliphatic derivatives of heterocyclic secondary and tertiary amines in which the aliphatic radical may be straight chain or branched and wherein one of the aliphatic substituents contains from about 8 to 18<br>
15 carbon atoms and at least one contains an anionic water-soluble group, e.g. carboxylate, sulfonate, sulfate. Examples of compounds falling within this definition are sodium 3-(dodecylamino)propionate, sodium 3- (dodecylamino) propane-1-sulfonate, sodium 2-(dodecylamino)ethyl sulfate,<br>
20 sodium 2 - (dimethylamino) octadecanoate, disodium<br>
3- (N-carboxymethyldodecylamino)propane 1-sulfonate, disodium octadecyl - imminodiacetate, sodium 1 -carboxymethyl - 2 -undecylimidazole, and sodium N,N-bis (2-hydroxyethyl) -2-sulfato-3- dodecoxypropylamine. Sodium 3- (dodecylamino) 25 propane-1-sulfonate is preferred.<br>
Zwitterionic surfactants can be broadly described as derivatives of secondary and tertiary amines, derivatives of heterocyclic secondary and tertiary amines, or derivatives of 30 quaternary ammonium, quaternary phosphonium or tertiary sulfonium compounds. The cationic atom in the quaternary compound can be part of a heterocyclic ring. In all of these compounds there is at least one aliphatic group, straight chain<br><br>

or branched, containing from about 3 to 18 carbon atoms and at least one aliphatic substituent containing an anionic water-soluble group, e.g., carboxy, sulfonate, sulfate, phosphate, or phosphonate. 5<br>
Specific examples of zwitterionic surfactants which may be used are set forth in U.S. Patent No. 4,062,647, hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
10 FREE RADICAL SCAVENGER<br>
Suitable radical scavengers for use herein include the well-known substituted mono and dihydroxy benzenes and their analogs, alkyl and aryl carboxylates and mixtures thereof.<br>
15 Preferred such radical scavengers for use herein include di-tert-butyl hydroxy toluene (BHT), hydroquinone, di-tert-butyl hydroquinone, mono-tert-butyl hydroquinone, tert-butyl-hydroxy anisole (BHA) , benzoic acid, toluic acid, catechol, t-butyl catechol, benzylamine, 1,1, 3-tris(2-methyl-4-hydroxy-5-t-<br>
20 butylphenyl) butane, n-propyl-gallate or mixtures thereof and highly preferred is di-tert-butyl hydroxy toluene.<br>
» The amounts of free radical scavenger in the inventive<br>
compositions are important. If too low an amount is employed,<br>
25 relative to the amount of the alkoxylated ester, then of course<br>
the hydrolysis of the ester still occurs. If too high an amount<br>
is included, relative to the amount of the alkoxylated ester,<br>
then the free radical scavenger is oxidised; the presence of<br>
substantial amounts of greater than 0.2% of free radical<br>
30 scavenger in a composition results in yellowing of the<br>
composition, due to increased amounts of oxidised free radical<br>
scavenger. According to the present invention, the mole ratio<br>
of the alkoxylated ester to the free radical scavenger is in<br><br>
WO 2007/039026	PCT/EP2006/008423<br>
15<br>
the range from 500*. 1 to 20:1, preferably from 250:1 to 30:1, most preferably from 200:1 to 50:1.<br>
Generally, the amount of free radical scavenger in the 5 inventive composition is at most 0.2%, preferably at most 0.1%, most preferably at most 0.05%, in order to optimise preservation of the alkoxylated ester surfactant, while avoiding the yellowing of the composition. During the wash, the aqueous laundry wash liquor preferably contains from about from 10 about 0.01 ppm to about 12 ppm of free radical scavenger in order to ensure the protection of ester surfactants.<br>
OXIDISED FREE RADICAL SCAVENGER<br>
15 Oxidized free radical scavenger produces off-color, e.g.<br>
yellowing of the inventive composition. The most common free radical scavenger has a pheno structure, e.g. B.H.T. After oxidation, the pheno type if structure is oxidized and converted in a quinone type of structure—generally, quinones<br>
20 cause the yellowing of the composition.<br>
The generation of oxidized free radical scavenger also means that the scavenging capacity of free radical is reduced. Because free radical scavengers will be naturally oxidized even 25 without the presence of free radicals, the amount of oxidised free radical scavenger in a composition is limited to at most 0.2%, preferably at most 0.1%, most preferably at most 0.05 %.<br>
The inventive composition preferably have colour stability 30 (they remain clear, without yellowing) of at least 1 month, preferably at least 3 months on storage at 4 0°C.<br><br>
WO 2007/039026	PCT/EP2006/008423<br>
16<br>
WATER<br>
The inventive compositions are aqueous. The inventive 5 compositions comprise generally from 15% to 90%, preferably from 30% to 80%, most preferably, to achieve optimum cost and ease of manufacturing, from 50% to 70% of water. Other liquid components, such as solvents, surfactants, liquid organic matters including organic bases, and their mixtures can be co-10 present.<br>
Solvents that may be present include but are not limited to alcohols, surfactant, fatty alcohol ethoxylated sulfate or surfactant mixes, alkanol amine, polyamine, other polar or non-15 polar solvents, and mixtures thereof.<br>
PH<br>
The pH of the inventive compositions is generally in the range 20. of from 6 to 9.5, preferably of 6.5 to 9 and most preferably of 7 to 8.5. Surprisingly, even at this alkaline pH and even in the presence of substantial amounts of water, the alkoxylated ester nonionic surfctant does not substantially degrade in the inventive compositions, by virtue of the inclusion of the free 25 radical scavenger.<br>
Additional Laundry Ingredients<br>
The inventive compositions may include additional carboxylic 30 acid esters and/or alkoxylated derivatives thereof, in addition to alkoxylated esters already included in the present invention.<br><br>
WO 2007/039026	PCT/EP2006/008423<br>
17<br>

20 Enzymes<br>
One or more enzymes as described in detail below, may be used in the compositions of the invention.<br>
25 If a lipase is used, it has to be isolated from the alkoxylated ester surfactant in the inventive compositions, either by encapsulation or in separate compartments due to the ability of lipase to decompose esters. The lipolytic enzyme may be either a fungal lipase producible by Humicola_lanuginosa and<br>
30 Thermomyces lanuginosus, or a bacterial lipase which show a positive immunological cross-reaction with the antibody of the<br><br>
WO 2007/039026	PCT/EP2006/008423<br>
lipase produced by the microorganism Chromobacter vxscosum var. lipolyticum NRRL B-3673.<br>
An example of a fungal lipase as defined above is the lipase ex 5 Humicola lanuginosa, available fro. Amano under the tradename Amano CE,- the lipase ex Hunucola lanuginosa as described m the aforesaid European Patent Application 0,258,068 (NOVO,, as well as the lipase obtained by cloning the gene from Humxcola lanuginosa and expressing this gene in Aspergillus oryzae, 10 commercially available from Novozymes under the tradename<br>
Lipolase". This lipolase is a preferred lipase for use in the. present invention.<br>
While various specific lipase enzymes have been described 15 above, it is to be understood that any lipase which can confer the desired lipolytic activity to the composition may be used and the invention is not intended to be limited in any way by specific choice of lipase enzyme.<br>
20 The lipases of this embodiment of the invention are included in the liquid detergent composition in such an amount that the final composition has a lipolytic enzyme activity of from 100. to 0 005 LU/ml in the wash cycle, preferably 25 to 0.05 LU/ml-when the formulation is dosed at a level of about .1-10, more<br>
25 preferably .5-7, most preferably 1-2. g/liter.<br>
Naturally, mixtures of the above lipases can be used. The lipases can be used in their non-purified form or in a punffed form, e.g. purified with the aid of well-lcnown absorption 3 0 methods, such as phenyl sepharose absorption techniques.<br>
If a protease is used, the proteolytic enzyme can be of vegetable, animal or microorganism origin. Preferably, it is  <br><br>
WO 2007/039026<br><br>
21<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/008423<br><br>

Naturally, mixtures 10 of different proteolytic enzymes may be used.<br>
While various specific enzymes have been described above, it is to be understood that any protease which can confer the desired proteolytic activity to the composition may be used and this 15 embodiment of the invention is not limited in any way to a specific choice  of proteolytic enzyme.<br>
In addition to lipases or proteases, it is to be understood that other enzymes such as cellulases, oxidases, amylases,<br>
20 peroxidases and the like which are well known in the art may also be used with the composition of the invention. The enzymes may be used together with co-factors required to promote enzyme activity, i.e., they may be used in enzyme systems, if required. It should also be understood that enzymes having<br>
25 mutations at various positions (e.g., enzymes engineered for performance and/or stability enhancement) are also contemplated by the invention.<br>
The enzyme stabilization system may comprise calcium ion; boric 30 acid, propylene glycol and/or short chain carboxylic acids. The composition preferably contains from about 0.01 to about 50, preferably from about 0.1 to about 30, more preferably from about 1 to about 20 millimoles of calcium ion per liter.<br><br>
WO 2007/039026	PCT/EP2006/008423<br>
22<br>
When calcium ion is used, the level of calcium ion should be selected so that there is always some minimum level available for the enzyme after allowing for complexation with builders, 5 etc., in the composition. Any water-soluble calcium salt can be used as the source of calcium ion, including calcium chloride, calcium formate, calcium acetate and calcium propionate. A small amount of calcium ion, generally from about 0.05 to about 2.5 millimoles per liter, is often also present in the 10 composition due to calcium in the enzyme slurry and formula water.<br>
Another enzyme stabilizer which may be used is propionic acid or a propionic acid salt capable of forming propionic acid. 15 When used, this stabilizer may be used in an amount from about 0.1% to about 15% by weight of the composition.<br>

20 2 to 6 carbon atoms and from 2 to 6 hydroxy groups. Examples include propylene glycol (especially 1,2 propane diol which is preferred), ethylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol, mannitol and glucose. The polyol generally represents from about 0.1 to 25% by weight, preferably about 1.0% to about 15%, more preferably<br>
25 from about 2% to about 8% by weight of the composition.<br>
The composition herein may also optionally contain from about 0.25% to about 5%, most preferably from about 0.5% to about 3% by weight of boric acid. The boric acid may be, but is 3 0 preferably not, formed by a compound capable of forming boric acid in the composition. Boric acid is preferred, although other compounds such as boric oxide, borax and other alkali metal borates (e.g., sodium ortho-, meta- and pyroborate and<br><br>
WO 2007/039026	PCT/EP2006/008423<br>
23<br>
sodium pentaborate) are suitable. Substituted boric acids (e.g., phenylboronic acid, butane boronic acid and a p-bromo phenylboronic acid) can  also be used in place of boric acid.<br>
5 One preferred stabilization system is a polyol in combination with boric acid. Preferably, the weight ratio of polyol to boric acid added is at least 1, more preferably at least about 1.3.<br>
10 Another preferred stabilization system is the pH jump system such as is taught in U.S. Patent No. 5,089,163 to Aronson et al., hereby incorporated by reference into the subject application. A pH jump heavy duty liquid is a composition containing a system of components designed to adjust the pH of 15 the wash liquor. To achieve the required pH regimes, a pH jump system can be employed in this invention to keep the pH of the product low for enzyme stability in multiple enzyme systems {e.g., protease and lipase systems) yet allow it to become moderately high in the wash for detergency efficacy. One such 20 system is borax 10H20/ polyol. Borate ion and certain cis 1,2 polyols  complex when concentrated to cause a reduction in pH. Upon dilution, the complex dissociates, liberating free borate to raise the pH. Examples of polyols which exhibit this complexing mechanism with borax include catechol, galacitol, 25 fructose, sorbitol and pinacol. For economic reasons, sorbitol is the preferred polyol.<br>
Sorbitol or equivalent component (i.e., 1,2 polyols noted above) is used in the pH jump formulation in an amount from 30 about 1 to 25% by wt. , preferably 3 to 15% by wt. of the composition.<br><br>
WO 2007/039026<br><br>
24<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/008423<br><br>
Borate or boron compound is used in the pH jump composition in an amount from about 0.5 to 10.0% by weight of the composition, preferably 1 to 5% by weight.<br>
5 Alkalinity buffers which may be add^d to the compositions of the invention include monoethanolamine, triethanolamine, borax and the like.<br>
The inventive compositions preferably include from 0.01% to 10 2.0%, more preferably from 0.05% to 1.0%, most preferably from 0.05% to 0.5% of a fluorescer. Examples of suitable fluorescers include but are not limited to derivative of stilbene, pyrazoline, coumarin, carboxylic acid, methinecyamines, dibenzothiophene-5,5-dioxide azoles, 5-,. and 6—membered-ring 15 heterocycles, triazole and benzidine sulfone compositions, especially sulfonated substituted triazinyl stilbene, sulfonated naphthotriazole stilbene, benzidene sulfone, etc. Most preferred are UV/stable brighteners {for compositions visible in transparent containers), such as distyrylbiphenyl 20 derivatives (Tinopal* CBS-X).<br>
In addition, various other detergent additives or adjuvants may be present in the detergent product to give it additional desired properties, either of functional or aesthetic nature.<br>
25<br>
Improvements in the physical stability and anti-settling properties of the composition may be achieved by the addition of a. small effective amount of an aluminum salt of a higher fatty acid, e.g., aluminum stearate, to the composition. The<br>
30 aluminum stearate stabilizing agent can be added in an amount of 0 to 3%, preferably 0.1 to 2.0% and more preferably 0.5 tc 1.5%.<br><br>
WO 2007/039026<br><br>
25<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/008423<br><br>
There also may be included in the formulation, minor amounts of soil suspending or anti-redeposition agents, e.g. polyvinyl alcohol, fatty amides, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxy-propyl methyl cellulose. A preferred anti-redeposition 5 agent is sodium carboxylmethyl cellulose having a 2:1 ratio of CM/MC which is sold under the tradename Relatin DM 4050.<br>
Anti-foam agents, e.g. silicon compounds/ such as Silicane L 7604, can also be added.<br>
10<br>
Bactericides, e.g. tetrachlorosalicylanilide and hexachlorophene, fungicides, dyes, pigments (water dispersible), preservatives, e.g. formalin, ultraviolet absorbers, anti-yellowing agents, such a.&amp;  sodium carboxymethyl<br>
15 cellulose, pH modifiers and pH buffers, color safe bleaches, perfume and dyes and bluing agents such as Iragon Blue L2D, Detergent Blue 472/572 and ultramarine blue can be used.<br>
Also, soil release polymers and cationic softening agents may 20 be used.<br>
Preferably, the detergent composition is a colored composition packaged in the transparent/translucent ("see-through") container. 25<br>
PROCESS OF MAKING<br>
The inventive compositions may be prepared by any method known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Surfactants, including the 30 alkoxylated ester surfactant are pre-mixed- The rest of the ingredients, if any, such as, whitening agent, functional polymers, perfume, enzyme, colorant, preservatives are then mixed to obtain an isotropic liquid. In general, the<br><br>
WO 2007/039026	PCT/EP2006/008423<br>
26<br>
alkoxylated ester surfactant is preferably not contacted with a strong base, e.g. NaOH, to prevent the degradation of the surfactant. If the contact between the alkoxylated ester surfactant and a strong base is necessary, then the contact 5 time should be kept as short as possible.<br>
CONTAINER<br>
Preferred containers are transparent/translucent bottles.<br>
10 "Transparent" as used herein includes both transparent and<br>
translucent and means that a composition or a package according to the invention preferably has a transmittance of more than 25%, more preferably more than 30%, most preferably more than 40%, optimally more than 50% in the visible part of the<br>
15 spectrum (approx. 410-800 nm). Alternatively, absorbency may be measured as less than 0.6 (approximately equivalent to 25% transmitting) or by having transmittance greater than 25% wherein % transmittance equals: i/io3absorbancy x 100%. For purposes of the invention, as long as one wavelength in the 20 visible light range has greater than 25% transmittance, it is considered to be transparent/translucent.<br>
Transparent bottle materials with which this invention may be used include, but are not limited to: polypropylene (PP), 25 polyethylene (PE), polycarbonate (PC), polyamides (PA) and/or polyethylene terephthalate (PETE), polyvinylchloride (PVC); and polystyrene (PS).<br>

For example the container may have handle or a part with such dimensions to allow easy lifting or carrying the container with one hand. The container preferably has a means suitable for 15 pouring the liquid detergent composition and means for<br>
reclosing the container. The pouring means may be of any size of form but, preferably will be wide enough for convenient dosing the liquid detergent composition. The closing means may be of any form or size but usually will be screwed or clicked 20 on the container to close the container. The closing means may be cap which can be detached from the container. Alternatively, the cap can still be attached to the container, whether the container is open or closed. The closing means may also be incorporated in the container. 25<br>
METHOD OF USING COMPOSITIONS<br>
In use, the indicated quantity of the composition (generally in the range from 50 to 200 ml) depending on the size of the 30 laundry load, the size and type of the washing machine, is<br>
added to the washing machine which also contains water and the soiled laundry. The inventive compositions are particularly suited for use with front-loading washing machine, due to the<br><br>
WO 2007/039026	PCTYEP2006/008423<br>
28<br>
ability of the inventive compositions to deliver high performance with low foaming - front-loading machines require low foaming compositions.<br>

EXAMPLE   1   AND  COMPARATIVE   EXAMPLE  A<br>
5 Example 1 (within the scope of the present invention) and Comparative Example A (outside the scope of the present invention) demonstrated the effect of free radical scavenger in slowing down the hydrolysis speed of the MEE relative to Comparative Example A. Water and Borax were added to the main 10 mix to form a clear solution, Premix 1 was prepared for Example 1 by dissolving BHT in MEE., followed by the addition of MEE for Comparative Example A and Premix 1 for Example 1 to the main mix. At last the preservative Kathon was added. The final pH values of the batches were about 9.27. The pH values after 3 15 month storage at 52°C were listed in Table 1.<br><br>

borax, TEA, and citric acid were then added to the main mix to form a clear solution. Followed by the addition of Premix 2. After the neutralization, SLES was added and followed by the addition of Premix 1. The rest of the ingredients, such as fluorescer, functional polymers, perfume, enzyme, colorant, preservatives were added at the last stage and mixed until the batch became an isotropic liquid.<br>
MPEG and fatty acid were added to comparative Examples B-D to simulate the product containing degraded MEE, these examples are analogous to Example A, which resulted on actual storage. The results that were obtained are summarised in Table 2.<br>

Comparative Examples B, C and D in Table 2 show the formulations, which were equivalent to the compositions without a radial scavenger after various periods of storage (i.e., Example A). MEE in these formulations was hydrolyzed and generated MPEG and fatty acid. Their detergency performance dropped considerably as shown on the detergency of AS10 and PC9 test clothes.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 AND COMPARABLE EXAMPLES E AND F<br>
Example 3 illustrates the criticality of mole ratio of the alkoxylated ester surfactant to the free radical scavanger. Example 3 (within the scope of the present invention) and Comparative Examples E and F (outside the scope of present invention) in Table 3 were prepared by following the procedure described in Example 1. The results that were obtained are summarised in Table 3.<br>

As shown in Table3, Example 3, with BHT level of 0.1 and MEE to BHT ratio of 36:1 has shown the colour stability after one month of storage at room temperature. On the other hand, the comparative examples E and F, which have BHT level higher than 5 0.2 and MEE:BHT less than 20, have turned to yellow under the same storage condition.<br><br>
