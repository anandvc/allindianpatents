Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method of preparing bisrruth oxide and an<br>
apparatus therefor. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of<br>
preparing bisrruth oxide by melting metal bismuth at a low temperature, stirring the<br>
melted bismuth in an open reactor at 300 - 650°C, and oxidizing the obtained product<br>
in a closed reactor by supplying oxygen, and an apparatus therefor.<br>
Bismuth oxide generally refers to bismuth trioxide (Bi2O3 ) having high electric con-<br>
ductivity, and is used variously for disinfectant, magnet, glass, gum, anti-flame paper,<br>
catalyst and so on. Accordingly, demand of bismuth oxide is increasing, and especially<br>
demand for bisrnuth oxide with high-purity is increasing in the electronic industry.<br>
Bismuth oxide is classified into 4 isomer types of α-type, β-type, y-type, and S-type<br>
according to its crystal structure, and a-bismuth oxide is generally used in the industry.<br>
Background Art<br>
Bismuth oxide is conventionally prepared by one of the following methods:<br>
oxidizing fine powder bismuth by burning bismuth or injecting it into a heated zone<br>
(Patent Reference 1); dissolving metal bismuth in sodium nitrate by heating and<br>
passing chlorine gas (Patent Reference 2); neutralizing aqueous solution of bismuth<br>
nitrate with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, and precipitating the<br>
neutralized solution at 40 - 70X to obtain needle-crystalline bismuth oxide (Patent<br>
Reference 3); obtaining bismuth mono:carboxylic acid complex in an aqueous solution<br>
by adding mono-carboxylic acid to trivalent bisrruth ions, further precipitating the<br>
complex by adding an alkali in an aqueous solution, and separating the complex from<br>
the solution, and obtaining fine spherical bismuth oxide particles by firing the<br>
separated the ccmplex(Patent Reference 4); vaporizing bismuth by heating at a high<br>
temperature, and supplying air to the vaporized bismuth (Patent Reference 5);<br>
obtaining bismuth nitrate solution by adding nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide to<br>
bismuth metal grains or powder, separating the precipitant by adding sodium<br>
hydroxide to the solution and heating, and washing, drying, classifying the separated<br>
precipitant ,and obtaining bismuth oxide. (Non-patent Reference 1); oxidizing fine<br>
particle metal bisrruth by injecting air and heating at 850 - 900oC (Non-patent<br><br>
Reference 1); and other methods such as oxidizing metal bismuth at 750 - 800°C,<br>
pyrolyzing bismuth carbonate, and adding alkaline metal hydroxide to bismuth salt<br>
solution (Non-patent Reference 2).<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
In the prior art, although Patent Reference 1 does not disclose the temperatures of<br>
melting and oxidizing bismuth. Referring to Non-patent References 1 and 2, this<br>
reaction is supposed to be executed at 750 - 900oC. However, a method of performing<br>
a reaction at a high temperature requires a high energy cost, and a final product<br>
prepared according to the method may lose competitiveness in the market.<br>
The methods of preparing bismuth oxide by using a bismuth salt, such as bismuth<br>
nitrate, according to the Patent References 3 and 4 must be performed in two steps of<br>
preparing bismuth nitrate and obtaining bismuth oxide from the prepared bismuth<br>
nitrate, whose process is complicated and not economical. In the case of preparing<br>
bismuth oxide from purchased bismuth nitrate, the price of bismuth nitrate is high and<br>
bismuth nitrate is not easily available. Therefore it may result in a high production<br>
cost.<br>
Further in a wet process of the Patent References 3 and 4, by-products must be<br>
eliminated by washing after separation of bismuth oxide. Therefore, this process may<br>
cause environmental pollution, and water treatment cost of washing and reaction<br>
effluent is high. Further, operating environment of the process is inferior and small<br>
amount of residual acids contained in the prepared bismuth oxide may deteriorate<br>
quality of the bismuth oxide. Therefore, it cannot meet requirement of high-purity<br>
bismuth oxide.<br><br>
A method of preparing bismuth oxide according to the Patent Reference 5 utilizes a<br>
vapor-phase reaction and requires high energy consumption, long processing time and<br>
precision facilities. Further, the particle size of prepared bismuth oxide is extremely<br>
fine (equivalent to several nanometers). Therefore, manufacturing and maintenance<br>
costs of high temperature resistant filters used for collection of the prepared fine<br>
bismuth oxide are very high, and thereby a production facility of this method becomes<br>
expensive and uneconomical.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and the present<br>
invention provides a method of preparing high-purity abismuth oxide with a high yield<br>
by melting bismuth metal ingot at a temperature higher than 300°C (preferably at 400 -<br>
450°C), transporting the melted bismuth metal to a first reactor that is open to air,<br>
oxidizing bismuth while stirring at the temperature at 300 - 650°C, collecting bismuth<br>
oxide in a collecting tank having an exhaust fan, and reacting the collected bismuth<br>
oxide with oxygen again in a second reactor at 300 - 600°C.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
According to the present invention, high-purity α bismuth oxide may be prepared<br>
economically by melting metal bismuth at a temperature near the melting point of<br>
bismuth, which is much lower than a conventional condition (700°C or higher),<br>
oxidizing the melted bismuth, and oxidizing the bismuth oxide again at a relatively low<br>
temperature of 300 - 650°C in air or oxygen gas environment.<br>
Ah apparatus for preparing high-purity bismuth oxide according to the present<br>
invention has advantages of simple operation, high efficiency, and easy maintenance,<br>
because bismuth oxide obtained from a first reactor is collected by a collecting device<br>
having an exhaust fan and un-reacted bismuth is oxidized again by a second reactor in<br>
air or oxygen gas environment.<br>
Further, in the apparatus for preparing high-purity bismuth oxide according to the<br>
present invention, the production rate of bismuth oxide may be controlled by installing<br>
a storage tank between the collecting tank and second reactor.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described in detail<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic view showing a configuration of an apparatus for preparing<br>
bismuth oxide according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 2<br>
is an enlarged sectional view showing a detailed structure of a first reactor in the<br>
apparatus of FIG. 1, and FIG. 3 is an enlarged sectional view showing a detailed<br>
structure of a second reactor in the apparatus of FIG. 1.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the apparatus for preparing bismuth oxide includes: a melting<br>
tank 110 for melting metal bismuth at a high temperature; an open first reactor 120<br>
having an internal impeller 121 driven by a motor 122 for primary oxidation of the<br>
melted metal bismuth; a collecting device 130 having an exhaust fan 134 for collecting<br>
bismuth oxide in the first reactor 120 by using differential pressure; a closed second<br>
reactor 150 having an internal screw driven by a motor 151 and an oxygen inlet for<br>
secondary oxidation of the bismuth oxide collected by the collecting device 130; and a<br>
pulverizer 160 for pulverizing the obtained fine powder bismuth oxide.<br>
The melting tank 110 is a device for melting metal bismuth, and the temperature<br>
inside the melting tank 110 may be maintained at a temperature higher than the<br>
melting point of bismuth (27It!). However, the temperature inside the melting tank<br>
110 is preferably maintained at the temperature of '300oC or higher than 300°C for high<br>
reaction speed and productivity considering* that the temperature of the first reactor 120<br>
at 300--650°C;	<br>
In particular, the temperature inside the first reactor 120 is preferably maintained<br>
constantly by supplying hot air so that the hot air may contact with the surface of the<br>
melted bismuth supplied into the first reactor 120. When the melted bismuth is<br>
supplied into the first reactor 120, the hot air reduces scale formation at the inner wall<br>
of the first reactor 120 and at the shaft of the impeller 121, which is caused by a<br><br>
difference between the temperature of melted bismuth in the first reactor 120 and the<br>
temperature of melted bismuth supplied from the melting tank 110. The temperature of<br>
the hot air may be 200 - 450oC and is not particularly limited. However, the<br>
temperature of hot air is preferably 300-450°C.<br>
The first reactor 120 is controlled to maintain the reaction temperature at 300 - 600°C<br>
and primarily oxidizes the melted bismuth supplied from the melting tank 110. The<br>
melted bismuth in the first reactor 120 is oxidized while stirring with the impeller 121<br>
driven by the motor 122.<br>
The impeller 121 rotates on a vertical axis, and the distance between the lower<br>
surface of the impeller 121 and the bottom inner surface of the first reactor 120 is<br>
preferably set as small as possible. In a case that the distance between the lower<br>
surface of the impeller 121 and the bottom inner surface of the first reactor 120 is<br>
large, stirring is not sufficient, and un-yeacted bismuth may deposit on the bottom<br>
inner surface of the first reactor 120.<br>
The temperature inside the first reactor 120 is maintained constantly by supplying<br>
hot air so that the hot air may contact with the surface of the melted bismuth supplied<br>
into the first reactor 120. When the melted bismuth is supplied into the first reactor<br>
120,	the hot air reduces scale formation at the inner wall of the first reactor 120 and at<br>
the axis of the impeller 121, which is caused by a difference between the temperature<br>
of melted bismuth in the first reactor 120 and the temperature of melted bismuth<br>
supplied from the melting tank 110.<br>
Air or oxygen gas may be supplied into the first reactor 120 to accelerate oxidation<br>
of bismuth, as shown in FIG. 2. Referring to FIG. 2A, an injection pipe 122 is installed<br>
at a proper position in the first reactor 120 to supply air or oxygen gas from an air/<br>
oxygen supplier (not shown). The outlet of the injection pipe 122 is submerged in the<br>
melted bismuth such that the air or oxygen gas is directly injected into the melted<br>
bismuth.<br>
Alternatively, the injection pipe 122 may be installed inside the axis of the impeller<br>
121,	and air or oxygen gas may be injected through an inner space of the impeller 121,<br>
as shown in FIG. 2B. Accordingly, the structure of the first reactor 120 may be<br>
simplified, because the injection pipe 122 is not installed aside from the impeller 121<br>
in the first reactor 120. In this case, a powerful motor is necessary for driving the<br>
impeller 121, because a large amount of driving power is required for stirring of<br>
melted bismuth in the first reactor 120. <br>
The collecting device 130 is controlled to collect bismuth oxide formed in the first<br><br>
reactor 120, and includes a settling tank 131 for stabilizing bismuth oxide supplied<br>
from the first reactor 120, a cyclone 132 for circulating air to be sucked by an exhaust<br>
fan 134 and generating air turbulence, and a collecting tank 133 having an exhaust fan<br>
134 for collecting bismuth oxide. Further, a screw 135 for transporting bismuth oxide<br>
is installed at the bottom of the settling tank 131, cyclone 132 and collecting tank 133.<br>
The collecting device 130 works as follows:<br>
If the exhaust fan 134 is driven, the pressure inside the collecting tank 133 is dra-<br>
matically reduced, and air of the first reactor 120 flows towards the collecting tank 133<br>
through the settling tank 131 and cyclone 132. Accordingly, differential pressure is<br>
formed in the first reactor 120.<br>
The air turbulence generated by the cyclone 132; accelerates airflow speed, and<br>
thereby the differential pressure in the first reactor 120 can be increased quickly.<br>
According to the differential pressure generated in the first reactor 120, bismuth<br>
oxide having a smaller specific gravity than metal bismuth flows towards the settling<br>
tank 131 of the collecting device 130, seme stabilized bismuth oxide particles fall<br>
down and are transported by the screw 135. Seme bismuth oxide particles collided<br>
with the inner wall of the cyclone 132 by a centrifugal force fall down along the inner<br>
wall of the cyclone 132 and are transported by the screw 135. The remaining bismuth<br>
oxide particles move into the collecting tank 133, and are finally collected by the<br>
screw 135 and transported to the next device.<br>
As bismuth oxide formed in the fust reactor 120 moves towards the collecting device<br>
130 and the account of bismuth in the first reactor 120 is reduced, the load of the motor<br>
122 driving the impeller 121 is also reduced: Accordingly, a feeding rate of melted<br>
bismuth to the first reactor 120 may be controlled by detecting the load of the motor<br>
122, and the amount of reacted and un-reacted bismuth in the first reactor 120 may be<br>
maintained properly all the time.<br>
The storage tank 140 stores bismuth oxide transported by the screw 135. If<br>
necessary, a filtering process may be added to remove impurities frcm the transported<br>
bismuth oxide.<br>
Bismuth oxide particles exhausted from the collecting device 130 may directly be<br>
transported to the closed second reactor 150 without passing through the storage tank<br>
\ 40, as shown by a dotted line in FIG. 1. The storage tank 140 is an optional item in<br>
the present invention.<br>
The closed second reactor 150 is controlled to oxidize again reactant oxidized in the<br>
first reactor 120 and performs oxidization of an un-reacted material (residual bismuth)<br><br>
by using a screw (not shown) driven by the motor 151 in an closed tank while<br>
maintaining the temperature at 300°C -. 600°C<br>
Further, rapid oxidation may be induced by supplying oxygen gas into the closed<br>
second reactor 150. The pressure of the oxygen gas supplied to the closed second<br>
reactor 120 may differ according to a condition of the second reactor 150. If pure<br>
oxygen is supplied at the pressure of 1 - 2.5 Kgf/cm2 , rapid oxidation may be achieved<br>
without using the closed second reactor for high-pressure.<br>
The closed second reactor 150 may be installed by using an eccentric axis, as shown<br>
in FIG. 3, to accelerate the oxidation in the second reactor 150. That is, if a center axis<br>
153 of the closed second reactor 150 is installed eccentrically to a driving axis 152 of a<br>
motor 151, oxidation may be accelerated by a shaking effect while the closed second<br>
reactor 150 is rotating.<br>
The pulverizer 160 pulverizes the bismuth oxide oxidized in the closed second<br>
reactor 150. A filtering process may be added prior to a pulverizing process to remove<br>
impurities from bismuth oxide.<br>
Mode for the Invention <br>
Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described in detail<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings. However, the present invention is not<br>
limited to the described exemplary embodiments.<br>
Example 1 (Primary Oxidation)<br>
Bismuth metal ingot having the purity of 99.99% at temperature of 400 - 450°C was<br>
continuously supplied at a feeding rate of 45kg/hr to the melting tank 110 having the<br>
capacity of 1 m while maintaining the temperature at 300 - 400°C. The temperature of<br>
the first reactor 120 having the capacity of 300 liter to which hot air is supplied was<br>
maintained at 300°C. The impeller 121 was driven at the speed of 50 -100 rpm. The<br>
suction differential pressure at settling tank 131 or cyclone 132 was maintained at<br>
20mm H2O by an exhaust fan connected to the collecting tank 130. Melted bismuth<br>
was transported to the first reactor 120 at the feeding rate of 45 Kg/hr and oxidized<br>
while Stirling with the impeller 121.<br>
The above procedure was repeated by changing the temperature of the first reactor<br>
120 to 350,400,450, 500,550, 600, and 650°C. Before transporting to the collecting<br>
device 130, samples of the reactant were collected to measure the contents of un-<br>
reacted bismuth in the samples. The result of the measurement is shown in percentages<br>
in Table 1.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
The same method as Example 1 was performed in Example 2 except that bismuth<br>
metal ingot was supplied at the feeding rate of 30 Kg/hr. The weights of un-reacted<br>
bismuth in collected samples were measured, and the result is shown in percentages in<br>
Table 1.<br><br>
Table 1 shows that the degree of oxidation increases as the reaction temperature<br>
increases. However, it was observed that aggregation of reactant is induced at a<br>
temperature higher than 650°C. It was also observed that the degree of oxidation<br>
decreases as the feeding rate of the raw material increases, because retention time of<br>
the raw material in the reactor decreases. In contrast, it was observed that the degree of<br>
oxidation increases as a feeding rate of the raw material decreases. Accordingly, the<br>
capacities of the reactor and the corresponding heating medium must be increased to<br>
increase the feeding rate of the raw material.<br>
In the above examples, oxidation may be performed at 300 - 350°C, but it takes long<br>
time to complete the reaction because the degree of oxidation is as low as 25 - 50%.<br>
Accordingly, oxidation is preferably performed at 450 - 650°C. If the feeding rate of<br>
melted bismuth is slow, the oxidation speed increases, because the load of the motor<br>
driving the impeller becomes low and the contact surface of bismuth for reacting with<br><br>
oxygen in the air is increased.<br>
Example 3<br>
Reaction product obtained from the first reactor 120 at the reaction temperature of<br>
650°C and containing 0.04% un-reacted bismuth according to Example 2 was<br>
transported through the settling tank 131, cyclone 132 and collecting tank 133. Heavy<br>
particles transported through lower hoppers of the (settling tank 131 and cyclone 132<br>
were transported by the screw 135. Light particles transported to the collecting tank<br>
133 were also transported by the screw 135. The heavy and light particles on the screw<br>
135 were transported to the storage tank 140 or directly to the closed second reactor<br>
150. The temperature of the closed second reactor 150 (capacity: 1 m!) was maintained<br>
at 450°C. The second reactor 150 was rotated for 30 rrin at a speed of 3 rpm while<br>
injecting oxygen gas at the pressure of 2 Kgf/cm . Samples of the reactant were<br>
collected at 5,10, 20, and 30 min after starting (he reaction. The contents of un-reacted<br>
bismuth in the collected samples were measured to check reaction rates, and the result<br>
is shown in Table 2.<br>
Example 4<br>
The same method as Example 3 was performed except that reaction product obtained<br>
from the first reactor 120 at the reaction temperature of 500°C and containing 0.87%<br>
un-feacted bismuth according to Example 2 was used. The contents of un-reacted<br>
bismuth in collected samples were measured to check reaction rates, and the result is<br>
shown in Table 2.<br>
Example 5<br>
The same method as Example 3 was performed except that reaction product obtained<br>
from the first reactor 120 at the reaction temperature of 450°C and containing 2.8% un-<br>
reacted bismuth according to Example 2 was used. The contents of un-reacted bismuth<br>
in collected samples were measured to check reaction rates, and the result is shown in<br>
Table 2.<br>
Example 6<br>
The same method as Example 3 was performed except that reaction product obtained<br>
frcm the first reactor 120 at the reaction temperature of 500oC and containing 8.4% un-<br>
reacted bismuth according to Example 1 was used. The contents of un-reacted bismuth<br><br>
in collected samples were measured to check reaction rates, and the result is shown in<br>
Table 2.<br>
Comparative Examples 1-4<br>
Comparative Examples 1 - 4 were prepared in the same methods as Examples 3-6<br>
respectively except that oxygen gas was not injected. The contents of un-reacted<br>
bismuth in collected samples were measured to check reaction rates, and the result is<br>
shown in Table 2.<br><br>
Table 2 shows un-reacted bismuth contents (%) corresponding to the elapsed reaction<br><br>
time in the condition of stirring the closed second reactor 150 where the secondary<br>
oxidation occurs with supply of oxygen gas at the pressure of 2 Kgf/cm2 and in the<br>
condition of stirring in a closed state without supply of oxygen gas. All the un-reacted<br>
bismuth contents after the secondary oxidation with oxygen injection show 0.005%. In<br>
contrast, un-reacted bismuth contents after the secondary oxidation without oxygen<br>
injection (Comparative Examples 3 - 4) show much higher percentages.<br>
Example 7<br>
The same method as Example 3 was performed except that reaction product obtained<br>
frcm the first reactor 120 at the reaction temperature of 650°C and containing 0.04%<br>
un-reacted bismuth according to Example 2 was supplied to the second reactor 150<br>
while maintaining the temperature at 500°C and oxygen gas was injected for 20 min at<br>
the pressures of 1 Kgf/cm2 and 2.5 Kgf/cm2. The contents of un-reacted bismuth in<br>
collected samples were measured to check reaction rates, and the result is shown in<br>
Table 3.<br><br>
Referring to Table 3, it is identified that the oxidation rate in the second reactor<br>
depends on a feeding rate of oxygen.)<br>
Example 8<br>
To test an oxidation efficiency in the second reactor 150, reaction product obtained<br>
from the first reactor 120 at reaction temperature of 500°C and containing 0.87% un-<br>
reacted bismuth according to Example 2 was continuously supplied to the second<br>
reactor 150 and oxidized for 20 min by. supplying oxygen gas at the pressure of 2 Kgf/<br>
cm2 and by changing the reaction temperature to 300, 400,450,500, 550, and 600°C.<br>
The contents of un-reacted bismuth in collected samples were measured to check<br>
reaction rates, and the result is shown in Table 4.<br>
Table 4<br><br><br>
Referring to Table 4, the reaction temperature of the second reactor 150 is preferably<br>
400 - 600°C, and more preferably 450 - 600°C when considering economical<br>
efficiency.<br>
Comparative Example 5<br>
The same method as Example 1 was performed for 8 hours a day except that hot air<br>
is not supplied. Scale formed on the inner wall of the first reactor 120 was measured<br>
after 7, 15, and 30 days. The result is shown in Table 5.<br><br>
As shown in Table 5, in the case that hot air is not injected, scale was formed sig-<br>
nificantly after 7 days, and after 15 days, the first reactor 120 reached a state that it can<br>
be operated no longer without cleaning the scale. In the case that hot air is supplied,<br>
the thickness of scale was only 11 rrm after 30 days. Therefore, if hot air is supplied.<br><br>
the reaction system may operate efficiently by cleaning the scale deposited in the inner<br>
wall of the first reactor once a month..<br>
Experimental Example 1<br>
An X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to identify a crystal structure of bisrmuth oxide<br>
obtained in the above examples.<br>
α-bismuth oxide (Aldrich, Purity 99.999%) was ased as a reference material.<br>
Sample 1 was prepared in a condition that melted bismuth was supplied to an open<br>
first reactor at a reaction temperature of 450°C and at a feeding rate of 40 Kg/hr while<br>
maintaining suction floating pressure at 15rrm H2O and stirring with an impeller.<br>
Sample 2 was prepared in a condition that melted bisrmuth was supplied to the open<br>
first reactor at a reaction temperature of 500°C and at a feeding rate of 40 Kg/hr while<br>
maintaining suction floating pressure at 15mm H2O and stirring with the impeller.<br>
Sample 3 was prepared in a condition that melted bismuth was supplied to the first<br>
reactor at a reaction temperature of 550°C and at a feeding rate of 20 Kg/hr while<br>
maintaining suction floating pressure at 10mri H2O and stirring with the impeller.<br><br>
Sample 4 was prepared in a condition that melted bismuth was supplied to the first<br>
reactor at a reaction temperature of 450°C and at the feeding rate of 40 Kg/hr while<br>
maintaining suction floating pressure at 15mm H2 O and stirring with the impeller, and<br><br>
then the primarily oxidized bismuth was oxidized in a second reactor at 500°C while<br>
supplying oxygen gas at the pressure 1 Kgf/cm.<br>
The above samples and the reference material of abismuth oxide were measured by<br>
an X-ray diffraction, and the result is shown in FIG. 4. All the above samples showed<br>
the same peak points as those of the reference material.<br>
Experimental Example 2<br>
The same method as preparing sample 4 in Experimental Example 1 was performed<br>
except that the reaction temperature of the second reactor was maintained at 450°C.<br>
Collected samples were measured by the X-ray diffraction in the same method as Ex-<br>
perimental Example 1, arid the result is shown in FIG. 5.<br>
According to Experimental Examples 1 and 2, all the bismuth oxides prepared<br>
according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention were identified to be<br>
an α-type.	<br><br>
