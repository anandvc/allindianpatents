				<td>This invention relates to an improved process fo-r the production of silver based brazing alloy . for use as filler (joining) material.<br>
The silver based brasing alloy produced by the process of present, invention will be useful in brazing steel, copper, brass, gun metal, tin bronze, aluminium and manganese bronzes, silver based contact alloys, copper nickel alloy and nickel silver of all types  in electrical and other industries.<br>
The relevant existing process for the production of the conventional silver based brasing alloy (Ag-42 to 44%, Cu-15 to 17%, Zn-18 to 22 and Cd-20 to 22 ) involves melting, casting, heat treatment and processing to foils/wires with intermediate annealing.<br>
The loss of the alloying elements in the existing process such as sine and cadmium is high (Zn-10 loss, Cd-15 loss) during melting of the alloy. Apart from these there are wide differences in melting points and densities between the alloying additions as given below, causing problems in homogeneous mixing in the melt.<br>
Element   Melting point (°C )   Density (g/cm )<br>
Ag	961	10.50<br>
Cu	1083	8.94<br>
Zn	419	7.13<br>
Cd	321	8.64<br>
Moreover, the homogenisation heat treatment procedure of the cast slab/ ingot in the existing process is lengthy (24 hrs) causing involvement of higher electrical energy and maapower. This results in high cost of production of the said alloy in the existing process.<br>
In our co-pending application ( 435/D/90) we have disclosed a process for making low silver brazing filler alloy having a composition range of silver-30 to 40% , silicon-2.75 to 4.25, tin-0.15 to 0.25% and balance copper wherein the melting of the alloy was done in an electric pot-type furnace using a graphite crucible and was poured in a preheated (150 to 200°C) graphite mould at about 900 to 950°C. The cast slabs were given cold reduction of 20 to 25% and then homogenised at 500 to 550°C for 4 to 8 hours. The homogenised slabs were processed to thin sheets by rolling. However, its use is restricted to electronic and vacuum tube industries only. As this alloy does not contain any volatile elements such as cadmium, sine etc. which is an important factor for use in Vacuum tube and Electronic Industries.<br>
Therefore, further R &amp; D work was carried out to develop an alloy for useful general purpose having a composition . range of Ag-40 to 44, Cu-15 to 17, Zn-18 to 22, Cd-20 to 22. The alloy produced by the present invention is useful for brazing steel, copper, brass, gun metal bronzes, silver based contact alloys, copper nickel alloys and nickel silver of all types and takes much shorter time through thermomechanical treatment and produces a filler material that possesses better or equivalent brazing properties to those produced by the existing processes.<br>
In the process of present invention the aforesaid problems are overcome by adopting appropriate melting schedule like sequence of charging of alloying elements, controlling melting and pouring temperatures , using suitable flux (borax based) to minimise the the loss of Zn and Cd metals during melting and by thermomechanical treatment to reduce the heat treatment time from 24 hours to 8 hours.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the production of silver brazing alloy for use as filler (joining) material by overcoming the above mentioned drawbacks associated with the existing processes.<br>
In the process of the present invention copper is first melted alongwith silver in a resistance furnace using clay bonded graphite crucible and preheated Zn and Cd metals are added to the molten alloy. Sufficient flux is added to cover the molten surface to prevent oxidation. A cold reduction of 20% is given to the cast ingot prior to homogenisation heat treatment to reduce the time period and then the heat-treated ingot is processed to thin sheets/wires for final use. The beneficial effect of initial cold reduction in improving the kinetics of homogenisation may be under stood on the basis of the reduction in the effective diffusion distances which, in turn lowers the relaxation time. The homogenised slabs are then processed into thin sheets (0.5 to 0.15 mm thickness) by cold rolling, limiting to 20 to 25% reduction prior to each cycle of reduction to avoid cracking.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides,   an improved process for the production of silver<br>
based brazing alloy useful as filler material which comprises:<br>
i)	melting of Ag and Cu in the temperature range of 950 to 1000°C to get a Ag - Cu alloy in<br>
the range of Ag-42 to 44% and Cu -15 to 17%,<br>
ii)	adding preheated Zn and Cd metals in the range of 18 to 22% and 20 to 22% respectively<br>
to the molten Ag-Cu alloy in the temperature range of 800 to 820°C, to get a composition in<br>
the range of Zn-18 to 22% and Cd-20 to 22%, iii)        covering the surface of the melt with a flux such as borax and the like during melting, iv)       pouring the melt in a preheated steel mould in the temperature range of 700 to 750°C, v)        processing the cast slab for cold reduction in the range of 20 to 25%, vi)       homogenising the cold reduced slab for a period of 6 to 8 hours in the temperature range of<br>
400 to 460°C in an electric furnace followed by air cooling and<br>
vii) cold rolling of the homogenised slab into thin sheet in the range of 0.05 to 0.15 mm thickness with intermediate annealing, limiting to 20 - 25% reduction prior to each cycle of cold reduction.<br>
According to a feature of the invention Ag, Cu, Zn and Cd metals employed for making the alloy may be of high purity (99.99%). Melting of Ag, Cu, Zn and Cd may be done in an electric resistance furnace using clay bonded graphite crucible and casting in steel mould. Heat treatment may be done in muffle furnace and the reduction of the ingot by cold rolling. Annealing may be done after each cycle of cold reduction at a temperature range of 400 to 420 C for a period of 1 to 2 hrs.<br>
The novelty of the process of the present invention lies in the achievement of better mechanical and physical properties compared to those produced by the existing process ( Tables I,II and III). Further the cost of production of the present invention has been reduced (30 to 40%) due to the reduction of heat treatment time from 24 hours to 8 hours and also the final yield is increased due to the reduction of oxidation of Zn and Cd metals during melting by adopting appropriate melting technique and using suitable flux.<br>
By the process of present invention silver brasing alloy is produced having solidus and liquidus temperatures in the range of 610 to 620°C and also the loss of Zn and Cd metals has been brought down to the level of 5% and 7% respectively against 10% of Zn and 15% of Cd metals in the existing process. The wetting properties (Table III) are comparable to those produced by the existing process..<br><br>
