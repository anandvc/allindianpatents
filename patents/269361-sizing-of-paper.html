				<td>SIZING OF PAPER<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to sizing of paper and more specifically to aqueous<br>
dispersions of cellulose-reactive sizing agent and their preparation and use.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Cellulose-reactive sizing agents such as those based on alkenyl succinic anhydride (ASA)<br>
are widely used in papermaking at neutral or slightly alkaline stock pH's in order to give<br>
paper and paper board some degree of resistance to wetting and penetration by aqueous<br>
liquids. Paper sizes based on cellulose-reactive sizing agents are generally provided in the<br>
form of dispersions containing an aqueous phase and finely divided particles or droplets of<br>
the sizing agent dispersed therein. The dispersions are usually prepared with the aid of a<br>
dispersant system consisting of an anionic compound, e.g. sodium lignosulfonate, in<br>
combination with a high molecular weight amphoteric or cationic polymer, e.g. cationic<br>
starch, polyamine, polyamideamine or a vinyl addition polymer.<br>
WO 96/17127 discloses aqueous dispersions which comprise a cellulose-reactive sizing<br>
agent and colloidal anionic aluminium-modified silica particles.<br>
WO 97/31152 discloses aqueous dispersions which comprise a reactive size and an anionic<br>
microparticulate material. The dispersions may also contain not more than 2% (by weight<br>
based on the weight of the reactive size) of surfactant. The surfactant can be non-ionic or<br>
anionic.<br>
WO 98/33979 A1 discloses an aqueous dispersion of cellulose-reactive sizing agent and a<br>
dispersant system comprising a cationic organic compound and an anionic stabilizer.<br>
Despite the fact that considerable improvements have been achieved in the preparation,<br>
properties and performance of aqueous dispersions of alkenyl succinic anhydride, there are<br>
still some technical problems associated with the use of such dispersions. Usually,<br>
dispersions of alkenyl succinic anhydride exhibit poor stability, which evidently leads to diffi-<br>
culties in handling the dispersions, for example on storage and in use. One further drawback<br>
is that the aqueous dispersions cannot be stored for longer periods of time, because alkenyl<br>
succinic anhydride hydropses easily and thereby becomes ineffective as a sizing agent.<br><br>
Therefore, the alkenyl succinic anhydride is usually delivered to paper mills as a liquid,<br>
which is then dispersed prior to its use as a sizing agent and the dispersion obtained is<br>
usually used within 2 hours to avoid the problems of insufficient stability and Joss of sizing<br>
efficiency. The equipment used to prepare the dispersions provides high shear forces to be<br>
able to set surfaces free and produce dispersions having adequate particle size. Such<br>
equipment is often both complicated and expensive, and due to the high shear forces<br>
usually requires a considerable amount of energy.<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide an aqueous dispersion of cellulose-reactive sizing<br>
agent which can be easily prepared using low shear forces and low energy consumption.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to provide an aqueous dispersion of cellulose-reactive<br>
sizing agent showing improved stability and sizing efficiency. Further objects will appear<br>
hereinafter.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to an aqueous dispersion of cellulose-reactive sizing agent<br>
containing an acid anhydride, an anionic polyelectrolyte and a nitrogen-containing organic<br>
compound which is an amine or quaternary ammonium thereof having a molecular weight<br>
less than 180 and/or having one or more hydroxyl groups.<br>
The invention further relates to a method for the preparation of an aqueous dispersion of<br>
cellulose-reactive sizing agent which comprises dispersing an acid anhydride in an<br>
aqueous phase in the presence of an anionic polyelectrolyte and a nitrogen-containing<br>
organic compound which is an amine or quaternary ammonium thereof having a<br>
molecular weight less than 180 and/or having one or more hydroxy) groups.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of the aqueous dispersion of cellulose-reactive sizing<br>
agent as a stock sizing agent or surface sizing agent in the production of paper The<br>
invention further relates to a process for the production of paper which comprises adding<br>
the aqueous dispersion of cellulose-reactive sizing agent to an aqueous cellulosic<br>
suspension and dewatering the obtained suspension on a wire as well as a process for<br>
the production of paper which comprises applying the aqueous dispersion of cellulose-<br>
reactive sizing agent to a cellulosic web.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In accordance with the present invention it has been found that improved sizing of paper<br>
can be achieved by using the present aqueous dispersion of cellulose-reactive sizing<br>
agent. It has also been found that the present dispersions show better stability over<br>
conventional dispersions. Furthermore, it has been found that lower shear forces can be<br>
used to prepare the present aqueous dispersions compared to when preparing conventional<br>
aqueous dispersions of cellulose-reactive sizing agent. Hereby the present invention<br>
makes it possible to use simple and energy and investment saving equipment creating<br>
low shear forces, such as for example static mixers. The present invention thus offers<br>
substantial economical and technical benefits.<br>
The cellulose-reactive sizing agent according to the invention can be selected from any<br>
acid anhydride-based sizing agent known in the art. Suitably, the sizing agent is a<br>
hydrophobic acid anhydride. Suitable hydrophobic acid anhydrides can be characterized by<br>
the general formula (I) below, wherein R1 and R2 are independently selected from saturated<br>
or unsaturated hydrocarbon groups which suitably contain from 8 to 30 carbon atoms, or R1<br>
and R2 together with the -C-O-C- moiety can form a 5 to 6 membered ring, optionally being<br>
further substituted with hydrocarbon groups containing up to 30 carbon atoms.<br><br>
Examples of suitable acid anhydrides include alkyI and alkenyl succinic anhydrides, e.g. iso-<br>
octadecenyl succinic anhydride, iso-octadecyl succinic anhydride, n-hexadecenyl succinic<br>
anhydride, dodecenyl succinic anhydride, decenyl succinic anhydride, octenyl succinic<br>
anhydride, tri-isobutenyl succinic anhydride, 1-octyl-2-decenyl-succinic anhydride and 1-<br>
hexyl-2-octenyl-succinic anhydride. Examples of suitable acid anhydrides further include the<br>
compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,102,064; 3,821,069; 3,968,005; 4,040,900;<br>
4,522,686; and Re. 29,960, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The cellulose-reactive sizing agent according to the invention may contain one or more acid<br>
anhydrides, e.g. one or more alkyl and/or alkenyl succinic anhydrides. Usually, the acid<br>
anhydride of this invention is liquid at room temperature.<br>
The dispersion according to the invention contains a dispersant, or dispersant system,<br>
comprising an anionic polyelectrolyte and a nitrogen-containing organic compound. When<br>
used in combination, these compounds are effective as a dispersant for the acid anhydride<br><br>
sizing agent although the anionic polyeledrolyte and nitrogen-containing organic compound<br>
may not be effective as a dispersant when used singly. Preferably, the dispersion is anionic,<br>
i.e. the dispersant, or dispersant system, has an overall anionic charge.<br>
The anionic polyeledrolyte according to the invention can be selected from organic and<br>
inorganic compounds and it can be derived from natural or synthetic sources. The anionic<br>
polyelectrolyte has two or more anionic groups which can be of the same or different types.<br>
Examples of suitable anionic groups, i.e. groups that are anionic or rendered anionic in an<br>
aqueous phase, include silanol, aiuminosilicate, phosphate, phosphonate, sulphate,<br>
sulphonate, sulphonic and carboxylic acid groups as well as salts thereof, usually<br>
ammonium or alkali metal (generally sodium) salts. The anionic polyelectrolytes may be<br>
water-soluble, e.g. linear and branched anionic polyelectrolytes, or water-dispersable, e.g.<br>
cross-linked and/or particulate anionic polyelectrolytes. Preferably, the water-dispersable<br>
and particulate anionic polyelectrolytes are colloidal, i.e. in the colloidal range of particle<br>
size. The colloidal particles suitably have a particle size from 1 nm to 100 nm, preferably<br>
from 2 to 70 nm and most preferably from 2 to 40 nm. The water-dispersable and particulate<br>
anbnic polyelectrolytes may contain aggregated and/or non-aggregated particles.<br>
Examples of suitable organic anionic polyelectrolytes include anionic polysaccharides like<br>
starches, guar gums, celluloses, chitins, chitosans, glycans, galactans, glucans, xanthan<br>
gums, mannans, and dextrins. Further examples of suitable organic anionic potyetectrolytes<br>
include synthetic anionic polymers such as condensation polymers, e.g. polyurethanes and<br>
naphthalene-based and melamine-based polymers, e.g. condensated formaldehyde<br>
naphthalene sulfonates and polymers based on melamine-sulfonic acid, and vinyl addition<br>
polymers prepared from ethylenically unsaturated monomers including anionic or potentially<br>
anionic monomers, e.g. acrylic acid, methacylic acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid, crotonic<br>
acid, vinylsutfonic acid, sulfonated styrene and phosphates of hydroxyalkyl acrylaies and<br>
methacrylates, optionally copolymerized with non-ionic ethylenically unsaturated monomers,<br>
e.g. acrylamide, alkyl acrylates, styrene and acrylonitrile as well as derivatives of such<br>
monomers, vinyl esters, and the like.<br>
Examples of further suitable organic anionic polyelectrolytes include water-soluble branched<br>
polymers and water-dispersible crosslinked polymers obtained by polymerization of a<br>
monomer mixture comprising one or more ethylenically unsaturated anionic or potentially<br>
anionic monomers and, optionally, one or more other ethylenically unsaturated monomers,<br>
in the presence of one or more polyfunctional crosslinking agents. The presence of a<br>
polyfunctional crosslinking agent in the monomer mixture renders possible preparation of<br><br>
branched polymers, slightly crosslinked polymers and highly crosslinked polymers that are<br>
water-dispersible. Examples of suitable polyfunctions crosslinking agents inofude<br>
compounds having at least two ethylenically unsaturated bonds, e.g. N.N-methylene-bis-<br>
(meth)acrylamide, polyethyleneglycol di(meth)acrylate, N-vinyl (meth)acrylamide, divinyl-<br>
benzene, triallylammonium salts and N-methylallyl(meth)acrylamide; compounds having an<br>
ethylenically unsaturated bond and a reactive group, e.g. glycidyl (meth)acrylate, acrolein<br>
and methylol(meth)acrylamide; and compounds having at least two reactive groups, e.g.<br>
dialdehydes like glyoxal, diepoxy compounds and epichlorohydrin.<br>
The organic anionic polyelectrolyte usually has a degree of anionic substitution (DSA) from<br>
0.01 to 1.4, suitably from 0.1 to 1.2 and preferably from 0.2 to 1.0. The anionic<br>
polyelectrolyte may contain one or more cationic groups as long as it has an overall anionic<br>
charge. The molecular weight of the anionic polyelectrolyte can vary within wide ranges;<br>
usually the molecular weight is above 200 and suitably above 500, whereas the upper limit<br>
is usually 10 million and preferably 2 million.<br>
Examples of suitable inorganic anionic polyelectrolytes include anionic siliceous materials,<br>
e.g. anionic silica-based materials prepared from silicic acid and clays of the smectite type.<br>
Usually, these anionic polyelectrolytes have negative silanol, aluminosilicate or hydroxyl<br>
groups. Examples of suitable inorganic anionic polyelectrolytes include polysilicic acid,<br>
polysilicates, polyaluminiumsilicates, colloidal silica-based particles, e.g. particles of silica,<br>
aluminated (aluminium-modified) silica and aluminiumsilicate, polysilicate microgels,<br>
polyaluminiumsilicate microgels, silica gels and precipitated silica, smectite days, e.g.<br>
montmorillonite, bentonite, hectorite, beidelrte, nontronite and saponite. Preferred anionic<br>
polyelectrolytes include silica-based materials, e.g. colloidal silica-based particles.<br>
The nitrogen-containing organic compound according to the invention is an amine or<br>
quaternary ammonium thereof. Suitable nitrogen-containing organic compounds include<br>
primary, secondary and tertiary amines and quaternary ammoniums thereof. Suitable<br>
nitrogen-containing organic compounds further include monoamines, diamines and<br>
polyamines and quaternary ammoniums thereof. Suitable quaternary ammoniums include<br>
protonated, alkylated, arylated and alkarylated amines of the above-mentioned types, which<br>
can be formed by reaction of the amines with, for example, acids, e.g. hydrochloric acid, and<br>
methyl chloride, dimethyl sulphate and benzyl chloride. In a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, the nitrogen-containing organic compound is an amine or quaternary ammonium<br>
thereof having one or more hydroxyl groups. Preferably, one or more hydroxyl groups are<br><br>
present in a terminal position of one or more substituents of the nitrogen-containing<br>
compound, i.e. a hydroxyl gro"up terminated amine or quaternary ammonium thereof.	■'■■_<br>
Examples of suitable nitrogen-containing organic compounds include the following amines<br>
and their quaternary ammoniums: diethylene triamine, Methylene tetramine, hexamethylene<br>
diamine, diethyl amine, dipropyl amine, di-isopropyl amine, cyclohexylamine, pyrrolidine,<br>
guanidine, triethanol amine, monoethanol amine, diethanol amine, 2-methoxyethyl amine,<br>
aminoethylethanol amine, alanine and lysine. Further examples of suitable nitrogen-<br>
containing organic compounds include choline hydroxide, tetramethyl ammoniumhydroxide,<br>
tetraethyl ammoniumhydroxide. Preferred nitrogen-containing organic compounds include<br>
triethanol amine and quaternary ammoniums thereof.<br>
The molecular weight of the nitrogen containing organic compound can vary within wide<br>
limits. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the molecular weight of the amine or<br>
quaternary ammonium thereof is less than 180, suitably up to 170 and preferably up to 160.<br>
The molecular weight is usually at least 30. As stated herein, the molecular weight of a<br>
quaternary ammonium of an amine means the molecular weight of the cationic part of the<br>
quaternary ammonium compound, meaning that the anionic part of the quaternary<br>
ammonium compound is not included in the molecular weights given above. For nitrogen-<br>
containing organic compounds which are selected from amines and quaternary ammoniums<br>
thereof having one or more hydroxyl groups, the molecular weights may be higher, e.g. less<br>
than 500 and usually less than 300, although the above-mentioned molecular weights are<br>
also suitable for such compounds.<br>
In the present aqueous dispersion, or emulsion, the acid anhydride may be present in an<br>
amount of from about 0.1 to about 50% by weight, suitably from 0.1 to about 30% by weight<br>
and preferably from about 1 to about 20% by weight, based on the weight of the aqueous<br>
dispersion. The anionic polyelectrolyte is usually present in an amount of up to about 100%<br>
by weight, usually from 0.1 to 15% by weight, suitably from 0.5 to 10% by weight and<br>
preferably from 1 to 7% by weight, based on the weight of the acid anhydride. The nitrogen<br>
containing organic compound can be present in an amount of up to 20% by weight, usually<br>
from 0.1 to 15% by weight, suitably from 0.5 to 10% by weight and preferably from 1 to 7%<br>
by weight, based on the weight of the acid anhydride. In addition to the acid anhydride,<br>
anionic polyelectrolyte and nitrogen containing organic compound, optional additional<br>
compounds may be present in the dispersion. Examples of such compounds include mono-,<br>
di- and poly-anionic and non-ionic surfactants and dispersing agents, stabilizers, extenders<br>
and preservative agents such as, for example, hydrolyzed acid anhydrides, e.g. hydrolyzed<br><br>
alkyl and alkenyl acid anhydrides as mentioned above, preferably hydrolyzed alkenyl<br>
succinic anhydrides, e.g. hydrolyzed acid anhydrides in the form of carboxylic acid and/or<br>
carboxylic acid ester derivatives, anionic surfactants like phosphate esters, such as<br>
ethoxylated phosphate esters, alkyl sulphates, sulphonates and phosphates, alkylaryl<br>
sulphates, sulphonates and phosphates, e.g. sodium lauryl sulphonate and ethoxylated,<br>
phosphated isotridecylalcohol. If present, the content of such additional compounds in the<br>
dispersion can be from 0.1 to 15% by weight, suitably from 1 to 10% by weight and<br>
preferably from 2 to 7% by weight, based on the weight of the acid anhydride. Water is also<br>
present in the dispersion and may constitute the remainder of the dispersion up to 100% by<br>
weight.<br>
The dispersion according to the invention can be produced by forming a mixture containing<br>
the acid anhydride, anionic polyelectrolyte and nitrogen-containing organic compound as<br>
defined above and dispersing the mixture in the presence of water. The components of<br>
the dispersion may be admixed in any order but preferably the anionic polyelectrolyte and<br>
the nitrogen-containing organic compound are mixed and diluted with water to appropriate<br>
concentration, and then the acid anhydride is dispersed therein. The mixture may be<br>
dispersed by using suitable dispersing equipment providing sufficient degree of dispersing,<br>
e.g. a static mixer providing relatively low shear forces. The obtained dispersion contains<br>
droplets of acid anhydride usually having a droplet size of from 0.1 to 10 μm in diameter.<br>
The aqueous sizing dispersions according to the invention can be used in conventional<br>
manner in the production of paper using any type of cellulosic fibres and they can be used<br>
both for surface sizing and internal sizing. The term "paper", as used herein, is meant to<br>
include not only paper but all types of cellulosic products in sheet and web form including,<br>
for example, board and paperboard. The cellulosic suspension and finished paper can also<br>
contain mineral fillers, and usually the content of cellulosic fibres is at least 50% by weight,<br>
based on dry cellulosic suspension or finished paper. Examples of mineral fillers of<br>
conventional types include kaolin, china clay, titanium dioxide, gypsum, talc and natural and<br>
synthetic calcium carbonates such as chalk, ground marble and precipitated calcium<br>
carbonate. The present invention also relates to a process for the production of paper in<br>
which the present aqueous sizing dispersion is either added to an aqueous cellulosic<br>
suspension or applied to a cellulosic sheet or web. Suitably the amount of cellulose-reactive<br>
sizing agent either added to the cellulosic suspension to be drained on a wire to form paper,<br>
or applied to the surface of a cellulosic sheet or web as a surface size, usually at the size<br>
press, is from 0.01 to 1.0% by weight, based on dry cellulosic suspension and optional<br><br>
fillers, preferably from 0.05 to 0.5% by weight, where the dosage is mainly dependent on the<br>
quality of the pulp or paper to be sized and the level of sizing desired.<br>
The aqueous sizing dispersions according to the invention are particularly useful in the<br>
manufacture of paper from an aqueous cellulosic suspension that has a high conductivity.<br>
The conductivity of the suspension that is dewatered on the wire can be within the range of<br>
from 0.3 mS/cm to 10 mS/cm. According to this invention, good results can be achieved<br>
when the conductivity is at least 2.0 mS/cm, notably at least 3.5 mS/cm, particularly at least<br>
5.0 mS/cm and even at least 7.5 ms/cm. Conductivity can be measured by standard<br>
equipment such as, for example, a WTW LF 330 instrument supplied by Christian Berner.<br>
The values referred to above are suitably determined by measuring the conductivity of<br>
the cellulosic suspension that is fed into or present in the headbox of the paper machine<br>
or, alternatively, by measuring the conductivity of white water obtained by dewatering the<br>
suspension. High conductivity levels mean high contents of salts (electrolytes) which can be<br>
derived from the materials used to form the stock, from various additives introduced into the<br>
stock, from the fresh water supplied to the process, etc. Further, the content of salts is<br>
usually higher in processes where white water is extensively recirculated, which may lead to<br>
considerable accumulation of salts in the water circulating in the process.<br>
Chemicals conventionally added to the cellulosic suspension in papermaking such as<br>
retention aids, aluminium compounds, dyes, wet-strength resins, optical brightening agents,<br>
etc., can of course be used in conjunction with the present dispersion. Examples of<br>
aluminium compounds include alum, aluminates and polyaluminium compounds, e.g.<br>
polyaluminium chlorides and sulphates. Examples of suitable retention aids include cationic<br>
polymers, anionic inorganic materials in combination with organic polymers, e.g. bentonite in<br>
combination with cationic polymers, silica-based sols in combination with cationic polymers<br>
or cationic and anionic polymers. Particularly good sizing can be obtained when using the<br>
dispersion of the invention in combination with retention aids comprising cationic polymers.<br>
Suitable cationic polymers include cationic starch, acrylate-based and acrylamide-based<br>
polymers, polyethyleneimine, polyamines, polyamidoamines and poly(diallyldimethyl<br>
ammoniumchloride) and combinations thereof. Preferred retention aids include cationic<br>
starch and cationic acrylamide-based polymers, in a preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
the dispersions are used in combination with a retention system comprising at least one<br>
cationic polymer and anionic siliceous material, e.g. silica-based particles or bentonite. It is<br>
possible to pre-mix one or more components of the present dispersion with a retention aid,<br>
e.g. an anionic siliceous material, prior to introducing the mixture so obtained into the<br>
cellulosic suspension. Accordingly, the present aqueous sizing dispersion can be prepared<br><br>
just prior to introducing it into the cellulosic suspension by bringing into contact the acid<br>
anhydride and nitrogen containing organic compound with an anionic polyelectrolyte such<br>
as, for example, an aqueous siliceous material, e.g. a silica-based sol or bentonite slurry.<br>
The invention is further illustrated in the following examples, which, however, are not<br>
intended to limit the same. Parts and % relate to parts by weight and % by weight, respec-<br>
tively, unless otherwise stated.<br>
Example 1<br>
Aqueous dispersions according to the invention were prepared by dispersing alkenyl<br>
succinic anhydride (ASA) based on an olefin fraction comprising iso-hexadecenyl and iso-<br>
octadecenyl succinic anhydride in the presence of a mixture of anionic polyelectrolyte and<br>
amine in a Hash pipe static mixer.<br>
Aqueous dispersions used for comparison in this and further examples were prepared in a<br>
similar manner, except that no amine, no colloidal silica, high molecular weight amines<br>
and/or amines having no hydroxyl groups were used.<br>
The anionic polyelectrolyte used in this example was colloidal silica (Eka NP 590) in the<br>
form of an aqueous sol having a SiO2 content of 8.1% by weight and containing silica<br>
particles with a specific surface area of 850 m2/g which were aluminum-modified. The<br>
amine used in this example was triethanol amine (TEA) having a molecular weight of 149.<br>
The anionic polyelectrolyte and amine were mixed in the presence of water to form a<br>
mixture which was pumped into one end of the pipe at a flow of 3.17 l/min, and<br>
concentrated ASA was pumped in from the side of the pipe at a flow of 0.167 l/min. The<br>
pressure drop over the mixing unit was 3.4 bar. The obtained dispersion had an ASA<br>
content of 5% by weight, anionic polyelectrolyte content (in this example; SiO2 content) of<br>
5.0% by weight, based on the ASA, and amine content varying from 0 to 2.0% by weight,<br>
based on the ASA.<br>
Dispersions 1 to 4 were prepared, as shown in Table 1, in which the given SiO2 and<br>
amine contents are based on ASA.<br><br><br>
The particle size of the ASA droplets was measured in a Malvern Mastersizer Microplus<br>
after dilution of the dispersions with water to an ASA content of 0.5% by weight. The<br>
results are shown in Table 2. D(v 0.1), D(v 0.5) and D(v 0.9) means that 10, 50 and 90%<br>
of the particles, respectively, had a diameter less than the given size.<br><br>
As can be seen from Table 2, the dispersions according to the present invention,<br>
Dispersion Nos. 2 to 4, resulted in smaller particle sizes over the dispersion used for<br>
comparison, Dispersion No. 1.<br>
Sizing efficiency was evaluated by preparing hand sheets according to the standard<br>
method SCAN-C26:76 and sizing was measured as Cobb-60 values according to the<br>
standard method Tappi T441.<br>
Paper sheets were prepared according to a process in which the dispersions were added<br>
to an aqueous cellulosic suspension comprising recycled pulp having a fiber<br>
concentration of 0.5 g/l, conductivity of 0.7 mS/cm and pH around 7.0. The dispersions<br>
were added in amounts of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 kg/t, calculated as ASA and based on the<br>
weight of dry cellulosic suspension. A retention system was used comprising 6 kg/t of<br>
cationic potato starch (Perlbond 970) and 0.5 kg/t of silica sol (Eka IMP 442), calculated<br>
as dry substances on dry cellulosic suspension.<br><br>
Cobb-60 values were measured and the results are presented in Table 3. A lower Cobb<br>
value means that a lower amount of water was absorbed and therefore better sizing was<br>
achieved.<br>
Table 3<br><br>
As can be seen from Table 3, the dispersions according to the present invention,<br>
Dispersion Nos. 2 to 4, resulted in improved sizing efficiency over the dispersion used for<br>
comparison, Dispersion No. 1.<br>

2.0% by weight, based on the ASA.<br>
The amines used were triethanol amine (TEA) having a molecular weight of 149,<br>
diethylene triamine (DETA) having a molecular weight of 103, a fractioned coconut fatty<br>
amine (FCA) having a molecular weight of about 200, and a dihydrogenated tallow<br>
dimethylammonium chloride (DTDMAC) having a molecular weight of about 530.<br>
The particle sizes are presented in Table 6.<br><br>
The results of evaluating sizing efficiency are shown in Table 7.<br><br><br>

in smaller particle size and considerably improved sizing efficiency over the dispersions<br>
used for comparison, Dispersion Nos. 12 and 13. This also means that less energy was<br>
required to set surfaces free according to the present invention.<br>
Example 5<br>
Dispersions were prepared and evaluated according to the general procedures of Example<br>
1, except that different anionic polyelectrolytes were used. The obtained dispersion had an<br>

triethanol amine content 0 or 2.0% by weight, based on the ASA. The anionic<br>
polyelectrolytes used are shown in Table 8.<br><br><br>
The bentonites were slurried in water (5% by weight bentonite) and stored for 5 days in<br>
order to achieve sufficient swelling and delamination.<br>
Particle size was determined and stability was evaluated. Stability was measured 2 hours<br>
after preparation. If still stable after 24 hours, the particle size was determined again. The<br>
term "sep." means separation. The results are shown in Table 9.<br>
The results of evaluating sizing efficiency are shown in Table 10.<br>
Table 9<br><br><br><br>

nitrogen-containing organic compound, showed better sizing efficiency, better stability<br>
and resulted in smaller particle size over the dispersions used for comparison, Dispersion<br>
Nos. 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24, which contained no nitrogen-containing organic compound.<br>
Example 6<br>
Dispersions were prepared and particle size and sizing efficiency of the dispersions were<br>
evaluated according to the general procedures of Example 1, except that different<br>
surfactants and varying contents of the surfactants were used. The anionic polyelectrolyte<br>
used was colloidal silica (Eka NP 780) in the form of aqueous sol having a SiO2 content<br>
of 7.5% by weight and containing silica particles with a specific surface area of about 900<br>
m2/g and which were aluminium modified. The amine used was triethanol amine (TEA).<br>
The obtained dispersion had an ASA content of 5% by weight, SiO2 content of 5.0% by<br>
weight, based on the ASA, and amine content of 2.0% by weight, based on the ASA.<br>
No surfactant was incorporated into the Dispersion No. 26. Hydrolyzed ASA was<br>
incorporated as surfactant into Dispersion Nos. 27 and 28. The surfactant used in<br>
Dispersion No. 29 was a phosphate ester (poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl) alpha-isotridecyl-<br>
omega-hydroxyphosphate). The surfactant contents in the dispersions were based on<br>
ASA. The results of the particle size measurements are shown in Table 11.<br><br><br>
Sizing efficiency of the dispersions was evaluated and comparisons of the dispersions<br>
were made in an aqueous cellulosic suspension comprising 70% pulp (80/20 birch/pine<br>
kraft) and 30% filler (CaCO3).<br>
