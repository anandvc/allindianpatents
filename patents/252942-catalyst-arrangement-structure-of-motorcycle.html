Respective end portioo of the front exhaust pipe 7 and the rear exhaust pipe 8 ai connected to a merged exhaust pipe 21. A honeycomb-type :.: .: catalyst 19 is arranged in the front exhaust pipe 7 an: honeycomb-type sub catalyst 20 is arranged in the rear exhoo.<br><br>
pipe 8. A honeycomb-type main catalyst 22 is arranged betweer.<br>
the merged exhaust pipe 21 and a muffler device 16.<br>
[0004]<br>
Due to such an arrangement of the sub catalysts 19, 2!&gt; and the main catalyst 22, the lowering of temperatures of exhaust gases which flow in the respective exhaust'pipes 7, 8 can be suppressed due to heat generated by reactions in the sub catalysts 19, 20. Accordingly, a temperature of the merged exhaust gas when the merged exhaust gas flows in the man catalyst 22 after the exhaust gases in the exhaust pipes 7, 8 are merged is held at a high temperature and hence, the purification efficiency of the main catalyst 22 arranged a position remote from the front cylinder 6a and the rear cylinder 6b can be enhanced. [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problems that the Invention is to Solve] [0005]<br>
However, in an attempt to use a catalyst arrangeirie:. ■ structure in which only the main catalyst 22 is activated, wher the main catalyst 22 is arranged directly behind the fr exhaust pipe 7 and the rear exhaust pipe 8 respectively in pla of the sub catalysts 19, 20, the large main catalysts 22 exhir. _: large exhaust resistances and hence, there may be a case t;. v an output of the engine cannot be ensured.<br>

In this open state, at timing that the exhaust port 43b which is formed in the exhaust-device side, that is, in the cylinder head 43 (see Fig. 3) to which the metal tube 87 (see Fig. 3) is connected and is communicated with the exhaust pipe 56 assumes a negative pressure, air is sucked from an opening formed in a distal end of the intake hose 81 shown in Fig. 1, the sucked air passes through the intake hose 81 as well as &gt;  the air filter 82 and the relay hose 83 shown in Fig. 3 and,<br><br>
thereafter, arrives at the penetration hole 131a through the inside of the hose connection portion 192c of the intake port 102, the valve chamber 117, the main'passage 106d, and the side passage 106e which are shown in Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(b) so as to open the lead valve 132. Then, the air passes through the inside of the accommodating chamber 103c and the hose connection portion 103b. Further, the air passes through the relay hose 86, the metal tube 87, and the tube insertion hole 43a of the cylinder head 43 which are shown in Fig. 3 and, thereafter, flows into the inside of the exhaust port 43b of the cylinder head 43 to burn the unburnt gas in the inside of the exhaust gas.<br>
At timing that the exhaust port 43b assumes a positive pressure, the lead valve 132 is closed and the exhaust gas does not flow backward to the secondary air control valve 84 side. [0042]<br>
As has been explained heretofore in conjunction with Fig. 1 and Fig. 3, the present invention is firstly characterized in that, in the catalyst arrangement structure of the motorcycle 10 in which the vehicle body frame 11 includes the main frame 35 extending in the rearward direction from the head pipe 12 and the down frame 36 extending in the oblique rearward and downward direction from the head pipe 12, the engine 18 is arranged behind the down frame 36, and the metal honeycomb catalyst 57 is arranged in the exhaust pipe 56 extending in<br><br>
the downward and rearward direction from the engine 18, the exhaust pipe 56 forms the first tapered portion 71 and the second tapered portion 72 which have diameters thereof gradually enlarged toward the metal honeycomb catalyst 57 on portions thereof in front of and behind the metal honeycomb catalyst 57, and the metal honeycomb catalyst 57 is arranged along the down frame 3 6. [0043]<br>
Due to such a constitution, even when the metal honeycomb catalyst 57 is arranged upstream of the exhaust pipe 56 in the vicinity of the engine 18 along the down frame 36, it is possible to allow the exhaust gas to smoothly flow into the metal honeycomb catalyst 57 after expanding the exhaust gas by the first tapered portion 71 arranged upstream of the metal honeycomb catalyst 57 thus reducing the exhaust-air resistance as much as possible. Accordingly, even when the catalyst is arranged in the vicinity of the engine 18, it is possible to ensure the output of the engine 18. Further, the metal honeycomb catalyst 57 can be maintained at favorable activation temperature thereof while lowering the temperature of the exhaust gas by dispersing the exhaust gas and hence, it is possible to prevent the metal honeycomb catalyst 57 from being melted. It is also possible to effectively purify the exhaust gas . Further, the metal honeycomb catalyst 57 is arranged only on the exhaust pipe 56 behind the down frame 36 and hence, an<br><br>
increase in cost can be suppressed. [0044]<br>
The present invention is secondary characterized in that the exhaust pipe 56 includes the horizontal portion 77 thereof arranged in a horizontal posture or in a substantially horizontal posture below the engine 18, and the second tapered portion 72 arranged downstream of the metal honeycomb catalyst 57 is arranged in front of the horizontal portion 77.<br>
Due to such a constitution, even when the diameter of the exhaust pipe 56 is enlarged by forming the second tapered portion 72 on the exhaust pipe 56, it is possible to maintain the ground clearance of the motorcycle. [0045]<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the present invention is thirdly characterized in that the metal honeycomb catalyst 57 is arranged on a side of the down frame 36 and more inside the vehicle body than the outermost surface 95a of the crankcase 95 of the engine 18 as viewed in a plan view. [0046]<br>
Due to such a constitution, the metal honeycomb catalyst 57 and the large-diameter portion 76 are arranged more inside the vehicle body than the outermost surface 95a of the crankcase 95 and hence, it is possible to prevent the pebbles or the like from impinging on the large-diameter portion 76 which covers the metal honeycomb catalyst 57 from a side of the vehicle body.<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the present invention is fourthly characterized in that the connection portion 75 is formed on the cylinder head 43 of the engine 18 for connecting the exhaust pipe 56 to the cylinder head 43 of the engine 18, the tube insertion hole 43a to which the metal tube 87 as the secondary air supply pipe for supplying air into the inside of the exhaust pipe 56 is connected by insertion is formed in the vicinity of the connection portion 75, and the metal tube 87 extends downwardly toward the connection portion 75 from an upper portion of the cylinder head 43. [0048]<br>
Due to such a constitution, it is possible to further purify the exhaust gas by supplying the secondary air to the exhaust pipe 56 in addition to the purification performed by the metal honeycomb catalyst 57.<br>
Further, the metal tube 87 can be protected by the down frame 36 and, at the same time, it is possible to prevent the metal tube 87 from bulging in the vehicle width direction, [0049]<br>
Fig. 6 is a side view showing another embodiment of the catalyst arrangement structure according to the present invention. In Fig. 6, an exhaust pipe 140 is constituted of a connection portion 75 which is connected to a cylinder head 43 (see Fig. 2) , a first tapered portion 141 which is arranged<br><br>
downstream of the connection portion 75, a catalyst accommodating portion 147 which accommodates two columnar metal honeycomb catalysts 146, 146 arranged in parallel therein, a second tapered portion 142 which is arranged downstream of the catalyst accommodating portion 147, and a horizontal portion 77 which extends rearwardly from a rear end of the second tapered portion 142 in a horizontal posture and is connected to a muffler 58 (see Fig. 1) . [0050]<br>
Fig. 7 is a plan view showing another embodiment of the catalyst arrangement structure according to the present invention. In Fig. 7, two metal honeycomb catalysts 146, 146 are arranged in the vehicle width direction and hence, it is possible to increase an area of a catalyst surface compared to a case that one metal honeycomb catalyst is arranged. Further, for example, it is possible to decrease an occupied space of the catalysts 146, 146 in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle compared to a case that one columnar metal honeycomb catalyst having a cross-sectional area equal to a total cross-sectional area of two combined metal honeycomb catalysts 146, 146 is adopted and hence, it is unnecessary to change a distance between the front wheel and the engine. [0051]<br>
As shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, the present invention is fifthly characterized in that the plurality of metal honeycomb<br><br>
catalysts 146 is arranged in parallel in the exhaust pipe 140.<br>
Due to such a constitution, it is possible to increase a catalyst area of the metal honeycomb catalyst 14 6 thus enhancing the purification property. [0052]<br>
Here, as shown in Fig. 7, in this embodiments, although two metal honeycomb catalysts 14 6 having a circular 'cross section are arranged in parallel in the inside of the catalyst accommodating portion 147 of the exhaust pipe 140, the present invention is not limited to such a constitution, and one metal honeycomb catalyst having an oblong or elliptical cross section may be accommodated in the inside of the catalyst accommodating portion 147.<br>
