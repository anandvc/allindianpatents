				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to certain beta hydroxy acids and to processes for the synthesis of the same. This invention also relates to pharmacological compositions containing the compounds of the present invention, and methods of treating asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, COPD, rhinitis, osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary inflammation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, perodontitis, multiple sclerosis, gingivitis, atherosclerosis, neointimal proliferation, which leads to restenosis and ischemic heart failure, stroke, renal diseases, tumor metastasis, and other inflammatory disorders characterized by over-expression and over-activation of an matrix metalloproteinase, using the compounds.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a naturally occurring superfamily of proteinases (enzymes) found in most mammals. The superfamily is composed of at least 26 members of zinc-containing en/vines produced by many cell types and sharing structural and functional features. Based on structural and functional considerations proteinases have been classified into different families and subfamilies (Hopper, NM, 1994, FEBS) such as collagenases (MMP-1, MMP-13), gelatinases (MMP-2. MMP-9), metalloelastases (MMP-12), the MT-MMPs (MMP-14, MMP-15) and sheddases such as TNF-converting enzymes (TACE, ACE).<br>
Metalloproteinases are believed to be important in a plethora of physiological disease processes that involve remodeling such as embryonic development, bone formation and uterine remodeling during menstruation. One major biological function of MMPs is to catalyze the breakdown of connective tissues or extra-cellular matrix by their ability to hydrolyze various components of tissue or mairix. Apart from their role in degrading connective tissue, MMPs are always involved in the activation of zymogen (pro) forms of other MMPs thereby inducing MMP activation. They are also involved in biosynthesis of TNF-alpha which is implicated in many pathological conditions.<br>
MMP-12 also known as macrophage elastase or metalloelastase is expressed in activated macrophages and has been shown to be secreted from alveolar macrophages from smokers as well as in foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions. MMP-12 knockout mouse studies have shown the development of significant emphysema, thus supporting its role in COPD. MMP-9 (gelatinase B, 92 kDa type IV collagenase) is one member of the MMP family that is released as a proenzyme and subsequently activated via a protease cascade in vivo. The concentration of MMP-9 is increased in diseases like asthma, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Because of its proteolytic ability, MMP-9 has been implicated in tissue remodelling of the airways and lungs in chronic inflammatory diseases such as<br><br>
severe asthma and COPD. MMP-9 is also likely to be physiologically important because of its ability to regulate the digestion of components of the extracellular matrix as well as the activity of other proteases and cytokines. MMP-9 is secreted in neutrophils, macrophages, osteoclasts, which are easily induced by cytokines and growth factors, and plays a role in various physiological and pathological processes.<br>
Over-expression or over-activation of an MMP or an imbalance between an MMP and a natural (i.e., endogenous) tissue inhibitor of a matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP) has been linked to a pathogenesis of diseases characterized by the breakdown of connective tissue or extracellular matrix.<br>
Examples of inflammatory conditions and autoimmune disorders in which the compounds of the invention have potentially beneficial effects include diseases of the respiratory tract such as asthma (including allergen-induced asthmatic reactions), cystic fibrosis, bronchitis (including chronic bronchitis), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), adult respiratory distress syndrome (AR.DS), chronic pulmonary inflammation, rhinitis and upper respiratory tract inflammatory disorders (I 'RID), ventilator induced lung injury, silicosis, pulmonary sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, arthritis e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, infectious arthritis, psoriasis arthritis, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, gouty arthritis and prosthetic joint failure gout acute synovitis, spondylitis and non-articular inflammatory conditions, e.g., hcrniated/ruptured/prolapsed intervertebral disk syndrome, bursitis, tendonitis, tenosynovitic fibromyalgic syndrome and other inflammatory conditions associated with ligamentous sprain and regional musculoskeletal strain, inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, e.g., ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome and gastritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus scleroderma, autoimmune exocrinopathy, autoimmune encephalomyelitis, diabetes, tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, cancer including carcinoma of the breast, colon, rectum, lung, kidney, ovary, stomach, uterus, pancreas, liver, oral, laryngeal and prostate, melanoma, acute and chronic leukemia, periodontal disease, neurodegenerative disease Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, muscle degeneration, inguinal hernia retinal degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, ocular inflammation, bone desorption diseases, osteoporosis, osteopetrosis, graft vs. host reaction allograft rejections, sepsis, endotoxemia, toxic shock syndrome, tuberculosis, usual interstitial and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, bacterial meningitis, systemic cachexia, cachexia secondary to infection or malignancy, cachexia secondary to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), malaria, leprosy, leishmaniasis, Lyme disease, glomerulonephritis, glomerulosclerosis, renal fibrosis, liver fibrosis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, endometriosis, pain, e.g., that associated with inflammation and/or trauma, inflammatory diseases of the skin, e.g., dermatitis, dermatitis, skin ulcers, psoriasis, eczema, systemic valvulitis vascular dementia, thrombosis, atherosclerosis, restenosis, reperfusion injury, plaque calcification, myocarditis, aneurysm,<br><br>
stroke, pulmonary hypertension, left ventricular remodeling and heart failure. Diseases of principal interest include COPD and inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract and joints and vascular diseases. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that reference herein to treatment extends to prophylaxis as well as the treatment of established conditions.<br>
Inhibition of the activity of one or more MMPs may be of benefit in these diseases or conditions, for example, various inflammatory and allergic diseases such as, inflammation of the joint, inflammation of the GI tract, inflammation of the skin, collagen remodeling, etc.<br>
Research has been carried out into the identification of inhibitors that are selective e.g., for a few of the MMP subtypes. An MMP inhibitor of improved selectivity would avoid potential side effects associated with inhibition of MMPs that are not involved in the pathogenesis of the disease being treated. Further, use of more selective MMP inhibitors would require administration of a lower amount of the inhibitor for treatment of disease than would otherwise be required and, after administration, partitioned in vivo among multiple MMPs. Still ftirther, the administration of a lower amount of compound would improve the margin of safety between the dose of the inhibitor required for therapeutic activity and the dose of the inhibitor at which toxicity is observed.<br>
The design and therapeutic application of MMP inhibitors has revealed that the requirement of a molecule to be an effective inhibitor of MMP class of enzymes is a functional group (e.g., carboxylic acid, hydroxamic acid or sulphydryl) capable of chelating to the active site Zn2+ ion (Whittaker, et al., Chem. Rev., 1999,99,2735-76).<br>
