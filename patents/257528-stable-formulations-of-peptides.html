				<td>STABLE FORMULATIONS OF PEPTIDES.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of pharmaceutical formulations. More specifically the invention pertains to shelf-stable pharmaceutical formulations comprising an insulino-tropic peptide.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therapeutic peptides are widely used in medical practise. Pharmaceutical compositions of such therapeutic peptides are required to have a shelf life of several years in order to be suitable for common use. However, peptide compositions are inherently unstable due to sensitivity towards chemical and physical degradation. Chemical degradation involves change of covalent bonds, such as oxidation, hydrolysis, racemization or cross linking. Physical degradation involves conformational changes relative to the native structure of the peptide, which may lead to aggregation, precipitation or adsorption to surfaces.<br>
Glucagon has been used for decades in medical practise within diabetes and several gluca-gon-like peptides are being developed for various therapeutic indications. The preprogluca-gon gene encodes glucagon as well as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2). GLP-1 analogs and derivatives as well as the homologous lizard peptide, exendin-4, are being developed for the treatment of hyperglycemia within type 2 diabetes. GLP-2 are potentially useful in the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. However, all these peptides encompassing 29-39 amino acids have a high degree of homology and they share a number of properties, notably their tendency to aggregate and formation of insoluble fibrils. This property seems to encompass a transition from a predominant alpha-helix conformation to beta-sheets (Blundell T.L. (1983) The conformation of glucagon. In: Lefebvre P.J. (Ed) Glucagon I. Springer Verlag, pp 37-55, Senderoff R.I. et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 87 (1998)183-189, WO 01/55213). Aggregation of the glucagon-like peptides are mainly seen when solutions of the peptides are stirred or shaken, at the interface between solution and gas phase (air), and at contact with hydrophobic surfaces such as Teflon®.<br>
WO 01/77141 discloses heat treatment of Arg34-GLP-1 (7-37) at elevated temperatures for less than 30 seconds. WO 04/55213 discloses microfiltration of Arg34-GLP-1 (7-37) at pH 9.5.<br><br>
WO 01/55213 discloses treatment of Val8-GLP-1 (7-37) atpH 12.3 for 10 minutes at room temperature. WO 03/35099 discloses the preparation of zinc crystals of GLP-1 at alkaline PH.<br>
Thus, various treatments and addition of excipients must often be applied to pharmaceutical compositions of the glucagon-like peptides in order to improve their stability. Shelf life of liquid parenteral formulations of these peptides must be at least a year, preferably longer. The in-use period where the product may be transported and shaken daily at ambient temperature preferably should be several weeks. Thus, there is a need for pharmaceutical compositions of glucagon-like peptides which have improved stability.<br>

Pept. 1999;79:93-102 and Mentlein et al. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993;214:829-35. Peptides and their degradation products may be monitored by their absorbance at 220 nm (peptide bonds) or 280 nm (aromatic amino acids), and are quantified by integration of their peak areas related to those of standards. The rate of hydrolysis of a GLP-1 compound by dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV is estimated at incubation times which result in less than 10% of the GLP-1 compound being hydrolysed.<br>
The term "insulinotropic" as used herein referring to a peptide or a compound means the ability to stimulate secretion of insulin in response to an increased plasma glucose level.

Thioflavin T (ThT) fibrillation assay: Principle and examples<br>
Low physical stability of a peptide may lead to amyloid fibril formation, which is observed as well-ordered, thread-like macromolecular structures in the sample eventually resulting in gel formation. This has traditionally been measured by visual inspection of the sample. However, that kind of measurement is very subjective and depending on the observer. Therefore, the application of a small molecule indicator probe is much more advantageous. Thioflavin T (ThT) is such a probe and has a distinct fluorescence signature when binding to fibrils [Naiki et al. (1989) Anal. Biochem. 177, 244-249; LeVine (1999) Methods. Enzymol. 309, 274-284].<br>
The time course for fibril formation can be described by a sigmoidal curve with the following expression [Nielsen et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 6036-6046], cn.f figure 6 :<br>
Here, F is the ThT fluorescence at the time t. The constant to is the time needed to reach 50% of maximum fluorescence. The two important parameters describing fibril formation are the lag-time calculated by t0 - 2t and the apparent rate constant /capp = 1/t.<br>
Formation of a partially folded intermediate of the peptide is suggested as a general initiating mechanism for fibrillation. Few of those intermediates nucleate to form a template onto which further intermediates may assembly and the fibrillation proceeds. The lag-time corresponds to the interval in which the critical mass of nucleus is built up and the apparent rate constant is the rate with which the fibril itself is formed.<br>
Sample preparation<br>
Samples were prepared freshly before each assay. Each sample composition is described in the legends. The pH of the sample was adjusted to the desired value using appropriate amounts of concentrated NaOH and HCIO4. Thioflavin T was added to the samples from a stock solution in H2O to a final concentration of 1 jxM.<br>
Sample aliquots of 200 |*l were placed in a 96 well microtiter plate (Packard OptiPlate™-96, white polystyrene). Usually, eight replica of each sample (corresponding to one test condition) were placed in one column of wells. The plate was sealed with Scotch Pad (Qiagen).<br>
Incubation and fluorescence measurement<br>
Incubation at given temperature, shaking and measurement of the ThT fluorescence emission were done in a Fluoroskan Ascent FL fluorescence platereader (Thermo Labsystems). The temperature was adjusted to 37 °C. The orbital shaking was adjusted to 960 rpm with an amplitude of 1 mm in all the presented data. Fluorescence measurement was done using excitation through a 444 nm filter and measurement of emission through a 485 nm filter. Each run was initiated by incubating the plate at the assay temperature for 10 min. The plate was measured every 20 minutes for typically 45 hours. Between each measurement, the plate was shaken and heated as described.<br>
Data handling<br>
The measurement points were saved in Microsoft Excel format for further processing and curve drawing and fitting was performed using GraphPad Prism. The background emission from ThT in the absence of fibrils was negligible. The data points are typically a mean of eight samples and shown with standard deviation error bars. Only data obtained in the same experiment (i.e. samples on the same plate) are presented in the same graph ensuring a relative measure of fibrillation between the individual samples of one assay rather than comparison between different assays.<br>
The data set may be fitted to Eq. (1). However, since full sigmodial curves in this case are not usually achieved during the measurement time, the degree of fibrillation is expressed as ThT fluorescence at various time points calculated as the mean of the eight samples and shown with the standard deviation.<br>
Example 1<br>
The ThT fibrillation assay of a pharmaceutical composition of the acylated GLP-1 analogue liraglutide is shown in Figure 1 (experimental performed along procedures described in "General procedure"). After approximately 10 hours the ThT fluorescence emission increases indicating the on-set of fibrillation. This signal increases steadily and reaches a plateau before the assay is terminated. In the presence of 200 ppm Poloxamer 188, however, the ThT fluorescence signal remains at the background level. This indicates that no fibrillation occurs and, hence, the pharmaceutical composition is physical stable under these conditions. The pharmaceutical compositions used in example 1 (Figure 1) is not added a buffer.<br>

The effect of Poloxamer 188 in a pharmaceutical composition of liraglutide containing sodium phosphate as a buffer is shown in Figure 2 (experimental performed along procedures described in "General procedure"). Here, the presence of 50 ppm Poloxamer 188 prolongs the lag time before on-set of fibrillation, whereas 100 ppm Poloxamer 188 completely inhibits fibrillation during the assay time.<br>
Example 3<br>
Polysorbate 20 does also stabilise formulations of liraglutide. One such example is shown in Figure 3 (experimental performed along procedures described in "General procedure"). The presence of 200 ppm Polysorbate 20 attenuates the fibrillation, which is observed as a slower growth rate of the ThT fluorescence signal. Hence, a significantly smaller ThT<br>
fluorescence signal is observed in the Polysorbate 20 sample than in the reference after 40 hours of incubation.<br>
Example 4<br>
Two pharmaceutical compositions are prepared :<br>
F1.1.2 mM liraglutide, 14 mg/ml propylene glycol, 40 mM phenol, 3 Zn/hexamer, aspart 0.6<br>
mM, 8 mM bicine, 50 ppm poloxamer 188, pH 7,7.<br>
F2. 1.2 mM liraglutide, 14 mg/ml propylene glycol, 40 mM phenol, 3 Zn/hexamer, aspart 0.6<br>
mM, 8 mM bicine, pH 7.7.<br>
Physical stability of the pharmaceutical compositions are evaluated by means of an accelerated stressed test. The stressed test is performed as a rotation test. 50ul air is added to 5 cartridges (glass .vials) of each formulation. The cartridges are rotated with a frequency of 30 rotations per minute for 4 hours daily. The test is stopped after 22 days of rotation. The inspection of the cartridges is followed daily or as required. The turbidity of the pharmaceutical compositions is characterized by nephelometric measurement of the turbidity on a HACH Turbidimeter 2100AN. The turbidity measurement of a liquid is specified in "Nephelometric Turbidity Unit" (NTU). Physical instability of the protein is characterised by high turbidity measurements.<br>
The experiment shows that composition F2 has a much more rapid increase in NTU as compared to that of the F1 composition.<br>
