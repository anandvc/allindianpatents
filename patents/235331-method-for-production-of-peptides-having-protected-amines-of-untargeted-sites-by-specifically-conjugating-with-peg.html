				<td>Peptides having protected amines of untargeted sites, methods for<br>
production thereof and of specifically conjugated PEG peptides using<br>
the same<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to methods of specifically conjugating at least<br>
one PEG(polyethylene glycol)s to amines of targeted sites in synthetic peptide with at<br>
least two branched amines, and further relates to synthetic peptides having selectively<br>
protected amines of untargeted sites and methods for the production thereof, and to<br>
method of specifically conjugating PEGs to targeted sites of the synthetic peptide and<br>
purifying by ion exchange chromatography.<br>
Background Art<br>
Technologies for conjugating PEG to peptides and proteins are based on<br>
Davis and Abuchowski study (Abuchowski A. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 252, 3571-3581,<br>
1977; Abuchowski A. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 252, 3582-3586, 1977). PEG is a polymer<br>
which is hydrophilic, biocompatible and harmless .having the structure of<br>
H(OCH2CH2)nOH and it is known that in case of being conjugated to peptide and<br>
protein, it inhibits enzymatic metabolism via steric hindrance as the same way as sugar<br>
chain in glycoprotein does, decreases renal glomerular filtration with increased<br>
molecular size of peptide and protein having conjugated PEGs, thereby increasing the<br>
duration of physiological activity. Covalent bond between polypeptide and PEG was<br>
published in USP No. 4179337, and it was described that modification of proteins and<br>
enzymes with PEG leads to reduced immunogenicity and antigenicity and increased half<br>
life within blood.<br>
For covalent bonding of PEG to polypeptide, it is necessary that "activation"<br>
process of converting the terminal hydroxyl moiety of PEG to a reactive functional<br>
group. As an "activated PEG alkylating agents such as PEG aldehydes, PEG<br>
epoxides and PEG tresylates, and acylating agents such as PEG esters can be<br>
enumerated, and the representative example is PEG succinimidyl succinate.<br>
Poly(ethyleneglycol)-N-succinimide carbonate and producing method thereof was<br>
known from Abuchowski et al, Cancer Biochem. Biophys. 7:175-186(1984) and USP<br>
No. 512614 etc. PEGs in molecular range of 2,000-40,000 can be employed and PEGs<br>
such as -methoxylated PEGs and branched PEGs can be used. The branched PEG can<br>
be represented with the structure of R(-PEG-OH)m [herein, R defines central core<br>
moiety such as pentaerythritol or glycerol, m defines the number of branching arm in a<br>
range of 3-100]. Hydroxyl group can be used for chemical modification. Other<br>
branched PEG with the structure of (CH3O-PEG-)PR-X (W096/21469) is employed<br>
[herein, p is 2 to 3, R represents central core moiety such as lysine and glycerol, and X<br>
defines a functional group such as carboxyl group used for activation. Pendant PEG of<br>
another branched PEG has functional group such as carboxyl moiety on PEG backbone,<br>
other than terminus of PEG chain. All these branched PEGs can be used via<br>
"activation" as described previously.<br>
In the reaction of conjugating "activated" PEGs to peptide amines, generally,<br>
PEGs bond to one or more amines nonspecifically, thus the core of this technology lies<br>
in the method of specifically combining PEG molecules to amines at specific positions.<br>
However, in case of peptides containing at least one lysine within the amino acid<br>
sequence, as two or more amines exist therein, it is very difficult to specifically<br>
conjugate PEGs to amines at specific sites. In case PEGs are conjugated to peptide<br>
according to general methods, various conjugates can be generated, from a conjugate<br>
having one conjugated PEG to a conjugate having multiple-conjugated PEGs as many<br>
as the number of amines, and even in case of the conjugate having one PEG (a mono-<br>
PEG conjugate), positional isomers in which conjugation sites of PEG are different one<br>
another, can be formed. Usually, as PEG conjugates of peptide differ in activity and<br>
enzymatic metabolism according to the number of combined PEGs and combined sites<br>
thereof, the method producing such mixture containing various conjugates is<br>
disadvantageous for the reason of very low activity yield and being a mixture. To<br>
separate and purify specific isomer from the mixture is very complicated, accompanied<br>
by very low yield and high cost. To compensate such disadvantages, various methods<br>
for site-specific PEGylation have been proposed, however, efficient methods for<br>
specific conjugation of PEGs to amines on specific positions has not yet been developed.<br>
Chem. Pharm. Bull. 39(12):3373-3375(1991) reported on a conjugate of<br>
fibronectin-related tripeptide(Arg-Gly-Asp) and amino-poly(ethyleneglycol) and<br>
activity thereof. Herein, a method for preparing PEG conjugate by combining amino<br>
PEG to aspartic acid activated with dicyclohexylcarbodiiniide(DCC)/!-<br>
hydroxybenzotriazole(HOBt), was proposed. However, this method is defective in that<br>
it can be used only for modification of C-terminus and racemization of adjacent amino<br>
acids can occur during the C-terminal activation of peptide. Such racemization can<br>
occur in every amino acids except glycine, resulting in reduction of activity of peptide.<br>
Methods for combining monomethoxy poly(ethyleneglycol)(mPEG) or<br>
polyvinylalcohol(PVA) to peptide using synthetic resin were published in Journal of<br>
Protein Chemistiy 10(6):623-627(1991). Since only the conjugate in which a single<br>
polymer is combined to N-terminus of the peptide from the method, it fails to provide a<br>
method for combining PEG to positions that can maximize the effect of PEGylation<br>
(maximizing the duration of peptide activity and minimizing enzymatic metabolism).<br>
PCT patent application No. PCT/US94/06953(1994) provides methods for<br>
preparing site-specific PEG peptide in which PEG is introduced during synthetic<br>
process of the peptide. That is, it provides a method for preparing PEG-conjugated<br>
peptide in which peptide is partially synthesized until its sequence reaches lysine at<br>
targeted position, and then PEG is combined, and finally the remaining portion of the<br>
peptide is synthesized to. complete PEG peptide, a method for preparing PEGconjugated<br>
peptide by using, as the lysine of targeted site, lysine in which Na-amine<br>
thereof was protected with Fmoc(9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) and" branched amine<br>
thereof was combined with PEG, and a method wherein peptide fragment having PEGs<br>
combined to the amines of targeted sitse and the remaining peptide fragment were<br>
separately synthesized and combined to complete the PEG-conjugated peptide.<br>
Nevertheless, such methods might bring undesirable result due to the effect of the<br>
previously combined PEG on subsequent step of the synthesis. For example, in case<br>
PEG is introduced during the peptide synthesis and synthesis of the remaining portion is<br>
to be continued, a peptide lacking at least one amino acid of the amino acid sequence<br>
might be produced, and such peptide can b harmful to a living body and its purification<br>
is almost impossible. Therefore, such method is not desirable as a method for<br>
preparing a PEG-conjugated peptide usable as a medicine.<br>
PCT patent application No. PCT/EP9S/0774S provides methods for<br>
combining PEG to amine of GRF in an organic solvent and purifying the resulting<br>
mixture of Lys(PEG)12-GRF, Lys(PEG)2I-GRF, Lys(PEG)12'21-GRF and [Na-PEG-Try1,<br>
Lys(PEG)12' 21]-GRF by gel chromatography and reverse phase chromatography.<br>
However, this method cannot provide specificity between amine moieties of Na, Lys12<br>
and Lys21 . Said patent also provides methods for synthesis of [Lys(Alloc)12'2I ]-<br>
GRF(l-29) and [Na-isopropyl-Try1^ Lys(Alloc)12]-GRF(l-29) and specific PEGylation<br>
using them, though, in case of [Lys(Alloc)12'21 ]-GRF(l-29), PEG can be conjugated to<br>
only Na amine, and fails to provide a preparing method for Lys21 -PEG conjugate which<br>
is most effective as described in said patent. In addition, in case PEG conjugate is<br>
prepared by using [Na-isopropyl-Try', Lys(Alloc)12]-GRF(l-29), not PEG conjugate of<br>
GRF(l-29)- NH2,but PEG conjugate of [N" -isopropyl-Try1]-GRF(l-29)-NH2, i.e. [Na<br>
-isopropyl-Try1, Lys(PEG) 21]-GRF(l-29) is to be formed. Therefore, this method<br>
fails to provide completely specific PEGylation for the original peptide having Nterminal<br>
amine, GRF(l-29)- NH2.<br>
The inventors of the present invention intended to develop specific<br>
PEGylation by which product yield can be noticeably raised and efforts and cost needed<br>
for separation and purification of the final product can be reduced, by forming the final<br>
product in which PEGs are conjugated only to amines at targeted sites while preventing<br>
the formation of impurity product having PEGs conjugated to amines of untargeted sites.<br>
The present invention provides method for-preparing specific PEG-conjugated<br>
peptide in which the effect of PEG conjugation is maximized by allowing PEGs to be<br>
conjugated to amines at targeted sites only with complete selectivity.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to synthetic peptides having selectively protected<br>
amines of untargeted sites, methods for production thereof, and methods for specifically<br>
conjugating PEGs to targeted sites of the synthetic peptide. In more detail, the present<br>
invention relates to (A) a method for preparing peptides having selectively protected<br>
amines of untargeted sites, comprising synthesizing the peptide by separately blocking<br>
amines of targeted sites and amings ofiintargeted sites with different protecting groups<br>
which are removed under different deblocking condition {e.g. ivDde[l-(4,4-dimethyl-<br>
2,6-dioxocyclohexylidene)-3-methylbutyl] or Mtt(4-methyltrityl), and Boc(tertbuthoxycarbonyl)}<br>
and protecting Na -amine with Fmoc or Nsc, (B) peptides having<br>
selectively protected amines of untargeted sites prepared by said method and (C)<br>
methods for preparing specific PEG-conjugated peptide in which PEG are specifically<br>
conjugated to amines of targeted sites, comprising (1) reacting said peptide with<br>
activated PEGs and (2) removing the amine blocking groups of the compound obtained<br>
in said step (1) under acid-base deblocking conditions.<br>
The present invention further relates to methods for preparing peptides having<br>
selectively protected amines of untargeted sites, additionally comprising a step of<br>
substituting the protecting groups of the amines at untargeted sites, including Na -amine<br>
of the peptide synthesized as described above with final amine protecting groups.<br>
As the final amine protecting groups, at least one selected from the group<br>
consisting of Fmoc, Nsc, Dde, ivDde and other protecting groups removed under basic<br>
conditions, can be used, or at least one selected from the group consisting of Boc and<br>
other protecting groups removed under acidic conditions, can be used.<br>
One of general methods for synthesizing peptide is to repeat the reaction in<br>
which carboxyl moiety of C-terminal amino acid with protected Na -amine is combined<br>
to resin, deblocking of the amine is conducted under basic condition, and according to<br>
the sequence, next ammo acid with protected Na -amine is combined, thereby reaching<br>
N-terminal amino acid. In case lysine having branched amine is contained in the<br>
amino acid sequence, lysine in which the branched amine is protected with Boc<br>
removed under acidic condition and Na-amine is protected with Fmoc or Nsc[4-<br>
nitrophenylsulfonylethoxycarbonyj]., removed under basic condition is used, thereby<br>
allowing the branched amine not to undergo deblocking under the deblocking condition<br>
of Na -amine for combining 'subsequent amino acid. However, in case of peptide<br>
having at least two branched amines, as distinction between the branched amines is<br>
difficult, synthesis of completely selectively protected peptide was" difficult. In<br>
synthesizing peptides with at least two branched amines, the inventors of the present.<br>
invention synthesized selectively protected peptide in which the branched amines can be<br>
differentiated simply based on acid-base deblocking management by using Fmoc or Nsc<br>
as protecting groups of Na-amine and two kinds of amine protecting groups removed<br>
under different conditions, i.e. either Boc and ivDde or Mtt as protecting groups of the<br>
branched amines, and based on this, developed completely specific PEGylation, thereby<br>
completing the present invention. The reason for differentiating between branched<br>
amines of untargeted sites and N-terminal amine and using individually different<br>
protecting groups is because only N-terminal amine should be selectively reacted upon<br>
synthesis of peptide. Amines at untargeted sites may be substituted with other<br>
protecting groups at final step of the peptide synthesis according to necessity for<br>
stability under PEGylation conditions. As this method enables synthesis of selectively<br>
protected peptide simply by modifying acid-base conditions, it is advantageous<br>
compared to the methods based on reductive reaction or allyl substitution in that the<br>
reaction is simple, economical and yielding the peptide with high purity.<br>
For example, as specific embodiments of the present invention, the following<br>
methods can be enumerated.<br>
In case of method hi which branched amines of targeted sites are protected<br>
with Boc and branched amines of untargeted sites are protected with ivDde, in the step<br>
of<br>
introducing lysine of targeted site, a lysine in which Na-amine is protected with Fmoc<br>
or Nsc and branched amine is protected with Boc is used, and in the step of introducing<br>
lysine of other sites, lysine where Na-amine is protected with Fmoc or Nsc and<br>
branched amine is protected with ivDde, is used for the peptide synthesis. - During the<br>
procedure for the synthesis, ivDde is not removed under deblocking condition of Fmoc<br>
or Nsc, e.g. 1% DBU(l,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undes-7-ene)-20% piperidine/DMF(N,Ndimethylformamide).<br>
In case of the synthesized peptide-resin(branched amine of<br>
targeted site is protected with Boc, branched amine of untargeted site, with ivDde, and<br>
N-terminal amine, with Fmoc or Nsc), after ivDde.on branched amine of untargeted site<br>
and Fmoc on N-terminai arnine are removed, thus resulting free amine is protected with<br>
Fmoe or Nsc {for instance, by reacting with Fmoc-0su(9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonylsuccinamide)<br>
or Nsc-OSu}. At this time, said deblocking can be conducted, for<br>
example, by treating with 2% hydrazine solution. This peptide-resin is treated with<br>
cleavage solution (for example, triisopropylsilane(TIS):water:trifluoroacetic acid(TFA)=<br>
2.5:2.5:95) to separate peptide from resin and at the same time, to remove Boc on amine<br>
of targeted site, thereby obtaining peptide in which amines of untargeted site are<br>
i<br>
protected with Fmoc or Nsc.<br>
In case of method in which branched amine of targeted site is protected with<br>
Boc and branched amines of untargeted site are protected with Mtt, in the step of<br>
introducing lysine of targeted site, lysine in which Na-amine is protected with Fmoc or<br>
Nsc and branched amine is protected with Boc is used, and in the step of introducing<br>
lysine .afother sites, lysine where Na-amine is protected with Fmoc or Nsc and branched<br>
amine is protected with Mtt is used for the peptide synthesis. During the procedure for<br>
the synthesis, Mtt is not removed, under the basic conditions used for removal of Fmoc<br>
or Nsc. Thus synthesized peptide-resin (branched amine of targeted site is protected<br>
with Boc, branched amine of untargeted site, with Mtt, and N-terminal amine, with<br>
Fmoc or Nsc) is subjected to removal of Mtt on branched amine of untargeted site.<br>
Said deblocking can be carried out, for exmple, by treating with 1%<br>
TFA/MC(methylene chloride). At this time, the protecting group of amine at targeted<br>
site, Boc, is not removed. This peptide-resin (branched amine of targeted site is<br>
protected with Boc, N-terminal amine is protected with Fmoc or Nsc, and branched<br>
amine of untargeted site is exposed) is reacted with Fmoc-OSu or Nsc-OSu to protect<br>
branched amines of untargeted sites with Fmoc or Nsc, and then, the protecting group of<br>
amine at targeted site, Boc, is removed by cleavage solution (for exmple,<br>
TIS:water:TFA=2.5:2.5:95), to obtain selectively protected peptide(amine of targeted<br>
site is exposed and amines of untargeted sites are protected with Fmoc or Nsc).<br>
Peptide in which amines of untargeted sites are protected with Boc can be<br>
prepared by method of protecting amine of targeted site with ivDde and amines of<br>
untargeted sites with Boc. In step of introducing lysine of targeted site, lysine in which<br>
Na-amine is protected with Fmoc or Nsc and branched amine is protected with ivDde is<br>
used, and in step of introducing lysine of other sites, lysine in which Na-amine is<br>
protected with Fmoc or Nsc and branched amine is protected with Boc is used for the<br>
peptide synthesis. During the synthesis, ivDde is not removed under deblocking<br>
condition of Fmoc or Nsc, for example, 1% DBU-20% piperidine/DMF. For the<br>
synthesized peptide-resin (branched amine of targeted site is protected with ivDde,<br>
branched amine of untargeted site, with Boc and N-terminal amine, with Fmoc or Nsc),<br>
removal of the N-terminal amine protecting group, Fmoc is performed (for example, by<br>
treatment with 1% DBU-20% piperidine in DMF) and then treated with cleavage<br>
f-<br>
solution (for example, TIS:water:TFA=2.5:2.5:95) to separate resin and peptide. At<br>
this time, a branched amine protecting group at targeted site, Boc is removed.<br>
Exposed amine of this peptide (branched amine of targeted site is protected with ivDde,<br>
and branched amine of untargeted site and N-terminal amine are exposed) is protected<br>
with Boc, and ivDde on amine of targeted site is removed, thereby obtaining peptide in<br>
which amines of untargeted sites are protected with Boc. At this time, said protection<br>
can be done, for example, by reacting with Boc2O(di-tert-butyl dicarbonate), and said<br>
deblocking can be done, for example, by treatment with 2% hydrazine solution.<br>
Peptides in which amines of untargeted sites are protected with Boc can be<br>
prepared by methods of protecting amine of targeted site with Mtt, and amines of<br>
untargeted sites with Boc. In this method, a resin extremely sensitive to acid such as<br>
2-CLTR (2-chlorotrityl resin) should be used, and caution is required since yield and<br>
purity can be reduced due to moisture. In this method, in the step of introducing lysine<br>
of targeted site, lysine where Na-amine is protected with Fmoc or Nsc and branched<br>
amine is protected with Mtt is used, and in the step of introducing lysine of other sites,<br>
lysine where Na-amine is protected with Fmoc or Nsc and branched amine is protected<br>
with Boc is used for the peptide synthesis. During the synthesis, Mtt is not removed<br>
under the basic conditions used for removal of Fmoc or Nsc. Thus in synthesized<br>
peptide-resin (branched amine of targeted site is protected with Mtt, branched amine of<br>
untargeted site, with Boc, and N-terminal amine, with Fmoc or Nsc), removal of the<br>
protecting group of N-terminal amine, Fmoc or Nsc is conducted and protection of<br>
exposed Na-amine of N-temiinus is performed with Boc. Said deblocking can be<br>
carried out, for example, by treating with 1% DBU-20% piperidine in DMF, and said<br>
protection can be conducted, for example, by reacting with Boc20. Thus synthesized<br>
peptide-resin (branched amine of targeted site is protected with Mtt, and amine(s) of<br>
untargeted sites are protected with Boc and C-terminus is combined to resin) is treated<br>
with TFA/MC to separate resin and peptide, and the protecting group of amine at<br>
targeted site, Mtt is removed, thereby obtaining peptide in which amine(s) of untargeted<br>
sites are protected with Boc. The protected peptide thus obtained is in a state where<br>
amines of untargeted sites are protected with Boc and active moiety except amine, i.e.<br>
hydroxyl or carboxyl group is protected and these protecting groups are to be removed<br>
at one time during the removal of Boc by cleavage solution (for instance,<br>
TIS:water:TFA=2.5:2.5:95) after PEGylation.<br>
Besides said methods, various methods can be derived from the present<br>
invention, and these are also included in the present invention.<br>
In addition, the peptide synthesized according to the present invention can be<br>
directly used for PEGylation, or can be employed for PEGylation, if necessary, after<br>
passing through additional step of protecting amines of untargeted site, including Naamine<br>
with final amine protecting group. At this time, the final amine protecting<br>
group can be at least one selected from the group consisting of Fmoc, Nsc, Dde[l-(4,4-<br>
dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohexylidene)ethyl], ivDde or other protecting group removed<br>
under basic condition, or at least one protecting group selected from the group<br>
consisting of Boc or other protecting group removed under acidic condition.<br>
The present invention further includes a method where peptide is separately<br>
synthesized by dividing the peptide into two or more fragments to raise efficiency of the<br>
peptide synthesis, and these are condensed to produce peptide in which amine(s) of<br>
untargeted sites are protected. Even in this case, protection-deblocking of the amine(s)<br>
is same as previously described, ^ej;, as racemization may occur during condensation of<br>
fragments, thus this method can be effectively used for peptides which contain Gly or<br>
Pro that do not bring racemization upon condensation, in its amino acid sequence, and<br>
more useful in case of peptide whose synthesis or purification is difficult. In this<br>
method, for example, peptide synthesis is conducted by dividing the peptfde into two<br>
fragments, i.e. one fragment of from N-terminus to Gly or Pro and the other fragment of<br>
from subsequent amino acid to C-terminus and the two fragments are condensed to form<br>
the peptide. A resin used for synthesis of fragment having N-terminal region should<br>
be extremely sensitive to acid so that TRT series resin is used, and upon completion of<br>
the synthesis of fragments, the fragments are separated from the resin under acidic<br>
condition while retaining other protecting group. A fragment having C-terminal<br>
region can be synthesized using conventional resin and condensed with N-terminal<br>
fragment while being combined to resin, and then can be separated from the resin, or Cterminal<br>
fragment can be synthesized using an acid-sensitive resin, separated from resin<br>
with protecting group being retained, and then subjected to condensation with Nterminal<br>
fragment in solution phase. In case the fragment is synthesized using an acidsensitive<br>
resin and Mtt as a branched amine protecting group, and then separated from<br>
the resin, separation is conducted under the condition, AcOH:TFE(2,2,2-<br>
triflubroethanol):MC(l:l:8) or TFE:MC(2:8) in order for Mtt not to be removed. In<br>
case branched amine of untargeted site in the N-terminal fragment is protected with<br>
ivDde, after condensation is completed, before separating peptide having full sequence<br>
from resin, protecting group can be substituted with Fmoc or Nsc. Additionally, in<br>
case amine at a targeted site is present on N-terminal fragment, separation from resin<br>
should be conducted under condition in which removal of Boc does not occur. Cterminal<br>
fragment is synthesized by the same method as in continuous synthesis.<br>
As synthetic method for peptide that can be used in the present invention,<br>
there is no special limitation as long as it is compatible with the present invention, yet<br>
preferably, solid phase peptide synthesis is employed.<br>
As the peptide to which the present invention can be applied, there is no<br>
special limitation as long as it is peptides having at least two branched amines. The<br>
present invention will be useful for peptides, which require extension of biological halflife<br>
or reduction of immunogenicity or antigenicity via combining PEGs to specific sites<br>
thereof. As an example, calcitonin or GRF(l-29) can be enumerated.<br>
Peptides having protected amine(s) of untargeted sites enable completely<br>
specific PEGylation to peptide. Reacting peptide in which amine(s) of untargeted sites<br>
are protected with Fmoc, Nsc, Boc or other amine protecting groups stable under<br>
PEGylation condition, with activated PEGs leads to specific combining of PEGs to only<br>
amines at targeted sites and the reaction can almost complete in accordance with their<br>
equivalent ratio and reaction condition. Conducting deblocking {for example, 5%<br>
piperidine/DMF condition for protecting group, Fmoc or Nsc, and cleavage solution<br>
(TIS:water:TFA=2.5:2.5:95) for protecting group, Boc} of thus protected peptide-PEG<br>
conjugate (PEG are combined to amines of targeted sites and amines of untargeted sites<br>
are protected with protecting groups) leads to formation of peptide in which PEGs are<br>
specifically combined to amines at targeted sites.<br>
Therefore, another embodiment of the present invention is methods for<br>
preparing specific PEG-conjugated peptide in which PEGs are specifically combined to<br>
amines of targeted sites, comprising (1) reacting the peptide in which amines at<br>
untargeted sites are selectively protected with activated PEGs and (2) amine protecting<br>
groups of thus obtained compound are removed under acid-base deblocking {...*- condition.<br>
Said reaction mixture is confirmed not having other peptide-derived substance,<br>
and specifically conjugated PEG-peptide with high purity can be obtained by removing<br>
uncombined PEG and released protecting groups through ionic exchange<br>
chromatography, removing salts via reverse phase resin (e.g. C-18 Sep-Pak catridge),<br>
and subjecting to lyophilization.<br>
Activated PEG that can conjugate with the peptide having selectively<br>
protected amines of untargeted sites, prepared according to the present invention, has no<br>
particular limitation and includes all the above mentioned PEG, yet, it is preferably<br>
linear or branched hydroxy- or methoxy-type alkylating or acylating PEG of 1,000 to<br>
40,000, and more preferably, at least one selected from the group consisting of monomethoxy<br>
poly(ethyleneglycol)succinimidyl succinate, mono-methoxy<br>
poly(ethyleneglycol)succinimidyl propionate, mono-methoxy<br>
poly(ethyleneglycol)succinimidyl carbonate, mono-methoxy<br>
poly(ethyleneglycol)succinimidyl carbamate and mono-methoxy<br>
poly(ethyleneglycol)tresylate, can be used.<br>
The specifically conjugated PEG-peptide of the present invention can be<br>
formulated into pharmaceutical dosage forms containing the peptide in therapeutically<br>
effective amount. Formulations such as injection, infusions, depot for injections,<br>
inhalations can be available, and buffering agents, tonicity regulating agents, stabilizers,<br>
surfactants, thickeners, preservatives, coloring agents and flavoring agents can be added.<br>

2.0 g of link-amide resin was put in 50 ml peptide reaction vessel, 20 ml of<br>
DCM was poured and left for 30 min to allow the resin to sufficiently expand. The<br>
solution was removed via filtration. 20 ml of deblocking solution (1% DBU-20%<br>
piperidine in DMF) was added and reacted for 5 min (this process was repeated twice)<br>
to remove Fmoc, and washed 5 to 7 times with 20 ml DMF. Removal of remained<br>
piperidine and dibenzofulvene was confirmed with chloranil test [the test can be used to<br>
determine whether the removal of Nsc or Fmoc-related adducts and residual piperidine<br>
is complete. The test solution is prepared by adding a drop of a saturated solution of<br>
chloranil in toluene to about 1 ml of acetone. The DMF washing may be tested by<br>
adding a drop of the washing solution to the chloranil test solution. A blue or violet<br>
color is a positive indication for the presence of secondary amine].<br>
To introduce C-terminal amino acid of calcitonin, Pro, Nsc-Pro-OH(1.5 eq),<br>
Bop(1.5 eq), HOBt(1.5 eq) and DIPEA(1.5 eq) were dissolved in 4 ml DMF and 8 ml<br>
DCM and put to said reactor containing the resin. The reaction solution was further<br>
washed with 8 ml DCM, added to the reactor, additional DIPEA(1.5 eq) was added, and<br>
reacted at 35°C to 40°C for 1 hr while mixing with an adequate blender. End point of<br>
the reaction was determined by Kaiser test [To check completion of the reaction using<br>
the qualitative ninliydrin test, a 2-10 mg sample of the resin is withdrawn and washed<br>
with ethanol. To the sample, 2 drops of 80% phenol solution, 2 drops of 0.02 mM<br>
KCN in pyridine and 2 drops of 5% ninhydrin in ethanol are added. The sample is left<br>
in a heat block at about 120°C for 4 to 6 min. A blue or violet color is a positive<br>
indication of the presence of free amine], and in case the reaction did not reach<br>
completion, the reaction solution was further reacted for 30 min to 1 hr. Upon<br>
completion of the reaction, the reaction solution was removed by filtration, washed with<br>
3x20 ml DMF, reacted with deblocking solution (2x 20 ml) for 5 min in each time, and<br>
thoroughly washed with DMF.<br>
Continuous introduction of amino acids was performed according to the<br>
method described above, and the reaction started from Pro32 of C-terminus of calcitonin<br>
and proceeded in order, and after the introduction of protected amino acid, removal of<br>
Nsc or Fmoc was repeatedly conducted using deblocking solution. After Nsc-Cys(Trt)<br>
was introduced, the peptide was reacted with 3x 20 ml of 2% hydrazine solution for 10-<br>
30 min to remove ivDde and Nsc, and then the resin was filtered and sufficiently<br>
washed with 4x20 ml DMF, 4x20 ml DCM and 4x20 ml DMF. Fmoc-OSu(5.0 eq)<br>
dissolved in 20 ml of DMF was put to 'the reactor, thoroughly mixed for 1 to 2 hr to<br>
allow Fmoc to be introduced to the amines on 1,11-positions, respectively. Progress of<br>
the reaction was checked by Kaiser test, and when determined as being completed, the<br>
reaction solution was removed via filtration, sufficiently washed with 4x20 ml DMF<br>
and 4x20 ml DCM, dried under-nitrogen stream to obtain peptide-attached resin 8.5g.<br>
1,7 disulfide bond could be formed by Ij oxidation. The peptide resin<br>
obtained as above was put in 150 ml filterable peptide reactor, 50 ml DMF was poured<br>
and allowed to maintain equilibrium for 30 min. 0.1M IT in 50ml DMF was further<br>
added to the reactor, mixed well for 2 hrs to perform oxidation. Progress of the<br>
reaction was monitored with HPLC, and upon completion of the reaction, filtration and<br>
washing with 5x50 ml DMF and 5x50 ml ascorbic acid for 5 min in each time, was<br>
conducted to completely remove the residual k Additionally, the peptide resin was<br>
washed with 3x20 ml DMF, 3x20 ml DCM, 3x20 ml MeOH and 3x20 ml heptane, dried<br>
under nitrogen, vacuum dried for 6 hrs to obtain dried peptide-attached resin 8.1g.<br>
Said dried resin was reacted with 80 ml cleavage solution<br>
 (2.5:2.5:95=TIS:water:TFA) at ordinary temperature for 1.5 hr, the resin was removed<br>
and resulting peptide was washed with about 10 ml of TFA. The washing and filtrate<br>
were collected and added to 500 ml of ether, subjected to centrifuge to precipitate<br>
formed floating material, and additionally washed with 3x200 ml ether via centrifuge.<br>
The precipitate was dried under nitrogen to obtain dried peptide mixture 4.8g, and this<br>
mixture was purified by prep-HPLC, and subjected to lyophilization to obtain 896mg of<br>
1,11-diFmoc-salmon calcitonin. Targeted site of the peptide prepared in this Example<br>
