				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to access methods used in communications systems,<br>
including both wireline and wireless communications systems. However, for purposes of<br>
explanation and not limitation, the following description is in the context of a radio<br>
communication system as one example application of the invention.<br>
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY<br>
A radio packet data system includes an access network (AN), a plurality of access<br>
terminals (AT), and the air interface defined between the two. The AN may further comprise<br>
a plurality of base stations or sectors, each of the base stations/sectors having an associated<br>
radio "footprint" that covers a certain geographical area, which may overlap with those of<br>
neighboring base stations/sectors. Radio resources are allocated to ATs based on the signal<br>
conditions that the ATs experience, requirements of the ATs, and other factors.<br>
Resource allocation is closely linked to the specific multiple access technique used by the<br>
access terminals and the access network which defines their interface. As the generations of<br>
radio communication systems have evolved 1G→2G→3G→), different multiple access<br>
techniques have been explored and adopted. Generally, these access techniques have been<br>
divided into three general categories including: frequency division multiple access (FDMA)<br>
used in first generation (1G) cellular systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) used in<br>
second generation (2G) cellular systems, and code division multiple access (CDMA) used in<br>
third generation (3G) cellular systems. In general, a multiple access technique defines how<br>
multiple users access a common communications resource, which in a radio communications<br>
context, usually includes radio bandwidth.<br>
There are several potential multiple access techniques for fourth generation (4G) cellular<br>
systems including direct spread-code division multiple access (DS-CDMA), multi-carrier<br>
(MC) DS-CDMA, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal<br>
frequency code division multiplexing (OFCDM), and interleaved Frequency Division<br>
Multiple Access (IFDMA). Each of these multiple access schemes has strengths and<br>
weaknesses in terms of practical implementation and performance for various channel<br>
conditions. For example, the frequency domain approaches, such as OFDM and OFCDM,<br>
are generally more suitable for more highly-dispersive channels when the mobile access<br>
2<br><br>
terminal is moving with low to moderate speed. On the other hand, the time domain/code<br>
domain approaches, such as DS-CDMA and MC-DS-CDMA, are more robust when the<br>
mobile access terminal moves at higher speeds. They are also easier to synchronize, and in<br>
many typical conditions, may perform at the same level as or better than OFDM and<br>
OFCDM.<br>
Because of the wide range of application and deployment scenarios expected in 4G with<br>
bandwidth requirements exceeding of 100 MHz, it is unlikely that a single multiple access<br>
technique with fixed bandwidth can well serve all scenarios. Past experience also suggests<br>
that lengthy standardization processes eventually lead to a compromise that accommodates<br>
multiple solutions. Therefore, it is important to design an air interface in which a mixture of<br>
multiple access schemes can be accommodated within an entire wideband channel. Although<br>
the ITU's IMT-2000 standard encompasses three different "modes", namely, UMTS FDD,<br>
UMTS TDD and CDMA 2000, they are effectively three distinct multiple access approaches<br>
that are very difficult to integrate. Nor does the IMT-2000 standard permit combining<br>
frequency domain approaches such as OFDM and OFCDM with time domain/code domain<br>
schemes like DS-CDMA.<br>
The present invention provides a unified and flexible signaling method and radio interface<br>
that accommodates different multiple access schemes. Each user data unit is associated with<br>
one of several different multiple access techniques. Each multiple access technique defines<br>
how multiple users access common communications resources and has two key aspects. The<br>
first aspect is the processing of the user data unit into suitable discrete samples. The<br>
processing may involve operations such as spreading and code-multiplexing in the case of<br>
CDMA, the inverse Discrete Fourier Transform in the case of OFDM and OFCDM, or the<br>
combination of these and other various operations. The second aspect of a multiple access<br>
technique is the assignment of the discrete samples associated with each user data unit into<br>
one or more respective discrete signal blocks in the time-frequency plane. The term<br>
"discrete" in "discrete signal block" simply means that the signal block can be distinguished<br>
in some fashion from other signal blocks. Each discrete signal block also includes a time<br>
attribute and a frequency attribute and can be viewed as a radio resource container that<br>
contains a processed user data unit's samples. For example, in a traditional TDMA system,<br>
each of the multiple users is assigned a time slot and the entire available bandwidth within<br>
that time interval. In a traditional FDMA system, on the other hand, each of the multiple<br>
users is assigned a frequency band arid can communicate in that band at all times.<br>
3<br><br>
Discrete signal blocks carrying processed user data units having different associated<br>
multiple access techniques are grouped into a time-slot or packet for transmission over a<br>
communication channel. In one non-limiting, example application, that communication<br>
channel is a radio channel. The processed and grouped user data units may correspond to<br>
plural users or to the same user. The discrete time samples in the packet or time-slot are then<br>
preferably converted to a continuous time signal by an analog pulse shaping filter before<br>
transmission over the radio interface.<br>
The different multiple access techniques may fall into any of the three broad categories:<br>
FDMA techniques, TDMA techniques, and CDMA techniques. As will be appreciated by<br>
those skilled in the art, TDMA is an underlying multiple access technique upon which other<br>
multiple access techniques build. Example FDMA techniques include OFDM, OFCDM, and<br>
Interleaved-FDMA (IFDMA). Example CDMA techniques include DS-CDMA and multi-<br>
carrier DS-CDMA.<br>
In one non-limiting, example embodiment, a cyclic prefix may be added to the packet<br>
containing the grouped signal blocks before transmission over the communications channel to<br>
facilitate receiver processing. Each user data unit associated with a different multiple access<br>
technique may be processed into the frequency domain to generate frequency domain<br>
samples for most multiple access techniques. In those usual cases, those frequency domain<br>
samples are transformed into the time domain to generate discrete time samples. That<br>
processing into the frequency domain may be performed using a discrete Fourier transform<br>
(DFT) of appropriate length, using for example a fast Fourier transform (FFT), and<br>
transforming into the time domain is performed using an inverse discrete Fourier transform<br>
(IDFT) of appropriate length, e.g., using an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT).<br>
If a condition for the communication changes, e.g., a change in the communication<br>
channel or a change in service requested by the user, the multiple access technique associated<br>
with one or more of the user data units may be changed in response to the changed condition.<br>
This change is easily accommodated by the flexible signaling format in accordance with the<br>
present invention.<br>
A receiver receives over the radio interface a continuous signal including a group signal<br>
blocks having user data units associated with different associated multiple access techniques.<br>
The receiver may "blindly" detect which multiple access technique is associated with each<br>
user data unit. Alternatively, part or all of the multiple access technique aspects can be pre-<br>
determined during the opening handshake just before the communication is established, as is<br>
4<br><br>
done in the current generation of cellular systems. Such examples include time slot<br>
assignment for each of the multiple users in a TDMA system like GSM and the spreading<br>
code assignment in a CDMA system like WCDMA. The partial aspects of a multiple access<br>
technique that are not pre-determined have the flexibility of adapting to the changing<br>
environment. In this case, the unknown part of the multiple access technique associated with<br>
each user data unit may be blindly detected or communicated using control information sent<br>
along with each discrete signal block. Another alternative is to associate each user data unit<br>
with the unknown aspects of its multiple access technique in control information sent over a<br>
separate signaling channel.<br>
Once the discrete signal block assignments of the user data units are determined, the<br>
group of discrete signal blocks is filtered and sampled and the appropriate segment extracted.<br>
For most multiple access techniques, the discrete samples are discrete time samples which are<br>
transformed into frequency domain samples for subsequent processing. The frequency<br>
domain samples in the discrete signal blocks associated with each user data unit are processed<br>
in accordance with the associated multiple access technique to permit data corresponding to<br>
each user data unit to be extracted. For access point type nodes in a radio context, the<br>
receiver may employ a wideband receive filter. Alternatively, if the communications node is<br>
a mobile access terminal, a narrower, bandpass receive filter tuned to its desired frequency<br>
band may be employed.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following description sets forth specific details, such as particular embodiments,<br>
procedures, techniques, etc., for purposes of explanation and not limitation. But it will be<br>
appreciated by one skilled in the art that other embodiments may be employed apart from<br>
these specific details. For example, although the following description is facilitated using<br>
non-limiting examples, the present invention may be employed to in any system where<br>
multiple access techniques are used. In some instances, detailed descriptions of well-known<br>
methods, interfaces, circuits, and signaling are omitted so as not obscure the description with<br>
unnecessary detail. Moreover, individual blocks are shown in some of the figures. Those<br>
skilled in the art will appreciate that the functions of those blocks may be implemented using<br>
individual hardware circuits, using software programs and data, in conjunction with a suitably<br>
programmed digital microprocessor or general purpose computer, using application specific<br>
integrated circuitry (ASIC), and/or using one or more digital signal processors (DSPs).<br>
Figure 1 illustrates how different multiple access techniques allocate communication<br>
resources in a time-frequency plane. Each multiple access technique includes a time resource<br>
attribute and a frequency resource attribute. Each block corresponds to a discrete signal<br>
block of radio resources that includes a time resource attribute and a frequency resource<br>
attribute defined by its multiple access technique. Each discrete signal block can be used to<br>
carry one or more units of user data. The example, non-limiting multiple access techniques<br>
shown include: IFDMA, TDMA, CDMA on TDMA, FDMA, CDMA on FDMA, and a<br>
6<br><br>
hybrid. A hybrid multiple access, in which two or more different access techniques are used,<br>
may vary both time and frequency in allocating resources rather than just one or the other.<br>
The flexible signaling format in accordance with the present invention accommodates all<br>
these as well as other unforeseen and future multiple access techniques.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates in flow chart form example procedures that may be implemented at<br>
one or more nodes to transmit information using more than one multiple access technique. In<br>
step S1, a multiple access (MA) technique is associated with each user data unit, and each<br>
user data unit is process into discrete samples (step S2). Each "user data unit" includes an<br>
information-bearing discrete sample sequence corresponding to a particular user. Step S3<br>
describes optional processing user data units (if necessary based on the multiple access<br>
technique associated with the user data units) to generate corresponding frequency samples.<br>
The discrete samples for each user data unit are assigned to one or more discrete signal<br>
blocks (step S4). A discrete signal block is understood in the context of the time-frequency<br>
plane, (an example of a time-frequency plane is shown in Figure 1), and includes both a time<br>
communications resource and a frequency communications resource allocation corresponding<br>
to an area identified by one of the patterns shown in Figure 1. Discrete signal blocks<br>
containing multiple user data units with different associated multiple access techniques are<br>
grouped together into a single packet or time-slot (step S5). As described further below, a<br>
cyclic prefix (CP) may be added to that packet or time-slot (the cyclic prefix is optional).<br>
The packet samples (and any associated cyclic prefix) are passed through analog pulse<br>
shaping filter and transmitted with other packets over a communications channel (step S6).<br>
Figure 3 is a flow chart diagram that illustrates example procedures at a receiver for<br>
extracting user data from the flexible signaling structure transmitted in accordance with the<br>
procedures of Figure 2. The first step is to receive, filter, and sample the continuous signal<br>
transmitted over the radio interface, and then, extract a packet that includes the discrete signal<br>
blocks associated with the desired user data units (step S1). This time domain extraction is<br>
the first step of extracting the discrete signal blocks associated with the desired user data<br>
units from the time-frequency plane and may require the input from a control signal (A1) to<br>
determine the starting point and time duration of the extraction if such information has not<br>
been blindly detected or pre-determined at the receiver. Unless the entire packet is dedicated<br>
to one user and the transmitter processing did not involve IDFT processing, the extracted<br>
discrete time samples are to be transformed into frequency domain samples (step S2). For<br>
example, IFDMA, FDMA, AND hybrid techniques generally all require step S2, but a<br>
7<br><br>
TDMA technique may not. The frequency attribute of the discrete signal block assignment<br>
aspect of the multiple access technique associated with each user data unit is then determined,<br>
similarly to the time domain extraction, and the frequency samples associated with each user<br>
data unit are extracted (step S3), completing the discrete signal block extraction for the<br>
desired user data units. The discrete samples for each user data unit are then processed<br>
according to the processing aspect of the associated multiple access technique to extract the<br>
user information (step S4). Similarly, the processing aspect of a multiple access technique<br>
can be blindly detected or provided by a control signal (A2).<br>
Figure 4 illustrates an example communications system that implements the flexible<br>
signaling method and communications interface. Information is processed and sent from a<br>
sending node (or more than one sending node) over a communications interface 20 to one or<br>
more receiving nodes 30 using one or more communications channels. The communication<br>
channels may be wireless channels or wireline channels. The sending node(s) 10 includes a<br>
number of processing blocks which may be implemented using suitably configured or<br>
programmed electronic circuitry. Information from one or more users (block 40) along with<br>
communication conditions, requirements, and resources etc., associated with communicating<br>
that information (block 42) are provided. The multiple access technique for each user data<br>
unit is identified (block 44). Those user data units are processed based on their respective<br>
identified multiple access technique. Discrete signal blocks are formed that encapsulate user<br>
data units with different multiple access techniques into a single packet, and a cyclic prefix is<br>
preferably included with that packet to facilitate demodulation or decoding at the receiver<br>
(block 46). Further details of block 46 are described below in conjunction with Figure 5.<br>
The packet is appended to other data packets and transmitted by transmitter 48 over the<br>
communications interface 20 on one or more channels. The transmitter 48 may include an<br>
analog pulse shaping filter.<br>
The receiver 50 in the receiving node(s) 30 receives a signal over the channel(s) and may<br>
include a wideband filter or a narrowband filter depending on the application. For example,<br>
in a mobile radio communications context, a base station receiver might employ a wideband<br>
filter while a mobile access terminal receiver might employ a narrowband filter tuned to its<br>
desired frequency band. A packet extractor 52 identifies individual packets and removes the<br>
cyclic prefix if one is present. The individual packet is sampled in block 54, and the sample<br>
signals are transformed into the frequency domain in block 56 (optional depending on access<br>
technique used). Each block of frequency domain data is demodulated using an appropriate<br>
8<br><br>
technique corresponding to its associated multiple access technique (block 58). The obtained<br>
user information is then further processed and/or used (block 60) by one or more<br>
applications.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates in more detail the functions performed in block 46 for each user data<br>
unit at the transmitter. The dashed-line blocks are optional depending on the multiple access<br>
technique. Code multiplexed user information is selected for processing in code multiplexer<br>
70 to generate an input symbol sequence in the time domain. The time domain sequence is<br>
converted in the fast Fourier transform (FFT) block 72 to generate a frequency domain<br>
sequence mapped to appropriate frequency sub-carriers in block 74 and converted back to the<br>
time domain in the inverse FFT (IFFT) block 76. The resulting discrete samples are<br>
combined with those corresponding to other user data units to form a packet. A cyclic prefix<br>
may be appended to this packet before it undergoes baseband filtering (block 80) and scaling,<br>
timing control, and frequency conversion to RF (block 82) for transmission.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates an example of a flexible signaling format that may be used to transmit<br>
data packets that contain one or more different multiple access schemes. With this signaling<br>
structure, samples associated with one or more various multiple access techniques may be<br>
encapsulated in a unified format into one packet. A data payload is the part of a packet that<br>
includes the previously-described, processed and grouped user data units. Each data payload,<br>
also labeled as a " segment" in Figure 6, may be optionally coupled with a corresponding<br>
cyclic prefix (CP) to form a single time slot or packet. Multiple packets or time-slots are<br>
appended together as shown. Each data payload includes Lp time samples, and each cyclic<br>
prefix includes Lc time samples. The duration of a single time-slot is thus (Lc + LP)TS<br>
seconds, where Ts is the sampling period. The total bandwidth corresponding to Lp frequency<br>
samples is 1/TS Hz.<br>
The frequency domain representation of one data payload or segment is shown in the<br>
lower part of Figure 6 and may include one or more subsets. In conjunction with their time<br>
domain assignment attribute, these subsets form the discrete signal blocks that carry the<br>
processed user data units. The term discrete signal block includes, but is not limited to<br>
frequency sub-bands, and each discrete signal block includes a time resource attribute and a<br>
frequency resource attribute. For example, discrete signal block 1 is associated with a time<br>
resource attribute 1 (Tl) and a frequency resource attribute 1 (Fl). Each discrete signal block<br>
may correspond to data from different users using different multiple access techniques.<br>
Discrete signal blocks 1, 2, 3 and 4 are shown in the example in Figure 6 separated by<br>
9<br><br>
corresponding guard bands. Those discrete signal blocks may be readily transformed into the<br>
time domain using the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT). It should be understood<br>
that appending a cyclic prefix is an optional feature and may not even be required, for<br>
example, in the case of DS-CDMA. But a cyclic prefix ensures a uniform format for all<br>
multiple access schemes and helps facilitate the necessary conversion between time and<br>
frequency domains. If a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to the implement the DFT, the<br>
payload length Lp is usually chosen to be a power of two.<br>
In one example implementation, each discrete signal block can be viewed as a sub-set of<br>
sub-carriers. Those sub-carriers in the discrete signal block may be contiguous or non-<br>
contiguous. Even greater flexibility can be achieved by aggregating multiple time-slots or<br>
discrete signal blocks. For example, multiple DS-CDMA carriers can be placed into<br>
contiguous discrete signal block to increase the data rate, while maintaining better<br>
orthogonality of the narrower discrete signal block bandwidth. When several consecutive<br>
time-slots are aggregated, the discrete signal block bandwidth decreases proportionally, and<br>
therefore, more sub-carriers may be accommodated.<br>
It may also be desirable to accommodate variable length packets or time slots. For<br>
example, there may be instances when it is more effective or efficient to use either longer<br>
packets or shorter packets. Figure 7A shows a longer data payload as compared to the<br>
payload shown in Figure 6, which is repeated in Figure 7B for easy comparison. The longer<br>
packet or time slot is twice as long corresponding to (2Lc + 2Lp)Ts seconds, where Ts is the<br>
sampling period. The total bandwidth corresponding to 2LP frequency samples is 1/TS Hz.<br>
One example where this kind of flexibility is useful comes from the hybrid access mode<br>
shown in Figure 1. The shaded discrete signal block 1 corresponds to 2/3 of the hybrid<br>
resources in the time domain but only ¼ in the frequency domain, as can be seen in the lower<br>
right-hand corner of Figure 1. The bold-blocked discrete signal blocks 2 and 3 take up half of<br>
the frequency bandwidth but only 1/3 of the resources in the time domain (Tl). Figure 7<br>
shows how different hybrid users can be readily accommodated with variable length<br>
payloads.<br>
Figure 8 shows the encapsulation of different multiple access schemes and different users<br>
into one packet. There are three different access techniques used in this example including:<br>
OFDM (shown on the left side under frequency domain), DS-CDMA (shown in the middle)<br>
and OFCDM (shown on the right of the figure). The OFDM technique is employed by group<br>
1, user 1 data, and group 1, user 2 data. Different user groups may correspond to different<br>
10<br><br>
applications or services that have distinct requirements. The CDMA technique is used by<br>
group 2, user 1 data and user 2 data. The OFCDM technique is used by group 3, user 1 data,<br>
group 3, user 2data, and group 3, user 3 data. The OFDM group and user data is simply<br>
concatenated. The group 2, user 1 and user 2 data are code-multiplexed and transformed into<br>
the frequency domain using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), generating group 2<br>
frequency samples. The group 3, user 1, 2, and 3 data are multiplexed into group 3 frequency<br>
samples without the need for any DFT since the user data is already in the frequency domain.<br>
All three OFDM, DS-CDMA, OFCDM data blocks are then converted into the time domain<br>
using the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) to generate a payload of multiplexed<br>
discrete time samples. To combat inter-symbol interference and to improve demodulation at<br>
the receiver, a cyclic prefix may be added to the multiplexed discrete time samples to<br>
generate a signal time slot or data packet for transmission over the radio channel.<br>
The format and processings of Figure 8 are appropriate in the non-limiting example<br>
context of radio communications for a radio base station transmitter transmitting to multiple<br>
mobile access terminals in the downlink direction. The format is also suitable for uplink<br>
transmissions from individual mobile access terminals, as shown in Figure 9. Since there is<br>
only one user 1 in group 2, and assuming only one access technique (here CDMA) is used for<br>
the user, the group 2 user 1 data is DFTed and placed in the CDMA block. The procedures<br>
are the same as described for Figure 8 except that the other blocks are unoccupied and are<br>
used by other users with uplink transmissions. At the base station, the transmissions from<br>
multiple access terminals are combined to complete packet or time slot.<br>
Figure 10 illustrates one example approach for modulating and processing data units that<br>
employ different multiple access techniques into a single packet. In this example, 768<br>
information bits are turbo-coded at a rate of 1/2 to generate 1536 coded bits. These bits are<br>
interleaved and then QPSK modulated to generate 768 QPSK symbols. For OFDM type<br>
access, these 768 symbols are treated as 768 sub-carriers and inserted into a data word 1024<br>
sub-carriers long. The remaining 256 sub-carriers come from another user. The 1024<br>
carriers in the word are converted from the frequency domain into the time domain using an<br>
IDFT of length 1024 to generate 1024 time samples. A cyclic prefix may be added before<br>
transmitting the data packet including the 1024 time samples.<br>
If the multiple access technique corresponds to OFCDM or MC/DS-CDMA, (both<br>
employ multi-code spreading), the 768 QPSK symbols are spread using three different codes,<br>
each of which is 1024 chips long. The spread symbols are then summed along with a fourth<br>
11<br><br>
code used to spread the symbols from another user. The network can assign any number of<br>
new codes to one user or another user as the network determines as long as codes are<br>
available. For OFCDM, 1024 chips summed in the summer are treated as 1024 sub-carriers,<br>
which are then converted to the time domain using IFDT, and a cyclic prefix is added to the<br>
1024 time samples.<br>
For MC/DS-CDMA type access, the 1024 chips generated from the four codes by the<br>
summer are divided into four sections x1[n] - x4[n]. Each of the four sections has a length of<br>
256 chips. Each section is converted into the frequency domain using a DFT to generate four<br>
groups of sub-carriers, each with a length of 256. The four sections combined include 1024<br>
sub-carriers which are transformed using the IFDT into the time domain to generate 1024<br>
time samples. A cyclic prefix is added to those time samples before transmission.<br>
An example receiver processing in accordance with the flexible signaling format is shown<br>
in Figure 11 following the transmitter example shown in Figure 10. In a radio environment,<br>
the received signal is typically a multipath signal which is also distorted by the radio channel.<br>
The signal includes multiple packets which must be identified, extracted, sampled, and any<br>
cyclic prefix removed. Each extracted packet includes 1024 transmitter time samples. A<br>
DFT of length 1024 is performed on those time samples to generate 1024 sub-carriers in the<br>
frequency domain. For OFDM and OFCDM, those 1024 sub-carriers are simply provided to<br>
an OFDM or OFCDM demodulator, respectively. For multiple carrier DS-CDMA, the 1024<br>
sub-carriers are divided into four sections X1 [k] - X4 [k]. Each section of 256 sub-carriers is<br>
then transformed into the time domain using the IDFT to generate four sections of time<br>
samples x1 [n] - x4 [n], each having 256 time samples. Those four sections of time samples<br>
are provided to a DS-CDMA demodulator for demodulation.<br>
Referring now to a non-limiting example application to radio communications, Figure 12<br>
shows a radio packet data communication system 200 which includes mobile access terminals<br>
(ATs) 202a and 202b, a plurality of base stations 204a-204e, and a base station controller<br>
206. As used herein, the term "access terminal" may include, but is not limited to, a cellular<br>
radio transceiver, a Personal Communications System (PCS) terminal, radio transceiver, a<br>
personal digital assistant (PDA) that can include a radio transceiver, pager, Internet/intranet<br>
access, Web browser, organizer, calendar and/or a GPS receiver, laptop or palmtop receiver,<br>
or an appliance that includes a radio transceiver. The base station may be associated with<br>
service "sectors." The access terminals 202 a, b communicate via the base stations 204a-204e<br>
base stations which handle radio communication with the access terminals 202a and 202b.<br>
12<br><br>
The base stations 204a-204e also communicate with the base station controller 206 which<br>
includes stored program control and processor resources for managing the radio<br>
communications system 200.<br>
Figure 13 shows a baseband equivalent of a transceiver architecture that may be<br>
employed in the cellular communication system shown in Figure 12 or any other type of<br>
radio communications system. Data symbols from multiple users are multiplexed and then<br>
encapsulated at the transmitter A (e.g., in one or more base stations) into blocks of discrete<br>
samples according to their respective multiple access schemes, for example, as illustrated in<br>
Figures 5-7. Once the discrete (sampled) time representation of each data packet (or block,<br>
time slot, etc.) to be transmitted is determined, a corresponding continuous waveform can be<br>
synthesized by passing the discrete time samples through a wideband, pulse shaping filter.<br>
The receiver (such as an access terminal in the cellular system example) can use a<br>
wideband, front-end filter matched to the transmit pulse shape. The filtered output is sampled<br>
for discrete processing. Such discrete processing includes unwrapping the packet using a<br>
combination of DFT and IFDT and demodulation techniques depending upon the multiple<br>
access technique and modulation technique employed for each data packet. See as one<br>
example the process shown in Figure 11. The multipath, channel-distorted, received signal is<br>
the sum of several copies of the original transmitted signal with different delays and complex<br>
coefficients. The receiver first extracts the section of the signal that contains one packet of<br>
samples for all multipaths so that the extraction corresponds to the cyclic convolution of the<br>
transmit signal with the channel's impulse response. The DFT converts the time samples into<br>
the frequency domain, at which point demodulation can be performed for frequency-domain<br>
multiple-access schemes such as OF(C)DM, or frequency sub-bands can be isolated for<br>
further processing for multi-carrier DS-CDMA or a mixture of time and frequency domain<br>
schemes.<br>
Alternatively, the receiver may use a narrower, bandpass filter to extract only the<br>
frequency bands that contain the intended data to reduce the sampling rate. This may be<br>
preferred for low rate access terminals that can be adequately served by narrowband<br>
transmission. In a multi-carrier DS/CDMA example, data directed to a low rate terminal may<br>
be allocated to only one of the frequency bands. Instead of receiving the entire wideband<br>
signal, the receiver may use a narrowband filter tuned to the corresponding frequency bands<br>
and treat the received signal as a single carrier to simplify reception and processing.<br>
13<br><br>
Different techniques may be used to "unwrap" the received signal and to detect which<br>
types of processing need to be employed to demodulate the information in a particular data<br>
packet. First, the receiver can "blindly" detect the modulation scheme that goes with each<br>
data unit included in a data packet. For example, the receiver may perform the demodulation<br>
and decoding for every possible hypothesis of the various aspects of the multiple access<br>
schemes and compute a metric that reflects the likelihood of that hypothesis. The hypothesis<br>
with the highest likelihood is chosen. A common likelihood metric is the Cyclic Redundancy<br>
Check (CRC) bit that is computed from a sequence of redundancy bits appended to an<br>
encoded data packet. An example for blindly detecting the starting point and interval of a<br>
variable-length TDMA packet can be found in US patent 6,594,793, "Methods And Systems<br>
For Multiplexing And Decoding Variable Length Messages In Digital Communications<br>
Systems," the disclosure of which is incorporated here by reference. Alternatively, the<br>
multiple access technique associated with each data unit may be conveyed along with the data<br>
packet or by a control signal sent over a control/signaling channel. The latter approach is<br>
illustrated in Figure 14. Here, a data request for transmission from a user (a channel request)<br>
is transmitted via a control channel to a radio resource scheduling entity, e.g., a base station<br>
controller. That data request includes a number of factors including, for example, requested<br>
data rate and multiple access preference(s). When the channel is allocated in response to that<br>
data request, included in that channel allocation message is the multiple access technique<br>
associated with that data unit along with the time slot, frequency, code, or allocated access<br>
resource corresponding to the preferred multiple access.<br>
As described above, various modulation and multiple access schemes exhibit unique<br>
characteristics and are suitable in different transmission scenarios depending on factors such<br>
as (not limited) channel conditions, interference, receiver complexity, user preference, and<br>
user demand. Since these factors may change, and some factors may change rapidly, the<br>
multiple access schemes from time slot to time slot may have to be adapted accordingly.<br>
Such adaptation may be achieved by providing control signals that carry explicit multiple<br>
access scheme information. In addition to signaling channels to provide this kind of<br>
information, a physical pilot channel must be present in each sub-band for synchronization<br>
and channel estimation. For frequency domain multiple access schemes, such as OFDM and<br>
OFCDM, that pilot channel is usually in the form of pilot symbols periodically inserted in the<br>
sub-carriers. For time domain schemes such as multiple and single carrier DS-CDMA, it is<br>
usually in the form of Pseudo-random sequences multiplexed in the time domain. Regardless<br>
14<br><br>
of which form it takes, the pilot channel must uniquely identify the sub-band it is associated<br>
with. The pilot and signaling channel structures should be designed in such a way that each<br>
sub-band is self-contained carrier cases used to carry data intended for narrow band<br>
terminals. Although signals from other sub-bands may be used to improve channel<br>
estimation or may contain useful system information, a low cost, low rate, narrow band<br>
device should be able to function without them.<br>
In summary, the approach described provides a flexible air interface structure with a<br>
blocked format in both time and frequency domains defining the basic unit of the air<br>
interface. Cyclic prefix and DFT-based discrete representation/processing enables easy<br>
manipulation and transformation between the time and frequency domains. With such<br>
structure, the various multiple access schemes such as OFDM, OFCDM, IFDMA and (Multi-<br>
Carrier) DS-CDMA can be multiplexed and encapsulated into a common packet. A simple<br>
and unified transceiver architecture that uses either a single wideband RF front-end filter or a<br>
narrowband bandpass filter tuned to the desired frequency band further simplifies the<br>
communication hardware design. When operated adaptively with suitable control signaling,<br>
the overall communication network performance and robustness can be greatly improved by<br>
dynamically selecting the most suitable multiple access schemes according to factors such as<br>
channel condition, equipment preference, and service requirements, etc.<br>
