FABRIC -CONDITIONING COMPOSITION<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the<br>
manner in which it is to be performed.	<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>

GRANTED<br>

WO  2004/027002	PCT/EP2003/009185<br>
FABRIC CONDITIONING COMPOSITIONS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to fabric conditioning compositions, and in particular highly concentrated fabric conditioning compositions comprising an unsaturated and a saturated quaternary ammonium softening material.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It is well known to provide liquid fabric conditioning compositions which soften in the rinse cycle.<br>
Such compositions comprise less than 7.5% by weight of softening active, in which case the composition is defined as "dilute", from 7.5% to about 3 0% by weight of active in which case the compositions are defined as "concentrated" or more than about 3 0% by weight of active, in which case the composition is defined as "super-concentrated".<br>
Concentrated and super-concentrated compositions are desirable since these require less packaging and are therefore environmentally more compatible than dilute or semi-dilute compositions.<br>
A problem frequently associated with concentrated and superconcentrated compositions, as defined above, is that the product is not stable upon storage, especially when stored at high temperatures.  Instability can manifest<br><br>
WO 2004/027002	PCT/EP2003/009185<br>
itself as a thickening of the product upon storage, even to the point that the product is no longer pourable.<br>
The problem of thickening upon storage is particularly apparent in concentrated and superconcentrated fabric softening compositions comprising an ester-linked quaternary ammonium fabric softening material having one or more fully saturated alkyl chains.<br>
However, it is desirable to use ester-linked compounds due to their inherent biodegradability and to use substantially fully saturated quaternary ammonium fabric softening compounds due to their excellent softening capabilities and because they are more stable to oxidative degradation (which can lead to malodour generation) than partially saturated or fully unsaturated quaternary ammonium softening compounds.<br>
Of the types of ester-linked quaternary ammonium materials known, it is desirable to use those based on triethanolamine which produce at least some mono-ester linked component and at least some tri-ester linked component since the raw material has a low melting temperature which enables the manufacturing process of the composition to occur at low temperatures.  This reduces difficulties associated with high temperature handling, transport and processing of the raw material and compositions produced therefrom.<br>
Certain of the abovementioned problems have previously been addressed.  For instance, it is known to inhibit thickening of concentrated and superconcentrated compositions by providing an electrolyte within the composition.  However,<br><br>
WO  2004/027002	PCT/EP2003/009185<br>
electrolytes are known to have a destabilising influence on such compositions upon storage.<br>
It has also been proposed in WO-A1-95/16766 to provide a stable highly concentrated fabric conditioning composition containing a mixed active system.  A first component of the active system has an iodine value of less than 10 and a second component has an iodine value of from 2 0 to 100.  On page 4 of the description, it is clearly stated that the first component must be at least 80% diester and less than 20% monoester.  Furthermore, on page 2 it is taught that the second component is a structurally different material from the first component.  This document only teaches that the presence of an unsaturated component enables formulation of fabric conditioning compositions having a higher concentration.<br>
There is no teaching nor any disclosure of optimising the mono-ester content of the unsaturated component to further improve stability of highly concentrated compositions.<br>
Furthermore, by introducing high levels of unsaturation into the formulation, the product can become liable to oxidative degradation, leading to rancid or fatty malodours forming on storage - particularly at high temperatures.<br>
US4439335 discloses mixtures of quaternary ammonium materials, one of which is a di (amidoethyl)methyl quaternary ammonium salt and/or imidazolinium salt.<br><br>
WO  2004/027002	PCT/EP2003/00918<br>
US5501806 also discloses mixtures of softening actives to achieve highly stable, highly concentrated systems.  It discloses mixtures of components A and B at a total level of 25 to 50% by weight of active ingredient).  In all examples and the claims, A is a mineral or organic acid salt of an amidoamine.<br>
US4963274 discloses concentrated formulations comprising mixtures of active ingredients.<br>
EP-B1-0593542 discloses on page 4 line 51 a mixture of Tetranyl AHT-1 and Tetranyl AT-1 in a ratio of 4:1.  The combined mixture is present in an amount of 5% by weight.<br>
Surprisingly, we have now found that a highly concentrated softening composition in which saturated and unsaturated softening species based on triethanolamine are present and in which the level of the softening components of the saturated species in the formulation (particularly the hardened di- and tri- esters components) are maximised whilst the amount of unsaturated species present is optimised to within a specific range provides excellent softening performance, reduced product malodour generation and reduced instability.<br>
The disclosure of a mixture of saturated and unsaturated species in the prior art does not identify nor even suggest that by optimising the monoester species of the unsaturated material to within a particular range, significant benefits in terms of stability without loss of softening and odour control can be achieved.<br><br>
WO  2004/027002	PCT/EP2003/009185<br>
 Objects of the Invention<br>
The present invention seeks to overcome one or more of the problems and to provide one or more of the benefits desired by consumers mentioned above.<br>
It is particularly preferred to provide a highly concentrated fabric conditioning composition which is aesthetically pleasing to consumers, pourable, stable, and which provide good softening characteristics to fabrics.<br>
Statement of Invention<br>
Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided a concentrated, aqueous fabric softening composition comprising:<br>
(a)	an ester-linked quaternary ammonium fabric softening material comprising at least one mono-ester linked component and at least one tri-ester linked component, the material being derived from fatty groups having an iodine value of from 0 to 3; and<br>
(b)	an ester-linked quaternary ammonium fabric softening material comprising at least one mono-ester linked component and at least one tri-ester linked component, the material being derived from fatty groups having an iodine value of from 2 0 to 140,<br><br>
WO  2004/027002	PCT/EP2003/009185<br>
wherein the total amount of unsaturated monoester component of material (b) is from 4 to 2 0% by weight of the total amount of (a) and (b).<br>
The invention also provides a method of preparing a composition comprising material (a) , material (b) , an aqueous carrier and an inorganic electrolyte comprising co-melting materials (a) and (b), adding the co-melted ingredients to a heated aqueous seat with low shear agitation, allowing the mixture to cool and adding an inorganic electrolyte to the cooled mixture.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
It has surprisingly been found that with mixtures of saturated and unsaturated quaternary ammonium materials based on triethanolamine, when the unsaturated quaternary ammonium softening material is formulated to contain levels of the unsaturated mono-ester component within a particular range the composition has excellent stability benefits without significantly adversely affecting the softening performance or odour.<br>
Quaternary ammonium materials<br>
The quaternary ammonium material comprises a mixture of at least one saturated and at least one unsaturated quaternary ammonium material.<br><br>
WO  2004/027002<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/009185<br><br>
The level of mono-ester component of the unsaturated softening material is within the range 4% to 2 0% by weight based on the total weight of softening materials present in the composition, more preferably 6 to 15%, most preferably 7 to 14%, e.g. 7.5 to 13%.<br>
Both the unsaturated and the saturated materials are preferably represented by the following general formula:<br><br>
wherein each R  is  independently selected from a C5-35  alkyl or alkenyl  group,   R    represents  a C1-4  alkyl,   C2-4  alkenyl  or aC1-4  hydroxyalkyl  group,<br><br>
n is O or a number selected from 1 to 4, m is 1, 2 or 3 and denotes the number of moieties to which it relates that pend<br>
directly from the N atom, and X is an anionic group, such<br>
as halides or alkyl sulphates, e.g. chloride, methyl sulphate or ethyl sulphate.<br><br>
WO  2004/027002	PCT/EP2003/009185<br>
The saturated species is derived from a parent fatty acid or acyl compound having an iodine value of from 0 to 3, more preferably 0 to 2, most preferably 0 to 1.<br>
Especially preferred materials within this class are di-alkyl esters of triethanol ammonium methyl sulphate.  A commercial example of a compound within this formula is Tetranyl AHT-1 (di-hardened tallow ester of triethanol ammonium methyl sulphate 85% active), ex Kao corporation.<br>
The unsaturated species is derived from a parent fatty acid or acyl compound having an iodine value of from 2 0 to 140, more preferably 25 to 100, most preferably 3 0 to 60.<br>
Preferred materials within this class include the following from Tetranyl series: AOT-1 (di-oleic ester of triethanol ammonium methyl sulphate 80% active), Ll/90 (partially hardened tallow ester of triethanol ammonium methyl sulphate 90% active), all supplied by Kao corporation.  Other unsaturated quaternary ammonium materials include Rewoquat<br>
WE15 (C10-C20 3.nd C16-C18 unsaturated fatty acid reaction products with triethanolamine dimethyl sulphate guaternised 90% active) and Rewoquat WE18 (partially hardened tallow quaternary ester of triethanolamine) both ex Witco Corporation, Varisoft WE16 (ex Goldschmidt) and Stepantex VK90 (ex Stepan).<br>
In the unsaturated species, it is preferred that the cis isomer:trans isomer weight ratio of the material is 50:50 or more, more preferably 60:40 or more, most preferably 70:30 or more, e.g. 85:15 or more.<br><br>
WO 2004/027002	PC    /EP2003/009I85<br>
Preferably at least 40%, more preferably 50%, most preferably 60% by weight, e.g. 70% by weight of the mixture of the softening materials comprises the fully saturated material.<br>
The iodine value of the parent fatty acid or acyl compound is measured according to the method set out in respect of parent fatty acids in WO-Al-O1/46513.<br>
In the context of the present invention, reference to the iodine value of the quaternary ammonium material, means the iodine value of the parent fatty acid or acyl compound from which the quaternary ammonium material is derived.<br>
The level of polyunsaturation in material (b) is preferably less than 5%, more preferably less than 2.5%, most preferably less than 1% by weight of material (b).  It is preferred that substantially all unsaturation in material (b) is mono-unsaturation.<br>
In order to achieve the desired mixture of saturated and unsaturated softening materials and unsaturated monoester component, a skilled person will readily understand that the saturated quaternary ammonium material can be mixed with an unsaturated softening material and that the iodine value and level of mono-ester quaternary ammonium component of the unsaturated quaternary ammonium material will affect the amount of unsaturated softening material that should be present in the composition.<br><br>
WO 2004/027002	PCT/EP2003/009185<br><br>
Calculation of Unsaturated Mono-ester Linked Component of the Quaternary Ammonium Material<br>
The quantitative analysis of overall mono-ester linked<br>
component of the quaternary ammonium material (b) is carried<br>
13<br>
out through the use of Quantitative  C NMR spectroscopy<br>
with inverse gated H decoupling scheme, as follows:<br>
The sample of known mass of the quaternary ammonium raw material is first dissolved in a known volume of CDCl3 along with a known amount of an assay material such as<br>
13<br>
naphthalene.  A  C NMR spectrum of this solution is then<br>
recorded using both an inverse gated decoupling scheme and a relaxation agent.  The inverse gated decoupling scheme is used to ensure that any Overhauser effects are suppressed whilst the relaxation agent is used to ensure that the negative consequences of the long t1 relaxation times are overcome (i.e. adequate signal-to-noise can be achieved in a reasonable timescale).<br>
The signal intensities of characteristic peaks of both the carbon atoms in the quaternary ammonium material and the naphthalene are used to calculate the concentration of the total mono-ester linked component of the quaternary ammonium material.  In the quaternary ammonium material, the signal for calculating the concentration of the mono-ester quaternary ammonium species is represented by the carbon of the nitrogen-methyl group on the quaternary ammonium head group.  The chemical shift of the nitrogen-methyl group varies slightly due to the different degree of<br><br>
WO 2004/027002	PCT/EP2003/009185<br><br>
esterification; characteristic chemical shifts for the mono-di- and tri-ester links are 48.28, 47.97 and 47.76 ppm respectively.  Any of the peaks due to the napthalene carbons that are free of interference from other components can then be used to calculate the mass of total mono-ester linked component present in the sample as follows:-<br><br>
where MassMQ = mass of mono-ester linked quaternary ammonium material of component (b) in mg/ml, massNaph = mass naphthalene in mg/ml, I = peak intensity, N -  number of contributing nuclei and M = relative molecular mass.  The relative molecular mass of naphthalene used is 128.17 and the relative molecular mass of the total mono-ester linked component of the quaternary ammonium material is taken as 526.<br>
The weight percentage of total mono-ester linked component of quaternary ammonium material (b) in the raw material can thus be calculated:<br>
% of total mono-ester linked quaternary ammonium material in the raw material of component (b) = (MassMQ / mass HT-TEA) ^ 100<br>
where mass HT-TEA =.total mass of the quaternary ammonium material (b) and both mass Mass MQ mass HT-TEA  expressed as mg/ml.<br><br>
WO  2004/027002	PCT/EP2003/009185<br><br>
For a discussion of the NMR technique, see "100 and More Basic NMR Experiments", S Braun, H-0 Kalinowski, S Berger,<br>
1st edition, pages 234-236.<br>
For the purposes of the calculation of the monoester component of material (b), the level of polyunsaturation is assumed to be negligible and the unsaturation is assumed to occur equally between the mono-ester, di-ester and tri-ester components of material (b).<br>
Thus, from the total monoester value of material (b) calculated as above, the amount of unsaturated mono-ester component of the quaternary ammonium material (b) can be calculated based on the iodine value of the parent fatty acid or fatty acyl compound from which material (b) is derived.<br>
Prom the iodine value, the relative ratio of saturated to unsaturated hydrocarbyl chains in material (b) is simply calculated.  Based on this calculation, the proportion of unsaturated mono-ester component based on the total mono¬ester component of material (b) is also simply calculated.<br>
Since saturated softening material (a) contains substantially no unsaturated chains, this does not affect the total amount of unsaturated mono-ester component of the quaternary ammonium material present.<br>
The percentage by weight of the unsaturated mono-ester component of the quaternary ammonium material (b) is then calculated by dividing the result obtained above (for the<br><br>
WO 2004/027002	PCT/EP2003/009185<br><br>
unsaturated mono-ester component) by the total amount of quaternary ammonium materials (a) and (b) .<br>
For instance, pure oleic acid (C18 acid having 100% unsaturation) is taken to have an iodine value of about 90. Thus, if material (b) is derived from a C18 acid having an iodine value of 30, about 1/3 of the chains are unsaturated. If the total mono-ester component calculation (as described above) resulted in a mono-ester component of 42wt% of material (b), the total unsaturated mono-ester component of material (b) would be 1/3 of 42, i.e. 14%.  If materials (a) and (b) are provided in a weight ratio of 1:1, the total mono-ester component of unsaturated material (b) based on the total weight of materials (a) and (b) would be 7%.<br>
The total amount of softening materials (a) and (b) is preferably from 10 to 80% by weight of the total composition, more preferably from 11 to 70%, most preferably from 12 to 60% by weight, e.g. from 15 to 45% by weight.<br>
Fatty Alcohol<br>
Optionally and advantageously, one or more un-alkoxylated fatty alcohols are present in the composition.<br>
Preferred alcohols have a hydrocarbyl chain length of from 10 to 22 carbon atoms, more preferably 11 to 2 0 carbon atoms, most preferably 15 to 19 carbon atoms.<br>
The fatty alcohol may be saturated or unsaturated, though saturated fatty alcohols are preferred as these have been<br><br>
WO  2004/027002	PCT/EP2003/009185<br><br>
found to deliver greater benefits in terms of stability, especially low temperature stability.<br>
Suitable commercially available fatty alcohols include tallow alcohol (available as Hydrenol S3, ex Sidobre Sinnova, and Laurex CS, ex Clariant).<br>
The fatty alcohol content in the compositions is from 0 to 10% by weight, more preferably from 0.005 to 5% by weight, most preferably from 0.01 to 3% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
It is particularly preferred that a fatty alcohol is present if the composition is concentrated, that is if more than 8% by weight of the cationic softening agent is present in the composition.<br>
Nonionic surfactant<br>
 It is preferred that the compositions further comprise a nonionic surfactant.  Typically these can be included for the purpose of stabilising the compositions.<br>
Suitable nonionic surfactants include addition products of ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide with fatty alcohols, fatty acids and fatty amines.<br>
Any of the alkoxylated materials of the particular type described hereinafter can be used as the nonionic surfactant.<br><br>
WO  2004/027002	PCT/EP2003/009185<br><br>
Suitable surfactants are substantially water soluble surfactants of the general formula:<br><br>
where R is selected from the group consisting of primary, secondary and branched chain alkyl and/or acyl hydrocarbyl groups; primary, secondary and branched chain alkenyl hydrocarbyl groups; and primary, secondary and branched chain alkenyl-substituted phenolic hydrocarbyl groups; the hydrocarbyl groups having a chain length of from 8 to about 25, preferably 10 to 20, e.g. 14 to 18 carbon atoms.<br>
In the general formula for the alkoxylated nonionic surfactant, Y is typically:<br>
--0-- , --C(0)0-- , --C(0)N(R)--   or   --C (O) N (R) R--<br>
in which R has the meaning given above or can be hydrogen; and Z is preferably from 8 to 40, more preferably from 10 to 30, most preferably from 11 to 25, e.g. 12 to 22.<br>
The level of alkoxylation, Z, denotes the average number of alkoxy groups per molecule.<br>
Preferably the nonionic surfactant has an HLB of from about 7 to about 20, more preferably from 10 to 18, e.g. 12 to 16.<br>
Examples of nonionic surfactants follow.  In the examples, the integer defines the number of ethoxy (EO) groups in the molecule.<br><br>

All values are % by weight of the active ingredient unless stated otherwise.<br>
The following samples were made by co-melting a fully hardened grade of a quaternary ammonium material (having an iodine value of less than 1) with a fully unsaturated grade of a quaternary ammonium material (having an iodine value of greater than 3 0) and adding to water with low shear agitation.  The mixture was then allowed to cool.  0.68% perfume was added at 40°C during the cooling stage and 0.25% by weight calcium chloride was added once the mixture had cooled.<br><br>

In  the  preceding  table,   wt%  denotes   the  total   %  by weight  of the  raw material   as   supplied   (including  solvent).<br>
Stability Evaluation<br>
The  samples  were  evaluated for initial viscosity and viscosity upon storage.     The  results  are given below.<br><br>

Results are given as mPa.s measured on a Haake Rotoviscoraeter NVl at 25°C and a shear rate of 106s-1.<br>
The results show that where the level of unsaturated monoester quaternary ammonium material is less than 4% by weight of the total amount of fabric softening active ingredients, the compositions thicken undesirably upon storage and where more than 12% by weight of the monoester component is present, the compositions are undesirably thin.<br>
The following samples were prepared and monitored for viscostability over an extended period to evaluate long term stability at various storage temperatures.   All samples were prepared by co-melting the quaternary ammonium materials, mixing with hot water, adding perfume (0.68% by weight) during cooling and postdosing calcium chloride (0.25% by weight for samples 9, 10 and 11 and 0.35% by weight for sample 12).<br><br>

The viscosity results  are mPa.s measured on a Haake Rotoviscometer NVl   at  2 5°C  and a  shear  rate  of   106s-1<br><br><br>
The results demonstrate that viscosity stability is achieved by samples 10 and 11 whereas samples 9 and 12 are unstable at both reduced and elevated temperatures.<br>
Softening Evaluation<br>
Samples 1, 3 and 8 were evaluated for softening performance by adding an amount of each sample corresponding to 2.22g of the fabric softening composition to 1 litre of Wirral tap water, at ambient temperature in a tergotometer.  Three pieces of terry towelling (8cm x 8cm, 40g total weight) were added to the tergotometer pot.  The cloths were treated for 5 minutes at 65 rpm, spin dried to remove excess liquor and line dried overnight and conditioned at 21°C/65° relative humidity for 24 hours.<br>
Softening of the fabrics was assessed by an expert panel of 4 people using a round robin paired comparison test protocol.  Each panel member assessed four sets of test cloths.  Each set of test cloths contained one cloth of each test system under a evaluation.<br>
For the "ranking" vote type, panel members were asked to assess softness on a 8 point scale.  Softness scores were calculated using an "Analysis of Variance" technique.  Lower values are indicative of better softening.<br>
For the "preference" vote type, the result denotes the number of votes cast during the round robin paired<br><br><br>
comparison exercise.  Hence, larger results indicate greater preference.<br>
The results are shown in the table below.<br>
Table 5<br><br>
Sample	Vote Type	Test 1	Test 2	Test 3	Average<br>
 1	Preference	5	6	6	5.67<br>
 1	Ranking	5.5	5.5	6	5.67<br>
3	Preference	25	31	31	29<br>
3	Ranking	4.0	4.5	4	4.17<br>
8	Preference	18	11	11	13.33<br>
8	Ranking	5.75	4.75	5.75	5.42<br>
Surprisingly, the softening performance of the composition of the invention (sample 3) is superior not only to the highly unsaturated softening composition (sample 1) but also to the fully saturated softening.composition (sample 8). This is particularly unexpected as, typically, more saturated softening materials are known to provide better softening performance than more unsaturated softening material.<br><br><br>
