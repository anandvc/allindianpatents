				<td>Process for preparing 5-hydroxymethylfurfural via<br>
5-acyloxymethylfurfural as an intermediate<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for<br>
preparing 5-hydroxymethylfurfural via a 5-<br>
acyloxymethylfurfural as an intermediate. The invention<br>
also relates to a novel process for preparing the 5-<br>
acyloxymethylfurfural intermediate.<br>
5-Hydroxymethylfurfural of the following formula (I)<br><br>
has, among other properties, antibacterial and corrosion-<br>
inhibiting properties and is suitable for a multitude of<br>
reactions. It is possible without any great difficulty to<br>
prepare furfuryldialcohol, -dialdehyde and -dicarboxylic<br>
acid and their derivatives therefrom; equally, the<br>
hydrogenation of the,ring leads to difunctional<br>
2,5-tetrahydrofuran derivatives. Difunctional furan<br>
derivatives substituted differently on C-2 and C-5 are also<br>
readily obtainable from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural. The<br>
aforementioned and other useful organic intermediates<br>
preparable from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural serve to prepare<br>
numerous chemical products, for instance solvents,<br>
surfactants, crop protectants and resins. In addition, the<br>
use of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural for treatment of malignant<br>
tumours has been reported (US-A-5, 006,551) .<br>
5-Hydroxymethylfurfural is an intramolecular, triple<br>
dehydration product of hexoses (aldohexoses and<br>
ketohexoses). Renewable raw materials, such as starch,<br>
cellulose, sucrose or inulin, are inexpensive starting<br>
substances for preparing hexoses, such as glucose and<br>
fructose. 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural is in principle an<br>
intermediate of the dehydrating decomposition of hexoses to<br><br>
2<br>
laevulinic acid and formic acid, i.e. what is crucial is to<br>
stop the reaction at the correct time. This makes the<br>
removal of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural from the starting sugars<br>
and by-products an important step in its preparation.<br>
A large number of different processes for preparing<br>
5-hydroxymethylfurfural on the laboratory scale is already<br>
known.<br>
The catalysts which have been described for the dehydration<br>
are different acids or salts, for example oxalic acid (cf.<br>
W.N. Haworth et al., J. Chem. Soc. 1944, 667), salts such<br>
as pyridine hydrochloride (cf. C. Fayet et al., Carbohydr.<br>
Res. 122, 59 (1983)), acidic ion exchangers (cf. DE-A-<br>
30 33 527) or Lewis acids such as zirconyl chloride (cf.<br>
SU-A-1 054 349, cit. CA 100, 120866s) or boron trifluoride<br>
etherate (cf. H.H. Szmant et al., J. Chem. Tech. Biotechnol<br>
31, 135 (1981) ) .<br>
For the industrial scale preparation of 5-hydroxymethyl-<br>
furfural the catalyst used should be inexpensive and non-<br>
corrosive. Solid catalysts intended for reuse are, owing to<br>
the easy manner of formation of insoluble by-products,<br>
unsuitable because a removal of the catalyst (e.g. ion<br>
exchanger) from these by-products is uneconomic or<br>
impossible.<br>
Lewis acids such as zirconyl chloride or aluminium chloride<br>
likewise have to be rejected on the basis of considerations<br>
relating to corrosion protection. The use of sulphuric acid<br>
or phosphoric acid is therefore considered to be<br>
favourable, since the acidic aqueous reaction solutions can<br>
optionally be neutralized with bases in this case, and, for<br>
instance in the case of use of calcium hydroxide or calcium<br>
carbonate, the conversion of the catalyst acids to<br>
sparingly soluble salts with removal by filtration is<br>
possible.<br><br>
3<br>
The reaction medium of the dehydration of saccharides is<br>
determined by their solubility. In addition to water,<br>
dipolar aprotic solvents in particular, such as<br>
dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulphoxide, have been used.<br>
The iodine-catalysed conversion of the fructose portion of<br>
sucrose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfurai by heating sucrose in<br>
anhydrous dimethylformamide entails, as well as the<br>
expensive solvent, also a complicated workup, specifically<br>
extraction and paper chromatography (cf. T.G. Bonner et<br>
al., J. Chem. Soc. 1960, 787).<br>
In the decomposition of fructose with different catalysts,<br>
good yields (&gt; 90%) of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural are found in<br>
dimethyl sulphoxide (cf. H.H. Szmant et al., J. Chem. Tech<br>
Biotechnol. 31, 135 (1981)). However, the isolation of the<br>
desired product is difficult owing to the high boiling<br>
point of the solvent among other reasons, and entails a<br>
multistage extraction.<br>
DE-A-33 09 564 therefore proposes, for the isolation of the<br>
5-hydroxymethylfurfural from solutions comprising dimethyl<br>
sulphoxide, a derivatization to 5-acetoxymethylfurfural. As<br>
well as a vacuum distillation, this also entails two<br>
reaction steps -(acetylization, deacetylization) and hence<br>
consumption of time and chemicals.<br>
Several processes use mixtures of water and organic<br>
solvents as a reaction medium. In US-A-2 929 823, furfural<br>
is added to aqueous saccharide solutions and heated briefly<br>
(0.1 - 120 s) to 250 - 380°C. Tar-like by-products are<br>
dissolved by the organic solvent added, as is 5-hydroxy-<br>
methylfurfural. The preparation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural<br>
in pure form thus appears to be performable only with<br>
difficulty.<br>
A further biphasic process is described in DE-A-30 33 527.<br>
In this process, under relatively mild conditions (below<br><br>
4<br>
100°C) , fructose-containing aqueous solutions are<br>
decomposed with acidic cation exchangers, an organic<br>
solvent which is nor water-miscible but nevertheless has a<br>
good distillation capacity for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural<br>
being present. The great disadvantage of this process is<br>
that a very large excess of the organic solvent, based on<br>
the aqueous phase (&gt; 7:1), is needed, and the solvents<br>
required are expensive and toxic. Moreover, the very good<br>
solubility of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in water makes any<br>
extraction of the product with organic solvents from<br>
aqueous solutions exceptionally difficult.<br>
The publication by C. Fayet et al., Carbohydr. Res. 122<br>
(1983), 59, describes the decomposition of saccharides<br>
without solvent, but with equimolar amounts of catalyst.<br>
The pyridine hydrochloride catalyst is, however, unsuitable<br>
for an industrial use of the process. Furthermore, addition<br>
of water is followed by a laborious extraction (20 h) with<br>
ethyl acetate.<br>
This is also expressed in the publication by D.W. Brown et<br>
al., J. Chem. Tech. Biotechnol. 32, 920 (1982), where it is<br>
stated analogously that the more recent methods of<br>
preparing 5-hydroxymethylfurfural have the disadvantage<br>
that the product is present in the aqueous phase or in a<br>
polar solvent, from which the isolation is difficult.<br>
EP-A 0 230 250 describes a process for preparing<br>
5-hydroxymethylfurfural, in which saccharides are<br>
decomposed with an acidic catalyst in aqueous solution,<br>
optionally with addition of organic solvents, above 100°C.<br>
After removing any solvents present, the reaction mixture<br>
is chromatographed by means of ion exchange columns with<br>
exclusive use of water as the solvent, a mixed fraction<br>
obtainable when a relatively large amount is applied is<br>
rechromatographed, and the 5-hydroxymethylfurfural is<br>
crystallized out of the corresponding fractions. Although<br><br>
5<br>
the process described purportedly leads to 5-<br>
hydroxymethylfurfural in high purity, the multiple<br>
chromatography and crystallization is too complicated and<br>
expensive on the industrial scale.<br>
Further processes for preparing 5-hydroxymethylfurfural are<br>
disclosed, for example, in Bull. Soc. Chem. France 1987, 5,<br>
855; J. Chem. Tech. Biotechnol. 1992, 55, 139;<br>
FR-A-2 669 635; FR-A-2 664 273; US-A-3,483,228;<br>
US-A-2,917,520; US-A-3,071,599; US-A-3,066,150 and<br>
US-A-2,750,394,<br>
As is evident from the above examples, the greatest problem<br>
in the preparation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, particularly<br>
on the industrial scale, is to remove this product from<br>
starting materials, by-products and solvents. It is<br>
therefore an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
process for preparing 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, in which the<br>
product is obtained in high purity. At the same time, the<br>
preparation process should be performable with acceptable<br>
yields of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and in an economically<br>
viable manner. Especially in the later use of 5-<br>
hydroxymethylfurfural as a medicament, it is crucial that<br>
no highly toxic substances are used in the preparation.<br>
The object is achieved by a process for preparing<br>
5-hydroxymethylfurfural via a 5-acyloxymethylfurfural as an<br>
intermediate. The present invention therefore provides both<br>
a process for preparing 5-acyloxymethylfurfural of the<br><br>
in which<br>
x = 1 or 2,<br>
formula (II)<br><br>
6<br>
R is an alkyl, alkenyl, aryl or heteroaryl radical<br>
when x = 1,<br>
R is an alkylene, aikenylene, arylene or<br>
heteroarylene radical when x = 2,<br>
from a saccharide having 6 carbon atoms in the<br>
monosaccharide unit, comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	reacting the saccharide with<br>
(i) an acid which is not an acidic ion exchanger in<br>
the presence of a meral cation selected from alkali<br>
metal ions, alkaline earth metal ions, aluminium ions<br>
and mixtures thereof, or (ii) an acidic ion exchanger<br>
in the H form in the presence of a polar aprotic<br>
solvent, and<br>
removing the acidic ion exchanger, if used,<br>
(b)	adding an anhydride and/or chloride of a carboxylic<br>
acid R-(-COOH)x in which R and x are each as defined<br>
above to the mixture from step (a) and allowing them<br>
to react in order to form a 5-acyloxymethylfurfural,<br>
and<br>
(c)	recovering the 5-acyloxymethylfurfural,<br>
and the further processing of the 5-acyloxymethylfurfural<br>
to 5-hydroxymethyifurfural<br><br>
comprising the further steps of:<br>
(d)	dissolving the 5-acyioxymethylfurfural in an alcohol,<br>
(e)	adding a base selected from (i) alkali metal carbonates<br>
and hydrogencarbonates, alkaline earth metal carbonates<br>
and hydroxides, basic salts of the alkaline earth<br>
metals, aluminium carbonate, aluminium hydroxide,<br><br>
7<br>
aluminium oxide hydroxide, and basic salts of<br>
aluminium, mixtures of the above and (ii) basic ion<br>
exchangers in the OH form, to the solution from step<br>
(d) and allowing them to react in order to form<br>
5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and<br>
(f) recovering the 5-hydroxymethylfurfural.<br>
The starting material for preparing 5-acyloxymethylfurfural<br>
or 5-hydroxymethyifurfural is a saccharide having 6 carbon<br>
atoms in the monosaccharide unit. In principle, the term<br>
"saccharide" also includes mixtures of different<br>
saccharides. The starting materials used may also<br>
optionally be mixtures which, as well as the saccharide,<br>
also comprise other substances, provided that they do not<br>
disrupt the process and the saccharide is present in<br>
sufficient amount. The term "saccharide" means<br>
monosaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides<br>
Monosaccharides and oligosaccharides are also summarized as<br>
"sugars". The monosaccharide unit having 6 carbon atoms is<br>
also referred to as "hexose", and the term "hexose" herein<br>
shall encompass both the aldohexoses and the ketohexoses.<br>
Examples of monosaccharides suitable as starting materials<br>
are fructose, glucose, mannose, allose, altrose, gulose,<br>
idose, galactose and talose. Examples of oligosaccharides<br>
suitable as starting materials are the disaccharides, for<br>
instance sucrose, isomaltose, gentiobiose, melibiose,<br>
trehalose, mannopyranosylmannopyranose, maltose, lactose,<br>
trehalose and celiobiose, and trisaccharides, for instance<br>
raffinose. Examples of polysaccharides suitable as starting<br>
materials are the fructans (polysaccharides having 10 to 40<br>
fructose units), for instance inulin, and also starch and<br>
cellulose. The saccharide used is preferably a sugar or a<br>
saccharide mixture which comprises sugar. The saccharide<br>
used is more preferably selected from D-fructose in free<br>
form, a saccharide which comprises D-fructosc in bound form<br>
(e.g. sucrose, inulin), and a saccharide mixture which<br><br>
8<br>
comprises D-fructose in free form and/or a saccharide which<br>
comprises D-fructose in bound form.<br>
The inventive preparation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural<br>
proceeds via a 5-acyioxymethylfurfural of the formula (II)<br>
as an intermediate. In formula (II), R is a monovalent or<br>
divalent group. When x = 1, R is an alkyl group, preferably<br>
Ci- to C20-aikyl; an alkenyl group, preferably ethenyl; an<br>
aryl group, preferably phenyl, or a heteroaryl group, for<br>
instance pyridyl, pyrimidyl, pyrazinyl, pyrrolyl, furanyl<br>
or thiophenyl. When x = 2, R is an alkylene group,<br>
preferably Ci- to C2o_alkylene; an alkenylene group,<br>
preferably ethenyiene; an arylene group, preferably<br>
phenylene, or a heteroaryiene group, for instance<br>
pyridylene, pyrimidylene, pyrazinylene, pyrrolylene,<br>
furanyiene or thiophenylene. More preferably, R is methyl,<br>
i.e. 5-acetoxymethylfurfural is prepared as the<br>
intermediate.<br>
In step (a) of the process according to the invention, the<br>
saccharide is reacted either (i) with an acid in the<br>
presence of a metal cation or (ii) with an acidic ion<br>
exchanger in the H form in the presence of a polar aprotic<br>
solvent. Among other reactions, the saccharide is<br>
dehydrated to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural .<br>
In variant (i), the acid may be any acid which dissolves<br>
both the saccharide and the salt which provides the metal<br>
cation. Particularly suitable acids are oxalic acid, acetic<br>
acid and hydrochloric acid and combinations thereof,<br>
preference being given to oxalic acid, and oxalic acid in<br>
combination with acetic acid. Aside from the acid,<br>
preferably no further solvent is added in step (a)(i), i.e.<br>
the acid is preferably used in substantially anhydrous<br>
form, though low water contents which might result from the<br>
industrial preparation of the acid do not disrupt the<br>
reaction. In variant (i), in particular, preference is<br><br>
9<br>
given to dispensing with the presence of solvents which can<br>
be removed later only with difficulty, for instance<br>
dimethyl sulphoxide. When acetic acid is used, partial<br>
acetylation proceeds as early as in step (a), and<br>
5-acetoxymethylfurfural is formed.<br>
The metal cation in step (a)(i) is selected from alkali<br>
metal ions, alkaline earth metal ions, aluminium ions and<br>
mixtures thereof. Preference is given to Mg2T, Ca2+, Na+ and<br>
AlJ+ ions, particular preference to Mg2+. The metal cation<br>
is advantageously added in the form of a solid salt; very<br>
suitable salts are the chlorides, e.g. MgCl2, but also the<br>
bromides, e.g. MgBr2, and the fluorides, e.g. MgF2.<br>
Without wishing to be bound to this theory, it is assumed<br>
that the cation, e.g. Mg2+, stabilizes the furanose form of<br>
the hexose, which is believed to play an important role in<br>
the formation of the furan compound, in a "sugar-cation<br>
complex" and hence catalyses the dehydration.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the saccharide and the salt<br>
containing the metal cation are initially charged and<br>
optionally heated, and then the acid is added. In<br>
principle, however, any other sequence of combination is<br>
also possible. -<br>
Typically, the saccharide and the metal cation are used in<br>
a molar ratio of 0.5:1 to 2:1, based on the monosaccharide<br>
unit, preferably of 1:1 to 1.5:1, particular preference<br>
being given to the use of saccharide and metal cation in<br>
about equimolar amounts. Since the acid in variant (i) of<br>
step (a) also simultaneously serves as the solvent, it is<br>
typically-used in a large excess, for example in a 2- to<br>
20-fold molar excess based on the monosaccharide unit.<br>
In step (a), variant (ii), the saccharide is reacted with<br>
an acidic ion exchanger in the H form in the presence of a<br>
polar aprotic solvent, and the ion exchanger is removed<br><br>
10<br>
again before step (b) is carried out, for example by<br>
filtration. The acidic ion exchanger is a cationic organic<br>
or inorganic, typically organic, ion exchanger. An organic<br>
ion exchanger is a solid polyelectrolyte, usually in<br>
particle form, with a three-dimensional, water-insoluble,<br>
high molecular weight polymer skeleton (matrix), into which<br>
numerous charged "anchor groups" are incorporated. Its<br>
loosely bound counterions can be exchanged for other ions<br>
with the same kind of charge. The matrix resins used are<br>
predominantly styrene copolymers, preferably<br>
divinylbenzene-crosslinked polystyrene, and acrylic<br>
polymers, for instance the acrylate, methacrylate and<br>
acryionitrile copolymers which are each crosslinked with<br>
divinylbenzene. In the case of an acidic ion exchanger in<br>
the H form, the anchor groups are acidic groups in their<br>
protonated form (acid form), i.e. the exchangeable<br>
counterions are H"1". In step (a) (i) of the present<br>
invention, preference is given to using a strongly acidic<br>
cation exchanger in the H form, which bears sulphonic acid<br>
groups in their protonated form as anchor groups. It is<br>
also possible to use weakly acidic cation exchangers which<br>
bear carboxylic acid groups in their protonated form;<br>
however, the reaction time will be prolonged in this case.<br>
Particular preference is given to a styrene-divinylbenzene<br>
copolymer resin with protonated sulphonic acid groups as<br>
anchor groups.<br>
Typically, the acidic ion exchanger is used in an amount<br>
which corresponds to a large molar excess of the acidic<br>
anchor groups based on monosaccharide unit of the<br>
saccharide used, preferably a 2- to 20-fold, with<br>
preference 10- to 20-fold, molar excess. The number of the<br>
acidic anchor groups and hence the required amount of the<br>
ion exchanger is calculated from the exchange capacity,<br>
which is typically reported in equivalents/1 or<br>
equivalents/kg.<br><br>
11<br>
Examples of polar aprotic solvents suitable in step (a)(ii)<br>
include dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), N-methylpyrrolidone<br>
(NMP), dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide,<br>
acetonitrile and mixtures thereof. Preference is given to<br>
DMSO and NMP, particular preference to NMP.<br>
Typically, the saccharide and the polar aprotic solvent are<br>
used in a molar ratio of 1:2 to 1:20, preferably of 1:2 to<br>
1:10.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, step (a) is performed at a<br>
temperature of 80 to 140°C, more preferably of 80 to 110°C,<br>
at a reaction time of 4 to 7 h, more preferably of 4 to<br>
6 h. In the case of correspondingly longer reaction times,<br>
it is also possible to employ lower temperatures. The upper<br>
limit in the temperature results from the boiling point of<br>
the reaction mixture.<br>
In step (b), an anhydride and/or chloride of a carboxylic<br>
acid R-(-COOH)x in which R and x are each as defined above<br>
is added to the mixture from step (a), and the acetylation<br>
proceeds to give a 5-acyloxymethylfurfural. As already<br>
mentioned above, R is preferably methyl, i.e. acetic<br>
anhydride and/or acetyl chloride is preferably added in<br>
step (b), particular preference being given to acetic<br>
anhydride, and 5-acetoxymethylfurfural is formed. When<br>
acidification has been effected in step (a) with acetic<br>
acid and partial acetylation has thus already proceeded in<br>
this first step, the acetylation is then completed in step<br>
(b) by the addition of acetic anhydride and/or acetyl<br>
chloride.<br>
Further illustrative anhydrides and chlorides which can be<br>
used in step (b) of the present invention are immediately<br>
evident from the aforementioned examples of the R group. It<br>
is obvious that, when a 5-acyloxymethylfurfural where x = 2<br>
is to be obtained, the corresponding dicarboxylic acids<br>
have to be used. Many dicarboxylic acids form cyclic<br><br>
12<br>
anhydrides owing to their molecular structure. Very<br>
suitable anhydrides are, for instance, the inexpensive<br>
anhydrides of maleic acid, fumaric acid, pyridyl-2,3-<br>
dicarboxylic acid and pyrazine-2,3-dicarboxyiic acid.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, step<br>
(b) is performed in the presence of a basic catalyst, for<br>
example 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine. The basic catalyst<br>
is typically added in catalytic amounts, for instance in a<br>
molar ratio of catalyst to monosaccharide unit of 1:10 to<br>
1:100.<br>
Owing to the water of reaction which forms, in variant (i)<br>
of the present process, the anhydride and/or chloride of<br>
the carboxylic acid R-(-COOH)x is typically added in a<br>
large molar excess. Preference is given to using an<br>
equivalents ratio of monosaccharide unit of the saccharide<br>
used at the start to anhydride and/or chloride of the<br>
carboxylic acid R-(-COOH)x of at least 1:4, more preferably<br>
of 1:4 to 1:12.<br>
In variant (ii) of the present process, the monosaccharide<br>
unit and the anhydride and/or chloride of the carboxylic<br>
acid R-(-COOH)x are used typically in an equivalents ratio<br>
of 1:0.7 to 1:3, preferably of 1:0.8 to 1:1.2, particular<br>
preference being given to the use of the monosaccharide<br>
unit and of the anhydride and/or chloride of the carboxylic<br>
acid R-(-COOH)x in about equivalent amounts (i.e. equimolar<br>
amounts for x = 1). Without wishing to be bound to this<br>
theory, it is suspected that the water of reaction formed<br>
is bound to the ion exchanger.<br>
Preference is given to effecting step (b) with stirring.<br>
Typically, step (b) is performed at a temperature of 0 to<br>
40°C at a reaction time of 0.5 to 3 h. For correspondingly<br>
longer reaction times, lower temperatures can also be<br>
employed. Since the acylation reaction is exothermic, it<br><br>
13<br>
may be necessary to cool. The upper limit in the<br>
temperature arises from the boiling point of the reaction<br>
mixture.<br>
In order to shift the equilibrium of the acylation reaction<br>
in step (b) to the right, it is advantageous to remove the<br>
carboxylic acid R-(-COOH}x formed from the mixture. This<br>
can be done by customary measures, for example by<br>
distillative removal, optionally with addition of an<br>
aprotic water-immiscible organic solvent, for instance<br>
toluene, xylene, tert-butyl methyl ether (MtBE), methyl<br>
isobutyl ketone (MIBK), more preferably MtBE. In this case,<br>
5-acyIoxymethyIfurfural is obtained dissolved in the<br>
organic solvent. When step (a) of the process according to<br>
the invention has been performed by variant (ii), i.e. in<br>
the presence of a polar aprotic solvent, it is then<br>
preferably also distilled off for the most part in step<br>
(b). In that case too, the distillation can be effected<br>
with addition of the abovementioned aprotic<br>
water-immiscible organic solvents.<br>
In the subsequent step (c), the 5-acyloxymethylfurfural is<br>
recovered, i.e. freed from the undesired by-products,<br>
unconverted starting materials and any solvent. The<br>
5-acyloxymethylfurfural is purified by methods customary in<br>
industry, for example by extraction, filtration,<br>
distillation and combinations thereof. For the extraction,<br>
water and an aprotic water-immiscible organic -solvent are<br>
added as described above, if the latter has not already<br>
been added in step (b). Also advantageous is the addition<br>
of activated carbon in order to bind thereon polymeric by-<br>
products which are soluble neither in water nor in the<br>
organic solvent. The activated carbon can then be filtered<br>
off together with the solid by-products, if appropriate<br>
with addition of a filtering aid, for instance Celite®. The<br>
aqueous phase is then removed from the organic phase in<br>
which the desired 5-acyloxymethylfurfural product is<br><br>
14<br>
present, the organic solvent is distilled off and the<br>
remaining 5-acyloxymethylfurfural is distilled for fine<br>
purification, preferably under reduced pressure. The manner<br>
of workup of the 5-acyloxymethylfurfural intermediate is,<br>
however, not essential for the present invention, and any<br>
other suitable process for recovering the 5-<br>
acyloxymethylfurfural is also possible.<br>
Typically, the yields of 5-acyloxymethylfurfural, based on<br>
saccharide, are 20 to 80%, preferably 30 to 80%, more<br>
preferably 40 to 80% and most preferably 42 to 80%.<br>
If the 5-acyloxymethylfurfural is to be processed further<br>
to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, it is dissolved in step (d) in<br>
an alcohol, preferably an aliphatic primary or secondary<br>
alcohol, for instance methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol,<br>
pentanol, hexanol, isopropanol or isobutanol, or benzyl<br>
alcohol, if appropriate while applying heat. Particular<br>
preference is given to using methanol as the alcohol, in<br>
which, for example, 5-acetoxymethylfurfural dissolves<br>
readily even at room temperature (approx. 20 - 25°C).<br>
Typically, the 5-acyloxymethylfurfural is dissolved in the<br>
alcohol in a molar ratio of 1:5 to 1:10.<br>
Then, in step (e), a base selected from (i) alkali metal<br>
carbonates and hydrogencarbonates, alkaline earth metal<br>
carbonates and hydroxides, basic salts of the alkaline<br>
earth metals, aluminium carbonate, aluminium hydroxide,<br>
aluminium oxide hydroxide and basic salts of aluminium,<br>
mixtures of the above and (ii) basic ion exchangers in the<br>
OH form is added, and hydrolysis of the acyl group (ester<br>
group) forms the desired 5-hydroxymethylfurfural product.<br>
Preferred bases are a basic ion exchanger in the OH form,<br>
potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate and calcium<br>
carbonate, particular preference being given to a basic ion<br>
exchanger in the OH form and potassium carbonate.<br>
The basic ion exchanger is an anionic organic or inorganic,<br><br>
15<br>
typically organic, ion exchanger. Organic ion exchangers<br>
and their matrix polymers have already been described above<br>
in general terms. In a basic ion exchanger in the OH form,<br>
the anchor groups are positively charged groups and the<br>
exchangeable counterions are OH". In step (e) of the<br>
present invention, preference is given to using a strongly<br>
basic anion exchanger which bears quaternary ammonium<br>
groups, especially benzyltrimethylammonium groups (known as<br>
"type 1") or benzyldimethylethanolammonium groups (known as<br>
"type 2") as anchor groups, and contains hydroxide ions as<br>
counterions. It is also possible to use weakly basic anion<br>
exchangers with tertiary amino groups. Particular<br>
preference is given to a styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer<br>
resin with benzyltrimethylammonium groups as anchor groups<br>
in its OH form, e.g. AMBERLYST® A26 OH, obtainable from<br>
Rohm and Haas Company, Philadelphia, U.S.A.<br>
In both variants of step (e), the 5-acyloxymethylfurfural<br>
and the base are used typically in an equivalents ratio of<br>
1:0.9 to 1:3, preferably of 1:1 to 1:2, more preferably of<br>
1:1 to 1:1.5, preference being given to about equivalent<br>
amounts of the two reactants. When a basic ion exchanger is<br>
used, the amount thereof required is calculated, taking<br>
account of the aforementioned equivalents ratios, from the<br>
exchange capacity, which is typically reported in<br>
equivalents/1 or equivalents/kg.<br>
The hydrolysis in step (e) is effected preferably at a<br>
relatively low temperature (approx. 20 - 35°C) for a<br>
reaction time of 1 to 3 h. According to the type of acyl<br>
radical of the 5-acyloxymethylfurfural, however, it is also<br>
possible to employ higher temperatures.<br>
In the subsequent step (f), the 5-hydroxymethyIfurfural is<br>
recovered, i.e. freed from the undesired by-products,<br>
unconverted starting materials, solid ion exchanger if<br>
used, and solvent. The 5-hydroxymethylfurfural is purified<br><br>
16<br>
by methods customary in industry, for example filtration,<br>
distillation and/or crystallization. Preference is given to<br>
first filtering off the solid by-products and, if used, the<br>
ion exchanger, and then distilling the filtrate in order to<br>
recover the 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in pure form. Since<br>
5-hydroxymethylfurfural is thermally sensitive and tends to<br>
form polymers and ethers among other substances, it is<br>
advisable to carry out a molecular distillation or short-<br>
path distillation under reduced pressure, for example with<br>
the aid of a short-path evaporator, falling-film evaporator<br>
or thin-film evaporator. In another preferred embodiment,<br>
the 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, after filtration, is recovered<br>
by crystallization from a suitable solvent, for instance<br>
diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, MtBE or tert-butyl ethyl<br>
ether (EtBE), preferably MtBE, at a suitable temperature.<br>
Typically, the yield of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, based on<br>
saccharide, is 10 to 70%, preferably 20 to 70%, more<br>
preferably 25 to 70% and most preferably 30 to 70%.<br>
Typically, in the process according to the invention,<br>
5-hydroxymethylfurfural is obtained in a purity of at least<br>
90%, preferably at least 95%, more preferably at least 98%<br>
and most preferably at least 99%. The purity is thus above<br>
the purity achievable with comparable chromatography-free<br>
processes. The high achievable purity makes the<br>
5-hydroxymethylfurfural prepared in accordance with the<br>
invention suitable for cosmetic or pharmaceutical purposes.<br>
In the present invention, for the first time, a process is<br>
provided for preparing 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, which<br>
enables industrial scale production of 5-hydroxymethyl-<br>
furfural in high purity.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated in detail with<br>
reference to working examples.<br><br>

mixture is admixed with 420 ml of anhydrous acetic acid<br>
(glacial acetic acid) and heated to 90-95°C for 4 h.<br>
Thereafter, approx. 80% of the acetic acid is distilled<br>
off, the mixture is cooled to room temperature and 5 g<br>
(0.04 mol) of 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine are added. With<br>
stirring, 616 ml (6.5 mol) of acetic anhydride are added<br>
dropwise to the reaction mixture at 30 - 40°C, and the<br>
600 - 700 ml of acetic acid are distilled off. At approx.<br>
80°C, the reaction mixture is admixed slowly with 500 ml of<br>
water, 500 ml of MIBK and 50 g of activated carbon. After<br>
filtration through a pressure filter, the organic phase and<br>
