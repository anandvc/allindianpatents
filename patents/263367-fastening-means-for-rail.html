FIXING MEANS FOR FIXING RAILWAY LINES TO <br>
SLEEPERS OR STERTCHES OF TRACK<br>
I, Wolf Berner, c/o  Technical Translation Agency GmbH, Fasangarten 8, A-2136 Laa/Thaya, Austria, am the translator of the documents attached and certify that the following is a true translation to the best of my knowledge and belief.<br><br><br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates to fixing means for fixing railway lines to sleepers or stretches of track as well as fixing means comprising an elastic rail clip and a clip anchor element. The invention furthermore comprises sleepers or stretches of track into which the clip anchor elements of the mentioned fixing means are inserted or cast. The sleepers, like the corresponding stretches of track designed integrally, are preferentially made of concrete.<br>
To hold the railway lines, which are backed by elastic and electrically insulating supports relative to the sleepers or the stretch of track, predominantly elastic rail clips of bent wire are used which are held in corresponding anchorage elements which are fitted or inserted in the sleepers or the stretch of track. For the assembly, the elastic rail clips are displaced above the rail foot in transverse direction to the railway line, wherein clamping screws to be turned more preferably into plastic dowels are utilised as clamping means for clamping the elastic rail clip to the rail foot.<br>
Rail fixing means of the mentioned type are known in a large variety.<br>
Elastic rail clips bent from wire are known from EP 0498 761 B1 which, starting from an elastic clip, comprise a straight vertical tensile section and a bent hook at the lower end, wherein the elastic clip through twisting about the vertical section can be swivelled in over the rail foot.<br>
In addition, a rail clip is known from EP 0468 945 Bl, wherein a compression spring is tensioned on a tensile anchor which is cast into the sleeper, wherein a rotatable arm is arranged under the compression spring which for fixing is to be swivelled through rotation over the rail foot of the rail.<br>
Fixing means for the fixing of railway lines on sleepers are known from WO 90/15192 which comprise an elastic rail clip and a clip anchor element. The elastic rail clip comprises retaining elements which can be inserted in the clip anchor element in such a manner that they are rotatably guided about a rotational axis in said clip anchor element, and at least one pressure bow which on rotating the elastic rail clip relative to the clip anchor element about the rotational axis can be brought into pre-tensioned contact with the rail foot of a railway line. The fixing means of the elastic rail clip are substantially bent annular clip bows; the clip anchor element comprises concentric guide elements relative to the rotational axis that can engage in the clip bows.<br>
An elastic rail nail, comprising two nail shanks and two loops, which when driven in form a vertical stop for a pressure arm or pressure bow is known from DE 1025 439 A.<br>
2<br><br>
A rail nail with two shanks is likewise known from JP 2002-03S 405 A which shanks are connected with a pressure bow via two loops in such a manner that the two loops on driving-in form a vertical stop for the arms of the pressure bow.<br>
Today., rail fixing systems of this type are subjected to high demands, while train speeds of up to 300 krn/h, track radii &gt;=150m and wheel set loads of up to 25 tons have to be used as a base for the design. In addition, elastic mounting of the rails relative to the sleepers or the stretch of track has to be ensured over the entire usual lying period of the system.<br>
The elasticities of the system rail/sleeper are supposed to differ for the three different three-dimensional directions (rail longitudinal direction, rail vertical direction, rail transverse direction). The characteristics must be maintained permanently.<br>
In addition, for safety reasons, lifting-off of the rail with its rail foot on one side by more than 2 mm must be prevented through positive fixing of the rail relative to the sleepers or the stretch of track in order to prevent complete tipping over of the rail in extreme situations.<br>
Starting from WO 90/15192 the invention is based on the object of providing fixing means or a sleeper or a stretch of track with such fixing means which, with reduced number of parts, allows an extremely rational manner of clamping of the fixing system.<br>
The solution of this object is contained in the Claims 1,23 and 24.<br>
According to the invention it is provided that the fixing means, which comprise an elastic rail clip and a clip anchor element, are designed in such a manner that the elastic rail clip comprises retaining elements which can be inserted in the clip anchor element and guided in the latter by being rotated about a rotational axis (D) and at least comprises one pressure bow which can be brought into pre-tensioned contact with the foot of a railway line when the elastic rail clip is rotated about the rotational axis (D) in relation to the clip anchor element, and that the elastic rail clip has essentially annular clip bows that act as retaining elements and the clip anchor element has guide elements that are concentric with the rotational axis, wherein the clip bows and the guide elements each cover a guide plane which is located vertically to the rotational axis (D), wherein the elastic rail clip comprises an arc-shaped pressure bow, the two clip bows covering a guide plane as well as two spring loops connecting the clip bows with the pressure bow, wherein the ends of the spring loops connected with the clip bows form upright bows which run approximately vertically to the guide plane and the ends of the spring loops connected with the pressure bow are guided through between the guide plane and the ends of the spring loops connected with the clip bows. Thus, the pressure bow is enclosed in three three-dimensional directions by the elastic rail clip:<br>
3<br><br>
axis-parallel to the rotational axis (D) upwards from each of the parts of the spring loops adjoining both upright bows,<br>
to the inside from in each case one of the two vertical upright bows,<br>
as well as axis-parallel to the rotational axis (D) to from the two clip bows (or the guide plane covered by the clip bows).<br>
The spring loops which are located above the pressure bow because of this form a vertical stop for the pressure bow against excessive bending-out under overload in the direction away from the clip bows. The guide elements can more preferably consist of an annular outer guide slot in which the clip bows engage in an elastic manner. Insofar as the elastic rail clip is bent from round wire the guide slot has a suitably adapted round cross section open towards the outside. Here, the guide slot is formed on a part which is permanently joined with the sleeper, if applicable even formed directly in the sleeper. The elastic rail clip with its clip bows that can be bent open elastically can be inserted in a pre-assembly position in the guide slot. In litis pre-assembly position the pressure bow faces in a direction in which it does not obstruct placing of a railway line onto the sleeper, for example in a position facing in the direction across the sleeper. In this pre-assembly position the elastic rail clip, i.e. more preferably the spring bow, can already be elastically pre-tensioned.<br>
Once the railway line has been placed onto the sleeper the elastic rail clip which is retained in a rotatable manner is twisted so far that the pressure bow arrives in its assembly position in which it faces in the direction of the sleeper to the railway line and rests on the rail foot approximately symmetrically. On reaching of the assembly position engaging of the elastic rail clip in engaging means of the guide elements can occur simultaneously. Thus the elastic rail clip is secured against inadvertent loosening. On sliding-up of the pressure bow onto the rail foot the pre-tension can still increase to a minor degree. With the fixing means according to the invention the final assembly, starting from the pre-assembly position, only requires a rotary movement of the elastic rail clip by approximately 90°, which can be executed with conventional rotating tools in a very short time. The fixing means proper can be simply designed and manufactured cheaply, as is evident from the further description.<br>
According to a particularly advantageous embodiment it is provided that the guide slot is formed in a guide ring which more preferably is positively held on the sleeper. To radially fix the guide ring a centring body formed from the material of the sleeper in cone form or ring form can be provided on which the guide ring is placed. In order to hold the guide ring, which in an advantageous manner can consist of plastic, axially in the direction of the rotational axis, anchor hooks cast into the body of the sleeper have to be provided which reach over the guide ring. Provided the guide ring is split on the circumference it can be pushed onto the centring body radially to the rotational axis following the completion of the sleeper and the casting-in of the anchor hooks. The elastic rail clip proper with its clip bows can either be inserted in the guide slot radially or axially to the rotational axis and<br>
4<br><br>
twisted from the pre-assembly position into its assembly position, in which the pressure bow radially protruding to the outside contacts the rail foot under pre¬tension.<br>
According to a further embodiment it is provided that symmetrically to the centring body two stop elements running in sleeper longitudinal direction are formed out of the sleeper, which serve to support the rail foot of the railway line under transverse forces. Here it is simultaneously provided that, when the clip bows are seated in the guide elements and the pressure bow rests on one of the slop elements, the elastic rail clip is in a tensioned state. In order to avoid contact between steel and concrete when twisting the elastic rail clip relative to the clip anchor a slide protection element is placed on the stop elements according to a first embodiment which forms a direct support for the pressure bow during the twisting of the elastic rail clip. This slide protection element can be constructed as one piece with a stop ship for the rail foot which, under the influence of lateral forces on the rail, contacts the mentioned stop elements supporting itself on these. Slide protection elemenets and/or stop strip can be designed as one piece with the guide ring which thus can all consist of plastic.<br>
According to a second embodiment it is provided that a cap-like slide protection element is fitted onto the pressure bow which forms the direct support for the pressure bow on at least one stop element and on the rail foot upon rotation about the rotational axis (D). Here it is more preferably proposed that on the cap-like slide protection element a stop strip for the rail foot of the railway line is moulded.<br>
A preferred exemplary embodiment of the invention is shown in the drawings and described in the following:<br>

Figures la), lb) and lc) are described jointly in the following unless the description specifically relates to an individual one of the figures.<br>
An arrangement according to the invention with a sleeper 11 only shown with its end section, a section of a railway line 21 resting on said sleeper and fixing means still to be explained in more detail is shown, which fixing means consist of a clip anchor element 31 and an elastic rail clip 51, wherein the latter are shown in two different positions. In the position according to Figure la), a preassembly position is shown in which a railway line 21 can be placed onto the lying sleeper 11 from the top, wherein an elastic and electrically insulating rail support 26 is to be used. Figures lb) and lc) each show an assembly position or a final assembly position respectively in which the railway line 21 on one side is held to its rail foot 24 by means of the fixing means, wherein fixing means of the same type or embodied in a deviating manner can be added to the fixing means shown on the opposite side of the rail foot in order to completely secure the railway line. On the sleeper 11, at a lateral distance to the railway line 21, a centring body 12 of conical, more preferably annular shape is formed on which parts of the rail fixing means are centred.<br>
6<br><br>
Furthermore, two stop elements 13, 14 are formed on the sleeper 11 likewise at a lateral distance to the railway line 21 which limit a lateral displacement of the railway line 21 under transverse forces and in addition to this form contact surfaces and support surfaces for additional parts of the fixing means. The railway line 21 comprises as details a rail head 22, a vertical land 23 and the rail foot 24 starting on both sides, on which the fixing means come to bear with pre-tension after the final assembly. The fixing means for the railway line 21 comprise several parts permanently connected with the sleeper 11, which altogether form the clip anchor element 31, and a detachable elastic rail clip 51 that can be braced against the first-mentioned parts and which acts on the rail foot of the railway line 21. The parts permanently connected with the sleeper 11 comprise a guide ring 32 which is placed on the centring body 12 and held in a centred manner on said centring body and which can consist of a material with favourable sliding properties, i.e. more preferably of plastic. The guide ring 32 is split to the circumference towards the end of the sleeper 11, as a result of which removal from the sleeper 11 is ensured. The guide ring 32 is axially held by three anchor hooks 15,16, 17 which reach over the guide ring 32 from the inside hook-shaped and which are cast into the sleeper 11 and at their cast-in end have anchorage heads 18, 19, 20 each. With adequate elasticity of the guide ring 32 shown the latter can thus be pushed under the anchor hooks from the rail side or the sleeper end., and, if applicable, turned into its end position. When using an annular guide ring it is however conceivable in like manner that said guide ring is brought into its intended position even before the casting-in of the anchor hooks and during the manufacture of the sleeper is already finally positioned. The version of the guide ring capable of being disassembled more preferably consisting of plastic allows the exchange as wear part and is thus preferable.<br>
The guide ring 32 has an inner cone 33 by means of which it is firmly positioned on the centring body 12 and an outer guide slot 34 in which the elastic rail clip 51, which is bent of wire and will still be described in more detail, engages positively and rocatably. A slide protection element 35 is placed on the stop elements 13, 14 which in top view is adjusted to the course of the intermediate space between centring body 12 and stop elements 13,14, wherein it covers a substantial part of the stop element 13 and with a folded-clown stop ship 36 covers the stop elements 13,14 towards the railway line 21, so that the contact between railway line 21 and sleeper 11 is imparted through this contact strip 36. The slide protection element 35 is substantially manufactured of material of identical wall thickness, more preferably of plastic, and is placed on the elastic rail clip 51 prior to the assembly. During the movement of the elastic rail clip 51 from the preassembly position into the assembly position the pressure bow 52 of the elastic rail clip slides over the top of the slide protection element 35. The elastic rail clip 51 substantially consists of the mentioned pressure bow 52 two spring loops 53,54 running symmetrically and lying above said pressure bow and two clip bows 55, 56 following the latter which, in adaptation to the guide slot 34 are bent around the cenhing body 12 in a centred manner and which can be inserted in the guide slot 34. During this, the elastic rail clip 51 can be clipped in the guide slot 34 of the guide ring 32 from the sleeper end, while the clip bows 55, 56 are pressed apart. In the process, the clip bows 55, 56 engage in the intermediate spaces between stop elements 13, 14 and guide ring 32 in a position<br>
7<br><br>
which, compared with the one from Figure lb) is rotated by 90°. Starting from this position the elastic rail clip 51 is turned in clockwise manner as far as into the preassembly position according to Figure la), in which the pressure bow 52 already rests in a pre-tensionecl manner on the slide protection plate, wherein, upon further rotation, no contact can lake place between the steel of the elastic rail clip 51 and the concrete of the sleeper. As already mentioned, the railway line 21 can be inserted in this preassembly position according to Figure la). With suitable drive means the elastic rail clip 51 guided in the guide slot 34 is subsequently rotated in a clockwise manner by a further 90° until it reaches the final assembly position shown in Figure lb). The pressure bow 52 bent to the outside in the process slides onto the rail foot 24. For fixing the position, suitable engagement means, for example at the end of the clip bows, must be provided which can interact with corresponding counter-engagement means in the guide ring 32, but which are not shown here. These engagement means must be designed in such a manner that on overcoming a suitable breakaway force the elastic rail clip 51 can again be rotated away from the rail foot 24 in anti-clockwise direction.<br>
In the embodiment shown the centre axes of the centring body 12 and the guide ring 32 and thus the rotational axis D of the elastic rail clip 51 must be assumed vertically and thus parallel to the land 23 of the railway line 21. Here, the pre-tension of the elastic rail clip 51 is exclusively generated already during the inserting in the guide slot 34, wherein the pressure bow 52 braces itself on the stop element 31 in a pre-tensioned manner. However it is also possible to arrange the centre axis and thus the rotational axis of the elastic rail clip 51, starting from the centring body and the guide ring, in such a manner that the centre axis and thus the rotational axis are slightly tilted from the rail foot towards the rail head so that on rotating the elastic rail clip from the preassembly position into the assembly position an additional spring load is built-up as a result, so that the movement plane of the pressure bow 52 is an inclined slope, which results in the maximum bending-out of the pressure bow while being rotated into the final assembly position.<br>
Figures 2a), 2b) and 2c) are jointly described in the following unless special reference is made to individual figures. Identical details are described with identical reference numbers as in the preceding figures to the description of which reference is made insofar. This applies more preferably to the railway line 21, the details of which are not again explained here. More preferably in the representation according to Figure 2c), in which the railway line is not shown, the annular shape of the centring body 12 and the arrangement of the stop element 13, 14 by pairs is noticeable, between which, in the intermediate space, lies the guide ring 32 with its guide slot 34, which with its inner cone 33 braces itself on the centring body 12. In addition, the position and function of the anchor hooks 15,16 is evident, which with their hook head reach over and hold-in position the guide ring 32, wherein the guide ring 32 split on the circumference however can be rotated into the position shown. In section through the elastic rail clip 51 shown in the preassembly position one of the clips 55, one of the spring loops 53 as well as in cross section a part of the pressure bow 52 are noticeable. When rotated in clockwise direction the pressure bow in this representation moves forward out of the plane of the figure where the railway line<br>
8<br><br>
21 must be imagined. The contact of the slide protection element 35 on the stop element 13 is noticeable in Figures 2a) and b), wherein the slide protection element 35 here is deformed by the pressure bow 52 in an exaggerated manner. In Figure 2b) the approximately symmetrical end position of the clip bows 55, 56 is noticeable and the pre-tensioned contact of the support bow 52 on the rail foot 24 is shown in a traceable manner.<br>
Figures 3a), 3b) and 3c) are described jointly in the following, wherein identical details are designated with identical reference numbers as in the preceding figures. Insofar reference is made to the corresponding description. The slide protection element 35 is visible in each of the Figures 3a) and 3b) which slide protection element separates the pressure bow 52 from the stop element during its rotary movement until the pressure bow 52 slides onto the rail foot, where metallic contact can be made. In the embodiment shown here a lateral contact between the elastic rail clip 51 and the rail foot 24 in the assembly position is likewise noticeable. Between the rail foot 24 and the stop elements 13,14 lies the stop strip 36, wherein additional play is still present. As is more preferably visible in Figure 3b) lifting of the pressure bow 52 during tilting of the rail is limited through the spring loops 53, 54 which run at a minor distance above said pressure bow. As soon as the bows 52, 53, 54 strike one another, the railway line is positively held relative to the sleeper.<br>
In section according to Figure 3c) the position and function of the third anchor hook 17 is noticeable, which secures the guide ring 32 in the highest-loaded position. The ring-cylindrical shape of the centring body 12 is visible once more. Finally the contact of the pressure valve 52 of the elastic rail clip 51 on the rail foot 24 is very clearly visible. With appropriate pre-tension of the elastic rail clip, with which the pressure bow 52, in the pre-tensioned form following the insertion in the guide slot 34, lies at the level of the surface of the rail foot, no additional pre-tension of the pressure bow and the spring loops occurs on rotating into the assembly position shown. The slide protection element is not evident in this section.<br>
Figures 4a) and 4b) are jointly described in the following. Identical details are designated with identical reference numbers as in the preceding figures. In the view according to Figure 4a) more preferably the stop element 14 is noticeable on which no slide protection element is provided. While the pressure bow 52 in the preassembly position shown in Figure 4 still rests on the slide protection element 35, this is no longer the case in the final assembly position according to Figure 4b).<br>
Figures 5a) and 5b) are jointly described in the following. Identical details are given identical reference numbers as in the preceding figures, to the description of which reference is made insofar. The arrangement of the stop elements 13,14 by pairs on the sleeper 11 is clearly visible once more, between which the guide ring 32 with its circumferential division from the sleeper end, i.e. in the representation from the left, can be inserted and then rotated by 360° into its end position, wherein it is then axially secured by the anchor hool.s 15,16,17 and is radially centred on the centring body 12. Furthermore, the contact of the pressure bow 52 of the elastic rail clip 51 on the slide protection element 35 in the preassembly position is noticeable, as well as<br>

the separation of the rail foot from the stop elements 13,14 through the stop strip 36 of the slide protection element 35. Finally it can be traced through the cause of the elastic rail clip shown that excessive bending open of the pressure bow 52 upwards upon overload., i.e. upon commencing tilting of the railway line, is limited through the effect of the overlapping spring loops 53,54.<br>
Figures 6 to 8 show the elastic rail clip 51 with its details already mentioned above, pressure bow 52, spring loops 53, 54 and clip bows 55, 56, wherein it is noticeable that as transition from the spring loops to the clip bows vertical upright bows 57, 5S which are past through the pressure bow 52 are provided. The two clip bows 55, 56 approximately bend half-round cover a guide plane which during the assembly can be brought to cover the guide plane covered by the guide slot in the annular body. The spring loops 53, 54 looped towards the outside, which merge into the pressure bow 52, follow via the upright bows 57, 5S. Here, the ends of the spring loops 53, 54 running to the pressure bow 52 lie between the ends of the spring loops running to the upright bows 57, 5S and the clip bows 55, 56. The elastic rail clip is altogether embodied symmetrically.<br>
Figures 6 and 7 show the elastic rail clip 51 in its relaxed position, while the end of the pressure bow 52 is situated near the guide plane covered by the clip bow 55, 56 and has a greater distance to the spring loops 53,54.<br>
In Figure 7, which in shape and representation corresponds to the elastic rail clip of Figure 6, a ring segment shaped cap-like slide protection element 61 is fitted onto the pressure bow which slide protection element is permanently connected with the pressure bow and which can replace the previously described slide protection element 35 or can be added to the latter. A stop strip 62 is formed on the slide protection element 61 which can replace the previously mentioned stop strip 36.<br>
Although shown as detail, the elastic rail clip 51 is shown in its pre-tensioned form in Figure 1, which form it assumes in the preassembly position or the assembly position. The pressure bow 52 is bent open as far as closely to the spring loops 53, 54 and thus has a greater distance to the guide plane defined by the clip bows. Further contact of the pressure bow 52 is limited by the spring loops after a short distance.<br>
