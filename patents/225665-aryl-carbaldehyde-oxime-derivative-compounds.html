FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This invention relates to aryl-carbaldehyde oxime derivatives, and in<br>
certain aspects to (hydroxy-phenyl)-aryl-carbaldehyde oxime derivatives, their uses as<br>
estrogenic agents, and methods of their preparation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The pleiotropic effects of estrogens in mammalian tissues have been<br>
well documented, and it is now appreciated that estrogens affect many organ systems<br>
[Mendelsohn and Karas, New England Journal of Medicine 340: 1801-1811 (1999),<br>
Epperson, et al., Psychosomatic Medicine 61: 676-697 (1999), Crandall, Journal of<br>
Womens Health &amp; Gender Based Medicine S: 1155-1166 (1999), Monk and Brodaty,<br>
Dementia &amp; Geriatric Cognitive Disorders 11: 1-10 (2000), Hum and Macrae, Journal<br>
of Cerebral Blood Flow &amp; Metabolism 20: 631-652 (2000), Calvin, Maturitas 34: 195-<br>
210 (2000), Finking, et al., Zeitschrift fur Kardiologie 89: 442-453 (2000), Brincat,<br>
Maturitas 35: 107-117 (2000), Al-Azzawi, Postgraduate Medical Journal 77: 292-304<br>
(2001)]. Estrogens can exert effects on tissues in several ways. Probably, the most well<br>
characterized mechanism of action is their interaction with estrogen receptors leading to<br>
alterations in gene transcription. Estrogen receptors are ligand-activated transcription<br>
factors and belong to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. Other members of this<br>
family include the progesterone, androgen, glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid<br>
receptors. Upon binding ligand, these receptors dimerize and can activate gene<br>
transcription- either by directly binding to specific sequences on DNA (known as<br>
response elements) or by interacting with other transcription factors (such as API),<br>
which in tum bind directly to specific DNA sequences [Moggs and Orphanides, EMBO<br>
Reports 2: 775-781 (2001), Hall, et al., Journal of Biological Chemistry 276: 36869-<br>
36872 (2001), McDonnell, Principles Of Molecular Regulation. p351-361(2000)]. A<br>
class of "coregulatory" proteins can also interact with the ligand-bound receptor and<br>
further modulate its transcriptional activity [McKenna, et al., Endocrine Reviews 20:<br>
321-344 (1999)]. It has also been shown that estrogen receptors can suppress NFkB-<br>
mediated transcription in both a ligand-dependent and independent manner<br>
[Quaedackers, et al., Endocrinology 142: 1156-1166 (2001), Boat, et al.. Journal of<br>
Steroid Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Biology 61: 233-240 (1998), Pelzer. et al.,<br>
Biochemical &amp; Biophysical Research Communications 286: 1153-7 (2001)].<br>
[0003] Estrogen receptors can also be activated by phosphorylation. This<br>
phosphorylation is mediated by growth factors such as EGF and causes changes in gene<br>
transcription in the absence of ligand [Moggs and Orphanides, EMBO Reports 2: 775-<br>
781 (2001), Hall, et al., Journal of Biological Chemistry 276: 36869-36872 (2001)].<br>
[0004] A less well-characterized means by which estrogens can affect cells is<br>
through a so-called membrane receptor. The existence of such a receptor is<br>
controversial, but it has been well documented that estrogens can elicit very rapid non-<br>
genomic responses from cells. The molecular entity responsible for transducing these<br>
effects has not been definitively isolated, but there is evidence to suggest it is at least<br>
related to the nuclear forms of the estrogen receptors [Levin, Journal of Applied<br>
Physiology 91: 1860-1867 (2001), Levin, Trends in Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism 10:<br>
374-377 (1999)].<br>
[0005] Two estrogen receptors have been discovered to date. The first<br>
estrogen receptor was cloned about 15 years ago and is now referred to as ERa [Green,<br>
et al., Nature 320: 134-9 (1986)]. The second was found comparatively recently and is<br>
called ER(3 [Kuiper, et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the<br>
United States of America 93: 5925-5930 (1996)]. Early work on ERß focused on<br>
defining its affinity for a variety of ligands and, indeed, some differences with ERa<br>
were seen. The tissue distribution of ERß has been well mapped in the rodent and it is<br>
not coincident with ERcc. Tissues such as the mouse and rat uterus express<br>
predominantly ERoc, whereas the mouse and rat lung express predominantly ERß<br>
[Couse, et al., Endocrinology 138: 4613-4621 (1997), Kuiper, et al., Endocrinology 138:<br>
863-870 (1997)]. Even within the same organ, the distribution of ERa and ERß can be<br>
compartmentalized. For example, in the mouse ovary, ERß is highly expressed in the<br>
granulosa cells and ERa is restricted to the thecal and stromal cells [Sar and Welsch,<br>
Endocrinology 140: 963-971 (1999), Fitzpatrick, et al., Endocrinology 140: 2581-2591<br>
(1999)]. However, there are examples where the receptors are coexpressed and there is<br>
evidence from in vitro studies that ERa and ERp can form heterodimers [Cowley, et al..<br>
Journal of Biological Chemistry 272: 19858-19862 (1997)].<br>
[0006] The most potent endogenous estrogen is 17ß-estradiol. A large number<br>
of compounds have been described that either mimic or block the activity of 17(3-<br>
estradiol. Compounds having roughly the same biological effects as 17J3-estradio] are<br>
referred to as "estrogen receptor agonists". Those which block the effect of 170-<br>
estradiol, when given in combination with it, are called "estrogen receptor antagonists".<br>
In reality there is a continuum between estrogen receptor agonist and estrogen receptor<br>
antagonist activity and indeed some compounds behave as estrogen receptor agonists in<br>
some tissues but estrogen receptor antagonists in others. These compounds with mixed<br>
activity are called selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMS) and are<br>
therapeutically useful agents (e.g. EVTSTA) [McDonnell, Journal of the Society for<br>
Gynecologic Investigation 7: S10-S15 (2000&gt;, Goldstein, et al., Human Reproduction<br>
Update 6: 212-224 (2000)]. The precise reason why the same compound can have cell-<br>
specific effects has not been elucidated, but the differences in receptor conformation<br>
and/or in the milieu of coregulatory proteins have been suggested.<br>
[0007] It has been known for some time that estrogen receptors adopt different<br>
conformations when binding ligands. However, the consequence and subtlety of these<br>
changes only recently has been revealed. The three dimensional structures of ERa and<br>
ERß have been solved by co-crystallization with various ligands and clearly show the<br>
repositioning of helix 12 in the presence of an estrogen receptor antagonist which<br>
sterically hinders the protein sequences required for receptor-coregulatory protein<br>
interaction [Pike, et al., Embo 18: 4608-4618 (1999), Shiau, et al., Cell 95: 927-937<br>
(1998)]. In addition, the technique of phage display has been used to identify peptides<br>
that interact with estrogen receptors in the presence of different ligands [Paige, et al.,<br>
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 96:<br>
3999-4004 (1999)]. For example, a peptide was identified that distinguished between<br>
ERa bound to the full estrogen receptor agonists 17P-estradiol and diethylstilbesterol.<br>
A different peptide was shown to distinguish between clomiphene bound to ERa and<br>
ERß. These data indicate that each ligand potentially places the receptor in a unique<br>
and unpredictable conformation that is likely to have distinct biological activities.<br>
[0008] As mentioned above, estrogens affect a panoply of biological processes.<br>
In addition, where gender differences have been described (e.g. disease frequenciences,<br>
responses to challenge, etc) it is possible that the explanation involves the difference in<br>
estrogen levels between males and females.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0012] This invention provides aryl-carbaldehyde oxime derivatives. These<br>
compounds, which preferably act as estrogenic agents, are useful for the treatment and<br>
prevention of diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases (including Crohn's disease<br>
and colitis). In one aspect, the invention is directed to compounds of formula I:<br>

bases, such as alkali metal salts (for example, sodium, lithium, or potassium) alkaline<br>
earth metal salts, ammonium salts, alkylammonium salts containing 1-6 carbon atoms or<br>
dialkylammonium salts containing 1-6 carbon atoms in each alkyl group, and<br>
trialkylammonium salts containing 1-6 carbon atoms in each alkyl group, when a<br>
compound of this invention contains an acidic moiety.<br>
[0015] The term "aryl" means a carbocyclic aromatic ring of 6 to 10 carbon<br>
atoms such as phenyl. The term "heteroaryl" means a 5 or 6 membered aromatic ring<br>
containing 1 or more heteroatoms, eg 1 to 3, selected from oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur.<br>
Aryl and heteroaryl groups may be optionally substituted.<br>
[0016] The term "alkyl", as used herein, whether used alone or as part of<br>
another group, refers to a substituted or unsubstituted aliphatic hydrocarbon chain and<br>
includes, but is not limited to, straight and branched chains containing from 1 to 12<br>
carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms, unless explicitly specified otherwise. For<br>
example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, i-butyl and t-butyl are encompassed by<br>
the term "alkyl." Specifically included within the definition of "alkyl" are those<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbon chains that are optionally substituted.<br>
[0017] The carbon number as used in the definitions herein refers to carbon<br>
backbone and carbon branching, but does not include carbon atoms of the substituents,<br>
such as alkoxy substitutions and the like.<br>

another group, refers to a substituted or unsubstituted aliphatic hydrocarbon chain and<br>
includes, but is not limited to, straight and branched chains having 2 to 8 carbon atoms<br>
and containing at least one double bond. Preferably, the alkenyl moiety has 1 or 2<br>
double bonds. Such alkenyl moieties may exist in the E or Z conformations and the<br>
compounds of this invention include both conformations. Specifically included within<br>
the definition of "alkenyl" are those aliphatic hydrocarbon chains that are optionally<br>
substituted. Heteroatoms, such as O, S or N-R1 attached to an alkenyl should not be<br>
attached to a carbon atom that is bonded to a double bond.<br>
[0019] The term "phenyl", as used herein, whether used alone or as part of<br>
another group, refers to a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl group.<br>
[0020] An optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, heteroaryl and phenyl<br>
may be substituted with one or more substituents. Suitable optionally substituents may<br>
be selected independently from nitro, cyano, -N(Rn)(R12), halo, hydroxy, carboxy,<br>

and heteroaryl include -N(Rn)(RI2), alkyl, halo, perfluoroalkyl, perfluoroalkoxy.<br>
arylalkyl and alkylaryl.<br>
[0021] The term halogen includes bromine, chlorine, fluorine, and iodine.<br>
The term "lower alkyl" refers to an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, in<br>
some preferred embodiments 1 to 3 carbon atoms.<br>
[0022] The term "lower alkoxy," as used herein, refers to the group R-O-<br>
where R is an alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, in some preferred embodiments 1 to 3<br>
carbon atoms.<br>
[0023] As used in accordance with this invention, the term "providing," with<br>
respect to providing a compound or substance covered by this invention, means either<br>
directly administering such a compound or substance, or administering a prodrug,<br>
derivative, or analog which will form the effective amount of the compound or<br>
substance within the body.<br>
[0024] The compounds of this invention are estrogen receptor modulators<br>
useful in the treatment or inhibition of conditions, disorders, or disease states that are at<br>
least partially mediated by an estrogen deficiency or excess, or which may be treated or<br>
inhibited through the use of an estrogenic agent. The compounds of this invention are<br>
particularly useful in treating a peri-menopausal, menopausal, or postmenopausal patient<br>
in which the levels of endogenous estrogens produced are greatly diminished.<br>
Menopause is generally defined as the last natural menstrual period and is characterized<br>
by the cessation of ovarian function, leading to the substantial diminution of circulating<br>
estrogen in the bloodstream. As used herein, menopause also includes conditions of<br>
decreased estrogen production that may be surgically, chemically, or be caused by a<br>
disease state which leads to premature diminution or cessation of ovarian function.<br>
[0025] Accordingly, the compounds of this invention are useful in treating or<br>
inhibiting osteoporosis and in the inhibition of bone demineralization, which may result<br>
from an imbalance in a individual's formation of new bone tissues and the resorption of<br>
older tissues, leading to a net loss of bone. Such bone depletion results in a range of<br>
individuals, particularly in post-rnenopausal women, women who have undergone<br>
bilateral oophorectomy, those receiving or who have received extended corticosteroid<br>
therapies, those experiencing gonadal dysgenesis, and those suffering from Cushing's<br>
syndrome. Special needs for bone, including teeth and oral bone, replacement can also<br>
be addressed using these compounds in individuals with bone fractures, defective bone<br>
structures, and those receiving bone-related surgeries and/or the implantation of<br>
prosthesis. In addition to those problems described above, these compounds can be used<br>
in treatment or inhibition for osteoarthritis, hypocalcemia, hypercalcemia, Paget's<br>
disease, osteomalacia, osteohalisteresis, multiple myeloma and other forms of cancer<br>
having deleterious effects on bone tissues.<br>
[0026] The compounds of this invention are also useful in treating or inhibiting<br>
benign or malignant abnormal tissue growth, including prostatic hypertrophy, uterine<br>
leiomyomas, breast cancer, endometriosis, endometrial cancer, polycystic ovary<br>
syndrome, endometrial polyps, benign breast disease, adenomyosis, ovarian cancer,<br>
melanoma, prostrate cancer, cancers of the colon, CNS cancers, such as glioma or<br>
astioblastomia.<br>
[0027] The compounds of this invention are cardioprotective and they are<br>
useful in lowering cholesterol, triglycerides, Lp(a), and LDL levels; inhibiting or<br>
treating hypercholesteremia; hyperlipidemia; cardiovascular disease; atherosclerosis;<br>
peripheral vascular disease; restenosis, and vasospasm; and inhibiting vascular wall<br>
damage from cellular events leading toward immune mediated vascular damage. These<br>
cardiovascular protective properties are of great importance when treating<br>
postmenopausal patients with estrogens to inhibit osteoporosis and in the male when<br>
estrogen therapy is indicated.<br>
[0028] The compounds of this invention are also antioxidants, and are<br>
therefore useful in treating or inhibiting free radical induced disease states. Specific<br>
situations in which antioxidant therapy is indicated to be warranted are with cancers,<br>
central nervous system disorders, Alzheimer's disease, bone disease, aging,<br>
inflammatory disorders, peripheral vascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune<br>
diseases, respiratory distress, emphysema, prevention of reperfusion injury, viral<br>
hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, tuberculosis, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus,<br>
adult respiratory distress syndrome, central nervous system trauma and stroke.<br>
[0029] The compounds of this invention are also useful in providing cognition<br>
enhancement, and in treating or inhibiting senile dementias, Alzheimer's disease,<br>
cognitive decline, neurodegenerative disorders, providing neuroprotection or cognition<br>
enhancement.<br>
[0030] The compounds of this invention are also useful in treating or inhibiting<br>
inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative proctitis, Crohn's disease, and colitis;<br>
menopausal related conditions, such as vasomotor symptoms including hot flushes,<br>
vaginal or vulvar atrophy, atrophic vaginitis, vaginal dryness, pruritus, dyspareunia,<br>
dysuria, frequent urination, urinary incontinence, urinary tract infections, vasomotor<br>
symptoms, including hot flushes, myalgia, arthralgia, insomnia, irritability, and the like;<br>
male pattern baldness: skin atrophy; acne; type II diabetes; dysfunctional uterine<br>
bleeding; and infertility.<br>
[0031] The compounds of this invention are useful in disease states where<br>
amenorrhea is advantageous, such as leukemia, endometrial ablations, chronic renal or<br>
hepatic disease or coagulation diseases or disorders.<br>
[0032] The compounds of this invention can be used as a contraceptive agent,<br>
particularly when combined with a progestin.<br>
[0033] When administered for the treatment or inhibition of a particular<br>
disease state or disorder, it is understood that the effective dosage may vary depending<br>
upon the particular compound utilized, the mode of administration, the condition, and<br>
severity thereof, of the condition being treated, as well as the various physical factors<br>
related to the individual being treated. Effective administration of the compounds of<br>
this invention may be given at an oral dose of from about 0.1 mg/day to about 1,000<br>
mg/day. Preferably, administration will be from about 10 mg/day to about 600 mg/day,<br>
more preferably from about 50 mg/day to about 600 mg/day, in a single dose or in two<br>
or more divided doses. The projected daily dosages are expected to vary with route of<br>
administration.<br>
[0034] Such doses may be administered in any manner useful in directing the<br>
active compounds herein to the recipient's bloodstream, including orally, via implants,<br>
parenterally (including intravenous, intraperitoneal and subcutaneous injections),<br>
rectally, intranasally, vaginally, and transdermally.<br>
[0035] Oral formulations containing the active compounds of this invention<br>
may comprise any conventionally used oral forms, including tablets, capsules, buccal<br>
forms, troches, lozenges and oral liquids, suspensions or solutions. Capsules may<br>
contain mixtures of the active compound(s) with inert fillers and/or diluents such as the<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable starches (e.g. corn, potato or tapioca starch), sugars,<br>
artificial sweetening agents, powdered celluloses, such as crystalline and<br>
microcrystalline celluloses, flours, gelatins, gums, etc. Useful tablet formulations may<br>
be made by conventional compression, wet granulation or dry granulation methods and<br>
utilize pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, binding agentis, lubricants, disintegrants,<br>
surface modifying agents (including surfactants), suspending or stabilizing agents,<br>
including, but not limited to, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, talc, sodium lauryl<br>
sulfate, microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose calcium,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, alginic acid, acacia gum, xanthan gum, sodium citrate,<br>
complex silicates, calcium carbonate, glycine, dextrin, sucrose, sorbitol, dicalcium<br>
phosphate, calcium sulfate, lactose, kaolin, mannitol, sodium chloride, talc, dry starches<br>
and powdered sugar. Preferred surface modifying agents include nonionic and anionic<br>
surface modifying agents. Representative examples of surface modifying agents<br>
include, but are not limited to, poloxamer 188, benzalkonium chloride, calcium stearate,<br>
cetostearl alcohol, cetomacrogol emulsifying wax, sorbitan esters, colloidol silicon<br>
dioxide, phosphates, sodium dodecylsulfate, magnesium aluminum silicate, and<br>
triethanolamine. Oral formulations herein may utilize standard delay or time release<br>
formulations to alter the absorption of the active compound(s). The oral formulation<br>
may also consist of administering the active ingredient in water or a fruit juice,<br>
containing appropriate solubilizers or emulsifiers as needed.<br>
[0036] In some cases it may be desirable to administer the compounds directly<br>
to the airways in the form of an aerosol.<br>
[0037] The compounds of this invention may also be administered parenterally<br>
or intraperitoneally. Solutions or suspensions of these active compounds as a free base<br>
or pharmacologically acceptable salt can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a<br>
surfactant such as hydroxy-propylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in<br>
glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary<br>
conditions of storage and use, these preparation contain a preservative to prevent the<br>
growth of microorganisms.<br>
[0038] The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile<br>
aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous<br>
preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be<br>
sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable<br><br>
under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the<br>
contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be<br>
a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g.,<br>
glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof,<br>
and vegetable oils.<br>
[0039] For the purposes of this disclosure, transdermal administrations are<br>
understood to include all administrations across the surface of the body and the inner<br>
linings of bodily passages including epithelial and mucosal tissues. Such<br>
administrations may be carried out using the present compounds, or pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts thereof, in lotions, creams, foams, patches, suspensions, solutions, and<br>
suppositories (rectal and vaginal).<br>
[0040] Transdermal administration may be accomplished through the use of a<br>
transdermal patch containing the active compound and a carrier that is inert to the active<br>
compound, is non toxic to the skin, and allows delivery of the agent for systemic<br>
absorption into the blood stream via the skin. The carrier may take any number of forms<br>
such as creams and ointments, pastes, gels, and occlusive devices. The creams and<br>
ointments may be viscous liquid or semisolid emulsions of either the oil-in-water or<br>
water-in-oil type. Pastes comprised of absorptive powders dispersed in petroleum or<br>
hydrophilic petroleum containing the active ingredient may also be suitable. A variety<br>
of occlusive devices may be used to release the active ingredient into the blood stream<br>
such as a semi-permeable membrane covering a reservoir containing the active<br>
ingredient with or without a carrier, or a matrix containing the active ingredient. Other<br>
occlusive devices are known in the literature.<br>
[0041] Suppository formulations may be made from traditional materials,<br>
including cocoa butter, with or without the addition of waxes to alter the suppository's<br>
melting point, and glycerin. Water soluble suppository bases, such as polyethylene<br>
glycols of various molecular weights, may also be used.<br>
[0042] The reagents used in the preparation of the compounds of this invention<br>
can be either commercially obtained or can be prepared by standard procedures<br>
described in the literature.<br>
[0043] The preparation of several representative compounds are described in<br>
the following Schemes 1-7.<br><br>

Example 44<br>
[0087] Representative examples of the invention were evaluated for their<br>
ability to compete with 17ß-estradiol for both ERa and ERß. This test procedure<br>
provides the methodology for one to determine whether a particular compound binds to<br>
the estrogen receptor (and is therefore "estrogenic") and whether there is selectivity for<br>
ERa or ER|3. The values are shown in the Table infra and are reported as IC50S. 17ß-<br>
estradiol is included as a standard reference for comparison. The procedure used is<br>
briefly described below. A crude lysate of E. coli expressing the estrogen receptor<br>
ligand binding domains (D, E, &amp; F) of human ERa or ERp was prepared. Both<br>
receptors and compounds were diluted in 1X Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS) supplemented<br>
with 1 mM EDTA. Using a high binding masked microtiter plate, 100 uL of receptor (1<br>
uG/well) was combined with 2 nM [3H]-17P-estradiol and various concentrations of<br>
compound. After between 5 and 15 hours at room temperature, the plates were washed<br>
with DPBS/1 mM EDTA and bound radioactivity determined by liquid scintillation<br>
counting. The IC50 is defined as the concentration of compound that decreases total<br>
17P-estradiol binding by 50%. The results obtained are described in the table below.<br>
Table. l-(4'-Hydroxy-Phenyl)-Aryl-Carbaldehyde Oxime Derivatives<br><br>
[0088] The results obtained in the standard pharmacological test procedure<br>
demonstrate that the compounds of this invention are estrogenic compounds, some with<br>
strong preferential affinity for the ERp receptor. The compounds of this invention range<br>
from having high preferential affinity for ERp over ERa to almost equal affinity for<br>
both receptors. Thus, compounds of this invention will span a range of activity based, at<br>
least partially, on their receptor affinity selectivity profiles. Additionally, since each<br>
novel receptor ligand complex is unique and thus its interaction with various<br>
coregulatory proteins is unique, compounds of this invention will display different<br>
modulatory behavior depending on the cellular context they are in. For example, in<br>
some cell-types, it is possible for a compound to behave as an estrogen agonist while in<br>
other tissues, an antagonist. Compounds with such activity have sometimes been<br>
referred to as SERMs (Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators). Unlike many<br>
estrogens, however, many of the SERMs do not cause increases in uterine wet weight.<br>
These compounds are antiestrogenic in the uterus and can completely antagonize the<br>
trophic effects of estrogen agonists in uterine tissue. These compounds, however, act as<br>
estrogen agonists in the bone, cardiovascular, and central nervous systems. Due to this<br>
tissue selective nature of these compounds, they are useful in treating or preventing in a<br>
mammal disease states or syndromes which are caused or associated with an estrogen<br>
deficiency (in certain tissues such as bone or cardiovascular) or an excess of estrogen (in<br>
the uterus or mammary glands).<br>
[0089] Even beyond such cell-specific modulation, compounds of this<br>
invention also have the potential to behave as agonists on one receptor type while<br>
behaving as antagonists on the other. For example, it has been demonstrated that<br>
compounds can be an antagonist on ERp while being an agonist on ERa (Meyers,<br>
Marvin I; Sun, Jun; Carlson, Kathryn E.; Katzenellenbogen, Benita S.;<br>
Katfcenellenbogen, John A.. J. Med. Chem. (1999), 42(13), 2456-2468). Such ERSAA<br>
(Estrogen Receptor Selective Agonist Antagonist) activity provides for<br>
pharmacologically distinct estrogenic activity within this series of compounds.<br>
[0090] Standard pharmacological test procedures are readily available to<br>
determine the activity profile of a given test compound. The following briefly<br>
summarizes several representative test procedures procedures. Standard<br>
pharmacological test procedures for SERMs are also provided in US Patents 4,418,068<br>
and 5,998,402.<br>

Rat Uterotrophic/Antiuterotrophic Test Procedure<br><br>
[0091] The estrogenic and antiestrogenic properties of the compounds can be<br>
determined in an immature rat uterotrophic assay (4 day) that (as described previously<br>
by L.J.Black and R.L.Goode, Life Sciences, 26, 1453 (1980). Immature Sprague-<br>
Dawley rats (female, 18 days old) were tested in groups of six. The animals are treated<br>
by daily ip injection with 10 uG compound, 100 uG compound, (100 uG compound + 1<br>
uG 173-estradiol) to check antiestrogenicity, and 1 uG 17P-estradioI, with 50%<br>
DMSO/50% saline as the injection vehicle. On day 4 the animals are sacrificed by CO2<br>
asphyxiation and their uteri removed and stripped of excess lipid, any fluid removed and<br>
the wet weight determined. A small section of one horn is submitted for histology and<br>
the remainder used to isolate total RNA in order to evaluate complement component 3<br>

matched sham operated rats not receiving any treatment serve as an intact, estrogen<br>
replete control group for each study.<br>
[0093] All treatments are prepared in 1% tween 80 in normal saline at defined<br>
concentrations so that the treatment volume is 0.1mL/100g body weight. 17ß-estradiol is<br>
dissolved in corn oil (20 µg/mL) and delivered subcutaneously, 0.1 mL/rat. All dosages<br>
are adjusted at three week intervals according to group mean body weight<br>
measurements.<br>
[0094] Five weeks after the initiation of treatment and one week prior to the<br>
termination of the study, each rat is evaluated for bone mineral density (BMD). The<br>
total and trabecular density of the proximal tibia are evaluated in anesthetized rats using<br>
an XCT-960M (pQCT; Stratec Medizintechnik, Pforzheim, Germany). The<br>
measurements are performed as follows: Fifteen minutes prior to scanning, each rat is<br><br>
anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 45 mg/kg ketamine, 8.5 mg/kg xylazine,<br>
and 1.5 mg/kg acepromazine.<br>
[0095] The right hind limb is passed through a polycarbonate tube with a<br>
diameter of 25 mm and taped to an acrylic frame with the ankle joint at a 90° angle and<br>
the knee joint at 180°. The polycarbonate tube is affixed to a sliding platform that<br>
maintains it perpendicular to the aperture of the pQCT. The platform is adjusted so that<br>
the distal end of the femur and the proximal end of the tibia would be in the scanning<br>
field. A two dimensional scout view is run for a length of 10 mm and a line resolution<br>
of 0.2 mm. After the scout view is displayed on the monitor, the proximal end of the<br>
tibia is located. The pQCT scan is initiated 3.4 mm distal from this point. The pQCT<br>
scan is 1 mm thick, has a voxel (three dimensional pixel) size of 0.140 mm, and consists<br>
of 145 projections through the slice.<br>
[0096] After the pQCT scan is completed, the image is displayed on the<br>
monitor. A region of interest including the tibia but excluding the fibula is outlined.<br>
The soft tissue is automatically removed using an iterative algorithm. The density of the<br>
remaining bone (total density) is reported in mg/cm3. The outer 55% of the bone is<br>
peeled away in a concentric spiral. The density of the remaining bone (Trabecular<br>
density) is reported in mg/cm3. One week after BMD evaluation the rats are euthanized<br>
by carbon dioxide suffocation and blood collected for cholesterol determination. The<br>
uteri are removed and the weights taken. Total cholesterol is determined using a<br>
Boehringer-Mannheim Hitachi 911 clinical analyzer using the Cholesterol/HP kit.<br>
Statistics were compared using one-way analysis of variance with Dunnet's test.<br>

MCF-7/ERE Antiproliferative Test Procedure<br>
[0097] Stock solutions of test compounds (usually 0.1 M) are prepared in<br>
DMSO and then diluted 10 to 100-fold with DMSO to make working solutions of 1 or<br>
10 mM. The DMSO stocks are stored at either 4°C (0.1 M) or -20°C (
cells are passaged twice a week with growth medium [D-MEM/F-12 medium containing<br>
10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) Penicillin-Streptomycin, and 2<br>
mM glutaMax-1]. The cells are maintained in vented flasks at 37°C inside a 5%<br><br>
CO2/95% humidified air incubator. One day prior to treatment, the cells are plated with<br>
growth medium at 25,000/well into 96 well plates and incubated at 37°C overnight.<br>
[0098J The cells are infected for 2 hr at 37°C with 50 µl/well of a 1:10 dilution<br>
of adenovirus 5-ERE-tk-luciferase in experimental medium [phenol red-free D-MEM/F-<br>
12 medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactived charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum,<br>
1% (v/v) Penicillin-Streptomycin, 2 mM glutaMax-1, 1 mM sodium pyruvate]. The<br>
wells axe then washed once with 150 µ?. of experimental medium. Finally, the cells are<br>
treated for 24 hr at 37°C in replicates of 8 wells/treatment with 150 µ?/well of vehicle<br>
( 1000-fold into experimental<br>
medium.<br>
[0099] Initial screening of test compounds is done at a single dose of 1 u,M that<br>
is tested alone (agonist mode) or in combination with 0.1 nM 17|3~estradiol (EC80;<br>
antagonist mode). Each 96 well plate also includes a vehicle control group (0.1% v/v<br>
DMSO) and an agonist control group (either 0.1 or 1 nM 17(3-estradiol). Dose-response<br>
experiments are performed in either the agonist and/or antagonist modes on active<br>
compounds in log increases from 10"14 to 10"5 M. From these dose-response curves,<br>
EC50 and IC50 values, respectively, are generated. The final well in each treatment<br>
group contains 5 µl of 3 x 10-5 M ICI-182,780 (10-6 M final concentration) as an ER<br>
antagonist control.<br>
[0100] After treatment, the cells are lysed on a shaker for 15 rnin with 25<br>
µl/well of 1X cell culture lysis reagent (Promega Corporation). The cell lysates (20µl)<br>
are transferred to a 96 well luminometer plate, and luciferase activity is measured in a<br>
MicroLumat LB 96 P luminometer (EG &amp; G Berthold) using 100 µl/well of luciferase<br>
substrate (Promega Corporation). Prior to the injection of substrate, a 1 second<br>
background measurement is made for each well. Following the injection of substrate,<br>
luciferase activity is measured for 10 seconds after a 1 second delay. The data are<br>
transferred from the luminometer to a Macintosh personal computer and analyzed using<br>
the JMP software (SAS Institute); this program subtracts the background reading from<br>
the luciferase measurement for each well and then determines the mean and standard<br>
deviation of each treatment.<br>
[0101] The luciferase data are transformed by logarithms, and the Huber M-<br>
estimator is used to down-weight the outlying transformed observations. The JMP<br><br>
software is used to analyze the transformed and weighted data for one-way ANOVA<br>
(Dunnett's test). The compound treatments are compared to the vehicle control results<br>
in the agonist mode, or the positive agonist control results (0.1 nM 17|3-estradiol) in the<br>
antagonist mode. For the initial single dose experiment, if the compound treatment<br>
results are significantly different from the appropriate control (p
are reported as the percent relative to the 17fi-estradiol control [i.e., ((compound -<br>
vehicle control)/(17p-estradiol control - vehicle control)) x 100]. The IMP software is<br>
also used to determine the EC50 and/or IC50 values from the non-linear dose-response<br>
curves.<br>

Inhibition of LDL Oxidation - Antioxidant Activity<br>
[0102] Porcine aortas are obtained from an abattoir, washed, transported in<br>
chilled PBS, and aortic endothelial cells are harvested. To harvest the cells, the<br>
intercostal vessels of the aorta are tied off and one end of the aorta clamped. Fresh,<br>
sterile filtered, 0.2% collagenase (Sigma Type I) is placed in the vessel and the other<br>
end of the vessel then clamped to form a closed system. The aorta is incubated at 37°C<br>
for 15-20 minutes, after which the collagenase solution is collected and centrifuged for 5<br>
minutes at 2000 x g. Each pellet is suspended in 7 ml. of endothelial cell culture<br>
medium consisting of phenol red free DMEM/Ham's F12 media supplemented with<br>
charcoal stripped FBS (5%), NuSerum (5%), L-glutamine (4mM), penicillin-<br>
streptomycin (1000U/ml, 1000µg/ml) and gentimicin (75µg/ml), seeded in 100mm petri<br>
dish and incubated at 37°C in 5%CO2. After 20 minutes, the cells are rinsed with PBS<br>
and fresh medium added, this was repeated again at 24 hours. The cells are confluent<br>
after approximately 1 week. The endothelial cells are routinely fed twice a week and,<br>
when confluent, trypsinized and seeded at a 1:7 ratio. Cell mediated oxidation of 12.5<br>
µg/mL LDL is allowed to proceed in the presence of the compound to be evaluated (5<br>
uM) for 4 hours at 37 °C. Results are expressed as the percent inhibition of the oxidative<br>
process as measured by the TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) method for<br>
analysis of free aldehydes (Yagi K., Biochem Med 15:212-216 (1976)).<br>

D12 Hypothalmic Cell Test Procedure<br><br>
[0103] D12 rat hypothalamic cells are subcloned from the RCF17 parental cell<br>
line and stored frozen. They are routinely grown in DMEM:F12 (1:1), glutaMAX-1 (2<br>
mM); penicillin (100 U/ml)-streptomycin (100 rag/ml), plus 10% fetal bovine serum<br>
(FBS). The cells are plated in phenol red-free medium (DMEM:F12, glutaMAX,<br>
penicillin-streptomycin) containing 2-10% charcoal stripped FBS at a subconfluent<br>
density (1-4 x 10 6 cells/ 150 mm dish). The cells are refed 24 h later with medium<br>
containing 2% stripped serum. To test for agonist activity, cells are treated with 10 nM<br>
17b-estradiol or various doses of test compound (1 mM or a range from 1 pM to 1 mM).<br>
To test for antagonist activity the cells are treated with 0.1 nM 17(3-estradiol in the<br>
absence or presence of varying doses (100 pM to 1 mM) of test compound. Control<br>
dishes are also treated with DMSO as a negative control. Forty-eight hours after<br>
hormone addition, the cells are lysed and binding test procedure performed.<br>
[0104] For each binding test procedure 100-150 mg protein is incubated with<br>
10 nM 3H-R5020 + 100-fold excess R5020 in a 150 ml volume. Triplicate reactions<br>
(three with R5020, three without R5020) are prepared in a 96 well plate. The protein<br>
extract is added first followed by 3H-R5020 or 3H-R5020 + lOOx unlabeled R5020. The<br>
reaction is performed for 1-2 hr at room temperature . The reaction is stopped by the<br>
addition of 100 ml cold 5% charcoal (Norit SX-4), 0.5% dextran 69K (Pharmacia) in TE<br>
pH 7.4 . After 5 min at room temperature, the bound and unbound ligand are separated<br>
by centrifugation (5 min, 1000 RCF, 4°C). The supernatant solution (-150 ml) is<br>
removed and transferred to a scintillation vial. Following the addition of scintillation<br>
fluid (Beckman Ready Protein+), the samples are counted for 1 min in a scintillation<br>
counter.<br>

Progesterone Receptor in the CNS Preoptic Area<br>
[0105] Sixty (60) day old female Sprague-Dawley rats are ovariectomized.<br>
The animals are housed in an animal care facility with a 12-h light, 12-h dark<br>
photoperiod and free access to tap water and rodent chow.<br>
[0106] Ovariectomized animals are randomly divided into groups that are<br>
injected with vehicle (50% DMSO, 40% PBS, 10% ethanol vehicle), 17|3-estradiol<br>
(200ng/kg) or the compound to be tested. Additional animals are injected with the test<br>
compound lhr prior to injection of 17P-estradiol to evaluate the antagonistic properties<br><br>
of this compound. Six hrs after s.c. injection, animals are euthanized with a lethal dose<br>
of CO2 and their brains collected and frozen.<br>
[0107] Tissue collected from animals is cut on a cryostat at -16°C and<br>
collected on Silane-coated microscope slides. The section-mounted slides are then dried<br>
on a slide warmer maintained at 42°C and stored in desiccated slide boxes at -S0°C.<br>
Prior to processing, the desiccated slide boxes are slowly warmed to room temperature<br>
(-20°C for 12-16 hrs; 4oC for 2 hrs; room temperature for 1 hr) to eliminate<br>
condensation formation on slides and thus minimize tissue and RNA degradation. The<br>
dry slides are loaded into metal racks, postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 9.0) for 5<br>
min and processed as previously described.<br>
[0108] A plasmid containing a 815bp fragment of the rat PR cDNA 9 (ligand<br>
binding domain) is linearized and used to generate a S 35 -UTP labeled probe that is<br>
complimentary to a portion of the rat PR mRNA. Processed section-mounted slides are<br>
hybridized with 200ml of hybridization mix containing the riboprobe (4-6x10 6 DPM/<br>
slide) and 50% formamide and incubated overnight in a 55 °C humidified chamber. In<br>
the morning, the slides are placed in metal racks that are immersed in 2xSSC (0.15M<br>
NaCl, 0.015M sodium citrate; pH 7.0) / 10mM DTT. The racks are all transferred to a<br>
large container and washed in 2xSSC/ lOmM DTT for 15 min at RT with gentle<br>
agitation. Slides are then washed in RNase buffer at 37°C for 30 min, treated with<br>
RNase A (20mg/ml) for 30 min at 37°C, and washed for 15 min in room temperature 1X<br>
SSC. Subsequently, the slides are washed (2 X 30 min) in 65°C in 0.1X SSC to remove<br>
nonspecific label, rinsed in room temperature 0.1X SSC for 15 min and dehydrated with<br>
a graded series of alcohol: ammonium acetate (70%, 95%, and 100%). Air dried slides<br>
are opposed to x-ray film for 3 days and then photographically processed. The slides<br>
from all animals are hybridized, washed, exposed and photographically processed<br>
together to eliminate differences due to interassay variation in conditions.<br>

Rat Hot Flush - CNS Effects<br>
[0109] Ovariectomized-female, 60 day-old Sprague-Dawley rats are obtained<br>
following surgery. The surgeries are done a minimum of 8 days prior to the first<br><br>
treatment. The animals are housed individually under 12 h light/dark cycle and given<br>
standard rat chow and water ad libitum.<br>
[0110] Two control groups are included in every study. Doses are prepared<br>
based on mg/kg mean group body weight in either 10% DMSO in sesame oil (sc<br>
studies) or in 1.0% tween 80 in saline (po studies). Animals are administered test<br>
compounds at doses ranging from 0.01 to 10 mg/kg mean group body weight. Vehicle<br>
and ethinyl estradiol (EE) controls (0.1 mg/kg, sc or 0.3 mg/kg, po) control groups are<br>
included in each test. When the compounds are tested for their antagonist activity, EE is<br>
coadministered at 0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg for sc or po studies, respectively. The test<br>
compounds are administered up to the day tail skin temperature is measured.<br>
[0111] After the acclimation period of four days, the animals are treated once<br>
daily with the compound(s) of interest. There are 10 animals/treatment group.<br>
Administration of the compound is either by sc injection of 0.1 ml in the nape of the<br>
neck or po in a volume of 0.5 ml. On the 3rd day of treatment, a morphine pellet (75 mg<br>
morphine sulfate) is implanted subcutaneously. On the 5th day of treatment, one or two<br>
additional morphine pellets are implanted. On the eighth day, approximately half of the<br>
animals are injected with Ketamine (80 mg/kg, intramuscularly) and a thermocouple,<br>
connected with to a MacLab Data Acquisition System (API Insturments, Milford, MA)<br>
is taped on the tail approximately one inch from the root of the tail. This system allowed<br>
the continuous measurement of tail skin temperature. Baseline temperature is measured<br>
for 15 min, then naloxone (1.0 mg/kg) is given sc (0.2 ml) to block the effect of<br>
morphine and tail skin temperature is measured for one hour thereafter. On the ninth<br>
day, the remaining of the animals are set up and analyzed similarly.<br>

Vasomotor Function in Isolated Rat Aortic Rings<br>
[0112] Sprage-Dawley rats (240-260 grams) are divided into 4 groups:<br>
1. Normal non-ovariectomized (intact)<br>
2. Ovariectomized (ovex) vehicle treated<br>
3. Ovariectomized 17-ß-estradiol treated (1mg/kg/day)<br>
4. Ovariectomized animals treated with test compound (i.e., lmg/kg/day)<br>
[0113] Animals are ovariectomized approximately 3 weeks prior to treatment.<br>
Each animal receives 1mg/kg/day of either 17ß-estradiol sulfate or test compound<br><br>
suspended in distilled, deionized water with 1% tween-80 by gastric gavage. Vehicle<br>
treated animals received an appropriate volume of the vehicle used in the drug treated<br>
groups.<br>
[0114] Animals are euthanized by CO2 inhalation and exsanguination. Their<br>
thoracic aortas are rapidly removed and placed in 37°C physiological solution with the<br>
following composition (mM): NaCl (54.7), KC1 (5.0), NaHCO3 (25.0), MgCl2 2H2O<br>
(2.5), D-glucose (11.8) and CaCl2 (0.2) gassed with CO2-O2, 95%/5% for a final pH of<br>
7.4. The advantitia is removed from the outer surface and the vessel is cut into 2-3 mm<br>
wide rings. Rings are suspended in at 10 mL tissue bath with one end attached to the<br>
bottom of the bath and the other to a force transducer. A resting tension of 1 gram is<br>
placed on the rings. Rings are equilibrated for 1 hour, signals are acquired and analyzed.<br>
[0115] After equilibration, the rings are exposed to increasing concentrations<br>
of phenylephrine (10-8 to 10-4 M) and the tension recorded. Baths are then rinsed 3 times<br>
with fresh buffer. After washout, 200 mM L-NAME is added to the tissue bath and<br>
equilibrated for 30 minutes. The phenylephrine concentration response curve is then<br>
repeated.<br>
Example 53<br>
Eight Arm Radial Arm Maze - Cognition Enhancement<br>
[0116] Male Sprague-Dawley, CD rats (Charles River, Kingston, NY)<br>
weighing 200-250 g on arrival are used. For one week, the rats are housed, six per cage,<br>
with standard laboratory chow and water available ad libitum. Housing is in a colony<br>
room maintained at 22°C and had a 12 hour light/dark cycle with lights on at 6:00 AM.<br>
Following habituation to the facility, animals are individually housed and maintained at<br>
85% of free-feeding weight Once stable weights are attained, the rats are acclimated to<br>
the 8-arm radial maze.<br>
[0117] The structure of the maze is an adaptation from that of Peele and Baron<br>
(Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior, 29:143-150, 1988). The maze is elevated<br>
to a height of 75.5 cm and composed of a circular area surrounded by 8 arms radiating<br>
away from the center, equidistant from one another. Each arm is 58 cm long x 13 cm<br>
high. A clear plexiglass cylinder is lowered to enclose the animal in the center portion<br>
of the maze prior to the start of each session. Each arm of the maze is equipped with 3<br><br>
sets of photocells interfaced to a data acquisition unit, which in turn is interfaced to a<br>
computer. The photocells are used to track the movement of the rat in the maze. Pellet<br>
feeders located above food cups at the end of each arm, dispensed two 45 mg chocolate<br>
pellets when the outer photocell ol the arm is activated for the first time in a given<br>
session. The maze is located in a testing room with black and white geometric posters<br>
on each wall to serve as visual cues. During all training and testing procedures, white<br>
noise is audible (~ 70 db).<br>
[0118] The training procedure consists of five phases, each with daily sessions<br>
lasting 5 or 10 minutes. A 10 second delay is imposed between the time the rat is placed<br>
in the center portion of the maze and when the cylinder is raised to begin the session.<br>
During Phase 1, food-restricted pairs of rats are placed on the maze for 10 minutes with<br>
45 mg chocolate food pellets scattered throughout the 8 arms of the maze. During Phase<br>
II, each rat is placed individually on the maze for a 10 minute period, with pellets<br>
scattered from the middle photocell to the food cup of each arm. During Phase III, each<br>
rat is placed on the maze for a 10 minute period, with food pellets located only in and<br>
around the food cups in each arm. In Phase IV, each rat is allowed 10 minutes to collect<br>
two pellets from each arm. Re-entry into an arm is considered an error. Flats are trained<br>
daily in this manner until they achieved criterion performance with less than or equal to<br>
2 total errors on three consecutive days of training. Total habituation and training time<br>
is approximately 3 weeks.<br>
[0119] Test compound is prepared in phosphate buffered saline and<br>
administered in a volume of 1 ml/kg. Scopolamine HBr (0.3 mg/kg s.c.) served as the<br>
impairing agent, producing an increase in error rate (loss of memory). Test compound is<br>
given intraperitoneally simultaneously with scopolamine, 30 minutes prior to the first<br>
maze exposure on any given test day.<br>
[0120] To assess the test compound, an 8 x 8 balanced latin square for repeated<br>
measures is designed, in order to achieve a high experimental efficiency with the least<br>
amount of animals. Eight experimental sessions, two per week, are conducted with the<br>
8 treatments (vehicle, scopolamine, 3 doses of test compound in combination with<br>
scopolamine) randomized within each session. Each treatment followed every other<br>
treatment the same number of times. Therefore, the residual effect of every treatment<br>
could be estimated and removed from the direct treatment effect. Following ANOVA,<br>
multiple comparisons are performed using Dunnett's two-sided test on adjusted means.<br><br>
[0121] Animals that did not make 4 correct choices within 5 minutes during<br>
the first exposure, or that had not made a total of S choices by the end of the 2nd<br>
exposure, are considered to have "timed-out" for that session. Any animal that "timed-<br>
out" following administration of more than one dose of the test compound is excluded<br>
from the analysis.<br>

Inhibition of Time-Dependent Death of Cells in Primary Cortical Neuron<br>
Cultures<br>
[0122] Primary cortical neurons were produced from rat brains that were 0-1<br>
day old using a variation of methods described by Monyer et al. 1989, Brain Research<br>
483:347-354. Dispersed brain tissue was grown in DMEM/10% PDHS (pregnant donor<br>
horse serum) for three days and then treated with cytosine arabinoside (ARC) for two<br>
days to remove contaminating glial cells. On day 5, the ARC media was removed and<br>
replaced with DMEM/10% PDHS. The neuronal cells were cultured for a further 4-7<br>
days before use.<br>
[0123] Control primary neuronal cultures show progressive cell death between<br>
days 12 and 18 in culture. Twelve cultures were evaluated on days 12 and 16 for levels<br>
of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LD) after adding test compound to 6 cultures<br>
maintained in DMEM and 10% PDHS on day 9 and maintaining the remaining cultures<br>
as controls. LD was assayed using a variation of the method by Wroblewski et al. 1955,<br>
Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 90:210-213. LD is a cytosolic enzyme which is commonly<br>
used in both clinical and basic research to determine tissue viability. An increase in<br>
media LD is directly related to cell death.<br>

[0124] C6 glioma cells obtained from ATCC were plated in RPMI media with<br>
FBS at a concentration of 1 x 10 cells/ml in FALCON 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks.<br>
Four hours prior to the onset of hypoglycemia, the maintenance media was discarded,<br>
monolayers were washed twice in the appropriate media and then incubated for four<br>
hours at 37°C in either serum free or serum free plus test compound. Kreb's Ringer<br>
Phosphate buffer was used to wash the monolayers twice before the addition of<br>
pptopriate glucose treatment. RPMI medium contains 2 mg glucose/ml; flasks were<br>
divided into groups of 6 each receiving 100% glucose (2 mg/ml), 80% glucose (1.6<br>
mg/ml), 60% glucose (1.2 mg/ml) or 0% glucose (buffer) or supplemented with test<br>

Cells are flushed with 90% N2/10% CO2 for 10 min in an airtight chamber and<br>
incubated at 37 °C for 6 hrs. After 6 hrs, both control and OGD cells are subject to<br>
replacement of media containing either vehicle (DMSO) or test compound in glucose-<br>
containing DMEM with custom B27. Cells are returned to normoxic incubator at 37 °C.<br>
After 24 hrs, cells are fixed in 4 % PFA for 10 min at 4 oC and stained with Topro<br>
(Fluorescent nuclear binding dye). Apoptosis is assessed using Laser Scanning<br>

Cells are flushed with 90% N2/10% CO2 for 10 min in an airtight chamber and<br>
incubated at 37 °C for 6 hrs. After 6 hrs, both control and OGD cells are subject to<br>
replacement of media containing either vehicle (DMSO) or test compound in glucose-<br>
containing DMEM with custom B27. Cells are returned to normoxic incubator at 37 °C.<br>
After 24 hrs, cell death is assessed by measuring cellular release of LDH (lactate<br>
dehydrogenase) into the culture medium. For LDH assay, an aliquot of 50 µl culture<br>
medium is transferred into the 96 well plate. After the addition of 140 ul 0.1M<br>
potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and 100 |il 0.2 mg/rnl NADH, the plate is let sit in<br>
the dark at room temperature for 20 min. The reaction is initiated by the addition of 10<br>
µl of sodium pyruvate. The plate is read immediately at 340 nM in a Thermomax plate<br>
reader (Molecular Devices). The absorbance, an index of NADH concentration, is<br>
recorded every 6 seconds for 5 minutes and the slope indicating the rate of NADH<br>
disappearance is used to calculate LDH activity.<br>
LDH Activity(U/ml) = (AA/min) (TCF)(20) (0.0S33)/(.78)<br>
where: 0.0833 = proportionality constant<br>
0.78 = instrument light path length (cm)<br>

HLA Rat Test Procedure - Crohn's Disease and Inflammatory Bowel Disorders<br>
[0128] Male HLA-B27 rats are obtained from Taconic and provided<br>
unrestricted access to a food (PMI Lab diet 5001) and water. At the start of the study,<br>
rats are 22-26 weeks old.<br>
[0129] Rats are dosed subcutaneously once per day for seven days with one of<br>
the formulations listed below. There are five rats in each group and the last dose is<br>
administered two hours before euthanasia.<br>
• vehicle (50% DMSO/50% Dulbecco' s PBS)<br><br>
• 17a-ethinyl-17ß-estradiol (10ag/kg)<br>
• test compound<br>
[0130] Stool quality is observed daily and graded according to the following<br>
scale: Diarrhea = 3; soft stoo] = 2; normal stool = 1. At the end of the test procedure,<br>
serum is collected and stored at -70 °C. A section of colon is prepared for histological<br>
analysis and an additional segment is analyzed for myeloperoxidase activity.<br>
[0131] The following method is used to measure myeloperoxidase activity.<br>
Colon tissue is harvested and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. A representative sample of<br>
the entire colon is used to ensure consistency between samples. The tissue is stored at<br>
-80 °C until use. Next, the tissue is weighed (approximately 500mg) and homogenized<br>
in 1:15 w/v of 5mM H2KPO4 (pH6) washing buffer. The tissue is spun down at 20,000<br>
x g in a Sorvall RC 5B centrifuge for 45 minutes at 2-8 °C. Supernatant is then<br>
discarded. Tissue is resuspended and homogenized in 2.5ml (1:5 w/v) of 50mM<br>
H2KPO4 with 10mM EDTA and 0.5% Hex Ammonium Bromide to help solubilize the<br>
intracellular MPO. Tissue is frozen in liquid Nitrogen, thawed in a 37 °C-water bath and<br>
sonicated for 15 seconds to ensure membrane lysis. This procedure is repeated 3 times.<br>
Samples are then kept on ice for 20 minutes and centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 15<br>
minutes at 2-8 °C. The supernatant is analyzed following these steps.<br>
[0132] The test mixture is prepared by adding 2.9ml of 50mM H2KPO4 with<br>
0.167 O-Dianisidine/ml with 0.0005% H2O2 into a reaction tube. When hydrogen<br>
peroxide is degraded, O-Dianisidine is oxidized and absorbs at 460nm in a concentration<br>
dependent manner. The mixture is heated to 25 °C. One hundred (100) µL of the<br>
tissue supernatant is added to the reaction tube, incubated for one minute at 25 °C, then<br>
1ml is transferred to a disposable plastic cuvette. OD is measured every 2 minutes<br>
reaction time at 460nm against a blank containing 2.9 ml of the reaction mixture and<br>
100µl of the 0.5% ammonium bromide solution.<br>
[0133] Enzyme activity units are quantified by comparison of absorbence @<br>
460 to a standard curve prepared with purified human MPO 31.1 Units/Vial. The MPO<br>
is reconstituted and serially diluted using 50mM H2KPO4 with lOmM EDTA and 0.5%<br>
Hex Ammonium Bromide to four known concentrations. Sample absorbencies are<br>
compared against this curve to determine activity.<br><br>
[0134] Histological analysis is performed as follows. Colonic tissue is<br>
immersed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Each specimen of colon is separated into<br>
four samples for evaluation. The formalin-fixed tissues are processed in a vacuum<br>
infiltration processor for paraffin embedding. The samples are sectioned at 5 p.m and<br>
then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) for blinded histologic evaluations using<br>
a scale modified after Boughton-Smith. After the scores are completed the samples are<br>
unblinded, and data are tabulated and analyzed by ANOVA linear modeling with<br>
multiple mean comparisons.<br>
