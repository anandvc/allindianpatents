THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to transfer systems and, more specifically, to a transfer device and transfer system for supporting and transporting one or more apparatus.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention is particularly applicable in supporting and transporting medical devices used in the care of a patient, and shall be described with particular reference thereto. However, it will be appreciated that the present invention may find advantageous application in supporting and transporting other types of objects in other applications.<br>
In modern hospitals and medical facilities, a great deal of medical equipment is used in the care and treatment of patients. It is quite common for a patient to be connected to a number of different medical devices, such as pumps for administrating intravenous (IV) fluids, monitors, oxygen tanks, electrical strips and the like. Typically, these medical devices are mounted onto a vertical pole, conventionally referred to as an "IV pole." It has been known to support IV poles on a wheeled base that can be positioned adjacent a hospital bed or can be transported with the bed to another location.<br>
In recent years, the number and size of medical devices routinely attached to a patient has increased, thus requiring more sturdy structures for supporting such equipment. For these and other reasons, it is necessary that a support or pole, and the associated medical devices attached thereto, be firmly supported near a patient. In this respect, mounting a support pole and its associated devices to a rigid, stationary surface, such as a wall or ceiling, is becoming preferable because it provides better structural support for the pole.<br>
At the same time, it is often necessary to transport a patient, together with the medical devices that are operatively connected to the patient, to another location in the hospital for medical procedures or testing. At these times, it is necessary that the support pole and medical devices be easily transferred from the wall<br><br><br>
or ceiling support to a hospital bed, or to some other type of patient-transfer vehicle, for movement to another location.<br>
The present invention provides a support and transfer device for supporting and transporting one or more medical devices between a wall or ceiling support and a patient-transfer vehicle, which system provides positive transfer from one to another, and vice-a-versa.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a transfer device transferable from one support to another support. The transfer device is comprised of a housing having first and second support-receiving recesses. Each recess is dimensioned to receive a support therein. A first clamping element is mounted to the housing. The first clamping element is associated with the first recess and is movable relative thereto between a support-clamping position wherein the first clamping element captures the support in the first recess and a release position wherein the support is movable into and out of the first recess. A second clamping element is mounted to the housing. The second clamping element is associated with the second recess and is movable relative thereto between a support-clamping position wherein the jaw captures the support in the second recess and a release position wherein the support is movable into and out of the second recess.<br>

In the embodiment shown, circular section 424a of cam surface 424 extends radially about shaft 412 for over 180<br><br><br>
angular degrees. Cam surface 424 also includes transition sections 424b. Transition sections 424b are formed at opposite ends of circular section 424a and converge toward a valley section 424c.<br>
A second flanged sleeve 432, best seen in FIG. 13, is disposed at the other end of shaft 412. An end-cap 442 is mounted to the flange portion of second flanged sleeve 432 by fasteners 434 extending through second flanged sleeve 432 into cap 442. An intermediate plate 452 is captured between cap 442 and the flanged portion of second flanged sleeve 432. Intermediate plate 452 includes a circular disc portion 452a and a cylindrical wall portion 452b extending to one side of disc portion 452a. In the embodiment shown, intermediate plate 452 is disposed such that cylindrical wall portion 452b extends toward actuator 422. Cylindrical wall portion 452b is symmetrical about the axis of shaft 412. Opposing slots 456 are formed in cylindrical wall 452b, as best seen in FIG. 13. A pair of spaced-apart tabs 462 extends from the surface of intermediate plate 452 toward actuator 422. Tabs 462 are symmetrically spaced on opposite sides of the axis of shaft 412 and are disposed within cylindrical wall 452b, i.e., between cylindrical wall 452b and the axis of shaft 412. A handlebar 472 is attached to and traverses the end face of end-cap 442. Handlebar 472 is dimensioned to extend beyond end-cap 442. Grips are mounted at the distal ends of handle bar 472. In the embodiment shown, grip 474 is spherical in shape and grip 476 has the shape of a cylindrical disc.<br>
Handle/actuator assembly 410 is dimensioned to be captured between inner plates 314, 316. An elongated, cylindrical groove 372, best seen in FIG. 17, is formed in contoured surface 314b, 316b of inner plates 314, 316 such that, when inner plates 314, 316 are assembled together, a cylindrical passage, that is dimensioned to receive shaft 412, is formed. Handle/actuator assembly 410 and inner plates 314, 316 are dimensioned such that, when shaft 412 is captured within cylindrical groove 372 in inner plates 314, 316, actuator 422 is positioned and extends through rectangular slot 352 in inner plates 314, 316.<br>
As best seen in FIGS. 4-8, when handle/actuator assembly 410 is captured between inner plates 314, 316, cylindrical wall portion 452b of intermediate plate 452 is disposed within slots 362 that define outer circular passage 362P in the<br><br><br>
end faces of inner plates 314, 316, and tabs 462 are positioned to be movable within (through) circular passage 364P defined by slots 364 in the end faces of inner plates 314,316.<br>
Inner plates 314, 316 are also designed to capture jaw/latch assemblies 510A, 51 OB therebetween. Jaw/latch assemblies 510A, 51 OB are essentially identical, and, therefore, only jaw/latch assembly 51 OB shall be described in detail, it being understood that such description applies equally to jaw/latch assembly 510A. In the description of jaw/latch assembly 51 OB, components shall be described by a reference number and the suffix "B." In the drawings, like components of jaw/latch assembly 510A bear the same reference number with the suffix "A."<br>
Referring now to FIG. 14, jaw/latch assembly 51 OB is best seen. Jaw/latch assembly 51 OB is comprised of a jaw element 512B and a latch element 552B. A jaw face 514B is formed along one edge of jaw element 512B. A cam follower 516B is mounted to the other end of jaw element 512B. In the embodiment shown, cam follower 516B is a roller that is mounted within a notch 522B in the end of jaw element 512B. Roller 516B is mounted to a pin 524B, best seen in FIGS. 4-8, extending into jaw element 512B through notch 522B. A cylindrical bore 532B extends through jaw element 512B and communicates with jaw face 514B. Bore 532B includes internal threads to receive an adjusting screw 534B. In the embodiment shown, jaw element 512B is formed from a relatively thick plate material, wherein jaw element 512B has planar upper and lower surfaces. A thin slot 542B is formed within one edge of the jaw element 512B. Slot 542B is co-planar with, and disposed between, the planar surfaces of jaw element 512B.<br>
Latch element 552B is an elongated structure, having a first end 554B and a second end 556B. First end 554B is dimensioned to be received within slot 542B of jaw element 512B, as illustrated in FIG. 14. First end 554B of latch element 552B is pivotally connected to jaw element 512B by a pivot pin 562B that extends through jaw element 512B perpendicular to the upper and lower surfaces of jaw element 512B. As illustrated in FIG. 14, pivot pin 562B has a length greater than the thickness of jaw element 512B, such that portions of pivot pin 562B extend beyond<br><br><br>
the upper surface of jaw element 512B and beyond the lower surface of jaw element 512B.<br>
Second end 556B of latch element 552B is generally L-shaped and defines a finger 566B that extends to one side of latch element 552B. Between first and second ends 554B, 556B of latch element 552B, a contoured surface 572B is formed. Contoured surface 572B has a curved, circular shape dimensioned to engage a support 150 or 250, as shall be described in greater detail below. Between contoured surface 572B and second end 556B of latch element 552B, tab 574B extends to one side of latch element 552B. A notch is formed on the other edge of latch element 552B to form a projection 576B, best seen in FIG. 14.<br>
Jaw/latch assembly 51 OB is designed to be disposed between inner plates 314, 316 of body section 310. The extending portions of pivot pin 562B are received within bored openings in inner plates 314, 316, as best seen in FIG. 17. Inner plates 314, 316 are formed to have recesses to receive jaw element 512B and to allow jaw element 512B to move about the axis of pivot pin 562B within the cavity defined between inner plates 314, 316 by the recesses therein.<br>
A jaw-biasing element 582B is attached to jaw element 512B to bias jaw element 512B toward a "non-clamping position," as shall be described in greater detail below. In the embodiment shown, jaw-biasing element 582B is a tension spring that is attached at one end to one edge of jaw element 512B, as best seen in FIGS. 4-8. The other end of biasing element 582B is attached to a pin 584B extending between inner plates 314, 316. In the embodiment shown, jaw-biasing element 582B biases cam roller 516B on jaw element 512B toward shaft 412 of handle/actuator assembly 410, as will be discussed in greater detail below. A latch-biasing element 592B is attached to latch element 552B. One end of latch-biasing element 592B is mounted to projection 576B on latch element 552B, and a second end of latch-biasing element 592B is mounted to a pin 594B that extends between inner plates 314, 316, as best seen in FIGS. 4-8. Latch-biasing element 592B is dimensioned to bias latch element 552B in a direction away from shaft 412 of handle/actuator assembly 410. Latch-biasing element 592B and pin 594B are disposed within a slot or groove 382 formed in the inner surface of inner plates 314, 316, as best seen in FIGS. 4-8.   Each slot or<br><br><br>
groove 382 communicates with a central cavity 384 and defines a shoulder surface 386. A compression spring 598B is disposed on the opposite side of latch element 552B, in general alignment with latch-biasing element 592B. In this respect, compression spring 598B is basically axially aligned with latch-biasing element 592B.<br>
As indicated above, handle/actuator assembly 410 and jaw/latch assemblies 510A, 510B are dimensioned to be captured between inner plates 314, 316 within the cavities formed along inner surfaces 314a, 316a thereof. As best seen in FIG. 4, shaft 412 of handle/actuator assembly 410 defines a central axis "X" that extends through body section 310 of transfer device 300. Jaw/latch assembly 510A is disposed to one side of handle/actuator assembly 410, and jaw/latch assembly 51 OB is disposed on the opposite side of handle/actuator assembly 410. In this respect, respective jaw/latch assemblies 510A, 510B are symmetrical with respect to axis "X" of the shaft 412 of handle/actuator assembly 410. Jaw/latch assemblies, 510A, 510B are respectively movable about pivot pins 562A, 562B. Jaw elements 512A, 512B are dimensioned such that rollers 516A, 516B operatively engage cam surface 424 of actuator 422, as shown in FIGS. 9-12.<br>
As best seen in FIG. 4, cam surface 424 of actuator 422 is rounded, so as to allow rollers 516A, 516B to roll there along, as jaw elements 512A, 512B pivot about pivot pins 562A, 562B. Jaw-biasing elements 582A, 582B, i.e., the tension springs, are operatively disposed so as to bias rollers 516A, 516B on jaw elements 512A, 512B, respectively, toward cam actuator 422. In other words, jaw-biasing elements 582A, 582B bias rollers 516A, 516B on jaw elements 512A, 512B into engagement with cam surface 424 of actuator 422. With reference to FIG. 4, jaw-biasing element 582A, i.e., attached to jaw/latch assembly 510A, biases jaw element 512A in a clockwise direction, and jaw-biasing element 582B, attached to jaw/latch assembly 510B, biases the associated jaw element 512B in a counter-clockwise direction.<br>
As illustrated in FIGS. 4-8, latch elements 552A, 552B of jaw/latch assemblies 510A, 510B are biased by latch-biasing elements 592A, 592B in an outward direction, i.e., away from shaft 412 of handle/actuator assembly 410. When in an outermost position, latch element 552A extends into support-receiving recess<br><br><br>
320A and latch element 552B extends into support-receiving recess 320B of housing body 310, wherein contoured-surfaces 572A, 572B extend into a respective support-receiving opening 320A, 320B. As illustrated in FIG. 4, when latch element 552B of jaw/latch assembly 51 OB is in this position, compression spring 598B does not engage latch element 552B.<br>
As will be described in greater detail below, a latch element 552A, 552B can assume its outermost position (shown in FIG. 4 with respect to latch element 552B) only when handlebar 472 of handle/actuator assembly 410 is in a generally horizontal position, as illustrated in FIG. 3. In this position, handlebar 472 of handle/actuator assembly 410 is aligned along the parting plane defined by inner plates 314, 316. In this respect, intermediate plate 452 of handle/actuator assembly 410 is positioned wherein slots 456 in the cylindrical wall portion 452b of intermediate plate 452 align with the plane through which latch elements 552A, 552B move. As a result, fingers 566A, 566B at second ends 556A, 556B of latch elements 552A, 552B can move through slots 456 in cylindrical wall portion 452b of intermediate plate 452. FIG. 4 shows finger 566B of latch element 552B of jaw/latch assembly 51 OB disposed within slot 456 in cylindrical wall portion 452b of handle/actuator assembly 410. In this position, latch element 552B is in its outermost position away from axis "X" of handle/actuator assembly 410. The force exerted by latch-biasing elements 592A, 592B cause the outer edges of latch elements 5 52A, 552B to abut shoulder 3 86 defined in inner plates 314, 316, as shown in FIG. 4.<br>
The range of motion of latch elements 552A, 552B is illustrated in FIG. 4, wherein latch element 552A of jaw/latch assembly 510A is shown in its innermost position and wherein latch element 552B of jaw/latch assembly 510B is shown in its outermost position. As shall be discussed in greater detail below, a latch element 552A or 552B is in its innermost position when a support 150 or 250 is clamped against it, and a latch element 552A or 552B is in its outermost position when latch element 552A or 552B abuts shoulder 386 in inner plates 314,316.<br>
Upper and lower housing 312, 318 and intermediate plates 314, 316 are dimensioned to be secured together, with handle/actuator assembly 410 and jaw/latch<br><br><br>
assemblies 510A, 51 OB disposed therebetween. As best illustrated in FIGS. 4-8 and 17, elongated fasteners 398 extend into lower housing 318, through intermediate plates 314, 316, and into upper housing 312 to secure the respective components together. The relative positions of fasteners 398 are shown in FIGS. 4-8.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 3 and 17, adapter section 610 is best seen. Adapter section 610 is attachable to body section 310 and is designed to support medical apparatus 20. In the embodiment shown, adapter section 610 includes an enlarged first end 612 having a flat end surface 612a. Enlarged end 612 is dimensioned to mate with the flat end of body section 310 and to be attached thereto by conventional fastener 614 extending through holes 616 in end 612 into body section 310.<br>
Adapter 610 includes a beam-like, central body portion 622 that connects first end 612 to a second end 632 that is adapted to hold and support medical apparatus 20. In the embodiment shown, second end 632 of adapter section 610 is a tubular sleeve that is dimensioned to receive post 34 on support frame 22. A locking device, such as a set screw (not shown), can be provided in second end 632 to secure post 34 therein. As will be appreciated from a further reading of the specification, second end 632 of adapter section 610 may assume other configurations for holding medical apparatus 20.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 4-12, the present invention shall be further described with respect to the operation of transfer system 10 and transfer device 300. Transfer device 300 is designed to attach onto a support, such as supports 150, 250, and to be transferable from one support 150, 250 to another support 150, 250. Hereinafter, the support 150, 250 that is to receive transfer device 300 shall be referred to as "receiving-support," and the support that is to transfer and release transfer device 300 shall be referred to as "transferring-support."<br>
As will be appreciated from a reading of the following, the transferring-support 150, 250 may be on a stationary support assembly 100 or a vehicle support assembly 200, and the receiving support 150, 250 may be on a stationary support assembly 100 or a vehicle support assembly 200. In other words, transfer device 300 may be moved between a stationary support assembly 100 and a vehicle support<br><br><br>
assembly 200 and vice-a-versa, or between two stationary support assemblies 100 or two vehicle support assemblies 200.<br>
As shall be described in greater detail below, transfer device 300 includes certain safety features that permit the transfer of transfer device 300 from one support 150, 250 to another support 150, 250 only when a receiving-support 150, 250 is of a proper size. Further, transfer of transfer device 300 from a transferring-support 150, 250 to a receiving-support 150, 250 will occur only when transfer device 300 is securely affixed, i.e., clamped, to the receiving-support 150, 250. Only then, will transfer device 300 release from, i.e., detach from, the releasing-support 150,250.<br>
Still further, rotation of handle/actuator assembly 410 to initiate transfer of transfer device 300 from a transferring-support 150, 250 to a receiving-support 150, 250 is permitted only when the receiving-support 150, 250 is disposed within a receiving opening 320A, 320B of transfer device 300. Only then is rotation of handle/actuator assembly 410 possible.<br>
The operation of transfer device 300 shall now be described with respect to the transfer of transfer device 300 from a transferring-support 150 of a stationary support assembly 100 to a receiving-support 250 of a vehicle-support assembly 200. As will be appreciated, since supports 150, 250 are both comprised of like-diameter, metallic tubes, the positions of the respective supports 150, 250 could be reversed without affecting the operation of transfer device 300 or the following description of the operation thereof.<br>
FIG. 4 shows transferring-support 150 clamped into receiving recess 320A of transfer device 300 by jaw element 512A. In FIG. 4, jaw element 512A is in a "clamped position" and jaw element 512B of jaw/latch assembly 510B is in a "non-clamping position." FIG. 9 shows the position of actuator 422, as viewed when looking along axis "X" of actuator shaft 412. As illustrated in FIG. 4, the transferring-support 150 is within support-receiving recess 320A of transfer device 300 and is held in position against the inner surface of the support-receiving recess 320A by jaw element 512B. FIG. 9 shows the position of actuator 422, when jaw element 512A of jaw/latch assembly 510A is in the "clamping position," as seen in FIG. 4. As seen in FIG. 9, roller 516A on jaw element 512A is forced outward, away from shaft 412. As<br><br><br>
a result, jaw face 514A of jaw element 512A is forced against transferring-support 150, thereby forcing transferring-support 150 against U-shaped guides 332 and pads 344 in support-receiving recess 320A. In other words, jaw element 512A of jaw/latch assembly 510A forces transferring-support 150 against guides 332 and U-shaped pads 344 mounted within upper and lower housing 312,318.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 4, clamping of transferring-support 150 forces latch element 552A of jaw/latch assembly 510A against compression spring 598A to a position where end 556A of latch element 552A does not obstruct circular passages 362P, 364P formed in the end faces of inner plates 314, 316. As also shown in FIG. 4, latch element 552B of jaw/latch assembly 510B is in a position wherein end 556B of latch element 522B is disposed within slot 456 in cylindrical wall portion 452b of intermediate plate 452. In this position, latch element 552B prevents rotation of handle/actuator assembly 410, thereby preventing jaw element 512A of jaw/latch assembly 510 from moving and releasing transferring-support 150.<br>
To transport transfer device 300 from support 150 to support 250 requires that support 250 be positioned within support-receiving recess 320B. Because support 150 is rotatable about its own axis, as illustrated in FIG. 1, support-receiving recess 320B may be repositioned by rotating transfer device 300 about the axis of support 150, thereby repositioning support-receiving recess 320B relative to support 250.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates the relative position of the internal components of transfer device 300 when receiving-support 250 is positioned in support-receiving recess 320B of transfer device 300. In this respect, transfer device 300 and receiving-support 250 are moved relative to each other to position receiving-support 250 within support-receiving recess 320B of transfer device 300. A slightly misaligned receiving-support 150, 250 can be inserted into support-receiving recess 320B, as guides 332 at the upper and lower ends of support-receiving recess 320B help align receiving-support 150, 250 relative to support-receiving recess 320B. As illustrated in FIG. 5, as receiving-support 250 enters the support-receiving recess 320B, it causes latch element 552B to move toward actuator shaft 412. In other words, positioning of receiving-support 250 within support-receiving recess 320B provides sufficient force<br><br><br>
to overcome the biasing force exerted by latch-biasing element 592B on latch element 552B. As a result, latch element 552B will move toward shaft 412 of handle/actuator assembly 410 until the inner edge of latch element 552B contacts the compression spring 598B. Compression spring 598B is dimensioned to require a significant amount of force to compress compression spring 598B. In other words, the opposing force of compression spring 598B will not be overcome by mere contact or engagement between receiving-support 250 and latch element 552B. As illustrated in FIG. 5, latch element 552B has moved sufficiently to cause end 556B of latch element 552B to move out from slot 456 in cylindrical wall portion 452b of intermediate plate 452. Removal of end 556B of latch element 552B from slot 456 in cylindrical wall portion 452b allows rotation of handle/actuator assembly 410 about axis "X."<br>
With receiving-support 250 within support-receiving recess 320B, and with latch element 552B moved out of slot 456 in intermediate plate 452, rotation of handle/actuator assembly 410 is allowed. FIG. 6 illustrates the position of the internal components of transfer device 300 during rotation of handle/actuator assembly 410 from the initial position shown in FIG. 4. Rotation of handle/actuator assembly 410 in a clockwise direction causes actuator 422 to move to a position as illustrated in FIG. 10. Rotation of actuator 422 causes jaw element 512B to pivot clockwise about pivot pin 562B, as roller 516B associated therewith rolls up along transition section 424b of cam surface 424. Jaw element 512A remains in a locked position as roller 516A associated therewith continues to roll along circular section 424a of cam surface 424. As illustrated in FIG. 6, latch element 552B remains essentially in the same position, with its inner edge against compression spring 598B.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 7 and 11, as handle/actuator assembly 410 continues to rotate in a clockwise direction, actuator 422 will reach a position as shown in FIG. 11. In this position, both rollers 516A, 516B ride, i.e., are disposed on circular section 424a of cam surface 424 of actuator 422. As illustrated in FIG. 7, jaw element 512B now engages receiving-support 250 and forces receiving-support 250 against the contoured surface 572B of latch element 552B. Through the mechanical advantage gained by the arrangement of cam surface 424 and roller 516B, jaw element 512B forces receiving-support 250 against latch element 552B with sufficient force to<br><br><br>
compress compression spring 598B. In other words, the mechanical advantage gained by the arrangement of cam surface 424 and roller 516B, in addition to the mechanical advantage determined by the geometry of jaw 512B, the location of pivot pin 562B, and the location of roller 516B, provides sufficient force to cause receiving-support 250 to force latch element 552B against compression spring 598B and overcome the compressive force thereof. As illustrated in FIG. 7, in this position, end 556B of latch element 552B has moved to its innermost position. In this position, end 556B of latch element 552B no longer obstructs inner circular passage 364P formed on the end faces of inner plates 314, 316. As a result, handle/actuator assembly 410 is allowed to rotate further and tabs 462 that extend from the inner surface of intermediate plate 452 are allowed to pass through inner circular passage 364P formed along the end faces of inner plates 314, 316.<br>
Each latch element 552A, 552B basically defines a locking element that controls movement, i.e., rotation of handlebar 472, and, in turn, controls movement of actuator 422. In the embodiment shown, each latch element 552A, 552B defines a locking element having three positions. Using latch element 552B as an example, in a first position, shown in FIG. 4, latch element 552B acts as a locking element to prevent movement of handlebar 472 and actuator 422.<br>
In a second position, shown in FIG. 6, latch element 552B acts as a locking element and allows limited movement of handlebar 472 and actuator 422. In the second position, latch element 552B allows sufficient movement of actuator 422 to move both jaw elements 512A, 512B to a clamping position, but prevents further movement that would complete the transfer of transfer device 300 from transferring-support 150 to receiving-support 250.<br>
In a third position, shown in FIG. 7, latch element 552B is in a position allowing complete rotation of handlebar 472 and movement of actuator 422 to allow actuator 422 to move from a first actuator position (shown in FIG. 9) to a second actuator position (shown in FIG. 12). When actuator 422 is in its first actuator position, transfer device 300 is attached to a first support, i.e., transferring-support 150. When actuator 422 is in its second actuator position, transfer device 300 is attached to a second support, i.e., receiving-support 250.  In the embodiment shown,<br><br><br>
when handlebar 472 moves 180 angular degrees, actuator 422 moves from a first actuator position to a second actuator position. Depending upon the position of handlebar 472 and actuator 422, transfer device 300 is attached to one support 150 or 250, and the other support is released. Transfer device 300 preferably includes position detents (not shown) to identify when handlebar 472 is in the positions shown in FIGS. 4 and 8.<br>
With jaw element 512B forcing receiving-support 250 against latch element 552B, latch element 552B will move sufficiently to allow further rotation of handle/actuator assembly 410. FIGS. 8 and 12 show the relative position of handle/actuator assembly 410 and actuator 422 upon completion of a 180° rotation of handlebar 472. As illustrated in FIG. 12, roller 516B associated with jaw element 512B is disposed along circular section 424a of cam surface 424, thereby maintaining jaw element 512B in a clamped position against receiving-support 250. As also shown in Fig. 12, roller 516A associated with jaw element 512A has moved into position within valley section 424c of cam surface 424. In this position, jaw-biasing element 582A connected to jaw element 512A rotates jaw element 512A in a clockwise direction about pivot pin 562A, thereby releasing transferring-support 150. Latch element 552A associated with jaw/latch assembly 510A has moved to its outermost position, away from the central axis of shaft 412. In this position, end 556A of latch element 552A is disposed within slot 456 in cylindrical wall portion 452b of intermediate plate 452, thereby preventing further rotation of handle/actuator assembly 410. Thus, receiving-support 250 is firmly clamped within the transfer device 300. Transfer device 300 and any associated medical apparatus 20 mounted thereto are now fixed to receiving-support 250 and supported thereby. As indicated by the foregoing, a transfer of transfer device 300 from a transfer-support 150, 250 to a receiving-support 150, 250 cannot occur until transfer device 300 is fixedly attached, i.e., clamped onto, the receiving-support 150, 250.<br>
Transfer device 300 is designed so as not to be rotationally movable relative to support 250. However, as indicated above, support 250 is rotatable about its vertical axis relative to bracket 232 and bed 212. Accordingly, transfer device 300 and support 250 may be rotated about the axis of support 250, to move transfer device<br><br><br>
300 and the medical apparatus 20 mounted thereto to various positions about the corner of bed 212. In other words, medical apparatus 20 is generally movable along a circular path having the axis of support 250 as a center point. In a similar fashion, when transfer device 300 is mounted to support 150, apparatus 20 that is mounted on transfer device 300, is movable along a circular path about the axis of support 150.<br>
The configuration of transfer device 300 provides a safety mechanism in the event that an attempt is made to attach transfer device 300 to an improperly-sized support. In this respect, if the support to receive transfer device 300 is too small, clamping of the smaller support will not move latch element 552A or 552B sufficiently to cause ends 556A or 556B of latch element 552A or 552B to clear inner passage 364P formed in the end faces of inner plates 314, 316. As a result, tabs 462 on intermediate plate 452 will not be allowed to rotate through inner circular passage 364P, thus preventing further rotation of handle/actuator assembly 410. With further rotation prevented, actuator 422 remains in position as shown in FIG. 11, where both jaw element 512A and jaw element 512B are in a clamped position.<br>
If an attempt is made to attach transfer device 300 to an oversized support, transfer of transfer device 300 to such a support will, likewise, be prevented. In this respect, an oversized support, i.e., a support having a larger diameter, will not be received by guides 332 that are located at the upper and lower ends of the support-receiving recesses 320A, 320B. FIG. 16B illustrates an oversized support, designated 750, disposed with support-receiving recess 320A. As shown in the drawings, guides 332 have spaced-apart arms 332a, 332b that define a predetermined width for elongated recess 320A. The spacing between arms 332a, 332b of guides 332 limits the size of a support that can be inserted therein. Only a support of the proper diameter (or smaller) will be received in the support-receiving recesses 320A, 320B, as illustrated in FIG. 16A. Larger-diameter supports are prevented by guides 332 from entering support-receiving recesses 320A, 320B. As a result, the necessary movement of latch element 5 52A is prevented, and handlebar 472 cannot be moved from its initial position, as illustrated in FIG. 4.<br>
The foregoing structure thus prevents an improperly-sized support from being used in transfer device 300.    As will be appreciated, an improperly-sized<br><br><br>
support, i.e., one of smaller diameter, would reduce the clamping force of jaw element 512A or 512B against a support disposed within the support-receiving recesses 320A or 320B.<br>
Transfer device 300 thus provides for transfer of medical apparatus 20 from transferring-support 150 to receiving-support 250, and vice-a-versa. As will be noted, vertical repositioning of transfer device 300 is not required to move transfer device 300 from one support to another. In this respect, transfer device 300 is movable in a generally horizontal direction, maintaining the same vertical position, i.e., height, when transferred from one support to another. In addition, as will be noted, in the embodiment shown, transfer device 300 is attachable anywhere along the lengths of supports 150, 250. Thus, vertical repositioning of supports 150, 250 is likewise not required. As indicated above, support 150, 250 may be part of a stationary support assembly 100 or a vehicle-support assembly 200.<br>
The present invention thus provides a transfer device 300 for the horizontal transfer of medical apparatus 20 from one support 150, 250 to another support 150, 250. Transfer device 300 includes safety features that prevent accidental release of transfer device 300 from a support 150, 250 and further prevent an undersized or oversized support from being inserted into transfer device 300.<br>
The foregoing description is a specific embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated that this embodiment is described for purposes of illustration only, and that numerous alterations and modifications may be practiced by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. While system 100 and transfer device 300 have been described with respect to a medical environment, the present invention is not limited to such application. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations be included insofar as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or the equivalents thereof.<br><br><br>
