				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a method and an apparatus for dispensing liquids. More particularly, but not exclusively, the invention relates to a cold plate premix pouring junction for use especially in high humidity and high temperature conditions to dispense beverages, for example, carbonated beverages such as soft drink which usually contain water, syrup and carbon dioxide.<br>
In developing economies of the world particularly in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal etc. and in the African continent where good quality product at an affordable price can not be reached to the remotest parts because of high costs and incidentals on conventional fountain dispensers, it has been felt that an equipment which is affordable, portable and convenient be devised.<br>
In the field of dispensing beverages, two methods are commonly known. The most popular method worldwide has been the post-mix method. In this method, syrup of the beverage is supplied to the retailer. The syrup is stored in a container and mixed with water and carbon dioxide just prior to dispensing. This is also commonly known as "fountain dispensation". The other method of dispensing beverages is the premix method wherein the premixed composition of the syrup, water and carbon dioxide is supplied to the retailer for dispensing.<br>
The problem underlying the post-mix dispensing is that the taste of the final product is not uniform. Since the specifications of water such as TDS (total dissolved solids), hardness and alkalinty vary depending on the dispensing location, the flavour of the final product in different<br><br>
dispensing locations also varies. It is known that beverages tend to become unstable at temperature above 20°C.<br>
A typical premix dispenser comprises a cabinet in which the beverage is supplied from cannisters located outside the container. The pressurized beverage is passed into the cold plate and is collected at the outlet as a chilled drink. The draw back in this system is that the beverage in the cannisters is at ambient temperature and therefore the quality of the final product is not uniform. In addition, the ready beverage is supplied to the retailer in 18 litres stainless steel cannisters which are cumbersome to handle and not easily portable. Moreover, the apparatus is not convenient for high humidity and/or high temperature locations particularly where there is frequent load shedding, power breakdown and variations in temperature and humidity conditions (i.e. the temperature in the morning, afternoon, evening and night varies as does the relative humidity in 24 hours) which may result in high operating costs. Additionally, the system requires a fixed dispensing unit. Therefore, the appropriate market cannot be targeted.<br>
While the manufacturers of beverages from time to time have devised and carried out modifications to the conventional fountain dispensers, the most important aspect of targeting the remotest markets in developing countries with different kind of dispensers has been neglected. This is because equipments for such areas were expensive and deterents such as unexpected power failure kept dissuading them.<br>
In yet another well known pre-mix dispenser, the primary packages are chilled outside. These chilled packages are then fitted straight into an insulated jacket and connected to a refillable CO2 cylinder for dispensing the beverage. This system works only when the primary packages are at a temperature close to 2°C for 24 hours. The system does not utilize cold<br><br>
plate. The other drawback is that the beverage must be dispensed within about 28 minutes of loading the package.<br>
The present invention addresses itself to the problems envisaged above and provides a novel method and apparatus for dispensing beverages.<br>
The present invention seeks to work around the premix concept using ice, dry or wet, to do the chilling.<br>
The apparatus of the present invention comprises a combination of cold plate technology with wet ice chilling to ensure that beverage of a uniform and consistent flavour and quality can be dispensed at any location.<br>
A further object of the present invention lies in the provision with such an novel apparatus a means for intentional carting of said junction from one place to another. This is necessary especially where soft drinks have to be served chilled such as in a party hosted in a lawn or a park and where the soft drink has to be carted just like the ice cream vending carts.<br>
The pouring junction according to this invention can be used to dispense non-carbonated beverages as well. However, while dispensing non-carbonated beverages nitrogen or sterile air may be employed. Non-carbonated beverages such as juices, iced tea, etc., need not be pre-chilled in an ice box. But, if done, the shelf life of the beverage may be increased.<br>
With the above mentioned objects in view, the present invention provides an equipment which is designed in a manner so as to be cost effective as compared to the existing imported dispensers. This equipment has low<br><br>
operating costs as compared to the conventional premix dispensers. It is compatible with polyethylene or glass bottles having a capacity of one or more litres and it can be operated any where.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides an apparatus for dispensing liquids comprising a container and a lid therefor, one or more primary packages located in a cold environment within said container and filled with said liquid, each said primary package being provided with a closure means and connected with the adjacent packages through non-return (one way) valves, a means for supplying gas under pressure and connected to the proximal primary package through a flow control valve to enable flow of liquid from said proximal primary package to the distal primary package, said distal primary package being connected to a heat exchanger means to impart further cooling or chilling of the liquid passing there through and a means for delivering the liquid coming out of said heat exchanger means to a secondary package.<br>
The invention also provides a method of preserving or preventing a liquid from deterioration and dispensing the same comprising precooling one or more primary packages filled with said liquid, locating said packages inside a thermally insulated container maintained at a cold environment, connecting each said package with the adjacent package through nonreturn (one way) valves, supplying a gas under controlled pressure to said packages so as to force the liquid in the packages to flow out into a heat exchanger means so as to impart further cooling or chilling to the liquid and regulating the liquid coming out of said heat exchanger means and collecting the same in a secondary package.<br>
The beverage can be cooled by dry or wet ice used inside the container to chill the beverage prior to dispensing. Due to the presence of polyurethane foam insulation inside the double wall of said cabinet and<br><br>
the lid the adverse impact of outside high temperature to the beverage is effectively prevented. Polyurethane foam used in the apparatus has the ability to provide high degree of insulation to the interior from the harsh outside environment. Other materials that can be employed for insulation purpose are thermocole and glasswool.<br>
The entire, pouring junction of the present invention can be made of synthetic plastics material, or of metal or a combination of both. Thus the container and the lid, may be formed of a metal or a metal alloy such as aluminium or steel or one or both of them may also be formed of rigid synthetic thermoplastics. The closure can comprise connector valve assembly, coupling, clamp, plug fitting, nose, clamp, clip retainer, washer, connector/valve body, L-ring, stem and J-tube and can be made of synthetic material or may just as conventionally be composed of plastics, rubber and stainless steel. However, every component of the closure should be able to withstand a pressure of about 120 psi and a temperature of around -5 to 55°C.<br><br>
The present invention relates to:<br>
An apparatus for dispensing liquids comprising a container and a lid therefore, one or more primary packages located in a cold environment within said container and filled with said liquid, each said primary package being provided with a closure means and connected with the adjacent packages through non-return (one way valves), a means for supplying gas under pressure and connected to the proximal primary package through a flow control valve and to enable flow of liquid from said proximal primary package to the distal primary package, said distal primary package being connected to a heat exchanger means to impart further cooling or chilling to the liquid passing therethrough and a means for delivering the liquid coming out of said heat exchanger means to a secondary package.<br>
It also relates to a method of preserving or preventing a liquid from deterioration and dispensing the same comprising pre-cooling one or more primary packages filled with said liquid, locating said packages inside a thermally insulated container maintained at a cold environment, connecting each said package with the adjacent package through nonreturn (one way) valves, supplying a gas under controlled pressure to said packages so as to force the liquid in the packages to flow out into a heat exchanger means so as to impart further cooling or chilling to the liquid and regulating the liquid coming out of said heat exchanger means and collecting the same in a secondary package.<br><br>
The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein :<br>
Figure 1 is a simplified longitudinal sectional view of the apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention; and<br>
Figure 2 shows the closure kit assembly marked A in Figure 1 on a larger scale.<br>
In figure 1 of the drawings, the apparatus for dispensing liquids is shown. It comprises a container or a cabinet (19) having a double walled body. The external wall can be made of electro galvanized cold rolled steel. It can also be made of plastic or stainless steel. The internal wall on the other hand can be made of stainless steel of comparable<br><br>
thickness. The thickness of both steels employed can be 22 SWG (standard wire gauge). As the internal wall is in constant contact with water /ice, stainless steel can be used in its construction to prevent oxidation. Several other materials can be advantageously employed for making the internal wall. One of such materials can be plastics. A lid (14) made preferably of electro-galvanized cold rolled steel is provided for covering the cabinet (19). The lid is mounted on the top of the cabinet to ensure that thermal equilibrium inside the cabinet is maintained. The lid can be a double walled structure having thickness of preferably 22 SWG.<br>
A cylinder (1) for supplying gases such as food grade gases selected from carbon dioxide, nitrogen or sterile air is provided outside the cabinet. These gases can also be non-reactive gases and can be supplied by means of a compressor or in a cylinder. When carbonated beverage has to be dispensed, carbon dioxide is used in the cylinder 1. This gas is employed for the retention of carbonation in the beverage. By the same token, a non-reactive gas such as sterile air or compressed air is chosen on the basis of application. For instance, alcohol can be chilled by the apparatus by passing sterile air through it. However, as nitrogen is a pyrogen free gas and obtaining sterile air is difficult, nitrogen can also be used for the purpose. The cylinder is connected to a hose (3) via a carbon dioxide valve (2). The hose is connected to a carbon dioxide gas regulator (4) which in turn is connected through a hose (5) to a closure (7) located inside the cabinet. A non-return valve (6) is provided between the hose and the closure. Similarly, the other two primary packages (8) are also provided with such valves so that the reverse travel of the liquid and gas in the system is prevented.<br>
The closure (7) comprises a cap member having an inlet for enabling pressurization of the primary package and an outlet for enabling the pressurized liquid to flow out via a J-tube to the adjacent package. A<br><br>
gasket (22) which can be made of silicon or rubber is located inside the cap member. This gasket (22) has an L-shaped profile which enables proper sealing of a PET or a glass bottle with the closure. Vents are provided in the closure body at a suitable location to enable pressure inside the primary package to be released slowly while the bottle is being replaced for a refill. They also prevent sudden ejection of the bottle.<br>
Figure 2 shows the closure kit A in detail. A gasket (22) is located in the inner face of the top (21) of the closure . The gasket has an L-shaped profile so as to enable a polyethylene terephthalate or even a glass bottle to be connected as primary packages. The stem (23) is made of polyproplene and its diameter being such, it is possible to accommodate both the PET and the glass bottle. As shown in figure 1, the closure (7) is seated firmly on the primary package to enable pressure tight operation of the apparatus.<br>
The system is designed and insulated as per condition 'D'. Condition 'D' means the climate created at 41°C and 75% relative humidity. Ice is widely available and is an immediate solution for chilling. By using ice in the system, excessive cost of refrigeration which makes the dispensers inordinately expensive, is reduced.<br>
The primary package (8) can be a 1 litre glass or a PET bottle which is in chilling condition prior to its employment for enabling the liquid to flow out of the package. A J-tube (9) passes through the outlet opening of the closure (7). The J-tube can be provided with a 'V cut at its distal end so as to prevent the system from choking. The primary packages are kept in an ice-box so as to maintain them in a chilling condition before being used in the apparatus of the present invention. The packages can be kepi inside an ice box for varying periods depending on the ambient temperature. Generally, the package is kept inside an ice box for chilling<br><br>
for 2 hours when the ambient temperature is 30°C. It is kept for 3 or 4 hours when the ambient temperature is 35°C or 40°C, respectively.<br>
About 5 to 6 kilograms of ice (17) is loaded inside the cabinet (19) for further chilling and to prevent destabilization of the beverage. Depending on the requirement, appropriate number of pre-chilled bottles are unloaded from the ice box (not shown). The bottles are uncapped and connected to the closure kit inside the cabinet (19) by bringing together the male and the female ends. Gas line is connected to the first primary package (8) through the closure kit. The gas cylinder (1) is connected to the regulator (4) which may be opened with care to introduce the necessary amount of gas into the first primary package for sufficiently pressurizing its contents. At ambient temperature the beverage is unstable. It is, therefore, subjected to chilling. To achieve perfect chilling and to provide a drink with an accurate taste, pressurization is carried out from the gas cylinder into the beverage inside the bottles. This also helps in maintaining the stability of the liquid dispensed. On opening the valve the chilled product can be collected in a secondary package such as a cup or a bottle or the like.<br>
The closure kit can receive and connect up to 4 to 6 bottles. These bottles can be connected in series. The outlet of the last bottle expels the beverage under pressure so as to enable it to enter the inlet (11) of cold plate. The kit is provided with stainless steel fittings and food grade transparent connecting pipe lines. The cold plate comprises about 7 meters of stainless steel pipe line which is casted inside in thick aluminium alloy which can be as thick as upto 2".<br>
At the outer end (12) of the cold plate (10) is provided a high pressure valve (13) for dispensing the beverage. This valve is provided with a flow regulator screw with the help of which one can set the rate of dispensing<br><br>
the beverage. This screw also helps in preventing the foaming of the drink. In order to reduce the inside high pressure to low pressure at the time of dispensation of the liquid, this valve plays a significant role. This enables the beverage to flow in a linear manner into the secondary package.<br>
In order to ensure that ambient air does not enter the interior of the cabinet (19) and to maintain the thermal equilibrium, a gasket (15) is provided. This gasket can be a multiwing gasket made up of a polymer such as PVC. It can also be an LDPE, rubber or neoprene. It is located between the lid (14) and the cabinet (19) to check entry of any air into the interior and to provide cushion effect at the time of closing the lid. Being multiwinged in nature, the gasket is able to accommodate variation in the line of two surfaces. Hinges (16) are provided between the cabinet and the lid. These hinges can be antigravity hinges. These can be made of DELRIN or NYLON. The advantage is that they are frictionless rust proof materials. They can also be made of ABS. Due to the presence of antigravity hinges, the lid of the cabinet is not allowed to fall. These hinges enable the lid to fall slowly on the container or cabinet. To avoid extreme movement of the lid a chain is also connected between the cabinet and the lid.<br>
To manufacture a pouring junction, the sheet metal is cut to requisite profiles using shearing cutter and press tools. These profiles are then taken to a break press for bending which is followed by crimping with the help of a hand held crimping tool to form the cabinet. The next step is coating. This is done preferably by spraying the powder to be coated by a gun. Prior to coating, the cabinet is inspected and degreased in an acid bath. The cabinet is then rinsed with normal water and dried in hot air. It is then moved to the spray booth where powder is sprayed with an electrostatic gun. This helps in charging and adhesion of the powder<br><br>
particles on the surface of the cabinet. The cabinet is then transferred to an oven and cured for 30 minutes at 220 degrees Celsius temperature. The cabinet is then ready for assembling the components by means of placing and fastening such as by nuts and bolts.<br>
In the specification and claims reference is made to pouring junction but it should be understood that the use of this term encompasses other forms of dispensers.<br>
It will therefore be readily understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention is susceptible to broad utility and application.<br>
Many embodiments and adaptations of the present invention other than those herein described as well as many variations, modifications and equivalent arrangements will be apparent from or reasonably suggested by the present invention and foregoing description thereof without departing from the substance or scope of the present invention. Accordingly, while the present invention has been described herein in detail in relation to its preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that this disclosure is only illustrative and exemplary of the present invention and is made merely for the purpose of providing a full and enabling disclosure of the invention.
