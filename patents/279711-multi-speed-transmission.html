CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/942,749 filed on June 8, 2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The invention relates generally to a multiple speed transmission<br>
having a plurality of planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting<br>
devices and more particularly to a transmission having eight or more speeds,<br>
four planetary gear sets and a plurality of torque transmitting devices.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0004] A typical multiple speed transmission uses a combination of<br>
friction clutches, planetary gear arrangements and fixed interconnections to<br>
achieve a plurality of gear ratios. The number and physical arrangement of the<br>
planetary gear sets, generally, are dictated by packaging, cost and desired speed<br>
ratios.<br>
 <br>
[0005] While current transmissions achieve their intended purpose, the<br>
need for new and improved transmission configurations which exhibit improved<br>
performance, especially from the standpoints of efficiency, responsiveness and<br>
smoothness and improved packaging, primarily reduced size and weight, is<br>
essentially constant. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved, cost-effective,<br>
compact multiple speed transmission.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] In an aspect of the present invention, a transmission is provided<br>
having an input member, an output member, four planetary gear sets, a plurality<br>
of interconnecting members and a plurality of torque transmitting devices. Each<br>
of the planetary gear sets includes first, second and third members. The first<br>
interconnecting member continuously interconnects the first member of the first<br>
planetary gear set with a stationary member. The second interconnecting<br>
member continuously interconnects the second member of the first planetary<br>
gear set with the first member of the fourth planetary gear set. The third<br>

planetary gear set.<br>
[0011] In still another aspect of the present invention, the fifth of the<br>
five torque transmitting devices is selectively engageable to interconnect at least<br>
one of the first member of the first planetary gear set and the stationary member<br>
with at least one of the first member of the second planetary gear set and the<br>
second member of the third planetary gear set.<br>
[0012] In yet another aspect of the present invention, the first member<br>
of the first planetary gear set, the third member of the second planetary gear set,<br>
the third member of the third planetary gear set and third member of the fourth<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0021] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0022] At the outset, it should be appreciated that in the particular<br>
example provided, the eight speed automatic transmission of the present<br>
invention has an arrangement of permanent mechanical connections between<br>
 <br>
the elements of the four planetary gear sets. A first component or element of a<br>
first planetary gear set is permanently coupled to ground or a transmission<br>
housing. A second component or element of the first planetary gear set is<br>
permanently coupled to a first component or element of the fourth planetary gear<br>
set. A third component or element of a first planetary gear set is permanently<br>
coupled to a second component or element of a second planetary gear set. A<br>
first component or element of a second planetary gear set is permanently<br>
coupled to a second component or element of a third planetary gear set. Finally,<br>
a third component or element of the second planetary gear set is permanently<br>
coupled to a third component or element of a third planetary gear set.<br>
[0023] Referring now to FIG. 1, an embodiment of an eight speed<br>
transmission 10 is illustrated in a lever diagram format. A lever diagram is a<br>
schematic representation of the components of a mechanical device such as an<br>
automatic transmission. Each individual lever represents a planetary gear set<br>
wherein the three basic mechanical components of the planetary gear set are<br>
each represented by a node. Therefore, a single lever contains three nodes:<br>
one for the sun gear, one for the planet gear carrier, and one for the ring gear.<br>
The relative length between the nodes of each lever can be used to represent the<br>
ring-to-sun ratio of each respective gear set. These lever ratios, in turn, are used<br>
to vary the gear ratios of the transmission in order to achieve appropriate ratios<br>
and ratio progression. Mechanical couplings or interconnections between the<br>
nodes of the various planetary gear sets are illustrated by thin, horizontal lines<br>
and torque transmitting devices such as clutches and brakes are presented as<br>
 <br>
interleaved fingers. If the device is a brake, one set of the fingers is grounded.<br>
Further explanation of the format, purpose and use of lever diagrams can be<br>
found in SAE Paper 810102, "The Lever Analogy: A New Tool in Transmission<br>
Analysis" by Benford and Leising which is hereby fully incorporated by reference.<br>
[0024] The transmission 10 includes an input shaft or member 12, a<br>
first planetary gear set 14 having three nodes: a first node 14A, a second node<br>
14B and a third node 14C, a second planetary gear set 16 having three nodes: a<br>
first node 16A, a second node 16B and a third node 16C, a third planetary gear<br>
set 18 having three nodes: a first node 18A, a second node 18B and a third node<br>
18C, a fourth planetary gear set 20 having three nodes: a first node 20A, a<br>
second node 20B and a third node 20C and an output shaft or member 22.<br>
[0025] The input member 12 is coupled to the third node 20C of the<br>
fourth planetary gear set 20. The output member 22 is coupled to the second<br>
node 20B of the fourth planetary gear set 20. The first node 14A of the first<br>
planetary gear set 14 is coupled to a ground or transmission housing 50. The<br>
second node 14B of the first planetary gear set 14 is coupled to the first node<br>
20A of the fourth planetary gear set 20. The third node 14C of the first planetary<br>
gear set 14 is coupled to the second node 16B of the second planetary gear set<br>
16. The first node 16A of the second planetary gear set 16 is coupled to the<br>
second node 18B of the third planetary gear set 18. The third node 16C of the<br>
second planetary gear set 16 is coupled to the third node 18C of the third<br>
planetary gear set 18.<br>
 <br>
[0026] A first clutch 26 selectively connects the third node 18C of the<br>
third planetary gear set 18 to the second node 20B of the fourth planetary gear<br>
set 20 and to the output shaft or member 22. A second clutch 28 selectively<br>
connects first node 18A of the third planetary gear set 18 to the third node 20C of<br>
the fourth planetary gear set 20. A third clutch 30 selectively connects first node<br>
18A of the third planetary gear set 18 to the second node 20B of the fourth<br>
planetary gear set 20. A fourth clutch 32 selectively connects the first node 16A<br>
of the second planetary gear set 16 and the second node 18B of the third<br>
planetary gear set 18 to the second node 14B of the first planetary gear set 14<br>
and the first node 20A of the fourth planetary gear set 20. A brake 34 selectively<br>
connects the first node 16A of the second planetary gear set 16 to a ground or a<br>
transmission housing 50.<br>
[0027] Referring now to Fig. 2, a stick diagram presents a schematic<br>
layout of the embodiment of the eight speed transmission 10 according to the<br>
present invention. In Fig. 2, the numbering from the lever diagram of Fig. 1 is<br>
carried over. The clutches, brake and couplings are correspondingly presented<br>
whereas the nodes of the planetary gear sets now appear as components of<br>
planetary gear sets such as sun gears, ring gears, planet gears and planet gear<br>
carriers.<br>
[0028] For example, the planetary gear set 14 is a planetary gear set<br>
that includes a sun gear member 14A, a planet gear carrier member 14B<br>
supports a set of planet gears 14D and a ring gear member 14C. The sun gear<br>
member 14A is connected to ground or transmission housing 50 through a first<br>
 <br>
shaft or interconnecting member 42 and to a second shaft or interconnecting<br>
member 44. The ring gear member 14C is connected for common rotation to a<br>
third shaft or interconnecting member 46. The planet gear carrier member 14B is<br>
connected for common rotation with a fourth shaft or interconnecting member 48<br>
and a fifth shaft or interconnecting member 52. Each of the planet gears 14D are<br>
configured to intermesh with both the ring gear member 14C and the sun gear<br>
member 14A.<br>
[0029] The input shaft or member 12 is continuously connected to an<br>
engine (not shown) or to a turbine of a torque converter (not shown). The output<br>
shaft or member 22 is continuously connected with the final drive unit or transfer<br>
case (not shown).<br>
[0030] The planetary gear set 16 is a planetary gear set that includes a<br>
sun gear member 16C, a ring gear member 16A and a planet carrier member<br>
16B that rotatably supports a set of planet gears 16D. The sun gear member<br>
16C is connected for common rotation with a sixth shaft or interconnecting<br>
member 54. The ring gear member 16A is connected for common rotation with a<br>
seventh shaft or interconnecting member 56 and an eighth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 58. The planet carrier member 16B is connected for<br>
common rotation with third shaft or interconnecting member 46. Each of the<br>
planet gears 16D are configured to intermesh with both sun gear member 16C<br>
and ring gear member 16A.<br>
[0031] The planetary gear set 18 is a planetary gear set that includes a<br>
sun gear member 18C, a ring gear member 18A and a planet carrier member<br>
 <br>
18B that rotatably supports a set of planet gears 18D. The sun gear member<br>
18C is connected for common rotation with the sixth shaft or interconnecting<br>
member 54 and a ninth shaft or interconnecting member 60. The ring gear<br>
member 18A is connected for common rotation with a tenth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 62. The planet carrier member 18B is connected for<br>
common rotation with eighth shaft or interconnecting member 58. Each of the<br>
planet gears 18D are configured to intermesh with both the sun gear member<br>
18C and the ring gear member 18A.<br>
[0032] The planetary gear set 20 is a planetary gear set that includes a<br>
sun gear member 20C, a planet carrier member 20B that rotatably supports a<br>
set of planet gears 20D, and a ring gear member 20A. The sun gear member<br>
20C is connected for common rotation with input shaft or member 12. The planet<br>
carrier member 20B is connected for common rotation with an eleventh shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 64 and output shaft or member 22. The ring gear<br>
member 20A is connected for common rotation with fourth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 48. Each of the planet gears 20D are configured to<br>
intermesh with both the ring gear member 20A and sun gear member 20C.<br>
[0033] The torque-transmitting mechanisms or clutches 26, 28, 30, 32<br>
and brake 34 allow for selective interconnection of the shafts or interconnecting<br>
members, members of the planetary gear sets and the housing. For example,<br>
the first clutch 26 is selectively engageable to connect the ninth shaft or<br>
interconnecting member 60 to the eleventh shaft or interconnecting member 64.<br>
The second clutch 28 is selectively engageable to connect the input shaft or<br>
 <br>
member 12 to tenth shaft or interconnecting member 62. The third clutch 30 is<br>
selectively engageable to connect the tenth shaft or interconnecting member 62<br>
to eleventh shaft or interconnecting member 64. The fourth clutch 32 is<br>
selectively engageable to connect the fifth shaft or interconnecting member 52 to<br>
seventh shaft or interconnecting member 56. The brake 34 is selectively<br>
engageable to connect seventh shaft or interconnecting member 56 (through first<br>
and second shafts 42 and 44) to ground or transmission housing 50 to restrict<br>
rotation of seventh shaft or interconnecting member 56 relative to transmission<br>
housing 50.<br>
[0034] Referring now to Figs. 2 and 3, the operation of the embodiment<br>
of the eight speed transmission 10 will be described. It will be appreciated that<br>
transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the input shaft or member<br>
12 to the output shaft or member 22 in at least eight forward speed or torque<br>
ratios and at least one reverse speed or torque ratio. Each forward and reverse<br>
speed or torque ratio is attained by engagement of one or more of the torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms (i.e. first clutch 26, second clutch 28, third clutch 30,<br>
fourth clutch 32, and brake 34), as will be explained below. Fig. 3 is a truth table<br>
presenting the various combinations of torque-transmitting mechanisms that are<br>
activated or engaged to achieve the various gear states. Actual numerical gear<br>
ratios of the various gear states are also presented although it should be<br>
appreciated that these numerical values are exemplary only and that they may<br>
be adjusted over significant ranges to accommodate various applications and<br>
operational criteria of the transmission 10. An example of the gear ratios that<br>
 <br>
may be obtained using the embodiments of the present invention are also shown<br>
in Fig. 3. Of course, other gear ratios are achievable depending on the gear<br>
diameter, gear teeth count and gear configuration selected.<br>
[0035] To establish reverse gear, the second clutch 28 and the brake<br>
34 are engaged or activated. The second clutch 28 connects the input shaft or<br>
member 12 to tenth shaft or interconnecting member 62. The brake 34 connects<br>
seventh shaft or interconnecting member 56 (through first and second shafts 42<br>
and 44) to ground or transmission housing 50 to restrict rotation of seventh shaft<br>
or interconnecting member 56 relative to transmission housing 50. Likewise, the<br>
eight forward ratios are achieved through different combinations of clutch and<br>
brake engagement, as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
[0036] It will be appreciated that the foregoing explanation of operation<br>
and gear states of the eight speed transmission 10 assumes, first of all, that all<br>
the clutches not specifically referenced in a given gear state are inactive or<br>
disengaged and, second of all, that during gear shifts, i.e., changes of gear state,<br>
between at least adjacent gear states, a clutch or brake engaged or activated in<br>
both gear states will remain engaged or activated.<br>
[0037] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the essence of the invention are intended<br>
to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as<br>
a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
