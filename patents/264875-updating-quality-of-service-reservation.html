				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to reservation of resources in a network and more precisely to<br>
reserving and updating quality of service reservation of resources on the network via a proxy<br>
node.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Historically, voice traffic in telecommunications network has been transiting over reserved<br>
circuit switching resources. Packet switched resources had been used for data traffic, but are<br>
now being genuinely used for voice traffic using, for instance, Voice over Internet Protocol<br>
(VoIP). This is more efficient, but leads to new problems concerning the quality of service<br>
(QoS) guaranties since the IP packet switching protocols is a best effort network. In other<br>
words, IP networks do not provide QoS guaranties as such and mechanisms need to be added<br>
thereto to overcome the situation.<br>
Other challenges of the present telecommunications network include enabling efficient<br>
establishment and maintenance of the QoS guaranties (i.e. the establishment should not affect<br>
the perceived QoS). It must also be possible to establish the QoS guaranties between two end<br>
points located in distant networks not sharing the same administrative domain. For instance,<br>
the establishment of the QoS guaranties should be possible between two users of two<br>
networks owned by two different operators. In this example, as can be foreseen, each operator<br>
refrains the other operator from monopolizing resources on its network without its consent<br>
(explicit or implicit).<br>
At the moment, reservation of resource in various networks can be done via the well known<br>
RSVP mechanism (IETF: RFC 2205). In RSVP, a reservation is defined between to end<br>
points for a given type of communication or protocol. The reservation mechanism of RSVP<br>
uses a first message (PATH) sent from the emitter of the communication toward the other<br>
end. Each network equipment on the way therebetween simply forwards the PATH message<br>
up to its destination. The destination replies with a reservation message (RESV) that follows<br>
the same path as the PATH message. The RESV message reserves the resources in each<br><br>
network equipment on its way back to the source of the PATH message. Since the reservation<br>
is valid for traffic transiting in only one direction, a typical conversation between two parties<br>
also requires the same reservation to be made by the other end (or destination) of the<br>
communication toward the emitter thereof. After establishment of the communication, each<br>
end needs to refresh the reservation at regular interval otherwise the reservation is abandoned<br>
by the network equipment. Important prerequisites to RSVP are that all network equipment<br>
between the end points need to be compatible therewith and they also need to agree on the<br>
interval at which the reservation need to be refreshed.<br>
Some attempts were done to enable RSVP to be adapted to networks where all network<br>
equipment is not compatible with RSVP. The principle applied in such cases is to use the last<br>
network equipment compatible with RSVP as a proxy of the end point. The proxy RSVP end<br>
point therefore answers the PATH message addressed to the end point with a RESV message<br>
on behalf of the end point. The result is that the emitter of the communication sees the<br>
reservation as valid up to the destination end point even though it is interrupted by the proxy<br>
RSVP end point. It does not address the need for a reservation to transit between different<br>
administrative domains.<br>
Another prior art solution aimed at reducing overhead created by the RSVP refresh procedure.<br>
It enables a shorter refresh message to be used in lieu of the one specified in the original<br>
RSVP. The solution also provided a mechanism to ensure reliability of the refresh messages<br>
by re-emitting lost messages. It does not address the need for a reservation to be maintained<br>
efficiently in different administrative domains.<br>
As can be appreciated, efficient establishment and maintenance of the QoS guaranties related<br>
to voice traffic transiting over packet switched resources for end points located in different<br>
administrative domains cannot be provided by the prior art solutions. The present invention<br>
provides such a solution.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A first aspect of the present invention is directed to a router in a first administrative domain of<br>
a telecommunications network wherein the first administrative domain comprises a first end<br><br>
point having a first address. The first end point is associated to a reservation for a session<br>
transiting through the router between the first end point and a second end point in a second<br>
administrative domain. The router comprises a quality of service (QoS) reservation module<br>
capable of receiving an address modification notification related to the reservation from the<br>
first end point through a first access router, wherein the address modification notification<br>
indicates that the first end point changes its first address for a second address since the first<br>
end point is changing from the first access router to a second access router and issuing a first<br>
reservation message on behalf of the second end point toward the second access router.<br>
Optionally, the QoS reservation module of the router may further comprise a reservation table<br>
and be capable of updating a first record related to the first end point and its first address in<br>
view of the address modification notification and receiving an acknowledge message<br>
addressed from the first end point issued from the second access router concerning the first<br>
reservation message.<br>
A second aspect of the present invention is directed to a method of updating a reservation<br>
established for a session between a first end point in a first administrative domain and a<br>
second end point in a second administrative domain wherein the reservation is valid in the<br>
first administrative domain between the first end point, an access router and a domain router.<br>
The method comprises the steps of detecting that the first end point connected to the access<br>
router needs to change toward a second access router, in the domain router, receiving an<br>
address modification notification related to the reservation from the first end point and issuing<br>
a first reservation message from the domain router on behalf of the second end point toward<br>
the second access router.<br>
Optionally, the method may further comprise the steps of updating a first record in a<br>
reservation table maintained by the domain router, wherein the first record relates to the first<br>
end point and receiving an acknowledge message addressed from the first end point issued<br>
from the second access router concerning the first reservation message.<br>
A third aspect of the present invention is directed to an end point having a first address in a<br>
first administrative domain of a telecommunications network. The first administrative domain<br>
comprises a first access router and a domain router. The end point is associated to a<br><br>
reservation for a session transiting through the first access router and the domain router<br>
toward a second end point in a second administrative domain and comprises a quality of<br>
service (QoS) reservation module capable of, upon detection of a need for a change from the<br>
first access router to a second access router, issuing an address modification notification<br>
related to the reservation toward the domain router, wherein the address modification<br>
notification indicates that the end point changes its first address for a second address since the<br>
end point is changing from the first access router to a second access router.<br>
Optionally, the QoS reservation module of the end point is further capable of, upon detection<br>
of a need for a change from the first access router to the second access router, obtaining the<br>
second address from the second access router.<br>

following Detailed Description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings<br>
wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is an exemplary network topology in accordance with the teachings of the present<br>
invention;<br>

present invention.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The present invention provides a mechanism optimizing the reservation of resources best<br>
fitted for resource-limited networks by proxying the reservation establishment, the reservation<br>
refresh and the reservation update. The terminology used in the following description could<br><br>
be seen as similar to the one used in the prior art RSVP, but do not limit the present invention<br>
to characteristics of the RSVP.<br>
Reference is made to the drawings where Figure 1 shows an exemplary network<br>
100 topology in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. Figure 1 shows a<br>
mobile node (MN) 112 involved hi a session with a correspondent node (CN) 190 via various<br>
pieces of network equipment. The MN 112 is connected to a first access router (AR1) 116<br>
through a link 114. In usual implementations, the link 114 is formed by multiple network<br>
equipment and, therefore, by multiple sublinks not shown for clarity purposes. The sublinks<br>
may also be completely or partly wireless. The AR1116 is further connected to a Mobile<br>
Anchor Point (MAP) 140 through a link 118. Just like the link 114 and other other links 128,<br>
138 and 192 shown on Figure 1, the link 118 is usually composed of multiple sublinks of<br>
various types not shown for clarity purposes. The MAP 140 is, in turn connected, to the CN<br>
190 through the link 192. The AR1116 defines a first coverage area 110 in which the MN 112<br>
is located. Other access routers AR2 126 and AR3 136 further define respective coverage<br>
areas 120 and 130. The MAP 140 defines a first administrative domain 142 comprising the<br>
coverage areas 110,120 and 130. The number of coverage areas and access routers in a<br>
typical network implementing the invention shown using the exemplary network 100 is higher<br>
than three, but this has been chosen as an illustrative example. The link 192 is shown in dotted<br>
line since it is unlikely that a direct link between the MAP 140 and the CN 190 could exist.<br>
The link 192, in typical implementations, would cross another administrative domain's<br>
boundary (not shown) before reaching the CN 190. The MN 112 is further shown moving in<br>
time toward the second coverage area 120 (arrow 115).<br>
Reference is now made concurrently to Figure 1 and Figure 2, which shows a nodal operation<br>
and flow chart of mechanisms in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. The<br>
MN 112, the AR1116, the AR2 126, the AR3 136, the MAP 140 and the CN 190 are shown<br>
on Figure2. The MN 112 has three addresses LCoAl, RCoA and HoA associated therewith.<br>
LCoAl is an address, typical IPv6, valid within the first coverage area 110. The RCoA is an<br>
address, typical IPv6, valid in the administrative domain 142. HCoA or HA is a home address,<br>
typically IPv6, that is associated with the MN 112 permanently. Various addresses and ways<br>
of assigning the addresses, which fall outside the scope of the present invention, can be used<br><br>
as long as the validity thereof is guaranteed within their respective applicable zone. Figure 2<br>
shows three scenarios separated by dotted lines 210 and 220. All three scenarios work<br>
together in a typical implementation of the present invention. However, each scenario may be<br>
implemented independently from the others in view of the needs and the characteristics of the<br>
existing infrastructure.<br>
In the first scenario (above line 210), the MN 112 connects with the CN 190 in the session<br>
(step 2100). Various messages (not shown) may usually be exchanged between the MN 112,<br>
the CN 190 and various intermediate nodes. The present invention does not address these<br>
exchanges, but rather comes into consideration for QoS reservation related to the session<br>
(established already or currently establishing). In order to reserve the resources within the<br>
administrative domain 142, the MN 112 sends a first reservation message 2110 address to the<br>
CN 190 toward the AR1116 to reserve resources for all traffic related to the session sent from<br>
the MN112 toward the CN 190. In typical implementations, the reservation message 2110<br>
contains QoS requirements related thereto. However, it is possible that the QoS requirements<br>
to be implicitly applied in view, for instance, of other information exchanged during<br>
establishment of the session or in view of the identity (e.g. addresses, client authentication,<br>
etc.) of the end points involved.<br>
Upon reception of the first reservation message 2110, the AR1116 may create a refresh state<br>
(step 2220), which is used in case of implementation of the second scenario shown between<br>
lines 210 and 220, as will be shown later. The AR1116 further reserves the resources in view<br>
of the QoS requirements and sends a second reservation message 2112 toward the MAP 140.<br>
The MAP 140 then updates a reservation table (step 2119) containing a record to associating<br>
the QoS requirements of the session with the MN 112 as the source and the CN 190 as the<br>
destination. The MAP 140 further replies to the first reservation message 2112 with an<br>
acknowledge message 2114 on behalf of the CN 190 just as if the acknowledge message 2112<br>
had been sent therefrom and forwarded on the link 192 up to the MAP 140 and, then, to the<br>
AR1116 on the link 118. The step 2118 of updating the reservation table can be done before or<br>
after the step of sending the acknowledge message 2114 without affecting the functioning of<br>
the present invention. The MAP 140 then sends a third reservation message 2120 on behalf of<br>
the CN 190 toward the AR1116 to reserve resources for traffic related to the session transiting<br>
from the CN 190 toward the MN 112. The AR1116 may then reserve the relevant resources<br><br>
and send a fourth reservation message 2122 toward the MN 112. The MN 112 then replies<br>
with an acknowledge message 2124 addressed to the CN 190 toward the AR1116, which is<br>
forwarded thereby toward the MAP 140 in an acknowledge message 2126. The step 2118 of<br>
updating the table may further comprise a step of updating or adding a record to associate the<br>
QoS requirements of the session with the MN 112 as the destination and the CN 190 as the<br>
source. Again, these steps could be done in various orders for various reasons without<br>
affecting the general results of the present invention. The MAP 140 may further optionally<br>
exchange messages represented on Figure 2 by the triple dotted line 2500 in order to establish<br>
reservation of resources in the whole or part of the link 192. This may not be necessary due to<br>
existing Service Level Agreements (SLA) existing between the MAP 140 and other entities.<br>
The type or need for such reservation fall outside the scope of the present invention. It is,<br>
however, interesting to note that the CN 190 could be located in a further administrative<br>
domain similar to the administrative domain 142. In such a case, the present invention would<br>
enable a reservation to be made in the further administrative domain by a further MAP similar<br>
to the MAP 140 on behalf of the MN 112 even though no reservation between the MAP 140<br>
and the further MAP exist.<br>
The second scenario is shown between lines 210 and 220. In order to refresh an established<br>
reservation, the AR1116 could create a refresh state as shown earlier by the step 2220. The<br>
refresh state could comprise a refresh timer set from any of the reservation messages 2110,<br>
2114,2120 and 2122 or implicitly from configuration or the like. The AR1116 determines<br>
that a refresh of the existing reservation from the MN 112 toward the CN 190 is needed upon<br>
expiration of the refresh timer or by any other ways (step 2210). It then sends a refresh<br>
reservation message 2230 toward the MAP 140 on behalf of the MN 112 and receives an<br>
acknowledge message 2240, related thereto, addressed from the CN 190. The AR1116 may<br>
further update its own reservation upon sending the refresh reservation message 2230. The<br>
acknowledge message 2240 is sent by the MAP 140 on behalf of the CN 190 upon reception<br>
of the refresh reservation message 2230. The MAP 140 then sends a further refresh<br>
reservation message 2250 on behalf of the CN 190 upon determining that a refresh is needed<br>
for the reservation from the CN 190 toward the MN 112. The determination could be done,<br>
for instance, via a refresh timer of a refresh state similar to the refresh state maintained by the<br>
AR1116 or may be triggered by the reception of the refresh reservation message 2230<br>
addressed from the MN 112 received from the AR1116.<br>
8<br><br>
In the third scenario (below line 220), the MN 112 moves from the first coverage area 110<br>
toward the second coverage area 120 under the responsibility of the AR2 126 (arrow 115).<br>
Since the LCoAl is valid only within the first coverage area 110, the MN112 needs to obtain a<br>
second address (LCoA2) valid in the second coverage area 120 (step 2310). This is usually<br>
achieved upon detection by the MN 112 or the AR1116 or the AR2 126 that the MN 112 is<br>
leaving the first coverage area 110. When and how this is achieved is outside of the scope of<br>
the present invention. Moreover, the way LCo A2 is communicated between the MN 112 and<br>
the AR2 126 is also outside of the scope of the present invention. However, when the MN 112<br>
receives the LCoA2, it needs to change the ongoing reservations. This may involve updating<br>
the reservations maintained in the MAP 140 even though the usual implementation would use<br>
the RCoA in identifying the reservations therein. The address modification needs to trigger<br>
the reservation of resources in the AR2 126. In order to do so, the MN 112 sends an address<br>
modification notification 2320 toward the MAP 140, which sends a reservation message 2330<br>
on behalf of the CN 190. The AR2 126 sends an acknowledge message 2340 related to the<br>
received the reservation message 2330. The AR2 126 may further create a refresh state 2222<br>
used in the second scenario described between lines 210 and 220. The AR2 126 also send a<br>
further reservation message 2350 on behalf of the MN 112 toward the CN 190. The MAP 140<br>
acknowledges the further reservation message 2350 with a further acknowledge message 2360<br>
sent on behalf of the CN 190 toward the MN 112. The AR2 126 does not need to forward the<br>
acknowledge message 2360 to the MN 112.<br>
Figure 3 shows a modular representation of a router 300 in accordance with the teachings of<br>
the present invention. The router 300 is a generalization of the MAP 140 and the AR1116 (or<br>
AR2 126 and AR3 136). It comprises a quality of service reservation module 310 and,<br>
optionally, may comprise a reservation table 320 and a refresh state 330. The refresh timer<br>
mentioned in the second scenario could be maintained in the reservation table 320 (as shown<br>
by the dotted box) or may be comprised in the refresh state 330. The quality of service<br>
module 310 may be capable of implementing the present invention completely or partially as<br>
described above. More specifically, an example is taken where the router 300 is located in a<br>
first administrative domain comprising a first end point. The first end point is associated to a<br>
session transiting through the router 300 between the first end point and a second end point in<br>
a second administrative domain. The reservation module 310 maintains the reservation table<br><br>
320 associated with the session. The QoS reservation module 310 is capable of, upon<br>
reception of a first reservation message from the first end point addressed to the second end<br>
point, establishing a first reservation for traffic related to the session issued from the first end<br>
point to the second end point by adding a corresponding first record in the reservation table<br>
320. The first record comprises an address of the first end point as the source of the traffic, an<br>
address of the second end point as the destination of the traffic and a first associated QoS<br>
level in accordance with the received first reservation message. Further to this reservation<br>
message, the QoS reservation module 310 is further capable of replying with an acknowledge<br>
message confirming the first reservation back to the first end point on behalf of the second<br>
end point and sending a second reservation message toward the first end point on behalf of the<br>
second end point. In such a case, the second reservation message relates to traffic related to<br>
the session issued from the second end point to the first end point. The QoS reservation<br>
module 310 is also further capable of establishing a second reservation in accordance with the<br>
second reservation message by adding a corresponding second record in the reservation table<br>
320. Similarly to the first one, the second record comprises an address of the second end point<br>
as the source of the traffic, the address of the first end point as the destination of the traffic<br>
and a second associated QoS level in accordance with the sent second reservation message.<br>
The QoS reservation module 310 may also maintain the refresh state 330 and the refresh timer<br>
associated with the reservation. In such an example, the QoS reservation module 310 is<br>
capable, upon expiration of the refresh timer associated to the refresh state or in the<br>
reservation table 320, of sending a refresh reservation message toward the second end point<br>
on behalf of the first end point; and upon reception of a refresh confirmation message to the<br>
refresh reservation message, resetting the refresh timer of the refresh state without forwarding<br>
the refresh confirmation message toward the first end point. The QoS reservation module 310<br>
may further be capable of, upon expiration of the refresh timer associated to the refresh state,<br>
refreshing the reservation in the router 300.<br>
Furthermore, the QoS reservation module 310 may be capable of receiving an address<br>
modification notification related to the reservation from the first end point through the first<br>
access router. The address modification notification indicates that the first end point changes<br>
from a first address valid with the first access router to a second address valid with a second<br>
access router since the first end point is changing from the first access router to the second<br>
10<br><br>
access router. Thereafter, the QoS reservation module 310 is capable of issuing a first<br>
reservation message on behalf of the second end point toward the second access router. The<br>
QoS reservation module may further be capable of updating a first record related to the first<br>
end point and its first address in view of the address modification notification in the<br>
reservation table 320 and receiving an acknowledge message addressed from the first end<br>
point issued from the second access router concerning the first reservation message.<br>
In this last example, the end point having the first address needs to be capable of, upon<br>
detection of a need for a change from the first access router to the second access router issuing<br>
the address modification notification related to the reservation toward a domain router (MAP<br>
in the previous examples). The address modification notification indicates, as mentioned<br>
earlier, that the end point changes its first address for the second address since the end point is<br>
changing from the first access router to the second access router. This capability of the end<br>
point could be implemented in a QoS reservation module therein (not shown). The QoS<br>
reservation module of the end point may further be capable of obtaining the second address<br>
from the second access router, or the domain router prior to sending the address modification<br>
notification.<br>
Although several preferred embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated in the<br>
accompanying drawings and described in the foregoing description, it will be understood that<br>
the invention is not limited to the embodiments disclosed, but is capable of numerous<br>
rearrangements, modifications and substitutions without departing from the teachings of the<br>
present invention. For example, even though the figures present simple and linear scenarios to<br>
facilitate understanding, this is not to be construed as a pre-requisite thereof. Indeed, the<br>
solution applies to networks of arbitrary topology and is also fitted to large topologies. In<br>
general, statements made in the description of the present invention do not necessarily limit<br>
any of the various claimed aspects of the present invention. Moreover, some statements may<br>
apply to some inventive features but not to others. In the drawings, like or similar elements<br>
are designated with identical reference numerals throughout the several views, and the various<br>
elements depicted are not necessarily drawn to scale.<br>

We Claim;<br>
[1] A router in a first administrative domain of a telecommunications network, the first<br>
administrative domain comprising a first end point having a first address, the first end point<br>
being associated to a reservation for a session transiting through the router between the first<br>
end point and a second end point in a second administrative domain, the router comprising a<br>
quality of service (QoS) reservation module, the QoS reservation module being capable of:<br>
-     receiving an address modification notification related to the reservation from the first<br>
end point through a first access router, wherein the address modification notification<br>
indicates that the first end point changes its first address for a second address since the<br>
first end point is changing from the first access router to a second access router; and<br>
-     issuing a first reservation message on behalf of the second end point toward the<br>
second access router.<br>
[2] The router of claim 1 wherein the QoS reservation module further comprises a reservation<br>
table, the QoS reservation module being further capable of<br>
-     updating a first record related to the first end point and its first address in view of the<br>
address modification notification; and<br>
-     receiving an acknowledge message addressed from the first end point issued from the<br>
second access router concerning the first reservation message.<br>
[3] A method of updating a reservation established for a session between a first end point in a<br>
first administrative domain and a second end point in a second administrative domain,<br>
wherein the reservation is valid in the first administrative domain between the first end point,<br>
an access router and a domain router, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
-     detecting that the first end point connected to the access router needs to change toward<br>
a second access router;<br>
-     in the domain router, receiving an address modification notification related to the<br>
reservation from the first end point; and<br>
12<br><br>
-     issuing a first reservation message from the domain router on behalf of the second end<br>
point toward the second access router.<br>
[4] The method of claim 3 further comprising the steps of:<br>
-     updating a first record in a reservation table maintained by the domain router, wherein<br>
the first record relates to the first end point; and<br>
-     receiving an acknowledge message addressed from the first end point issued from the<br>
second access router concerning the first reservation message.<br>
[5] An end point having a first address in a first administrative domain of a<br>
telecommunications network, the first administrative domain comprising a first access router<br>
and a domain router, the end point being associated to a reservation for a session transiting<br>
through the first access router and the domain router toward a second end point in a second<br>
administrative domain, the end point router comprising a quality of service (QoS) reservation<br>
module, the QoS reservation module being capable of:<br>
-     upon detection of a need for a change from the first access router to a second access<br>
router:<br>
-     issuing an address modification notification related to the reservation toward the<br>
domain router, wherein the address modification notification indicates that the end<br>
point changes its first address for a second address since the end point is changing<br>
from the first access router to a second access router.<br>
[6] The end point of claim 5 wherein the QoS reservation module is further capable of, upon<br>
detection of a need for a change from the first access router to the second access router,<br>
obtaining the second address from the second access router.<br>
Dated this 10th day of May 2007.<br><br>
A method, an associated end point and an associated for updating a reservation established for a session between a first end point in a first administrative domain and a second end point in a second administrative domain wherein the reservation is valid in the first administrative domain between the first end point, an access router and a domain router. The method comprises the steps of detecting that the first end point connected to the access router needs to change toward a second access router, in the domain router, receiving an address modification notification related to the reservation from the first end point and issuing a first reservation message from the domain router on behalf of the second end point toward the second access router.</td>
