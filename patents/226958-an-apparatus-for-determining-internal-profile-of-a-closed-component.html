component of identifying the thickness, outer profile and internal profile of a closed<br>
component such a pipe.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Ultrasonic testing is a well established non-destructive testing method for evaluating the<br>
quality of raw material, semi-finished and finished products. Ultrasonic thickness<br>
measurement is also a standard method for evaluating the thickness of different<br>
materials.<br>

there exists a requirement of identifying the internal profile of the product.<br>
U.S. Patent no. US5577088 discloses an invention which uses pulsed ultrasonic energy<br>
for examining the prismatic face of the internal profile of a tubular part so that all the<br>
internal dimensions are examined in one go. The cited patent publication describes a<br>
method for checking the quality of the cladding of the part which is prismatic in shape.<br>
GB Patent no. GB1536102 describes an invention which relates to identification of a<br>
position defect inside an object and presenting the image of the same.<br>
Russian Patent no. RU2149394 describes an invention which utilizes two pulse trains<br>
sent through a liquid medium and evaluates condition of the pipe including defects and<br>
anomalous zones if any in the material after calculating the time taken for the transit<br>
including local reflection.<br><br>
Japanese patent JP61090052 relates to automatic detection including alignment<br>
of different diameter part of the internal surface of a pipe by providing a lever. A<br>
changeover valve which switches a liquid according to the motion of the lever is<br>
provided. The force of the liquid expanding and contracting a probe for the<br>
automatic detection.<br>
US Patent no. US5431053 discloses a system which uses two ultrasonic<br>
transducers for acquiring the signals received with a test piece and a standard<br>
specimen. The received signals are analyzed and compared and images are<br>
ultrasonically produced to determine the difference.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a system for identifying the<br>
internal profile of a closed object.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose a system for identifying the internal<br>
profile of a closed object which is totally non-destructive.<br>
A further object of the invention is to propose a system for identifying the<br>
internal profile of a closed object which comprises initial identification of the<br>
thickness and outer profile of the closed object by measurement.<br>
These and other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from<br>
the ensuing description.<br>
At the outset of the description, which follows, it is to be understood that the<br>
ensuing description only illustrates a particular form of this invention. However,<br>
such a particular form is only an exemplary embodiment and the teachings of the<br>
invention is not intended to be taken restrictively.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, there is provided an apparatus for determining internal profile of a<br>
closed component, in particular internal profile of a tubular shaped component,<br>
comprising: a water tank partially filled with water and accommodating a closed<br>
component submerged in the water, an ultrasonic wave generator having a<br>
receiver disposed at a gap from the closed component being partially submerged<br>
in the water, the generator being operable to transmit and receive sound wave<br>
via the water at a direction perpendicular to the job, the receiver of the wave<br>
generator configured to receive the echo generated by the sound wave reflecting<br>
back from an interface constituting the water and an outer surface of the<br>
component, a first travel time of the first reflected wave being displayed in a<br>
display unit; the display unit additionally displaying the echo generated by the<br>
transmitted wave and reflected back from an interface constituting an inner<br>
surface of the component and the air or water, a second travel time for the<br>
second reflected wave received at the receiver before being displayed in the<br>
display unit; wherein the displayed data relating to the first travel time of the<br>
first reflected wave and to the second travel time of the second reflected wave<br>
are multiplied respectively to the velocity of sound in the water and the velocity<br>
of sound in the material of the component to arrive at a first and second<br>
distance; and wherein the first and the second distances are determined at<br>
different positions of the component in submerged mode to determine the inner<br>
surface profile of the component.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 - Shows an embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
As shown in figure 1, a job (7) is placed in a water tank (1) filled with water (6),<br>
and an ultrasonic wave generator (2) is placed in the water tank (1) maintaining<br>
a gap (G) between the ultrasound wave generator (2) and the job (7) such that<br>
a generated wave is injected in the water (6) at an angle perpendicular to the<br>
job (7). When the ultrasound wave hits an interface of the water and the job (7),<br>
in particular at an outer surface of the job (7), a part of the sound wave is<br>
reflected back and the balance is transmitted into the job (7). The generator /<br>
receiver (2) receives the first reflection and an echo is displaced on a display unit<br>
(5). By measuring a time taken by the transmitted wave for its travel through<br>
water (61 and multiplying the time with the velocity of sound in water, a water<br>
distances determined. The transmitted sound wave further travels into the job<br>
(7) and an inner surface where water or air is present, the sound is reflected<br>
back. The reflected sound is picked up by a receiver part of the wave generator<br>
(2) and is displayed in the display unit (5). The distance (L2) is measured from<br>
the display unit (5) by measuring the time and multiplying the velocity of sound<br>
in the job (7). During the successive relation of the job (7) through 360 degrees<br>
in steps, the above process is repeated and the distance L1 and L2 are repeatedly<br>
calculated. Thus, the outer surface profile and the thickness of the job (7)<br>
measured. By drawing the lines corresponding to different values of L1 and L2 at<br>
different locations through polar coordinates, the inner surface and outer surface<br>
profile are determined for the job (7). An ultrasound pulser (4) is operably<br>
connected at one end to the wave generator (2) and to the display unit (5) via<br>
an interconnecting cable (3). A rotating means to rotate the job (7) is optionally<br>
provided.<br><br>
