				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for the simultaneous production of biogas mainly containing methane and biofertilizer using high rate biomethanation of palm oil mill effluent.<br>
The utility of the present invention is for degradation of an oily industrial effluent (palm oil mill effluent) and energy recovery by high rate biomethanation. The present invention makes use of a simple, cheap and biodegradable source for support material for immobilization of methanogens leading to efficient biomethanation.<br>
Anaerobic digestion process has been studied with waste biomasses of different origins (V.C.Kalia and G.Luthra, Bhartiya Vigyan Evam Audhyogic Patrika, 2:38; 1994). The process of anaerobic digestion is a multi step process of degradation of complex organic matter into methane and carbondioxide. A consortium of microbes work in syntrophic association. The process of anaerobic digestion is a multi step process of degradation of complex organic matter. Hydrolysis of complex organic molecules and their further metabolism into volatile fatty acids occurs in acidogenic stage. The intermediates of this process are ultimately converted into methane and carbondioxide during methanogenesis. The process efficiency is dependent upon a host of factors, the prime ones are high loading rate (LR) and low hydraulic retention time (HRT). On loading the reactor with slurry having high Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), the bacterial metabolism shifts towards generation of high chain fatty acids leading to reactor failure. Feed material has to be invariably diluted. It consequently leads to increased reactor volume. Similarly, HRT determines the reactor volume to be<br><br>
employed for digestion. Because of the slow growing nature of methanogens, the digestion periods i.e., retention of the material in the reactor has to be long. It also consequently leads to use of reactors with larger volumes, which<br>
is uneconomical and cumbersome. (POME) typically has an oil and grease<br><br>
content of 4 to 12 g /1. Some work on biomethanation of Palm oil mill effluent (POME) under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions has been reported. (R. Borja and C.J. Banks, Biotech. Letts., 15: 761 ;1993; R. Borja, C.J. Banks and E. Sanchez, J. Biotech., 45: 125;1996)..<br>
The major limitations encountered in disposal of different wastes through anaerobic digestion are loading rates and retention times. All efforts are targeted toward increasing efficiency of the process by overcoming these limitations. Liquid wastes with high COD content, if discharged into water bodies, cause water pollution. Hence, it is imperative to dispose of waste and reduce COD levels to within the acceptable limits set by Pollution Control Boards. In this study, the efforts have been concentrated towards developing a bio-process, which can be applied immediately at the industrial / commercial scale.<br>
Anaerobic biological systems have been employed for treatment of POME, as they have a low energy demand compared to aerobic treatments (J.O.Edewor, J. Chem. Technol. Biotechnol., 26: 212, 1986; W.J. Ng, K.K. Chin and K.K.Wong, Biol. Wastes, 25: 257. 1987; A.M. Ma and A.S.H. Ong, Biol. Wastes, 23: 85, 1988) The use of conventional anaerobic lagoons (K.S. Hum, N.C. Thann and T.L. Lee, Effluent Water Treatment J., 22, 452, 1981; C.K.John, Water Sci. Technol. 17: 781, 1985) or digesters (C.C. Ho and<br><br>
Y.K.Tan, J. Chem. technol. Biotechnol, 25: 155, 1985) to treat POME is characterized by long residence times of the slurry in the reactor, for generally more than 20 days, which requires large areas of land or large digesters. The application of modern anaerobic digesters such as up-flow or down- flow filters; fluidized beds, up-flow anaerobic sludge blankets (UASB) systems or up-flow floe digesters, for the disposal of POME is rare. (R. Borja, C.J. Banks and E. Sanchez, J. Biotech., 45: 125;1996).<br>
Hitherto some of the conventional process parameters employed for anaerobic digestion of different wastes of plant origin have been characterised. (V.C. Kalia and A.P. Joshi, Bioresource Technology, 53 : 165, 1995; V.C. Kalia, D.C. Pant and A.P. Joshi, Proc. R'95 Congress : Recovery, Recycling, Reintegration, Geneva, Vol. IV: 227, 1995; V.C. Kalia, V. Anand, A. Kumar and A.P. Joshi, Proc. R'97 Congress : Recovery, Recycling, Reintegration, Geneva, Vol. I: 200, 1997). For improving the efficiency of biomethanation process, maximum loading rates at shortest retention periods are desired. The digesters for treating POME have employed biomass from anerobic reactor processing wine distillery waste water (R. Borja and C.J. Banks, Biotech. Letts., 15: 761;1993) and brewery waste water as inoculum for treating soft drink waste water (R. Borja and C.J. Banks, Biotech. Letts., 15: 767;1993), however use of cattle dung as inoculum for POME treatment has not been reported. Although, cattle dung as inoculum has been reported for other wastes. ((V.C. Kalia and A.P. Joshi, Bioresource Technology, 53 : 165, 1995; V.C. Kalia, D.C. Pant and A.P. Joshi, Proc. R'95 Congress : Recovery, Recycling, Reintegration, Geneva, Vol. IV: 227, 1995; V.C. Kalia,<br><br>
V. Anand, A. Kumar and A.P. Joshi, Proc. R'97 Congress : Recovery, Recycling, Reintegration, Geneve Vol. I: 200, 1997).<br>
In all the methods so far used for treatment of POME, the major limitations are related to hydraulic retention time (HRT), which has been observed to be 6 to 30 days (T.O.Peyton, I.W. Cooper and S.K. Quah, Proc. 34th Indust. Waste Conf., Purdue Univ., Lafayette. 1979; K.K.Chin, Water Res. 15: 199, 1981, R.G. Cail and J.P. Barford, Biomass, Z: 287,1985).<br>
Another limiting factor for increasing the efficiency have been the various loading rates and influent COD concentration employed for the biodegradation of POME i.e. 6.2 to 18 g/l/day COD and influent COD concentration of 16 g/l. (R.G. Call and J.P. Barford, Biomass, Z: 287, 1985, R. Borja and C.J. Banks, Biomass Bioenergy, 6: 381, 1994, R. Borja, C.J. Banks and E. Sanchez, J. Biotech., 45: 125;1996). Attempts to run the digester at high influent concentration (42.5 g/l COD) have resulted in reactor instability. (R. Borja, C.J. Banks and E. Sanchez, J. Biotech., 45: 125;1996). Although 80% COD was removed in another process, but the loading rates were still very low, i.e., upto 10.6 g/l/day COD (R. Borja and C.J. Banks, Biomass Bioenergy, 5: 381, 1994).<br>
Another limitation is instability of digester at high loading rates, that is the gas production declines within few days. (R. Borja, C.J. Banks and E. Sanchez, J. Biotech., 45: 125;1996).<br>
In the present invention we have over come the major limitations involved in the biomethanation of POME, which obviates the limitations listed above. The novelty of the present invention is in establishing the parameters<br><br>
for high rate biomethanation of palm oil mill effluent, to operate at high influent loading in to the digester at very low hydraulic retention time. In the present invention, bioenergy has been generated from oily industrial effluent of oil mill of Karnataka wherein palm oil have been processed using fruits of palm trees grown in Karnataka. The present invention also uses a simple and cheap source of biodegradable support material for immobilization of enriched methanogens collected from Delhi for effective biomethanation. In the present invention, cattle dung has been used as inoculum source for treating POME.<br>
The main object of present invention is to provide an improved process for the simultaneous production of biogas mainly containing methane and biofertilizer using high rate biomethanation of palm oil mill effluent, obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of present invention is to complete the degradation process with a very low hydraulic retention time (HRT),<br>
Another object of present invention is to generate energy rich clean fuel from renewable resource i.e. waste biomass, in a short period.<br>
Yet another object of present invention is to retain bacterial population for longer time in the bioreactor, for effective biomethanation. This leads to digestion of larger quantites of the feed material.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the simultaneous production of biogas and biofertilizer by high rate biomethanation of palm oil mill effluent, characterized in that the palm oil is treated with acidogenic bacteria and subsequently by methanogenic bacteria in a specific ratio to get high rate biomethanation , which comprising the steps of: i) sieving floating oily and fibrous matter from fresh feed material, Palm Oil Mill Effluent<br>

iii) incubating the mixture obtained as above at a temperature in the range of 35 to 42°C for a period of 3-5 days to obtain acidified slurry, in a conventional manner, iv) subjecting the acidified slurry obtained above in step (iii) to methanogenesis under strict anaerobic conditions in digester by adding 5 to 10% (v/v) of digested cattle dung containing methanogens namely Methane-bacterium suboxydans, methanobacterium formicum, methane-bacterium mobilis.

Details of the invention:<br>
In the present invention anaerobic digestion of POME has been<br>
*•	/*<br>
carried through two-step process. The organic material present in the waste<br>
t<br>
matter is ultimately converted in to methane! and carbon dioxide. The whole process can be carried out initially under microaerophilic conditions in an acidogenic digester and subsequently under strictly anaerobic conditions at neutral pH in the methanogenic digester. Hyrolysis of complex organic matter present in POME and its futher t'ddogenesis is carried out by a consortia of microbes present in fresh cattle dung.'.The fermentation products of partial digestion of waste material i.e., acidogenesis, determines the efficiency of methanogenesis process. In this work the POME slurries were inoculated with fresh cattle dung slurry. Under fermentative conditions, these fermentative bacterial populations produced volatile fatty acids, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, alcohols, etc. These intermediates are then passed on to next digester having methanogens enriched in different manner. Since<br><br>
methanogens are slow growing bacteria, they get drained out at short retention periods. In order to retain bacterial population in the digester, for effective metabolism of volatile fatty acids and other intermediates of methane metabolism, biodegradable support material for example banana leaves were used. The period of optimum biogas evolution helps to determine the period of methanogenesis. A combination of these periods and feed at different concentrations allowed us to establish parameters for effective biodegradation of POME. The major by products of this process, methane and CO2 were recovered and analysed by gas chromatography. The digested slurry is rich in nutrients, particularly nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous, and can be used as soil addendum for improving the quality of soil.<br>
