[Patent 1] Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Hei 11-255165<br>
[Patent 2] Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Hei 5-112270<br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
[Problems to be solved by the Invention]<br>
[0003]<br>
In the above-described prior art, since a battery is housed in a battery case and this battery case is mounted on<br>
a vehicle body frame, a battery case and a fastening tool for fastening this battery case to the vehicle body frame are indispensable. Accordingly, the number of parts are increased, thus increasing not only the cost of manufacturing and the number of processes thereof, increasing also the weight of the vehicle body because of the necessities of a rigid battery case for mounting the battery that is a heavy object, and a stiff connecting member. Hence, a technical problem has lied in the increase of a vehicle weight. /<br>
[4]	<br>
An object of the present invention is to solve the above - described problem of the conventional technology, and to provide an electric powered vehicle the number of parts and the weight of which are restrained from increasing./ [Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
[5]	<br>
In order to achieve the above-described object, as to an electric powered vehicle which runs by causing an electric motor to be operative using a battery, the features of the present invention resides in the steps taken as follows. (1) The electric powered vehicle includes a head pipe on which a handlebar is supported and is freely steerable; a front frame which is provided in a way that it is extended diagonally downward to the backward direction from the head pipe; an intermediate frame which is provided in a way that it is bent at a lower end portion of the front frame and is extended substantially horizontally; a rear frame which is provided in a way that it is connected to the intermediate frame at its end portion, and is extended diagonally upward to the backward direction; a partition plate which is provided in a standing manner, diagonally upward to the backward direction, at a front portion of the intermediate frame; and a battery housing part which is restrained in the longitudinal direction by the partition plate and the rear frame in the intermediate frame.<br>
(2)	The angles of inclination of the partition plate and the<br>
rear frame each of which is inclined to the backward direction<br>
I<br>
are substantially same.<br>
(3)	The angles of inclination of a front face and a back face of the battery in the longitudinal direction are substantially same as the angles of inclination of the partition plate and the rear frame. r<br>
(4)	The partition plate is disposed in a vicinity of a bent portion joining the front frame and the intermediate framed<br>
(5)	The intermediate frame has such a form that it includes a pair of left and right side walls along a direction where the intermediate frame is extended and provided, and the battery housing part is surrounded by the pair of left and right side walls, the partition plate, and an insertion part of the rear frame. [<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
(6)	<br>
The present invention brings about the following effects . (1) According to claim 1, a battery can be mounted in a highly stiff intermediate frame, and since the movement in the longitudinal direction can be restrained by the partition plate and the rear frame, a battery case and a fastening tool which<br>
are rigid to fasten the battery become useless, hence accomplishing the reduction of the number of parts.<br>
(2)	According to claims 2 and 3, the battery whose sectional shape along a long side forms substantially a parallelogram can be housed with a small allowance without loss of easiness of the mounting and removing thereof.<br>
(3)	According to claim 4, since the distance between the partition plate and the rear frame can be made long, the size of a battery to be mounted therein can be made large.<br>
(4)	According to claim 5, since the lateral movement of the battery is restrained by the sidewalls of the intermediate frame, a fastening tool for restraining the lateral movement of the battery becomes unnecessary.<br>
[Best Mode for carrying out the Invention]<br>
[7]	<br>
A preferred embodiment mode of the present invention is described hereinbelow with reference to the drawings. Fig. 1 is a side overall view of a scooter type electric powered motorcycle according to the present invention.<br>
[8]	<br>
A body frame 1 forming a frame of a vehicle is configured by a head pipe 10, a front frame 11 which is extended and provided diagonally downward to the backward direction from the head pipe 10, an intermediate frame 12 which is bent in the backward direction at the bottom end of the front frame 11 and which is substantially horizontally extended and provided in the backward direction, and a rear frame 13 which is passed through the rear end of the intermediate frame 12 and which is extended<br>
and provided diagonally upward to the backward direction. Each of these frames is formed through processing of a highly stiff metal member. A battery package 30, which is described later, is housed in each of the intermediate frame 12 and the front frame 11, and the intermediate frame 12 is covered over that with a step floor 14.<br>
[9]	<br>
A steering unit 2 is supported on the head pipe 10 and is freely steerable thereon. The unit 2 includes a supporting pipe 2a which is supported with the head pipe 10 and is freely turnable, a handlebar pipe 2c which is connected to the top end of the supporting pipe 2a through a handlebar stay 2b, and a handlebar 2d which is provided on the top end of the handlebar pipe 2c. On the handlebar stay 2b, a head lamp 3 is provided at its end thereof, and a horn 6 is provided below. A pair of front forks at left and right sides is connected to a lower portion of the supporting pipe 2a, and on the bottom end of the front forks a front wheel FW is rotatably supported.<br>
[10]	<br>
The rear frame 13 consists mainly of a rear frame body 13a which is an exterior for the rear frame 13, and a rear frame pipe 13b which is passed through the rear frame body 13a and fixed to the interior thereof, an upper portion of the rear frame pipe 13b being exposed above the rear frame body 13a. A seat stay 5 and a rear combination stay 7 are connected to the upper end of the rear frame 13, that is, the exposed portion of the rear frame pipe 13b. A combination lamp 15 to which a brake lamp and a winker lamp are integrally provided is disposed at<br>
the rear end of the rear combination stay 7, and below the combination lamp 15 a number plate holder is proviqfed. [0011]<br>
The seat stay 5 consists mainly of a seat post 5a, a fastening tool 5b which is integrated with this seat post 5a and which fastens the seat post 5a to the exposed portion of the rear frame pipe 13b, and a ring-shaped helmet holder 5d which is fixed to an upper portion of the seat post 5a with a connecting stay 5c and which is extended in the backward direction. On an upper portion of the seat stay 5, a mounted seat 8 is supported, which is caused to freely open and close with a supporting part 21 at the rear end of the helmet holder 5d. Inside the connecting stay 5c, a plug 22 is housed, which is to take an external electric source in to charge the battery package 30, along with its extension cord 23. Inside the helmet holder 5d, a helmet 9 is placed upside down. [0012]<br>
In the present embodiment mode, the stiffnesses of the seat stay 5 and its fastening tool 5b are highly set and the seat post 5a is firmly fastened to the rear frame 13 with the fastening tool 5b, such that almost all the load that acts on the seat stay 5 through the mounted seat 8 is supported by the rear frame 13 through its fastening tool 5b. [0013]<br>
A swing unit 17, which houses an electric motor and serves as a power source that drives a rear wheel RW, is freely swingably connected to and supported on the rear end of the intermediate frame 12 via a linkage member 24. An upper portion of the swing<br>
unit 17 is connected to an upper portion of the rear frame body 13a via a rear suspension 18^<br><br>
Fig. 2 is a side view of the rear combination stay 7, and Fig. 3 is a top view thereof. In the present embodiment mode, since almost all the load that acts on the seat stay 5 is supported on the rear frame 13 with the fastening tool 5b, it is made possible to cause a load that acts on the rear combination stay 7 to be small. Accordingly, unlike the frame members 11, 12, 13 and the seat stay 5 which are required to be highly stiff, the rear combination stay 7 is formed by a light weight member made of resin or of aluminum.<br>
[15]	<br>
At the front end of the rear combination stay 7, an insertion supporting part 7a, which directs diagonally downward to the front direction, is formed, and a holder 7b where the combination lamp 15 is fastened is formed at the rear end of the rear combination stay 7 . Furthermore, on the upper surface of the rear combination stay 7, a supporting part 7c, which is connected to the rear end of the seat stay 5 and which directs diagonally upward to the backward direction, and which is curved and mounted in a standing manner. On the lower surface of the rear combination stay 7, a supporting stay 7d is provided. As shown in Fig. 1, the rear combination stay 7 is connected to the rear frame 13 in such a manner that the insertion supporting part 7a provided at the front end of the rear combination stay 7 is inserted into an upper opening of the rear frame pipe 13b, and further the supporting stay 7d is fastened to the fastening<br>
tool 5b through screwing thereinto and is connected t the rear frame 13. [0016]<br>
Fig. 10 is a sectional view of the insertion supporting part 7a taken along the line C-C in Fig. 2, where it is shown that a plurality of ribs 71, 72 and 73 are so formed that these ribs are orthogonal one another. As shown in Fig. 11, inside the upper end of the rear frame pipe 13b, there is inserted and fixed a boss 74 on which grooves 81 and 82 are formed, the plurality of ribs 71,72 and 73 fitting into the grooves 81 and 82. The respective ribs 71, 72 and 73 of the insertion supporting part 7a and the respective grooves 81 and 82 function as a positioning tool to set a relationship for the relative position between the rear combination stay 7 and the rear frame 13; by inserting the insertion supporting part 7a into the upper end of the rear frame pipe 13b in such a way that the ribs 71, 72, and 73 are engaged with each grove 81, 82 of the boss 74 and the rear combination stay 7 can be provided by extending itself into the regular direction from the rear frame pipe 13b. [<br>
[17]	<br>
Fig. 4 is a side view of the battery package 30 which is housed in each of the front frame 11 and the intermediate frame 12. Fig. 5 is a sectional view taken along the line A-A in Fig. 4. In the present embodiment mode, for the sake of versatility thereof, the same battery packages 3 0 are housed in the frames 11 and 12 respectively./<br>
[18]	<br>
The battery package 30 is configured in a manner that a<br>
plurality of Ni-MH battery cells 31 are stacked with two tiers, and are shrink packed in a way that a sectional shape thereof along a long side forms substantially a parallelogram//The exterior portion thereof is protected by a plurality of rubber-made sheets 32. In each of the spaces between the respective battery cells 31, a thermistor 33 serving as a temperature sensor and a temperature fuse 34 are housed, and the wire lead of every thermistor 33 is connected to an external device through a connector 38. The positive and negative electric source lines of the battery cells connected in series are externally led out through a connector 39.<br>
[19]	<br>
Fig. 6 is a perspective view of the body frame 1 viewed from a point in space located diagonally upward to the left, and the same reference numerals in Figs. 6 denote the components same as or equivalent to those in other figures.<br>
[20]	<br>
Each of the front frame 11 and the intermediate frame 12 has a form where sidewalls are formed on the frame in a standing manner along both sides thereof in the longitudinal direction (traveling direction of the vehicle); and exterior walls 11a, lib and 12a, 12b are formed in a standing manner on the front frame 11 and the intermediate frame 12, respectively. Furthermore, on the intermediate frame 12, interior walls 12c, 12d are formed inside the exterior walls 12a, 12b, in a standing manner. The external walls 11a, lib of the front frame 11 are continuous to the internal walls 12c, 12d of the intermediate frame 12 . On the external surface of the external wall 12a (12b) ,<br>
screw receivers 48, 49 into which the step floor 14 is screwed and fastened are provided in a position inclined diagonally backward, in a manner similar to the rear frame 13. [0021]<br>
The battery package 30 is housed in a battery housing part 50 interposed between the pair of interior walls 12c, 12d of the intermediate frame 12 . In a left housing part 51 interposed between the exterior wall 12a and the interior wall 12c, small parts that includes a winker relay 41 and a battery coupler 42, and a fuse box 43 are housed. In a right housing part 52 interposed between the exterior wall 12b and the interior wall 12d, a coupler 44 and a blade fuse case 45 are housed. The rear frame 13 is inserted into and fixed to a rear portion of the battery housing part 50. In addition, the battery package 30 is housed also on the front frame 11 in a battery housing part interposed between the exterior walls 11a and lib thereof. [0022]<br>
Fig. 7 is a perspective projection view of the intermediate frame 12, viewed down over the step floor 14 from a point in space located upward and along a visual line in parallel with the rear frame 13. Fig. 8 is a sectional view taken along the line B-B in Fig. 7. Here, the battery package 30 to be housed in the intermediate frame 12, the drawings of various kinds of relays, couplers and the like are omitted. [0023]<br>
At the bottoms of the battery housing part 50, the left housing part 51 and the right housing part 52, heat radiation holes 50a, 51a and 52a are provided as shown in Fig. 8. As shown<br>
in Fig. 7, a partition plate 61 is formed diagonally upward to the backward direction in a standing manner in the battery housing part 50 interposed between the interior walls 12c and 12d of the intermediate frame 12. The angle of inclination of the partition plate 61 is substantially the same as that of the rear frame 13. The partition plate 61, as magnified in Fig. 9, is disposed in the vicinity of a bent portion joining the front frame 11 and the intermediate frame 12. In addition, in the present embodiment mode, although the description has been made with regard to an example represented by the structure where the heat radiation holes 50a, 51a and 52a are provided at the bottom of the intermediate frame 12, alternatively, a ship-bottom-shaped frame with no hole at its bottom may be adopted. [0024]<br>
The space between the partition plate 61 and the rear frame 13 is defined according to the width of the battery package 30 in the longitudinal direction. The angle of inclination of the partition plate 61 substantially coincides with that 9 for the front surface and back surface of the battery package 30 with respect to the longitudinal direction (see Fig. 4) . As a consequence, in the present embodiment mode, the battery package 30 is positioned in the battery housing part 50 with respect to its right and left directions using the interior walls 12c and 12d, and is positioned with respect to the longitudinal direction using the partition plate 61 and the rear frame 13, so that it is housed with a small allowance . Therefore, a battery package that is a heavy object can be mounted on the<br>
intermediate frame which is originally intended to have a high stiffness, and a solid battery case housing a battery package and a fastening tool become useless.<br>
[25]	<br>
The mounting and demounting of the battery package 30 are achieved through inserting and detaching thereof in the inclined direction where the partition plate 61 and the rear frame 13 are made inclined. The partition plate 61, as shown in Fig. 9, serves as a supporting portion to prop up a second battery package 30 which is housed in the front frame 11. Therefore, there is also no need for a fastening tool and a solid battery case which houses the second battery package to be housed in the above - described frame.
