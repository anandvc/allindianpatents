				<td>Description<br>
Planar component with a vent<br>
The invention relates to a planar component which is<br>
formed as a door or wall element or a switCh cabinet or<br>
control panel of an electrical switching system fitted<br>
with devices that generate heat and has a number of<br>
parallel slit-shaped vents for supplying cooling air<br>
which are dimensioned such that foreign bodies of a<br>
size of 1 mm or more cannot enter.<br>
A component of the said type is disclosed by DE<br>
43 39 383 Al. This discusses in detail the<br>
difficulties of combining an adequate cooling effect<br>
with high requirements for protection from the<br>
penetration of foreign bodies in accordance with<br>
protection class IP4 (or now IP4X). On the basis of an<br>
earlier solution, that of placing a wire mesh behind<br>
vents, the arrangement behind the venting slits of a<br>
covering part formed as a plastic injection molding is<br>
described. This arrangement is based on the idea that<br>
vents can only be cost-effectively produced in metal (<br>
sheets of a thickness suitable for switching systems up<br>
to a protection class of IP3X. From a material<br>
thickness greater than 1.5 mm the, customary working<br>
methods, such as for example stamping, are top .complex<br>
in production engineering terms for a protection class <br>
such as IP4X, with openings of less than 1 mm.<br><br>
The object of the present invention is to take a <br>
component corresponding to DE 43 39 383 Al as a basis<br>
for providing a component which has a slit-shaped vent<br>
for supplying cooling air that can be produced with<br>
only  a  low  level  of  complexity  in  producticr.<br>
engineering  terms  and  with  little  expenditure  of<br>
material,<br><br>
but at the same time fully allows for the technical<br>
requirements, that is good through-ventilation and<br>
foreign body protection against foreign bodies which<br>
are of a size of 1 mm or more.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by<br>
the slit-shaped vents being formed by webs which are<br>
produced by means of deformation, protrude from the<br>
plane of the component by no more than 1 mm and in<br>
tReTr longitudinal direction form a slit-shaped opening<br>
on both sides. Deformation is understood in the<br>
present context as meaning all suitable shaping methods<br>
of working, for example in the case of metal sheets the<br>
known" cutting-stamping methods and in the case of<br>
plastics the processing by the injection-molding method<br>
or, on the basis of planar plastic sheets, cutting and<br>
stamping with or without application of heat.<br>
For the invention it is essential that the stamped-out,<br>
raised webs together form an adequate vent in spite of<br>
their small distance from the plane of the component.<br>
In this respect, the number of webs, and consequently<br>
the number of vents, is dependent on the air-throughput<br>
recruirements. It is therefore expedient respectively<br>
Co arrange a number of webs in a group of webs, and,<br>
depending on the required air throughput, a number of<br>
groups of webs may be provided next to one another and<br>
above one another in a suitable configuration. It has<br>
proven to be advantageous in particular if a number of<br>
groups of webs are arranged in the component in a<br>
linear row.<br>
If the width of the webs and the distance between the<br>
webs is chosen to be as small as possible in production<br>
"engineering terms, a ratio 61 venting cross section to<br>
the overall surface area of the<br><br>
component of approximately 50% can be achieved.<br>
The arrangement of the webs, and consequently of the<br>
vents, is possible both horizontally and vertically.<br>
The solution according to the invention provides one<br>
piece components which can be used as a door or housing<br>
wall, allow protection class IPX4 to be attained<br>
{foreign body protection equal to or greater than 1 mm)<br>
and, unlike vents with a wire mesh, cannot be<br>
penetrated by a sharp object. Nevertheless, a<br>
similarly large passing-through area as in the case of<br>
a wire mesh is achieved.<br>
DE 32 14 823 Al already discloses in the case of a<br>
ventilation grille for device housings intended for<br>
receiving electronic subassemblies the idea of pushing<br>
strips bounded by slits out of a plate parallel to the<br>
plane of the plate. These venting slits are made in a<br>
plate provided with ribs by the ribs and venting slits<br>
alternating with one another. The strips or webs are<br>
lifted out of the plane of the plate by 4 mm. As a<br>
result, the known ventilation grille obviously cannot<br>
be used for power engineering switch cabinets and<br>
switching systems, since protection from the<br>
penetration of foreign bodies of a size greater than<br>
1 mm is not ensured.<br>
For better understanding, the invention is to be<br>
explained in more detail below on the basis of a<br>
preferred exemplary embodiment, not restricting the<br>
extent of protection.<br>
Figure 1 shows a group of webs according to the present<br>
invention in a component which can be used as a door or<br>
housing wall.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows a sectional representation of a web<br>
according to the present invention along the line II-II<br>
in Figure 1.<br>
Figure 3 shows a first possible embodiment	of the<br>
arrangement of groups of webs according to the	present<br>
invention in a component which can be used as a	door or<br>
housing wall.<br>
Figure 4 shows a further possible embodiment	of the<br>
arrangement of groups of webs according to the	present<br>
invention in a component provided as a door or	housing<br>
wall.<br>
Figure 1 shows a group of webs 1 according to the<br>
present invention in a component 2, which can be used<br>
as a door or as a housing wall of a switch cabinet or<br>
control panel of a switching system. The webs 3 oXJthe<br>
group of webs 1 are produced by local deformation of<br>
the Component 2 in the manner of stamping in such a way<br>
that there is an open slit 4; 5 on each of both sides<br>
in the longitudinal direction. In this case, the width<br>
B of the web 3 and the distance A between the webs 3 is<br>
chosen to be as small as possible in production<br>
engineering terms. As a result, a ratio of venting<br>
cross section to used surface area of the component 2<br>
(door or housing wall) of approximately 50% can be<br>
achieved.<br>
Figure 2 shows a sectional representation of a web<br>
according to the present invention along the line II-II<br>
in Figure 1. The web 3 has been pressed out (stamped)<br>
from the component 2 by the height H. This height H,<br>
which defines the size of the vent, is fixed on both<br>
sides of the webs 3 by the height of the deformation<br>
less the material thickness D.<br><br>
Figure 3 shows a first possible embodiment of an<br>
arrangement 6 of groups of webs according to the<br>
present invention in a component 2. The number of<br>
groups of webs 1 is dependent on the required air<br>
throughput. In the present example, a total of twelve<br>
groups of webs 1 are arranged in an arrangement of four<br>
groups of webs 1 next to one another and three groups<br>
of webs 1 above one another. The webs 3 are in this<br>
case arranged horizontally.<br>
Figure 4 shows a further possible embodiment of an<br>
arrangement 7 of groups of webs according to the<br>
present invention in a component 2. Here, too, it is<br>
the case that the number of groups of webs 1 is<br>
determined by the required air throughput. In this<br>
example also, a total of twelve groups of webs 1 are<br>
arranged in an arrangement of four groups of webs 1<br>
next to one another and three groups of webs 1 above<br>
one another. However, the webs 1 are in this case<br>
arranged vertically.<br>
Apart from the type of construction, which is simple in<br>
production engineering terms and saves material, the<br>
advantages of the solution according to the invention<br>
are in particular that this type of production is not<br>
restricted by the material thickness, as in the case of<br>
stamping, and that no additional parts are required.<br>
Furthermore, direct penetration of the component at<br>
right angles is not possible, because an attack<br>
occurring in this direction, for example by an<br>
accidental arc or a tool or foreign body, is<br>
effectively repelled by the webs.<br><br>
