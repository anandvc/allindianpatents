				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention is a process of preparation of a freeze dried ready to reconstitute, shelf stable rabri powder having good quality characteristics in terms of microbiological, chemical and sensory attributes. Developed freeze dried rabri powder was stable under ambient temperature conditions.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Patent search revealed that few patents on condensed milk product, milk concentrate, milk powders and solid milk product have been granted. However, not a single patent has been granted for rabri.<br>
A process has been patented (US Patent No: 4,362,756) by Williams (1982) for preparing a brown sugar sweetened condensed milk. Another US patent (US Patent No: 4,948,616) disclosed a sweetened condensed milk composition comprising palatinose and palatinose syrup (Iijima et al., 1990). A process for preparing reduced fat and fat free sweetened condensed milk has been described by Streiff et al, 1998 (US Patent No: 5,766,666).<br>
Some patents have also been granted for development of processes for preparation of various kinds of milk powders. Mourney: et.al (1965) prepared milk powder that is instantly miscible in water (US Patent No: 3199985). Bodenstab (2004) has patented (US Patent No; 6,780,450) a process for the production of a fat containing milk powder by preparing a liquid milk. Korte et al (1995) developed a calcium fortified powdered milk product with improved dispersibility in aqueous media (US Patent No: 5,397,589). US Patent No: 5,518,751 described, a process for the preparation of milk and milk powders having a long storage life utilizing<br>
techniques which are known perse (De Boee et al,  1996). Evaporated milk of improved colour and flavour was made by Wilcox et.al (1958) by high temperature short time sterilization (US Patent No: 2860057).<br>
Bohren et al, (1989) described product and process for the production of a milk powder having lactose in essentially crystallized form from 20 to 30% fats by weight of dry matter. Out of which 20% to 90% are in the free state and is produced by seeding a material of lactic origin with fine lactose crystals to initiate crystallization of lactose (US Patent No: 4,871,573). US Patent No. 2,663,642 by Whitaker et al (1953) revealed the process of concentrating fluid milk and to a fluid concentrated milk which is reconstitutable with water to its original volume to produce a fluid milk fully comparable and in most instances substantially indistinguishable in flavour from original milk. Chevalley et al (1978) prepared a forming mixture containing milk, sugar and optionally cocoa, drying the mixture at reduced pressure (US Patent No: 4084011).<br>
Some other sweet dairy products have also been patented. A high protein, sweetened, low fat, reduced lactose dairy product that does not require refrigeration has been developed by Stevens et al, 1989 (US Patent No: 4,853,246). Book waiter et al, (1989) formulated a milk concentrate that can either be frozen for later use or immediately blended with water to produce a beverage (US Patent No. 4,842, 884). Invention by Smith (2003) provides a method of preparing a solid milk product having a moisture level of less than about 40% and fat/protein ratio of less than about 2-5 and preferably a moisture level of about 10 to 30% and a fat/protein ratio of less than about 2 (US Patent No: 6,667,068).<br>
Kent et al, 2005, developed dairy products with reduced average particle size. The dairy products of this invention have average fat particle sizes of less than about 0.8 microns, preferably of about 0.1 to about 0.8 microns and more preferably about 0.2 to about 0.6 microns (US Patent No: 6,861, 080).<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a process for the preparation of ready to reconstitute rabri powder.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a process for the preparation of ready to reconstitute rabri powder which optimizes the processing conditions of freeze dried rabri powder.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a process for the preparation of ready to reconstitute rabri powder which standardizes the formulation of additives and functional ingredients.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a process for the preparation of ready to reconstitute rabri powder which establish as HACCP protocols in establishing microbiological quality during processing and storage of the product.<br>
A further object of this invention is to propose a process for the preparation of ready to reconstitute rabri powder which establishes the shelf-life of product at ambient temperature conditions by evaluating chemical, microbiological and sensory attributes.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for the preparation of ready to reconstitute rabri powder which comprises in the steps of:<br>
i)        concentrating milk to obtain concentrated milk, ii)       adding sterilized sugar to the concentrated milk and cooling to room temperature,<br>
7<br>
iii)      subjecting the cooled milk containing sterilized sugar to the step of blast freezing followed by freeze drying to obtain freeze dried rabri.<br>
Milk containing for example 3.5% fat, 8.5% SNF was procured from the local dairy and transferred hygienically to a steam kettle and concentrated for a period of three hours to obtain of concentrated milk.<br>
Sugar was sterilized at 85-90°C for 2-3 hr in hot air oven by spreading the sugar in thin layer into trays. Concentrated milk was cooled to room temperature and sterilized sugar was incorporated and stirred well to obtain a brix of 39°-40° Brix.<br>
The product was distributed equally in trays loaded to blast freezer for freezing. Freezing was done at -50°C for 3 hrs. The product after 3-4 hrs of freezing was subjected for freeze dehydration in a freeze dehydration in a freeze drier maintaining condenser temperature -60 to 65°C and a vaccum of 100-150|J. The drying temperature throughout the operation was maintained at 50-60°C for a period of 20-25 hrs.<br>
Functional ingredient like almond and pistachio were decontaminated by washing with 80-85% alcohol. The decontaminated nuts were cut into smaller pieces to give a mouth feel and incorporated in the freeze dried product at the optimized level of 3.8-4%.<br>
The product was taken out from the freeze drier after the completion of the process to a dehumidified room where relative humidity was maintained as 20-30% and temperature 20-30°C. The product was powdered and packed polyethylene with 45 GSM paper/20 microns.<br>
WORKING EXAMPLE FOR THE PREPARATION OF 4.56 kg FREEZE DRIED RABRI POWDER<br>
(1)	30 litres of milk were procured locally and transferred hygienically to steam kettle of capacity 50 litre.<br>
(2)	Milk was boiled with continuous stirring for 3 hrs to obtain 10 kg of concentrated milk (3:1).<br>
(3)	1 kg of cleaned sugar was sterilized at 90°C for 3 hrs in a hot air oven.<br>
(4)	1   kg of sterilized  sugar was  incorporated  in   10  litre  of cooled concentrated milk to obtain a brix of 39°.<br>
(5)	11 kg of product distributed equally in 5 trays (2.2 kg each) and subjected for blast freezing at -50°C for 3 hrs.<br>
(6)	Freeze dehydration of the frozen product was carried out at conditions like condenser temperature -60°C, vacuum lOOp, platen temperature 60°C and time for dehydration 20 hrs to get a product having residual moisture of 2.45%.<br>
(7)	91.2 g of each functional ingredient i.e., almond and pistachio were decontaminated by washing with 80% of 250ml alcohol and cut into small pieces for incorporation into freeze dried rabri powder.<br>
(8)	4.56 kg of freeze dried rabri was powdered in a dehumidified room (20% RH, 25°C) and packed in PFP pouches of size 12cm x 15cm. In each pouch 46 g rabri powder and 2g each of functional ingredients almond and pistachio were added and then hermetically sealed.<br>
(9)	Individual packets were subjected for storage evaluation in terms of microbiological, chemical and sensory characteristics at ambient temperature (25 +5°C, 60-80% RH) at an interval of one month to establish the shelf stability.<br>
Further objects and advantages will be more apparent from the following flow chart.<br>
