				<td>A LAUNDRY DETERGENT COMPOSITION COMPRISING GLYCOSYL HYDROLASE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a laundry detergent composition comprising glycosyl hydrolase. The compositions of the present invention also comprises a polymer that, when used in combination with the glycosyl hydrolase, enables compaction of the surfactant system to be achieved without loss in fabric cleaning performance. Preferably, the composition of the present invention comprises a combination of two polymers, a glycosyl hydrolase and detersive surfactant, preferably low levels of detersive surfactant.<br>
Most preferably, the laundry detergent composition of the present invention comprise: (i) a glycosyl hydrolase having enzymatic activity towards both xyloglucan and amorphous cellulose substrates, wherein the glycosyl hydrolase is selected from GH families 5,12, 44 or 74; (ii) detersive surfactant; (iii) amphiphilic alkoxylated grease cleaning polymer; (iv) a random graft co-polymer comprising: (a) hydrophilic backbone comprising monomers selected from the group consisting of: unsaturated C1-C6 carboxylic acids, ethers, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, sugar units, alkoxy units, maleic anhydride, saturated polyalcohols such as glycerol, and mixtures thereof; and (b) hydrophobic side chain(s) selected from the group consisting of: C4-C25 alkyl group, polypropylene, polybutylene, vinyl ester of a saturated C1-C6 mono-carboxylic acid, C1-C6 alkyl ester of acrylic or methacrylic acid, and mixtures thereof; and (v) a compound having the following general structure: bis((C2H5O)(C2H4O)n)(CH3)-N+-CxH2x-N+-(CH3)-bis((C2H5O)(C2H4O)n), wherein n = from 20 to 30, and x = from 3 to 8, or sulphated or sulphonated variants thereof. Most preferably the composition is in the form of a liquid.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Detergent manufacturers incorporate enzymes into their laundry detergent products to improve their performance. Examples of such laundry detergent compositions are described in WO98/50513, WO99/09126, WO99/09127, WO00/42157, WO00/42146 and WO01/62885.<br>
Enzymes, being a catalytic detergent ingredient, are preferably incorporated into laundry<br>
detergent products to replace existing non-catalytic detergent ingredients. Detergent manufactures seek to formulate their laundry detergent products such that the optimal performance of enzymatic activity is achieved and that allows the reduction in the levels of other detergent<br>
ingredients and compaction of the laundry detergent product. Prior to the present invention, there was a long felt need for catalytic technologies, and especially enzymatic systems, that enable the compaction of the surfactant levels, especially in liquid laundry detergent compositions. Such compacted liquid laundry products exhibit improved environmental profiles, improved efficiency in manufacture, transport and shelf storage.<br>
The inventors have found mat the incorporation of certain glycosyl hydrolases into laundry detergent compositions, especially liquid laundry detergent compositions, that additionally comprise a specific polymer system enables the laundry detergent manufacturer to reduce the detersive surfactant levels in the laundry detergent composition. These glycosyl hydrolases have enzymatic activity towards both xyloglucan and amorphous cellulose substrates. In addition, these glycosyl hydrolases are selected from GH families 5,12, 44 or 74. The glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family definition is described in more detail in Biochem J. 1991, v280, 309-316.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, the Inventors believe that the broad substrate specificity of these glycosyl hydrolases provides multiple benefits during the laundering process. The Inventors believe that the specific polymer system exhibits a soil remove and soil suspension profile such that improves the access of certain glycosyl hydrolases to the fabric surface. In addition, the Inventors believe the specific polymer system improves the stability of certain glycosyl hydrolases.<br>
The Inventors believe mat these certain glycosyl hydrolases biopolish the fabric surface of key soil binding sites such as amorphous cellulose and residual xyloglucan, leading to a more open fibre pore structure. It is believed that this mechanism provides good cotton soil removal, cotton soil release and whiteness maintenance performance. It is believed that mis effect on fibre morphology improves the optical effects of brighteners and hueing technology, when present in <br>
the laundry detergent composition. The multiple activities of these enzymes towards cellulose and xyloglucan may also contribute to me robustness of overall soil release/removal benefits achieved compared to conventional enzymes having only cellulase activity.<br>
The Inventors have observed significant improvement in the cotton soil release profile, whiteness maintenance profile and dingy cleaning performance of these glycosyl hydrolases when they are formulated in combination with a specific polymer system. Furthermore, diese glycosyl hydrolases exhibit good stability profiles in liquid laundry detergent compositions when formulated in combination with the specific polymer system. The specific polymer system is described in more detail below but preferably the polymer system is at least a dual polymer<br>
system comprising two polymers, and is even more preferably at least a ternary polymer system comprising three polymers.<br>

Enzymatic activity towards xvloglucan substrates<br>
An enzyme is deemed to have activity towards xyloglucan if the pure enzyme has a specific activity of greater than 50000 XyloU/g according to the following assay at pH 7.5.<br>
The xyloglucanase activity is measured using AZCL-xyloglucan from Megazyme, Ireland as substrate (blue substrate).<br>
A solution of 0.2% of the blue substrate is suspended in a 0.1M phosphate buffer pH 7.5, 20°C under stirring in a 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes (0.75ml to each), 50 microlitres enzyme solution is added and they are incubated in an Eppendorf Thermomixer for 20 minutes at 40°C, with a mixing of 1200 rpm. After incubation the coloured solution is separated from the solid by 4 minutes centrifugation at 14,000 rpm and the absorbance of the supernatant is measured at 600nm in a 1cm cuvette using a spectrophotometer. One XyloU unit is defined as the amount of enzyme resulting in an absorbance of 0.24 in a 1cm cuvette at 600nm.<br>
Only absorbance values between 0.1 and 0.8 are used to calculate the XyloU activity. If an absorbance value is measured outside this range, optimization of the starting enzyme concentration should be carried out accordingly.<br>
Enzymatic activity towards amorphous cellulose substrates<br>
An enzyme is deemed to have activity towards amorphous cellulose if the pure enzyme has a specific activity of greater than 20000 EBG/g according to the following assay at pH 7.5. Chemicals used as buffers and substrates were commercial products of at least reagent grade.<br>
Endoglucanase Activity Assay Materials:<br>
0.1M phosphate buffer pH 7.5<br>
Cellazyme C tablets, supplied by Megazyme International, Ireland.<br>
Glass microfiber filters, GF/C, 9cm diameter, supplied by Whatman.<br>
Method:<br>
In test tubes, mix 1ml pH 7,5 buffer and 5ml deionised water.<br>
Add 100 microliter of the enzyme sample (or of dilutions of the enzyme sample with known<br>
weight:weight dilution factor). Add 1 Cellazyme C tablet into each tube, cap the tubes and mix<br>
on a vortex mixer for 10 seconds. Place the tubes in a thermostated water bath, temperature 40°C.<br>
After 15,30 and 45 minutes, mix the contents of the tubes by inverting the tubes, and replace in<br>
the water bath. After 60 minutes, mix the contents of the tubes by inversion and then filter<br>
through a GF/C filter. Collect the filtrate in a clean tube.<br>
Measure Absorbance (Aenz) at 590nm, with a spectrophotometer. A blank value, Awater, is<br>
determined by adding lOOul water instead of 100 microliter enzyme dilution.<br>
Calculate Adelta = Aenz - Awater.<br>
Adelta must be 
Determine DFO.l, where DFO.l is the dilution factor needed to give Adelta = 0.1.<br>
Unit Definition: 1 Endo-Beta-Glucanase activity unit (1 EBG) is the amount of enzyme mat gives Adelta = 0.10, under the assay conditions specified above. Thus, for example, if a given enzyme sample, after dilution by a dilution factor of 100, gives Adelta= 0.10, then the enzyme sample has an activity of 100 EBG/g.<br>

Specific embodiments of the alkoxylated polyalkylenimines according to the present invention have a minimum ratio of polyethylene blocks to polypropylene blocks (n/p) of about 0.6 and a maximum of about 1.5(x+2y+l)1/2. Alkoxykated polyalkyenimines having an n/p ratio of from about 0.8 to about 1.2(x+2y+l)1/2 have been found to have especially beneficial properties.<br>
The alkoxylated polyalkylenimines according to the present invention have a backbone which consists of primary, secondary and tertiary amine nitrogen atoms which are attached to one another by alkylene radicals A and are randomly arranged. Primary amino moieties which start or terminate the main chain and the side chains of the polyalkylenimine backbone and whose remaining hydrogen atoms are subsequently replaced by alkylenoxy units are referred to as repeating units of formulae (I) or (IV), respectively. Secondary amino moieties whose remaining hydrogen atom is subsequently replaced by alkylenoxy units are referred to as repeating units of formula (II). Tertiary amino moieties which branch the main chain and the side chains are referred to as repeating units of formula (III).<br>
Since cyclization can occur in the formation of the polyalkylenimine backbone, it is also possible for cyclic amino moieties to be present to a small extent in the backbone. Such polyalkylenimines containing cyclic amino moieties are of course alkoxylated in the same way as those consisting of the noncyclic primary and secondary amino moieties.<br>
The polyalkylenimine backbone consisting of the nitrogen atoms and the groups A1, has an average molecular weight Mw of from about 60 to about 10,000 g/mole, preferably from about 100 to about 8,000 g/mole and more preferably from about 500 to about 6,000 g/mole.<br>
The sum (x+2y+l) corresponds to the total number of alkylenimine units present in one individual polyalkylenimine backbone and thus is directly related to the molecular weight of the polyalkylenimine backbone. The values given in the specification however relate to the number average of all polyalkylenimines present in the mixture. The sum (x+2y+2) corresponds to the total number amino groups present in one individual polyalkylenimine backbone.<br>
The radicals A1 connecting the amino nitrogen atoms may be identical or different, linear or branched C2-C6-alkylene radicals, such as 1,2-ethylene, 1,2-propylene, 1,2-butylene, 1,2-isobutylene,l,2-pentanediyl, 1,2-hexanediyl or hexamethylen. A preferred branched alkylene is 1,2-propylene. Preferred linear alkylene are ethylene and hexamethylene. A more preferred alkylene is 1,2-ethylene.<br>
The hydrogen atoms of the primary and secondary amino groups of the polyalkylenimine backbone are replaced by alkylenoxy units of the formula (V).<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
In this formula, the variables preferably have one of the meanings given below: A2 in each case is selected from 1,2-propylene, 1,2-butylene and 1,2-isobutylene; preferably A2 is 1,2-propylene. A3 is 1,2-propylene; R in each case is selected from hydrogen and C1-C4-alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl and tert.-butyl; preferably R is hydrogen. The index m in each case has a value of 0 to about 2; preferably m is 0 or approximately 1; more preferably m is 0. The index n has an average value in the range of from about 20 to about 50, preferably in the range of from about 22 to about 40, and more preferably in the range of from about 24 to about 30. The index p has an average value in the range of from about 10 to about 50, preferably in the range of from about 11 to about 40, and more preferably in the range of from about 12 to about 30.<br>
Preferably the alkylenoxy unit of formula (V) is a non-random sequence of alkoxylate blocks. By non-random sequence it is meant that the [-A2-O-]m is added first (i.e., closest to the bond to the nitrgen atom of the repeating unit of formula (I), (II), or (III)), the [-CH2-CH2-O-]n is added second, and the [-A3-O-]p is added mird.  This orientation provides the<br>
alkoxylated polyalkylenimine with an inner polyethylene oxide block and an outer polypropylene oxide block.<br>
The substantial part of these alkylenoxy units of formula (V) is formed by the ethylenoxy units -[CH2-CH2-O)]n- and the propylenoxy units -[CH2-CH2(CH3)-O]p-. The alkylenoxy units may additionally also have a small proportion of propylenoxy or butylenoxy units -[A2-O]m-, i.e. the polyalkylenimine backbone saturated with hydrogen atoms may be reacted initially with small amounts of up to about 2 mol, especially from about 0.5 to about 1.5 mol, in particular from about 0.8 to about 1.2 mol, of propylene oxide or butylene oxide per mole of NH- moieties present, i.e. incipiently alkoxylated.<br>
This initial modification of the polyalkylenimine backbone allows, if necessary, the viscosity of the reaction mixture in the alkoxylation to be lowered. However, the modification generally does not influence the performance properties of the alkoxylated polyalkylenimine and therefore does not constitute a preferred measure.<br>
The amphiphilic alkoxylated grease cleaning polymers are present in the detergent and cleaning compositions of the present invention at levels ranging from about 0.05% to 10% by weight of the composition. Embodiments of the compositions may comprise from about 0.1% to about 5% by weight. More specifically, the embodiments may comprise from about 0.25 to about 2.5% of the grease cleaning polymer.<br>

The composition may comprise from 2% to 6% detersive surfactant. The composition preferably comprises detersive surfactant in an amount to provide from 100ppm to 5,000ppm detersive surfactant in the wash liquor during the laundering process. This is especially preferred when from lOg to 125g of liquid laundry detergent composition is dosed into the wash liquor during the laundering process. The composition upon contact with water typically forms a wash liquor comprising from 0.5g/l to 10g/l detergent composition.<br>
