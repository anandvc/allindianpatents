				<td>DISPENSER WITH A COVER<br>
BACKGROUND OP THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a dispenser with a cover for transferring or painting a transfer tape or the like having a coat for correcting, adhering or marking (highlighting) use onto the surface to be transferred, the applicator tip of the dispenser being provided with a protective cover.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Among known conventional dispensers having a cover of such a type, there is a coating applicator describedin Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 11-78381 for instance.<br>
In the coating applicator described in tne above publication, a slide cover is slidably disposed at an opening of the coating applicator container for exposing the transfer head of the applicator so that the transfer head can be exposed or concealed as desired. Apair of engaging pieces are provided at the rear end of the slide cover. A slidable engaging projection at the tip of each engaging piece is guided along a sliding groove provided on the inner wall of the coating applicator container, and an auxiliary projection positioned at and protruding from the root of each engaging piece on its rear end edge is pressed against and engaged with the inner wall of the coating applicator container.<br><br>
When the applicator tip portion is not to be used, the slide cover can be drawn out from within the coating applicator container to slide the slidable engaging projection toward the front end of the sliding groove and thereby to enable the slide cover to protect the applicator tip portion.<br>
SUMMARY Off THE INVENTION<br>
However, the coating applicator described in the publication involves a problem that the overall length of the coating applicator is extended and the applicator cannot be kept compact because it requires a stroke in the lengthwise direction to allow the slide cover to slide.<br>
An object of the present invention, attempted in view of this problem, is to provide a dispenser with a cover whose overall size can be kept compact and which is provided with a cover to protect its applicator tip when the dispenser is not in use. Another objeot of the invention is to provide a dispenser with a cover whose applicator tip aan be conveniently used when the applicator tip is allowed to be exposed by the opened cover.<br>
In order to achieve the objects stated above, a dispenser with a cover according to the Invention comprises a body, an applicator tip protruding from an aperture at a forward end of the body, and a cover for protecting the applicator tip when it is not in use.<br>
The cover is fitted to the body to be rot at able around an axis orthogonal to the longitudinal direction of the body.<br><br>
and can turn between a first position in which it overlaps at least part of the body from outside and surrounds the applicator tip and a second position in which it extends backward from the body in a direction away from the aperture at the tip.<br>
According to the invention, since the cover rotates around an axis orthogonal to the longitudinal direction of the body, when the cover is in the first position in which it overlaps at least part of the body from outside and surrounds the applicator tip, it can protect the applicator tip and, in this position, can be kept in a compact shape. When the cover is in the second position in which it extends backward from the body in a direction away from the aperture at the tip, the applicator tip is made usable because it Is exposed, and the extended state of the aover results in an enlarged overall shape, which is also easier for a user to grip and use.<br>
A round boss protruding in a direction orthogonal to the longitudinal direction of the body can be formed on one of the body and cover, a round recess can be formed in the other of the body and cover, and the fitting of the round boss into the round recess enables the aover to turn relative to the body around the round boss and round recess. Thus, the cover can be rotatably fitted to the body in a simple configuration, and can further be made detachable from the body as required.<br>
A convex can be formed on one of the body and cover, a concave into which the convex can fit can be formed on the other of the body and cover, and the convex can be fitted into<br><br>
the concave when the cover is in the first position. Thus, the rotational position in which the cover protects the applicator tip can be maintained by the fitting of the convex with the concave.<br>
A stopper can be provided on the body to prevent the cover from turning any further when the cover turns from the first position and-reaches the second position. Thus, the rotational position of the cover can be restricted by the stopper. Further, Inadvertent rotation of the cover can be prevented when the user grips the cover in using the applicator tip.<br>
Furthermore, a second convex can be formed on one of the body and cover, a second concave into which the second convex can fit can be formed on the other of the body and cover, and the second convex can be fitted into the second concave when the cover is in the second position. Thus, the rotational position in which the cover allows the applicator tip to be exposed can be maintained by the fitting of the second convex with the second concave.<br>
The cover can be provided with an opening on the leading side of the rotation from the first position to second position to allow part of the body to be exposed in its first position. Thus, the cover and the body can be released from overlapping by pressing the body out through the opening when turning the cover from its first position to the second position.<br><br>
An edge of the cover can include a curved aroiform part. Thus, when the user grips the cover in using the applicator tip, the aroif orm part facilitates his gripping.<br>
The cover may be detachable from the body. Thus, the cover can be removed in accordance with situation In which. it is not-needed.<br>
The body is provided with a built-in detachable coat transfer set having a feed unit around which a transfer tape including a base tape substrate with a coat is wound and which feeds out the transfer tapa when the dispenser is in use and a take-up unit for taking up the transfer tape after the transfer of its coat by the applicator tip. and the coat transfer set can be placed or displaced through a position where it is not obstructed by the cover of the body. Thus, the cover can be prevented from obstructing the placement or displacement of the coat transfer set by turning the cover to an appropriate position.<br>
The present disclosure relates to subjeat matter contained in Japanese Patent Application Mo. 2004-234265, filed on August 11, 2004, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS An embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings. FIG. 1 to FIG. 5 show a dispenser with a aover according to the embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated, the dispenser 10 has a body 12 which constitutes the main part of the dispenser.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4 and FIG. 5, a coat transfer set 14 is provided within the body 12. The coat transfer set 14 mainly comprises a feed reel (feed unit) 18 around which a transfer tape 16 including a base tape substrate with a coat is wound<br><br>
and which feeds out the transfer tape 16 when the dispenser is in use, a transfer head {applicator tip) 20 for pressing the transfer tape 16 against and transferring the coat onto a surface to be transferred, and a take-up reel (take-up unit) 22 for talcing up the transfer tape 16 after the transfer of its coat. Between the feed reel 18 and take-up reel 22, there is disposed a rotation transmitting mechanism 24 for rotating them in conjunction with each other. The hase of the transfer head 20 is fixed within the body 12, and protrudes out of a tip aperture I2e formed at the tip of the body 12.<br>
A cover 30 is rotatably fitted outside the rear part of the body 12. The cover 30 is rot at able around an axis orthogonal to the longitudinal direction of the body 12. To this end, round bosses 12a and 12a are protrudently disposed on the both sides of the body 12 in a direction orthogonal to the longitudinal direction of the body 12.<br>
The cover 30 is formed relatively thin or soft. As shown in FIG. 3 and elsewhere, it has a pair of planar pieces 30a and 30a, a covering part 30b closing the pair of planar pieces 30a and 30a at the tip, and a linking part 30a linking the pair of planar pieces 30a and 30a in .their middle parts. A round recess 30d to fit with one or the other of the round bosses 12a and 12a is bored in each planar piece 30a. Alternatively, the round bosses may as well be formed on the cover, and the round recesses, in the body. The fitting of these round bosses 12a and round recesses 30d makes the cover<br><br>
30 rotatable relative to the body 12 around these round bosses 12a and round recesses 30d.<br>
The covering part 30b has an L seotional shape spanning two sides of each of the planar pieces 30a as shown in FIG. 4. Referring to FIG. 1, an opening 30a is formed between the covering part 30b and the linking part 30c. It is desirable that the opening 30e is set to be large enough for a user at least to insert a finger in it.<br>
The upper edge, as seen in FIG. 1, of each of the planar pieces 30a forms an aroiform part 3Oh in a moderately bent concave shape.<br>
Further, a small hole (concave) 3Of is formed in an appropriate position in each of the planar pieces 30a, and a small stub (convexes) 12b is formed on each side of the body 12 so as to correspond to the small hole 30f. The small stubs 12b fit the small holes 30f in a state in which, the cover 30 proteats the transfer head 20. Alternatively, the small holes or concaves may be formed in the body and the small stubs or convexes may be formed on the cover.<br>
Also, a groove (second concave) 30g, extending in the wldthwise direction, is formed in the inner surface of the linking part 30c, and corresponds to a rib (second convex) 12c, which fits into the groove 30g and is formed on the upper surface of the body 12. In the vicinity of the rib 12c, a step I2d is formed to serve as a stopper. The rib 12c fits into the groove 30g in a state in which the cover 30 allows the transfer head 20 to be exposed. The groove or the second<br><br>
concave may as well be formed in the body, and the rib or the second convex, on the cover.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a state in which the cover 30 is protecting the transfer head 20 (i.e. first position), with the covering part 30b surrounding the transfer head 20. In this state, the small stubs 12b are fitted in the small holes 30f to enable this state to be maintained. The cover 30 shields the body 12 and the transfer head 20 from outside, the cover 30 overlapping at least part of the body 12 from outside resulting in a compact overall shape of the dispenser with a cover 10.<br>
When this dispenser with a cover 10 is to be used, a force is applied to the cover 30 to disengage the small stubs 12b and the small holes 30f from each other. In this time, if a finger is inserted through the opening 30e between the covering part 30b and the linking part 30a which have been separated from each other to press with the finger the part of the body 12 exposed from the opening 30a in the direction of an arrow in PIG. 1, separation of the transfer head 20 and the covering part 30b is facilitated.<br>
Incidentally, in the state illustrated in PIG. 1. the cover 30 is tumabla only in the direction indicated by a curved arrow in PIG. 1, with the side on which the covering part 30b is located leading the turn. Thus, it is to be noted that the opening 30e is formed on the leading side.<br>
When the cover 30 is turned about 180 degrees counterclockwise as viewed in PIG. 1 to the state shown in PIG. 2, the cover 30 and the body 12 come into a state in whiah<br><br>
they form a substantially straight line in the longitudinal direction (i.e. second position), and the overall length of the dispenser with a cover 10 is extended. The linking part 30c, after interfering with the rib 12a, comes into contact with the step 12d to prevent the step 12d from turning further, and the rib 12c fits into the groove 30g to enable that state to be maintained. As the linking part 30c rides over the rib 12c to cause the rib 12c to fit into the groove 30g, the user can feel a click.<br>
In the state shown in PIG. 2, the transfer head 20 is fully exposed and is therefore usable. As the overall length of the dispenser with a cover 10 Is extended, the user can hold mainly the cover 30 in using the dispenser. The curved arciform part 30h of the cover 30 facilitates its holding between the user' s thumb and index finger, and its shape ensures holding ease. The arciform part 30h 13 formed on the edge which constitutes the trailing end of the planar pieces 30a of the cover 30 when the cover 30 turns from the position shown in PIG. 1 to that in PIG. 2.<br>
When the user, holding the cover 30, moves the transfer head 20 toward him while pressing against the surface to be transferred S as shown in PIG. 6, the transfer tape 16 fed out of the feed reel 18 is pressed by the transfer head 20 against the surface to be transferred to cause the coat to be transferred. Although the cover 30 is subjected by the user's grip during this operation to a counterclockwise rotation moment, as viewed in PIG. 6, around the center of<br><br>
the rotation by the grip, the contact between the linking part 30a and the step 12d prevents the cover 30 from turning counterclockwise, and the cover 30 and the body 12 are thereby enabled to maintain their straight aligned state.<br>
In this way, the dispenser with a cover 10 can be made easier to grip when in use and kept compact when under protection.<br>
As the cover 30 is formed relatively thin or soft as stated above, or to be flexible and elastic by the presence of the opening 30e, and the pair of planar pieces 30a and 30a can bend as appropriate, it is possible to easily detach the cover 30 from the body 12 by bending the planar pieces 30a and 30a to disengage the round recesses 30d and the round bosses 12a from each other, when the coyer 3 0 is not needed. For instance, a user who does not want to use the cover 30 for the holding purpose as mentioned above when using the dispenser, he can remove the cover 30 from the body 12 as appropriate in using the dispenser.<br>
Although the coat transfer set 14 is supposed, to be fixed to the body 12 in the embodiment described above, this is not the only conceivable configuration. The coat transfer set 14 can be a cartridge detachable from the body 12 or replaceable. In this case, the coat transfer set 14 can be placed or displaced through the front part of the body 12, namely through the tip aperture 12e, or through the rear part of the body 12, opposite to the tip aperture 12e, fox detachment or replacement. In any case, by allowing the cover 30 to turn in an appropriate<br><br><br>
position, it can be prevented from obstructing the plaaament or displacement of the coat transfer sot 14.<br>
While the principles of the invention have been desaribed above in connection with specific embodiments, and particular modifications thereof, it is to be eleaxly understood that this description is made only by way of example and not as a limitation on the scope of invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
