‘[Document Name] Specification<br>
[Title of the Invention] TRANSMISSION SYSTEM FOR VEHICLE [Technical Field] [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a transmission system for vehicle which is included in a power unit combining an internal combustion engine and a transmission and in which a crankshaft is provided with a torque converter and a main shaft of the transmission is provided with a clutch for interrupting power transmission. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
Conventionally, a one-way clutch for a torque converter stator and a power transmission interrupting clutch for a transmission are disposed between the torque converter and a crank web such that the one-way clutch and the power transmission interrupting clutch look being overlapped in a same position along an axial direction of the crankshaft as viewed in a direction perpendicular to the crankshaft, resulting in a large distance between the crankshaft and the main shaft (see the patent document 1, for example). [0003]<br>
[Patent Document 1] JP-A No. 105933/2001 (Fig. 4) [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problem to be Solved by the Invention] [0004]<br>
Improving arrangement of parts associated with the torque converter to reduce the distance between the crankshaft of an<br><br>
“intetnal combustion engine and the main shaft of the transmission and thereby making the power unit smaller. [Means for Solving the Problem] [0005]<br>
The present invention solves the above problem. The invention described in claim 1 relates to a transmission system for vehicle including a torque converter supported on a crankshaft, a one-way clutch which is supported on the crankshaft and which allows normal rotation of a stator of the torque converter while restricting reverse rotation thereof, a main shaft, disposed in parallel with the crankshaft, of a transmission, and a clutch for interrupting power transmission mounted on the main shaft. The torque converter is disposed at an axial end portion of the crankshaft. The one-way clutch and the clutch for interrupting power transmission are disposed between the torque converter and a crank web such that they are shifted from each other along an axis of the crankshaft as viewed in a direction perpendicular to the crankshaft. The one-way clutch and the clutch for interrupting power transmission are disposed such that, when viewed along the axis of the crankshaft, they look being partly overlapped, [0006]<br>
The invention described in claim 2 is characterized as follows. In the transmission system for vehicle according to claim 1: a turbine runner is disposed on a side, toward an axial end of the crankshaft, of the torque converter; a tubular turbine shaft extending into contact with the turbine runner and covering an outer periphery of the crankshaft extends toward<br><br>
the crank web; and the stator, the tubular stator shaft extending into contact with the stator, and the one-way clutch are supported on an outer periphery of the tubular turbine shaft. [0007]<br>
The invention described in claim 3 is characterized as follows. In the transmission system for vehicle according to claim 2: the one-way clutch includes an outer race provided at an end portion of the tubular stator shaft and an inner race which is relatively rotatably mounted on an outer periphery of the tubular stator shaft and which is fixedly connected to a crankcase; a fixation mechanism for fixing the inner race to the crankcase includes an inner race locking member which has a ring portion connected to the inner race and an outwardly protruding arm portion, and a holding section which is installed in the crankcase and which holds an end of the arm portion to prevent the inner race locking member from rotating; and the holding section is positioned, in a direction radial to the axis of the crankshaft, outside an outer periphery of a casing of the torque converter. [Effect of the Invention] [0008]<br>
According to the invention of claim 1, the one-way clutch and the clutch for interrupting power transmission are shifted from each other along the axis of the crankshaft, that is, they are in mutually offset positions. Therefore, the distance between the crankshaft and the main shaft can be reduced such that they look partly overlapped when viewed along the axis<br><br>
of the crankshaft. This makes it possible to enlarge the clutch for interrupting power transmission. Also, reducing the distance between the crankshaft and the main shaft allows the power unit to be made smaller. [0009]<br>
According to the invention of claim 2, the turbine runner is disposed on an axial end side of the crankshaft and the tubular stator shaft is mounted on the outer periphery of the tubular turbine shaft. Therefore, it is not necessary to lengthen the tubular stator shaft to allow mounting of the one-way clutch. This makes it possible to reduce the weight of the power unit. As the one-way clutch can be mounted toward the torque converter, the tubular stator shaft can be made shorter, and an outer diameter of a peripheral portion, facing the clutch for interrupting power transmission, of the crankshaft can be reduced. Therefore, the distance between the crankshaft and the main shaft can be reduced, and the power unit can be made smaller. [0010]<br>
According to the invention of claim 3, the holding section is provided outside an outer periphery of the torque converter casing. Therefore, when mounting the one-way clutch in proximity of the torque converter provided at an end of the crankshaft, engagement between the inner race locking member and the holding section can be arranged with ease, so that workability is improved.<br>
[Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention] [0011]<br><br>
Fig. 1 is a sectional development view of a power unit 1 including a transmission system for vehicle according to a first embodiment of the present embodiment, the view including principal rotary shafts of the power unit 1. The power unit 1 is of an integral type combining an internal combustion engine E and a transmission T. The figure shows a crankshaft 2, a main shaft 3 of the transmission, and a counter shaft 4 of the transmission which are principal rotary shafts of the power unit. These shafts are parallel to one another. The figure shows the power unit 1 as viewed approximately from above. The crankshaft 2 is mounted, for example, on a four-wheel buggy car (saddle-ride type vehicle for use on ruff surfaces) in an orientation perpendicular to a direction of vehicle travel, that is, lateral with respect to, the direction of vehicle travel. The right side of the figure corresponds to the right side of the direction of vehicle travel with the power unit<br>
I	being mounted on the vehicle. The upper side of the figure corresponds to anterior portions of the power unit 1 and the vehicle.<br>
[0012]<br>
The crankcase is divided into left and right portions. It includes a left crankcase 6, a right crankcase 7, a left crankcase cover 8, and a right crankcase cover 9. A cylinder block 10 with its axis extending forward is connected to front parts of the left and right crankcase^ 6 and 7. A cylinder liner<br>
II	extends into inside the crankcase. A center line of the cylinder block 10 is slightly inclined upward with respect to the forward direction, though not so illustrated in the figure.<br><br>
‘[0013]<br>
The crankshaft 2 is rotatably supported by the left and right crankcases 6 and 7 and the right crankcase cover 9 via respective ball bearings 12 to 14. The main shaft 3 of the transmission is rotatably supported by the left and right crankcases 6 and 7 via ball bearings 15 and 16. The counter shaft 4 is rotatably supported by the left and right crankcases 6 and 7 via ball bearings 17 and 18. The crankshaft 2 is divided into left and right portions. The left and right portions are united at a crank web 2a by a crank pin 2b. A connecting rod 19 is connected to the crank pin 2b. An alternator 20 is provided at a left end portion of the crankshaft 2. It includes a stator 21 and a rotor 22. The stator 21 is fixed to an inside of the left crankcase cover 8. The rotor 22 is fixed to a left end of the crankshaft 2 in a manner to cover a periphery of the stator. It rotates together with the crankshaft 2. [0014]<br>
A torque converter 30 is provided at a right end portion of the crankshaft 2. The torque converter 30 includes a pump impeller 31 which rotates together with the crankshaft 2, a turbine runner 32 facing the pump impeller 31, and a stator 33. Hereinafter, in describing positions of parts between a right end of the crankshaft and the crank web, such expressions as “toward the shaft end,” “on the shaft-end side,” and “in the direction toward the shaft end” will be used to describe a direction toward the right end of the crankshaft. Similarly, such expressions as “toward the middle, “ “on the middle side, “ and “in the direction toward the middle” will be used to describe<br><br>
a direction toward the crank web. In connection with the main shaft of the transmission being described later, too, such expressions as “toward the shaft end” and “toward the middle” denoting the same directions as the “toward the shaft end” and “toward the middle” used in connection with the crankshaft will be used. In the torque converter 30, the turbine runner 32 is positioned toward the shaft end, and the pump impeller 31 is disposed inside a casing 34 whose inner end is fixed to the crankshaft and which covers the turbine runner 3 2 while extending longer than the turbine runner 32 in the direction toward the middle. A tubular turbine shaft 35 being connected to an inner periphery of the turbine runner 32 extends, covering an outer periphery of the crankshaft 2, in the direction toward the middle of the crankshaft 2 . A primary drive gear 36 is formed in an end portion, toward the middle, of the tubular turbine shaft 35. The tubular turbine shaft 35 is rotatably supported by the crankshaft 2 via a ball bearing 37 and a needle bearing 38. [0015]<br>
The stator 33 is fit between the pump impeller 31 and the turbine runner 32. The tubular stator shaft 39 connected to an inner periphery of the stator 33 extends, covering an outer periphery of the tubular turbine shaft 35, in the direction toward the middle of the crankshaft. The tubular stator shaft 39 is rotatably slidably supported by the outer periphery of the tubular turbine shaft 35. An end portion, toward the pump impeller, of the torque converter casing 34 is rotatably slidably held on an outer periphery of the tubular stator shaft<br><br>
9 via a seal material.<br>
0016]<br>
An outer race 40 of a one-way clutch is welded to an end portion of the tubular stator shaft 39. An inner race 41 of the one-way clutch is rotatably held on the outer periphery of the tubular stator shaft 39. The inner race 41 is fixedly connected to the crankcase via an inner race locking member, leans used to fixedly connecting the inner race 41 to the crankcases will be described later. A one-way clutch 42 which follows normal rotation of the stator while restricting reverse<br>
quotation is formed between the outer race 40 and the inner race<br>
1. When the output of the internal combustion engine E increases and the rotation speed of the crankshaft 2 rises to certain value, the turbine runner 32 starts rotating causing the primary drive gear 3 6 at the end portion of the tubular turbine shaft 3 5 to also start rotating. :0017]<br>
At a right end portion of the main shaft 3 of the transmission T extending adjacent and in parallel to the crankshaft, a primary driven gear 44 constantly engaging the primary drive gear 36 is rotatably mounted on the main shaft . A multiple disc clutch 46 for interrupting power transmission .s provided on the shaft end side of the main shaft 3 to be adjacent to the primary driven gear 44. A clutch outer 47 and clutch inner 48 of the multiple disc clutch 46 are fixed to the primary driven gear 44 and the main shaft 3, respectively. Outer friction plates 49 and inner friction plates 50 are held, being alternately arranged, by the clutch outer 47 and the<br><br>
clutch inner 48, respectively, slidably in an axial direction of the main shaft 3. A pressure plate 51 is axially movably attached to the clutch inner 48. The plural friction plates 49 and 50 when subjected to a spring force of a coil spring 52 are mutually pressed between the clutch inner 48 and the pressure plate 51 thereby generating a friction force. This occurs when the multiple disc clutch 46 is engaged. In this state, the torque of the crankshaft 2 is transmitted to the main shaft 3 of the transmission via the torque converter 30, the primary drive gear 36, the primary driven gear 44, and the multiple disc clutch 46. To disengage the multiple disc clutch 46, the distance between the pressure plate 51 and the clutch inner 48 where the friction plates are mutually pressed is widened by applying a force to an operating mechanism 53 and thereby pushing the pressure plate 51 in the axial direction opposing the spring force of the coil spring 52. When, as a result, a friction force between friction plates is lost, the clutch is disengaged. The transmission system for vehicle is what includes the torque converter 30, the tubular turbine shaft 3 5, the primary drive gear 3 6, the tubular stator shaft 3 9, the one-way clutch 42, the primary driven gear 44, and the multiple disc clutch 46. [0018]<br>
A transmission gear group 56 is provided between the main shaft 3, the counter shaft 4 and an intermediate shaft, not shown. Four gears Ml to M4 are mounted on the main shaft 3. Another four gears CI to C4 which are constantly engaged with the four gears Ml to M4 are mounted on the counter shaft 4.<br><br>
The gears M4 and C4 are reverse gears. They are engaged with each other via twin reverse idle gears mounted on the intermediate shaft, not shown. Of the reference letters and numerals denoting these gears, “M” is for a gear mounted on<br>
the main shaft, and “C” is for a gear mounted on the counter shaft. Subscripts “1” to “3” indicate that the gears denoted are for the first to third speeds, respectively. Subscript “4” is for a reverse gear. These gears have the following features:<br>
(X) Ml and C4: Fixed on a shaft.<br>
(Y) M3, M4, CI, and C2 : Rotatable about a shaft (not movable along the shaft).<br>
(Z) M2 and C3 : Movable along a shaft (not rotatable about the shaft).<br>
[0019]<br>
The gears (Z) movable along a shaft can be in three positions, that is, a neutral position, a right axially shifted position, and a left axially shifted position. When the gears<br>
(Z) are axially shifted right or left, they engage with adjacent gears (Y) rotatable about a shaft causing the gears (Y) to be locked to the corresponding shafts. To enable this operation, a protruding portion for locking to an adjacent gear is provided at each end of each of the gears (Z) movable along a shaft. Around the center of the boss of each of the gears (Z) , a circular gap for locking to a fork which axially drives the gear is provided. The fork is not shown.<br>
[0020]<br>
The first-stage to third-stage speed changes are made according to the positions of the gears M2 and C3 that are driven<br><br>
by forks controlled by driver’s shifting operation as follows:<br>
(1)	First stage: Gear M2 is in neutral position and gear C3 is in right shifted position. Speed changes according to gear ratio between Ml and CI.<br>
(2)	Second stage: Gear M2 is in neutral position and gear C3 is in left shifted position. Speed changes according to gear ratio between M2 and C2.<br>
(3)	Third stage: Gear M2 is in right shifted position and gear C3 is in neutral position. Speed changes according to gear ratio between M3 and C3.<br>
(4)	Reverse: Gear M2 is in left shifted position and gear C3 is in neutral position. Speed changes according to gear ratio between gear M4, twin idle gears on the intermediate shaft, and gear C4.<br>
The torque transmitted from the main shaft 3 to the counter shaft 4 as a result of a speed change is transmitted from the left end of the counter shaft 4 to rear wheels via a path, not shown in the figure. [0021]<br>
The torque converter 30 is provided with a one-way clutch 42 which, as mentioned in the foregoing, allows the stator 33 to rotate only in one direction. The one-way clutch 42 is formed between the outer race 4 0 provided at an end portion toward the middle of the tubular stator shaft 39 and the inner race 41 fixedly connected to the crankcase. [0022]<br>
Fig. 2 is a sectional view showing a fixation mechanism 60 for the inner race. The crankshaft 2 is also shown in the<br><br>
figure. Fig. 3 shows an interior of the crankcase as viewed from a right side along an axis of the crankshaft with the right crankcase cover 9 shown in Fig. 2 removed. The torque converter 30 is shown in imaginary line. The inner race fixation mechanism 60 includes an inner race locking member 61 fixed by welding to the inner race 41 and a support 62 which holds an end of the inner race locking member 61 not to allow the inner race locking member 61 to rotate. The inner race locking member 61 includes a ring portion 61a and an arm portion 61b. An inner periphery of the ring portion 61a is welded to the inner race 41. The support 62 is erectly fixed to the right crankcase 7 with screws 63. The end of the inner race locking member 61 is held by being inserted in a hole 62a provided in an end portion of the support 62. In the configuration described above, the inner race 41 is fixed to the crankcase and, with the inner race 41 serving as a fixed part, the one-way clutch 42 works to allow the stator 33 to rotate in one direction only. [0023]<br>
As described in connection with Fig . 1, the one-way clutch 42 and the multiple disc clutch 46 for interrupting power transmission are shifted in position along the crankshaft 2 as viewed from a side of the crankshaft. Thanks to this arrangement, the distance between the crankshaft and the main shaft has been reduced compared in a conventional arrangement made using prior technology. Fig. 3 shows that the outer race 40 of the one-way clutch 42 and an outer periphery of the multiple disc clutch 46 look partly overlapped when the transmission system is viewed in an axial direction.<br><br>
[0024]<br>
Fig. 4 is a sectional view showing a differently-configured inner race fixation mechanism 64 for the inner race 41. Fig. 5 shows an interior of the crankcase as viewed from a right side along an axis of the crankshaft with the right crankcase cover 9 shown in Fig. 4 removed. The inner race fixation mechanism includes an inner race locking member 65 fixed by welding to the inner race 41 and a pin 66 which prevents the inner race locking member 65 from rotating. The inner race locking member 65 includes a ring portion 65a and an arm portion 65b. The ring portion 65a is welded to the inner race 41. The pin 66 is erectly fixed, at its base, to the right crankcase cover 9 with a screw 66a. It abuts against a forked portion 65c provided at an end of the arm portion 65b thereby preventing the inner race locking member 6 5 from rotating. In the configuration described above, the inner race 41 is fixed to the crankcase and, with the inner race 41 serving as a fixed part, the one-way clutch 42 works to allow the stator 3 3 to rotate in one direction only. [0025]<br>
Fig. 6 shows how another differently configured inner race fixation mechanism 67 for the inner race 41 looks when an interior of the crankcase is viewed form a right side along the crankshaft with the right crankcase cover 9 removed. The inner race fixation mechanism 67 includes an inner race locking member 68 fixed by welding to the inner race 41 and a concave portion 69 provided on the right crankcase cover 9 to prevent the inner race locking member 68 from rotating. The inner race<br><br>
locking member 68 includes a ring portion 68a and an arm portion 68b. The ring portion 68a is welded to the inner race 41. An end of the arm portion 68b is fit in the concave portion 69. In the configuration described above, the inner race 41 is fixed to the crankcase and, with the inner race 41 serving as a fixed part, the one-way clutch 42 works to allow the stator 33 to rotate in one direction only. [0026]<br>
In the first embodiment of the present invention, the one-way clutch is positioned closer to the torque converter between the torque converter and the primary drive gear, so that, when viewed in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the crankshaft, the one-way clutch and the multiple disc clutch are, as described in claim 1, shifted in position from each other, that is, they are in mutually of f set positions . Therefore, the distance between the crankshaft and the main shaft can be reduced without causing the one-way clutch and the multiple disc clutch to interfere with each other. This allows the power unit to be made smaller. [0027]<br>
As described in claim 2, the stator, the tubular stator shaft, and the one-way clutch are supported on the outer periphery of the tubular turbine shaft. The one-way clutch can therefore be mounted in a position toward the torque converter. This allows the tubular stator shaft to be made shorter, resulting in a lighter tubular stator shaft and, hence, a lighter power unit. Since an outer diameter of a peripheral portion facing the multiple disc clutch of the crankshaft can<br><br>
1also be reduced, the distance between the crankshaft and the main shaft can be reduced. This allows the power unit to be made smaller. [0028]<br>
Also, in the first embodiment, the support 62, the pin 66, and the concave portion 69 on the right crankcase are provided, as a holding section, outside an outer periphery of the torque converter casing as shown in Figs. 2 to 6. As described in claim 3, with the holding section provided outside the outer periphery of the torque converter casing, when mounting the one-way clutch in proximity of the torque converter provided at the end of the crankshaft, engagement between the inner race locking member and the holding section can be arranged with ease, so that workability is improved. [0029]<br>
Fig. 7 is a sectional development view of a power unit 70 including a transmission system for vehicle according to a second embodiment of the present embodiment. Principal rotary shafts such as a crankshaft 71, a main shaft 72, and a counter shaft 73 of the power unit are shown in the figure. The present embodiment differs from the first embodiment mainly in positions of internal parts of the torque converter, shapes and positions of the tubular turbine shaft and tubular stator shaft, position of the one-way clutch for the stator, and inner race locking means used. In other respects, there is no functional difference between the two embodiments even though some parts may slightly differ in shape between the two embodiments. The following description will center on aspects<br><br>
in which the present embodiment differs from the first<br>
embodiment.<br>
[0030]<br>
The power unit 70 according to the present embodiment includes a crankshaft 71, a main shaft 72, a counter shaft 73, and an intermediate shaft, not shown. These shafts are surrounded and rotatably supported, via ball bearings, by such parts as a left crankcase 74, a right crankcase 75, a left crankcase cover 76, a right crankcase cover 77, and a cylinder block 78. [0031]<br>
A torque converter 80 is provided at a right end portion of the crankshaft 71. The torque converter 80 includes a pump impeller 81 fixed to the crankshaft 71, a turbine runner 82 facing the pump impeller 81, and a stator 83. In the torque converter 80, the pump impeller 81 is positioned toward the shaft end, and the turbine runner 82 is disposed inside a casing 84 which, covering the pump impeller 81, extends longer than the pump impeller 81 in the direction toward the middle. The positions relative to each other of the pump impeller 81 and the turbine runner 82 arranged along the axial direction of the crankshaft are a reversal of their positions in the first embodiment. [0032]<br>
The stator 83 is mounted between the pump impeller 81 and the turbine runner 82. A tubular stator shaft 85 connected to an inner periphery of the stator 83 extends, covering an outer periphery of the crankshaft 71, in the direction toward the<br><br>
middle of the crankshaft 71. An outer race 86 of the one-way clutch for the stator is formed in an end portion, toward the middle, of the tubular stator shaft 85 . The tubular stator shaft 85 is rotatably supported by the crankshaft 71 via a pair of needle bearings 87. [0033]<br>
A tubular turbine shaft 88 connected to an inner periphery of the turbine runner 82 extends, covering an outer periphery of the tubular stator shaft 85, in the direction toward the middle of the crankshaft 71. A primary drive gear 89 is formed at an end portion of the tubular turbine shaft 88. The tubular turbine shaft 88 is relatively rotatably supported by the outer periphery of the tubular stator shaft 85 via a ball bearing 90 and a needle bearing 91. An end portion toward the turbine runner of the torque converter casing 84 is rotatably held on a portion toward the torque converter of an outer periphery of the tubular turbine shaft 88 via a ball bearing 92 and a seal material 93. The order in which the tubular stator shaft 85 and the tubular turbine shaft 88 covering the outer periphery of the crankshaft 71 are radially arranged is a reversal of the corresponding order used in the first embodiment. [0034]<br>
The tubular stator shaft 85 extending through an interior of the tubular turbine shaft 88 protrudes from an opening, toward the middle of the crankshaft, of the tubular turbine shaft 88. As described above, the outer race 86 of the one-way clutch is formed in an end portion of the tubular turbine shaft 88. An inner race 94 of the one-way clutch is held in an inner<br><br>
position facing the outer race 86 such that the inner race 94 is rotatable relative to the crankshaft 71 via a needle bearing 95 . The inner race 94 of the one-way clutch is fixedly connected to the right crankcase 75 via an inner race locking member 96. The one-way clutch 97 that allows normal rotation of the stator 83 while restricting reverse rotation is formed between the outer race 86 and the inner race 94. [0035]<br>
The following arrangements according to the present embodiment are the same as those according to the first embodiment, so that their detailed description is omitted: an AC generator 98 is provided at a left end of the crankshaft 71; a primary driven gear 99 which engages with the primary drive gear 89 is rotatably supported at a right end of the main shaft 72; a multiple disc clutch 100 for interrupting power transmission between the primary driven gear 99 and the main shaft 72 is provided on the shaft-end side of the primary driven gear 99; and a transmission gear group 101 is provided between the main shaft 72, the counter shaft 73, and an intermediate shaft, not shown. [0036]<br>
In the second embodiment, the one-way clutch and the multiple disc clutch are positioned on opposite sides of the primary drive and driven gears, so that, when viewed in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the crankshaft, the one-way clutch and the multiple disc clutch are, as described in claim 1, shifted in position from each other, that is, they are in mutually offset positions. Therefore, the distance<br><br>
between the crankshaft and the main shaft can be reduced without causing the one-way clutch and the multiple disc clutch to interfere with each other. This allows the power unit to be made smaller.<br>
