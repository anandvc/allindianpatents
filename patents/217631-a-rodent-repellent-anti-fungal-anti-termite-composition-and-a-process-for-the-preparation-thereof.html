				<td>FIELD OF INVENITION<br>
This invention relates to a rodent repellent, anti-fungal, anti-termite composition and a process for the preparation thereof. Rodent repellent, anti-fungal, anti-termite composition is used for stopping growth of termites, fungi and the rodents from damaging the laminates laid in the godowns and food storage. It is also used for water/moisture proofing in the godowns, food storages and other packages.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Rodent repellent, anti-fungal PVC (polyvinyl chloride) compositions are not as such known in the prior art for stopping the entry of the rodents in the godowns/storage and to prevent growth of fungi and termites -Therefore, around 45% food grain material in India is wasted during the storage period.<br>
OBJECTS OF PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The main object of this invention is to propose a rodent repellent, antifungal and anti-termite composition to stop the entry of the rodents in to the godowns/storage for food grains and to prevent growth of fungi and termites on the grains as well as packaging materials.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a process for preparation of rodent repellent, anti-fungal and anti-termite composition.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
In accordance with this invention there is provided a process for preparing of rodent repellent, anti-fungal and anti-termite composition comprises of 100 parts resin preferably poly-vinyl chloride (PVC) into a ribbon blender maintained at temperature of 80-90° C and adding 1-10 phr stabilizer and the step of blending is done for 3-5 minutes. 40-80 phr plasticizer is added into said blender and mixing is done till a free flow powder is obtained. To this mixture 0.5-6 phr additives, 0.25-10 phr rodent repellent, 0.25-5 phr anti-fungal agent and 0.5-10 phr anti-termite agent are added and mixing is done for 5-10 minutes to get free flow powder composition.<br>
The composition so obtained is then subjected to the conventional step of film making. The thickness of the film is in the range of 100-250 micron. The film so prepared is laminated onto a bitumen-jute laminate, which is used as the rodent repellent, anti-furigal and anti-termite material and also as moisture proofing and water proofing material.<br>
The stabilizer used is a mixture of tribasic lead stearate, dibasic lead sulphate, lead sulphate and Glycidyl mono-stearate mixed in the amount of 0.7-5 phr, 0.2-3 phr, 0.1-1 phr and 0-1 phr respectively.<br><br>
The plastisizer used is a mixture of chlorinated paraffin wax (0-40 phr), dioctyl phthalate (40-80 phr) and dibutyl phthalate (0-20) mixed together.<br>
The additive used is a mixture of titanium dioxide (0.2-3), calcium stearate (0.15-1.5 phr), stearic acid (0.1 -2), carbon black (0.008-0.1) and Micro crystalline wax (0.1-0.5).<br>
The rodent repellent material used is cycloheximide, tetramethyl thiuram disulphide. Methyl anthranilate or Zinc dimethyl dithiocarbamate alone or a mixture thereof in the amount of 0.25-2, 2-5, 0-5 and 0-6 respectively.<br>
The anti-fungal agent used is chlorhexidine, Bisguanazines, Triethyl organotin, organozinc or 10,10'-oxy bisphenoxar sine or a mixture thereof in the amount of 0-5, 0.5-3, 2.5-5, 0-4.5 and 2-5 respectively.<br>
The anti-termite agent used in said composition is Pentaphenepale, Chlorpyriphos, Lindane or Pentachlorophenol alone or a mixture therof in the amount of 0.5 to 7, 0.5 to<br>
5, 0.5 to 6 or 3 to 10 respectively, taking at least any two of the above.<br>
WORKING EXAMPLE<br>
This invention is now illustrated with following working examples which are intended to be illustrated example's and are not intended to be taken restrictively to imply any limitation on the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example-1<br>
100 parts of poly vinyl chloride was put in a jacketed ribbon blender. 7 parts of stabilizer was added into said blender maintained at 80°C and the mixer was blended for 4 minutes. 65 parts plasticizer was added into said blender and the blending was continued till a free flowing powder is obtained. 4 parts additives, 5 parts rodent repellent, 4 parts anti-fungal and 5 parts anti-termite agents were added into the said mixer in the blender and the mixing was done for a period of 8 minutes to get a free flow powder composition.<br>
The powder composition so obtained was subjected to the conventional step of film making and the film so obtained was laminated onto a bitumen-jute laminate for use as a rodent repellent, anti-fungal and anti-termite sheet in the godowns of food grains.<br>
Example-2<br>
100 parts of poly vinyl chloride was put in a jacketed ribbon blender maintained at 80°C. 7 parts of stabilizer was added into said blender and the mixer was blended for 4 minutes. 65 parts plasticizer was added into said blender and the blending was continued till a free flowing powder was obtained. 4 part additives, 3 parts rodent repellent, 5 parts anti fungal and 7 parts anti termite agents were added into the said mixer in the blender and the mixing was done for a period of 8 minutes to get a free flow powder composition.<br>
The powder composition so obtained was subjected to the conventional step of film making and the film so obtained was laminated on to a bitumen-jute laminate for use as a rodent repellent and anti fungal sheet in the godowns of food grains.<br>
