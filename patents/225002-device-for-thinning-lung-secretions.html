2002. The complete disclosure of each of the above-identified priority applications<br>
is fully incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to vibrating a patient's lungs to<br>
reduce the viscosity of mucus contained therein. More particularly, the present<br>
invention relates to a device and method for vibrating a patient's lungs with<br>
low-frequency audio Shockwaves.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The human lungs comprise a natural means for clearing mucus. Human<br>
lungs contain tiny clearing cilia that vibrate at approximately 18 Hz. At that<br>
frequency, mucus has a significant phase change from a viscous to fluid to thinner<br>
secretions. Accordingly, the cilia operate to loosen the mucus by making it more<br>
fluid. Once the mucus is more fluid, it can be more easily expelled.<br>
Some patients with weak lungs, disease, or other ailments have lungs that<br>
cannot create a sufficient phase change in the viscous mucus. Additionally, a doctor<br>
may need to induce a sputum sample from a patient. Accordingly, an artificial<br><br>
means of vibrating the lungs at approximately 18 Hz can be used to supplement the<br>
patient's natural mucus system. In some cases, an artificial means of vibrating the<br>
lungs can produce the same phase change in mucus as produced by the lungs'<br>
natural cilia.<br>
One conventional method for artificially vibrating a patient's lungs is by<br>
using pulses of air pressure introduced through the mouth and into the lungs.<br>
However, such a method can produce dangerously high air pressures, which can<br>
damage the fragile air sacs in the lungs.<br>
Another conventional method for artificially vibrating a patient's lungs is by<br>
using low frequency audio of approximately 18 Hz to make lung secretions thinner.<br>
Low frequency audio does not induce potentially dangerous high air pressures in the<br>
lungs that are associated with the air pulses discussed above. However,<br>
conventional methods require very high audio power to cause vibration at low<br>
frequencies. Common loudspeaker components can be used to provide a<br>
high-powered audio source for vibrating the lungs. However, the life expectancy of<br>
the high-powered audio drivers is low, and the cost of the high-powered audio<br>
drivers is high. Additionally, powered subwoofers and loudspeakers typically are<br>
not disposable or portable.<br>
A patient's lungs and vocal cords make a particularly efficient loudspeaker in<br>
the vocal range. However, low frequencies are not efficiently produced because<br>
both the vocal cords and the lungs are too small. If the lungs could be made larger,<br>
they would support low frequency audio production, and they also would couple<br>
efficiently to a low frequency audio source.<br>
Therefore, a need in the art exists for a system and method that can provide a<br>
low-cost, disposable, and/or portable, artificial means of vibrating a patient's lungs<br><br>
to cause a viscous change in mucus contained therein. A need in the art also exists<br>
for an efficient means of coupling a patient's lungs with an audio source to produce<br>
a low frequency vibration in the lungs. Additionally, there exists a need in the art<br>
for a non-powered, low-frequency audio source for artificially vibrating a patient's<br>
lungs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention can provide a device and method for artificially<br>
vibrating a patient's lungs to cause a viscosity change in mucus contained therein.<br>
The device and method can be used to clean mucus from the lungs or to induce a<br>
sputum sample for diagnostic purposes from the lungs.<br>
The lung vibrating device and method according to the present invention can<br>
allow the lungs to produce low frequency audio that can vibrate the lungs at the<br>
desired frequency to change the viscosity of mucus. Typically, human lungs are too<br>
small to produce low-frequency audio sound. The lung vibrating device and method<br>
according to the present invention can comprise an acoustical resistance that can<br>
increase the apparent volume of the lungs, thereby allowing the lungs to produce<br>
low-frequency audio in the desired range. The acoustical resistance can allow the<br>
lungs to couple efficiently to an audio source to produce low-frequency Shockwaves.<br>
The acoustical resistance can make the audio source behave as if it is operating in a<br>
much larger volume than the body cavity alone, thereby allowing low-frequency<br>
audio to be produced and considerably improving energy transfer efficiency. The<br>
present invention can generate relatively low frequencies efficiently by using an<br>
acoustical coupling technique based on Thiele-Small loudspeaker parameters.<br><br>
The device according to the present invention can use the acoustical<br>
resistance to improve the transfer of audio energy to a body cavity such as the lungs.<br>
The device can produce low frequency audio and then can use the body cavity as a<br>
loudspeaker enclosure. The acoustical resistance can couple the body cavity<br>
efficiently to the low frequency sound. Additionally, the acoustical resistance can<br>
efficiently couple the sound/audio/shockwave to the body cavity to vibrate the lungs<br>
at the desired frequency. Accordingly, small and inexpensive sound sources can<br>
efficiently generate low frequency audio in body cavities.<br>
In an exemplary aspect of the present invention, a lung vibrating device can<br>
comprise a reed disposed in a housing. A patient can blow air through the housing,<br>
which can cause the reed to vibrate and produce an audio shockwave. An acoustical<br>
resistance of the device can couple the audio Shockwave produce by the reed with<br>
the lungs to produce low-frequency vibrations. Accordingly, the acoustical<br>
resistance can provide a back pressure that can transmit the low-frequency vibrations<br>
into the lungs to cause a viscosity change in mucus.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described below<br>
with reference to Figures 1-12 in which the same reference numerals represent<br>
similar elements.<br>
Figure 1A illustrates a perspective, cut-away view of a lung vibrating device<br>
100 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Figure 1B<br>
illustrates a cross-sectional, side view of the exemplary lung vibrating device 100.<br>
The device 100 comprises an unpowered, disposable audio noisemaker. As shown<br>
in Figures 1A and 1B, the device 100 comprises a harmonica-type, free reed 104 in a<br>
housing 102. The device 100 also comprises an acoustical resistance 106 disposed<br>
within the housing 102.<br>
The housing 102 can comprise a standard respiratory tube or other suitable<br>
material. As shown, the reed 104 can be coupled at point P to an insert 102a<br>
disposed in the housing 102. Alternatively, the reed 104 can be provided in a<br>
separate end cap (not shown) that couples to an end of the housing 102. The reed<br>
104 can be coupled to the housing 102, or to the housing insert 102a, by any suitable<br><br>
method. For example, the reed 104 can be glued or sonically welded to the housing<br>
102 or insert 102a.<br>
The reed 104 can be formed from any suitable material such as plastic, wood,<br>
or metal, or combinations of those materials. In one exemplary embodiment, the<br>
reed 104 can be formed of solid brass. In another exemplary embodiment, the reed<br>
104 can be formed of Mylar. In another exemplary embodiment, the reed 104 can<br>
be a composite of several materials. For example, the reed 104 can be formed of<br>
two Mylar sheets with an inner stiffening material. The stiffening material can be<br>
any suitable material, for example, tin foil.<br>
The efficiency of the reed 104 can be increased by providing a weight (not<br>
shown) on its free end. For a more complete discussion of weighting the free end of<br>
the reed, see the discussion below with reference to Figures 9A-9F. The weight can<br>
assist the reed 104 in vibrating as air flows past it. Alternatively or additionally, the<br>
efficiency of the reed 104 can be increased by providing an airfoil (not shown) on its<br>
free end. As air flows past the reed 104, the airfoil provides lift, which cause the<br>
free end of the reed 104 to rise. As the airfoil rises with the free end, the airfoil<br>
stalls, causing the reed 104 to fall.<br>
Because the lung clearing cilia of most patients operate at approximately<br>
18 Hz, the device 100 does not need to reproduce a wide frequency range of sound.<br>
Accordingly, in an exemplary embodiment, the device 100 can be tuned to an<br>
operating frequency of about 18 Hz, or it can be tuned to match the operating<br>
frequency of a specific patient's cilia. Matching the acoustical resistance of the<br>
device to the patient's lung cavity can make the device efficient and inexpensive. In<br>
an alternative exemplary embodiment, the device can be tuned to operate in a<br>
frequency range of about 12 Hz to about 24 Hz. In another alternative exemplary<br><br>
embodiment, the device can be tuned to operate in a frequency range of about 16 Hz<br>
to about 20 Hz.<br>
Regarding the vibration frequency of the device, a reed can be tuned to<br>
vibrate at the desired frequency. Alternatively, a process called sub-harmonic<br>
doubling can be used. In that process, the reed can be tuned to vibrate at a frequency<br>
that is about double the desired frequency. However, in sub-harmonic doubling, an<br>
additional Shockwave is produced at about one-half of the vibration frequency.<br>
Accordingly, the additional Shockwave is produced at about the desired frequency.<br>
For example, the reed can be tuned to vibrate at about 36 Hz, thereby producing an<br>
additional Shockwave at the desired frequency of about 18 Hz.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the acoustical<br>
resistance 106 can comprise a small piece of foam, a medical HEPTA filter of the<br>
desired acoustical resistance, or a cone tapering down to a smaller diameter. In<br>
another alternative exemplary embodiment, a variable acoustical resistance can be<br>
used to tune the system to a particular patient. For example, the acoustical<br>
resistance 106 can be a variably compressed piece of foam, interchangeable HEPTA<br>
filters having different resistances, or a variable shutter or valve giving an adjustable<br>
exit diameter. Alternatively, the acoustical resistance 106 can be replaced with a<br>
movable piston (not shown) disposed on the exit end of the housing 102. The<br>
movable piston can control the amount of resistance provided to air exiting the<br>
housing 102.<br>
To use the device 100 for lung cleaning or sputum sample induction, a<br>
patient exhales through the housing 102 of the device 100 for about 3 minutes or<br>
less. As the patient exhales through the housing 102, air enters the housing in the<br>
direction A through end 102d of the housing 102 and exits the housing 102 and end<br><br>
102e. The air passing by reed 104 causes the reed 104 to vibrate. The reed 104 can<br>
be tuned to vibrate at about 18 Hz (or to a frequency corresponding to the patient's<br>
cilia). The device can produce a volume of about 10 dBa to about 75 dBa. In<br>
alternative exemplary embodiments, the device can be tuned to produce a volume of<br>
about 10 dBa to about 20 dBa or about 65 dBa to about 75 dBa. The pressure<br>
resistance produced can be about 2.5 cm H2O at 100 Lpm. In terms of pressure or<br>
power, 70 dBa is about three orders of magnitude less than typical activities such as<br>
yelling or loud continuous coughing.<br>
While the device 100 only applies about between about 75 to about 100 dBa<br>
to the airway, it can drive the thorax hard enough to feel the lungs vibrate through<br>
thick clothing. By vibrating the lungs at approximately 18 Hz, the lung secretions<br>
can become thinner, allowing the natural cleaning action of the lung's mucus pump<br>
to dispose of the secretions. After using the device 100, the secretions collect at the<br>
back of the patient's throat for approximately 3 to 12 hours. The patient then can<br>
swallow the secretions or orally expel them.<br>
Figure 2 is a cross section of an exemplary housing insert 102a illustrating an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the reed 104 disposed in the housing 102. To prevent the<br>
reed 104 from breaking off and being swallowed by a patient (for a patient using the<br>
proper end of the device 100 but inhaling too hard through the device), a free end<br>
104a of the reed 104 can be made large enough that it will not fit through the end of<br>
the housing insert 102a and into the lungs.<br>
If the device 100 is used backwards and the reed vibrates when a patient<br>
inhales, lung secretions can be driven deeper into the lungs. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, to prevent a patient from using the device 100 backwards and vibrating<br>
the reed 104 while inhaling, one or more holes (not shown) can be provided in the<br><br>
housing 102 between the acoustical resistance 106 and the exit end 102e of the<br>
housing 102. The hole(s) can allow enough air to enter the housing 102 to prevent<br>
the reed 104 from vibrating. If a hole is provided in the reed end of the housing 102,<br>
it can be provided between the reed 104 and the acoustical resistance 106.<br>
A powered system (not shown) using the non-powered disposable device 100<br>
also can be encompassed by the present invention. An exemplary powered system<br>
can comprise an external voice coil that drives the reed 104 with a small steel<br>
element added to the tip of the reed 104. The coil can be activated alternately to<br>
vibrate the reed 104. Some potential applications such as an intensive care unit<br>
("ICU") or neonatal lung cleaning may require an externally powered system if the<br>
patient is unable to exhale through the device. Additionally, a powered system can<br>
be useful with unconscious patients or patients with excessive lung secretions or<br>
extensive scarring. Another advantage of the powered system according to the<br>
present invention is that all parts in contact with the patients are disposable.<br>
A powered system should not be used while inhaling, as the lung secretions<br>
can be driven deeper into the lungs. To prevent operation of the system while<br>
inhaling, the powered system can comprise a pressure sensitive flap in the housing<br>
102 mat opens on inhale, thereby reducing the acoustical coupling and the low<br>
frequency efficiency below that necessary to cause vibration of the reed 104.<br>
The unpowered lung vibrating device 100 also can include the intake flap<br>
described above. However, the flap may not be necessary on the unpowered device,<br>
because the reed may not vibrate on inhale and the reed seal makes it difficult to<br>
inhale (if the user is blowing through the right end of the device).<br>
Figure 3 is a side view illustrating a lung vibrating device 300 according to<br>
an alternative exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Figure 4 is a<br><br>
cross-sectional view of the exemplary lung vibrating device 300 illustrated in<br>
Figure 3. As shown, the lung vibrating device 300 comprises a first end cap 302<br>
coupled to a housing 304. The housing 304 can comprise a substantially uniform<br>
cross section, as indicated by the substantially equal heights H1.<br>
The first end cap can comprise a mouth piece through which a patient blows<br>
air in the direction A into the housing 304. A reed 402 is disposed within the<br>
housing 304. The reed 402 comprises a fixed end 402a and a free end 402b. As<br>
shown in the exemplary embodiment of Figure 4, the fixed end 402a can be<br>
compression or friction fitted between the first end cap 302 and the housing 304. In<br>
an exemplary embodiment, one of the housing 304 and the end cap 302 can<br>
comprise a positioning channel (not shown) that positions the reed 402 along a<br>
center of the housing 304. In another exemplary embodiment, one of the housing<br>
304 and the end cap 302 can comprise ribs (not shown) that contact the fixed end<br>
402a of the reed 402 to hold the reed 402 in place. In another exemplary<br>
embodiment, the fixed end 402a of the reed 402 can comprise a T-shape (not shown)<br>
that extends outside the end cap 302. The T-shape can maintain the reed 402 at the<br>
proper position within the housing 304 by preventing the reed 402 from slipping into<br>
the housing 304.<br>
In alternative exemplary embodiments (not shown), the fixed end 402a of the<br>
reed 402 can be glued, sonically welded, or taped to either the end cap 302 or the<br>
housing 304. Any suitable method for coupling the reed to the device is within the<br>
scope of the present invention. In an exemplary embodiment, an entrance opening<br>
of the end cap 302 can be small enough to prevent the reed from exiting the device<br>
and being inhaled by a patient. In an alternative exemplary embodiment, the end<br><br>
cap 302 can comprise vanes (not shown) that reduce the open area of the end cap<br>
302 to prevent the reed from passing therethrough.<br>
The housing 304 can comprise a rectangular or square shape to minimize air<br>
flow around the reed 402. However, the present invention is not limited to only<br>
those shapes and encompasses other shapes. For example, the housing 204 can be<br>
circular, oval, or any other suitable shape. Those shapes may incur a slight<br>
efficiency drop, which can be compensated for by adjusting the acoustical resistance<br>
of the device.<br>
The reed 402 can comprise any material having a suitable stiffness that will<br>
not absorb excessive energy from the vibrations. For example, the reed 402 can<br>
comprise plastic, wood, bone, metal, or combinations of those materials,. In an<br>
. exemplary embodiment, the reed 402 can comprise Mylar. The Mylar thickness can<br>
be in a range of about 3.75 mils to about 10 mils. In the exemplary embodiment of<br>
Figure 4, the reed comprises Mylar having a thickness of about 5 mils and a length<br>
of about 12.25 inches.<br>
The end cap 302 can be shaped externally to allow a patient' mouth to<br>
achieve a suitable seal around the end cap 302. For example, the end cap 302 can<br>
have a circular or oval external shape. Other external shapes that achieve a suitable<br>
seal are within the scope of the present invention. For example, the external shape<br>
can be square or rectangular.<br>
The end cap 302 can be coupled to the housing 304 by various methods. In<br>
an exemplary embodiment, the end cap 302 can be glued or sonically welded to the<br>
housing 302. In an alternative exemplary embodiment, the end cap 302 can be<br>
compression or friction fitted onto the housing 304. In another alternative<br>
exemplary embodiment, the end cap 302 can interlock with the housing 304 through<br><br>
the use of a hook and latch or other suitable type of clipping device. In any case, the<br>
end cap 302 can be coupled to the housing 304 such that the air moving in direction<br>
A will not leak between the end cap 302 and the housing 304 in an amount sufficient<br>
to reduce the effectiveness of the device 300.<br>
In an alternative embodiment (not shown), the housing 304 can be suitably<br>
shaped on its entrance end to perform the function of a mouthpiece. In that<br>
embodiment, the end cap 302 can be omitted.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates a cross-sectional view of the lung vibrating device 300 in<br>
operation according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In<br>
operation, a patient blows air in the direction A into the first end cap 302. As the air<br>
passes in the direction A over the reed 402, the free end 402b of the reed 402<br>
vibrates up and down, as indicated by the arrow B. The vibration produces an<br>
acoustical Shockwave within the housing 304.<br>
An acoustical resistance in the device 300 couples the patient's lungs to the<br>
acoustical shockwave to allow production of low-frequency audio Shockwaves. The<br>
acoustical resistance provides a back pressure of the acoustical shockwave back<br>
through the end cap 302 and into the patient's lungs. In the exemplary embodiment<br>
illustrated in Figures 4 and 5, the acoustical resistance can comprise an air mass<br>
provided in the housing 304. In that exemplary embodiment, a length L and the<br>
height H1 of the housing 304 can comprise a volume sufficient to provide an air<br>
mass large enough to produce the desired acoustical resistance (and back pressure).<br>
Additionally or alternatively, a size or compliance of the reed 402 can<br>
provide the acoustical resistance. For example, the size or compliance of the reed<br>
402 can be increased until the amount of air required to vibrate the reed 402 is<br><br>
sufficient to provide the desired acoustical resistance and back pressure into the<br>
patient's lungs.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates a cross-sectional view of a lung vibrating device 600<br>
according to an alternative exemplary embodiment of the present invention. As<br>
shown, the device 600 comprises the first end cap 302 and a housing 604. The reed<br>
402 is disposed within the housing 604. The housing 604 can have a horn shape,<br>
whereby a first portion has a height H1 and a second portion has a height H2, which<br>
is larger than the height H1. Accordingly, a cross-sectional area of the first portion is<br>
less than a cross sectional area of the second portion. In operation, the free end 402b<br>
of the reed 402 vibrates up and down in the second portion of the housing 604.<br>
Accordingly, the free end 402b has additional space to vibrate up and down.<br>
Additionally, the free end 402b is less likely to contact the housing 604. The horn<br>
shape also increase the air flow through the device. The increased air flow can have<br>
several benefits. For example, the increased air flow can provide additional air that<br>
reduces fogging of the housing by drying condensation that forms on the housing.<br>
Additionally, the increased volume can increase the acoustical resistance of the<br>
device.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates a cross-sectional view of a lung vibrating device 700<br>
according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention. As shown,<br>
the device 700 comprises an end cap 702 and a housing 704. The device 700 also<br>
comprises the reed 402 disposed in the housing 704. The end cap 702 and the<br>
housing 704 can have correspondingly tapered ends 706a, 706b. The tapered ends<br>
can provide an improved compression fit between the end cap 702 and the housing<br>
704. Additionally, the tapered ends 706a, 706b can prevent drawing and excessive<br><br>
amount of the fixed end 402a of the reed 402 out of the housing 704 as the end cap<br>
702 and the housing 704 are pushed together.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates an exit end view of a lung vibrating device according to<br>
an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. As shown, the housing 304 can<br>
comprise four separate pieces coupled together. The pieces can be coupled together<br>
by gluing, sonic welding, taping, or other suitable means. Alternatively, the housing<br>
304 can be molded as a single piece (not shown). The housing 304 can be formed<br>
from plastic, wood, metal, or other suitable material.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, inner surfaces of the housing 304 can<br>
comprise a substantially smooth surface (not shown). In the alternative exemplary<br>
embodiment illustrated in Figure 8, a lower inner surface 802 and an upper inter<br>
surface 804 of the housing 304 can comprise one or more grooves 806. The grooves<br>
806 reduce the surface area of the inner surfaces 802, 806 of the housing 304 that<br>
can contact the reed 402. Accordingly, any condensation that accumulates on the<br>
upper and lower inner surfaces 802, 804 of the housing 304 can collect in the<br>
grooves 806. The free end 402b of the reed 402 contacts a smaller surface area of<br>
the housing 304. Additionally, as shown by the grooves in the upper inner surface<br>
804, the grooves can be rounded to further reduce the surface area contacting the<br>
reed 402. In an alternative exemplary embodiment (not shown), the grooves can be<br>
pointed to provide a minimum surface area that contacts the reed 402. Thus, the<br>
reduced surface area reduces adhesion of the reed 402 to condensation on the inner<br>
surfaces 802, 804 of the housing 304.<br>
The grooves 806 also can provide other benefits. For example, the grooves<br>
806 can provide an air path that will tend to lift the reed off the inner surfaces of the<br>
housing. Additionally, in an exemplary embodiment, a surface of the grooves can<br><br>
be rough (not shown). Moisture is more likely to condense on the rough surface<br>
area in the grooves 806 rather than on the smooth surface area that contacts the reed<br>
402. Accordingly, moisture on the housing surfaces that can contact the reed 402<br>
can be reduced.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the shape of the groove 806 illustrated<br>
in Figure 8. Any suitable shape that reduces the surface area of the housing 304 that<br>
contacts the reed free end 402b is within the scope of the present invention. For<br>
example, the grooves 806 can comprise a semi-circular shape, a V-shape or other<br>
suitable shape. Additionally, the grooves 806 can be provided along the entire<br>
length of the housing 304. Alternatively, the grooves 806 can be provided along<br>
only a portion of the housing 304, or along intermittent portions of the housing 304.<br>
For intermittent portions, the grooves 806 may appear more like individual squares,<br>
rectangles, or other shapes in the inner surfaces of the housing 304.<br>
Figures 9A, 9B, 9C, 9D, 9E, and 9F illustrate alternative, exemplary<br>
embodiments of a weight provided on a free end 904 of a reed 902. In Figure 9A, a<br>
reed 902 is illustrated. The reed 902 can comprise a reed as described above. A<br>
weight can be provided on the reed's free end in the location illustrated by reference<br>
numeral 904.<br>
Figure 9B is a side view illustrating a reed weight 906 according to an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Figure 9C is an end view of the<br>
reed weight 906 illustrated in Figure 9B. As shown in Figures 9B and 9C, the<br>
weight 906 can comprise a weight coupled around the reed 902. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, the weight 906 can comprise tape provided on the end of reed 902.<br>
Figure 9D illustrates an alternative reed weight 908 according to another<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention. As shown, the reed weight 908 can<br><br>
envelop the end of the reed 902. Additionally, the reed weight 908 can have a tip<br>
end 908a that is tapered. In an exemplary embodiment, the tip end 908a can be<br>
thinner than a thickness of the reed 902. The decreased thickness on the tip end<br>
908a can increase the efficiency of the reed 902 to lower the frequency achievable<br>
by the reed 902. In an exemplary embodiment, the thinner tip end of reed weight<br>
908 can be provided by using a tape material having the desired thickness.<br>
Alternatively, the free end of the reed weight 908 can be tapered by grinding, or<br>
notches can be provided in the free end of the reed weight 908 to reduce the surface<br>
area of the end of the reed weight 908. In an exemplary embodiment, the reed<br>
weight can comprise tape having a thickness of about 0.5 to 1.5 mils. In one<br>
exemplary embodiment, the tape can comprise medical tape.<br>
Figure 9E illustrates a reed weight 910 according to another alternative<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The reed weight 910 comprises a<br>
weight disposed on an end of the reed 902. And that exemplary embodiment, the<br>
reed weight can simply increase the thickness and weight of the reed 902 at its free<br>
end. In an exemplary embodiment, the reed weight 910 can comprise a material that<br>
is the same as the reed 902. In an alternative exemplary embodiment, the reed<br>
weight 910 can comprise a material different from the material of the reed, such as<br>
tape. In another exemplary embodiment, the free end of the reed/weight<br>
combination can be tapered or notched as described above.<br>
Figure 9F illustrates a reed weight 912 according to another alternative<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The reed weight 912 can comprise<br>
a double portion of the reed 902. In that regard, the end of reed 902 can be doubled<br>
over onto itself to produce the reed weight 912. In an exemplary embodiment, the<br><br>
free end of the reed/weight combination can be tapered or notched as described<br>
above.<br>
An area of the end of any reed/weight combination can be reduced to<br>
improve the efficiency of the reed 902. The area can be reduced by grinding to taper<br>
the end of the reed weight. Alternatively, the area can be reduced by providing<br>
grooves or holes in the free end of the weight and reed combination. The grooves or<br>
holes remove surface area of the end of the weight, thereby reducing the area.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the reed weight can comprise a first material,<br>
and the reed can comprise a second material. A compliance of the first material can<br>
be in a range of about one-eighth to about one-half of a compliance of the second<br>
material. In another exemplary embodiment, the compliance of the first material can<br>
be about one-fourth of the compliance of the second material. The differing<br>
compliances can increase the efficiency of the reed.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the reed can be exchangeable to allow<br>
replacement after the reed reaches the end of its useful life. Accordingly, the lung<br>
vibrating device can be reconstructed by replacing the reed.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment the reed can comprise, either alone or<br>
with a weight, a wear indicator on its free end. The indicator can indicate to a user<br>
when the reed has reached its useful life and cannot provide the proper operating<br>
frequency. In one embodiment, the reed can comprise an inked indicator that<br>
vibrates off over the useful life of the reed.<br>
Figure 10 is a cross-sectional view of a lung vibrating device 1000 according<br>
to another alternative exemplary embodiment of the present invention. As shown,<br>
the lung vibrating device 1000 comprises an acoustical resistance plug 1002. The<br>
acoustical resistance plug 1002 can comprise a HEPTA filter or a foam plug.<br><br>
Furthermore, the device 1000 can comprise additional acoustical resistances. For<br>
example, the device 1000 can comprise an acoustical resistance produced by a size<br>
of the reed 402, as described above with reference to Figure 4. Additionally, or<br>
alternatively, the device 1000 can comprise an acoustical resistance composed of an<br>
air mass provided in the housing 304, as described above with reference to Figure 4.<br>
Figure 11 is a cross-sectional view of a lung vibrating device 1100 according<br>
to another alternative exemplary embodiment of the present invention. As shown,<br>
the lung vibrating device 1100 can comprise a second end cap 1102 provided on the<br>
housing 304. The second end cap 1102 can function as an acoustical resistance by<br>
restricting the air flow from the housing 304. Additionally, the second end cap 1102<br>
can provide a means to connect the device 1100 to a respirator. In an alternative<br>
exemplary embodiment, the second end cap 1102 can provide a means to connect<br>
the device 1100 to a respirator without serving as an acoustical resistance. When<br>
connected to a respirator, the respirator can draw air through the housing 304 to<br>
drive the reed 402 to produce the acoustical Shockwave in the patient's lungs.<br>
Figure 12 is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary power make up device<br>
1200 for a lung vibrating device according to an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
present invention. As shown, a fan 1202 can push air through a duct 1204 in the<br>
direction of the arrows A. The duct 1204 can comprise an aperture, 1006. An exit<br>
opening of a lung vibrating device 1208 can be provided in proximity to the aperture<br>
1206. The air moving in the direction A within the duct 1204 can draw air in the<br>
direction B through the lung vibrating device 1208. Accordingly, the power make<br>
up device 1200 can produce at least a partial vacuum in the lung vibrating device<br>
1208 by drawing air from the lung vibrating device 1208 in the direction of the<br><br>
arrow B. In an exemplary embodiment, the device 1200 can produce about 1.5<br>
inches of negative water pressure in the lung vibrating device 1208.<br>
As evident to those skilled in the art, the lung vibrating device according to<br>
the present invention can incorporate many features not illustrated in the attached<br>
figures. For example, exemplary embodiments can comprise a space-saving design,<br>
incorporating a foldable, hinged, or telescoping housing. Another embodiment<br>
encompasses a device formed from a thin material that can be crumpled and<br>
disposed.<br>
The lung vibrating device can be used to perform many functions. For<br>
example, the device can be used to induce sputum to clear the lungs or to provide a<br>
diagnostic sample, improve muscillary clearance post operatively, prevent lung<br>
collapse (atelectasis), improve oxygenation, improve lung capacity or lung clearance<br>
in athletes prior to performance, or treat smoke inhalation.<br>
The efficient coupling of an audio source and a body cavity to produce<br>
low-frequency sound can be used for other applications. The acoustical resistance<br>
can be adjusted to provide the proper frequency based on the particular application.<br>
Additionally, the reed can be tuned by changing its size, shape, or material to<br>
provide the proper frequency. For example, other applications can include the<br>
following:<br>
Coronary Plaque: One application can be erosion of coronary arterial plaque<br>
by vibration. An adaptation of the powered system may erode coronary arterial<br>
plaque by internal thoracic vibration, which would be a useful clinical application.<br>
Sinus and Ear: Several variations of the powered and non-powered lung<br>
cleaning systems can be used for sinus drainage and middle ear clearing. Operation<br>
requires a simple frequency adjustment of the lung cleaning system by an<br><br>
adjustment of the acoustical resistance. For uses such as sinus drainage and middle<br>
ear clearing, the systems can operate in a range between about 15 Hz and about<br>
60 Hz with an output of from about 75 dBa to about 100 dBa. The systems also can<br>
operate between about 40 Hz and about 60 Hz, and at about 44 Hz.<br>
Diagnostics: A lung vibrating device according to the present invention can<br>
provide the basis of a sophisticated diagnostic tool for lung diseases such as<br>
pneumonia, COPD, asthma, and lung cancer. The diagnostic system can monitor the<br>
voltage to current phase of the loudspeaker motor and then derive the dynamic<br>
compliance of the lungs at different frequencies and different pressures and<br>
vacuums. Lung compliance varies with different secretion loads and also shows<br>
changes in elasticity caused by long term lung tissue deterioration. Accordingly, the<br>
results can be correlated with existing conditions. Early asymptomatic results also<br>
can be correlated with later disease conditions.<br>
Intestines/Colon: Another application is to efficiently couple a patient's<br>
colon to an audio source to clean the patient's intestines or colon. That application<br>
can remove intestinal blockages, which can prevent such blockages from causing a<br>
dangerous infection.<br>
