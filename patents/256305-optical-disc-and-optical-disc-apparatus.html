DESCRIPTION<br>
OPTICAL DISC AND OPTICAL DISC APPARATUS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to optical discs comprising two information recording<br>
layers with respective test areas. The present invention also relates to optical disc<br>
apparatuses recording data on such optical discs. The test areas are used in the adjustment<br>
of the conditions for driving, for example, the learning of recording conditions.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] In recent years, densities and capacities of optical discs have been increasing, and<br>
higher reliability thereof have been becoming important. In order to secure such higher<br>
reliability, optical disc apparatuses which record or reproduce data on or from such optical<br>
discs perform recording learning in order to obtain recording and reproduction conditions for<br>
optical discs (cf. Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. 2001-338422).<br>
Recording learning is a series of operations to optimize the pulse conditions of laser<br>
pulses which strike an optical disc. The pulse conditions include, for example, the power<br>
levels of the laser pulses which strike the optical disc during recording, the conditions for<br>
timing and lengths of the laser pulses, and the like.<br>
Other techniques under active development include providing an optical disc with an<br>
additional semitransparent information recording layer located in front of an original<br>
information recording layer in the direction of optical beams used in recording and<br>
reproduction, and thereby doubling the recording capacity of the optical disc. Such a<br>
dual-layer optical disc also requires recording learning. Operations of learning recording<br>
conditions are performed at the front layer (hereinafter, L1 layer) and the back layer<br>
(hereinafter, L0 layer) in the optical beam direction (cf. Japanese Laid-Open Publication<br>
No. 2000-311346).<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] (Problems to be solved by the invention)<br>
However, there is a risk of failing to extract optimal recording conditions at the L0<br>
layer in the conventional recording learning. More specifically, operations of recording<br>
learning may record a test signal by using a test recording power excessively higher than a<br><br><br>
recording power which is appropriate for recording data (hereinafter, Pwol). An optical<br>
beam with such a test recording power may be affected, for example, its intensity may be<br>
changed while it passes through the L1 layer, even if the presence or absence of data<br>
recorded on the L1 layer does not affect the recording quality of the L0 layer when<br>
optical beams with the recording power Pwol are used. Thus, an optimal level of the<br>
recording power for the L0 layer (hereinafter, the Pwo0) may not be obtained.<br>
The present invention is to solve the above-described problems. An object of the present<br>
invention is to provide optical discs that comprise two recordable information recording<br>
layers and allow precise recording learning on both of the layers. Another object of the<br>
present invention is to provide optical disc apparatuses which perform recording learning<br>
using such optical discs.<br>
WO 2005/001825 Al, EP 1 693 836 Al and EP 1 607 948 Al are publications related to<br>
applications filed earlier than and published after the priority date of the present<br>
invention.<br>
WO 2005/001825 A1 is related to an information storage medium having a plurality of<br>
information storage layers, each of which includes an optimal power control (OPC) area<br>
for obtaining an optimal recording condition, wherein OPC areas in odd-numbered and<br>
even-numbered information storage layers are disposed not to face each other and not to<br>
contact each other, or partially overlap each other and lock out use of the overlapped<br>
portion. Therefore, when an OPC area of one information storage layer performs OPC,<br>
this OPC does not affect another information storage layer.<br>
EP 1 693 836 Al is related to a recording method, a recording apparatus, and a storage<br>
medium which determine an optimum recording power value by performing test writing<br>
on a test zone of a recording medium and record information on the recording medium<br>
with the determined optimum recording power, wherein the recording medium is a<br>
multilayer recording medium having multiple recording layers within one recording<br>
surface; the test zone is formed on each recording layer; and when information is to be<br><br>
recorded on a target recording layer that is second or further from a light source,<br>
information is recorded on a portion, which is positioned in the same recording surface<br>
area as that of the test zone, of an upper recording layer that is closer to the light source<br>
than the target recording layer before the test writing is performed on the test zone in the<br>
target recording layer.<br>
An optical recording apparatus according to EP 1 607 948 A1 can maintain a stable<br>
recording quality when recording information using an optical disc having recording<br>
layers of a multilayer structure according to a constant liner velocity method. When<br>
recording information using an optical disc having a recording layer of a multilayer<br>
structure according to a constant liner velocity method, a state of the information<br>
recording area of a first layer of the recording layers and a state of PCA of the first layer<br>
of the recording layers are caused to be the same. Thereafter, an OPC process by OPC<br>
means is performed on the PCA of a second layer of the recording layer. Thereby, when<br>
recording information using an optical disc having a recording layer of a multilayer<br>
structure according to a constant liner velocity method, an optimum recording power in<br>
an OPC operation can be obtained under the same condition as an information recording<br>
operation.<br>
An optical information recording medium according to EP 1 318 509 Al includes a first<br>
information recording layer on which information is to be recorded by laser light; and a<br>
second information recording layer on which information is to be recorded by the laser<br>
light which has passed through the first information recording layer. The first<br>
information recording layer includes at least one of a reproduction-only area and a<br>
recording and reproduction area. The second information recording layer includes a test<br>
recording area. At least one of the reproduction-only area and the recording and<br>
reproduction area, and the test recording area is located such that one of the reproduction-<br>
only area and the recording and reproduction area includes an area of the first information<br>
recording layer through which the laser light for recording information in the test<br>
recording area passes.<br><br><br>
(Means for solving the problems)<br>
The optical disc according to the present invention is an optical disc comprising<br>
first and second information recording layers on which user data can be recorded,<br>
wherein data is recorded and reproduced through the same light incidence side of the<br>
optical disc on the first and second information recording layers. The first information<br>
recording layer includes a first test area located at an inner radius, a second test area<br>
located at an outer radius, and a first data recording area on which user data is recorded.<br>
The second information recording layer includes a third test area located at an inner<br>
radius, a fourth test area located at an outer radius, and a second data recording area n<br>
which user data is recorded. The first test area and the third test area are located at<br>
different radiuses and do not overlap each other. The second test area and the fourth test<br>
area are located at equal radiuses. Thus, the above-described objects can be achieved.<br>
For example, the first information recording layer maybe a layer further away<br>
from the light incidence side and the second information recording layer may be a layer<br>
closer to the light incidence side. The first test area and the third test area may be areas<br>
used in the learning of recording conditions on the inner radiuses. The second test area<br>
and the fourth test area may be areas used in the learing of recording conditions on the<br>
outer radiuses.<br>
The first test area and the third test area are located at different radiuses and do<br>
not overlap each other; and the second test area and the fourth test area are located at<br>
equal radiuses.<br>
The first information recording layer may include a read-only control data area.<br>
In addition, the third test area may be located at a position opposite to the control data<br>
area.<br>
The control data area may have an embossed pit, a wobble groove, or a wobble<br>
pit which represents predetermined control data.<br>
The control data area, the first test area, and the first data recording area may be<br>
located in this order from the inner radius on the first information recording layer. The<br><br><br>
third test area and the second data recording area may be locates in this order from the<br>
inner radius in the second information recording layer.<br>
The distance between the innermost radius R1 of the first test area and the outermost<br>
radius R2 of the third test area may be equal to or greater than the sum of track<br>
eccentricities of the first information recording layer and the second information<br>
recording layer.<br>
The distance between the radius R1 and the radius R2 may be equal to or greater than a<br>
distance corresponding to the sum of the track eccentricities of the first information<br>
recording layer and the second information recording layer plus a beam radius of reading<br>
light on the second information recording layer when the reading light converges on the<br>
first information recording layer.<br>
The distance between the radius R1 and the radiusR2 may be equal to or greater than a<br>
distance corresponding to the sum of the track eccentricities of the first information<br>
recording layer and the second information recording layer plus the sum of radial<br>
tolerances of the track starting ends of the first information recording layer and the<br>
second information recording layer.<br>
The distance from the light incidence side to the first information recording layer may be<br>
equal to the distance between a light incidence side and an information recording layer of<br>
an optical disc comprising a single information recording layer.<br><br><br>
The control data area may store control data concerning both the first information<br>
recording layer and the second information recording layer.<br>
Writing into the test areas may be performed continuously from the inner radius to the<br>
outer radius, or vice versa.<br>
Data may be written continuously from the first information recording layer, which is<br>
located further from the light incidence side, to the second information recording layer,<br>
which is located closer to the light incidence side.<br>
An optical disc apparatus according to the present invention is an optical disc apparatus<br>
configured to record data on the above-described optical disc, and comprises an optical<br>
head, an optical head driver unit, and a control unit. The optical head is configured to<br>
irradiate the optical disc with light, and output a signal in response to light reflected from<br>
the optical disc. The optical head driver unit is configured to drive the optical head under<br>
predetermined recording conditions. The control unit is configured to control the optical<br>
head driver unit in response to the signal received from the optical head. The control unit<br>
performs recording learning at the first test area and the third test area which are located<br>
at different radiuses and do not overlap each other, and at the second test area and the<br>
fourth test area which are located at equal radiuses, and thereby determines<br>
respective recording conditions for the first information recording layer and the<br><br><br>
second information recording layer.<br>
(Effect of the invention)<br>
In the dual-layer optical disc of the present invention, the first test area and the third<br>
test area do not overlap each other. Thus, appropriate recording learning is possible at the<br>
information recording layer located further from the light incidence side, even if the intensity<br>
of optical beams is affected by the recorded conditions of the information recording layer<br>
located closer to the light incidence side while the optical beams pass through the information<br>
recording layer.<br>
Since the second test area and the fourth test area are located at the outer radiuses of<br>
the data recording areas, recording learning can also be performed on the outer radiuses.<br>
This allows the recording of high quality data throughout the data recording areas.<br>
Furthermore, since the second test area and the fourth test area overlap each other,<br>
the decrease in the recording capacity of the data recording areas can be reduced.<br>

and the L1 layer, and a control data area consisting of an embossed pit, a wobble grove, or a<br>
wobble pit on the L0 layer, which is a reference layer. The test area of the LI layer is<br>
located at a position opposite to the control data area of the L0 layer.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the<br>
drawings.<br>
(Embodiment 1)<br>
Figure 1 shows a configuration of an optical disc 101 according to Embodiment 1 of<br>
the present invention, particularly a configuration of a first information recording layer.<br>
On the optical disc 101, a plurality of tracks 102 are formed concentrically.<br>
Alternatively, a single track 102 or a plurality of tracks 102 may be formed in a spiral pattern<br>
on the optical disc 101.<br>
The areas of the optical disc 101 include a pre-record area 103 and a recordable area<br>
104.<br>
The pre-record area 103 stores various parameters which are required to access the<br>
optical disc 101.<br>
Recording learning, recording of user data, and reproduction of user data are<br>
performed at the recordable area 104.<br>
Figure 2 shows a structure of a dual-layer optical disc according to the present<br>
invention.<br><br>
In FIG. 2, number 201 indicates a substrate, number 202 indicates a first information<br>
recording layer, number 203 indicates a spacing layer of an adhesive resin or the like, number<br>
204 indicates a second information recording layer, and number 205 indicates a transparent<br>

Data is recorded on and reproduced from the first information recording layer (L0 layer) 202<br>
and the second information recording layer (L1 layer) 204.<br>
In the dual-layer optical disc according to the present embodiment, the first<br>
information recording layer 202 is located at the same (axial) position with respect to the<br>
light incidence side as an information recording layer of a single-layer optical disc (not<br>
shown), which has only one information recording layer.<br>
On the first information recording layer 202 and the second information recording<br>
layer 204, one or more tracks may be formed into a spiral pattern.<br>
Figure 3 shows an arrangement of areas located on the dual-layer optical disc shown<br>
in FIG. 2.<br>
A pre-record area 301a of the first information recording layer is an area on which<br>
data such as identification data of the dual-layer optical disc is recorded in a wobble pattern<br>
of a track, embossed pits, a wobble pattern of embossed pits, or the like, which are formed on<br>
the substrate 201 or the spacing layer 203.<br>
The pre-record area 301a includes a protect area 303a which serves as a buffer, and a<br>
control data area 304a which stores at least one of the following data as the identification<br>
information of the optical disc; a disc type, a disc size, a disc configuration, a channel bit,<br>
data zone allocation information, recording linear speed, maximum reproducible power,<br>
recording power information, recording pulse information, and disc intrinsic information.<br>
The control data area 304a includes data concerning both the first information<br>
recording layer and the second information recording layer.<br>
A pre-record area 301b of the second information recording layer includes a protect<br>
area 303 b which serves as a buffer.<br>
A recordable area 302a of the first information recording layer includes: a protect<br>
area 305a which can be also used as a track pitch transition area when the pre-record area<br>
301a and the recordable area 302a have different track pitches; a first test area 306a; a buffer<br>
area 307a; a drive management information area 308a used for the storage of data on various<br>
properties and the like of the optical disc; a buffer area 309a; a user data recording area 310a<br>
where user data and the like are recorded; a second test area 315a; a buffer area 311a; a<br>
reserve area 312a for use in future expansion; a buffer area 313a; and a protect area 314a.<br><br><br>
A recordable area 302b of the second information recording layer includes a third<br>
test area 304b and a protect area 305b. The protect area 305b is located at the same radius<br>
as the protect area 305a of the first information recording layer.<br>
The third test area 304b of the second information recording layer is located at the<br>
same radius as the control data area 304a of the first information recording layer, or the outer<br>
radiuses thereof are the same.<br>
The recordable area 302b of the second information recording layer includes a<br>
reserve area 306b for use in future expansion, a buffer area 307b, and a reserve area 308b,<br>
which are respectively located at the same radiuses as the first test area 306a, the buffer area<br>
307a, and the drive management information area 308a of the first information recording<br>
layer.<br>
The recordable area 302b of the second information recording layer includes a buffer<br>
area 309b, a user data recording area 310b where user data and the like are recorded, a fourth<br>
test area 315b, a buffer area 31 lb, a reserve area 312b for use in future expansion, a buffer<br>
area 313b, and a protect area 314b, which are respectively located at the same radiuses as the<br>
buffer area 309a, the user data recording area 310a, the second test area 315a, the buffer area<br>
311a, the reserve area 312a for use in further expansion, the buffer area 313a, and the protect<br>
area 314a of the first information recording layer.<br>
Figure 4 is an arrangement diagram showing the radiuses of the main areas of the<br>
optical disc as described above.<br>
An upper portion of FIG. 4 shows the protect area 303a, the control data area 304a,<br>
the protect area 305a, the first test area 306a, the buffer area 307a, the drive management<br>
information area 308a, the buffer area 309a, the user data recording area 310a, and the second<br>
test area 315a of the first information recording layer. A lower portion of FIG. 4 shows the<br>
protect area 303b, the third test area 304b, the protect area 305b, the reserve area 306b, the<br>
buffer area 307b, the reserve area 308b, the buffer area 309b, the user data recording area<br>
310b, and the fourth test area 315b of the second information recording layer.<br>
The third test area 304b is located at a radius opposite to (i.e. a radius which<br>
overlaps) the control data area 304a. The outermost radius R2 of the third test area 304b is<br>
equal to the outermost radius of the control data area 304a, and the innermost radius thereof<br>
is equal to or larger than the innermost radius of the control data area 304a. The control data<br>
on the control data area 304a is reproduced by irradiating pits or a wobble pattern of a track<br>
with optical beams and detecting the intensity of reflected light. Thus, fluctuations of the<br>
intensity of the optical beams hardly affect the quality of reproduction signals representing<br><br><br>
the control data, even if the optical beams passing through the second information recording<br>
layer are changed in intensity depending on the recorded conditions on the third test area<br>
304b.<br>
The third test area 304b is located at a radius different from that of the first test area<br>
306a. Thus, recording learning for the first layer can be properly performed without<br>
affecting the first test area 306a.<br>
The fourth test area 315b is located at substantially the same radius as and opposite<br>
to the second test area 315a. This is allowed because recording learning is performed for<br>
the second test area 315a and the fourth test area 315b at the outer radiuses after recording<br>
learning has been performed for the first test area 306a and the third test area 304b at the<br>
inner radiuses, and accordingly, recording learning for the second test area 315a and the<br>
fourth test area 315b uses recording power close to the optimum power, and hardly affects the<br>
other layers, such as transmittance changes or the like. The above arrangement allows<br>
recording learning at the outer radiuses to compensate for changes in recording characteristics<br>
at the outer radiuses, which are due to tilt or the like, and achieve better recording quality<br>
throughout the surface of the disc. In addition, the allocation of the two test areas at the<br>
same radius can suppress the reduction in recording capacity for user data caused by the two<br>
test areas.<br>
The optical disc according to the present embodiment is a dual-layer disc. Here, a<br>
single-layer optical disc, which includes only a first information recording layer, requires no<br>
area to avoid an influence caused by the test area of the second information recording layer,<br>
since the single-layer disc does not include a second information recording layer. In the<br>
optical disc of the present embodiment, the control data area 304a is located at the radius<br>
which overlaps the third test area 304b. Thus, the first information recording layer requires<br>
no additional area opposite to the third test area 304b. This allows the optical disc of the<br>
present embodiment to have the same arrangement of areas as the single-layer optical disc as<br>
described above. For example, the innermost radiuses R0 of the user data recording area<br>
310a and 310b can be matched with that in the signal-layer optical disc. Accordingly, the<br>
recording capacity for user data is not reduced. In addition, the radius and the address of the<br>
user data recording area are the same between the signal-layer optical disc and the dual-layer<br>
optical disc. This facilitates access of the optical disc apparatus by using optical beams in<br>
recording and reproduction operations, and allows the optical disc to avoid reduction in<br>
recording capacity for user data and the like.<br>
The protect area 305a is located between the control data area 304a and the first test<br><br><br>
area 306a. The protect area 305a has a width corresponding to the difference between the<br>
innermost radius R1 of the first test area 306a and the outermost radius R2 of the third test<br>
area 304b.<br>
The width of the protect area 305a (R1-R2) is set in view of the track eccentricity<br>
Ael of the first information recording layer, the track eccentricity Ae2 of the second<br>
information recording layer, the beam radius D of laser light on one information recording<br>
layer when the laser light converges on the other information recording layer, the radial<br>
tolerance Arl of the track starting end of the first information recording layer, the radial<br>
tolerance Ar2 of the track starting end of the second information recording layer, and the like.<br>
More specifically, as shown in FIG. 5, the width of the protect area 305 a (R1-R2) is<br>
determined such that the first test area 306a and the third test area 304b are located at the<br>
radiuses where they do not overlap each other even if the tracks of the information recording<br>
layers have the eccentricities ∆e1 and ∆e2, respectively. That is, the width of the protect<br>
area 305a (R1-R2) is determined to be ∆e1 + ∆e2 or longer. Furthermore, as shown in FIG.<br>
6, the width of the protect area 305a (R1-R2) is determined such that the first test area 306a<br>
and the third test area 304b are located at the radiuses where they do not overlap each other<br>
even if the radiuses of the track starting ends on the information recording layers have the<br>
tolerances ∆r1 and ∆r2, respectively. That is, the width of the protect area 305a (R1-R2) is<br>
determined to be ∆r1 + ∆r2 or longer. Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 7, the width of the<br>
protect area 305a (R1-R2) is determined such that the test area of one of the layers is not<br>
irradiated with the laser light converging on the test area on the other of the layers. That is,<br>
the width of the protect area 305a (R1-R2) is determined to be D or longer.<br>
In this way, even if there are the track eccentricity and the tolerance, the first test<br>
area 306a and the third test area 304b do not overlap each other, and thereby, recording<br>
learning can be properly performed. Generally, the two layers may have track eccentricities<br>
and tolerances in opposite directions, and they may have both at the same time. In order to<br>
prepare for the worst, the width of the protect area 305a (R1-R2) is set to be ∆e1 + ∆e2 + ∆r1<br>
+ ∆r2 + D or larger.<br>
In this configuration, the control data area 304a stores media intrinsic information<br>
such as recording pulses of both the first information recording layer and the second<br>
information recording layer. Thus, all the identification information can be obtained if the<br>
first information recording layer is accessed at the first step. This offers an advantage that<br>
the startup operations of the optical disc drive becomes faster.<br><br><br>
Generally, the optical disc apparatuses for recording and reproducing user data on<br>
and from the dual-layer optical disc according to the present embodiment can record and<br>
reproduce user data also on and from a signal-layer optical disc. In the dual-layer optical<br>
disc according to the present embodiment, the control data area 304a is located on the first<br>
information recording layer at the same position with respect to the light incidence side as the<br>
information recording layer of the signal-layer optical disc. When this dual-layer optical<br>
disc is loaded into an optical disc apparatus, the control data area 304a allows the optical<br>
beams to strike thereon under the same optical conditions. This results in an effect in which<br>
the identification information can be read smoothly.<br>
(Embodiment 2)<br>
Figure 8 is an arrangement diagram showing the radiuses of the main areas of the<br>
optical disc according to another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
An upper portion of FIG. 8 shows a protect area 503a, a control data area 504a, a<br>
protect area 505a, a first test area 506a, a buffer area 507a, a drive management information<br>
area 508a, a buffer area 509a, a user data recording area 510a, and a second test area 515a of<br>
the first information recording layer. A lower portion of FIG. 8 shows a protect area 503b, a<br>
third test area 504b, a reserve area 505b, a protect area 506b, a reserve area 507b, a buffer<br>
area 508b, a reserve area 509b, a buffer area 510b, a user data recording area 511b, and a<br>
fourth test area 515b of the second information recording layer. Other components of the<br>
structure and the contents of these areas are substantially the same as those of the dual-layer<br>
optical disc of Embodiment 1 as shown in FIG. 3. Thus, details thereof are omitted.<br>
The third test area 504b is located at the radius opposite to the control data area 504a.<br>
The innermost radius R3 thereof is equal to or larger than the innermost radius R4 of the<br>
control data area 504a. The outermost radius R5 thereof is smaller than the outermost radius<br>
of the control data area 504a. The control data on the control data area 504a is reproduced<br>
by irradiating pits or wobble patterns of a track with optical beams and detecting the amount<br>
of reflected light. Thus, fluctuations of the intensity of the optical beams hardly affect the<br>
quality of reproduction signals representing the control data, even if the optical beams<br>
passing through the second information recording layer are changed in intensity depending on<br>
the recorded conditions on the third test area 504b.<br>
The third test area 504b is located at a radius different from that of the first test area<br>
506a. Thus, recording learning for the first layer can be properly performed without<br>
affecting the first test area 506a.<br><br><br>
The fourth test area 515b is located at substantially the same radius as and opposite<br>
to the second test area 515a. This is allowed because recording learning is performed for<br>
the second test area 515a and the fourth test area 515b at the outer radiuses after recording<br>
learning has been performed for the first test area 506a and the third test area 504b at the<br>
inner radiuses, and accordingly, recording learning for the second test area 515a and the<br>
fourth test area 515b uses recording power close to the optimum power, and hardly affects the<br>
other layers, such as transmittance changes or the like. The above arrangement allows<br>
recording learning at the outer radiuses to compensate for changes in recording characteristics<br>
at the outer radiuses, which are due to tilt or the like, and achieve better recording quality<br>
throughout the surface of the disc. In addition, the allocation of the two test areas at the<br>
same radius can suppress the reduction in recording capacity for user data caused by the two<br>
test areas.<br>
The optical disc according to the present embodiment is a dual-layer disc. Here, a<br>
single-layer optical disc, which includes only a first information recording layer, does not<br>
require an area to avoid the influence caused by the test area of the second information<br>
recording layer, since the single-layer disc does not include a second information recording<br>
layer. In the optical disc of the present embodiment, the control data area 504a is located at<br>
the radius to overlap the third test area 504b. Thus, the first information recording layer<br>
requires no additional area opposing the third test area 504b. This allows the optical disc of<br>
the present embodiment to have the same arrangement of areas as the single-layer optical disc<br>
as described above. For example, the innermost radiuses R0 of the user data recording area<br>
510a and 511b can be matched with that in the signal-layer optical disc. Accordingly, the<br>
recording capacity for user data is not reduced. In addition, the radius and the address of the<br>
user data recording area are the same between the signal-layer optical disc and the dual-layer<br>
optical disc. This facilitates access of the optical disc apparatus by using optical beams in<br>
recording and reproduction operations.<br>
Furthermore, the reserve area 505b is located adjacent and outside of the third test<br>
area 504b. The reserve area 505b and the protect area 506b constitute a spacing (R1-R5)<br>
between the innermost radius R1 of the first test area 506a and the outermost radius R5 of the<br>
third test area 504b. The spacing (R1-R5) is set in view of the track eccentricity Ae1 of the<br>
first information recording layer, the track eccentricity Ae2 of the second information<br>
recording layer, the beam radius D of laser light on one information recording layer when the<br>
laser light converges on the other information recording layer, the radial tolerance Ar1 of the<br><br><br>
track starting end of the first information recording layer, the radial tolerance Ar2 of the track<br>
starting end of the second information recording layer, and the like. More specifically, as<br>
described in Embodiment 1, the spacing (R1-R5) is determined to be equal to or greater than<br>
∆e1 + ∆e2, ∆r1 + ∆r2, or D.<br>
In this way, even if there are track eccentricity and tolerance, the first test area 506a<br>
and the third test area 504b do not overlap each other, and thereby, recording learning can be<br>
properly performed. Generally, the two layers may have track eccentricities and tolerances<br>
in opposite directions, and they may have both at the same time. In order to prepare for the<br>
worst, the spacing (R1-R5) is set to be ∆e1 + ∆e2 + ∆r1 + ∆r2 + D or larger.<br>
Furthermore, in the optical disc of this embodiment, a desired spacing may be<br>
provided between the two test areas by using not only the protect area 506b but also the<br>
reserve area 505b. This allows the protect area 505a and the protect area 506b to be reduced<br>
in width, and thus, the reduction in recording capacity for user data or the like to be further<br>
suppressed.<br>
In this configuration, the control data area 504a stores media intrinsic information<br>
such as recording pulses of both the first information recording layer and the second<br>
information recording layer. Thus, all the identification information can be obtained if the<br>
first information recording layer is accessed at the first step. This offers an advantage that<br>
the startup operations of the optical disc drive becomes faster.<br>
For the optical discs shown in Embodiments 1 and 2, the recording and reproduction<br>
direction may be determined as indicated by arrows 316a and 316b in FIG. 3. In the first<br>
information recording layer, user data may be continuously recorded from the inner radius to<br>
the outer radius until the user data recording area of the first information recording layer<br>
becomes full, and then user data may be recorded from the outer radius to the inner radius of<br>
the second information recording layer. In this case, the optical beams pass through the<br>
second information recording layer in a blank condition at the recording of user data on the<br>
first information recording layer. This allows a wider range of choices of materials for the<br>
second information recording layer, and in particular, the use of a recording material which<br>
may affect the transmitting light under the blank condition even if the optimal recording<br>
power Pwol is used. Even if such a recording material is used, the first test area 506a and<br>
the third test area 504b in the above configuration do not overlap each other as described<br>
above. Needless to say, recording learning is properly performed. Application of this<br>
configuration is more effective especially for write-once optical discs which allow recording<br><br><br>
only once, since recording generally continues from the inner radiuses to the outer radiuses,<br>
or vice versa.<br>
Alternatively, the writing onto each of the test areas may be required to continue in<br>
the direction from the inner radiuses to the outer radiuses, or vice versa. This offers an<br>
advantage in that blank regions in each of the test areas are easy to recognize especially in<br>
write-once optical discs. Of course, target portions for recording and reproduction may be<br>
selected from the entire disc at random, without determining the recording and reproduction<br>
direction.<br>
In the above Embodiments 1 and 2, the pre-record areas, especially the control data<br>
areas 304a and 504a may have track pitches wider than the recordable areas in order to<br>
stabilize the reproduction of identification information. In this case, the track pitches of the<br>
protect areas 303b and 503b may be equal to the recordable areas, since the pre-record areas<br>
of the second information recording layer includes only the protect areas 303b and 503b.<br>
In Embodiments 1 and 2, a buffer area may be provided within the test areas. Any<br>
data may be written into the protect areas, the reserve areas, and the buffer areas.<br>
(Embodiment 3)<br>
An optical disc apparatus for recording data on the optical discs described in<br>
Embodiments 1 and 2 will be described with reference to FIGS. 9 and 10.<br>
Figure 9 is a block diagram showing an overview of the optical disc apparatus 600.<br>
In FIG. 9, number 601 indicates an optical disc. The optical disc 601 has the<br>
configuration as described in Embodiment 1 or 2. Note that the optical disc apparatus 600<br>
may be able to record data on an optical disc having a conventional configuration, for<br>
example, a single-layer optical disc.<br>
Number 602 indicates a semiconductor laser; number 603 indicates a collimator<br>
lens; number 604 indicates a beam splitter; number 605 indicates a convergence unit; number<br>
606 indicates a light-gathering lens; number 607 indicates a photodetection unit; number 608<br>
indicates a reproduction signal computing unit; number 609 indicates a focusing control unit;<br>
number 610 indicates a tracking control unit; number 611 indicates an actuator; number 612<br>
indicates a controller; number 613 indicates a laser driver unit; and number 615 indicates a<br>
signal processing unit.<br>
An optical head consists of the semiconductor laser 602, the collimator lens 603, the<br>
beam splitter 604, the convergence means 605, the light-gathering lens 606, the<br>
photodetection unit 607, the actuator 611, and the like. An optical head driver unit consists<br><br><br>
of the focusing control unit 609, the tracking control unit 610, the laser driver unit 613, and<br>
the like. A control unit consists of the reproduction signal computing unit 608, the<br>
controller 612, and the like.<br>
Next, reproduction operations will be described.<br>
The optical disc 601 is, for example, an optical disc having two information surfaces.<br>
An optical spot is focused on one of the two information surfaces of the optical disc 601, a<br>
target for data reading.<br>
The optical beam emitted from the semiconductor laser 602 passes through the<br>
collimator lens 603, the beam splitter 604, and the convergence unit 605, and converges on<br>
one of the two information surfaces on the optical disc 601. The focused optical spot is<br>
reflected and diffracted by the optical disc 601, and passes through the convergence unit 605,<br>
the beam splitter 604, and the light-gathering lens 606, and converges on the photodetection<br>
unit 607. The converging light is converted into voltage signal outputs depending on the<br>
intensity of the light on each of photoreceptor devices A, B, C, and D on the photodetection<br>
unit. The voltage signal is manipulated by the reproduction signal computing unit (circuit)<br>
608.<br>
FE signals, outputs of the reproduction signal computing unit 608, are sent to the<br>
focusing control unit 609. TE signals, outputs of the reproduction signal computing unit<br>
608, are sent to the tracking control unit 610. RF signals, outputs of the reproduction signal<br>
computing unit 608, are sent to the controller 612.<br>
The focusing control unit 609 drives the actuator 611 by using voltage outputs in<br>
response to the FE signals, and thereby controls the focusing of the optical spot on one of the<br>
two information surfaces of the optical disc 601.<br>
The tracking control unit 610 drives the actuator 611 by using voltage outputs in<br>
response to the TE signals, and thereby controls the tracking of the optical spot to a desired<br>
track position on one of the two information surfaces of the optical disc 601. By using the<br>
optical spot under the focusing and tracking controls, data is read from an optical disc,<br>
especially from pre-pits, projections and depressions on the optical disc, or marks and spaces,<br>
light and dark regions with different reflectivities on the phase-change optical disc.<br>
The controller 612 detects from the RF signals on which of the two information<br>
surfaces on the optical disc 601 the optical spot is focused. More specifically, the controller<br>
612 detects from address values on which surface the optical spot is focused. The controller<br>
612 controls the focusing control unit 609, the tracking control unit 610, and the laser driver<br>
unit 613.<br><br><br>
Steps of the learning of recording conditions will be described with reference to FIG.<br>
10.<br>
When the learning of recording conditions is necessary, the controller 612 instructs<br>
the focusing control unit 609 and the tracking control unit 610 to access the first test area of<br>
the first information recording layer (step 701).<br>
Next, the controller 612 instructs the laser driver unit 613, the focusing control unit<br>
609, and the tracking control unit 610 to learn recording conditions for the first test area.<br>
For example, the laser driver unit 613 is instructed to perform test writing at various levels of<br>
recording power and determine the optimal recording power; the focusing control unit 609 is<br>
instructed to perform test writing at various focus positions and determine the optimal focus<br>
position; the tracking control unit 610 is instructed to perform test writing at various tracking<br>
positions and determine the optimal tracking position; and the like (step 702).<br>
Then, the controller 612 instructs the focusing control unit 609 and the tracking<br>
control unit 610 to access the third test area of the second information recording layer (step<br>
703).<br>
Then, the controller 612 instructs the laser driver unit 613, the focusing control unit<br>
609, and the tracking control unit 610 to learn recording conditions for the third test area.<br>
For example, the laser driver unit 613 is instructed to perform test writing at various levels of<br>
recording power and determine the optimal recording power; the focusing control unit 609 is<br>
instructed to perform test writing at various focus positions and determine the optimal focus<br>
position; the tracking control unit 610 is instructed to perform test writing at various tracking<br>
positions and determine the optimal tracking position; and the like (step 704).<br>
The steps of the learning of recording conditions shown in FIG. 10 may be<br>
performed whenever the learning of recording conditions is necessary.<br>
