				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a virus<br>
growth inhibition and/or virucidal method characterized<br>
in that it uses a pyrazine nucleotide or pyrazine<br>
nucleoside analog generated by kinase or a salt<br>
thereof, a novel pyrazine nucleotide or pyrazine<br>
nucleoside analog or a salt thereof, and a method for<br>
treating virus infection using them.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Infectious virus diseases (e.g., influenza<br>
infection, herpesvirus infection, acquired<br>
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), viral hepatitis,<br>
viral hemorrhagic fever, etc.) have been recognized to<br>
be medically important problems, and a wide range of<br>
treatments such as prevention of the diseases with<br>
vaccines or therapeutic methods of using drugs have<br>
been studied. A large number of nucleic acids having<br>
purine bases and pyrimidine bases and derivatives<br>
thereof have been developed to date as agents used for<br>
drug treatment of virus infections. These agents have<br>
an action mechanism such that they are<br>
triphosphorylated in cells and inhibit virus<br>
polymerase. Examples of such agents may include<br>
azidothymidine and acyclovir [Proceedings of the<br>
National Academy of Science of the United States of<br>
America (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA), Vol. 83, pp. 8333<br>
to 8337 (1986); the same publication, Vol. 74, pp. 5716<br>
to 5720 (1977)].<br>
Moreover, it has been reported that the<br>
active form of a compound whose antiviral effect is<br>
exhibited when its portion corresponding to bases of<br>
nucleic acid is converted into an unnatural chemical<br>
structure is a monophosphorylated form obtained by<br>
converting the compound in a cell, and that it inhibits<br>
inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) in the<br>
cell, thereby exhibiting effects. Examples of such a<br>
compound may include ribavirin and EICAR [Proceedings<br>
of the National Academy of Science of the United States<br>
of America (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA), Vol. 70, pp.<br>
1174 to 1178 (1973); The Journal of Biological<br>
Chemistry (J. Biol. Chem.), Vol. 268, pp. 24591 to<br>
24598 (1993)].<br>
Moreover, as an example of nucleoside and<br>
nucleotide analogs having a pyrazine ring as a base,<br>
the following general formula has been known:<br>
wherein R16 represents a hydrogen atom, a methyl group<br>
or decyl group. However, this compound exhibits no<br>
antiviral activity (no anti-Visna virus activity)<br>
[Nucleosides &amp; Nucleotides, Vol. 15, Nos. 11 and 12,<br>
pp.. 1849 to 1861 (1996) ] .<br>
On the other hand, nucleoside and nucleotide<br>
analogs having a pyrazine ring that is substituted with<br>
a carbamoyl group have not been known.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to<br>
provide a highly safe antiviral agent with low<br>
toxicity, which has an unnatural chemical structure in<br>
a portion corresponding to bases of nucleic acid, and a<br>
novel virus growth inhibition and/or virucidal method<br>
using the antiviral agent.<br>
The present inventors have found that a<br>
pyrazine nucleotide or pyrazine nucleoside analog<br>
represented by the following general formula [1] or a<br>
salt thereof:<br>
wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom, or a substituent<br>
of a pyrazine ring; R2 represents a hydrogen atom, an<br>
acyl group, or a carbamoylalkyl or carboxyalkyl group<br>
that may be substituted; each of R3, R4, Rs and R6<br>
identically or differently represents a hydrogen atom,<br>
or a hydroxyl group that may be substituted or<br>
protected; A represents an oxygen atom or a methylene<br>
group; Y represents an oxygen atom or an imino group;<br>
and n represents an integer of 0 to 3, especially, a<br>
triphosphorylated pyrazine nucleotide analog or a salt<br>
thereof exhibits a highly safe, excellent virus growth<br>
inhibiting and/or virucidal effect with low toxicity<br>
which inhibits virus polymerase, especially RNA<br>
polymerase directly or in the form of a substance<br>
converted therefrom in vivo.<br>
Moreover, the present inventors have found a<br>
novel method of hydrolyzing or decomposing in vivo or<br>
in a cell a pyrazine nucleotide analog represented by<br>
the following general formula [2] or a salt thereof:<br>
wherein each of R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, A and Y has the<br>
same meaning as given above; and each of R7 and R8 in<br>
phosphoric acid or phosphonic acid independently<br>
represents a protected or unprotected, substituted or<br>
unsubstituted hydroxyl group to be decomposed under<br>
physiological conditions, and then inducing the product<br>
thus obtained into the pyrazine nucleotide or pyrazine<br>
nucleoside analog represented by general formula [1] or<br>
a salt thereof by the effect of kinase such as<br>
nucleotide kinase, so as to make it exhibit a virus<br>
growth-inhibiting effect and/or a virucidal effect.<br>
Furthermore, the present inventors have found<br>
that a pyrazine nucleotide analog represented by the<br>
following general formula [lz] or a salt thereof:<br>
wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom, or a substituent<br>
of a pyrazine ring; R2 represents a hydrogen atom, an<br>
acyl group, or a carbamoylalkyl or carboxyalkyl group<br>
that may be substituted; each of R3, R4, R5 and R6<br>
identically or differently represents a hydrogen atom,<br>
or a hydroxyl group that may be substituted or<br>
protected; R represents a hydroxyl group that may be<br>
protected or substituted with a group decomposed under<br>
physiological conditions; A represents an oxygen atom<br>
or a methylene group; and n represents an integer of 1<br>
to 3, is a compound, which is converted under<br>
physiological conditions and inhibits virus RNA<br>
polymerase in the same manner as the general formula<br>
[1], thus exhibiting a virus growth-inhibiting effect<br>
and/or a virucidal effect.<br>
Any of the aforementioned compounds is<br>
converted in vivo or in a cell into a pyrazine<br>
triphosphate nucleotide analog represented by the<br>
following general formula [ly]:<br>
wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom, or a substituent<br>
of a pyrazine ring; and each of Z10, Z11, Z12 and Z13<br>
identically or differently represents a hydrogen atom<br>
or hydroxyl group, and it exhibits an RNA polymerase<br>
inhibitory effect. In addition, a compound represented<br>
by general formula [1x] indicated below is an RNA<br>
polymerase inhibitor precursor that is converted into<br>
the compound represented by general formula [1y] in<br>
vivo or in a cell:<br>
wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom, or a substituent<br>
of a pyrazine ring; R2 represents a hydrogen atom, an .<br>
acyl group, or a carbamoylalkyl or carboxyalkyl group<br>
that may be substituted; each of R3, R4, R5 and R6<br>
identically or differently represents a hydrogen atom,<br>
or a hydroxyl group that may be substituted or<br>
protected; A represents an oxygen atom or a methylene<br>
group; Y represents an oxygen atom or an imino group;<br>
and m represents an integer of 0 to 2.<br>
The RNA polymerase inhibitor precursor of the<br>
present invention inhibits virus-derived RNA polymerase<br>
with selectivity much more higher than host-derived RNA<br>
polymerase. The present RNA polymerase inhibitor<br>
precursor can inhibit virus-derived RNA polymerase with<br>
selectivity preferably 200 times or more, more<br>
preferably 1,000 times or more, and further more<br>
preferably 2,000 times or more, higher than that for<br>
host-derived RNA polymerase. Moreover, the RNA<br>
polymerase inhibitor precursor of the present invention<br>
hardly inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase,<br>
and after it is converted in vivo into a<br>
triphosphorylated form, it inhibits virus polymerase.<br>
Accordingly, the present RNA polymerase inhibitor<br>
precursor is characterized in that it has an extremely<br>
strong virus polymerase inhibitory effect after it is<br>
converted in vivo, and it also has high selectivity,<br>
while cytotoxicity caused by inhibition of inosine<br>
monophosphate dehydrogenase is extremely reduced.<br>
Using this high selectivity, a highly safe agent can be<br>
obtained.<br>
The RNA polymerase inhibitor precursor of the<br>
present invention has extremely high selectivity to RNA<br>
polymerase and inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. In<br>
a pyrazine nucleoside or pyrazine mononucleotide analog<br>
structure represented by the following general formula<br>
[lw] :<br>
wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom, or a substituent<br>
of a pyrazine ring; R2 represents a hydrogen atom, an<br>
acyl group, or a carbamoylalkyl or carboxyalkyl group<br>
that may be substituted; each of R3, R4, R5 and R6<br>
identically or differently represents a hydrogen atom,<br>
or a hydroxyl group that may be substituted or<br>
protected; Y represents an oxygen atom or an imino<br>
group; and p represents 0 or 1, the ratio of the<br>
inhibitory effect on virus-derived RNA polymerase of<br>
the precursor after it is converted in vivo that on the<br>
host cell-derived inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase<br>
of the precursor is preferably 900 : 1 or more, more<br>
preferably 5,000 : 1 or more , and further more<br>
preferably 10,000 : 1 or more.<br>
The present inventors have confirmed that<br>
when each of R1, R3 and R5 is a hydrogen atom and each of<br>
R4Z, R6Z and Rz is a hydroxyl group, for example, in a<br>
pyrazine nucleotide derivative represented by the<br>
following general formula [3z]:<br>
wherein each of R1, R2, R3, R5 and Y has the same meaning<br>
as given above; Rz represents a protected or<br>
unprotected, substituted or unsubstituted hydroxyl<br>
group to be decomposed under physiological conditions;<br>
each of R4Z and R6Z identically or differently represents<br>
a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group that may be<br>
substituted or protected, or R4Z and R6Z together<br>
represent a group represented as -O-alkylene-O- that<br>
may be substituted, and when such a compound is<br>
administered to an animal, there is generated 4-[(2R,<br>
3R, 4S, 5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5~(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-<br>
2-furanyl]-3-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2-pyrazinecarboxamide<br>
(substitution nomenclature: 3,4-dihydro-3-oxo-4-p-D-<br>
ribofuranosyl-2-pyrazinecarboxamide) in the blood<br>
plasma of the animal.<br>
What is more, the present inventors have<br>
confirmed that when the pyrazine nucleoside analog<br>
represented by general formula [3z] or a salt thereof<br>
such as 4-[(2R, 3R, 4S, 5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxy-<br>
methyl) tetrahydro-2-furanyl]-3-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2-<br>
pyrazinecarboxamide is administered to an animal, there<br>
is generated {(2R, 3S, 4R, 5R)-5-[3-(aminocarbonyl)-2-<br>
oxo-1(2H)-pyrazinyl]-3,4-dihydroxytetrahydro-2-furanyl}<br>
methyl triphosphate in the organ of the animal.<br>
Thus, the present inventors have found that a<br>
method of administering the compound represented by<br>
general formula [3z] or a salt thereof to mammals, or<br>
administering the compound represented by general<br>
formula [2] or a salt thereof to mammals, so as to<br>
induce the pyrazine nucleotide or pyrazine nucleoside<br>
analog represented by general formula [1] or a salt<br>
thereof in vivo, exhibits a novel virus growth-<br>
inhibiting effect and/or a novel virucidal effect,<br>
thereby completing the present invention.<br>
The method of the present invention is useful<br>
as a method for treating patients infected with virus,<br>
which comprises a step of administering to a patient<br>
infected with virus the aforementioned pyrazine<br>
nucleotide or pyrazine nucleoside analog or a salt<br>
thereof such as the compound represented by general<br>
formula [3z] or a salt thereof. More preferably, the<br>
method of the present invention further comprises a<br>
step of converting the above compound or a salt thereof<br>
into the pyrazine triphosphate nucleotide analog<br>
represented by general formula [1y].<br>
Moreover, it is preferably that, in the body<br>
of a patient infected with virus, the general formula<br>
[3z] is converted into the pyrazine triphosphate<br>
nucleotide analog represented by general formula [1y]<br>
through a pyrazine nucleotide analog represented by the<br>
following general formula [Iv]:<br>
wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom, or a substituent<br>
of a pyrazine ring; and each of Z10, Z11, Z12 and Z13<br>
identically or differently represents a hydrogen atom<br>
or hydroxyl group. The pyrazine nucleotide analog<br>
represented by general formula [1v] is characterized in<br>
that it does not substantially inhibit inosine<br>
monophosphate dehydrogenase derived from host cells.<br>
Moreover, the pyrazine triphosphate nucleotide analog<br>
represented by general formula [1y] is characterized in<br>
that it inhibits virus-derived RNA polymerase more<br>
selectively than host-derived RNA polymerase.<br>
Furthermore, as a result of intensive studies<br>
of the present inventors regarding anhydrides of 4-<br>
[(2R, 3R, 4S, 5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-<br>
(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-2-furanyl]-3-oxo-3,4-dihydro-<br>
2-pyrazinecarboxamide that is a representative compound<br>
of the present invention, they have found 4-[(2R, 3R,<br>
4S, 5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-2-<br>
furanyl]-3-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2-pyrazinecarboxamide<br>
monohydrate, which has excellent stability during the<br>
process of pharmaceutical preparation. This hydrate is<br>
a crystal that is stable during the process of<br>
pharmaceutical preparation by common methods, and<br>
during the process of pharmaceutical preparation, and<br>
it has less dustability and does not adhere to<br>
instruments when compared with anhydrides.<br>
Accordingly, it enables good mixing and granulation.<br>
Wet granulation is generally used as<br>
granulation during the process of pharmaceutical<br>
preparation. During such wet granulation, water and an<br>
aqueous solution containing a binder are generally<br>
used. However, it is known that when an anhydride is<br>
used, a part of the anhydride is converted into a<br>
hydrate depending on conditions. Moreover, an<br>
amorphous substance generated in this process causes a<br>
problem from the viewpoint of pharmaceutical<br>
preparation or stability. Accordingly, when a hydrate<br>
exists as a crystal polymorph, strict conditions are<br>
required for preparation of a pharmaceutical from an<br>
anhydride. However, a monohydrate is a stable crystal<br>
during the common pharmaceutical preparation process,<br>
and therefore, it is an excellent compound that does<br>
not cause the aforementioned problem.<br>
In addition, such a monohydrate does not need<br>
an organic solvent in the final preparation process,<br>
but it can be crystallized from water. Accordingly,<br>
the risk that organic solvents are remained in the<br>
finally obtained crystal is low. Moreover, since the<br>
monohydrate does not need an organic solvent, it does<br>
not need explosion-proof equipment. Thus, it can be<br>
said that this compound has great advantages on the<br>
production process.<br>
The compound of the present invention will be<br>
described in detail below.<br>

followed by incubation at 37°C for 1 hour. Likewise,<br>
0.5 rnL of 0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.5 mL of 0.1 M<br>
MgCl2 were added to 4 mL of the above No. 1 0.5 M KC1<br>
eluate, and then 0.5 mL of alkali phosphatase prepared<br>
from the intestine of a calf (EC3.1.3.1., 20 U/mL) was<br>
further added thereto, followed by incubation at 37°C<br>
for 1 hour. Likewise, 0.2 mL of 0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH<br>
8.0) and 0.2 mL of 0.1 M MgCl2 were added to 1.6 mL of<br>
the above No. 2 0.5 M KC1 eluate, and then 0.1 mL of<br>
alkali phosphatase prepared from the intestine of a<br>
calf (EC3.1.3.1., 20 U/mL) was further added thereto,<br>
followed by incubation at 37°C for 1 hour.<br>
By the HPLC analysis (HPLC-4) described in<br>
HPLC conditions, it was confirmed that the<br>
monophosphate disappeared from the No. 3 0.05 M KCl<br>
eluate, and that a newly generated compound and<br>
compound A were identical in terms of HPLC retention<br>
time and UV spectrum. Likewise, by the HPLC analysis<br>
(HPLC-4) described in HPLC conditions, it was confirmed<br>
that the diphosphate form disappeared from the No. 1<br>

3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide]<br>
5 ml of an E'-MEM culture medium (containing<br>
1% bovine serum albumin and 3% vitamin solution)<br>
containing 3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide (final<br>
concentration: 5000 µM) was added to MDCK cells that<br>
had been monolayer-cultured on a 55 cm2 culture plate,<br>
and culture was carried out under conditions of 37°C and<br>
5% C02 for 24 hours. 1 mL of 70% methanol that had been<br>
cooled to -20°C was added to cell fractions under ice<br>
cooling, and 3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide, compound<br>
A, and a phosphate(s) were extracted therefrom. 0.7 mL<br>
of the supernatant of the extract centrifuged at 4°C for<br>
10 minutes was purified under the condition indicated<br>
below, using a solid extraction cartridge (Varian BOND<br>
ELUT SAX HF 100 mg/1 mL; eluted with 0.01 M to 1.0 M<br>
KC1) pretreated with 1 mL of methanol and 1 mL each of<br>
1.0 M and 0.005 M KC1.<br>
The phosphate form contained in 1 mL of 0.05<br>
M KC1 eluate and a synthetic monophosphate compound (a<br>
compound obtained in Reference Example 30) were<br>
identical in terms of HPLC retention time and UV<br>
spectrum in HPLC analysis (HPLC-5). In addition, the<br>
phosphate form contained in 1 mL of 0.25 M KC1 eluate<br>
and a synthetic diphosphate compound (a compound<br>
obtained in Reference Example 31) were identical in<br>
terms of HPLC retention time in HPLC analysis (HPLC-6).<br>
Moreover, the phosphate form contained in 1 mL of 0.5 M<br>
KC1 eluate and a synthetic triphosphate compound (a<br>
compound obtained in Reference Example 22) were<br>
identical in terms of HPLC retention time in HPLC<br>
analysis (HPLC-6).<br>
To 0.8 mL each of the above KCl eluates, 0.1<br>
mL of 0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.1 mL of 0.1 M MgCl2<br>
were added. Then 0.8 mL of the mixture was taken, to<br>
which 0.08 mL of alkali phosphatase prepared from the<br>
intestine of a calf (EC3.1.3.1., 20 U/mL) was added,<br>
followed by incubation at 37°C for 1 hour.<br>
By the HPLC analysis (HPLC-7), it was<br>
confirmed that the monophosphate disappeared from the<br>
0.05 M KCl eluate, and that a newly generated compound<br>
and compound A were identical in terms of HPLC<br>
retention time. Moreover, by the HPLC analysis (HPLC-<br>
8), it was confirmed that a newly generated compound<br>
and compound A were identical in terms of UV spectrum.<br>
Likewise, by the HPLC analysis (HPLC-7), it was<br>
confirmed that the diphosphate form disappeared from<br>
the 0.25 M KC1 eluate, and that a newly generated<br>
compound and compound A were identical in terms of HPLC<br>
retention time. Furthermore, by the HPLC analysis<br>
(HPLC-8), it was confirmed that a newly generated<br>
compound and compound A were identical in terms of UV<br>
spectrum. Likewise, by the HPLC analysis (HPLC-7), it<br>
was confirmed that the triphosphate disappeared from<br>
the 0.5 M KC1 eluate, and that a newly generated<br>
compound and compound A were identical in terms of HPLC<br>
retention time.<br>
Based on these results, it was confirmed that<br>
3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide, was converted in a<br>
cell into compound A, a monophosphate (a compound<br>
obtained in Reference Example 30), then into a<br>
diphosphate form (a compound obtained in Reference<br>

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
From the above test examples, it was found<br>
that a pyrazine nucleotide triphosphate analog has an<br>
activity to specifically inhibit virus polymerase in<br>
the virus polymerase inhibition test, that the pyrazine<br>
carboxamide nucleotide modified with a substituent<br>
given in the present invention moves into a cell and<br>
has an antiviral activity therein, although it has been<br>
generally known that nucleotide cannot move into a cell<br>
through a cell membrane, and that pyrazine nucleoside<br>
is converted into a pyrazine nucleotide triphosphate<br>
analog in the body of an animal administered with the<br>
pyrazine nucleoside. Accordingly, the virus growth<br>
inhibition and/or virucidal method of the present<br>
invention, which is characterized by the use of a<br>
pyrazine nucleotide or pyrazine nucleoside analog<br>
generated by the effect of kinase such as nucleotide<br>
kinase or a salt thereof, is useful as a method for<br>
treating virus infection. Moreover, the novel pyrazine<br>
