				<td>This invention relates to an automatic  parietal acing machine.<br>
Traditional ( happathiimaking includes kneading attach to form a dough, rolling to the desired shape and cooking the rolled dough on heated have. This apart, recent trend is to use electrically heated plates to press predetermined quantity of dough which gets cooked thereafter. This requires pressing by hand and often turning the pressed dough at least once to effect proper cooking of both the sources.<br>
An industrial  chappathi making plant which uses conveyor plates heated by means of gas has also been developed.<br>
This invention relates to a filly automatic table top model whichâ€™s capable of separating the desired quantity of dough, pressing it to make uniform round sale and then cooking it evenly on both the sides for a specific set time. The cooked chappathi is automatically removed from the cooking plate while the next lot of dough   on the plate to be processed into a chappathi.<br>
This automatic  making machine consists of a dough pressing unit, cutting means to cut the dough and a dough processing unit which cooks the chappathi and removes the cooked ^chappathi) A motor connected to power source drives the different components mounted on shafts. Thickness adjusting means and cooking time adjusting means are also provided. A microprocessor controls the action of the different components.<br><br>
Different parts of the machine will now be described in detail: DOUGH PRESSING UNIT:<br>
Dough pressing unit is mounted on a frame member. A main shaft mounted on the frame member is drivable connected to a drive lever, connecting lever, crank arm provided with ratchet and pawl arrangement. A piston is connected to this arrangement and is provided with a screw and nut arrangement which facilitates only downward movement of the piston. Gear box is coupled to the shaft and consists of worm and worm wheel.<br>
A container for kneaded dough is positioned inside the structure of the frame member. This container has a centrally positioned tapered opening and a divider for allowing predetermined quantity of the dough kept therein to be discharged. The ratchet, pawl, screw and nut arrangement enables the piston to be moved only upwards and downwards and prevents its rotation.<br>
DOUGH PROCESSING UNIT:<br>
It consists of a bottom plate and a top plate both of which are electrically heated and are provided with thermostats for a temperature control. The top plate is fixed on top plate drive shaft and is provided with stopper means which acts as a support to the top plate when bottom plate presses thereon. The bottom plate is mounted on a cam sliding cylinder such that it moves up with the cylinder. A limit switch is provided on a limit switch operating cam which has a groove which enables the bottom plate to be stopped at a preset distance.<br><br>
Dough cutting means consists of a cutting wire assembly mounted on the top plate. A cutting wire holder and a holder pin holds tiie cutting wire assembly which is held in such a way that it touches the taper portion of the container"s mouth. Cutting of the dough is done when the top plate moves and the cutting wire touches the taper of the dough container. Cutting wire assembly is mounted in such a way that tiie load on the cutting wire is equal on both the sides of the container mouth. This is required to make sure that the cut dough Ms at the center of the bottom plate. The taper guides the cutting wire. When the motor is started, drive is transmitted and the bottom plate moves towards the top plate to press the dough that has been deposited on it.<br>
The heating sources of the top and the bottom plates are convex and concave in nature respectively. This allows the air to escape during baking. The plates are also voided with plurality of profiles on its sources. The dough is pressed and baked thereafter. Cooking time depends on the viscosity and such other qualities of the dough. The control panel fitted with a micro processor ensures that the drive is switched on at a preset time. Adjustment means are also provided to adjust the time of cooking. Both the top and the bottom plates are provided with plurality of small profiles. When the dough is {Hissed between the top and the bottom plates, air pockets are created because of these profiles. When the pressed dough is heated, these air pockets get filled with  steam. This  steam moves up,<br><br>
creating a dent in the pressed dough which becomes a bubble. The top plate being fixed on logitudinal axis, the movement of the top and the bottom plate controls the diameter of the pressed dough.<br>
Return stroke stoking mechanism consists of a pawl and ratchet, where the pawl engages a pinion in one direction and disengages therefrom in the opposite direction. Return stroke may be stopped by engaging the pinion during the return stroke also. Final stopping mechanism consists of a switch activating plate provided with a limit switch.<br>

The groove on the cam is also got a provision to stop the plate at preset distance.<br>
CUTTING THE PRESSED DOUGH:<br>
Cutting the pressed dough contains following components: Main drive shaft 65, top plate drive cam 70, follower 42, follower pin 41, top plate driving lever 68, top plate drive shaft 64, top plate cover 14, bush bearing 56, 67, top plate 11, hex bush 63, top plate bush bearings 62,66, washer 61, screw 60, cutting wire holder 12, wire tensioning plate 13, cutting wire 15, wire holder pin 16, bottom plate 9, container 17, divider plate 44.<br><br>
The top plate 11 is fixed to the structure 54, inside the holding bushes as shown in figure by means of bushes 62 and 66. Top plate 11 is mounted on top plate drive shaft 64 by means of a pin. Cutting wire assembly is mounted on top plate 11 as shown in figure by means of screws. In cutting wire assembly, cutting wire 15 is mounted on cutting wire holder 12 by means of wire holder pin 16, cutting wire 15 is set in such a way that it touches the taper portion of the container 17 mouth.<br>
On the top plate drive shaft 64, top plate drive lever 68 is mounted by means of a pin. Follower pin 41 is fixed on the top plate drive lever 68 by means of a nut. Top plate drive cam 70 is mounted on the main drive shaft 65 by means of key.<br>
When the drive is given to the main drive shaft 65, the top plate drive cam 70 is rotated. By means of the follower 42, rotational motion is converted into linear motion. Follower pin 41 pushes the top plate drive lever 68 in to and fro motion. As the top plate drive lever 68 is fixed to the main drive shaft 65 rotates the top plate 11 side ways. When the top plate 11 moves, it cuts the protruding dough from the container 17. Cutting is done efficiently as the cutting wire 15 touches the taper portion of container 17 initially. This taper portion guides the cutting wire 15 same moment, it increases the tension of the cutting wire 15. Cutting wire assembly is mounted in such a way that the load on the cutting wire 15 is equal on both the side of the container 17 mouth. This aspect makes sure that cut dough &amp;lls at the center of the bottom plate 9.<br><br>
PROCESSING THE BACKED DOUGH:<br>
When the baked dough is pressed as explained on part two, the cooking time has to be controlled according to the dough viscosity and quality. The control panel 43 is fitted with microprocessor, which ensures that the drive is switched on preset time. Baking time can be increased or decreased by turn off a knob. Coil 39 is fixed on top plate 11 and bottom plate 9 as shown in figure 1. Thermostat 38 is fixed on the bottom plate 9. When the knob is turned, it increases or decreases the baking time. Preset temperature is maintained by means of thermostat 38.<br>
For increasing the quality of the roti, i.e. to control the softness, texture and taste of the roti or chaf^lfaies, the following aspects employed.<br>
The top plate 11 and bottom plate 9 has a sUght convex and concave curve respectively. This helps air to escape in the side, this increasing the softness.<br>
Small profiles are machined out of top plate 11 and bottom plate 9 as shown in the top plate 11 and bottom plate 9 drawings. When the dough is pressed between top plate 11 and bottom plate 9 air pockets are created on these sur&amp;ces. When the pressed dough is heated, these air pockets are fitted with steam. This steam when dries to move up due to heat, it creates a dent in the pressed dough, which becomes a bubble. These bubbles gives a good look to the roti"s as it is cooked on the steam. That is created fi"om the pressed dough itself quality of the roti"s increased manifold.<br><br>
The main cam 5 is designed in such a way that it doesn"t press too hard or too light. Just Ihe right amount of pressure is applied when pressing, so that the softness of the roti"s are increased.<br>
The top plate 11 temperature is set at a higher value, this is being done because when the pressed dough is baked only the bottom plate 9 comes in contact. The top plater 11 is staying few millimeters above the pressed dough. The heat is conducted through air. This improves the quality of the product.<br>
THICKNESS CONTROL MECHANISM:<br>
Thickness adjusting mechanism contains following components:<br>
TC cap 1, TC nut 2, TC screw 34, TC lever 3, Thrust bearing 35, main cam 5, circlip 33, structure 54.<br>
TC nut 2 is fixed to the structure 54 by means of screw as shown in figure 1. On the TC nut 2, a TC screw 34 is mounted. TC lever 3 is fixed to the TC screw 34 by means of pin. Thrust bearing 35 is fixed on the TC screw 34. Main cam 5 is rest on the thrust bearing 35. TC cap 1 is fixed to the structure 54 by means of screws. TC cap 1 acts as a guide to the main cam 5. Circlip 33 locks tiie main cam 5<br>
When the TC lever 3 is pushed from one side to another, it rotates the TC screw 34. When the TC screw 34 is rotated, it moves up or down inside the TC nut 2. As the TC nut 2 is already locked with the structure 54 with TC screw 34, the thrust bearing 35 and main cam 5 also moves up or down.<br><br>
With the main cam 5, bottom plate 9 is also moves up or down. The top plate 11 is fixed on longitudinal axis. They according to the bottom plate 9 movement, the thickness and diameter of the pressed dough can be varied.<br>
RETURN STROKE STOPPING MECHANISM:<br>
Return stroke-stopping mechanism consists of following components:-<br>
Pawl 30, pawl control plate 28, pawl spring 27, pawl top follower 29, pawl bottom follower 24, pawl stepped pin 26, spacer bush 25, pawl plate 23, crank arm 82, pawl plate reverse pin 46.<br>
Pawl control plate 28 is seated on the ratchet SO, pawl spring 27 is fixed on one end on pawl 30 and on the other end on pawl plate 23. At one end of the pawl 30, pawl stepped pin 26 is fixed on top of the pawl stepped pin 26, pawl top follower 29 is mounted and locked through circlip. Spacer bush 25 is mounted on structure 54, which maintains the height of the pawl control plate 28.<br>
When the cutting wire 15 crosses the container 17, the dough is cut. On returning to the original position for the next cycle, there is a small amount of dough projecting out because of the viscose properties of the dough. This is correct^ by taking the piston back for a certain distence after pressing the dough for cutting stroke.<br><br>
Normally in ratchet mechanism, pawl 30 is engages to pinion in one direction and in other direction, it is not engaged. To control the return stroke, we engage the pinion while returning also for require distance. This is achieved by following sequence of operation.<br>
On the oscillation of crank arm 82, it comes in contact with pawl 30 at a pawl bottom follower 24. By this movement, pawl 30 is engages to the ratchet 50 and also pushes forward. On the return stroke. Crank arm 82 pushes pawl plate reverse pin 46, thus reversing the direction of pawl 30. As it reversed, pawl spring 27 disengages the pawl 30 from ratchet 50. As the pawl 30 moves further on return stroke, it comes in contact with pawl control palte 28 at pawl top follower 29. This activates engagement of pawl 30 to the ratchet 50. This engagement ceases once, the profile on pawl control plate 28 crosses the pawl top follower 29.<br>
FINAL STOPPING MECHANISM:<br>
Final stopping mechanism contains following components:-<br>
Over switch activating plate 49, spring 48, limit switch 47, roller 31, handle cam 52, handle 32.<br>
On completion of baking, entire quanity of dough, the machine stops all the activities. This is achieving by following sequence of action. On removal of product from top plate 11, whatever protrudins material from<br><br>
container 17 will be cut. This will create a cleaning problem on the machine. Finally the pawl 30 is continuously engages for both to and fro motion, so as to stop protruding of dough on final cutting stroke.<br>
On completion of dough on the container 17, the screw rod handle cam 52 reaches the bottom most position. In this position, it comes in contact with roller 31, which pushes over switch activation plate 49 forward which comes in contact with pawl top follower 29. As the pawl 30 is continuously engages on both to and fro motion, the screw rod 21 stays in the same position. Same moment, over switch activating plate 49 activates limit switch 47, w^ich stops all the machine activity.<br>
REMOVING &amp; STORING THE BAKED PRODUCT:<br>
Removing and storing the baked product contains following components:<br>
Main drive shaft 65, top plate drive cam 70, follower 42, follower pin 41, top plate driving cover 68, top plate drive shaft 64, bush bearing 56 and 67, top plate 11, top plate tmsh bearing 62 and 66 washer 61, bottom plate 9, removal shoes 10 and storing area 55.<br><br>
The top plate 11 is fixed to the structure 54, inside the holding bushes as shown in figure by means of bushes 62 and 64. The top plate 11 is mounted on top plate drive shaft 64 by means of a pin. On top plate drive shaft 64, top plate drive lever is mounted by means of a pin. Follower pin is fixed on the top plate drive lever by means of a nut. Top plate drive cam is mounted on the top plate drive shaft by means of a nut. Removal shoes 10 are fixed at the bottom of top plate.<br>
When the drive is given to the main drive shaft, the top plate dirve cam is rotated. By means of the follower rotational motion is converted into linear motion. Follower pin pushes the drive lever in to and fro motion.<br>
As the top plate driving lever is fixed to the main drive shaft, it rotates the top plate side ways. When the top plate moves the removal shoes 10, moves just above the bottom plate without scrapping the surface, but removing the baked product. Removed product is stored in storing area SS.<br><br><br>
