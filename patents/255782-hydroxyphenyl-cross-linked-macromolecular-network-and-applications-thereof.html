APPLICATIONS THEREOF<br>
[0001] This application claims priority from U.S. provisional patent application Serial<br>
No. 60/586,585 filed July 9, 2004, the contents of both of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference in their entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Articular cartilage performs an essential function in healthy joints. It is<br>
responsible for absorbing and dissipating impact and frictional loads in order to divert these<br>
loads away from bones, to protect the bones from damage. Cartilage performs this function<br>
by transferring the loading force to a fluid phase within a three-dimensional network of<br>
aggrecan molecules, themselves constrained (described in the next paragraph) within the joint<br>
space. Aggrecan molecules have up to 100 chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains attached to a core<br>
protein, with each chondroitin sulfate chain possessing multiple negatively charged sulfate<br>
groups along their length. The effect of all these sulfate groups is to cause each of the<br>
chondroitin sulfate chains in a single aggrecan molecule to repel one another, (resulting in the<br>
aggrecan molecule having the maximum possible volume at rest), and also to cause adjacent<br>
aggrecan molecules in a cartilage aggregate to repel one another.<br>
[0003] In healthy cartilage, aggrecan molecules are attached to long hyaluronan<br>
chains, which are in turn constrained in large cartilage aggregates within the joint space by an<br>
extracellular collagen fibril matrix. Thus, even though adjacent chondroitin sulfate chains in<br>
each aggrecan molecule (and adjacent aggrecan molecules attached to the same or a different<br>
hyaluronan chain) repel one another, they are nonetheless constrained within the collagen<br>
matrix. See Fig. 1 depicting normal, healthy cartilage. Because the chondroitin sulfate<br>
chains are so repulsive, the hyaluronan-aggrecan network (or macromolecular network)<br>
expands as much as possible within the constraints of the collagen matrix to achieve the<br>
lowest possible energy state at rest; i.e. to allow the maximum possible spacing between<br>
adjacent negatively charged sulfate groups. As a result, network molecules are highly<br>
resistant to being shifted or displaced in order to avoid approaching an adjacent network<br>
molecule. These large cartilage aggregates are trapped at one fifth their free solution volume<br>
within a meshwork of collagen fibers, which resist any further swelling. Cartilage aggregates<br>
with their high negative charge density bind large solvent domains, and contribute to<br>
cartilage's ability to absorb loads and resist deformation. Upon compression, the distance<br><br>
between the fixed-negative charge groups on the proteoglycans decreases, which increases<br>
the charge-to-charge repulsive forces as well as the concentration of free-floating positive<br>
counterions (such as Ca2+ and Na+). Both effects contribute to the viscoelastic nature of<br>
cartilage and its ability to resist deformation and absorb compressive loads, further described<br>
below.<br>
[0004] Within the macromolecular network are water molecules which provide a<br>
substantially continuous fluid phase. The macromolecular network diverts impact and<br>
frictional loads away from bones by transferring them to the continuous fluid (water) phase as<br>
follows. As a joint undergoes a load, the force is absorbed first by the macromolecular<br>
network, where it acts on and tends to deform or compress the network. The force sets up<br>
pressure gradients in the fluid phase in order to induce fluid flow to accommodate network<br>
deformation or compression resulting from the load. But the fluid cannot negotiate the tight<br>
macromolecular network, packed with the repulsive chondroitin sulfate chains, sufficiently to<br>
ac: mmodate a bulk flow of water without shifting or displacing the network molecules.<br>
Hence, individual water molecules may diffuse within the network, but the bulk fluid phase is<br>
substantially constrained from flowing through the network except at a much slowed rate due<br>
to the resistance to displacement of network molecules. Because the water molecules cannot<br>
flow readily despite the pressure gradients, the energy from the impact or frictional load is<br>
transferred to and absorbed by the fluid phase where it contributes to compressing the liquid<br>
water until the water can be sufficiently displaced to accommodate the network conformation<br>
and the pressure gradients have subsided. The overall result is that cartilage absorbs the<br>
potentially harmful load, thereby diverting it from bone.<br>
[0005] Through this elegant mechanism, normal cartilage is capable of absorbing<br>
significant loads by transferring the bulk of the loading force to a fluid phase constrained<br>
within a macromolecular network. This arrangement has yet to be adequately duplicated via<br>
artificial or synthetic means in the prior art. Consequently, there is no adequate remedy for<br>
cartilage degenerative disorders, such as arthritic disorders, where the aggrecan molecules<br>
become separated from their hyaluronan chains and are digested or otherwise carried out<br>
from the cartilage aggregates.<br>
[0006] Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis affect an estimated 20.7 and 2.1 million<br>
Americans, respectively. Osteoarthritis alone is responsible for roughly 7 million physician<br>
visits a year. For severe disabling arthritis, current treatment involves total joint replacement<br><br>
with on average 168,000 total hip replacements and 267,000 total knee replacements<br>
performed per year in the U.S. alone. Defects in articular cartilage present a complicated<br>
treatment problem because of the limited capacity of chondrocytes to repair cartilage.<br>
Treatment strategies to date have focused on the use of autologous chondrocytes expanded in<br>
culture or the recruitment of mesenchymal stem cells in vivo by chemotactic or mitogenic<br>
agents. The intent of these strategies is to increase and/or activate the chondrocyte<br>
population so as to resynthesize a normal, healthy articular cartilage surface. One major<br>
difficulty associated with these strategies is the inability to maintain these agents at the site of<br>
the defect. Hyaluronan has been proposed as a candidate for the development of<br>
biomaterials for local delivery of chondrocytes or bioactive agents because of its unique<br>
properties, including excellent biocompatibility, degradability, and Theological and<br>
physiochemical properties. However, it has been unknown whether chondrocytes suspended<br>
in a tissue engineered hyaluronan matrix would be able to synthesize a new cartilage matrix<br>
with mechanical properties comparable to normal, healthy articular cartilage. This is because<br>
conventional biomaterials made from hyaluronan are formed through chemistries that are<br>
incompatible with maintaining cell viability. Chondrocytes must be introduced to the<br>
matrices after matrix formation with variable and normally poor results.<br>
[0007] Accordingly, there is a need in the art for an artificial or synthetic matrix that<br>
can effectively divert a loading force from bones in an effective manner. Preferably, such a<br>
matrix can be provided in situ or in vivo to repair or replace articular cartilage during an<br>
orthopedic surgical procedure. Most preferably, the artificial or synthetic matrix can be<br>
provided to an in situ or in vivo target site as a liquid or a plurality of liquids, and can set up<br>
in place to provide a substantially seamless integration with existing cartilaginous and/or<br>
bony tissue in a patient.<br>
[0008] It also is desirable to provide an artificial or synthetic matrix that can be used<br>
or adapted to synthesize a variety of replacement tissues.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0025] As used herein, the term polycarboxylate means a molecule, structure or<br>
species having a chain length of at least two functional groups or units, wherein at least two<br>
such groups or units of the chain are or comprise carboxylic acid groups that are sterically<br>
accessible to a nucleophilic substitution reaction as described herein. Also as used herein, the<br>
term polyamine means a molecule, structure or species having a chain length of at least two<br>
functional groups or units, wherein at least two such groups or units of the chain are or<br>
comprise primary amine groups that are available for a nucleophilic substitution reaction.<br>
Also as used herein, a polyhydroxyphenyl molecule means a molecule having a chain length<br>
of at least two functional groups or units, wherein at least two such groups or units of the<br>
chain are or comprise hydroxyphenyl groups that can be linked to another hydroxyphenyl<br>
group via a C-C bond. Also as used herein, a hydrogel is a material that is prepared<br>
comprising a macromolecular network that is used or useful in tissue replacement or<br>
engineering applications, e.g. as artificial cartilage, as a material to coat surgical instruments<br>
to prevent tissue irritation, or to provide a semi-permeable membrane such as for use in an<br>
artificial kidney, etc.<br>
[0026] The invention includes a novel structure of a macromolecular network that has<br>
been formed by linking hydroxyphenyl groups attached to adjacent long chain<br>
macromolecules, resulting in effectively cross-linking the macromolecules to provide a large<br>
network. The basic cross-linking structure of the network is shown below<br><br>
where R1 and R2 are each long chain macromolecules. R1 and R2 can be the same molecule<br>
or different molecules, but it will be understood that to provide a suitable network, R1 and R2<br>
will be different molecules for at least a portion of the dihydroxyphenyl linkages in a network<br>
according to the invention. It is not necessary, though it is preferred, that R1 and R2 are the<br>
same species of molecule.<br>
[0027] By providing a plurality of these dihydroxyphenyl linkages between adjacent<br>
macromolecules, a network of dihydroxyphenyl cross-linked macromolecules is provided as<br><br>
shown schematically in Fig. 2. In the figure, the macromolecules are represented<br>
schematically by cylindrical strands, each preferably having at least two hydroxyphenyl<br>
groups attached along its length. It is noted that not every hydroxyphenyl group must be<br>
linked to another hydroxyphenyl group.<br>
[0028] Briefly, the disclosed invention involves covalent coupling of hydroxyphenyl<br>
containing compounds, including but not limited to tyramine, through their primary amine (or<br>
carboxyl) groups to carboxyl (or primary amine) groups on various polymeric scaffold<br>
materials, including but not limited to hyaluronan or chondroitin sulfate (e.g. in the form of<br>
aggrecan), via a carbodiimide-mediated reaction. After isolation and purification of the<br>
hydroxyphenyl-substituted polymeric scaffolds, the hydroxyphenyl residues are selectively<br>
cross-linked by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the presence of very dilute hydrogen<br>
peroxide to form hydrogels. As will become apparent, the hydrogels made as described<br>
herein are or can be used as a fully implantable, non-immunogenic synthetic tissue matrix<br>
material that can be implanted into the body for a variety of purposes as will be described.<br>
As used herein, 'implantable' refers both to surgical implantation of a hydrogel as through a<br>
surgical incision, and to provision of the hydrogel within the body via injection, e.g. using a<br>
syringe. Whether surgically implanted or injected, the implantable hydrogels can be provided<br>
within the body already cross-linked (ex vivo cross-linking) or otherwise it can be cross-<br>
linked in situ at the site of implantation within the body as will be further described.<br>
[0029] The first step in providing the macromolecular network is to prepare or<br>
provide the long-chain macromolecules having periodic hydroxyphenyl groups attached. In<br>
one embodiment, the macromolecules are polyhydroxyphenyl molecules which already have<br>
multiple or periodic hydroxyphenyl groups, such as polyphenols. Suitable polyphenols<br>
include polyamino acids (e.g. polytyrosine), epigallocatechin (EGC), and epigallocatechin<br>
gallate (EGCG) isolated from green tea, less preferably other polyphenols.<br>
[0030] In a further embodiment, the hydroxyphenyl groups can be added to the<br>
macromolecules periodically or randomly along their length via a chemical reaction. A<br>
preferred method of adding hydroxyphenyl groups to the macromolecules is to utilize a<br>
carbodiimide-mediated substitution reaction pathway to provide an amide bond between a<br>
primary amine having a hydroxyphenyl group and a carboxylic acid group attached to the<br>
macromolecules. In this method, the long-chain macromolecule preferably is a<br>
polycarboxylate molecule, having periodic carboxylic acid groups along its length. The<br><br>
hydroxyphenyl groups are provided as part of smaller molecules having primary amine<br>
groups that can be attached to the carboxyl carbon atoms of a carboxylic acid group on the<br>
long-chain macrqmolecules via the carbodiimide pathway. The reaction proceeds as follows:<br><br>
where:<br>
Structure A is a carbodiimide;<br>
Structure B is a polycarboxylate (though only one CO2H group is shown);<br>
Structure C is the product of Reaction A and is an activated O-acylisourea;<br>
Structure D is a primary amine having a hydroxyphenyl group;<br>
Structure E is a hydroxyphenyl-substituted polycarboxylate; and<br>
Structure F is an acylurea byproduct;<br>
wherein individual Rs can be individually selected, the same or different from one<br>
another, to be a straight chain or branched alkane or acyl group, or any other structure that<br>
does not interfere with the carbodiimide reaction pathway to provide the amide bond between<br>
the NH2 and CO2H groups as shown in Structure E above.<br><br>
[0031] In the above-illustrated pathway, Reaction A represents a carbodiimide<br>
activation of the carboxyl group to provide an activated O-acylisourea intermediate. The<br>
electropositive carbon atom of this intermediate is receptive to nucleophilic attack by the lone<br>
pair of electrons on a nitrogen atom of an adjacent primary amine molecule having an<br>
attached hydroxyphenyl group. The products of this nucleophilic substitution reaction<br>
(Reaction B) are a hydroxyphenyl-substituted polycarboxylate and an acylurea byproduct<br>
which can be dialyzed out to provide a substantially pure hydroxyphenyl-substituted<br>
polycarboxylate product.<br>
[0032] Certain side-reactions are possible in the above-described carbodiimide<br>
reaction pathway chemistry and should be considered by the person having ordinary skill in<br>
the art. First, the carbodiimide can react with nucleophiles other than the carboxylate oxygen<br>
atom of the polycarboxylate molecule required to form the desired O-acylisourea (reaction<br>
A). Such nucleophiles may include the amine and/or hydroxyphenyl groups of Structure D<br>
illustrated above. In particular, there are three potential side-reactions for Reaction A which<br>
can reduce the effective concentration of the carbodiimide and the primary amine having the<br>
hydroxyphenyl group (Structures A and D), and potentially lead to the creation of undesired<br>
adducts on the polycarboxylate (Structure B):<br><br><br>
[0033] The product of an amine reaction with the carbodiimide (Reaction C) will not<br>
have a free amine group effectively reducing the amount of tyramine available for reaction<br>
with the O-acylisourea. This reaction also reduces the amount of carbodiimide available for<br>
formation of the desired O-acylisourea. The products of the hydroxyphenyl reaction<br>
(Reaction D) are not UV absorbent, which will make their detection by UV-spectroscopy in<br>
the final hydroxyphenyl-substituted polycarboxylate product (explained below) more<br>
difficult. However, because these products still contain free amine groups, they can form<br>
amide bonds with the polycarboxylate molecule via Reaction B. This can give rise to two<br>
unproductive hyaluronan-substituted structures, neither of which can participate in the<br>
peroxidase cross-linking reaction in the second step (described below) of preparing the cross-<br>
linked network due to the absence of an extractable phenolic hydroxyl hydrogen atom needed<br>
to generate the free radical (also explained below). Finally, the carbodiimide can react non-<br><br>
productively with water (Reaction E) to produce the same acylurea shown above as a<br>
byproduct of Reaction B, but with none of Structure E, the desired product.<br>
[0034] Once the desired O-acylisourea product has been formed in Reaction A, there<br>
is again the possibility for certain additional side-reactions:<br><br>
[0035] The O-acylisourea (Structure C) can be hydrolyzed as shown in Reaction F<br>
releasing the original unmodified polycarboxylate (Structure B) and the acylurea of the<br><br>
carbodiimide (Structure F). This is an unproductive reaction similar to reaction E, which<br>
reduces the effective concentration of the carbodiimide. The O-acylisourea, can also undergo<br>
an intramolecular rearrangement (Reaction G) to form two unreactive N-acylureas. These<br>
structures form unproductive adducts on the carboxylate molecule which cannot contribute to<br>
the peroxidase catalyzed cross-linking reaction (step 2 discussed below) for preparing a<br>
network according to the invention. The O-acylisourea can also react (Reaction H) with a<br>
second carboxyl group on either the same or a different polycarboxylate molecule to form an<br>
acid anhydride. This molecule can then react with Structure D to form the desired amide and<br>
regenerate the second carboxyl group. Thus there are two potential side-reactions for the O-<br>
acylisourea, which can reduce the effective concentration of the carbodiimide (Reactions F<br>
and G), and potentially lead to creation of undesired adducts on the polycarboxylate<br>
molecule.<br>
[0036] Negative effects of these side reactions can be addressed through conventional<br>
techniques without undue experimentation.<br>
[0037] Alternatively to the pathway shown above where the macromolecule<br>
(Structure B) is a polycarboxylate, the macromolecule can be a polyamine having multiple or<br>
periodic amine groups along its length, wherein the hydroxyphenyl groups then are provided<br>
as part of smaller carboxylic acid molecules. Suitable polyamines include: polyhexosamines<br>
such as chitosan (polyglucosamine); polyamino acids such as polylysine;<br>
polydeoxyribonucleotides such as poly (dA) (polydeoxyadenylic acid), poly(dC)<br>
(polydeoxycytidylic acid), and poly(dG) (polydeoxyguanylic acid); and polyribonucleotides<br>
such as poly(A) (polyadenylic acid), poly(C) (polycytidylic acid), and poly(G) (polyguanylic<br>
acid). The carbodiimide-mediated reaction pathway proceeds exactly as explained above to<br>
form the amide bond between the amine group and carboxylic acid group except that, as will<br>
be understood by a person having ordinary skill in the art, the resulting product will be<br>
hydroxyphenyl-substituted polyamine instead of a polycarboxylate. Other peptides and/or<br>
proteins also can be used as the macromolecules in the present invention, either which have<br>
hydroxyphenyl groups disposed along their length, or to which hydroxyphenyl groups can be<br>
provided via a substitution reaction as described herein. For example, in addition to the<br>
peptides already disclosed herein, polyarginine can be used as the macromolecule.<br>
[0038] When substituting onto a polycarboxylate molecule, suitable hydroxyphenyl-<br>
containing compounds for use in the present invention include those having a free primary<br><br>
amine that can be used to modify scaffold materials having multiple or periodic CO2H<br>
groups, including tyrosine (2-amino-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) proprionic acid) and tyramine<br>
(tyrosamine or 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) ethylamine). When substituting onto a polyamine,<br>
suitable hydroxyphenyl-containing compounds include those having a free CO2H group that<br>
can be used to modify scaffold materials having multiple or periodic primary NH2 groups,<br>
including tyrosine, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid and 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid.<br>
[0039] The second step in preparing a cross-linked macromolecular network<br>
according to the invention is to link the resulting macromolecules, now having one or more<br>
hydroxyphenyl groups attached, via a dihydroxyphenyl linking structure. In this step<br>
hydroxyphenyl groups attached to different macromolecules are linked via the reaction<br>
mechanism shown below using a peroxide reagent in the presence of a peroxidase:<br><br><br><br>
[0040] (It is noted that some dihydroxyphenyl linking may occur between different<br>
hydroxyphenyl groups attached to the same molecule as well). Peroxidase in the presence of<br>
a dilute peroxide (preferably H2O2) is able to extract the phenolic hydroxyl hydrogen atom<br>
from hydroxyphenyl containing compounds (such as tyramine) leaving the phenolic hydroxyl<br>
oxygen with a single unshared electron, an extremely reactive free radical. The free radical<br>
isomerizes to one of the two equivalent ortho-position carbons and then two such structures<br>
dimerize to form a covalent bond effectively cross-linking the structures, which after<br>
enolizing generates a dihydroxyphenyl dimer (a dihydroxyphenyl linkage such as dityramine<br>
linkage as described below).<br>
[0041] For clarity, only a single dihydroxyphenyl linking reaction is shown above,<br>
but it will be understood that several or multiple such linkages will be produced when<br>
macromolecules having attached hydroxyphenyl groups are subjected to the reaction<br>
conditions (peroxide and peroxidase). Hydrogen peroxide is indicated in the above<br>
mechanism, but other suitable peroxides can be used. Also, the peroxidase preferably is<br>
horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Alternatively, any other suitable enzyme (or other agent) can<br>
be used that is capable of generating free-radicals for cross-linking scaffold materials<br>
containing hydroxyphenyl groups, preferably under ordinary metabolic conditions as<br>
described below.<br>
[0042] We have shown that the interaction of horseradish peroxidase (Type II) and<br>
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is suitable for the production of cross-linked macromolecular<br>
networks. The mechanism comprises four distinct steps: (a) binding of peroxide to the heme-<br>
Fe(IH) complex of the peroxidase to form an unstable peroxide complex, "Compound I"; (b)<br>
oxidation of the iron to generate a ferryl species with a pi-cation radical in the heme<br>
porphyrin ring, "Compound II"; (c) reduction of Compound II by one substrate (i.e.<br>
hydroxyphenyl or water) molecule to produce a product (i.e. hydroxyphenyl or superoxide)<br>
radical and another ferryl species, "Compound III"; (d) reduction of Compound HI by a<br>
second substrate (i.e. hydroxyphenyl or water) molecule to release a second product (i.e.<br>
hydroxyphenyl or superoxide) radical and regenerate the native enzyme. Thus the peroxidase<br>
enzyme can either form hydroxyphenyl radicals required for cross-linking through interaction<br>
of hydroxyphenyl groups at the enzyme active site to directly create the desired radicals or<br>
through first generation of superoxide radicals, which then diffuse from the enzyme and<br>
interact with hydroxyphenyl groups to generate the desired radicals. Other compounds that<br><br>
have the potential to produce the same effect include any porphyrin containing compound<br>
(i.e. Photofrin below), which includes the peroxidase family, hemoproteins, or the structurally<br>
related chlorin compounds.<br>
[0043] A number of other free radical initiators can be used to crosslink the<br>
hydroxyphenyl modified macromolecules described herein. A majority are based on the<br>
formation or inclusion of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as, but not limited to,<br>
molecules of hydrogen peroxide, ions of hypochlorite, radicals like the hydroxyl radical, and<br>
the superoxide anion which is both ion and radical. Additional reactive molecules such as<br>
reactive nitrogen species or reactive sulfur species, or those free radical species involved in<br>
synthetic polymerization have the potential to be used for hydroxyphenyl cross-linking.<br>
[0044] ROS are commonly produced in nature through the use of enzymes, and<br>
substrates. Additional enzymatic systems which have the potential to be used in the cross-<br>
linking process, as a result of production of superoxide radicals, include, but are not limited<br>
to xanthine-xanthine oxidase and NADPH-NADPH oxidase.<br>
[0045] Another class of ROS free radical initiators that can be used involves the use<br>
of metallic cations. One example is based on the Fenton reaction, which takes place between<br>
hydrogen peroxide and a bivalent cation, such as Fe2+. This process generates powerful free<br>
radicals when the catalyst reacts with hydrogen peroxide. The principal chemical reaction<br>
associated with Fenton's reaction is shown below:<br><br>
where, Fe2+ = ferrous ion, Fe3+ = ferric ion, OH. = hydroxyl radicals<br>
[0046] In addition to the initiation reaction described above that produces hydroxyl<br>
radicals, the Fenton's process can also produce superoxide radicals and hydroperoxide anions<br>
by additional chain propagation reactions described below. The perhydroxyl radical is known<br>
to be a weaker reductant compared to superoxide radical and hydroperoxide anions.<br><br>
where O2. = superoxide radical anion, HO2 = hydroperoxide anion, HO2' = perhydroxyl<br>
radical.<br><br>
[0047] We have demonstrated the ability for this reaction to crosslink tyramine<br>
substituted hyaluronan in the laboratory using ferrous sulfate in conjunction with hydrogen<br>
peroxide. Compounds which include, but are not limited to, bivalent cations of copper,<br>
chromium, vanadium and cobalt can be used in a similar manner. It is to be noted that while<br>
the hydroxyl free radical can be used to form a dityramine crosslink, it has also been shown<br>
to cleave HA chains, and thus may ultimately be unsuitable for ideal hydrogel formation.<br>
Additional molecules or methods which can generate ROS include:<br>
•	rubidium or cesium ions in the presence of oxygen to form superoxide radicals;<br>
•	trivalent cations, which with hydrogen peroxide form free radicals and bivalent<br>
cations as shown below, which can subsequently follow the reactions involved in<br>
the Fenton process.<br><br>
•	the cytotoxic and antitumor therapy Photofrin, which upon illumination with laser<br>
light at a wavelength of 630 nm causes propagation of a radical generating<br>
reaction that produces superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. In the absence of light,<br>
but the presence of hydrogen peroxide, the porphorin ring in Photofrin should<br>
operate by the same reaction as for the peroxidase enzyme above.<br>
•	UV light and hydrogen peroxide to form hydroxyl and superoxide free radicals.<br>
•	the persulfate family in combination with TEMED.<br>
[0048] As noted above, one alternative method for generating such free-radicals is to<br>
use Photofrin as an alternative, non-enzymatic, light-activated cross-linking agent to cross-<br>
link the macromolecular network described herein, e.g. tyramine-substituted hyaluronan to<br>
form tyramine cross-linked hyaluronan hydrogels. Photofrin®, which is known in the art,<br>
generates free radicals which could initiate the cross-linking reaction as described herein in a<br>
manner similar to the peroxidase-H2O2 mechanism described above. Photofrin® is a<br>
porfimer sodium manufactured in powder or cake form by Wyeth-Ayerst Lederle Parenterals,<br>
Inc.<br>
[0049] The dihydroxyphenyl cross-linked macromolecular network is superior to<br>
conventional cartilage or other tissue replacement or substitution methods and products, at<br>
least with respect to the ability to carry out an in situ cross-linking procedure, because the<br>
preferred cross-linking reaction is enzyme driven (peroxidase). This means the cross-linking<br><br>
reaction is carried out under ordinary in vivo or metabolic conditions of temperature such as<br>
35-39°C (e.g. about 37°C), pH range of 6-7 (e.g. about 6.5), reagents etc. (A peroxide, such<br>
as hydrogen peroxide, is the only required reagent for the cross-linking reaction). In addition,<br>
Photofrin already is used in in vivo applications, e.g. ablative treatment of Barrett's<br>
esophagus, and the iron-based cross-linking mechanism also can be optimized for in vivo<br>
performance. Thus, the cross-linking reaction can be performed in vivo, to provide a cross-<br>
linked hydrogel at a surgical situs, such as an orthopedic surgical situs, to promote maximum<br>
seamless integration between the hydrogel and native tissue such as bony and cartilaginous<br>
tissue. Integration of the new hydrogel scaffold with native cartilage matrix may occur<br>
immediately as the hydroxyphenyl-substituted macromolecular scaffold quickly penetrates<br>
into the existing cartilage matrix prior to cross-linking, and cross-links not only with other<br>
hydroxyphenyl-substituted macromolecular scaffold material but potentially with tyrosine<br>
residues of resident proteins in the existing cartilage matrix. This would eliminate a typical<br>
problem found with pre-formed matrix plugs, which is their poor integration into the native<br>
cartilage tissue. The ability to cross-link the hydrogel directly on the articular surface<br>
eliminates the need to surgically enlarge a defect to fit a pre-cast plug, as is necessary for<br>
hydrogels whose chemistries are toxic to or otherwise prohibit their formation inside the<br>
patient. It should be noted that most cartilage damage as a result of arthritis presents as a<br>
variable thinning of the articular surface, not holes of defined shape.<br>
[0050] For the peroxidase mechanism, because the cross-linking reaction requires<br>
both the peroxide and a peroxidase (preferably horseradish peroxidase), solutions containing<br>
all but one of these components can be prepared for convenient application to a surgical site.<br>
For example, a solution comprising a tyramine - (or other hydroxyphenyl containing species)<br>
substituted polycarboxylate (such as tyramine-substituted hyaluronan, etc.) and the<br>
peroxidase can be prepared, with a second solution prepared containing the peroxide.<br>
Alternatively, the peroxide and the peroxidase can be swapped between the first and second<br>
solutions, the importan thing being that the peroxide and peroxidase are kept separate (i.e. in<br>
separate solutions) until the cross-linking reaction is to be carried out. Then, the first solution<br>
is applied, (e.g. to an in vivo surgical situs), and the second solution is applied or sprayed<br>
over the first, in vivo, to cause in situ cross-linking of the tyramine residues. The cross<br>
linking reaction occurs in vivo. Other combinations will be evident from the present<br>
disclosure which are within the skill of a person of ordinary skill in the art.<br><br>
[0051 ] Furthermore, because the cross-linking reaction occurs under ordinary<br>
metabolic conditions, additional living cells, such as chondrocytes, progenitor cells, stem<br>
cells, etc., can be provided directly to a medium containing the non-cross-linked<br>
hydroxyphenyl-substituted polycarboxylates or polyamines (or polyphenols), i.e. to the first<br>
or second solution from the preceding paragraph, wherein the cell-rich medium is applied<br>
with the macromolecules to the site in vivo, and the molecules are subsequently cross-linked<br>
via addition of peroxidase and peroxide. The result is a cross-linked macromolecular<br>
network containing the desired cells dispersed within it. Such a cell-enriched network is not<br>
possible in conventional tissue replacement matrices due to the harsh conditions of<br>
temperature and pH under which they are prepared. Further, as described below in Example<br>
5, it has been demonstrated that the cells provided to the network as described above remain<br>
viable even after cross-linking of tyramine-substituted hyaluronan (also described below).<br>
[0052] In a preferred embodiment particularly suitable for preparing synthetic<br>
cartilage as well as other synthetic or artificial tissues, the macromolecule used to produce the<br>
network is hyaluronan or hyaluronic acid (HA), and the hydroxyphenyl group is supplied in<br>
the form of tyramine. Hyaluronan (HA) is a ubiquitous molecule, which is most concentrated<br>
in specialized tissues such as cartilage, vocal cords, vitreous, synovial fluid, umbilical cord,<br>
and dermis. In these tissues, its function is manifold, influencing tissue viscosity, shock<br>
absorption, wound healing, and space filling. HA has been shown to influence many<br>
processes within the extracellular matrix (ECM) in native tissues where it is present including<br>
matrix assembly, cell proliferation, cell migration and embryonic/tissue development.<br>
[0053] HA is composed of repeating pairs of glucuronic acid (glcA) and N-<br>
acetylglucosamine (glcNAc) residues linked by a B 1,3 glycosidic bond as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
The glucuronic acid residue is particularly pertinent to the production of a macromolecular<br>
network as described herein as this sugar provides an available carboxyl group periodically<br>
along the repeat disaccharide structure of HA that is useful for hydroxyphenyl, i.e. tyramine,<br>
substitution. For each hyaluronan chain, this simple disaccharide is repeated up to 10,000<br>
times or greater resulting in macromolecule that can have a molecular weight on the order 10<br>
million daltons (10 megadaltons). Adjacent disaccharide units of HA are linked by a B1.4<br>
glycosidic bond, also seen in Fig. 3. Each glcA residue has a carboxylic acid group (CO2H)<br>
attached to the number 5 carbon atom of the glucose ring. Under biological conditions, HA is<br>
a negatively charged, randomly coiled polymer filling a volume more than 1,000 times<br><br>
greater than would be expected based on molecular weight and composition alone. As noted<br>
above, the strong negative charges attract cations and water, which allow HA to assume the<br>
form of a strongly hydrated gel in vivo, giving it a unique viscoelastic and shock-absorbing<br>
property. HA represents a readily available and desirable scaffolding material for tissue<br>
engineering applications as it is non-immunogenic, non-toxic and non-inflammatory. Also as<br>
a naturally occurring extracellular matrix (ECM) molecule it offers the advantages of being<br>
recognized by cell receptors, of interacting with other ECM molecules, and of being<br>
metabolized by normal physiological pathways.<br>
[0054] Tyramine is a phenolic molecule having an ethyl amine group attached para to<br>
the OH group on the benzene ring. When these species are used, the mechanism for tyramine<br>
substitution onto the singly bound oxygen atom of a CO2H group on HA proceeds via the<br>
carbodiimide-mediated reaction mechanism described above as illustrated immediately<br>
below. The preferred carbodiimide species is l-ethyl-3-(3-<br>
dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) as shown.<br><br><br>
where:<br>
Structure A is EDC;<br>
Structure B is hyaluronan (though only one CO2H group is shown);<br>
Structure C is the product of Reaction A and is l-ethyI-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyI)<br>
isourea;<br>
Structure D is tyramine;<br>
Structure E is tyramine-substituted hyaluronan; and<br>
Structure F is l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) urea (EDU).<br>
[0055] In the above pathway, a negatively charged oxygen atom of the carboxyl<br>
group of the hyaluronan molecule attacks, via a nucleophilic reaction mechanism, the<br>
electron-deficient diimide carbon atom on the carbodiimide molecule (EDC) to form the<br>
activated O-acylisourea (Reaction A). The result is that the carbon atom of the HA<br>
carboxylate group becomes sufficiently electron deficient to be susceptible to nucleophilic<br>
attack by the unshared pair of electrons on the amine group of a tyramine molecule (Reaction<br>
B). Reaction A is preferably catalyzed by a suitable catalyst that will result in the formation<br>
of an active ester during Reaction A, thus permitting the reaction to be carried out at<br>
substantially neutral pH (e.g. pH=6.5). Suitable catalysts include N-hydroxysuccinimide<br>
(NHS), less preferably 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) or N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide<br>
(NHSS), less preferably another suitable catalyst or combinations thereof effective to enhance<br>
the carbodiimide reaction by formation of an active ester in order to minimize the<br>
unproductive hydrolysis of carbodiimides at higher pHs. Less preferably other carbodiimides<br>
besides EDC can be used, including l-cyclohexyI-3-[2-(4-<br>
methylmorpholino)ethyl]carbodiimide (CMC), and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC).<br>
[0056] The result of Reaction A above is O-acylisourea-substituted hyaluronan;<br>
essentially the EDC molecule has been temporarily substituted onto the carboxylic acid group<br>
of a glcA residue from the HA molecule, making the carbon atom of the carboxylic acid<br>
group slightly positively charged. The electron pair from the terminal amine group of a<br>
tyramine molecule is then substituted onto the carbon atom via a nucleophilic substitution<br>
reaction as explained in the preceding paragraph (Reaction B). The result of Reaction B is<br>
the tyramine-substituted HA molecule (T-HA) and acylurea, a byproduct. It will be<br>
understood that Reactions A and B will result in a plurality of tyramine substitutions on the<br><br>
periodic glcA residues of HA molecules; a single substitution has been shown here for<br>
brevity and clarity.<br>
[0057] After formation of T-HA, a plurality of T-HA molecules are reacted via<br>
peroxide and peroxidase enzyme to cross-link T-HA molecules as previously described and<br>
illustrated above. That is, the hydroxyphenyl groups on the tyramine residues now attached<br>
to HA molecules react with peroxide (preferably H2O2) in the presence of a peroxidase to<br>
remove the phenolic hydrogen atom resulting in a tyramine free radical, with the unpaired<br>
electron associated with the phenolic oxygen atom. This free radical species isomerizes or<br>
resonates, resulting in a resonance structure (or free radical isomer) with the unpaired<br>
electron now associated with an ortho carbon atom on the phenolic ring. In this position, the<br>
unpaired electron quickly reacts with a similarly situated unpaired electron on another<br>
tyramine free radical to form a covalent bond therebetween. The result is a free-radical<br>
driven dimerization reaction between different tyramine free radical residues attached to<br>
different glcAs of the same or different HA molecules. This dimerized species further<br>
enolizes to restore the now-linked tyramine residues, resulting in a dityramine linkage<br>
structure. It will be understood that a plurality of reactions as herein described will occur<br>
between adjacent tyramine residues, resulting in a cross-linked macromolecular network of<br>
T-HA molecules having the following cross-linking structure:<br><br>
[0058] The cross-linked T-HA network can be provided with aggrecan molecules in a<br>
conventional manner, e.g. via link proteins, to provide a cross-linked T-HA network having<br>
aggrecan molecules attached to the HA chains. Thus, a network similar to that found in a<br>
normal cartilage aggregate can be provided, with the dityramine bonds holding the network<br>
together thereby constraining the contained aggrecan network, instead of collagen fibrils as in<br>
normal cartilage.<br><br>
similarly non-displaceable chondroitin sulfate network (and concomitant water-<br>
impermeability) as in normal cartilage, but without the extracellular collagen fibril matrix or<br>
the HA chains found in normal cartilage. In fact, by directly cross-linking chondroitin sulfate<br>
molecules, (instead of their core HA molecules as in the previously described embodiment),<br>
the repulsive force between adjacent chondroitin sulfate molecules may be strengthened,<br>
resulting in even stronger fluid flow resistance compared to normal cartilage. This may result<br>
in greater loading force absorption and dissipation capacity than normal cartilage because the<br>
interstitial fluid phase is even more constrained from flowing. In this embodiment, where<br>
chondroitin sulfate molecules are directly cross-linked, certain cartilage degenerative<br>
conditions are entirely circumvented; e.g. conditions where the core protein to which<br>
chondroitin sulfate molecules are ordinarily bonded in normal cartilage becomes cleaved<br>
between the HA binding domain (G1) and the second globular domain (G2) thus allowing the<br>
chondroitin sulfate rich region to diffuse out from the cartilage aggregate. In this<br>
embodiment, because the chondroitin sulfate molecules are directly cross-linked to one<br>
another, unassociated with an aggrecan or other proteoglycan molecule, they cannot be<br>
cleaved or carried away as in normal cartilage.<br>
[0062] Nonetheless, a tyramine cross-linked T-HA network (having an HA backbone<br>
chain with attached aggrecan molecules, which in turn include chondroitin sulfate chains)<br>
may be preferred because of the high availability of HA. This may be beneficial in the case<br>
of cartilage replacement or repair using the present invention, because the body's normal<br>
metabolic pathway for generating cartilage may be able to build directly onto an implanted<br>
tyramine cross-linked T-HA network as will be described.<br>
[0063] One further particular application where a cross-linked network according to<br>
the invention will have substantial utility is in the production of an artificial kidney. The<br>
kidney filters blood by two mechanisms: one is by size exclusion and the second is by charge<br>
exclusion. MEMS devices have been designed for use in artificial kidney devices, which<br>
contain precisely defined micropores that can effectively mimic only the size exclusion<br>
characteristics of the kidney. In a healthy kidney, the charge exclusion related filtration is the<br>
result of heparan sulfate proteoglycans present in a basement membrane, which separates two<br>
distinct cell types important for other kidney related functions. To mimic this charge barrier<br>
in the MEMS engineered artificial kidney, hydrogels can be prepared composed of either<br>
heparan sulfate or heparin that are cross-linked via dihydroxyphenyl (dityramine) links as<br><br>
described herein and provided within the pores of the MEMS device. This heparin/heparan<br>
sulfate hydrogel can then be sandwiched between two hyaluronan derived hydrogels (e.g. T-<br>
HA described above) as described herein, and containing one of each of the cell types<br>
normally found in a normally functioning kidney. The central heparin/heparan sulfate<br>
hydrogel provides the charge exclusion properties for the device. The outer two hyaluronan<br>
hydrogel layers provide protection from the immune system and fouling by normal cellular<br>
and molecular debris. Inclusion of the two cell types on opposite sides of the filtration barrier<br>
provides a cellular component in its normal physiologic orientation.<br>
[0064] In another promising application, the hydrogels herein described can be<br>
applied in developing an artificial pancreas. A problem in development of an artificial<br>
pancreas is the short half life of MEMS engineered glucose sensors due to fouling of the<br>
detector electrode in vivo. Coating of the surface of these detectors with a hyaluronan<br>
hydrogel (e.g. T-HA) as described herein would permit diffusion of the small molecular<br>
weight glucose molecules that they are designed to detect while providing protection from the<br>
immune system and fouling by normal cellular and molecular debris.<br>
[0065] In summary, it will be evident from the foregoing that macromolecules useful<br>
as scaffold materials for formation of hydrogels include but are not limited to<br>
polycarboxylates (containing free carboxylate groups), polyamines (containing free primary<br>
amine groups), polyphenols (containing free hydroxyphenyl groups) and their copolymers,<br>
examples of which have been described above. When polyphenols are used, the first step in<br>
preparing the network described above can be omitted because polyphenols already contain<br>
multiple or periodic hydroxyphenyl groups. Otherwise, both polycarboxylates and<br>
polyamines must have hydroxyphenyl groups added or substituted along their length,<br>
preferably via the above-described carbodiimide reaction pathway. The second step in<br>
preparing the network is to carry out an enzyme driven dimerization reaction between two<br>
hydroxyphenyl groups attached to adjacent macromolecules (whether polycarboxylates,<br>
polyamines or polyphenols) in order to provide a cross-linked structure. This step is carried<br>
out using a peroxide reagent (preferably hydrogen peroxide) in the presence of a suitable<br>
enzyme (preferably HRP) under metabolic conditions of temperature and pH.<br>
[0066] In the case of the preferred dityramine cross-linked T-HA network, in the first<br>
step the carboxyl groups on high molecular weight hyaluronan (HA) are substituted with<br>
tyramine which introduces reactive hydroxyphenyl groups into the HA molecule. This<br><br>
tyramine substitution reaction preferably is mediated by the carbodiimide, l-ethy]-3-(3-<br>
dimetbylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) with the degree of tyramine substitution on HA<br>
controlled by the molar ratios and absolute concentrations of tyramine, EDC and HA used in<br>
the reaction mix. Excess reagents such as unused tyramine and EDC are subsequently<br>
removed by dialysis, allowing isolation and recovery of high molecular weight tyramine-<br>
substituted HA (T-HA). The percent tyramine substitution within each T-HA preparation is<br>
easily calculated by measuring: 1) the concentration of tyramine present in the preparation,<br>
which is quantitated spectrophotometrically based on the unique UV-absorbance properties of<br>
tyramine at 275 ran (see Example 2 below); and 2) the concentration of total carboxyl groups<br>
in the HA preparation, which is quantitated spectrophotometrically by a standard hexuronic<br>
acid assay. By this technique, T-HA preparations which contain a percent tyramine<br>
substitution of only 4 - 6% have been routinely synthesized experimentally. At this level of<br>
tyramine substitution, the vast majority (preferably at least 60, 70, 80, 90, or 95, percent) of<br>
the HA molecule remains chemically unaltered, and therefore biologically functional. From<br>
this formulation of T-HA (i.e. 4 - 6% tyramine substitution) a wide range of biomaterials with<br>
a wide range of physical properties can be produced by simply varying the concentration of<br>
the T-HA used in the second step of the process.<br>
[0067] In the cross-linking reaction, solutions of T-HA are cross-linked to form<br>
hydrogels through an enzyme (peroxidase) driven reaction, which catalyzes the formation of<br>
a covalent bond between two tyramine adducts on adjacent HA molecules, producing a single<br>
dityramine cross-link. The formation of multiple, e.g. hundreds, of these dityramine cross-<br>
links per HA molecule result in formation of a stable 3-dimentional scaffold or hydrogel.<br>
Addition of very dilute peroxide (preferably H2O2) is required to initiate the cross-linking<br>
reaction as it is the peroxide, not -HA, that is the actual substrate for the peroxidase enzyme.<br>
The products of the reaction of the peroxidase enzyme on peroxide are free radicals that are<br>
preferentially taken up by the hydroxyphenyl rings of tyramine resulting in the formation of<br>
the dityramine cross-links. The dityramine linked structures are fluorescent blue (see<br>
Example 2), a property which is used to both image the hydrogc ■ and to quantify the degree<br>
of cross-linking within the hydrogels. Since the cross-linking reaction is enzyme driven, the<br>
hydrogels can be formed under physiologic conditions, and therefore can be formed in the<br>
presence of included cells or bioactive agents, or directly adjacent to living tissue while<br>
maintaining cell and tissue viability.<br><br>
[0068] The resulting hydrogels are optically clear with a wide range of physical<br>
properties depending on the initial T-HA concentration. For example, hydrogels formed from<br>
T-HA solutions of 6.25, 12.5,25, 50 and 100 mg/ml T-HA have been shown experimentally<br>
to have physical properties (rigidity, rheology and texture) of a jelly, a gelatin, a dough, a<br>
resilient rubber-like composition (similar to a rubber ball), and a cartilage-like material<br>
respectively- see Example 3. These materials have potential applications in a wide range of<br>
clinical settings including tissue engineering of both orthopedic (i.e. cartilage, bone, tendon,<br>
meniscus, intervertebral disk, etc.) and non-orthopaedic (kidney, liver, pancreas, etc.) tissues,<br>
gene and drug delivery, coating of non-biological devices for in vivo implantation (i.e.<br>
glucose sensors, artificial hearts, etc.), wound repair, biosensor design, and vocal cord<br>
reconstruction.<br>
[0069] Advantageous properties of the hydrogels described herein include the ability<br>
to: 1) provide easy characterization and quality control; 2) integrate with existing tissue<br>
matrices; 3) directly incorporate into newly formed matrices; 4) directly include cells and<br>
bioactive factors; 5) maintain biocompatibility, 6) control bioresorption; 7) cast easily into<br>
complicated anatomical shapes (see Example 4 below); and 8) exhibit the mechanical<br>
properties of native tissues such as articular cartilage.<br>
[0070] Current biologically-based surgical procedures for cartilage repair include<br>
autologous chondrocyte implantation, drilling, abrasion chondroplasty, microfracture, and<br>
mosaic arthroplasty. All these procedures treat only focal articular cartilage injuries, and not<br>
cartilage denuded joint surfaces such as seen in severe osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
Also, they use either cartilage tissue plugs or expanded chondrocytes harvested from the<br>
patient to fill cartilage defects. These tissues or chondrocytes are expected to fill the defect<br>
by synthesizing entirely de novo material, such as newly synthesized hyaline cartilage, that<br>
has integrated with existing cartilage matrices and has the biomechanical properties of normal<br>
cartilage. However, such procedures all promote the formation of a reparative tissue<br>
(fibrocartilage) rather than true hyaline cartilage with further mechanical damage to<br>
fibrocartilage thought to predispose the joint to osteoarthritis. Furthermore, the availability<br>
of endogenous cartilage as a repair material is quite limited with its acquisition presenting its<br>
own risks and morbidity to the patient. As evident from the foregoing discussion and as will<br>
become further apparent based on the following Examples, the synthetic macromolecular<br>
networks and resulting hydrogels disclosed herein present practical materials for promising<br><br>
new therapies in patients suffering from cartilage degenerative diseases. The materials are<br>
entirely synthesized from commercially available ex vivo reagents and so involve no<br>
morbidity to the patient which conventionally would be required to harvest endogenous<br>
material. In addition, the hydrogel (particularly T-HA) can be implanted as an effective<br>
cartilage substitute in cartilage denuded joints as a direct intervention for patients suffering<br>
from cartilage-degenerative diseases because they can be synthesized so as to emulate the<br>
behavior of normal, healthy cartilage.<br>
[0071] Rather than relying on synthetic or natural materials or on chondrocytes to<br>
produce de novo an implantable, synthetic cartilage-like extracellular matrix (ECM), the<br>
present inventors initially focused on purifying the molecules that give cartilage its form and<br>
structural characteristics, and then minimally modifying these molecules to make a material<br>
resistant to biological degradation. While chondrocytes still may be relied on for<br>
maintenance of the synthetic ECM provided by the macromolecular (e.g. T-HA) network<br>
post-implantation (e.g. chondrocytes can be embedded into the hydrogel materials as<br>
described above), they are not relied on for de novo synthesis. Instead, the basic structure of<br>
the synthetic materials described here is modified by cross-linking via a dihydroxyphenyl,<br>
preferably dityramine linkage chemistry, to ensure its survival. On further development and<br>
experimentation, as will be seen in the following Examples it was discovered mat hydrogels<br>
can be made from such materials having a wide array of viscoelastic and other physical<br>
properties that can be tuned by appropriate and judicious selection of reagent concentrations<br>
and cross-linking conditions to approximate or simulate the properties of other native tissues<br>
for which it is or may be desirable to provide a synthetic implantable substitute.<br>
[0072] As the Examples below demonstrate, the present hydrogels can be prepared<br>
having widely varying properties that are suitable for any number of synthetic tissue<br>
implantation or augmentation, as well as other clinical applications. As already described,<br>
the present materials can be used to repair cartilage defects produced as a result of either<br>
injury or disease. Defects due to injury that can be so repaired can be sports- or accident-<br>
related, and may involve only the superficial cartilage layer, or may include the underlying<br>
subchondral bone. Defects due to disease which can be repaired using the compositions<br>
described herein include those resulting from osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Whether<br>
from injury or disease, such defects may be in either mature or growth plate cartilage.<br>
Formulations for hydrogels for synthetic growth plate cartilage may require the inclusion of<br><br>
unsubstituted scaffold material in order to allow for controlled bioresorption of the<br>
biomaterial during growth.<br>
[0073] Another potential clinical application for treatment of damaged or arthritic<br>
joints is as a replacement for synovial fluid. Conventionally referred to as<br>
viscosupplementation therapy, this currently involves injection of a solution of uncross-<br>
linked HA into a damaged or arthritic joint, which provides sustained pain relief for weeks<br>
even though the HA is cleared from the joint in 1-2 days. Use of the T-HA hydrogels<br>
described herein should provide an extended benefit due to their longer i?i vivo persistence<br>
compared to uncross-linked HA.<br>
[0074] Another field where the hydrogels described herein will be useful is the repair,<br>
reconstruction or augmentation of cartilaginous as well as soft tissues of the head and neck.<br>
The availability of biomaterials for soft tissue augmentation and head and neck reconstruction<br>
has remained a fundamental challenge in the field of plastic and reconstructive surgery.<br>
Significant research and investment has been undertaken for the development of a material<br>
with appropriate biological compatibility and life span. The outcomes of this research have<br>
not been promising. When placed in immunocompetent animals the structural integrity of<br>
currently proposed materials has been shown to fail as the framework is absorbed.<br>
Furthermore, though conventional synthetic materials offer excellent lifespan, they present<br>
certain unavoidable pitfalls. For example, silicones have been fraught with concerns of<br>
safety and long-term immune related effects. Synthetic polymers PTFE (gortex) and silastic<br>
offer less tissue reactivity but do not offer tissue integration and can represent long term risks<br>
of foreign body infections and extrusion. The materials described in this application will be<br>
useful to prepare a synthetic soft-tissue scaffold material for the augmentation or repair of<br>
soft-tissue defects of the head and neck. In particular, a cross-linked tyramine-substituted<br>
hyaluronan (T-HA) hydrogel, which is non-inflammatory, non-immunogenic, and which can<br>
be prepared having the appropriate degree of viscoelasticity (see Examples below), could be<br>
used as an effective implantable scaffold material. In addition, the unique ability of the<br>
preferred enzyme-driven cross-linking chemistry to maintain cell viability permits inclusion<br>
of cells such as chondrocytes directly into the hydrogels during formation which can be<br>
performed in situ at a defect site. Thus, the need to sculpt or mold an anatomically<br>
compatible graft shape to fit a particular defect site is eliminated.<br><br>
[0075] The dityramine cross-linked T-HA network described above has particular<br>
utility for producing artificial or synthetic cartilage. The present hydrogel materials can be<br>
used, for example, as a novel, biocompatible and biocompliant material to prepare cartilage<br>
implants which are frequently used in reconstructive procedures of the head and neck to<br>
repair cartilaginous or bony defects secondary to trauma or congenital abnormalities.<br>
Applications specific to the ear include otoplasty and auricular reconstruction, which are<br>
often undertaken to repair cartilaginous defects due to trauma, neoplasm (i.e., squamous cell<br>
carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma), and congenital defects such as microtia.<br>
Applications specific to the nose include cosmetic and reconstructive procedures of the nose<br>
and nasal septum. Dorsal hump augmentation, tip, shield and spreader grafts are frequently<br>
used in cosmetic rhinoplasty. Nasal reconstruction following trauma, neoplasm, autoimmune<br>
diseases such as Wegeners granulomatosis, or congenital defects require cartilage for repair.<br>
Septal perforations are difficult to manage and often fail treatment Cartilage grafts would be<br>
ideal for these applications, as autologous or donor cartilage is often unavailable.<br>
Applications specific to the throat include laryngotracheal reconstruction, which in children<br>
usually requires harvesting costal cartilage, which is not without morbidity. Auricular and<br>
septal cartilage is often inadequate for this application. Synthetic cartilaginous materials<br>
prepared from hydrogels disclosed herein can be synthesized to suit each of the foregoing<br>
applications, based on tuning parameters of hydrogel synthesis such as reagent concentration,<br>
substitution and cross-Unking rates, etc., as evident from the below Examples.<br>
Laryngotracheal reconstruction is usually performed for airway narrowing due to subglottic<br>
or tracheal stenosis. The etiology may be traumatic (i.e., intubation trauma, or tracheotomy)<br>
or idiopathic. Other possibilities include chin and cheek augmentation, and use in ectropion<br>
repair of the lower eyelid, in addition to numerous craniofacial applications. It should be<br>
noted that these applications may not need cartilage with the exacting mechanical properties<br>
of articular cartilage. Inclusion of a cell population or bioactive agents may also be desirable.<br>
[0076] The hydrogel materials described herein also can be used for repair and<br>
narrowing of the nasal cavity, normally following overly aggressive surgical resection, to<br>
prevent the chronic pooling of fluid in the nasal passages that leads to infection and<br>
encrustation. Another promising application is in laryngotracheal reconstruction in both<br>
children and adults, as a result of laryngotracheal injury due for example to intubation during<br>
a surgical procedure such as cardiovascular surgery. Damaged tracheal cartilage at the<br>
anterior and posterior portion of the tracheal ring can be replaced with pre-cast hydrogel<br><br>
bile ducts of the liver. The bile ducts form a branching network within the liver<br>
and exit the liver via two main branches that are combined into the common bile<br>
duct which drains the liver and gallbladder of bile into the duodenum. The bile<br>
ducts are very narrow in diameter, measuring only up to 2 nun normally at their<br>
largest most distal portions, and yet they must normally drain liters of bile every<br>
day from the liver into the duodenum. Any blockage of these ducts can result in a<br>
serious condition known as jaundice, which allows many toxins and especially<br>
hemoglobin breakdown products to accumulate in the body. PSC is a scarring or<br>
stricturing disease of the bile ducts within the liver and in the extrahepatic bile<br>
ducts described above that connect the liver to the small intestine. The bile duct<br>
strictures of PSC may be treated or prevented with the present hydrogels.<br>
for treatment of chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is a chronic<br>
inflammatory disease of the pancreas that may be complicated by scars or<br>
strictures of the pancreatic ducts. These strictures block the drainage of pancreatic<br>
juice, which normally must exit the pancreas through a system of ducts or<br>
drainage conduits into the small intestine. The pancreatic juice contains many<br>
digestive enzymes and other elements important to normal digestion and nutrient<br>
absorption. Blockage or narrowing of the pancreatic ducts by chronic pancreatitis<br>
can results in severe complications in which the pancreas autodigests and forms<br>
life-threatening abdominal infections and or abscesses. The pancreatic strictures<br>
of chronic pancreatitis may be treated or prevented with the present hydrogels.<br>
for treatment of gallstone-induced bile duct and pancreatic duct strictures.<br>
Gallstones are a very common disorder, a principal complication of which is the<br>
formation of bile duct and pancreatic duct strictures, which may be treated or<br>
prevented with the hydrogels.<br>
for treatment of ischemic bowel disease. The intestines are prone to the formation<br>
of scars or strictures when their blood supply is compromised. Compromised<br>
blood flow is called ischemia, and can be caused by many pathologies, including<br>
cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, hypotension, hypovolemia, renal or<br>
hepatic disease-induced hypoalbuminemia, vasculitis, drug-induced disease, and<br>
many others. The end stage result of all of these etiologies can result in intestinal<br>
strictures that block off the bowel and prevent its normal function. The present<br>
hydrogels may be used to treat or prevent ischemic bowel strictures,<br>
for treatment of radiation-induced intestinal strictures. Radiation therapy for<br><br>
cancer is associated with numerous morbidities, important among which is<br>
intestinal stricture formation. The present hydrogels may be used to treat or<br>
prevent radiation-induced intestinal strictures.<br>
[0079] In addition to making synthetic tissues, the hydrogels disclosed here also can<br>
be used to provide a coating for non-biological structures or devices to be used in surgery or<br>
otherwise for in vivo implantation, such as surgical instruments, or ceramic or metal<br>
prostheses. Such a coating would provide a barrier between the non-biologic device material<br>
and living tissue. The role of hydrogels as a barrier for non-biologic devices includes, but is<br>
not limited to: 1) prevention of absorption of macromolecules and/or cells on the surfaces of<br>
non-biologic devices, which can lead to protein fouling or thrombosis at the device surface;<br>
2) presentation of a non-toxic, non-inflammatory, non-immunogenic, biologically compatible<br>
surface for devices made from otherwise non-biologically compatible materials; 3)<br>
compatibility with device function such as diffusion of glucose for a glucose sensor,<br>
transmission of mechanical force for a pressure sensor, or endothelization of a vascular graft<br>
or stent; 4) enhancement of device function, such as providing a charge barrier to an existing<br>
size barrier in a MEMS based artificial nephron; 5) incorporation into non-biologic devices of<br>
a viable cell population entrapped within an aqueous, physiologically compatible<br>
environment; and 6) inclusion of drugs or bioactive factors such as growth factors, anti-viral<br>
agents, antibiotics, or adhesion molecules designed to encourage vascularization,<br>
epithelization or endothelization of the device.<br>
[0080] Based on the foregoing, the hydrogels of the present invention may be used to<br>
provide a non-allergenic coating for a variety of implantable devices including an implantable<br>
glucose sensor for management of diabetes. In addition, the hydrogels may be used to<br>
provide: a charge barrier for the development of MEMS-based artificial nephrons; an<br>
aqueous, physiologically compatible environment in which embedded kidney cells such as<br>
podocytes can be incorporated into a MEMS-based artificial nephron design; and a coating<br>
for implantable MEMS devices designed for a variety of purposes including, but not limited<br>
to, drug delivery, mechanical sensing, and as a bio-detection system.<br>
[0081] The disclosed hydrogels, and particularly a hyaluronan-based hydrogel, also<br>
may be covalently attached to silicon-based devices, e.g. through first covalent attachment of<br>
the primary amine of tyramine to the silicon surface to provide a hydroxyphenyl coated<br>
surface chemistry. This may use the same chemistry used to bind DNA that has been<br><br>
modified with a free amine to silicon surfaces. The HA-based hydrogel then is covalently<br>
coupled to the hydroxyphenyl coated surface by the same peroxidase driven chemistry used<br>
in its preferred cross-linking mode described above.<br>
[0082] The hydrogels also can be used for coating non-biologic cardiovascular<br>
devices such as catheters, stents and vascular grafts. These would include devices made from<br>
materials conventionally not used because of their biological incompatibility, but which have<br>
superior design characteristics to those devices currently in use. Bioactive factors could be<br>
incorporated into the hydrogels to promote endothelization or epithelization of the hydrogel,<br>
and thus of the implanted device.<br>
[0083] A particularly promising application mentioned above is in the design and<br>
implementation of an implantable artificial glucose sensor for the treatment and management<br>
of diabetes. Effective glycemic control requires frequent measurement of blood glucose<br>
levels, which currently requires a pin prick (or "finger stick") to obtain a blood sample.<br>
There is tremendous clinical interest in a reliable, cost-effective method of blood glucose<br>
measurement and in preventing hypoglycemia, which is the cause of most severe life-<br>
threatening events. From a technological standpoint, microsensors have been very successful<br>
over the last decade in a wide variety of applications. The successful development of a<br>
biocompatible long term implantable glucose sensor would significantly impact routine<br>
monitoring of glucose levels by diabetic individuals and play a major contributory role in the<br>
further development of a bioartificial pancreas.<br>
[0084] A design of a sensor for use during cardiovascular surgery has been published,<br>
Clark IX!, Lyons C, "Electrode system for continuous monitoring in cardiovascular surgery,"<br>
Annals of New York Academy of Science, 102:29-45 (1962).. Subsequently, efforts have<br>
been directed toward developing and testing an implantable device that could mimic the<br>
native glucose/insulin control system. Besides the obvious advantage of serving as part of a<br>
bioartificial pancreas, such a system could be coupled with telemetry hardware and thereby<br>
give the patient advance warning of hypoglycemia.<br>
[0085] Prior work on implantable glucose sensors generally follows one of two<br>
approaches. The first involves placing sensors into blood vessels such as the vena cava or the<br>
carotid artery. The second involves placing sensors subcutaneously. These sensors may<br>
involve a microdialysis probe or more commonly, an amperometric enzymatic-based<br><br>
transducer. It is believed the risk of thrombosis and hematogenous spread of infection<br>
mitigate against the long term use of intravascular sensors. While the exact relationship<br>
between blood and subcutaneous glucose concentrations is still being investigated, recent<br>
work suggests that mass transfer modeling methods can significantly improve the estimates<br>
of blood glucose levels that are based on subcutaneous data. Furthermore, there are<br>
significant advantages associated with subcutaneous sensors: clinical safety, ease of insertion<br>
and removal, ease of coupling these sensors to a telemetry system and cost. There is<br>
substantial evidence that subcutaneous placement of a glucose sensor will work and will lead<br>
to much longer life of the sensor than if it were to contact blood directly.<br>
[0086] However, a major problem in the design of any continuous glucose sensor for<br>
clinical use remains the long-term drift of the sensor, usually caused by fouling of the<br>
electrode when exposed to human tissue or the gradual loss of enzyme activity. The<br>
introduction of various membranes to act as a glucose or a hydrogen peroxide barrier has, in<br>
general, improved sensor performance but it has not resulted in long term stability. The<br>
much heralded membrane for this purpose, Nafion, rapidly deteriorates when implanted in the<br>
body. Introduction of an implant into subcutaneous tissue elicits both acute and chrome<br>
inflammatory responses. Together these result in a complexly orchestrated growth of new<br>
tissue which ultimately envelops the implant with a foreign body capsule (FBC). In the short<br>
term, it is likely that inflammatory cells metabolize glucose and thereby cause artifacts in the<br>
glucose readings. When discussing the problems with long-term use of subcutaneous<br>
sensors, experts maintain that the diminished response in vivo can be ascribed to the protein<br>
or cellular coating around the sensor which interferes with the mass transport of glucose. If<br>
suitable covering membranes for the sensor could be provided to exclude interfering<br>
substances or control coating or encapsulation with proteins and cells, the excellent<br>
performance in vitro may be matched in vivo. The use of the HA-based hydrogels described<br>
herein as a coating agent to both minimize the FBC and keep it away from the sensor<br>
membrane should prove a useful solution.<br>
[0087] The purpose is to control the tissue response to an implantable glucose sensor<br>
using a HA-coating on the sensor membrane. A sheath of HA-based hydrogel will give the<br>
sensor membrane "breathing space" by preventing proteins and cells from clogging the<br>
diffusion of glucose and oxygen into the sensor. Prior experience has indicated that HA and<br>
its derivatives are extremely biocompatible and as a consequence are used in situations where<br><br>
the host tissue response needs to be minimized (e.g., in eye implantation surgery). Thus,<br>
sensor performance should be enhanced in the long term when HA-based hydrogels are cast<br>
around sensor membranes as it relates to the development of an implantable glucose sensor<br>
with the long term perspective that such a sensor should result in improved blood glucose<br>
monitoring and ultimately improved quality of life for the diabetic population. In addition,<br>
the novel cross-linking structure of the HA-based hydrogels herein disclosed will ensure<br>
long-term maintenance of such a coating which will provide significant longevity to a<br>
subcutaneously implanted glucose sensor.<br>
[0088] Still another promising application is in the production of a bioartificial kidney<br>
for the treatment of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The only current treatment options for<br>
ESRD patients are renal replacement therapy (all forms of dialysis) and transplantation.<br>
Transplantation is limited by the shortage of donor organs, and is complicated by the<br>
necessary and expensive life-long use of immunosuppressive drugs. Alternatively, although<br>
dialysis can prolong the life of ESRD patients, average life expectancy on dialysis is reduced<br>
by 50%, and the remaining quality of life is far from ideal. Repeated vascular access and<br>
handling of the patient's blood leads to frequent and sometimes life threatening infections.<br>
[0089] The functional unit of the kidney is the nephron. The nephron begins with a<br>
filtering structure, the glomerulus, which is of a tuft of capillaries surrounded by epithelial<br>
cells (podocytes) and supported by mesenchymal cells (the mesangium). The glomerulus is<br>
connected directly to the tubule of the nephron, a long tube lined with a single layer<br>
epithelium of polarized cells. The tubule cells function to salvage fluid, electrolytes and<br>
nutrients from the filtrate (by both intracellular transport and pericellular movement)<br>
concentrating the filtrate into urine. All nephrons connect into the collecting system, a<br>
network of epithelial-lined tubes, which has some additional reabsorptive properties, but<br>
primarily functions to direct the urine to the bladder. The filtration unit of the nephron, the<br>
glomerulus, consists of the endothelial cell of the capillary arteriolar wall, the podocyte<br>
surrounding the exterior of the capillary, and the glomerular basement membrane (GBM)<br>
sandwiched between the two cell types. The glomerular capillaries are some of the smallest<br>
vascular beds in the body, and the glomerular endothelial cells are specialized for their<br>
function by being fenestrated to allow direct contact of the blood plasma to the filtration<br>
barrier. Although these fenestrated endothelia do restrict the movement of leukocytes and<br>
very large molecules into the filtrate, the permselectivity of the filtration barrier is defined by<br><br>
the podocyte and the GBM.<br>
[0090] The GBM is a classic basement membrane structure composed of the<br>
prototypic molecules: type IV collagen (a3, a4, a5 heterotrimers), laminin (Laminin-11, a5,<br>
P2, yl heterotrimers), HS proteoglycans (perlecan and agrin) and nidogen (nidogen-1 and -2);<br>
as well as several additional ECM molecules including, collagen V, fibronectin, a CS<br>
proteoglycan (bamacan) and several small leucine-rich proteoglycans (biglycan, decorin,<br>
podocan). The GBM is synthesized by both the endothelial cell and the podocyte. Each cell<br>
produces a complete basement membrane which subsequently fuses during development to<br>
form one, double thickness basement membrane. The GBM has important functions in<br>
providing the appropriate microenvironment and substrata for the podocytes and endothelial<br>
cells. Without a normal GBM, both cell types lose their typical morphology and cellular<br>
differentiation characteristics, which subsequently destroys glomerulus function. The GBM<br>
also functions in filtration by restricting the movement of water and has some contribution to<br>
the size and charge selectivity, however, the majority of permselectivity is dictated by the<br>
podocyte.<br>
[0091] The podocyte is a highly specialized epithelial cell and has unique function in<br>
the glomerulus. The podocyte extends lamellipodia that wrap around the capillaries,<br>
branching into very fine interdigitations with other podocytes. On cross section, these<br>
interdigitated cellular extensions are called foot processes (FP) and the spaces between the<br>
FPs, where filtration occurs, are called slits. The podocyte synthesizes a macromolecular<br>
structure that spans the slit, the slit diaphragm (SD), which forms a bridge between two<br>
adjacent FPs. The molecular composition and structure of the SD is not fully understood.<br>
The SD appears to be a modified adherens junction containing additional podocyte-specific<br>
proteins, the most notable being nephrin. Nephrin extends from the plasma membrane of one<br>
FP and forms a homodimeric interaction with another nephrin molecule extending from the<br>
adjacent FP, creating a zipper-like structure when viewed in cross section by electron<br>
microscopy. How the SD and nephrin function as a permselective barrier is not known, but is<br>
currently a very active area of research.<br>
[0092] Biological microelectromechanical systems (bioMEMS) are a promising area<br>
of exploration for development of next generation bioartificial kidneys. Drug delivery<br>
systems, immunoisolators, and capillary networks, as well as precise control of cell<br>
differentiation and growth have been demonstrated for bioMEMS. The kidney is the first<br><br>
organ for which chronic substitutive therapy has been accepted, and application of the<br>
bioMEMS toolkit to treatment of ESRD is both evolutionary in the technology and<br>
revolutionary in the end product. Silicon micromachining technology has evolved such that<br>
structures with feature sizes on the order of 1 - 100 nanometers can be reliably produced in<br>
quantity. These dimensions are on the order of those for the glomerular slit diaphragm. The<br>
facility with which standard silicon bulk and surface micromachining technology permits<br>
microfluidic control, patterned deposition of cells and extracellular matrix proteins, and<br>
immunoisolation of cells, lends itself to tissue engineering of artificial organs. The<br>
engineering of nanoscale semiconductor filtration membranes could permit independent<br>
control and investigation of charge-size selectivity with the potential to lead to the tissue<br>
engineering of a bioartificial glomerulus and eventually a complete nephronal unit.<br>
[0093] One of the first components in the miniaturization of a bioartificial kidney is<br>
development of a nanofabricated hemofiltration membrane (NHM) from bioMEMS<br>
components. The NHM is intended to serve the hemofiltration function of the glomerulus in<br>
the nephron-like devices of a bioartificial kidney. NHM arrays can be fabricated using<br>
standard silicon micromachining techniques containing slit pores of approximately the<br>
dimensions of the glomerular slit diaphragm, and conducted experiments to demonstrate its<br>
size barrier characteristics similar to those of the glomerular basement membrane. The<br>
chemistries and hydrogels described in this patent application can be used to provide two<br>
additional and necessary components to the filtration characteristics of the NHM that are<br>
required for glomerular function. The first is a charge barrier component similar to those of<br>
the glomerular basement membrane. This would be provided by application of a layer of<br>
heparan sulfate (HS) based hydrogel. HS is a type of GAG similar to HA and CS. The<br>
second addition is inclusion of the podocytes, which are responsible for the majority of the<br>
filtration function of the glomerulus through the slit diaphragm. The podocytes would be<br>
applied to the surface of the HS-based hydrogel layer in a HA-based hydrogel layer, which<br>
would also serve to provide a layer of biocompatibility. The presence of the HS layer should<br>
facilitate proper matrix-cell interactions and stimulate the deposition of an appropriate<br>
basement membrane.<br>
[0094] The hydrogels described herein, including but not limited to tyramine-based<br>
hyaluronan hydrogels, also can be used as research and clinical reagents. One promising<br>
application is controlled or extended release drug delivery. In this application, the drug can<br><br>
be trapped within a sphere or other suitable shape of hydrogel material composed of a central<br>
spherical or other shaped core of hydrogel formulated at a relatively high macromolecular<br>
concentration (and thus lowest porosity), onto which concentric spherical layers of hydrogel<br>
are coated, each successively coated layer being formulated of a progressively lower<br>
macromolecular concentration (and thus higher porosity). Release of the drug is then<br>
controlled by the rate of hydrogel degradation if so engineered, binding of the drug to the<br>
hydrogel scaffold and diffusion of the drug through the scaffold pores. The hydrogel sphere<br>
then is implanted into a patient at an appropriate location to effect extended release of the<br>
drug.<br>
[0095] Targeted drug deliver also can be achieved through an affinity-based strategy<br>
based on designed affinity of drug laden hydrogel particles to specific tissue and cell types.<br>
To this end, the hydrogels can be used as an affinity-based medium for the selective binding<br>
and thus purification of specific cell populations through incorporation of targeted cell<br>
binding molecules within the hydrogels during or prior to cross-linking. Once a select cell<br>
population is bound to the hydrogel affinity-based medium they could be released for further<br>
investigation, or directly entrapped while bound to the hydrogel affinity-based medium into<br>
other formulations of the hydrogels for other tissue engineering or clinical applications.<br>
[0096] Such an affinity-based medium also can be used for the selective binding and<br>
purification of hyaluronan binding proteins. As the entire medium can be made solely of<br>
hyaluronan with no other support material background binding should be quite low. By using<br>
other materials as the scaffold material (such as aggrecan) other affinity-based media can be<br>
prepared for purification of molecules that selectively bind to those scaffold materials.<br>
[0097] Such an affinity-based medium also can be used for selective binding and<br>
purification of specific macromolecules or cell populations through incorporation of protein<br>
A within the hydrogels during cross-linking. Antibodies specific to the macromolecule or<br>
cell population of interest can then be used to coat the protein A infused hydrogels with the<br>
antibodies optimally oriented with their antigen binding (Fab) arms directed outward and their<br>
constant (Fc) domain bound to the protein A. Once a select cell population or macromolecule<br>
is bound to the protein A hydrogel, it could be released for further investigation, or directly<br>
entrapped while bound to the protein A hydrogel into other formulations of the hydrogel for<br>
other tissue engineering or clinical applications. Alternatively antibody could be directly<br>
incorporated into the hydrogels.<br><br>
[0098] The disclosed hyaluronan-based hydrogel materials also have utility as a<br>
diagnostic for the presence of hyaluronidases which can be predictive of the metastatic<br>
potential of certain cancers; e.g. by coating of a biopsy slide with hyaluronan hydrogel and<br>
measurement of the extent and localization of the loss of intrinsic fluorescence of the<br>
hydrogel material due to its dityramine cross-links as the hydrogel is digested by endogenous<br>
hyaluronidases. By using other materials as the scaffold material (such as aggrecan) other<br>
degradative enzymes could be detected such as metaloproteinases.<br>
[0099] Further aspects of the invention will be understood in conjunction with one or<br>
more of the following examples, which are provided by way of illustration.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0100] Experimental quantities of tyramine-substituted hyaluronan hydrogels having<br>
dityramine cross-links according to the invention have been prepared as follows. HA is<br>
dissolved at 1 mg/ml based on hexuronic acid in 250 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic<br>
acid (MES), 150 mM NaCl, 75 mM NaOH, pH 6.5 containing a 10-fold molar excess of<br>
tyramine relative to the molar concentration of HA carboxyl groups. Tyramine substitution<br>
onto the carboxyl groups is then initiated by the addition of a 10-fold molar excess of EDC<br>
relative to the molar concentration of the HA carboxyl groups. A l/10th molar ratio of N-<br>
hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) relative to the molar amount of EDC is added to the reactions to<br>
assist the EDC catalyzed amidation reaction by formation of active esters. Reactions are<br>
carried out at room temperature for 24 hours, after which the macromolecular fraction is<br>
recovered from unreacted small molecular weight reactants such as tyramine, EDC, NHS,<br>
and MES by exhaustive dialysis versus 150 mM NaCl and then ultrapure water followed by<br>
lyophilization. After lyophilization, the tyramine-substituted HA (T-HA) product is<br>
dissolved to working concentrations of between 5 and 100 mg/ml in PBS (which is a buffer<br>
compatible with cell suspension, in vivo tissue contact, and the cross-linking reaction) to<br>
provide various concentration preparations depending on the desired rigidity of the final<br>
hydrogel. Alternatively, the solvent can be any other suitable solvent besides PBS that will<br>
not substantially negatively impact the enzyme activity and that will not interfere with cross-<br>
linking reaction via selective uptake of free radicals generated by the enzyme. Suitable<br>
alternative solvents include water, conventional biological tissue culture media, and cell<br>
freezing solution (generally composed of about 90% blood serum and about 10% dimethyl<br><br>
sulfoxide). Prior to suspension of cells (see Example 5) or contact with tissues in vivo, the T-<br>
HA should be filtered through a 0.2 urn filter. Next, tyrarnine-tyrarnine linking is carried out<br>
by adding 10 U/ml of type II horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to each T-HA preparation.<br>
Cross-linking is initiated by the addition of a small volume (1-5 u.1) of a dilute hydrogen<br>
peroxide solution (0.012%-0.00012% final concentration) to yield the final hydrogel with<br>
desired rigidity. For preparation of larger quantities or volumes of a desired hydrogel,<br>
quantities of reagents provided in this paragraph could be scaled up appropriately by a person<br>
of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0101] An experiment was conducted to determine the degree of tyramine substitution<br>
(and consequent dityramine cross-linking) for a T-HA macromolecular network according to<br>
the invention. Initially, three formulations of (uncrosslinked) tyramine-substituted<br>
hyaluronan (T-HA) were prepared as described above, designated OX, IX or 10X. The OX<br>
formulation was prepared using no EDC (i.e. containing no carbodiimide), meaning there was<br>
no carbodiimide present to mediate the reaction for creating an amide bond between the NH2<br>
group on tyramine and a CO2H group on the HA molecules. Thus, the OX formulation can be<br>
considered a control. The IX formulation contained a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio of EDC based<br>
on the quantity of CO2H groups present on the HA molecules in the reaction mixture. The<br>
10X formulation contained a 10:1 stoichiometric ratio (or 10-fold excess) of EDC based on<br>
the quantity of CO2H groups present on the HA molecules in the reaction mixture. In all<br>
three formulations, a stoichiometric excess of tyramine was provided relative to the quantity<br>
of CO2H groups on HA. In all three formulations (OX, IX and 10X) the reactants and the<br>
appropriate amount of EDC for the formulation were combined in a vial and agitated to<br>
facilitate the tyramine-substitution reaction. All three formulations were allowed to react for<br>
24 hours at room temperature, after which the vial contents were dialyzed to remove<br>
unreacted tyramine molecules, EDC and acylurea (EDU) byproducts of the reaction. These<br>
molecules were easily separated from HA and any formed T-HA molecules through dialysis<br>
due to the relatively small size of tyramine, EDC and EDU compared to macromolecular HA.<br>
Once unreacted tyramine and EDC were removed, the remaining contents for each<br>
formulation were analyzed to determine the rate of tyramine substitution relative to the total<br>
number of available CO2H sites present on HA molecules.<br>
[0102] Tyramine exhibits a UV absorbance peak at 275 nm, making the degree of<br><br>
tyramine substitution easily detectible against a tyramine calibration curve. Based on UV-<br>
spectroscopic analysis of the above three T-HA formulations, it was discovered that the HA-<br>
tyramine substitution reaction carried out with no EDC present (formulation OX) resulted in<br>
substantially zero tyramine substitution onto the HA molecules. This confirmed the<br>
importance of using a carbodiimide reaction pathway in the tyramine substitution reaction.<br>
However, the tyramine absorption in the T-HA formulation prepared using a 1:1 EDCrCOjH<br>
stoichiometric ratio in the tyramine substitution reaction (formulation IX) resulted in a<br>
tyramine substitution rate of about 1.7% relative to all available CO2H groups on the HA<br>
chains. The 10X formulation (10:1 EDC:CO2H ratio) resulted in about a 4.7% substitution<br>
rate.<br>
[0103] Subsequently, hydrogen peroxide and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were<br>
added to each of the three dialyzed HA/T-HA formulations (OX, IX and 10X) at 5 mg/mL<br>
and the resulting formulations were allowed to react to completion. After reaction in the<br>
presence of peroxide and HRP, it was observed that the OX formulation remained entirely<br>
liquid, having a strong meniscus; no gel formation was observed, confirming the fact that no<br>
or substantially no tyramine substitution had occurred when no EDC was used in the<br>
tyramine substitution reaction. For the IX formulation, only a very weak meniscus was<br>
observed and the contents of the vial had gelled, confirming that both tyramine substitution<br>
and cross-linking had occurred. For the 10X formulation, a relatively rigid gel had formed,<br>
and in fact had shrunk relative to the initial volume of fluid in the container, leaving a<br>
quantity of liquid (having a meniscus) on top. The gel prepared from the 10X formulation<br>
(having a 4.7% tyramine substitution rate) was much firmer and more rigid than that from the<br>
1X formulation having a 1.7% tyramine substitution rate.<br>
[0104] The dityramine structure exhibits a blue fluorescence on exposure to UV light.<br>
The products of each of the above formulations were exposed to UV light to detect the<br>
presence of dityramine cross-links. As expected, both the IX and 10X hydrogels exhibited<br>
blue fluorescence (the 10X hydrogel fluorescence being more intense than that of the IX<br>
hydrogel), while the OX formulation exhibited no blue fluorescence at all. This confirmed the<br>
presence of dityramine cross-links in both hydrogels, and that the occurrence of dityramine in<br>
the more rigid hydrogel (10X) was greater than in the less rigid hydrogel (IX).<br>
[0106] The overall result was that the importance of the carbodiimide-mediated<br>
reaction pathway was demonstrated, and it was confirmed that the relative rigidity of a<br><br>
hydrogel formed from a cross-linked T-HA network is proportional to the degree of<br>
dityramine cross-linking, which is in turn proportional to the degree of tyramine-substitution -<br>
onto HA. It was quite a surprising and unexpected result that even a 1.7% tyramine-<br>
substitution rate (and subsequent cross-linking rate to form dityramine links) provided a<br>
suitably firm T-HA gel (or hydrogel). A 4.7% substitution (and cross-linking) rate resulted in<br>
even a firmer T-HA gel. Also surprising was that a ten-fold stoichiometric excess of<br>
carbodiimide (EDC) relative to the quantity of carboxylic acid groups present in the reaction<br>
mixture (formulation 10X) resulted in only about a 4.5-4.7% tyramine substitution rate, yet<br>
stable and cohesive tyramine cross-linked T-HA networks were nonetheless achieved.<br>
[0107] This means that the majority of the carboxylic acid groups on the HA<br>
molecules are unsubstituted and not tyramine cross-linked, essentially remaining the same as<br>
in the native HA molecule, yet the resulting network is a cohesive and stable hydrogel.<br>
Therefore, when used as a cartilage substitute in vivo, because a majority of the HA<br>
molecules in the invented T-HA network or gel are essentially unaltered compared to HA in<br>
normal cartilage, it is believed that the body's native metabolic pathways (aided or unaided<br>
by cells provided within the T-HA network) may recognize the invented network as native<br>
biologic material, and will be able to carry out ordinary synthesis and metabolism functions<br>
with respect thereto. In addition, it is noted that HA is a highly ubiquitous material in the<br>
body, and is non-immunogenic in humans. As a result, the cross-linked macromolecular<br>
network, comprised a majority of unaltered native HA, will have substantial application in a<br>
wide variety of tissue engineering applications where it is desirable or necessary to provide<br>
synthetic tissue in a human body. This represents a significant advance over the state of the<br>
art. Therefore, quite surprisingly, a high degree of tyramine substitution, e.g. greater than about 10-20%, maybe undesirable; the above described experiments demonstrated that such<br>
high degrees of substitution are unnecessary to provide a suitable T-HA network. Preferably,<br>
a dihydroxyphenyl (e.g. dityramine) cross-linked polycarboxylate (e.g. HA) network has a<br>
hydroxyphenyl (tyramine) substitution rate of less than 50, preferably less than 40, preferably<br>
less than 30, preferably less than 20, preferably less than 15, preferably less than 10, preferably less than 9, preferably less than 8, preferably less than 7, preferably less than 6,<br>
preferably less than 5, percent based on the total quantity of CO2H groups present on the<br>
polycarboxylate (HA) molecules.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
[0108] Conventionally, it has been believed that natural cartilage exhibits its<br>
viscoelastic properties and its ability to resist deformation and absorb compressive loads<br>
principally as a result of the repulsive forces between negatively charged SO42- groups on<br>
adjacent chondroitin sulfate chains present in the aggrecan matrix. An experiment was<br>
performed to determine the efficacy of various macromolecular networks within the scope of<br>
the invention to resist deformation and absorb compression compared to natural cartilage. In<br>
particular, three such networks were prepared, respectively, composed of the following: 1)<br>
dityramine cross-linked HA molecules (T-HA); 2) dityramine cross-linked chondroitin<br>
sulfate molecules in the form of aggrecan (T-Aggrecan); and 3) a composite material<br>
composed of 50% T-HA and 50% T-Aggrecan. Formulations of uncross-linked T-HA and T-<br>
Aggrecan were prepared and purified as in Example 1, each having a tyramine substitution<br>
rate of about 5%. From these T-HA and T-Aggrecan formulations, five different<br>
concentrations of the T-HA alone, T-Aggrecan alone and a 50:50 mixture of T-HA and T-<br>
Aggrecan were prepared:<br>
Concentration 1: 6.25 mg total T-GAG / mL water<br>
Concentration 2: 12.5 mg total T-GAG / mL water<br>
Concentration 3: 25 mg total T-GAG / mL water<br>
Concentration 4: 50 mg total T-GAG / mL water<br>
Concentration 5: 100 mg total T-GAG / mL water.<br>
[0109] The notation T-GAG is used herein to embrace both T-HA and T-Aggrecan.<br>
Though aggrecan technically is not a glycosaminoglycan (GAG), for purposes of this<br>
example T-GAG nonetheless is defined to embrace both T-HA and T-Aggrecan hydrogels.<br>
Each of the above preparations was then reacted in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and<br>
horseradish peroxidase, also as in Example 1, to form dityramine cross-links between the T-<br>
GAG molecules and provide respectively Hydrogels 1,2, 3,4 and 5 for each of the three<br>
material compositions. Each of the fifteen hydrogels (five concentrations for each of the<br>
three material compositions) was found to be a stable and substantially coherent material with <br>
the physical properties of each hydrogel varying relative to the concentration of T-GAG in<br>
the preparation from which it was made. For example, qualitatively T-HA Concentration 1<br>
resulted in T-HA Hydrogel 1 having rigidity and rheological properties comparable to that of<br>
Vaseline or jelly; the hydrogel was stable and coherent yet could be caused to flow or spread<br>
on application of an external force, e.g. from a spatula or other conventional tool. T-HA<br><br>
Hydrogel 1 exhibited excellent adhesive properties making it an ideal candidate for a<br>
nonallergenic coating material for surgical instruments during surgery, e.g. ophthalmologic<br>
surgery. T-HA Hydrogel 2 was more rigid than T-HA Hydrogel 1 due to the greater<br>
concentration of T-HA in the preparation from which it was made, and the consequent<br>
predicted decrease in intramolecular cross-linking and increase in intermolecular cross-<br>
linking associated with increased T-HA concentration. T-HA Hydrogel 2 exhibited<br>
rheological and rigidity properties characteristic of gelatins, with a degree of viscoelastic<br>
reboundability on external loading. On greater loading, T-HA Hydrogel 2 was found to break<br>
up into smaller pieces instead of flowing, also characteristic of a gelatinous material. T-HA<br>
Hydrogel 3 had the properties and consistency of a dough or malleable paste, also not flowing<br>
on application of an external loading force. This material also exhibited substantially greater<br>
viscoelastic properties compared to T-HA Hydrogels 1 and 2. T-HA Hydrogel 4 was a highly<br>
rigid and coherent gel that strongly resisted breaking up on application of an external loading<br>
force. T-HA Hydrogel 4 was a highly resilient rubber-like composition that actually<br>
generated substantial springing force upon sudden compression (e.g. dropping onto the floor).<br>
This ability of T-HA Hydrogel 4 to generate such a springing force in response to a sudden<br>
compression may make this material ideal for certain joint replacement/repair applications<br>
where the joint undergoes repeated and periodic compressional loading (e.g. the ankle joint).<br>
In addition to the properties described for T-HA Hydrogel 4, T-HA Hydrogel 5 had cartilage-<br>
like properties with both the appearance of articular cartilage and the feel of cartilage upon<br>
cutting with a surgical blade.<br>
[0110] Confined compression tests were performed to quantitatively determine the<br>
compressive mechanical properties of the fifteen different hydrogels. A custom built<br>
polycarbonate confining chamber, and porous polypropylene filter platen (20 µm pores, 20%<br>
porosity) were used to perform the confined compression testing. Five cylindrical plugs (7.1<br>
mm in diameter, approximately 3 mm in thickness) at each hydrogel concentration for each<br>
of the three material compositions were made using the confining chamber and the freeze-<br>
thaw technique described in Example 4 below. The following testing protocol was followed<br>
for a series of stress relaxation tests in confined compression. All testing was performed<br>
using an Instron 5543 machine under computer control, which recorded the time-<br>
displacement-load data at a frequency of 10 Hz. A ±5 N or ±50 N load cell (Sensotec) was<br>
used to monitor load throughout each test. A step of 30 µm (30 µm /sec), representing 1 %<br>
strain, was applied until the sample reached equilibrium. This was defined as a relaxation<br><br>
rate that slowed to less than 10 mN min-1, at which time the next step was automatically<br>
started, until 20 cycles (representing approximately 20% strain) were completed. The<br>
thickness of each sample tested in confined compression was determined mechanically, by<br>
measuring the displacement at which the compressive response initiated relative to the<br>
bottom of the chamber as measured with the Instron 5543 machine. The measured thickness<br>
was used to calculate the strain percentage for each step.<br>
[0111] The compressive mechanical properties of the fifteen hydrogels were<br>
determined as described in the preceding paragraph. Load data was normalized by sample<br>
cross-sectional area (39.6 mm2) to compute stress. The equilibrium stress was plotted against<br>
the applied strain for each material formulation. The aggregate modulus at each step was<br>
defined as the equilibrium stress divided by the applied strain. For each material, the<br>
aggregate modulus was defined as the slope of the equilibrium stress-strain data in the most<br>
linear range. Figs. 4a, 4b and 4c display the equilibrium compression behavior for the five<br>
concentrations of T-HA, T-Aggrecan and 50:50 T-HA/T-Aggrecan composite hydrogels,<br>
respectively. All fifteen hydrogels were testable in confined compression, and demonstrated<br>
characteristic stress relaxation responses typical of biphasic materials (such as cartilage). The<br>
aggregate moduli for the 6.25 mg/ml and 12.5 mg/ml T-GAG hydrogels were 1-2 orders of<br>
magnitude lower than articular cartilage. The 25 mg/ml T-GAG hydrogels, as well as the 50<br>
mg/ml T-aggrecan hydrogel, displayed aggregate moduli on the order of, but at least 30%<br>
lower than that of articular cartilage. All the 100 mg/ml T-GAG hydrogels, as well as the 50<br>
mg/ml T-HA and the all the composite hydrogels, displayed aggregate moduli, equal to or<br>
exceeding reported literature values for articular cartilage. These data demonstrate the ability<br>
to characterize hydrogels using standard mechanical assays, and to generate hydrogels with<br>
similar mechanical properties to a wide variety of tissues including that of articular cartilage,<br>
using a variety of glycosaminoglycans as the hydrogel scaffold material.<br>
[0112] The aggregate moduli for the five concentrations of the T-HA, T-Aggrecan<br>
and composite materials composed of 50% T-HA and 50% T-aggrecan are summarized<br>
below in Table 1.<br><br><br>
[0113] Fig. 4d shows the measured aggregate modulus as a function of concentration<br>
for the T-HA, T-Aggrecan and composite hydrogels. As the concentration of the T-HA<br>
hydrogels increases, a plateau is reached for the aggregate modulus while the T-Aggrecan<br>
hydrogels display a linear relationship. Interestingly, the composite hydrogels show a<br>
relationship indicative of an exponential increase in compressive properties as concentration<br>
increases. This indicates that the moduli of other hydrogel materials can be predicted by<br>
further exploring and modeling these relationships.<br>
[0114] Based on the above experiments it was surprisingly and unexpectedly<br>
discovered that a dityramine cross-linked GAG network (HA or aggrecan) will produce a<br>
coherent hydrogel material whose rigidity and other physical (rheological) properties can be<br>
tuned by varying the T-GAG concentration prior to cross-linking the tyramine groups to suit<br>
a particular application. The coherence and elastic properties of these hydrogels was<br>
observed even absent any (or substantially any) SO42- groups in the network to supply the<br>
charge-to-charge repulsive forces to generate the material's compression resistance and<br>
elasticity. This was a highly surprising and unexpected result with substantial positive<br>
consequences in tissue engineering applications. Hyaluronan is a highly ubiquitous and non-<br>
immunogenic molecule found in humans. Therefore, hydrogels comprised of dityramine<br>
cross-linked hyaluronan networks can be used to provide suitable tissue replacement<br>
materials that can be implanted within a human body, whose rigidity can be tuned based on<br>
the application as evidenced by this example. As these materials can or will be composed of<br>
predominantly unaltered hyaluronan which is non-immunogenic, the hydrogels should result<br><br>
in zero or substantially zero immune response. This is an important advantage over many<br>
conventional tissue engineered 'materials whose formation chemistries prevent their<br>
application in vivo due to harsh reaction conditions or reagents, and whose final chemical<br>
structures are more likely to induce an immune response.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
[0115] A number of methods of preparing hydrogels such as those described in<br>
Example 3 have been developed to cast or form the hydrogel into a predetermined three-<br>
dimensional shape. This is important for myriad tissue engineering applications where it is<br>
necessary to provide artificial tissue material to fill a native tissue defect or void within a<br>
patient.<br>
[0116] A first method is to employ an in situ forming technique where the hydrogel is<br>
formed in place, i.e. in position and in the shape of its final application and structure. The in<br>
situ formation method has been carried out experimentally as follows. Tyramine-substituted<br>
hyaluronan (T-HA) was prepared via the carbodiimide-mediated pathway described herein.<br>
Following dialyzation to remove unreacted tyramine, EDC, NHS, etc., and dissolution at the<br>
desired concentration in PBS (see Example 1 above), a small quantity of horseradish<br>
peroxidase enzyme was added to the T-HA liquid preparation to form a first solution. This<br>
first solution was provided into a laboratory container (to simulate an in vivo situs) having a<br>
specific interior geometry. Subsequently, a second solution was prepared containing very<br>
dilute hydrogen peroxide (0.012%-0.00012% final concentration). A small volume of this<br>
second solution relative to the first solution was then injected into the container already<br>
containing the first solution to initiate the dityramine cross-linking reaction to yield the<br>
hydrogel. Hydrogels prepared by this technique have been prepared having varying rigidity<br>
and rheological properties as described above in Example 3, and conformed well to the<br>
interior surface contour of the container in which they were formed. Because the principal<br>
reagents (H2O2, hyaluronan and peroxidase) are either nonallergenic or diffusible molecules,<br>
and because the cross-linking reaction proceeds under metabolic conditions of temperature<br>
and pH, this technique can be performed in vivo at a surgical situs in a patient as a surgical<br>
procedure to produce a defect-conforming hydrogel. This method is particularly attractive<br>
for reconstructive facial surgery in which the uncross-linked T-HA preparation (with<br>
peroxidase) can be injected and manipulated subcutaneously by the surgeon to produce the<br>
desired facial contours and then the hydrogel subsequently cross-linked by injection of a<br><br>
it freezes into^a solid ice form conforming to the shape and contour of the inner mold surface.<br>
However, the silicone mold, having a glass transition temperature below -80°C, remains soft<br>
and malleable and the solid ice form of the first solution is easily removed. Because the first<br>
solution expands as it freezes, suitable mechanical hardware should be used to ensure the<br>
silicone mold does not deform or expand as the solution freezes. Preferably, port holes are<br>
provided in the mold to allow for expansion and discharge of the first solution as it expands<br>
during the freezing process.<br>
[0119] Once the solid ice form of the first solution has been demolded, minute defects<br>
or flaws in the three-dimensional structure can be repaired by carving with a suitable tool,<br>
and more of the liquid first solution can be added to fill surface voids, which liquid instantly<br>
freezes on contact with the solid ice form. Also, the ice form can be placed back on the dry<br>
ice surface if desired to ensure uniform temperature and freezing of any added first solution<br>
material. Once the three-dimensional shape of the ice form has been perfected, it is<br>
immersed in a liquid peroxide solution to initiate thawing of the frozen water and dityramine<br>
cross-linking from the outside-in. This is possible do to the rapid kinetics of the cross-linking<br>
reaction. Cross-linking is determined to be complete once the last remaining frozen water has<br>
melted at the center of the forming hydrogel form, which can be easily observed because the<br>
forming hydrogel is substantially clear.<br>
[0120] Very successful experiments have been performed according to this freeze-<br>
thaw technique to produce a solid hydrogel in the shape of a human ear. Other structures that<br>
could be formed by this method, such as intervertebral discs, meniscus, etc. will be evident to<br>
those skilled in the art. It should be noted in this freeze-thaw technique, the threshold glass<br>
transition temperature of-80°C for the mold material is selected to correspond roughly with<br>
the surface temperature of solid CO2 (dry ice), to ensure the mold material does not become<br>
brittle when the first solution is frozen to produce the solid ice form. However, if another<br>
cooling material, other than CO2 is used, then the threshold glass transition temperature for<br>
suitable mold materials may be adjusted accordingly.<br>
[0121] For the three methods of hydrogel formation described above, the first solution<br>
contained both the peroxidase and T-HA, while the second solution contained the peroxide.<br>
While it may be possible to switch the peroxidase and peroxide in the first and second<br>
solutions respectively, it is less preferred to provide the peroxide in the first solution with the<br>
T-HA. This is because once the peroxide, peroxidase and T-HA are combined, the T-HA<br><br>
rapidly begins to form a cross-linked macromolecular network. If the peroxidase (which is a<br>
macromolecular molecule) is not already uniformly distributed with the T-HA it may be<br>
unable or substantially hindered from diffusing through the pore structure of the forming<br>
hydrogel to facilitate uniform cross-linking throughout the entire T-HA/peroxide solution.<br>
The result could be non-uniform and/or incomplete cross-linking of the T-HA and a non-<br>
uniform hydrogel. Conversely, the relatively small peroxide molecule (hydrogen peroxide is<br>
only one oxygen atom larger than water) can diffuse through the hydrogel pore structure with<br>
relative ease, resulting in a uniform hydrogel structure.<br>
[0122] In addition, the macromolecular size of the peroxidase allows it to be similarly<br>
retained as the T-HA within porous molds that are only porous to small molecular weight<br>
peroxides which easily and uniformly diffuse through both the molds and newly forming<br>
macromolecular networks (i.e. hydrogels). For these reasons it is preferred to start with the<br>
peroxidase uniformly distributed with the T-HA in the first solution, and to provide the<br>
peroxide separately in the second solution.<br>
[0123] A fourth method is an alternating sprayed or brushed layering technique. The<br>
first solution is prepared as described above and contains both the peroxidase and T-HA.<br>
However, the second solution not only contains the peroxide as described above, but also T-<br>
HA at the same concentration as in the first solution. Then a thin layer of the first solution is<br>
applied at the desired location (in situ) followed by an overlying thin layer of the second<br>
solution. This procedure is repeated such that alternating layers of the first and second<br>
solutions are successively applied until the defect or application situs has been completed.<br>
The very thin alternating layers of the first and second solutions promote virtually complete<br>
dityramine cross-linking ensuring a highly coherent final hydrogel having the desired<br>
rheological properties based on the initial T-HA concentration of the two solutions. The thin<br>
nature of the layers is desirable to ensure that free radicals produced by the peroxidase in the<br>
first solution layers are able to penetrate completely adjacent second solution layers and<br>
complete cross-linking independent of peroxidase diffusion into the second solution layer<br>
(see above). T-HA is included in both solutions to ensure uniform T-HA concentration<br>
throughout the final hydrogel. This technique has been performed in laboratory bench<br>
experiments and has provided contour-conforming and volume-filling coherent hydrogels.<br>
This technique is highly applicable where it is desired to provide a thin, but variable layer of<br>
tyramine cross-linked HA, such as on the surface of a denuded osteoarthritic joint in which<br><br>
little if any native healthy cartilage remains in the patient at the implant site.<br>
[0124] All four of the above techniques have been described with respect to<br>
dityramine cross-linked hyaluronan, however it will be understood that other combinations<br>
within the scope of the present invention (other dihydroxyphenyl cross-linked<br>
macromolecules, such as polycarboxylates, polyamines, polyhydroxyphenyl molecules and<br>
copolymers thereof) can be molded via the above techniques.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
[0125] Rat chondrocytes were embedded in (cross-linked) T-HA hydrogels to<br>
measure their ability to survive the cross-linking reaction. Isolated chondrocytes were<br>
suspended in the 1.7% and 4.7% T-HA hydrogels described in Example 2 by providing these<br>
live cells to the first solution to be co-dispersed with the T-HA and peroxidase, followed by<br>
introduction of the peroxide-containing second solution to initiate dityramine cross-linking.<br>
The chondrocyte-embedded 1.7% and 4.7% T-HA hydrogels exhibited uniformly distributed<br>
chondrocytes with the optical clarity of the gels allowing visualization throughout the gel.<br>
Glucose utilization was used as an indicator of cell viability after cross-linking to form the<br>
hydrogels as chondrocytes are voracious with respect to glucose consumption, depleting the<br>
medium of glucose in less than 24 hours. The results showed that chondrocytes embedded in<br>
T-HA hydrogels showed essentially the same glucose consumption profile over 24 hours as<br>
the same chondrocytes cultured in monolayer (Fig. 5). This continued for up to 7 days<br>
indicating that the cells were alive and metabolically active. Medium glucose was measured<br>
by standard hexokinase assay.<br>
[0126] Fluorescent images of frozen sections of T-HA hydrogels containing both<br>
chondrocytes and cartilage tissue were also generated. HA samples from both the hydrogel<br>
scaffold and cartilage matrix were visualized by fluorescent staining with biotinylated HA<br>
binding protein (b-HABP) reagent while cell nuclei were visualized with standard DAPI<br>
stain. The b-HABP reagent is prepared from purified cartilage aggrecan (the G1 domain<br>
only) and link protein, and recognizes and irreversibly binds to stretches of native HA<br>
equivalent to those normally bound by aggrecan and link protein in cartilage. The results<br>
showed a more intense staining of the T-HA hydrogel with b-HABP than the cartilage as the<br>
hyaluronan in the tissue is already occupied by native aggrecan and link protein. No visible<br>
distinction could be seen between the T-HA scaffold of the hydrogel and the matrix of<br>
suspended cartilage tissue suggesting seamless integration. These results demonstrated the<br><br>
feasibility of maintaining the viability of chondrocytes during the hydrogel cross-linking<br>
reactions, and the ability of the hydrogel to integrate seamlessly into existing cartilage matrix,<br>
both of which are advantageous for application to cartilage repair. The results also<br>
demonstrated that sufficient stretches of the T-HA remain chemically unaltered, and available<br>
for binding by newly synthesized aggrecan and link protein in situ. The results also<br>
demonstrated that oxygen, carbon dioxide, glucose and insulin are diffusable through T-HA<br>
hydrogels according to the invention at a rate that is not limiting to chondrocyte metabolism,<br>
which is important not only to the development of cartilage substitutes but to other<br>
applications such as glucose sensor design and development of an artificial kidney.<br>
[0127] In order to include cells such as chondrocytes in hydrogels molded into<br>
intricate anatomical shapes using the freeze/thaw technique described in Example 4, it is<br>
desirable that the enzyme driven cross-linking reaction proceed in the presence of standard<br>
cell freezing solutions such as those containing 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)/90% fetal<br>
bovine serum (FBS). This has been demonstrated in the laboratory for all of the T-HA<br>
hydrogel formulations described in Example 3. The ability to directly incorporate a solution<br>
containing 90% FBS also demonstrates the ability to include bioactive factors such as growth<br>
factors, hormones and factors controlling cell differentiation, as these are normal components<br>
ofFBS.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
[0128] An experiment was conducted whereby a T-HA hydrogel as described<br>
hereinabove was implanted into Yucatan minipigs in order to repair articular cartilage<br>
defects. Following is a description of that experiment, including the experimental methods<br>
and results obtained, after a brief discussion of the background for this application.<br>
Background<br>
Tissue Description<br>
[0129] Articular Cartilage Structure and Function - As discussed above, articular<br>
cartilage is the resilient load-bearing tissue that forms the articulating surfaces of diarthrodial<br>
joints. It absorbs mechanical shock and deflects or spreads applied load over greater surface<br>
area of subchondral bone. It consists primarily of a large extracellular matrix (ECM) with a<br>
sparse population of highly specialized cells (chondrocytes) distributed throughout the tissue.<br>
The primary components of the ECM are water, cartilage aggregates and type II collagen.<br><br>
Cartilage aggregates are composed of hyaluronan (HA), aggrecan (the large cartilage-specific<br>
proteoglycan), and link protein (LP), a small glycoprotein. Aggrecan contains a central core<br>
protein to which is attached ~ 100 chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains. The core protein has three<br>
globular domains with the N-terminal globular 1 (G1) domain having binding sites for both<br>
HA and LP. LP has sequence homology to the G1 domain of aggrecan, and contains binding<br>
sites for both HA and the G1 domain of aggrecan. Each cartilage aggregate is composed of a<br>
single HA chain, to which are attached hundreds of aggrecan/LP duplexes. These large<br>
cartilage aggregates are trapped at one fifth of their free solution volume within a tight<br>
meshwork of type II collagen fibers, which resist further swelling. This molecular<br>
architecture contributes to the tissues mechanical properties and function as described below.<br>
[0130] Swelling Pressure - The HA and CS chains in cartilage aggregates contain<br>
repeating carboxyl and/or sulfate groups. In solution, these groups become ionized (COO'<br>
and SO3"), and in the physiologic environment they require positive counter ions such as Na+<br>
to maintain overall electroneutrality. These free-floating ions within the interstitial water are<br>
present at a higher concentration than that found in the surrounding fluids (i.e. synovial fluid)<br>
giving rise to an osmotic pressure (Donnan pressure). In cartilage, ions are prevented from<br>
flowing out of the tissue along the concentration gradient by the fixed nature of their negative<br>
counter ions (i.e. the COO" and SO3" groups on the HA and/or CS chains), and the need to<br>
maintain electroneutrality. Water flow into the tissue to equilibrate the concentration<br>
gradient is resisted by the inextensible nature of the collagen meshwork preventing further<br>
swelling.<br>
[0131] Alternatively, tight cartilage aggregate packing causes the fixed-negative<br>
charge groups to be spaced only 10 to 15 angstroms apart, resulting in strong charge-to-<br>
charge repulsive forces (electrorepulsive forces). As with the Donnan effect, the tendency to<br>
swell to lessen these repulsive forces is resisted by the inextensible nature of the collagen<br>
meshwork. When compressed, the distances between charge groups decrease, thus increasing<br>
the charge-to-charge repulsive forces and increasing the free-floating positive counter ions<br>
concentration. Thus both the Donnan and electrorepulsion effects are intensified by<br>
compression. Both effects contribute to the swelling pressure of articular cartilage and its<br>
ability to resist deformation and absorb compressive loads.<br><br>
[0132] Stress Shielding Effect - Articular cartilage is often described as a viscoelastic,<br>
biphasic material, composed of a solid phase (cartilage aggregates, collagen, etc.) and a fluid<br>
phase (water and dissolved ions). The macromolecular architecture of the ECM of articular<br>
cartilage functions to deflect applied forces during loading from the wear susceptible solid<br>
phase of the tissue to the wear resistant fluid phase or water. This stress shielding occurs due<br>
to the elegant design of the cartilage ECM which produces a material with very low<br>
permeability creating a drag during interstitial fluid flow. Interstitial fluid pressure is<br>
generated during compressive loading, and during dynamic loading, is the primary force<br>
responsible for supporting the applied load with matrix compression a minor factor. During<br>
compression, the porosity is reduced further, which increases the already high frictional drag<br>
forces. The load support is gradually transferred from the fluid phase (as the fluid pressure<br>
dissipates) to the solid phase. Typically, for normal cartilage, this equilibration process takes<br>
2.5 to 6.0 hours to achieve. Thus, load support through fluid pressurization predominates<br>
within the tissue.<br>
Need for Synthetic Material<br>
[0133] Increased water content and decreased proteoglycan content are the most<br>
apparent early changes in osteoarthritic cartilage. These changes reflect an increase in tissue<br>
permeability. Increased permeability diminishes the fluid pressurization mechanism of load<br>
support in cartilage (stress shielding), requiring the collagen-aggrecan solid matrix to bear<br>
more load, which may be an important contributing factor in the development and<br>
progression of cartilage degeneration. Bioartificial cartilage substitutes that do not mimic the<br>
low permeability of normal, healthy articular cartilage may be predisposed to degeneration by<br>
a similar mechanism.<br>
[0134] One of the most difficult challenges facing orthopedic surgeons is treating<br>
patients who have suffered focal cartilage lesions, but are too young or too active for a total<br>
joint replacement. These localized cartilage defects can be very debilitating. Restoring these<br>
localized areas without a total joint replacement would be a preferred approach with<br>
significant benefits including reduced surgical requirements, shorter recovery times, lower<br>
cost, and slowing or arresting the further degradation of the load bearing surface.<br>
[0135] This example demonstrates the application of a tyramine-substituted HA (T-<br>
HA) hydrogel for repair of this type of localized cartilage defect.<br><br>
Experimental Description<br>
Design of Extracellular Matrix Material having Desired Properties<br>
[0136] Natural articular cartilage has the elastic as well as physical and chemical<br>
properties described above, which impart its unique ability to absorb mechanical loads and to<br>
deflect impact loads away from the subchondral bone. To produce a suitable synthetic<br>
cartilage material made from a T-HA hydrogel as disclosed herein, it was important to design<br>
the macromolecular network for the hydrogel so as to emulate those properties as nearly as<br>
possible through judicious selection of reagent concentrations, cross-linking conditions,<br>
incorporated living cells as well as other molecules, etc.<br>
[0137] The results from confined compression testing of T-HA hydrogels (see<br>
Example 3 above) provided an initial basis for the synthesis of an appropriate synthetic T-HA<br>
material having properties matched to those measured for normal articular cartilage. They<br>
also illustrate the spectrum of material properties that can be manufactured from a single<br>
formulation of T-HA. Based on those data, a T-HA hydrogel composed of, inter alia a<br>
macromolecular network of dityramine cross-linked hyaluronan molecules was selected<br>
based on the following criteria in order to produce a synthetic implantable cartilage material.<br>
[0138] A material composed solely of HA was chosen because hydrogel compositions<br>
with the compressive properties of cartilage could be formed using HA alone as the scaffold<br>
material (Example 3), while avoiding possible host response to the protein component of<br>
aggrecan if it were used as a scaffold material. Reaction conditions (tyramine/EDC ratio)<br>
were chosen to produce a percent tyramine substitution of 5% (Example 2) as this provided<br>
sufficient cross-linking to produce a material with the compressive properties of cartilage<br>
(Example 3) while maintaining the majority of the native HA structure. HA was substituted<br>
with ~5% tyramine, as described in Example 1, except that the HA was dissolved at 5 mg/ml<br>
rather than 1 mg/ml to conserve reagents. The absolute concentration of all other reagents<br>
remained the same so that the tyramine and EDC were at a 2-fold rather than 10-fold molar<br>
excess based on the molar concentration of HA carboxyl groups. A concentration of 125<br>
mg/ml of HA in sterile saline was chosen as this concentration in saline had a compressive<br>
aggregate modulus most closely resembling that of articular cartilage (saline data not shown).<br>
It was also the concentration deemed most appropriate based on the experience of our<br>
clinician collaborator. Peroxidase was added at 10 U/ml prior to application in an in situ<br><br>
cross-linking protocol as described below. The in situ cross-linking protocol was chosen as it<br>
provided the best opportunity for integration with surrounding cartilage matrix. It also<br>
allowed easy and complete filling of the surgically produced cartilage defect without the need<br>
to know or measure the defect's exact dimensions. Pre-cast (in vitro cross-linked) plugs<br>
would either require exact dimensions or sculpting of pre-formed shapes to fit the defect. No<br>
cells or bioactive factors where added in this experiment as this experiment was intended to<br>
evaluate the hydrogel material independent of complicating factors derived from inclusion of<br>
cells or bioactive factors. However, cells or bioactive factors could be included as described<br>
hereinabove to produce desired effects.<br>
Surgical Procedure<br>
[0139] Pre-Operative - After arrival in the biological resource unit, Yucatan<br>
minipigs (~7-8 months of age, -30-35 kg) were maintained for a minimum of 7 days to<br>
ensure full acclimatization. After pre-medication with Ketamine (20 mg/kg I.M.) as<br>
anesthesia and Ambipen (40,000 U/kg I.M.) as prophylaxis antibiotic, the animal's rear legs<br>
were shaved and painted in Betadyne as simultaneous bilateral surgery of both knees was<br>
performed. A general anesthesia was maintained by inhalation with Isoflurane (1-2.5%<br>
volume) in O2 following intubation. Thiopental was used as needed (to effect 25 mg/ml<br>
I. V.). During surgery, the animal was monitored for heart rate, respiration rate, body<br>
temperature, etc.<br>
[0140] Opening - A longitudinal midline skin incision was made and carried down<br>
sharply through the pre-patellar bursa. Electrocautery was used for hemostasis. The lateral<br>
border of the patella was identified and a lateral para-patellar arthrotomy was performed.<br>
The lateral retinaculum and musculature were tagged with #1 vicryl suture. The patella was<br>
dislocated medially to expose the femoral trochlea.<br>
[0141] Cartilage repair - As seen in Fig. 6, two circular full thickness chondral<br>
defects (-4.5 mm in diameter, panel B of Fig. 6) were created in the medial trochlear facet of<br>
the femoral chondyle (panel A of Fig. 6) using an Acufex 4.5 mm mosaiaplasty chisel and a<br>
sharp, curved currette taking care as much as possible not to disrupt the osteochondral plate.<br>
The defects were filled with in situ cross-linked T-HA hydrogel (125 mg/ml in sterile saline)<br>
as follows to produce a hydrogel implant having the composition described above in order to<br>
reproduce the in vitro measured compressive properties of natural cartilage as described<br><br>
above. Initially, each defect was rinsed with 0.01 cc of 0.6% hydrogen peroxide, and then<br>
immediately blotted dry with sterile gauze. Subsequently, a plug containing 0.15 cc of<br>
uncross-linked hydrogel paste (panel C of Fig. 6) having the composition and prepared as<br>
described above was inserted into and used to fill each defect with the surgeon smoothing the<br>
surface of the hydrogel implant with fingertips to match the contour of the articular surface.<br>
A sterile piece of filter paper (Whatman 50) soaked in 0.6% hydrogen peroxide was pressed<br>
against the surface of the hydrogel implants for five minutes to cross-link the hydrogel in the<br>
defect. During the 5 minutes, the filter paper was rubbed back and forth across the implant<br>
surface to prevent integration with the filter paper, and to effectively polish the implant<br>
surface. After 5 minutes the filter paper was removed, excess hydrogel trimmed from the<br>
site, and then -0.01 cc (1 drop) of 0.6% hydrogen peroxide added to the surface of each<br>
implant plug (panel D of Fig. 6). The Patella was reduced anatomically over the femoral<br>
trochlea. The Patella was dislocated and reduced again to ensure secure primary stability of<br>
the hydrogel.<br>
[0142] Closing - The joint was irrigated with sterile saline. The wounds were closed<br>
in layers with vicryl sutures. Specifically, the arthrotomy was closed with interrupted #1<br>
vicryl suture, the subcutaneous tissue was closed with interrupted 2-0 vicryl suture and the<br>
skin layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 vicryl suture. No restriction of movement was<br>
required after surgery.<br>
[0143] Post-Operative - The animal returned to full weight bearing immediately<br>
following surgery. Analgesia was provided by Buprenorphine (0.02 mg/kg I.M.) for 24 hours<br>
and a Fentanyl Patch (50 mcg/hr) for 3 post-operative days. Post-operative prophylactic<br>
antibiotic in the form of cephalexin 500 mg twice per day was given for 7 days. The animals<br>
were kept in a conventional animal run.<br>
[0144] Post-Implantation Data - At one month post-implantation, the animal was<br>
euthanized with overdose of the barbiturate, Beuthanasia D Special (1 ml/10 kg B.W., I.V.)<br>
under general anesthesia. After euthanasia, the entire knee joint was carefully dissected,<br>
macroscopically evaluated and photo documented. As seen in Fig. 7, macroscopic inspection<br>
of the knees at 1 month revealed no significant effusion and no evidence of inflammatory<br>
reaction. The lesions were partially filled with a white material (the implanted T-HA<br>
hydrogel as well as other factors or cells which may have migrated into the hydrogel post-<br><br>
operatively) and the surrounding articular cartilage and opposing articular surface (patella)<br>
were normal in appearance except for a slight abrasion appearing on the opposing articular<br>
surface as seen in panel B of Fig. 7. It is not evident this abrasion was the result of rubbing<br>
against the implants, particularly given its location on the Patella in a position which does not<br>
appear as though it would have abraded against the implants during normal articulation of the<br>
joint.<br>
[0145] The results indicate no apparent negative effect on joint health as a result of<br>
the hydrogen peroxide or peroxidase reaction used for in situ cross-linking of the hydrogel,<br>
and demonstrated the utility of the hydrogels disclosed herein, comprising a dityramine cross-<br>
linked hyaluronan macromolecular network, as a synthetic implantable extracellular matrix<br>
for use as a synthetic in vivo cartilage replacement or implant material.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
[0146] An experiment was conducted whereby a T-HA hydrogel as described<br>
hereinabove was implanted into canine and rabbit models in order to repair vocal cord defects<br>
as well as to augment vocal cords. Following is a description of that experiment, including<br>
the experimental methods and results obtained, after, a brief discussion of the background for<br>
this application.<br>
Background<br>
Tissue Description<br>
[0147] The vocal cords are complex, multilayered structures under very fine<br>
neuromuscular control. The overlying mucosa is composed of a non-keratinized, stratified<br>
squamous epithelium, with a multilayered, lamina propria deep to the epithelium.<br>
Underlying the lamina propria is a muscular layer consisting of the thyroarytenoid muscle<br>
which inserts into the thyroid cartilage anteriorly and the vocal process of the arytenoid<br>
cartilage posteriorly. The thyroarytenoid muscle can stiffen or relax, altering the tension on<br>
the lamina propria and thereby altering the vibratory dynamics of the epithelium, which<br>
produces the finely coordinated vibrations responsible for high quality speech production.<br>
[0148] The biomechanics of human voice production have been attributed to the<br>
action of certain biological macromolecules naturally found within the extracellular matrix<br>
(ECM) of the lamina propria. Hyaluronan (HA) is a ubiquitous molecule, which is most<br><br>
concentrated in specialized tissues such as the vocal cords, synovial fluid, umbilical cord,<br>
dermis, and cartilage. In these tissues, its function is manifold, influencing tissue viscosity,<br>
shock absorption, wound healing, and space filling.<br>
[0149] The unique structure of HA elucidates its multiple functions. It consists of D-<br>
glucuronic acid and N-acety]glucosamine arranged in repeating disaccharide chains,<br>
containing as many as 30,000 repeating disaccharide units with a mass of more than 10<br>
megadaltons. As HA is a polysaccharide instead of a protein, it is non-antigenie. Under<br>
biological conditions, it is a negatively charged, randomly coiled polymer, filling a volume<br>
more than 1,000 times greater than expected based on molecular weight and composition<br>
alone. The strong negative charges attract cations and water, allowing it to assume the form<br>
of a strongly hydrated gel, and giving HA its unique viscoelastic and shock-absorbing<br>
property.<br>
[0150] Vocal cord viscoelasticity is essential to high quality voice production, as it<br>
directly affects the initiation and maintenance of phonation and the regulation of vocal cord<br>
fundamental frequency. HA in the human glottis is concentrated in the lamina propria and its<br>
importance has been quantified by comparing the biomechanical properties of cadaveric<br>
vocal cords with and without HA. Treatment of the vocal cords with hyaluronidase led to a<br>
35% average reduction in vocal cord stiffness and a 70% mean reduction in high frequency<br>
vocal fold viscosity, thus illustrating the significance of HA in these tissues.<br>
Need for a Synthetic Material<br>
[0151] Vocal Cord Repair - Defects in the vocal cords have a dramatic effect on vocal<br>
production. Arising either de novo, or resulting from surgical intervention, heterogeneous<br>
masses within the vocal cords disrupt the finely coordinated vibrations responsible for high<br>
quality speech production. Patients with de novo lesions usually present early in the disease<br>
course, due to persistent hoarseness. When presenting with an early stage malignant process<br>
(T1-T2 in the Tumor, Node, Metastasis staging system), patients undergo rapid treatment<br>
consisting of either external beam radiation therapy or endoscopic surgery. Such patients are<br>
counseled that poor post-treatment voice quality is an expected side effect of effective tumor<br>
eradication. When presenting with a presumed benign process, patients are faced with a<br>
conundrum, for the surgical treatment often produces speech quality as poor as that caused by<br>
the lesion itself. Unfortunately, current standard laryngeal operative technique cannot<br>
provide for effective removal of either benign or malignant lesions without causing poor<br><br>
vocal outcomes secondary to vocal fold scarring. This is due to the mechanism of wound<br>
healing in the unique anatomy of the larynx. The superficial, vibratory surfaces of the vocal<br>
cords become tethered to the deeper layers by the post-treatment scar, preventing physiologic<br>
phonatory oscillation.<br>
[0152] HA in the human glottis is concentrated in the lamina propria, a histological<br>
layer separating the vocalis muscle from the overlying epithelium. The lamina propria allows<br>
the epithelium to vibrate over the taut vocalis muscle, like waves propagating over a pond.<br>
This "mucosal wave" is the sine qua non of effective speech production. In the presence of<br>
benign or malignant lesions of the vocal cords, the mucosal wave is disrupted. Even in the<br>
normal process of healing, scar bands and disorganized collagen "tether" the superficial<br>
mucosa to the deeper layers of the vocal cords, disrupting the normal mucosal wave and<br>
impairing vocal production. The shock absorbing nature of HA allows it to act as a tissue<br>
damper, protecting the mucosal surfaces from the oscillatory trauma experienced during<br>
phonation. HA also appears to facilitate wound repair by minimizing fibrosis and scarring,<br>
thereby protecting the vocal cord from the permanent damage resulting from trauma.<br>
[0153] The development of a technique, permitting the restoration of a fully vibratory<br>
phonatory surface on vocal cords undergoing laser or cold surgical treatment, would enable a<br>
large population of patients with both benign and malignant processes to undergo treatment<br>
of their tumors with the expectation of unprecedented post-operative speech outcomes.<br>
[0154] Vocal Cord Augmentation - A variety of disorders and diseases adversely<br>
affect glottic function, vocal quality and the ability to communicate. Approximately 7<br>
million people in the United States suffer from dysphonia or voice impairment, and those<br>
affected by vocal cord paresis/paralysis are a significant subset of this population. It is<br>
estimated that 1-4% of all cardiac and thyroid surgeries in the United States result in vocal<br>
cord paresis or complete paralysis due to inadvertent vagus nerve or recurrent laryngeal nerve<br>
injury during surgery.<br>
[0155] Another condition affecting vocal cord function is unilateral vocal fold<br>
paralysis (UVP). In UVP the problem is malposition of an insensate vocal cord. While<br>
medialization results immediately following nerve injury due to opposing tensions of the<br>
laryngeal adductors and abductors, the paralyzed vocal cord rapidly lateralizes to a<br>
paramedian position. The arytenoid cartilage prolapses into the larynx following recurrent<br>
laryngeal nerve injury, resulting in a change in vertical height of the vocal cord, as well as<br><br>
decreased dynamic tension often resulting in vocal fold bowing. Atrophy with resultant<br>
shortening and bowing of the vocal cord occurs later as the thyroarytenoid muscle atrophies<br>
due to a lack of neural stimulation. As a result of atrophy and lateralization, the contralateral<br>
vocal cord cannot fully contact the paralyzed cord, leading to manifestations of UVP.<br>
[0156] Such manifestations include breathy hoarseness, a weak cough, an inability to<br>
valsalva (protect the airway), and difficulty swallowing; complications include aspiration<br>
(solids and liquids) and recurrent pneumonia. This can result in a life-threatening condition<br>
due to increased incidence of recurrent pulmonary infections.<br>
[0157] As only one functional vocal cord is required for normal voice production,<br>
successful treatment consists of "medialization" of the paralyzed vocal fold, thereby enabling<br>
it to contact the contralateral mobile vocal fold. This normalizes voice production and<br>
prevents aspiration minimizing the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Vocal fold paralysis is<br>
currently treated in two ways: open trans-cervical approaches or trans-oral endoscopic vocal<br>
cord injection, also known as injection laryngoplasty therapy (ILT). Ishiki-type I thyroplasty<br>
is the most commonly performed trans-cervical approach, where a "window" is created in the<br>
thyroid cartilage to allow placement of a silastic implant into the body of the atrophic,<br>
paralyzed vocal fold, in effect pushing it into a more medial position. This procedure has a<br>
permanent effect, although complications include implant migration, extrusion, or infection.<br>
[0158] In ILT, the paralyzed vocal cord is medialized by the endoscopic injection of<br>
an exogenous substance. A wide variety of synthetic and biologic materials are currently<br>
available as an injectant for treatment of UVP, including: gelfoam, hydroxyapatite,<br>
autologous fat or facia, acellular cadaveric dermis (Cymetra®), collagen or<br>
Teflon®/Gortex®. Unfortunately, all have proven to be less than ideal with none fulfilling<br>
all desired criteria for the ideal material for long-term vocal cord augmentation. Such<br>
limitations create the need for either re-injection or over-injection to account for the projected<br>
loss of volume.<br>
[0159] A biocompatible, injectable material such as a T-HA hydrogel as disclosed<br>
herein can be designed to mimic the Theological properties of the natural vocal cord tissue<br>
and persist indefinitely in vivo without migration. The design, chemistry, and material<br>
properties of a T-HA hydrogel as described herein can be tuned to produce an injectable<br><br>
bioimplant that is uniquely suited to otolaryngology treatments such as ILT through judicious<br>
selection of component concentrations and cross-linking methodologies as described<br>
hereinabove.<br>
[0160] A suitable biocompatible, high-longevity synthetic material also is desirable to<br>
treat pre-existing sulcus or scarring that can develop due to trauma or develop spontaneously<br>
with aging. Such a material also could be used advantageously in place of saline as a<br>
diagnostic and surgical aid prior to vocal cord surgery. Conventionally, saline is injected<br>
within the HA matrix of the vocal cord lamina propria between a lesion to be surgically<br>
removed and the underlying ligament. This is done to: a) determine if t: lesion involves the<br>
underlying ligament; and b) to make the surgery easier by increasing the distance between the<br>
lesion and the ligament (cold instruments), or providing a heat sink (laser). Ligament<br>
involvement complicates the surgery with penetration of the ligament to be avoided if<br>
possible. This procedure could benefit from the incorporation of hepatocyte growth factors in<br>
the hydrogel, which is used to increase HA production in the lamina propria J decrease<br>
collagen production associated with scarring.<br>
Experimental Description<br>
Design of Extracellular Matrix Material having Desired Properties<br>
[0161] An ideal synthetic matrix or biomaterial for vocal cord augmentation will have<br>
the following characteristics: 1) biocompatible, so there is no unfavorable immunologic<br>
response; 2) easily injectable to allow a surgeon to control the exact amount and location of<br>
injection through a small needle; 3) readily available with minimal preparation for optimal<br>
time efficiency arid potential application to the outpatient office setting; 4) possess the same<br>
or similar biomechanical properties to the vocal fold component being augmented to cause<br>
minimal alteration in the natural function of the augmented structure; 5) resistant to<br>
resorption or migration, so that the initial augmentation result is maintained; and 6) easily<br>
removable in the event of revision surgery.<br>
[0162] The T-HA hydrogels disclosed herein meet all six of these criteria, most<br>
important being that its biomechanical properties can be tuned through judicious selection of<br>
reactant/synthesis parameters and GAG (e.g. HA) concentration to produce the necessary<br>
macromolecular network for producing a hydrogel having desired viscoelastic and<br>
biomechanical properties. Specifically, results of both in vitro and in vivo preliminary studies<br><br>
have allowed favorable comparisons to be drawn against the above criteria. First,<br>
transplantation of T-HA hydrogels into various animal species including rat, rabbit, dog and<br>
pig all have demonstrated little to no host immune response. Second, uncross-linked T-HA<br>
hydrogels at the concentrations required for vocal cord augmentation at the lamina propria or<br>
muscle level easily pass through a 21 gauge needle. Third, medical-grade HA is readily<br>
available and has been used for years in FDA-approved formulations such as Healon and<br>
Restylane. Furthermore, uncross-linked T-HA hydrogel and hydrogen peroxide (cross-<br>
linking agent) solutions can be readily pre-made, in off-the-shelf formulations that require no<br>
preparation by the surgeon. Fourth, the T-HA hydrogels disclosed herein can be formulated<br>
to match the mechanical properties of the various tissues of the glottis including the lamina<br>
propria, thyroarytenoid muscle, and thyroid or arytenoid cartilages. Fifth, the unique cross-<br>
links and non-protein nature of the T-HA hydrogels have demonstrated resistance to<br>
resorption in in vivo experiments. This implies that the initial augmentation result will be<br>
maintained. Finally, formation of a solid continuous implant through the novel in situ cross-<br>
linking protocol made possible through the non-immunogenic enzyme-driven cross-linking<br>
architecture described herein should prevent migration and allow for easy location and<br>
removal of the hydrogel implant should revision surgery be required.<br>
[0163] With respect to the fourth point above, the results from confined compression<br>
testing of T-HA hydrogels (see Example 3 above) provided an initial basis for the synthesis<br>
of an appropriate synthetic T-HA material having properties matched to those of normal<br>
vocal cord tissue. Based on those data, a T-HA hydrogel composed of, inter alia a<br>
macromolecular network of dityramine cross-linked hyaluronan molecules was selected<br>
based on the following criteria in order to produce a synthetic implantable vocal cord repair<br>
or augmentation material.<br>
[0164] Choices of scaffold material (HA alone), percent tyramine substitution (-5%),<br>
protocol for tyramine substitution of HA (modified from Example 1), and the non-<br>
incorporation of cells and bioactive factors were as described in Example 6. A concentration<br>
range of between 2.5 and 10 mg/ml of T-HA hydrogel in sterile saline most closely matched<br>
the Theological and vibratory properties of the vocal cord lamina propria. The 2.5 mg/ml<br>
concentration of T-HA hydrogel was deemed most appropriate based on the extensive clinical<br>
experience of our clinician collaborators with both the vocal cord tissue and other injectable<br>
materials used for vocal cord repair and augmentation. In vitro cross-linked hydrogel was<br><br>
used rather than an in situ cross-linkm? protocol based on the experience of our clinician<br>
collaborators with other injectable materials for vocal cord repair and augmentation. In vitro<br>
cross-linking was as described in Example 1. Based on the results of the rabbit and canine<br>
experiments described below a preferred embodiment for vocal cord augmentation using the<br>
disclosed hydrogel material as envisioned by the inventors would use the in situ cross-linking<br>
protocol and a T-HA concentration to more closely match injection into the deeper muscle<br>
layers of the vocal cord.<br>
Surgical Procedure<br>
[0165] Pre-Operative — After arrival in the biological resource unit, mongrel dogs or<br>
New Zealand white rabbits (depending on the experiment, described below) were maintained<br>
for 7 days for full acclimatization. After pre-medication and general anesthesia per IACUC-<br>
approved protocols, each animal was intubated and maintained in stage III surgical<br>
anesthesia. The animal was positioned supine. After grasping and superiorly retracting the<br>
tongue, a Dedo laryngoscope was placed transorally providing good exposure of the larynx.<br>
The tip of the laryngoscope was positioned several centimeters proximal to the superior<br>
surface of the true vocal cords. The laryngoscope was then suspended. A rigid<br>
videostroboscopic telescope was positioned above the true vocal cords, permitting complete<br>
inspection and imaging of the larynx.<br>
[0166] Vocal Cord Repair -For vocal cord repair, lateral-based micro flaps were<br>
raised in both vocal cords of dogs, and then soft tissue defects were created equivalent to<br>
50% of the vocal cord mass, including lamina propria and underlying muscle. One side<br>
underwent soft tissue reconstruction (filling) with the T-HA hydrogel, while the contralateral<br>
side served as an unrepaired (unfilled) control. The microflap was then redraped over the<br>
hydrogel such that the epithelium was completely continuous. This study used 2.5 mg/ml ex<br>
vivo cross-linked T-HA hydrogel in saline (5% tyramine substituted) prepared as described<br>
above to approximate the rheological properties of the lamina propria. After surgery, the<br>
dogs were weaned from the anesthesia and transferred to the recovery room. The animals<br>
received analgesia for 1 to 2 days per IACUC-approved protocols.<br>
[0167] Injection Laryngoplasty Therapy (Vocal Cord Augmentation) - After<br>
anesthesia, a 27 gauge laryngeal needle was used to inject approximately 0.25 ml of 2.5<br>
mg/ml ex vivo cross-linked T-HA hydrogel in saline (5% tyramine substituted) at the left<br><br>
anterior and posterior membranous vocal cord of rabbits. The injections were made in the<br>
superficial layer of the lamina propria.<br>
[0168] Based on the results from the above experiments with dogs (vocal cord repair)<br>
and rabbits (ILT), the following preferred embodiment for vocal cord augmentation using the<br>
disclosed hydrogel material is envisioned by the inventors. For ILT, the lateralized and<br>
atrophied vocal cord are injected with 50 mg/ml of the uncross-linked T-HA hydrogel in<br>
saline (5% tyramine substituted) with peroxidase at the level of the thyroarytenoid muscle.<br>
Preferably one bolus of hydrogel would be used to obtain the desired medialization, but no<br>
more than two. A 21 gauge laryngeal needle is used to inject the hydrogel. Cross-linking<br>
would be initiated by injection of a small volume of dilute hydrogen peroxide through a 27<br>
gauge needle into the center of the implanted bolus of hydrogel using the 21 gauge needle,<br>
which would not have been withdrawn, for purpose of orientation. Cross-linking of the<br>
hydrogel into a solid implant would be achieved within minutes and verified by feel. After<br>
surgery, the animals would be weaned from the anesthesia and transferred to the recovery<br>
room. The animals would receive analgesia for 1 to 2 days per IACUC-approved protocols.<br>
At the time of euthanasia, the vocal cords of each animal would be carefully dissected,<br>
macroscopically evaluated and photo documented.<br>
Post-Implantation Data<br>
[0169] Vocal Cord Repair - At the time of euthanasia, the vocal cords of the dogs<br>
were carefully dissected, macroscopically evaluated and photo documented. The degree of<br>
wound healing was assessed histologically by a consulting pathologist with specific attention<br>
paid to inflammatory infiltrates, HA staining (normal matrix production), hydrogel staining<br>
and collagen staining (scarring). Fig. 8 shows representative histological results of control<br>
side (unfilled) and experimental side (T-HA hydrogel filled) vocal cords stained with alcian<br>
blue for one of the dogs three months following surgery. Gross observation indicated a more<br>
normal appearance and vibratory properties for the T-HA hydrogel-treated vocal cord<br>
compared to untreated controls. The histological results indicated significant scarring in the<br>
untreated control vocal cord along the wound track as indicated by a lack of deposition of<br>
GAG (i.e., HA) and increased collagen deposition when compared to the T-HA-filled wound<br>
track of the experimentally repaired vocal cord.<br><br>
[0170] Only small foci of T-HA hydrogel could be found in the experimental vocal<br>
cord at 12 weeks, which show a minimal foreign body response with a layer of surrounding<br>
mast cells observed. This may indicate degradation of the T-HA hydrogel with concomitant<br>
deposition of normal HA-containing tissue matrix. However, given the low concentration<br>
(2.5 mg/ml) and thus the very fluid nature of the hydrogel used in this study, it is more likely<br>
that much of the hydrogel was lost from the wound site prior to closure of the site as the<br>
epithelial microflap knitted to the opposed underlying tissue. Hydrogel between the<br>
microflap and opposed underlying tissue is actually predicted to inhibit the knitting process<br>
contributing to hydrogel loss from the wound site. Thus, the positive wound healing effect<br>
seen is believed due to only a thin layer of hydrogel retained at the wound site rather than the<br>
volume-filling bolus of hydrogel initially implanted. These results indicate the ability of the<br>
hydrogel to prevent scarring and match the rheologic properties of the lamina propria.<br>
[0171] Injection Laryngoplasty Therapy (Vocal Cord Augmentation) - At the time of<br>
euthanasia, the vocal cords of the rabbits were carefully dissected, macroscopically evaluated<br>
and photo documented. Histological evaluation by a consulting pathologist was used to<br>
assess the inflammatory response and retention of the hydrogel. Representative histological<br>
results with Alcian Blue staining to detect the hydrogel and hematoxylin &amp; eosin (H&amp;E) for<br>
general morphology are shown in Fig. 9 for one of the rabbits that underwent the<br>
augmentation procedure at two weeks post-operatively. As seen in the figure, pockets of T-<br>
HA hydrogel could be found in the injected vocal cords at 2 weeks, which show a minimal<br>
foreign body response with a layer of surrounding mast cells observed.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
[0172] An experiment was conducted whereby a T-HA hydrogel as described<br>
hereinabove was implanted into a rabbit model in order to fill the vitreous cavity of the eye in<br>
order to prevent or treat vitreo-retinal diseases such as retinal detachment. Following is a<br>
description of that experiment, including the experimental methods and results obtained, after<br>
a brief discussion of the background for this application.<br>
Background<br>
Tissue Description and the Need for a Synthetic Material<br>
[0173] Vitreo-retinal diseases, such as retinal detachment, diabetic retinopathy and<br>
others, are among the most common causes of blindness. The vitreous cavity of the eye<br><br>
normally is filled with a gel like substance. In retinal detachment surgery, the vitreous is<br>
surgically removed (a procedure called "vitrectomy"), the retina is re-attached against the<br>
back wall of the eye, and a replacement substance is injected into the vitreous cavity.<br>
Vitreous substitutes are used for a number of different purposes in the vitreous cavity of the<br>
eye. These include (1) achieving a long term tamponade after retinal re-attachment surgery to<br>
keep the retina apposed to the wall of the eye; (2) in intra-operative procedures such as<br>
unfolding of retinal tears, the removal of subretinal fluid and the flotation and removal of<br>
dislocated intraocular lens components; (3) for developing a sustained release system that<br>
could maintain therapeutic drug levels in the posterior segment of the eye over long periods<br>
of time.<br>
[0174] A number of different compounds are used as vitreous substitutes after retinal<br>
re-attachment surgery. These compounds have physical properties that permit successful<br>
retinal re-attachment but fail in other important surgical goals. Gases injected into the eye<br>
provide short term retinal tamponade but re-absorb quickly and cause significant optical<br>
distortion while they are in the eye. Perfluorocarbon liquids are effective intra-operative<br>
tools for flattening the detached retina but cause unacceptable toxicity when left in the eye for<br>
prolonged periods of time. Silicon oil is used as a medium term retinal tamponade but also<br>
carries a risk of toxicity and causes significant optical distortion.<br>
[0175] Alternatively, substitute vitreous compounds are desirable for use as safe, long<br>
term or time-released drug delivery vehicles in the eye. Many chronic inflammatory and<br>
infectious conditions of the eye, such as sarcoidosis, idiopathic posterior uveitis and<br>
cytomegalovirus retinitis, necessitate intraocular injections of medication. Repeat intra-<br>
ocular injections pose risks such as bleeding, retinal detachment and infection. A stable, non-<br>
toxic vehicle is needed for sustained intravitreal drug delivery.<br>
[0176] Hyaluronan (HA) is an acellular substance that is an essential component of<br>
natural vitreous in humans and other mammals. Formulations of hyaluronan are already in<br>
use in some ophthalmic surgical procedures. For example, sodium hyaluronate is the most<br>
commonly used viscoelastic surgical device for anterior segment and cataract surgery.<br>
Unfortunately, sodium hyaluronate and other previously tested hyaluronan substitutes are<br>
dissolved relatively quickly in human tissues. These substances have not proven effective in<br>
vitreous surgery because of their failure to provide long-term retinal tamponade.<br><br>
Experimental Description<br>
Design of Extracellular Matrix Material having Desired Properties<br>
[0177] The most common need for a vitreous replacement is during retinal<br>
detachment surgery. A significant challenge is maintaining the retina flat against the wall of<br>
the eye for a prolonged period of time post-operatively. An ideal vitreous substitute should<br>
be optically clear to allow maximum visual rehabilitation during the recovery period.<br>
Finally, retinal detachments that occur inferiorly in the eye pose a particular challenge. For<br>
the retina to remain flat post-operatively, the vitreous replacement must be directly apposed<br>
to the area of the retinal tear. To tamponade inferior breaks the patient must often lie in a<br>
face down position for weeks after the surgery. None of the vitreous substitutes in use today<br>
satisfy all of the current clinical needs.<br>
[0178] There is a need for a non-toxic, optically clear, vitreous substitute that will<br>
result in improved surgical results and post-operative visual rehabilitation in patients<br>
undergoing retinal detachment surgery.<br>
[0179] Hydrogels made from a tyramine-substituted and cross-linked hyaluronan (T-<br>
HA) macromolecular network as disclosed herein present an ideal choice for a synthetic<br>
vitreous material. Specifically, the novel enzyme-driven cross-linking chemistry described<br>
above for cross-linking the tyramine-substituted hyaluronan macromolecules using a<br>
peroxidase and H2O2 allows the resulting hydrogels to be cross-linked ex vivo, and to remain<br>
stable in animal tissues. For example, studies in rats have demonstrated that this material<br>
does not degrade over several months when injected subcutaneously (see Example 9). At low<br>
concentrations the hydrogels are optically clear, easily injected through a syringe or a<br>
vitrectomy port and have a specific gravity higher than water. These physical properties<br>
make T-HA gels an ideal substrate for vitreous replacement.<br>
[0180] Based in part on confined compression testing data reported in Example 3<br>
above, it was possible to design a T-HA hydrogel composed of, inter alia a macromolecular<br>
network of dityramine cross-linked hyaluronan molecules, having elastic and other physical<br>
properties matched to natural vitreous material in order to produce a synthetic implantable<br>
vitreous substitute.<br><br>
[0181] Choices of scaffold material (HA alone), percent tyramine substitution (-5%),<br>
protocol for tyramine substitution of HA (modified from Example 1), and exclusion of cells<br>
and bioactive factors were as described in Example 6. A concentration range of between 2.5<br>
and 10 mg/ml of T-HA hydrogel in sterile saline most closely matched the rheologic, optical<br>
(clarity, refractive index) and gravimetric (density) properties of the vitreous of the eye. The<br>
10 mg/ml concentration of T-HA hydrogel was deemed most appropriate based on the<br>
extensive clinical experience of our clinician collaborators. In vitro cross-linked hydrogel<br>
was used rather than an in situ cross-linking protocol based on the experience of our clinician<br>
collaborators with the potential sensitivity of the thin, highly-specialized layer of cells in the<br>
retina. In vitro cross-linking was as described in Example 1. An insoluble steroid was added<br>
to the cross-linked T-HA to allow visualization by the surgeons during the operative<br>
procedure because the hydrogel material itself was optically transparent and colorless.<br>
Surgical Procedure<br>
[0182] Rabbits underwent unilateral vitrectomy surgery (left eye only) using standard<br>
vitreoretinal surgical techniques with replacement of the natural vitreous of the eye with the<br>
T-HA hydrogel described above in order to evaluate the hydrogel material as a vitreous<br>
substitute. Following general anesthesia (ketamine: 50 mg/kg; xylazine: 5 mg/kg), the rabbit<br>
was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. The left eye was dilated with mydriacyl and<br>
phenylephrine. Two drops of topical Ciloxan was instilled over the eye before and after the<br>
case. Topical proparacaine drops were instilled. Under an operating microscope, a 270°<br>
conjunctival peritomy was performed using wescott scissors. An infusion port was created<br>
2.5 mm posterior to the limbus and the infusion cannula was secured to the sclera using 7-0<br>
vicryl suture. A lens ring was sutured to the sclera using 7-0 vicryl suture. A 30° prism<br>
vitrectomy lens was placed on the lens ring. A second port was created and the vitrectomy<br>
instrument was inserted into the vitreous cavity. A complete core and peripheral vitrectomy<br>
was performed. At this point one of the ports was sutured closed with a 7-0 vicryl suture.<br>
The BSS bottle was lowered to patient level and -1.2 cc of a mixture of 3 mg/ml preservative<br>
free triamcinolone acetonide (steroid) and the T-HA hydrogel (10 mg/ml, 5% tyramine<br>
substitution) in BSS was injected into the vitreous cavity through an 18 gauge syringe. The<br>
steroid is the same as usually administered after vitreoretinal surgery with its milky<br>
appearance allowing visualization of the otherwise optically transparent hydrogel material.<br>
As the milky solution was injected it was directly visualized filling the vitreous cavity. The<br>
infusion was stopped when at 50% fill or when the T-HA material was seen backing up<br><br>
through the irrigation canula (100% fill). After filling the vitreous cavity 7-0 vicryl suture<br>
was used to close the remaining ports. 8-0 vicryl suture was used to close the conjunctiva.<br>
Topical bacitracin ointment was placed on the eye after closing. A topical<br>
antibiotic/bacitracin ointment was applied to the eye bid x 1 week, and the rabbit was placed<br>
in a recovery cage. After the rabbit had regained sternal recumbancy, it was returned to its<br>
home cage.<br>
Post-Implantation Data<br>
[0183] At 1 month post-implantation, rabbits were anesthetized with ketamine (50<br>
mg/kg; 10 mg/kg/hr thereafter) and xylazine (5 mg/kg; 0.5 mg/kg/hr thereafter), the pupils<br>
dilated with eye drops (1% tropicamide; 2.5% phenylephrine), and the corneal surface<br>
anesthetized with an eye drop (0.5% proparacaine). After full pupil dilation, the status of the<br>
retina and eye were examined by indirect ophthalmoscopy followed by fundus photography.<br>
In addition, intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured using a Tonopen, a device that is used<br>
clinically and which makes minimal contact with the corneal surface. FinaUy, the rabbit was<br>
placed on a heating pad in darkness for 1 hour, and electroretinograms (ERus) recorded for<br>
both control and vitreous replaced eyes in response to flashes of light. ERG electrodes<br>
consist of a corneal contact lens and two platinum 0.5 inch Grass needle electrodes, placed in<br>
the cheek and trunk. While still under anesthesia, the rabbit was euthanized by using an<br>
intravenous dose of Beuthanasia D Special (1 ml/5 kg). Both control and vitreous replaced<br>
eyes were then enucleated and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 24 hours, for histological<br>
evaluation.<br>
[0184] The results at 1 month post-implantation, indicated minimal post-operative<br>
inflammation of the surgically treated eye with normal IOP. By one week, a cataract had<br>
formed in the vitreous replaced eye relative to the un-operated eye and to BSS control<br>
operated eyes creating a limited view of the posterior segment of the experimental eye. Gross<br>
observation of the sectioned eyes showed the cataract in the anterior segment of the vitreous<br>
replaced eye (Fig. 10). The remainder of the anterior segment as well as the entire posterior<br>
segment of the eye looked similar by gross observation (Fig. 10). Hydrogel was recovered<br>
from the experimental eye at 1 month post-implantation, and was a clear gel-like substance<br>
similar to its pre-injection form (Fig. 10). The ERG for the vitreous replaced eye was normal<br>
compared to the un-operated control eye, and indicated that the retinal cells were alive and<br>
remained functional (Fig. 11). Finally electron micrographs from the four quadrants of the<br><br>
retina show normal morphology for the retina from the vitreous replaced eye compared to the<br>
normal un-operated eye (Fig. 12). These data indicate the T-HA hydrogel can be used as a<br>
vitreous substitute without causing infection or inflammation of the eye, and without<br>
damaging the retina, and illustrate a method by which the T-HA hydrogel can be used as a<br>
retinal tamponade for reattachment of a detached retina.<br>
Related Ophthalmologic Applications<br>
[0185] In addition to the foregoing retinal tamponade application following retinal<br>
reattachment surgery, the T-HA hydrogel described in this example also could be used for the<br>
following related applications:<br>
" as a vitreous replacement for intra-operative procedures such as unfolding of<br>
retinal tears, the removal of subretinal fluid and floatation and removal of<br>
dislocated intraocular lens components.<br>
■	as a vitreous replacement incorporating a sustained release drug delivery system<br>
to maintain therapeutic drug levels (steroids, antibiotics, anti-viral drugs, etc.) in<br>
the posterior segment of the eye over long periods of time to treat chronic<br>
inflammatory and infectious conditions of the eye such as sarcoidosis, idiopathic<br>
posterior uveitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis.<br>
■	for anterior segment surgery including as a substitute for plastic polymer inserts in<br>
corneal refractive surgery. These inserts, implanted surgically in the cornea, are<br>
used to change the shape of the cornea and correct mild myopia. The optical<br>
clarity and biocompatibility of the T-HA hydrogel with human tissues make it<br>
well suited to this application.<br>
" as a substitute for partial or full thickness corneal grafting procedures, e.g. for<br>
anterior segment surgery, necessitated as a result of corneal scarring from<br>
infection, keratoconus, or other causes. The optical and physical properties of the<br>
hydrogels make them compatible with use as corneal tissue substitutes.<br>
■	as a viscoelastic device during anterior segment and cataract surgery. At low<br>
concentrations, hydrogels can maintain anterior chamber shape and pressure while<br>
allowing the surgeon to clearly visualize ocular structures.<br>
■	for oculoplastic surgery including subcutaneous injection to smooth wrinkles in<br>
the face.<br>
■	for oculoplastic surgery as an ocular implant in patients undergoing enucleation or<br>
exoneration surgery. The hydrogel formed in the dimensions of a human eye can<br><br>
be used as an implant to fill the orbit and improve cosmetic appearance of the<br>
individual after globe removal.<br>
■	to coat MEMS devices for use in vitreo-retinal surgery.<br>
• to expand the utility of laser vision correction surgery (LASIK) to include those<br>
cases where volume needs to be added to the cornea rather than removed to<br>
correct vision. Corrective laser surgery would be used to produce the exact<br>
dimensions required for optimal visual outcome following implantation of an<br>
intentionally oversized plug of the hydrogel.<br>
■	as a replacement for the typical gases, perfluorocarbon liquids and silicon oils<br>
normally used as tamponades in eye surgery. These applications include but are<br>
not limited to the following: giant retinal tears, proliferative vitreoretinopathy<br>
(PVR), large breaks with "fish-mouth" phenomenon, posterior breaks or macular<br>
holes, the restoration of intraocular volume after drainage of subretinal fluid, total<br>
retinal detachment with multiple breaks and large meridional folds, retinal<br>
detachment caused by ocular trauma or complicated by PVR or associated with<br>
choroidal coloboma, dislocated lenses, suprachoroidal and submacular<br>
hemorrhage, rhegmatogenous retinal detachments without PVR, severe<br>
proliferative diabetic retinopathy, chronic uveitis with profound hypotony, and<br>
infectious retinitis.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
[0186] An experiment was conducted whereby plugs of T-HA hydrogels as described<br>
hereinabove were implanted subcutaneously into immunocompetent rats in order to<br>
investigate and demonstrate their in vivo persistence and longevity as well as to measure any<br>
host immune response. As described in detail above, hydrogels comprising a cross-linked<br>
macromolecular network (such as a tyramine-substituted and cross-linked hyaluronan<br>
network) can be prepared having a range of physical and viscoelastic properties. These<br>
materials, for example, can be tuned to emulate natural soft tissue and could be used for<br>
repair or augmentation of soft tissue defects, as in plastic surgery or reconstructive surgery.<br>
In particular, as described in detail in Examples 3 and 4 above, the viscoelasticity, rigidity<br>
and other physical properties of the material can be tuned across a wide range to emulate like<br>
properties of a wide variety of native soft tissues, and the material can be cast or formed into<br>
a variety of complex anatomical shapes which would make it ideal for casting replacement or<br>
reconstructed tissue components; e.g., in the shape of an ear or of a nose for facial<br><br>
reconstruction.<br>
[0187] While it already was clear from the noted examples that these materials could<br>
be cast into appropriate shapes and could be given appropriate physical properties, the present<br>
experiment demonstrates the feasibility of using the T-HA hydrogels as synthetic tissue<br>
matrix or replacement materials in vivo. Following is a description of the experiment,<br>
including the experimental methods and results obtained, after a brief discussion of the<br>
background for this application.<br>
Background<br>
Tissue Description and the Need for a Synthetic Material<br>
[0188] The availability of biomaterials for soft tissue augmentation and head and<br>
neck reconstruction has remained a fundamental challenge in the field of plastic and<br>
reconstructive surgery. Significant research and investment has been undertaken for the<br>
development of a material with appropriate biological compatibility and life span. The<br>
present focus in tissue engineering has been directed at attempts toward fibroblast and<br>
chondrocyte cultures as a method of creating endogenous cartilage and collagen bearing<br>
structures useful for implantation. The archetypal standard of this avenue of research has<br>
been the nude mouse with a neo-cartilage ear on its back. This is based on the concept of<br>
chondrocyte culture on a poly-lactic or poly-glycolic acid framework. The presumption is<br>
that the chondrocytes can produce the extracellular matrix (ECM) for the production of<br>
cartilage and create a new functional biological filling agent with complete compatibility.<br>
The outcomes of this research have not been promising in regards to their clinical application.<br>
When placed in immunocompetent animals the structural integrity of the neo-cartilage has<br>
been shown to fail as the framework is absorbed. Fundamentally, while chondrocytes can<br>
successfully be cultured and propagated they apparently cannot be made to produce cartilage<br>
on a framework prior to its hydrolysis by the host defense mechanisms.<br>
[0189] Conventionally, clinicians have been limited by the use of xenogenic materials<br>
such as bovine collagen and unmodified hyaluronan (HA) as well as synthetic materials such<br>
as silicone, silastic and hydroxyapatite. The synthetic materials are prone to foreign body<br>
reactions and infection while the biological substrates are prone to breakdown over time. In<br>
addition, synthetic PTFE (gortex) polymers and silastic offer less tissue reactivity but do not<br>
offer tissue integration and also can represent long term risks of foreign body infections and<br>
extrusion.<br><br>
[0190] Instead of a tissue engineering model where chondrocytes are required to<br>
produce a cartilage ECM, the hydrogels disclosed herein are or can be based on the same<br>
materials that provide cartilage its functionality and feel (HA). In the present invention,<br>
hyaluronan is used directly as the substrate for the creation of a stable tissue engineered<br>
material to replace natural HA-rich soft tissues. In essence, the HA-based hydrogels used in<br>
herein incorporate the same material that gives cartilage its form and structural<br>
characteristics, but it is modified (tyramine-substituted and cross-linked) to make the material<br>
resistant to biological degradation. Thus, an ideal synthetic extracellular matrix material<br>
suitable for in vivo implantation and longevity is achieved.<br>
Experimental Description<br>
Design of Extracellular Matrix Material having Desired Properties<br>
[0191] To provide a synthetic soft-tissue and cartilage substitute for use in head and<br>
neck reconstruction based on the disclosed HA materials the following points were<br>
considered: 1) optimization of enzyme-selective cross-linked hydrogels using hyaluronan as<br>
the scaffold material; and 2) application of T-HA hydrogels as cartilage substitutes and soft-<br>
tissue fillers. These include characterization of the effect of the cross-linked hydrogels in<br>
vivo.<br>
[0192] Again, based in part on confined compression testing data reported in Example<br>
3 above, it was possible to design T-HA hydrogels composed of, inter alia a macromolecular<br>
network of dityramine cross-linked hyaluronan molecules, having elastic and other physical<br>
properties matched to natural soft tissues which were suitable for in vivo rat implantation to<br>
determine their immunogenic and longevity characteristics.<br>
[0193] Choices of scaffold material (HA alone), percent tyramine substitution (-5%),<br>
protocol for tyramine substitution of HA (modified from Example 1), and exclusion of cells<br>
and bioactive factors were as described in Example 6. A concentration range of between 6.25<br>
and 100 mg/ml of T-HA hydrogel encompassed the wide spectrum of physical properties<br>
required of a material for facial reconstruction. Therefore the same five concentration used in<br>
Example 3 were deemed appropriate for testing in a subcutaneous rat model based on the<br>
extensive clinical experience of our clinician collaborators. In vitro cross-linked hydrogels<br>
were used so as to produce hydrogels of defined shape for analysis of shape retention, a<br>
property deemed important by our clinician collaborators. In vitro cross-linking was as<br><br>
described in Example 1.	<br>
Surgical Procedure<br>
[0194] T-HA hydro gel plugs of defined shape, mass and volume (7 mm in diameter<br>
and 3 mm in thickness) and defined mechanical properties based on HA concentration were<br>
surgically implanted subcutaneously in the backs of immunocompetent rats to allow<br>
evaluation of their in vivo persistence and host immune response based on previously<br>
published protocols for the evaluation of collagen and other HA-based hydrogels. After<br>
induction of anesthesia with intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine<br>
(5 mg/kg), the rat received a single intramuscular injection of 60,000 units of procaine<br>
penicillin for infection prophylaxis. A 1cm stab incision was made with a #11 surgical blade<br>
in the lower lumbar region of the rat. A 14 g needle was used as a trocar to dissect in the<br>
subcutaneous plane to create a pocket. Three preformed hydrogel plugs (~7.1 mm diameter x<br>
3 mm thick) of one of the HA concentrations to be tested were inserted into the surgical<br>
pocket. A single absorbable stitch (3-0 Chromic) was placed to re-approximate the skin edge.<br>
At 1- week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months post-implantation, rats were sacrificed by CO2<br>
asphyxiation and the T-HA hydrogel plugs with surrounding tissue excised and stored in<br>
formalin at 4°C until time for histological evaluation.<br>
Post-Implantation Data<br>
[0195] Hydrogel compositions tested included plugs made from concentrations of<br>
6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 mg/ml of HA; generating hydrogel plugs with a wide spectrum of<br>
physical properties ranging from that of gel to a paste to a rubber-like material (see Example<br>
3). Implanted T-HA hydrogel plugs were collected at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6<br>
months post-implantation. Excised plugs were evaluated for their in vivo persistence and host<br>
immune response.<br>
[0196] Fig. 13 shows representative results of histological staining with H&amp;E, alcian<br>
blue, MC/giemsa, Movats, Reticular, and Trichrome stains for the 100 mg/ml TB-HA<br>
hydrogel plug from the 1-month time point. Clearly defined in Fig. 13 are the surface hair<br>
follicles, the superficial muscle layer, the hydrogel plug, and the thin fibrous capsule<br>
surrounding the hydrogel plug as a result of a minimal foreign body response. An artifact<br>
exists as a result of hydrogel shrinkage from the paraffin embedding process, which can be<br>
avoided through the use of frozen sections. The results show very little immune response<br>
with only a thin layer of mast cells surrounding the plug, and no evidence for host cell<br><br>
infiltration into the plug. When measured, the volume of the void left by the plug during<br>
histological processing is 3 mm (the original plug thickness) indicating little to no<br>
biodegradation or deformation of the hydrogel matrix. Staining indicated that the plugs had<br>
little protein, such as collagen or elastin, deposited within them and remained primarily<br>
composed of HA hydrogel. These results indicate that the hydrogel plugs over a broad range<br>
of five concentrations persisted through 6 months with little evidence of degradation, host<br>
immune response, and cellular infiltration providing a wide range of injectable materials for<br>
use in soft tissue reconstruction.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
[0197] It will be apparent from the foregoing discussion and the Examples that<br>
hydrogels described herein composed of a cross-linked (in situ or ex vivo) macromolecular<br>
network of hyaluronan molecules cross-linked via a suitable dihydroxyphenyl cross-linking<br>
chemistry as herein described are suitable as a synthetic, implantable extracellular matrix<br>
tissue material for a variety of tissue engineering and repair applications. A particular such<br>
application for which the disclosed hydrogel materials will have particular utility is in the<br>
repair or augmentation of the mitral valve in a heart.<br>
[0198] The mitral valve is one of the most complex connective tissue structures in the<br>
body. It consists of two leaflets and numerous chordae tendineae. These chordae have a<br>
highly aligned collagenous core and a thin outer sheath of elastic fibers and endothelial cells.<br>
Both leaflets are laminated tissues containing a heavily collagenous layer on the ventricular<br>
side, a predominantly elastic layer on the atrial side, and an inner spongiosa layer containing<br>
abundant proteoglycans (PGs) and hyaluronan (HA). The relative thicknesses of these layers<br>
vary between the two leaflets and also within each leaflet from its attachment edge to its free<br>
edge.<br>
[0199] The variability of the different leaflet layers, and hence the structural<br>
constituents within the mitral valve, are determined by the specific functional roles of the<br>
leaflets and chordae. The closed valve maintains a balance of tensile and compressive loads,<br>
in which the chordae and the flat central region of the anterior leaflet are in tension, whereas<br>
the free edge of the anterior leaflet and most of the posterior leaflet are in appositional<br>
compression. Accordingly, the most collagenous components of the mitral apparatus are the<br>
chordae and the portion of the anterior leaflet between the annulus and the upper appositional<br><br>
border. In the posterior leaflet and in the free edge of the anterior leaflet, the collagenenous<br>
layer is relatively thinner, whereas the PG rich spongiosa is substantially thicker. The wide<br>
diversity of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and their parent PGs exert considerable yet variable<br>
control over the physical properties of the extracellular matrix.<br>
[0200] Functional mitral regurgitation (MR) refers to the regurgitation that occurs<br>
with a structurally normal valve as a consequence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, and as<br>
a result, almost half the patients with LV dysfunction have at least moderate MR. Functional<br>
MR plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure (CHF), a major<br>
cause of cardiac morbidity and mortality. Several studies have shown that the presence of<br>
functional MR in patients with CHF is associated with poor outcomes. Although this<br>
observation could suggest that MR is merely an indicator of CHF severity, it is also<br>
increasingly apparent that the development of the MR hastens the progression of CHF. The<br>
precise mechanism of functional MR remains controversial and can relate to mitral annular<br>
dilatation in the septal-lateral (S-L) axis or tethering of the leaflets secondary to progressive<br>
ventricular remodeling. MR leads to greater volume overload of the LV with progressive<br>
annular dilatation and increased MR, creating a "vicious cycle" which exacerbates the<br>
problem. MR is commonly considered to be one of the initiators of CHF, as well as an<br>
ongoing impetus of the progression of the disease.<br>
[0201] Surgical annuloplasty is a widely used method for mitral valve repair and can<br>
provide long-term benefit. However, the surgical procedure requires access to and<br>
manipulation of the valve annulus via atriotomy. In addition, the procedure requires the<br>
patient to be placed on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The prolonged CPB time has been<br>
suggested as a cause of not only postoperative LV dysfunction but also main organ<br>
dysfunction. The use of heparin during CPB results in an increased risk of bleeding<br>
complications. The increased morbidity and mortality profile leads many care providers<br>
directly to non-treatment options of MR in the earlier stage heart failure patients.<br>
[0202] Recently, several minimally invasive methods of mitral valve repair have been<br>
developed. For example, several investigators have reported the preliminary methodology of<br>
off-pump mitral valve repair procedures through a thoracic incision. Others have reported<br>
new devices that can be inserted percutaneously into the coronary sinus and great cardiac<br>
vein to reduce the S-L dimension of the mitral annulus. There are the possibilities of adverse<br><br>
effects, however, such as obstruction or disturbance of the coronary circulation, by chronic<br>
placement of the device in the coronary sinus,<br><br>
[0203] Surgical therapy for functional MR, including mitral valve repair with an<br>
annuloplasty ring and replacement with an artificial valve has been limited in patients with<br>
severe CHF by relatively high operative mortality rates due to the effects of CPB. Therefore,<br>
there is a need for a minimally invasive procedure that will not compromise coronary<br>
circulation and will allow for reduction of the S-L dimension of the mitral annulus to reduce<br>
functional MR as well as other forms of MR. Myxomatous changes in mitral valve tissues<br>
can lead to leaflet prolapse and mitral regurgitation.<br>
[0204] The T-HA hydrogel materials disclosed herein could be adapted for this<br>
purpose; i.e. mitral annular remodeling resulting from a nonabsorbable substance injection<br>
(namely a T-HA hydrogel material designed to have the necessary viscoelastic and other<br>
physical properties) into the posterior mitral annulus using an epicardial approach. This<br>
procedure would enable the S-L dimension to be efficiently reduced, thus reducing MR,<br>
without employing CPB or implanting a device into the coronary sinus. This mitral annular<br>
remodeling procedure could be modified to allow for percutaneously injection of the<br>
substance through the coronary sinus.<br>
[0205] This application for a T-HA hydrogel as disclosed herein would enable a<br>
nonabsorbable substance to be percutaneously injected through the coronary sinus for severe<br>
CHF patients with functional MR who are unable to receive conventional mitral valve<br>
surgery. This minimally invasive approach would obviate the need for CPB and sternotomy,<br>
as well as diminish the risk of major side effects from conventional surgical therapy such as<br>
postoperative LV dysfunction and resulting poor organ perfusion. In addition, such a<br>
procedure would provide patients with mild to moderate CHF with an option for early<br>
restoration of mitral valve competence, arresting the initiation and progression of devastating<br>
heart failure.<br>
[0206] In particular, a hydrogel composed of a cross-linked macromolecular network<br>
as described herein, particularly of HA, could be designed based on the principles as<br>
elucidated in Example 3 above, in order to produce a hydrogel material having all of the<br>
following characteristics which would be considered desirable for this application:<br><br>
■	Injectable and nonabsorbable;<br>
■	Low-grade inflammatory reaction;<br>
■	Low evidence of foreign body migration;<br>
■	Ease of collagen encapsulation which contributes to the prevention of migration;<br>
■	Not especially malleable nor especially rigid.<br>
[0207] A protocol has been established for the injection of a T-HA hydrogel material<br>
to augment the mitral valve of a beating heart. That protocol is described as follows.<br>
[0208] Injection Procedure - Two dimensional epicardial echocardiography (2D EE)<br>
and transesophageal echocardiography (2D TEE) are performed to evaluate LV end-diastolic<br>
and end-systolic volumes (EDV and ESV), stroke volume (SV), ejection fraction (EF), the S-<br>
L dimension of mitral annulus, and the degree of MR. Hemodynamic data such as LVP,<br>
LAP, the central venous pressure (CVP), the pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), the<br>
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), CO, LAD flow, and LCX flow should be<br>
collected. LV end-diastolic and end-systolic pressure-volume relations can be obtained by<br>
transient TVC occlusion using an occlusion catheter to assess LV contractility and compliance<br>
(baseline before injection).<br>
[0209] A commercially available cardiac stabilizer used for ofT-pump coronary<br>
bypass grafting can be used to stabilize the target region. Under 2D TEE guidance, the<br>
uncross-linked T-HA hydrogel composition (50 mg/ml in sterile saline) is injected into the<br>
posterior mitral annulus from the outside of the heart while the heart is beating. During the<br>
injection, 2D can be used to assess the position of the tip of the needle for the injection, the<br>
range occupied by the substance in the posterior annulus. Once an appropriate fill and<br>
repositioning of the mitral valve has been accomplished, cross-linking is initiated by injection<br>
of 0.2 cc of 0.6% hydrogen peroxide. After completion of cross-linking of the hydrogel<br>
implant, data including hemodynamics, coronary flow, LV pressure-volume loops (LV P-V<br>
loops), 2D EE, and 2D TEE should be collected (data after injection).<br>
[0210] The foregoing injection methodology was developed and evaluated using<br>
cadaveric dog and pig hearts as models. Fig. 14 shows a cadaveric dog heart in which a T-<br>
HA hydrogel material was injected and cross-linked in situ via the foregoing injection<br><br>
methodology. To produce the T-HA hydrogel material for this experiment, the scaffold<br>
material (HA alone), percent tyramine substitution (~5%), protocol for tyramine substitution<br>
of HA (modified from Example I) and non-inclusion of cells and bioactive factors were as<br>
described in Example 6. Concentrations of 25, 50 and 100 mg/ml of T-HA hydrogel in saline<br>
most closely matched those of cardiac (heart) tissue required for mitral valve closure. The 50<br>
mg/ml T-HA hydrogel was deemed most appropriate for a mitral annular remodeling<br>
procedure by percutaneously injection based on the extensive clinical experience of our<br>
clinician collaborators. Peroxidase would be added at 10 U/ml prior to application in an in<br>
situ cross-linking protocol as the one described below. The in situ cros linking protocol is<br>
preferred as it would allow the uncross-linked T-HA to pass through an appropriately sized<br>
needle while the cross-linked hydrogel may not. In addition, the in situ cross-linking protocol<br>
allows the surgeon first to properly position (close) the mitral valves by injection of the<br>
uncross-linked hydrogel and then cross-link the hydrogel into a solid implant only after visual<br>
confirmation that the mitral valve had been properly repositioned.<br>
[0211] In Fig. 14, the implanted hydrogel was bisected post-'^Dlantation to<br>
demonstrate its solid, viscoelastic character following in situ cross- ng, as well as to<br>
evaluate its placement in the heart. In particular, these models were used to 1) evaluate the<br>
appropriate concentration of hydrogel required to both mimic the consistency of cardiac<br>
muscle after cross-linking yet pass through the injection port prior to cross-linking; 2)<br>
demonstrate reproducibility for the in vivo cross-linking protocols for complete cross-linking<br>
in vivo at the required volumes (~2 ml); and development suitable injection techniques. All<br>
of these goals were met, establishing confidence that the injection procedure as well as a<br>
suitable T-HA hydrogel can precisely accommodate anatomical constraint on the mitral<br>
annulus.<br>
