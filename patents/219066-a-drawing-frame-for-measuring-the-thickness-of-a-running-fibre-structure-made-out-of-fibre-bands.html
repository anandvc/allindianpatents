				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a device in a drafting frame for measuring the thickness of a<br>
running fibre structure made out of fibre bands. A tape guide is arranged at the inlet of<br>
the drafting unit of the drafting frame for the fibre structure which is composed of side-<br>
by-side inputted fibre bands. The fibre bands are guided in a single plane through a<br>
measuring member which includes movable feeler elements which, in cooperation with a<br>
counterface, forms a throat through which the fibre bands pass after being compressed<br>
thereby. The positional changes of the feeler element in response to thickness fluctuations<br>
of the running fibre structure formed of the fibre bands are converted into electric control<br>
pulses by a converter means.<br>
According to a known device which measures the thickness of a fibre structure and<br>
which includes a tape guide for guiding the fibre structure drafting at the drafting unit<br>
inlet, the walls of the device converge at least partially conically to gather the fibre bands<br>
inputted in one plane. Further, a roll pair is arranged downstream of the tape guide. The<br>
fibre bands again diverge downstream of the roll pair. The thickness measuring device<br>
has a, movable feeler element which forms a throat with a stationary counterface for the<br>
throughgoing fibre structure as outlined above. The thickness of the fibre bands is sensed<br>
as the compressed fibre bands are guided in the tape guide side-by-side, while the roll<br>
pair withdraws the sensed fibre bands.<br>
It has further been proposed to compress the side-by-side arranged fibre bands from<br>
above across the width of the fibre structure. For this purpose the feeler element, in<br>
addition to a sensing and compression movement in the direction of the fibre bands, also<br>
executes a pivotal motion about an axis which is parallel to the running direction of the<br>
fibre bands and thus the feeler element is able to detect that, for example, fibre bands of<br>
unlike thickness are arranged side-by-side. The movable feeler element has a slide face<br>
by means of which the fibre bands are, in their side-by-side relationship, compressed and<br>
pressed against the stationary counterface. Disadvantageously, in such an arrangement<br>
the thickest fibre band determines the distance between the feeler element and the<br>
counterface, and even a small thickened location in one of the fibre bands results in a<br>
greater distance. The fibre bands on either side of such a thickened location are thus<br>
pulled out of the thus-obtained clearance without having been submitted to thickness<br>
sensing.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide an improved device of the above-outlined type<br>
from which the discussed disadvantages are eliminated and which, in particular, ensures a<br>
significantly improved detection of the thickness fluctuations of the fibre bands and<br>
makes possible a more accurate guidance thereof.<br>
This object and others to become apparent as the specification progresses, are<br>
accomplished by the invention, according to which, briefly stated, the device for<br>
measuring the thickness of a plurality of side-by-side running fibre bands includes a<br>
supporting surface guiding the side-by-side running fibre bands thereon in a single plane;<br>
a retaining element; and a plurality of feeler elements movably secured to the retaining<br>
element to be movable in a direction transverse to the plane. Each fibre band is contacted<br>
by a separate feeler element for causing excursions thereof by thickness fluctuations of<br>
the running fibre band. Each feeler element is yieldingly pressed against a respective<br>
fibre band, and each feeler element cooperates with the supporting surface for pressing<br>
the running fibre bands against the supporting surface. A summation device adds the<br>
excursions of the feeler elements, and a converter means converts the excursion values<br>
into electric pulses.<br>
By means of the invention according to which all fibre bands are individually measured<br>
for thickness at the inlet of the drawing frame, a differentiated summation result may be<br>
obtained in which the thickness of each individual fibre band is taken into account. In this<br>
manner the evening of thickness fluctuations of all fibre bands is significantly improved,<br>
eventually resulting in a more uniform drawn fibre band, and thus an improved yam may<br>
be manufactured.<br>
The invention includes the following additional advantageous features:<br>
AH feeler elements are connected with a retaining element which is biased by a force-<br>
exerting member and to which the sum of the displacements of the individual feeler<br>
elements is applied.<br>

feeler elements includes a securing region fixedly connected with the retaining element<br>
and further wherein the feeler elements form a moving means for the rotary of shifting<br>
motion of the biased retaining element and the sensing region is formed by the other end<br>
of the feeler elements.<br>

The retaining element is resistant to torsion forces.<br>
At the end face of the retaining element at least one torsion bar is disposed in an axial<br>
direction.<br>
The retaining element is supported in a rotary bearing at least at one end thereof.<br>

The measuring element is an inductive path sensor.<br>
The measuring element includes expansion strips.<br>
In a device in which the thickness variations are mechanically sensed over the width of<br>
the fibre structure by the individual feeler elements, the thickness deviations are<br>
summarized by the common retaining element by means of forming an average value.<br>
The inputted fiber quantity for the drawing frame is altered as a function of the deviation<br>
of the actual value (average value) from a desired value.<br>
The feeler elements are situated above the rotary roll forming a counter surface.<br>
The leaf springs extend into the bight between two cooperating rolls between which the<br>
fibre bands pass.<br>
The feed roll is stationarily supported.<br>
The retaining element is a hollow extruded member.<br>
The extruded retaining element is of aluminum or an aluminum alloy.<br>
The retaining element is provided at its end faces with a radially extending axle such as a<br>
bar or a pin.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a drawing frame 1 which may be an HSR model manufactured by<br>
Trutzschler GmbH &amp; Co. KG. The drawing frame 1 has a drafting unit 2 flanked<br>
upstream and downstream by a drafting unit inlet 3 and a drafting unit outlet 4,<br>
respectively. The fibre bands 5 are withdrawn from coiler cans and enter a tape guide 6<br>
and are thereafter pulled therethrough by cooperating withdrawing rolls 7, 8 to cause the<br>
fibre bands 5 to run past the measuring member 9. The drafting unit 2 is a four-over-three<br>
drafting unit, that is, it has a lower output roll I, a lower mid roll II and a lower input roll<br>
III as well as four upper rolls 11, 12, 13 and 14. In the drafting unit 2 a drawing<br>
(stretching or drafting) of the fibre structure formed of a plurality of fibre bands 5 takes<br>
place. The drafting unit has preliminary and principal drawing fields. The roll pairs 14/111<br>
and 13/11 constitute the preliminary drawing field while the roll pair 13/11 and the roll unit<br>
11,12/1 form the principal drawing field. At the drafting unit outlet 4 the drawn fibre<br>
bands 5 reach a tape guide 10 and are pulled through a sliver funnel 17 by means of<br>
withdrawing rolls 15, 16 and are combined by the sliver funnel 17 into a fibre band 18<br>
which is subsequently deposited into coiler cans.<br>
The withdrawing rolls 7, 8, the lower intake roll III and the lower mid roll II which are<br>
coupled to one another mechanically, for example, by a toothed belt, are driven by a<br>
variable speed motor 19 with a pre-inputted desired value. The upper rolls 14 and 13 are<br>
driven by friction from the respective lower rolls III and II. The lower output roll I and<br>
the withdrawing rolls 15, 16 are driven by a main motor 20. The variable speed motor 19<br>
and the main motor 20 are provided with a respective regulator 21 and 22. The rpm<br>
regulation is effected by means of a closed regulating circuit in which a tachometer 23 is<br>
coupled with the variable speed motor 19 and a tachometer 24 is coupled with the main<br>
motor 20. At the drafting unit inlet 3 a magnitude of the fibre band which is proportional<br>
to the fibre band mass, such as its cross section, is measured by the inlet measuring<br>
member 9. At the drafting unit outlet 4 the cross section of the exiting fibre band 18 is<br>
determined by a fibre band outlet measuring organ 25 associated with the funnel trumpet<br>
17.<br>
A central computer unit 26 (control-and-regulating device), such as a microcomputer or a<br>
microprocessor transmits to the regulator 21a setting of the desired magnitude for the<br>
variable speed motor 19. The measuring magnitudes of the two measuring members 9<br>
and 25 are applied to the central computer unit 26 during the fibre band drawing process.<br>
The central computer unit 26 determines the desired value for the variable speed motor<br>
19 from the measuring values of the inlet measuring member 9 and from the desired<br>
value for the cross section of the exiting fibre band 18. The measuring values of the outlet<br>
measuring member 25 serve for monitoring the exiting fibre band 18. With the aid of<br>
such a regulating system fluctuations in the cross section of the inputted fibre bands 5<br>
may be compensated for by a suitable regulation of the drawing process and thus an<br>
evening of the outputted fibre band 18 may be achieved.<br>
According to FIGS. 2a and 2b, a plurality of side-by-side arranged feeler elements 30 are<br>
provided which are displaceable in the direction of the arrows B and C perpendicularly to<br>
the plane in which the fibre bands 5 lie. With one end of each feeler element 30 a<br>
respective spring 31 is associated which, at its other end, is secured to a throughgoing<br>
stationary retaining element 32. With each feeler element a converter means, such as an<br>
inductive path sensor is associated which converts the excursions of the feeler elements<br>
30 into electric signals which are applied to a common electric adding device 34. The<br>
summation signal 35 is used for regulation as shown in FIGS. 1 and 3b. A throughgoing<br>
stationary slide element (supporting surface) such as a slide strip faces the other end of<br>
the feeler elements 30. The fibre bands 5 pass between the feeler elements 30 and the<br>
slide element (counterface) 36. Downstream of the measuring device 9 two cooperating<br>
driven rotary transport rolls 37 and 38 are arranged. In this manner, the thickness of all<br>
fibre bands 5 is individually measured at the inlet of the drawing frame, and a summation<br>
signal 35 is formed from the individual measuring signals.<br>
According to FIGS. 3a and 3b, the feeler elements 30 are formed by a plurality of side-<br>
by-side arranged leaf springs (measuring plates) which are affixed at one end to a<br>
common summation retaining element 39 such as a summation beam, a measuring lever<br>
or the like. The other, free end of the leaf springs 30 is pressed against the respective<br>
fibre bands 5. The mechanical summation retaining element 39 is at both ends rotatably<br>
supported in bearings 40, 41 and is biased by a spring 42 in a clockwise direction as<br>
viewed in FIGS. 3a and 3b. Further, with the summation retaining element 39 a sensor 43<br>
is associated which, according to FIG. 3b, applies an electric summation signal to a<br>
regulator 44 connected to a drive motor 45 which rotates a roll 46. The roll 46 which<br>
rotates in the direction F forms a movable counterface (supporting surface) for all the leaf<br>
springs 30. Between the retaining element 39 and the roll 46 a throughgoing feed table 47<br>
is disposed for pivotal motion about a support 48 biased clockwise by a spring 49. The<br>
fibre bands 5 are pulled in between the nip defined by the roll 46 and the feed table 47. At<br>
the output side of the nip the fibre bands 5 are sensed for thickness by the leaf springs 30<br>
which are movable in a direction indicated by the arrows E and D. This embodiment<br>
needs only a single sensor 43 sensing the rotary displacement of the summation element<br>
39.<br>
According to FIG. 4, the roll 46 is associated with a guide roll 50 which rotates in the<br>
direction G and which serves for guiding and advancing the fibre bands 5.<br>
Turning to FIG. 5, the roll 46 is associated with a transporting roll 37. The rolls 37, 46<br>
rotate in the direction of the respective arrows H and I and define a bight, terminating in a<br>
nip through which the fibre bands 5 pass. The leaf springs (sensors) 30 extend into the<br>
bight and press on the fibre bands 5 from above, while the rotating upper face of the roll<br>
46 serves as a counterface (supporting surface).<br>
FIGS. 6a and 6b show an embodiment where the measuring device 9 is integrated in the<br>
tape guide 6 having lateral walls 6a and 6b and a bottom wall 6c. The leaf springs 30<br>
cantilevered to the summation retaining element 39 press down on a respective fibre band<br>
5 with their other, free end. This arrangement makes possible to sense a varying number<br>
of fibre bands, for example, instead of the shown eight fibre bands, only six fibre bands<br>
may be sensed. The lateral walls 6a, 6b cause the fibre bands to laterally converge, that is,<br>
the fibre structure is laterally compressed independently from the number of the fibre<br>
bands 5. With each fibre band 5 a respective feeler element 30 may be associated so that<br>
an individual measuring of the fibre bands 5 is achieved. It is, however, also feasible to<br>
associate a plurality of feeler elements 30 with a single fibre band 5 or to assign a single<br>
feeler element 30 with more than one fibre band 5. The summation retaining element 39<br>
serves in each instance for adding the excursions of the feeler elements 30. In this<br>
manner, a differentiated summation is achieved.<br>
It will be understood that the above description of the present invention is susceptible to<br>
various modification, changes and adaptations, and the same are intended to be<br>

being spaced from said end face of said feed table(47).<br>
18 The drawing frame as claimed in claim 17, comprising a spring (49)<br>
urging said rotary roll (46) and said feed table (47) to one another; said<br>
spring (49) being harder than said leaf springs (30).<br>
19, The drawing frame as claimed in claim 17, comprising means (48) for<br>
movably supporting said feed table (47); said means for movably<br>
supporting said feed table comprising means for preventing<br>
displacements of said feed table in a direction parallel to excursions of<br>
said feeler elements.<br>
The invention relates to a device (2) in a drafting frame<br>
(1) for measuring the thickness of a running fibre structure made<br>
out of fibre bands (5a-5n) comprises a tape guide (6) guiding the<br>
side-by-side running fibre bands thereon on a single plane, a<br>
Measuring member (9), and a plurality of feeler elements (30a-<br>
30n) movably secured to the measuring member (9) to be movable in<br>
a direction transverse to the plane. Each fibre band (5a) is<br>
contacted by a separate feeler element (30a) for causing<br>
excursions thereof by thickness fluctuations of the running fibre<br>
band. Each sensor element (43) is yieldingly pressed against a<br>
respective fibre band, and each feeler element (30a) cooperates<br>
with the tape guide (6) for pressing the running fibre bands (5a)<br>
against a counterface (36). A summation device (39) adds the<br>
excursions of the feeler elements (30a), and a converter means<br>
(26) converts the excursion values into electric pulses.</td>
