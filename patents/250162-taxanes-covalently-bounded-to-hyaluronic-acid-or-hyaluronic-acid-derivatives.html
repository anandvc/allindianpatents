TAXANES     COVALENTLY    BOUNDED     TO     HYALURONIC    ACID     OR<br>
HYALURONIC ACID DERIVATIVES<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to taxanes, in particular paclitaxel and docetaxel,<br>
covalently bounded to hyaluronic acid or hyaluronic acid derivatives, to the<br>
process for their preparation and to their use in the field of oncology, in the<br>
treatment of autoimmune disorders and restenosis.<br>
State of the art<br>
Taxanes, and in particular paclitaxel and docetaxel, currently marketed under the<br>
trade names Taxol® and Taxotere®, are anticancer agents (Huizing M.T. et al.,<br>
Cancer Inv., 1995,13: 381-404) that exert.their antiproliferative effect by acting on<br>
the organisation of the microtubules in the cellular cytoskeletal system. Indeed, by<br>
inhibiting the depolarisation of said microtubules, they prevent their normal<br>
dynamic reorganisation that occurs during mitotic cell division (Manfredi J.J. et al.,<br>
J. -Cell Biol., 1982, 94: 688-696).<br>
The main therapeutic indications for paclitaxel are:<br>
-	therapy for advanced breast cancer;<br>
-	therapy for Kaposi's sarcoma;<br>
-	therapy for carcinoma of the lung (not microcytoma)<br>
-	carcinoma of the ovary, resistant to standard chemotherapy treatment. Moreover, said chemotherapy is also used to treat carcinoma of the bladder, prostate and endometrium.<br>
Given that paclitaxel is insoluble in water, it is mixed with Cremophor® EL (castor oil) - ethyl alcohol in a ratio of 1:1, in the pharmaceutical compositions currently used in cancer chemotherapy (Pfeifer R.W. et al., Am.J.Hosp.Pharrn., 1993, 50:2520-2521). This formulation is usually used for continuous intravenous infusion (for between 3 and 24 hours) at a dosage of 135-175 mg/m2. The presence of Cremophor^ EL in the above said formulation is the main cause of the adverse reactions that normally occur during administration of paclitaxel, ranging from simple attacks of urticaria to dyspnea and bronchospasm, and even anaphylactic shock (Weiss, R.B. et al., J. Clin. Oncol., 1990, 8:1263-1268). ,<br><br>
For this reason, any patient who is going to receive treatment with a pharmaceutical composition of paclitaxel-Cremophoi^ EL must first follow a premedication protocol, with the administration of dexamethasone, possibly associated with an antihistamine. * In spite of these precautions, up to 40% of the patients who receive intravenous infusion of paclitaxel still experience more or less severe adverse reactions. It can therefore be said that the formulation of Taxol® currently in clinical use, and the methods used for administering it, constitute a limitation to its efficacy. This is the reason why research is now being directed towards the synthesis of new pharmaceutical formulations and/or towards new chemical formulations of the above anticancer drug, that are water-soluble.<br>
For instance, researchers have attempted to encapsulate paclitaxel in liposomes, nanocapsules and microspheres constituted by a polymer wall formed by biodegradable co-polymers, such as polylactic acid, and non-biodegradable copolymers, such as ethylene-vinyl-acetate.<br>
Moreover, microspheres have been prepared that are loaded with paclitaxel formed by a biodegradable polymer, such as polyphosphoester, to create a system for the prolonged release of drug at the treatment site in the therapy for lung carcinoma (Nuijen, B. etal., Investigational New Drugs, 2001,19:143-153). There have also been attempts to prepare micelles of said anticancer drug by precipitating paclitaxel in an organic solvent with phosphatidylcholine/bije salts (Nuijen, B. et al., Investigational New Drugs, 2001,19: 143-153). However, these new systems for the encapsulation of paclitaxel may prove troublesome with regard to stability, production and reproducibility. Moreover,   various  attempts  have  been   made  to  dissolve  the   drug  with cyclodextrine, but the new formulations did not give the desired results (Nuijen, B. et al., Investigational New Drugs, 2001,19:143-153).<br>
Chemical research into new formulations of paclitaxel that render the drug more water-soluble while maintaining its efficacy as an anticancer agent, has led to the synthesis of new analogues modified at the C21 and C7 position (US patent application No. 2001/0018531) as well as.to the preparation of new prodrugs.<br><br>
Prodrugs are therapeutically inert drug derivatives that are activated by being<br>
introduced into a. body. There, after spontaneous hydrolysis and/or enzymatic<br>
degradation processes, the active principle is released.<br>
In view of this, and for the above said reasons, many attempts have been made to<br>
synthesise new prodrugs which have led, for instance, to the preparation of drugs<br>
such as acetyl-paclitaxel (Mellado, W. et ah, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.,<br>
1984, 124(2): 329-336), or to the synthesis of new esters of said drug with<br>
succinic, glutaric and sulphonic acid on the carbon in position C21. These esters,<br>
however, proved to be unstable in aqueous environment.<br>
Moreover, some derivatives with a phosphonoxyphenylpropionate ester group at<br>
the C21 or C7 position have been synthesised, such as paditaxel-^-carbonate,<br>
and a series of new amino acid esters of paclitaxel and derivatives thereof, with a<br>
glutaryl group at position C21.<br>
Giutaryl-paclitaxel asparagine and giutaryl-paclitaxel glutamine have proved to be<br>
the two most highly water-soluble products obtained by the type of synthesis<br>
described above, but they are less efficacious than paclitaxel per se (Nuijen, B. et<br>
al., Investigational New Drugs, 2001,19:143-153).<br>
It is also known that paclitaxel has been esterified with poly-L-glutamic acid to form<br>
a new water-soluble derivative of said chemotherapy drug, with a significantly<br>
higher plasma half-life than non-conjugated paclitaxel (Li C. et al.,- Cancer<br>
Research, 1998, 58(11): 2404-2409).<br>
Paclitaxel has also been derivatised with PEG (polyethylene glycol) by esterifying<br>
the chemotherapy drug at position C21; however, the new molecule has proved to<br>
be highly water-soluble but not very stable.<br>
Lastly, a new delivery system for the drug has recently been developed, by the<br>
conjugation of paclitaxel with, human serum albumin (HSA). The paclitaxel-HSA<br>
conjugate has proved to be very water-soluble and capable of carrying up to 30<br>
molecules of chemotherapy drug. However, experiments performed in vitro have<br>
shown it to be less efficacious against cancer than paclitaxel per se (Nuijen, B. et<br>
al., Investigational New Drugs, 2001,19:143-153).<br>
Recently, researchers have synthesized a new delivery system for paclitaxel<br>
esterified with previously modified hyaluronic acid (hereinafter referred to as "HA"),<br><br>
that is HA reacted with molecules of hydrazide bound to the carboxyl group of HA by an amide bond (Luo Y. et al., Biomacromolecules 2000, 1 (2): 208-218; US Patent No. 5,874,417). This new delivery system for paclitaxel enables the drug to go directly to the membrane surface of the target cancer cell, characterized by overexpression of the receptor for HA, CD44. Consequently, the paclitaxel bounded to HA functionalized with a hydrazide proves to be able to bind specifically to the CD44 of the cancer cell, and it is thus enabled (thanks to a process of endocytosis) to enter the cell cytoplasm where it can be enzymatically released and activated, triggering its inhibition of the depolarization of tubuline and therefore of cellular division. This mechanism of selective transport of the drug is called "cell targeting".<br>
Moreover, it is known that HA can be used as a vehicle for anticancer drugs in . pharmaceutical compositions wherein HA is associated with (and not covalently bound to) chemotherapy drugs, such as paclitaxel, to increase their therapeutic efficacy thanks to the targeting phenomenon described above (International Patent Application No. WO 00/41730) and to enable the doses commonly specified in normal chemotherapy protocols to be lowered (International Patent Application No. WO 99/02151).<br>
Lastly, low-molecular-weight HA and/or the lipid derivatives thereof are known to be used to prepare liposomes used for the delivery of drugs, including anticancer drugs such as paclitaxel (International Patent Application No. WO 01/39815). In view of what said above, it is still felt the need of novel taxanes derivatives, which are stable and soluble in water, and therapeutically efficacious at least so as the not-modified taxanes are. Summary of the invention<br>
The Applicant has now found that covalently bounding taxanes to HA or HA derivatives, optionally by means of a spacer, stable and water-soluble products are obtained, useful for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of tumours, autoimmune disorders and restenosis. It is therefor subject of the invention a taxane covalently bounded to HA or to a HA derivative, wherein the covalent bond is formed between hydroxyl groups of the taxane and carboxyl groups or hydroxyl groups of HA or of HA derivatives, or<br><br>
amino groups of deacetylated HA, optionally by means of a spacer linking the<br>
taxane to HA or HA derivative,<br>
with the proviso that the said spacer, is different from a hydrazide.<br>
The present invention further relates to the processes for the preparation of<br>
taxanes covalently bounded to HA or HA derivatives.<br>
Further subject of the invention are the pharmaceutical compositions comprising<br>
as the active substance at least a taxane covalently bounded to HA or HA<br>
derivatives, and their use in the treatment of tumours, autoimmune disorders and<br>
restenosis.<br>
The present taxanes covalently bounded to HA or HA derivatives have many<br>
advantages, which may be summarised as follows:<br>
1)	they are instantly soluble in the bloodstream;<br>
2)	they do not need to be mixed with Cremophor® El for the preparation of formulations, thus overcoming the aforesaid problems concerning hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis;<br>
3)	thanks to the enzymatic action of enzymes such as the esterases commonly present in plasma, the taxanes are instantly released by their vehicle HA or HA. derivative from the present compositions into the blood, where they can freely perform their anticancer activity;<br>
1    4) they enable a new drug to be obtained which, in the case of certain types of cancer, may exert surprising chemotherapy activity that is significantly greater than that obtained when a non-conjugated taxane is administered, when same doses of drug are considered.

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present invention describes compounds belonging to the taxane family,<br>
preferably paclitaxel and docetaxel hereinafter represented by the formulae (I) and<br>
(II) respectively, covalently bounded to HA or HA derivatives, preferably by means<br>
of a spacer as an interface between the taxane component and the HA or HA<br>
derivative, being covalently bound to both molecules.<br><br><br><br>
HA is a linear-chain polymer with a molecular weight which may vary between-50,000 and 13 x 106 Da, according to its source and the method used to obtain it It is present in nature in the pericellular gels, in the fundamental substance of connective tissue in vertebrate organisms (of which it is one of the main components), in the synovial fluid of joints, in the vitreous humor and in the nmhiiiral cord. HA olavs an imoortant role in the biological organism, as a<br><br>
mechanical support for the cells of many tissues such as the skin, the tendons, the . muscles and the cartilage. It is the main component of the extracellular matrix, but it has other functions, such as the hydration of tissues, lubrication, and cell migration and differentiation.<br>
The HA used in the present invention may be extracted from any. source, for example from cocks1 combs, or it may be obtained by the fermentation route, or by technological means, and it may have a molecular weight of between 400 and.3 x 106 Da, in particular between 400 and 1 x 106 Da, and preferably, between 400 and 230,000 Da.<br>
The HA derivatives according to the present invention are preferably selected from the group consisting of the following HA derivatives;<br>
-	HA salified with organic and/or inorganic bases;<br>
. - Hyaff®: HA esters with alcohols of the aliphatic, araliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic, cyclic and heterocyclic series, with an esterification degree that may vary according.to the type and length of the alcohol used, and is in any case never over 50% esterification, and preferably between 0.1 and 20% since the final polymer that is obtained must always be water-soluble, while the remaining percentage of non-esterified HA may be salified with organic and/or inorganic bases, disclosed in US Patent No. 4,851,521 incorporated herewith by reference;<br>
-	Hyadd™: amides of HA with amines of the aliphatic, araliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic, cyclic and heterocyclic series, with a percentage of amidation of between 0.1 and 10%, since the final polymer must always be water-soluble, while the remaining percentage of HA that is not amidated can be salified with organic and/or inorganic bases, disclosed in European patent application No. 1095064 incorporated herewith by reference;<br>
-	O-sulphated HA derivatives to the 4th degree of sulphation, disclosed in US Patent No. 6,027,741 incorporated herewith by reference;<br>
-	ACP®: inner esters of HA with a percentage of esterification of no more than 15%, as the polymer must always be water-soluble, preferably between 0.05 and 10% of esterification, while the remaining percentage of unesterified HA can be salified with organic and/or inorganic bases, disclosed in European patent No. 0341745 B1 incorporated herewith by reference;<br><br>
-	deacetyiates of HA: these derive from the deauoiyiauun ui mo n-awjp<br>
glucosamine unit with a percentage of deacetyiation preferably between-0:1 and<br>
30% while all the carboxylic groups of HA can be salified with organic and/or<br>
inorganic bases, as illustrated in the following.structure (A):<br><br>
Deacetyiates of HA are disclosed in International Patent Application No. WO 02/18450 we incorporate herewith by reference;<br>
-	Hyoxx™: percarboxylated HA derivatives obtained by oxidation of the primary<br>
hydroxyl of the N-acetyl-glucosamine.unit with a degree of percarboxylation of<br>
between 1 and 100%, preferably between 25 and 75%. All the carboxylic groups of<br>
HA can be salified with organic and/or inorganic bases as illustrated in the<br>
following structure (B):<br><br>
Percarboxylated HA derivatives are disclosed in US Patent Application No.<br>
US2003181689.<br>
Moreover, the present compounds wherein a taxane, and in particular paclitaxel, is<br>
covalently bounded to an HA ester, may be obtained by starting from molecules of<br>
chemically unmodified HA and, only after synthesis with the chemotherapydrug,<br><br>
modifying the HA by esterifying it with all the alcohols listed above for the Hyaff® products, or by forming inner esters as in the case of ACP® (see Example 8). The previously listed HA derivatives, that are particularly important in the process of synthesis of the prodrug HA-taxane, and in particular of the prodrug HA-paclitaxel, are the deacetylated and sulphated derivatives because at the same percentages of paclitaxel bound to previously unmodified hyaluronic acid, they render the final product more soluble in the bloodstream. It is known that, by means of the CD44 membrane receptor, HA modulates many different processes relative to cell physiology and biology such as the proliferation, differentiation and locomotion of cancer cells and other cells. Scientific literature has recently demonstrated the efficacy of HA against cancer, when HA is injected as such directly into the cancer growth. It has proved to be able to determine the complete regression of 30% of tumours (Herrera-Gayol, A. et ai., Experimental and Molecular Pathology, 2002, 72:179-185). It is also known that HA can be associated with any chemotherapy drug to prepare many different pharmaceutical compositions, as it is able to act as a second antineoplastic agent that synergically enhances the anticancer action of the drug associated   with   it   (International   Patent   Application   No.   WO   01/47561); alternatively, HA is claimed as an anticancer drug to be administered on its own in various clinical protocols for the reduction/regression of the cancer growth (International Patent Application No. WO 97/40841).<br>
The present taxane covalently bounded to HA or HA derivatives, as above said, differs from all the formulations of taxanes, in particular the covalent bound of paclitaxel with HA or HA derivatives, optionally by means of a spacer, renders the paclitaxel soluble in water, without diminishing its pharmacological efficacy. Indeed, the in vivo experiment described in Example 1 clearly demonstrates the same anticancer efficacy of the present conjugated paclitaxel and non-conjugated paclitaxel, when same doses are administered.<br>
Moreover, HA-paclitaxel can present unexpected pharmacological properties that are different from those of the non-conjugated paclitaxel, especially in the case of certain types of tumour.<br><br>
indeed, Example 2 clearly demonstrates that the present ester derivative of HA bounded to paclitaxel has a new antineoplastic pharmacological activity: in the model of in vitro cytotoxicity described hereafter, the present HA-paclitaxel shows surprising anticancer activity that is.far superior to that exerted by non-conjugated paclitaxel alone.<br>
This new antineoplastic property means that the present taxanes, in particular the paclitaxel, conjugated to HA or HA derivatives, can be used for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions useful as a chemotherapy drug, not only for the treatment of all the forms of tumour for which Taxol® is administered, but also for other forms of tumour not normally treated with Taxol®, such as cancer of the stomach and liver, cancer of the colon, melanoma and leukaemia. Moreover, it can be used in systemic autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune glomerulonephritis and, lastly, Hashimoto's thyroiditis.<br>
The use of the present products in a new pharmacological therapy for the above said pathologies is possible because the new HA-paclitaxel compound reduces the systemic toxicity of Taxol®, thus increasing the therapeutic efficacy of the drug itself, since it is: -water-soluble;<br>
- not associated with Cremophor® EL and is therefore free from the toxic effects that this produces;<br>
-. equally efficacious at doses decidedly lower than (or equal to) those normally used in clinical protocols.<br>
Also known is the use of paclitaxel as a drug to be used to inhibit the process of restenosis that generally. follows angioplasties (prevalently arterial), coronary bypass and organ transplants.<br>
The present taxanes, and in particular the paclitaxel, covalently bounded to HA or HA derivatives can also be used for the prevention of restenosis or they can be used to form an inner coating for stents and devices implanted after the above-listed vascular operations, as it has proved possible to bind it chemically to the surface of said stents or to adsorb it easily to them.<br><br>
In either case, the residence time of the present products on the surface of the stent, and consequently its gradual release into the bloodstream, is greater than that of non-conjugated paclitaxel because the chemical-physical characteristics of HA favour a progressive, slow but continuous release of Taxol® from the surface of the device.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions comprising the present taxanes covalently bounded to HA or HA derivatives can be administered systemically (by the intravenous or arterial, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous or oral routes), it can be used for.topical application (by transdermal absorption), or it can be administered directly into the cancer site by means of injection. HA or a derivative thereof covalently bound to paclitaxel, can also act as an anticancer drug per se.<br>
In the following  Example 3, the Applicant demonstrates how treatment of experimentally-induced tumour growths  in  nude mice with the cross-linked. derivative of HA, ACP®, determines a significant regression of the tumour compared to the non-treated controls.<br>
The Applicant therefore describes for the first time a new role for HA and the derivatives thereof that constitute the present products taxane-HA or taxane-HA derivative, as antineoplastic agents and their relative uses in the field of oncology. The present taxanes covalently bounded to HA or HA derivatives can, moreover, be associated with various biologically and pharmacologically active molecules such as, for example, steroids, hormones, proteins, trophic factors, vitamins, nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs, chemotherapy drugs, calcium-antagonists, antibiotics, antiviral agents, interleukins and cytokines such as. interferon. In this way, it is possible to obtain many different associations of the above said drugs and relative different pharmaceutical compositions comprising the taxanes of the invention.<br>
The present invention also relates to the process for preparing the present taxanes, in particular paclitaxel, covalently bounded to HA or HA derivatives; the present products may be achieved by the following processes: 1) by an indirect synthesis that involves the introduction of a spacer between the taxane and HA or HA derivative, or<br><br>
2) by a direct synthesis between the taxane and HA or HA derivative.<br>
The functional groups of HA or HA derivatives that can react with the taxane<br>
directly or indirectly by means of a spacer, are the following:<br>
1)	hydroxyl groups;<br>
2)	carboxyl groups;<br>
3)	amino groups of deacetylated HA.<br>
The spacer may be for example selected from the group consisting of an aliphatic<br>
or araliphatic chain, linear or branched, substituted by one or more groups<br>
selected from hydroxyl, carboxyl or carbonyl groups, epoxides, acyl chlorides,<br>
mercaptans, nitryls, halogens, anhydrides, isocyahates and isothiocyahates, and<br>
amino groups.<br>
Amongst the possible spacers, the bromides of carboxylic acids having from 2 to<br>
18 carbon atoms are preferable, and in particular those having from 3 to 10 carbon<br>
atoms; more preferred are 3-bromopropionic acid and 4-bromobutyric acid.<br>
The synthesis reaction between the functional hydroxylic groups of HA (or the<br>
derivatives thereof) and a taxane component such as paclitaxel, can be achieved<br>
by a process of indirect or direct synthesis.<br>
Indirect synthesis may lead to the formation of the following types of covalent bond<br>
between the spacer and HA or HA derivatives:<br>
ester.bond:<br>
-	involving the carboxyl function of a suitably chosen spacer that is activated by an activating agent such as, for example, a carbodiimide (Scheme 1 below);<br>
-	involving the hydroxyl groups of HA or HA derivative that are brominated or substituted with a tosyl group with subsequent nucleophilic substitution by the carboxyl of the suitably chosen spacer (Scheme 2 below); or<br>
-	involving the anhydride function of a suitably chosen spacer (Scheme 3 below).<br><br><br><br>
urethane or thiourethane bond:<br>
-	involving the amino group of a suitably chosen spacer (Scheme 4 below); or<br>
-	involving the isocyanate or isothiocyanate function of a suitably chosen spacer (Scheme 5 below).<br><br><br><br>
ether bond:<br>
-	involving the epoxy function of the (suitably chosen) spacer (Scheme 6 below);<br>
-	involving the hydroxy! groups of HA or HA derivative that are brominated or substituted by a tosyl group, with subsequent nucieophilic substitution by the hydroxy! group of a suitably chosen spacer (Scheme 7 below).<br><br><br><br>
acetal or ketal bond:<br>
-	involving the aldehyde and/or ketonic group of the suitably chosen spacer (Scheme 8 below);<br>
-	involving the hydroxyl group of the suitably chosen spacer and requiring the presence of a simple carbonyl compound, such as formaldehyde (Scheme 9 below).<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The reaction between the carboxyl groups of HA or HA derivatives and a taxane such as paclitaxel, can be achieved by a process of direct or indirect synthesis. Indirect synthesis may lead to the formation of the following types of covalent bond between the spacer and HA or HA derivatives: ester bond:<br>
-	the carboxylic group of the suitably chosen spacer, such as 4-brbmobutyric acid, is activated by an activating agent such as a carbodiimide and thus made suitable for synthesis with the hydroxyl group of the taxane (preferably that on carbon at C21), such as paclitaxel. Subsequently, by direct contact in an anhydrous solvent with a quaternary ammonium salt, in particular the tetrabutylammonium (TBA) salt of HA or HA derivative, a nucleophilic substitution is obtained of the carboxyl of HA or HA derivative to the bromine of the spacer. In this way an ester bond is formed between HA or HA derivative and the spacer, in turn bounded to paclitaxel. Alternatively, the nucleophilic substitution of the carboxyl group of HA or HA derivative to the bromine of the spacer may occur before the bond between the spacer itself and the taxane (Scheme 11 below).<br>
-	by using the activating agents of the carboxyl group of HA or HA derivative such as a carbodiimide, it is possible to obtain an ester bond between said group and the hydroxyl function of the (suitably chosen) spacer, previously or subsequently bound to paclitaxel (Scheme 12 below).<br><br><br><br>
. amide bond:<br>
- activation of the carboxyl groups of HA or HA derivatives by an activating agent, enables a linkage with the amino group of the suitably chosen spacer, with the exception of all the hydrazides, previously or subsequently bound to a.taxane such as paclitaxel (Scheme 13 below).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Direct synthesis can lead to the formation of the following type of covalent bond: urethane bond:<br>
- involving the hydroxyl group of the taxane and the amino function of deacetylated HA (Scheme 18).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The spacer can be bound to the taxane such as paclitaxel before or after its<br>
linkage with the functional groups of HA or HA derivatives, depending on the type<br>
of functional groups of the suitably chosen spacer.<br>
The percentage of direct or indirect linkage of the taxane, such as paclitaxel, to HA.<br>
or HA derivative may vary between 0.1% and 100% and preferably between 0.1%<br>
and 35%.<br>
The following examples are given to provide non-limiting illustrations of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Effect of the new ester derivative, of HA with paclitaxel in nude mouse after implant<br>
of neoplastic cells<br>
For this experiment, we used human ovary adenocarcinoma cells, OVCAR-3 cells,<br>
in immuhodepressed nude mice belonging to the Athymic CD-1 species.<br>
Each mouse was inoculated by the intraperitoneal route with 5x106 cancer cells.<br>
Experimental design<br>
Test drugs:<br>
-	Taxol®, 5 animals, treated<br>
-	HYTAD1p20: ester derivative of HA covalently bound to paclitaxel with 16%<br>
of esterification of the carboxyl (w/w). The molecular weight of the HA used<br>
for synthesis of this new drug was 200,000 Da.(see Example 7 for details of<br>
its preparation). Five animals were used for this drug too.<br><br>
Treated animals: 10 animals were first inoculated with OVCAR-3 cells. Five were used for the experiment with Taxol® and another five for the experiment with HYTAD1p20:<br>
-	all ten animals subsequently, received, by intraperitoneal injection, 3 doses<br>
of pharmacological treatment (on the 6th, 13th and 20th days after inoculation<br>
of the cancer cells), equal to 20 mg/kg body weight of Taxol® or 125 mg/kg<br>
body weight of HYTAD (corresponding to 20 mg/mouse of paclitaxel).<br>
Control  animals:  5  animals were first  inoculated with  the  cancer-inducing<br>
suspension of OVCAR-3 cells, after which they did not receive any treatment.<br>
Determination of the survival curve<br>
The survival curve was calculated from the date of intervention to the 92nd day<br>
after inoculation of the cancer ceils into the peritoneum.<br>
Results: the results obtained are illustrated in Figure 1.<br>
Three control animals developed adenocarcinoma of the ovary and died between<br>
the 70th and 75th days after inoculation of the cancer cells.<br>
On the 92nd day after intervention, the last day of the experiment, none of the<br>
animals that had received pharmacological treatment with paclitaxel or HYTAD<br>
had died.<br>
Example 2<br>
In vitro experiment<br>
The aim of the in vitro experiment was mainly to define the activity profile of the<br>
new ester derivatives of HA bound to paclitaxel and to assess/compare the<br>
antineoplastic activity of the HYTAD derivatives vs paclitaxel, thus determining<br>
their pharmacological potential compared to the antineoplastic drug.<br>
Experimental design:<br>
Test products:<br>
-	Taxol®: reference product<br>
-	HYTAD1p20 - HYTAD2p20 - HYTAD2p10: ester derivatives of HA covalently bound to paclitaxel with 16% of esterification of the carboxyl (w/w) (in the case of HYTAD1p20, the molecular weight of the HA used in the synthesis of this new drug is 200,000 Da) (see Example 7 for details of its preparation) or 22% (in the case of HYTAD2p20, the molecular weight of<br><br>
the HA used is 39,000 Da), or 6.8% (in the case of HYTAD2p10, the<br>
molecular weight of the HA used is 39,000 Da). Cell lines<br>
Cell lines of human origin<br>
Four cell lines of human breast cancer were used. All four of the test cell strains normally respond to paclitaxel and express the receptor CD44 apparently with the same amplification.<br>
-	MCF-7<br>
-	MDA-MB-231<br>
-	MDA-MB-468<br>
-	SKBR-3 Experimental protocol:<br><br>
1)	the test cell line is plated at a concentration of 3,000 cells per well, on a flat-bottomed, 96-wef I plate;<br>
2)	24 hours later, the cells are supplemented with the test solutions suitably diluted in culture medium;<br>
3)	after another 72 hours, the cells are tested by colorimetry with 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT); by assessing cell viability, this test also reveals the different sensitivity of the cells to the test drug. This is possible because mitochondrial dehydrogenase is able to reduce the tetrazolium salts (yellow) into blue formazan crystals. The greater or lesser intensity of colour is assessed by spectrophotometry (Dezinot, F. et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 1986, 22 (89): 271-277).<br>
Results<br>
Hereafter we report, in table and graph form in Figure 2, the results obtained in<br>
terms of IC5o (the concentration of drug necessary to inhibit cell growth by 50%<br>
with regard to the test product and the different cell lines used).<br>
In  Figure i2, the axis of abscissas represents the pharmacological  power,<br>
expressed as IC5o and calculated as the ratio between the molar concentrations,<br>
vs the reference product (paclitaxel) which is conventionally taken to have a value<br>
of nil. Consequently, the dashes indicate a pharmacological power that is greater<br>
than the reference product.<br><br>
IC5o (expressed as nM or |iM of paclitaxel or its HYTAD derivatives in the culture medium)<br><br>
Conclusions<br>
As reported in the literature, all the cell lines used are sensitive to taxol, a drug<br>
mainly used to treat metastatic carcinoma of the breast and of the ovary. As<br>
regards the breast cancer cell lines, the various HYTAD proved to be considerably<br>
stronger than paclitaxel, with a factor of +150 with regard to HYTAD1p20 on 1     cancer cell line MCF-7.<br>
