TITLE<br>
“DIAMINOPYRIMIDINES AS P2X3 AND P2X2/3 ANTAGONISTS”<br>
APPLICANT<br>
F. HOFFMANN-LA ROCHE AG<br>
124 Grenzacherstrasse<br>
CH-4070 Basel Switzerland<br>
Nationality : a Swiss company<br>
The following specification particularly describes<br>
the nature of this invention and the manner in which<br>
it is to be performed<br><br>
sDiaminopyrimidines as P2X3 and P2X2/3 Antagonists<br>
This invention pertains to compounds useful for treatment of diseases associated with P2X purinergic receptors, and more particularly to P2X3 and/or P2X2/3 antagonists usable for treatment of genitourinary and pain-related diseases, conditions and disorders.<br>
The urinary bladder is responsible for two important physiological functions: urine storage and urine emptying. This process involves two main steps: (1) the bladder fills progressively until the tension in its walls rises above a threshold level; and (2) a nervous reflex, called the micturition reflex:, occurs that empties the bladder or, if this fails, at least causes a conscious desire to urinate. Although the micturition reflex is an autonomic spinal cord reflex, it can also be inhibited or mediated by centers in the cerebral cortex or brain.<br>
Purines, acting via extracellular purinoreceptors, have been implicated as having a variety of physiological and pathological roles. ATP, and to a lesser extent, adenosine, can stimulate sensory nerve endings resulting in intense pain and a pronounced increase in sensory nerve discharge. ATP receptors have been classified into two major families, the P2Y- and P2X-purinoreceptors, on the basis of molecular structure, transduction mechanisms, and pharmacological characterization. The P2Y-purinoreceptors are G-protein coupled receptors, while the P2X-purinoreceptors are a family of ATP-gated cation channels. Purinergic receptors, in particular, P2X receptors, are known to form homomiHtwiers or heteromiilti-mers. To date, cDNAs for several P2X receptors subtypes have been cloned, including: six homomeric receptors, P2Xt; P2X^ P2X3; P22U P2X5; and P2X7; and three heteromeric receptors P2X2/3, P2X4/6, P2X1/5. The structure and chromosomal mapping of mouse genomic P2X3 receptor subunit has also been described. In vitro, co-expression of P2X2 and P2X3 receptor subunits is necessary to produce ATP-gated currents with the properties seen in some sensory neurons.<br>
P2X receptor subunits are found on afferents in rodent and human bladder urotheu'um. Data exists suggesting that ATP may be released from epithelial/endotlielial cells of the urinary bladder or other hollow organs as a result of distention. ATP released in this manner may serve a role in conveying information to sensory neurons located in subepithelial components, e.g,, suburothelial lamina propria. The P2X receptors have been studied in a number of neurons, including sensory, sympathetic, parasympathetic, mesenteric, and central neurons. These studies indicate that purinergic receptors play a role in afferent<br><br>
-2-<br>
neurotransmission from the bladder, and that modulators of P2X receptors are potentially useful in the treatment of bladder disorders and other genitourinary diseases or conditions.<br>
Recent evidence also suggests a role of endogenous ATP and purinergic receptors in nociceptive responses in mice. ATP-induced activation of P2X receptors on dorsal root ganglion nerve terminals in the spinal cord has been shown to stimulate release of glutamate, a key neurotransmitter involved in nociceptive signaling. P2X3 receptors have been identified on nociceptive neurons in the tooth pulp. ATP released from damaged cells may thus lead to pain by activating P2X3 and/or P2X3 containing receptors on nociceptive sensory nerve endings. This is consistent with the induction of pain by intradennaUy applied ATP in the human blister-base model. P2X antagonists have been shown to be analgesic in animal modds. This evidence suggests that P2X2 and PZX3 are involved in nociception, and that modulators of P2X receptors are potentially useful as analgesics.<br>
There is accordingly a need for methods of treating diseases, conditions and disorders mediated by P2X3 and/or P2X2/3 receptors, as well as a need for compounds that art as modulators of P2X receptors, including antagonists of P2X3 and P2X2/3 receptors. The present invention satisfies these needs as well as others.<br>
Many diaminopyrimidine compounds, such as “onnetoprim” (US 2,658,897) and “tri-metoprim” (US 2,909,522), have previously been made and identified as antibacterial agents. However, no diaminopyrimidines have heretofore been identified as modulators of P2X receptors.<br>

The starting materials and the intermediates of the synthetic reaction schemes can be isolated and purified if desired using conventional techniques, including but not limited to, filtration, distillation, crystallization, chromatography, and the like. Such materials can be characterized using conventional means, including physical constants and spectral data.<br>
Unless specified to the contrary, the reactions described herein preferably are conducted under an inert atmosphere at atmospheric pressure at a reaction temperature range of from about -78°C to about 150°C, more preferably from about 0°C to about 125°C, and most preferably and conveniently at about room (or ambient) temperature (RT), e.go about 20oC.<br>
Scheme A below illustrates one synthetic procedure usable to prepare specific compounds of formula (I) wherein X is methylene, Y is -NRdRe, and R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, Rd, and Re are as defined herein.<br><br>
SCHEME A<br>
In Step 1 of Scheme A, beozaldehyde a is alkyiated with the Grignard reagent derived from 4-chloro-5-iodo-2-methylsulfanyl-pyrimidine b or like iodopyrimidine to provide an alpha-hydroxy benzyl pyrimidine c. The iodopyrimidine used in this step may be prepared according to the procedure described by Sakamoto et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull 34:2719 (1986). Numerous substituted benzaldebydes a are commercially available or are readily prepared by techniques well known to those skilled in the art In many instances, a “masked aldehyde”, such as an imine or oxazoline, may be used to allow introduction of desired functionalities to benzaldehyde a, after which the masked aldehyde is deprotected to provide the free aldehyde group. Aldehyde protection schemes of this sort are shown in the experimental examples below.<br><br>
-45-<br>
The reaction of step 1 may be carried out in the presence of an alfcyi magnesium bromide under dry polar aprotic solvent conditions.<br>
In step 2, alpha-hydroxy benzyl pyrimidine c is reduced to provide benzyl pyrimidine d. The reduction of step 2 may be achieved using triethyisilane and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) under polar solvent conditions.<br>
In step 3, a first amination by reaction of amine e with benzyl pyrimidine d yields benzyl aminopyrimidine f Amine e may comprise any suitable primary or secondary amine having functionalities R7 or R8 in accordance with the invention. Amine e may comprise, e.g., ammonia, methykmine, ethylamine, isopropylamine, aniline, benzylamine, phenylethylamine, cyclopropylamuie, dimethylamine, aziridine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, or the like. The amination of step 3 may be carried out by heating benzyl pyrimidine d in the presence of excess amine e under sealed conditions.<br>
In step 4, an oxidation of the methykulfanyl group of benzyl aminopyrimidine f is carried out to afford amino median esulfonyl benzylpyrimidine g. The oxidation of step 4 may be carried out using metachloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA), OXONE® , or Eke oxidizing agent under mild, polar solvent conditions.<br>
A second amination occurs in step 6 in which amino methanesulfonyi benzylpyrimidine g is treated with amine h to displace the methanesulfonyi group and provide diamino benzyipyrimidine i. The diamino benzylpyrimidine i is a compound of formula (I) and is usable in the methods of the invention. The amination of step 6 may be achieved by heating amino methanesulfonyi benzylpyrimidine g in the presence of excess amine h under mild pressure and polar solvent conditions.<br>
Numerous variations on the above procedure are possible and will suggest themselves to those skilled in the art upon review of this disclosure. For example, various pyrimidine reagents may be used in place of iodopyrimidine b in step 1, In such variation, described in the experimental examples below, benzaldehyde a_ may be treated with 5-Iithio-2,6-dimethoxypyrimidine [Mathson et al., JOC 55(10);3410-3412 (1990)] to form a dimethoxy benzyl pyrimidine alchohol which is subsequently oxidized with Mno2. The resultant ketone can then be aminated to displace the methoxy groups to yield a diamino benzylpyrimidine in accordance with the invention.<br><br>
-46-<br>
Scheme B below illustrates another synthetic procedure usable to prepare specific compounds of formula (I) above, wherein X is O,Y is -NR Re, R andR are hydrogen, and R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, Rd, and Rc are as denned herein.<br><br>
SCHEME B<br>
In step 1 of Scheme B, an O-alkylation is carried out by reaction of phenol i with a haloacetonitrile such as iodoacetonitrile K, to aSbrd cyano ether 1. Numerous substituted phenols i are either commercially available or may be prepared by techniques well known in the art for use in step 1. For example, the substituted benzaldehydes a of Scheme A above may be converted to the corresponding phenols i via Baeyer-Villiger oxidation using peradd such as mCPBA, as illustrated in the experimental examples below. The alkylation of step 1 may be effected in the presence ofmild base under polar aproric solvent conditions.<br>
In step 2, a cyano enol ether compound n is formed by treatment of cyano ether 1 with a strong base such as sodium hydride, followed by introduction of ester m to form an enolate, that in turn is alleviated by addition of iodomethane or other addition halide. This step may be carried out under polar aproric solvent conditions.<br>
In step 3 cyano enol ether n is reacted with guanidine compound o in the presence of base, under polar aprotic conditions, to yield diaminopyrimidine (VI). The diaminopyrimidine (VI) is a compound of formula (I) usable in the methods of the invention.<br>
As in the case of Scheme A discussed above, numerous variations on the procedure of Scheme B are possible and will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, selective amination of the -NH2 group of diamino pyrimidine P, using reductive amination<br><br>
-47-<br>
or like technique, may be used to introduce R7 and R8 functionalities in accordance with formula (I).<br>
Yet another procedure usable for preparation of the subject compounds is shown in Scheme C, wherein R1, R2 R3, R4 and R5 are as defined herein. Scheme C represents the well-known synthesis of “ormetoprim” and “trirnethoprirn” antibacterials. This synthetic procedure is reported byMancband et al,, J. Org. Chem. 57:3531-3535 (1992).<br><br>
SCHEME C<br>
In the procedure of Scheme C, benzaldehyde a is treated with acryionitrile in the presence of sodium methoxide in step I to afford a phenyl methoxymethyi cinnamonitrile compound g, which in turn is reacted with guanidine in step 2 to yield the diaminopyrimidine r. Diamino pyrimidine r is a compound of formula (I) in which X is –CH2-s Y is -NH2 and R6, R7 and R8 are hydrogen.<br>
The procedure of Scheme C is effective for use with benzaldehydes a in which groups R1  and R are small such that the aldehyde functionality in step 1, and methoxymethyl cinnamonitrile functionality in step 2, are relatively unhindered. However, the introduction, e.g., of R1 as an isopropyl or larger alkyla group, reduces the yield of step 1 nominally to zero. Table 2 below summarizes the relative yields provided by Scheme C for various benzaldehyde starting materials.<br>

Test compounds (dissolved in DMSO at 10 mM and serially diluted with FB) or vehicle were added to each well (25 pi of a 4X solution) and allowed to equilibrate for 20 minutes at RT The plates were then placed in the FLIPR and a baseline fluorescence measurement (excitation at 488 nm and emission at 510-570 nm) was obtained for 10 seconds before a 100 μl/well agonist or vehicle addition. The agonist was a 2X solution of α β,-meATP pro-<br><br>
-139-<br>
ducing a final concentration of 1 μM (P2X3) or 5 μM (P2X2/3). Fluorescence was measured for an additional 2 minutes at 1 second intervals after agonist addition. A final addition of ionomycin (5 μM, final concentration) was made to each well of the FLIPR test plate to establish cell viability and maximum fluorescence of dye-bound cytosolic calcium. Peak fluorescence in response to the addition of α β -meATP (in the absence and presence of test compounds) was measured and inhibition curves generated using nonlinear regression. PPADS, a standard P2X antagonist, was used as a positive control.<br>
Using the above procedure, compounds of the invention exhibited activity for the P2X3 re-ceptor. The compound N*2*-Isopropyl-5-(2-isopropyl-4-5-diinetlioxy-benzyl)-pyrimidine-2,4-diamine, e.g., exhibited a pIC5o of approximately 7.54 using the above assay.<br>
Surprisingly and unexpectedly, compounds of formulae (I - IV) wherein R1 is isopropyl exhibit better affinity for P2X3 than compounds wherein R1 is any other alkyl or other substituent Table 3 below provides comparison pIC50 data for various compounds of different R1 substituents.<br>
TABLE 3<br><br>
As can be seen from Table 3, compounds of the invention wherein R is isopropyl exhibit better affinity for the P2X3 receptor than analogous compounds having other alkyl<br>
substituentsasR1.<br>
