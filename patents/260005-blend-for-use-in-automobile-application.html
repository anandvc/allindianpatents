				<td>BLEND FOR USE IN AUTOMOBILE APPLICATION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a blend comprising polypropylene and an<br>
elastomer component for use in automotive applications, especially for use in<br>
interior automobile applications.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Polypropylene has taken on an important role as base material for the<br>
automotive industry. Today, it is widely used for exterior automotive applications,<br>
such as bumpers and side sills, as well as interior automotive applications, such<br>
as dashboards and interior trim. Polypropylene offers the advantages of having<br>
a low density, good mechanical strength, good heat resistance, good chemical<br>
resistance etc. as well as that of being a low-cost material in comparison to<br>
other suitable materials.<br>
Originally the limited impact strength of polypropylene Was a limiting factor in its<br>
use for automotive applications. This problem has, however, been overcome by<br>
blending polypropylene with elastomers. The elastomer component of the blend<br>
results in improved impact strength and an increased brittle temperature. Blends<br>
of this type are for example disclosed in document US 6,797,779. Among a<br>
large number of possible polypropylenes metallocene-catalyzed polypropylenes<br>
are included as well.<br>
Further, US-A-2004/0044107 discloses interior automotive parts comprising<br>
(A) a crystalline homopolypropylene,<br>
(B) a crystalline homopolypropylene and an ethylene-propylene copolymer<br>
rubber, said rubber having an intrinsic viscosity on 4.0 to 7.0 dl/g (decalin,<br>
135°C), ethylene content from 45 % to 80 % by mass and the rubber being<br>
present in at least 10 % by mass of the homopolypropylene,<br>
(C) a crystalline homopolypropylene and an ethylene-propylene copolymer<br>
rubber, said rubber having an intrinsic viscosity on 5.0 to 10 dl/g (decalin,<br>
135°C), ethylene content from 45 % to 80 % by mass and the rubber being<br>
present in at least 10 % by mass of the homopolypropylene, and<br>
(D) an ethylene/ a-olefin rubber.<br>
The resulting interior automotive parts are characterized by good molding<br>
properties and a good balance of physical properties, as well as good<br>
appearance, lower gloss and scratch resistance. The homopolypropylene (A)<br>
has a fraction soluble in boiling p-xylene, which suitably is 6.0 % by mass or<br>
less, preferably 3.0 % by mass or less, more preferably 0.1 to 2.0 % by mass.<br>
US-A-2007/0037914 discloses automotive parts formed from filled thermoplastic<br>
polyolefin compositions, wherein the filled thermoplastic compositions comprise<br>
a highly crystalline isotactic propylene homopolymer, an ethylene/a-olefin<br>
elastomeric impact modifier, and a reinforcing grade of a platy filler, for example<br>
talc. The invention aims at providing automotive parts that have excellent<br>
thermal and mechanical properties. The document makes not mention of<br>
emissions originating from such automotive parts.<br>
In light of an overall reduction of emissions from cars the emission of volatile<br>
organic compounds (VOC) coming from polypropylene-based automotive parts<br>
has recently attracted special attention.<br>
None of the above-cited documents addresses this problem. It is noted in this<br>
respect that a low level of solubles e.g. in boiling p-xylene cannot be taken as an<br>
indication of low VOC emissions. It has to be kept in mind that the volatile<br>
organic compounds (VOC) are removed together with the p-xylene when the p-<br>
xylene is removed for the isolation of the solubles.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide polypropylene-based<br>
blends showing good mechanical properties and in particular good rigidity and<br>
impact strength while at the same time having low emissions of volatile organic<br>
compounds (VOC).<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an automobile part comprising a<br>
blend, said blend comprising<br>
(a) 99.1 - 20 wt% of a polypropylene produced in the presence of a<br>
metallocene-based catalyst, and<br>
(b) 0.1 - 50 w% of an elastomer,<br>
said blend having less than 45 ppm of volatile organic compounds (determined<br>
in accordance with VDA-278).<br>
The invention also relates to the use of a blend comprising<br>
(a) 99.1 - 20 wt% of a polypropylene produced in the presence of a<br>
metallocene-based catalyst, and<br>
(b) 0.1 - 50 w% of an elastomer,<br>
for producing automobile parts having less than 45 ppm of volatile organic<br>
compounds (determined in accordance with VDA-278).<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The blends used in the present invention comprise<br>
(a) 99.1 - 20 wt% of a polypropylene produced in the presence of a<br>
metallocene-based catalyst, and<br>
(b) 0.1 - 50 w% of an elastomer.<br>
The metallocene polypropylenes, i.e. the polypropylenes produced in presence<br>
of a metallocene-based catalyst, used in the present invention can be<br>
homopolymers or copolymers of propylene and at least one comonomer. Said<br>

matrix, which in turn is made of a metallocene propylene homopolymer or<br>
random copolymer as defined above, and a rubber phase. Preferably, the<br>
metallocene heterophasic copolymers are copolymers of propylene and<br>
ethylene. They have an ethylene content in the range from 4 wt% to 15 wt%.<br>
The metallocene heterophasic copolymers comprise from 5 wt% to 35 wt% of<br>
rubber phase. Preferably, the rubber phase is an ethylene propylene rubber<br>
(EPR).<br>
Metallocene propylene homopolymers are the most preferred metallocene<br>
polypropylenes used in the present invention.<br>
The polymerization of propylene and one or more optional comonomers is<br>
performed in the presence of one or more metallocene-based catalytic systems<br>
comprising one or more metallocenes, a support and an activating agent. Such<br>
metallocene-based catalytic systems are known to the person skilled in the art<br>
and need not be explained in detail.<br>
The metallocene component used to prepare the metallocene polypropylene can<br>
be any bridged metallocene known in the art. Preferably it is a metallocene<br>
represented by the following general formula.<br><br>
wherein<br>
the bridge R1 is -(CR10R11)P- or -(SiR10R11)p- with p = 1 or 2, preferably it is -<br>
(SiR10R11)-;<br>
M is a metal selected from Ti, Zr and Hf, preferably it is Zr;<br>
X1 and X2 are independently selected from the group consisting of halogen,<br>
hydrogen, C1-C10 alkyl, C6-C15 aryl, alkylaryl with C1-C10 alkyl and C6-C15 aryl;<br>
R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10 and R11 are each independently selected from<br>
the group consisting of hydrogen, C1-C10 alkyl, C5-C7 cycloalkyl, C6-C15 aryl,<br>
alkylaryl with C1-C10 alkyl and C6-C15 aryl, or any two neighboring R may form a<br>
cyclic saturated or non-saturated C4-C10 ring; each R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9,<br>
R10 and R11 may in turn be substituted in the same way.<br>
The preferred metallocene components are represented by the general formula<br>
(I), wherein<br>
the bridge R1 is SiR10R11;<br>
M is Zr;<br>
X1 and X2 are independently selected from the group consisting of halogen,<br>
hydrogen, and C1-C10 alkyl; and<br>
(C5R2R3R4R5) and (C5R6R7R8R9) are indenyl of the general formula<br>
C9R12R13R14R15R16R17R18R19, whereinR12, R13, R14, R15, R16, R17, R18 and R19<br>
are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C1-C10<br>
alkyl, C5-C7 cycloalkyl, C6-C15 aryl, and alkylaryl with C1-C10 alkyl and C6-C15<br>

saturated or non-saturated C4-C10 ring; and<br>
each R10, R11, R12, R13, R14, R15, R16, R17, R18 and R19 may in turn be substituted<br>
in the same way.<br>
The polypropylenes produced with the preferred metallocene compounds have<br>
surprisingly been identified as having a very low content of volatile organic<br>
compounds (VOC).<br>
Particularly suitable metallocenes are those having C2-symmetry.<br>
Examples of particularly suitable metallocenes are:<br>
dimethylsilanediyl-bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride,<br>
dimethylsilanediyl-bis(2-methyl-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride,<br>
dimethylsilanediyl-bis(3-methyl-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride,<br>
dimethylsilanediyl-bis(3-tert-butyl-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride,<br>

ethylene-bis(tetrahydroindenyl)zirconium dichloride,<br>
isopropylidene-(3-tert-butyl-5-methyl-cyclopentadienyl)(fluorenyl) zirconium<br>
dichloride.<br>
The polymerization of propylene and one or more optional comonomers in<br>
presence of a metallocene-based catalytic system can be carried out according<br>
to known techniques in one or more polymerization reactors. The metallocene<br>
polypropylenes of the present invention are preferably produced by<br>
polymerization in liquid propylene at temperatures in the range from 20°C to<br>
100°C. Preferably, temperatures are in the range from 60°C to 80°C. The<br>
pressure can be atmospheric or higher. It is preferably between 25 and 50 bar.<br>
The molecular weight of the polymer chains, and in consequence the melt flow<br>
of the metallocene polypropylene, is regulated by the addition of hydrogen to the<br>
polymerization medium.<br>
The metallocene polypropylenes of the present invention are characterized by a<br>
melt flow index in the range from 1 to 100 dg/min (as measured according to<br>
ISO 1133, condition L, at 230°C under 2.16 kg). Preferably, the melt flow index<br>
is at least 5 dg/min, and more preferably it is at least 10 dg/min. Preferably, the<br>
melt flow index is at most 80 dg/min, more preferably at most 60 dg/min, even<br>
more preferably at most 50 dg/min, and most preferably at most 40 dg/min.<br>
The metallocene propylene homopolymers used in the present invention are<br>
characterized by a melting temperature in the range from 135°C to 165°C,<br>
preferably in the range from 140°C to 160°C, and most preferably in the range<br>
from 145X to 155°C. The determination of melting temperatures is well known<br>
to the person skilied in the art. Generally, in order to erase the thermal history of<br>
the samples they are first heated to a temperature above the melting<br>
temperature, e.g. to 200°C, and kept there for a time, e.g. for 3 minutes. After<br>
cooling the sample are then reheated for the measurement of the melting<br>
temperature.<br>
The metallocene propylene homopolymers used in the present invention are<br>
characterized by a xylene solubles content of less than 3 wt%, preferably of less<br>
than 2.5 wt%, and most preferably of less than 2 wt%. The xylene solubles<br>
content is determined by dissolving the polypropylene in refluxing xylene,<br>
cooling of the solution to 25°C, filtering the solution, and subsequent evaporation<br>
of the solvent. The residue, which is the xylene soluble portion of the<br>
polypropylene, is then dried and weighed.<br>
The metallocene polypropylenes used in the present invention are characterized<br>
by a high isotacticity, for which the content of mmmm pentads is a measure. The<br>
content of mmmm pentads is at least 95 %, preferably at least 97 %. The<br>
isotacticity is determined by NMR analysis according to the method described by<br>
G.J. Ray et al. in Macromolecules, vol. 10, n° 4, 1977, p. 773-778. It is<br>
performed on the dried product resulting from the extraction by boiling hexane of<br>
the xylene insoluble fraction.<br>
Whilst not wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that the degradation of<br>
polypropylene and in consequence the formation of volatile organic compounds<br>
is partly due to metallic residues from the polymerization catalyst. It is therefore<br>
desirable to have a low content of metallic residues in the polypropylene. The<br>
metallocene polypropylene used in the present invention is therefore<br>
characterized by a zirconium content in the range from 0.01 ppm to 5 ppm. The<br>
zirconium content is preferably at least 0.1 ppm. The zirconium content is<br>
preferably 4 ppm or less, more preferably 3 ppm or less, even more preferably 2<br>
ppm or less and most preferably 1 ppm or less. The zirconium content can be<br>
measured by an inductively coupled plasma technique with atomic emission<br>
spectroscopy.<br>
The elastomer, also referred to as "rubber", used in the present invention can be<br>
any elastomer known in the art. The elastomer can for example be selected from<br>
the group consisting of natural rubber, butadiene elastomer, isoprene elastomer,<br>
chloroprene elastomer, hydrogenated styrene-butadiene elastomer, styrene-<br>
ethylene/butene-styrene block copolymer, hydrogenated styrene-isoprene<br>
elastomer, hydrogenated styrene-ethylene/isoprene-styrene block copolymer,<br>
acrylic rubber, butyl elastomer, ethylene-propylene elastomer, ethylene-octene<br>
elastomer, ethylene-butylene elastomer, styrene-butadiene-styrene elastomer,<br>
butylene-propylene elastomer, pentene-propylene elastomer, hexene-propylene<br>
elastomer, octene-propylene elastomer, ethylene-propylene-ethylidene<br>
norbomene elastomer, ethylene-propylene-vinyl norbornene elastomer,<br>
ethylene-propylene-unconjugated diene elastomer, hydrogenated ethylene-<br>
butadiene elastomer, styrene butadiene styrene, and mixtures thereof. The<br>
preferred elastomers are ethylene-propylene elastomers, ethylene-octene<br>
elastomers, ethylene-butylene elastomers, styrene-butadiene-styrene<br>
elastomers and mixtures thereof.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, the blend comprises<br>
from 0 wt% to 50 wt% of a mineral filler, said mineral filler being preferably<br>
selected from the group consisting of talc, wollastonite, mica, glass fibers,<br>
calcium carbonate and mixtures thereof. The preferred amount of mineral filler<br>
is in the range from 5 wt% to 40 wt% of the blend, and more preferably in the<br>
range from 10 wt% to 30 wt%. Surprisingly, it has been found that the narrower<br>
molecular weight distribution of a metallocene polypropylene as compared to a<br>
Ziegler-Natta polypropylene does not negatively influence the distribution of the<br>
mineral filler in the blend.<br>
According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, said blend<br>
comprises from 0 wt% to 79.9 wt% of a propylene polymer selected from the<br>
group consisting of Ziegler-Natta catalyzed propylene homopolymers and<br>
copolymers and mixtures thereof, that is, propylene polymers polymerized in the<br>
presence of a non-metallocene-based catalyst.<br>
The blend according to the present invention may also comprise from 0 wt% to<br>
10 wt%, preferably' from 0.1 wt% to 5 wt% of additives such as, by way of<br>
example, antioxidants, light stabilizers, acid scavengers, lubricants, antistatic<br>
additives, nucleating/clarifying agents, colorants, as long as the addition of the<br>
additive does not obstruct the above-mentioned objects of the present invention.<br>
An overview of such additives may be found in Plastics Additives Handbook, ed.<br>
H. Zweifel, 5th edition, 2001, Hanser Publishers.<br>
The blend is prepared in any known manner, such as by mechanical blending in<br>
an extruder. According to one embodiment, the metallocene polypropylene, the<br>
elastomer, the optional mineral filler, the optional Ziegler-Natta polypropylene<br>
and the optional additives are introduced into the extruder in the form of a<br>
powder or of pellets. The optional mineral filler is preferably introduced in the<br>
middle of the extruder. In a preferred embodiment, the extruder is equipped with<br>
a vacuum pump on an extruder vent that allows removal of volatile organic<br>
compounds (VOC) from the blend.<br>
It has been surprisingly noted that even though a vacuum pump was used to<br>
remove volatile organic compounds (VOC) during extrusion of a blend<br>
comprising Ziegler-Natta polypropylene the residual content of volatile organic<br>
compounds (VOC) was drastically reduced when said Ziegler-Natta<br>
polypropylene was substituted by metallocene polypropylene. In fact, the<br>
reduction in volatile organic compounds (VOC) was surprisingly high in view of<br>
the percentage of polypropylene in the blend.<br>
The mechanical properties of the blends of the present invention comprising<br>
metallocene polypropylene resemble those of the respective blends wherein the<br>
metallocene polypropylene is substituted by a Ziegler-Natta polypropylene. In a<br>
preferred aspect the flexural modulus of a blend comprising the metallocene<br>
polypropylene is at least 70 %, preferably at least 80 % and most preferably at<br>
least 90 % of the flexural modulus of the respective blend, wherein the<br>
metallocene polypropylene is substituted by a Ziegler-Natta polypropylene. In<br>
another preferred aspect the impact strength of the blend comprising the<br>
metallocene polypropylene is at least 70 % and preferably at least 80 % of the<br>
impact strength of the respective blend, wherein the metallocene polypropylene<br>
is substituted by a Ziegler-Natta polypropylene.<br>
The present invention also relates to the use of a blend according to the present<br>
invention for manufacturing automobile parts. In particular, it relates to the use of<br>
a blend according to the present invention for producing automobile parts having<br>
less than 45 ppm of volatile organic compounds (determined in accordance with<br>
VDA-278).<br>
The details and embodiments described above in connection with the blend<br>
also apply to the use according to the present invention.<br>
The automobile parts of the invention are preferably produced by molding the<br>
propylene-based resin composition in any conventional injection molding<br>
method such as injection molding, extrusion, compressed injection molding and<br>
vapor-blowing injection molding. The preferred method is injection molding.<br>
The blends of the present invention can be used to produce automobile parts<br>
such as interior parts like door panels, instrument panels, consoles, A,B,C pillar<br>
trims, seat protectors, air ducts, door lists, door trims, air-bag containers and<br>
others. The automobile parts also include exterior parts like body panels,<br>
bumpers, rocker panels, door lists, side sills, cowl covers and others.<br>

PEB3089 Black color masterbatch with 40 wt% of carbon black, having a<br>
carbon black particle size between 20 nm and 25 nm in a LDPE<br>
carrier, supplied by Hubron Manufacturing Division Ltd.<br>
BLENDS<br>
These blend components were used to prepare blends according to the present<br>
invention and also comparative blends outside of the scope of the present<br>
invention. Blend compositions are shown in table 1 with the amounts given in<br>
wt% of the total blend. The blends were compounded on a Leistritz Micro27<br>
GL36D extruder and the test samples needed for performing mechanical and<br>
other testing were injection molded on an Engel ES 500 / 125 HL injection<br>
molding machine.<br><br>
TEST METHODS<br>
The melt flow index was measured according to norm ISO 1133, condition L,<br>
using a weight of 2.16 kg and a temperature of 230 °C.<br>
The coefficient of linear thermal expansion (CLTE) was determined according to<br>
ASTM D696..<br>
Flexural modulus was measured according to ISO 178. Tensile modulus was<br>
measured according to ISO 527. The same measurement gave values for stress<br>
at yield, strain at yield and elongation at break.<br>
Cut-notched Izod impact strength was measured according to ISO 180-1A at 23<br>
°C. Cut-notched Charpy impact strength was measured according to ISO 179-<br>
1eA at 23°C and -20°C.<br>
Furthermore, two tests were performed in order to measure the total desorption<br>
as well as the amount of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and the fogging<br>
(FOG), according to the German automobile standard VDA-278. In this latter<br>
test, in order to measure the amount of VOC, the material is heated to 90 °C and<br>
maintained at this temperature for 30 minutes. The vapors are then condensed<br>
at -150 °C, and the composition of the condensate is determined by gas<br>
chromatography. After the VOC has been measured, the sample is further<br>
heated up to 120 °C and maintained in this temperature for 60 minutes, in order<br>
to measure the FOG. The vapors are then condensed and the content of the<br>
condensate is determined in the same manner as for VOC.<br>
RESULTS<br>
Results of the analyses for the example blends and the comparative example<br>
blends are given in table 2 for mechanical properties. Results of the test<br>
according to VD1-278 are shown in table 3.<br>
The results in table 2 show that similar mechanical properties are obtained when<br>
replacing the Ziegler-Natta catalyzed polypropylenes partially or totally with<br>
metallocene catalyzed polypropylenes.<br>
In summary the results show that the use of metallocene polypropylenes in<br>
blends for automotive applications leads to a drastic reduction in the emission of<br>
volatile organic compounds. Surprisingly, the use of metallocene polypropylene<br>
in blends for automotive applications does not lead to a loss in mechanical<br>
properties as compared to the respective blends with Ziegler-Natta<br>
polypropylenes.<br>
