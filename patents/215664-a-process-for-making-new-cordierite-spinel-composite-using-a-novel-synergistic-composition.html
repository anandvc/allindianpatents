				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for making<br>
Cordierite-Spinel composites using a novel synergistic composition <br>
from garnet beach sana and a process for making the new Cordierite-Spinel composites.<br>
The Cordierite-Spinel composites are mainly used as structural material,<br>
electroceramics, kiln furniture.<br>
Cordierite, a stable material can be easily obtained from materials such as<br>
pure oxide , carbonate, any type of clay, talc, sepiolite for which   reference<br>
may be made to P. Grosjean, Interceram, Vol 42(1), 1993 (11-15) wherein the<br>
cordierite is made by using Luzenac talc and a very refractory pure kaolinite.<br>
Reference may also be made to L.D. Zobina, G. D. Semchenko, Refractories<br>
Jr. (Jan-Feb), 72-75, 1983, wherein cordierite has been developed by<br>
Shavrov clay and other two Types of kaolin. Reference may be made to £.<br>
Medvedovski, Interceram Vol 45(2), 82-86 (1396), wherein cordierite has<br>
been developed by using a MgO containing component and ciay and<br>
aiuminosilicate fluxes.<br>
The drawbacks of the above processes for making cordierite are given beiow<br>
1.	The sintering temperature in all the above cases are high and in the<br>
temperature range 1300 -1350°C.<br>
2.	Beneficiation of raw materials are required prior to processing.<br>
3.	Lower mechanical strength due to inherent microstructurai defects.<br>
5. High shrinkage and deformation.	6. Shorter firing range.<br>
To the best of our knowledge, no such literature is available on Cordierite-Spinel composite material.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a composition useful for making new Cordierite-Spinel composites from garnet beach sand.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for making new Cordierite-Sponel composites from garnet beach sand which obviates the drawback as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to improve mechanical properties of the product.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to eliminate the step of beneficiation of raw materials used.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to widen the firing range.<br>
The composition of the present invention is not a mere admixture but a synergistic mixture having properties which are different and distinct from the mere aggregation of the properties of the individual ingredients.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a composition useful for making new Cordierite-Spinel composites from garnet beach sand which comprises:<br>
Garnet sand	50 - 60 wt%<br>
Talc	15-25wt%<br>
Clay	10-20wt%<br>
Nucleating Agents      0-10 wt%<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the garnet sand used may have the following characteristics-<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the clay used may   have the following characteristics-<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the nucleating agent used may be transition metal oxides, Zirconium oxide, Titanium oxide. Accordingly the present invention provides a process for making new Cordierite-Spinel composites using a novel synergistic composition comprising 50 - 60 wt% garnet sand, 15-25 wt% talc, 10-20 wt% clay, 0-10 wt% nucleating agents , which comprises grinding of garnet sand such as herein described, for a period in the range of 12 - 35 hours and sieving with 300 BS mesh size, drying the said ground garnet sand, proportioning and thorough mixing of the ground garnet sand with talc, clay and nucleating agents such as herein described , for 4-5 hours, sieving through 100 mesh BS , mixing the resultant with a binding agent as defined herein, granulating and ageing for 20-24 hours after granulation, compacting the powder by conventional methods used in ceramic fabrication, drying at the unfired compacts at 110° -120°C followed by firing at a temperature in the range of 1100°-1200°C for a period in the range of 1 to 3 hours to get the new Cordierite-Spinel composites In an embodiment of the present invention clay and talc may be ground to pass 300 BS mesh.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention binding agent used may be such as Polyvinyl alcohol, molasses.<br>
The details of the process of the present invention are given below :<br>
1.	Garnet sand is ground in ball mill with water for a period of 12-35 hours to<br>
pass through a 300 mesh size.<br>
2.	The wet ground garnet sand is dried.<br>
3.	50-60% of the fine garnet sand is dry mixed with 15-25% talc, 10-20%<br>
clay and 0-10% nucleating agents for 4 to 5 hours.<br>
4.	The final mix is sieved through 100 mesh B.S.<br>
5.	The binding agent such as molasses or polyvinyl alcohol is added to the<br>
final mix and granulation done and kept for 24 hours for ageing.<br>
6.	The granulated mix is pressed in a shape of pellet and bars by usual<br>
methods of pressing.<br>
7.	The pressed shapes are dried in an oven at 110 -120°C and fired at<br>
temperature in the range of 1100-1200°C for a period in the range of 1 to 3<br>
hours.<br>
The process of the present invention can be used to produce new Ccrdierite-Spinel composites of various shapes and sizes required for application as structural materials, kiln furnitures.<br>
Garnet generally transform to substitutional spinel solid solution during sintering. This in-situ spinel formation has been utilised to form a new Cordierite-Spine! composite to achieve an excellent property combination at much lower temperature. In the present work talc and clay are mixed with the garnet sand which fired at much lower temperature (1100 - 1200°C) and the ultimate product found, primarily consist of cordierite and spinel which do not<br>
coexist in nature. The crystallisation usually progresses through intermediate metastable stage during heat treatment and finally the stable phases developed which mainly depend on the chemical composition and thermal history of the base materials,   as well as the addition of small amount of nucleating agents. In this case, both low temperature form ((3-cordierite) and metastable form (fi-cordierite) readily converts to the stable form (a cordierite) in the temperature range of 1100-1200°C when heated in air. The transition metal oxides or the nucleating agents are added to the mix in order to accelerate the formation of major cordierite phase at much lower temperature. The other major phase developed is spinel and there is a continuous replacement series from spinel to hercynite. The melting point of spine! is very high (2135°C) and also show much superior properties alongwith cordierite compared to normal cordierite ceramics. The simultaneous growth of cordierite and spinel gives improved microstructure at much lower temperature and show much superior properties combinations such as low shrinkage, low thermal expansion, low porosity, high bending strength, high compressive strength etc.<br>
