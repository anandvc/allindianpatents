				<td>A NON-INTERUSIVE DEVICE FOR ALLOWING SPECTRUM ANALYSIS<br>
OF A CONFINED PROCESS STREAM THROUGH A LIGHT-<br>
TRANSMITTING CONDUTT SECTION OF A PROCESS LINE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention generally relates to spectroscopy and, more particularly,<br>
to a non-intrusive device for allowing spectrum analysis of a substance through a<br>
conduit section of a process line of a given processing plant.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
It is known to carry out spectroscopy for monitoring the chemical composition<br>
and physical properties of various solutions used in processing plants, such as<br>
chemical, pharmaceutical, petroleum, semiconductors and food product processing<br>
industries. Typically, such a spectrum analysis is performed by extracting a sample of<br>
the substance to be analyzed from the process line of the processing plant and<br>
carrying out a spectrometric analysis of the collected sample by passing near to far<br>
infrared radiation therethrough.<br>
Instead of the above-mentioned method, it would be preferable to perform the<br>
test on-line directly through a conduit section of the process line, and if the process<br>
line includes a conduit section made of a light-transmitting material directly through<br>
this existing conduit section, to avoid process line modifications.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is therefore an aim of the present invention to provide a light-transmitting<br>
device adapted to be mounted on a processing line externally of a conduit section<br>
thereof for allowing spectrum analysis of a substance circulated through the conduit<br>
section.<br><br>
It is also an aim of the present invention to provide for on-line analysis of a<br>
substance without having to extract a sample of the substance from the process line<br>
through which the substance is circulated.<br>
It is a further aim of the present invention to provide a light-transmitting device<br>
for allowing spectrum analysis of a substance circulated through a process line without<br>
having to modify the process line when the latter includes a conduit section made of a<br>
light-transmitting material.<br>
Therefore, in accordance with the present invention, there is provided a non-<br>
intrusive device for allowing spectrum analysis of a confined process stream through a<br>
light-transmitting conduit section of a process line, comprising a clip adapted to be<br>
externally mounted on the light-transmitting conduit section, said clip being at least<br>
partly made of a light-transmitting material and connectable to a source of light to<br>
direct a beam of light transversally through the conduit section.<br>
The expression spectrum analysis is herein intended to mean the investigation<br>
of substances or bodies by means of their electromagnetic spectra, specifically<br>
chemical composition and physical properties analysis thereof.<br>
The expression light is herein intended to mean all wavelengths included in the<br>
electromagnetic spectrum, including the ultraviolet, visible and infrared portions of the<br>
electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
In accordance with a further general aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a conduit-mounted light-transmitting device for allowing optical analysis of a<br>
substance through a conduit section of a process line, wherein said conduit section is<br>
made of a light-transmitting material, the conduit-mounted light-transmitting device<br>
comprising a clip adapted to be detachably secured about the conduit section, said<br>
clip defining an optical path intersecting the conduit section when said clip is secured<br>
thereabout.<br><br>

embodiment thereof, and in which:<br>

transmitting device in accordance with the present invention is externally mounted for<br>
allowing spectrum analysis of a process stream through the process line tubing;<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention, as will be explained hereinafter, is generally directed to a<br>
light-transmitting device 10 adapted to be removably secured about a process line of a<br>
given processing plant to permit optical analysis of the composition and/or physical<br>
properties of a substance circulated through the process line. More specifically, the<br>
light-transmitting device 10 is adapted to be externally mounted on a conduit section of<br>
an existing process line to direct a light beam (visible, near infrared or infrared) from a<br>
remote light source (not shown), through the conduit section and then carry the light<br>
emerging from the illuminated substance through the conduit section to a light<br>
receiving sensor (not shown), such as a spectrophotometer. It is understood that the<br><br>
conduit section of the process line has to be made of optically transparent or<br>
translucent material such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), other fluorinated<br>
hydrocarbon polymers, and any other light/infrared transmitting material for allowing<br>
the light to pass transversally therethrough. For instance, the conduit section could be<br>
made of Teflon™, glass, polypropylene, polystyrene or other polymers.<br>
As will be seen hereinafter the present invention advantageously allows on-line<br>
control and monitoring of a process stream without having to extract a product sample<br>
from the process line. There is thus no risk of contamination of the process stream.<br>
The present invention is even more advantageous in industrial applications comprising<br>
a process line including light-transmitting conduit sections in that control and<br>
monitoring of the process stream can be performed by simply installing the light-<br>
transmitting device 10 on the process line externally of a light-transmitting conduit<br>
section thereof, that is without having to replace a segment of the process line by a<br>
light-transmitting conduit section, thereby obviating any process interruption. That is to<br>
say that in those applications, the process line does not have to be modified in any<br>
way. One has only to mount the light-transmitting device 10 externally on a light-<br>
transmitting conduit section of the process line.<br>
Fig. 1 exemplifies one possible application of the present invention. More<br>
specifically, Fig. 1 depicts a wet station 12, such as those found in semiconductor<br>
industries. The wet station 12 essentially comprises a re-circulation line 14 composed<br>
of a bath 16, a filter 18, and a pump 20 connected together in a closed circuit via<br>
Teflon™ tubing 22. The bath 16 can contained various solutions, such as cleaning,<br>
stripping or etching solutions.<br>
As seen in Fig. 1, the light-transmitting device 10 is directly installed on a<br>
selected conduit section of the existing process line 14 externally of the Teflon™<br>
tubing 22. The light-transmitting device 10 generally comprises a clip 24 adapted to be<br>
detachably secured on a variety of conduits or tubes having different external<br>
diameters.<br><br>
The clip 24 has a hollow body 26 defining a peripheral open-ended elongated<br>
slot 28 adapted to receive one of a plurality of interchangeable conduit adapters, one<br>
of which is illustrated at 30 in Fig. 3. A different conduit adapter is used for each<br>
diameter of conduit, thereby allowing the body 26 to be mounted on a wide variety of<br>
conduits. The conduit adapter 30 includes a pair of spaced-apart conduit gripping<br>
arms 32 extending perpendicularly from a base wall 33 for tightly grasping a conduit or<br>
tube having an external diameter slightly greater than the spacing between the<br>
gripping arms 32. At least the base wall 33 of the adapter 30 is made of a light-<br>
transmitting material, such as but not limited to PTFE or other fluorinated hydrocarbon<br>
polymers. Once the right adapter has been chosen and fitted over the selected conduit<br>
section of the process line 14, the body 26 is brought over the adapter 30 to locate the<br>
same within the slot 28 in the body 26. The adapter 30 is retained captive in the slot<br>
28 by a cover plate 34. The cover plate 34 is removably secured to the body 26 by<br>
means of screws 36. The cover plate 34 is provided on an undersurface thereof with<br>
an elongated locking rib 38 for engagement between a pair of axially spaced-apart<br>
locking fingers 40 extending laterally outwardly from one of the gripping arms 32 of the<br>
conduit adapter 30 to lock the latter against axial sliding movement in the slot 28.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the body 26 is provided on one side of the slot 28 thereof<br>
with a first connector 41 for receiving the distal end portion of a first fiber optic cable<br>
42. The first fiber optic cable 42 is connected at an opposed proximal end thereof to a<br>
light source (not shown) for directing a light beam, such as but not limited to an<br>
infrared beam (IR beam) or a near infrared beam (NIR beam), transversally through<br>
the conduit section of the Teflon™ tubing 22 of the process line 14. The sidewalls of<br>
the slot 28 can be made of a light-transmitting material for allowing the light beam to<br>
pass therethrough or, alternatively a pair of opposed aligned light-transmitting windows<br>
44 could be formed therein. The windows 44 could be provided in the form of holes.<br>
The light beam is directed so as to perpendicularly intersect the central axis of the<br>
conduit section on which the clip 24 is mounted.<br><br>
According to the illustrated embodiment of the present invention, the light that<br>
emerges from the illuminated process solution through the conduit section of the<br>
Teflon™ tubing 22, the base wall 33 of the conduit adapter 30 and one of the<br>
sidewalls of the slot 28 is diverted 180 degrees by a pair of flat mirrors 46 (see Fig. 4)<br>
before being transmitted to a light receiving sensor via a second fiber optic cable 48<br>
connected at a distal end portion thereof to the body 26 of the clip 24 by a second<br>
connector 50. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the flat mirrors<br>
46 are mounted within the hollow body 26 of the clip 24 by means of an aluminum<br>
frame (not shown). It is noted that a lens could also be provided to focus the<br>
transmitted light into the second fiber optic cable 48 or, alternatively, directly into the<br>
light receiving sensor. Furthermore, it is noted that the second connector 50 could be<br>
disposed on a side of the slot 28 opposite the<br>
first connector and in alignment therewith. In fact, a variety of optical elements could<br>
be integrated within the hollow body 26 of the clip 24 to cause the light to follow<br>
various optical paths between the light source and the light-receiving sensor.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, the hollow body 26 of the<br>
clip 24 is made of Teflon™ to protect the optical elements housed therein from a<br>
corrosive surrounding environment. However, it is understood that the clip 24 could be<br>
made out of a wide variety of materials.<br>
In the case of a tubing 22 made of non optically transparent or translucent<br>
material, a section of such tubing could be replaced once by an appropriate conduit<br>
section, and then the light-transmitting device 10 could be used, when required,<br>
thereon, i.e. without further changes to the tubing of the process line.<br>
As can be appreciated from the foregoing, the present invention allows for on-<br>
line spectrum measurement for determining the chemical composition and/or<br>
properties of a substance through an existing conduit section in which the substance is<br>
circulated.<br><br>
It is easily seen that the present invention as described above has many<br>
advantages that can be summarized as follows: no sample preparation, rapid<br>
installation with no process interruption, totally non-contact, non-intrusive for no<br>
possibility of contamination, etc.<br><br>
