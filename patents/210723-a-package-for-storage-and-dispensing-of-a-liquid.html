SPECIFICATION<br>
SECTION 10<br>
TITLE<br><br>
A PACKAGE FOR STORAGE AND DISPENSING OF A LIQUID.<br><br><br><br>
APPLICANT<br>
MARICO INDUSTRIED LIMITED, AN INDIAN COMPANY OF "RANG SHARDA", K.C. MARG, BANDRA RECLAMATION, BANDRA (WEST), MUMBAI-400 050, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a package for storage and dispensing of a liquid.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Package for storage of liquids are known in the art. Such packages normally consist of bottles made of glass or plastic, though plastic is more commonly used as the material for the bottle. In the instance where a substantial volume of the liquid is to be packed, a bottle does form a convenient package as it possess the required strength properties. However, in the instance when only a small quantity of the liquid is to be packed, to provide a bottle as a packaging means therefore, is inconvenient and, further, costly which contributes to the end cost of the product. Due to such a limitation, small quantities of a liquid could not hitherto be conveniently packed.<br>
Attempts to overcome the above limitation of storing and dispensing liquids in economical and convenient packages, have been made in the known art by using either form-fill-seal technology to produce sachets or horizontal form-fill-seal technology to produce blisters.<br>
The form-fill-seal technology used for producing sachets involves use of 10-12 micro reverse printed crystalline Polyethlene Tetraphthalate film laminated to a blown film with a sealant layer. The sealant layers normally used are the metallocene polymers which provide a large sealing window.<br><br><br>
A limitation of the above packaging is that the sachets so produced can<br>
only reproduce the print of the larger pack but cannot produce the form or the <br>
standability of the bottle.	<br>
Another drawback of the above packaging is that tear-open of the sachets.<br>
is comparatively difficult.	<br>
Further drawback of the above packaging is that storability of the contents of the package, after opening, is not possible.<br>
The Horizontal thermoform-fill-seal technology known in the art to produce small portion packs, uses an unprinted monolayer sheet of polypropylene (PP), high impact polysterene (FOPS), coated PET sheets and PVDC coated PVC sheets which are formed in the shape of a blister and the open end is sealed with a laminate.<br>
The limitation of the above technology is that this technology cannot produce packages with stand-up capability.<br>
Another limitation the above technology is that it cannot replicate the shape of a bottle.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE PfRESENT INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a preformed package in the shape of a bottle for storage and dispensing of liquid in small portions.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a preformed package in the form of a bottle for storage and dispensing of a liquid in small portions having the required strength properties.<br><br><br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a preformed package in the form of a bottle for storage and dispensing of a liquid in small portions, which can be conveniently disposed upon use.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide a preformed package for storage and dispensing of liquid, which has standup capability.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide a preformed packages for storage and dispensing of liquids, which provides easy dispensing and re-ciosing through the breakaway tab.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide a preformed packs for storage and dispensing of small portions of liquids like oil, etc wherein packs could be obtained in strips of any length, facilitating thereby ease of display at retail and dispensing at retails.<br>
At the outset of the description, which follows, it is to be understood that the ensuing description only illustrates a particular form of this invention. However, such a particular form is only an exemplary embodiment and teaching of the invention and is not intended to be taken restrictively.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a package for storage and dispensing of a liquid in small dosed quantities comprising a bottle shaped vessel extending on the vertical sides with lateral flat surfaces, the neck of said bottle having a tearable tab to allow a discharge of the liquid.<br><br><br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBOPIMEMTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention, a package for storage and dispensing of a liquid in small predetermined quantities are disclosed. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, one embodiment comprises an oval shaped vessel (1) standable on the vertical sides with lateral flat surfaces (2).<br>
In an alternative embodiment shown in figures 4, 5 and 6, the package comprises a round shaped vessel (1) standable on the vertical side with round surface (4). The neck of the bottle having a tearable tap (7) )Figure 1,2,4,5), to allow a discharge of a liquid (8) contained in it.<br><br><br>
The package is made of three layers,<br>
a First layer (9) is made of reverse printed laminated Amorphos PAT sheet of 100<br>
to 400 mkrone;<br>
a second  layer (10) comprises 30:70 or 70:30 proportion of LD/LD or HD/LLD<br>
film; and<br>
a third layer (11) is made of 30:70 or 70:30 proportion of LD/LLD Butene for<br>
sealing.<br>
The package is manufactured for a single PAT sheet in a heated Two part Die at 105°C to 115°C by Air flowing at high pressure inorder to form internal cavity and achieve outer surface configuration. A knife edged break way tap (12) is incorporated in the package at the top. The package is filled with the liquid in a vertical condition and then sealed.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PROCESS OF PRODUCING THE PACKAGE ACCORDING TO THE INVENTION<br>
The package is made by heating and forming a plastic sheet laminate made from a reverse printed Amorphous PET (APET) sheet of thickness ranging from 100 microns to 800 microns, preferably 100 to 400 microns, which is laminated, using a commercial adhesive, on to a 45 to 50 micron thick blown film, comprising of UV treated LD/LLD ranging from 20:80 to 80:20, preferably 30:70 to 70:30. In between the two layers, there is a middle layer of either LD/LLD or HD/LLD ranging from 20:80 to 80:20, preferably varying between 30:70 to 70:30. The last sealant layer comprises LD/LLD Butene grade ranging from 20:80 to 80:20, preferably 30:70 to 70:30.<br><br><br>
The thermoformed pack is made from a single roll of film as explained above. The pack is formed without any fin or seal at the bottom thereby enabling the pack to stand up like a bottle. The two halves of the pack are formed simultaneously from one pre-printed laminated sheet.<br>
The pack with both halves are formed simultaneously by folding the sheet, heating it to relevant temperature, sealing the verticle sides and the profiles and thereafter heating the area within the profile prior to forming at temperature of around 105°C. Forming of the pack is achieved by blowing air in to the pack. The pack is filled by making it stand up right on its base exactly like a bottle and a breakaway tab is incorporated into the pack post-sealing with appropriately designed and positioned knife edges. The machine also incorporates a counting and cutting station by which the pack output can be obtained in the form of strips of any number. The machine uses vertical-form-fill and seal technology.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated with an example, which is intended to be an illustrative example and is not intended to be taken restrictively to imply any limitation on the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
 WORKING EXAMPLE<br>
A reverse printed Amorphous Polyethelene Tetraphthalate of 250 micron is laminated to 45 micron thick blown film polyethelene tetraphthelate comprising of Low density/ Linear Low density of ratio 50:50 on lamination sides and a middle layer of 80:20 butene grade Linear Low density.<br>
The laminated sheet material prepared as above was softened by applying heat to attain the required forming temperature. The profile of the pack was sealed and was preheated to around 100°C and forming was achieved by blowing dry air into the pack. Post the pack formed in shape of the container desired, it was filled in upright position. Thereafter, the neck through which the pack was filled, was reduced by applying indirect heat to pourere of required size at temperature around 115°C with 0.75 second dwell time. Then, the pack was sealed by applying contact heat at temperature around 130°C with 1 second dwell time. This was followed by quenching at around 20°C.<br>
The material obtained has excellent and consistent forming. It has seal strength of 3.3 to 3.5 kg/ 15mm a bond strength of 500 kg/ 15mm.<br>
