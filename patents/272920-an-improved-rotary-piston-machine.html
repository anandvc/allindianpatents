				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to rotary piston machines. It<br>
is concerned with an adaptation of the Stirling principle,<br>
with multi-sided rotary pistons operating in chambers with<br>
epitrochoidal lobes, the working fluid or vapour undergoing<br>
closed thermodynamic cyclic processes. The machine may<br>
operate as an engine or as a heat pump.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a<br>
fluid or vapour rotary piston machine including two<br>
variable-volume units, each unit having a rotary multi-lobed<br>
epitrochoidal chamber and a multi-sided rotary piston<br>
therein forming a plurality of invididual sub-chambers by<br>
its co-operation with the periphery of the associated<br>
chamber, the number (n+l) of piston sides being greater by<br>
one than the number (n) of epitroichoid arcs, wherein the<br>
two chambers are constrained to rotate at a first common<br>
speed about a first effective common axis while the two<br>
pistons are constrained to rotate at a second common speed<br>
about a second effective common axis, the ratio of first to<br>
second common speeds being n+l:n, wherein each chamber has<br>
a plurality (n) of dual-function ports enabling connection<br>
between the chambers via ducts, and wherein said ducts each<br>
contain a regenerator, enabling one variable-volume unit to<br>
perform intake, expansion and exhaust, while the other unit<br>
performs intake, compression and exhaust, as a result of the<br>
relative rotation and port positions.<br>
Preferably, the chambers will be co-axial, as will be<br>
the rotors. That simplifies construction. But they could,<br>
 <br>
in theory, be on different axes but coupled tc rotate in<br>
liaison. The term "effective" is intended to cover this<br>
alternative.<br>
Heating means may be provided for the variable-volume<br>
unit which performs the expansion processes, and there could<br>
be further heating means between each said regenerator and<br>
the variable-volume unit which performs the expansion<br>
processes.<br>
Cooling means may also be provided for the variable-<br>
volume unit which performs the compression processes, and<br>
there could be further cooling means between each said<br>
regenerator and the variable-volume unit which performs the<br>
. compression processes.<br>
In the preferred form n=2, so that there are three<br>
sided pistons operating in double-lobed chambers.<br>
The expansion unit which may, but not necessarily, be<br>
heated, will have its ports disposed in such a way that the<br>
chambers formed therein are increasing in volume generally<br>
when not in communication with a port and decreasing in<br>
volume generally. when said chambers are in communication<br>
with a port. The other, compression unit which may, but not<br>
necessarily, be cooled, will have its ports disposed in such<br>
a way that the chambers formed therein are decreasing in<br>
volume generally when not in communication with a port, and<br>
increasing in volume generally when said chambers are in<br>
communication with a port. Work processes thus occur in<br>
chambers isolated from port openings, while the transfer of<br>
working fluid or vapour occurs between a pair of chambers<br>
 <br>
each in communication with ports opening to a common duct.<br>
If high-grade heat transfer is accomplished to the working<br>
fluid or vapour flowing to, from or contained within, the<br>
expansion unit, while low-grade heat transfer is<br>
accomplished from the working fluid or vapour flowing to,<br>
from, or contained within, the compression unit, the machine<br>
behaves as an engine, with mechanical work output. If<br>
mechanical work is applied to the rotating components, but<br>
low-grade heat transfer is accomplished to the region of the<br>
expansion unit while high-grade heat transfer occurs from<br>
the region of the compression unit, the machine behaves as<br>
a heat pump or refrigerating machine.<br>
For a better understanding of the invention, reference<br>
will now be made by way of example, to the accompanying<br>
drawings, in which:<br>
Figures 1, 2, 3,4 and 5 are schematic diagrams showing<br>
the relative positions of expansion and compression units of<br>
a rotary piston machine at intervals during a cycle of<br>
rotation, and<br>
Figure 6 is a diagrammatic cross-section through a<br>
preferred embodiment of the machine.<br>
An expansion unit 1 has a rotary piston 2 contained in<br>
a chamber 3 and a compression unit 4 has a rotary piston 5<br>
contained in a chamber 6. Each piston 2 and 5 is of flat,<br>
generally equilateral triangular form, but with the sides of<br>
the triangle convex and arcuate. Each chamber 3 and 6 is<br>
also flat, closely to confine the faces of the piston, and<br>
is of two-lobed epitrochoidal form. The chambers thus have<br>
 <br>
major and minor axes intersecting at right angles at their<br>
centres. The two units 1 and 4 are rigidly linked to rotate<br>
about a common axis through their centres in the same<br>
direction and at the same speed, the major axes of the<br>
chambers 3 and 6 being at 90° to each other. The two rotary<br>
pistons 2 and 5 are also rigidly linked to rotate about a<br>
common axis through their centres in the same direction and<br>
at the same speed, this being two thirds the speed of<br>
rotation of the chambers 3 and 6. The arcuate sides 2a, 2b<br>
and 2c of the piston 2 are disposed at 180° to the<br>
counterpart sides 5a, 5b and 5c of the other piston 5. The<br>
sides of the pistons 2 and 5 co-operate with the profiles of<br>
the respective chambers 3 and 6 to form sub-chambers 3a, 3b<br>
and 3c and 6a, 6b and 6c, of variable volume and shape in<br>
operation, as described below.<br>
Ports 7 and 8 in the expansion unit 1 are diagonally<br>
opposite each other and offset 30° in the direction of<br>
motion (clockwise as seen in Figures .1 to 5) from the minor<br>
axis of the chamber 3. Corresponding ports 9 and 10 are<br>
similarly disposed in the compression unit 4, but are offset<br>
by 30° in the direction opposite that of rotation from the<br>
minor axis of the chamber 6. This positioning ensures that<br>
during operation a port, 7 or 8, is about to open to a sub-<br>
chamber when that sub-chamber is at maximum volume in the<br>
expansion unit 1. Similarly, a port, 9 or .10, has just<br>
closed to a sub-chamber when that sub-chamber is at maximum<br>
volume in the compression unit 4. The expansion unit port 7<br>
is linked by an interconnecting duct 11 to the compression<br>
 <br>
port 9 diagonally opposite with reference to the axis of<br>
rotation of the units 1 and 4, while the expansion unit port<br>
8 is similarly linked by an interconnecting duct 12 to the<br>
compression unit port 10. These ducts each contain a<br>
regenerator (not shown).<br>
The sequence of operation is as follows.-<br>
In Figure 1, heated working fluid or vapour occupies<br>
the sub-chamber 3a, which is at minimum volume and is open,<br>
via the port 8, to the duct 12. The sub-chamber 3b is<br>
isolated and increasing in volume. The sub-chamber 3c is<br>
decreasing in volume, thereby expelling working fluid or<br>
vapour via the port 7, through the duct 11. The fluid or<br>
vapour is giving up, in the case of an engine, or taking up,<br>
in the case of a heat pump, heat within the regenerator in<br>
that duct 11. Cooled working fluid or vapour occupies the<br>
chamber 6a which is at maximum volume, isolated, and about<br>
to start its compression cycle. The sub-chamber 6b is in<br>
its compression cycle, is decreasing in volume and isolated.<br>
The sub-chamber 6c is increasing in volume and is open, via<br>
the port 9, to the duct 11. It is therefore receiving the<br>
working fluid or vapour from the sub-chamber 3c. The port 10<br>
is closed by the piston 5.<br>
In Figure 2 the pistons 2 and 5 have rotated clockwise<br>
by 30° and the chambers 3 and 6 by 45°. The sub-chamber 3a<br>
is increasing in volume and accepting working fluid or<br>
vapour, via the port 8, from the duct 12 and from the sub-<br>
chamber 6b, which continues to decrease in volume and now<br>
communicates with the port 10. The sub-chamber 3b continues<br>
 <br>
to increase in volume, with the isolated heated working<br>
fluid or vapour therein being expanded, while the transfer<br>
of working fluid or vapour continues from the sub-chamber 3c<br>
to the sub-chamber 6c via the port 7, the duct 11, and the<br>
port 9. The cooled working fluid or vapour in the sub-<br>
chamber 6a remains isolated and is compressed as the volume<br>
of that -sub-chamber decreases.<br>
In Figure 3 the pistons have rotated through 60° from<br>
their initial, positions and the chambers by 90°. The sub-<br>
chamber 3a continues to increase in. volume, but the piston<br>
2 closes the port 8, thereby terminating the ingress of<br>
working fluid or vapour, whereupon the expansion process<br>
commences within that sub-chamber. The sub-chamber 3b has<br>
attained its maximum volume, and the heated working fluid<br>
therein has reached the end of its expansion process, while<br>
the sub-chamber 3c continues to decrease in volume with the<br>
egress of working fluid or vapour, via the port 7, the duct<br>
11 and the port 9 to the compression unit 4. The cooled<br>
working fluid continues to be compressed in the isolated<br>
sub-chamber 6a as the volume therein decreases. The sub-<br>
chamber 6b is at minimum volume and open, via the port 10,<br>
to the duct 12, but the working fluid or vapour ceases to<br>
flow due to the closure of the port 8. The sub-chamber 6c<br>
continues to increase in volume and to accept the working<br>
fluid or vapour, via the port 9, from the sub-chamber 3c.<br>
In Figure 4 the pistons 2 and 5 have moved on another<br>
30° and the chambers 3 and 6 another 45°. The sub-chamber<br>
3a is isolated and increasing in volume, with the heated<br>
 <br>
working fluid therein continuing its expansion process. The<br>
sub-chamber 3b now communicates with the port 8 as that is<br>
uncovered by the piston 2 and, since that sub-chamber is<br>
decreasing in volume, the working fluid or vapour therein is<br>
forced out into the duct 12. The sub-chamber 3c continues to<br>
decrease in volume, and transfer of working fluid or vapour,<br>
via the port 7, the duct 11 and the port 9, continues to the<br>
compression unit 4. The sub-chamber 6a remains isolated and<br>
decreasing in volume, with the cooled working fluid or<br>
vapour therein continuing its compression process. The sub-<br>
chamber 6b is now increasing in volume and, due to its<br>
communication with the port 10, accepts the working fluid or<br>
vapour from the sub-chamber 3b via the duct 12. The sub-<br>
chamber 6c continues to increase in volume and the ingress<br>
of working fluid or vapour continues, via the port 9 and the<br>
duct 11, from the expansion unit 1.<br>
In Figure 5 the pistons are 120° from their original<br>
positions and the . chambers 180° from theirs. The sub-<br>
chamber 3a continues to increase in volume, with the heated,<br>
isolated working fluid therein continuing its expansion<br>
process. The sub-chamber 3b continues to decrease in volume,<br>
with its working fluid or vapour passing via the port 8, the<br>
duct 12, and the port 10 to the sub-chamber 6b which is<br>
increasing in volume. The sub-chamber 3c is at minimum<br>
volume and open, via port 7, to the duct 11, but the<br>
compression unit piston 5 has closed the port 9, and so the<br>
working fluid or vapour ceases to flow. The sub-chamber 6a<br>
is still isolated and decreasing in volume, with the cooled<br>
 <br>
working fluid therein at the end of its compression process.<br>
The sub-chamber 6b continues to accept the transferred<br>
working fluid or vapour from the expansion unit 1. The sub-<br>
chamber 6c, now isolated due to the closure of the port 9,<br>
is at maximum volume with the working fluid or vapour<br>
therein at the commencement of its compression process. The<br>
situation within the machine is now similar to that of<br>
Figure 1, although the various bodies of working fluid or<br>
vapour occupy different spaces to those in the earlier<br>
diagram.<br>
Consider the body of cooled working fluid in the sub-<br>
chamber 6a in Figure 1 at the commencement of its<br>
compression process. As the units 1 and 4 rotate through<br>
180° and the rotary pistons 2 and 5 rotate through 120°, the<br>
relative rotor rotation will be 60° in the opposite<br>
direction-. This finds the body of fluid in sub-chamber '6a<br>
at the end of its compression process in a similar situation<br>
to that of the cooled working fluid or vapour in the sub-<br>
chamber 6b in Figure 1. After a further 30° of relative<br>
rotor rotation (corresponding to the Figure 3 positions) the<br>
sub-chamber 6 a will be at minimum volume, and the major<br>
proportion of the working fluid or vapour that was therein<br>
will have transferred to the sub-chamber 3c via the port 9,<br>
the ducts 11 and the port 7, absorbing; in the case of an<br>
engine, or rejecting, in the case of a heat pump, heat<br>
during its passage through duct 11. At this point, where .<br>
the total relative rotor rotation is 90°, the piston 2 will<br>
have passed the port 7. The expander sub-chamber 3c allows<br>
 <br>
expansion of the heated working fluid or vapour therein<br>
until a further 60° of relative rotor rotation has occurred<br>
(making the total 150°), when the sub-chamber 3c is at<br>
maximum volume. Further rotation uncovers the port 8,<br>
allowing egress of heated working fluid or vapour via the<br>
duct 12, in which it is cooled in the case of an engine, or<br>
heated in the case of a heat pump. It then enters the sub<br>
chamber 6c via the port 10, this transfer process occurring<br>
over a further 90° of relative rotor rotation, the total<br>
then being 240°, when the sub-chamber 3c will be at minimum<br>
volume. The piston 5 now covers port 10 and the<br>
thermodynamic cycle involving this particular body of<br>
working fluid or vapour is repeated.<br>
The processes may be tabulated over 360° of relative<br>
rotor rotation, corresponding to 720° of piston rotation and<br>
1080° of chamber rotation, as set out below in Table 1.<br>
The closed thermodynamic cycle described above occurs<br>
and repeats, with phase displacement, with four main bodies<br>
of working fluid or vapour. In Figure 1, these are located<br>
in sub-chamber 6a at the commencement of compression, in<br>
sub-chamber 6b towards the end of compression, in sub-<br>
chambers 3c and 6c and duct 11 undergoing regenerative<br>
transfer, and in sub-chamber 3b undergoing expansion. The<br>
residual working fluid or vapour in sub-chamber 3a is<br>
awaiting mixing with the main body of working fluid or<br>
vapour in the sub-chamber 6b. It will be noted that work<br>
processes in both the expansion and compression units are of<br>
equal duration, namely 60° of relative rotor rotation.<br>
 <br>
Working fluid or vapour regenerative transfer from the<br>
compression unit 4 to the expansion unit 1 is always to a<br>
sub-chamber of dissimilar designation, that is, 6a to 3c, 6b<br>
to 3a and 6c to 3b, and is of short duration, namely 30° of<br>
relative rotor rotation. Working fluid or vapour<br>
regeneration transfer from the expansion ' unit 1 to the<br>
compression unit 4 is always to a sub-chamber of similar<br>
designation, that is, 3a to 6a, 3b to 6b and 3c to 6c, and<br>
is of long duration, namely 90° of relative rotor rotation.<br>
If the units 1 and 4 are of equal size, which is not a<br>
necessity, the geometry ensures that this latter transfer<br>
occurs under constant summed volume.<br>
The regenerative transfer of any one main body of<br>
working fluid or vapour is always accomplished alternately<br>
between the two ducts 11 and 12. That is, transfer from one<br>
unit to the other via one duct is always followed, by the<br>
return transfer via the other duct. Because of the pairings<br>
of sub-chambers during those transfers, any one main body of<br>
working fluid or vapour will eventually be transported<br>
through every sub-chamber within the machine, allowing mass<br>
and energy balances of the working fluid or vapour to be<br>
attained rapidly.<br>
The route followed by one main body of working fluid or<br>
vapour may be. tabulated over 720° of relative rotor<br>
rotation, corresponding to 1440° of piston rotation and<br>
2160° of housing rotation, as shown below in Table 2. The<br>
main body of working fluid or vapour under study in that<br>
table is that which appears in sub-chamber Sa in Figure 1,<br>
 <br>
at the start of its compression process. It can be seen to<br>
undergo three complete thermodynamic cycles before it<br>
returns to that sub-chamber 6a, after passing through all<br>
the other sub-chambers of the machine. A second main body of<br>
working fluid or vapour which appears in sub-chamber 6b in<br>
Figure 1, undergoing its expansion process, will follow an<br>
identical route to that shown in Table 2, with a phase<br>
displacement of +360° relative rotor rotation from that<br>
shown in Table 2. A third main body of working fluid or<br>
vapour which appears in sub-chamber 6b in Figure 1, towards<br>
the end of its compression process, will follow a similar<br>
route, but with the ducts interchanged so that expansion<br>
unit to the compression unit transfers are made via the duct<br>
11 whilst the reverse transfers are made via the duct 12,<br>
with a phase displacement of +180° relative rotor rotation<br>
from that shown in Table 2. The fourth main body of working<br>
fluid or vapour which appears in sub-chambers 3c and 6c and<br>
duct 11 in Figure 1, undergoing regenerative transfer to the<br>
compression unit, will follow an identical route to that of<br>
the third main body of fluid or vapour, with a phase<br>
displacement of -180° relative rotor rotation from that<br>
shown in Table 2 . The machine therefore provides for a total<br>
of twelve thermodynamic cycles over the period defined by<br>
1440° of piston rotation, corresponding to 2160° of chamber<br>
rotation and 720° of relative rotor rotation.<br>
It.should be noted that each individual thermodynamic<br>
cycle occurs over a period defined by 24 0° of relative rotor<br>
rotation, that is, 480° of piston rotation and 720° of<br>
 <br>
chamber rotation. Whichever component, whether the coupled<br>
pistons 2 and 5 or the coupled units 1 and 4 is employed as<br>
the engine work output medium or . heat pump work, input<br>
medium, the thermodynamic cycles have a longer duration than<br>
those occurring in conventional reciprocating heat engines<br>
and reciprocating heat pumps. These must, perforce, occur<br>
over 360° of the output, or input, shaft rotation. This<br>
feature of the rotary machine described above allows<br>
enhanced heat transfer processes, enabling the theoretically<br>
ideal thermodynamic cycle to be approached.<br>
In Figure 6, the two units 1 and 4 are rigidly coupled<br>
by a hollow shaft 13 journalled at 14 and 15 in a fixed<br>
mounting 16. The pistons 2 and 5 are carried by a common<br>
shaft 17 journalled at 18 and 19 in the mounting 16. The<br>
ports 7, 8, 9 and 10 are in the flat radial sides of the<br>
chambers 3 and 6, near their peripheries, and are open and<br>
closed by the flat faces of the pistons 2 and 5. A gear<br>
coupling 20 between the shafts 13 and 17 ensure that the<br>
units 1 and 4 rotate relatively to the pistons 2 and 5 in<br>
the manner described.<br>
The units 1 and 4 can be encapsulated or shrouded to<br>
distinct upper and lower temperature regions around them,<br>
each unit presenting a large surface area for efficient heat<br>
transfer. The rotation of those units promotes near-uniform<br>
temperature distribution.<br>
In addition to maintaining a temperature differential<br>
between the units 1 and 4, there can be additional heating<br>
and cooling means for the ducts 11 and 12 provided, for<br>
 <br>
example, by adaptation of the encapsulation or shrouding to<br>
enclose the ends of the ducts. Any further heating means<br>
will be between the regenerators and the unit 1, while any<br>
further cooling means will be between the regenerators and<br>
the unit 4.<br>
Figure 6 . shows the two rotatable structures isolated,<br>
for simplicity. There will of course be a connection to one<br>
or the other in order to get work out, in the case of an<br>
engine, or to put work in, in the case of a pump. The<br>
shafts 13 and 17 can be suitably adapted.<br>
It will be understood that while a simple embodiment<br>
with three-sided pistons operating in two-lobed chambers has<br>
been described, there could be more elaborate arrangements<br>
with n+l(n&gt;2) sided pistons in n-lobed chambers connected by<br>
a corresponding number of ducts with regenerators. The<br>
relative speeds of rotation of the chambers to the pistons<br>
will be n+1:n.<br>

WE CLAIM<br>
1.	An improved rotary piston machine comprising two variable- volume units<br>
(1,4) each unit (1,4) having a rotary multi-lobed epitrochoidal chamber<br>
(3,6) and a multi-sided rotary piston (2,5) forming therein a plurality of<br>
individual sub-chambers (3a, 3b,3c,6a,6b,6c) by its co-operation with the<br>
periphery of an associated chamber, the number (n + 1) of piston sides<br>
being greater by one than the number (n) of epitrochoid ares, wherein the<br>
two chambers (3,6) are constrained to rotate at a first common speed<br>
about a first effective common axis through their centers while the two<br>
pistons (2,5) are constrained to rotate at a second common speed about a<br>
second effective common axis through their centers in a same direction,<br>
the ratio of first to second common speeds being n+l:n, wherein each<br>
chamber (2,5) has a plurality (n) of dual-function ports (7,8,9,10)<br>
enabling connection between the chambers (2,5) via ducts (10,11) and<br>
wherein said ducts (10,11) each contain a regenerators, enabling one<br>
variable-volume unit (1) to perform intake, expansion and exhaust, while<br>
the other unit (4) performs intake, compression and exhaust, as a result<br>
of the relative rotation and port positions.<br>
2.	The rotary piston machine as claimed in claim 1, wherein heating means<br>
are provided for the variable-volume unit (1) which performs the<br>
expansion processes.<br>
3.	The rotary piston machine as claimed in claim 2, wherein heating means<br>
are provided between each said regenerator and the variable-volume unit<br>
which performs the expansion processes.<br>
 <br>
4.	The rotary piston machine as claimed in claim 1,2 or 3, wherein cooling<br>
means are provided for the variable volume unit (4) which performs the<br>
compression processes.<br>
5.	The rotary piston machine as claimed in claim 4, wherein cooling means<br>
are provided between each said regerator and the variable volume unit<br>
(4) which performs the compression processes.<br>
6.	The rotary piston machine as claimed in any preceding claim 1, wherein<br>
n=2.<br>
7.	The rotary piston machine substantially as hereinbefore described with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
