				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Flame Retardant Polymer Composition comprising Polyolefin<br>
with high Molecular Weight Distribution<br>
The present invention relates to a flame retardant polymer composition, to<br>
an article, in particular a wire or cable, comprising said flame retardant<br>
polymer composition, and to the use of said composition for the production<br>
of a layer of a wire or cable.<br>
For improving the flame retardancy of polymers, several approaches are<br>
known in the art. First, it is known to include compounds containing<br>
halides into the polymer. However, these materials have the disadvantage<br>
that upon burning hazardous and corrosives gases like hydrogen halides are<br>
deliberated. This is also a disadvantage of flame retardant polymer<br>
composition based on PVC.<br>
In a further approach, flame retardant compositions include relatively large<br>
amounts, typically 50 to 60 wt.%, of inorganic fillers such as e.g. hydrated<br>
and hydroxy compounds, which during burning decompose endo-<br>
thermically and deliberate inert gases at temperatures in the range of 200 to<br>
600°C. Such inorganic fillers e.g. include Al(OH)3 and Mg(OH)2.<br>
However, these flame retardant materials suffer from the high costs of the<br>
inorganic fillers and the deterioration of the processability and mechanical<br>
properties of the polymer composition due to the high amount of filler.<br>
A third approach as disclosed in EP 0 393 959 uses a silicon fluid or gum<br>
in a composition together with an organic polymer comprising an ethylene<br>
acrylate or acetate copolymer, and an inorganic filler. Although such a<br>
composition has good flame retardant properties, the processability of the<br>
composition may still be improved because often melt fracture occurs when<br><br>
the composition is extruded as a cable layer. Furthermore, the surface<br>
quality of extruded cable layers often is insufficient and may also be<br>
further improved.<br>
It is thus an object of the present invention to avoid the disadvantages of<br>
the prior art materials and to provide a flame retardant polymer<br>
composition which shows a combination of good flame retardancy, good<br>
processability, such as extrudability, and good mechanical properties, such<br>
as improved surface quality.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that the processability and<br>
surface quality of a polymer composition comprising an organic polymer, a<br>
silicone group containing compound and an inorganic filler material can be<br>
improved if it comprises a polyolefin, i.e. an olefin homo- or copolymer,<br>
with a high molecular weight distribution, usually above 20.<br>
The invention therefore provides a flame retardant polymer composition<br>
which comprises<br>
(A)	a polyolefin comprising a polyolefin with a molecular<br>
weight distribution Mw/Mn &gt; 20,<br>
(B)	a silicone-group containing compound, and<br>
(C)	an inorganic filler material.<br>
The composition of the invention shows improved processability as can be<br>
seen by an improved extrusion behaviour when the composition is extruded<br>
as a layer of a wire or cable. Furthermore, the extruded layers have<br>
good/improved surface quality.<br>
Preferably, the composition is free of halogen- and phosphorous-containing<br>
compounds as flame retardancy aids, i.e. such compounds, if at all, are<br>
present in the composition in an amount of below 3000 ppm.<br><br>
More preferably, the composition is entirely free of halogen-containing<br>
compounds. However, especially phosphorous containing-compounds may<br>
be present in the composition as stabilizers, usually in an amount of below<br>
2000 ppm, more preferably below 1000 ppm.<br>
In the composition, components (A) to (C), and optional component (D) as<br>

Although inorganic filler (C) preferably is not a hydroxide or hydrated<br>

Furthermore, although filler (C) is not a hydrated compound, it may contain<br>

component (C) is completely free of hydroxide and/or water.<br>
Preferably, component (C) of the inventive flame retardant polymer<br>

The inorganic filler may comprise a filler which has been surface-treated<br>

In a preferred embodiment of the composition of the invention, the<br>
composition further comprises<br><br>
(D) a polypropylene in an amount of 0.1 to 10 wt.% with<br>
respect to the total composition.<br>
Preferably, the amount of polypropylene (D) is 0.2 wt.% or more, more<br>
preferably is 0.3 wt.% or more, and most preferably is 0.5 wt.% or more of<br>
the total composition.<br>
Furthermore, preferably the amount of polypropylene (D) is 8 wt.% or less,<br>
more preferably is 4 wt.% or less, and most preferably is 3 wt.% or less of<br>
the total composition.<br>
Still further, preferably polypropylene (D) has a MFR2 measured according<br>
to ISO 1133 at 230 °C and 2.16 kg of 0.1 to 15 g/10 min, more preferably<br>
of 0.5 to 10g/10min.<br>
Polypropylene (D) preferably has a tensile modulus measured according to<br>
ISO 527-2 of 800 to 2000 MPa, more preferably of 900 to 1600 MPa.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, polypropylene (D) is a propylene heterophasic<br>
copolymer comprising a polypropylene homo- or copolymer as matrix<br>
polymer and an incorporated ethylene-propylene-rubber.<br>
The heterophasic propylene copolymer may be produced by multistage<br>
process polymerisation of propylene and ethylene and optionally alpha-<br>
olefin such as bulk polymerisation, gas phase polymerisation, slurry<br>
polymerisation, solution polymerisation or combinations thereof using<br>
conventional catalysts. The heterophasic copolymer can be made either in<br>
loop reactors or in a combination of loop and gas phase reactor Those<br>
processes are well known to one skilled in the art.<br>
A preferred process is a combination of a bulk slurry loop reactor(s) and<br>
gas phase reactor(s). First, the propylene homo- or copolymer matrix is<br><br>
made either in loop reactor(s) or in a combination of loop and gas phase<br>
reactor.<br>
The polymer produced in this way is transferred into another reactor and<br>
the disperse phase, the ethylene-propylene-rubber, is produced by<br>
copolymerising a mixture of ethylene and propylene with the same catalyst<br>
system, so obtaining a heterophasic system consisting of a semicrystalline<br>
matrix with a nearly amorphous elastomeric component dispersed within it.<br>
Preferably this polymerisation step is done in a gas phase polymerisation.<br>
A suitable catalyst for the polymerisation of the heterophasic copolymer is<br>
any stereospecific catalyst for propylene polymerisation which is capable<br>
of polymerising and copolymerising propylene and comonomers at a<br>
temperature of 40 to 110 °C and at a pressure from 10 to 100 bar. Ziegler-<br>
Natta catalysts as well as metallocene catalysts are suitable catalysts.<br>
Alternatively to producing the heterophasic copolymer in a sequential<br>
multistage process as described above, it can be produced by polymerising<br>
the matrix polymer and the ethylene-propylene-rubber in separate steps and<br>
melt blending the two polymers.<br>
"Rubber" and "elastomeric copolymer" are in this context used as<br>
synonyms.<br>
An ethylene propylene elastomeric copolymer may be produced by known<br>
polymerisation processes such as solution, suspension and gas-phase<br>
polymerisation using conventional catalysts. Ziegler-Natta catalysts as well<br>
as metallocene catalysts are suitable catalysts.<br>
A widely used process is the solution polymerisation. Ethylene, propylene<br>
and catalyst systems are polymerised in an excess of hydrocarbon solvent.<br>
Stabilisers and oils, if used, are added directly after polymerisation The<br><br>
solvent and unreacted monomers are then flashed off with hot water or<br>
steam, or with mechanical devolatilisation. The polymer, which is in crumb<br>
form, is dried with dewatering in screens, mechanical presses or drying<br>
ovens. The crumb is formed into wrapped bales or extruded into pellets.<br>
The suspension polymerisation process is a modification of bulk<br>
polymerisation. The monomers and catalyst system are injected into the<br>
reactor filled with propylene. The polymerisation takes place immediately,<br>
forming crumbs of polymer that are not soluble in the propylene. Flashing<br>
off the propylene and comonomer completes the polymerisation process.<br>
The gas-phase polymerisation technology consists of one or more vertical<br>
fluidised beds. Monomers and nitrogen in gas form along with catalyst are<br>
fed to the reactor and solid product is removed periodically. Heat of<br>
reaction is removed through the use of the circulating gas that also serves<br>
to fluidise the polymer bed. Solvents are not used, thereby eliminating the<br>
need for solvent stripping, washing and drying.<br>
The production of ethylene propylene elastomeric copolymers is also<br>
described in detail in e.g. US 3,300,459, US 5,919,877, EP 0 060 090 A1<br>
and in a company publication by EniChem "DUTRAL, Ethylene-Propylene<br>
Elastomers" , pages 1-4 (1991).<br>
Alternatively, elastomeric ethylene-propylene copolymers, which are<br>
commercially available and which fulfill the indicated requirements, can be<br>
used.<br>
The heterophasic copolymer is then produced by combining the matrix<br>
polymer in the form of powder or granules and the elastomeric copolymer<br>
in a melt mixing device.<br><br>
In case a polypropylene random copolymer is used as matrix polymer for<br>
the heterophasic copolymer, the comonomers preferably are linear alpha-<br>
olefins or branched alpha-olefins like ethylene, butene, hexene etc. In the<br>
present invention ethylene is most preferred.<br>
The comonomer content is preferably equal to or below 10 wt.-%, more<br>
preferably between 4 and 8 wt%, based on the total polypropylene random<br>
copolymer.<br>
However, preferably the matrix polymer is a polypropylene homopolymer.<br>
Furthermore, the heterophasic copolymer contains an ethylene-propylene-<br>
rubber preferably in a content of equal to or below 35 wt%, more<br>
preferably from 10 to 20 wt%, based on the total weight of polymer (D).<br>
The ethylene-propylene-rubber preferably has a propylene content of 40 to<br>
80 wt.%, more preferably of from 45 to 60 wt.%, based on the total amount<br>
of the ethylene-propylene-rubber.<br>
The ethylene-propylene rubber apart from ethylene and propylene monomer<br>
units may contain further alpha-olefin monomer units. However, it is<br>
preferred that the ethylene-propylene rubber consists of ethylene and<br>
propylene monomer units.<br>
The composition according to the present invention may be cross-linkable.<br>
It is well known to cross-link thermoplastic polymer compositions using<br>
irradiation or cross-linking agents such as organic peroxides and thus the<br>
compositions according to the present invention may contain a cross-<br>

The pressure used for extrusion preferably is 50 to 500 bar.<br>
In the following the present invention is further illustrated by means of<br>
examples.<br>
Examples<br>
1. Measurement methods<br>
a)	Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy<br>
The improved surface smoothness and reduced melt fracture has been<br>
evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Leica TCS-SP.<br>
The investigation area was 500 x 500 micrometer, and the wavelength of<br>
the laser-beam was 488 nm. As the lens, a HC PL APO 20 x/0.70 was used,<br>
and the resolution in xy-direction was 279 nm, and in xz-direction 768 nm.<br>
The step size in the tests was 486 nm.<br>
The resolution of the z-Table was 40 nm, the z-standard (for function<br>
control and validation) was from Rommelwerke with Rmax of 0.97 micron.<br>
b)	Melt Flow Rate<br>
The melt flow rate MFR2 was measured in accordance with ISO 1133 at<br>
190°C and a load of 2.16 kg for polyethylene and at 230 °C and a load of<br>
2.16 kg for polypropylene.<br><br>
c)	Tensile Modulus<br>
Tensile modulus was determined according to IS0527-2.<br>
d)	Molecular weight distribution and long chain branching<br>
The following procedure is used to determine g'. This procedure should be<br>
followed when determining the branching parameter g' in accordance with<br>
the present invention.<br>
Gel Permeation Chromatography is used for determination of molecular<br>
weight (M), molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn), intrinsic viscosity [r|]<br>
and contents of long chain branching (LCB) g'.<br>
Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC), which is also known as Size<br>
Exclusion Chromatography (SEC), is an analytical technique where the<br>
molecules are separated after their size. Large molecules elutes first and the<br>
smaller ones later.<br>
Molecules elute after decreasing hydrodynamic volume Vh. This can be<br>
described as a product of the molecules molecular weight (M) and its<br>
intrinsic viscosity [n].<br>
The principal of universal calibration in GPC states that for given sets of<br>
solvent and temperature conditions in which a polymer sample is separated<br>
by pure size mechanism (no adsorption or other effects), the logarithm of<br>
the hydrodynamic volume of a polymer molecule as a function of its<br>
elution volume (or time) is identical for all polymers, linear or branched.<br>
See the equation:<br><br><br>
The hydrodynamic volume is defined as a product of intrinsic viscosity [n]<br>
and molecular weight M.<br>
Universal calibration is independent of the polymer type and possible<br>
branched polymers.<br>
A serial of small standard is used to find the relation between retention<br>
time and molecular weight.<br>
Mark-Houwink-Sakurade equation relates a polymer intrinsic viscosity to<br>
its viscosity average molecular weight Mv.<br>
[η] = K x Mav<br>
[Η] is the intrinsic viscosity.<br>
Mv is the viscosity average molecular weight.<br>
K and a are Mark-Houwink constants. These constants are dependent of the<br>
polymer type, solution and the temperature.<br>
By taking the logarithm on both sides of the equation we will get:<br>
log[η] = logK + a x logMv<br>
A plot of log [Η] versus log [Mv] (narrow standards) gives slope and the<br>
intercept K.<br>
If K and a are known for both standards and samples, the molecular<br>
weights can be decided by mean of the relation to their respective<br>
constants.<br>
GPC uses a Universal Calibration for quantitative evaluation of the<br>
molecular weight distribution.<br><br>
The calibration is based on narrow standards to calculate a universal<br>
calibration curve. The retention time for each standard (the RI peak) is<br>
calculated. These values, together with the appurtenant molecular weight<br>
are used to make a universal calibration curve.<br>
The software is able to produce a plot of Log Viscosity versus Log<br>
Molecular Weight for both the RI- and the viscosity-detector. Each detector<br>
produces a universal calibration for each fraction within the polymer<br>
chromatogram.<br>
A universal calibration gives genuine molecular weight results.<br>
The software can decide K and a for the standards.<br>
The following values are recommended to be used.<br>
PS: K= 9.95*10-5	a = 0.725<br>
PE: K = 3.92*10-4	a = 0.725<br>
The equipment used was a Waters 150CVplus Gel Permeation<br>
Chromatograph no. W-4412 (cf. Waters 150CVplus Viscometer<br>
Supplement) having a differential Refractive Index (dRI) detector and a<br>
single capillary viscometer detector, and three HT6E Styragel (porous<br>
styrenedivinylbenzene) columns from Waters. Calibration was made with<br>
narrow molecular weight distribution polystyrene standards with different<br>
molecular weights (al116_05002). The mobile phase was 1,2,4-<br>
trichlorobenzene (purity 98.5 %) with 0.25 g/1 BHT, 2-tert-butyl-4-<br>
methylphenol added as an antioxidant. Millennium32 Version 4 software<br>
from Waters was used for calculation of g' (LCB).<br>
Viscosity Low Plots are determined for the polystyrene standards which<br>
have no long chain branching and therefore represent linear (unbranched)<br><br>
polymers, and for the branched polyethylene composition of the invention.<br>
The branching parameter is thereafter calculated from the equation:<br><br>
where [η]branched is the intrinsic viscosity of the branched polymer in<br>
question and [η]linear is the intrinsic viscosity of an linear (unbranched)<br>
standard polymer.<br>
e) Shear Thinning Index<br>
The shear thinning index SHI(eta0.05/eta300) was determined by dynamic<br>
rheology in a plate/plate rheometer.<br>
This property can be measured as a ratio of the viscosity at two different<br>
shear stresses. In the present invention the shear stresses (or G*) at 0.05<br>
kPa and 300 kPa are used for calculating the SHISHI(eta0.05/eta300) as a measure<br>
of the broadness of the molecular weight distribution.<br>
SHISHI(eta0.05/eta300) = eta0.05/eta300<br>
wherein<br>
eta0.05 is the complex viscosity at G*=0.05 kPa and<br>
eta300 is the complex viscosity at G*=300 kPa.<br>
It was measured in a Physica MCR300 in oscillating - frequency sweep.<br>
Temperature was 170°C and frequency range was 0.1-500 rad/s. Strain was<br>
set to 5%.<br><br>

(120, 140, 150, 160, 170, 170, 170°C).<br><br>
The following table 1 shows the ratio of surface (3D) to area (2D) which is<br>
a measure for the surface quality, i.e. he lower the ratio, the better is the<br>
surface quality. The surface areas have also been inspected visually and by<br>
touch. The values from ratio of surface (3D) to area (2D) is corresponding<br>
to visual and manual inspection.<br>
Table 1:<br><br>
A high ratio of surface (3D) to area (2D) means that the surface is rough.<br>
Thus, the surface of the inventive compositions is significantly better than<br>
the surface of the comparative example.<br><br>
