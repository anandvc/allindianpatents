				<td>The invention relates to an antenna, in particular an<br>
omnidirectional antenna<br>
Omnidirectional antennas are known, for example, in the<br>
form of so-called indoor antennas which have a<br>
multiband capability and preferably transmit and<br>
receive vertical polarization. They have a base plate<br>
on which an antenna element which is in the form of a<br>
monopole projects transversely from, that is to say at<br>
right angles to, the base plate. The entire arrangement<br>
is generally covered by means of a protective housing<br>
(radome).<br>
A recess is incorporated in the center, or slightly<br>
offset in the vicinity of the center, on the base<br>
plate, which is, metallic or at least conductive, and<br>
generally has a circular shape in a plan view, in which<br>
recess a plug element for a plug connection is<br>
anchored, generally a contact element in the form of a<br>
plug. A coaxial cable in the form of a second plug<br>
element, generally in the form of a plug element in the<br>
form of a female connector, can generally be connected<br>
there, from the underneath. The outer conductor in this<br>
case makes contact with the base plate. The inner<br>
conductor of the feed cable is electrically connected<br>
via the plug contact that is provided on the base plate<br>
to the antenna element, which is in the form of a<br><br>
monopole and projects from the base plate. In other<br>
words, the inner conductor is electrically conductively<br>
isolated from the base plate, and thus from the outer<br>
conductor of a coaxial cable to be connected.<br>
Omnidirectional antennas such as these may be designed<br>
such that they can transmit and receive simultaneously<br>
in two or more frequency ranges, that is to say<br>
simultaneously in two or more frequency bands.<br>
Indoor omnidirectional antennas of this type have<br>
already been produced and marketed by the applicant<br>
and, by way of example, these can transmit and receive<br>
simultaneously in the following frequency ranges:<br>
824	-	960 MHz<br>
1425	-	1710 MHz<br>
1710	-	1880 MHz<br>
1850	-	1990 MHz<br>
1920	-	2170 MHz<br>
Antennas with a multiband capability are likewise<br>
known, are produced and marketed by the applicant and,<br>
for example, can be operated simultaneously at the<br>
following frequencies:<br>
876	-	890 MHz<br>
890	-	960 MHz<br>
1710	-	2170 MHz<br>
2170	-	2500 MHz<br>
An antenna forming the generic type is disclosed, for<br>
example, in DE 37 09 163 C2 or also in US 4 972 196.<br>
The first-mentioned antenna has a rod-shaped antenna<br>
which is fed via an inner conductor with the<br>
interconnection of a capacitor.<br>
The second-mentioned prior publication describes a<br><br>
planar antenna having a disk-shaped antenna element<br>
which is fed capacitively in the middle.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
physically comparatively very small antenna which has a<br>
multiband capability, that is to say it has a very<br>
broad bandwidth overall, which can also be used as an<br>
omnidirectional antenna and which is of simple<br>
construction. In this case, the aim is to be able to<br>
operate the antenna simultaneously over even wider<br>
bandwidths.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a broadband<br>
omnidirectional antenna comprising: an antenna element in the<br>
form of a monopole, the antenna element projecting from a base<br>
plate and arranged such that it is electrically conductively<br>
isolated from the base plate, the antenna element having at<br>
least a first antenna section which widens conically or at least<br>
partially conically away from the base plate at a foot point,<br>
the base plate having a recess in the area of the foot point,<br>
the antenna element comprising a first coupling element and a<br>
second coupling element, the first coupling element comprising a<br>
rod-like structure, the second coupling element comprising a<br>
tubular structure, whereby the first coupling element is<br>
inserted into the second coupling element, the first coupling<br>
element projecting from the base plate and being isolated from<br>
the base plate, the first coupling element being electrically<br>
connectable with a feed line, the second coupling element being<br>
electrically connected with the antenna element, said first and<br>
second coupling elements providing a series or capacitive inner<br>
conductor line coupling, the second coupling element being<br>
positioned within the antenna element first antenna section.<br><br>
Preferably, the antenna has a feed line wherein the first<br>
coupling element extends transversely with respect to and<br>
preferably at right angles to the base plate and is electrically<br>
connected to the feed line such that it is electrically<br>
conductively isolated from the base plate. The first and second<br>
coupling elements are electrically conductively connected to or<br>
part of the antenna element, said coupling elements not being<br>
conductively connected to one another providing series line<br>
coupling. The antenna has at least one cylindrical antenna<br>
element section. The antenna element first antenna element<br>
section widens conically away from the base plate and merges<br>
into a cylindrical antenna element section. The second coupling<br>
element is part of the antenna element and has a side which<br>
faces the base plate, said side being connected to a conical or<br>
truncated conical antenna element section, by the interposition<br>
of a connecting section running parallel to the base plate. The<br>
antenna element operates on a predetermined frequency band<br>
centered at a mean wavelength A, and wherein the axial length of<br>
the first coupling element is λ/4 - 40% λ/4 
+ 40% λ/4. The antenna may operate at a mean wavelength A, and<br>
wherein the axial length of the first coupling element is (n x<br>
λ/4) - 40% (n x λ/4) 
where n = 1, 3, 5 .... Preferably, the axial length of the first<br>
coupling element is designed for the lowermost frequency in one<br>
of the two or more frequency bands, such that it is small in<br>
comparison to Lambda/4, where Lambda represents the mid-<br>
frequency of the relevant frequency band. The antenna element is<br>
composed of electrically conductive material. The antenna<br>
element comprises an injection-molded plastic part provided with<br>
a conductive coating. The first coupling element is positioned<br>
within a conical void formed within a conically widening portion<br><br>
of said first antenna section. The first coupling element and<br>
the isolator element comprise a unit which can be handled as an<br>
entity, the isolator on the first coupling element being<br>
composed of a sprayed-on substance. The first coupling element<br>
is mounted on a base plate to comprise a unit which can be<br>
handled as an entity by means of the isolator element which is<br>
located thereon and a plug element anchored on the base plate.<br>
The antenna element is preferably covered with a shroud, by<br>
means of which the antenna element is protected against axial<br>
sliding and radial tilting. The covering device comprises an<br>
inner shroud and an outer shroud, the outer shroud covering<br>
everything can be fitted on the inner shroud, the outer shroud<br>
being anchored on the inner shroud and/or on the reflector via a<br>
clipping and/or latching device. The antenna may comprise a<br>
reflector and a covering device comprising an inner shroud<br>
attached to the reflector by a clipping and/or a latching<br>
device. The inner shroud has a central fixing section which<br>
projects into the interior of the cup-shaped antenna element,<br>
presses against the adjacent end face of the second coupling<br>
element and thus protects the antenna element against axial<br>
movement and/or radial tilting. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
antenna has a tubular isolator element arranged between the<br>
first coupling element and the second coupling element. The<br>
isolator element has a radially projecting stop, flange or<br>
flange section in the area of the foot point on the antenna<br>
element via which the isolator element is supported or held with<br>
respect to the base plate. The foot point of the antenna element<br>
rests on the flange. The first coupling element is part of a<br>
feed conductor and is formed from the inner conductor of a<br>
coaxial feed line. The first coupling element is formed from the<br>
inner conductor of a coaxial feed line.<br><br>
The present invention also provides a multiband indoor<br>
omnidirectional antenna comprising: a base plate; a monopole<br>
antenna element projecting from and electrically isolated from<br>
the base plate, said monopole antenna element comprising a<br>
tubular conical section and a cylindrical section, said tubular<br>
conical section operating as a radiator for a first frequency<br>
band, said cylindrical section operating as a radiator for a<br>
second frequency band lower than said upper frequency band; and<br>
a series inner conductor line coupler for feeding the antenna<br>
element, said inner conductor line coupler comprising a tubular<br>
coupling structure and rod-like coupling structure that is<br>
insertable into said tubular coupling structure to couple with<br>
said monopole antenna element, the rod-like coupling structure<br>
projecting from the base plate and being isolated from the base<br>
plate, the rod-like coupling structure being electrically<br>
connectable with a feed line, the tubular coupling structure<br>
being electrically connected with the antenna element, said rod-<br>
like coupling structure and the tubular coupling structure<br>
providing a series or capacitive inner conductor line coupling,<br>
the series inner conductor line being positioned within the<br>
antenna element tubular conical section.<br>
Preferably, the antenna operates on a predetermined frequency<br>
band having a mean wavelength A, and wherein said coupler has an<br>
axial length of λ/4 - 40% λ/4 
The antenna operates on a predetermined frequency band having a<br>
mean wavelength A, and wherein said coupler has an axial length<br>
of (n x λ/4) - 40% (n x λ/4) 
x λ/4), where n = 1, 3, 5 .... The coupler provides both<br>
capacitive coupling and inductive coupling at least at limit<br>
frequencies. For some frequencies of interest the electrical<br><br>
length of the coupler is a half wavelength which results in a<br>
resonance such that open end at the base of the antenna element<br>
acts as an open circuit, and for other frequencies of interest<br>
the length of the coupler is short in comparison to quarter<br>
wavelength and thus forms a series capacitance allowing<br>
broadband impedance matching. The coupler provides capacitive<br>
and inductive coupling. The series inner conductor line coupler<br>
is positioned within a hollow formed by the tubular conical<br>
section.<br>
It must be regarded as very surprising that a greatly<br>
widened bandwidth for simultaneous operation in widely<br>
differing frequency ranges is possible by means of a<br>
single physically very small antenna, by the antenna<br>
being fed by means of a series or capacitive line<br>
coupling at the foot point of the antenna element.<br>
Very wide bandwidths are possible in this way. By way<br>
of example, the antenna according to the invention can<br>
be operated without any problems simultaneously in the<br>
800 to 1000 MHz band, in the 1400 - 3500 MHz band, or<br>
else, for example, in the 5000 to 6000 MHz band. Owing<br>
to the series (capacitive) line coupling, there may be<br>
resonances in the upper band.<br>
The antenna according to the invention has a<br>
generically specific serial or capacitive coupling.<br>
This is so since, according to the invention, a first<br>
coupling element which extends away from the base plate<br>
surface or from the counterweight surface such that it<br>
is electrically conductively isolated from it is<br>
provided for the inner conductor coupling. Interacting<br><br>
with it is a second line coupling element, which is<br>
electrically conductively connected to the antenna<br>
element or is part of the antenna element. The first<br>
and second line coupling elements are thus electrically<br>
conductively isolated from each other, that is not<br>
electrically conductively connected to each other,<br>
whereby the serial or capacitive line coupling is<br>
brought about. The two interacting coupling elements<br>
are on the one hand in the form of a rod and on the<br>
other hand in the form of a tube, so that the two<br>
coupling elements can be inserted one into the other.<br>
This offers the major advantage that the linear design<br>
can be used to bring about an optimum capacitive or<br>
serial coupling. In addition, by this design, on the<br>
other hand a corresponding holding and carrying<br>
function can also be brought about for the antenna<br>
element, in particular whenever an isolating dielectric<br>
is provided between the two interacting coupling<br>
elements, whereby the two coupling elements are<br>
mechanically held firmly against each other during<br>
their conductive isolation.<br>
The antenna according to the invention, which is like a<br>
monopole, is in this case preferably rotationally<br>
symmetrical, or is preferably designed to be<br>
rotationally symmetrical at least in specific angle<br>
ranges, having at least one section which widens<br>
conically in the longitudinal direction of the antenna,<br>
which is in the form of a monopole. The antenna may<br>
also be designed such that only its external shape is<br>
conical, overall.<br>
The antenna may thus in principle also be radially<br>
symmetrical or may transmit and receive symmetrically,<br>
that is to say it may have a cross-sectional shape such<br>
that the antenna can be made to be coincident when it<br>
is rotated through a specific angle in a plane about a<br>
central axis. This may, for example, apply solely to<br><br>
the antenna element or, for example, solely to the base<br>
plate, or to both.<br>
Alternatively, the antenna element, which is in the<br>
form of a monopole or is similar to a monopole, may be<br>
cylindrical.<br>
The antenna element, which is in the form of a<br>
monopole, of the antenna is preferably in a form,<br>
however, which is subdivided into a first section,<br>
which widens conically away from the base plate, and a<br>
cylindrical second section, which is adjacent to it. In<br>
other words, according to the present invention, the<br>
antenna element is preferably formed from a combination<br>
of a conical antenna element section and a cylindrical<br>
antenna element section. The conical part of the<br>
antenna element primarily acts as a monopole for the<br>
upper frequency bands. The cylindrical part of the<br>
antenna element in contrast interacts with the<br>
associated counterweight surface (base plate) more for<br>
the lower frequencies. As a positive feature, it should<br>
be noted that this means that no reaction can be found<br>
from the cylindrical part on the upper frequency bands.<br>
The series and/or capacitive line coupling, which thus<br>
comprises a series and/or capacitive inner conductor<br>
coupling, is preferably provided via a first coupling<br>
part, which is connected to the feed line (inner<br>
conductor of a coaxial conductor) , is in the form of a<br>
rod and projects from the base plate, isolated from the<br>
base plate. The second coupling part, which is coupled<br>
to it, is connected to the antenna element, or is part<br>
of the antenna element. The second coupling part is<br>
preferably tubular. In particular in order to achieve<br>
protection against rotation, the coupling part may also<br>
be in the form of a polygon or the like, that is to<br>
say, for example, it may have an n-sided polygonal<br>
cross section. In general terms, the cross-sectional<br>
shape may be designed such that it has at least one<br><br>
shape that is not circular. This allows the antenna<br>
element, which is similar to a monopole and is formed<br>
from a combination of a conical surface and a<br>
cylindrical section adjacent to it, to be fitted by-<br>
means of its internal tubular section (which projects<br>
from the foot point of the antenna element) directly<br>
onto the first coupling part, which is in the form of a<br>
rod and is connected to the feed cable. Since the first<br>
and second coupling parts, that is to say the feed line<br>
and the antenna element which is in the form of a<br>
monopole, are conductively isolated in order to produce<br>
the series line coupling, an isolating sleeve of the<br>
first coupling part is preferably fitted, onto which<br>
the second coupling part of the antenna element, which<br>
is in the form of a monopole, can be fitted.<br>
This also results in very simple assembly and<br>
installation, since the antenna element can be mounted,<br>
without any soldering and just by pushing it on, above<br>
the base plate on the first coupling part, which is<br>
connected to the feed line, and with the interposition<br>
of an insulating isolator.<br>
However, the isolator need not necessarily be composed,<br>
for example, of a plastic material with a dielectric<br>
constant which can be selected in advance. Air may also<br>
be used as an isolator. In this case all that is<br>
necessary is to use a suitable centering device and/or<br>
spacer in order to ensure that the fitted antenna<br>
element cannot make an electrically conductive contact<br>
with the coupling part under discussion, which is in<br>
the form of a rod and projects from the base plate,<br>
and/or with the base plate itself.<br>
The series feed also makes it possible to minimize the<br>
antenna element's height in comparison with the<br>
conventional solution. This also makes it possible to<br>
reduce the counterweight area (base plate), thus making<br>
it possible to achieve a comparatively small physical<br><br>
size.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail in the<br>
following text with reference to exemplary embodiments.<br>

everything is fitted to the	inner<br>

A first exemplary embodiment of an antenna according to<br>
the invention and having an antenna element 15 is shown<br>
in the form of a schematic plan view in Figure la, in<br>
the form of a schematic view from underneath in<br>
Figure lb, and in the form of a vertical<br>
cross-sectional illustration, passing through the<br>
central axis, in Figure 2.<br>
The antenna has a base plate or ground plate 1 which,<br>
in the illustrated exemplary embodiment, is circular or<br>
is in the form of a disk. This base plate or ground<br>
plate 1 may, however, also have a completely different<br>
shape. For example, it may be square, rectangular, oval<br>
etc., that is to say in general it may also be n-sided<br>
polygonal or may have other desired basic shapes and<br>
boundary lines. The plate 1 is essentially referred to<br>
in the following text as the base plate 1. The base<br>
plate 1 in this case also, inter alia, carries out the<br>
function of a counterweight surface.<br>
A recess 3 is incorporated in the center of the base<br>
plate 1. A plug element 5 is positioned and attached in<br>
and underneath the recess 3 and, in the illustrated<br>
exemplary embodiment, is in the form of a coaxial plug<br>
element 5' . The outer conductor 7a of the plug element<br>
5 is electrically conductively connected to the base<br>
plate 1. The inner conductor 7a of the plug element 5<br>
is passed through the recess 3, isolated from the outer<br>
conductor 7b, and is electrically conductively<br>
connected to a first or a feed-side coupling element 11<br>
which extends above the base plate 1. This coupling<br>
element 11 is transverse with respect to the base<br>
plate, that is to say it is vertical in the illustrated<br>
exemplary embodiment. It is in the form of a rod and<br><br>
may preferably have a circular cross section.<br>
A tubular isolator element 13 is fitted on this<br>
coupling element 11. This isolator element 13 in the<br>
illustrated exemplary embodiment has a length which<br>
corresponds approximately to the axial length of the<br>
coupling element 11. The isolator element 13 is<br>
provided in the lower end with a flange 13a which<br>
projects laterally and which, in the illustrated<br>
exemplary embodiment, is likewise circular or is in the<br>
form of a disk and is positioned on the base plate 1 in<br>
the area of the recess 3.<br>
This isolator element 13 is also plugged onto the<br>
antenna element 15 which is in the form of a monopole<br>
as shown in Figures 1 and 2.<br>
The antenna element 15 which is like a monopole has a<br>
first antenna section 15a and a second antenna section<br>
15b. The first antenna section 15a is aligned such that<br>
it widens conically away from the foot point 19, that<br>
is to say its widened conical section points away from<br>
the base plate 1. This conical first antenna element<br>
section 15a is followed by a second cylindrical antenna<br>
element section 15b, with the diameter of the conical<br>
antenna element section at the junction between the<br>
first and the second antenna element section<br>
corresponding to the diameter of the cylindrical<br>
antenna element section. The antenna element thus has<br>
an outer surface which extends around the longitudinal<br>
axis that runs transversely with respect to the base<br>
plate. The antenna element 15 is in this case<br>
preferably rotationally symmetrical, is partially<br>
rotationally symmetrical, or is at least approximately<br>
or essentially radially symmetrical or it transmits and<br>
receives symmetrically.<br>
As is also evident from the cross-section illustration<br>
shown in Figure 2, part of the antenna element is a<br><br>
tubular coupling element 15c which is formed in the<br>
interior and has a free internal diameter which is<br>
equal to or slightly larger than the external diameter<br>
of the tubular isolator element 13. This coupling<br>
section 15c thus allows the antenna element, which is<br>
in the form of a monopole, to be pushed onto the<br>
isolator element 13 until the lowermost contact surface<br>
15' of the antenna element 15, that is to say the foot<br>
point 19 of the antenna element, rests on the isolator<br>
flange 13a of the isolator element 13, and is thus<br>
electrically conductively isolated from the base plate<br>
1.<br>
The axial length of the coupling element 15c is<br>
generally longer than the axial length of the isolator<br>
element 13 and/or the length of the first coupling<br>
element 11 on the feed cable side. The length of the<br>
hollow-cylindrical isolator 13 is in this case<br>
comparatively non-critical, and it may also be<br>
considerably shorter. The isolator is essentially used<br>
only to mechanically hold the antenna element 15 and,<br>
furthermore, contributes to no section of the antenna<br>
element 15, and in particular not the coupling section<br>
15c, being electrically conductively able to touch the<br>
coupling element 11, which is electrically in contact<br>
with the inner conductor.<br>
The two parallel first and second coupling elements 11<br>
and 15c which are electrically conductively isolated<br>
and are even arranged coaxially with respect to one<br>
another in the illustrated exemplary embodiment form a<br>
series (capacitive) line coupling at the foot point of<br>
the antenna element 15, that is to say a series or<br>
capacitive inner conductor coupling. The length of the<br>
first and second coupling elements 11 and 15c,<br>
respectively, should thus preferably be chosen such<br>
that the desired optimum coupling can be provided for<br>
the various frequency ranges. The coupling element 15c<br>
which forms one part of the antenna element arrangement<br><br>
is thus generally chosen to be longer than the length<br>
of the coupling element 11 on the feed cable side. The<br>
length of the coupling element 11 on the feed side is<br>
preferably chosen as a function of the upper frequency<br>
bands, such that this length is lambda/4 or n x<br>
lambda/4, where n is an odd integer number, that is to<br>
say n = 1, 3, 5 .... The open end of the line coupling<br>
is thus connected (at the mid-frequency of the<br>
respective band) to the feed point 15' via the short<br>
circuit, that is to say conductively. The coupling<br>
element 11 on the feed cable side is thus both<br>
capacitive and inductive at the limit frequencies. For<br>
the frequencies for which the length of the coupling<br>
element 11 on the feed side is lambda/2, this results<br>
in a resonance, that is to say the open end at the foot<br>
point 15' of the antenna element 15 acts as an open<br>
circuit (high impedance). For the lowermost frequency<br>
band (in the illustrated and explained exemplary<br>
embodiment, that is to say the band from about 800 to<br>
1000 MHz), the length of the coupling element 11 on the<br>
feed cable side is very short in comparison to lambda/4<br>
(that is to say 11 
capacitance, which allows broadband impedance matching<br>
at this frequency and is also a governing factor for a<br>
small physical structure.<br>
Figure 3 shows a schematic perspective illustration of<br>
the first electrically conductive coupling element 11,<br>
which is in the form of a rod, with the antenna element<br>
15 removed, and with the coupling element being<br>
electrically conductively connected in the area of the<br>
recess 3 to the coaxial plug element that is located on<br>
the lower face of the base plate 1, that is to say in<br>
the inner conductor plug there.<br>
As can be seen from the schematic perspective<br>
illustration in Figure 3, the tubular isolator element<br>
13 is just plugged onto this first coupling element 11,<br>
is preferably composed of plastic and has a good<br><br>
dielectric constant value. As stated, the second<br>
internal tubular element 15c of the antenna element 15<br>
can then be plugged onto this.<br>
Figure 4 shows the antenna element 15 on its own, in<br>
the form of a perspective illustration, subdivided into<br>
a conical antenna element section 15a and a cylindrical<br>
antenna element section 15b.<br>
Figure 5 shows a schematic cross-section illustration<br>
of a modified exemplary embodiment of an antenna<br>
element which comprises just one conical antenna<br>
element 15, which may have a truncated conical shape.<br>
Corresponding to the cross-section illustration shown<br>
in Figure 6, this shows that, in this case, only one<br>
antenna element, which is cylindrical or is in the form<br>
of a pot and is like a monopole, is used as the antenna<br>
element 15, and does not have a conical section. In<br>
this situation, the coupling element 15c is connected<br>
by means of a radial connecting or base section (15d)<br>
to the outer casing of the cylindrical antenna element<br>
(15) .<br>
The coupling section 15c, which forms part of the<br>
antenna element arrangement, is seated centrally and<br>
internally and is in the form of a hollow cylinder, is<br>
shown, in each case in the form of a section, both in<br>
the exemplary embodiment in Figure 5 and in Figure 6,<br>
and is then plugged onto the first coupling element 11,<br>
engaging over it and preferably with the interposition<br>
of a hollow-cylindrical isolator.<br>
An antenna element as shown in Figure 5 makes it<br>
possible to produce a physically small omnidirectional<br>
antenna which can be operated in particular in low<br>
frequency ranges. An antenna element as shown in Figure<br>
6, that is to say an antenna element which is only<br>
conical or in the form of a truncated cone, results in<br><br>
a physically small antenna which can be operated in<br>
particular in high frequency bands. Preferably,<br>
however, an antenna type having an antenna element as<br>
shown in Figures 1 and 2 is provided, whose bandwidth<br>
covers both relatively low as well as high and very<br>
high frequency ranges and bands.<br>
The described antenna type not only makes it possible<br>
to produce a very broadband antenna but also, in<br>
particular, the serial feed allows the antenna element<br>
height to be minimized, thus in turn also allowing the<br>
counterweight area (base plate) to be designed to be<br>
smaller. The described antennas thus have the advantage<br>
that they have a broader bandwidth with a smaller<br>
physical size than conventional antennas and, at the<br>
same time, can be assembled, installed and produced<br>
even more easily, since, in principle, each of the<br>
respective antenna elements, with its integrated<br>
coupling element 15c, just has to be pushed onto the<br>
first coupling element 11, which is electrically<br>
connected to the feed line.<br>
In principle, there is no need for an isolator element<br>
13 provided only that the antenna element, which is in<br>
the form of a monopole, can be arranged with its<br>
coupling element 15c electrically conductively isolated<br>
from the first coupling element 11. For this purpose,<br>
it may be sufficient for the antenna element to be held<br>
and fixed only in the area of its foot point on an<br>
isolator element which is in the form of a disk or<br>
plate, so that the two coupling elements 11 and 15c do<br>
not make any electrical contact.<br>
In contrast to the illustrated exemplary embodiments,<br>
the plug element 5 need not necessarily be a female<br>
connector (for example an N female connector). It is<br>
also possible to use a permanently connected cable,<br>
that is to say in particular with the inner conductor<br>
of a coaxial cable being positioned appropriately such<br><br>
that it is used as the coupling element 11 on the feed<br>
side, in a corresponding manner to the illustrations in<br>
the drawings. The chosen expression "coupling element<br>
11 on the feed side" may thus also be understood as<br>
meaning an embodiment in which the coupling element 11<br>
represents the end of a corresponding feed conductor<br>
(preferably the end of the inner conductor of a<br>
corresponding coaxial feed line cable).<br>
Finally, in a further modification, it is likewise<br>
possible to provide for the coupling element 11 which<br>
is on the feed conductor side, the isolation 13 which<br>
surrounds the coupling element 11 and, preferably and<br>
furthermore, also the plug element 5 including the<br>
inner conductor 7a to be provided and used as a<br>
prefabricated unit which can be handled as an entity,<br>
is inserted in and is mechanically anchored on a<br>
corresponding hole in the base plate 1, in order then<br>
just to only fit the antenna element 15 with its<br>
coupling element 15c on the antenna element side.<br>
As is evident from the cross-section illustration shown<br>
in Figures 7 and 8, the reflector has indentations or<br>
so-called mounting points 31 which are recessed at a<br>
number of points that are located offset from the<br>
center, in each of which a hole 33 is incorporated, in<br>
order to make it possible to attach the reflector in an<br>
appropriate manner to a mount, by the insertion of<br>
screws.<br>
Finally, the entire antenna arrangement is held and<br>
fixed by means of an inner shroud 35. The inner shroud<br>
35 has latching or clipping elements 37 which are<br>
located offset in the circumferential direction on the<br>
reflector side and can be inserted into corresponding<br>
stamped-out areas or openings in the reflector 1. In<br>
the snapped-in state, the latching elements 37 then<br>
latch behind the stamped areas in the reflector, thus<br>
ensuring that the antenna and the inner shroud 37 are<br><br>
held securely, without any further installation<br>
measures.<br>
In this case, the inner shroud 35 is designed such<br>
that, centrally, it has a holding section 37a which<br>
engages at the bottom in the cup-shaped antenna<br>
element, and whose reflector-side end face 37b secures<br>
the antenna element in the plugged-on position. The end<br>
face 37b of the inner shroud may in this case touch the<br>
upper end face, which faces it, of the coupling element<br>
15c on the antenna element side. This inner shroud thus<br>
secures and fixes the antenna element 15 against<br>
sliding out axially and thus against radial tilting.<br>
Finally, a so-called outer shroud 41 can be fitted such<br>
that it covers everything, in which case the outer<br>
shroud may likewise latch in via latching or clipping<br>
elements 37, which are located internally, for example<br>
on a step on the inner shroud in openings that are<br>
incorporated there, and/or in openings in the<br>
reflector, to be precise such that corresponding<br>
latching or clipping elements are passed through the<br>
opening and can latch in behind the corresponding<br>
material sections of the inner shroud and/or of the<br>
reflector. The outer shroud is in this case designed<br>
such that it extends over and thus covers everything,<br>
including the reflector.<br>
The inner shroud 35 and outer shroud 41 are in this<br>
case manufactured from a material which is particularly<br>
transparent for electromagnetic beams in the frequency<br>
range to be transmitted.<br>
Finally, it should be noted that the various<br>
embodiments of the antenna element 15 do not<br>
necessarily need to be composed of conductive material<br>
from the start, but that the antenna element 15 may<br>
also be formed from other non-conductive material, for<br>
example plastic. In this case, the antenna element 15<br><br>
should have, or else be provided with, a suitable<br>
electrically conductive layer on its inner and/or outer<br>
surface, or in some other way.<br><br>
