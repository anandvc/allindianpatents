More particularly this invention relates to a system and method of providing user equipment initiated and assisted backward handover in heterogeneous wireless networks.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
The radio access network (RAN), system architecture (SA) and the core terminal (CT) working groups of the third generation partnership project (3GPP) aim to develop an enhanced UTRAN (E-UTRAN) architecture for next generation wireless systems. The E-UTRAN system is required to co-exist with the current second (2G) and third generation (3G) wireless systems, and in particular, support handovers between the existing systems and the newly evolved E- UTRAN system, specified in the 3GPP TR 23.882, 3GPP TS 23.401 and 3GPP TS 23.402.<br>
The E-UTRAN system is an evolution of the 3GPP UTRAN system, in which the main entities are the user equipment (UE), the enhanced Node B (ENB), Mobility Management Entity (MME), User Plane Entity (UPE) and Inter Access System Anchor (IASA) as shown in the Figure 1. The ENB of the EUTRAN system is expected to have the features of the Node B and the radio network controller (RNC) of the legacy UTRAN system. MME of the System Architecture Evolution (SAE) manages and stores UE context (for idle state: UE/user identities, UE mobility state, user security parameters). It generates temporary identities and allocates them to UEs. It checks the authorization whether the UE may camp on the TA or on the PLMN. It also authenticates the user. UPE of SAE terminates for idle state UEs the downlink data path and triggers/initiates paging when downlink data arrive for the UE. It manages and stores UE contexts, e.g. parameters of the IP bearer service or network internal routing information. It performs replication of the user traffic in case of interception. Inter AS Anchor is the user plane anchor for mobility between different access systems. It performs or supports handover between different access systems.<br>
The GERAN consists of the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) and the Base Station Controller (BSC). The UTRAN consists of the Node B and the Radio Network Controller (RNC). The GPRS Core Network consists of the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) and the Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) as shown in Figure 1.<br>
The integrated WLAN (l-WLAN) system specified in the 3GPP TS 23.234 specifications provides a system and method to integrate legacy UTRAN systems with WLAN systems, as shown in the Figure 1. The l-WLAN system allows WLAN users to access 3GPP packet switched services (WLAN 3GPP IP Access).<br>
LIMITATION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make arid/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The present invention provides a system and method of providing UE assisted backward handover in heterogeneous wireless networks.<br>
The invention is operated as detailed below:<br>
Backward Handover between Heterogeneous access systems initiated by UE:<br>
The generalized UE assisted backward handover between the heterogeneous wireless networks is shown in figure 2. The functionality of the interworking function/unit (IWF/IWU) is to convert the RAN and the CN containers/protocol/parameters of one access system to another. IWF interface with different network entities, with the entity specific interface protocol. The IWF can be co-located with any other network entity in the serving network or in the target network or alternatively can be a separate entity in the serving network or in the target network. The operation of the UE assisted backward handover is<br>
given in details below:<br>
1.	UE sends periodic or event based measurements to the serving access network.<br>
2.	If the serving access system finds that UE measurement is below the threshold or serving access system decides by any other mean that serving RAT cannot be continued, then the serving access system can request the UE to start scanning other RATs or alternatively by L2 or by some other means, the UE decides that the serving RAN cannot be continued and starts scanning the other RATs.<br>
3.	UE decide the target system based on the measurement report compared with the RAT specific handover criteria and ranking orders configured in the UE.<br>
4.	The UE initiates the backward handover procedure by sending handover request message to the target network through the serving network.<br>
5.	The serving network checks for the capabilities and authorizes the UE requested handover. <br>
6.	Then the serving network forwards the HO request to the interworking function (IWF). The serving network includes the security context of the UE along with this message.<br>
7.	The IWF converts the serving access network specific parameters to the target specific parameters and forwards the request to the target network.<br>
8.	The IWF lookup the target system parameters in the HO request message and forwards the HO request to the appropriate target access system entity.<br>
9.	The target system then prepares for the UE handover using the HO request parameters.<br>
10.	After successful HO preparation the target system sends HO response message to the IWF. The target system includes the target system related parameters like entity ID and/or IP address and selected security configuration along with the HO response.<br>
11.	The IWF then converts the parameters according to the serving system specific parameters and forwards the HO response to the serving network. Then the UE initiate L2 connectivity to the target system.<br>
Illustrated example for backward Handover from the WiMAX to the LTE/SAE access system as shown in Figure 3<br>
1.	UE sends periodic or event based measurements to the BS of WiMAX network.<br>
2.	If the BS finds that UE measurement is below the threshold or BS decides by any other mean that WiMAX RAN cannot be continued, then the BS can request the UE to start scanning other RATs or alternatively by L2 or by some other means, the UE decides that the serving RAN cannot be continued and starts scanning the other RATs.<br>
3.	UE decided the target system as LTE/SAE based on the LTE/SAE measurement report compared with the RAT specific handover criteria and ranking orders configured in the UE.<br>
4.	The UE initiates the backward handover procedure by sending handover request message to the LTE/SAE network through the WiMAX network. The UE includes the UE security capabilities, TAI , cell ID, Indiation of Inter RAT HO, serving and target RATs, etc.,.<br>
The UE send the HO request to the BS, and then the BS forwards the HO request to the ASN GW.<br>

If the user is capable of inter RAT handover, in authorization answer, the AAA server includes the unused AVs, latest CK and IK or alternatively the Master Key (MK)..<br>
6.	The ASN GW forwards the HO request message along with the security keys given by AAA server to the IWF.<br>
7.	The IWF function then forwards the HO Request to the MME through the interface specific protocol. The IWF obtains the IP address of the MME by resolving TAI or alternatively the IWF have the mapping of TAI to the MME.<br>
8.	The MME decides the target ENB and derives the LTE/SAE specific keys and prepares for the UE HO. The MME derives the LTE/SAE specific key KASME using the CK and IK or the Master Keys of the WiMAX network. The derivation of KASME from CK and IK is by Concatenation of CK and IK or alternatively using the pseudo random function (PRF) and input to the PRF are CK and IK or alternatively Exclusive OR'ing the keys CK and IK or<br>
alternatively some other means using CK and IK or using MK. Then from KASME all other keys are derived as specified in the 3GPP TR 33.821.<br>
9.	The MME passes the security context to the target ENB and setup the RAB for the UE. The MME sends the preferred algorithm as the algorithm used in the WiMAX system by the UE to the target ENB.<br>
10.	After successful HO preparation the MME sends HO response message to the IWF. The MME includes the target system related parameters like ENB ID(s) and selected security configuration parameters along with the HO response.<br>
11.	The IWF then converts the parameters according to the serving system specific parameters and forwards the HO response to the UE through AAA, ASN GW and BS. Then the UE initiate L2 connectivity to the ENB.<br>

We Claim:<br>
1.	A method of providing user equipment initiated and assisted backward handover in heterogeneous wireless networks comprising the steps of:<br>
deciding the need of a handover from a serving network to a target network by the UE;<br>
initiating the backward handover by sending handover request message to the target network through the serving network by the UE;<br>
checking for the capabilities of the UE and authorizing the backward handover by the serving network;<br>
preparing for the backward handover and informing the UE when the target network is ready by the target network ; and<br>
performing the handover procedure by the UE.<br>
2.	The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein an interworking function/unit (IWF/IWU) is convert the RAN and the CN containers/protocol/parameters of one access system to another. <br>
3.	The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein IWF interface with different network entities and with the entity specific interface protocol.<br>
4.	The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the IWF is co-located with any other network entity in the serving network or in the target network or alternatively can be a separate entity in the serving network or in the target network.<br>
5.	The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein UE sends periodic or event based measurements to the serving access network.<br>
6.	The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein if the serving access system finds that UE measurement is below a threshold or serving access system decides by any other mean that serving RAT cannot be continued, then the serving access system can request the UE to start scanning other RATs or alternatively by L2 or by some other means, and the UE decides that the serving RAN cannot be continued and starts scanning the other RATs.<br>
7.	The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein UE decide the target system based on the measurement report compared with the RAT specific handover criteria and ranking orders configured in the UE.<br>
8.	The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the UE initiates the backward handover procedure by sending handover request message to the target network through the serving network.<br>
9.	The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the serving network checks for the capabilities and authorizes the UE requested handover.<br>
10.	The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the serving network forwards the HO request to the interworking function (IWF) where the serving network includes the security context of the UE along with the message.<br>
11.	The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the IWF converts the serving access network specific parameters to the target specific parameters and forwards the request to the target network.<br>
12.	The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the IWF lookup the target system parameters in the HO request message and forwards the HO request to the appropriate target access system entity.<br>
13.	The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the target system prepares for the UE handover using the HO request parameters and after successful HO preparation the target system sends HO response message to the IWF.<br>
14.	The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the target system includes the target system related parameters like entity ID and/or IP address and selected security configuration along with the HO response.<br>
15.	The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the IWF converts the parameters according to the serving system specific parameters and forwards the HO response to the serving network and then the UE initiate L2 connectivity to the target system.<br>
16.	A system for providing user equipment initiated and assisted backward handover in heterogeneous wireless networks comprising:<br>
UE deciding the need of a handover from a serving network to a target network;<br>
UE initiating the backward handover by sending handover request message to the target network through the serving network;<br>
the serving network checking for the capabilities of the UE and authorizing the backward handover;<br>
the target network preparing for the backward handover and informing the UE when the target network is ready; and<br>
the UE performing the handover procedure. <br>
