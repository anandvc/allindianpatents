BACKGROUND OF INVENTION:  The present invention is basically based on treatment of alcoholism by pharmaceutical composition. Alcoholism is a disease. It is often diagnosed more through behaviors and adverse effects on functioning than by specific medical symptoms. Alcoholics, when confronted, will often deny excess consumption of alcohol. Alcoholism is a diverse disease and is often influenced by the alcoholic's personality as well as by other factors. Therefore, signs and symptoms often vary from person to person. There are. however, certain behaviors and signs that indicate someone may have a problem with alcohol. These behaviors and signs include insomnia, frequent falls, bruises of different ages, blackouts, chronic depression, anxiety, irritability, tardiness or absence at work or school, loss of employment, divorce or separation, financial difficulties, frequent intoxicated appearance or behavior, weight loss, or frequent automobile collisions. Late signs and symptoms include medical conditions such as pancreatitis, gastritis, cirrhosis, neuropathy, anemia, cerebellar atrophy, alcoholic cardiomyopathy (heart disease). Wernicke's encephalopathy (abnormal brain functioning), Korsakoff s dementia, central pontine myelinolysis (brain degeneration), seizures, confusion, malnutrition, hallucinations, peptic ulcers, and gastrointestinal bleeding.<br>
EFFECT OF ALCOHOLISM IN LIVER- Alcohol abuse can cause a condition called "fatty liver" or another called "alcohol hepatitis" - both of'which can be treated, but only if alcohol consumption is stopped. If drinking continues, these conditions will cause cirrhosis of the liver. Alcoholism is called a progressive disease, meaning that over time the symptoms and effects of drinking alcohol become more intense and severe. The symptoms in the early stages differ from those during later stages as the disease progresses from binge drinking to alcohol abuse to alcohol dependence. The liver detoxifies poisons, both those produced by the body and those from outside; filters bacteria from the blood; regulates fat metabolism; stores and manufactures vitamins; regulates and manufactures cholesterol and fats: synthesizes proteins; maintains the body's water and salt balance; secretes bile for the digestion of fat; stores energy (in the form of glycogen) helps regulate overall body metabolism; transforms the highly toxic ammonia (produced by exercise and by metabolism of proteins) into urea<br><br><br>
t which is eliminated in the urine: manufactures lipoproteins for fat and cholesterol transport; and metabolizes alcohol.<br>
If the liver stops doing any of these jobs, or numerous others it does constantly, the result is fatal.<br>
Self Care<br>
Information dissemination. This strategy provides awareness and knowledge of the nature and extent of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use, abuse, and addiction and their effects on individuals, families, and communities, as well as information to increase perceptions of risk. It also provides knowledge and awareness of prevention policies, programs, and services. It helps set and reinforce norms (for example, underage drinking and drug dealers will not be tolerated in this neighborhood).<br>
Prevention education. This strategy aims to affect critical life and social skills, including decision making, refusal skills, critical analysis (for example, of media messages), and systematic and judgmental abilities.<br>
Alternatives- This strategy provides for the participation of targeted populations in activities that exclude alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use by youth. Constructive and healthy activities offset the attraction to, or otherwise meet the needs usually filled by. alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use.<br>
Problem identification and referral. This strategy calls for identification, education, and counseling for those youth who have indulged in age-inappropriate use of tobacco products or alcohol, or who have indulged in the first use of illicit drugs. Activities under this strategy would include screening for tendencies toward substance abuse and referral for preventive treatment for curbing such tendencies.<br>
Community-based process. This strategy aims to enhance the ability of the community to provide prevention and treatment services to alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use disorders more effectively. Activities include organizing, planning, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness of services implementation, interagency collaboration, coalition building, and networking. Building healthy communities encourages healthy lifestyle choices.<br>
Environmental approach. This strategy sets up or changes written and unwritten community standards, codes, and attitudes-influencing incidence and prevalence of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use problems in the general population. Included are laws to restrict availability and access, price increases, and community-wide actions.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION: The main object of the invention is to provide the composition of pharmaceutical which is comparatively more effective than others as it contains taurine and race-methionin. Taurine, or 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, is an organic acid. Taurine can either promote or repress the reward effects associated with alcohol; the delineating factor being the amount of alcohol consumed its role in alcoholism. Its major metabolite taurocholic acid is responsible for the metabolic conversion of alcohol. Race Methionine has antioxidant properties. It prevents lower cholesterol levels by increasing the liver's production of lecithin, reduces liver fat and protects the kidneys.<br><br><br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION: This invention is based on a pharmaceutical composition containing taurine and race-methionine for treating alcoholism. Both arc helpful for protection to liver by alcohol.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION: The liver is the largest glandular organ of the body. The liver has many functions. Some of the functions are: to produce substances that break down fats, convert glucose to glycogen, produce urea (the main substance of urine), make certain amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), filter harmful substances from the blood (such as alcohol), storage of vitamins and minerals (vitamins A, D, K. and B12) and maintain a proper level or glucose in the blood. The liver is also responsible for producing cholesterol. It produces about 80% of the cholesterol in your body. The main disease of liver is Alcohol alters the metabolism of the liver, which can have overall detrimental effects if alcohol is taken over long periods of time<br>
Short-term effects<br>
Depending on how much you drink, your experience with alcohol and the environment in which you arc drinking, alcohol can cause:<br>
•	relaxation, feeling of well-being<br>
•	loss of inhibitions<br>
•	dizziness, unclear judgement<br>
•	uncoordinated movements, slow reactions<br>
•	blurred vision, slurred speech<br>
•	unconsciousness<br>
•	death<br>
Taurine or 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid- It is an organic acid. Taurine is one of the most abundant amino acids in the body. It is also a major constituent of bile and can be found in the lower intestine and in small amounts in the tissues of many animals, including humans. Taurine is a derivative of the sulfur-containing (sulfhydryl) amino acid, cysteine. Taurine is one of the few known naturally occurring sulfonic acids. It has a number of roles regarding normal functioning of the brain, heart, gallbladder, eyes and vascular system. It functions to facilitate the movement of mineral and salt ions in and out of the cells and to stabilize cell membranes. Among several taurine derivatives, Ca N-acetylhomotaurinate (Ca AOTA) appears to be the most active anti-acetaldehyde and anti-alcohol agent. Large numbers of 1 taurine derivatives have been reported in the literature with partial to marked activity. Taurine derivatives like taltrimide, acamprosate and tauromustine, are already in the market as anticonvulsant, anti-alcoholic and anti-cancer agents. Taurine derivatives like taltrimide, acamprosate and tauromustine, are already in the market as anticonvulsant, anti-alcoholic and anti¬cancer agents.<br>
MECHANISM OF TAURINE -<br><br><br>
Taurine can either promote or repress the reward effects associated with alcohol, the delineating factor being the amount of alcohol consumed. Its major metabolite taurocholic acid is responsible for the metabolic conversion of alcohol. The correlation of taurine with alcohol consumption, scientists synthesized the drug acamprosate, the calcium salt of N-acetyl-homotaurinate. It is the first agent specifically designed to maintain abstinence in alcohol-dependent patients who have completed detoxification. It interacts with glutamanergic neurotransmission channels (NMDA receptors) to reduce calcium flux., resulting in a depressed interest in alcohol consumption.Acomprosate decreases glutamate elevations that are characteristic of alcohol withdrawal. It's also use for Hepatic steatosis (Tatty liver') and lipid peroxidation by administering alcohol .hepatic steatosis was greatly reduced and lipid per oxidation completely prevented. Fatty liver was prevented in animals receiving taurine supplementation. The protective effect of taurine was attributed to the potential of taurine conjugated bile acids (particularly taurocholic acid) to inhibit adverse enzymatic functions associated with alcohol consumption. This elucidates the very crucial tasks that taurine performs to protect against the deleterious effects of chronic alcohol consumption.<br>
RACE- METHIONINE (Essential)<br>
1 .-Methionine has antioxidant properties. Methionine is one of the three amino acids needed by the body to manufacture Creatine, an amino acid essential for energy production and muscle building<br>
MECHANISM OF RACE-METHIONINE<br>
It prevents disorders of the hair, skin and nails, helps lower cholesterol levels by increasing the liver's production of lecithin, reduces liver fat and protects the kidneys. Methionine is a natural chelating agent for heavy metals. It regulates the formation of ammonia and creates ammonia-free urine, which reduces bladder irritation.<br>
Methionine is used in the liver as a detoxifying agent. It has also been used to treat depression, arthritis pain and chronic liver disease.<br>
