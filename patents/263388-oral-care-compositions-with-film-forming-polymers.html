				<td>ORAL CARE COMPOSITIONS WITH FILM FORMING POLYMERS<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
	The present invention relates to oral care compositions<br>
comprising certain polymers. Embodiments of the present invention include compositions comprising film forming polymers, and methods for whitening teeth using such compositions.<br>
	Many individuals desire a "bright" smile and white teeth,<br>
and consider dull and stained teeth cosmetically unattractive. Unfortunately, without preventive or remedial measures, stained teeth are almost inevitable due to the absorbent nature of dental material. Everyday activities such as smoking or other oral use of tobacco products, and eating, chewing or drinking certain foods and beverages (in particular coffee, tea and red wine), cause undesirable staining of surfaces of teeth. Staining can also result from microbial activity, including that associated with dental plaque. "The chromogens or color causing substances in these materials become part of the pellicle layer and can permeate the enamel layer. Even with regular brushing and flossing, years of chromogen accumulation can impart noticeable tooth discoloration.<br>
	A tooth is comprised of an inner dentin layer and an outer<br>
hard enamel layer that is the protective layer of the tooth. The enamel layer of a tooth is naturally opaque, and white or a slightly off-white color. The enamel layer is composed of hydroxyapatite mineral crystals that create a somewhat porous surface. These hydroxyapatite crystals form microscopic hexagonal rods or prisms that make<br>
up the enamel surface. As a result, the surface of the enamel presents microscopic spaces or pores between the prisms. Without limiting the composition, mechanisni or utility of present invention, it is believed that this porous nature of the enamel is where discoloring substances permeate the enamel and discolor the teeth.<br>
	There are a variety of compositions described in the art for<br>
preventing or treating the discoloration of teeth. In particular, to combat staining and brighten or restore the natural enamel color, a variety of products containing bleaching materials are commercially available for professional and consumer use. The most commonly accepted chemicals used in teeth whitening today are peroxides. Peroxides are generally deemed safe from a physiological standpoint, and can be effective to whiten teeth. Such peroxides include hydrogen peroxide, carbamide peroxide, sodium perborate, and sodium percarbonate. When these peroxides are in appropriate contact with teeth they will usually oxidize stains, rendering the teeth whiter.<br>
	Many professional dental treatments include a tooth surface<br>
preparation step, such as acid etching, followed by the application of highly concentrated bleaching solutions (e.g., up to 37% hydrogen peroxide) and/or the application of heat or light. (See, e.g., U.S. Patents 5,425,953 and 5,766,574.) These procedures provide rapid results, but are expensive and often require several trips to the dentist. In many treatments, the patient's lips are uncomfortably retracted and the patient is confined to sitting in the dental chair.<br>
	Alternatively, at home bleaching systems can be used.<br>
These systems have gained significant popularity in the past decade because cf<br><br>
reduced cost, and increased convenience. Instead of time consuming and frequent trips to the dentist, the tooth whitener is purchased at a consumer retail store and may be used while performing other personal tasks or errands, relaxing or sleeping.<br>
	Current   home   treatment   methods   include   abrasive<br>
toothpastes, toothpastes that produce oxides, whitening gels for use with a dental tray and whitening strips. The effectiveness of such techniques depends on a variety of factors including the type and intensity of the stain, bleaching agent contact time on the teeth, the amount of available bleaching active in the composition, and consumer compliance. Effectiveness is also dependant on the amount of bleaching active in the composition, the ability of the active to be released during use, and the stability of the active in the product. However, the effectiveness of many of these treatments is adversely affected because of deficiencies in one or more factors relating to the composition and consumer compliance.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
	The present invention provides oral care compositions.<br>
Embodiments include oral care compositions comprising:<br>
a)	an oral care active; and<br>
b)	an acrylic film forming polymer.<br>
In various embodiments, such polymers comprise monomeric units selected from the<br>
Â«<br>
group consisting of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acrylates (including methacrylates), and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the film forming polymer comprises a copolymer of a first monomeric unit selected from the group<br>
consisting of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, and combinations thereof, with a second monomeric unit selected from the group consisting of acrylates, acrylamides, acetates, and combinations thereof. In various embodiments, the polymer is a terpolymer comprising a combination of the second monomeric units. Preferably, the composition additionally comprises a lower alcohol, preferably ethanol.<br>
	In various embodiments, the present invention provides a<br>
whitening composition, wherein the oral care active comprises material, such as a peroxide, that is effective to whiten a tooth surface to which the application is applied. In one embodiment, the present invention provides oral care compositions comprising:<br>
a)	a  peroxide   composite   comprising   hydrogen  peroxide   and   an  N-vinyl<br>
heterocyclic polymer; and<br>
b)	an acrylic acid polymer comprising a copolymer of a first monomeric unit<br>
selected from the group consisting of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, and<br>
combinations thereof, with a second monomeric unit selected from the group<br>
consisting of acrylates, acrylamides, acetates, and combinations thereof.<br>
Methods are also provided for whitening a tooth surface, comprising applying a composition comprising a safe and effective amount of a whitening active, such as a peroxide composite, and an acrylic acid polymer.<br>
	It has been discovered that compositions and methods of<br>
this invention afford advantages over oral care compositions among those known in the art. Such compositions comprising a whitening active may exhibit one or more of such benefits, including enhanced whitening efficacy, providing a higher available<br>
concentration of bleaching agent, tooth adherence in the presence of saliva without the use of a dental tray and release of the bleaching agent over a period of time Further uses, benefits and embodiments of the present invention are apparent from the description set forth herein.<br>

	Preferably,   the   polymer   carrier   is   alcohol   soluble,<br>
substantially water insoluble, substantive to the teeth or other surfaces of the oral cavity, and stable to the active material (e.g., peroxide). Preferably such compositions do not exhibit adverse aesthetic effects, such as with respect to taste and mouthfeel (e.g., do not exhibit stickiness to surfaces other than those to which they are applied, or unpleasant texture). Without limiting the composition, method or utility of the present invention, it is believed in various embodiments the polymer have the characteristics of providing a film that is secured against the dental surface. Such embodiments comprise:<br>
a)	an active material; and<br>
b)	a polymer comprising a hydrophobic moiety and a calcium complexation<br>
moiety.<br>

	The compositions of the present invention comprise an<br>
active material, which is operable for the prevention or treatment of a condition or disorder of hard or soft tissue of the oral cavity, the prevention or treatment of a physiological disorder or condition, or to provide a cosmetic benefit. In various embodiments, the active is a "systemic active"1 which is operable to treat or prevent a disorder which, in whole or in part, is not a disorder of the oral cavity. In various embodiments, the active is an "oral care active" operable to treat or prevent a disorder or provide a cosmetic benefit within the oral cavity (e.g., to the teeth, gingival or other hard or soft tissue of the oral cavity). Oral care actives among those useful herein include whitening agents, anticaries agents, tartar control agents, antiplaque agents, periodontal actives, abrasives, breath freshening agents, malodor control agents, tooth desensitizers, salivary stimulants, and combinations thereof. It is understood that while general attributes of each of the above categories of actives may differ, there may some common attributes and any given material may serve<br><br>
multiple purposes within twc or more of such categories of actives. Preferably, such actives are selected for compatibility with the peroxide complex, peroxide compound., and with other ingredients of the composition. Actives among those useful herein are disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication 2003/0206874, Doyle et al., published November 6, 2003; U.S. Patent 6,290, 933, Durga et al., issued September 18, 2001; and U.S. Patent 6,685,921, Lawlor, issued February 3, 2004.<br>
	Actives useful herein are optionally present in the<br>
compositions of the present invention in safe and effective amounts. A "safe and effective" amount of an active is an amount that is sufficient to have the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect in the human or lower animal subject to whom the active is administered, without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity, irritation, or allergic response), commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio when used in the manner of this invention. The specific safe and effective amount of the active will vary with such factors as the particular condition being treated, the physical condition of the subject, the nature of concurrent therapy (if any), the specific active used, the specific dosage form, the carrier employed, and the desired dosage regimen.<br>

	Embodiments containing poly-N-vmyl polylactams,<br>
include but are not limited to poly-N-vinyl pyrrolidone, poly-N-vinyl-2-piperidone, poly-N-vinyl-2-caprolactam, poly-N-vinyl-3-methyl-2-caprolacam, poly-N-vinyl-3-methyl-2-piperidone, poly-N-vinyl-4-methyl-2-piperidone, poly-N-vinyl-4-methyl-2-caprolactam, poly-N-vinyl-3-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone, poly-N-vinyl-4,5-dimethyl-2-pyrrolidone and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the polymer is selected from the group consisting of poly-N-vinyl poly-2-pyrrolidone, poly-N-vinyl-poly-2-piperidone, poly-N-vinyl-poly-2-caprolactam and mixtures thereof.<br>
	In a preferred embodiment, the polymer is poly-N-vinyl -<br>
poly-2-pyrrolidone. The poly-N-vinyl-poly-2-pyrrolidone is also commonly known as polyvinylpyrrolidone or "PVP". PVP refers to a polymer containing vinylpyrrolidone (also referred to as N-vinylpyrrolidone, N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidione and N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone) as a monomeric unit. The monomeric unit consists of a polar imide group, four non-polar methylene groups and a non-polar methane group. The polymers include soluble and insoluble homopolymeric PVPs. Copolymers containing PVP include vinylpyrrolidone/vinyl acetate (also known as Copolyvidone, Copolyvidonum or VP-VAc) and vinylpyrrolidone/dimethylamino-ethylmethacrylate.	Soluble PVP polymers among those useful herein are<br>
known in the art, including Povidone, Polyvidone, Polyvidonum, poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone), poly (N-vinylbutyrolactam), poly(l-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) and poly [1-(2-oxo-lpyrrolidinyl)ethylene]. These PVP polymers are not substantially cross-linked.<br>
	In various embodiments of this invention, an insoluble<br>
cross-linked homopolymer is preferred. Such polymers include those common referred to in the art as polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, cross-povidone, PVP and cPVP, and are referred to herein as "cPVP". The homopolymer is prepared by free radical polymerization of the monomer vinylpyrrolidone.<br>
	In one embodiment, the poly-N-vinyl-poly-2-pyrrolidone<br>
has a lactam of the pyrrolidone ring that provides the hydrophilic characteristics. Without limiting the composition, mechanism or utility of the invention, it is believed that such groups allow the peroxide compound to bind to the cPVP. The hydrophobic characteristics attributed to the methylene groups in the ring and the linear aliphatic backbone prevent the peroxide complex from reacting with saliva while still maintaining the peroxide available to whiten the teeth. The surface characteristics of the cPVP serve as a barrier to the passage of the peroxide component and prevents the premature distribution of the peroxide component upon application of the oral care composition in the oral cavity. The cPVP linked peroxide is released over a period of time through diffusion, temperature variance, moisture levels and other factors.<br>
	The cPVP is a white or slightly yellow hygroscopic<br>
powder. As used herein, "hygroscopic" refers to the property of readily absorbing<br>
moisture. In various embodiments, the polymer has a moisture absorption of from about 10% to about 40% by weight of the peroxide compound.<br>
	cPVP is particularly suitable for trapping a peroxide to<br>
form a peroxide polymer composite. Without limiting the composition, mechanism or utility of the present invention, it is believed in various embodiments that the surface characteristics of the cross-linked polymer serves as a barrier to the prssage of the peroxide and prevents the premature distribution of the peroxide upon application of the oral care composition to the oral cavity, while maintaining the peroxide available to whiten the teeth.. The cPVP linked peroxide is released over a period of time through diffusion, temperature variance, moisture levels and other factors. This provides a significant advantage over other oral whitening compositions.<br>
	The polymer particulates useful herein are made by well<br>
established processes. The poly-N-vinyl polylactams are produced by polymerizing a vinyl lactam in the presence of an alkaline catalyst. (See U.S. Patents 2,938,017, Grosser, et al, issued May 24, 1960; 3,277,066, Grosser, et al, issued October 4, 1966 and 3,306,886, Grosser, et al, issued February 28, 1967). Embodiments containing poly-N-vinyl polyimides are produced by heating an N-vinyl imide in the presence of a catalyst. (See U.S. Patent No. 3,306,881, Grosser, et al, issued February 28, 1967). In alternative embodiments comprising a co-polymer of the N-vinyl heterocyclic compound is produced by polymerizing N-vinyl heterocyclic and dissimilar vinyl monomers. (See U.S. Patent Nos. 2,667,473, Morner, et al, issued January 26, 1954; and 2,947,633, Perry et al, issued August 2, 1960).<br><br>

to, silicone adhesives, silicone elastomers, silicone fluids, silicone resins, silicone gums and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the carrier comprises a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) composition, including those that are well known in the art. Generally, silicone based PSA's are produced by condensing a silicone resin and an organosiloxane such as a polydiorganosiloxane. Suitable silicone polymers include the copolymer product of mixing a silanol terminated polydiorganosiloxane such as polydimethyl siloxane with a silanol-containing silicone resin whereby the silanol groups of the polydiorganosiloxane undergo a condensation reaction with the filanol groups of the silicone resin so that the polydiorganosiloxane is lightly cross-linked by the silicone resin (that is, the polydiorganosiloxane chains are bonded together through the resin molecules to give chain branching and entanglement and/or a small amount of network character) to form the silicone pressure sensitive adhesive. A catalyst, for example an alkaline material such as ammonia, ammonium hydroxide or ammonium carbonate can be mixed with the silanol-terminated polydiorganosiloxane<br><br>
and the silicone resin to promote this cross-linking reaction. Copolymerizing the silicone resin with the silanol terminated polydiorganosiloxane affords a self adhering property and cohesive soft elastomer matrix. Modifying the silicone resin to polydiorganosiloxane ratio of the pressure sensitive adhesive will modify the tackiness of the oral care composition. For example PSAs are available from the Dow-Corning Corporation, Midland, Michigan, U.S.A., under the brand name BIO-PSA. A preferred adhesion agent is Dow Corning Silicone Adhesive 8-7016 marketed by Dow-Corning Corporation.

Methods<br>
	The present invention provides methods for whitening a<br>
tooth surface using compositions according to the present invention. As referred to herein, "tooth" or "teeth" refers to natural teeth, dentures, dental plates, fillings, caps, crowns, bridges, dental implants,, and the like, and any other hard surfaced dental prosthesis either permanently or temporarily fixed within the oral cavity. As used herein, "whitening" refers to a change in visual appearance of a tooth, preferably such that such that the tooth has a brighter shade. Increase in whiteness of a dental surface can be observed visually, for example with the aid of color comparison charts or gauges, or measured by colorimetry, using any suitable instrument such as a Minolta Chromameter, e.g., model CR-400 (Minolta Corp., Ramsey, NJ). The instrument can be programmed, for example, to measure Hunter Lab values or L*a*b* values according to the standard established by the International Committee of Illumination (CIE). The L*a*b* system provides a numerical representation of three-dimensional color space where L* represents a lightness axis, a* represents a red-green axis and b* represents a yellow-blue axis. The L* and b* axes are typically of greatest applicability to measurement of tooth whiteness. Increase in whiteness can be computed from differences in L*, a* and b* values before and after treatment, or between untreated and treated surfaces. A useful parameter is AE*, calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of differences in L*, a* and b* values, using the (Formula remove)<br>
A higher value of AE* indicates greater increase in whiteness. In various embodiments, the method of the present invention can effect a AE* of at least about 1, or at least about 3, or at least about 4, or at least about S.<br>
	Accordingly, the present invention provides methods for<br>
whitening a tooth surface, comprising applying to the surface a safe and effective amount of a peroxide compound or peroxide complex and an acrylic acid polymer. Preferably the method comprises applying a composition of the present invention. As referred to herein, "applying" refers to any method by which the peroxide complex is placed in contact with the tooth surface. Such methods, in various embodiments, comprise direct application of a composition by such methods as rinsing, painting, and brushing. In various embodiments, application of the composition comprises the use of an application device which aids in maintaining contact of the complex to the tooth surface for sufficient time so as to allow whitening.<br>
	Suitable application devices include dental trays,<br>
mouthpieces, floss, fibers, chips, strips and tapes. Strips among those useful herein comprise polymers, natural and synthetic woven materials, non-woven material, foil, paper, rubber and combinations thereof. Preferably the strip of material is substantially water insoluble. Suitable polymers include polyethylene, ethylvinylacetate, polyesters, ethylvinyl alcohol, fluoroplastics, and combinations thereof In various embodiments, the strip of material is generally less than about 1 mm (millimeter) thick, optionally less than about 0.05 mm thick, optionally about 0.001 to about 0.03 mm thick. The shape of the strip is any shape and size that covers the desired oral surface. In one embodiment, the length of the strip material is from<br>
about 2 cm (centimeter) to about 12 cm, in another embodiment from about 4 cm to about 9 cm. The width of the strip material will also depend on the oral surface area to be covered. The width of the strip is generally from about 0.5 cm to about 4 cm, in one embodiment from about 1 cm to about 2 cm. The strip material may comprise shallow pockets, optionally filled by a composition of this invention so as to provide reservoirs of peroxide complex. Strips among those useful herein are disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,514,484, Rajaiah et al. issued February 4, 2003.<br>
	In one preferred embodiment, the whitening composition is<br>
applied using a "paint on" technique. A small application device, such as a brush or spatula is coated with a composition of this invention and the composition is then placed on a tooth surface. Preferably, the composition be spread evenly on such surfaces, in sufficient quantity to deliver a whitening amount of the peroxide complex.<br>
	The present invention also provides methods for effecting<br>
the controlled release of an oxidizing peroxide species onto a tooth surface, comprising contacting the surface with a peroxide composite of the present invention. As referred to herein, such controlled release in various embodiments comprises sustained release of the peroxide complex. Without limiting the mechanism, function or utility of present invention, in some embodiments contact with saliva causes the release of an effective amount of peroxide active from the cross-linked polymer matrix to the applied tooth site over a period of time.. Preferably, the composition is contacted with the tooth surface for at least about 30 seconds, optionally at least about 1 minute.<br>
	In various embodiments, it is preferred that the subject does<br>
not eat or drink while the composition is in contact with the dental surface. The whitening composition can be removed as and when required, at will, by an employment of standard oral hygiene procedures such as brushing or by rinsing, e.g., with a mouthwash. The process can be repeated several times until the desired whitening results are achieved.<br>

Such methods include those disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication 2003/0206874, Doyle et al., published November 6,2003.The present invention is further illustrated through the following non-limiting Examples.ample 1 A composition of the present The VS-80 adhesive polymer is dissolved in the ethyl alcohol. The Pluraflo and petrolatum are then added and the solution is mixed for five minutes. The peroxide is added and the solution is mixed for 20 minutes until the mixture is homogenous. <br><br><br><br><br>
The composition  is made by a process generally as described above in Example 1.<br>
] The composition is made by a process generally as described above in Example 1. The composition is subjected to accelerated aging (105/120) for several weeks, and remains stable with more than 90% of the peroxide<br>
remaining.<br><br>
The composition is made by a process generally as described above in Example 1. The whitening efficacy of the composition is determined using a duplicate pair of flow cells designed to accommodate a total of eight bovine enamel blocks (four in each cell). The bovine enamel blocks are stained using an established staining protocol (Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN). The initial L*, a* and b* values are matched as closely as possible using a chromometer (Minolta CR-321) based on initial L*, a* and b*. values (CIELAB). These initial values are typically L* = 25.00, a* = 3.00, and b* = 5,000 to L* = 35.00, a* = 5.00, and b* - 7.00. The L, a, b values are measured four times at slightly differing locations on the surface of the bovine enamel blocks.<br>
To simulate the saliva of the human mouth, an artificial saliva buffer solution maintained at 37Â°C is prepared which contains the salts usually present in saliva at levels typical to the levels found in human saliva. The bovine enamel blocks are placed in the flow cells and the compositions evenly applied using a brush, the amount of product applied is determined using the weight difference of the container. Flow over the teeth is 0.6 ml/min. for 30 min. Average initial (i) and<br><br>
final (f) chromometer readings are used to calculate AE = ((Lf- Li)2 + (bf- bi)2 + (ar aj). The final AE reported was the average overall observations after the rejection of outliers using the Student's test (95% confidence level). The results of the test, set forth in the following table, show that the composition has a whitening effect. The composition of this Example is tested accordingly, and is found to have a AE value of about 10.<br>
