				<td>Description<br>
Electric automation device and method for adjusting the<br>
functions of the electric automation device<br>
The invention relates to an electric automation device with a<br>
control unit that is controlled by a computer.<br>
Electric automation devices, such as for example electric<br>
protection devices or bay controllers of substation automation<br>
technology, usually have computer-controlled control units.<br>
With the aid of software installed in the control unit, the<br>
respective functions of such an automation device can be<br>
defined and performed. The software is usually completely<br>
embedded in the control unit of the electric automation device<br>
and with it forms what is known as an "embedded system". A<br>
further example of known automation devices of the<br>
aforementioned type are software-controlled production robots.<br>
If an electric protection device is taken as an example of an<br>
electric automation device, specifically a distance protection<br>
device, it is possible for example for instructions with<br>
respect to the di'stance protection functions of the automatior.<br>
device and communication instructions to be contained in the<br>
software. The precise definition of the functions of the<br>
automation device is already provided by the user cf the<br>
automation device at the time of ordering the automation device<br>
from its manufacturer.<br>
Previous electric automation devices, in particular in tr.e area<br>
of protection devices and bay controllers, have been developed<br>
by the manufacturer<br>
in their entirety with a device-related software package and<br>
must be fully tested for the correctness and reliability of all<br>
functions. Such a procedure involves considerable cost and<br>
time.<br>
Starting out from an electric automation device of the type<br>
just described, the invention is based on the object of<br>
providing an electric automation device which can be adapted to<br>
predefined functions flexibly and with reduced testing!.<br>
To achieve this object, it is proposed in the case of an<br>
electric automation device of the aforementioned type that a<br>
computer hardware component is provided with a control software<br>
component which has a basic functional area comprising an<br>
operating system, device drivers and communication modules, so<br>
as to form a basic automation device, and that the basic<br>
automation device is completed with any application modules<br>
that can be connected to the basic functional area via a<br>
software interface to obtain the/automation device.<br>
The main advantage of the automation device according to the<br>
invention is that identical basic automation devices, provided<br>
with components that are common to all automation devices (for<br>
example the operating system, device drivers, application<br>
modules) are produced as a series and can be adapted as desired<br>
- that is to say flexibly - to required functions by using<br>
various application modules By this adaptation, the<br>
respective basic automation device is in each case completed to<br>
form the actual automation device. Regarded as device drivers<br>
in this connection<br>
are programs for the software-instigated activation of further<br>
electronic devices of the respective electric automation<br>
device; communication modules control, for. example, the<br>
internal device communication between the basic functional area<br>
of the control software and any application modules that can be<br>
connected to the basic functional area via the software<br>
interface.<br>
The application modules may in this case be incorporated in a<br>
modular manner in the control software via the software<br>
interface. The final functions of the automation device are<br>
determined by the selection of these application modules.<br>
The entire basic automation device remains largely unchanged<br>
when producing any desired automation devices; therefore - if<br>
tried-and-tested basic automation devices are used - no further<br>
functional tests have to be carried out with respect to the<br>
components of the basic automation device, which significantly<br>
reduces the testing for the respective automation device.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the automation<br>
device according to the invention, for the various functions of<br>
the automation device there are correspondingly various<br>
application modules. According to this embodiment, the<br>
application modules advantageously represent self-contained<br>
functional units which in each case undertake a function (for<br>
example external communication, protective functions, timing<br>
operations) of the electric automation device. Since,<br>
moreover, tried-and-tested application modules can be used as<br>
application modules, the testing for the final automation<br>
device is further reduced significantly by this embodiment.<br>
The electric automation device may be, for example, an electric<br>
protection device or bay controller. Such devices comprise a<br>
large number of extremely varied functions, so that a<br>
configuration according to the invention with flexible<br>
functional adaptation is of great interest here.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to provide a method with<br>
which an electric automation device can be produced flexibly<br>
with respect to predefined functions.<br>
To achieve this object, a method for adjusting the functions of<br>
an electric automation device with a control unit having a<br>
computer, the following steps being carried out: transfer of at<br>
least one application module, which has been modified using a<br>
starting application module, to a basic automation device,<br>
which is provided with a computer hardware component and a<br>
software component, which has a basic functional area<br>
comprising, an operating system, device drivers and<br>
communication modules, and performance of adjusting<br>
instructions of the at least one modified application module, so<br>
as to complete the electric automation device, the at least one<br>
modified application module being incorporated into the control<br>
software so as to adjust at least one function of the<br>
automation device.<br>
In this way, an automation device can be flexibly adapted to<br>
predefined functions by using modular modified application<br>
modules respectively describing a single function of the<br>
automation device. Furthermore, in this way it is<br>
advantageously possible, if there is a single modified<br>
application<br>
module, to produce an entire series of identical automation<br>
devices; for this purpose, the modified application module (or<br>
in each case a copy thereof) only has to be transferred to all<br>
the basic automation devices of this series.<br>
To produce the modified application module, at least one<br>
starting application module, having configuration and<br>
adjustment instructions, may advantageously be loaded into a<br>
memory area of a data-processing unit simulating the basic<br>
automation device, and the configuration instructions of the at<br>
least one starting application module may be performed by means<br>
of the data-processing unit so as to form the modified<br>
application module while defining the functions of the electric<br>
automation device.<br>
By performing configuration instructions already contained in<br>
the starting application module on a data-processing unit which<br>
simulates a basic automation device, all th.e ihain adjustments<br>
with respect to the various functions - formed by the<br>
respective application modules - of the automation device to be<br>
produced can advantageously be performed already -outside the<br>
basic automation device. This is so because a data-processing<br>
unit usually offers an environment which is significantly more<br>
convenient and powerful with respect to its functionality than<br>
the basic automation devices.<br>
Furthermore, it may advantageously be provided that the XML<br>
format is used for the at least one starting application<br>
module. In the XML format, it is possible in a simple way<br>
to produce structured data and instructions for the control<br>
software.<br>
A further solution achieving the object with respect to the<br>
method is provided by a method for adjusting the functions of<br>
an electric automation device with a control unit having a<br>
computer, the following steps being carried out: loading of at<br>
least one starting application module, having configuration and<br>
adjustment instructions, into a memory area of the control<br>
unit, which interacts with a control software component of a<br>
basic automation device containing a computer hardware<br>
component, the control software component having a basic<br>
functional area comprising an operating system, device drivers<br>
and communication modules, performance of the configuration<br>
instructions of the at least one starting application module by<br>
means of the control unit so as to form a modified application<br>
module while defining the functions of the electric automation<br>
device and performance of the adjustment instructions of the at<br>
least one modified application module so as to complete the<br>
electric automation device, the at least one modified<br>
application module being incorporated in the control software<br>
component so as to adjust at least one function of the<br>
automation device.<br>
In this way, in particular those basic automation devices whicr.<br>
have similarly powerful operator-control possibilities and<br>
functionalities as a customary data-processing unit can be<br>
advantageously completed with respect to their functions tc<br>
obtain an automation device.<br>
For further explanation of the invention,<br>
Figure 1 schematically shows the construction of an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the electric automation device<br>
according to the invention,<br>
Figure 2 schematically shows an exemplary embodiment of a<br>
method according to the invention for adjusting the<br>
functions of an electric automation device and<br>
Figure 3 shows a further exemplary embodiment of a further<br>
method according to the invention for adjusting the<br>
functions of an electric automation device.<br>
Figure 1 schematically shows the construction of an electric<br>
automation device. Here, what is known as a basic automation<br>
device- 1 comprises a computer hardware component 2, which is<br>
provided with a control software component with a basic<br>
functional area, comprising an operating system 3, device<br>
drivers 4 and communication modules 5. In this case, both a<br>
single computing module, such as for example a microprocessor,<br>
and a system comprising a number of circuit modules, such as<br>
for example various processors and coprocessors, may act as the<br>
computer hardware component 2. The control software component<br>
also has a software interface 6.<br>
However, such a basic automation device 1 does not yet have any<br>
specific functions for the actual automation device; instead,<br>
it represents a kind of basic device for automation devices.<br>
To realize specific functions, the software interface 6 can be<br>
used to connect individual<br>
application modules. 7a, 7b, 7c, 8 and 9 to the basic functional<br>
area of the control software.<br>
This is to be explained in more detail on the basis of the<br>
following example. An electric protection device for the<br>
protection and monitoring of electrical equipment such as<br>
electric power supply lines or electrical machines will be<br>
assumed as the electric automation device. The electric<br>
protection device is initially in the form of a basic<br>
automation device 1. Such a basic automation device 1 does not<br>
yet have any specific functions for an electric protection<br>
device. Rather, it represents a basic device, which forms a<br>
flexible basis for a protection device that can be adapted as<br>
desired with regard to its functions. So it is possible for<br>
example for a manufacturer of electric protection devices to<br>
provide an (already existing) electric basic automation device<br>
1 with a range of functions desired by a customer in a<br>
comparatively uncomplicated way.<br>
In order to complete the basic automation device 1 to obtain a<br>
protection device with its respective specific functions, it<br>
can in fact be provided with various types of application,<br>
modules 7a, 7b, 7c, 8, 9, which in themselves respectively<br>
represent an individual function of the electric protection<br>
device. These application modules 7a, 7b, 1c, 8, 9 can be<br>
connected to the basic functional area of the control software<br>
via the software interface 6. Such software interfaces (also<br>
known as "API" = "application program interface") are known per<br>
se to a person skilled in the art; they may be formed either by<br>
a single central software interface or else for example by<br>
various distributed software subinterfaces.<br>
In the case of the protection device, it is possible for<br>
example for the application modules 7a, 7b and 7c (cf. Figure<br>
1) to comprise individual protection algorithms and methods of<br>
protection of the electric protection device, such as for<br>
example a time overcurrent protection. A further application<br>
module 8 may be a recording module for recording selected<br>
voltage or current variations; in turn, a further application<br>
module 9 may comprise communication modalities with an external<br>
device, for example a measuring transducer. The selection of<br>
corresponding application modules allows the range of functions<br>
of an electric protection device to be created, extended or<br>
adapted as desired in the same way as in a modular system.<br>
Apart from the modular and flexible construction, the reduced<br>
testing for the electric protection device or the electric<br>
automation device is of special advantage in particular. This<br>
is - so because, while in the case of an automation device<br>
•according to the prior art, which is specifically provided with<br>
a complete software package specifically developed for it<br>
according to the application, a test run of all the functions<br>
and components (nardware and software) of the automation device<br>
must be carried out, in the case of the automation device<br>
according to the invention it is possible for example for the<br>
basic automation device 1 already to be available in a trice<br>
and-tested form, so that there is consequently no need for<br>
testing for this area including the computer hardware 2,<br>
operating system 3, device drivers 4 and commutation modules 4.<br>
Furthermore, it is also possible to have the individual<br>
application modules 7a, 7b, 7c, 8, 9 already in a prefabricated<br>
and tested form, so that only after the basic automation device<br>
1 has been completed by the corresponding application modules<br>
7a, 7b, 7c, 8, 9 to obtain the<br>
automation device does a functional test of the specific device<br>
functions have to be carried out. This allows costly and time-<br>
consuming test runs to be significantly reduced.<br>
The information content of the application modules may, for<br>
example, be in a form based on the XML format. In the XLM<br>
format, data and information can be given in a structured<br>
manner in a form that is independent of the device. The<br>
"translation" of the XML format can be ensured for example by<br>
the communication modules 5 or the operating system 2 of the<br>
basic functional area of the control software.<br>
In a particularly advantageous way, the described construction<br>
of an electric automation device can be used whenever<br>
manufacturers and users of such automation devices have agreed<br>
to a uniform standard for the representation and modeling of<br>
data and information and also their communication between<br>
individual devices. This is expected to be accomplished with<br>
the standard IEC 61850. Among the aspects regulated by the IEC<br>
standard 61850 is the data model of the application area of<br>
automation devices, so that, when configurations conforming to<br>
the standard are used, it is advantageously ensured that there<br>
is compatibility between devices and control software from<br>
different manufacturers.<br>
Figure 2 schematically shows a method for producing and<br>
adjusting the specific functions of an electric automation<br>
device. The method is to be explained by way of example for<br>
the application module 7a according to Figure 1.<br>
A starting (software) application module 10 that is initially<br>
available is assumed to contain configuration instructions 12<br>
and adjustment instructions 14. This starting applicaticr.<br>
module<br>
10 is loaded into a memory area of a data processing unit 12 in<br>
a loading operation indicated by a dashed arrow 11.<br>
The data processing unit 12, which may for example be a<br>
correspondingly set-up PC, additionally simulates a basic<br>
automation device 1 (cf. Figure 1) with a computer hardware<br>
component 2, an operating system 3, device drivers 4 and<br>
communication modules 5.<br>
In a configuration step which then follows, the configuration<br>
instructions 13 of the starting application module 10 are<br>
performed, which is indicated by a further arrow 15. The<br>
performance of the configuration instructions 13 has the effect<br>
of incorporating the starting application module 10 in the<br>
control software of the simulated basic automation device via<br>
the software interface 6. At the same time, adjustments are<br>
carried out, for example with respect to the activation of the<br>
starting application module 10, its operator display and<br>
important parameters. Currently, such a procedure takes place<br>
at the premises of the manufacturer of an electric automation<br>
device.<br>
Since, within the framework of the simulated basic automation<br>
device, the starting application module 10 is in this way<br>
connected to the basic functional area of the control software,<br>
it represents a modified application module. This is<br>
transferred in the format it then has to an (actual, basic<br>
automation device 1 (cf. Figure 1) (see arrow 16) . There, the<br>
modified application module 7a can be connected in a simple way<br>
to the basic functional area of the control software via the<br>
software interface 6. What is particularly advantageous about<br>
this is that the<br>
adjustments once made on the data processing unit 12 do not<br>
have to be repeated again on the basic automation device 1.<br>
The modified application module 7a is taken over into the basic<br>
automation device 1 in the form it has taken after performance<br>
of the configuration instructions 13 on the data processing<br>
unit 12. Subsequently, the adjustment instructions 14 already<br>
present in the starting application module 10 and also in the<br>
modified application module 7a can be performed, in order to<br>
make final adjustments. The user of an automation device<br>
usually has access to these adjustment instructions 14, in<br>
order for example to adapt a specific function to external<br>
conditions. The user can also change such adjustments again<br>
later, so that for example it is possible in this way to adapt<br>
an electric protection device to changed conducting conditions<br>
of a power transmission line that is to be monitored, such as<br>
for example a change in the length of line or the resistance of<br>
the power transmission line.<br>
After performing these final adjustment instructions 14, the<br>
basic automation device has been completed to obtain the actual<br>
automation device with its required range of functions.<br>
To produce a number of identical automation devices from<br>
identical basic automation devices 1, the procedure described<br>
can be repeated several times with new basic automation devices<br>
on each occasion. However, it is particularly advantageous to<br>
produce a modified application module (for example 7a) a single<br>
time, as described above, and transfer it to a number cf basic<br>
automation devices 1. In this way it is possible to dispense<br>
with the effort involved in producing a number of<br>
identical modified application modules.<br>
As an alternative to the adjustment method just explained, it<br>
may also be envisaged to load the starting application module<br>
10 directly into the basic automation device 1 and perform both<br>
the configuration instructions 13 and the adjustment<br>
instructions 14 there. This is represented in Figure 3. Here,<br>
the starting application module is loaded into a memory area 22<br>
of the control unit 23 of the basic automation device 1 in a<br>
loading operation represented by an arrow 21 that is indicated<br>
by dashed lines. In said memory area, the configuration<br>
instructions 13 of the starting application module 10 are first<br>
performed, as indicated by arrow 24. Here there takes place -<br>
as explained in connection with Figure 2 - on the one hand a<br>
definition of the range of functions of the automation device<br>
by selection of the corresponding starting application modules<br>
and incorporation of the respective starting application module<br>
in the basic automation device 1. At the same time,<br>
adjustments are carried out with respect to the activation of<br>
the starting application module 10, its operator display and<br>
important parameters. By this procedure, the starting<br>
application module becomes the modified application module.<br>
After that, the adjustment instructions 14 of the modified<br>
application module are performed with the same basic automation<br>
device and in this way the adjustments for adaptation to<br>
external conditions are made (as also explained in connection<br>
with Figure 2), whereby the basic automation device is<br>
completed to obtain the actual automation device.<br>
Such a procedure is suitable in particular if a basic<br>
automation device which can be operated comparatively well is<br>
available as the basic automation device. For example, such a<br>
basic automation device may be formed by an industrial PC. In<br>
this case, automation devices with the desired functions can<br>
also be produced on the user side by selection of various<br>
starting application modules and their integration in the basic<br>
automation device. Here, the user can take the necessary<br>
starting application modules for example from special software<br>
libraries in the form of standardized application modules.<br>

that is controlled by a computer. In order to create an automation device that<br>
can be set to predefined functions in a particularly flexible manner while<br>
requiring less testing, a computer hardware component (2) is provided with<br>
control software comprising a basic functional area which includes an operating<br>
system (3), a device driver (4), and communication modules (5) so as to form a<br>
basic automation device (1) while the basic automation device (1) is<br>
complemented with any application modules (7a, 7b, 7c, 8, 9) that can be<br>
connected to the basic functional area via a software interface (6) in order to<br>
obtain the automation device. The invention also relates to a method for<br>
producing or adjusting the functions of such an electric automation device.</td>
