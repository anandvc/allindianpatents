Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to receivers such as multi-carrier and cellular<br>
receivers.<br>
Background<br>
Cellular receivers, in the form of portable radiotelephones are commonplace,<br>
and their design and operation is well understood. Such portable<br>
radiotelephones can be used for making and receiving telephone calls,<br>
sending and receiving messages, and even browsing world-wide computer<br>
network such as the Internet. Many standards exist for portable<br>
radiotelephones, including global system for mobile communications (GSM),<br>
general radio packet service (GPRS)<br>
Receivers capable of receiving digital television signals, such as signals<br>
according to the terrestrial digital video broadcasting (DVB-T) standard are<br>
also commonplace.<br>
The use and operation of consumer set-top-boxes (STB) for receiving digital<br>
video broadcasting (DVB-T) transmissions are well known. Such STBs are<br>
capable of receiving a large number of digital television channels, data and<br>
other interactive services.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a mobile<br>
terminal having a first receiver for receiving an encrypted first signal from a<br>
first communications network and a second receiver for receiving from a<br>
second communications network a second signal conveying complementary<br>
information relating to said first signal, wherein the complementary information<br>
comprises information enabling said encrypted signal to be decrypted and<br>
mobile temriinal further comprising a subscriber identification module (SIM)<br>
2<br><br>
containing security data for use in conjunction with said second signal for<br>
enabling said encrypted first signal to be decrypted.<br>
Advantageously, the present invention provides a receiver having a first and a<br>
second receiver for receiving signals from two different communications<br>
networks. In a first embodiment of the present invention this results in<br>
increased power efficiency, since one of the receivers can be effectively<br>
switched off whilst not required. Schedule or configuration data can, however,<br>
still be received on the other receiver. The received schedule or configuration<br>
data can be used to switch on the other receiver at an appropriate time. This<br>
configuration allows the receiver to receive non-scheduled data, such as news<br>
flashes, results from sporting events, share prices etc.<br>
In a second embodiment of the present invention, a receiver is able to receive<br>
a broadcast signal via a broadcast network, and to receive additional and<br>
complementary information thereto via a second telecommunications network.<br>
This is particularly advantageous in security applications, where security keys<br>
and other private or sensitive data may be sent via a more private<br>
telecommunications network. For example, if a pay-per-view film is being<br>
broadcast in encrypted form, the security keys needed to decrypt the film may<br>
be sent via the second telecommunications network. This prevents the<br>
security keys from unauthorised access of the broadcast network.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided<br>
apparatus for transmitting an encrypted first signal on a first communications<br>
network, comprising: a further transmitter for transmitting on a second<br>
communications network complementary information relating to said<br>
encrypted first signal including information enabling said encrypted first signal<br>
to be decrypted, wherein said second signal used in conjunction with security<br>
data in a subscriber identification module (SIM) in a mobile terminal enables<br>
said encrypted first signal to be decrypted.<br>
3<br><br>
According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
method of receiving an encrypted first signal from a first communications<br>
network comprising: receiving from a second communications network a<br>
second signal conveying complementary information relating to said first<br>
signal, said information enabling said encrypted signal to be decrypted; and<br>
decrypting said encrypted first signal using said received information in<br>
conjunction with security data stored on a subscriber identification module<br>
(SIM).<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
method of transmitting an encrypted first signal on a first communications<br>
network,  comprising:  transmitting on  a  second  communications  network<br>
complementary information relating to said first signal enabling said encrypted<br>
signal to be decrypted and information including transmitting schedule and<br>
configuration data;<br>
storing details of subscriber preferences; and<br>
deciding whether to transmit said complementary infonnation to a subscriber<br>
in dependence on said stored preferences.<br>
According to a fifth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
terminal having a first receiver for receiving a first signal from a first<br>
communications network comprising: a second receiver for receiving a second<br>
signal conveying complementary information relating to said first signal from a<br>
second communications network.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the said complementary information from<br>
said second signal is combined with content in said first signal.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the complementary information in said<br>
second signal comprises schedule and configuration data relating to said first<br>
signal identifying the content in said first signal.<br><br>
According to a sixth aspect of the present invention, there is provided<br>
Apparatus for transmitting a signal to a receiver via a first communications<br>
network comprising: a transmitter for transmitting complementary information<br>
relating to said signal via a second communication network.<br>
According to a seventh aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
method of receiving a first signal from a first communications network<br>
comprising: receiving a second signal conveying complementary information<br>
relating to said first signal from a second communications network.<br>
According to a eighth aspect of the present invention, there is provided A<br>
method of transmitting a signal to a receiver via a first communications<br>
network comprising: transmitting complementary information relating to said<br>
signal via a second communication network.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
The invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference<br>
to the accompanying diagrams, in which:<br>
Figure  1   is a  block diagram of a typical consumer receiver/transmitter<br>
arrangement;<br>
Figure 2 is a block diagram of a first embodiment according to the present<br>
invention; and<br>
Figure 3 is a block diagram of yet a further embodiment according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
Detailed description<br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram of a typical consumer receiver/transmitter<br>
arrangement in which a terrestrial digital video broadcasting (DVB-T)<br>
transmitter 150 transmits a DVB-T signal to a DVB-T set-top-box receiver 106.<br>
5<br><br>
In the transmitter 150, a number of television channels 154 and 156 are<br>
multiplexed together with a number of data channels 158 and 160 by a<br>
multiplexer 152. in addition to this, service information (SI) 162, which<br>
contains details of each of the other multiplexed channels, is also input to the<br>
multiplexer 152, provided by a SI generator 164. The multiplexer creates a<br>
single, multiplexed, signal 166 which contains all of the separate channels<br>
154, 156, 158 and 160, along with the SI 162. Further details of the<br>
multiplexing and SI may be found in the DVB-T specification (EN 300 468)<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference. The multiplexed signal 166 is<br>
transmitted via an antenna 164, across a transmission channel, to an antenna<br>
102 of a set-top-box receiver 106. In the case of DVB-T, the transmission<br>
channel is a terrestrial transmission channel. However, the transmission<br>
channel could, altematively, be a satellite, microwave, cable or optical<br>
channel.<br>
The signals received by the antenna 102 are input to a DVB-T receiver 100<br>
which enables the user to select a desired channel. Received data may also<br>
be stored in a memory 104.<br>
Whilst the set-top-box 106 is switched on, the DVB-T receiver 100 is also<br>
powered up and receiving DVB-T signals. The DVB-T receiver is constantly<br>
decoding SI information which provides details of the content and location of<br>
each of the channels within the received multiplexed signal. The SI<br>
information also contain schedule details for each of the multiplexed<br>
channels. The schedule details allow a user to watch or record a specific<br>
programme of interest. For example, if the set-top-box 106 is connected to a<br>
personal computer (not shown), it is possible to receive data transmitted over<br>
the DVB-T network for use with the personal computer. In this way, the<br>
transmission of large data files can be broadcast, to a large audience, using<br>
the high data rates provided by DVB-T transmission. If a data file is due to be<br>
transmitted at a certain time on a certain channel, the SI information will<br><br>
contain this information which can be used by the personal computer to<br>
ensure that receiver receives the required data.<br>
SI information may change frequently, to reflect not only changes in program<br>
scheduling, but also to reflect re-allocation of frequencies and channels etc by<br>
the broadcaster. For example, it is possible for a channel to broadcast on a<br>
different frequency to originally scheduled. Since the SI contains details of the<br>
frequencies (or changes to the frequencies), a receiver should always be able<br>
to receive the desired channel and/or program. Some set-top-boxes store SI<br>
information in a memory, thereby allowing users to browse a schedule or<br>
program guide. However, due to the nature of SI information, the SI<br>
information is updated frequently to ensure that no discrepancies exist<br>
between the SI stored by the set-top-box and the SI being transmitted by the<br>
broadcaster.<br>
Figure 2 shows a block diagram of a first embodiment according to the<br>
present invention. A mobile terminal 200 receives DVB-T transmissions from<br>
a DVB-T transmitter 272. The transmitted DVB-T signal is a multiplexed signal<br>
produced by a multiplexer 250. The multiplexer 250 accepts as inputs a<br>
number of channels 252, 254, 256 and 258 to produce the multiplexed signal.<br>
The channels may be television, audio or data channels. Service information<br>
(SI) data, which contains details of the multiplexed channels, is also input to<br>
the multiplexer 250. The SI data is generated by a SI generator 260, which<br>
may be a database containing schedule and location details of each of the<br>
channels.<br>
The DVB-T signals are received by an antenna 210 of the mobile terminal 200<br>
and are received and decoded by a DVB-T receiver 202.<br>
In addition, and advantageously, the mobile terminal also receives an<br>
interactive channel from a cellular or other transmission network 274 at a<br>
cellular transceiver 206.     The  cellulor transceiver 206 allows  both the<br><br>
reception and transmission of signals between the mobile terminal 200 and<br>
the cellular network 274. The cellular network may be a GSM network, a<br>
general packet radio service (GPRS), third generation (3G) or other suitable<br>
network.<br>
SI data generated by the SI generator 260 is also supplied to a profiler 262 of<br>
the cellular network 274. The profiler contains a database of information about<br>
each of the subscribers to the cellular network 274. The profiler may contain<br>
information such as, demographic data, income level, sports leisure interests,<br>
etc.<br>
The operation of a first embodiment of the present invention will now be<br>
described by way of example.<br>
According to the prior art, if a user wishes to receive a video clip each time his<br>
favourite football team scores during a football match, it is necessary that the<br>
DVB-T receiver 100 in the DVB-T set-top-box 106 is constantly powered up<br>
and is constantly receiving SI data. This is since the exact timing of when a<br>
goal will be scored is not known in advance. Accordingly, no schedule will<br>
exist in the SI data for this event. A DVB-T receiver must therefore wait for the<br>
SI data to indicate when the video clip will be broadcast. If the user is only<br>
interested in receiving video clips of the football match, this is particularly<br>
inefficient in terms of power consumption, especially for mobile terminals,<br>
since the DVB-T receiver just waiting, consuming power, for a specific video<br>
clip to be broadcast.<br>
According to a first embodiment of the present invention, as exemplified in<br>
Figure 2, the subscriber registers his interest in receiving video clips with the<br>
profiler 262 of the cellular network 274. The DVB-T receiver 202 of the mobile<br>
terminal 200 may then be powered down. When a goal is scored, and a video<br>
dip is available for broadcast, the broadcaster must schedule the video dip to<br>
be  included   in  the  existing  DVB-T multiplex  signal.  This  may  involve<br>
8<br><br>
rescheduling existing programs, and updating the SI data accordingly. Once a<br>
scheduled time has been established for the broadcast of the video clip, a<br>
service announcement is sent by the cellular network 274 to the cellular<br>
transceiver 206. The service announcement is received by the cellular<br>
transceiver 206 and is processed by the controller 204. The controller informs<br>
the DVB-T receiver 202 of when the video clip will be broadcast and other<br>
relevant associated data, such as channel location, encryption parameters<br>
etc. The DVB-T receiver can be powered up and configured in time to receive<br>
and decode the video clip. The video clip may also be stored in a memory<br>
208. Once the desired video clip, or other data, has been received, the DVB-T<br>
receiver 202 can be once again powered down.<br>
The service announcement may be in the form of SI data, or may alternatively<br>
be in the form of a special short message service (SMS) message containing<br>
the necessary timing and location information required by the DVB-T receiver.<br>
Alternative forms of service announcement may be used, both in terms of the<br>
data required to be sent and the protocol which is used for sending it.<br>
In this way, the DVB-T receiver 202 can be powered down when not required<br>
for actual reception of data. This can produce large savings in power<br>
consumption, compared to the system of the prior art.<br>
The profiler 262 also controls whether requested information is transmitted to<br>
a user via the DVB-T or cellular network. For example, if one million people<br>
have requested to see a video clip of goals from a particular football match, it<br>
is better to transmit the video clip via the DVB-T network. For such a large<br>
number of users, the DVB-T network provides a cost effective delivery means.<br>
The alternative would be to individually send the video clip via the cellular<br>
network which, with so many users, could impact severely on the operation of<br>
the cellular network.<br><br>
If the number of users requesting to see a particular video clip is much<br>
smaller, it may be more economical to send it individually via the cellular<br>
network. The exact threshold levels will vary according to the pricing stmcture<br>
of the DVB-T and cellular networks, as well as the number of users requesting<br>
a particular item, and the volume of data required to be sent.<br>
The cellular transceiver 206 may also be used to send an acknowledgement<br>
back to the cellular network 274, indicating whether the video clip was<br>
correctly received. This may be used for billing purposes, or also to request a<br>
re-sending of the video clip if it not received due to poor signal strength etc.<br>
Re-sending of the video clip may again take place either via the DBV-T or<br>
cellular network depending on demand and cost effectiveness.<br>
A further advantage of the present invention is that, if schedule<br>
announcements are sent over the cellular network, it is possible to remove<br>
some or all of the SI data from DVB-T network. Since the SI data typically<br>
occupies up to 3Mbits"^ this redundant bandwidth could be used for providing<br>
additional data or video channels.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, a profiler may be included in<br>
the mobile terminal 200. This may be instead of, or in addition to, the profiler<br>
262 of the cellular network 274. A profiler on the mobile terminal may be used<br>
if the communications network used for the interactive channel supports<br>
broadcasting of data, such as via a GPRS network or other packet type<br>
network. The profiler can be configured according to user preferences, and<br>
will only accept service announcements which comply with the user<br>
preferences.<br>
Figure 3 shows yet a further embodiment of the present invention, which<br>
makes use of the additional interactive channel to provide increased security.<br>
A mobile terminal 300, receives DVB-T signals via an antenna 310 at a DVB-<br>
T receiver 302. The DVB-T signals are provided and transmitted by a DVB-T<br>
10<br><br>
network 320, via an antenna 330. The mobile terminal 300 also comprises a<br>
cellular transceiver 306 which can send and receive calls via a cellular<br>
network 326. The mobile terminal 300 also comprises a controller 304 which<br>
can either send or receive control information from the cellular transceiver<br>
306, the DVB-T receiver 300 or a memory 308. A controller 324 is also<br>
provided to provide communication and control between the DVB-T network<br>
320 and the cellular network 326.<br>
This embodiment enables DVB-T data to be broadcast from the DVB-T<br>
network 320 to the mobile terminal 300. In addition, data related to the<br>
broadcast DVB-T signal may also be transmitted to the mobile terminal 300<br>
via the cellular network 326.<br>
For example, at present, when encrypted video or television channels are<br>
broadcast to a terminal, security keys are also broadcast over the broadcast<br>
channel to enable subscribers to decrypt the encoded data. Although the<br>
security keys are hidden in the broadcast signal, it is possible for unauthorised<br>
users to gain access to these keys by monitoring the broadcast signals. Using<br>
the present invention, the security keys or security data can be sent over the<br>
interactive channel, directly to each individual receiver. This makes it<br>
increasingly difficult for unauthorised users to obtain access to the security<br>
keys, since they are sent via a different path to the encrypted video signals.<br>
The security keys may be sent for either currently broadcast signals, or for<br>
broadcast signals which have yet to be broadcast. In a still further<br>
embodiment, the terminal 300 comprises a subscriber information module<br>
(SIM) (not shown) which may contain authorisation or additional security data<br>
for use with either the cellular or DVB networks. The authorisation or<br>
additional security data contained by the SIM may be used in conjunction with<br>
the security data to enable authorisation or decryption of the signals received<br>
via the broadcast network.<br>
11<br><br>
In a still further embodiment of the present invention, on-line banking and<br>
other customer orientated services can use the present invention to improve<br>
the transmission of data, including Internet pages, to subscribers. For<br>
example, an on-line bank could broadcast using the DVB-T network pages of<br>
information containing high quality graphics, standard texts etc. Each page<br>
could then be personalised using personal data transmitted over the<br>
interactive channel. For example, a generic 'balance' sheet could be<br>
broadcast to all users containing the bank logo, background images etc.<br>
Personal balance data transmitted over the interactive channel could then be<br>
combined with the broadcast 'balance' sheet, to present to the user their own<br>
personal balance sheet.<br>
The present invention therefore provides benefits not only in increase power<br>
efficiency of such systems, but also provides added security and benefits of<br>
being able to broadcast information to multiple users, and to send subscriber<br>
specific information related to that broadcast information using a separate,<br>
personal, communications link. In yet a further embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the interactive channel can used for both transmitting service<br>
announcements as well as security or private data.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that although the present invention is<br>
described above with reference to DVB-T transmissions, the invention is not<br>
limited thereto. The same techniques could be applied to DVB (satellite)<br>
reception and transmission or any other similar or equivalent standards.<br>
Equally, references to cellular networks and cellular transmission techniques<br>
could be replaced by fixed line, public switched telephone networks, or any<br>
other type of suitable communications network.<br>
