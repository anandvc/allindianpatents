				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The invention provides novel compositions containing extracts and compounds<br>
obtained from the plant Glycyrrhiza glabra, useful as bio-enhancers and<br>
bioavailability facilitators for a variety of molecules including anti-infective, anticancer<br>
agents and nutritional compositions. This invention also relates to a method for<br>
enhancing the biological availability, proficiency and effectivity of drugs,<br>
Pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals and other related compounds including amino acids,<br>
vitamins and other nutritional elements and ions. The present invention has direct<br>
implication in drastically reducing the dosage of antibiotics, drugs and anti-cancer<br>
agents while increasing the efficiency of absorption of nutritional elements.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Since the invention of penicillin in 1928 by Alexander Flemming and their wider<br>
availability in the 1940s, further variants of existing and new antibiotics have been on<br>
the trial. Compared to the situation in 1954 when two million pounds of antibiotics<br>
were produced in the US, the present figure exceeds 50 million pounds. Antibiotics<br>
work either by killing bacteria (bacteriocidal) or by inhibiting growth (bacteriostatic)<br>
and their bioactivities have transformed human ability to treat many infectious<br>
diseases that previously were considered certain killers. It is estimated that globally<br>
humans consume above 250 million doses of antibiotics annually and 20%-50% of<br>
that use is unnecessary depending on the class of antibiotic. Further, widespread use<br>
of antibiotics promotes spread of antibiotic resistance many a times leading to<br>
multiple drug resistance. The total amount of antibiotic in the given dosage used for<br>
treatment of an infection generally is much higher than what is actually required to<br>
control a given population of parasite in the infected individual. This is so because all<br>
antibiotic given to the patient in a therapy does not reach the target site. This may be<br>
due to (i) lower absoiption in the gut membrane when taken orally (ii) restrictive<br>
uptake by the target microbe or (iii) operation of efflux pump leading to<br>
indiscriminate extrusion of the antibiotics or therapeutic molecules. Thus, large<br>
portions of the drugs we apply are wasted and only a miniscule percentage is being<br>
targeted to the infective microbes. But even worse part is that the unutilized drug /<br>
antibiotic amount remains as a load in the body and environment. This then acts as a<br>
selection pressure, facilitating emergence of drug resistance in parasites leading to<br>
their predominance in the niche and ultimately resulting into failure of antibiotics<br>
against resistant infections. Additionally, such a situation leads to side effects, illness<br>
and reduction in life expectancy being more acute in the older population. One of the<br>
ways that has been feasible to reduce drug dosage is the occurrence of synergism<br>
between different therapeutic agents. However, even in such a situation if both the<br>
molecules have the antibiotic property, the problem of continued selection pressure on<br>
microbes is still likely to continue. Therefore, the need is for molecules, which by<br>
themselves are not microbicidal but when present with a drug or active molecule,<br>
enhance its activity and availability (bioenhancers). These molecules by their presence<br>
will not exert any selection pressure for the mutants to emerge resistant against them<br>
and on the other hand could reduce the dosage of antibiotics or drugs so that their ill<br>
effects are minimized. This way resistance development process will be substantially<br>
delayed ultimately leading to enhanced life-span of the novel and existing antibiotics.<br>
Such drug / molecule facilitators should have novel properties like non-toxic to<br>
humans, animals or plants, should be effective at a very low concentration in a<br>
combination, should be easy to formulate and most importantly enhance<br>
uptake/absorption and activity of the drug molecules. This can lead to development<br>
of judicious and strategic concentrations of antibiotics with specific bioenhancers to<br>
improve availability of the drug right up to the target for effectively controlling the<br>
infectious organisms.<br>
The present invention was the result of planned experiments to provide a novel<br>
method for improving activity and bioavailability of antibiotics, drugs and other<br>
molecules using a plant glycoside "Glycyrrhizin" in different formulations.<br>
The bioavailability of nutrients and enhancement of antibiotics/drugs effectivity is<br>
relevant to human, plant as well as animal health and thus the compositions and<br>
methods of the invention are also intended to be used in agriculture and veterinary<br>
practice.<br>
Description of related Art<br>
Use of ayurvedic preparation "trikatu" dates back to the period between the seventh<br>
century B.C. and the sixth century A.D., which is a Sanskrit word meaning three<br>
acrids. It refers to a combination of three elements namely, black pepper (Piper<br>
nigrum Linn.), long pepper (Piper longum Linn.) and ginger (Zingiber officinale<br>
Rose.). It is believed that the use of "trikatu", and its constituents individually as well<br>
as collectively, enhances the bioavailability of a number of drugs. In specific studies<br>
carried out on animals as well as human volunteers, it was noted that the active<br>
component responsible for the increase in bioavailability of various drugs was<br>
piperine (United States Patent 5,616,593 and 5,972,382). Till today, thus, the known<br>
documented bio-availability enhancer is piperine and a series of inventions related to<br>
this compound have been described by several prior art investigators. Though the<br>
compound piperine has been reported to be enhancing the bioavailability of drugs,<br>
nutrients and vitamins, still a proper formulation for the combination is yet to come to<br>
the market. Beside this, the compound piperine being an alkaloid would find restricted<br>
use for the reasons of its typical action.<br>
The Applicants sought to provide a non-alkaloid molecule capable of bio-enhancing<br>
the availability of anti-infective, nutritional and anti-cancer compounds like 'taxoP<br>
produced by the yew tree in microscopic amounts.<br>
The Applicants screened a large number of the available extracts and known<br>
compounds in the laboratory at the Central Institute of Medicinal &amp; Aromatic Plants,<br>
Lucknow, U.P., India (CIMAP), particularly those, which by themselves did not<br>
exhibit any antibacterial property. After extensive experimentation, it was found that<br>
out of 70 pure compounds tested, only one plant compound 'glycyrrhizin', a glycoside<br>
enhanced the killing activities of different antibiotics on three diverse kinds of<br>
bacteria including Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Mycobacterium smegmatis.<br>
The compound is generally isolated from the roots and stolon of the plant Glycyrrhiza<br>
glabra and is a known sweetener and hepatoprotective drug.<br>
Licorice (the extract from the root of the plant) is used to flavor foods, tobacco, drinks,<br>
medicines and sweets. It has expectorant action to treat bronchitis and can reduce<br>
inflammation, allergies, asthma, gastritis, peptic ulcers, rheumatism, and sore throat.<br>
It helps the liver to detoxify drugs and is used for treatment of liver disease. Licorice<br>
strengthens the immune system, stimulates the adrenal gland, and is diuretic and<br>
laxative. Licorice from roots of Glycyrrhiza glabra, contains glycyrrhizin, which is 50<br>
times sweeter than sugar. Primary uses for licorice include treatment for peptic ulcers<br>
and stomach ailments, respiratory and intestinal passages. Licorice makes a wonderful<br>
expectorant expelling mucus from the chest area.<br>
The compound when studied by the Applicants also showed enhancement in the<br>
activity of known azole class antifungal agents like clotrimazole against infectious<br>
fungal strain of Candida albicans. More important was the obvious enhancement in<br>
the cell division inhibitory activity against the breast cancer cell line MCF-7.<br>
Accordingly, the Applicants have sought to increase the absorption of anti-infective,<br>
nutritional and anti-cancer compounds by the body and increase their utilization by the<br>
body by providing novel compositions containing extracts from the plant Glycyrrhiza<br>
glabra.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide novel compositions comprising extracts<br>
and compounds from the plant Glycyrrhiza glabra useful as a bioenhancer and<br>
capable of improving or enhancing the bio-availability of drugs such as antibiotics,<br>
anti-infective agents and of nutritional compounds.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide compositions comprising extracts and<br>
compounds from the plant Glycyrrhiza glabra useful as bio-enhancers and<br>
bioavailability facilitators, thus enabling effective transport of drugs and molecules<br>
across biological membranes to reach target sites.<br>
Still another object is to provide methods for enhancing the bio-availability of drugs<br>
molecules and nutritional compounds to the target site in the body.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a bioenhancer and bioavailability facilitator composition<br>
comprising:<br>
(i) a bioenhancer or bioavailability facilitator selected from the group consisting of isolated<br>

The invention is described in detail herein below with reference to the following<br>
drawings wherein :<br>
Fig. 1 : represents the structural formula of Glycyrrhizic acid; and<br>
Fig.2 : represents the structural formula of Glycyrrhizin<br>
Some of the embodiments of the invention are illustrated herein below by the<br>
following bioassays and examples which are provided merely to illustrate the<br>
invention and should not be construed as limitations on the inventive concept<br>
embodied herein.<br>
The methodology followed for screening of this compound (Glycyrrhizic acid and<br>
Glycyrrhizin) included specifically designed bioassays as follows:<br>
1. Assay for bio-enhancement of anti-infective agents<br>
a) The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of any antibiotic or drug molecule is<br>
determined against Escherichia coli (ATCC 10536), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6015<br>
11<br>
) and Mycobacterium smegmatis (ATCC 14468) and Candida albicans (ATCC<br>
10231 ) in broth and disc diffusion assays.<br>
b) The antibiotics or antifungal agents at concentrations 1/10, 1/8, 1/6, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2<br>
and equal to MIC are added alone and in combination with the test compound at<br>
varying concentrations in broth assays to evaluate the comparative level of<br>
inhibition and similarly at varying concentrations in disc diffusion assay.<br>
c) The combinations showing enhancement in terms of higher activity than antibiotic<br>
alone for the inhibition of bacterial growth (large inhibition zone in disc diffusion<br>
and higher killing at lower concentration in broth assay) are picked up for future<br>
testing.<br>
d) In broth assays the activity is quantified by counting number of viable cells in a<br>
given treatment and converted in fold enhancement by the combination treatment<br>
compared to antibiotic/drug alone in the killing percentage of cells.<br>
e) The pretreatment assay is followed to determine whether the bioenhancer which<br>
may be either an extract obtained from the plant Glycyrrhiza glabra, glycyrrhizin<br>
or glycyrrhizic acid, is required along with antibiotic to enhance its activity or<br>
even its withdrawal after treatment or prior to antibiotic treatment would benefit.<br>
For this, the cells are treated with the bioenhancer/compound for 4 to 8 hours and<br>
then washed free of it by centrifugation and washing in sterile water. This is<br>
followed by treatment with antibiotic/drug as in steps (b) to (d) above.<br>
f) The results of the bio-assays carried out are represented in the tables provided<br>
herein below wherein tables 1-6 represent the activity of glycyrrhizin. Tables 7-9<br>
depict the activity of glycyrrhizic acid and tables 10-11 depict the activity of<br>
licorice.<br>
2. Assay for bio-enhancement of anti-cancer agents<br>
a) MCF-7 (Breast cancer cell line) is inoculated at a density of about 0.1 X 106 cells<br>
in MEM medium in the wells of 24 well plate.<br>
b) The used up medium in these cultures is replaced with fresh medium after 18<br>
hours in each well.<br>
12<br>
c) The test compound (s) is added at desired concentrations in different wells just<br>
after the medium replacement.<br>
d) Observations are recorded on the cell count after 36 hours for which the following<br>
steps are required.<br>
i. The medium is removed from the wells.<br>
ii. The wells are rinsed with 1ml PBS (Phosphate buffer saline).<br>
iii. To each well 500 jul of freshly prepared trypsin solution (0.1% in PBS) is<br>
added,<br>
iv. Trypsin solution is removed after 30 seconds and the plate is gently tapped<br>
till the cells are released from the plate surface,<br>
v. Fresh 1 ml of MEM growth medium is added and agitated with a pipette to<br>
obtain a cell suspension,<br>
vi. 10 |il of cell suspension is taken on the haemocytometer and a cover glass<br>
is placed over the counting chamber,<br>
vii. The number of viable cells is counted in 5 big squares and the reading is<br>
taken from 5 microscopic fields to determine the average,<br>
viii. The cell count (titre per ml) in the original sample is then calculated as<br>
average count X 103.<br>

a) A specially designed U-tubes of glass consisting of two component (opposite-L<br>
type) were used in which one open end of a L-shaped was tapered to fit within the<br>
untapered end of the other L-tube.<br>
b) The membrane of goat gut (initial part) was stretched and fixed to act as the<br>
barrier between the two ends such that by joining the two L-tubes, a U-tube was<br>
made.<br>
c) Sterile distilled water was then filled in both the sides to equal height/level.<br>
d) The antibiotic/compound was added to the donor tube (tapered) and through<br>
spectro-photometer the transfer of molecule was observed using UV and visible<br>
absorption maxima of the respective molecules by taking the OD at defined<br>
wavelengths.<br>
Examples<br>
In the next step of elucidation of the enhancer action the applicants experimented with<br>
the killing activities of different antibiotics against the bacteria singly and in<br>
combination with the test compound glycyrrhizin following the method described<br>
above. These experiments are to be considered with assay for bioenhancement of the<br>
compounds glycyrrhizin/glycyrrhizic acid and licorice, as described earlier. When the<br>
bacteria were grown in presence of the compound as such no significant killing was<br>
observed. In all the experiments the glycyrrhizin concentration was kept at 1 jag/ml,<br>
unless it is specifically mentioned.<br>

From the above experiments it was deduced that the potency of the antibiotic is<br>
increased when applied along with the compound glycyrrhizin. It was interesting to<br>
note that the same results were observed when the bacterial cells were pretreated with<br>
glycyrrhizin for 4-8 hours and then the cells were washed free of the glycyrrhizin by<br>
centrifugation and resuspending the cells in fresh medium followed by treatment with<br>
respective antibiotics. This implicated some changes induced by glycyrrhizin on the<br>
bacterial surface/membrane making it more receptive to the antibiotics and hence<br>
enhancing bioavailability and ultimately activity/bactericidal effect of the given<br>
antibiotic.<br>

Here, the applicants observed glycyrrhizin-mediated enhancement in the cell division<br>
inhibitory action of anti-cancer agent taxol in the animal cell culture experiments<br>
using cancerous cell line MCF-7. As evident in Table 5 above, the anticancerous<br>
activity of Taxol' in terms of inhibiting the growth and multiplication of MCF-7<br>
cancer cells was markedly enhanced by at least 5 folds. In these experiments, the<br>
cancerous cells growth inhibition by Taxol (@ 0.01 u.g/ml) in presence of glycyrrhizin<br>
(@ 1 )J,g/ml) was higher than even the treatment with taxol (@ 0.05 (j.g/ml) alone.<br>

In the above experiments, the Applicants used Glycyrrhizic acid to test the potency of<br>
this acid in enhancing the activity of antibiotics. The Applicants observed that the<br>
killing action the antibiotics (such as Rifampicin) is enhanced when used with<br>
Glycyrrhizic acid. Table 7 shows that when the cells were treated with Rifampicin<br>
alone, the survival fraction was about 0.57. However, the survival fraction of cells<br>
when treated with a combination of rifampicin and glycyrrhizic acid was much less<br>
i.e. about 0.281. This shows that the combination of glycyrrhizic acid with rifampicin<br>
enhances the availability of rifampicin to the cells. Similarly, the results of the disc<br>
diffusion assay also show that the combination of glycyrrhizic acid with rifampicin is<br>
more effective against Mycobacterium smegmatis than glycyrrhizic acid or rifampicin<br>
used singly.<br>

Tables 10 and 11 show the bio-enhancing effects observed in the use of licorice, the<br>
extract from the roots of Glycyrrhiza glabra. As can be seen from Tables 10, the<br>
survival rate of bacteria treated with the antibiotic Rifampicin is more than when<br>
treated with a combination of Rifampicin and licorice. Similarly, Table 11 shows that<br>
the survival rate of the bacteria treated with nalidixic acid is less than when treated<br>
with a combination of nalidixic acid and licorice. The results in Tables 10 and 11<br>
demonstrate the use of licorice as an effective bio-enhancer and bioavailability<br>
facilitator.<br>
In the experiments related to transport across the mammalian gut membrane, it was<br>
observed that the compound glycyrrhizin enhances the transport of antibiotics e.g.<br>
Rifampicin, Tetracycline, Nalidixic acid, Ampicillin and vitamins like B-l and B-12<br>
across the gut as well as artificial membrane. The enhancement in transport is<br>
approximately 2 to 6 folds.<br>
Several medicinal plants are cited for use in Indian system of medicine for various<br>
activities such as immunostimulant, adaptogenic, anticancer, antimalarial,<br>
antimicrobial, angiogenetic, hepatoprotective, hypolinidemic, hypoglycemic, memory<br>
enhancing etc. The genus Glycyrrhiza (Mulethi) has attracted sizable importance for<br>
compound(s) with hepatoprotective ability. In Glycyrrhiza glabra (family,<br>
19<br>
Leguminosae) 12 different varieties (Biovars) are known. Among these only three<br>
namely typica, glandilifera and violacea are commonly used for the pharmaceutical<br>
and confectionary requirements. Glycyrrhiza glabra var. typica is the source of<br>
Spanish Liquorice and is sweeter than other types. Glycyrrhiza glabra var.<br>
glandilifera is the source of Russian liquorice, which is moderately sweet and some<br>
what bitter, also more or less acrid. Glycyrrhiza glabra var. violacea is known as the<br>
Persian or Iranian liquorice of commerce and has thick roots. The name Glycyrrhiza<br>
(popularly known as mulethi in India) is of Greek origin meaning sweet root.<br>
Cultivation of this species is mostly limited to US, Eastern Europe and several CIS of<br>
former USSR and scattered in western and northern India. The roots of the plant<br>
Glycyrrhiza glabra are<br>
highly useful as these contain the important glycoside Glycyrrhizin for its<br>
hepatoprotective ability. The root extracts also contain flavonoids, saponins, sterols,<br>
amino acids, gums essential oils, sugars and starches. The plant takes at least 4-5 years<br>
to achieve substantial production of glycyrrhizin in the roots. Generating sufficient<br>
planting material for commercial cultivation is thus desirable for harvesting required<br>
quantity of Glycyrrhizin on sustainable basis.<br>
This molecule (Glycyrrhizin) is a known sweetener and hepatoprotective drug. It helps<br>
the liver to detoxify drugs and is given for liver disease. The molecule is known to be<br>
strengthening the immune system, stimulates the adrenal gland, and is diuretic and<br>
laxative. This is also used to treat peptic ulcers and stomach ailments, respiratory and<br>
intestinal passages. Considering the wide use of the molecule in traditional system of<br>
medicine and the level of toxicity well tested, this can be used along with the<br>
antibiotics and other molecule of importance to enhance the efficacy on the target.<br>
This molecule (glycyrrhizin) in the Applicant's study facilitates the transport/uptake of<br>
various compounds including antibiotics, antifungal and anticancer agents, vitamins<br>
and amino acids etc. across the membrane thereby increasing the absorption or<br>
bioavailability of various biological systems including bacteria, animal and plant cells.<br>
This thus has immense importance for absorption of the drugs, Pharmaceuticals,<br>
nutraceutical and other related compounds and ions by the cells and hence huge<br>
potential of being used as drug/molecule facilitators.<br>
20<br>
Great emphasis now is being laid towards quality assurance of crude drugs from<br>
plants sources widely used in the Indian system of medicine. The scientific study of<br>
traditional medicines, derivation of drugs through bioprospection and systematic<br>
conservation, domestication and cultivation of the concerned medicinal plants has<br>
assumed great importance in the present day context when more and more people<br>
prefer safe and effective medicines at affordable price for curing their ailments. The<br>
present invention enlarges the scope and use of the natural glycoside glycyrrhizin in<br>
therapeutical and nutraceutical application. These plants synthesizing multi-use<br>
molecules are Clycyrrhiza sps and Abarus sps. The preferred plant is Glycyrrhiza<br>
glabra which is propagated through underground rhizome. This demands large<br>
amount of planting material which may be possible by micro propagation in vitro for<br>
its commercial cultivation. Agrotechnology and suitable cultivars for its cultivation in<br>
India are therefore required through screening of germplasm and genetic selection. At<br>
CIMAP a genetically superior variety of Glycyrrhiza glabra var. typica named as<br>
'Misree' is available for cultivation with better yield of glycyrrhizin (Kukreja A K,<br>
Tyagi B R, Muni Ram and Sushil Kumar (1997) Licorice cultivar - Mishree. Journal<br>
oj Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Sciences. 19 : 732-733).<br>
Procedure for isolation of quality glycyrrhizin the main compound from the root<br>
extract. Of the plant Glycyrrhiza glabra var. typica was also standardized. For this<br>
purpose we choose the plant Glycyrrhiza glabra var. typica 'Misree' (the released<br>
variety of CIMAP) and commercially available plant material. Fresh roots were<br>
harvested from the plant and shade dried. Commercial dried roots were purchased<br>
from the market. The protocol followed for the isolation was as follows:<br>
Protocol:<br>
1. Plant material (250 gram) was dipped in 900 ml of Butanol: glacial acetic acid<br>
: ethyl alcohol (1:1:1) for 48 hours.<br>
2. This was filtered through filter paper and concentrated in vacuums rotavapour.<br>
3. The solid material thus obtained was dissolved in acetic acid (180 ml) and<br>
treated with diethyl ether 2 litre (10 times, each with 200 ml) to remove<br>
impurity as precipitate which was filtered out.<br>
21<br>
4. Then the liquor in diethyl ether was evaporated to 250 ml and fractionated<br>
through liquid - liquid fractionation twice in water, followed by discarding the<br>
water fraction.<br>
5. This diethyl ether fraction was further concentrated in vacuum rotavapour to<br>
obtain the compound.<br>
6. The compound was hydrolyzed with 80 ml of NaOH (NaOH 5% in Methaol)<br>
at 80°-90°C for Ihour.<br>
7. The hydrolyzed reaction mixture was acidified (100 ml of glacial acetic acid<br>
and 5 ml of concentrated HC1) to pH 3.6 to form a ppt which was filtered and<br>
washed with ethanol.<br>
After isolation, the compound was checked for the purity compared to the standard<br>
glycyrrhizin obtained from Sigma chemical Inc.<br>
Preparation of the test solution: One gram of the isolated compound was extracted<br>
in 20 ml chloroform for 15 min. After filtration the filtrate was discarded. The marc<br>
was refluxed for 1 hour with 30 ml of 0.5 M F^SO,}. The unfiltered mixture was then<br>
cooled and extracted with chloroform (2X20ml) and the combined CHCb extract was<br>
concentrated. The residue was dissolved in 1.0 ml CHCh : Methanol (1:1) mixture.<br>
Reference solution: Five milligram of glycyrrhizin was refluxed with 20 ml 0.5 M<br>
HbSO,}. This was cooled and extracted with chloroform (2X10ml). The combined<br>
CHCb extract was evaporated and the residue was dissolved in 1.0 ml CHCIs:<br>
Methanol (1:1) mixture.<br>
Solvent system : Toluene : ethyl acetate: glacial acetic acid (12.5 : 7.5:0.5)<br>
Procedure: The test and reference solutions were applied in two different tracks on a<br>
precoated silica gel GF254 plate (5X15 cm) of uniform thickness (0.2 mm). The plate<br>
was developed in the solvent system to a distance of 12 cm.<br>
Scanning: The plate was scanned densitometrically at 254 nm in both the tracks and<br>
the fingerprint profiles were recorded.<br>
Visualization of spots:<br>
(i) Under UV 254 nm.<br>
(ii) The plate was sprayed with anisaldehyde-sulfuric acid reagent and heated<br>
at 110°C for 5-10 min.<br>
22<br>
Evaluation:<br>
(i) Under UV 254 nm light (before spraying):one spot (0.41) was visible in<br>
the sample solution track, corresponding to (Rf 0.41) Glycyrrhetic acid of<br>
reference track.<br>
(ii) In daylight (after spraying): Gylcyrrhetic acid was visible as a dark violet<br>
spot in both reference and test solution tracks.<br>
The above experiments indicate a sound procedure of isolating fairly pure glycyrrhizin<br>
from the root of the plant variety 'Misree' of CIMAP as well as market available dry<br>
root samples. By this procedure about 0.1 to 0.25% of glycyrrhizin could be isolated.<br>
The protocol can be scaled up or scaled down depending upon the initial starting<br>
material.<br>
Advantages<br>
1. The plant extract of Glycyrrhiza glabra and glycyrrhizin in the Applicant's<br>
study facilitates the transport/uptake of various compounds including<br>
antibiotics, antifungal and anticancer agents, vitamins and amino acids etc.<br>
across the membrane thereby increasing the absorption or bioavailability of<br>
various biological systems including bacteria, animal and plant cells. This thus<br>
has immense importance for absorption of the drugs, Pharmaceuticals,<br>
nutraceutical and other related compounds and ions by the cells and hence<br>
huge potential of being used as drug/molecule facilitators.<br>
2. The present invention enlarges the scope and use of the natural glycoside<br>
Glycyrrhizin in therapeutical and nutraceutical application.<br>
3. Glycyrrhizin is nontoxic to humans, animals or plants, is effective at very low<br>
concentrations in a combination, easy to formulate and enhances the<br>
uptake/absorption and activity of drug molecules. Thus the novel use of this<br>
compound as described in the present invention is safe and effective for<br>
bioenhancement of activity of drugs.<br>
23<br>
4. Glycyrrhizin by its presence will not exert any selection pressure for the<br>
mutants to emerge resistant against them and reduce the dosage of antibiotics<br>
or drugs so that their ill effects are reduced.<br><br><br><br>
