Specifically, the invention relates to a dry composition containing a pharmacologically active proteinaceous substance to which a saccharide and an amino acid are added.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions, particularly in dry compositions containing a pharmacologically active proteinaceous substance as an active ingredient, sucrose, glucose, fructose, maltose and like saccharides (Japanese<br><br>
Unexamined Patent Publications Nos. 1983-92619, 1985-48933 and 1990-138222, etc.), glycine, alanine and like amino acids (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications No. 1983 — 146504) have generally been used as stabilizers effective on the active ingredient.<br>
However, it is generally known that when these saccharides, which are used as stabilizers for pharmacologically active proteinaceous substances, are used with an amino acid, coloration caused by the Maillard reaction, etc. results.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The  anti-coloring  agent  of  the  invention comprises  a  hydrophobic  amino  acid  as  an  essential<br><br>
ingredient.   The anti-coloring agent of the invention significantly prevents coloration with the passage of time, especially when used with a dry composition containing a saccharide.<br>
The hydrophobic amino acids to be used in the invention are those having a hydropathy index of about 2 or larger (Jack Kyte and Russel F. Doolittel,  "A Simple Method for Displaying the Hydropathic Character of a Protein." J.   Mol.   Biol.   157(1982): 105-132). Any amino acids having the above property may be used in the invention whether or not they are protein-constituting amino acids. The hydrophobic amino acids may preferably be those having a hydropathy index of about 2.8 or larger such as valine, leucine, isoleucine and phenylalanin; more preferably those having a hydropathy index of about 3.8 or larger; and even more preferably those having a hydropathy index in the range of from about 3.8 to about 4.5 such as valine, leucine and isoleucine.<br>
The hydrophobic amino acids to be used in the invention may be in the form of dipeptides, tripeptides, salts or amides. Examples of the dipeptides of hydrophobic amino acids are leucyl-valine, isoleucyl-valine, isoleucyl-leucine, leucyl-glycine, etc. Examples of the tripeptides of hydrophobic amino acids are isoleucyl-leucyl-valine, leucyl-glicyl-glycine, etc.  The<br><br>
salts of hydrophobic amino acids include salts thereof with sodium, potassium and like alkali metals or with calcium, magnesium and like alkaline earth metals; adduct salts thereof with phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid and like inorganic acids or with organic acids such as a sulfonic acid, etc. More specific examples of the salts of hydrophobic amino acids are an L-leucic amide hydrochloride, L-isoleucyl-β-naphthylamide hydrobromide, L-valine-β-naphthylamide, etc.<br>
These hydrophobic amino acids (including those in a form of a salt or amide) may be used singularly or in an arbitrary combination.<br>
The anti-coloring agent of the invention targets saccharides generally known to cause coloration with the passage of time due to the Maillard reaction and the like when combined with amino acid.  Specifically, the targeted saccharides include those generally used as stabilizers for dry pharmaceutical compositions, particularly pharmaceutical compositions containing a pharmacologically active proteinaceous substance. More specifically, glucose, fructose, maltose and like reducing sugars; sucrose, trehalose, mannitol, dextran 40 and the like are included.  These saccharides can be added to a dry composition singularly or in an arbitrary combination. Among those preferable are sucrose and maltose.<br><br>
The saccharide content of the dry composition varies depending on the kind of saccharide contained and cannot be generalized. However, a general amount of the saccharide used is 10 wt.% to 90 wt.%, in some cases 20 Wt.% to 80 wt.% and in other cases 40 wt.% to 80 wt.% per 100 wt.% of the dry composition. The above proportion is suitably applied when the saccharide used is sucrose.<br>
Content of the hydrophobic amino acid in the dry composition varies depending on the kind of saccharide contained in the dry composition and cannot be generalized. However, per 100 wt.% of the dry composition, the hydrophobic amino acid can be contained generally about 0.1 wt.% to about 70 wt.%, preferably about 0.25 wt.% to about 60 wt.%, more preferably about 0.5 wt.% to about 50 wt.%, and even more preferably about 1 wt.% to about 50<br>
Wt . "o .<br>
There is no limitation on the ratio of the hydrophobic amino acid to the saccharide contained in the dry composition. However, the amount of amino acid used is generally about 0.1 part by weight to about 200 parts by weight, preferably about 0.2 part by weight to about 100 parts by weight and more preferably about 1 part by weight to about 100 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the saccharide contained in the dry composition.<br>
Dry compositions in which the anti-coloring<br><br>
agents of the invention are usable include compositions containing a pharmacologically active proteinaceous substance as an active ingredient.<br>
There is no limitation on the pharmacologically active proteinaceous substances to be used as long as they are pharmacologically effective proteins or peptides (including polypeptides). Examples thereof are enzymes, hemoglobin, immunoglobulins, hormones, blood coagulation factors and like proteins, antiviral polypeptides (ex. interferons-α , -β , -γ , etc.), immunomodulator polypeptides (ex. interleukins-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, etc.), hematinic polypeptides (ex. erythropoietin, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, macrophage-colony stimulating factor and granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor) and like polypeptides, etc. The proteins and peptides may be contained in the dry composition singularly or in an arbitrary combination. Among these, preferable are interferons.<br>
The above proteins and peptides include those existing in nature, produced by recombinant DNA techniques or chemical syntheses.<br>
There is no limitation on the proportion of the pharmacologically active proteinaceous substance to the dry composition. The amount of the pharmacologically active proteinaceous substance used varies depending on<br><br>
the kind to be used; however, specific examples of the concentrations thereof are generally not more than 20 wt.%, in some cases 0.00001 wt.% to 10 wt.%, in some cases 0.0001 wt.% to 10 wt.%, in some cases 0.001 wt.% to 10 wt.% and in some cases 0.001 wt.% to 5 wt.%, per 100 wt.% of the dry composition.<br>
The dry compositions in which the anti-coloring agents of the invention are used may further contain human serum albumin, a polar amino acid(s) or a salt(s) thereof (ex. an amino acid(s) having a hydropathy index of not larger than 0 or a salt thereof), an inorganic salt(s), gelatin, a surfactant(s) , a buffer(s), etc.<br>
The usage of the anti-coloring agents of the invention is not limited as long as they are used in the above dry compositions.  Preferably, they are added to a solution containing saccharide(s) and/or pharmacologically active proteinaceous substance(s) prior to the preparation of (i.e., before drying) the dry composition (dried product) or mixed into a solution together with saccharide(s) and/or pharmacologically active proteinaceous substance(s).<br>
There is no limitation on the ratio of the anti-coloring agent to the dry composition. However, per 100 wt.% of the dry composition, hydrophobic amino acid is generally about 0. 1 wt.% to about 70 wt.%, preferably<br><br>
about 0.25 wt. % to about 60 wt.%, more preferably about 0.5 wt.% to about 50 wt.%, and even more preferably about 1 wt.% to about 50 wt.%.<br>
The content of hydrophobic amino acid per 100 parts by weight of saccharides contained in the dry composition is generally about 0.1 part by weight to about 200 parts by weight, preferably about 0.2 part by weight to about 100 parts by weight, and more preferably about 1 part by weight to about 100 parts by weight.<br>
The invention relates to a method for preventing coloration of dry compositions containing a saccharide comprising use of hydrophobic amino acid.  Specific examples of hydrophobic amino acids, saccharides, dry compositions and usage of hydrophobic amino acids are as described above.<br>
Furthermore, the invention provides use of hydrophobic amino acid as a stabilizer. The hydrophobic amino acid suitably functions as a stabilizer when combined with a saccharide and is particularly effective as a stabilizer for dry compositions containing a pharmacologically active proteinaceous substance.<br>
The invention also relates to a dry composition containing a pharmacologically active proteinaceous substance in which a stabilizer composed of hydrophobic<br>
amino acid and saccharide is used.<br><br>
The saccharide(s) used in the invention is not limited but may include those generally used or function as stabilizers for dry pharmaceutical compositions, specifically, pharmaceutical compositions containing a pharmacologically active proteinaceous substance. Specific examples are sucrose, maltose, lactose, trehalose and like disaccharides; mannitol, xylitol and like sugar alcohols; dextran 40, dextran 70; chondroitin sulfuric acid and like polysaccharides. These saccharides can be added to the dry compositions singularly or in an arbitrary combination. Among those, preferable are sucrose, maltose, lactose, trehalose and like disaccharides, and more preferable is sucrose.<br>
The saccharide content of the targeted dry composition is not limited and may be generally about 10 wt.% to about 90 wt.%, in some cases about 20 wt.% to about 80 wt.%, and in some other cases about 40 wt.% to about 80 wt.% per 100 wt.% of dry composition. The above proportion is suitably applied when sucrose or like disaccharides is used.<br>
The hydrophobic amino acid content in the dry composition is not limited and may be, per 100 wt.% of dry composition, generally about 0.1 wt.% to about 70 wt.%, preferably about 0.25 wt.% to about 60 wt.%, more preferably about 0.5 wt.% to about 50 wt.%, and even more<br><br>
preferably about 1 wt.% to about 50 wt.%.  The proportion of hydrophobic amino acid to saccharide contained in the dry composition is, per 100 parts by weight of saccharide, generally about 0.1 part by weight to about 200 parts by weight, preferably about 0.2 part by weight to about 100 parts by weight, and more preferably about 1 part by weight to about 100 parts by weight.<br>
Examples<br>
The present invention will be described below in more detail with reference to Examples.    However, the scope of the present invention is not limited to these Examples. Examples 1 to 3<br>
In each Example, a mixture was prepared so as to contain 0.25 ml of an interferon-α bulk solution (hereinafter referred to as "IFN-α bulk solution"; titer: 2 x 107 IU/ml) , 1 mg of Tween 80, 5 mg of sucrose, and 5 mg of an amino acid (isoleucine (Example 1), valine (Example 2), or leucine (Example 3)) per vial (1 ml capacity). A suitable amount of distilled water for injection was added to dissolve them. The mixture was freeze-dried using a shelf-type lyophilizer (LYOVAC GT-4: LEYBOLD). The resultant freeze-dried composition was allowed to stand at 70°C.   The extent of coloration and<br><br>
the titer of the freeze-dried composition were observed with the passage of time, and then the remaining IFN-a activity was estimated by the ratio of the measured IFN-a activity to the IFN-a activity (100%) of the composition immediately after freeze-drying. For comparison, as an amino acid, 5 mg of glycine (Comparative Example 1) or arginine hydrochloride (Comparative Example 2) was used for evaluating the coloration. Furthermore, for evaluating the stability of IFN-a, a test was conducted in the same manner as mentioned above except that a system with no amino acid added was used (Comparative Example 3). The results, including the degree of coloration and the stability of the IFN-a of the compositions obtained in Examples and Comparative Examples, are shown in Table 1 and Table 2.<br><br><br>

As shown in Table 1, the combined use of sucrose and glycine and the combined use of sucrose and arginine hydrochloride caused coloration of the freeze-dried composition with the passage of time. Using sucrose with hydrophobic amino acid having a hydropathy index of 3.8 or larger prevented coloration of the freeze-dried composition. Furthermore, as shown in Table 2, the stability of IFN-a improved when using sucrose with hydrophobic amino acid having a hydropathy index (HP-INDEX) of 3.8 or larger compared to the stability when using sucrose singularly.<br><br>
Examples 4 to 6<br>
In each Example, a mixture was prepared so as to contain 0.25 ml of an IFN-α bulk solution (titer: 2 x 107 IU/ml), 1 mg of Tween 80, 5 mg of maltose, and 5 mg of an amino acid (isoleucine (Example 4), valine (Example 5), or leucine (Example 6)) per vial (1 ml capacity). A suitable amount of distilled water for injection was added to dissolve them. The mixture was freeze-dried using a shelf-type lyophilizer (LYOVAC GT-4: LEYBOLD). The resultant freeze-dried composition was allowed to stand at 70 °C. The extent of coloration of the freeze-dried composition was observed with the passage of time. For comparison, as an amino acid, 5 mg of glycine (Comparative Example 4) or arginine hydrochloride (Comparative Example 5) was used for evaluating the coloration, and the test was conducted in the same manner as mentioned above. The results of the Examples and Comparative Examples are shown in Table 3.<br><br>

As shown in Table 3, the combined use of maltose and glycine and the combined use of maltose and arginine hydrochloride caused coloration of the freeze-dried composition with the passage of time.  Using maltose with<br><br>
hydrophobic amino acid having a hydropathy index of 3.8 or larger prevented coloration of the freeze-dried composition.<br>
Examples 7 to 9<br>
In each Example, a mixture was prepared so as to contain 0.25 ml of an IFN-α bulk solution (titer: 2 x 107 IU/ml), 1 mg of Tween 80, 5 mg of trehalose, and 5 mg of an amino acid (isoleucine (Example 7), valine (Example 8), or leucine (Example 9) ) per vial (1 ml capacity) . A suitable amount of distilled water for injection was added to dissolve them. The mixture was freeze-dried using a shelf-type lyophilizer (LYOVAC GT-4: LEYBOLD). The resultant freeze-dried composition was allowed to stand at 70 °C. The titer of the freeze-dried composition was observed with the passage of time, and then the remaining IFN-a activity was estimated by the ratio of the measured IFN-a activity to the IFN-a activity (100%) of the composition immediately after freeze-drying. For comparison, the test was conducted in the same manner as mentioned above except that a system with no amino acid added was used (Comparative Example 6) for evaluating the stability of IFN-a. The results of the Examples and Comparative Example are shown in Table 4.<br><br>

As shown in Table 4, the stability of IFN-a improved when using trehalose with hydrophobic amino acid having a hydropathy index (HP-INDEX) of 3.8 or larger compared to the stability when using sucrose singularly.<br>
Examples 10 to 12<br>
In each Example, a mixture was prepared so as to contain 0.25 ml of an IFN-a bulk solution (titer: 2 x 107 IU/ml), 1 mg of Tween 80, 40 mg of sucrose, and 5 mg of an amino acid (isoleucine (Example 10), valine (Example 11), or leucine (Example 12)) per vial (1 ml capacity). A suitable amount of distilled water for injection was added to dissolve them. The mixture was freeze-dried using a shelf-type lyophilizer (LYOVAC GT - 4: LEYBOLD). The<br><br>
resultant freeze-dried composition was allowed to stand at 70 °C. The extent of coloration of the freeze-dried composition was observed with the passage of time. For comparison, as an amino acid, 5 mg of glycine (Comparative Example 7) or arginine hydrochloride (Comparative Example 8) was used for evaluating the coloration, and the test was conducted in the same manner as mentioned above. The results of the Examples and Comparative Examples are shown in Table 5.<br>

The resultant freeze-dried composition was allowed to stand at 70 °C, and the coloration thereof was observed with the passage of time. The results show that, as Examples 10 to 12, coloration of the freeze-dried composition can be prevented by using sucrose with hydrophobic amino acid having a hydropathy index of 3.8 or larger.<br>
Examples 19 to 21<br>
A freeze-dried composition was obtained in the same manner as in Examples 1 to 3 except that 0.25 ml of IFN-y bulk solution (titer: 2 x 107 IU/ml) was used instead of 0.25 ml of IFN-a bulk solution (titer: 2 x 10 IU/ml). The resultant freeze-dried composition was allowed to stand at 7 0 °C, and the coloration thereof was observed with the passage of time. The results show that, as Examples  1  to  3,  coloration  of  the  freeze-dried<br><br>
composition can be prevented by using sucrose with hydrophobic amino acid having a hydropathy index of 3.8 or larger.<br>
Examples 22 to 24<br>
A freeze-dried composition was obtained in the same manner as in Examples 10 to 12 except that 0.25 ml of IFN-(3 bulk solution (titer: 2 x 107 IU/ml) was used instead of 0.25 ml of IFN-a bulk solution (titer: 2 x 107 IU/ml). The resultant freeze-dried composition was allowed to stand at 70 °C, and the coloration thereof was observed with the passage of time. The results show that, as Examples 10 to 12, coloration of the freeze-dried composition can be prevented by using sucrose with hydrophobic amino acid having a hydropathy index of 3.8 or larger.<br>
Examples 25 to 27<br>
A freeze-dried composition was obtained in the same manner as in Examples 1 to 3 except that 0.25 ml of erithropoietin bulk solution (titer: 2 x 10 IU/ml) was used instead of 0.25 ml of IFN-a bulk solution (titer: 2 x 107 IU/ml). The resultant freeze-dried composition was allowed to stand at 70 °C, and the coloration thereof was observed with the passage of time.  The results show that,<br><br>
as Examples 1 to 3, coloration of the freeze-dried composition can be prevented by using sucrose with hydrophobic amino acid having a hydropathy index of 3.8 or larger.<br>
Examples 28 to 30<br>
A freeze-dried composition was obtained in the same manner as in Examples 10 to 12 except that 0.25 ml of erithropoietin bulk solution (titer: 2 x 107 IU/ml) was used instead of 0.25 ml of IFN-a bulk solution (titer: 2 x 10 IU/ml). The resultant freeze-dried composition was allowed to stand at 70 °C, and the coloration thereof was observed with the passage of time.  The results show that, as Examples 10 to 12, coloration of the freeze-dried composition can be prevented by using sucrose with hydrophobic amino acid having a hydropathy index of 3.8 or larger.<br>
Examples 31 to 33<br>
One vial (1 ml capacity) of mixture solution was prepared in such a manner that it comprised 0.25 ml of IFN-a bulk solution (titer: 2 x 107 IU/ml), 40 mg of sucrose, and 5 mg each of two kinds of amino acid (glycine + isoleucine (Example 31), glycine + valine (Example 32), or glycine + leucine (Example 33)).  A suitable amount of<br><br>
distilled water for injection was added to dissolve them. Thereafter, freeze-drying was conducted in the same manner as in Examples 10 to 12 obtaining a freeze-dried composition. The resultant freeze-dried composition was allowed to stand at 70 °C. The extent of coloration of the freeze-dried composition was observed with the passage of time. For comparison, the test was conducted in the same manner as mentioned above except that 5 mg of glycine alone (Comparative Example 7) was used as the amino acid. The results of the Examples and Comparative Example are shown in Table 6.<br>
Table 6<br><br><br>
Evaluation of coloration:<br>
No coloration was observed ±    Slight coloration was observed +    Little coloration was observed ++   Much coloration was observed +++  Extreme coloration was observed<br>
As shown in Table 6, the freeze-dried composition containing sucrose and glycine caused coloration with the passage of time. However, coloration of the freeze-dried composition can significantly prevented by using hydrophobic amino acid having a hydropathy index of 3.8 or larger in addition to sucrose and glycin.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY The anti-coloring agent of the invention can significantly reduce and/or prevent the coloration of a dry composition with the passage of time caused by the combined use of saccharide and amino acid. Such an anti-coloring agent is specifically useful for preventing the coloration of a dry composition comprising a saccharide and a pharmacologically active proteinaceous substance. From another point of view, the anti-coloring agent is also  useful  as  a  stabilizer  for  a  dry  composition<br><br>
containing a saccharide and a pharmacologically active proteinaceous substance. Therefore, the invention can provide dry compositions containing a pharmacologically active proteinaceous substance and an anti-coloring agent or a stabilizer, i.e., dry compositions containing a pharmacologically active proteinaceous substance to which a saccharide and an amino acid are added, which exhibits excellent stability by significantly preventing the coloration and lowered activity observed with the passage of time.<br><br>
