				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a pin grid array extraction device for the integrated circuits. The main embodiment of the present invention resides in the extraction device being able to extract integrated circuits from the base without damaging the base or the specific component.<br>
Another embodiment of the device of the present invention resides in the efficiency of the extractor device to extract the component from the base assembly slowly and uniformally and without damaging the component leads. The slow, smooth and uniform extraction is a result of equal pressure and equal gripping strength applied from both sides by the puller arms. The uniform and slow extraction of the component is an essential requirement of the extracting device as otherwise it could hamper the activity of the component. The device of the present invention is aimed at eliminating the risks of destroying the component including the leads while extracting it from the Integrated Circuit base.<br>
The input/output pins project out from under the Pin Grid Array integrated circuit and the outwardly protruding pins require a greater amount of protection. Therefore the present invention aims at protecting the pins while extracting them from the circuit.<br>
The Pin Grid Array integrated circuits are difficult to rework. For easy replacement of these Pin Grid Array Integrated Circuits, they are mounted on Pin Grid Array bases. The bases are soldered to the Printed Circuit Board. The pins of these Integrated circuits are fragile. A lot of care is required to be taken to remove the Integrated Circuit from the base. The Pin Grid Array extraction tool of the present invention helps the operator extract the component from the base easily, effectively and efficiently.<br>
The extractor device of the present invention comprises a main central block. The main central block comprises means for extracting and holding the integrated circuit from the said electronic device. These means for extracting and holding the integrated<br><br>
circuit from the electronic device are a pair of support arms. These support arms are hinged on to the main central block. To each support arm is connected a puller arm. The extrcator device of the present invention further comprises of an additional central block attached to the means for extracting and holding the integrated circuit from the said electronic device, i.e., the support arms. The main central block and the additional central block are joined by attachment means comprising of a screw and a knob arrangement. The additional central block is pivoted to the screw arrangement. Further means are provided for regulating the convergence and divergence of the means for extracting and holding the integrated circuit from the said electronic device. These means essentially are lever mechanism employed for the use of regulating the convergence and divergence of the support arms as well as puller arms.<br>
The clockwise rotation of the knob arrangement leads to the divergence of the support arms outward in a horizontal direction. The divergence of the support arms leads to the increase in space in between these support arms thereby facilitating easy placement of the integrated circuit within the support arms.<br>
The support arms are hingedly attached to the main central block which ensures the divergence of these puller arms with ease. Similarly the anticlock wise rotation of the knob and screw arrangement leads to convergence of the support arms. The convergence and divergence of the support arms are mainly facilitated by the hingedly connected support arms to the main central blcok.<br>
The additional central block however is pivotted to the screw and knob arrangement. The means for regulating the convergence and divergence of the support arms essentially comprises of a lever arrangement. The lever arrangement of the present invention is hingedly connected to the additional central block. The lever arrangement as defined comprises of a pair of arms which are of fixed length. The length of these arms define the length of the integrated circuit that can be extracted by using the present extractor device. When these arms of the lever arrnagement are in a horizontal direction, they provide the maximum displacement of the support arms and when these arms are in vertical position, they define the minimum distance between the<br><br>
support arms. Therefore the extractor device of the present invention works on the principle of least resistance path.<br>
The extractor device of the present invention comprises of two arms which guides the puller. The puller is connected to a central block with a lever. The lever is, however, a part of the screw and knob arrangement. The puller arm is bent at right angles at their extreme ends and has projections to support the lifting up of the component while extracting the same.<br>
The main embodiment of the present invention resides in the upward movement of the puller arms only when the integrated circuit comes in contact with the puller arms. During this movement there is movement of only the puller arms and the support arms remain stationary. Therefore the extractor device of the present invention facilitate extraction of the pin grid array integrated circuit while preserving such pin grid arrays.<br>
The puller arms move in upward direction only when they sense the placement of the integrated circuit within them. This is possible due to the lever mechanism which when senses the placement of the integrated circuit within them, then due to least resistance path available being only that in vertially upward direction, the extractor device moves upward thereby extracting the Pin grid array integrated circuit.<br>
When the device is made to rotate in a clockwise position, the tool arms diverge and when the device is given an anticlockwise rotation the tool arms converge. The puller moves in an upward direction only when they sense a component in between the arms. The main embodiment of the present invention therefore lies in the sensory powers of the puller arms which move in upward direction only when they have sensed a component placed in between them.<br><br>
According to the present invention there is provided a pin grid array extraction device for extracting integrated circuits from an electronic component device comprising:<br>
a main central block having means for extracting and holding the integrated circuit from the said electronic device;<br>
an additional central block attached to the said means for extracting and holding the integrated circuit from the said electronic device;<br>
attachment means for connecting the said main central block and the additional central block; and<br>
means for regulating the convergence and divergence of the means for extracting and holding the integrated circuit from the said electronic device<br>
wherein the main central block comprises a pair of support arms hinged to the main central block, each of the said support arms having a puller arm.<br>
While the specification concludes with claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the present invention, it is believed the present invention will be better understood from the following description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
Figure 1 depicts the extractor device of the present invention<br>
Figure 2 depicts the intricate mechanism of the extractor device of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The pin grid array extraction device is made up of one main central block (7) comprising two arms (1) which guides the puller (2). The puller in turn is connected to a central block (3) with a lever (4), which is part of the screw and knob (6)arrangement. The puller arm is bent at 90° at the bottom to support the component while pulling the component.<br>
When the knob (6) on the tool is rotated clock wise, the device arm (1) moves outwards. When the knob (6) is rotated anti clockwise, the device arm moves inwards (the distance between the arms reduces at the bottom). The puller (2) moves in the upward direction only if it senses the Integrated Circuits. The supporting arm (1) presses down on the PCB/IC Base when the Integrated Circuits is being pulled out vetically and uniformally.<br>
Advantages and utility<br>
The PIN GRID ARRAY extraction device is a very useful and handy device. The fragile Integrated Circuit pins are protected against deformation and damage because the Integrated Circuit moves uniformally in a vertcally upwards direction slowly. After the exatraction, the Integrated Circuit can be placed gently, any where by operating the knob on the device in a clockwise direction. During card testing, in order to debug the cards, Integrated Circuits have to be removed. This device is very helpful in extracting the PIN GRID ARRAY integrated circuit.<br><br><br><br>
