METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROL OF A HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLE TO<br>
ACHIEVE A TARGET LIFE OBJECTIVE FOR AN ENERGY STORAGE DEVICE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]		This invention pertains generally to management of an electrical<br>
energy storage device. More particularly, the invention is concerned with<br>
achieving a target life for an electrical energy storage device.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]		Various hybrid propulsion systems for vehicles use electrical energy<br>
storage devices to supply electrical energy to electrical machines, which are<br>
operable to provide motive torque to the vehicle, often in conjunction with an<br>
internal combustion engine. One such hybrid powertrain architecture<br>
comprises a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical transmission<br>
which utilizes an input member for receiving power from a prime mover<br>
power source and an output member for delivering power from the<br>
transmission to a vehicle driveline. First and second electric machines, i.e.<br>
motor/generators, are operatively connected to an energy storage device for<br>
interchanging electrical power therebetween. A control unit is provided for<br>
regulating the electrical power interchange between the energy storage device<br>
and the electric machines. The control unit also regulates electrical power<br>
interchange between the first and second electric machines.<br>
[0003]		One of the design considerations in vehicle powertrain systems is an<br>
ability to provide consistent vehicle performance and component/system<br>
service life. Hybrid vehicles, and more specifically the battery pack systems<br>
utilized therewith, provide vehicle system designers with new challenges and<br>
tradeoffs. It has been observed that service life of an electrical energy storage<br>
device, e.g. a battery pack system, increases as resting temperature of the<br>
battery pack decreases. However, cold operating temperature introduces<br><br>
2<br>
limits in battery charge/discharge performance until temperature of the pack is<br>
increased. A warm battery pack is more able to supply required power to the<br>
vehicle propulsion system, but continued warm temperature operation may<br>
result in diminished service life.<br>
[0004]		Modern hybrid vehicle systems manage various aspects of operation<br>
of the hybrid system to effect improved service life of the battery. For<br>
example, depth of battery discharge is managed, amp-hour (A-h) throughput is<br>
limited, and convection fans are used to cool the battery pack. Ambient<br>
environmental conditions in which the vehicle is operated has largely been<br>
ignored. However, the ambient environmental conditions may have<br>
significant effect upon battery service life. Specifically, same models of<br>
hybrid vehicles released into various geographic areas throughout North<br>
America would likely not result in the same battery pack life, even if all the<br>
vehicles were driven on the same cycle. The vehicle's environment must be<br>
considered if a useful estimation of battery life is to be derived. Additionally,<br>
customer expectations, competition and government regulations impose<br>
standards of performance, including for service life of battery packs, which<br>
must be met.<br>
[0005]		End of service life of a battery pack may be indicated by ohmic<br>
resistance of the battery pack. The ohmic resistance of the battery pack is<br>
typically flat during much of the service life of the vehicle and battery pack<br>
however, thus preventing a reliable estimate of real-time state-of-life ('SOL')<br>
of the battery pack throughout most of the service life. Instead, ohmic<br>
resistance is most useful to indicate incipient end of service life of the battery<br>
pack.<br>
[0006]		It is desirable to have a method and apparatus to provide a control of<br>
operation of an electrical energy storage system, including for application on a<br>
gasoline/electric hybrid vehicle that controls operation based upon a targeted<br>
service life of the electrical energy storage device.<br><br>
3<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]		A hybrid vehicular powertrain includes first and second electric<br>
machines, each machine operable to impart torque to a two-mode, compound-<br>
split electro-mechanicaJ transmission having four fixed gear ratios and two<br>
continuously variable operating modes. A method for operating the hybrid<br>
electric powertrain includes providing present state-of-life of the electrical<br>
energy storage device and establishing a life target for the electrical energy<br>
storage device as a predetermined limit in a predetermined metric at a<br>
predetermined state-of-life of the electrical energy storage device. A state-of-<br>
life gradient is then determined with respect to the predetermined metric<br>
which converges the state-of-life of the electrical energy storage device to the<br>
life target. The electric machines are operated such that electrical energy<br>
storage device state-of-life substantially tracks the state-of-life gradient based<br>
on the determined changes in state-of-life.<br>
[0008]		Preferably, the predetermined state-of-life of the electrical energy<br>
storage device is indicative of the end of life of the electrical energy storage<br>
device. In accordance with one alternative, the metric includes elapsed service<br>
time of the electrical energy storage device. In accordance with another<br>
alternative, the metric comprises vehicle distance traveled. In accordance with<br>
another alternative, the life target is based upon a predetermined limit in one<br>
of elapsed service time of the electrical energy storage device and vehicle<br>
distance traveled. The life target is preferably normalized with respect to the<br>
one of elapsed service time of the electrical energy storage device and vehicle<br>
distance traveled upon which the life target is based.<br><br>

and wherein:<br>
[0010]		Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary architecture for a<br>
control system and powertrain, in accordance with the present invention; and,<br>
[0011]		Figs. 2 and 3 are algorithmic block diagrams, in accordance with the<br>

[0012]		Fig. 4 is a logic flowchart, in accordance with the present invention;<br>
and,<br>
[0013]		Figs. 5 and 6 comprise analytical datagraphs, in accordance with the<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0014]		Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating the invention only and not for the purpose of limiting<br>
the same, Fig. 1 shows a control system and an exemplary hybrid powertrain<br>
system which has been constructed in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
invention. The exemplary hybrid powertrain system comprises a plurality of<br>
torque-generative devices operable to supply motive torque to a transmission<br>
device, which supplies motive torque to a driveline. The torque-generative<br>
devices preferably comprise an internal combustion engine 14 and first and<br>
second electric machines 56, 72 operable to convert electrical energy supplied<br>
from an electrical storage device 74 to motive torque. The exemplary<br>
transmission device 10 comprises a two-mode, compound-split electro-<br>
mechanical transmission having four fixed gear ratios, and includes a plurality<br>
of gears operable to transmit the motive torque to an output shaft 64 and<br>
driveline through a plurality of torque-transfer devices contained therein.<br>
Mechanical aspects of exemplary transmission 10 are disclosed in detail in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,953,409, entitled "Two-Mode, Compound-Split, Hybrid<br><br>
5<br>
Electro-Mechanical Transmission having Four Fixed Ratios", which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0015]		The control system comprises a distributed control module<br>
architecture interacting via a local area communications network to provide<br>
ongoing control to the powertrain system, including the engine 14, the<br>
electrical machines 56, 72, and the transmission 10.<br>
[0016]		The exemplary powertrain system been constructed in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention. The hybrid transmission 10<br>
receives input torque from torque-generative devices, including the engine 14<br>
and the electrical machines 56, 72, as a result of energy conversion from fuel<br>
or electrical potential stored in electrical energy storage device (ESD) 74. The<br>
ESD 74 typically comprises one or more batteries. Other electrical energy<br>
storage devices that have the ability to store electric power and dispense<br>
electric power may be used in place of the batteries without altering the<br>
concepts of the present invention. The ESD 74 is preferably sized based upon<br>
factors including regenerative requirements, application issues related to<br>
typical road grade and temperature, and, propulsion requirements such as<br>
emissions, power assist and electric range. The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-<br>
coupled to transmission power inverter module (TPIM) 19 via DC lines<br>
referred to as transfer conductor 27. The TPIM 19 transfers electrical energy<br>
to the first electrical machine 56 by transfer conductors 29, and the TPIM 19<br>
similarly transfer electrical energy to the second electrical machine 72 by<br>
transfer conductors 31. Electrical current is transferable between the electrical<br>
machines 56, 72 and the ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is<br>
being charged or discharged. TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters and<br>
respective motor control modules configured to receive motor control<br>
commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or<br>
regeneration functionality.<br><br>
6<br>
[0017]		The electrical machines 56, 72 preferably comprise known<br>
motors/generator devices. In motoring control, the respective inverter<br>
receives current from the ESD and provides AC current to the respective<br>
motor over transfer conductors 29 and 31. In regeneration control, the<br>
respective inverter receives AC current from the motor over the respective<br>
transfer conductor and provides current to the DC lines 27. The net DC<br>
current provided to or from the inverters determines the charge or discharge<br>
operating mode of the electrical energy storage device 74. Preferably,<br>
machine A 56 and machine B 72 are three-phase AC electrical machines and<br>
the inverters comprise complementary three-phase power electronic devices.<br>
[0018]		The elements shown in Fig. 1, and described hereinafter, comprise a<br>
subset of an overall vehicle control architecture, and are operable to provide<br>
coordinated system control of the powertrain system described herein. The<br>
control system is operable to gather and synthesize pertinent information and<br>
inputs, and execute algorithms to control various actuators to achieve control<br>
targets, including such parameters as fuel economy, emissions, performance,<br>
driveability, and protection of hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and<br>
motors 56, 72. The distributed control module architecture of the control<br>
system comprises an engine control module ('ECM') 23, transmission control<br>
module (TCM') 17, battery pack control module ('BPCM') 21, and the<br>
Transmission Power Inverter Module ('TPIM') 19. A hybrid control module<br>
('HCP') 5 provides overarching control and coordination of the<br>
aforementioned control modules. There is a User Interface ('UI') 13 operably<br>
connected to a plurality of devices through which a vehicle operator typically<br>
controls or directs operation of the powertrain, including the transmission 10.<br>
Exemplary vehicle operator inputs to the UI 13 include an accelerator pedal, a<br>
brake pedal, transmission gear selector, and, vehicle speed cruise control.<br>
Within the control system, each of the aforementioned control modules<br>
communicates with other control modules, sensors, and actuators via a local<br>
area network ('LAN') communications bus 6. The LAN bus 6 allows for<br><br>
7<br>
structured communication of control parameters and commands between the<br>
various control modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is<br>
application-specific. By way of example, one communications protocol is the<br>
Society of Automotive Engineers standard J1939. The LAN bus and<br>
appropriate protocols provide for robust messaging and multi-control module<br>
interfacing between the aforementioned control modules, and other control<br>
modules providing functionality such as antilock brakes, traction control, and<br>
vehicle stability.<br>
[0019]		The HCP 5 provides overarching control of the hybrid powertrain<br>
system, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19,<br>
and BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the UI 13 and the<br>
powertrain, the HCP 5 generates various commands, including: an engine<br>
torque command; clutch torque commands for various clutches of the hybrid<br>
transmission 10; and motor torque commands for the electrical machines A<br>
and B, respectively.<br>
[0020]		The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators,<br>
respectively, of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
shown as aggregate line 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine torque<br>
command from the HCP 5, and generates an axle torque request. For<br>
simplicity, ECM 23 is shown generally having bi-directional interface with<br>
engine 14 via aggregate line 35. Various parameters that are sensed by ECM<br>
23 include engine coolant temperature, engine input speed to the transmission,<br>
manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, and ambient pressure. Various<br>
actuators that may be controlled by the ECM 23 include fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules.<br>
[0021]		The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command<br>
control signals, i.e. clutch torque commands to the clutches of the<br>
transmission.<br><br>
8<br>
[0022]		TheBPCM21 interacts with various sensors associated with the ESD<br>
74 to derive information about the state of the ESD 74 to the HCP 5. Such<br>
sensors comprise voltage and electrical current sensors, as well as ambient<br>
sensors operable to measure operating conditions of the ESD 74 including,<br>
e.g., temperature and internal resistance of the ESD 74. Sensed parameters<br>
include ESD voltage, VBAT, ESD current, IBAT and ESD temperature, TBAT.<br>
Derived parameters preferably include, ESD internal resistance, RBAT, ESD<br>
state-of-charge, SOC, and other states of the ESD, including available<br>
electrical power, PBAT_MINand PBA+_MAX-<br>
[0023]		The Transmission Power Inverter Module (TPIM) 19 includes the<br>
aforementioned power inverters and machine control modules configured to<br>
receive motor control commands and control inverter states therefrom to<br>
provide motor drive or regeneration functionality. The TPIM 19 is operable<br>
to generate torque commands for machines A and B based upon input from<br>
the HCP 5, which is driven by operator input through UI 13 and system<br>
operating parameters. Motor torques are implemented by the control<br>
system, including the TPIM 19, to control the machines A and B. Individual<br>
motor speed signals are derived by the TPIM 19 from the motor phase<br>
information or conventional rotation sensors. The TPIM 19 determines and<br>
communicates motor speeds to the HCP 5.<br>
[0024]		Each of the aforementioned control modules of the control system is<br>
preferably a general-purpose digital computer generally comprising a<br>
microprocessor or central processing unit, read only memory (ROM), random<br>
access memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only memory<br>
(EPROM), high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog<br>
(D/A) circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate<br>
signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each control module has a set of<br>
control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations<br>
stored in ROM and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br><br>
9<br>
computer. Information transfer between the various computers is preferably<br>
accomplished using the aforementioned LAN 6.<br><br>
10<br>
[0025]		Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the control<br>
modules are typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units and are operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute<br>
control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device,<br>
using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular<br>
intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during<br>
ongoing engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be<br>
executed in response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[0026]		The action described hereinafter occurs during active operation of the<br>
vehicle, i.e. that period of time when operation of the engine and electrical<br>
machines are enabled by the vehicle operator, typically through a 'key-on'<br>
action. Quiescent periods include periods of time when operation of the<br>
engine and electrical machines are disabled by the vehicle operator, typically<br>
through a 'key-off action. In response to an operator's action, as captured by<br>
the UI 13, the supervisory HCP control module 5 and one or more of the other<br>
control modules determine required transmission output torque, To.<br>
Selectively operated components of the hybrid transmission 10 are<br>
appropriately controlled and manipulated to respond to the operator demand.<br>
For example, in the exemplary embodiment shown in Fig. 1, when the<br>
operator has selected a forward drive range and manipulates either the<br>
accelerator pedal or the brake pedal, the HCP 5 determines how and when the<br>
vehicle is to accelerate or decelerate. The HCP 5 also monitors the parametric<br>
states of the torque-generative devices, and determines the output of the<br>
transmission required to effect a desired rate of acceleration or deceleration.<br>
Under the direction of the HCP 5, the transmission 10 operates over a range of<br>
output speeds from slow to fast in order to meet the operator demand.<br><br>
11<br>
[0027]		Referring now to Fig. 2, a method and apparatus to estimate a state-<br>
of-life ('SOL') of an energy storage device useable in a hybrid control system<br>
in real-time is described. The exemplary method and apparatus to estimate<br>
state-of-life ('SOL') of the energy storage device in the hybrid control system<br>
in real-time is disclosed in detail in U.S. Patent Application No.<br>
-/- Attorney Docket No. GP-308433, entitled "Method and<br>
Apparatus for Real-Time Life Estimation of an Electric Energy Storage<br>
Device in a Hybrid Electric Vehicle", which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference. The exemplary method and apparatus to estimate state-of-life<br>
comprises an algorithm that monitors an electrical current and a state-of-<br>
charge and temperature of the electrical energy storage device 74 during<br>
operation. Temperature of the electrical energy storage device 74 is further<br>
monitored during quiescent periods of ESD operation. Quiescent periods of<br>
ESD operation are characterized by ESD power flow that is de minimus<br>
whereas active periods of ESD operation ,are characterized by ESD power<br>
flow that is not de minimus. That is to say, quiescent periods of ESD<br>
operation are generally characterized by no or minimal current flow into or out<br>
of the ESD. With respect to an ESD associated with a hybrid vehicle<br>
propulsion system for example, quiescent periods of ESD operation may be<br>
associated with periods of vehicle inactivity (e.g. powertrain, including<br>
electric machines, is inoperative such as during periods when the vehicle is not<br>
being driven and accessory loads are off but may include such periods<br>
characterized by parasitic current draws as are required for continuing certain<br>
controller operations including, for example, the operations associated with<br>
the present invention). Active periods of ESD operation in contrast may be<br>
associated with periods of vehicle activity (e.g. accessory loads are on and/or<br>
the powertrain, including electric machines, is operative such as during<br>
periods when the vehicle is being driven wherein current flows may be into or<br>
out of the ESD). The state-of-life ('SOL') of the electrical energy storage<br>
device 74 is determined based upon the ESD current, the state-of-charge of the<br>
ESD, and the temperature of the ESD during quiescent and active periods of<br><br>
12<br>
operation. The inputs to calculation of SOL, include ESD internal resistance<br>
RBAT, ESD temperature TBAT ESD state-of-charge SOC, and ESD current IBAT-<br>
These are known operating parameters measured or derived within the<br>
distributed control system. From these parameters, an A-h integration factor<br>
110, a depth of discharge ('DOD') factor 112, a driving temperature factor,<br>
TDRIVE, 114 and a resting temperature factor, TREST 116 are determined, and<br>
provided as input to determine a parameter for SOL. The operating<br>
parameters used to calculate SOL include: ESD current, IBAT, which is<br>
monitored in real-time, measured in amperes, and integrated as a function of<br>
time; magnitude of electrical current flowing through the ESD 74 during each<br>
active charging and discharging event; ESD state-of-charge ('SOC'),<br>
including depth-of-discharge ('DOD'); ESD temperature factor during active<br>
periods of operation, TDRIVE, and ESD temperature factor during inactive<br>
periods of operation, TREST.<br>
[0028]		Referring again to Fig. 2, a schematic diagram is shown,<br>
demonstrating an exemplary method for estimating the state-of-life of the ESD<br>
74 in real-time, based upon monitored inputs. The method is preferably<br>
executed as one or more algorithms in one of the controllers of the control<br>
system, typically the HCP 5. The estimated state-of-life of the ESD 74<br>
('SOLK') is preferably stored as a scalar value in a non-volatile memory<br>
location for reference, updating, and for resetting, each occurring at<br>
appropriate points during life of the vehicle and the ESD 74. Overall,<br>
determining a parametric value for the SOL comprises monitoring in real-time<br>
an ESD current 1BAT (in amperes), an ESD temperature TBAT, an ESD voltage<br>
VBAT, an ESD resistance RBAT, and a ESD state-of-charge ('SOC'). Each of the<br>
aforementioned factors, i.e. the integrated ESD current, depth of discharge,<br>
driving temperature factor, and resting temperature factor, are combined,<br>
preferably by a summing operation, with a previously determined state-of-life<br>
factor, SOLK, to determine a parametric value for the SOL, i.e. SOLK+|, shown<br>
as an output to block 120. The algorithm to determine the state-of-life factor,<br>
SOLK+1, is preferably executed multiple times during each trip. When the<br><br>
13<br>
engine/vehicle is initially started or turned on, there is an initial state-of-life<br>
factor, SOLK, which is used in calculating subsequent values for SOL, and is<br>
shown as SOLSAVED 128. The SOLSAVED factor 128 is only used once during<br>
each trip, and is supplanted in future calculations during the trip the SOLK+1<br>
factor output from Blocks 120, 122, and 124, which is shown as Block 130.<br>
Similarly, the resting temperature factor output from Block 116 is only used<br>
during the first execution of the algorithm to calculate SOL after the<br>
engine/vehicle is initially started or turned on, as is indicated by the 1NIT<br>
block 126. On subsequent executions of the algorithm to calculate SOL, the<br>
resting temperature factor is omitted from the calculation of SOL.<br>
[0029]		Referring now to Fig. 3, a method and apparatus to predict or<br>
estimate a plurality of future or potential life gradients of a state-of-life<br>
parameter of an energy storage device useable in a hybrid control system in<br>
real-time is described. The exemplary method and apparatus to estimate the<br>
plurality of future life gradients of the state-of-life ('SOL') of the energy<br>
storage device in the hybrid control system in real-time is disclosed in detail in<br>
U.S. Patent Application No.____/____________, Attorney Docket No. GP-<br>
308435, entitled "Method for Operating a Hybrid Electric Powertrain Based<br>
on Predictive Effects Upon an Electric Energy Storage Device". Therein is<br>
described a method and apparatus for calculating, a priori, a range of effects<br>
on state-of-life of an electrical energy storage device for a hybrid vehicle. The<br>
method includes determining potential changes in an operating state for the<br>
electrical energy storage device. This includes selecting an array of potential<br>
values for an operating parameter e.g. electrical current, over a continuum<br>
from a maximum charging current to a maximum discharging current, from<br>
which is determined or predicted a corresponding array of effects or changes<br>
upon operating state values, e.g. effects upon state-of-life. Each predicted<br>
change in the operating state is determined based upon and corresponding to<br>
one of the array of values for the operating parameter of the electrical energy<br>
storage device. The predicted change in the state-of-life is based upon: time-<br>
based integration of the electrical current, depth of discharge of the energy<br><br>
14<br>
storage device, and, operating temperature of the electrical energy storage<br>
device, which are determined for each of the array of potential values for<br>
electrical current.<br>
[0030]		Referring now to Fig. 4, a control algorithm for hybrid vehicle<br>
operation which targets a life objective for the electrical energy storage device<br>
74 is now described. The algorithm is preferably executed in the<br>
aforementioned control system of the hybrid vehicle, preferably during one of<br>
the loop cycles, to effect real-time control and adjustments to the operation of<br>
the powertrain based upon prior use of the hybrid vehicle and the ESD 74. A<br>
primary control objective of the algorithm comprises controlling operation of<br>
the electrical machines 56, 72, including motive torque outputs, in charging<br>
and discharging, to manage life of the ESD 74.<br>
[0031]		In the exemplary system, ESD power, PBAT , as a parameter that<br>
affects service life of the energy storage system 74, and is controllable by the<br>
hybrid control system. ESD power, PBAT = IBATA2 / RBAT. A relationship<br>
between the parametric value for ESD power, PBAT and a target life objective<br>
for the ESD is established. This permits generation of a control algorithm<br>
which is operative to ongoingly and regularly control electrical power<br>
exchanged between ESD 74 to the electrical motors 56, 72 such that the<br>
operating state, e.g. state-of-life (SOL), of the ESD is less than a<br>
predetermined value when the target life objective for the ESD is attained.<br>
The control algorithm is preferably executed by the control system during one<br>
of the previously described preset loop cycles. This algorithm is described in<br>
detail hereinbelow.<br>
[0032]		Referring again to Fig. 4, in overall operation, the algorithm uses as<br>
input parameters a normalized value for state-of-life (SOL) of the ESD, a<br>
time-based state-of-life gradient based upon ESD power, an accumulated<br>
elapsed time in service, and an accumulated distance. A normalized life factor<br>
is calculated based upon the accumulated time, and accumulated distance<br>
(Block 200). The normalized life factor, output from block 200, and the<br>
normalized value for state-of-life are used to calculate a required, desired or<br><br>
15'<br>
target gradient for life (Block 210). The time-based state-of-life gradient<br>
based upon ESD power is normalized along the time axis (Block 220). The<br>
required gradient for life, output from block 210 and the normalized state-of-<br>
life gradient based upon ESD power output from block 220, both converted to<br>
a z-domain, comprising a normalized domain ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, are<br>
input to a cost function (block 230) which generates an output of cost<br>
associated with ESD power, PBAT-<br>
[0033]		The preferred operating state, i.e. the state-of-life (SOL) parameter<br>
described hereinabove, is normalized as follows:<br>
	SOL = 0, for a new unused ESD, e.g. at start of service life; and,<br>
	SOL = 1, for a fully expended ESD, e.g. at an end of service life<br>
('EOL').<br>
[0034]		The normalized life factor output (in the z-domain) from Block 200 is<br>
determined as follows. The energy storage system has a target life objective<br>
defined in terms of time and/or distance. For example, a hybrid vehicle might<br>
specify a target life objective in terms of time of 8 years and a target life<br>
objective in terms of distance of 160,000 kilometers (100,000 miles). In this<br>
example, an exemplary ESD which remains in service for eight years or<br>
160,000 kilometers (100,000 miles) of operation has met the target life<br>
objective.<br>
[0035]		The accumulated time, also referred to as a Total ESD Time, is<br>
defined as the total cumulative time that the energy storage system has been in<br>
service, including all periods of vehicle activity and inactivity and all active<br>
and quiescent periods of ESD operation. In this embodiment, the ECM<br>
preferably includes a timing device which is able to measure and record<br>
elapsed operation time, including time when the vehicle ignition is off and the<br>
system powered down. Under a circumstance wherein a particular ESD is<br>
replaced with a new ESD, the accumulated time value is reset to zero. Under<br>
a circumstance wherein a particular ESD is replaced with a partially expended<br>
or used ESD, the accumulated time is reset to an estimated total cumulative<br>
time that the partially expended ESD had previously been in service.<br><br>
16<br>
A normalized time life parameter is defined, using the same time units,<br><br>
The ESD target life objective for time is 8 years for the exemplary system<br>
being described.<br>
[0036]		The accumulated distance, also referred to as a Total ESD Distance,<br>
is defined as a total cumulative distance of operation with the ESD, which is<br>
measurable in the ECM or other controller of the distributed control<br>
architecture. Under a circumstance wherein a. particular ESD is replaced with<br>
a new system, the accumulated distance is reset to zero. Under a circumstance<br>
wherein a particular ESD is replaced with a partially expended or used ESD,<br>
the accumulated distance can be reset to an estimated total cumulative distance<br>
that the expended or used ESD previously experienced. A normalized<br>
distance life parameter is defined, using the same distance units, as the<br>
following:<br><br>
The ESD target life objective for distance is 160,000 kilometers (100,000<br>
miles) for the exemplary system being described.<br>
[0037]		Determining the Normalized Life Factor (in z-domain), output from<br>
block 200, comprises capturing parametric values for accumulated time, i.e.<br>
Total ESD Time, and accumulated distance, i.e. Total ESD Distance, and<br>
normalizing them as described herein above and wherein z = 0 at the Start of<br>
Life Cycle of the ESD, i.e. when the timer for accumulated time and the<br>
distance monitor for accumulated distance each begin counting; and, z = 1 at<br>
the ESD target life objective, or Targeted End of Life ('EOL').<br><br>
17<br>
[0038]		A preferred method for calculating the Normalized Life Parameter<br>
comprises selecting a maximum value between the Normalized Time Life<br>
Parameter and the Normalized Distance Life Parameter, shown below:<br>
Normalized Life Parameter =<br>
MAXIMUM (Normalized Time Life Parameter, Normalized Distance Life Parameter)<br>
[0039]		In the exemplary embodiment, wherein ESD Time Life Target is 8<br>
years and the ESD Distance Life Target is 160,000 kilometers (100,000<br>
miles), a linear budget of substantially 20,000 kilometers (12,500 miles) per<br>
year of service is assumed. The Normalized Life Parameter could simply be<br>
defined as follows, in Table 1:<br>
Table 1<br>
Total ESD	Total ESD	Dominating	Normalized Life<br>
Time	Distance	Factor	Parameter (z)<br>
		(Time	or<br>
		Distance)	<br>
4 years	32,000 km	Time	0.50<br>
	(20,000 miles)		<br>
2 years	80,000 km	Distance	0.50<br>
	(50,000 miles)		<br>
4 years	80,000 km	Both	0.50<br>
	(50,000 miles)		<br>
9 years	112,000 km	Time	1.00 = Target<br>
	(70,000 miles)		EOL<br>
5 years	160,000 km	Distance	1.00 = Target<br>
	(100,000 miles)		EOL<br>
[0040]		Although the preferred embodiment of this invention involves the use<br>
of time and/or distance in defining the definition of targeted end of life<br>
('EOL'), other parameters can be used.<br><br>
18<br>
[0041]		The time domain parameters are converted to normalized life<br>
parameters, in the z-domain. It is desirable to be able to convert a differential<br>
amount of run time (in dt) to a differential amount of Normalized Life<br>
Parameter (in dz), for ease of comparisons.<br>
[0042]		The percent of time the vehicle is operated, i.e. Total Vehicle Run<br>
Time, is compared to total in-service time of the vehicle, i.e. Total Vehicle<br>
Time, to estimate a percent of vehicle run time versus total vehicle time. Total<br>
vehicle time ideally has the same value as Total BSD Time. The Total<br>
Vehicle Run Time Percentage is defined as follows:<br>
[0043]		Total Vehicle Run Time Percentage= <br>
[0044]		In the exemplary embodiment, a vehicle that is determined to be<br>
operating or running for 5% of total time (Total Vehicle Run Time Percentage<br>
= 5%), the following analysis is shown with reference to Table 2, below:<br>
Table 2<br>
Total	Total	Dominating	Normalized	Total		Total ESD<br>
ESD	ESD	Factor	Life	ESD		Run Time to<br>
Time	Distance		Parameter	Time	to	EOL<br>
			(z)	EOL		<br>
4 years	20,000	Time	0.50	4 years	/	8 x 0.05 =<br>
	m i les			0.5 =	8	0.40 years<br>
				years		<br>
2 years	50,000	Distance	0.50	2 years	/	4 x 0.05<br>
	miles			0.5 =	4	0.20 years<br>
				years		<br>
[0045]		Referring again to Table 2, examples are provided to explain system<br>
operation. Exemplary values for two vehicles are shown, wherein Total ESD<br>
Time and Total ESD Distance are known. One of ESD Time and Distance is<br>
determined to be a dominating factor based upon whether the exemplary<br><br>
19<br>
vehicle is likely to attain a target life objective of time or distance, as<br>
determinable based upon the Normalized Life Parameter. When the<br>
dominating factor is time, then the Total ESD Time to EOL equals the Target<br>
Total ESD Time. When the dominating factor is Distance, then Total ESD<br>
Time to EOL equals is determined based upon Distance, and is less than the<br>
ESD Target time life objective.<br>
[0046]		When a new ESD is installed, thus setting z = 0, Total ESD Run<br>
Time to EOL is the following:<br>
Total ESD Run Time to EOL = Total Vehicle Run Time % x ESD Time Life Target<br>
[0047]		After the ESD has been used (z &gt; 0), the Total ESD Run Time to End<br>
oflife('EOL')is<br><br>
The Total ESD Run Time to EOL effectively converts differential changes in<br>
run time (dt) to differential changes in the Normalized Life Parameter (dz),<br>
i.e.,<br><br>
[0048]		The state-of-life gradient (dSOL/dt) estimated as a function of<br>
electrical current and ESD power (PBAT), is described hereinabove, and<br>
comprises estimating ESD state-of-life time gradient as a function of ESD<br>
Power for an array of preselected current levels.<br>
[0049]		Referring again to Fig. 4, it is relatively straightforward to normalize<br>
time and transform a time gradient to a normalized gradient (notated as<br>
dSOL/dz). By example, when the targeted ESD life objective is defined as a<br>
run time, in seconds of Total ESD Run Time to EOL, the normalized state-of-<br>
life gradient is defined as follows:<br><br><br>
20<br>
[0051]		Note that normalized gradient is defined in such a way that if the<br>
energy storage system averages a normalized gradient of one (1) or less, then<br>
the life objective is met. Similarly, if the normalized gradient averages greater<br>
than one, then the life objective is not met.<br>
[0052]		This provides a way of coupling the target objective to a key control<br>
variable gradient. A control system must be designed to control ESD power in<br>
such a way that at the end of the energy storage system life target (z- 1), the<br>
SOL is less than 1. That is, over the life of the energy storage system (from z<br>
= 0 to z = 1), the average, and since normalized, the integral of dSOL/dz must<br>
be less than or equal to 1 for life objectives to be met. More particularly, as<br>
shown in Eq. 1, which is executable as an algorithm in the control system:<br><br>
[0054]		Referring now to Fig. 5, a datagraph showing performance of an<br>
exemplary system with an ESD'operating using the system described herein,<br>
wherein the x-axis comprises the normalized life factor of time or distance,<br>
converted to the z-domain, and the y-axis comprises the state-of-life (SOL).<br>
Line 90 comprises a representative system wherein a change in the state-of-<br>
life of the ESD increases linearly with a change in the normalized life factor in<br>
the z-domain, such that end of life criteria are just met. Line 96 shows an<br>
actual system, having exemplary Points A and B. Point A represents a system<br>
wherein ambient conditions or operation of the system led to aggressive use of<br>
the ESD, and thus to advanced aging of the ESD or high SOL of the ESD,<br>
such that it is possible that the ESD may be expended before the target service<br>
life. A first line 92 comprises a normalized target gradient line for Point A,<br>
calculated from Point A to the end of life of the device which comprises the<br>
SOL meeting the normalized life factor. In the condition wherein the system<br>
has reached an operating condition shown as point A, the control system<br>
estimates the array of parametric values for future SOL based upon the array<br>
of ESD current levels, IBAT. The system is operable to match a parametric<br>
value for PBAT and corresponding value for IBAT that accomplishes the<br><br>
21<br>
normalized gradient, using the algorithm developed in Eq. 1, above. This<br>
likely leads to less aggressive use of the ESD during vehicle operation.<br>
[0055]		Point B represents a system wherein ambient conditions or operation<br>
of the system led to less aggressive use of the ESD, thus leading to retarded<br>
aging of the ESD or low SOL of the ESD, such that it is possible that the ESD<br>
will not be expended upon reaching the target service life. A second line 94<br>
comprises a normalized target gradient line for Point B, calculated from Point<br>
B to the end of life of the device which comprises the SOL meeting the<br>
normalized life factor. In the condition wherein the system has reached an<br>
operating condition shown as point B, the control system estimates the array<br>
of parametric values for future SOL based upon the array of ESD current<br>
levels, IBAT- The system is operable to match a parametric value for PBAT and<br>
corresponding value for IBAT that accomplishes the normalized gradient, using<br>
the algorithm developed in Eq. 1, above. This likely leads to more aggressive<br>
use of the ESD during vehicle operation.<br>
[0056]		Referring now to Figs. 6A, 6B, and 6C, further details of the<br>
operation of the system are provided. Fig. 6A shows a normalized SOL<br>
gradient plotted as a function of ESD power, PBAT, over a range that is a<br>
continuum from charging to discharging the ESD, with exemplary target<br>
gradient Points A and B, from Fig. 5. Fig. 6C shows a line demonstrating an<br>
operating cost as a function of the normalized SOL gradient, wherein the<br>
target line, at the target gradient value, corresponds to the Line 90 shown in<br>
Fig. 5. Operating costs generally comprise costs associated with fuel and<br>
electrical energy consumption associated with a specific operating point of the<br>
powertrain system for the vehicle. This graph demonstrates that there is a low<br>
operating cost associated with a normalized SOL gradient that is less than the<br>
target, i.e. falling below Line 90 of Fig. 5. Conversely, operating cost<br>
increases as the normalized SOL gradient increases greater than the target line.<br>
Fig. 6B can be constructed using information from Figs. 6A and 6C, wherein<br>
operating cost is plotted as a function of ESD power, PBAT, with lines<br>
representing costs associated with operating the exemplary system starting at<br><br>
22<br>
Points A and B plotted, and correlated to analogous operating points shown in<br>
Fig. 6A. It is readily demonstrated the relative magnitude of a cost differential<br>
associated with the same ESD power, PBAT, at different initial starting points.<br>
In other words, operating with SOL above the target gradient, i.e. Line 90 of<br>
FIG. 5 is generally more costly and less preferred than operating with SOL at<br>
or below the target gradient. Thus, the control system can execute an<br>
algorithm operative to control the power transmitted from the electrical energy<br>
storage device such that the electrical energy storage device generally tracks<br>
and converges on the target gradient, preferably avoids SOL in excess of the<br>
target gradient, and does not reach end-of-life when the target life objective,<br>
e.g. time or distance, is attained.<br>

preferred embodiments and modifications thereto. Further modifications and<br>
alterations may occur to others upon reading and understanding the<br>
specification. It is intended to include all such modifications and alterations<br>
