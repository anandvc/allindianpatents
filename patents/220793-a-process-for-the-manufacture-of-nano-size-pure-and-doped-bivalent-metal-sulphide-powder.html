				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of nano-size pure and doped bivalent metal sulphide powder. This invention particularly relates to a novel method for the manufacture of bivalent metal sulphide nanopowder and doped bivalent metal sulphide nanopowder, such as pure Zn, Cd, Pb sulphide nano-size powder and Zn, Cd, Pb sulphide nano-size powder doped with rare earth and transition metals.<br>
These powders are used in various fields, such as electroluminescent materials (phosphors), infrared (ir) windows, solar cells, pigments and such other related fields. With a dispersion in a suitable matrix, they also find applications in thin film eletroluminescent (TFEL) devices. Because of the high surface area and surface energy, the physical and chemical properties of these nanometer sized particles markedly differ from those of bulk materials.<br>
The present day methods of preparing ZnS nanopowders mainly consists of solution phase reaction. Reference may be made to "Comprehensive Inorganic Chemistry Vol. 3, First edition, eds., J. C. Bailar Jr., H. J. Emeleus, Sir Ronald Nyholm, A. F. Trotman-Dickenson, (Pergamon Press Ltd., Headington HillHall, Oxford, 1973) p. 227" wherein ZnS is prepared by passing hydrogen sulphide (H2S) to a solution of Zn2+ ions buffered to pH 3, zinc sulphide is quantitatively precipitated. The product is heated in a nitrogen stream at 650°C to give the cubic zinc blende form and at 1150°C to give hexagonal wurzite. Single crystals of the cubic form may be grown hydrothermally from polycrystalline ZnS and aqueous Na2S and NaOH.<br>
The main drawbacks of the above process are:<br>
(i) Uncontrolled nucleation and subsequent growth of the precipitated particles in a bulk aqueous medium generates large particles with a wide size disribution. (ii) It requires high temperature for the preparation of ZnS particles (iii) The product of this proces contain cationic impurities<br><br>
Reference may also be made to Edward J. Donahue, Arlette Roxburg and Michael Yurchenko in "Materials Research Bulletin, Vol. 33, No. 2 (1998) pp 323-329" wherein ZnS is prepared through sol-gel route using organic dithiols. In this process fifty millilitres of a 10 mol% solution of zinc chloride (Fluka) in ethanedithiol (Aldrich) was prepared in an inert atmosphere glove box (Tek-Vac Model 323); the dithiol was transferred via syringe to minimize exposure. The mixture was then gently heated overnight under flowing dry argon at 65°C. All chemicals were used without purification, and the effluent from the reflux was bubbled through 0.1 M silver nitrate (Aesar) solution in order to test for the evolution of HCI. The reflux was allowed to cool, and the resultant clear sol was collected. The bubblers containing the silver nitrate were emptied, and the solution removed from them was filtered. The recovered precipitate was dried in a vacuum oven and weighed. The sol was then analyzed by TGA (Perkin-Elmer Model TGA-7) under flowing nitrogen to determine the appropriate processing temperature. Samples of the sol were then fired at 600°C under flowing argon, producing highly crystalline ZnS, as determined by X-ray. However, these samples were found by TGA to be highly contaminated with carbon. A three-step process was developed in which the samples were heated under flowing air for 10 min at 300°C to remove excess dithiol, fired at 550°C under argon for crystallization, and heated under air again at 400°C to remove any excess carbon. The effluent was bubled through nitric acid and then water while the sols were heated, effectively eliminating all unpleasant odours and allowing the work to be conducted in a fume hood.<br>
Main drawbacks of the above processes may be summarized as:<br>
(i) It requires high processing temperature for the preparation of ZnS particles; and thus giving rise to the possibility of agglomerate formation, (ii) It needs many processing steps, (iii) This process is very costly.<br>
Reference may further be made to A. R. Kortan, R. Hull, R. L. Opila, M. G. Bawendi, M. L. Steigerwald, P. J. Carroll and L. E. Brus in "J. Am. Chem. Soc. 112<br><br>
(1990) pp 1327-1332" wherein a sulphide solution of zinc was made by dissolving 150 µmol of Na2S in 40 mL micellar solution (heptane solution of bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate, disodium salt (0.12 M) and water (0.96 M)). This solution was injected with stirring into 255 mL of "micellar solution containing 160 µL of 1 M aqueous Zn(ClO4)2. To this was added, dropwise, 70 µL of 1 M Zn(ClO4)2- Finally thiophenol (70 µL in 10 mL of heptane) was injected with stirring, immediately followed by 1 mL of pyridine. The solution became turbid at this point. A white powder obtained by filtering on a fine frit was washed three times with petrolium ether.<br>
The main drawback of the above process is the contamination of cation impurities with the generated ZnS particles.<br>
Reference may also be made to Ahmet Celikkaya and Mufit Akinc in " J. Am. Ceram. Soc. 73 (1990) pp 2360- 2365" wherein a stock solution of zinc ions was prepared by dissolving Zn(NO3)2.6H20 in deionized water and then filtering through 0.1 um cellulose nitrate membrane filters to give a final zinc ion concentration of 1.56 M. An 8.3 mL aliquot of this stock was transferred into a beaker, and nitric acid solution (0.1 N or 0.01 N) was added to bring the total volume to slightly less than 250 mL. The solution was heated to reaction temperature, the desired amount of thioacetamide (TAA) was added and the final volume was brought to 250 mL. The beaker was then immersed in a water bath at the set reaction temperature. After a certain period of aging, a bluish tint in the solution was judged to indicate the onset of precipitation. The time interval necessary to induce the change in the solution colour was recorded. Aliquot (30 mL) were collected and quenched to 15°C periodically after precipitation had started. A number of combination of experimental variables were investigated. Ageing temperature of 60°, 70° and 80°C were employed. Initial thioacetamide concentrations were varied to give [TAA]o/[Zn]0 ratios of 4, 8 and 16 for pH 1 and pH 2. Initial zinc ion concentration [Zn]0 was held constant at 0.05 M in all experiment.<br>
The main drawbacks of the above process are:<br><br>
(i) The particle size distribution was controlled by two competing processes, rate of sulphide ion generation and rate of growth of agglomerates, (ii) The particle size of this process is in the submicron range.<br>
Reference may further be made to G. Counio, S. Esnouf, T. Gacoin and J. P. Boilot in "J. Phys. Chem. 100 (1996) pp 20021-20026" wherein CdS:Mn nanocrystals were prepared in inverted micelles from water/AOT (sodium salt of bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate)/heptane microemulsions. In the experiment, the AOT and water concentrations were taken as 0.5 and 2.5 mol.L"1 respectively. A solution was prepared containing the cadmium and manganese salts dissolved in water droplets. This solution was then added to the same volume of a similar solution containing sodium sulfide. In all experiments, the initial concentrations of Cd2+, Mn2+ and S2" dissolved in the water pools were taken respectively equal to 0.2, 0.12 and 0.38 mol.L"1. After a few seconds, Cds: Mn colloids were formed in inverted micelles. The addition of pyridine to the solution (1.4X10"2 mol.L'1) was found to improve the sulfide precipitation yield through a mechanism which was not well understood. At the same time, the pyridine molecule complexes the surface of the nanoparticles which were thus no more stable in the inverted micelles. This allows the separation of the sulfides as a powder of pyridine-capped nanoparticles. This powder was washed with large amounts of petroleum ether to eliminate residual AOT, and the nanocrystals were finally dispersed in pure pyridine, giving a transparent yellow-orange colloid solution of CdS:Mn. The average size of the nanoclusters was found to fluctuate between 1.2 and 2.4 nm.<br>
The main drawbacks of the above process are:<br>
(i) The generated CdS:Mn particles are contaminated with cation impurities, (ii) The mechanism of using pyridine as surface capping agent which allows the separation of the particles from the microemulsion was not established.<br>
Reference may also be made to Minati Chatterjee and Amitava Patra in " J. Am. Ceram. Soc. 84 (2001) pp 1439-44" wherein cadmium sulphide nanoparticles were prepared by microemulsion method using sorbitan monooleate and thioacetamide. The<br><br>
starting materials for cadmium sulphide (CdS) was cadmium acetate (AR Grade, Glaxo, India) and thioacetamide (GR Grade, Loba Chemie, India). Aqueous solutions of cadmium acetate (of varying concentrations) and thioacetamide were prepared by dissolving the respective salts in deionized water. The cadmium acetate and thioacetamide solutions were mixed under stirring in the desired proportions so as to obtain homogeneous solutions (called "CT") of varying Cd2+/thioacetamide mole ratios. The support solvent containing 5 vol% of sorbitan monooleate in cyclohexane was used for emulsification, i.e. for the preparation of water-in-oil (w/o) type emulsion in the present study. The volume ratio of the CT:cyclohexane was 1:4 in all the experiments. A measured volume of the support solvent was taken in a closed glass container. The solution CT was then dispersed in the support solvent under mechanical agitation of 500 rpm to obtain a w/o emulsion. The stabilized emulsion was then subjected to an ultrasonic treatment (26 kHz) for 10 min at ambient temperature and was then placed in an oil bath kept at a temperature of 80° ± 1°C. The emulsion was aged at 80° ± 1°C for 10 min under stirring and then removed from the bath. Following the above procedure, altogether four experiments with varying concentrations of Cd2+ were performed. Another set of experiments were performed with increasing ageing time, i.e. 20 and 30 min., at the above temperature using a fixed Cd2+ concentration of 0.05M keeping other parameters unaltered.<br>
The CdS particles were collected from the reverse micellar solutions by adding a known volume of methanol (GR grade). Immediate separation of particles occurred which were collected by centrifugation at 6000 rpm. To remove the last traces of adhered impurities, the particles were first washed twice with methanol followed by acetone (GR grade), each time collecting the particles centrifugually as described above followed by its dispersion in the washing solvents. The washed particles were dried at 60°C. Particle size distribution was in the range 10-50 nm.<br>
Using the above said process, yield of the product was 40wt%.<br>
The main drawback of the above process is the low yield of the product and therefore is industrially unviable.<br><br>

Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for manufacturing doped bivalent metal sulphide nanopowder with substances such as rare earth and transition metal. Still another object of the  present invention is to  provide a process for manufacturing nanopowder of varying particle size and size distribution.<br>

In another embodiment of the present invention, concentration of sulphide source such as thioacetamide taken in the solution is in the range of 0.025-6 M.<br>

In the process of the present invention, a novel method has been provided for the manufacture of high yield, impurity-free pure and doped bivalent metal sulphide<br><br>
nanocrystalline particles by non-obvious inventive step of using organic amine compound such as monoethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, pyridine.<br>
Because of high basicity of triethylamine, TEA (KB = 9.6X10-4 at 25°C) compared to that of pyridine (KB = 1.7X10-9 at 25°C), the former is more advantageous for accelerating the process of particle separation from the emulsion system. The mechanism of particles separation using TEA may be represented as the following steps: (i) Triethylamine (TEA) in presence of H2O forms triethylammoniurn hydroxide:<br>
(C2H5)3N + H20	(C2H5)3N+HOH-<br>
(ii) Triethylammonium hydroxide increases pH of the system by liberating hydroxide (OH-) ions.<br>
(iii) The OH- ion attacks C- atom of the ester carbonyl (&gt;C=O) group in the surfactant molecule (sorbitan monooleate), causing hydrolysis as follows:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 (iv) Hydrolysis of the sorbitan monooleate destabilizes the emulsion system followed by the agglomeration and flocculation of the generated particles<br>
Thus the novelty of the process lies in the manufacture of impurity free pure and also doped bivalent metal sulphide nanopowders with high yield of product formation and the non-obvious inventive step lies in the use of the organic amine compound to increase the yield of impurity free nanoproduct.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
(i) The process  for the preparation of pure and doped bivalent metal  sulphide<br>
nanopowders does not require any sophisticated instruments.<br>
(ii) The process provides nanoparticles of high purity level.<br>
(iii) The process of the present invention directly provides the end product and does not<br>
require any post-processing steps like high energy ball-milling, screening, thus avoiding<br>
possibility of contamination.<br>
(iv) The process requires low (~80°C) crystallization temperature, thus the process is<br>
energy efficient.<br>
(v) The process involves minimum agglomeration, thus resulting in exhibiting improve<br>
characteristics.<br>
(vi) It is a tailor-made process, as the particle size and size distribution can be varied<br>
according to the necessity.<br>
(vii) The method is cost-effective.<br><br><br><br>
