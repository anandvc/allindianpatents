				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention generally relates to a herbal health formulation and a method of manufacturing the same. The said formulation is used as herbal remedy for treating diabetes, regulating fat metabolism and for use as an antiviral agent. The invention also focuses on the aspect of strengthening the general immune mechanism of the body on account of the antiviral properties associated with the herbal formulation as arrayed in the present invention.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Diabetes, as a disease is known since pre-historic times. Diabetes is a chronic disease that effects almost 16 million people in the US and more than 125 million people worldwide. Diabetes is also called as 'silent killer' on account of the fact that the disease in itself does not kill but the complications arising in unattended cases in diabetes lead to a variety of viral, cardiac and vascular complications which kill a person.<br>
The diabetes as a disease is primarily concerned with improper glucose metabolism. The body uses ' insulin' i a hormone secreted by pancreas which helps in regulating the blood level of glucose or blood sugar.<br>
In the people afflicted with diabetes, there is either no insulin production or little production. Also, if the insulin production is there, but, the same is not picked up by cells of the body, the result is diabetes. Since insulin is responsible for facilitating uptake of glucose by cells to give energy or ATP, the absence/ meagre presence of insulin results in a high level of glucose in the blood, causing excessive urination, constant thirst and hunger. There are two main types of Diabetes mellitus, Type I and Type II. Type I is the more severe form and accounts for 5 to 10% diabetes in which the body does not provide any insulin. Without regular injections of insulin the sufferer lapses into a coma and dies. Individuals suffering from Type I are termed as<br>
totally insulin dependent. Type II diabetes, is the most prevalent type and is a metabolic disorder wherein either enough insulin is not made or insulin produced is not able to meet a person's needs. This disorder can be managed by diet control or medication. Medical complications arising from diabetes include artherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, retinal damage, neurological damage and blindness.<br>
However, the oral ingestion of medications of synthetic origin (Allopathic system) over a period of time results in body becoming immune to a particular type of medicine, which in long run becomes ineffective. Moreover, there also occurs problem of side effects.<br>
Hence, there is an imminent need for developing a method of treatment for diabetes using herbal origin products which do not have side effects, and also enhance the body's general upkeep and immune system.<br>
The prior art profile contains several instances of herbal medicine, herbal compositions and herbal products for treatment of diabetes.<br>
The US Patent No 5318986 issued in favor of Hara et al discloses a method for developing a novel inhibitive agent against the activity of .alpha.-amylase or, more particularly, to an inhibitive agent against the activity of .alpha.-amylase with high specificity in the reaction with .alpha.-amylase which is responsible for providing a therapaeutic effect for diabetes.<br>
The US Patent No 5730988 issued in favor of Wommack discloses an invention wherein are provided the nutritional supplements for improving glucose metabolism.<br>
The invention 5730988 provides nutritional supplements and methods for administering nutritional supplements that improve glucose metabolism, particularly for persons with diabetes. A first nutritional supplement, or "Phase I" supplement, comprises a source of vanadate and a source of chromium. A second nutritional supplement, or "Phase II" supplement, comprises Gymnema sylvestre and lipoic acid. The nutritional supplements are alternated to prevent accumulation of the nutrients in the body and also to overcome desensitization that can occur over long periods of<br>
continuous use. While the nutritional supplements may be alternated at almost any frequency and taken over almost any duration, it is preferred that each Phase be taken for between about 2 and about 6 months, most preferably about 3 months or about 90 days, before alternating back to the other Phase.<br>
The US Patent No 5886029 issued in favor of Dhaliwal discloses a method and composition for treating diabetes.<br>
The invention in 5886029 discloses a medicinal composition is provided for treatment of diabetes in a human subject. The medicinal composition of the invention induces a significant reduction in serum glucose due to the regeneration of pancreatic islet cells. A medicinal composition according to the invention necessarily includes a pharmacologically significant quantity of (-)epicatechin augmented with a comparable amount of gymnemic acid. For best results smaller quantities of cinnamomum tamala, syzygium cumini, trigonella foenum graceum, azardichta indica, ficus racemosa, and tinospora cordifolia are also included in the composition. One to two grams of the medicinal composition of the invention are administered to a diabetic human subject three times a day before meals. The unique combination of components in the medicinal composition leads to a regeneration of the pancreas cells which then start producing insulin on their own. Since the composition restores normal pancreatic function, treatment can be discontinued after between about four and twelve months.<br>
The US Patent No 6042834 issued in favor of Baraka discloses a herbal composition and method for treatment of diabetes.<br>

Detailed description of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a herbal health formulation for treating diabetes and enhancing the body's immune system comprising ingestion of the said herbal formulation. The said herbal formulation is an assembled herbal composition derived from parts of specially selected plants and herbs.<br>
Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.<br>
The present invention provides a herbal health formulation for the treatment of diabetes, regulating fat metabolism and for use as an antiviral agent. The said herbal health formulation comprises extracts of Pterocarpos Marsupium; Powdered dry ginger; Glycyzrrhiza glabra leguminosae; Ocimum sanctum; Piper longum; Cinnamomum Plants; Elettaria Cardamomum and Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni.<br>
The present invention comprises a herbal composition comprising 80 percent by weight of Vijaysaar, 5 percent by weight of Liquorice root, 4 percent by weight of Powdered dry ginger, 4 percent by weight of Basil, 2.5 percent by weight of Long Pepper, 1 percent by weight of Cinnamon, 1 percent by weight of Cardamom, 1 percent by weight of Cloves, 1 percent by weight of Fennel Seed, .5 percent by weight of Stevia. Each of these components is more clearly defined below.<br>
Vijaysaar (Pterocarpos Marsupium) is commonly known as an Indian Kino Tree or a Malabar Kino. The principal constituents of Vijaysaar are Liquiritigemin and Isoliuritigen. Alchoholic and aqueous extracts of heartwood produce a significant reduction in blood sugar level (hypoglycemic) action by hindering the absorption of ghouls in the intestine. Vijaysaar has shown to regenerate beta cells of the islets langerhens of the pancreas which are functional in nature and it restores the normal insulin production of the pancreas and stabilizes the normal sugar level.<br>
Powdered dry ginger is made from Ginger (Zingiber officinalis). Ginger is grown throughout the tropical areas of the world. The most expensive and highest quality varieties generally come from Australia, South India, and Jamaica, while most mass market ginger is grown in China. Medical research has shown that ginger root is an effective treatment for nausea caused by motion sickness, morning sickness or other illness. Powdered dried ginger root is made into pills for medicinal use. Chinese women traditionally eat ginger root during pregnancy to combat morning sickness. Ginger ale and ginger beer have been recommended as "stomach settlers" for generations in countries where the beverages are made. Ginger water was commonly used to avoid heat cramps in the United States in the past. The characteristic odor and flavor of ginger root is caused by a mixture of shogaol and gingerols, volatile oils that<br>
compose about l%-3% by weight of fresh ginger. The gingerols have analgesic, sedative, antipyretic, antibacterial, and GI tract motility effects. Ginger reduces nausea.<br>
Liquorice root (Glycyzrrhiza glabra leguminosae, PapiHonaceae) is found in many countries and is known to give contentment and harmony. It is anti-inflammatory, anti-hepatotoxic, anti-spasmodic, demulcent, emetic, expectorant, laxative, rejuvenate, sedative and tonic. It is used to cure abdominal pain, bronchitis, cold, cough, debility, hyperacidity, inflammation, laryngitis, muscle spasms, sore throat, ulcers and painful urination. As an anti-hepatotoxic, Mulathi is effective in the treatment of chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis for which it is being widely used in Japan. Much of the liver oriented research has focused upon the triterperne glycyrrhizin. This inhibits hepatocyte injury caused by carbon tetrachloride, benzene hexachloride and PCB. Antibody production is enhanced by glycyrrhizin through the production of interleukin. Glycyrrhizin inhibits the growth of several DNA and RNA viruses, thereby inactivating herpes simplex virus particles irreversibly. It has a variety of uses in bronchial problems and coughs in general. Mulathi is used in allopathic medicine as a treatment for peptic ulceration, a similar use to its herbal use in gastritis and ulcers. It is also used for relief from abdominal colic. It nourishes the brain increasing cranial and cerebrospinal fluid and also improves complexion, hair and vision.<br>
Basil (Ocimum sanctum) is a herb used for remedying various common ailments including fever, cough, earache, snake and scorpion bite, viral hepatitis, abdominal colics etc. It also helps in lowering the blood sugar level.<br>
Long Pepper (Piper longum) is a herb which is indigenous to north eastern and southern India and SriLanka. It is used for enhancing digestion and for enhancing the assimilation and potency of herbs in a synergistic formula (this is called the Yogavahi effect). It is also used for purification.<br>
Cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Cinnamomum saigonicum, Cinnamomum aromaticum, Cinnamomum laurus, Lauraceae) is indigenous to India and SriLanka. It is Bark portion of the plant and has multiple uses<br>
including relief from Backaches, Bronchitis, Cold, Congestion, Diarrhea, Dysentery, Edema, Flu, Gas, Headaches, Hiccup, Indigestion, Liver problems, Menstrual pain, nausea, aches, toothache etc. It may be used as a powder or oil or by decoction or infusion.<br>
Cardamom (Elettaria Cardamomum) is native to Arabia and Syria but is also found in Indian market. Medicinally, the seeds are credited with stimulant, stomachic, alexipharmic and astringent properties and are used in treatment of leucorrhoea, indigestion, vomiting, abdominal pains, teeth disorders, urinary infections, tonsillitis and rectal diseases.<br>
Stevia (Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni) is a shrub belonging to the Asteraceae (sunflower) family of plants. It is widely used as a sweetener in Japan, and is available in the US and Canada as a health food supplement. Originating in South America, it is found in the wild in semi-arid habitats ranging from grassland to mountain terrain. It is used for treating obesity, high blood pressure, and heartburn. It has recently seen greater attention with the rise in demand for low-carb, low-sugar food alternatives.<br>
Fennel Seed {Foeniculum vulgare) is a plant of the Apiaceae or parsley family, which produces edible seeds and leaves. The variety Florence fennel (F. vulgare azoricum) has inflated leaf bases which form a sort of bulb. It comes mainly from India and Egypt and it has an anise-like flavor, but is more aromatic and sweeter. Its flavor comes from anethole, an aromatic compound that also flavors anise and star anise. It is used to cure digestive disorders, asthma, cataract and lice.<br>
Cloves (Eugenia caryophyllata ) are the aromatic dried flower buds of a tree (Syzygium aromaticum, sometimes included in the genus Eugenia) in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to Indonesia, used as a spice in virtually all the world's cuisine. The name derives from French clou, a nail, as the buds vaguely resemble small irregular nails in shape. Cloves are harvested primarily in Indonesia and Madagascar; it is also grown in Zanzibar, India, Sri Lanka, and the "Spice Islands" (Moluccas, Indonesia known as the Bandas Islands). Essential oil of clove has anesthetic and antimicrobial qualities, and is sometimes used to eliminate bad breath or to ameliorate the pain of a bad tooth. It, or its main component eugenol, is used by dentists to<br>
anesthetize the gum before injecting Novocaine or similar anesthetics, and is the characteristic odor of a dentist's office.<br>
Herbs are much more effective when used in proper combination with each other and have different effects according to mixture and dosage. The present invention uses various herbs in appropriate quantity to form a perfect herbal health composition for treating diabetes, regulating fat metabolism and to act as an antiviral agent.<br>
The herbal composition may be administered in form of a Powder mixed with water, milk, tea or other liquids to obtain a Natural Herbal Drink or in capsule form.<br>
The method of manufacturing the said herbal health formulation comprises the steps of:<br>
a)	Collection of best quality herbs from fields, forests or retailers;<br>
b)	Drying of the collected herbs under controlled temperature by using driers or natural drying under shade;<br>
c)	Grinding the dried herbs in grinders to obtain fine powder;<br>
d)	Sieving the powder through sieves of different meshes;<br>
e)	Mixing the sieved fine powder in big blendes;<br>
f)	Packaging the finished product in non-encapsulated powder form or in form of a capsule.<br>
