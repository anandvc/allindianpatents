CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention is an application for claiming the<br>
right of priority on the basis of the Japanese Patent Application<br>
No. 2007-104970 (filed on April 12, 2007).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1	Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]<br>
The present invention relates to a brake cylinder device<br>
provided with a push rod for actuating a brake mechanism for<br>
vehicles and capable of automatically adjusting the projected<br>
length of the push rod from a cylinder main body at braking<br>
operation, and a brake caliper device provided with the brake<br>
cylinder device.<br>
2	Description of Related Art<br>
[0003]<br>
As for a brake cylinder device capable of automatically<br>
adjusting the projected length of a push rod from a cylinder<br>
main body, Patent Document 1 (Japanese Published Examined Patent<br><br>
Application No. H6-67725 (claim 1, Fig. 2), has disclosed a<br>
constitution, which is provided with an output piston having<br>
inside a cylinder a push rod connected to a brake shoe for braking<br>
a wheel tread and a friction ring assembly made so as to increase<br>
a friction/sliding resistance.to the inner surface of a cylinder<br>
by holding one elastic ring between two circular plates to expand<br>
radially and outwardly.  Patent Document 1 has described that<br>
when the brake shoe wears while the brakes are in operation,<br>
an output piston and a friction ring assembly move according<br>
to an amount of water, whereas the friction ring assembly will<br>
not move due to a greater sliding resistance when the brakes<br>
are loosened, as a result, there is secured a proper clearance<br>
between the brake shoe and the wheel tread.  Then, Patent<br>
Document 1 has also described a constitution in which a nut<br>
is used to attach a stepped shaft to the center of the friction<br>
ring assembly, an end plate is fixed on one end surface of the<br>
output piston by using fitting screws, and a release spring<br>
is placed between a. flange formed at one end of the stepped<br>
shaft and the end plate. It has also described that a relative<br>
momentum between the output piston and the friction ring assembly<br>
is restricted so as not to exceed a predetermined clearance.<br>
[0004]<br>
Further, as a brake mechanism for railway vehicles, Patent<br><br>
Document 2 (Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application<br>
No. S63-125834) has disclosed a constitution of a brake cylinder<br>
device having both a normal brake means used in a normal operation<br>
and actuated by pressure air as well as a spring brake means<br>
used in a prolonged parking and actuated by spring force even<br>
in the absence of pressure air.<br>
[0005]<br>
Regarding a brake cylinder device having both the normal<br>
brake means and the spring brake means such as that disclosed<br>
in Patent Document 2, such an idea has been proposed that, as<br>
shown as disclosed in Patent Document 1, there is provided a<br>
projected length adjusting means capable of adjusting<br>
automatically the projected length of a push rod from a cylinder<br>
main body when the brakes are in operation, thereby improving<br>
the convenience as a brake cylinder device.<br>
[0006]<br>
However, Patent Document 1 has disclosed only an<br>
embodiment having a friction ring assembly as the<br>
above-described projected length adjust ing means and disclosed<br>
only a special constitution having a stepped shaft or the like<br>
corresponding to a projected length adjusting means by using<br>
a friction ring assembly as means for regulating a relative<br>
momentum between a push rod-equipped output piston and the<br><br>
friction ring assembly. Therefore, if the projected length<br>
adjusting means disclosed in Patent Document 1 is incorporated<br>
into a brake cylinder device having both a normal brake means<br>
and a spring brake means, the brake cylinder device is<br>
complicated in mechanism and enlarged. As such, a brake<br>
cylinder device having a normal brake means and a spring brake<br>
means has a difficulty in realizing means for regulating a range<br>
where the projected length of a push rod is adjusted and a range<br>
where it is not adjusted in the projected length adjusting means<br>
by using the special constitution disclosed in Patent Document<br>
1.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the<br>
above-described situation, an object of which is to provide<br>
a brake cylinder device having a normal brake means, a spring<br>
brake means and means for adjusting the projected length of<br>
a push rod, capable of preventing the device from being<br>
complicated in mechanism or increased in size and also capable<br>
of realizing means for regulating a range where the projected<br>
length of the push rod is adjusted and a range where it is not<br>
adjusted by using a simple mechanism as well as a brake caliper<br><br>
device equipped with the brake cylinder device.<br>
[0008]<br>
The brake cylinder device according to the first invention<br>
for attaining the above object is a brake cylinder device used<br>
in a brake mechanism for vehicles, which is provided with a<br>
normal brake means having a first piston in which an urging<br>
force of a first spring acts reversely on the pressure from<br>
a first pressure chamber, wherein a pressurized fluid is fed<br>
to the first pressure chamber, thereby the.first piston moves<br>
relatively with respect to the cylinder main body against the<br>
urging force of the first spring andmoves in a braking direction,<br>
a push rod, which is movable together with the first piston,<br>
projected length adjusting means having a guide member, which<br>
is movable together with the push rod and attached to the push<br>
rod in such a manner that a predetermined resisting force is<br>
applied when the push rod makes a relative movement parallel<br>
with a direction in which the first piston moves, wherein<br>
adjusted is a projected length of the push rod from the cylinder<br>
main body at release of the brakes in a direction in which the<br>
first piston moves, and a spring brake means having a second<br>
piston in which an urging force of the second spring acts<br>
reversely on the pressure from the second pressure chamber and<br>
the push rod penetrates therethrough, wherein a state of feeding<br><br>
a pressurized fluid to the second pressure chamber is shifted<br>
to a state of discharging it, thereby the second piston is moved<br>
in the braking direction by the urging force of the second spring<br>
and the push rod is also urged via the normal brake means,<br>
wherein the projected length adjusting means is provided with<br>
a recess or a projection installed on the guide member and also<br>
a regulating means having an engaging portion to be engaged<br>
with the recess or the projection and placed between the second<br>
piston and the first spring, thus regulating a movable range<br>
of the guide member in a direction in which the first piston<br>
moves.<br>
[0009]<br>
According to the present invention, such a constitution<br>
is provided that the push rod, which moves together with the<br>
first piston of the normal brake means, penetrates through the<br>
second piston of the spring brake means and a predetermined<br>
resisting force acts between the push rod and the guide member<br>
of the projected length adjusting means. Therefore, a brake<br>
cylinder device having the normal brake means, the spring brake<br>
means and the projected length adjusting means can be made<br>
compact by preventing the device from being complicated in<br>
mechanism and enlarged. Then, the projected length adjusting<br>
means is provided with a simply-structured regulating means,<br><br>
which is placed between the second piston and the first spring<br>
and equipped with an engaging portion making an engagement with<br>
a recess or a projection installed on the guide member, thereby<br>
regulating a movable range of the guide member. Therefore,<br>
it is possible to regulate a range where the projected length<br>
of the push rod is adjusted and a range where it is not adjusted<br>
by using a simple structure.<br>
As a result, the present invention can provide a brake<br>
cylinder device having a normal brake means, a spring brake<br>
means and an adjusting means for the projected length of the<br>
push rod, which can prevent the device from being complicated<br>
in mechanism and enlarged and also realize means for regulating<br>
a range where the projected length of the push rod is adjusted<br>
and a range where it is not adjusted by using a simple<br>
constitution.<br>
[0010]<br>
The brake cylinder device according to the second<br>
invention is the brake cylinder device according to the first<br>
invention, in which the regulatingmeans also regulates amovable<br>
range of the guide member in the rotating direction around the<br>
central axis of the first piston by engagement of the engaging<br>
portion with the recess or the projection.<br>
[0011]<br><br>
According to the above constitution, the recess or the<br>
projection and the regulating means having an engaging portion<br>
to be engaged with the recess or the projection are used to<br>
function as a detent for the guide member as well.  It is,<br>
therefore, possible to realize not only the function of<br>
regulating a movable range in a direction in which the first<br>
piston of the guide member moves but also the function as a<br>
detent by using one regulating means, thus making the brake<br>
cylinder device simple in mechanism.<br>
[0012]<br>
The brake cylinder device according to the third invention<br>
is the brake cylinder device according to the first invention<br>
or the second invention, wherein the recess or the projection<br>
is installed at a plurality of places on the guide member, and<br>
the engaging portion is also installed at a plurality of places<br>
on the regulating means corresponding individually to each of<br>
the recesses or the projections.<br>
[0013]<br>
According to the present invention, a plurality of the<br>
corresponding recesses or projections and the engaging portions<br>
are installed, by which loads acting on mutually engaging parts<br>
can be dispersed to reduce wear, which occurs at the recesses<br>
or projections and the engaging portions .  Therefore, the brake<br><br>
cylinder device is improved in durability.<br>
[0014]<br>
The brake cylinder device according to the fourth<br>
invention is the brake cylinder device according to any one<br>
of the first invention to the third invention, wherein the<br>
regulating means is installed as a partition for separating<br>
a region where the.normal brake means is placed from a region<br>
where the spring brake means is placed inside the cylinder main<br>
body, an opening portion through which the guide member<br>
penetrates is formed at the center of the partition, the engaging<br>
portion is installed at an edge forming the opening portion,<br>
the opening portion is formed in such dimensions that allows<br>
a clearance covering the entire circumference to exist between<br>
an outer diameter of the guide member and an edge of the opening<br>
portion so that the guide member can penetrate through the<br>
opening portion without making an engagement of the recess or<br>
the projection with the engaging portion at assembly of the<br>
brake cylinder device.<br>
[0015]<br>
According to the present, invention, the regulating means<br>
is installed as a partition for separating a region of the normal<br>
brake means from that of the spring brake means, thus making<br>
it possible to form the regulating means in a thin flat-plate<br><br>
shape and also simplify the constitution. Thus, the simply<br>
constituted regulating means can be placed so as to attain an<br>
effective use of space in a brake cylinder device. Then, at<br>
assembly of the brake cylinder device, a guide member can<br>
penetrate through an opening portion of the partition via a<br>
predetermined clearance without engagement of the recess or<br>
the projection with the engaging portion. Therefore, the<br>
assembly can be conducted easily and with an increased<br>
efficiency.<br>
[0016]<br>
The brake cylinder device according to the fifth invention<br>
is the brake cylinder device according to any one of the first<br>
invention to the fourth invention, wherein the partition and<br>
the guide member are placed in such a manner that a radial center<br>
position of the guide member is eccentric to that of the opening<br>
portion.<br>
[0017]<br>
According to the present invention, the center of the<br>
guide member is made eccentric to the center of the opening<br>
portion, thus making it possible to provide In a simple manner<br>
such a constitution that a guide member can penetrate through<br>
an opening portion of the partition via a predetermined clearance<br>
without engagement of the recess or the projection with the<br><br><br>
engaging portion at assembly of the brake cylinder device.<br>

rod moves and an elastic member placed between the push rod<br>
and the guide member, the elastic member is deformed and engaged<br>
with the uneven surface, by which the guide member is connected<br>
with the push rod, and when a force greater than a predetermined<br>
value is applied to the guide member, the elastic member is<br>
deformed to ride over a proj ection of the uneven surf ace, thereby<br>
the push rod is displaced with respect to the guide member.<br>
[0019]<br>
Conventionally, according to the constitution described<br>
in Patent Document 1, for example, only a frictional force<br>
between the inner circumferential surface of a flat cylinder<br>
and the surface of an elastic ring is used to generate a sliding<br>
resistance, thereby the sliding resistance of the friction ring<br>
assembly is easily made unstable by the surface condition and<br>
wear of the inner circumferential surface of the cylinder or<br><br><br>
the wear of the surf ace of the elastic ring. Further, adjustment<br>
is made by using a adjusting screw, which may complicate the<br>
adjustment and control of the sliding resistance.<br>
However, according to the present invention, the elastic<br>
member is deformed and engaged (cut into), thus making it<br>
possible to stabilize a frictional force or a binding force<br>
between the push rod and the guide member. Thereby, it is<br>
possible to adjust and control the sliding resistance by a simple<br>
constitution.<br>

is made at least at a part of the outer surface of the shaft<br>
rod, which is screwed into the shaft hole.<br>
[0021]<br><br><br>
According to the present invention, since the push rod<br>
is attached by being screwed With the shaft rod moving together<br>
with the first piston, it is possible to provide such a<br>
constitution that a projected length portion of the push rod<br>
is absorbed by a screw movement made by the shaft rod with respect<br>
to the push rod. Therefore, it is possible to provide such<br>
constitutions so as to prevent a positional deviation of the<br>
first piston with respect to a cylinder main body also in a<br>
state that the projected length of the push rod is adjusted,<br>
thereby retaining the capacity of the first pressure chamber<br>
substantially at a constant level.<br>
[0022]<br>
The brake cylinder device according to the eighth<br>
invention is the brake cylinder device according to any one<br>
of the first invention to the seventh invention, wherein the<br>

the brake shoe, a snap pin inserted below the brake-shoe<br>
retaining portion to regulate the latch swung in a direction<br>
in which the brake shoe is unlocked from the latch, and a coupling<br>
chain for coupling the latch with the snap pin.<br>
[0033]<br>
According to the present invention, such a structure is<br>
provided that the brake shoe can be easily attached or detached<br>
by using a latch urged by a spring (for example, a flat spring)<br>
in a direction different from that in which the brake shoe is<br>
attached or detached. Then, it is possible to prevent the latch<br>
from being unlocked only by inserting the snap pin below the<br>
brake-shoe retaining portion.  In other words, in performing<br>
work of exchanging the brake shoe, the snap pin is removed,<br>
thereby allowing the latch to be unlocked, the latch is turned<br><br><br>
against the flat spring or the like, with a possible drop of<br>
the brake shoe taken into account, thus making it possible to<br>
securely remove the brake shoe. Then, even at attachment of<br>
a new brake shoe, the latch is locked by the flat spring or<br>
the like at a stage where the key portion of the brake shoe<br>
is allowed to slide on the key groove of the brake-shoe retaining<br>
portion and arrives at a predetermined position. Therefore,<br>
the new brake shoe can be easily attached. Further, the latch<br>
is coupled with the snap pin by using a coupling chain, thereby<br>
easily providing a constitution for preventing the removal or<br>
loss of the snap pin.<br>
As a result, a brake caliper device is provided, which<br>
is free of an inadvertent drop of the brake shoe, realizing<br>
work of exchanging the brake shoe easily so that support only<br>
by the brake shoe can be released at any time, and also eliminating<br>
the necessity for troublesome and skilled work in tightening<br>
bolts by using a bundling wire in attaching the brake shoe.<br>

caliper device having the brake cylinder device related to<br>
embodiments of the present invention will be explained by<br>

for railway vehicles. Constituents of each drawing are<br>
depicted at an accuracy corresponding to that used in a design<br>
drawing.<br>
[0035]<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of a brake caliper device<br>
1 for railway vehicles related to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, when viewed axially.  Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram<br><br><br>
of the brake caliper device 1 given in Fig. 1, when viewed from<br>
a brake cylinder device 2 parallel with a direction in which<br>
a vehicle advances. Fig. 3 is a schematic diagram of the brake<br>
caliper device 1 given in Fig. 1, when viewed from below. As<br>
shown in Fig. 1 to Fig. 3, the brake caliper device 1 of the<br>
present embodiment is a disc brake-type brake mechanism.<br>
[0036]<br>
The brake caliper device 1 shown in Fig. 1 to Fig. 3 is<br>
provided with a brake cylinder device 2, a caliper body 11<br>
equipped with the brake cylinder device 2 and attached so as<br>
to make a relative movement axially with respect to a vehicle<br>
truck 100, a pair of backplates (brake-shoe retaining portions)<br>
12, 12 for retaining respectively a pair of brake pads (brake<br>
shoes) 14, 14, a pair of brake-shoe attaching structures 13,<br>
13 for attaching respectively the brake pads 14, 14 to the pair<br>
of back plates 12, 12, a leg 18 placed below the back plate<br>
12, and a parallel guiding mechanism 23 placed below the caliper<br>
body 11.<br>
[0037]<br>
The brake caliper device 1 is designed to generate a braking<br>
force by holding a circular plate-like brake disc 15, which<br>
is a disc on the shaft rotating in association with rotating<br>
wheels of a railway vehicle (not illustrated) , between the pair<br><br><br>
of brake pads 14, 1.4 attached to the caliper body 11 via the<br>
back plate 12, upon actuation of the brake cylinder device 2.<br>
In other words, the brake disc 15 is formed in a circular plate<br>
shape having front/back braking surfaces 15a, 15a formed so<br>
as to be orthogonal to the rotational shaft, the brake cylinder<br>
device 2 is actuated, by which the brake pads 14, 14 are pressed<br>
so as to hold the brake disc 15 between both sides thereof with<br>
respect to the braking surfaces 15a, 15a from a direction<br>
substantially parallel with a direction of the rotating shaft<br>
of the brake disc 15 (a direction perpendicular to the space<br>
in Fig. 1). .<br>
[0038]<br>
As shown in Fig. 1 to Fig. 3, the caliper body 11 is provided<br>
with a binding member 16 and a pair of brake levers 17, 17.<br>
The binding member 16 is attached to a bracket 100a fixed on<br>
the bottom of a truck via a swinging pin 16a so as to swing<br>
around the shaft parallel with a direction in which a vehicle<br>
advances. Then, a pair of brake levers 17, 17 are mounted so<br>
as to swing via a pair of fulcrum pins 17a approximately<br>
symmetrical to the binding member 16. The fulcrum pin 17a is<br>
mounted so as to extend toward a perpendicular direction, when<br>
viewed from the top, with respect to an axial direction of the<br>
swinging pin 16a.<br><br><br>
[0039]<br>
The pair of brake levers 17, 17 are constituted so that<br>
one end thereof is provided with a brake cylinder device 2 via<br>
a cylinder support pin 12a and driven by the brake cylinder<br>
device 2 . Then, the pair of brake levers 17, 17 are respectively<br>
provided with a pair of back plates 12, 12 for retaining the<br>
brake pad 14 on the other end via the fulcrum pin 17a with respect<br>
to one end to which the brake cylinder device 2 is attached.<br>
The back plate 12 is attached, to the brake lever 17 so as to<br>
swing via the support pin 12a extending parallel with the fulcrum<br>
pin 17a.  Further, a leg 18 installed so as to project in a<br>
rectangular solid shape is providedbelow each of the backplates<br>
12.  The leg 18 is designed for the projected length so as to<br>
correspond in dimensions to the lower end of the cylinder support<br>
pin 17b, with consideration given in such a manner that the<br>
end of the leg 18 and the lower end of the cylinder support<br>
pin 17b are arranged on a plane, which is substantially parallel.<br>
Therefore, when the brake caliper device 1 is removed from a<br>
truck 100 and placed on a horizontal floor or the like in<br>
performing maintenance work or the like, the end of the leg<br>
18 and the lower end of the cylinder support pin 17b are placed<br>
on the ground, thus making it possible to mount horizontally<br>
the brake caliper device 1.<br><br><br>
[0040]<br>
Fig. 4 is a perspective view of the brake pad 14, an'd<br>
Fig. 5 covers a plan view of the brake pad 14 (Fig. 5 (a) ) and<br>
a sectional view indicated by the arrow A to A thereof (Fig.<br>
5 (b) ) . As shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, the brake pad 14 is formed<br>
so as to substantially run along a part of the circular arc<br>
of the brake disc 15, and a key portion 14a is formed on the<br>
side opposite to a surface in contact with the brake disc 15.<br>
Then, as clearly shown in Fig. 5, the back plate 12 is provided<br>
with a key groove 12b formed in a shape substantially in agreement<br>
with an outer shape of the key portion 14a in such a manner<br>
that the key portion 14a of the key pad 14 to be attached or<br>
detached runs along downward in a perpendicular direction.<br>
Thereby, a brake pad 14 is attached to the back plate 12 in<br>
such a manner that the key portion 14a is fitted into the key<br>
groove 12b, while sliding thereon.<br>
[0041]<br>
As clearly shown in Fig. land Fig. 3, abrake-shoe attaching<br>
structure 13, which is to attach to the back plate 12 the brake<br>
pad 14 kept in a state that the key portion 14a is fitted into<br>
the key groove 12b, is installed below the back plate 12. The<br>
brake-shoe attaching structure 13 is provided with a latch 19,<br>
a snap pin 20, a coupling chain 21 and others.<br><br><br>
[0042]<br>
The latch 19 is a narrow flat plate-like member arranged<br>
on a surface perpendicular to the brake disc 15 and supported<br>
pivotally so that one end thereof can swing below the back plate<br>
12 via a pin (not illustrated) . Further, as clearly shown in<br>
Fig. 3, a projected portion 19a shaped so as to be substantially<br>
fitted into the key groove 12b is formed on the side facing<br>
to the brake pad 14 of the latch 19, and the projected portion<br>
19a is in contact with the lower end surface of the key portion<br>
14a, thereby preventing the brake pad 14 from falling down.<br>
Then, the end 19b on the other end of the latch 19 is pulled<br>
outwardly (in a direction opposite to the brake disc 15), by<br>
which the projected portion 19a of the latch 19 is unlocked<br>
from the key portion 14a of. the brake pad 14. Further, the<br>
latch 19 is urged axially by a flat spring 22 supported on the<br>
leg 18 in a cantilever manner on the same side as that supported<br>
pivotally so as to swing, thereby locking in the key portion<br>
14a to support the brake pad 14.<br>
[0043]<br>
As clearly shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3, the snap pin 20<br>
is formed by procedures in which one piece of a rigid wire rod<br>
is bent in a coil shape approximately one and half times to<br>
form a spring portion 20a, and only one end of the spring portion<br><br><br>
20a is thereafter bent in a wave shape to form a curved portion<br>
20b. Further, a linear portion 20c is installed on the other<br>
end in which the curved portion 20b of the snap pin 20 is not<br>
formed. The linear portion 20c is inserted into a pin hole<br>
made below the back plate 12, and the snap pin 20 is inserted<br>
into the back plate 12 so that the curved portion 20b is also<br>
fitted into a groove portion provided below the back plate 12.<br>
With such a constitution, when the snap pin 20 is inserted into<br>
the back plate 12 in a state that the latch 19 is locked with<br>
the brake pad 14, the latch 19 is to be positioned so as to<br>
be held between the curved portion 20b and the linear portion<br>
20c. Thereby, the snap pin 20 is inserted below the back plate<br>
12, thus regulating the latch swung in a direction in which<br>
the brake pad 14 is unlocked from the latch 19, and preventing<br>
the brake pad 14 from being unlocked from the latch 19.<br>
[0044]<br>
The snap pin 20 is attached to the latch 19 by a coupling<br>
chain 21 installed so as to couple the snap pin 20 with the<br>
latch 19. That is, one end of the coupling chain 21 is fixed,<br>
for example, by being bound to one site of the latch 19, whereas .<br>
the other end thereof is attached to the spring portion 20a<br>
of the snap pin 20. The snap pin 20 is required to be removed<br>
at every exchange of the brake pad 14.  Further, the snap pin,<br><br><br>
which is small and easily lost, can be easily made<br>
loss-preventive when having a coupling chain 21. The coupling<br>
chain 21 is a flexible continuous body and may include any type<br>
of thread as long as they are not likely to break after prolonged<br>
use, for example, wire and resin threads ##wire?##.<br>
[0045]<br>
As clearly shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3, the parallel guiding<br>
mechanism 23 is provided with a pair of guide members 24a, 24b<br>
and a pair of guide rods 25a, 25b. The guide members 24a, 24b<br>
are respectively provided with a U-shaped curved portion, with<br>
one end thereof fixed to the back plate 12. Then, one end of<br>
the guide rod 25a is fixed to the other end of the guide member<br>
24a, whereas the. other end of the guide rod 25a is fitted into<br>
a through-hole formed on the other end of the guide member 24b<br>
in a loosely fitted state.  In a similar manner, one end of<br>
the guide rod 25b is fixed to the other end of the guide member<br>
24b, whereas the other end of the guide rod 25b is fitted into<br>
a through-hole formed on the other end of the guide member 24a<br>
in a loosely fitted state.  Further, the guide rod 25a and the<br>
guide rod 25b are arranged parallel with each other.  When the<br>
brake cylinder device 2 is actuated by a parallel guiding<br>
mechanism 23 composed of the pair of guide members 24a, 24b<br>
and the guide rods 25a, 25b and the brake lever 17 is swung<br><br><br>
to move in a direction in which a pair of brake pads 14, 14<br>
come closer together with the back plate 12 (a direction in<br>
contact with the brake disc 15), the pair of brake pads 14,<br>
14 are guided so as to conduct approximately symmetrical motions,<br>
with the brake disc 15 held therebetween.<br>
[0046]<br>
In the above-described brake caliper device 1, as will<br>
be described later, the cylinder main body 26 of the brake<br>
cylinder device 2 is attached to one end of the brake lever<br>
17, whereas the push rod 28 is attached to the other end of<br>
the brake lever 17, and the brake cylinder device 2 is operated<br>
to project or retract the push rod 28. Thereby, the vicinity<br>
of the cylinder support pin 17b for a pair of brake levers 17,<br>
17 is driven so as to space away from or come closer to each<br>
other.  Therefore, the pair of brake levers 17, 17 act on the<br>
basis of the fulcrum pin 17a in such a manner so as to hold<br>
the brake disc 15 between the brake pads 14.  At this time,<br>
in the pair of brake levers 17, 17, the brake pad 14 installed<br>
on one end of the brake lever 17 is in contact with the braking<br>
surface 15a of the brake disc 15 earlier.  Then, the other brake<br>
lever 17 utilizes a reaction force received from the brake pad<br>
14 in contact with the braking surface 15a, thereby pressing<br>
the brake pad 14 on the braking surface 15a of the brake disc<br><br><br>
15. Therefore, the brake disc 15 is held between the pair of<br>
brake pads 14, 14, and a frictional force generated between<br>
the brake pads 14, 14 and the braking surfaces 15a, 15a is used<br>
to brake the rotation of the brake disc 15 and also the rotation<br>
of wheels of a railway vehicle installed coaxially with the<br>
brake disc 15.<br>
[0047]<br>
Next, an explanation will be made in detail for a brake<br>
cylinder device 2 of the present invention. The both ends of<br>
the brake cylinder device 2 are respectively coupled with<br>
cylinder support pins 17b in the braking direction. Then, as<br>
shown in Fig. 6, which is a sectional view of the brake cylinder<br>
device 2, the brake cylinder device 2 is provided with a cylinder<br>
main body 2 6, a normal brake means 27, a push rod 28, a spring<br>
brake means 29, a proj ected length adjusting means 30 and others .<br>
[0048]<br>
The cylinder main body 26 is constituted with a first<br>
casing portion 31 and a second casing portion 32 to form an<br>
inner space 26a. Constitutions such as the normal brake means<br>
27, the push rod 28, the spring brake means 29, and the projected<br>
length adjusting means are arranged in such a manner that some<br>
or all of them can be accommodated in the inner space 2 6a.<br>
Further, the first casing portion 31 is provided with a bottom<br><br><br>
and formed approximately in a cup shape (cylindrical shape),<br>
and the second casing portion 32 is fixed by using a bolt 33<br>
so as to close an opened side of the first casing portion 31.<br>
Thereby, the inner space 26a is formed. Further, the end of<br>
the first casing portion 31 is coupled with the brake lever<br>
17 by the cylinder support pin 17b.<br>
[0049]<br>
The normal brake means 27 is primarily constituted with<br>
a first spring 34, a first pressure chamber 35, and a first<br>
piston 36. The first piston 36 is arranged so as to separate,<br>
the inner space 26a, fitted hermetically into the inner<br>
circumferential surface of the first casing portion 31 and also<br>
arranged so as to slide axially on the first casing portion<br>
31. The first pressure chamber 35 is constituted with spaces<br>
partitioned by the first piston 36 and the first casing portion<br>
31. A cup packing 38 is adhered on the first piston 36 in order<br>
to improve the hermetic state of the first pressure chamber<br>
35. Then, the cylinder main body 26 is provided with a first<br>
pressurized fluid channel 37 communicated to the first pressure<br>
chamber 35, and compressed air as a pressurized fluid, which<br>
is a working fluid, is fed via the first pressurized fluid channel<br>
37 to the first pressure chamber 35. In addition, a first<br>
feed/discharge port 37a, which is opened from the first<br><br><br>
pressurized fluid channel 37 to the outside of the cylinder<br>
main body 26 and to which the compressed air is fed and discharged,<br>
is arranged so as to position below a swinging pin 16a (refer<br>
to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2) in a perpendicular direction.<br>
[0050]<br>
Further, the first spring 34 is arranged on the inner<br>
space 26a opposite to the first pressure chamber 35 via the<br>
first piston 36 and placed so as to urge the first piston 36<br>
toward the first pressure chamber 35. According to the above<br>
constitution, an urging force of the first spring 34 and the<br>
pressure from the first pressure chamber 35 act on the first<br>
piston 36 reversely, compressed air is fed to the first pressure<br>
chamber 35, by which the first piston 36 makes a relative movement<br>
with respect to the cylinder main body 26 against the urging<br>
force of the first spring 34, and the normal brake means 27<br>
moves in the braking direction (a direction indicated by the<br>
arrow A in Fig. 6).<br>
[0051]<br>
The push rod 28 is formed in a cylindrical shape having<br>
a shaft hole extending parallel with a direction in which the<br>
first piston 36 moves, and a female thread 39 is made in the<br>
vicinity of the end of the first pressure chamber 35 on the<br>
inner circumferential surface of the shaft hole.  Further, the<br><br><br>
push rod 28 is provided on the outer circumferential surface<br>
with an uneven surface 4 0 f ormedby repeatedly arranging recesses<br>
and projections in a direction in which the push rod 28 moves.<br>
In addition, a difference in height of the recesses and<br>
projections on the uneven surface 40 is, for example, about<br>
0.3 mm. The uneven surface 40 is a part of the constitution<br>
forming the projected length adjusting means 30.  Further, the<br>
cylinder support pin 17b of the brake lever 17 is coupled with<br>
the leading end of the push rod 28 via a coupling member 41,<br>
thus making it possible to transmit a driving force of the brake<br>
cylinder device 2 to the brake lever 17 of the caliper body<br>
11.  In addition, the coupling member 41 is fixed to the push<br>
rod 28 by using a pin or the like in order to prevent a relative<br>
axial rotation.   Further,  there is mounted a flexible<br>
bellows-like cover 46 for dust prevention between the push rod<br>
28 and the second casing portion 32 in such a manner so as to<br>
cover an opening portion formed on the end opposite to first<br>
casing portion 31 of the second casing portion 32 .  In addition,<br>
the push rod 28 is installed so as to move together with the<br>
first piston 36 via the projected length adjusting means 30,<br>
which will be described later.<br>
[0052]<br>
The spring brake means 29 is primarily constituted with<br><br><br>
a second spring 42, a second pressure chamber 43 and a second<br>
piston 44.  The second piston 44 is constituted with a<br>
cylindrical portion 44a formed as a cylindrical body,<br>
flange-like portions 44b, 44c installed so as to project<br>
outwardly respectively on both ends of the cylindrical portion<br>
44a, a cylindrical member 44d placed inside the cylindrical<br>
portion 44a and others, with the push rod 28 arranged so as<br>
to penetrate through the cylindrical portion 4 4a .  In addition,<br>
the flange-like portion 44b is constituted with a plurality<br>
of members and arranged at the leading end of the push rod 28,<br>
whereas the flange-like portion 44c is usually arranged on the<br>
first piston 36 .  The cylindrical member 44d is integrated with<br>
the cylindrical portion 44a and the flange-like portions 44b,<br>
44c by a fixing ring 67 to be described later.  Further, the<br>
second casing portion 32 is provided with a spring seat 32a,<br>
which is projected inwardly along the inner circumference<br>
thereof like a brim to constitute a base of the second spring<br>
42. Then, the inner circumferential end of the spring seat<br>
32a contacts slidingly with the outer circumference of the<br>
cylindrical portion 44a of the second piston 44 in a hermetic<br>
manner, and the second piston 44 is arranged so as to slide<br>
axially on the second casing portion 32.<br>
[0053]<br><br><br>
The second pressure chamber 43 is constituted with spaces<br>
partitioned by the outer circumference of the cylindrical<br>
portion 44a of the second piston 44, the inner circumferences<br>
of the flange-like portion 44c and the second casing portion<br>
32, and the spring seat 32. Then, the second casing portion<br>
32 ig provided with a second pressurized fluid channel 45<br>
communicated to the second pressure chamber 43, and compressed<br>
air (a pressurized fluid) is fed via the second pressurized<br>
fluid channel 45 into the second pressure chamber 43. In<br>
addition, a second feed/discharge port 45a, which is opened<br>
from the second pressurized fluid channel 45 to the outside<br>
of the cylinder main body 26 and through which compressed air<br>
is fed and discharged, is arranged so as to position below a<br>
swinging pin 16a (refer to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2) in a perpendicular<br>
direction.<br>
[0054]<br>
Further, the second spring 42 is installed as a coil spring<br>
arranged around the cylindrical portion 44a of the second piston<br>
44 and arranged between the spring seat 32a and the flange-like<br>
portion 44b. As described above, the second spring 42 is placed<br>
so as to urge the flange-like portion 44b against the spring<br>
seat 32a (specifically, urging the second piston 44 against<br>
the cylinder main body 26) in the braking direction (direction<br><br><br>
indicated by the arrow A in the drawing) . Therefore, an urging<br>
force of the second spring 42 and the pressure from the second<br>
pressure chamber 43 act reversely on the second piston, and<br>
the spring brake means 29 changes from a state that compressed<br>
air is fed to the second pressure chamber 43 to a state that<br>
it is discharged, thereby the second piston 44 is moved in the<br>
braking direction by the urging force of the second spring 42.<br>
In addition, the spring brake means 29 is to urge the push rod<br>
28 via the normal brake means 27 when movement of the second<br>
piston 44 in the braking direction occurs, as will be described<br>
later.<br>
[0055]<br>
The projected length adjusting means 30 is constituted<br>
with an outer cylinder member 47, a shaft rod 48, a guide member<br>
49, the above-described uneven surface 40, an O-ring (elastic<br>
member) 50, a recess 51, a partition (regulating means) 52,<br>
and others.  The projected length adjusting means 30 is<br>
installed as a mechanism for adjusting at braking operation<br>
a projected length of the push rod 28 from cylinder main body<br>
26 at the time of releasing the brakes in a direction in which<br>
the first piston 36 moves.<br>
[0056]<br>
The outer cylinder member 47 is formed in a cylindrical<br><br><br>
shape, the base end of which is fixed to the first piston 36<br>
via a flange plate 53 and a bolt 54, and constituted so as to<br>
move together with the first piston 36. A head flange 55 is<br>
accommodated into the base end of the outer cylinder member<br>
47. A tapered narrowed portion 56 is formed on the inner<br>
circumferential surface at the axial end of the outer cylinder<br>
member 47 . The narrowed portion 56 can be used to press a radial<br>
outer edge of the head flange 55 to the leading end (the side<br>
in which the push rod 28 advances) . Further, a press pin 57<br>
is installed on the outer cylinder member 4 7 so as to project<br>
inwardly, and the leading end of the press pin 57 can be used<br>
to press the head flange 55 to the base end (the side in which<br>
the push rod 28 retracts).<br>
[0057]<br>
Further, the outer cylinder member 47 is placed between<br>
a guide member 4 9 arranged around the push rod 28 and the second<br>
piston 44, inside which the guide member 4 9 is arranged. Then,<br>
the outer cylinder member 4 7 is provided with a stopper ring<br>
58 attached to an outer circumference of the leading end thereof,<br>
and an inner circumferential portion at the leading end of the<br>
cylindrical member 44d of the second piston 44 is locked with<br>
the outer cylinder member 47 via the stopper ring 58. Thereby,<br>
when the spring brake means. 29 is actuated after a temporary<br><br><br>
actuation of the normal brake means 27, the second piston 44<br>
is locked with the outer cylinder member 47 via the stopper<br>
ring 58 when movement of the second piston 4 4 to the braking<br>
direction occurs, thus urging the push rod 28 via the outer<br>
cylinder member 47 and the first piston 36 of the normal brake<br>
means 27.<br>
[0058]<br>
The shaft rod 48 is provided on the outer circumferential<br>
surface with a male thread 59 made threaded and mounted in a<br>
state of being screwed with a female thread 39 made threaded<br>
in the vicinity of the end of the first pressure chamber 35<br>
on the inner circumferential surface of the push rod 28. The<br>
shaft rod 48 is screwed into the shaft hole of the push rod<br>
28, by which the push rod 28 is attached to the shaft rod 48.<br>
Further, the. base end located on the first pressure chamber<br>
35 in the shaft rod 48 is fixed to a head flange 55, and the<br>
shaft rod 48 is constituted so as to move together with the<br>
first piston 36.<br>
[0059]<br>
The guide member 4 9 is formed in a cylindrical shape and<br>
supported outside the shaft rod 48 so as to rotate freely via<br>
a thrust bearing (bearing) 60. Further, an urging spring 63<br>
is laid between the guide member 4 9 and the head flange 55.<br><br><br>
Then, the guide member 49 is provided with a stepped shaft hole<br>
for inserting the push rod 28 thereinto, and an O-ring<br>
accommodating space 49a, which is a space for opening the uneven<br>
surface 40 and in which an O-ring 50 is arranged, is formed<br>
at a site of the shaft hole formed in a major diameter. In<br>
other words, the O-ring accommodating space 4 9a is formed at<br>
a site between the bottom of the major diameter (stepped portion)<br>
4 9b on the guide member 4 9 and a stopper ring 61 fitted into<br>
the opening end of the major diameter, with the inner side (the<br>
side facing to the uneven surface 40 of the push rod 28) being<br>
opened.<br>
[0060]<br>
The O-ring 50 is arranged at the O-ring accommodating<br>
space 49 between the push rod 28 and the guide member 49. Then,<br>
aplurality (four) of O-rings 50 are arranged side by side axially<br>
at the O-ring accommodating space 49a, and a back-up ring 62<br>
is arranged at both ends of each of the O-rings 50 (between<br>
adjacent O-rings 50) . Further, the bottom 49b and the stopper<br>
ring 61 are positioned in relation to the width of the O-ring<br>
50 in such a manner that the O-ring 50 undergoes an elastic<br>
deformation as it is crushed to some extent between the bottom<br>
49b of the major diameter on the guide member 49 and the stopper<br>
ring 61. Thereby, the O-ring 50 is deformed so as to expand<br><br><br>
to the inner circumference and engaged with the uneven surface<br>
40 on the outer circumferential surface of the push rod 28,<br>
by which the guide member 49 is coupled with the push rod 28.<br>
As described above, the guide member 4 9 can move together with<br>
the push rod 28 and is attached to the push rod 28 in such a<br>
manner that a predetermined resisting force is applied when<br>
the push rod 28 makes a relative movement parallel with a<br>
direction in which the first piston 36 moves.  Then, when a<br>
force exceeding a predetermined level is applied to the guide<br>
member 49, the 0-ring 50 is deformed to ride over a projection<br>
of the uneven surface 40, by which the push rod 28 is displaced<br>
with respect to the guide member 49.  In addition, in the present<br>
embodiment, an 0-ring having a diameter of approximately 5 mm<br>
and a substantially circular cross section is used as the elastic<br>
member due to the fact that it is easily available and relatively<br>
high in dimensional accuracy.  However, an elastic member<br>
mainly made with rubber or the like and having an oval or a<br>
rectangular cross section may be used.<br>
[0061]<br>
Fig. 7 shows the partition 52, the outer cylinder member<br>
4 7 and the guide member 4 9 when viewed in a direction indicated<br>
by the arrow B to B in Fig. 6. The outer cylinder member 4 7<br>
and the guide member 49 are illustrated in cross section. As<br><br><br>
shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, the recess 51 is installed as a<br>
groove-like portion formed in a partially recessed manner on<br>
a circumference wall of the guide member 4 9 and extended short<br>
in circumferential and axial directions, and provided at a<br>
plurality (two) of sites on the guide member 49.<br>
[0062]<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, the partition<br>
52 is placed between the second piston 44 and the first spring<br>
34, and installed in such a manner so as to separate a region<br>
where the normal brake means 27 is placed from that where the<br>
spring brake means 29 is placed inside the cylinder main body<br>
26. Then, the partition 52 is provided with an engaging portion<br>
64, which is engaged with the recess 51 installed on the guide<br>
member 49. The engaging portion 64 is engaged with the recess<br>
51 in an axial direction of the guide member 49, thereby<br>
regulating a movable range (stroke) of the guide member 49 in<br>
a direction in which the first piston 36 moves.  Further, the<br>
engaging portion 64 is engaged with the recess 51 in a<br>
circumferential direction of the guide member 49, thereby also<br>
regulating a movable range of the guide member 4 9 in a rotational<br>
direction in which a direction of moving the first piston 36<br>
is given as a direction of the rotational shaft (to function<br>
as a detent) .  In addition, the engaging portion 64 is provided<br><br><br>
at a plurality of sites (two) on the partition 52 so as to<br>
correspond to each of the recesses 51. Further, an opening<br>
is provided at a site corresponding to the recess 51 on the<br>
outer cylinder member 47, and the engaging portion 64 is engaged<br>
with the recess 51 through the opening.<br>
[0063]<br>
Still further, the partition 52 is provided at the center<br>
with an opening portion 65, through which the guide member 49<br>
penetrates, and an engaging portion 64 is installed on the edge<br>
of the opening portion 65. The opening portion 65 is formed<br>
in such dimensions that a clearance covering all over the<br>
circumference is allowed to exist between an outer diameter<br>
of the guide member 49 (outer diameter perpendicular to an axial<br>
direction of the guide member 4 9) and the edge of the opening<br>
portion 65 so that the guide member 49 can penetrate through<br>
an opening portion 65 without engagement of the recess 51 with<br>
the engaging portion 64 at assembly of the brake cylinder device<br>
2. As clearly shown in Fig. 7, in the brake cylinder device<br>
2, the partition 52 and the guide member 4 9 are placed in such<br>
a manner that a radial center position of the guide member 49<br>
can be made eccentric to that of the opening portion 65 of the<br>
partition 52<br>
[0064]<br><br><br>
In addition, the spring brake means 29 is provided with<br>
a manual opening mechanism 66 for releasing manually a state<br>
that the brakes are in operation. The manual opening mechanism<br>
66 is constituted with a fixing ring 67, a closing member 68,<br>
a fixing rod 69, a return spring 70 and an operation ring 71.<br>
Fig. 8 is a sectional view showing the manual opening mechanism<br>
66 and a constituent arranged inside the fixing ring 67.  In<br>
addition, the cross section indicated by the arrow C in Fig.<br>
8 corresponds to the cross section given in Fig. 6.  In Fig.<br>
8, these constituents such as the fixing rod 69, the return<br>
spring 70 and the operation ring 71 are enlarged for illustration<br>
in larger dimensions than other constituents.<br>
[0065]<br>
As shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, the fixing ring 67 is formed<br>
as a C-type slit-equipped ring, and head portions 67a, 67a having<br>
a wedge-shaped outer surface are formed on both ends opposing<br>
each other via the slit. The fixing ring 67 is set and arranged<br>
at the flange-like portion 44b of the second piston 44.  Then,<br>
the fixing ring 67 is, as will be described later, urged by<br>
the closing member 68 and the fixing rod 69 to reduce in diameter,<br>
fitted into an annular groove 72 formed on the outer<br>
circumference of the cylindrical member 4 4d and engaged with<br>
the annular groove 72. With such a constitution, the fixing<br><br><br>
ring 67 is engaged with the annular groove 72, by which the<br>
cylindrical member 4 4d of the secondpiston 44 is fixedto another<br>
member of the secondpiston 44 and formed in an integrated manner.<br>
[0066]<br>
The closing member 68 is provided with an open U-shaped<br>
cross section and constituted as a member having two inclined<br>
surfaces in contact with wedge-shaped outer surfaces of the<br>
head portions 67a, 67a of the fixing ring 67 formed on the inside.<br>
The closing member 68 is guided along a predetermined groove<br>
at the second piston 44 and thereby placed so as to move to<br>
the fixing ring 67 in the radial direction.  Further, the fixing<br>
rod 69 is constituted as a shaft-like stepped member having<br>
a wedge-shaped taper surface 69a at the leading end and placed<br>
so as to move back and forth on the second piston 44.  Still<br>
further, the return spring 70 is installed as a coil spring<br>
placed around a minor diameter portion of the stepped fixing<br>
rod 69, and arranged between a stepped portion of the fixing<br>
rod. 69 and a spring washer 73. The return spring 70 is placed<br>
as described above, by which the fixing rod 69 is urged by the<br>
return spring 70, and the fixing rod 69 presses the closing<br>
member 68 toward the radial center of the fixing ring 67 in<br>
such a manner that the taper surface 69a on the leading end<br>
of the fixing rod 69 rides over outside the closing member 68.<br><br><br>
Therefore, the closing member 68 is pressed, by which the fixing<br>
ring 67 is kept reduced in diameter and the cylindrical member<br>
44d at the second piston 44 is in a state of being integrated<br>
into the second piston 44.<br>
[0067]<br>
Further, the operation ring 71 is attached to the end<br>
opposite to the tapered surface 69 of the fixing rod 69. The<br>
operation ring 71 is pulled toward a direction in which it moves<br>
away from the spring washer 73 against an urging force of the<br>
return spring 70, thereby giving a gradual release to a pressed<br>
state of the closing member 68 by the fixing rod 69 so as to<br>
ride over the closing member 68 .  In association with the release<br>
operation, the closing member 68 can move to the fixing ring<br>
67 radially outwardly, while slidingly in contact with the<br>
tapered surface 69a of the fixing rod 69.  Thereby, the fixing<br>
ring 67 is increased in diameter, and the closing member 68<br>
is urged to the fixing ring 67 radially outwardly by the<br>
wedge-shaped outer surfaces of head portions 67a, 67a of the<br>
fixing ring 67 to release an engagement state of the fixing<br>
ring 67 with the annular groove 72 . At release of the engagement<br>
of the fixing ring 67 with the annular groove 72, a cylindrical<br>
member 44d coupled with other members is decoupled at the second<br>
piston 44 (an integrated state is released), a part excluding<br><br>
the cylindrical member 44d at the second piston 44 is allowed<br>
tomove independently of the cylindrical member 44d. Therefore,<br>
the operation ring 71 is pulled in a state that the spring brake<br>
means 29 is in operation, thus making it possible to develop<br>
a state that the urging force of the second spring 42 is not<br>
applied to the push rod 28 via the second piston 44.  In other<br>
words, when the operation ring 71 is pulled, the push rod 28<br>
is allowed to move in a direction in which the brakes are released<br>
together with the cylindrical member 4 4d locked by the stopper<br>
ring 58, the outer cylinder member 47, the shaft rod 48 and<br>
the first piston 36, even if the second piston 44 is urged by<br>
the second spring 42 toward a braking direction.  It is,<br>
therefore, possible to release a state that the brakes are in<br>
operation.<br>
[0068]<br>
Still further, the brake cylinder device 2 is provided<br>
with a ventilation tube 72 communicating with the interior of<br>
the cylinder main body 26 with the exterior thereof. Fig. 9<br>
shows only half the cross section of the brake cylinder device<br>
2, which is divided at the center of the shaft. In addition,<br>
in Fig. 9, different cross sections are shown, which is divided<br>
by the dashed line D, a region indicated by the arrow Dl<br>
corresponds to the cross section given in Fig. 6 and a region<br><br><br>
indicated by the arrow D2 corresponds to a cross section<br>
different from that given in Fig. 6. Fig. 10 is an enlarged<br>
sectional view covering a ventilation tube 75 and the vicinity<br>
thereof.<br>
[0069]<br>
The ventilation tube 75 is formed as a rubber cylinder,<br>
which is a cylindrical elastic body with an elbow portion, and,<br>
as shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, communicating with the outside<br>
via a ventilation portion 76 with a spring chamber 74 (a region<br>
surrounded by an inner circumferential wall of the second casing<br>
portion 32, a spring seat 32a, a flange-like portion 44b of<br>
the second piston 44 and a cylindrical portion 44a) in which<br>
the second spring 42 of the spring brake means 29 is placed.<br>
Then, as shown in Fig. 10, the ventilation tube 75 is provided<br>
with a thread portion 75a formed as a male thread on the outer<br>
circumference at one end thereof.  The thread portion 75a is<br>
screwed with a female thread portion 77 formed at the second<br>
casing portion 32. In other words, the ventilation tube 75<br>
is screwed and attached to the cylinder main body 26 at the<br>
thread portion 75a and communicated with the interior of the<br>
cylinder main body 26.<br>
[0070]<br>
Further, a filter 78 shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 is attached<br><br><br>
inside the ventilation tube 75.  Fig. 11 covers a front<br>
elevational view (Fig. 11 (a)) and a side elevational view (Fig.<br>
11 (b)) showing only the filter 78. As shown in Fig. 11, the<br>
filter 7 8 is provided with a circular wire netting portion 7 8a<br>
and a frame portion 78b attached around the wire netting portion<br>
78a.  The wire netting portion 78a and the frame portion 78b<br>
are both formed as a steel-made rigid body. As shown in Fig.<br>
9 and Fig. 10, the filter 78 is arranged at a position<br>
corresponding to a part which is inside a ventilation tube 75<br>
and in which the thread portion 7 5a of the ventilation tube<br>
75 is formed.<br>
[0071]<br>
Next, an explanation will be made for operations of the<br>
brake cylinder device 2. Fig. 6 shows a state that the brakes<br>
are not in operation, and neither the normal brake means 27<br>
nor the spring brake means 29 is in operation. In a state that<br>
the brakes are not in operation as shown in Fig. 6, in order<br>
that the spring brake means 29 is not in operation, compressed<br>
air is fed from the second feed/discharge port 4 5 to the second<br>
pressure chamber 43, thereby the second piston 44 is kept urged<br>
against an urging force of the second spring 42 in an anti-braking<br>
direction, which is reverse in a direction indicated by the<br>
arrow A in the drawing (a direction reverse to the braking<br><br><br>
direction in which the brakes are released).<br>
[0072]<br>
When apredetermined valve (not illustrated) is controlled<br>
to feed compressed air to the first feed/discharge port 37a<br>
in a state that the brakes are not in operation as shown in<br>
Fig. 6, the first piston 36 is pressed toward a braking direction<br>
(a direction indicated by the arrow A in Fig. 6) against the<br>
first spring 34, and the outer cylinder member 47 fixed to the<br>
first piston 36 is also moved in the braking direction. Then,<br>
the narrowed portion 5 6 formed on the inner circumferential<br>
surface at the base end of the outer cylinder member 47 presses<br>
the outer edge of the head flange 55, by which the head flange<br>
55 is also moved in the braking direction and the push rod 28<br>
coupled with the shaft rod 48 is also moved in the direction<br>
given by the arrow A.  In addition, at this time, the head flange<br>
55 and the shaft rod 48, will not rotate but are simply pushed<br>
by the outer cylinder member 47. Therefore, the normal brake<br>
means 27 is actuated and the push rod 28 is pushed to advance<br>
in the braking direction (together with the outer cylinder member<br>
47 and the guide member 49) , thereby actuating the brake caliper<br>
device 1.<br>
[0073]<br>
As described above, where a braking force of the normal<br><br><br>
brake means 27 is applied to change a vehicle from a halt state<br>
to a parking state as it is, a predetermined valve (not<br>
illustrated) is controlled, with the above-described normal<br>
brake means 27 being in operation, and compressed air sealed<br>
at the second pressure chamber 43 is discharged from the second<br>
feed/discharge port 45a. Thereby, the second pressure chamber<br>
43, which acts against the urging force of the second spring<br>
42, is released and the second piston 44 is extended by the<br>
urging force of the second spring 42, thereby the cylindrical<br>
member 4 4d of the second piston 4 4 is brought into contact with<br>
a stopper ring 58 to keep a state that the second piston 44<br>
is locked with the outer cylinder member 47.  In this state,<br>
even when the normal brake means 27 is released or compressed<br>
air fed to the first pressure chamber 35 is discharged and the<br>
first piston 36 is moved by the first spring 34 in an anti-braking<br>
direction, the push rod 28 is urged by the spring brake means<br>
29 to keep a state that the braking force is applied.  In addition,<br>
when the spring brake means 2 9 is released manually, as described<br>
previously, an operation ring 71 of the manual opening mechanism<br>
66 is used to release the cylindrical member 44d fixed to the<br>
second piston 44.<br>
[0074]<br>
In a state that only the normal brake means 27 is actuated<br><br><br>
to develop a braking force, with the spring brake means 2 9 kept<br>
non-operating, a predetermined valve (not illustrated) is<br>
controlled to discharge compressed air, which has been fed to<br>
the first pressure chamber 35, through the first feed/discharge<br>
port 37a, thereby the first piston 36 is pushed by the first<br>
spring 34 in an anti-braking direction, and the outer cylinder<br>
member 47 is also pulled in the anti-braking direction. As<br>
a result, the head flange 55 is pressed, by a press pin 57, and<br>
the shaft rod 48 and the push rod 28 coupled with the shaft<br>
rod 4 8 are also pulled in the anti-braking direction and<br>
retracted. Therefore, a state that the brakes are not in<br>
operation is returned, as shown in Fig. 6.<br>
[0075]<br>
On the other hand, when a braking surface of the brake<br>
pad 14 shows wear, a stroke of the push rod 28 is increased<br>
which is necessary for actuating the brakes to result in a greater<br>
stroke of the guide member 49 connected to the push rod 28 via<br>
an O-ring 50. When the stroke exceeds a stroke regulated by<br>
a recess 51 installed on the guide member 49 and an engaging<br>
portion 64 of the partition 52, the engaging portion 64 is engaged<br>
with the recess 51, thus giving a great returning force to the<br>
guide member 49. Therefore, after the engaging portion 64 is<br>
engaged with the recess 51, the O-ring 50 is deformed to ride<br><br><br>
over a projection of the uneven surface 40, by which the push<br>
rod 28 is deviated (displaced) to the guide member 49 only by<br>
a portion corresponding to a further stroke of the push rod<br>
28.  In other words, the first piston 36 is moved toward a<br>
projected direction (a braking direction), by which the engaging<br>
portion 64 is engaged with the recess 51, and the first piston<br>
3 6 is further moved toward the projected direction, thereby<br>
the shaft rod 48, the push rod 28 and others are displaced toward<br>
the projected direction, with only the guide member 49 remaining<br>
as it is.  In addition, in most cases, since a wear quantity<br>
of the brake pad for each braking operation is quite small,<br>
a displacement quantity of the push rod 28 for one time is<br>
accordingly small to such an extent of a clearance between<br>
projections on the uneven surface 40.<br>
[0076]<br>
Further, where compressed air is discharged from the first<br>
feed/discharge port 37a to release the brakes by the normal<br>
brake means 27 after a relative displacement takes place between<br>
the push rod 28 and the guide member 4 9, the first piston 36<br>
is returned by the first spring 34 toward an anti-braking<br>
direction, and the head flange 55 is pushed toward the<br>
anti-braking direction by the press pin 57 attached to the outer<br>
cylinder member 47, which is pulled thereby. Then, the head<br><br>
flange 55 is rotated together With the shaft rod 48 rotationally<br>
supported by a thrust bearing 60, the shaft rod 48 is taken<br>
out from the push rod 28, and a displacement of the push rod<br>
28 with respect to the guide member 4 9 in an advancing direction<br>
is absorbed by a screw movement. As a result, the push rod<br>
28 is to project in the advancing direction only by an extent<br>
of the above deviation. Therefore, the push rod 28 is adjusted<br>
for the projected length and the brake cylinder device 2 can<br>
be subsequently actuated by a normal stroke of the push rod<br>
28.<br>
[0077]<br>
As described above, the brake cylinder device 2 of the<br>
present embodiment is constituted in such a manner that the<br>
push rod 28 moving together with the first piston 36 of the<br>
normal brake means 27 penetrates through the second piston 44<br>
of the spring brake means 2 9 and a predetermined resisting force<br>
is applied between the guide member 4 9 of the projected length<br>
adjusting means 30 and the push rod 28. Therefore, the brake<br>
cylinder device 2, which is provided with the normal brake means<br>
27, the spring brake means 29 and the projected length adjusting<br>
means 30, can be made compact by preventing the device from<br>
being complicated in mechanism and enlarged. Then, the<br>
pro j ected length adj ustingmeans 30 is provided with a regulating<br><br><br>
means 52 placed between the second piston 4 4 and the first spring<br>
34, having an engaging portion 64 engaged with a recess 51 formed<br>
on the guide member 4 9 and simply constituted so as to regulate<br>
a movable range of the guide member. It is, therefore, possible<br>
to regulate a range where the push rod 28 is adjusted for the<br>
projected length and a range where it is not adjusted by.using<br>
a simple mechanism.<br>
[0078]<br>
Thus, according to the brake cylinder device 2, it is<br>
possible to provide such a constitution that is provided with<br>
a normal brake means 27, a spring brake means 2 9 and means 30<br>
for adjusting the projected length of the push rod 28, capable<br>
of preventing the device from being complicated in mechanism<br>
and enlarged and also capable of realizing means for regulating<br>
a range where the projected length of the push rod 28 is adjusted<br>
and a range where it is not adjusted by using a simple mechanism.<br>
[0079]<br>
Further, according to the brake cylinder device 2, a recess<br>
51 and a regulating means 52 having an engaging portion 64 to<br>
be engaged with the recess 51 are used to function also as a<br>
detent for the guide member 49. It is, therefore, possible<br>
to realize not only the function of regulating a movable range<br>
in a direction in which the first piston 36 of the guide member<br><br><br>
4 9 moves but also the function as a detent by using the single<br>
regulating means 52, thus making the mechanism simple.<br>
[0080]<br>
Further, according to the brake cylinder device 2, a<br>
plurality of pairs of the corresponding recesses 51 and the<br>
engaging portions 64 are installed, by which loads acting on<br>
engaging parts can be dispersed to reduce wear, which occurs<br>
at the recesses 51 and the engaging portions 64, thereby<br>
improving the durability.<br>
[0081]<br>
Further, according to the brake cylinder device 2, the<br>
regulating means 52 is installed as a partition 52 for separating<br>
a region of the normal brake means 27 from that of the spring<br>
brake means 29, thus making it possible to form the regulating<br>
means 52 in a thin flat-plate shape and also make the constitution<br>
simple. Thus, the simply constituted regulating means 52 can<br>
be placed so as to attain an effective use of space in the brake<br>
cylinder device 2. Then, at assembly of the brake cylinder<br>
device 2, a guide member 4 9 can penetrate through an opening<br>
portion 65 of the partition 52 via a predetermined clearance<br>
without engagement of the recess 51 with the engaging portion<br>
64 . Therefore, the assembly can be carried out easily and with<br>
an increased efficiency.<br><br><br>
[0082]<br>
Further, according to the brake cylinder device 2, it<br>
is possible to provide easily and simply such a constitution<br>
that the guide member 4 9 can penetrate through the opening<br>
portion 65 of the partition 52 via a predetermined clearance<br>
without engagement of the recess 51 with the engaging portion<br>
64 at assembly of the brake cylinder device 2 by making the<br>
center of the guide member 49 eccentric to the center of the<br>
opening portion 65.<br>
[0083]<br>
Further, according to the brake cylinder device 2, the<br>
projected length adjusting means 30 is constituted in such a<br>
manner that the elastic member 50 is deformed and engaged (cut<br>
into), thus making it possible to stabilize a frictional force<br>
or a binding force between the push rod 28 and the guide member<br>
49. Thereby, it is possible to adjust and control a sliding<br>
resistance on the projected length adjusting means 30 in a simple<br>
constitution.<br>
[0084]<br>
Further, according to the brake cylinder device 2, since<br>
the push rod 28 is attached by being screwed with the shaft<br>
rod 48 moving together with the first piston 36, it is possible<br>
to provide such a constitution that a projected length of the<br><br><br>
push rod 28 is absorbed by a screw movement made by the shaft<br>
rod 48 with respect to the push rod 28. Therefore, it is possible<br>
to provide such a constitution that prevents a positional<br>
deviation of the first piston 36 with respect to a cylinder<br>
main body 26 also in a state that the projected length of the<br>
push rod 28 is adjusted, thereby keeping a capacity of the first<br>
pressure chamber 35 substantially at a constant level.<br>
[0085]<br>
Further, according to the brake cylinder device 2, the<br>
second piston 44 is locked with the outer cylinder member 47,<br>
which is arranged between the guide member 4 9 and the second<br>
piston 44 to move together with the first piston 36, thus making<br>
it possible to urge the push rod 28.  Therefore, the outer<br>
cylinder member 47 constituted in a simplified shape is placed,<br>
thus providing in a simple mechanism such a constitution that<br>
the push rod 28 is urged via the normal brake means when movement<br>
of the second piston 44 in the braking direction occurs.<br>
[0086]<br>
Further, according to the brake caliper device 1 of the<br>
present embodiment, it is possible to provide the brake caliper<br>
device 1, which is provided with the brake cylinder device 2<br>
having the normal brake means 27, the spring brake means 29<br>
and the means 30 for adjusting the projected length of the push<br><br><br>
rod 28, preventing the device f rombeing complicated inmechanism<br>
and enlarged, and making it possible to realize means 52 for<br>
regulating a range where the projected length of the push rod<br>
28 is adjusted and a range where it is not adjusted by using<br>
a simple mechanism.<br>
[0087]<br>
Further, according to the brake caliper device 1, since<br>
the first feed/discharge port 37a and the second feed/discharge<br>
port 45a are positioned below the swinging pin 16a in a<br>
perpendicular direction, it is possible to prevent the caliper<br>
body 11 and the brake cylinder device 2 from generating a momentum<br>
in a swinging direction both when feeding a pressurized fluid<br>
via the first feed/discharge port 37a to the first pressure<br>
chamber 35 and when feeding the pressurized fluid via the second<br>
feed/discharge port 45a to the second pressure chamber 43.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to prevent a localized contact of<br>
the brake pad 14 on the brake disc 15 and also a localized wear<br>
of the brake pad 14 in an emergency of the pressurized fluid.<br>
[0088]<br>
Further, according to the brake caliper device ,1, it is<br>
possible to attach the filter 78 together with the ventilation<br>
tube 75 only by screwing the ventilation tube 75 having the<br>
filter 78 into the cylinder main body 26 at the thread portion<br><br><br>
75a at the end thereof. Then, the filter 78 is placed inside<br>
the ventilation tube 75, thereby eliminating the necessity for<br>
providing a member or the like especially intended for attaching<br>
the filter 78. Therefore, it is possible to easily and quickly<br>
attach the filter 78 and the ventilation tube 75 to the cylinder<br>
main body 26 and also perform work for attaching the filter<br>
in a simplified manner.<br>
[0089]<br>
Further, according to the brake caliper device 1, the<br>
leg 18 is appropriately set for the dimensions when the brake<br>
caliper device 1 is removed and arranged on a floor for<br>
maintenance work of the brake caliper device 1, thus making<br>
it possible to keep the brake caliper device 1 horizontal on<br>
the basis of the lower end on one end of the caliper body 11<br>
and the leg 18. It is, therefore, possible to easily perform<br>
the maintenance work or the like, thereby improving work<br>
efficiency.<br>
[0090]<br>
Further, according to the brake caliper device 1, such<br>
a structure can be provided that the brake pad 14 can be easily<br>
attached or detached by using a latch 19 urged by a flat spring<br>
22 in a direction different from that in which the brake pad<br>
14 is attached or detached. Then, it is, possible to prevent<br><br><br>
the latch 19 from being unlocked only by inserting a snap pin<br>
20 below a back plate 12.  In other words, in performing work<br>
for exchanging the brake pad 14, the snap pin 20 is removed,<br>
thereby allowing the latch 19 to be unlocked, the latch 19 is<br>
turned against the flat spring 22, with a possible drop of the<br>
brake pad 14 taken into account, thus making it possible to<br>
securely remove the brake pad 14. Then, even at attachment<br>
of a new brake pad 14, the latch 19 is locked by the flat spring<br>
22 at a stage where the key portion 14a of the brake pad 14<br>
is allowed to slide on the key groove 12b of the back plate<br>
12 and arrives at a predetermined position.  Therefore, the<br>
new brake pad can be easily attached.  Further, the latch 19<br>
is coupled with the snap pin 20 by using a coupling chain 21,<br>
thereby easily providing a constitution for preventing the<br>
removal or loss of the snap pin 20. As a result, a brake caliper<br>
device 1 is provided, which is free of an inadvertent drop of<br>
the brake pad 14, realizing work of easily exchanging the brake<br>
pad so that the support only by the brake pad 14 can be released<br>
at any time, and also eliminating the necessity for troublesome<br>
and skilled work in tightening bolts by using a bundling wire<br>
in attaching the brake pad 14.<br>
[0091]<br>
An explanation has been so far made for embodiments of<br><br><br>
the present invention. However, the present invention shall<br>
not be limited to the above embodiments but may be executed<br>
in various modifications without departing from the claims of<br>
the patent. For example, the present invention may be executed<br>
in the following modifications.<br>
[0092]<br>
An explanation has been made for the present embodiment<br>
by exemplifying an air cylinder device actuated by air pressure<br>
used in the brake cylinder device 2 as a driving source of the<br>
brake caliper device 1. There is no restriction on the driving<br>
source and may include a cylinder device actuated by hydraulic<br>
pressure or others.<br>
[0093]<br>
Further, there is no restriction on a constitution in<br>
which the uneven surface 40 is formed on an outer circumferential<br>
surface of the push rod 28 and may include a constitution in<br>
which the outer circumferential surface is made flat and a<br>
predetermined resisting force is given from a frictional force<br>
imparted to the push rod 28 from an elastic member such as the<br>
O-ring 50. In this case, the push rod 28 can be easily machined<br>
on the outer circumferential surface, thus resulting in<br>
reduction in machining costs. Still further, there is no<br>
restriction in a case where recesses and projections are<br><br>
repeatedly arranged on the surface of the push rod 28 in a<br>
direction in which the push rod 2 8 moves to form the uneven<br>
surface 40, and also included is a case where surface treatment<br>
such as blast is given to the surface, thus making it possible<br>
to adjust a frictional force.<br>
[0094]<br>
Further, there is no restriction in a case where the push<br>
rod 2 8 is coupled with the guide member 4 9 via an elastic.member.<br>
Also included is a case where the push rod is coupled with the<br>
guide member by a mechanical constitution in such a manner that<br>
a predetermined resisting force can be applied at movement of<br>
the push rod to the guide member in parallel in a direction<br>
in which the first piston moves, for example, a gear mechanism<br>
having a predetermined rotational resistance is actuated,<br>
thereby the push rod is moved to the guide member.<br>
[0095]<br>
Still further, an explanation has been made for the brake<br>
cylinder device 2 of the present embodiment by referring to<br>
a case where it is used in a disc brake-type brake caliper device<br>
1. The present invention shall not be restricted thereto. In<br>
other words, the brake cylinder device 2 is not restricted to<br>
a case where it is used in a disc brake-type brake mechanism<br>
but may be used in a disc brake-type brake mechanism in which<br><br><br>
a brake pad is attached to the leading end of a push rod and<br>
the brake pad is allowed to be in contact with the wheel tread,<br>
thereby generating a braking force.<br>
[0096]<br>
