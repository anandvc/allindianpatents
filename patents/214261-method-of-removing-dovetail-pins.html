				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method of drilling dovetail pins, as well as auxiliary and<br>
cross keys installed in turbine rotors, to facilitate removal thereof.<br>
Certain steam turbine buckets utilize a finger dovetail configuration to provide<br>
attachment of the buckets to the turbine rotor. Specifically, generally radially oriented<br>
fingers on a bucket mate with opposite mating fingers machined in the rotor. Each<br>
bucket dovetail has three axially extending dovetail pin holes that may be aligned<br>
with corresponding holes pre-drilled in the rotor. After the buckets are fit to the rotor,<br>
the dovetail pin holes in the buckets are aligned with the corresponding holes in the<br>
rotor. After all of the buckets have been installed, the pin holes are final-reamed to<br>
allow the installation of the dovetail pins that hold the buckets in place on the rotor.<br>
During operation in a severe environment, the dovetail pins may become stuck in the<br>
bucket and/or rotor pin holes due to pressure and temperature effects, oxidation, as<br>
well as stepping of the pins due to the buckets pulling radially on the pins as a result<br>
of centrifugal forces. Removal of these dovetail pins for inspection or replacement<br>
can be difficult, time consuming and costly.<br>
Conventional methods of removing dovetail pins involve using a jack, a peening gun,<br>
and/or a powder actuated gun to push the pins out of the holes. If the pins do not<br>
move, and in the event the buckets were to be scrapped, one option has been to cut off<br>
the main section of the buckets and gang mill out the dovetail portion of the buckets<br>
from the rotor fingers. Residual material was removed by hand. If the buckets were<br>
to be saved, however, the dovetail pins were drilled through, using conventional<br>
manual drilling methods, and the leftover shells were removed again by hand.<br>
Another method used was to drill the pins part way through, insert a driver rod, and<br>
then push the pins out with a peening gun or powder actuated gun. Additional<br>
problems with the prior drilling methods involve: (1) a tendency for conventional<br>
drill bits to "walk" off center when drilling through a hard pin, and subsequently<br>
extend through the side of the pin and into the rotor; (2) the extensive time involved in<br>
hand picking out shells left when pins are drilled; (3) if the drilling is completed too deep into the pin, the<br>
driving operation can separate the end of the pin, leaving a partial shell in a hole which needs to be removed<br>
by hand; (4) when the pins are drilled, any initial misalignment of the drilling machine can also result in the<br>
drill bit or EDM electrode extending through the side of the pin and into the rotor. The deeper the drilling, the<br>
more profound the effect of misalignment and the greater the chance of rotor damage.<br>
The disclosure of US Patent 2,165,485 to Jackman is incorporated herein by reference. It describes a drill<br>
guide for quickly positioning a drill to drill a hole along the axis of a broken stud. The drill guide includes a<br>
pair of collars 12 telescopically disposed on a cylindrical shank 4. A drill is disposed in an axial bore 18 of<br>
the shank 4. The drill is operated to drill a guide hole down along the axis of, and into, the broken stud. The<br>
guide role having been made with the drill guide, a larger drill can then be used to drill a hole in the broken<br>
stud to the desired size, after which an extractor can be used to remove the broken stud.<br>
The present invention discloses a method which is superior than the above method, as it involves "drilling a<br>
first hole in the pin of a first diameter", the length of the hole being restricted to about half the axial length<br>
dimension. Jackman also does not disclose drilling a second hole of a smaller diameter as well as drilling<br>
the specified third hole.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention seeks to eliminate the above described problems associated with prior drilling<br>
methods. In the exemplary embodiment, a step drilling procedure is utilized which involves drilling a<br>
relatively large diameter hole (preferably using rapid EDM drilling) in the pin to be removed, for<br>
approximately 1/3 of the pin length. The electrode is then removed and pin removal is attempted via<br>
conventional means. If the pin does not move, the electrode is replaced with a smaller electrode and a<br>
smaller diameter hole is continued to a point beyond the midpoint of the pin. After the electrode is removed,<br>
pin removal is again attempted. If the pin still does not release, a final drilling step utilizes the same smaller<br>
electrode of the previous step to continue to drill the hole to about 3A of the length of the pin. Testing has<br>
demonstrated that at this point, the pressure on the pin will be sufficiently relieved to enable removal of the<br>
pin. It is significant that the step down in electrode size while drilling deeper, accommodates any slight<br>
misalignment of the electrode, reducing the potential for drilling through the side of the pin and into the<br>
rotor.<br>
Accordingly, in its broader aspects, the present invention relates to a method of removing a pin from a hole<br>
comprising a) drilling a first diameter in the pin a selected fraction of a length dimension of the pin and<br>
attempting removal of the pin; b) if the pin cannot be removed, drilling a second hole of a second diameter<br>
smaller than said first diameter an extended fraction of the length dimension of the pin; and c) removing the<br>
pin.<br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to a method for removing a dovetail pin from a<br>
turbine bucket-to-rotor finger dovetail arrangement wherein generally radially<br>
oriented fingers on the bucket and on a rotor wheel are interleaved and where a<br>
plurality of axially oriented dovetail pins secure the buckets to the rotor, the method<br>
comprising a) drilling a first hole in the pin of a first diameter and extending about 1/3<br>
of an axial length dimension of the pin; b) drilling a second hole, continuing from the<br>
first hole, of a second diameter less than the first diameter, and extending about 1/2<br>
the axial length dimension of the pin; c) drilling a third hole, continuing from the<br>
second hole, of a diameter substantially equal to the second hole, and extending about<br>
3/4 the axial length of the pin; and d) removing the pin.<br>

dovetail configuration in a row of buckets on a turbine rotor wheel, with dovetail pins<br>
securing the buckets to the rotor;<br>
FIGURE 2 is a schematic section through a dovetail pin, illustrating a first drilling<br>
step in accordance with the invention;<br>

FIGURE 5 is a view similar to Figure 4 but illustrating how the present drilling<br>
operation accommodates axial misalignment of the drilling electrode.<br>
detailed description of the invention<br>
In Figure 1, a section 10 of a turbine wheel is shown including a plurality of buckets<br>
12 secured to a turbine rotor wheel 14 by a finger dovetail arrangement coupled with<br>
a plurality of axially extending dovetail pins 16. More specifically, each bucket 12<br>
has a plurality (four in the exemplary embodiment) of bucket dovetail projections or<br>
fingers 18 that are received within a plurality of rotor dovetail slots 20 therebetween.<br>
Similarly, the turbine wheel has a plurality of generally radially extending dovetail<br>
projections 22 received in a plurality of bucket dovetail slots 24 therebetween.<br>
During installation, after all of the buckets have been loaded onto the rotor wheel 14,<br>
the buckets 12 are adjusted so that the dovetail pin holes 26 in the rotor and in the<br>
buckets are in axial alignment. Figure 1 illustrates some dovetail pins 16 in place as<br>
well as some empty holes 26 for ease of understanding. The holes 26 are formed in<br>
the bucket dovetail fingers as well as the rotor dovetail fingers, and are axially<br>
alignable. After the buckets have been loaded onto the wheel, the dovetail and rotor<br>
holes are aligned and then final-reamed to allow installation of the dovetail pins 16<br>
which hold the buckets in place on the wheel. This invention relates to a drilling<br>
technique for subsequent removal of the pins 16 for inspection and/or replacement<br>
purposes.<br>
With reference to Figures 2-4, the first step in the procedure is to drill a relatively<br>
large hole 28, with a diameter of, for example, .44 inch in a pin between about 5 and<br>
about 9 inches in length and having a diameter of about 1/2 - 5/8 inch, preferably<br>
using high speed EDM drilling procedures. This hole or bore is drilled to an axial<br>
length approximately equal to 1/3 of the pin length, terminating at 30. The electrode<br>
is then removed and pin removal is attempted, for example, by driving the rod through<br>
the hole with a driver, peening gun or powder actuated gun. If the pin cannot be<br>
removed, the electrode is replaced with a smaller electrode and drilling of a smaller<br>
hole 32, with a diameter of about .260 inch, is continued to a point about halfway or<br>
just beyond halfway along the length of the pin as shown in Figure 3, terminating at<br>
34. The electrode is removed and pin removal is again attempted, utilizing similar<br>
conventional procedures described above. If the pin still cannot be removed, a third<br>
and final drilling step employs the same smaller electrode and the hole 32 is continued<br>
with the same diameter of about .260 inch from the prior termination point 34 forward<br>
along an extended hole or bore 36 to about 3/4 the length of the pin, terminating at 38.<br>
After the electrode is removed, the pin is again pushed, using conventional methods.<br>
All testing to date indicates that after this third drilling stage, pressure on the pin will<br>
be sufficiently relieved to enable it to be removed.<br>
With reference to Figure 5, it will be appreciated that the stepping down procedure in<br>
hole diameter accommodates slight axial misalignment, minimizing the chance that<br>
the drill bit will pass through the pin and damage the rotor. Thus, the Figure<br>
illustrates a pin 40 with a first hole 42 drilled generally axially of the pin, but with a<br>
slight axial misalignment. The misalignment is exaggerated through one or more<br>
smaller diameter drillings 44 but, because of the step-down feature, the drilled hole<br>
does not break through the side of the pin.<br>
It will be understood that the invention is also applicable for the removal of auxiliary<br>
and cross keys used to secure the last-installed notch buckets and/or blocks used with<br>
pine tree or other bucket dovetail configurations.<br>
While the invention has been described in connection with what is presently<br>
considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood<br>
that the invention is not to be limited to the disclosed embodiment, but on the<br>
contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements<br>
included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.<br>
