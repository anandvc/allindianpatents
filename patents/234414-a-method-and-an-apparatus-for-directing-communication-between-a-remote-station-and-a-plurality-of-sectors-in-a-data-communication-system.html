				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SELECTING A SERVING SECTOR IN A DATA COMMUNICATION<br>
SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Field<br>
[1001]	The present invention relates generally to communication<br>
systems, and more specifically to a method and an apparatus for selecting a serving sector in a data communication system.<br>
Background<br>
[1002]	Communication systems have been developed to allow<br>
transmission of information signals from an origination station to a physically distinct destination station. In transmitting informaticn signal from the origination station over a communication channel, the information signal is first converted into a form suitable for efficient transmission over the communication channel. Conversion, or nrradulation, of the infonnation signal involves varying a parameter d a carrier wave in accordance with tfie nfocma&amp;xi signal in such a way that the spectrum of the resulting modulated cam'er is confined within the communication channel bandwidth. At the destination station the original information signal is replicated from the modulated earner wave received over the communication channel. Such a replication is generally achieved by using an inverse of the modulation process employed by the origination station.<br>
[1003]	Modulation     also     facilitates     multiple-access,     i.e.,<br>
simultaneous transmission and/or reception, of several signals over a common<br>
f<br>
communication channel. Multiple-access communication systems often include a plurality of remote subscriber units requiring intermittent service of relatively short duration rather than continuous access to the common communication chemnel. Several multiple-access techniques are known in the art, such as time division multiple-access (TDMA), frequency division multiple-access (FDMA),<br><br>
and amplitude modulation multiple-access (AM). Another type of a multiple-access technique is a code division multiple-access (CDMA) spread spectrum system that conforms to the "TlA/EiA/IS-95 Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wide-Band Spread Spectrum Cellular System." hereinafter referred to as the IS-95 standard. The use of CDMA techniques in a multiple-access communication system is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,901.307, entitled "SPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE-ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS; and U.S. Patent No. 5,103.459. entitled "SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING WAVEFORMS IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM," both assigned to the assignee of the present invention.<br>
[1004]	A   multiple-access   communication   system   may   be   a<br>
wireless or wire-line and may carry voice and/or data. An example of a communication system carrying both voice and data is a system in accordance with the 18-95 standard, which specifies transmitting voice and data over the communication channeL A method for transmitting data in code channel frames of fixed size ts described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 5,504,773, entitled -METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE FORIVIATTING OF DATA FOR TRANSMISSION", assigned to the assignee of the present irwention. (n accordance with the IS-95 standard, the data or voice is partitioned into code channel frames that are 20 milliseconds wide with data rates as high as 14.4 Kbps. Adcfitional examples of a communication systems carrying both voice and data comprise communication systems confonming to the "3rd Generation Partnership ProjecT (3GPP), embodied in a set of documents including Document Nos. 3G TS 25.211, 3G TS 25.212, 3G TS 25,213, and 3G TS 25.214 (the W-CDMA standard), or "TR-45.5 Physical Layer Standard for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems" (the IS-2000 standard).<br>
[1005]	In      a      multiple-access       communication       system,<br>
communications between users are conducted through one or more base stations. A first user on one subscriber station communicates to a second user on a second subscriber station by transmitting data on a reverse link to a base station. The base station receives the data and can route the data to anoti^er<br><br>
base station. The data is transmitted on a fonward link of the same base station, or the other base station, to the second subscriber station. The fonward link refers to transmission from a base station to a subscriber station and the reverse link refers to transmission from a subscriber station to a base station. Likewise, the communication can be conducted between a first user on one mobile subscriber station and a second user on a landline station. A base station receives the data from the user on a reverse link, and routes the data through a public switched telephone network (PSTN) to the second user. In many communication systems, e.g., IS-95, W-CDMA, IS-2000, the forward link and the reverse link are allocated separate frequencies,<br>
[1006]	An example of a data only communication system is a high<br>
data rate (HDR) communication system that conforms to the TlA/ElA/lS-856 industry standard, hereinafter referred to as the IS-856 standard. This HDR system is based on a communication system disclosed in co-pending application serial number 08/963,386, entitled "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR HIGH RATE PACKET DATA TRANSMISSION/ filed 11/3/1997. assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The HDR communication system defines a set of data rates, ranging from 38.4 kbps to 2.4 Mbps, at which an access point (AP) may send data to a subscrS^er staSon (access tenrDinal, AT). Because the AP is analogous to a tDase station, the tenmiriology wTtt&gt; respect to ceils and sectors is the same as with respect to voice systems.<br>
[1007]	A significant difference between voice sen/ices and data<br>
services is the fact that ttie former imposes stm^nt and fixed delay requirements. Typicafly, the overall one-way delay of speech frames must be less than 100 ms. In contrast, the data delay can become a variable parameter used to optimize the efficiency of the data communication system. Specifically, more efficient error correcting coding techniques which require significantly larger delays than those that can be tolerated by voice services can be utilized. An exemplary effident coding scheme for data is disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Serial No, 08/743,688, entitled "SOFT DECISION OUTPUT DECODER FOR DECODING CONVOLUTIONALLY ENCODED CODEWORDS", filed November 6, 1996, assigned to the assignee of the present invention.<br><br>
[1008]	Another significant difference between voice sen/ices and<br>
data services fs that the former requires a fixed and common grade of service (GOS) for all users. Typically, for digital systems providing voice services, this translates into a fixed and equaf transmission rate for all users and a maximum tolerable value for the error rates of the speech frames. In contrast, for data services, the GOS can be different from user to user and can be a parameter optimized to increase the overall efficiency of the data communication system. The GOS of a data communication system is typically defined as the total delay incurred in the transfer of a predetermined amount of data, hereinafter referred to as a data packet.<br>
[1009]	Yet another significant difference between voice sen/ices<br>
and data services is that the former requires a reliable communication link. When a mobile station, communicating with a first base station, moves to the edge of the associated cell or sector, the mobile station initiates a simultaneous communication with a second base station. This simultaneous communication, when the mobile station receives a signal carrying equrvafent infonnnation from two base stations, termed soft hand-off, is a process of establishing a communication Rnk with the second base station wfiile maintaining a communication Jink with the first t^ase station. When the mobile station eventually leaves the ceU or sector assodated with the fust base station, and breaks the communication link with the first base station, it continues the communication on tt^ communkation link estabFished with the second base station. Because the soft hand-off is a "make before break* mechanism, the soft-handoff minimizes the probability of dropped calls. The method and system for providing a communication with a mobile station ttirough more than one base station during the soft hand-off process are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,267.251. entitled "MOBILE ASSISTED SOFT HAND-OFF IN A CDMA CELLUUR TELEPHONE SYSTEM,' assigned to the assignee of tf^e present invention. Softer hand-off is the process whereby the communication occurs over multiple sectors that are serviced by the same base station. The process of softer hand-off is described in detail in co-pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/763.498, entitied "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PERFORMING HAND-OFF BETWEEN SECTORS OF A COMMON BASE<br><br>
STATION", filed December 11, 1996, assigned to the assignee of the present invention. Thus, both soft and softer hand-off for voice sen/ices result in redundant transmissions from two or more base stations to improve reliability.<br>
[1010]	This   additional    reliability    is    not    required   for   data<br>
transmission because the data packets received in error can be retransmitted. For data services, the parameters, which measure the quality and effectiveness of a data communication system, are the transmission delay required to transfer a data packet and the average throughput rate of the system. Transmission delay does not have the same impact in data communication as in voice communjcation. but the transmission delay is an important metric for measuring the quality of the data communication system. The average throughput rate is a measure of the efficiency of the data transmission capability of the communication system. Consequently, the transmit power and resources used to support soft hand-off can be more efficiently used for transmission of additional data. To maximize the throughput, the transmitting sector should be chosen in a way that maximizes the forward link throughput as perceived by the AT.<br>
(1011]	There is, therefore, a need In the art for a method and an<br>
apparatus for selecting a sector in a data communication system that maximizes the forward link througfoput as perceived by the AT.<br>
SUm&amp;ARY<br>
[1012]	In one aspect of the invention, the adbove-stated needs are<br>
addressed by detemnining at the remote station a quality metric of a forward link for each sector in the remote station's list; determining a quality metric of a reverse link to eadi sector in the remote station's list; and directing communication between the remote station and one sector from the sectors in the remote station's list in accordance vwth said determined quality metric of a fonA/ard link and said determined quality metric of a reverse link. The quality metric of a fonA^ard link for each sector in frie remote station's list may be determined by measuring a signal-to Interference and-noise-ratio of the foiward link. The quality metric of a reverse link to each sector in ttie remote station's<br><br>
list may be determined by processing at the remote station the forward link from each sector in the remote station's list. The signal processed may be obtained by measuring at each sector the quality metric of the reverse link; processing the quality metric to provide an indicator of the quality metric; and providing the indicator on a forward link. The communication between the remote station and one sector from the sectors in the remote station's list may be directed in accordance with said determined quality metric of a fon^/ard link and said determined quality metric of a reverse link by assigning credits to each sector in the remote station's list except a sector currently serving the remote station in accordance with said determined quality metric of a fonward link and said determined quality metric of the reverse link; and directing communication between the remote station and one sector from the sectors in the remote station's list in accordance with said assigned credits.<br>
[1013]	In another aspect of the invention, the above-stated needs<br>
are addressed by determining at the remote station a quality metric of a forward link for each sector in the remote station's list; and directing communication between the remote station and one sector from the sectors in the remote station's list in accordance with said determined quality metric of a forward Snk. The quality metric of a fonward link for each sector in the remote statk&gt;n's list may be detemnined by measuring a signaf-to-interference and-noise-ratk) of the forward link. The communication between the remote station and one sector from the sectors in the remote station's list may be directed in accordance with said determined quality metric of a forward link by assigning credits to each sector in the remote station's fist except a sector currently serving the remote station in accordance with said detemiined quality metric of a forward link and directing communication between the remote station and one sector from the sectors In the remote station's list in accordance with said assigned credits.<br><br>

Description<br>
[1047]	FIG.1   illustrates   a   conceptual   diagram   of   an   HDR<br>
communication system capable of performing re-pointing in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, e.g., a communication system in accordance with the IS-856 standard. An AP 100 transmits data to an AT 104 over a fonA^ard link 106(1). and receives data from the AT 104 over a reverse link 108(1). Similarly, an AP 102 transmits data to the AT 104 over a fon/vard link 106(2), and receives data from the AT 104 over a reverse link 108(2). In accordance with one embodiment, data transmission on the fonward link occurs from one AP to one AT at or near the maximum data rate that can be supported by the fonward link and the communication system. Other channels of the forward link, e.g., control channel, may be transmitted from multiple APs to one AT. Reverse link data communication may occur from one AT to one or more APs. The AP 100 and the AP 102 are connected to a controller 110 over backhauls 112(1) and 112(2). The tenn backhaul is used to mean a communication link between a controller and an AP. Although only two ATs and one AP are shown in RG-1, one of ordinary skill In the art recognizes that this is for pedagogical purposes only, arxi the communics^on system can comprise plurality of ATs and AP's.<br>
[1048]	Initially, the AT 104 and one of the AFs, e.g., the AP 100,<br>
establish a communication link using a predetermined access procedure. In this connected state, the AT 104 is able to receive data and control messages from the AP 100, arnl is able to transmit data and control messages to the AP 100. The AT 104 continually searches for other APs that could be added to the AT 104 active set The active set comprises a list of the APs capable of communication with the AT 104. When such an AP is found, the AT 104 calculates a quality metric of the AP's fonward link, which in one embodiment comprises a sigr^l-to-interference and-noise ratio (SINR). In one embodiment, the AT 104 searches for other APs and determines the APs SINR in accordance with a pilot signal. Simultaneously, the AT 104 calculates the fonward link quality metric for each AP in frie AT 104 active set. If the fonward link quality metric from a particular AP is above a predetermined add threshold<br><br>
or below a predetermined drop threshold for a predetermined period of time, the AT 104 reports this information to the AP 100. Subsequent messages from the AP 100 direct the AT 104 to add to or to delete from the AT 104 active set the particular AP.<br>
[1049]	The AT 104 selects a sen/ing AP from the active set based<br>
on a set of parameters. The term serving AP refers to an AP that a particular AT selected for data communication or an AP that is communicating data to the particular AT. The set of parameters can comprise present and previous SINR measurements, a bit-error-rate and/or a packet-error-rate, and other parameters known to one skilled in the art. In one embodiment, the serving AP is selected in accordance with the largest SINR measurement. The AT 104 then transmits to the selected AP a 0ata request message (DRC message) on the data request channel (DRC channel). The DRC message can contain the requested data rate or, alternatively, an indication of the quality of the fonA/ard link, e.g.. the measured SINR. the bit-error-rate, or the packet-error-rate- In one embodiment, the AT 104 can direct the transmission of the DRC message to a specific AP by the use of a Walsh code, which uniquely identifies the specific AP. The DRC message symbols are exclusively OR'ed (XOR) with the unique Walsh code. The XOR operation is referred to as Walsh covering of a signaf. Since each AP in the active set of the AT 104 is identified by a unique Walsh code, only the selected AP which performs the identical XOR operation as that performed by the AT 104 with the correct Walsh code can correctly decode the DRC message.<br>
[1050]	The data to be transmitted to the AT 104 anive at the<br>
controller 110. In accordance with one embodiment, the controller 110 sends the data to all APs in AT 104 active set over the backhaul 112. In another embodiment the controller 110 first determines, which AP was selected by the AT 104 as the serving AP, and then sends the data to the sen^ng AP. The data are stored in a queue at the AP(s). A paging message is then sent by one or more APs to the AT 104 on respective control channels. The AT 104 demodulates and decodes the signals on one or more control channels to obtain the paging messages.<br><br>
[1051]	At   each   time   time-slot,   the   AP   can   schedule   data<br>
transmission to any of the ATs that received the paging message. An exemplary method for scheduling transmission is described in U.S. Patent No. 6.229.795, entitled "SYSTEM FOR ALLOCATING RESOURCES IN A COMMUNICATION SYSTEM," assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The AP uses the rate control information received from each AT in the DRC message to efficiently transmit foPA/ard link data at the highest possible rate. In one embodiment, the AP determines the data rate at which to transmit the data to the AT 104 based on the most recent value of the DRC message received from the AT 104. Additionally, the AP uniquely identifies a transmission to the AT 104 by using a spreading code which is unique to that mobile station. In the exemplary embodiment, this spreading code is the long pseudo noise (PN) code, which is defined by the 13-856 standard.<br>
[1052]	The AT 104, for which the data packet is intended, receives<br>
the data transmission and decodes the data packet. In one embodiment, each data packet is associated with an kjentifier, e.g. a sequence number, which is used by the AT 104 to detect either missed or duplicate transmissions. In such an event, the AT 104 communicates via the reverse link data chanr^l the sequence numbers of the missing data units. The controller 110. whk:h receives ttie data messages from the AT 104 via the AP communicating with the AT 104, then kxficates to the AP wtiat data units were not received by the AT 104. The AP then schedules a retransmission of such data units.<br>
[1053]	Wtien the communication link between the AT 104 and the<br>
AP 100, operating in the variable rate mode, deteriorates betoyN required reliability level, the AT 104 first attempts to detenmine whether communication with another AP in the variable rate mode supporting an acceptable rate data is possible. If the AT 104 ascertains such an AP (e.g., the AP 102), a re-pointing to the AP 102, therefore, to a different communication link occurs, and the data transmissions continue from the AP 102 in the variable rate mode. The above-mentioned deterioration of the communication link can be caused by, e.g., the AT 104 moving from a coverage area of the AP 100 to the coverage area of the AP 102, shadowing, fading, and other reasons known to one skilled in the art. Alternatively, when a communication link between the AT 104 and another AP<br><br>
(e.g., the AP 102) that may achieve higher throughput rate that the currently used communication link becomes available, a re-pointing to the AP 102, therefore, to a different communication link occurs, and the data transmissions continue from the AP 102 in the variable rate mode. If the AT 104 fails to detect an AP that can operate in the variable rate mode and support an acceptable data rate, the AT 104 transitions into a fixed rate mode.<br>
[1054]	In one embodiment, the AT 104 evaluates the<br>
communications links with all candidate APs for both variable rate data and fixed rate data modes, and selects the AP, which yields the highest throughput,<br>
[1055]	The AT 104 will switch from the fixed rate mode back to the<br>
variable rate mode if the sector is no longer a member of the AT 104 active set.<br>
[1056]	In the exemplary embodiment, the above described the<br>
fixed rate mode and associated methods for transition to and from the fixed mode are similar to those disclosed in detail in U.S, Patent No. 6,205,129, entitled - METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR VARIABLE AND FIXED FORWARD LINK RATE CONTROL IN A MOBILE RADIO COMMUNICATION SYSTEM ", assigned to the assignee of the present invention. Other fixed rate modes and associated methods for transition to and from the fixed mode can also be contemplated and are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[1057]	One skilled in the art recognizes that an AP can comprise<br>
one or more sectors. In the description above, the term AP was used genericaify to allow clear explanation of basic concepts of the HDR communication system. However, one skilled in the art can extend the explained concepts to AP comprising any number of sectors. Consequently, the concept of sector will be used throughout the rest of the document.<br><br>
Forward Link Structure<br>
[1058]	FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary forward link waveform 200.<br>
For pedagogical reasons, the wavefomi 200 is modeled after a forward link waveform of the above-mentioned HDR system. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the teaching is applicable to different waveforms. Thus, for example, in one embodiment the wavefomi does not need to contain pilot signal bursts, and the pilot signal can be transmitted on a separate channel, which can be continuous or bursty. The fonn/ard link 200 is defined in terms of frames. A frame is a structure comprising 16 time-slots 202, each time-slot 202 being 2048 chips long, corresponding to a 1.66. ms. time-slot duration, and, consequently, a 26.66. ms. frame duration. Each time-slot 202 is divided into two half-time-slots 202a, 202b, with pilot bursts 204a. 204fa transmitted within each half-time-slot 202a, 202b. In the exemplary embodiment, each pilot burst 204a, 204b is 96 chips long, and is centered at the mid-point of its associated haif-time-siot 202a, 202b. The pilot bursts 204a, 204b comprise a pilot channel signai covered by a Walsh cover with index 0. A forward medium access control channel (MAC) 206 forms two bursts, wtiich are transmitted immediateiy t&gt;efore and nnmediateiy after the pilot burst ^}4 of each hatf-time-slot 202. in the exemplary embodiment, the MAC is composed of up to 64 code channels, which are orthogonally covered by 64-ary Walsh codes. Each code channel is Identified by a MAC index, which has a value between 1 and 64, and identifies a unique 64-ary Walsh cover. A reverse power control channel (RPC) is used to regulate the power of the reverse link signals for each subscriber station. The RPC is assigned to one of the available MACs with MAC index between 5 and 63. The MAC with MAC index 4 is used for a reverse activity channel (RA), whkdi performs flow control on the reverse traffic channel. The fon^ard link traffic channel and control channel payload is sent in the remaining portions 208a of the first half-time-slot 202a and the remaining portions 208b of the second half-time-slot 202b.<br><br>
Re-pointing using a ORG Lock Indication - Introduction<br>
[1059]	A re-pointing decision is made by the AT 104 in accordance<br>
with a condition of a forward link, a condition of a reverse link, or a condition of both a forward link and a reverse link. As described above, the AT 104 determines a forward link quality metric directly, e.g.. by measuring the fonfl/ard link SINR, The quality metric of a reverse link may comprise a reverse link SINR, a DRC erasure rate, a filtered RPC mean, and other quality metrics known to one skilled in the art.<br>
{1060]	As discussed, the AT 104 identifies a sending sector of a<br>
particular AP and transmits a DRC message on a DRC channel on a reverse link. The reverse link carrying the DRC messages between the AT 104 and the sen/ing sector is subject to various factors that change characteristics of the communication channel. In a wireless communications systems these factors comprise, but are not limited to: fading, noise, interference from other terminals, and other factors known to one skilled in the art. The DRC message is protected against the changing characteristics of the communication channel by various methods, e-g., message lengtti selection, encoding, symbol repetition. interieaving, transmission power, and other methods known to one of ordinary skin in the art. However, these methods impose performance penalties, e.g., increased overhead, thus, decreased throughput, increased power consumption, increased peak-to-average power, increased power amplifier backoff, more expensive power aunplifiers, and other penalties known to one skilled in the art Therefore, an engineering compromise tjetween a reliability of message delivery and an amount of overhead must be made. Consequently, even with the protection of information, the conditions of the communication channel can degrade to the point at which the serving sector possibly cannot decode (erases) some of the DRC messages. Therefore, the DRC erasure rate is directly related to the conditions of the reverse link, and the DRC erasure rate is a good quality metric of the reverse link.<br>
[1061]	However, the AT 104 can directly determine neither the<br>
reverse link SINR nor the DRC erasure rate. Both the reverse link SINR and the DRC erasure rate may be directly determined by the sectors in the AT 104<br><br>
active set. The sector(s) then supplies the AT 104 with the determined values of the reverse link SINR or the DRC erasure rate via a feedback loop. In order for a sector to transmit accurate information regarding the reverse link SINR or DRC erasure rate, the sector must use some forward link capacity. In order to minimize the impact on forward link capacity the reverse link SINR or the DRC erasure rate is sent with very low granularity. In one embodiment, the granularity is one bit. Furthermore, a consideration of a feedback loop speed versus a performance of the Reverse Link Traffic Channel performance must be made.<br>
[1062]	Therefore, in a Message Based DRC Lock embodiment,<br>
each sector in the AT 104 active set monitors the DRC channel and evaluates an erasure rate of the DRC messages. Each sector then sets a DRC Lock Bit for the AT 104 in accordance with the evaluated erasure rate. In one embodiment, the DRC Lock Bit set to one value, e.g., one ("in-lock"), indicates that the DRC erasure rate is acceptable; the DRC Lock Bit set to a second value, e.g., zero ("out-of-lock^, indicates that the DRC erasure rate is unacceptable. The senang sector then sends the DRC Lock Bit to the AT 104 in a message on a control channel. The control channel for a cooimunica&amp;xi system in accordance with ttie IS-856 standard has a period of 426 ms.<br>
[1063]	In a Punctured DRC Lock embodiment, the DRC Lock Bit \s<br>
updated at a rate dsfferent from the control channel period, and purH:tured into an RPC channel one or more times every frame. The term purxitured is used herein to mean sending the DRC Lock Bit instead of a RPC biL<br>
[1064]	The AT 104 tfien uses the reverse link quality metric<br>
together with the forward link quality metric to make a re-pointing decision.<br>
Re*pointing with a Message Based DRC Lock<br>
•<br>
Access Point Processing<br>
[1065]	The processing method at the AP in accordance with one<br>
embodiment comprises there phases,    in the first phase, mapping a DRC<br>
Erasure and/or a valid DRC to a binary fomn generates a DRC Erasure Bit. In<br>
the second phase, processing the DRC Erasure Bits generates a DRC erasure<br><br>
rate. In the third phase, sampling the processed DRC erasure rate every control channel period generates a DRC Lock Bit.<br>
[1066]	The above-described phases one and two are repeated<br>
every time-slot by every sector in the AT 104 active set, as illustrated in FIG. 3 in accordance with an embodiment. The method starts in step 302. The method continues in step 304.<br>
[1067]	In step 304, the AP receives an updated DRC. The method<br>
continues in step 306,<br>
[1068]	In step 306, the AP tests the updated DRC. If the DRC was<br>
erased, the method continues in step 308, othenA/ise. the method continues in step 310.<br>
[1069]	In step 308, the DRC Erasure Bit is assigned a value of<br>
one. The method continues in step 312.<br>
[1070]	In step 310, the DRC Erasure Bit is assigned a value of<br>
zero. The method continues in step 312.<br>
[1071]	In step 312, the DRC Erasure Bit is processed to generate<br>
a DRC erasure rate. In one embodiment, the processing comprises filtering by a filter with a pre-determined time constant. In one embodiment, the fitter is realized in a digital domain. The value of the pre-determined time constant may be established in accordafrce with system simulation, by experiment or via other engineering methods known to one of ordinary skills in the art as an optimum in accordance with:<br>
reHabifity of an estimate ensuing from a choice of the time constant, and<br>
latency of an estimate ensuing from the choice of the time constant.<br>
[1072]	The method continues in step 314.<br>
[1073]	In step 314, the system time is tested to establish the<br>
beginning of a control channel capsule. If the test is positive, the method continues in step 316, otherwise the method returns to step 304,<br>
[1074]	Steps  316  through 326   introduce  hysteresis  rules for<br>
generating the DRC Lock Bit. The hysteresis is introduced to avoid rapid re-pointing when the channel SINR varies rapidly. The hysteresis ailes are as follows:<br><br>
[1075]	If the DRC Lock Bit Is currently set to one, then the filtered<br>
DRC erasure rate must exceed first DRC erasure threshold (DRC_Erasure_Th2) for the DRC Lock Bit to be set to zero; and<br>
[1076]	If the DRC Lock Bit is currently set to zero, then the Filtered<br>
DRC Erasure rate has to be below a second pre-determined DRC erasure threshold (DRC_Erasure_Th1) for the DRC Lock to be set to one.<br>
[1077]	In one embodiment, the values DRC_Erasure_Th1  and<br>
DRC_Erasure_Th2 are pre-determined in accordance with the communication system simulation, by experiment or other engineering methods known to one of ordinary skills in the art. In another embodiment, the values DRC_Erasure_Th1 and DRC_Erasure_Th2 are changed in accordance with the change of the conditions of the communication link. In either embodiment, the values of DRC_Erasurejrh1 and DRC_Erasure_Th2 are selected to optimize the following requirements to:<br>
minimize the dead-zone (when the DRC Lock Bit is not updated); and<br>
transmit the most current reverse link cfnannel state infomiation to the AT.<br>
[1078]	In step 316, tlie cunrent DRC Lock Bit value is compared to<br>
1. If the DRC Lock Bit value equals 1, the mettxxJ continues tn step 320, otherwise, the method continues in step 318-<br>
[1079]	In step 318, the DRC erasure rate is compared to the<br>
DRC_Erasure_Th1- If the DRC erasure rate is less than ttie DRC.ErasureJThl, the method continues in step 322, otfien^rise. the method continues in step 324.<br>
[1080]	In step 320, the DRC erasure rate is compared to ttie<br>
DRC_Erasurejrh2- If the DRC erasure rate is less than me DRC_Erasure.Th2, the method continues in sep 324, othen^vtse, the method continues in step 326.<br>
[1081]	In step 322, the DRC Lock Bit value Is set to 0.   The<br>
method continues in step 328.<br>
[1082]	In step 324, the DRC Lock Bit value is set to 1,   The<br>
method continues in step 328.<br><br>
[1083]	In step 326, the DRC Lock Bit value is set to 0.   The<br>
method continues in step 328.<br>
[1084]	In step 328, the DRC Lock Bit is set at the appropriate<br>
position of the control channel message. The method returns to step 304.<br>
Access Terminal Processing<br>
[1085]	As discussed, in one embodiment, the AT is assumed to be<br>
able to demodulate a control channel from only one sector in the ATs active set. The processing method at the AT in accordance with the embodiment comprises the phases of (i) Initialization, (ii) Credit Accumulation, and (iii) Decision.<br>
Initiaifzation<br>
[1086]	During the initialization stage, the AT 104 selects a sector<br>
with the best fonward link quality metric, i.e., the highest SfNR, as the serving sector. The AT 104 sets the DRC for the selected sector "in-lock' and initializes credits for all non-sen/ing sectors to zero.<br>
[1087]	In one embodiment, two types of credits are defined -<br>
switching credits and monitoring credits. The credits are described in more details in the Credit Accumulatran paragraph.<br>
[1088]	The initialization phase in accordance with one embodiment<br>
is illustrated in RG. 4. The method starts in step 402- The method continues in step 404.<br>
[1089]	fn step 404, the AT selects a sector with the best forward<br>
link quality metric as the serving sector, and sets the sector's DRC •*in4ock.' The method continues in step 406,<br>
[1090]	In step 406, a variable count is set to one.  The method<br>
continues in step 408,<br>
[1091]	In step 408, the variable count is tested against an active<br>
set size. If the variable count is greater than the active set size, the method continues in an accumulation phase. othenA/ise, the method continues in step<br><br>
[1092]	In step 410.  the inquiry is  made whether the sector<br>
designated by the variable count is the current serving sector as selected in step 404. If the test is positive, the method continues in step 414, othenwise. the method continues in step 412.<br>
[1093]	In step 412, monitoring credits for a non-serving sector<br>
(CM_NS) and switching credits for a non-serving sector (CS_NS) are set to zero. The method continues in step 414.<br>
[1094]	In step 414. the variable count is incremented, and the<br>
method returns to step 408.<br>
Credit Accumulation<br>
[1095]	As discussed, two types of credits are defined - switching<br>
credits and monitoring credits in accordance with one embodiment. Switching credits are used to qualify a non-serving sector for re-pointing, if the DRC of the non-serving sector is "in lock" with a pre-determined probability. Thus, CS_NS are incremented if:<br>
[1096]	a fooA/ard link SINR of the non-sennng sector (FL_NS) is<br>
greater than a fonward link SINR of the cunrent serving sector (FL.SS) modified by a pre-detemnined value (FL_SINR JTh); and<br>
[1097]	a filtered RFC mean for the norvsennng sector (RL„NS) is<br>
below a pre-detemiined threshold (RPC_Th).<br>
[1098]	CS_NS are decremented if the above conditions are not<br>
satisfied.<br>
[1099]	The pre-detemiined value FL_SINR_Th is selected so that<br>
re-pointing to another sector results in em increase in forward link SINR and, consequently, in an increase in an average requested data rate-<br>
[1100]	The pre-determined threshold RPCJTh is chosen so ttiat<br>
the AP's DRC is "in-lock" with a probability PJL when the filtered RFC mean is below the RPCJTh. The relationship between the probability PIL and the threshold is determined in accordance with simulations, laboratory tests, field trails, and other engineering methods. The RPCJTh is chosen to be conservative to minimize the cost associated with re-pointing the DRC to a sector with the DRC "out-of-lock".   If the AT did re-point to a sector with the<br><br>
DRC "out-of-lock" not only would the AT experience degraded throughput, but also a higher outage probability. The method can afford to select the RPC_Th conservatively because the monitoring credits are used to re-point to sectors with filtered RFC mean greater than the threshold but with DRC "in-lock". In one embodiment, the RPC„Th is chosen such that there is a less than 1% probability that the DRC is "out-of-lock" when the filtered RPC Mean is below the RPC„Th for any given channel conditions.<br>
[1101]	In one embodiment, the minimum value for the credits (both<br>
switching and monitoring) is zero and the maximum for the credits is equal to a soft hand-off delay or a softer handoff delay. The delay used is determined based on whether or not the non-serving sector is in the same cell as the serving sector. If the non-serving sector is in the same cell as the serving sector then the softer handoff delay is used, and if the non-serving sector is in a cell different from the one that the sen/ing sector is part of then the soft-handoff delay is used.<br>
[1102]	It is possible that a filtered RPC mean for the non-serving<br>
sector is above RPC_Th, and the DRC is "in-Iock" for the non-serving sector. Considering the rules for incrementing the switching credits, the switching credits will not be incremented, although a forward link SINR of the non-sen/ing sector is greater than a forward link SINR of the current serving sector by FL_SINR_Th. Consequently, a throughput of the system is not optimized. In such a scenario, the AT uses the monitoring credits to determine whether to monitor control channels of a non-serving sector to determine whether the DRC Lock for the non-sen/ing sector is "in-lock^. Therefore, the monitoring credits for a non-serving sector (CM.NS) are incremented if:<br>
[1103]	the fonward link SINR of tine non-serving sector (FL^NS) is<br>
greater than the forward link SINR of the current serving sector (FL_SS) by a FL.SINR JTh; and<br>
[1104]	the filtered RPC mean for the non-sen/ing sector (RL„NS)<br>
is above the RPC_Th; and<br>
[1105]	the filtered  RPC mean for the current sen/ing sector<br>
(RL^SS) is below the RPC.Th<br><br>
[1106]	CM_NS are decremented if the above conditions are not<br>
satisfied.<br>
[1107]	The credits, initialized to zero in the Initialization phase are<br>
accumulated during the Credit Accumulation phase. The credit accumulation phase in accordance with one embodiment is illustrated in FIG. 5. In step 502, a variable count is set to one. The method continues in step 504.<br>
[1108]	In step 504, the variable count is tested against an active<br>
set size. If the variable count is greater than the active set size, the method continues in decision phase, othenA^ise, the method continues in step 506.<br>
[1109]	In  step   506,   the   inquiry   is   made  whether  a  sector<br>
designated by the variable count is the current serving sector. If the test is positive, the method continues in step 518. othenwise, the method continues in step 508.<br>
[1110]	In step 508. a fonward link SINR of a sector designated by<br>
the variable count is compared against fonward link SINR of the cunrent sen/ing sector modified by the FL_SIMR«Th. If the fonward link SINR of the sector designated by the variable count is greater than the forward link SIIMR of the cun^ent serving sector modified by the FL_SlNR_Th, the method continues in step 510. otherwise, the method continues in st^ 51Z<br>
[1111]	In step 510, a reverse fink Stered RPC mean of ttie sector<br>
designated by the variable count s compared against the RPCJTh. If the reverse link filtered RPC mean of the sector designated by the variable count is greater than the RPCJTh, the method continues in step 511 otherwise, the method continues in step 516.<br>
[1112]	In step 511, a reverse link fittered RPC mean for the cunrent<br>
serving sector is compared against the RPCJTh. If the reverse link filtered RPC mean for the cunrent senang sector is greater than ttie RPCJTh, the method continues in step 512 otherwise, the method continues in step 514.<br>
[1113]	In step 512, values of CS.NS and CM_NS identified by the<br>
variable count are decremented by one, and set to the maximum of 0 and the decremented value. The mettiod continues in step 518.<br>
[1114]	In step 514, the values of CS^NS and CM.NS identified by<br>
the variable count are incremented by one, and set to the minimum of the soft<br><br>
(or softer) hand-off delay (NS_S_Th) and the incremented value. The method continues in step 518,<br>
[1115]	In step 516, the value of CS.NS identified by the variable<br>
count is incremented by one, and set to the minimum of the soft (or softer) hand-off delay (NS„S.Th) and the decremented value. The method continues in step 518.<br>
[1116]	In step 518, the variable count is incremented by one and<br>
the method returns to step 504.<br>
Decision<br>
[1117]	In one embodiment, the re-pointing decision rules depend<br>
on the DRC Lock Bit of the current serving sector. Consequently, referring to FIG. 6. in step 602. a DRC Lock Bit of the current serving sector is tested. If the DRC Lock Bit of the current serving sector is "out-of-lock." the method continues in step 604, othen^/ise. the method continues in step 606.<br>
[1118]	In step 604, the ""out-of-lock" server selection method is<br>
initialized. The method is described in detail with reference to FIG, 9. The method returns to the credit accumulation phase-<br>
[1119]	In  step  606,  the  "in-Iock^  server  selection   method   is<br>
initialized. The method is described in detail with reference to RGs, 7 and 8. The method returns to the credit accumulation phase.<br>
"In-Lock" Server Selection<br>
[1120]	If the DRC Lock Bit from the current serving sector is "in-<br>
lock", the decision to re-point to a non-sen/ing sector is made if the non-serving sector provides higher FL.SINR and an "in-lock* DRC Lock Bit To carry out the decision, the AT first ascertains if any of the non-serving sectors has switching credits greater than a threshold determined by ttie soft/softer delay. (This, threshold is the same for both the switching and monitoring credits.) If at least one of the non-serving sectors has switching credits greater than the threshold, the AT re-points its DRC to the sector with the highest switching credits. In one embodiment, if two or more non-serving sectors have equal switching credits, the sector with the highest quality reverse link is selected.<br><br>
The quality of the reverse link is determined in accordance with the filtered RPC mean. Lower filtered RPC mean indicates a better quality of the reverse link. In another embodiment, if two or more non-sen/ing sectors have equal switching credits, the sector with the highest quality forward link is selected.<br>
[1121]	If none of the non-serving sectors has sufficient switching<br>
credits to mandate re-pointing, the AT ascertains how many of the non-serving sectors have monitoring credits greater than the threshold. If at least one of the non-serving sectors has monitoring credits greater than the threshold, the AT monitors the control channel from those non-serving sectors during the next control channel cycle. In one embodiment, if two or more non-serving sectors have equal switching credits, a sector with the highest quality reverse link is selected for the monitoring. The quality of the reverse link is determined in accordance with the filtered RPC mean. In another embodiment, if two or more non-sen/ing sectors have equal switching credits, a sector with the highest quality fonA/ard link is selected for the monitoring. If the DRC for the monitored sector is "in-lock," the AT re-points to the nrK3nitored sector. Following the re-pointing the AT resets air the switching and monitoring credits.<br>
[1122]	If none of the non-serving sectors has either sufficient<br>
switching credits or monitoring credits, the AT continues pointing its DRC to the current serving Access Point<br>
[1123]	The decision phase ki accordance with one emtxxliment is<br>
illustrated in RGs. 7 and 8. In accordance with RG. 7, a non-serving sector is made a candidate for re-pointing if the non-serving sectof's switching credits are equal to the soft (or softer) hand-off delay (NS_SJTh) for the non-sen/ing sector. A non-serving sector is made a candidate for a control channel monitoring if the non-serving sector's monitoring credits are equal to the soft (or softer) hand-off delay (NS^SJTh) for ttie non-serving sector and the filtered RPC mean of the non-serving sector is above RPCJTh. This ensures that the AT is in reliable communication with the cunrent serving sector when it attempts to demodulate the synchronous control channel from a non-serving sector.

[1124]	Furthermore, in one embodiment, a data packet may span<br>

Consequently, the AT further determines whether there is a potential for a collision between the data on the control channel to be monitored and the data form the current sen/ing sector, if the AT determines that the data transmission from the current serving sector for would collide with the transmission of the control channel from the non serving sector to be monitored, then the AT does not monitor the control channel from the non-serving sector.

the decision to re-point to a non-serving sector is made if the non-serving sector provides higher FL^SINR and better quality reverse link, as determined by the switching credits. To carry out the decision, the AT first ascertains those non-sen/ing sectors that have switching credits greater than zero. If at least one of the non-serving sectors has switching credits greater than zero, the AT re-points the DRC to the sector with the highest switching credits. In one embodiment, if two or more non-sen/ing sectors have equal switching credits, a sector with the highest quality reverse link is selected. The quality of the reverse link is determined in accordance with the reverse link's filtered RPC mean. In another embodiment, if two or more non-serving sectors have equal switching credits, a sector with the highest quality fonA^ard link is selected.<br>

greater than zero, the AT ascertains those non-serving sectors that have monitoring credits greater than zero. If at least one of the non-serving sectors has monitoring credits greater than zero, the AT monitors the sector with the highest monitoring credits. In one embodiment, if two or more non-serving sectors have equal monitoring credits, the sector with the highest quality reverse link is selected for the monitoring. The quality of the reverse link is detemiined in accordance with the filtered RPC mean. In another embodiment, if two or more non-serving sectors have equal monitoring credits, the sector with the highest quality forward link is selected for the monitoring.

[1183]	In step 942, the AT makes the decision not to re-point to a<br>
different sector. The metiiod returns to credit accumulation.<br>
Access Terminal Processing<br>
[1184]	In another embodiment, the AT is assumed to be able to<br>
demodulate a control channel from each sector in the ATs active set. The processing method at the AT in accordance with the embodiment comprises the phases of (i) Initialization, (ii) Credit Accumulation, and (iii) Decision,<br><br>
[1185]	During the initialization stage, the AT 104 selects the AP<br>
with the best fonward link quality metric, i.e., the highest SINR. The AT 104 sets the DRC "in-lock." for the selected AP. The AT 104 then initializes credits for all non-serving sector s to zero.<br>
[1186]	Because the AT is able to demodulate a control channel<br>
from each sector in the ATs active set. thus determine the DRC Lock Bit value, there is no need for monitoring credits and only switching credits are defined. The switching credits are described in more details in the Credit Accumulation paragraph. Consequently, the initialization phase in accordance with the embodiment is carried out according to FIG. 4 and accompanying text, except for step 412. In step 412. only the switching credits for a non-serving sector (CS^NS) are set to zero.<br>
Credit Accumulation<br>
[1187]	As   discussed,  only   switching  credits   are   required   in<br>
accordance with the embodiment. Switching credits are used to qualify the non-serving sector for re-pointing, if the DRC of the non-serving sector is '*in lock". Consequently. CS_NS are incremented if:<br>
[1188]	a fooA/ard Rnk SINR of the non-serving sector (FL_NS) is<br>
greater than a fonward link SINR of the current servmg sector by a pre-detennined value (FL.SINR JTh); and<br>
[1189]	a DRC Lock Bit of the non-serving sector is "in-lock."<br>
[1190]	The pre-determined value FL.SINR.Th is selected so that<br>
re-potnting to a new sector result in an increase k\ fonfvard link SINR and, consequently, in an increase in an average requested data rate. CS.NS are decremented if the above conditions are not satisfied.<br>
[1191]	In one embodiment, the switching credits minimum value is<br>
zero and the maximum value Is equal to a soft hand-off delay if re-pointing to the particular sector would constitute a soft hand-off, or a softer handoff delay if re-pointing to the particular AP would constitute a softer hand-off.<br>
[1192]	The credits, initialized to zero in the Initialization phase are<br>
accumulated during the Credit Accumulation phase.  The credit accumulation<br><br>
phase in accordance with one embodiment is illustrated in FIG. 10. in step 1002, a variable count is set to one. The method continues in step 1004.<br>
[1193]	In step 1004, the variable count is tested against an active<br>
set size. If the variable count is greater than the active set size, the method continues in decision phase, othenA/ise, the method continues in step 1006,<br>
[1194]	In step 1006, the inquiry is made whether the sector<br>
designated by the variable count is the current serving sector. If the test is positive, the method continues in step 1016, othenwise. the method continues in step 1008.<br>
[1195]	In step 1008. a fonA/ard link SINR of the sector designated<br>
by the variable count is compared against fonA/ard link SINR of the current serving sector modified by the FL.SINR.Th. If the fonA^ard link SINR of the sector designated by the variable count is greater than the forward link SINR of the current sen/ing sector modified by the FL_SINR_Th. the method continues in step 1010, othenwise, the method continues in step 1012-<br>
[1196]	In step 1010. a DRC Lock Bit of the sector designated by<br>
the variable count is compared against one. If the DRC Lock Bit of the sector designated by the variable count is equal to one. the method continues in step 1014, otherwise, the method continues in step 1012.<br>
[1197]	In step 1012. the value of CS_NS identified by the variable<br>
count are decremented by one, and set to the maximum of 0 and the decremented value. The method continues in step 1016.<br>
[1198]	In step 1014, the value of CS^NS klentified by the variable<br>
count are incremented by one, and set to the minimum of the soft (or softer) hand-off delay and the incremented value. The method continues in step 1016.<br>
[1199]	In step 1016, the variable count is incremented by one and<br>
the method returns to step 1004.<br>
Decision<br>
[1200]	In   accordance  with   the   embodiment,   the   re-pointing<br>
decision rules depend on the DRC Lock State of the current serving sector. Consequently, the decision phase in accordance with the embodiment is carried out according to FIG. 6 and accompanying text.<br><br>
"In-Lock" AP Selection<br>
[1201]	If the DRC from the current serving sector is "in-lock", the<br>
decision to re-point to a non-serving sector is made if the non-serving sector provides higher FL^StNR and an "in-iock" DRC. To carry out the decision, the AT first ascertains if any of the non-serving sectors has switching credits greater than a threshold determined by the soft/softer delay. If at least one of the non-serving sectors has switching credits greater than the threshold, the AT re-points its DRC to the AP with the highest switching credits. In one embodiment, if two or more non-sen/ing sectors have equal switching credits, a sector with the highest quality reverse link is selected. The quality of the reverse link is detennined in accordance with the filtered RFC mean. In another embodiment, if two or more non-serving sectors have equal switching credits, a sector with the highest quality fooA^ard link is selected.<br>
(1202]	To avoid limiting the re-pointing rate to a control channel<br>
inten/al (256 time-time-slots for IS-856), a non-sen/ing sector is further made a candidate for re-pointing between control channel intervals according to the foik&gt;wing rules:<br>
[1203]	the number of time-slots since the last control channel (CC)<br>
exceeds a threshold Nc; and<br>
(1204]	ttie filtered RPC mean for the fKXvsennng sector (RL.NS)<br>
is less than the RPC.TTi,<br>
[1205]	The RPCJTb is chosen such that the DRC for the non-<br>
serving sector is •in-k)ck' witfi a probability Pa. if the filtered RPC mean is below RPC_Th- In one embodiment, the Nc is equal to 64.<br>
[1206]	If none of the non-serving sectors has sufficient switching<br>
credits, frje AT continues pointing its DRC to the current sennng sector. On re-pointing the DRC the AT resets all the svwtching credits.<br>
[1207]	The candidate determination   in  accordance with the<br>
embodiment is illustrated in FIG. 11. In step 1102, a variable count is set to one. The method continues in step 1104.<br>
[1208]	In step 1104, the variable count is tested against an active<br>
set size.  If the variable count is greater than the active set size, the method<br><br>
continues in sen/er selection as described below, otheoA/ise, the method continues in step 1106.<br>
[1209]	In step  1106,  an inquiry is  made whether the sector<br>
designated by the variable count is the current serving sector. If the test is positive, the method continues in step 1118, othen^/ise, the method continues in step 1108.<br>
[1210]	In step 1108, a value of the variable CS_NS identified by<br>
the variable count is compared against the soft (or softer) hand-off delay {NS_S_Th) for the non-serving sector. If the value of the variable CS_NS is not equal to the NS„S_Th for the non-serving sector, the method continues in step 1110; otherwise, the method continues in step 1112.<br>
[1211]	In step 1110, a value of the variable identifying the number<br>
of time-slots since the last control channel (CC) is compared against the Nc- If the CC is greater than the N^ the method continues in step 1114; othenwise, the method continues in step 1116.<br>
[1212]	In step 1112, a value of the variable Cand_S identified by<br>
the variable count is set to zero. The method continues in step 1118.<br>
[1213]	In step 1114, a futered RPC mean of the non-sennng sector<br>
(RL_NS) identified by the variable count is compared against an RPC threshold (RPC.Th). If the RL^NS Is greater than the RPC_Th, the method continues in step 1112; othenwise. the method continues in step 1116.<br>
[1214]	In step 1116, a vaiue of the variable Cand.S identified by<br>
the variable count is set to one. The method continues in step 1118-<br>
[1215]	In step 1118, the variable count is incremented, and the<br>
method returns to step 1104.<br>
[1216]	In accordance with the decision rules, the AT ascertains<br>
which sectors are candidates for re-pointing, and cam'es out the re-pointing decision. The decision phase in accordance with the embodiment is earned out according to RG. 9 and accompanying text, with the following modifications. Because the embodiment does not use the monitoring credits, steps 922 through 946 are deleted. Consequently, in step 914, if the value of the variable CS_NS_count is equal to zero, the method continues pointing to the current serving Access Point, and then returns to the Credit Accumulation phase.<br><br>
"Out-of-Lock" AP Selection<br>
[1217]	If the DRC from the current serving sector is 'out-of-lock"<br>
the decision to re-point to a non-serving sector is made if the non-serving sector provides higher FL_SINR and better quality reverse link, as determined by the switching credits. To carry out the decision, the AT first ascertains those non-serving sectors that have switching credits greater than zero. If at least one of the non-sen/ing sectors has switching credits greater than zero, the AT re-points its DRC to the sector with the highest switching credits. In one embodiment, if two or more non-serving sectors have equal switching credits, a sector with the highest quality reverse link is selected. The quality of the reverse link is determined in accordance with the reverse link's filtered RPC mean. In another embodiment, if two ore more non-serving sectors have equal switching credits, a sector with the highest quality fonward link is selected.<br>
[1218]	If none of the non-serving sectors has sufficient switching<br>
credits, the AT continues pointing its DRC to the current serving Acxess Point.<br>
[1219]	Tne decision phase in accordance with the embodiment is<br>
earned out according to RG. 9 and accompanying text, with the following modincations. Because the embodiment does not use the monitoring credits, steps 922 through 946 are deleted. Consequently, in step 914, if the value of the variable CS^NSjcount is equal to zero, the method continues pointing to the current serving Access Point, and then returns to the Credit Accumulation phase.<br>
Further Extension<br>
[1220]	One  skilled  in  the  art  recognizes  that the  concepts<br>
explained in the two above-described embodiments can be utilized to devise a hybrid method. In which the AT woukj be able to demodulate a control channel<br>

[1227]	In step 1222, a test whether a sector identified by the<br>
variable count was selected for demodulating is performed. If the test is negative, the method continues in step 1224, otherwise the method continues in step 1226.<br>
[1228]	In step 1224, a reverse link filtered RPC mean of the sector<br>
designated by the variable count is compared against the RPC_Th- If the reverse link filtered RPC mean of the sector designated by the variable count is greater than the RPC_Th, the method continues in step 1225 otherwise, the method continues in step 1232.<br>
[1229]	In step 1225, a reverse link filtered RPC mean for the<br>
current serving sector is compared against the RPC_Th,   If the reverse link<br><br>
filtered RPC mean for the current serving sector is greater than the RPC_Th, the method continues in step 1228 othenwise, the method continues in step 1230.<br>
[1230]	In step 1226, a DRC Loclc of the sector identified by the<br>
variable count is compared to one. If the DRC Lock of the sector identified by the variable count is equal to one, the method continues in step 1232, othenwise the method continues in step 1234,<br>
[1231]	In step 1228, values of CS^NS and CM.NS identified by<br>
the variable count are decremented by one, and set to the maximum of 0 and the decremented value. The method continues in step 1236.<br>
[1232]	In step 1230. the values of CS^NS and CM^NS identified<br>
by the variable count are incremented by one, and set to the minimum of the soft (or softer) hand-off delay (NS_S_Th) and the incremented value. The method continues in step 1236,<br>
[1233]	In step 1232, the value of CM^NS identified by the variable<br>
count is incremented by one, and set to the minimum of the soft (or softer) hand-off delay (NS.S«Th) and the decremented value. The method continues in step 1236.<br>
[1234]	In step 1234, the value of CS.NS identified by the variable<br>
count is decremented by one. arKJ set to the maximum of 0 and the decremented value. The method continues in step 1236.<br>
[1235]	In step 1236, the variable count is incremented by one and<br>
the method returns to step 1214.<br>
Re-pointing using a Punctured DRC Lock<br>
[1236]	Depending on an implementation of a communication<br>
system, a performance of the re-pointing mettiod using a DRC Lock for indication of a reverse link condition may suffer due to the delay in the feedback loop. The update rate of the feedback loop may be too slow in handling sudden changes in reverse link quality. Such performance detriment may result in outages, which may be intolerable in certain application, e.g., real-time applications.<br><br>
[1237]	Therefore, in other embodiment,  the DRC  Lock Bit is<br>
updated at a higher rate and punctured into an RPC channel one or more times every frame. The term punctured is used herein to mean sending the DRC Lock Bit instead of a RPC bit. The DRC Lock Bit is sent by all the AP's in the AT 104 active set. In one embodiment, a transmission of the DRC Lock Bit to each AT is staggered; i.e. referenced off a frame offset assigned to the AT. This allows for allocating additional power to the RPC channel during the transmission of the DRC Lock Bit in order to provide an additional margin to reduce the DRC Lock Bit errors at the AT; therefore, preventing an erroneous handoffs and possible loss in fooA^ard link throughput. The AT 104 uses the DRC Lock Bit information to select the serving AP.<br>
Access Point Processing<br>
[1238]	The   method   in  accordance   with   one   embodiment  is<br>
illustrated in RG. 13, The method starts in step 1302. The method continues in step 1304.<br>
[1239]	In step 1304, the AP receives an updated DRC.    The<br>
method continues in step 1306.<br>
[1240]	In step 1306, the AP tests the received DRC.   If the DRC<br>
was erased, the metiiod continues in step 1308, otherwise, the method continues in step 1310,<br>
[1241]	In step 1308, the DRC erasure is assigned a value of 1.<br>
Tne method continues in step 1312.<br>
[1242]	In step 1310, the DRC erasure is assigned a value of 0.<br>
The method continues in step 1312.<br>
[1243]	In step 1312, the DRC Erasure Bit is processed to generate<br>
a DRC erasure rate. In one embodiment, the processing comprises filtering by<br>
a filter wth a pre-detennined time constant   In one embodiment, the filter is<br>
realized in a digital domain.  The value of the pre-determined time constant is<br>
established in accordance with system simulation, by experiment or other<br>
engineering methods known to one of ordinary skills in the art as an optimum in<br>
accordance with:<br>
[1244]	reliability of an estimate ensuing from a choice of the-time<br>
constant, and<br><br>
[1245]	latency of an estimate ensuing from a choice of the time<br>
constant.<br>
[1246]	In one embodiment, pre-determined time constant is 64<br>
time-slots. The method continues in step 1314.<br>
[1247]	In step 1314. the system time is tested to establish whether<br>
the DRC Lock Bit is to be punctured into the RPC sub channel    In one<br>
embodiment, illustrated in step 1314, the DRC Lock Bit is punctured into the<br>
RPC sub channel each eighth (mod 8) time instance.   Because the aim of<br>
selecting the time instance is to achieve a pre determined bit error rate, one of<br>
ordinary skills in the art recognizes that other time instances can be selected.<br>
The  values  of  the  time  instance  is  selected  to  optimize the following<br>
requirements;<br>
[1248]	Minimize the degradation of the reverse link resulting form<br>
loss of RPC bits due to puncturing; and<br>
[1249]	Providing the DRC Lock Bit at optimal spacing.<br>
[1250]	If the test is positive, the method continues in step 1330,<br>
othenA/ise the method continues in step 1316,<br>
[1251]	In step 1316, the syst^n time is tested to establish whether<br>
the ORG Lock Bit is to be updated- The time instarxre for the update is selected to ensure refiat}ie delivery of the DRC Lock Bit In one embodiment, iftustrated in step 1316, the DRC. Lock Bit is updated every sixty-fourth (mod 64) time instance. If the test is positive, the metfiod continues in step 1318, otherwise the method returns to step 1304.<br>
[1252]	Steps 1318 through 1328, introduce hysteresis rules for<br>
generating the DRC Lock Bit The hysteresis is introduced to avoid rapid re-pointing when the channel SINR varies rapidly. The hysteresis rules are as follows:<br>
[1253]	If the DRC Lock Bit is cunrently set to one, then the filtereci<br>
DRC erasure rate must exceed first DRC erasure threshold {DRC_Erasure_Th2) for the DRC Lock Bit to be set to zero; and<br>
[X 254]	If the DRC Lock Bit is currently set to zero, then the Filterec<br>
DRC Erasure rate has to be below a second pre-determined DRC erasure threshold (DRC_Erasure_Th1) for the DRC Lock to be set to one.<br><br>
f1255J	In one embodiment, the values DRC_Erasure_Th1  and<br>
DRC„Erasure„Th2 are pre-determined in accordance with the communication<br>
system simulation, by experiment or other engineering methods known to one of<br>
ordinary skills in the art. In another embodiment, the values DRC_Erasure„Th1<br>
and DRC_Erasure_Th2 are changed in accordance with the change of the<br>
conditions of the communication link.    In either embodiment, the values of<br>
DRC_Erasure__Th1   and   DRC_Erasure_Th2   are   selected   to  optimize   the<br>
following requirements:<br>
[1256]	Minimize the dead-zone (when the DRC Lock Bit is not<br>
updated); and<br>
(1257]	transmit   the   most   current   reverse   fink  channel   state<br>
information to the AT.<br>
[1258]	In step 1318, the DRC Lock Bit value is compared to 1.   If<br>
the DRC Lock Bit value equals 1, the method continues in step 1322, othen/vise, the method continues in step 1320.<br>
[1259]	In step 1320, the DRC erasure rate is compared to the<br>
DRC_Erasure_Th1. U the DRC erasure rate ss greater than the DRG_Erasurejrh1, the method continues in step 1324, othenA/ise, the method continues in step 1326,<br>
[1260]	In step 1322, the DRC erasure rate is compared to the<br>
DRC_Erasure_Th2. If the DRC erasure rate is less than the DRC_Erasure_Th2, the method continues in sep 1326, otfienA^ise, the method continues in step 1328.<br>
[1261]	In step 1324, the DRC Lock Bit value is set to 0.   The<br>
method continues in step 1330.<br>
[1262]	In step 1326. the DRC Lock Bit value is set to 1.   The<br>
method continues in step 1330.<br>
[1263]	In step 1328, the DRC Lock Bit value is set to 0.   The<br>
method continues in step 1330.<br>
[1264]	In step 1330, the DRC Lock Bit is punctured into the RFC<br>
channel in accordance with the timing signal obtained in step 1314. The method returns to step 1304,<br>
Access Terminal Processing<br><br>
[1265]	The AT 104 receives and demodulates the RPC channel<br>
from all APs in the AT 104 active set. Consequently, the AT 104 recovers the DRC Lock Bits punctured into the RPC channel for every AP in the AT 104 active set. Furthermore, as discussed, the punctured DRC Lock Bits are updated with a higher frequency than the Message Based DRC Lock Bits, Consequently, in a Demodulation phase, the AT 104 can combine the energy of received DRC Lock Bits during one update interval, and comparing the combined DRC Lock Bits energy against a DRC Lock Bit threshold. If the combined DRC Lock Bit energy is greater than the DRC Lock Bit threshold, the AT 104 declares the DRC Lock Bit from the particular AP "in-lock". In the Decision phase, the AT 104 uses the DRC Lock Bit value to make a re-pointing decision.<br>
Demodulation Phase<br>
[1266]	The   Demodulation   phase    in   accordance   with   one<br>
embodiment is illustrated in FIG. 14. The method starts in step 1402, and continues in step 1404.<br>
[1267]	In step 1404, the system time is tested to establish whether<br>
the DRC Lock Bit was updated. In one emtDodiment, illustrated in step 1404, tf&gt;e DRC Lock Bit is updated every sixty-fourth (rrxxj 64) time instance. This time instarKe con^sponds to the update rate at the AP. If the test is positive, the method continues in step 1410. othenAflse the method returns to step 1406.<br>
[1268]	In step 1406, the system time is tested to establish whether<br>
the DRC Lock Bit was punctured into the RPC sub channel. In one embodiment, illustrated in step 1404, the DRC Lock Bit is punctured into the RPC sub channel each eighth (mod 8) time instance. This time instance conresponds to the puncture rate at the AP. If the test is positive, the method contirujes tn step 1408, othenvise the method returns to step 1404.<br>
[1269]	In step 1408, the punctured DRC Lock Bit is recovered from<br>
the RPC channel and the energy of the DRC Lock Bit is combined with the energy of DRC Lock Bits from the same update interval. The method retums to step 1406.<br><br>
[1270]	In step 1410, the combined DRC Lock Bit energy is tested<br>
against a DRC Lock Bit threshold (DRC_LB_TH). If the test is positive, the method continues in step 1412, otherwise the method returns to step 1414.<br>
[1271]	In step 1412. the DRC Lock Bit value is set to 1.   The<br>
method continues in step 1416.<br>
[1272]	In step 1414, the DRC Lock Bit value is set to 0.   The<br>
method continues in step 1416.<br>
[1273]	In step 1416, the variable containing the combined DRC<br>
Lock Bit energy is set to zero for the next update.<br>
Decision Phase<br>
[1274]	The AT uses the DRC Lock Bit value obtainer in the<br>
Demodulation phase to make a decision with respect to a re-pointing. In one embodiment, the decision phase comprises (i) Accreditation phase, (ii) Certification phase, and (iii) Decision phase. The respective phases are described below.<br>
Accreditation Phase<br>
[1275]	In the accreditation phase, the forward link SINR of the<br>
non-serving sectors (FL_NS) are compared to the forward link SINR of the current serving sector modified by a pre-detemnined hysteresis margin {FL_HYST). If the fonArand link SINR of the non-sen/ing sector is greater than the forward link SINR of the serving sector modified by a pre-detemiined hysteresis margin, then the temporary credits {TEMP.CREDIT) associated with that non-serving sector are incremented; otherwise, the temporary credits associated with that non- serving sector are decremented.<br>
[1276]	The   Accreditation   phase    in   accordance   with   one<br>
embodiment is illustrated in RG. 15. The method starts in step 1502. The method continues in step 1504.<br>
[1277]	In step 1504, a variable count is set to zero. The method<br>
continues in step 1506.<br>
[1278]	In step 1506, the variable count is tested against an active<br>
set size.   If the variable count is greater than the active set size, the method<br><br>
continues in the Certification phase, othenwise, the method continues in step 1508.<br>
*<br>
[1279]	In step 1508. an inquiry is made whether the fonA/ard link<br>
SINR of the sector designated by the variable count is greater than the fooA/ard link SINR of the current sen/ing sector modified by a pre-determined hysteresis margin. If the test is positive, the method continues in step 1512. othenwise, the method continues in step 1510-<br>
[1280]	In step 1510, the temporary credits for the sector identified<br>
by the variable count are decreased by one- The method continues in step 1514.<br>
[1281]	In step 1512. the temporary credits for the sector identified<br>
by the variable count are increased by one. The method continues in step 1514.<br>
[1282]	In step 1514, the variable count is increased by one. The<br>
method retums to step 1506.<br>
Certification Phase<br>
[1283]	In the certification phase, the credits of the sectors are<br>
certified. The temn certificatjon as used herein means a dedsion, which sectors* credits (CREDITS) will t&gt;e increased t?y the temporary credits accumulated by the sector during the accreditation phase. In one embodiment, the certification decision is made in accordance with tiie following rules:<br>
If the DRC Lock Bit of the current serving sector is "in-lock", and if the DRC Lock Bit on a non-serving sector is "in-lock," then the credits of the non-serving sector are incremented by the DRC Lock Interval. The tenn DRC Lock interveil as used herein means a numtser of time-slots over which the DRC Lock Indication has been sent;<br>
If the DRC Lock Bit of the current serving sector is "out-of-lock^, and if the DRC Lock Bit on a non-sen/ing sector is "in-lock" then the credits of the non-serving sector are - Incremented by the number of accumulated temporary credits;<br>
nthArwL
 <br>
[1284]	The    Certification    phase    in    accordance    with    one<br>
embodiment is illustrated in FIG. 16- The method starts in step 1602, in which a variable count is set to zero. The method continues in step 1604.<br>
[1285]	In step 1604, the variable count is tested against an active<br>
set size. If the variable count is greater than the active set size, the method continues in the Decision phase, otherwise, the method continues in step 1606,<br>
[1286]	In step 1606, the DRC^LOCK of the sen/ing sector is<br>
compared to 1. If the DROPLOCK is equal to 1, the method continues in step 1610; otheoA/ise, the method continues in step 1608.<br>
[1287]	In step 1608, the DRC^LOCK of the non-serving sector<br>
identified by the variable count is compared to 1, If the DRC_LOCK is equal to 1. the method continues in step 1612; othen/vise, the method continues in step 1610.<br>
[1288]	In step 1612, the credits of the non-sen/ing sector identified<br>
by the variable count is set to the value of temporary credits.<br>
[1289]	In step 1614, the credits of the non-sen/ing sector identified<br>
by the variable count is set to 0.<br>
[1290]	In step 1610, the DROPLOCK of the non-serving sector<br>
identified by the variable count is compared to 1. If the DRC_LOCK is equal to 1, the f7&gt;ethod continues in step 1616; otherwise, the method continues in step 1614.<br>
[1291]	In step 1616, the credits of the non-serving sector identified<br>
by the variable count is set to the value of DRC Lock Update Inten/al.<br>
[1292]	In step 1618. the variable count is increased by one. The<br>
method returns to step 1606.<br>
Decision Phase<br>
[1293]	In the decision phase, the AT makes a re-pointing decision<br>
in accordance with the certified credits. In one embodiment, the AT determines the non-sen/ing sectors the certified credits of which is greater than or equal to the soft/softer hand-off delay of the sector. The AT then re-points to the one of the determined sectors that has the highest credits.   If multiple sectors have<br><br>
equal credits then the AT repoints the DRC to the sector with the best forward link.<br>
[1294]	The Decision phase in accordance with one embodiment is<br>
illustrated in FIG. 17. The method starts in step 1702, in which a variable count is set to zero. The method continues in step 1704.<br>
[1295]	In step 1704, the variable count is tested against an active<br>
set size. If the variable count is greater than the active set size, the method continues in step 1716, othenwise. the method continues in step 1706.<br>
[1296]	In step 1706. the temporary credits of the sector identified<br>
by the variable count is compared to the soft (or softer) hand-off delay for the non-sen/ing sector (NS.S.Th) identified by the variable count. If the credits are less that the soft (or softer) hand-off delay for the non-serving sector (NS_S_Th) identified by the variable count, the method continues In step 1710; othenwise, the method continues in step 1712.<br>
[1297]	In step 1710, the re-pointing flag is set to zero. The method<br>
continues in step 1714.<br>
[1298]	In step 1712, the re-pointing flag is set to one. The method<br>
continues in step 1714.<br>
[1299]	In step 1714, the variable count is incremented.    The<br>
method retums to step 1704.<br>
[1300]	In step 1716, the sectors with a re-pointing flag set to 1 are<br>
sorted in accordance to the sectors' accumulated credits. The method continues in step 1718.<br>
[1301]	In step 1718, a test is made whether two or more sectors<br>
have equal value of the accumulated credits. If the test is positive, the method continues in step 1720. otherwise the method continues in step 1722.<br>
[1302]	In step 1720, the AT re-points to the sector with the<br>
greatest value of a foiward link SINR. The method continues in step 1724.<br>
[1303]	In step 1722, the AT re-points to the sector with the<br>
greatest value of the accumulated credit. The method continues in step 1724.<br>
[1304]	in step 1724, the accumulated credits of all sectors are<br>
initialized to zero. The method retums to tiie Demodulation phase.<br><br>
Re-pointing Using Only Forward Link<br>
[1305]	In all previously descrfbed embodiments, the re-pointing<br>
decision was made by the AT 104 in accordance with a condition of both a foHA/ard and a reverse links. As discussed, the AT 104 can also make the re-pointing decision in accordance with a condition of a forward link or a condition on a reverse link. In accordance with another embodiment, the AT 104 makes the re-poinling decision in accordance with a condition of a forward link only. Because no feedback from a sector to an AT is provided, ail processing is carried out at the AT,<br>
Access Terminal Processing<br>
[1306]	The processing method at the AT in accordance with the<br>
embodiment comprises the phases of (i) Initialization, (») Credit Accumulation, and (iii) Decision, as described in reference to paragraph 1.2, and associated RGs, modified as follows.<br>
Initsarizatjon<br>
[1307]	During the initialization stage, the AT 104 selects a sector<br>
with the best fonvard link quality metric, i.e., the highest SJNR as the sennng sector. TnB AT 104 sets the DRC for the selected sector ^in-lock" and initializes credits for all non-sennng sectors to zero.<br>
[1308]	In one embodiment, only one type of credits - switching<br>
credits - are defined. Consequently, FIG- 4, and the accompanying text only the switching credits are initialized to zero )n step 412-<br>
Credit Accumulation<br>
[1309]	The switching credits are used to qualify a non-sennng<br>
sector for re-pointing. The switching credits (CS_NS) are incremented if a forward link SJNR of the non-serving sector (FL_NS) is greater than a forward link SINR of the current sending sector (FL.SS) modified by a pre-detenrtined value (FL_SINR_Th). The CS^NS are decremented if the above condition is not satisfied.<br><br>
[1310]	The pre-determined value FL_SINR_Th is selected so that<br>
re-pointing to another sector results in an increase in forward link SINR and, consequently, in an increase in an average requested data rate.<br>
[1311]	In one ennbodiment, the minimum value for the credits is<br>
zero and the maximum for the credits is equal to a soft hand-off delay or a softer handoff delay. The delay used is determined based on whether or not the non-serving sector is in the same ceil as the serving sector. If the non-serving sector is in the same cell as the serving sector then the softer handoff delay is used, and if the non-serving sector is in a cell different from the one that the serving sector is part of then the soft-handoff delay is used.<br>
[1312]	The credits, initialized to zero in the Initialization phase are<br>
« accumulated during the Credit Accumulation phase. Consequently, referring to<br>
FIG. 5, and the accompanying text, steps 510, 511, and 514 are deleted.<br>
Furthermore, step 508 is modified as follows;<br>
[1313]	In step 508, a fooNard link SINR of a sector designated by<br>
the variable count is compared against fonward link SINR of the current serving<br>
sector modified by the FL_SINR_Th.   If the fonward link SINR of the sector<br>
designated by the variable count is greater than the forward fink SINR of the<br>
current serving sector modified by the FL_SINR_Th, the method continues in<br>
step 516, otherwise, the method continues in step 512.<br>
Oecision<br>
[1314]	Because no feedback information about the reverse link is<br>
presented to the AT, the sector selection is carried out in accordance with the switching credits,<br>
[1315]	To carry out the decision, the AT first ascertains if any of<br>
the non-serving sectors has switching credits greater than a threshold detennined by the soft/softer delay (NS.SJTh) for the non-serving sector. (This, threshold is the same for both the switching and monitoring credits.) If at least one of the non-serving sectors has switching credits greater than the threshold, the AT re-points its DRC to the sector with the highest switching credits. If two or more non-sen^ng sectors have equal switching credits, the sector with the highest cunrent quality fooNard link is selected.<br><br>
[1316]	If none of the non-serving sectors has sufficient switching<br>
credits to mandate re-pointing, the AT continues pointing its DRC to the current serving Access Point.<br>
[1317]	The decision phase in accordance with one embodiment is<br>
illustrated in reference to FIGs. 7 and 8, and accompanying text In reference with FIG. 7. steps 714 through 722 are deleted. Steps 710 and 712 are modified as follows:<br>
[1318]	In step 710, a value of the variable Cand_S identified by the<br>
variable count is set to 0. The method continues in step 724.<br>
[1319]	In step 712, a value of the variable Cand^S identified by the<br>
variable count is set to 1. The method continues in step 724.<br>
[13201	Referring to FIG.  8. the sector selection from FIG. 7<br>
continues. In reference with FIG. 8. steps 822 through 838, and 842 through 846 are deleted. Steps 814, 818, and 820 are modified as follows:<br>
[1321]	In step 814. the value of the variable CS_NS_count is<br>
ascertained. If the value of the variable CS_NS_count is equal to 1, the method continues in step 816. If the value of the variable CS_NS_count is greater that 1, the method continues in step 818. Otherwise, the method continues in step 840.<br>
[1322]	In step 818. the AT re-points the DRC to the candidate<br>
sector identified by the variable count that has the highest quality forward link. The method continues in step 820.<br>
[1323]	In step 820. the variable CS_NS is set to zero. The method<br>
returns to the credit accumulation phase.<br>
