USA, 78, 5435-5439, (1981); Dworkin-Rastl E, et aL J. Interferon Research, 2, 575-585, (1982)].<br>
During the last three decades several genes encoding IFN alpha subtypes have been<br>
30     identified [Goeddel D.V., et al Nature 290:20-26 (1981); Valenzuela D., et al Nature 313:698-700<br>
(1985); Langer J.A., and Pestka S., J. Invest. Dermatol. 83, 128-136s, (1984)]. There are four main<br>
,    subtypes of interferon's, among which alpha or leukocyte interferon's are more common. These are<br>
also called as Type I interferon and are distinctly smaller in size, stable upto pH 2 and are<br>
glycoproteins. The major subtype gene of IFN alpha 2, is further subdivided into three classes<br>
35 which have been identified as (alpha 2a, alpha 2b, and alpha 2c). Generally in humans IFN alpha 2b is expressed more frequently. Currently the list of IFN subtypes includes nearly 20 genes, namely JFN-alpha la, -alpha lb, -alpha 4a, -alpha 4b, -alpha 5, -alpha 6 etc  [Streuli M., et al,<br><br>
2<br><br><br>

PCT/IN2002/000216<br><br>
Science, 209: 1343-7 (1980); Emanuel S.L., and Pestka, S., J. Biol. Chem., 268:12565-12569, (1993); Hosoi H., et aL International Society for Study of the Liver, Brighton, UK, 3-6th Jun., 113, Abstract, (1992); Desai M, et al, J. Interferon Res., 12: S138, (1992); Adolf G.R., et al, Biochem. J, 276:511-518, (1991)]. These subtypes are known to differ in their biological activities such as 5 antiviral, anti-cell proliferation and NK-activation [Hu R., et al, J. Biol. Chem, 268: 12591-5, (1993)]. Relatively few protein-engineered variants of interferon have been reported [Sen G., et al, J. Virol., 50(2):445-450, (1984); Jones G., et al. Cancer, 57:1709-1715, (1986); Klingemann H.G., et al, Blood, 78(12):3306-3311, (1991)]. The amino acid sequence of human interferon alpha 2b has been reported [Lin L., et al J. Gen. Virol., 39:125-130, (1978)] and the crystal structures of<br>
10 human Leukocyte Interferon subtypes have also been reported [Rang H.F., et al US Pat. No. 4,672,108, (1987)]. The biological actions reported for these proteins include antiviral, anti¬proliferative and immunomodulatory properties [Baron S., et al., editors, The Interferon System: A Review to 1982-Part I and Part IL University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, 41 (1982); Baron S., et al, eds, Interferon: Principles and Medical Applications, The University of Texas<br>
15 Medical Branch at Galveston, Galvestan, 624 (1992); Pestka S., et al, Annu. Rev. Biochem. 56, 727-777, (1987)]. The example of various viral infections which may be treated using interferon include, but are not limited to: herpes simplex keratitis, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, variacella zoster, cytomegalovirus infection, respiratory infections; including its uses in the treatment of genital warts [Bones R., Atkinson G., WO 98/23285, (1998).], hepatitis B [Gewert D.,<br>
20 Salom C, et al, J Interferon Res., 13 (3), 227-231, (1993)] and psoriasis [Meritet J, et al, WO 01/42301, (2001)]. Other infections wherein treatment of interferon has been found to be useful include bacterial infections [ubin D., US 4,762,705, (1988); Cummins J., et al US 5,830,456, (1988).<br>
Type I interferon's are reported to be useful in treating cancers [Tanner D., et al US<br>
25 5,028,422, (1991); Tanner D., et al, US 5,256,410, (1993); Del B., US 5,024,833, (1991); Wadler S, et al. US 5,444,064, (1995); Wadler S., et al, US 5,814,640, (1995); Peets E.A., et aL US 5,002,764, (1991)], such as leukemias, basal carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, breast cancer, gastrointestinal malignancies, Kaposi's sarcoma, CML, B-cell and T-cell lymphomas, melanomas, renal cell carcinoma, ovarian, bronchogenic, bladder, and acute leukemias, malignant glioma and<br>
30 fibrosarcoma. Additionally, interferons are also used for actinic keratoses [Wong V.G., et al US 5,632,984 (1997)]. Carswell R.E., et al EP 01/31789 (1985)], macular degeneration [Osther K. B., WO 98/06431 A2, (1998)], autoimmune disorders [Rusch L., WO 01/22970, (2001)] and diabetes [Bonnem E., US 4,846,782 (1989)]. A method using IFN to selectively induce a programmed cell death (apoptosis) in cancerous cells is also provided [Carswell R.E., et al EP 01/31789 (1985)].<br>
35 Further, improved results have been shown when interferon therapy is given along with radiotherapy in treating cancer [Taylor et al US 5,831,062, (1998)]. The combination therapy of hTNF and human interferon has synergistic growth inhibitory or cytotoxic effect on tumors. Yet<br><br>
3<br><br><br>
WO 2004/039996<br><br>
PCT/IN2002/000216<br><br>
another application/use of the human interferon gene is to carry out gene therapy [Taylor et al, US 5,831,062,(1998)].<br>
Their multifold actions on the immune system involve activation of macrophages, NK cells and intensifying the expression of various immunologically significant constituents of the cell 5      membrane [McCabe M. M., WO 00/3 9280, (2000).].<br>
As interferon have a species-specific activity, for its clinical use in humans; the protein should be obtained from genetic material directly related to the human interferon [Lin L., et al, J. Gen. Virol., 39:125-130, (1978).]. Various protein formulations of IFN are in clinical use [Sen G., et al, J. Virol., 50(2):445-450, (19S4); Jones G., et al, Cancer, 57:1709-1715, (1986); Klingemann<br>
10 H.G., et. al., Blood, 78(12): 3306-3311, (1991); Physicians' Desk Reference, PDR, 47th Edition, 1993: pages 1078-1079; 1879-1881; 2006-2008; 2194-2201.]. Most of the approved interferons in clinical use are mixtures or individual species of human interferon alpha (Hu-IFN a).<br>
Inspite of such a wide applications, the clinical use of IFN has been limited due to limited availability of the protein. The process of interferon isolation and purification from the whole<br>
15 blood after appropriate stimulus remains unsatisfactory [Horowitz B., Methods in Enzymol., Academic Press, N.Y., 119:39-47 (1986).].. Suitable cell lines that can be used for the production of large amount of IFN alpha subtypes include leukocytes [Cantell K., et al, Methods in Enzymol., Academic Press, N.Y., 78:29-38, (1981); Khavkin T., et al J. Leukocyte Biology, Annual Meeting Abstracts, Suppl. 3, Abstr. 137:36 (1992); Wheelock E. F., J. Bact. 92, 1415-1421, (1966); Ellis<br>
20 S.B., et. al., Mol. Cell. Biol., 9, 1316-1323, (1985); Morgensen K. E., et al, Pharmacol. Ther., 1, 369-381, (1977); Chirgwin J.M., et al., Biochemistry, 18: 5294, (1979);Stewart W. E., The Interferon System, Springer, Berlin, (1979).], Namalva cell (ATCC No. CRL-1432 etc.) [Dworkin-Rastl E., et. al., J. Interferon Research, 2, 575-585, (1982).], KG-l cell etc. However, it has been reported that the proportion of different IFN subtypes synthesized upon induction in the each cell<br>
25 varies [Hiscott I., et al Nucl. Acids. Res., 12, 3727-3746 (1984).]. Besides there are differences in properties of the protein and its native counterpart, which may affect the clinical efficacy and also there may be increased chances of negative host reactions, including fever, nausea, tissue necrosis, and psychopharmacological effects in the individual interferon subtypes [Adams F., et al, JAMA, 252(7):938-941 (1984); Wills R., et aL Clin. Pharmacol. Ther., 35(5):722-727 (May, 1984); Scott<br>
30     G., et al, J. Interferon Res., l(l):79-85 (1980);Barouki F., et al J. Interferon Res., 7:29-39 (1987)].<br>
The advent of rDNA technology has made it possible to obtain IEN with relative ease and<br>
safety. Appropriate cloning and expression vectors which have been used for r-IFN production<br>
include bacterial, fungal, yeast and mammalian cellular hosts [Pestka S., Human Cytokines,<br>
Blackwell Scientific Publications  1-16 (1992); Biotherapy  10:59-86 (1997); U.S. Pat no.<br>
35 4,897,471,5,541,293 and 5,661,009], the relevant contents of each of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In the prior art, bacterial strains for production of interferon have been reported [Hauptmann R., et al., United States Patent 5,710,027 (1998).]. Eukaryotic proteins produced in E.<br><br><br>
4<br><br>
WO 2004/039996<br><br>
PCT/IN2002/000216<br><br>
coli are sometimes nonfunctional, since glycosylation or other post-translational modifications do not occur because of lack of certain intracellular organelles in E. coli. Although exceptions are found, few recombinant interferon alpha have been cloned and expressed in E. coli and found to be biologically active [Streuli M., et. al, Science, 209: 1343-7 (1980); Goeddel D. V., et. al., Nature, 5      287, 411-416, (1981); Nagata S., et. al.. Nature, 284:316-310, (1980).].<br>
.Yeast cell has features such as ease of genetic manipulation and rapid growth characteristics like prokaryotic organism and biological characteristics typical of eukaryotic cell. This includes the sub-cellular machinery to carry our post-translational modification, which is desired. Commonly used yeast's include Honsenula polymorpha, S. cerevisiae and Pichia pasioris<br>
10 etc. strains, which are easier to work with variety of foreign genes. To prepare recombinant proteins, methylotrophic yeasts are most attractive candidates as it has certain genes, which are highly regulated and expressed under induced or de-repressed conditions [Nagata S., et. al., Nature, 284:316-310, (1980)].<br>
The desired gene can either be isolatedjfrom a cDNA library of human leukocyte or<br>
15 obtained from genomic libraries that are commercially available. Alternatively, mRNA isolated from humanjeukocytes can be utilized to obtain gene of interest by the known rnethods in prior art [Desai M., et. al., J. Interferon Res., 12: S138, (1992) Cantell K., et aL Methods in Enzymol., Academic Press, N.Y., 78:29-38, (1981); Khavkin T., et al, J. Leukocyte Biology, Annual Meeting Abstracts, Suppl. 3, Abstr. 137:36 (1992).;Wheelock E. F.; J. Bact. 92, 1415-1421, (1966); Ellis<br>
20 S.B., et al., Mol. Cell. Biol., 9,1316-1323, (1985);]. Such methods include use of inducers such as. viruses, natural or synthetic double-stranded RNA, intracellular microbes, microbial products and various other chemical agents.<br>
The methods are available to isolate mRNA having an abundance of messages coding for human IFN alpha [Chirgwin J.M., et al.. Biochemistry, 18: 5294, (1979); Stewart W. E., The<br>
25 Interferon System, Sprmger, Berlin, (1979);Hiscott I., et al Nucl. Acids. Res., 12, 3727-3746 (1984).]. The mRNA isolated can be used to prepare cDNA of the present invention according to the methods described in prior art {Rubinstein M., et al., Methods in Enzymology, Academic Press, N.Y., 78A, 69-75, (1981).]. The cDNA can be converted into dsDNA using gene specific primers.<br>
30	These dsDNA molecules can be cloned in suitable vectors and transformed into<br>
appropriate host such as E. coli or yeast Such a construct may include, an expression cassette comprising of a transcription promoter (T7, AOXl,Gal3) a gene encoding the polypeptide or protein of interest (e.g., dsDNA), and a transcription terminator (e.g., an AUG1 terminator, an AOX1  terminator, etc.). These elements should be operably linked so as to provide for<br>
35	transcription of the gene of interest and expression of a functional protein.<br>

Novel DNA of the present invention encodes human interferon alpha 2b, specifically DNA<br>
comprising the base sequence as set forth in {Fig. 2b} (SEQ ID 3). The complete physical map of<br>
type-I interferon gene cluster and its location in chromosomes is known [Diaz M. 0., et. al., J.<br>
Interferon Res., 11, S85, (1991); Overbade D., et. al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 78, 3123-3127,<br>
5      (1981);Trent J. M., et. al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 79, 7809-7813, (1982).].<br>
In the gene sequence homology search, the novel DNA of the present invention was found to have &gt; 99 % homology with corresponding part of some IFN subtypes deposited at NCBI GenBank database. The nearest matchine known IFN alpha 2b sequence is described in FIG. 2a (SEQ ID 2). The novel DNA sequence of the present invention has a distinct nucleotide 'Guanine'<br>
10 at 57th position, instead of 'Adenine' and 'Cytosine' at 195th position instead of 'Thymine' in comparison with the homologous sequences of human IFN alpha 2b gene. Further, another characteristic of this invention includes the protein encoded by said sequence has_similarity to mature IFN alpha 2b protein in its primary structure. Derivatives of interferon, which are part of this invention and may be obtained by any one of the process disclosed herein, include various<br>
15 structural forms of the primary protein, which retain biological activity. Due to the presence of ionizable amino and carboxyl groups, for example, an interferon alpha 2b protein may be in the form of acidic or basic salts, or may be in a neutral form. Individual amino acids may be modified by oxidation or reduction.<br>
The primary amino acid structure may be modified by forming covalent or aggregate<br>
20      conjugates with other chemical moieties, such as glycosyl groups, lipids, phosphate, acetyl, hydroxyacetyL amido groups and the like, or by creating amino acid mutants. Definitions:<br>
In the description that follows, a number of terms are used extensively. The following definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of the invention.<br>
25	As used herein, the terms "Interferon alpha 2b" or "IFN alpha 2b " refers to protein having<br>
amino acid sequences which are similar to the native mammalian interferon alpha 2b, which are capable of initiating response from Type I interferon receptor. The mature full-length human IFN-2b is usually a glycoprotein having a molecular weight of about 19.268 kilodaltons (kDa).<br>
"Modified Interferon alpha 2b " refers to a nucleotide sequence having eighteen additional<br>
30     nucleotides at the 5' end than the natural IFN alpha 2b.<br>
The term "isolated" or "purified", as used in the context of this specification to define the purity of interferon protein, means that the protein is substantially free of other proteins of natural or endogenous origin and contains less than about 1% by mass of protein contaminants residual of production processes.<br>
35	"Recombinant" as used herein, means that a heterologous protein is derived from<br>
recombinant (e.g. microbial or mammalian) expression systems. "Microbial" refers to bacterial or fungal (e.g. yeast) expression systems. "Recombinant microbial product" defines a protein<br><br><br><br>

produced in a recombinant microbial expression system, which is essentially free of native endogenous substances. Cloning process:<br>
Cloning of Interferon specific gene was initiated by stimulating specific RNA in human 5 leucocytes based on the strategies outlined herein and by the procedures described in the literature (Cantell K., et al, Methods in Enzymol., Academic Press, N.Y., 78:29-38, (1981); Khavkin T., et a!, .1. Leukocyte Bioiogy, Annual Meeting Abstracts, Suppl. 3, Abstr. 137:36 (1992); Wheelock E. F., J. Bact. 92, 1415-1421, (1966).). m-RNA was isolated and purified by using oligo dT columns according to known methods (Hiscott I., et al, Nucl. Acids. Res., 12, 3727-3746 (1984).). The<br>
10 purified m-RNA was used to prepare first strand of DNA by RT-PCR technique. The present process utilizes six sets of novel primers, which are specific for human IFN alpha. The nucleotide sequences of the first set of primers used to amplify the genes are shown in SEQ ID NOs.; 4 &amp; 5; 6 &amp; 7; of Table 2. The PCR products obtained with primers SEQ. 3D NO.; 4 &amp; 5 and 6 &amp; 7 were used for cloning of modified human IFN alpha 2b gene in cloning vector. Another set of primers<br>
15 (SEQ ID NOs.8 &amp; 9 /10 &amp;11), were used for subcloning of modified human IFN alpha 2b gene in suitable expression vector, which encodes for modified human IFN alpha 2b protein . The so obtained modified IFN alpha 2b clone was used further for cloning of mature human IFN alpha 2b using another set of primers (SEQ ID Nos. 12 &amp; 13 or 12 &amp; 14) to obtain a gene which encodes for human IFN alpha 2b protein. Suitable restriction endonuclease site such as EcoRI, Xhol site in the<br>
20 forward primer, while in reverse primer Xba I or Not I restriction sites may be incorporated in these oligonucleotides.<br>
These oligonucleotide primers can be synthesized using the known techniques in the prior art {Broka C, et. al, Nucleic Acids Res., 8, 5461-5471 (1980); Beaucage, S. L., and Carothers, M. H., Tetrahedron Lett. 22, 1859-1862, (1981); Johnson B. A., et al., Biotechniques 8, 424-429,<br>
25 (1990)]. They can also be synthesized in automated oligonucleotide synthesizers for e.g., Oligo 1000 (Beckman, USA) using phosphoramidites and oligonucleotide synthesis kit. Alternatively, custom designed synthetic oligonucleotides may be purchased, for example, from Bangalore Genei (Bangalore, India).<br>
The vector used to clone gene of interest may include plasmids derived from various<br>
30      sources such as E coli, for e.g. pBR322, pBR325, pUC12, pUC13, M13mpl8 etc.; Bacillus<br>
subtilis, for e.g. pUB110, pTP5, pC194, etc.; yeast for e.g. pSH19, pSH15, pPICZ alphaA, etc.;<br>
. bacteriophages such as lambda phage: and other vectors such as pAT-11, pXTl, pRc/CMV,<br>
pRc/RSV, pcDNAl/Neo and me like (Maeda S., et al.; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77, 7010-7013<br>
(1980); 78, 4648 (1981); Raymond C. K., et al., BioTechniques 26(1):134-141 (1999)]. The<br>
35 preferred plasmid in the present invention is M13mpl8 and pPICZ alphaA. The amplified PCR products were cloned in M13mp 18 and propagated in E. coli JM109. A blue white screening was carried out to select the recombinant E. coli having the gene of present invention. The modified<br>

IFN alpha 2b was subcloned independently in pPICZ alphaA expression vector. The inserted DNA were amplified, isolated and sequenced. This modified clone was subsequently used for isolation and cloning of the mature IFN alpha 2b gene in a suitable expression vector. The so obtained clone of human IFN alpha 2b was isolated and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence was compared with 5 the known gene sequences deposited at the NCBI GenBank database. This study lead to the conclusion that the unique gene encodes the human IFN alpha 2b subtype [Gewert D., Salom C, et. al., J Interferon Res., 13 (3), 227-231, (1993); Gabain A., et. al., Biotcchnol. Appl. Biochem., 33(3):173, (2001).].<br>
Besides plasmids, the expression vectors can either have genes acting as selective markers<br>
10 by imparting antibiotic resistance to the cells, such as G418 and other neomycin-type antibiotics (kanamycin resistance gene), or bleomycin/phleomycin-type antibiotics such as ZEOCTN (ble genes), as well as ampicilin resistance genes; or it may have gene for selective utilization of particular substrate for e.g. galactose, presence/absence of particular amino acid and the like. Preferably, selectable marker should be able to provide resistance in transformed yeast as well as<br>
15     bacteria. Other genes encoding dominant selectable markers are known to those of skill in the art [Romanos M., et al, DNA Cloning 2: Expression Systems, IRL Press , 2nd Ed, pages 123-167 -(1995); Markie D, Methods Mol. Biol, 54:359 (1996); Pfeifer T. A, et al. Gene, 188:183, (1997); Tucker R. M, and Burke D. T, Gene, 199:25, (1997); Hashida O, et al, FEBS Letters, 425:117, (1998); Romanos, M, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol, 6:527-533 (1995);Laroche Y, et al,<br>
20 Biotechnology, 12:1119 (1994)]. One such auxotrophic marker in Pichia pastoris KM 71 is histidine gene. It is essential for the transformant or transfectant to have at least one copy of the DNA coding for the protein of interest.<br>
The selection of promoter depends upon the host cell used for the transformation/ recombinant gene expression. When the host cell is of an animal origin, suitable promoter can be<br>
25 used such as SV40 promoter, LTR promoter, CMV promoter, HSV-TK promoter and the like. When the host is E. coli, the suitable promoter can be trp promoter, lac promoter, lambda PL promoter, Ipp promoter, T7 promoter and the like. When the host is yeast, suitable promoters can be PHO5 promoter, PGK promoter, AOX1 and AOX2 promoter [Rodriguez L, et al. Yeast, 12:815 (1996); Salki Y, et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,750,372.], GAP promoter [Waterham H. R, et al,<br>
30     Gene 186:37 (1997); Rosenberg S, et. al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,089,398.], ADH promoter and the like.<br>
Suitable promoters can be identified by its function according to known methods. The promoters<br>
.    of methylotrophic yeast, involved in methanol metabolism are particularly strong, and these are<br>
generally used to control the heterologous expression of proteins {Hollenberg C. P, et. al, EP<br>
0173 378 (1991); Viader S. J, EP 0952158, (1999); Stroman D. W, et al, EP 0183 071 (1992); ].<br>
35	There are many possible host cells, which have or can express the gene of interest under<br>
the control of suitable promoters. These include different types of microorganism, mammalian cells and others exemplified by, Escherichia species, Bacillus species, yeast cells, animal cells, or<br><br><br>

higher eukaryotes and the like, capable of expressing an appropriate vector. Examples of Escherichia species include strains such as Escherichia coli DH1 [Low B., PNAS, 60: 160 (1968)], JM103 [Messing J., et al, Nucl. Acids Res., 9:309 (1981)], JA221 [Clarke L., et al., J Mol. Biol, 120:517 (1978).], HB101 [Boyer H. W., J Mol. Biol., 41: 459 (1969).], C600 5 [Genetics, 39:440 (1954)] and the like. Examples of Bacillus species are, for example, Bacillus subtilis Mil 14 [Yoshimura K, Gene, 24: 255 (1983)] and the like. Examples of suitable mammalian host cells includes, COS-7, monkey kidney cells [Gluzman Y., Cell 23:175, (1981) ], L cells, C127, 3T3, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), Hela and BHK cell lines and the like. Examples of yeast cells which can be used include, for example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH22,<br>
10 AH22R, NA87-11A, DKD-5D or 20B-12, Schizosaccharomycespombe NCYC1913, Hansenula, Candida, or Pichia etc. It is preferable to use yeast cells to obtain the protein of this invention. It is more preferable to use methylotrophic yeast such as Pichia pastoris KM71 for the reason cited above.<br>
It is advantageous to use an expression vector, which comprises of a secretory signal<br>
15 sequence to drive secretion of expressed heterologous proteins. A typical secretory peptide consists of about 20 amino acids and it has a hydrophobic core of 6 to 15 amino acids followed by hydrophilic amino acid residues. Suitable secretory signal sequences can be preferably derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Pichia pastoris species and are exemplified by invertase gene (SUC2), acid phosphatase gene (PHOl and PH05), alkaline phosphatase gene, or alpha mating<br>
20 factor (MF.alpha.l), as well as a synthetic hybrid based on the PHOl sequence. The present invention has 85-89 amino acid long secretary signal, bearing kex2 and STE3 endopeptidase cleavage site as described by Brake et. al [Brake A. J., et al, PNAS, 81:4642-46 (1984).] and has yeast mating factor alpha as a preferred secretory signal.<br>
The method for transformation depends upon the host cells selected in accordance to<br>
25 standard techniques. The prior art describes methods to carry transformation for Escherichia species [Cohen S. N., et al., PNAS, 69:2110 (1972); Reid J. D., et. al., Gene, 17: 107 (1982)], Bacillus species [Chang S., et al., Molecular &amp; General Genetics, 168:111 (1979)], yeast cells [Becker D. M., et. al., Methods in Enzymology, 194: 182-187 (1991); Hinnen A., et. al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 75:1929 (1978)] and animal cells [Chang S., et al, Molecular &amp; General<br>

11<br><br>
WO 2004/039996<br><br>
PCT/IN2002/000216<br><br>
most suitable method for transformation is LiCl method [Gietz R. D., et. al., Method in Molecular Biology, I. H. Evans eds., Humana Press (Totowa, NJ)].<br>
The transformants or transfectants wherein the expression vector carries at least one copy of functional DNA, can be isolated according to the aforementioned techniques. The culture of 5      tranformants can be prepared as described below.<br>
Escherichia or Bacillus species can be suitably cultured in a liquid culture medium, wherein the culture medium contains appropriate carbon, nitrogen, and mincral sources, neccssary for the growth. The carbon sources may include glucose, dextrin, soluble starch, sucrose, etc. The nitrogen sources may include organic or inorganic substances such as ammonium salts, nitrates,<br>
10 corn steep liquor, peptone, casein, meat extracts, bean-cakes, potato extracts, etc. Examples of the minerals may include calcium chloride, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, magnesium chloride, etc. It is further allowable to add yeast's, vitamins, growth-promoting factors, etc. It is suitable that the pH of culture medium is at about 5 to 8.<br>
In the case of yeast transformants, the culture medium used may include available<br>
15 commercial preparations and standard media found in literature. It is preferable to keep the pH of the culture medium in between 3 to 6, kept at about 25 to 35 °C for about 24 to 72 hrs along with aeration and stirring if required.<br>
In the case of the transfectants of animal cells, the culture medium used may include MEM medium, DMEM medium, RPMI1640 medium, which may contain 5 to 20 % of fetal calf serum.<br>
20 The culture has pH of about 6 to 7 and is incubated at 30 to 40 °C for 15 to 60 hrs in 5-7% C02, environment. If required medium exchange, aeration and stirring may be applied.<br>
In the present invention methylotrophic yeast, especially Pichia species is the preferred organism. The suitable transformants obtained described above were labeled as Pichia pastoris ZIF clone 2.2 series. The transformants obtained were verified for the presence of interferon alpha<br>
25 2b gene. The transformants may have differences in expression levels of heterologous proteins, resulting due to factors such as the site of integration and copy number of the expression cassette and differences in promoter activity among individual isolates. Various screening methods to identify suitable transformants are available, which includes, for example, protein specific ELISA based assay or immunoblotting with IFN alpha 2b specific antibodies or specific HPLC assays.<br>
30 The recombinant clones of Pichia pastoris ZE? 2.2 series were screened for expression of the said proteins of this invention. From these recombinant clones, the clone Pichia pastoris ZIF 2.2/14 producing the human IFN alpha 2b protein was selected and the expressed protein was characterized further for its biological and immunological equivalence with the mature native human IFN alpha 2b.<br>
35	The IFN alpha 2b protein expressed was confirmed on SDS-PAGE, (FIG. 7). Further the<br>

10	Broadly, the unique fermentation process of this invention comprises of producing a high-<br>
density cell-culture of novel Pichia pastoris Z1F 2.2/14 clone and expression of heterologous protein under suitable conditions. Various types of fermentation techniques such as batch, fed-batch, and continuous fermentation protocols are well known to those skilled in the art [Brock T. D., Biotechnology: A Textbook of Industrial Microbiology, Sinauer Associates, 2nd Ed., (1989);<br>
15 Demain A. L. and Davies J. E., Manual of Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology, 2nd Ed., ASM Press, (1999); Hewitt C. J., et al., J.' Biotechnol. 75:251 (1999)]. The necessary conditions, equipment's and materials required to carryout fermentation by any conventional fermentor are well known [Sherman F., Methods in Enzymology, Guthrie C. et al. (Eds.), Academic Press, N.Y., 194:14, (1991); Hollenberg C. P., and Gellissen G., Curr. Opin. Biotechnol, 8:554-560 (1997)].<br>
20 Also, standard instrumentation is used to monitor various parameters such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen level amount of nutrients such as carbon source / methanol and nitrogen. All equipment and additives are sterilized according to suitable methods known in prior art.<br>
The typical fermentation protocol of the present invention provides conditions for high-density cell-mass build-up. The protocol has some characteristics of fed batch process of<br>
25 fermentation. The rate of addition of feed supply is related with the growth rate of cells, rate at which carbon and nitrogen are assimilated and also with C/H/N content of the cells.<br>
In the preferred recombinant Pichia pastoris KM 71, the typical production process comprises of cells cultured in liquid medium at about 25 °C to 35 °C, under aerated condition. Also it is known that in the case of Pichia pastoris the design of fermentor is an important factor<br>
30      during the process optimization [Ellis S.B., et. al., Mol. CeU. Biol., 9, 1316-1323, (1985).; Villatte<br>

leads to arrest of the logarithmic growth phase. At this point glycerol feed is initiated, and the feed rate is adjusted depending upon cell mass build up and utilization.<br>
In the preferred fermentation process of the present invention, culture medium includes a suitable source for carbon such as glucose, glycerol, sucrose etc., assimilable nitrogen such as 5 nitrates, NH4 as ammonical liquor, yeast nitrogen base etc., along with vitamins such as vitamin B12, essential amino acids such as histidine, biotin, methionine etc., mineral supplements and trace metals such as manganese, mercury, iron and molybdenum salts, phosphates, sulfates etc. During fermentation, there can be single or multiple ingredients acting as a source for carbon to the growing cell culture. Suitable carbon sources include compounds, such as glycerol, glucose,<br>
10 fructose and the like, preferably glycerol. Alternatively, carbon source can include lower alcohols such as methanol, ethanoL propanoL isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol and the like, preferably methanol. The examples of which include aqueous solution or syrups made using glucose or fructose, preferably aqueous solution. Glycerol may be used as the sole carbon source or 40 % of glycerol can be mixed with aqueous solution containing other nutrients required by the yeast.<br>
15 Alcohol content of the media can range from about 0.1 % to about 3 %. For example, medium can contain alcohol about 0.5 %, 1 %, 2 %, or 3 %.<br>
The fermentation is preferably conducted in a manner that the carbon source is a growth-limiting factor and thereby providing good conversion of the carbon source into higher cell mass buildup.<br>
20	The assimilable nitrogen can be supplied using any nitrogen containing compounds<br>
capable of releasing nitrogen in a form that can be utilized by the yeast. The examples of nitrogen source includes organic or inorganic substances such as ammonium salts, nitrates, corn steep liquor, peptone, casein, meat extracts, bean-cakes, potato extracts, protein hydrolysates, yeast extract, urea, ammonium hydroxide and the like more preferably aqueous ammonia solution.<br>
25	The media can also contain high level of inorganic salts, such as magnesium, maganese,<br>
copper, sodium, molybdenum, zinc, iron, potassium, calcium sulfate, phosphoric acid, orthophosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, boric acid and the like; vitamins such as biotin, thiamine and the like; protease inhibitors; amino acids such as histidine and the like; along with other trace nutrients and metals. Nevertheless, the medium can be supplemented with acid hydrolyzed casein<br>
30 (e.g., casamino acids or amicase) if desired to provide an enriched medium. In addition, media can also contain yeast's processing additives, growth-promoting factors, etc.<br>
The pH range in the aqueous microbial ferment may be in the range of 4 to 7, preferably around 4.5 to about 6.5.<br>
The preferred temperature during the fermentation is around 25°C-30°C, preferably<br>
35      around 30°C.<br>
The Pichia yeast requires aerobic conditions for growth, hence dissolved oxygen is required at all times during the fermentation. This may include supply of molecular oxygen in the<br><br><br><br>
14<br><br>

PCT/IN2002/000216<br><br>
form of air, oxygen enriched air or pure molecular oxygen itself so as to maintain the ferment with sufficient dissolved oxygen necessary to assist growth of cell. The overall aeration rates may vary from about 0.3 to 1.0 WM (volume air per volume of ferment per minute). The level of dissolved oxygen in the culture medium may vary from a minimum of about 1 % to about 100 % saturation, more preferably about 30 % to about 80 % saturation, and most preferably about 20 - 60 % saturation. During growth stage, the dissolved oxygen concentration may vary during the initial stages depending upon agitation (stirrer speed) in the fermentor.<br>
To achieve high cell density in the fermentation, a fed batch fermentation protocol may be suitably modified. This amy bivalve addition of suitable nutrients and carbon source. Alternatively, the batch can be modified by supplying booster feed of suitable nutrients from external source.<br>
After the suitable growth phase, protein production may be induced using the suitable alcohol, selected from the group.consisting of methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, and isobutanol, preferably methanol. Suitable time for starting the production phase can be between 48 to 110 hours of cell growth and the biomass achieved is approximately 100 to 200 g/L of wet weight. Induction of protein production is started by addition of methanol. Methanol is added in the concentration range of about 0.6 to 3.0 % v/v preferably 0.8 to 2.8 % v/v, which is monitored by gas chromatography. The production medium feed may deliver methanol in neat form or the alcohol may be diluted initially with suitable amounts of water or trace metal solution. Optionally along with a slow feed of methanol, glycerol may be provided for a short time to retain metabolic activity of the cells.<br>
It is not necessary to continuously add methanol for the entire production phase of fermentation process in the present invention. According to a preferable embodiment of the present invention, a medium may contain 1 to 2 % v/v methanol at the start of production phase of fermentation process. Production phase is monitored every 4-6 hours by sampling and examining various parameters which includes pH, OD, methanol concentration and increase in the concentration of the desired protein. Addition of methanol is controlled accordingly. Continuous or periodic addition of methanol is then started when the methanol concentration decreases to about 0.5 % v/v or less, and for example, 0.2 to 0.5% v/v. In case the methanol, concentration in the medium continues to decrease, eventually falling to 0 % to 0.1 % v/v the continuous addition may be started, and continued till methanol concentration of 2.0 to 3.0 % v/v is attained.<br>
During the time of methanol addition in this manner, the promoter is induced by methanol causing expression of the target gene, which encodes for IFN alpha 2b protein in the present invention. in addition to this, the added methanol may 6e partly used for the growth of the microorganisms. The preferred embodiment of this invention involves addition of medium or extra nitrogen source prior to induction, which may lead to growth of the microorganisms simultaneous to the protein production, over at least a certain period of time.<br><br><br><br>

At the end of the production phase, the protein is isolated by conventional methods, either from the medium if the protein is secreted, of from the ceils if it is not.<br>
During the protein production phase, it is essential to minimize spurious proteolysis of recombinant peptides or polypeptides and various methods to inhibit in vivo proteolysis of the expressed heterologous proteins are known in the prior art [Zamost B., et. aL, United States Patent 6,258,559, (2001)]. In yeast, the major store of proteolytic activity is located within the lumen, of the vacuolar compartment [Jones E. W., et. aL, Methods in Enzymol., Academic Press, N.Y., 194:428 (1991).]. The common practices for minimizing the proteolytic degradation include saturating proteases by adding casamino acids or peptone to the culture medium and / or counteracting neutral proteases by reducing the pH level of the culture medium to about 3.0 [Gellissen G., et aL, Gene Expression in Recombinant Microorganisms, Smith (ed.), Marcel Dekker Inc., 195-239 (1994); (US 4,775,622,).].<br>

Purification of Heterologous Protein obtained from Transformed Pichia :<br>
Prior art describes number of methods to isolate the recombinant proteins obtained from transformed yeast cells [Romanos M., et al., DNA Cloning 2: Expression Systems, 1RL Press , 2nd Ed., pages 123-167 (1995); Trotta P. P., et al, Developments in Industrial Microbiology, Elsevier, 5 Amsterdam, 53-64 (1987); Nagabhushan T. L. and Trotta P. P., Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, A14, VCH, Weinheim, Federal Republic of Germany 372-374 (1989).]. Standard techniques, such as affinity chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, HPLC and the like can be used to purify the protein of interest.<br>
Typically, secreted proteins can have purity anywhere in between 20 - 50 %. The<br>
10      expressed polypeptide can be further purified to 90 % purity; or even greater than 95 % purity with<br>
respect to contaminating macromolecules, particularly other proteins, nucleic acids, and other<br>
infectious and pyrogenic agents. Polypeptides expressed by methylotrophic yeast may also be<br>
purified to a pharmaceutically pure state, which is greater than 99.0 % pure.<br>
In cases where proteins are secreted into culture media, advantage is of relatively lower 15 contaminating substances, and the supernatant can be collected by known methods to isolate proteins [Berg K., Acta Path. MicrobioL Immunol. Scand., Section C; Suppl. 279, 1-136 (1982); Berg JL, and Heron L, Methods in Enzymology, Academic Press, N.Y, 78, 487-499 (1981); Pestka S., and Rubinstein M., U.S. 4,289,690, (1981).]. This culture supernatant containing expressed protein can be purified by any one or more than one method in combination. The 20 standard methods of protein purification are based on differences in the physicochemical characteristics of the proteins. The various methods are enlisted below:<br>
i) solubility difference, examples of which include methods such as salting out, precipitation with solvents,<br>
ii) differences in molecular size or weight, examples include dialysis, ultrafiltration, gel 25      filtration and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,<br>
iii) difference in the electric charge, examples include ion-exchange chromatography,<br>
iv) methods utilizing specific affinity, examples include affinity chromatography,<br>
v) methods utilizing a difference in the hydrophobic property, examples include reversed-<br>
phase high-performance liquid chromatography or Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography and<br>
30	vi) methods utilizing a difference in the isoelectric point examples include isoelectric<br>
electrophoresis, etc.<br>
In order to obtain the native protein in its correctly folded State, it is preferable to use processes which avoids denaturation and precipitation steps.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is concerned with production and purification of 35      homogeneous IFN alpha 2b using chromatographic techniques particularly ion exchange and concentrating the purified protein by ultrafiltration. The present invention aims to provide a large-scale protein purification process to achieve high degree of purity in an economical way.<br><br><br>

Suitable chromatographic media include derivatized' dextrans, agarose, cellulose, polyacrylamide, specialty silicas and the like, including PE1, DEAE, QAE, and Q derivatives. Examples of chromatographic media include those media derivatized with phenyl butyl, or octyl groups, such as Phenyl-Sepharose FF (Pharmacia), Toyopearl butyl 650 (Toso Haas, Montgomeryville, Pa.), Octyl-Sepharose (Pharmacia) and the like, or polyacrylic resins, such as Amberchrom CG 71 (Toso Haas) and the like. Suitable solid supports include glass beads, silica-based resins, cellulosic resins, agarose heads, cross-linked agarose beads, polystyrene beads, cross-linked polyacrylamide resins and the like that are insoluble under the conditions in which they are to be used. Optionally, one can modify these supports with reactive groups such that proteins can link with amino, carboxyl, sulfliydryl, hydroxj'l and/or carbohydrate moieties from the protein. Also, it is possible to engineer a tag onto the amino- or carboxyl-terminus of the recombinant protein to allow purification by affinity chromatography [125,139-140].<br>
In cases where the protein thus obtained is in a free form, the free protein can be converted into a salt thereof by known methods or method analogous thereto. In case, where the protein thus obtained is in a salt form vice versa, the protein salt can be converted into a free form or into any other salt thereof by known methods or method analogous thereto. The suitable buffer solution may contain a protein-denaturing agent such as urea or guanidine hydrochloride or a surfactant such as Triton X-100 TM.<br>
The process of this invention preferably elutes the interferon from ion exchange column by increasing the pH. Such pH increase can be obtained by applying a buffer solution to the column. Such process may involve applying a solution of the said crude interferon onto a column, such as eluting the adsorbed interferon from said column using a buffer solution, wherein suitable known techniques of the chromatography may be used, which may include for example salt gradient or pH; concentrating the eluate obtained from previous step in a suitable way; The purification process was carried out according to the following schemes: Scheme 1:<br>

The  total  protein   content  was   determined  according  to  the  Bradford's   method. Determination of specific protein, IFN alpha 2b was carried out by gel densitometry using 15      Strategene Eagle Eye Video documentation system. Purity of IFN alpha 2b    protein was determined by RP-HPLC using YMC protein RP column.<br>
If desired, the highly purified human interferon alpha 2b may be further used for making crystals, to prepare depot formulations [Reichert P., et al, US 5,741,485 (1998);]. Until date, two forms of crystalline human interferon alpha 2 have been reported [Nagabhushan T. L. and Trotta P. 20 P., Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, A14, VCH, Weinheim, Federal Republic of Germany 372-374 (1989); Miller D.

(Gressen I ed., "Interferons, 1979" 5      Academic Press, New York;). Utility of the protein<br>
Type I interferons exhibit potent antiviral properties. Type I interferons also exhibit potent anticellular proliferation activity and immunomodulatory activity. IFN alpha have shown to inhibit various types of cellular proliferation. IFN.alpha.'s are especially useful against hematologic 10 malignancies such as hairy-cell leukemia (Quesada, et aL, 1984). Further, these proteins have also shown activity against multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, low-grade lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, renal-cell carcinoma, urinary bladder tumors and ovarian cancers (Bonnem, et al, 1984; Oldham, 1985). The role of interferons and interferon receptors in the pathogenesis of certain autoimmune and inflammatory diseases has also been 15 investigated (Benoit, et aL, 1993). IFN.alphas are also useful against various types of viral infections (Finter, et al, 1991). Alpha interferons have shown activity against human papillomavirus infection, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C infections (Finter, et aL, 1991; Kashima, et aL, 1988; Dusheiko, et aL, 1986; Davis, et aL, 1989).<br>
It has also been reported that interferons may be used to treat autoimmune, inflammatory,<br>
20     proliferative   and   hyperproliferative   diseases,   as   well   as   cutaneous   manifestations   of<br>
immunologically mediated  diseases.  In particular,  methods   of the present  invention  are<br>
advantageous for treating conditions relating to immune system hypersensitivity [Johnson H. M.,<br>
et al, USP 6,204,022 (2001).].<br>
Autoimmune diseases particularly amenable for treatment using the methods of the present 25      invention  include  multiple  sclerosis,  type I  (insulin dependent)  diabetes  mellitus,   lupus erythematosus, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, stomatitis, asthma, uveitis, allergies and psoriasis [Johnson H. M., et aL, USP 6,204,022 (2001).].<br>
Interferon alpha 2b of the present invention can be used, either singularly or in combination with other therapies as is known in the art for the treatment of any of the above 30      mentioned therapeutic conditions. Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
IFN alpha 2b of the present invention can be formulated according to known methods for preparing pharmaceutically useful compositions. Formulations comprising interferons have been previously described (for example, Martin, 1976). In general, the compositions of the present 35      invention will be formulated such that an effective amount of the interferon is administered.<br>
The compositions used in these therapies may also be in a variety of forms. These include, for example, solid, semi-solid, and liquid dosage forms, such as tablets, pills, powders, liquid<br><br><br>

solutions or suspensions, liposomes, suppositories, injectable, and infusible solutions. The preferred form depends on the intended mode of administration and therapeutic application. The compositions also preferably include conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and adjuvants, which are known to those skilled in the art. Preferably, the compositions of the invention are in the form of a unit dose and will usually be administered to the patient one or more times a day.<br>
The IFN.alpha 2b of the present invention may be administered to a patient in any pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form, including but not limited to oral intake, inhalation, intranasal spray, intraperitoneal, intravenous, intramuscular, intralesional, or subcutaneous injection.<br>
Interferon alpha protein solution formulations as mentioned in US 5,766,582 (Schering Plough) describes a process for making stable aqueous solution, formulations containing Alfa-type interferon for e.g. IFN alpha 2a and IFN alpha 2b, a phosphate buffer between pH range 6.6 to 7, Tween-80 as a stabilizer, EDTA as chelating agent, NaCl as a tonicity agent and m-cresol as an antimicrobial agent which maintain high chemical, physical and biological stability of the IFN alpha for an extended storage period of atleast 24 months. The same is included in this invention by way of reference.<br>

The modified IFN alpha 2b clone ZBT-IF MB3 of EXAMPLE 3 was further used for cloning of human interferon alpha 2b of this invention. Plasmid DNA was isolated from the clone<br>
20 using Wizard Plus SV Miniprep DNA purification system (Promega). This DNA was then restriction digested using Xho I+ Not I or EcoRI + Not I enzymes, 1 x universal buffer in 20 µl solution to release the cloned modified IFN alpha 2b fragment. This fragment was purified from the gel using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) and used as a template for PCR amplification of human IFN alpha 2b of this invention with Primers having SEQ ID 12 &amp; 13 or<br>

The transformed cells were plated on a low salt Luria agar containing 25 µg/ml each of Zeocin and Tetracycline, plates were incubated at 37°C overnight. The transformants, (hereinafter called E coli ZBT-IF 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 —) were verified for the presence of the IFN alpha 2b gene as described before. (Fig. 4,5)<br>
10	The orientation of the IFN alpha 2b gene was confirmed by using the combination of<br>
vector specific and gene specific primers. The positive transformant having the right orientation was used for further sub cloning in Pichia pastor is KM71 strain. The positive clone or the recombinant clone having the IFN alpha 2b gene was called E coli ZBT- IF 2.2 and this clone was sequenced using the dideoxy termination method. The sequence data confirmed that the gene is<br>
15      novel, interferon alpha 2b gene{Fig No. 2b - SEQ ID No. 3}.<br>
The homology search was carried out with sequences at NCBI GenBank database using "BLAST-N" and it was concluded that the gene of present invention had a nearest match (&gt;99%) with published human leukocyte interferon alpha gene sequence. However it did not match 100 % with the published gene sequence (Fig. No. 2a-SEQ ID NO. 2). It had two point mutations, one at<br>
20      57th nucleotide position and the other at 195th nucleotide position {SEQ ID 3}. Thus the gene of the present invention is a novel human IFN alpha 2b gene. EXAMPLE 5: Transformation of yeast Pichia pastoris with expression construct:<br>
Transformation of yeast Pichia pastoris KM 71 was carried out according to method described in literature using LiCl [Higgins D. R., and Cregg J. M., (eds.), Pichia Protocols,<br>

A single isolated colony of Pichia pastoris KM 71 was grown in 10 ml of YPD media (Table IF). The cells were harvested, washed twice with distilled water and suspended in 10 ml of 100 mM LiCl. Competent cells were recovered by brief centrifugation. Yeast pellet was mixed with 240 p.1 of 50 % PEG, 36 ul of 1 M LiCL 25 pi of 2 mg / ml SS DNA and 50 \x\ of the<br>
30      linearized insert (1-10 µ.g) and construct was introduced into yeast cell by heat shock.<br>
The transformed cells were plated on selective agar plates (YPD agar containing Zeocin antibiotic) and incubated for 2 to 4 days at 30°C. Twenty five transformants / clones were selected and PCR analysis was done using their genomic DNA to determine integration of IFN alpha 2b gene into the Pichia genome (FIG.6). These twenty five transformants/ clones were then screened<br>
35      for the production of the IFN alpha 2b protein at shake flask level. These clones were named as Pichia pastoris ZIF clone 2.2/1 - 2.2/25<br>
