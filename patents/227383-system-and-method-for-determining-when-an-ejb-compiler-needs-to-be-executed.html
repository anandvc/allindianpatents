Claim of Priority:<br>
[0001]	This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent<br>
Application 60/450,645, filed February 28, 2003 (Atty. Docket No. BEAS-<br>
01413US0); and U.S. Patent Application No.	, filed February<br>
	, 2004 (Atty. Docket No. BEAS-01413US1) which are incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
[0002]	The invention relates generally to application servers and<br>
software development systems, and particularly to a system and method for determining when an EJB compiler needs to be executed.<br>
Background:<br>
[0003]	In a typical application server, for example the WebLogic<br>
Server product from BEA systems, Inc., for an EJB to be deployed in the server, the EJB Compiler must be invoked on the ejb-jar file containing the EJB prior to deployment. For each EJB in the ejb-jar file, the EJB Compiler is responsible for validating the EJB, generating wrapper classes for the EJB, compiling the generated wrapper classes and invoking the RMI Compiler when necessary.   This can be a time consuming process, on the order of<br><br>
several seconds per EJB. For an ejb-jar file with a large number of EJBs, the combined time can be significant.<br>
[0004]	To make matters worse, the EJB Compiler usually needs to be<br>
run each time the ejb-jar file is updated. An ejb-jar file is typically updated several times as it is developed. Compounding the issue further is the fact that the EJB Compiler is often invoked via a script, which doesn't typically have logic to determine whether the EJB Compiler actually needs to be invoked or not. This means the script invokes the EJB Compiler even when it doesn't need to, wasting valuable time.<br>
[0005]	The EJB Compiler also needs to be run after the server is<br>
upgraded, since the classes generated by the EJB Compiler may be incompatible with the new server code. If, after upgrading to a new server version, the user forgets to run the EJB Compiler before deploying the EJB, unexpected errors can result.<br>
[0006]	Another problem is that users may forget to run the EJB<br>
Compiler on an EJB after updating it. This can also lead to unexpected errors when the EJB is deployed since the classes generated by the EJB Compiler may no longer be compatible with the EJB.<br>
Summary:<br>
[0007]	The invention provides a system and method for determining<br>
when an EJB compiler needs to be executed. To determine if an EJB needs to be recompiled or not, we need to know the state of the EJB and the server version of when it was last compiled. Once we have this information, we can compare it to the current state of the EJB and current server version to determine whether we need to rerun the EJB compiler or not. In accordance with one embodiment, the invention comprises the following steps: obtaining the current server version and recording it in a file; for each dependent EJB class, computing a unique hash based on the public method signatures and<br><br>
public field declarations for the class; recording the fully qualified class name along with its computed hash to a file; for each deployment descriptor for the EJB, computing a unique hash based on the bytes of the file; recording the deployment descriptor name along with its computed hash to the file containing the class names and hashes; and, storing the file containing the hashes in the compiled ejb-jar file.<br>
Brief Description of the Figures:<br>
[0008]	Figure 1 shows a flowchart illustrating the algorithm or process<br>
that is run each time the EJB Compiler is invoked, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.<br>
Detailed Description:<br>
[0009]	The invention provides a system and method for determining<br>
when an EJB compiler needs to be executed. To determine if an EJB needs to be recompiled or not, the system needs to know the state of the EJB and the server version of when it was last compiled. Once this information is obtained, it can be compared to the current state of the EJB and current server version to determine whether to rerun the EJB compiler or not. Since only certain changes to an EJB require the EJB Compiler to be run, the comparison can be limited to attributes that would require the EJB Compiler to rerun. In accordance with one embodiment, the following changes require an EJB to be recompiled:<br>
Any change to a deployment descriptor for an EJB.<br>
Any change to a public method signature (including addition or removal of a public method) of a dependent EJB class (i.e. an EJB implementation class, interface, or primary key class).<br>
Any change to a public field declaration (including addition or removal of a public field) of a dependent EJB class.<br><br>
[0010]	Having the ability to determine when the EJB Compiler must be<br>
rerun allows the system to automatically rerun the compiler, when necessary, inside of the server. For instance, if the user upgrades the server and forgets to rerun the EJB Compiler, the system can detect that the EJB Compiler needs to be rerun and automatically do this for the user when the EJB is deployed to the server. Similarly, the system can also automatically run the EJB Compiler if the user forgets to rerun the compiler after updating her EJB. This is very helpful since it avoids situations where unexpected errors can occur during deployment due to incompatibilities with the classes generated by the EJB Compiler.<br>
EJB Compiler Algorithm<br>
[0011]	Figure 1 shows a flowchart illustrating the algorithm or process<br>
that is used by the system, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The algorithm is run each time the EJB Compiler is invoked. It provides a relative snapshot of the EJB and server version at the time the EJB is compiled. As shown in Figure 1, the algorithm or process comprises the following steps:<br>
1.	Get the current server version and record it in a file.<br>
2.	For each dependent EJB class, compute a unique hash based on the public method signatures and public field declarations for the class.<br>
3.	Record the fully qualified class name along with its computed hash to a file.<br>
4.	For each deployment descriptor for the EJB, compute a unique hash based on the bytes of the file.<br>
5.	Record the deployment descriptor name along with  its computed hash to the file containing the class names and hashes.<br>
6.	Store the file containing the hashes in the compiled ejb-jar file. [0012]          With this snapshot, the system can determine, at a later time,<br><br>
whether it needs to rerun the EJB Compiler for a given EJB. If the current snapshot of the EJB is equal to the snapshot of the EJB when it was last compiled, then we don't need to recompile.<br>
[0013]	The present invention may be conveniently implemented using<br>
a conventional general purpose or a specialized digital computer or microprocessor programmed according to the teachings of the present disclosure. Appropriate software coding can readily be prepared by skilled programmers based on the teachings of the present disclosure, as will be apparent to those skilled in the software art.<br>
[0014]	In some embodiments, the present invention includes a<br>
computer program product which is a storage medium (media) having<br>
instructions stored thereon/in which can be used to program a computer to<br>
perform any of the processes of the present invention. The storage medium<br>

optical discs, DVD, CD-ROMs, microdrive, and magneto-optical disks, ROMs,<br>
RAMs, EPROMs, EEPROMs, DRAMs, VRAMs, flash memory devices,<br>
magnetic or optical cards, nanosystems (including molecular memory ICs),<br>
or any type of media or device suitable for storing instructions and/or data.<br>

Many modifications and variations will be apparent to the practitioner skilled in the art. Particularly, it will be evident that while the examples described herein illustrate how the invention may be used in a WebLogic environment, other application servers, and computing environments may use and benefit from the invention.<br>
