3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be  performed : -<br>
 <br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention concerns high quality free standing gallium nitride wafers suitable for the subsequent growth of efficient device structures and a method of manufacture thereof.<br>
More specifically, the invention relates to a process for growth of low dislocation density GaN on a substrate, to a process for epitaxial growth where the lateral and vertical growth rates of the material are controlled by growth conditions, to a process of separation from the starting substrate.<br>
The present invention also relates to a nitride semiconductor wafer having a GaN crystal formed by such a method and a nitride semiconductor device produced therefrom.<br>
Description of the state of the art<br>
GaN-based compound semiconductors, such as gallium nitride (GaN), the ternary alloys, indium gallium nitride (InGaN) and gallium aluminium nitride (GaAIN) and even the quaternary (AlGalnN) are direct band gap semiconductors. Their gaps cover wavelengths extending from visible to UV. Henceforth, nitride alloy semiconductors are recognized as having great potential for short wave length emission. GaN is used in the manufacture of light emitting diodes (LEDs), blue-violet laser diodes (LDs) and UV detectors. The next generation of high density disc systems (blu-ray DVD and HD-DVD) will require GaN blue-violet LD. In addition to optoelectronics, due to its intrinsic properties (wide gap, high thermal and chemical stability, high electron saturation velocity), GaN will be used as well in the fabrication of high-temperature electronics devices.<br>
Unfortunately, the development of nitride materials has been hampered by problems in the processing technology of such materials. One of the most important problems in the development of lll-N devices is the lack of gallium nitride bulk substrates of acceptable usable area or of lattice-matched substrates for growth of low-defect density lll-N layers. GaN cannot be melted and pulled from a boule like silicon, gallium arsenide, or sapphire, because at usual pressures its theoretical melting temperature exceeds its dissociation temperature.<br>
 <br>
Substantial difficulties have been shown when attempting to obtain large-area crystals of<br>
any Group Ill-nitride that could provide suitable substrates for device fabrication. GaN<br>
bulk crystals can be grown by high pressure high temperature melt growth in liquid<br>
Ga. This technology has been developed at UNIPRESS (Poland), but the size of the<br>
substrate (~lcm-2) and the volume of the potential mass production do not reach by far<br>
the industrial needs. Nevertheless low defect	densities ~102 to 105   cm"    have been<br>
achieved using this method. (1. Grzegory and S. Porowski, Thin Solid Films, 367, 281(2000).<br>
The techniques currently used for the fabrication of relatively high quality GaN and related layers involve the heteroepitaxial deposition of a GaN device layer onto a suitable but non-ideal substrate. Currently such substrates include (but are not limited to) sapphire, silicon or silicon carbide. All heteroepitaxial substrates present challenges to the high-quality deposition of GaN, in the form of lattice and thermal mismatch. Lattice mismatch is caused by the difference in interatomic spacing of atoms in dissimilar crystals. Thermal mismatch is caused by differences in the thermal expansion coefficient between dissimilar materials.<br>
Since the lattice constant of a sapphire substrate differs from that of GaN, a continuous GaN single crystalline film cannot be grown directly on the sapphire substrate. Therefore, a process wherein the strain of the lattice is, to some extend, relieved in a buffer layer of AIN orGaN grown on the sapphire substrate at a low temperature, and then GaN is grown thereon has been proposed, and is currently achieved routinely. The use of a nitride layer grown at a low temperature as a buffer layer has enabled the single-crystalline epitaxial growth of GaN. However, even this method cannot compensate the lattice-mismatch between the substrate and the crystal, and the GaN film has still numerous defects.<br>
Sapphire and SiC have become the standard substrates for 111-N growth, despite significant lattice mismatches. Such large mismatches lead to the formation of very high densities of threading dislocations (~109cm-2) and eventually cracks. Thermal mismatch should also be considered. Typically the GaN is grown for instance onto sapphire or SiC at a temperature of between 1000-1100°C; as the sample cools down to room temperature,   the difference in thermal expansion (contraction) rates gives rise<br>
 <br>
to high levels of stress at the interface between the two materials. Sapphire has a higher coefficient of thermal expansion than does GaN. As the sapphire substrate and GaN layer cool down, the mismatch at the interface puts the GaN under compression and the sapphire under tension. Thus, the amount of stress is directly related to the thickness of the deposited GaN, such that the thicker the film, the greater the stress. Above a film thickness of approximately 10 microns, the stress levels exceed the fracture limits of the GaN, and cracking and peeling of the film may result. Cracks in this layer are even worse than high dislocations, and should be avoided because of their catastrophic propagation into the device layer during subsequent processing steps.<br>
All the technological development of the epitaxy of GaN or sapphire or SiC aims to reduce the TO density and avoid crack formation.<br>
The occurence of extended defects (threading dislocations, stacking faults, and antiphase boundaries) leads to significantly deteriorated performances and results in a shortened operating lifetime of devices. More specifically, the dislocations behave as nonradiative centres, thus reducing the light-emitting efficiency of light-emitting diodes and laser diodes made from these materials. These dislocations also increase the dark current. Although threading dislocations have   not prevented   the<br>
development of high-brightness light-emitting diodes, they limit the lifetime and cause catastrophic failure in laser diodes. They also cause excessive reverse-bias leakage currents in p-n junction devices such as high- electron-mobility transistors, field-effect transistors and other electronic devices. Further, the dislocations can act as strong scattering centres for carriers, thus reducing the mobility of electrons and holes<br>
unfavourably, limiting the performance of many semiconductor devices.<br>
Henceforth, there is an urgent need for high quality free standing GaN with uniform distribution of threading dislocations. This implies the ability of growing thick low dislocation density GaN layers and to properly separate the thick HVPE layer from<br>
the starting substrate. It has been shown by Takeya et al, phys. stat. sol. (c) 0, 7, 2292 (2003) that that to reach an operating time of 104 hours in LDs, the starting substrate should have less than 3xl06TD.cm-2  present.<br>
 <br>
Numerous methods to reduce the TD and other extended defect density have been proposed.<br>
MOVPE is the most widely used method for growing GaN based device structure and is well known by the skilled person in the art. Among methods, let's mention low temperature buffer layer, SiN nanomasking, low temperature AIN interlayers, Si- 5 doping. These methods are reviewed in "P. Gibart, Metal organic vapour phase epitaxy of GaN and lateral overgrowth, Reports on Progress in Physics, 67(2004) 667".<br>
Techniques for reducing the density of crystalline defects density using Epitaxial Lateral Overgrowth (ELO) are widely documented, see for instance "Epitaxial Lateral Overgrowth of GaN, B. Beaumont, P. Vennegues and P. Gibart, Phys.stat.sol(b) 227, 1-43(2001) Special issue, Interface and defects at Atomic Level".<br>
Further, it is disclosed in "S. Nakamura et al, Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. 38 (1999) p226" that a operating life-time of 10000 hours of the gallium nitride blue laser diode device can be obtained through the use of these techniques.<br>
Epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELO) involves at least two growth steps. ELO takes advantage of the faster growth of GaN in one given crystallographic direction to produce lower dislocation densities (less than approximately 107cm-2 ). Nam et al. (0. Nam, M. Bremser, T. Zheleva, and R. Davis, Appl. Phys. Lett., 71(18), 1997, 2638-2640) describe the production of 111-V semiconductor materials using ELO. This ELO method requires an initial growth of a GaN layer on a substrate, removal from the growth reactor, ex-situ processing, deposition of dielectric masks, and reinsertion into the growth reactor. Various etching and other processing steps are included.<br>
In the standard ELO technology, growth process is tailored to promote lateral growth where TDs are not propagating. However, TDs dislocations are still propagating above the opening in the mask and devices like LD should be made on stripe above the masked area.<br>
 <br>
In the two-step ELO (US 6 325 850) these drawbacks are to some extend avoided. Actually, in the first step, the growth conditions of GaN are adjusted to produce triangular stripes with {11-22} lateral facets. The growth rate of the top (0001) facet is higher than the growth rate of the inclined {1122} lateral facets. This first step is pursued until the top facet completely vanishes. Indeed, this first step with the occurrence of lateral facets favours TDs reduction through bending at 90° of the TDs, this bending behaviour has been stressed out by Sasaoka et al, J. Cryst. Growth 189-190, 61(1998). Actually, this first step which results in an efficient reduction of the threading dislocation densities is pursued as long as judged necessary, this is the basic concept used in the FIELO process.<br>
Then, in a second step, the lateral growth is favoured until complete coalescence and smoothing of the surface. Increasing the lateral growth rate can be achieved either by increasing the temperature, or introducing Mg in the vapour phase, or decreasing the pressure. The dislocations above the window first propagate vertically, (as in the standard-ELO), but afterwards bend by 90° to adopt a direction along the (0001) basal plane. The bending of most of the dislocations results in a drastic reduction of their density in the upper part of the film, i.e. for a thickness greater than the height of the pyramids obtained at the end of the first growth step. After bending, most of the dislocations have a line parallel to [1-210] which extends to the coalescence boundary with the overgrown GaN coming from the adjacent stripe. The boundary is therefore an area of defect accumulation.<br>
Several types of behaviours of the dislocations in the boundary have been observed:<br>
-	bending down to the void resulting in their termination therein,<br>
-	bending up in the boundary and threading up to the surface.<br>
A half loop is formed between two dislocations having the same Burger vector but coming from adjacent overgrowth. However, TDs that did not bent downwards or create a half loop, merge on the surface.<br>
TDs bending can be explained qualitatively, from a simple free energy minimization viewpoint:<br>
 <br>
-   the Burgers  vector of the TDs is not normal to the surface; this causes   a straight dislocation line to feel forces tending to orient it at a certain angle to the normal.<br>
These forces acting on such a line are the sum of two terms, one acts to rotate the line so that it is normal to the surface, while the second term acts to align the dislocation with the Burgers vector. As the line energy of a dislocation depends also of its character, the energy of a screw being the lowest, bending at 90° of a edge eventually produce a screw dislocation, or introduce a screw component thus lowering the enthalpy of the system. This behaviour of TD in the 2S-ELO technology has been recently quantified using the anisotropic theory to calculate dislocations energies in GaN as a function of their line direction, S. Gradcak et al, Appl. Phys. Lett.,85, 4648 (2004).<br>
Two-step ELO, also called FACELO (US) or FIELO (US) and cantilever Epitaxy (CE) as described in US 6 599 362 has also proven to be efficient in reducing the TDs density. Actually this method involves the same basic mechanisms than in ELO. Numerous improvements of the standard technologies have been proposed.<br>
The pendeo-epitaxial method is described by Linthicum et al. (K. Linthicum, T. Gehrke, D. Thomson, K. Tracy, E. Carlson, T. Smith, T. Zheleva, C. Zorman, M. Mehregany, and R. Davis, MRS Internet J. Nitride Semicond. Res. 4S1, G4.9, 1999) and Zheleva et al. (T. Zheleva, S. Smith, D. Thomson, T. Gehrke, K. Linthicum, P. Rajagopal, E. Carlson, W. Ashmawi, and R. Davis, MRS Internet J. Nitride Semicond. Res. 4S1, G3.38, 1999), requires an initial growth of an 111-N layer on a substrate, removal from the growth reactor, ex-situ processing, and re- insertion into the growth reactor. In the PE method, lateral growth of GaN films suspended from (1120) side walls of (0001) oriented GaN columns into and over adjacent etched wells has been achieved via metal-organic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE) without the use of, or contact with, a supporting mask or substrate.<br>
Even though ELO or pendeo technologies have significantly improved the quality of heteroepitaxiaal GaN, some drawbacks remain and are difficult to overcome. Whatever the ELO process, coalescence  boundaries are created that are region of poor<br>
 <br>
quality. Therefore, optoelectronic devices should be fabricated on the good part of the ELO surface, thereby requiring complex technology.<br>
Besides, getting thick ELO layers won't result in a disappearance of the coalescence boundaries, but conversely more likely in a spreading of this defective region. What is critically needed are GaN wafers with uniform distribution of TDs.<br>
Historically, HVPE was the first method to produce epitaxial layers in the early 1970s. Because HVPE was unable to produce p-type GaN, it was largely abandoned in the early 1980s. Nowadays, the renewed interest in this method lies in its ability to grow GaN at high growth rates and thereby allow the fabrication of pseudo-substrates or free standing GaN. Growing thick HVPE is used to get low dislocations   density, typically<br>

h"2/3. This means that very thick layers (~30o1-um up to 1 mm) are required to reduce<br>
the TDs below 107cm-2. In other words, by growing thicker layers more interactions between dislocations can take place. Indeed interactions are more efficient close to the interface where more mixed dislocations are present. As the layer becomes thicker, this leaves primarily edge dislocations with larger separation, therefore interactions become less and less likely and a further decrease of the density of TDs becomes difficult. Actually, these TDs reduction mechanisms are very inefficient, and a closer look at the reduction mechanisms show that the most efficient reduction process comes from mixed dislocations.<br>
Therefore, one way to get faster reduction with thickness is to increase the proportion of mixed TDs in the starting layer. This has been achieved in the patent of ATMI (reference) in which the proportion of mixed TDs was increased by low surface mobility conditions, basically lower temperature, ~1000°C. Their TEM data for GaN grown at 1000°C and 1050°C indeed show that in the sample grown at 1050°C most of the TDs run parallel to the growth direction whereas in GaN grown at 1000°C they do not. It is also shown in the ATMI patent that this low temperature layer reduces the formation of cracks. Free-standing GaN with TDs densities of 3xl06cm-2 were obtained following this process.<br>
 <br>
ELO technologies have also been implemented in HVPE, but due to the high growth rate, wide pitch of the ELO openings in masks are required and new dislocations are often generated. HVPE is currently widely used to grow thick GaN layers to be eventually removed from the substrate.<br>
ELO and PE can be achieved by MOVPE, HVPE or even Close Space Vapour Transport (CSVT).<br>
The GaN thick layers should be, at some stage, properly separated from the sapphire substrate; this means without introducing cracks or strain and it must be, at the end, epiready. Several routes for separating the substrate are achievable.<br>
The most straightforward one implies polishing and grinding. This however has proven to be a difficult task.<br>
Laser lift-off (LLO) is a technique for separation of a GaN layer from a apphire substrate by focussing a UV laser beam through the transparent sapphire substrate so that it decomposes a thin GaN region close to the interface to sapphire due to thermal heating, producing liquid Ga and N2 gas. This technology has proven its ability to properly produce 2" free standing GaN.<br>
When ions like H+ are implanted in a semiconductor, a brittle region is created at<br>
a depth which is tuned by the energy of the ions. In Si, under thermal	annealing<br>
the hydrogen atoms create microbubbles of H2 that allows the separation of a thin layer. In GaN, the mechanisms are not yet fully established; however the implantation of hydrogen is used to create a brittle region in an ELO quality GaN/sapphire. The hydrogen implantation does not degrade the quality of the GaN starting layer. Annealing is not carried out at this stage. Conversely, this implanted layer is introduced in a HVPE reactor where a thick layer (several hundred urn) is grown on top. After growth, during cooling, the HVPE layer is separated from the starting template. (WO 03 100 839).<br>
A Ti interlayer between the GaN template and the thick HVPE GaN layer results in the  formation   of tiny  voids  at the  interface   which  allow  an easy separation.<br>
 <br>
A single-crystal silicon-based intermediate layer is deposited on the starting substrate (sapphire). Then this sacrificia] layer is spontaneously vaporised during the Ill-nitride epitaxy step. This produces free standing GaN (WO 05 031 045).<br>
Free standing GaN can be obtained from layers grown by pendeo-epitaxy on weak posts that are configured to crack due to the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the substrate and the GaN layer on the weak posts. (US 6 586 778).<br>
Apart from separation to get free standing GaN wafers several methods have been reported (see for instance US 6 355 497, EP 1 059 662) in which LED structures have been grown on ELO quality GaN laying on Si()2 mask and them separated by chemical etching of the Si02 mask.<br>
The present invention aims to provide a method of manufacturing low dislocation density (
Summary of the invention<br>
To this end, the invention combines ELO technology with an original separation process.<br>
In particular, the invention relates to a method for ihanufacturing a single crystal of nitride by epitaxial growth on a support 100 comprising a growth face, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
formation of a sacrificial bed 101 on the support,<br>
formation of pillars  102 on said sacrificial  bed  101,  said pillars 102 being made<br>
of a material compatible with GaN epitaxial growth,<br>
growth   of  a   nitride   crystal   layer   103   on   the   pillars    102,   under   growing<br>
conditions  such that the nitride  crystal layer  103   does not extend down to the<br>
support in holes formed between the pillars,<br>
removing the nitride crystal layer 103 from the support 10O.<br>
Thus, and as will become clearer in the following, the formation of pillars on a sacrificial bed allows reducing the Threading Dislocations  in the nitride crystal layer.<br>
 <br>
Preferred non-limitative aspects of the semiconductor according to the invention will be described hereafter with reference to figures I la and l1b.<br>
Preferably, each pillar 102 comprises walls 104. In that case the walls 104 are substantially perpendicular to the growth face 105 of the support 100.<br>
It will be understood in the following that a wall is considered as being "perpendicular to the growth face" when the mean plane of the wall is perpendicular to the growth face.<br>
Preferably, the pillars 102 have the same height. However, the pillars 102 may also have different height if needed.<br>
The superior faces 106 of the pillars 102 define a growth face of the pillars 102. Advantageously, the surface of the growth face 106 of the pillars 102 can be above 20% of the overall surface of the growth face 105 of the support 100.<br>
Furthermore, the surface of the growth face 106 of the pillars 102 can be below 80% of the overall surface of the growth face 105 of the support 100.<br>
Preferably, the ratio D/d of the height D of one pillar 102 to the distance d between two adjacent pillars 102 is superior or equal to 1.5, and more preferably superior or equal to 2.<br>
The ratio D/d is preferably chosen in order to avoid the filling of the space between the pillars. In other word, the ratio D/d is chosen such that there remains a hole between the growth face of the support and the nitride cristal layer 103 grown on the pillars 102.<br>
In one embodiment  of the present invention, the pillars 102 are discrete pillars.<br>
Advantageously,   the pillars  102 are uniformly distributed on the support 100.<br>
As mentioned above, the pillars are made of a material compatible with GaN epitaxial groth. This allows reducing the defects in the nitride crystal layer 103. In one embodiment, the pillars are made of GaN.<br>
 <br>
The sacrificial bed 101 can be made of a chemically removable material in order to facilitate the separation of the nitride crystal layer 103. For instance, the sacrificial bed 101 can be made of Si02.<br>
The sacrificial bed 101 can be continuous so that the sacrificial bed 101 covers the total surface of the growth face 105 of the support 100, as shown on figure la.<br>
The sacrificial bed 101 can also be discontinuous so that the sacrificial bed 101 comprises holes 107 extending perpendicularly to the growth face 105 of the support 100, as shown on figure lb.<br>
Preferably, the holes 107 are between the pillars 102, each portion of the discontinuous sacrificial bed 101 being under a respective pillar 102 covering the overall surface of said portion.<br>
The pillars 102 can be formed using different techniques. In a first embodiment, the pillars 102 are formed by;<br>
epitaxial growth of GaN layer on the sacrificial bed,<br>
deposition  of a mask on the GAN layer,  said mask comprising   a plurality of openings,<br>
etching of the GaN layer down to the support in order to form the GaN pillars 102. In a second embodiment, the pillars 102 are formed by: obtaining a GaN layer comprising pillars bonding the pillars on the sacrificial bed, removing the GaN layer extending above the pillars.<br>
In the case of the second embodiment, the step of removing the nitride crystal layer from the support can comprise the chemical etching of the sacrificial bed.<br>
In all cases, the method can comprise a step of deposition of a second sacrificial layer on the bottom of the pillars. This facilitates the removal of the nitride crystal layer 103 from the pillars 102.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention concerns a substrate for manufacturing a single   crystal   of   nitride   by   epitaxial    growth,   said   substrate comprising a support<br>
 <br>
100 and a plurality of pillars 102 on the support 100, wherein said substrate further comprises a sacrificial bed 101 between the support 100 and the pillars 102 as defined above.<br>
The   invention   further   concern   a   semi-conductor    material	comprising    a substrate<br>
and   a   single   crystal    of   nitride    103    on   the   substrate,   wherein    said substrate<br>
comprises a support 100, a sacrificial bed 101 on the support  100, and a plurality of pillars 102 on said sacrificial bed 101 as defined above.<br>

Detailed description<br>
Generalities on the invention<br>
As described above, the method according to the present invention combines ELO technology with an original separation process.<br>
In the method according to the invention, the two-step-ELO technology is first used to  produce   GaN/sapphire   for  further  processing   (as  described   inUS6325850).<br>
However, in the present invention, the masks are made of Si02 or any easily chemically removable selective mask instead of silicon nitride for further easier removal.<br>
The process produces low dislocation density GaN layers in which remaining dislocations are located in the coalescence boundaries, in the middle of the masked area. The thickness of the first ELO layer reaches about 12 um.<br>
 <br>
At this stage, a new mask is deposited on top of the as grown layer.<br>
Then this mask is patterned with opening area exactly aligned on the first openings required for the ELO technology like in the MARELO technology described in W004105108 and illustrated on figure 2A.<br>
Afterwards, deep etching through the openings is carried out by R]E approximately down to the sapphire substrate.<br>
This produces ELO quality GaN pillars that are not directly bond to sapphire, but to chemically removable selective mask.<br>
In another embodiment, the selective mask pattern consists of two dimensional array of openings.<br>
With this mask design, it is possible to remove completely the selective mask after partial or even full coalescence of GaN whereas keeping a coherency strong enough to allow the last HVPE growth. This will be described in details in the example 2.<br>
Before, the second epitaxial growth, the mask is selectively deposited on the bottom of the openings that have been created in the GaN ELO layer, down to the sapphire substrate, as illustrated on figure 2B.<br>
The top mask is eventually removed.<br>
Growth from pillars is carried out by MOVPE. When the top mask has been removed, growth takes place simultaneously from the lateral {11-20} facets and the top (0001) surface of the pillar.<br>
Henceforth several routes can be followed to produce a flat surface:<br>
-	to continue MOVPE growth but change the growth parameters (temperature, pressure, V/III ratio, introduce a surfactant) to enhance lateral growth as well known to the skilled person in the art<br>
-	to transfer this layer as grown in the HVPE reactor<br>
 <br>
-	to keep the triangular stripe structure but to get the MOVPE layer thicker for a further safer transfer in the HVPE reactor.<br>
-	The selective mask remaining on the top of the pillars.<br>
A epitaxial technology able to reach growth rates much higher than MOVPE is thereafter needed to produce layers thick enough in a manageable time.<br>
Therefore, the process further proceeds by growing a continuous crack-free layer on the MOVPE GaN template by Halide Vapour Phase Epitaxy (HVPE), eventually by Close Space Vapour Transport, CSVT) or Liquid Phase Epitaxy.<br>
As described above an object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing thick GaN substrates by HVPE having an extremely low defect density and little warp and bow from the MOVPE layer on pillars.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for the production of thick, crack-free, layers of GaN for subsequent use for homoepitaxy as pseudo-substrates or substrates after separation of the starting non-GaN native substrate.<br>
After having achieved the two-step ELO, the method according to the invention comprises a separation step.<br>
HVPE is carried out until a thickness of at least 200 um is reached.<br>
Separation of the HVPE layer grown from pillars on posts is achieved by chemically etching the mask. Final separation is eventually achieved by lateral cleaving with a blade.<br>
The invention also relates to the epitaxial gallium nitride layers which can be obtained by the processes encompassed within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Advantageously said epitaxial gallium nitride layers have a thickness between 1 um up to 2 cm and are separated from their substrate.<br>
 <br>
The invention further relates to a GaN free standing crystal separated from the substrate which can be obtained by the processes encompassed within the scope of the present invention characterized in that it has a thickness between 10 and 1000 urn but also to a GaN ingot obtained by thickening, by HVPE or CSVT a GaN epitaxial layer obtained by the process according to the present invention.<br>
The present invention also relates to optoelectronic component, especially a diode laser, characterized in that they are provided with an epitaxial layer of gallium nitride as described above.<br>
Growth of ELO GaN<br>
The present invention concerns a process for producing low defect density free standing gallium nitride (GaN) comprising:<br>
-	the deposition   of a GaN layer by MOVPE  on a sapphire   substrate  as described in US 6 802 902 (ULD), (see figure 1A),<br>
-	the deposition   of a first selective mask  with a plurality of first openings forming patterns, (see figures 1B and 1C),<br>
-	a first  regrowth    of a gallium   nitride   layer  on  the   said  mask   under   epitaxial conditions, (see figures ID to IF).<br>
From the figures built from real HRTEM data, it can be noticed that during the first step (Fig. 1D-F, GaN grows in registrery with the GaN template underneath, therefore the Threading Dislocations (TD) propagate mainly parallel to the c axis (growth direction) until they meet the lateral {11-22} facets. Interestingly, they bend at 90° when these TDs meet the lateral facet {11-22} and thereby propagate parallel to the substrate until they reach the coalescence boundaries.<br>
At this stage, a second regrowth of gallium nitride takes place, with growth conditions tuned to enhance lateral growth with respect to the vertical growth so as to induce the deposition of gallium nitride features and anisotropic and lateral growth of said features (see figure 1G to II).<br>
 <br>
TD density is ~ 5xl06cm-2  between coalescence boundaries.<br>
At the end of this first part of the process, an ELO quality epilayer is obtained on a sapphire substrate as described in US 6 325 850 (see figure II). In the coalescence boundary, remaining TD tend to some extend to spread laterally.<br>
Fabrication of GaN pillars on chemically removable selective mask<br>
The next step of the process is the deposition of a second mask with a plurality of second openings forming the same patterns as the first openings exactly above the first ones, providing that the pitch of the pattern of the first openings is the pitch of the second openings (see figure 2A).<br>
Several variations of the pitch pattern are foreseen and will be described in examples.<br>
Vertical grooves are then managed by RIE or equivalent technologies down to the GaN substrate, Fig. 2 B.<br>
After this step ELO quality pillars running parallel to the [1-100] are defined, such pillars are not in direct contact with the starting buffer GaN starting substrate on sapphire but conversely   are   lying  on   a chemically   removable   material.<br>
Eventually, the etching of the GaN epilayer above the first opening can be carried out down to the sapphire substrate.<br>
The top remaining mask is eventually removed by chemical etching, Fig. 2C. In some variations  of the process,  this top mask layer is not necessarily removed.<br>
To avoid polycrystalline deposit of GaN during the HVPE growth step, the mask is selectively deposited on the bottom of the grooves (see figure 20).<br>
At this point, the structure is ready for regrowth by a growth technology like HVPE or CSVT able to provide high growth rate of the order of 100 urn/hour.<br>
 <br>
Growth of GaN epitaxial layers from low dislocation density GaN pillars sitting on selective mask.<br>
During the second epitaxial growth run, which is carried out by MOVPE, GaN growth occurs only on the free GaN surfaces 9.<br>
Since the second growth originates from low dislocation density GaN, no new dislocations are generated. This MOVPE growth step is pursued until full coalescence of laterally grown GaN from the side of the pillars, whether or not the surface is flat. Fig. 3 A,B,C, D<br>
After getting coalescence, to get a usable free standing GaN layer, HVPE growth is used to get a convenient growth rate. This HVPE growth is carried out until at least a 300 um layer is achieved.<br>
After cool down, the mask is etched off chemically, thus separating the thick layer from the starting substrate.<br>
Henceforth a low dislocation density free standing GaN is obtained with TD density 
After appropriate polishing such a free standing GaN will be ready to be use as a substrate for the growth of device structures, or a seed substrate to grow an ingot.<br>
In another embodiment, the selective mask at the bottom of the pillars and     protective layers are removed before full coalescence<br>
Growth conditions are used to end up with triangular stripes covering the pillar until full coalescence (see figure 4A).<br>
At the end of this growth, the surface appears as a perfected ordered array of triangular stripes.<br>
 <br>
This method further proceeds by growing a continuous crack-free layer on the MOVPE GaN template by Halide Vapour Phase Epitaxy (HVPE), eventually by Close Space Vapour Transport, CSVT} or even Liquid Phase Epitaxy (LPE)<br>
Fourth HVPE regrowth and separation<br>
The as previously described structures, i.e, ELO quality GaN pillars lying on the selective mask are introduced in a HVPE reactor able to hold six 2" wafers. Regrowth is carried out in epitaxial conditions.<br>
This method further proceeds by growing a continuous crack-free layer on the MOVPE GaN template by Halide Vapour Phase Epitaxy (HVPE), eventually by Close Space Vapour Transport, CSVT) or Liquid Phase Epitaxy (LPE)<br>
To be used as an epiready 2" wafer, the separated HVPE thick layer is lapped and polished using technologies well known by the person skilled in the art.<br>
In the coming examples, 2" wafers were used. However, the method is scalable to much wider diameters of starting substrates.<br>
Example 1<br>
The method of manufacturing such substrates comprises several steps as schematically shown on figures 1 and 2:<br>
Epitaxial growth is carried out using preferably by Metal Organic Vapour Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE) for the fabrication of GaN pillars, even though other vapour phase epitaxy techniques such as Halide Vapour Phase Epitaxy (HVPE) and close space Vapour Phase transport (CSVT, also refereed as sublimation)  can also be used.<br>
The substrate 1 generally has a thickness of a few hundred um (in particular approximately 300 jam) and may be chosen from the group consisting of sapphire, ZnO, 6H-SiC, 4H-SiC, 3C-SiC, Si, LiGa02, LiAI02, MgAI204, ZrB2, GaAs, HfB2, AIN, GaN, and advantageously is sapphire (0001).<br>
 <br>
The following paragraphs are directed to a preferred process to produce the GaN layer 3.<br>
This process for producing a layer of gallium nitride (GaN) is remarkable in that it comprises the deposition on a substrate of a silicon nitride layer functioning as a nanomask and the growth of GaN on the masked substrate under epitaxial deposition conditions so as to induce the deposition of gallium nitride features and the anisotropic growth being continued until coalescence of the various features. The term "islands" or "features" may also be employed.<br>
The gaseous vehicle is a mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen in equal proportions. The ammonia is introduced together with the silane, in a form diluted to 50 ppm in hydrogen.<br>
Under these conditions, the typical NH3 and SiH4 reaction time ranging from 60 to 360seconds.<br>
The successive steps are monitored by laser reflectometry (LR). After the silicon nitride layer has been formed, a continuous gallium nitride layer having a thickness of 20 to 30 nm is deposited on it. The deposition of the GaN layer is made at a low temperature, of the order of 600°C.<br>
After the deposition of the GaN layer has been completed, it is annealed at     a   high<br>
temperature of the order of 1080°C. Under the combined effect of the temperature rise, of the presence in the gaseous vehicle of a sufficient amount of hydrogen and of the presence of the very thin SiN film beneath the GaN layer and also the antisurfactant effect of silicon, the morphology of said GaN layer undergoes deep modification resulting from solid-phase recrystallization by mass transport.<br>
When the temperature approaches 1060° C, the reflectivity of the buffer layer suddenly decreases. The initially continuous buffer layer is then converted into a discontinuous layer formed from gallium nitride pyramids.<br>
 <br>
At the end of this spontaneous in situ recrystallization process, GaN features or islands of very good crystal quality are obtained, these retaining an epitaxial relationship with the substrate by virtue of the very small thickness of the SiN layer.<br>
During the subsequent epitaxial regrowth with gallium nitride, the GaN features or islands develop by lateral and vertical growth. GaN layers 3 have thus been obtained by full coalescence of the GaN features having a defect density of the order of 10   cm' .<br>
A Si02 mask 4 is then deposited on such a GaN layer. Linear apertures um in width and spaced apart by 7 um are then made in the mask in order to expose the regions of the subjacent layer. The linear apertures 5 are advantageously oriented in the GaN [1-100] direction, although the variant of the process described in this example can be optionally carried out for other orientations of the linear apertures, especially in the GaN [11-20] direction.<br>
The epitaxial regrowth is carried out on the exposed regions 6 with unintentionally doped GaN under operating conditions such that the growth rate in the [0001] direction of the GaN features sufficiently exceeds the growth rate in the direction normal to the inclined flanks of said features. Under such conditions, the anisotropy of the growth results in the disappearance of the (0001) facet.<br>
The first implementation step of the process is completed when the (0001) facet of the GaN feature has fully disappeared. At the end of the first step, the GaN features are in the form of a stripe with {11-22} lateral facets, the cross section of which is triangular.<br>
However, it is possible to continue the first step until coalescence of the GaN features, in order to completely cover the mask and even to pursue the growth in these conditions.<br>
The next step consists of the epitaxial regrowth, with experimental conditions chosen as to enhance lateral growth. In these new experimental conditions, the facet (0001) reappears at the top of each of the GaN features obtained in the first step.  During   this   step, the   GaN  features   develop   with  an expansion   of the  facet<br>
 <br>
(0001) and, conversely, a reduction in the area of the flanks. This effect is obtained by increasing the temperature up to 1150°C or decreaising ^ operating pressure, or increasing the V/III ratio in the vapour phase or even adding adding Mg, Sb or Bi in the vapour phase. The second step of the process according to the example is completed when the flanks have disappeared, the upper surface of the deposit formed by the coalesced doped-GaN features then being flat.(see figure 1 I)-<br>
Because of the bending at 90° of the TDs, the upper surface formed by the coalescence of the GaN features is virtually free of emerging defects in regions compatible with the size of electronic devices, such as GaN diode lasers. Remaining TDs appear on the coalescence boundaries.<br>
Such a process produces  GaN with TDs 
On the top surface of this ELO quality template, a second mask 8 is deposited exactly above the first one.<br>
The first mask layer 4 and the second mask layer 8 {see figure 2A) are constituted of silicon oxyde deposited by CVD. Each of the masks has a plurality of openings extending in the GaN [1-100] direction (perpendicular of the drawing of figure 2).<br>
In each of the first mask layer 4 and the second masK 8, a width for the mask area is for instance 2-5 jam and a pitch for example 5-15 urn. The mask and tne pitch are identical between the first and the second mask respectively-<br>
Deep etching down to the first mask 4 level or even deeper is achieved by RIE (see figure 2B), thus creating {11-20} facets 9.<br>
Eventually a thick Si02 deposit 10 is achieved on the bottom of the grooves to avoid a polycrystalline GaN deposit during the next growth step.<br>
After removing the top mask 8 (see figure 2C), the Pillar structure is introduced once again in the MOVPE reactor. The growth conditions are tuned to enhance lateral growth like in [0000].<br>
 <br>
Growth simultaneously starts from the top facets and the lateral {11-20} facets (see figures 3A-3B). Since the pillars were grooved in high quality ELO GaN, no new dislocation is generated. The only remaining dislocations come from the coalescence boundaries 11, which propagate in the growing GaN.<br>
When the process further proceeds (see figure 3C), GaN grown from lateral facets extends down to the bottom of the grooves. TD 12 are eventually formed when two triangular stripes coalesce (see figure 3D).<br>
In these growth conditions, the triangular stripe structure remains unless growth parameters are changed.<br>
It has to be noticed that the triangular growth allows limiting the TDs due to the first growth since the TDs bend by 90° to adopt a direction along the (0001) basal plane so that they propagate. After bending, most of the dislocations have a line parallel to [1-210] which extends to the coalescence boundary 12 with the overgrown GaN coming from the adjacent stripe. The boundary 12 is therefore an area of defect accumulation.<br>
Figure 4A shows a cross sectional SEM image of such an array. Such material that grows from almost dislocation free GaN pillars keeps the high crystallographic quality of the pillars.<br>
Panchromatic cathodoluminescence (CL) image shows that material grown on the lateral<br>
{11-22}  facets  on top  of the pillars exhibit high  luminescence      intensity  as<br>
expected from growth on lateral facets. Actually O incorporation in these lateral facets is enhanced therefore resulting on high CL emission,  (see figure 4B).<br>
A full understanding of the growth process from pillars is provided by wavelength resolved cross sectional cathodo luminescence.<br>
Figure 5 displays such data where the hole created between stripes is easily recognizable together with two lateral pillars grown by the two step ELO process by a single narrow CL peak corresponding to 12 (donor bound exciton).<br>
 <br>
As growth further proceeds from lateral facets, enhanced incorporation of O results in broadening of the CL emission. After coalescence, the CL peak get narrower and the 12 emission corresponds to fully relaxed GaN. In addition, due to the high quality of material, the free exciton A emission appears.<br>
Alternatively, growth conditions may be changed after growth of several um to get a flat surface.<br>
At this stage, low dislocations density (
HVPE thick layers<br>
To get a useable free standing wafer, a thickness of at least 300 um should be reached; such a thickness is not achievable by MOVPE. Therefore, another growth technology must be implemented to get the appropriate thickness and to scatter the TDs from the coalescence boundaries and further decrease the TD density.<br>
The deposition of GaN in accordance with the present invention for thick layers growth is advantageously carried out by a high growth rate vapour phase epitaxy HVPE) technique.<br>
The invention provides an HVPE nitride growth reactor, which is particularly designed for growth of GaN thick epitaxial films. More specifically, this HVPE reactor allows holding 6x2" wafers on a rotating susceptor.<br>
The reactor is configured in a resistively heated furnace tube in the conventional<br>
manner, with the furnace being vertically oriented. The reactor provides two<br>
distinct parts, namely, one for the GaCI synthesis, and the other for the growth. With<br>
this configuration, GaCI is formed in situ upstream of the growth	chamber,	into<br>
which it is then delivered. In the growth chamber, a susceptor supports up to 6 GaN/sapphire templates on which the epitaxial layer is to be grown. GaCI is delivered to the growth chamber in the vicinity of the susceptor to achieve the growth process. NH3 is also delivered in the vicinity of the susceptor in such a way that premature mixing with GaCI is avoided.<br>
 <br>
The HVPE process is a chemical vapour deposition method carried out in a hot wall<br>
reactor. The gallium precursor, gallium monochloride GaCl employed in the deposition<br>
process is formed within the reactor, upstream from the GaN/sapphire<br>
templates, by the reaction of HCI with liquid Ga, at high temperature. GaCl<br>
is then transported by a carrier gas to the substrate downstream in the reactor<br>
where it reacts with NH3 at a temperature between 800-1200°C	to        form GaN,<br>
via      the      reaction: GaCl +NH3→ GaN+HCI+H2.<br>
In HVPE growth of GaN, Ga metal can be readily obtained with a purity of more than 99.9999% and with a properly designed gas delivery system, HCI gas with purity more than 99.99% purity can be provided using an appropriate in line getter.<br>
To obtain desirable high throughput with acceptable overall process duration, growth rates in excess of 50 um/hr are advantageously employed. Growth is beneficially carried out at temperatures between about 900 and about 1150°C.<br>
To get the best quality GaN by HVPE, a technology involving multiple bending of TDs is implemented.<br>
However, other options are also feasible like remaining at constant temperature<br>
(high temperature to get a flat surface, moderate temperature to keep     the	triangular<br>
stripe array until completion of the thick layer growth)<br>
The MOVPE/sapphire templates are introduced in a multiwafer HVPE reactor operating at low pressure, without any further technological step like cleaning or etching. The morphology of the GaN/sapphire starting template appears as an array of triangular stripes as shown in figure 3D.<br>
Preferentially, the growth conditions are changed at the end of the HVPE growth to get a flat surface with Ga polarity.<br>
After cooling down under NH3 atmosphere, the composite substrate is ready for preparing a free standing epiready wafer.<br>
 <br>
The perimeter of the substrate is chamfrained to remove polycrystalline deposit, thus allowing the buried Si02 mask to be chemically etched.<br>
The as chamfrained composite substrate is immersed in an HF solution overnight.<br>
Si02 dissolves starting from the perimeter and finally the sapphire substrate separates and can eventually re-used.<br>
The MOVPE layer is removed by lapping and the final free standing GaN is polished using technologies well known by persons in the field.<br>
Additionally, impurities (doping species, surfactants, transition metal) can be added during growth of the thick GaN layer and thereby allow the production of n-type, p-type or semi-insulating GaN wafers.<br>
Figures 6A to 6D show the morphological evolution of the GaN layer during the HVPE growth and Figure 7 schematically illustrates the different steps to get the epiready GaN wafer.<br>
Such a free standing GaN wafer present TDs densities 
Example 2<br>
In example 2 however, after grooving the stripes to form pillars, the top mask 8 is not removed. Growth is allowed to restart in MOVPE.<br>
As expected, growth starts from the {11-20} facets resulting from the RIE groove to finally coalescence into triangular stripes with {11-22} lateral facets as in example 1. The Figure 8 schematically shows the evolution of the facets structure ad growth proceeds.<br>
 <br>
At this stage, the structure is introduced in the multiwater HVPE reactor and growth takes place according one of the variations described in example 1. After all the technological processes described in example 1, a free standing GaN wafer presenting TDs densities 
Example 3<br>
In example 3 the mask pattern for both the ELO process and the groove of pillars is a two dimensional array of hexagons (see figure 9A). The ELO GaN is grown as in example 1. When the first step of MOVPE ELO is achieved, a second mask consisting in an array of hexagons as shown in figure 9A is deposited exactly above the first one. Afterward RIE etching, a "honeycomb" structure is formed (see figure 8B). Conversely to previous examples, at this stage, etching can be achieved, at least partially, from the top surface. This will make the final separation easier.<br>
These MOVPE/sapphire templates are introduced in a multiwafer HVPE reactor operating at low pressure, and the rest of the process follows previous examples. After all the technological processes described in example 1, a free standing GaN wafer presenting TDs densities 
Example 4<br>
In example 4, other arrays of openings are used. Fig.10. Among them, asymmetric openings are used, thus allowing a multiple bending of TDs at Other mask design.<br>
It will be appreciated that many changes can be made to the embodiment as described above within the scope of the invention. For instance, figures 11a and l1b shows pillars comprising superior faces parallel to the growth face 105 of the support 100. However, the present invention is not limited to pillars comprising a superior face parallel to the growth face 105 of the support 100. The pillars may comprise rounding superior face or sawtooth superior face or triangular superior face.<br>
