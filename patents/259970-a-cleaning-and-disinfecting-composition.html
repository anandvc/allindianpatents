				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a liquid cleansing composition having an anti-viral and/or antibacterial action. More particularly, but not exclusively, it relates to a surface cleansing composition having both anti-viral and anti-bacterial activity.<br>
Background<br>
There is. an ever expanding number of household products such as handwashes and domestic cleaning sprays professing to provide anti-bacterial properties. Often these products claim to eliminate work surfaces and the like of all known bacteria. Such claims are typically misleading at best. Widely reported research has shown that many of these currently available products are no better at reducing the onset of coughs, colds or other such infections or ailments than thoroughly washing one hands or cleaning the work surfaces. Indeed many such infections or aliments are caused by viruses which currently available anti-bacterial products are unable to combat, despite what they purport to achieve.<br>
There is also an increasing concern about bacterial and viral infections being transmitted to patients and staff in hospitals and the like. One vector of infection is believed to be incompletely disinfected surfaces, which may harbour bacteria and/or viruses that are resistant to existing surface cleaning agents. There is a strong suspicion that the spread of the recent SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak may have been linked to the ability of the SARS virus to resist conventional cleaning agents/disinfectants. Viruses spread from an infected patient thus remain viable and ready to be picked up by and to infect other patients and medical staff. Other pathogens, such as the MRSA bacterium, are also suspected to be surviving existing surface cleaning/disinfecting agents and routines.<br>
It is known to use cationic surfactants, such as quaternary ammonium salts, as dual-purpose surface cleaning agents and bactericides. However, while such materials are generally found to be sufficient to deal with, say, food-poisoning bacteria in a food preparation environment, they are not regarded as sufficiently active to handle more dangerous and more resistant pathogens in a medical context.<br><br>
Alcohols, such as iso-propanol, and halogens, such as iodine, have in the past been used individually as relatively crude disinfecting agents around wounds and skin lesions, but they have not proven suitable for wide area cleaning of hard surfaces and the like. For example, iodine can stain many surfaces, and its use at high concentrations is limited by safety considerations.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a liquid cleansing and disinfecting preparation, suitable for use on hard surfaces, with a high anti-viral and anti-bacterial effectiveness.<br>

Specific Embodiments<br>
In order to allow the present invention to be more readily understood an embodiment of the invention will now be described more particularly by way of example only, and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Fig.1 shows a graph of the composition of the present invention's activity against Polio RNA;<br>
Fig. 2 shows the chemical structure of the long-chain alkyl polyamine of the present invention. An aqueous surface cleaning composition was prepared, comprising:<br>
NTA 89% powder	0.85 kg<br>
Ethanol	15.0 litres<br>
n-Propanol	6.0 litres<br>
Topanol O FG	0.55 litres<br>
Sandoteric SC	2.42 litres<br>
Sandozin NRW cone	6.95 litres<br>
Sandoteric ABD	4.45 litres<br>
Triameen Y12D-30	19.99 litres<br>
Deionised water	43.4524 litres<br>
Iodine (solid)	0.3376 kg<br>
The composition appeared as a pale yellow clear liquid with a pH of approximately 8 and a slight alcoholic odour.<br>
NTA is nitrilotriacetic acid trisodium salt, a buffering agent. Topanol O FG is food-grade butylated hydroxytoluene, an antioxidant, sold by Chance &amp; Hunt Ltd. (Topanol is a registered trade mark of ICI pic). Sandozin NRW conc is a polyethoxylate ether sold by Clariant as a wetting agent. It also forms a relatively stable complex with iodine. Sandoteric SC is a sulphobetaine amphoteric surfactant, which acts as a detergent, and Sandoteric ABD is a complex mixture of amphoteric surfactants acting as a detergent and having a degree of bactericidal activity. Both are sold by Clariant. (Sandozin and Sandoteric are registered trade marks of Novartis SA).<br>
Triameen Y12D-30 is a long-chain alkyl triamine of the general formula H2N(CH2)3 - NR - (CH2)3 NH2, where R' is a "tallow alkyl" - a naturally-derived mixture of alkyl chains of different lengths, the most common of which is a dodecyl chain. It is sold by Akzo Nobel.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates the hypothesised structure of the long-chain alkyl triamine. It is possible that the activity of this molecule is located on the NH2 groups, the iodine being monotonically bonded to the nitrogen yet accessible toward DNA or RNA. The nucleotides of the DNA or RNA may then be liganded by addition to phosphatide groupings by the presence of the iodated amine group. Thus, the iodine radical may be free to roam on the molecule and as there is partial addition thereof, there is competition for valencey fulfilment.<br>
Although the mechanism of attack on bacterium is not fully understood, it is expected that in a suitably buffered solution the long-chain alkyl triamine forms a cationic species. Together with the surfactant(s), preferably amphoteric in nature, the triamine attacks the phospholipid membranes which form the outer wall of a bacterium. In most cases, these membranes are ruptured or lysed, leading to release of the bacterium's DNA. It is possible that the complexed halogen and the alcohol(s) act in conjunction on the DNA, effectively complexing with the DNA or RNA. The triamine and the surfactant(s) are believed to attack bacterial DNA and bind to critical parts of the helix preventing it from replicating. The alcohol(s) may also contribute to the attack on the membranes.<br>
Even where the membranes are not sufficiently damaged to release their contents for destruction, the composition is found to inactivate the bacterium for prolonged periods (at least 14 days in current testing, much longer than for current cleaners/disinfectants).<br>
Turning to the mechanism of attack on viruses, similarly this mechanism is also not fully understood. However it is again expected that the cationic triamine formed in a suitably buffered solution attacks the outer wall of the capsid of the virus in conjunction with the surfactant(s), which are preferably amphoteric in nature. It is possible that these structures are ruptured or lysed as a consequence of the attack, leading to release of the viral DNA or RNA. The complexed halogen and the alcohol(s) are believed to act in conjunction on viral DNA or by bonding or associating themselves with parts of the viral RNA. Additionally the triamine and the surfactant(s) are also believed to attack the viral DNA or RNA by binding to critical parts of the helix. The result of the attack(s) on the viral DNA or RNA is the inhibition of the DNA or RNA's ability to replicate. The alcohol(s) may also contribute to the attack on the membranes, particularly the outer viral phospholipid envelope, present in some but not all DNA/RNA viruses.<br>
Alternatively, rather than the viral capsid being ruptured or lysed by the attack of the buffered cationic triamine and the surfactant(s), it is possible that the attack results in the binding to surface structures, blocking and inactivating viral receptors. The result of this attack being the inhibition of infectivity, thus preventing the virus spreading to other cells. It is possible that halogen and the alcohol(s) take some part in the attack of the viral capsid membrane.<br>
Regardless of the mechanism, the combined action of the components of the composition is the break up and destruction of a majority of the organism and/or the inhibition of any viruses or bacteria for prolonged periods. The composition also has a conventional detergent/cleansing effect, removing macroscopic soiling from a surface to which it is applied, as well as washing off inhibited bacteria or viruses as well as the associated debris of the destroyed organism. The composition has been found to have minimal deleterious effect on the surfaces tested, and does not stain surfaces as would conventional formulations containing similar levels of halogen, particularly iodine.<br>
As already mentioned, the mechanism of virucidal action by a composition of the present invention is not clearly understood. From the constituents present in the composition, it is suspected that the alcohol denatures proteins, and the quaternary ammonium compound(s) bind to anionic phosphate groups and fatty acid chains in phospholipids. Both mechanisms damage the microbial membranes. The halogen may modify structural proteins and may inhibit enzymes through halogenation of amino acids in proteins.<br>
Through experimentation, various naked virus or purified animal deoxy-ribose nucleic acid (DNA) samples can be treated with the composition. An interaction takes place, so that when placed in an electric field under gel electrophoresis, a DNA smear is produced instead of the expected DNA ladder of normal integrity, indicating alteration of the ionisation characteristics of DNA. If the same composition /virus or composition/animal DNA mixture is extracted with a mixture of<br>
phenol/chloroform, the composition itself is broken down, and the full DNA electrophoretic pattern will be restored with normal integrity. This data indicates that the DNA (viral or animal DNA) is not degraded during the treatment with the composition, but that the composition interaction with viral or animal DNA alters the normal DNA structural and ionic integrity.<br>
The interaction between the composition was further investigated for its affect on viral particles and viral ribose nucleic acid (RNA) and Fig.1 illustrates the observed activity. Through experimentation where the composition (1 part in 10 parts water) as 9 part diluted composition and 1 part poliovirus vaccine (final 1000 copies /ml) for periods of 5,15, 30 and 60 minutes, followed by extraction, using QIAGEN silicon columns (QIAGEN incorporates a protease step for protein degradation), prior to complimentary deoxy-ribose nucleic acid (cDNA) synthesis and DNA amplification, (with detection of nucleic acid product in a in-house real-time Lightcycler quantitative RNA assay), reductions in the RNA viral load can be seen from 1000 copies to 50, 50, 10, and 10 copies respectively-(reductions of 95%, 95%, 99%, 99%), compared to 1000,1000,1000,1000 copies/ml respectively in water control samples. The experiment was repeated with composition / virus incubations of 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes, as previously stated, but RNA extraction performed with a phenol/chloroform procedure (once with phenol, once with 1:1 phenol and chloroform, and once with chloroform rather than by the QIAGEN extraction method), RNA detection will be detected at 1000, 1000,1000, and 1000 copies respectively (no reduction in RNA load).<br>
The experiments demonstrate that the composition does not degrade RNA over the periods of 1-60 minutes, but that an interaction occurs between the composition and poliovirus/poliovirus RNA. This interaction inhibits protease action (active in the QIAGEN process) to cleave composition peptides that would normally release RNA, or alters naked RNA ionically, so that RNA cannot then be further captured and amplified in the test. The result is a low recovery of RNA, and will appear as a low copy number in the assay. The effect of the composition -virus interaction is removed during the chemical extraction with phenol. It can be concluded that the composition is not destructive to viral capsids, but inhibits enzymatic cleavage of the capsid, and requires further stringent chemical extraction to achieve release of the nucleic acid. The QIAGEN effect illustrated here is a consistent effect and has been replicated for other RNA and DNA viruses including Adenovirus, BK virus and Norovirus, and appears to be a plausible mechanism of virucidal activity, whereby the altered viral structure is resistance to physiological and enzymatic attack.<br>
It can therefore finally concluded that both viral DNA and viral RNA is not degraded by treatment with the composition. However, the composition interacts with the viral capsid and prevents enzymatic cleavage.   Although the process of virus uncoating involves different mechanisms for different virus groups, they all require the viral capsid to have structural and ionic integrity and be susceptible to cellular physiological processes that allow it to pass into and through the host cell, and interact with cellular structures and enzyme systems. The changes induced by the composition on viral structures are likely to prevent this process and account for its virucidal activity.<br>
It is hypothesised that compositions with higher levels of halogen may be useful in some applications, although alterations to the other components, such as raised amounts of alcohol(s), may then be needed for stability.<br>
The composition also has a degree of activity against fungi, moulds and yeasts, although it is believed that a modified formulation, for example with an alternative alcohol blend, might be required for full effectiveness against the tougher walls of fungal spore cells and the like.<br>
Testing has shown that the composition passes the standard "555-challenge" test (see British Standard BS EN 1276:1997 and the French Afnortest). As an effective anti-viral and anti- bacterial cleansing agent, it may be categorised as a (2) category disinfectant in the system employed by the UK National Health Service, suitable for cleaning in "medium high risk" areas.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
