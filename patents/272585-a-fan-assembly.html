				<td>PLENUM/PLUG FAN ASSEMBLY<br>
This is an international regular application filed under 35<br>
U.S.C. ยง363 claiming priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง119(e)(l), of<br>
provisional application Serial No. 60/604,571 having a filing<br>
date of August 26, 2004.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention generally relates to air moving<br>
assemblies, more particularly, to plenum/plug fan assemblies<br>
which boost static pressure/dynamic efficiency, and further<br>
provide noise reduction, both broadband and tone components<br>
thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Relatively inexpensive plenum or plug-type fans are well<br>
known in the industrial and commercial fan industry. They are<br>
commonly sold as an unhoused fan unit by the manufacturers<br>
;<br>
although they are mounted in a suitable support structure that<br>
can include a front wall with an air inlet opening formed<br>
therein. These fans are used instead of, or to replace,<br>
centrifugal type fans which are commonly used in the air handling<br>
industry. The wheel of the plenum fan is used to pressurize a<br>
surrounding air plenum or housing in which the fan is installed.<br>
A number of air ducts can be connected to the housing and these<br>
can extend from any direction. In addition to being a reasonably<br>
Inexpensive fan structure, a. plenum or plug fan unit can. save<br>
space by eliminating a, special fan housing, transitions and<br>
diffusers commonly characterizing centrifugal air handling<br>
system. When required, two or more of these fans can be mounted<br>
side-by-side on common or separate support frames.<br>
A common and well known difficulty of plug or plenum fans<br>
is that they can be inefficient in their operation and noisy<br>
compared to other types of fans. Furthermore, such assemblies are<br>
known to require considerably more electrical power for operation<br>
of the one or more fans than more efficient units that produce<br>
the same amount of or more air flow. With respect to the noise;<br>
problem, it is noted that with many known plug type fans, low<br>
frequency noises are generally produced, and there is no<br>
currently available and practical solution to the noise problem.<br>
Traditionally, noise reduction in air moving assemblies has been<br>
achieved at the cost of dynamic performance, via the inclusion,<br>
of dissipative silencers. Such silencers typically comprise<br>
i<br>
acoustically lined fan housings, ducting, etc. In an air handling<br>
system, such structures create a static pressure drop which<br>
results in a lowered static efficiency. Furthermore, dissipative<br>
silencers are ill suited to reduce or eliminate the tone<br>
component of sound, namely, blade pass frequency tone.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,749,702 (Datta et al.) describes, among<br>
other things, a fixed center body for axially directing air flow<br>
to and within a bladed fan wheel having an annular air outlet.<br>
The center body extends through the axial .air intake, and<br>
radially expands rearwardly, terminating at an end at the back<br>
of the fan wheel, close to the rear plate thereof. Both inlet and<br>
outlet structures, including the center body, incorporate sound<br>
attenuating material for broadband noise reduction. Increased fan<br>
wheel efficiency is alleged as attributable to a solid curved<br>
rear end section of the center body, which redirects air flow in<br>
a radial direction towards the annular outlet of the fan wheel.<br>
Furthermore, a wall, spaced from a fixed sidewall or front wall<br>
of a fan support structure so as to be positioned behind the fan<br>
wheel, is further provided. The additional wall is preferably<br>
filled with sound attenuating material, and more preferably<br>
still, has a perforated front surface facing the back plate of<br>
the fan wheel.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,426,268 (Yazici et al.) describes combined<br>
utilization of air duct inlet and outlet silencer apparatuses for<br>
an air handling system. Both apparatuses include interior walls,<br>
arranged between interior and exterior wall's thereof, comprised<br>
of sound attenuating material, with at least portions of the<br>
interior walls constructed of perforated metal sheets. In the<br>
outlet duct apparatus, the main passageway is substantially<br>
straight and increases in transverse cross-section from the inlet<br>
to the outlet. The transverse cross-section changes from circular<br>
at the end of the passageway adjacent the fan to rectangular at<br>
the opposite end.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,066,194 (Amr et al.) describes a fan orifice<br>
structure intended for use in conjunction with an outside<br>
enqlosure, usually containing a heat exchanger and compressor of<br>
an ait conditioner. The orifice is defined by an annular curved<br>
surface that extends downwardly from a top wall of the cover. The<br>
curved surface is generated by rotating a planar and curvilinear<br>
line about a coplanar axis of generation. It is said that the<br>
contour -of the orifice enhances fan efficiency and reduces<br>
radiated noise. The orifice cover is made from plastic materials<br>
by a molding process.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,576,549 (Lanier) is generally directed to<br>
a centrifugal fan having a plurality of vortex generators fixed<br>
onto the outer wall of an annular member leading into an air<br>
inlet of the fan wheel. An inlet cone is shown as a concave<br>
annular form tapered inwardly from the larger diameter air inlet<br>
in the fan wheel plate. Vortex generators are shown as formed<br>
plates having lateral edges contoured to fit the curved annular<br>
wall of the inlet cone. It is believed that such structures, so<br>
arranged, permit merger of skin friction induced air current with<br>
the lower velocity air being discharged from the rotating fan<br>
wheel blades .<br>
As is readily appreciated, it remains advantageous to<br>
provide a fan unit which is simple to build and construct which<br>
employs a bladed fan wheel haying an. axial air intake and an<br>
annular air outlet,- and at least "one outlet diffuser for -<br>
directing airflow from the fan wheel such that static efficiency<br>
is improved, and noise is greatly reduced. It is further<br>
advantageous to enhance the noise reduction capabilities of fan<br>
assemblies for air handling systems, more particularly, both the<br>
broadband and tone aspects thereof.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fan silencers have traditionally achieved noise reductiot<br>
at the expense of a static pressure drop resulting in an increase<br>
in power input to the fan, and consequently lowering its static<br>
efficiency. The subject invention achieves noise reduction by<br>
boosting the static pressure and -static efficiency. Principles<br>
of dissipative silencer design have beenx employed for both the<br>
fan wheel inlet and outlet. Outlet or discharge considerations<br>
included principles of aerodynamic vane-less diffuser design.<br>
In a first embodiment, a rear (hub) diffuser element, e.g.,<br>
ring, is utilized adjacent the back plate of the fan wheel. The<br>
subject rear diffuser ring, as well as structures of the further<br>
embodiments, are readily, and preferably, but not necessarily,<br>
adapted for enhanced sound attenuation as xwill later โข be<br>
discussed.<br>
In a further embodiment, a specially configured front<br>
(shroud) diffuser element, e.g., ring, is utilized, more<br>
generally, a structure which slows, the air discharge velocity<br>
from the fan wheel/fan unit, is provided. In yet a further<br>
embodiment, an inlet diffuser^is provide to selectively guide air<br>
flow into the fan wheel, preferably,, but hot necessarily, the<br>
inlet diffuser incorporates a blade pass frequency (BPF) tuned<br>
resonator. More specific features and advantages obtained in view <br>
of those features will become apparent with reference to the<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As a preliminary matter, fan assemblies 10 of the subject<br>
invention are generally shown in FIGS. 1 &amp; 4, the assembly of<br>
FIG. 4 including features of the assembly of FIG. 1, e.g., a rear<br>
or hub diffusing structure 12, modified features of the assembly<br>
of FIG. 1, e.g., an alternately configured front or shroud<br>
diffusing structure 14, and supplemental select advantageous<br>
features, e.g., a mid-span diffusing structure 16 and/or an air<br>
inlet diffusing structure 18 optionally having an inlet &gt;tuned<br>
resonator section 20. Features of the assembly of FIG. 1 are<br>
further illustrated in FIGS. 2 &amp; 3, and features of the assembly<br>
of FIG. 4 are selectively illustrated in FIGS. 5 &amp; 6. Finally,<br>
aero-acoustic performance of the assembly of the subject<br>
invention in relation to conventional known fan wheel/fan<br>
assemblies is presented in FIGS. 7 &amp; 8 vis-a-vis comparative<br>
representations of both static efficiency and specific sound<br>
power. ,<br>
With reference now to FIGS. 1 &amp; 4, preferred and optional<br>
assemblies of the subject invention, shown or otherwise,<br>
generally include a fan wheel 22 and a frame or base 24 within<br>
which or on which the fan wheel 22 is supported for rotation,<br>
more particularly, rotation about a central axis 26 thereof, such<br>
arrangements being conventional and well known to plenum/plug fan<br>
artisans. The fan wheel 22 generally has an axial air inlet 28,<br>
delimited by an air inlet cone 30 forwardly supported by the<br>
frame 24, an annular air outlet 32, a back 'plate 34, a front<br>
WO 2006/026295 PCT/US2005/030082<br>
plate 36 spaced apart or opposite the back plate 34, and several<br>
blades 38 disposed between the plates 34, 36.<br>
The assembly 10 further includes rear or hub diffusing<br>
structure 12, i.e., a first air outlet diffusing structure or<br>
element, (e.g., a ring, or fractions thereof, i.e., ' halves,<br>
thirds, quarters, etc. as will later be described), depending .or<br>
otherwise supported by the frame 24, or a portion thereof,<br>
adjacent the back plate 34 of the fan wheel 32,x and front or<br>
shroud diffusing structure 14, i.e., a second air outlet<br>
diffusing element (e.g., a ring, or fractions thereof, i.e.,<br>
halves, thirds, quarters, etc. as will later be described),<br>
depending or otherwise supported by the frame 24, or portion<br>
thereof, adjacent the front plate 36 of the fan wheel 32. As<br>
will later be detailed, each of the first and second air outlet<br>
diffusing structures include a peripheral region or segment 40,<br>
air exiting the annular air outlet 32 of the fan wheel 32 passing<br>
between the peripheral regions 40 of the diffusing elements 12,<br>
14.<br>
With particular reference to FIG. 4, the assembly of FIG.<br>
1, or variants thereof, advantageously, but not necessarily, may<br>
furthet, selectively include mid-span diffusing structure 16, air<br>
inlet diffusing structure or assembly. 18, or both in combination<br>
as illustrated. The mid-span diffusing structure 16, i.e., a<br>
third air outlet diffusing element (e.g., a ring, or fractions<br>
thereof, i.e., halves, thirds, quarters, etc. as.will later be<br>
described), depends or is otherwise supported by the frame 24,<br>
or portion thereof, intermediate the first 12 and second 14<br>
diffusing structures. The assembly of the subject invention<br>
advantageously includes such mid-span element when the fan wheel<br>
diameter D exceeds about twenty inches.<br>
The air inlet diffusing assembly 18 (FIGS. 4 &amp; 5),<br>
optionally equipped with inlet tuned resonator 20 (FIG. 4),<br>
depends or is otherwise supported by the frame 24 so as to extend<br>
i<br>
from a forward portion thereof, more particularly and preferably,<br>
to extend therefrom in a spaced apart relationship with the air<br>
inlet cone 30, so as to define or delimit a circumferential air<br>
ingress passage 42 for the assembly generally.<br>
Prior to a further or more developed discussion of the air<br>
outlet diffusing structures, it is to be appreciated that in<br>
addition to prospective air handling applications, select<br>
structures of the assembly described herein (e.g., one or more<br>
of the air outlet diffusing elements, and or variants of the air<br>
inlet diffusing structure) may advantageously be supplied as a<br>
"kit" for after-market conversion of in-place, operational air<br>
handling assemblies. In furtherance of retrofitting such systems,<br>
select structures, e.g., first, second, and/or third air outlet<br>
diffusing elements may be fractionally supplied, preferably, but<br>
not necessarily, in halves (see e.g., FIG. 2 .with regard to hub<br>
12 and shroud 14 structures, and 'FIG. 3 with regard to hub<br>
structure portions 12a, 12b) for incorporation into the preexisting<br>
assembly as the specific application warrants. It is tc<br>
be further appreciated, and understood, that variations ir<br>
fabrication methodology, and modifications of one or more<br>
elements, structures, assemblies, or sub-assemblies of or<br>
relating to the disclosed invention necessitated thereby, is<br>
contemplated.<br>
Referring now generally to FIGS. 1-3, or FIGS. 4-6, the hub<br>
12 and shroud 14 diffusing structures include peripheral regions<br>
or segments 40, as previously noted, more particularly,<br>
peripheral regions 40 adjacent or proximal outer free edges 44,<br>
i.e., outer circumferential edges, of each of the structures. The<br>
peripheral regions 40, which are radially adjacent<br>
circumferential edges 46, 48 of the back 34 and front 36 plates<br>
respectively (see e.g., FIGS. 1, 3 &amp; 4), are advantageously<br>
/<br>
adapted so as to include (i.e., house, contain, etc.) an acoustic<br>
insulation 50. For example, the peripheral regions 40 of each of<br>
the structures 12, 14 may include compartment defining -walls,<br>
e.g., opposing radially spaced apart side walls 52 extending from<br>
a portion of a base 54 of each of the diffusing structures 12,<br>
14 united by a perforated plate 56, within which the sound<br>
attenuating material 50 resides. Sheets, i.e., diffusing<br>
structure surfaces, exposed to air flow (i.e., in direct contact<br>
therewith) are perforated, more generally adapted to "admit"<br>
noise into the insulating material for "capture" therein.<br>
Fabrication of the inlet and outlet diffuser elements in this way<br>
enhances broadband sound attenuation. Omission of the<br>
perforations 'from the air exposed surfaces nonetheless provides<br>
a boost in static pressure/efficiency.<br>
Advantageously, as shown in FIG. 4, the-shroud diffusing<br>
structure 14 may be further adapted to include insulation beyond<br>
a boundary of its peripheral region 40, more particularly,<br>
adapted to retain insulation throughout the entirety of its<br>
radial extent (i.e., adapted to include insulation in a region<br>
or segment 58 radially extending toward an inner circumferential<br>
periphery 60 thereof). Similarly, as shown in FIGS. 4 &amp; 5, both<br>
I<br>
the mid-span diffusing structure 16 and air inlet diffusing<br>
structure 18 preferably include sound insulative material 50.<br>
With regard to the sound insulating material 50, the density<br>
thereof is preferably within the range,of about 0.5 to 8.0 pounds<br>
per cubic foot, with the preferred material thickness within the<br>
range of about 0.05 to 0.1 times the diameter (D) of a the fan<br>
wheel, i.e., ID = fan wheel outside diameter (OD). One suitably<br>
known combination of thickness/density, wherein ID = 18.25<br>
inches, is 1.5 inch thick insulation having a density of about<br>
6.3 pounds per cubic foot, such material being commercially<br>
available and well known.<br>
In connection .to the air contacting surfaces of the<br>
insulated portions of the one or more air" outlet diffusing<br>
' I<br>
elements, and/or air inlet diffusing structure, as has been<br>
heretofore described, perforated surfaces are 'especially<br>
advantageous. Although a variety of perforated surface<br>
configuration have, or are likely to have utility, those<br>
characterized by a transparency index (TI), defined by Theodore<br>
J. Schultz, "Acoustic Uses for Perforated Metals," within a range<br>
of about 1,000 to 20,000 are desirable. The perforated steel<br>
plate used for the diffuser prototype is 20 GA cold rolled steel,<br>
with 0.060 diameter holes spaced on 3/32 inch staggered centers.<br>
The material has approximately one hundred "twenty six holes per<br>
square inch, and a TI value of 13,887.<br>
With reference again to FIGS. 1/4, the hub diffusing<br>
structure 12 is generally configured within the assembly of the<br>
subject invention, in all its contemplated embodiments, to 'be<br>
orthogonally disposed with respect to axial centerline 26 of the<br>
fan wheel 32, i.e., substantially parallel to the back plate 34,<br>
and spaced apart therefrom. Preferably configured as an annular<br>
element, the structure has an interior circumferential edge 62<br>
opposite its outer circumferential edge 44, or the sidewall 52<br>
associated therewith, and an intermediate circumferential edge<br>
64 therebetween, namely, that associated with the interior<br>
sidewall 52a of the insulation retaining compartment 51.<br>
Dimensionally, the diffuser outside diameter (D0) , i.e.,<br>
maximum dimension from opposing sites on the outer<br>
circumferential edge 44, is within the range of about 1.3-1.6D,<br>
and typically substantially equivalent to the frame size; the<br>
diffuser inside diameter (DJ , i.e., maximum dimension from<br>
opposing sites on the interior circumferential edge 62, being<br>
within the range of about 0.6-0.7D; and, the diameter associated<br>
with the commencement of the peripheral region 40 (Dpr) , i.e.,<br>
maximum dimension from opposing sites on the intermediate<br>
circumferential edge 64 or interior sidewall 52a of the<br>
insulation retaining compartment 51, is within the range of about<br>
1.01-1.02D. With such configuration, the perforated surface 56<br>
of the peripheral region 40 of the hub diffusing structure 12<br>
radial extends from the back plate 34, with clearance as noted<br>
(i.e., (Dpr-Dbp {~lD})/2), so as to be substantially coplanar<br>
therewith, and in all cases, delimits a "rear" boundary or guide<br>
for air exiting from the annular air outlet 32.<br>
With continued reference to FIGS. 1/4, the shroud diffusing<br>
structure 14, like the hub diffusing structure 12, is preferably<br>
configured as an annular element, the structure having interior<br>
circumferential edge 60 opposite its outer circumferential edge<br>
44 or the sidewall 52a associated therewith, and an intermediate<br>
circumferential edge 66 therebetween, namely, that associated<br>
with the interior sidewall 52a of the insulation retaining<br>
compartment 51 coextensive with the peripheral region 40 as<br>
previously discussed. Although dimensionally similar to/with the<br>
hub diffusing structure, at least with respect to the<br>
configuration of FIG. 1, i.e., the ranges of D0, Dif and Dpr for<br>
the shroud diffusing structure 14 being substantially equivalent<br>
to the ranges previously described for D0, Di, and Dpr for the hub<br>
diffusing structure,12.,<br>
Advantageously, as shown in FIGS. 1 &amp; 4, interior 60,<br>
exterior 44 and intermediate 66 circumferential edges of the<br>
shroud diffusing structure 14 are not co-planar (i.e., the<br>
structure may suitably be a ring of frusto-conical arrangement),<br>
however, the edges may be, so as to thereby essentially resemble<br>
the configuration for the hub diffusing structure 12. With the<br>
contemplated configurations, several alternative spacings between<br>
free edges 44 of peripheral regions 40 of the diffusing elements<br>
12, 14, i.e., the "width" of passage 42 for air exiting the<br>
annular outlet 32 of the fan wheel 22 (Wp) , result: (1) Wp is<br>
less than a spacing between a free edges 46, 48 of the back 34<br>
and front 36 plates (WJ , as show in FIGS. 1 &amp; 4 (i.e.,- Wp<ww></ww>
more particularly, as a function of fan wheel diameter D, Ww is<br>
advantageously within the range of about 0.3 to 0.4D (0.356D),<br>
with Wp being a function of Ww and 6; (2) Wp ~/=Ww; and, (3) Wp &gt;<br>
Ww. Alternately, it is believed advantageous to have an angle of<br>
inclination 6 between a plane normal to the axial centerline 26<br>
of the fan wheel 32, and passing through (i.e., including) the<br>
intermediate circumferential edge 66 (or front plate 36 of the<br>
fan wheel 32) , and a plane coextensive with the perforated<br>
surface 56 of the peripheral region 40 thereof, within the range<br>
of About -5 to 25ยฐ (10ยฐ indicated in FIGS. 1 &amp; 4).<br>
The shroud diffusing structure 14 is generally segmented,<br>
a shroud segment 68 depending from the peripheral region thereo'f,<br>
more particularly, extending radially inward therefrom. With<br>
regard to the segmentation of the shroud diffusing structure of<br>
FIG. 1, the segment or region 68 adjacent the peripheral region<br>
40 thereof extends So as to be planar therewith, i.e., at an<br>
angle a of 180ยฐ. The hub diffusing structure 12 is likewise<br>
characterized by such arrangement. With reference to FIG. 4, the<br>
interior segment 68 of the shroud structure 14 is shown<br>
advantageously extending from the peripheral region 40 at an<br>
angle or 
shroud diffusing structure is advantageously .adapted to include,<br>
i.e., carry, retain, etc., acoustic insulation 50. Finally, it<br>
is further advantageous that the spacing between the interior<br>
circumferential edge 60 of the shroud diffusing structure 14 and<br>
the air inlet cone 30, DG, be within the range of about 0.01 to<br>
0.025D. Functionally, the shroud segment 68 depending from the<br>
peripheral region 40 thereof acts as a front re-circulation<br>
cutoff, essentially preventing short circuiting of discharge air<br>
i<br>
to the inlet of the fan wheel.<br>
With particular reference to FIGS. 4. &amp; 5, the air inlet<br>
diffusing structure 18, preferably configured as a conical<br>
frustuitr, generally includes a sidewall 70 which delimits first<br>
and second circumferential ends or edges, more particularly, an<br>
inlet cone proximal circumferential edge 72, hereinafter<br>
"proximal" circumferential edge, and an inlet cone distal<br>
proximal edge 74, hereinafter, "distal" circumferential edge. As<br>
is readily appreciated with reference to FIGS. 4 &amp; 5, the<br>
diameter of the proximal end is less than that of the distal end.<br>
With the proximal end being a clpsed end, an annular air inlet<br>
path 76 is provided for the fan wheel 32 of the assembly 10, more'<br>
particularly, the inlet cone 30 associated therewith.<br>
As noted in connection to the one or more outlet diffusing<br>
structures, the air inlet diffusing structure 18 is^ likewise<br>
adapted so as to include/incorporated insulative material- 50;<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, the air inlet diffusing structure 18 includes<br>
opposingly paired, spaced apart sidewalls 70, 70a, i.e., inner<br>
and .outer sidewalls, filled or finable with insulation. The<br>
outer sidewall, i.e., the - air engaging sidewall, or sidewall<br>
surface, preferably comprises a perforated sheet.<br>
The resonator assembly of FIG. 4, more particularly, a blade<br>
pass frequency tuned resonator 20, centrally extends from the<br>
tapered, closed end of the inlet diffuser structure 18, i.e., the<br>
proximal end. As to the interrelat'edness of the subject<br>
structure in relation to other elements of the assembly, the<br>
diffuser outside diameter (D0&gt;), i.e., maximum dimension from<br>
opposing sites on the outer or distal circumferential edge 74,<br>
is within the range of about 1.3-1.6D, and typically<br>
substantially equivalent to the-frame size; the diffuser inside<br>
diameter (D.^), i.e., maximum dimension from opposing sites on<br>
the interior or proximal circumferential edge 72, being within<br>
the range of about 0.6 to 0.7D (0.55D); the distance between the<br>
mouth of the inlet cone and the proximal end of the structure<br>
(DPE) is within the range of about 0.2 to 0.3D (0.25D); and, the<br>
extended distance of the inlet tuned resonator 20 from the<br>
proximal end of the inlet diffusing structure 18 (DED) is 'within<br>
the range of about 0/55 to 0.65D (0.60D).<br>
With reference now to FIGS. 7 &amp; 8, performance of the<br>
'assembly of- the subject invention is evidenced, more<br>
particularly,.both static efficiency and specific sound,power is<br>
indicated therefore, in relation to conventional fan wheel/fan<br>
ssemblies for air handling systems. Five (5) test units,<br>
indicated in the legend of FIG. 4 as units I-V, were subject to<br>
testing, with the results indicated. As shown, the diffusers of<br>
the subject fan assembly (II), boost the static efficiency (SE)<br>
of the plenum fan by up to 5%. The vane less diffuser outlet<br>
silencer also improves the pressure generating capability of. the<br>
fan. As indicated in the legend, test unit I omits the structures<br>
of the subj.ect invention, namely those of test unit II, with test<br>
units III-IV being commercially available fan units.<br>
Noise reduction using both the outlet and inlet diffuser<br>
elements is indicated in FIG. 5. Six (6) test units, indicated<br>
in the legend of FIG. 5 as units I-VI, were subject to testing,<br>
with the results indicated. Test-units I-IV, as indicated, are<br>
commercially available fan units, with units V and VI indicated<br>
embodiments of the subject invention. As noted, blade pass<br>
frequency (BPF) tone is. reduced by 3 dB, with as much as 8 dB<br>
reduction being achieved at the higher frequencies.<br>
With reference now to Table T, inlet and outlet diffuser<br>
performance is indicated for an 18.25" OD bare fan wheel, no<br>
bearing support on inlet, having 9 blades (i.e., 182 EPFN), with<br>
and without the diffuser elements of the subject invention. The<br>
outlet sound power level (dB), indicated by Lw, is for the<br>
following frequencies (i.e., 1-8), respectively: 63hz, 125, 250,<br>
500, 1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000. Furthermore, LwA indicates an<br>
inlet A weighting. As can be seen, static efficiency improves<br>
dramatically for higher pressures where the vane less diffuser<br>
works best and, sound quality improves by various levels across<br>
all bands consistently, and may be further improved with<br>
selective perforation of the air contacting wall surface of the<br>
diffuser element, and further still, via utilization of a<br>
resonator to tune out BPF tone.<br>
There are other variations of the subject invention, some<br>
of which will become obvious to those skilled in the art. It will<br>
be understood that this disclosure, in many respects, is only<br>
illustrative. Changes may be made in details, particularlyโขin<br>
matters of shape, size, material, and arrangement of parts, as<br>
the case may be, without exceeding the scope of the invention.<br>
