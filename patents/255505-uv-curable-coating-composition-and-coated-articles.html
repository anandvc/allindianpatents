to 1.2 equivalent.<br>
When the content of ingredient (A) is less than the lower limit in the range of the weight ratio of ingredient (A) to the total weight of ingredient (B) and ingredient (C), distinction of image of the cured paint film may be inferior. When the content of ingredient (A) is more than the upper limit of the range, the curing shrinkage of the paint f ilm is increased and the adhesive property is inferior. Further, when the weight ratio of ingredient<br>

of ingredient (B) to ingredient (C), curability is not sufficient<br>
and gasoline resistance is inferior. When the weight ratio of<br>
ingredient (C) is more than the upper limit in the range, the<br>
curing shrinkage stress of the paint film is increased and the<br>
adhesive property is inferior.<br>
The light stabilizer of ingredient (D) used in the present invention is used for increasing weathering resistance of the paint film. The light stabilizer includes compounds which are dissolved or dispersed homogeneously in the paint film, does not cause curing inhibition at the time of ultraviolet-curable, and does not cause yellowing of the paint film. The light stabilizer includes ultraviolet absorbents and antioxidants.

In the ultraviolet-curable coating composition of the<br>
present invention, thecomponents described before are formulated to be able to obtain a cured paint film having a Knoop hardness of 10 to 18, preferably 11 to 18 and a molecular weight of intercrosslinking of crosslinked resin component in the cured paint film of 150 to 300, preferably 170 to 280. When the Knoop hardness of the cured paint film is less than 10, gasoline resistance is inferior. When the Knoop hardness of the cured paint film is more than 18, scratch resistance is inferior. When the molecular weight of intercrosslinking of crosslinked resin component in the cured paint film is less than 150, the curing shrinkage strain in the paint film is increased, adhesive property is inferior, and a graphic tape is easily cracked in the case that the ultraviolet-curable coating composition is applied on an article adhered with the graphic tape. On the other hand, when the molecular weight of intercrosslinking of crosslinked resin component in the cured paint film is more than 300, scratch resistance is inferior. Here the graphic tape is generally a graphic tape formed by providing such as printing and applying, of a display such as literatures of maker name, product name and the like, symbols, marks, figures and patterns on the surface of the substrate being a sheet of resin such as vinyl chloride resins and urethane resins, by applying a clear coating composition such as urethane resin clear coating composition on the surface of the display, by drying, and then by pattern-draw-molding. Also, the graphic tape includes graphic tapes formed by providing a display of metal vapor deposition such as aluminum vapor deposition and chromium vapor deposition on the surface of a sheet of resin such as polyethylene terephthalate resin.<br>
Knoop hardness is a hardness of the paint film measured at 20 ¬∞C by micro surface hardness meter ( produced by Shimazu Co., trade name "HMV-2000" ). As the value of Knoop hardness increases, the paint film becomes harder.<br>
The molecular weight of intercrosslinking of crosslinked resin component is a value obtained from dynamic regidity modulus in rubber area of the separated paint film, which is measured in condition of 110 Hz of frequency and 2 ¬∞C per minute of increasing rate of temperature by using a forced stretching vibration type viscoelasticity measuring device ( produced by Toyo Baldwin Co., trade name "REHOVTBRON DDV-II-EA" ) and is represented by the following formula.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In the formula, Mc is the molecular weight of intercrosslinking of crosslinked resin component ( g/mol ), p is a density of the paint film ( g/cm3 ), G' is a dynamic rigidity in rubber area ( E'/3(dyne/cm2) ) and E' is a dynamic modulus of elasticity in rubber area (dyne/cm2).<br>
The method of applying the ultraviolet-curable coating composition of the present invention is not limited particularly. For example, after applying and curing a baking curing colored coating composition on an article to be coated beforehand, and adhering a graphic tape or the like on the surface of the baked colored paint film according to needs because of problems in design, the cured paint film can be obtained by applying the ultraviolet-curable coating composition on the coated article described above by methods such as spraying application, electrostatic application and curtain flow application, and irradiating ultraviolet light to cure. In this case, before the<br>
ultraviolet light is irradiated, preheating for removing solvents can be provided, or after the ultraviolet light is irradiated, afterheating can be provided. The temperature of preheating is<br>
not limited, but is preferably not less than 50 ¬∞C for increasing volatility of solvent. The temperature of afterheating is<br>
preferably not less than 80 ¬∞C for promoting curing of amino resin. The upper limit of temperature of the preheating or afterheating is not limited, but is preferably not more than 200 ¬∞C.<br>
The irradiation of ultraviolet light is conducted preferably by using an ultraviolet irradiation device, which can irradiate to the surface of three-dimensional coated article almost homogeneously. As ultraviolet light sources, high-pressure mercury lamps, metal halide lamps and the like can be used. The condition of ultraviolet light irradiation for curing the coated article includes a method of irradiating for long time with weak ultraviolet light and a method of irradiating for short time with strong ultraviolet light. Any one of the methods can be selected arbitrarily. When the weak ultraviolet light is irradiated for short time, the amount of ultraviolet energy for giving to the coated film runs short and therefore the curing is defective. When the strong ultraviolet light is irradiated for long time, the amount of ultraviolet energy for giving to the coated film is excess and therefore the paint film causes yellowing discoloration. Preferable amount of ultraviolet<br>
energy for curing the coated article is 100 to 5000 mJ/cm2. The thickness of the paint film obtained by applying the ultraviolet-curable coating composition of the present invention can be selected properly according to needs, but is preferably 10 to 200 ¬µm of the dried thickness, in general.<br>
Coated articles obtained by applying the ultraviolet-curable coating composition of the present invention is not particularly limited, but include structures, wood articles, metallic articles, plastics articles, rubber articles, coated papers, ceramic articles and glass articles, specifically automobiles, parts for automobiles (for example, body, bumper, spoiler, mirror, wheel and inner package material, and these<br>
parts are made of various materials) , metal plates such as steel plates, two-wheel vehicles, parts for two-wheel vehicles, materials for road (for example, guard rail, traffic control sign and sound-proof wall) , materials for tunnel (for example, side wall plate) , marine vessels, railway vehicles, airplanes, furnitures, musical instruments, house-hold electric instruments, building materials, vessels, of f ice articles, sport articles and toys.<br>
