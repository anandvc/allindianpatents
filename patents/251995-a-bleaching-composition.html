				<td>AROMATIZATION,<br>
Field of the Invention<br><br>
This invention relates to/formulatior cotnponentc .such . a&amp; bleach boosting compounds with increased stability, and compositions and laundry methods employing bleach boosting compounds with increased stability. More particularly, this invention relates to quaternary imine bleach boosters and/or oxaziridinium bleaching species, compositions and laundry methods employing quaternary imine bleach boosters and/or oxaziridinium bleaching species.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
to be oyed,<br>
Oxygen bleaching agents have become increasingly popular in recent years in household and personal care products to facilitate stain and soil removal. Bleaches are particularly desirable for their stain-removing, dingy fabric cleanup, whitening and sanitization properties. Oxygen bleaching agents have found particular acceptance in laundry products such as detergents, in automatic dishwashing products and in hard surface cleansers. Oxygen bleaching agents, however, are somewhat limited in their effectiveness. Some frequently encountered disadvantages include color damage on fabrics and damage to laundry appliances, specifically rubber hoses these appliances may contain. In addition, oxygen bleaching agents- tend extremely temperature rate dependent. Thus, the colder the solution in which they are emp the less effective the bleaching action. Temperatures in excess of 60 °C are typically required effectiveness of an oxygen bleaching agent in solution.<br>
To solve the aforementioned temperature rate dependency, a class of compounds known as "bleach activators" has been developed. Bleach activators, typically perhydrolyzable acyl compounds having a leaving group such as oxybenzenesulfonate, react with the active oxygen group, typically hydrogen peroxide or its anion, to form a more effective peroxyacid oxidant. It is the peroxyacid compound which then oxidizes the stained or soiled substrate material. However, bleach activators are also somewhat temperature dependent. Bleach activators are more effective at warm water temperatures of from about 40 °C to about 60 °C. In water temperatures of less than about 40 °C, the peroxyacid compound loses some of its bleaching effectiveness.<br>
Attempts have been made as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,360,568, 5,360,569 and 5,370,826 all to Madison et al. to develop a bleach system which is effective in lower temperature water conditions. However, the dihydroisoquinolinium bleach boosters disclosed in these<br><br>
references, when combined with peroxygen compounds, undergo undesired decomposition, including the formation of an inactive, aromatic isoquinolinium, which causes a reduction in booster efficiency.<br>
In light of the foregoing, researchers have been pursuing with vim and vigor effective bleach boosting agents that do not undergo decomposition.<br>
Accordingly, the need remains for effective bleach boosting compounds and compositions containing bleach boosting compounds which provide effective bleaching even in lower water temperatures and provide improved stability toward unwanted bleach boosting compound decomposition.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
This need is met by the present invention wherein longer lasting bleach boosting compounds, specifically bleach boosters and/or bleaching species, are provided. The bleach boosting compounds of the present invention provide superior bleaching effectiveness even in lower water temperatures as well as prevent unwanted decomposition.<br>
A bleaching composition comprising a bleach boosting compound in conjunction with or without a peroxygen source, wherein said bleach boosting compound is selected from the group consisting of: (a) a bleach booster selected from the group consisting of aryliminium cations, aryliminium zwitterions, aryliminium polyions having a net charge of from about +3 to about -3 and mixtures thereof; (b) a bleaching species selected from the group consisting of oxaziridinium cations, oxaziridinium zwitterions, oxaziridinium polyions having a net charge of from about +3 to about -3 and mixtures thereof; and (c) mixtures thereof is provided in a first embodiment<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, a cationic or zwitterionic laundry bleach boosting compound is provided.<br>
In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention, a method for laundering a fabric in need of laundering comprising contacting the fabric with a laundry solution having a bleaching composition in accordance with the present invention as described herein is provided.<br>
In accordance with still yet another aspect of the present invention, a laundry additive product comprising a bleach boosting compound selected from the group consisting of: (a) a bleach booster selected from the group consisting of aryliminium cations, aryliminium zwitterions, aryliminium polyions having a net charge of from about +3 to about -3 and mixtures thereof; (b) a bleaching species selected from the group consisting of oxaziridinium cations,<br>
i<br>
oxaziridinium zwitterions, oxaziridinium polyions having a net charge of from about +3 to about -3 and mixtures thereof; and (c) mixtures thereof is provided.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide: a bleach boosting compound which demonstrates improved performance even in lower temperature solutions as well as prevent unwanted aromatization; a bleaching composition including a quaternary imine bleach booster and/or an oxaziridinium bleaching species; a method for laundering a fabric by employing a quaternary imine bleach booster and/or an oxaziridinium bleaching species; and a laundry additive product having a quaternary imine bleach booster and/or an oxaziridinium bleaching species. These, and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art from the following description and the appended claims.<br>

In addition to the use of bleach boosting compounds discussed above, the bleach boosting<br>
i<br>
compounds of the present invention may be employed in conjunction with or without, preferably with a peroxygen source in other bleaching compositions, regardless of their form. For example,<br>
i<br>
the bleach boosting compounds may be employed in a laundry additive product. In the bleaching compositions of the present invention, the peroxygen source may be present in levels of from about 0.1% to about 60% by weight of the composition, and preferably from about 1% tb about 40% by weight of the composition. In a composition, the bleach boosting may be present from about 0.001% to about 10% by weight of the composition, and more preferably from about 0.005% to about 5% by weight of the composition. In the bleaching compositions of the present invention, the peroxygen source may be present in levels of from about 0.1% (1 ppm) to about 60% (600 ppm) by weight of the composition, and preferably from about 1% (10 ppm) to about 40% (400 ppm) by weight of the composidon, and the bleach boosting compound may be present<br>
i<br>
from about 0.00001% (0.0001 ppm) to about 10% (100 ppm) by weight of the composition, and preferably from about 0.0001% (0.001 ppm) to about 2% (20 ppm) by weight of the composition, more preferably from about 0.005% (0.05 ppm) to about 0.5% (5 ppm), even more preferably from about 0.01% (0.1 ppm) to about 0.2% (2 ppm). Most preferably from about 0.02% (0.2 ppm) to about 0.1% (1 ppm).<br>
The conversion values (in ppm) are provided for exemplary purposes, based on an in-use product concentration of 1000 ppm. A 1000 ppm wash solution of a product containing 0.2% bleach boosting compound by weight results in a bleach boosting compound concentration of 2 ppm. Similarly, a 3500 ppm wash solution of a product containing 0.2% bleach boosting compound by weight results in a bleach boosting compound concentration of 6.5 ppm.<br>
The preferred bleach boosting compound concentration is based on a bleach boosting compound molecular weight of about 300 grams/mole, although bleach boosting compounds can preferably have molecular weights of from about 150 to 1000 grams/mole, or even higher for oligomeric or polymeric bleach boosting compounds. For example, in the bleaching compositions of the present invention, when the bleach boosting compound is present more preferably from about 0.005% (0.05 ppm) to about 0.5% (5 ppm), the molar (M) concentration of bleach boosting compound will range from 1.7 x 10^ M to 1.7 x 10'^M). Should a bleach boosting compound of higher m.w. be used in the bleaching compositions of the present invention, the preferredj molar concentration will remain unchanged, whereas the preferred weight concentration (in ppm) will<br>
increase accordingly. For example, a bleach boosting compound with a molecular weight of about 600 grams/mole would be present more preferably from about 0.01% (0.1 ppm) tb about 1.0% (10 ppm). For oligomeric or polymeric bleach boosting compounds, the more preferred molar concentration will be based on the monomeric unit associated with the imiriium or oxaziridinium active site.<br>
The bleaching compositions of the present invention may be advantageously employed in laundry applications, hard surface cleaning, automatic dishwashing applications, as well as<br>
i<br>
cosmetic applications such as dentures, teeth, hair and skin. However, due to the!unique advantages of increased color safety and increased effectiveness in cold and possibly warm water solutions due to possible increased stability, the bleach boosting compounds of the ipresent invention are ideally suited for laundry applications such as the bleaching of fabrics through the use of bleach-containing detergents or laundry bleach additives. Furthermore, the bleach boosting compounds of the present invention may be employed in both granular and liquid compositions.<br>
The bleach boosting compounds and bleaching composition comprising the j bleach boosting compounds can be used as antimicrobial agents and disinfectants.<br>
Accordingly, the bleaching compositions of the present invention may include various<br>

Depending on the activator and precise application, good bleaching results can be obtained from bleaching systems having with in-use pH of from about 6 to about 13, preferably from about 9.0 to about 10.5. Typically, for example, activators with electron-withdrawing moieties are used for near-neutral or sub-neutral pH ranges. Alkalis and buffering agents can be used to secure such pH.<br>
Acyl lactam activators, as described in U.S. 5,698,504, U.S. 5,695,679 and U.S. 5,686,014, each of which is cited herein above, are very useful herein, especially the acyl caprolactams (see for example WO 94-28102 A) and acyl valerolactams (see U.S. 5,503,639 Willey et al., issued April 2,1996 incorporated herein by reference).<br>

ii. Cobalt Metal Complexes - Cobalt bleach catalysts useful herein are known, and are described, for example, in U.S. 5,597,936 Perkins et al., issued January 28, 1997; U.S. 5,595,967 Miracle et al., January 21, 1997; U.S. 5,703,030 Perkins et al., issued December 30, 1997; and M. L. Tobe, "Base Hydrolysis of Transition-Metal Complexes", Adv. Inorg. Bioinorg.<br>
Mech.. (1983), 2, pages 1-94. The most preferred cobalt catalyst useful herein are i cobalt pentaamine acetate salts having the formula [Co(NH3)5OAc] Tv, wherein "OAc" represents an<br>
acetate moiety and "Ty" is an anion, and especially cobalt pentaamine acetate chloride, [Co(NH3)5OAc]Cl2; as well as [Co(NH3)5OAc](OAc)2; [Co(NH3)5OAc](PF6)2; [Co(NH3)5OAc](SO4); [Co(NH3)5OAc](BF4)2; and [Co(NH3)5OAc](NO3)2 (herein "PAC").<br>
These cobalt catalysts are readily prepared by known procedures, such as taught for example in U.S. 5,597,936, U.S. 5,595,967, U.S. 5,703,030, cited herein above, the Tobe article and the references cited therein, and in U.S. Patent 4,810,410, to Diakun et al, issued March 7,1989, J. Chem. Ed. (1989), 66 (12), 1043-45; The Synthesis and Characterization of Inorganic Compounds, W.L. Jolly (Prentice-Hall; 1970), pp. 461-3; Inorg. Chem.. 18, 1497-1502 (1979); Inorg. Chem.. 2JL, 2881-2885 (1982); Inorg. Chem.. 18, 2023-2025 (1979); Inorg. Synthesis, 173-176 (1960); and Journal of Physical Chemistry. 56, 22-25 (1952).<br>
iii. Transition Metal Complexes of Macropolvcvclic Rigid Ligands -Compositions herein may also suitably include as bleach catalyst a transition metal complex of a macropolycyclic rigid ligand. The phrase "macropolycyclic rigid ligand" is sometimes abbreviated as "MRL" in discussion below. The amount used is a catalytically effective amount, suitably about 1 ppb or more, for example up to about 99.9%, more typically about 0.001 ppm or more, preferably from about 0.05 ppm to about 500 ppm (wherein "ppb" denotes parts per billion by weight and "ppm" denotes parts per million by weight).<br>
Suitable transition metals e.g., Mn are illustrated hereinafter. "Macropolycyclic" means a MRL is both a macrocycle and is polycyclic. "Polycyclic" means at least bicyclic. The term "rigid" as used herein herein includes "having a superstructure" and "cross-bridged". "Rigid" has been defined as the constrained converse of flexibility: see D.H. Busch., Chemical Reviews., (1993), 93. 847-860, incorporated by reference. More particularly, "rigid" as used herein means that the MRL must be determinably more rigid than a macrocycle ("parent macrocycle") which is otherwise identical (having the same ring size and type and number of atoms in the main ring) but lacking a superstructure (especially linking moieties or, preferably cross-bridging moieties) found in the MRL's. In determining the comparative rigidity of macrocycles with and without superstructures, the practitioner will use the free form (not the metal-bound form) i of the macrocycles. Rigidity is well-known to be useful in comparing macrocycles; suitable tools for determining, measuring or comparing rigidity include computational methods (see, for example, Zimmer, Chemical Reviews. (1995), 95(38), 2629-2648 or Hancock et al., Inoreanica Chimica Actas( 1989), 164,73-84.<br>
Preferred MRL's herein are a special type of ultra-rigid ligand which is cross-bridged. A<br>
i "cross-bridge" is nonlimitingly illustrated in 1.11 hereinbelow. In 1.11, the cross-bridge^ is a -<br>
1	8<br>
CH2CH2- moiety. It bridges N   and N   in the illustrative structure. By comparison, a j"same-<br>
1	12	:<br>
side" bridge, for example if one were to be introduced across N  and N     in 1.11, would not be<br>
sufficient to constitute a "cross-bridge" and accordingly would not be preferred.<br>
i<br>
Suitable metals in the rigid ligand complexes include Mn(II), Mn(in), Mn(IV), Mn(V), Fe(II), Fe(ni), Fe(IV), Co(I), Co(II), Co(III), Ni(I), Ni(II), Ni(HI), Cu(I), Cu(II), Cu(ffl),i Cr(II), Cr(IH), Cr(IV), Cr(V), Cr(VI), V(III), V(IV), V(V), Mo(IV), Mo(V), Mo(VI), W(IV), W(V), W(VI), Pd(II), Ru(Il), Ru(ffl), and Ru(TV). Preferred transition-metals in the instant transition-metal bleach catalyst include manganese, iron and chromium.<br>
More generally, the MRL's (and the corresponding transition-metal catalysts)[ herein suitably comprise: (a) at least one macrocycle main ring comprising four or more heteroatoms; and<br>
^o) a covalently connected non-metal superstructure capable of increasing the rigidity i of the<br>
macrocycle, preferably selected from (i) a bridging superstructure, such as a linking moiety;<br>
(ii) a cross-bridging superstructure, such as a cross-bridging linking moiety; and (iii) combinations thereof.<br>
The term "superstructure" is used herein as defined in the literature by Busch et al, see, for example, articles by Busch in "Chemical Reviews".<br>
Preferred superstructures herein not only enhance the rigidity of the parent macrocycle, but also favor folding of the macrocycle so that it coordinates to a metal in a cleft. Suitable superstructures can be remarkably simple, for example a linking moiety such as any of those illustrated in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 below, can be used. (Figure  Removed)<br><br>
Fig. 1<br>
wherein h is an integer, for example from 2 to 8, preferably less than 6, typically 2 to 4, or<br>
(Figure  Removed)<br>
Fig. 2<br>
wherein m and n are integers from about 1 to 8, more preferably from 1 to 3; Z is N or CH;; and T is a compatible substituent, for example H, alkyl, trialkylammonium, halogen, nitro, sulfonate, or the like. The aromatic ring in 1.10 can be replaced by a saturated ring, in which the atom in Z connecting into the ring can contain N, O, S or C.<br>
Suitable MRL's are further nonlimitingly illustrated by the following compound:<br>

Preferred bleach catalysts are zwitterionic bleach catalysts, which are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,576,282 (especially 3-(3,4-dihydroisoquinolinium) propane sulfonatei Other bleach catalysts include cationic bleach catalysts are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,360,569, 5,442,066, 5,478,357, 5,370,826, 5,482,515, 5,550,256, and WO 95/13351, WO 95/13352, and WO 95/13353.<br>
As a practical matter, and not by way of limitation, the compositions and cleaning processes herein can be adjusted to provide on the order of at least one part per hundred million of the active bleach catalyst species in the aqueous washing medium, and will preferably provide from about 0.01 ppm to about 25 ppm, more preferably from about 0.05 ppm to about l|0 ppmand most preferably from about 0.1 ppm to about 5 ppm, of the bleach catalyst species in the wash liquor. In order to obtain such levels in the wash liquor of an automatic washing process, typical compositions herein will comprise from about 0.0005% to about 0.2%, more preferably from about 0.004% to about 0.08%, of bleach catalyst, especially manganese or cobalt catalysts, by weight of the cleaning compositions.<br>
Preferably, the peroxygen source is selected from hydrogen peroxide sources selected from the group consisting of perborate compounds, percarbonate compounds, perphosphate compounds and mixtures thereof, and a bleach activator.<br>
Preferably, the bleach activator is selected from the group consisting of hydrophobic bleach activators as disclosed herein.<br>
The purpose of such a bleaching composition is to mitigate unwanted decomposition of the bleach boosting, and to allow the peracid to achieve bleaching performance on a fabric in need of cleaning, such as a stained fabric, in a wash solution prior to the availability of the bleach boosting.<br>
The period of time between the peracid becoming active in a wash solution and the bleach boosting compounds becoming active can be in the range of from about 1 second to about 24 hours. Alternatively, since the bleach boosting compounds are relatively stable in the wash solution, the peracid can become active in the wash solution after the bleach boosting compound becomes active or available.<br>
The purpose of a delayed addition bleaching composition (which may or may not be used in conjunction with this invention) is to allow the peracid to achieve maximum bleaching performance on a fabric in need of cleaning, such as a stained fabric, in a wash solution prior to the introduction of the bleach boosting compound. In other words, a bleaching composition comprising a bleach boosting compound which becomes active in a wash solution after a fabric in need of cleaning has been added to the wash solution. Methods for delayed (controlled) addition of bleach boosting compounds are more fully described in copending and co-owned U.S. Provisional Patent Application entitled "Controlled Availability of Formulation Components, Compositions and Laundry Methods Employing Same" filed August 27, 1999 (P&amp;G Attorney Docket Number 7749P).<br>
Alternatively, since the bleach boosting compounds can have increased stability, a bleaching composition comprising an bleach boosting compound which becomes active in a wash solution prior to a fabric in need of cleaning has been added to the wash solution may be used.<br>

The level of builder can vary widely depending upon the end use of the composition and its desired physical form. When present, the compositions will typically comprise at least about 1% builder. Formulations typically comprise from about 5% to about 50%, more typically about 5% to about 30%, by weight, of detergent builder. Granular formulations typically comprise from about 10% to about 80%, more typically from about 15% to about 50% by weight,, of the detergent builder. Lower or higher levels of builder, however, are not meant to be excluded.<br>
Inorganic or P-containing detergent builders include, but are not limited to, the alkali metal, ammonium and alkanolammonium salts of polyphosphates (exemplified by the tripolyphosphates, pyrophosphates, and glassy polymeric meta-phosphates), phosphonates.jphytic acid, silicates, carbonates (including bicarbonates and sesquicarbonates), sulphates, and aluminosilicates. However, non-phosphate builders are required in some locales. Importantly,<br>
the compositions herein function surprisingly well even in the presence of the so-called :'weak" builders (as compared with phosphates) such as citrate, or in the so-called "underbuilt" situation that may occur with zeolite or layered silicate builders.<br>
Examples of silicate builders are the alkali metal silicates, particularly those having a SiCO2:Na2O ratio in the range 1.6:1 to 3.2:1 and layered silicates, such as the layered sodium<br>
silicates described in U.S. 4,664,839 Rieck, issued May 12, 1987. NaSKS-6 is the trademark for<br>
i a crystalline layered silicate marketed by Hoechst (commonly abbreviated herein as "SKS-6").<br>
Unlike zeolite builders, the Na SKS-6 silicate builder does not contain aluminum. NaSKJ3-6 has the delta-Na2SiO5 morphology form of layered silicate. It can be prepared by methods such as<br>
those described in German DE-A-3,417,649 and DE-A-3,742,043. SKS-6 is a highly preferred layered silicate for use herein, but other such layered silicates, such as those having the general formula NaMSixO2x+ryH2O wherein M is sodium or hydrogen, x is a number from 119 to 4,<br>
preferably 2, and y is a number from 0 to 20, preferably 0 can be used herein.  Various other<br>
layered silicates from Hoechst include NaSKS-5, NaSKS-7 and NaSKS-11, as the alpha, beta and gamma forms. As noted above, the delta-Na2SiO5 (NaSKS-6 form) is most preferred for use<br>
herein. Other silicates may also be useful such as for example magnesium silicate, which can serve as a crispening agent in granular formulations, as a stabilizing agent for oxygen bleaches,<br>
i<br>
and as a component of suds control systems.<br>
Examples of carbonate builders are the alkaline earth and alkali metal carbonates as<br>
i<br>
disclosed in German Patent Application No. 2,321,001 published on November 15,1973. ,<br>
Aluminosilicate builders are useful in the present invention. Aluminosilicate builders are of great importance in most currently marketed heavy duty granular detergent compositions, and can also be a significant builder ingredient in liquid detergent formulations. Aluminosilicate<br>
builders include those having the empirical formula:<br>
  (Formula Removed)<br>
wherein z and y are integers of at least 6, the molar ratio of z to y is in the range from 1.0 to about 0.5, and x is an integer from about 15 to about 264.<br>
' Useful aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are commercially available. These aluminosilicates can be crystalline or amorphous in structure and can be naturally-occurring aluminosilicates or synthetically derived. A method for producing aluminosilicate ion exchange materials is disclosed in U.S. 3,985,669, Kr -mel et al, issued October 12, 1976. Pj-eferred synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange materials useful herein are available under the designations Zeolite A, Zeolite P (B), Zeolite MAP and Zeolite X. In an especially preferred embodiment, the crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange material has the formula:<br>
  (Formula Removed)<br>
wherein x is from about 20 to about 30, especially about 27. This material is known as Zeolite A.<br>
Dehydrated zeolites (x = 0 - 10) may also be used herein. Preferably, the aluminosilicate has a<br><br>
particle size of about 0.1-10 microns in diameter.	<br>
Organic detergent builders suitable for the purposes of the present invention include, but are not restricted to, a wide variety of polycarboxylate compounds. As used herein, j"poly-carboxylate" refers to compounds having a plurality of carboxylate groups, preferably at least 3 carboxylates. Polycarboxylate builder can generally be added to the composition in acid form, but can also be added in the form of a neutralized salt. When utilized in salt form, alkali metals, such as sodium, potassium, and lithium, or alkanolammonium salts are preferred.<br>
Included among the polycarboxylate builders are a variety of categories of useful mate¬rials. One important category of polycarboxylate builders encompasses the ether polycalrboxy-lates, including oxydisuccinate, as disclosed in U.S. 3,128,287 Berg, issued April 7, 1964, U.S. 3,635,830 Lamberti et al., issued January 18, 1972, and U.S. 3,936,448 Lamberti, issued February 3, 1976. See also "TMS/TDS" builders of U.S. 4,663,071 Bush et al., issued May 5,<br>
1987.   Suitable ether polycarboxylates also include cyclic compounds, particularly alicyclic<br>
i compounds, such as those described in U.S. 3,923,679 Rapko, issued December 2, 1975; U.S.<br>
4,158,635 Crutchfield et al., issued June 19, 1979; U.S. 4,120,874 Crutchfield et al., issued October 17,1978; and U.S. 4,102,903 Crutchfield et al., issued July 25,1978.<br>
Other useful detergency builders include the ether hydroxypolycarboxylates, copo^ymers of maleic anhydride with ethylene or vinyl methyl ether, 1, 3, 5-trihydroxy benzene-2, 4, 6-trisulphonic acid, and carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, the various alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts of polyacetic acids such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid, as well as polycarboxylates such as mellitic acid, succinic acid, oxydisuccinic acid, polymaleic acid, benzene 1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid, carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, and soluble salts thereof.<br>
Citrate builders, e.g., citric acid and soluble salts thereof (particularly sodium salt), are polycarboxylate builders of particular importance for heavy duty liquid detergent formulations due to their availability from renewable resources and their biodegradability. Citrates can also be used in granular compositions, especially in combination with zeolite and/or layered silicate builders. Oxydisuccinates are also especially useful in such compositions and combinations.<br>
Also suitable in the bleaching compositions of the present invention are the 3,3-dicar-<br>
boxy-4-oxa-l,6-hexanedioates and the related compounds disclosed in U.S. 4,566,984,i Bush, issued January 28, 1986. Useful succinic acid builders include the C5-C2Q alkyl and alkenyl<br>
succinic acids and salts thereof. A particularly preferred compound of this type is dodecenylsuccinic acid. Specific examples of succinate builders include: laurylsuccinate,<br>
myristylsuccinate, palmitylsuccinate, 2-dodecenylsuccinate (preferred), 2-pentadecenylsuccinate,<br>
and the like. Laurylsuccinates are the preferred builders of this group, and are described in<br>
European Patent Application 86200690.5/0,200,263, published November 5,1986.	<br>
Other suitable polycarboxylates are disclosed in U.S. 4,144,226, Crutchfield et al.j issued March 13, 1979 and in U.S. 3,308,067, Diehl, issued March 7, 1967. See also Diehl U.S. Patent<br>
3,723,322.<br>
Fatty acids, e.g., Cj2-C]g monocarboxylic acids, can also be incorporated ipto the<br>
compositions alone, or in combination with the aforesaid builders, especially citrate and/or the succinate builders, to provide additional builder activity. Such use of fatty acids will generally result in a diminution of sudsing, which should be taken into account by the formulator.<br>
In situations where phosphorus-based builders can be used, and especially in the for¬mulation of bars used for hand-laundering operations, the various alkali metal phosphates such as the well-known sodium tripolyphosphates, sodium pyrophosphate and sodium orthophosphate can be used. Phosphonate builders such as ethane-l-hydroxy-l,l-diphosphonate and other known phosphonates (see, for example, U.S. Patents 3,159,581; 3,213,030; 3,422,021; 3,400,148 and 3,422,137) can also be used.<br>
Chelating Agents - The bleaching compositions herein may also optionally contain one or more iron and/or manganese chelating agents. Such chelating agents can be selected from the group consisting of amino carboxylates, amino phosphonates, polyfunctionally-substituted aro¬matic chelating agents and mixtures therein, all as hereinafter defined. Without intending to be<br>
I bound by theory, it is believed that the benefit of these materials is due in part to their exceptional<br>
ability to remove iron and manganese ions from washing solutions by formation of'soluble chelates.<br>
Examples of suitable chelating agents and levels of use are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,576,282 and 5,728,671.<br>
A preferred biodegradable chelator for use herein is ethylenediamine disuccinate ("EDDS"), especially the [S,S] isomer as described in U.S. Patent 4,704,233, November 3, 1987, to Hartman and Perkins.<br>
The compositions herein may also contain water-soluble methyl glycine diacetic acid (MGDA) salts (or acid form) as a chelant or co-builder useful with, for example, insoluble builders such as zeolites, layered silicates and the like.<br>
If utilized, these chelating agents will generally comprise from about 0.1% by weight of the bleaching compositions herein to about 15%, more preferably 3.0% by weight of the bleaching compositions herein.<br>
Dye Transfer Inhibiting Agents - The bleaching compositions of the present invention may also include one or more compounds, dye transfer inhibiting agents, for inhibiting dye transfer from one fabric to another of solubilized and suspended dyes encountered during fabric<br>
I<br>
laundering and conditioning operations involving colored fabrics.	i<br>
i Suitable polymeric dye transfer inhibiting agents include, but are not limited to,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone polymers, polyamine N-oxide polymers, copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone and N-vinylimidazole, polyvinyloxazolidones and polyvinylimidazoles or mixtures thereof. Examples of such dye transfer inhibiting agents are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,707,950 and 5,707,951.<br>
Additional suitable dye transfer inhibiting agents include, but are not limited to1, cross-linked polymers. Cross-linked polymers are polymers whose backbone are interconnected to a certain degree; these links can be of chemical or physical nature, possibly with active groups on the backbone or on branches. Cross-linked polymers have been described in the Journal of Polymer Science, volume 22, pages 1035-1039.<br>
In one embodiment, the cross-linked polymers are made in such a way that theyj form a three-dimensional rigid structure, which can entrap dyes in the pores formed by the three-dimensional structure.<br>
In another embodiment, the cross-linked polymers entrap dyes by swelling.<br>
Suitable cross-linked polymers are described in the co-pending European! patent application 94870213.9.<br>
Addition of such polymers also enhances the performance of the enzymes within the bleaching compositions herein.<br>
The dye transfer inhibiting agents have the ability to complex or adsorb fugitive dyes wash out of dyed fabrics before the dyes have the opportunity to become attached to other articles in the wash.<br>
When present in the bleaching compositions herein, the dye transfer inhibiting agents are present at levels from about 0.0001%, more preferably about 0.01%, most preferably about 0.05% by weight of the bleaching compositions to about 10%, more preferably about 2%, most preferably about 1 % by weight of the bleaching compositions.<br>
Dispersants - The bleaching compositions of the present invention can also contain dispersants. Suitable water-soluble organic salts are the homo- or co-polymeric acids or their salts, in which the polycarboxylic acid comprises at least two carboxyl radicals separated from each other by not more than two carbon atoms.<br>
Polymers of this type are disclosed in GB-A-1,596,756. Examples of such s'alts are polyacrylates of MW 2000-5000 and their copolymers with maleic anhydride, such copolymers having a molecular weight of from 1,000 to 100,000.<br>
Especially, copolymer of acrylate and methylacrylate such as the 480N hiving a molecular weight of 4000, at a level from 0.5-20% by weight of composition can be added in the detergent compositions of the present invention.<br>
The compositions of the invention may contain a lime soap peptiser compound, winch has a lime soap dispersing power (LSDP), as defined hereinafter of no more than 8, preferably no more than 7, most preferably no more than 6. The lime soap peptiser compound is preferably present at a level from 0% to 20% by weight.<br>
A numerical measure of the effectiveness of a lime soap peptiser is given by the lime soap dispersant power (LSDP) which is determined using the lime soap dispersant test as described in an article by H.C. Borghetty and C.A. Bergman, J. Am. Oil. Chem. Soc., volume 27, pages 88-90, (1950). This lime soap dispersion test method is widely used by practitioners in this art fieW being referred to, for example, in the following review articles; W.N. Linfield, Surfactant science! Series, Volume 7, page 3; W.N. Linfield, Tenside surf, det., volume 27, pages 159-163, (1990); and M.K. Nagarajan, W.F. Masler, Cosmetics and Toiletries, volume 104, pages 71-73, (1989). The LSDP<br>
is the % weight ratio of dispersing agent to sodium oleate required to disperse the lime soap deposits formed by 0.025g of sodium oleate in 30ml of water of 333ppm CaCo3 (Ca:Mg=3:2)<br>
equivalent hardness.<br>
Surfactants having good lime soap peptiser capability will include certain amine oxides, betaines, sulfobetaines, alkyl ethoxysulfates and ethoxylated alcohols.<br>
Exemplary surfactants having a LSDP of no more than 8 for use in accord with the present invention include Cjg-Cig dimethyl amine oxide, C^-Cjg alkyl ethoxysulfates with an<br>
average degree of ethoxylation of from 1-5, particularly Ci2-Ci5 alkyl ethoxysulfate surfactant with a degree of ethoxylation of amount 3 (LSDP=4), and the Ci4-Ci5 ethoxylated alcohols with<br>
an average degree of ethoxylation of either 12 (LSDP=6) or 30, sold under the tradenames Lutensol A012 and Lutensol A030 respectively, by BASF GmbH.<br>
Polymeric lime soap peptisers suitable for use herein are described in the article by M.K. Nagarajan, W.F. Masler, to be found in Cosmetics and Toiletries, volume 104, pages;71-73, (1989).<br>
Hydrophobic bleaches such as 4-[N-octanoyl-6-aminohexanoyl]benzene sulfonate, 4-[N-nonanoyl-6-aminohexanoyl]benzene sulfonate, 4-[N-decanoyl-6-aminohexanoyl]benzene sulfonate and mixtures thereof; and nonanoyloxy benzene sulfonate together with hydrophilic / hydrophobic bleach formulations can also be used as lime soap peptisers compounds.<br>
Enzymes - The bleaching compositions can comprise in addition to the amylase of the present invention one or more detergent enzymes which provide cleaning performance and/or fabric care benefits. Such enzymes can include proteases, amylases, celluloses and lipases. They may be incorporated into the non-aqueous liquid bleaching compositions herein in the form of suspensions, "marumes" or "prills". Another suitable type of enzyme comprises those in the form of slurries of enzymes in nonionic surfactants, e.g., the enzymes marketed by Novo Nordisk under the tradename "SL" or the microencapsulated enzymes marketed by Novo Nordisk under the tradename "LDP." Suitable enzymes and levels of use are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,576,282.<br>
Enzymes added to the compositions herein in the form of conventional enzyme prills are especially preferred for use herein. Such prills will generally range in size from about 100 to 1,000 microns, more preferably from about 200 to 800 microns and will be suspended throughout the non-aqueous liquid phase of the composition. Prills in the compositions of the ;present invention have been found, in comparison with other enzyme forms, to exhibit especially<br>
i<br>
desirable enzyme stability in terms of retention of enzymatic activity over timei Thus, compositions which utilize enzyme prills need not contain conventional enzyme stabilizing such as must frequently be used when enzymes are incorporated into aqueous liquid detergents.<br>
Examples of suitable enzymes include, but are not limited to, hemicellulases, peroxidases, proteases, celluloses, xylanases, lipases, phospholipases, esterases, cutinases, pectinases, keratanases, reductases, oxidases, phenoloxidases, lipoxygenases, ligninases, pullulanases,<br>

The compositions of the present invention may also comprise a mannanase enzyme.<br>
Preferably, the mannanase is selected from the group consisting of:   three mannans-degrading<br>
i enzymes : EC 3.2.1.25 : p-mannosidase, EC 3.2.1.78 : Endo-l,4-p-mannosidase, referred! therein<br>
after as "mannanase" and EC 3.2.1.100 : 1,4-p-mannobiosidase and mixtures thereof. (IUPAC<br>
Classification- Enzyme nomenclature, 1992 ISBN 0-12-227165-3 Academic Press).	|<br>
More preferably, the treating compositions of the present invention, when a mannanase is present, comprise a p-l,4-Mannosidase (E.G. 3.2.1.78) referred to as Mannanase. The term "mannanase" or "galactomannanase" denotes a mannanase enzyme defined according to tile art as officially being named mannan endo-l,4-beta-mannosidase and having the alternative names beta-mannanase and endo-l,4-mannanase and catalysing the reaction: random hydrolysis of l|4-beta-<br>
D- mannosidic linkages in mannans, galactomannans, glucomannans, and galactoglucomannans.<br>
i<br>
In particular, Mannanases (EC 3.2.1.78) constitute a group of polysaccharaseS which degrade mannans and denote enzymes which are capable of cleaving polyose chains containing mannose units, i.e. are capable of cleaving glycosidic bonds in mannans, glucomannans,<br>
galactomannans and galactogluco-mannans. Mannans are polysaccharides having a backbone<br>
j composed of (3-1,4- linked mannose; glucomannans are polysaccharides having a backbone or<br>
more or less regularly alternating P-1,4 linked mannose and glucose; galactomannans and galactoglucomannans are mannans and glucomannans with a-1,6 linked galactose sidebranches. These compounds may be acetylated.<br>
The degradation of galactomannans and galactoglucomannans is facilitated by full or partial removal of the galactose sidebranches. Further the degradation of the acetylated mannans, glucomannans, galactomannans and galactogluco-mannans is facilitated by full or ; partial deacetylation. Acetyl groups can be removed by alkali or by mannan acetylesterases. The oligomers which are released from the mannanases or by a combination of mannanases and a-galactosidase and/or mannan acetyl esterases can be further degraded to release free maltose by P-mannosidase and/or p-glucosidase.<br>
Mannanases have been identified in several Bacillus organisms. For example, Talbot et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol., Vol.56, No. 11, pp. 3505-3510 (1990) describes a beta-mannanase derived from Bacillus stearothermophilus in dimer form having molecular weight of 162 kDa and an optimum pH of 5.5-7.5. Mendoza et al., World J. Microbiol. Biotech., Vol. 10, No. 5, pp. 551-555 (1994) describes a beta-mannanase derived from Bacillus subtilis having a molecular weight of 38 kDa, an optimum activity at pH 5.0 and 55C and a pi of 4.8. JP-03047076 discloses a beta-mannanase derived from Bacillus sp., having a molecular weight of 373 kDa measured by gel filtration, an optimum pH of 8-10 and a pi of 5.3-5.4. JP-63056289 describes the production of an alkaline, thermostable beta-mannanase which hydrolyses beta-l,4-D-mannopyranoside bonds of e.g. mannans and produces manno-oligosaccharides. JP-63036774 relates to the Bacillus microorganism PERM P-8856 which produces beta-mannanase and beta-mannosidase| at an alkaline pH. JP-08051975 discloses alkaline beta-mannanases from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. AM-001. A purified mannanase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens useful in the bleaching of pu|lp and<br>
i<br>
paper and a method of preparation thereof is disclosed in WO 97/11164. WO 91/18974 describes a hemicellulase such as a glucanase, xylanase or mannanase active at an extreme pH and temperature. WO 94/25576 discloses an enzyme from Aspergillus aculeatus, CBS 101.43, exhibiting mannanase activity which may be useful for degradation or modification of plant or algae cell wall material. WO 93/24622 discloses a mannanase isolated from Trichodermal reseei useful for bleaching lignocellulosic pulps.

For instance, the specificity may be defined as the xyloglucan to p-glucan activity (XGU/BGU), xyloglucan to carboxy methyl cellulose activity (XGU/CMCU), or xyloglucan to acid swollen Avicell activity (XGU/AVTU), which is preferably greater than about 50, such as 75, 90 on 100.<br>
t<br>
The term "derived from" as used herein refers not only to an endoglucanase produced by strain CBS 101.43, but also an endoglucanase encoded by a DNA sequence isolated from strain CBS 101.43 and produced in a host organism transformed with said DNA sequence. The term "homologue" as used herein indicates a polypeptide encoded by DNA which hybridizes to the same probe as the DNA coding for an endoglucanase enzyme specific for xyloglucan under certain specified conditions (such as presoaking in 5xSSC and prehybridizing for 1 h at -46°C in a solution of 5xSSC, SxDenhardt's solution, and 50 ug of denatured sonicated calf thymus DNA, followed by hybridization in the same solution supplemented with 50 uCi 32-P-dCTP labeled probe for 18 h at -40°C and washing three times in 2xSSC, 0.2% SDS at 40°C for 30 minutes). More specifically, the term is intended to refer to a DNA sequence which is at least 70% homologous to any of the sequences shown above encoding an endoglucanase specific for xyloglucan, including at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90% or even at least 95% with any of the sequences shown above. The term is intended to include modifications of! any of the DNA sequences shown above, such as nucleotide substitutions which do not give rise to another amino acid sequence of the polypeptide encoded by the sequence, but which correspond to the codon usage of the host organism into which a DNA construct comprising any of the DNA sequences is introduced or nucleotide substitutions which do give rise to a different amino acid sequence and therefore, possibly, a different amino acid sequence and therefore, possibly, a different protein structure which might give rise to an endoglucanase mutant with different properties than the native enzyme. Other examples of possible modifications are insertion of one or more nucleotides into the sequence, addition of one or more nucleotides at either end of the sequence, or deletion of one or more nucleotides at either end or within the sequence.<br>
Endoglucanase specific for xyloglucan useful in the present invention preferably1 is one which has a XGU/BGU, XGU/CMU and/or XGU/AVIU ratio (as defined above) of more tlian 50, such as 75, 90 or 100.<br>
Furthermore, the endoglucanase specific for xyloglucan is preferably substantially Devoid of activity towards p-glucan and/or exhibits at the most 25% such as at the most 10% or about<br>
5%, activity towards carboxymethyl cellulose and/or Avicell when the activity | towards xyloglucan is 100%.. In addition, endoglucanase specific for xyloglucan of the invention is preferably substantially devoid of transferase activity, an activity which has been observed for most endoglucanases specific for xyloglucan of plant origin.<br>
Endoglucanase specific for xyloglucan may be obtained from the fungal species A. aculeatus, as described in WO 94/14953. Microbial endoglucanases specific for xyloglucan has also been described in WO 94/14953. Endoglucanases specific for xyloglucan from plants have been described, but these enzymes have transferase activity and therefore must be considered inferior to microbial endoglucanses specific for xyloglucan whenever extensive degradation of xyloglucan is desirable. An additional advantage of a microbial enzyme is that it, in general, may be produced in higher amounts in a microbial host, than enzymes of other origins.<br>
The xyloglucanase, when present, is incorporated into the treating compositions of the invention preferably at a level of from 0.0001% to 2%, more preferably from 0.0005% to 0.1%, most preferred from 0.001% to 0.02% pure enzyme by weight of the composition.<br>
The above-mentioned enzymes may be of any suitable origin, such as vegetable, janimal, bacterial, fungal and yeast origin. Purified or non-purified forms of these enzymes may be used. Also included by definition, are mutants of native enzymes. Mutants can be obtained I e.g. by protein and/or genetic engineering, chemical and/or physical modifications of native enzymes. Common practice as well is the expression of the enzyme via host organisms in which the [genetic material responsible for the production of the enzyme has been cloned.<br>
Said enzymes are normally incorporated in the bleaching composition at levels from 0.0001% to 2% of active enzyme by weight of the bleaching composition. The enzymes! can be added as separate single ingredients (prills, granulates, stabilized liquids, etc. containing one enzyme ) or as mixtures of two or more enzymes ( e.g. cogranulates).<br>
Other suitable detergent ingredients that can be added are enzyme oxidation scavengers. Examples of such enzyme oxidation scavengers are ethoxylated tetraethylene polyamines.<br>
