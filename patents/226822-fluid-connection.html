Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiment<br>
Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only, and not for the purpose of limiting same, FIG. 1 shows a fluid connection 10, illustrating a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Fluid connection 10 is basically comprised of a first, stationary fitting 30 for attachment to a stationary fluid inlet line or conduit 12 and a second, accessory fitting 100 for attachment to a fluid supply line or conduit 14, as best seen in FIG. 2, wherein fittings 30, 100 are shown spaced-apart from each other. Stationary fluid inlet line 12 has a fluid opening 12a extending therethrough. Fluid supply line 14 has a fluid opening 14a extending therethrough. As used herein, the term "stationary fitting" refers to a fitting that is adapted to be connected to a stationary fluid inlet line, such as, by way of example and not limitation, a stationary water inlet pipe on a microbial deactivation washer (not shown). Such inlet line typically extends into the interior cavity of a washer for connection to an accessory, such as spray heads on a rack or basket (not shown), used in the washer. As used herein, the term "movable fitting" refers to a fitting adapted to be attached to a fluid supply conduit that is movable relative to a stationary fluid inlet line, such as, by way of example and not limitation, a fluid supply line to a spray on a movable basket used in the washer, or to an instrument or piece of equipment to be washed in a movable basket within the washer. In this respect, the accessory above may be a spray head or an instrument on a rack or basket that is movable within the washer.<br>
4<br><br>
In the embodiment shown, first, stationary fitting 30 includes a piston body 32, best seen in FIG. 3. Piston body 32 is cylindrical in shape arid includes an outwardly extending annular flange 34 at one end and an outwardly extending boss or mount 36 at the other end.<br>
	Flange 34 has a planar surface 34a dimensioned to mate with a planar<br>
surface 16a on a flange element 16 of stationary fluid inlet line 12. An annular seal 42 is disposed between flange 34 on piston body 32 and flange 16 on stationary fluid inlet line 12 to form a fluid seal therebetween. Flanges 34 and flange element 16 are held together by a conventional collar clamp 44 comprised of clamp sections 44a, 44b, that are hinged together at one end (not shown) and have slotted tabs 44c, 44d at the other end. A thumbnut 52 and a thread rod 54 attached to slotted tab 44d are used to secure collar section 44a, 44b onto flanges 34 on piston body 32 and flange element 16 on stationary fluid inlet line 12. As best seen in FIG. 3, flange 34 and flange element 16 have beveled edges to matingly engage tapered inner surfaces along the inner edge of collar clamp sections 44a, 44b. In this respect, tightening collar clamp 44 forces flange 34 and flange element 16 towards each other thereby forming a fluid-tight seal between stationary fluid inlet line 16 and piston body 32, in a manner conventionally known.<br>
Annular mount 36 on piston body 32 has a generally C-shaped bracket 52 secured thereto. Bracket 52 is preferably formed from a metallic sheet material that is bent into a generally C-shaped configuration. Bracket 52 has a planar base 54 and sides 56, 58 that are generally L-shaped. Sides 56, 58 have inwardly turned ends 56a, 58a. A generally rectangular slot or space 62 is formed between planar base 54 and ends 56a, 58a of C-shaped bracket 52 and the inwardly turned ends.<br>
Piston body 32 defines a cylindrical inner cavity 72 that communicates with opening 12a in stationary fluid inlet line 12, and that extends through C-shaped bracket 52 to communicate with slot 62 defined by C-shaped bracket 52. An inwardly extending lip 74 is formed at one end of piston body 32, as best seen in FIG. 3. Lip 74 is formed on the end of piston body 32 where C-shaped bracket 52 is connected to piston body 32.<br>
5<br><br>
Piston cavity 72 is dimensioned to receive a piston 82, best seen in FIG. 5. Piston 82 is generally cylindrical in shape. Piston 82 may be a solid cylindrical plug, but in the embodiment shown, piston 82 is generally C-shaped In this respect, piston 82 includes a bottom wall 84 and an annular, cylindrical side wall 86 extending to one side of bottom wall 84. A plurality of spaced-apart apertures 88 are formed in bottom wall 84, as best seen in FIG. 5. Apertures 88 are dimensioned such that the total cross-sectional area of all apertures 88 is less than the cross-sectional area of opening 12a of stationary fluid inlet line 12. In the illustrated embodiment, an annular slot 92 is formed in the end face of bottom wall 84 along the periphery thereof. In an alternative embodiment, annular slot 92 may be omitted. The free end of side wall 86 is tapered to form a conical-shaped end 94, as best seen in FIG. 3. By way of example, and not limitation, piston 82 may be formed of teflon or stainless steel.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 2, accessory fitting 100 is best seen. Accessory<br><br>
fitting 100 is a tubular member comprised bf a cylindrical body 112 having an<br>
outwardly extending flange 114 at one end thereof.   Body 112 has a cylindrical<br>
opening 122 extending therethrough.   Flange 114 has an outer edge 114a that is<br>
tapered, and a planar end surface 114b. Second, accessory fitting 100 is dimensioned<br>
to be attached to fluid supply line 14 by a conventional hose or tube fitting 132, as<br>
illustrated in the drawings.   Accessory fitting 100 is dimensioned to be slidably<br>
received within rectangular space 62 defined by C-shaped bracket 52 of first,<br>
stationary fitting 30.<br>
Referring now to the operation of fluid connection 10, first, stationary<br>
fitting 30 is attached to stationary fluid inlet line 12 by means of collar clamp 44.<br>
Second, accessory fitting 100 is positioned adjacent first, stationary fitting 30 by<br>
sliding flange 114 on cylindrical body 112 into space or slot 62 defined by C-shaped<br>
bracket 52. Second, accessory fitting 100 is positioned such that cylindrical opening<br>
122 is aligned with piston cavity 72 in piston body 32.   In this respect, cylindrical<br>
opening 122 of second, accessory fitting 100 is basically in axial alignment with the<br>
axis of cylindrical piston 82.   During the operation of the washer, pressurized fluid<br>
flows through stationary fluid inlet line 12 into cavity 72 of piston body 32.   Since<br>
6<br><br>
apertures 88 and piston 82 in total define a smaller, cross-sectional area than the cross-<br>
sectional area of opening 12a of stationary fluid inlet line 12, a pressure build up will<br>
occur within cavity 72 in piston body 32. The pressure on the face of bottom wall 84<br>
of piston 82 forces piston 82 in a direction towards surface 114b of flange 114. In this<br>
respect, conical end 94 of piston 82 is forced against surface 114b &gt; of flange 114<br>
forming a fluid connection therewith. Fluid flows through apertures 88 into<br>
cylindrical opening 122 of cylindrical body 112 of second, accessory fitting 100.<br>
From there, pressurized fluid flows through opening 14a of fluid supply line 14 to an<br>
accessory device within the washer. Following completion of a washing cycle, the<br>
flow of pressurized fluid through stationary fluid inlet line 12 is discontinued. As a<br>
result, pressure no longer exists against bottom wall 84 of piston 82 to force piston 82<br>
against surface 114a on flange 114 of second, accessory fitting 100. As a result,<br>
second, accessory fitting 100 may be disconnected from first, stationary fitting 30 by<br>
sliding fitting 100 out of slot 62 defined by C-shaped bracket 52. The present<br>
invention thus provides a quick connect and quick disconnect fluid connection<br>
wherein fluid pressure during operation effectively forms a fluid connection between<br>
first, stationary fitting 30 and second, accessory fitting 100 by forcing piston 82 into<br>
engagement with surface 114b of second, accessory fitting 100.<br>
[0023]	The foregoing description is a specific embodiment of the present<br>
invention. It should be appreciated that this embodiment is described for purposes of illustration only, and that numerous alterations and modifications may be practiced by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations be included insofar as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or the equivalents thereof.<br>
