				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of a tanning agent. More particularly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a novel chromium-silica compound. The compound has potential use predominantly as a self-tanning agent for hides and skins. It is envisaged to be able to produce leathers with excellent softness, stretch, suppleness, and fluffy grain with smooth surface.<br>
Conventionally  skins/hides  are  stabilised  against  microbial  degradation  by<br><br>
tanning. Chrome tanning has been the most predominant method of tannage for the commercial purpose. The major limitation associated with this is that the chrome tanned leathers are empty in nature and hence need heavy retanning for its final performance. Unlike chamois leather, which is essentially oil tanned, chrome tanned leather do not provide any lubrication among the fibres. Hence strong fatliquoring becomes mandatory for the desired level of softness. The conventional chrome tanning practices employ basic chromium sulphate salt, a progenitor of several chrorriium species, having various charges and degree of polymerisation. The kinetic inertness of certain chromium species lends itself to poor exhaustion of chrome tanning. Thus the commercial chrome tanning activities release chromium in the range of 2000-5000 ppm. As reported by Bellavere et al (Environmental Technology Letters, 2, 119, 1981), the environmental consequences arising from the discharge of industrial wastewater<br><br>
containing chromium into water bodies are enormous. While Tsou et al (Chemical Research in Toxicology, 10, 962, 1997) have proved that chromium has the ability to cause cancer, Blankenship et al (Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology, 126, 75, 1994) have even reported cell death as the ultimate result occurred by the influence of chromium. The wide ecological concern as well as economic loss has posed the researchers to look for suitable alternatives for chromium. Several methods have been evolved over the years for better<br>
*<br>
management of chromium in leather industry, as reported by Chandrasekaran (Leather Science, 34, 91, 1987). Among them the chrome saver approach and the development of mineral alternatives to chromium have been gaining momentum.<br>
Covington (Chemical Society Reviews, 26, 73, 1997) has reported the use of metal ions like aluminium, titanium, zirconium and iron for tanning. However the major disadvantage associated with these products is that the resulting leathers exhibit incomplete tannage as well as very poor hydrothermal stability and do not withstand boil test. In addition, these products lack the ability to withstand pH conditions above 5.5, as reported by Heidemann (Fundamentals of Leather Manufacture, Eduard Roether KG publications 1st edition, Chapter 11, 1993). These limitations have forced the researchers to look for other alternatives for the purpose of tanning.<br><br>
The use of silica for tanning of skin/hide is an age-old process. The precipitation of gelatine by the addition of silicic acid forms the basis of silica tanning. Morin (French patent, 479,908, 1914) for the first time provided a silica tanning process, whereby the delimed skins were treated in a bath of sodium silicate, followed by the treatment with a dilute acid like acetic acid. However, the tanning was not completed since the polymerisation of silica occurred at initial stage, which had prevented the penetration of silica. Silica tannage was later attempted<br>
+<br>
by Hough (British Patent 17,137, 1915), who used for this purpose an acid solution of silica, prepared by reacting 30% sodium silicate with 30% hydrochloric acid, ensuring excess acid in the solution so as to neutralise the sodium silicate completely. The major limitation associated with all these conventional silica tannages is that the silica gets fixed on the external layers of the pelt, thereby lacking penetration of silica resulting in incomplete tannage. Several attempts have therefore been made to ensure complete penetration of silica during tanning.<br>
Bocciardo (French patent 781,988, 1934) provided a method of silica tanning in which the pelt had been pretanned with formaldehyde. Again, Benckiser (German Patent 906,135, 1954) used polyphosphates along with silicate for the purpose of tanning. Essentially they were based on incorporation of some other tanning agent in pretanning or in combination.<br><br>
Although silica tanned leathers exhibit good feel and excellent softness, the most important negative attributes associated with them are that they possess low hydrothermal stability and are very weak in mechanical strength. Silica tanned leather was reported by Wilson (The Chemistry of Leather Manufacture, Volume 2, Chemical Catalog Co., Inc. (Reinhold Publishing Corp.), New York, 2nd Edition, Chapter 26, 1929), to tear very easily within a few months of ageing, relating this phenomena to the probable action of the silicic acid on the leather fibres.<br>
*<br>
This has prompted the researchers to explore options of combining silica with other metals so as to make use of the positive features of the respective materials to meet the end requirement. Kirk (US Patents 2,383,653, 1945 and 2,395,003, 1946) used double silicates of sodium and another metal such as aluminium, iron, chromium and zirconium in tanning. Fernald and Her (US Patent 2,395,472, 1946) provided a process for the production of acid soluble double silicates of an alkali metal and a metal selected from the group consisting of Al, Cr, Fe, Zn and Zr, together with H-bonding donors capable of adapting the products for tanning. These products are especially sodium aluminium silicate with a ratio of AI2O3/SiO2 from 1:2 to 1:5 and a ratio of Na2O/ AI2O3 less than 1.5:1, with or without hydrogen bonding agent, as reported by Kirk (US Patent 2,383,653, 1945). However, they have used only a double salt of silica where the astringency of Al, Cr, Fe, Zn and Zr may not be enough to drastically increase<br><br>
the shrinkage temperature of the skins/hides.<br>
Chrome tanning by virtue of its nature imparts neither any lubricating effect nor fullness to the final leather. It is an empty tannage. But it has an ability to increase the shrinkage temperature to 120°C that cannot be achieved by any other currently available tanning agents. Chrome tanned leather also has very good dyeability and affinity towards other post tanning chemicals. On the other hand silica has an ability to preferentially fill the loose portion as well as lubricate<br>
*<br>
the leather due to its intrinsic gelling nature, thereby not only eliminating the need for using acrylic syntans but also reducing the offer of fatliquors. However silica tanning does not increase the shrinkage temperature beyond 90°C and silica tanned leather possesses low strength characteristics.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of a tanning agent, which obviates the drawbacks stated above.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to prepare a compound of chromium and silica, to make use of the advantages of the both, while at the same time obviating the negative attributes associated with them, having active ingredients capable of giving near zero wastage of the metal salt, by adding ligands.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to develop a tanning salt which when used in tanning gives leathers with shrinkage temperature more than 105°C.<br><br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to develop a tanning salt which when used in tanning provides leathers with excellent softness, suppleness, stretch, smoothness, fluffiness and strength.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of a tanning agent, which comprises:<br>

In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the pH of the slurry after ageing may be in the range of 2.5-3.0.<br>

The present invention is described below in detail.<br>
A silica salt, corresponding to 0.1 - 1.5 moles of silica per mole of chromium is mixed with that of hexavalent chromium and 15-30 moles of water per mole of chromium is added to the reaction mixture with continuous stirring. Sulphuric acid calculated as 1.6-4.0moles per mole of chromium is then added to the reaction mixture while continuing the stirring. 0.1 - 0.2 mole of a reducing agent per mole of chromium and 0.1 - 1.0 mole of organic ligand such as dicarboxylic and hydroxy dicarboxylic acid per mole of chromium are added to the above reaction mixture either simultaneously or in different successions, in one or more instalments, with continuous stirring over a period of preferably 1 hr. Stirring is continued for preferably 1 hr even after the complete addition of the above agents. The resultant mixture is then allowed to settle. After a period of 8-12 hrs, pH of the slurry is adjusted in the range of 2.5-3.0 by known method. Solids from the resultant slurry are then separated by known method and the separated reaction mixture is dried by conventional method for 3-60 sec at a temperature in the range of 130-260°C to get the chrome-silica compound.<br>
The novelty of the present invention lies in selecting the starting materials and in<br><br>
providing a process to prepare a chrome-silica compound with additional complexation provided by organic ligands, thereby ensuring, unlike conventional silica based tanning agents, absence of tearability of the leathers on ageing, and facilitating higher uptake of both chromium and silica, resulting not only in the reduction of pollution problem but also in raising the shrinkage temperature of leather above 105°C (at 1.0% metal oxide offer), with an advantage of added properties namely softness, suppleness, stretch and smoothness in the leathers<br>

This mixture was then filtered through a cloth and the filtrate was spray dried at a temperature of 260°C with contact time of 3 sec. The resulting powder of the chromium-silica compound was stored in a plastic container.<br><br>
This product was used for tanning pickled goat skins at an offer of 1.5% metal oxide on pelt weight and the resultant leathers were found to have a shrinkage temperature of 107°C, exhibiting an exhaustion of 89 and 92% for silica and chromium respectively.<br>
The tanned leathers were subsequently post tanned to garments using conventional procedure. The resultant leathers were found to be more soft, supple, stretch and smooth with strength characteristics that are comparable to<br><br>
that of conventional chrome tanned leathers.<br>
Example 7<br>
45 gms of lithium meta silicate (Li2SiO3) was stirred with 149 gms of sodium dichromate in a flask fitted with a stirrer. 360 ml of water was added to the above mass with continuous stirring. 105 ml of 98% sulphuric acid was added slowly to the above reaction mixture.<br>
20 gms of molasses was added to 20 ml of water taken in a beaker and the mixture was added drop by drop by a dropping funnel to the above mass over a period of 20 minutes with continuous stirring. Simultaneously, a mixture of 23.8 gms of adipic acid and 10 gms of citric acid was added to the reaction mixture over a period of 10 minutes. The temperature of the reaction mixture was noted to be 86°C.<br><br>
20 gms of molasses was added to 20 ml of water taken in a beaker and the mixture was added to the above mass over a period of 20 minutes. Simultaneously, a mixture of 20 gms of adipic acid and 11 gms of citric acid was added to the reaction mixture over a period of 10 minutes. The temperature of the reaction mixture was noted to be 90°C.The stirring was continued for another 1 hr after complete addition.<br>
A 10% solution of the above mass was subjected to diphenyl carbazide test<br>
*<br>
whereby chromium(VI) was detected by the formation of slight pink color. Then 7 gms of sodium bisulphite was added to the mixture and the stirring was continued for another 45 minutes.<br>
The reaction mixture thus formed was aged for 12 hrs. The pH of the 1:1 aqueous solution of the above mixture was then checked and was found to be 2.7. This mixture was then filtered through a cloth and the filtrate was spray dried at a temperature of 260°C with contact time of 3 sec. The resulting powder of the chromium-silica compound was stored in a plastic container.<br>
This product was used for tanning pickled goat skins at an offer of 1.5% metal oxide on pelt weight and the resultant leathers were found to have a shrinkage temperature of 110°C, exhibiting an exhaustion of 88 and 90% for silica and chromium respectively.<br>
The  tanned   leathers  were  subsequently   post  tanned  to  garments   using<br><br>
conventional procedure. The resultant leathers were found to be more soft, supple, stretch and smooth with strength characteristics that are comparable to that of conventional chrome tanned leathers.<br>
The advantages of the present invention are the following.<br>
1.	The chromium-silica compound of the present invention exhibits good<br>
solubility in water and is a potential self tanning agent.<br>
2.	The present invention provides a simple process to prepare a matrix of<br>
chromium and silica with additional complexing through organic ligands,<br>
thereby ensuring that the leathers manufactured by using this product do<br>
not tear on ageing and exhibit shrinkage temperature more than 105°C.<br>
3.	Using the chrome-silica compound as a self-tanning agent produces fuller<br>
leathers with no drawn grain appearance.<br>
4.	The product exhibits around 85-95% exhaustion of both chromium and<br>
silica and produces leathers with shrinkage temperature above 105°C.<br>
5.	Shelf life of the product is about 15-24 months.<br>
6.	The leathers tanned by the chromium-silica compound of the present<br>
invention, when treated with lesser amounts of post tanning chemicals<br>
compared to that used in conventional post tanning, exhibit excellent<br>
softness,   suppleness,   stretch,   smoothness,   fluffiness   and   strength.<br><br><br><br>
