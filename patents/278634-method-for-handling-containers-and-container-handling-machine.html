				<td>Method for Handling Containers and Container Handling Machine<br>
The invention relates to a method according to the introductory part of patent claim 1 as<br>
well as to a container handling machine according to the introductory pan of patent<br>
claim 32.<br>
Under the term "containers" in the sense of this invention, one particularly refers to<br>
bottles, cans, tubes and other containers hat are suitable and/or used as packaging agents<br>
for filling substances of various kinds, particularly also for fluid and/or pasty filling<br>
substances.<br>
The term "handling" in the sense of this invention refers to all kinds of handling of<br>
containers, for example cleaning the containers in case of design of the handling machine<br>
as rinser, sterilising the containers if the handling machine is designed as sterilizer, filling<br>
the containers if the handling machine is designed as filling machine, labelling and/or<br>
imprinting the containers if the handling machine is designed as labelling machine,<br>
locking or sealing the containers if the machine is designed as sealing machine etc.;<br>
however, also other forms of handling are conceivable.<br>
While handling such packaging agents or containers., particularly for high capacities<br>
handling machines of rotary type are used namely machines with a continuous or even<br>
pulsed rotor driven to rotate around a vertical machine axis, on which handling of the<br>
containers takes place between a container inlet and the container outlet during the<br>
rotation movement of the rotor. In case of known handling machines, for this handling<br>
positions are formed on the circumference of the rotor distributed in equal angular<br>
distances around the vertical machine axis these handling positions, among other things,<br>
respectively have a container receiver for teceiving a container as well as other specific<br>
functional elements for handling. The containers are fed to the respective handling<br>
position or to the container receiver there at the container inlet formed by a transporting<br>
star. The handled containers are removed from the individual container receivers at a<br>
container outlet similarly formed by a transporting star, for any further application or<br>
 <br>
handling/treatment. The handling takes place on an angular region of the rotation<br>
movement of the rotor between the container inlet and the container outlet. Due to design<br>
reasons as well as space requirements for feeding and removing the containers, this<br>
angular region is lesser than 360° and in case of already existing optimised conditions<br>
should lie in the range of approx. 330°.<br>
In case of high capacities as demanded of handling machines of the rotary type, this<br>
limited angular region of the rotation movement of the rotor available for handling results<br>
in extremely large rotor diameters, in order to allow an adequate handling time for a high<br>
capacity and hence a high rotor rotation speed. Thus for filling machines of higher<br>
capacity, rotor diameters in the range of 7.5 meters are not a rarity.<br>
In order to achieve a high capacity (high number of handled containers per unit of time)<br>
as reduced rotor rotation speed, we know of a container handling machine (WO<br>
2006/011896), in which the handling stations are arranged on the rotor driven to rotate<br>
around the vertical machine axis in several tracks encompassing this machine axis in the<br>
form of circular rings with varying radial distance from the machine axis. The containers<br>
are fed to the handling machine at the container inlet: as multi-track container flow in<br>
such a way that to each track of the fed container flow a track is allocated on the rotor,<br>
i.e. the containers of each track of the fed container flow land on an own track of the rotor<br>
or on the container receivers rotating on this track. Analogously, the handled containers<br>
are removed from the tracks of the rotor as the container outlet and guided away for<br>
further application or handling in the form of a multi-track container flow. Handling of<br>
each container takes place thereby between the container inlet and the container outlet on<br>
an angular region of the rotation movement of the rotor, which (angular region) is lesser<br>
than 360°. Through simultaneous handling of large number of containers on several<br>
tracks of the rotor, although there is an improvement with respect to known machines, in<br>
which the container receivers or the handling stations are foreseen only on a single track<br>
on the rotor circumference, the multi-track feeding and removing of the containers calls<br>
for a cumbersome and even fault-prone design.<br>
 <br>
It is the task of this invention to present a method which allows high capacities with<br>
reduced rotor diameter of the handling machine used, in a simplified design particularly<br>
also of the container inlet and the container outlet.<br>
To fulfil this task, a method according to patent claim 1 has been designed. A handling<br>
machine forms object of the patent claim 32.<br>
In this invention the containers are fed to the at least one container inlet in the form of a<br>
single track container flow and from there handed over to the container receivers passing<br>
by on the first track. In the same way the containers are removed from the container<br>
receivers passing by at the container outlet, one after the other in the form of a single<br>
track container flow, and preferably from those container receivers that pass by at the<br>
container outlet on the first track. During handling a track change takes place at least<br>
once on the rotating rotor for each container or for each container receiver with the<br>
container present there, so that each contaner does not land at the container outlet<br>
already after a rotor rotation by an angular range of lesser than 360°, e.g. 330°, but only<br>
after a rotation movement of the rotor that is significantly greater than this angular range,<br>
e.g. only after the rotation movement of the rotor by about 330° plus 360° or a multiple of<br>
360°. Even with high capacity of the handling machine and hence a high rotor rotation<br>
speed, this would allow adequately long handling period and also with the advantage that<br>
guaranteed and safe feeding and/or removal of the containers can be retained as a single<br>
track container flow.<br>
Extensions of the invention form object of the sub-claims. The invention is explained in<br>
details below on the basis of figures of a design example. The following are shown:<br>
Fig.l In schematic depiction and in top view, a multi-track container handling machine<br>
of rotary type for handling bottles, cans or similar container;<br>
Fig.2 One of the container receiving units of the container handling machine shown in<br>
fig. 1 where the machine is designed as filling machine;<br>
 <br>
Fig.3 A depiction like in fig. 2 with filling elements allocated to each container<br>
receiving unit and moving along with it in case of track change;<br>
Fig.4 A container receiving unit for overhead handling of bottles corresponding to<br>
another design form;<br>
Fig.5-7 Respectively in schematic partial depiction, further design forms of a multi-track<br>
container handling machine.<br>
The container handling machine generally designated as 1 in fig. 1 serves the purpose of<br>
handling containers 2 that are depicted a; cans in figures 1-3. The container handling<br>
machine 1, among other things, consists of a rotor 3 driven to rotate continuously or<br>
discontinuously or in a pulsed manner around a vertical machine axis as indicated by the<br>
arrow A in fig. 1; this rotor 3 has several container receiving units 4 in the region of its<br>
circumference distributed at equal angular distances around the vertical machine axis, and<br>
that too with respectively two container receivers 4.1 and 4.2. In the depicted design<br>
form these are designed as carry plates, on which the containers 2 are held in a suitable<br>
manner during handling standing on their container base, with their container axis<br>
oriented in vertical direction.<br>
Both the container receivers 4.1 and 4.2 o each container receiving unit 4 are<br>
respectively foreseen on a carrying element 5, in the depicted design form drawn on a<br>
vertical carrying element axis TA oriented parallel to the machine axis, lying<br>
diametrically opposite to one another and it the same radial distance from this axis. By<br>
means of a drive (not shown) each container receiving unit 4 or its carrying element 5 can<br>
be rotated or swung in a controlled manner around the axis TA, in such a way that with<br>
respect to the vertical machine axis in one end position of the swivel or rotation<br>
movement the container receivers 4.1 find themselves radially further outwards than the<br>
container receivers 4.2, and in the other end position of the swivel and rotation movement<br>
the container receivers 4.2 find themselves radially further outwards than the container<br>
receivers 4.1.<br>
 <br>
Thus while the rotor 3 is rotating, those container receivers 4.1 or 4.2 that find themselves<br>
further outwards with respect to the vertical machine axis are moved on an outer path or<br>
track 6 and those container receivers 4.2 or 4.1 thai, find themselves further inwards with<br>
respect to the vertical machine axis are moved on an inner path or track 7, where both<br>
tracks 6 or 7 are designed circular and encompassing the vertical machine axis.<br>
The containers 2 to be handled are guided by a protractor 8 and handed over individually<br>
through a transporting star 9 forming the container inlet to a container receiver 4.1 or 4.2<br>
moving past the transporting star 9 on the outer track 6. The handled containers 2 are<br>
removed by a transporting star 10 formin\\ the container outlet from the container<br>
receivers 4.1 or 4.2 moving past this transporting star on the outer track 6 and then<br>
forwarded to a protractor 11 for taking away the handled containers 2.<br>
In details, control of the container handling machine 1 takes place in such a way that each<br>
container 2 handed over with the transpon ing star 9 to a container receiver 4.1 lands at<br>
the transporting star 10 only after almost two rotations of the rotor 3, i.e. only after<br>
passing the transporting stretch formed by both tracks 6 and 7 and is then forwarded by to<br>
the protractor 11.<br>
A container 2 placed on the radially outside line container receiver 4.1 of an observed<br>
container receiving unit 4 while passing the transporting star 9 and moving with the<br>
rotating rotor 3 on the track 6 thus lands with its container receiver 4.1 finally at a<br>
changing position 12 that for example is siiuated in rotation direction A of the rotor 3<br>
before the container outlet formed by the transporting star 10. At this changing position<br>
12 a rotation or swinging of the container receiving unit 4 takes place by 180° around its<br>
axis TA, so that the container 2 moved till ihen with the container receiver 4.1 on the<br>
outer track 6 now starts moving along with its container receiver 4.1 on the inner track 7<br>
and thus finds itself outside the angular range of the transporting star 10. While passing<br>
by the transporting star 10 the already handled container that is now arranged on the<br>
radially outer lying container receiver 4.2 of the observed container receiver unit 4 and is<br>
moved on the track 6, removed and ejected for forwarding to the protractor 11.<br>
 <br>
With the further rotation movement of the rotor 3 the considered container receiver unit 4<br>
again lands into the angular range of the transporting star 9, where then a fresh not yet<br>
handled container 2 can be placed on the outer lying container receiver 4.2. As soon as<br>
the observed container receiver unit 4 again lands at the changing position 12 with the<br>
rotation movement of the rotor 3, a fresh rotation or swinging of the observed container<br>
receiver unit 4 takes place by 180° arourd the axis TA, so that the container 2 on the<br>
container receiver 4.1 now again lying outside and moving on the track 6 is ejected by the<br>
transporting star 10 to the protractor 11.<br>
The containers 2 are guided through the protractor 3 as single track container flow,<br>
handed over by the transporting star 9 in the form of a single track container flow one<br>
after the other to the container receivers, removed by the transporting star 10 one after the<br>
other from the container receivers in the brm of a single track container flow and guided<br>
away through the protractor 11 as single track container flow.<br>
Handling of each container 2 thus takes place respectively on two tracks 6 and 7, i.e. on a<br>
path stretch that almost corresponds to two rotations of the rotor 3. In this way it is<br>
possible, with reduced diameter of the rotor 3 and hence reduced space requirement for<br>
the container handling machine 1, to achieve a high capacity (number of containers 2<br>
processed per unit of time), and that too with a relatively simple design. Rotation or<br>
swinging of the container receiver units 4 around their axes TA takes place either<br>
compulsively controlled with the rotation movement of the rotor 3 through gears and/or<br>
curve controls or even through independent drives that can be controlled as desired with<br>
respect to rotation speed, rotation angle ar d rotation direction.<br>
If the container handling machine 1 is a filling machine, then as shown in fig. 2, several<br>
filling elements 13 are foreseen above trac ks 6 and 7 distributed around the vertical<br>
machine axis at equal angular distances in such a way that these filling elements 13 rotate<br>
with the rotor 3. In this design form, two rilling elements 13 are allocated to each<br>
container receiver unit 4, one filling element 13 above the track 6 and one filling element<br>
13 above the track 7 in such a way that these filling elements 13 find themselves exactly<br>
 <br>
above the container receivers 4.1 or 4.2 in the end positions of the swinging or rotation<br>
movement of the container receiver uni:s 4. The number of filling elements distributed<br>
on both tracks 6 and 7 is thus equal to the number of container receivers 4.1 and 4.2 of<br>
each container receiver unit multiplied by the number of these units.<br>
After handing over a container 2 to a container receiver 4.1 moving on the track 6, in a<br>
first filling phase a partial filling of this container 2 takes place with the filling element<br>
13 allocated to the track 6. Before reaching the changing position 12 the filling process is<br>
interrupted. After the track change the filling process for the container 2 still on the<br>
container receiver 4.1 but now moving on track 7 is continued in second filling phase<br>
with the filling element 13 allocated to this track 7, till the changing position 12 is<br>
reached once again. After a fresh track change, after-filling of the container 2 moved<br>
along with the' container receiver 4.1 again on the track 6 can take place till reaching the<br>
transporting star 10. The quantity of fi ling substance introduced and measured in both<br>
the filling phases into the respective container is added up, so that the filling quantity<br>
required for after-filling for the containers 2 can be kept very precise. Filling of such<br>
containers 2 that are handed over by the transporting star 9 to the container receivers 4.2<br>
takes place in an analogous manner.<br>
Obviously also other methods are possible, e.g. a pre-handling of the containers on the<br>
track 6 or on a partial length of this trat k and subsequent filling on the track 7 etc.<br>
Fig. 3 shows in a depiction like in fig. 2 a further design form, in which the filling<br>
elements 13 allocated to each containei receiver unit 4 are foreseen respectively above a<br>
container receiver 4.1 and 4.2 and are swung along with the container receiver unit 4<br>
while swinging around the axis TA. Through flexible lines 14 (e.g. hose pipes) the filling<br>
elements 13 are connected to the annular tank 15 foreseen on the rotor 3 and containing<br>
the fluid filling substance.<br>
This design form, in which not only the container receivers 4.1 and 4.2 but also the other<br>
functional elements of each handling position are swivelled for changing the tracks 6 and<br>
 <br>
7 around the respective axis TA, has the advantage that handling each container 2 does<br>
not have to be stopped during track changing, i.e. there has to be no interruption at the<br>
changing position 12, but can be carried out continuously, so that the time available for<br>
the respective handling at a certain rotation speed of the rotor 3 gets significantly<br>
extended as compared to the design in fig. 2. Instead of joining the filling elements 13<br>
with hoses 14, a rotary distributor can also be foreseen that joins each filling element 13<br>
with the annular tank 15, whereby this rotary distributor can also simultaneously have<br>
control functions.<br>
Figure 4 shows very schematically and in a depiction similar to figures 2 and 3, a<br>
container receiver unit 4a of a machine for handling containers 2a in the form of bottles.<br>
Similar to the way described for the container receiver unit 4, the container receiver unit<br>
4a is also arranged with several same container receiver units 4a on the circumference<br>
region of the rotor rotating around the vertical machine axis. Each container receiver unit<br>
4a has two container receivers 4a. 1 and 4a.2 that are respectively formed by a swivel arm<br>
16 with gripper on the carrier element 5a Each swivel arm 16 is designed in such a way<br>
that it grips the container to be handled it the region of the container opening or bottle<br>
opening, i.e. at the bottle neck and hold it tight. The swivel arms 16 can respectively be<br>
swivelled about a horizontal axis that is oriented tangential to the rotation direction A of<br>
the rotor 3. With the help of the swivel arms 15 the containers 2a can be swivelled from a<br>
normal position, in which the container opening lies above, into a handling or overhead<br>
position, in which the containers 2a are held with their container opening lying below,<br>
and that too with the container axis oriented in vertical direction.<br>
For handling the containers 2a are moved in their overhead position on the tracks 6 and 7,<br>
whereby during the handling again at leas: one track change takes place at the changing<br>
position 12, and that too by rotating or swivelling the container receiver units 4a or the<br>
carrier elements 5a about their carrier axis TA oriented parallel to the vertical machine<br>
axis. Handing over of each container 2a to a container receiver 4a. 1 or 4a.2 moving on<br>
the track 6 takes place at the container ink t in the normal position (with the container<br>
opening on top). In this normal position also handing over of each handled container 2a<br>
 <br>
takes place at the container outlet. Handing of the containers 2a takes place in this design<br>
form under track change twice, as has been described above in connection with fig. 2. In<br>
this design form the containers 2a are fed to the machine or to the container inlet again as<br>
single track container flow. The handled containers 2a are individually removed one<br>
after the other at the container outlet from the rotor 3 or the container receivers 4a. 1 or<br>
4a.2 and guided out of the machine as single track container flow.<br>
Fig. 1 - 4 relate to design forms, in which each container receiver unit 4 or 4a has two<br>
container receivers 4.1, 4.2 or 4a. 1 and 41.2. Obviously there is also the possibility of<br>
designing of container receiver units in such a way that for example more than two<br>
container receivers are foreseen staggered at the same radial distance about the receiver<br>
axis TA.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a version in which on the circumference region of the rotor 3 container<br>
receiver units 4b are foreseen which in their functioning correspond to the container<br>
receiver unit 4, however respectively have altogether four container receivers 4b. 1 - 4b.4.<br>
In this design form the individual container receiver units 4b are controlled in such a way<br>
that each container received by a container receiver 4b. 1 - 4b.4 is moved with the<br>
rotating rotor 3 on altogether four tracks, namely on the outer track 6, on the track 7<br>
adjacent to the track 6 and lying further in wards, on a track 7.1 adjacent to track 7 and<br>
lying still further inwards, as well as once again on the track 7 till the respective container<br>
after changing tracks once again lands at the container outlet on track 6.<br>
The end positions of the swivel movement or rotation movement of the container receiver<br>
units 4b about their axes TA are selected ir such a manner that in each end position a<br>
container receiver finds itself on track 6, ar other container receiver finds itself on track<br>
7.1 and two container receivers find themselves on track 7, i.e. in the situation depicted in<br>
fig. 6 the container receiver 4b. 1 finds itself on track 6, the container receiver 4b.3 on<br>
track 7.1 and both the container receivers 4b.2 and 4b.4 on track 7.<br>
 <br>
For explaining the effectiveness we once again consider one container receiver unit 4b<br>
and it is assumed that the container rece iver 4.b 1 of this container receiver unit while<br>
passing by the container inlet (transporting star 9) finds itself on the outer lying track 6,<br>
i.e. one container is handed over to this container receiver 4b. 1 and subjected to the<br>
handling allocated to track 6.<br>
With the rotating rotor 3 this container receiver unit 4b then lands at the changing<br>
position 12, in which the container receiver unit 4b is swivelled about its axis TA by 90°<br>
for track changing, so that the container receiver 4b. 1 then finds itself on track 7 and that<br>
too on the advancing side of the container receiver unit 4b with respect to the rotation<br>
direction A of the rotor 3, and the container there is subjected to the handling allocated to<br>
track 7 as well as the advancing position<br>
If the considered container receiver unit 4b with the rotating rotor 3 once again lands at<br>
the changing position 12, then a further rotation of this container receiver unit 4b by 90°<br>
follows, so that the container situated on the container receiver 4b. 1 now moves on the<br>
inner lying track 7.1 and is subjected to the handling there. On once again reaching the<br>
switching position or changing position 12 a fresh rotation of the container receiver unit<br>
4b by 90° takes place, so that the container receiver 4b. 1 and the container there again<br>
land on the track 7, however on the following side of the container receiver unit 4b with<br>
respect to the rotation direction A of the rotor 3, so that the container arranged on the<br>
container receiver 4b. 1 is subjected to the handling allocated to the track 7 as well as to<br>
the following position. This handling can be different from the handling at the advancing<br>
position.<br>
On passing the changing position 12 the next time once again a rotation of the container<br>
receiver unit 4b by 90° takes place, so that the container receiver 4b. 1 with its container<br>
because of the fresh track change again lands on track 6 and is ejected out of the machine<br>
on this track at the container outlet.<br>
 <br>
Each container positioned on a container receiver 4b. 1 - 4b.3 of a container receiver unit<br>
4b is thus moved during its handling on altogether four tracks, namely respectively once<br>
on track 6 and track 7.1 and twice on track 7, so that only after passing the changing<br>
position 12 four times the respective container is ejected out of the machine. In this way,<br>
even with small diameter of the rotor 3 once obtains an extremely long handling stretch<br>
and hence also with higher rotation speed of the rotor 3 and adequately long handling<br>
duration.<br>
It is obvious that even in this design form at every other container receiver 4b.2 - 4b.4<br>
that while passing the container inlet formed by the transporting star 9 moves on the outer<br>
track 6, respectively one container is handed over that is moved on the different tracks 6,<br>
7 and 7.1 in the same manner as described above for the container receiver 4b. 1 of the<br>
considered container receiver unit 4b.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a design form that only differs from the design form shown in fig. 5 mainly<br>
in that the control of the container receiver units designated there as 4b takes place in<br>
such a way that in each end position of the swivel movement or rotation movement of the<br>
container receiver units two container receivers, namely in the situations depicted in fig.<br>
6 the container receivers 4b. 1 and 4b.4, find themselves on track 6 and two container<br>
receivers, namely the container receivers 4b.2 and 4b.3 depicted in fig. 6, find themselves<br>
on track 7. Each time while passing the changing position 12, for track changing a<br>
swivelling of each container receiver unit 4b takes place about the axis TA either by 90°<br>
or even by 180°.<br>
In the first case (swivelling by 90°) the corresponding machine is designed in such a way<br>
that handing over of a container to the container receiver as well as removal of a<br>
container from a container receiver is only possible if this container receiver is on track 6<br>
and has a pre-given positioning with respect to the remaining container receivers of the<br>
respective container receiver unit 4b, e.g. the position of the container receiver 4b. 1<br>
shown in fig. 6. In this version again each container arranged on a container receiver<br>
during handling, i.e. between handover to a container receiver and ejection out of the<br>
 <br>
machine, moves on four tracks, namely first on track 6, then twice on track 7 and finally<br>
once again on track 6.<br>
In the second case (swivelling by 180°) the container receiver unit 4b are arranged on the<br>
circumference region of the rotor 3 in such a way that the container receivers 4b 1 - 4b4<br>
on the outer track 6 have the same distance from one another, i.e. the distance between<br>
two container receivers of each container receiver unit situated on the outer track 6 also<br>
has the same distance that the successively following container receivers of adjacent<br>
container receiver unit 4b have from one another in rotation direction A of the rotor 3. At<br>
each container receiver that is moved past the container inlet formed by the transporting<br>
star 9 on track 6, respectively one contair er can be handed over. Analogously, out of all<br>
the container receivers moved past the container outlet on track 6 the respectively<br>
handled container can be removed and ejected.<br>
Handling of each container takes place on two tracks 6 and 7 with track changing twice,<br>
so that this version ultimately conforms tc the version shown in fig. 1, with the only<br>
difference that each container receiver unit 4b has not only two container receivers but<br>
altogether four container receivers 4b 1 - 4b4.<br>
Fig. 7 shows in schematic depiction, yet another possible design form of a machine with<br>
container receiver unit 4c on the circumference region of the rotor 3. Each container<br>
arrangement 4c has three container receivers 4c. 1, 4c.2 and 4c.3 that are respectively<br>
foreseen staggered by 120° about the receiving axis TA and at the same radial distance<br>
from this axis.<br>
The containers handled and arranged on the container receivers 4c. 1, 4c.2 and 4c.3 are<br>
moved during handling on three tracks 6, 7 and 7.1 by rotating each container receiver<br>
unit 4c thrice about the axis TA by respectively 120°.<br>
It is common to all described design forms that the containers 2 or 2a are fed as single<br>
track container flow in the container inlet and handed over there respectively in a single<br>
 <br>
track container flow one after the other o the container receivers passing by the container<br>
handover on the outer track 6, and the handled containers are removed from the container<br>
receivers passing by the container outlet on the outer track 6 in the form of a single track<br>
container flow. Handing over the containers to the machine as well as guided away the<br>
containers out of the machine one can thus takes place with simple and proven agents,<br>
which very significantly contributes to the operation safety of the respective handling<br>
machine one.<br>
The container handling machines 1 can be designed for various handling purposes, for<br>
example also as rinser, sterilizer, sealer, labelling machine etc. The container receivers<br>
and also the functional elements use for handling can have different designs adapted to<br>
the particular purpose of application and/or to the respective type, shape and/or size of<br>
the containers.<br>
According to the invention it is also particularly foreseen that the container receiver can<br>
be designed as so called neck ring supports, so that the containers 2 after their handover<br>
the rotor 3 of the container handling machine do not stand on their container base, but are<br>
held at a collar designed below the container mouth. The expert knows such extensions<br>
and method procedures by the term "neck handling", so that a detailed description is<br>
being left out at this point.<br>
Besides, it is common to all design forms hat the container receivers 4.1,4.2, 4a. 1,4a.2,<br>
4b. l _ 4b.4 or 4c. 1 - 4c.3 are designed in such a way that the containers 2 or 2a are held<br>
secured at these container receivers, particularly also against the centrifugal forces<br>
generated by the rotation movement of the rotor 3.<br>
The invention has been described above on the basis of a design example. It is obvious<br>
that numerous alterations and variations are possible without departing from the basic<br>
concept of the invention.<br>
