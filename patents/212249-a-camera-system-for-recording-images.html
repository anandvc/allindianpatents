Fig. 5 illustrates the utilization of an apparatus of the preferred embodiment.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED AND OTHER EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the preferred embodiment a magnetic sensitive print media material is utilized for the recording of an audio message on the back of an output photograph. The Artcam device is<br><br>
altered so as to include a magnetic recording device which can comprise an array of magnetic recorders covering a whole surface of the photograph or alternatively, a magnetic strip can be provided wherein, for example, a central portion of the photograph is magnetically sensitive. The Artcam devices are fiurher provided with the ability to record an audio message for later playback.<br>
The preferred embodiment is preferably implemented through suitable programming of a hand held camera device such as that described in Australian Provisional Patent Application No. P07991 USSN 09/113,060) entitled "Image Processing Method and Apparatus (Art 01)" filed 15 July, 1997.<br>
The aforementioned patent specification discloses a camera system, hereinafter known as an "Artcam" type camera, wherein sensed images can be directly printed out by an Artcam portable camera unit Further, the aforementioned specification discloses means and methods for performing various manipulations on images captured by the camera sensing device leading to the production of various effects in any output image. The manipulations are disclosed to be highly flexible in nature and can be implemented through the insertion into the Artcam of cards having encoded thereon various instructions for the manipulation of images, the cards hereinafter being known as Artcards, The Artcam further has significant onboard processing power by an Artcam Central Processor unit (ACP) which is interconnected to a memory device for the storage of important data and images.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the Artcam device is suitably modified so as to equip it with a microphone device and associated recording technologies. When a picture is taken, the opportunity is provided to record either the surrounding sound environment or a message associated with the image. The print media or film is pretreated so as to make it . magnetically sensitive in a similar manner to that provided by tape media. The recording can be over the whole back surface of the output photo or alternatively a magnetically sensitive strip may be provided. The recorded audio is stored on the back of the output photograph m an encoded format, the encoding preferably being of a highly digital resilient form. The recorded audio provides a permanent audio record associated with the corresponding photograph Subsequently, a playback apparatus is provided for scanning the encoded audio and decoding this information.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 1, there is illustrated, in schematic form the preferred embodiment 1 which includes the arrangement as described in the aforementioned patent specification wherein an image 2 is sensed via a CCD sensor 3 and forwarded to an Artcam<br><br>
central processor 4 which includes significant computational resources as described in the aforementioned patent specification. The Artcam central processor 4 can store the image in memory 5 which preferably comprises a high speed RAMBUS (Trade Mark) interfaced memory'. The Artcam central processor 4 is also responsible for controlling the operation of a printhead 6 for the printing out of full colour photographs, eg. 7, so as to provide for instant images on demand in addition to, the magnetic recording head 16, for recording on the back of the photo.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the camera arrangement 1 is also supplied with a sound chip 10 which interfaces via R-AMBUS bus 11 to memory 5 under the control of the ACP processor 4. The sound chip 10 can be of a standard or specialised form and can, for example, comprise a DSP processor that takes an analogue input 12 from a sound microphone 13. Alternatively, with increasing chip complexities (Moore's Law), the functionality of sound chip 10 can be incorporated onto the ACP chip 4 which preferably comprises a leading edge CMOS type integrated circuit chip. It will be readily evident that many other types of arrangements can be provided which fall within the scope of the present invention-<br>
The sound chip 10 converts the analogue input 12 to a corresponding digital fonn and forwards it for storage in memory 5. The recording process can be activated by means of the depressing of a button (not shown) on the camera device, the button being imder the control of the ACP processor 4 otherwise it can be substantially automatic when taking a photo. The recorded data is stored in the memory 5.<br>
Turning now to Fig, 2, the camera arrangement preferably includes a printer device 6 such as an ink jet printer which includes a printhead 6 to print an image on compatible print media 17 and a magnetic recording head 16. A further printhead can be used to print information on the back of print media 17. Similar arrangements for printing information on the back ofan output photo image are described in USSN 09/112,741 (Art 12) the contents of which are hereby incorporated by cross reference.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 3, there is illustrated an example of a magnetic strip 18 fomied on the back of photo media 17, the strip being recorded on by recording head 16 of Fig. 1 or Fig. 2. The information recorded can include location, date and time data with the location data being provided by means of keyboard input or, alternatively, through the inclusion of a positioning systems such as GPS or the like. Fig 4 shows the back of the image 17 on which is also recorded an encoded form 22 of the audio information. The<br><br>
format of the encoding can be any form within the knowledge of the person skilled in the art. However, preferably the encoding provides a highly fault tolerant form of encoding to tolerate errors that may arise due to use and handling of the print media. The encoding format can be, for example, Reed-Solomon encoding of the data to provide for a high degree of fault tolerance.<br>
Turning to Fig. 4, when it is desired to "play back" the recorded audio, the photo 17 is passed through a reader device 26 which includes pinch rollers for guiding the photo 17 past a magnetic sensor device 27.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 5, there is illustrated in schematic form the operation of the audio reader device 26 of Fig. 5. The magnetic sensor 27 is interconnected to a second Artcam central processor (ACP) 28 which is suitably adapted to read and decode the data stored on the back of the photograph. The decoded audio information is stored in memory 32 for playback via a sound processing chip 35 on speaker 29. The sound processing chip 35 can operate under the control of the ACP decoder 28 which in turn operates under the control of various user input controls 33 which can include volume controls, rewind, play and fast forward controls etc.<br>
It can be seen from the foregoing description of the preferred embodiment that there is provided a system for the automatic recording of audio associated with an output image so as to provide an audio record associated with a photograph printed on ink jet media. There is also disclosed an audio reader system for reading an image recorded on the back of such a photograph.<br>
It would be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications any be made to the present invention as shown in the specific embodiment without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. For example, the utilisation of more complex audio recording and playback techniques such as stereo and B-format techniques. The present embodiment is, dierefore, to be considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive. Ink Jet Technologies<br>
The embodiments of the invention use an ink jet printer type device. Of course many different devices could be used. However presently popular ink jet printing technologies are unlikely to be suitable.<br>
The most significant problem with thermal ink jet is power consumption. This is approximately 100 times that required for high speed, and stems from the energy-inefficient<br><br>
means of drop ejection. Tnis involves the rapid boiling of water to produce a vapor bubble which, expels the ink. Water has a very- high heat capacity, and must be superheated in thermal Inkjet applications. This leads to an efficiency of around 0.02%, from electricity input to drop momentum (and increased surface area) out.<br>
The most significant problem with piezoelectric ink jet is size and cost. Piezoelectric crystals have a very small deflection at reasonable drive voltages, and therefore require a large area for each nozzle. Also, each piezoelectric actuator must be connected to its drive circuit on a separate substrate. This is not a significant problem at the current limit of around 300 nozzles per print head, but is a major impediment to the fabrication of pagewide print heads with 19,200 nozzles.<br>
Ideally, the ink jet technologies used meet the stringent requirements of in-caraera digital color printing and other high quality, high speed, low cost printing applications. To meet the requirements of digital photography, new Inkjet technologies have been created. The target features include:<br>
low power (less than 10 Watts)<br>
high resolution capability (1,600 dpi or more)<br>
photographic quality output<br>
low manufacturing cost<br>
small size (pagewidth times minimum cross section)<br>
high speed (
All of these features can be met or exceeded by the Inkjet systems described below with differing levels of difficulty. 45 different ink jet technologies have been developed by the Assignee to give a wide range of choices for high volume manufacture. These technologies form part of separate applications assigned to the present Assignee as set out in the table below..<br>
The Inkjet designs shown here are suitable for a wide range of digital printing systems, from battery powered one-time use digital cameras, through to desktop and network printers, and through to commercial printing systems.<br>
For ease of manufacture using standard process equipment, the print head is designed to be a monolithic 0.5 micron CMOS chip with MEMS post processing. For color photographic applications, the print head is 100 mm long, with a width which depends upon the ink jet type. The smallest print head designed is IJ38, which is 0.35 mm wide, giving a chip area of 35 square mm. The print heads each contain 19,200 nozzles plus data and control<br><br>
circuitry.<br>
Ink is supplied to the back of the print head by injection molded plastic ink channels. The molding requires 50 micron features, which can be created using a lithographically micromachined insert in a standard injection molding tool. Ink flows through holes etched through the wafer to the nozzle chambers fabricated on the front surface of the wafer. The print head is connected to the camera circuitry' by tape automated bonding. Tables of Drop-on-Demand Ink Jets<br>
Eleven important characteristics of the fundamental operation of individual Inkjet nozzles have been identified. These characteristics are largely orthogonal, and so can be elucidated as an eleven dimensional matrix. Most of the eleven axes of this matrix include entries developed by the present assignee.<br>
The following tables form the axes of an eleven dimensional table of ink jet types.<br>
Actuator mechanism (18 types)<br>
Basic operation mode (7 types)<br>
Auxiliary mechanism (8 types)<br>
Actuator amplification or modification method (17 types)<br>
Actuator motion (19 types)<br>
Nozzle refill method (4 types)<br>
Method of restricting back-flow through inlet (10 types)<br>
Nozzle clearing method (9 types)<br>
Nozzle plate construction (9 types)<br>
Drop ejection direction (5 types)<br>
Ink type (7 types)<br>
The complete eleven dimensional table represented by these axes contains 36,9 billion possible configurations of ink jet nozzle. While not all of the possible combinations result in a viable Inkjet technology, many million configurations are viable. It is clearly impractical to elucidate all of the possible configurations. Instead, certain Inkjet types have been investigated in detail. These are designated IJOl to IJ45 above.<br>
Other ink jet configuradons can readily be derived from these 45 examples by substituting alternative configurations along one or more of the 11 axes. Most of the IJOl to IJ45 examples can be made into Inkjet print heads with characteristics superior to any currently available ink jet technology.<br>
Where there are prior art examples known to the inventor, one or more of these<br><br>
examples are listed in the examples column of the tables below. The IJOl to IJ45 series are<br>
also listed in the examples column. In some cases, a printer may be listed more than once in a<br>
table, where it shares characteristics with more than one entry.<br>
Suitable applications for the Inkjet technologies include: Home printers, Office<br>
network printers, Short run digital printers, Commercial print systems, Fabric printers.<br>
Pocket printers, Internet WWW' printers. Video printers, Medical imaging, Wide format<br>
printers, Notebook PC printers, Fax machines, Industrial printing systems, Photocopiers,<br>
Photographic minilabs etc.<br>
The information associated with the aforementioned 11 dimensional matrix are set out in the following tables.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
