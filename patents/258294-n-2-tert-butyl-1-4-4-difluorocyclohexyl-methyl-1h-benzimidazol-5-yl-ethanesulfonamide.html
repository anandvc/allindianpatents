BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the invention<br>
The invention is related to therapeutic compounds, pharmaceutical<br>
compositions containing these compounds, manufacturing processes thereof and uses<br>
thereof. Particularly, the present invention is related to compounds that may be<br>
effective in treating pain, cancer, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's<br>
chorea, Alzheimer's disease, anxiety disorders, gastrointestinal disorders and/or<br>
cardiovascular disorders.<br>
2. Discussion of Relevant Technology<br>
Pain management has been studied for many years. It is known that<br>
cannabinoid receptor (e.g., CBi receptor, CB2 receptor) ligands including agonists,<br>
antagonists and inverse agonists produce relief of pain in a variety of animal models<br>
by interacting with CBi and/or CBa receptors. Generally, CBi receptors are located<br>
predominately in the central nervous system, whereas CBj receptors are located<br>
primarily in the periphery and are primarily restricted to the ceils and tissues derived<br>
from the immune system.<br>
While CBi receptor agonists, such as A9-tetrahydrocannabinol (A9-THC) and<br>
anadamide, are useful in anti-nociception models in animals, they tend to exert<br>
undesired CNS side-effects, e.g., psychoactive side effects, the abuse potential, drug<br>
dependence and tolerance, etc. These undesired side effects are known to be<br>
mediated by the CBi receptors located in CNS. There are lines of evidence, however,<br>
suggesting that CBj agonists acting at peripheral sites or with limited CNS exposure<br>
can manage pain in humans or animals with much improved overall in vivo profile.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for new CBi receptor ligands such as agonists that<br>
may be useful in managing pain or treating other related symptoms or diseases with<br>
reduced or minimal undesirable CNS side-effects.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention provides CBi receptor ligands which may be useful in<br>

and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention provides a compound selected from<br>
and phannaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
It will be understood that when compounds of the present invention contain<br>
one or more chiral centers, the compounds of the invention may exist in, and be<br>
isolated as, enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms, or as a racemic mixture. The<br>
present invention includes any possible enantiomers, diastereomers, racernates or<br>
mixtures thereof, of a compound of Formula I. The optically active forms of the<br>
compound of the invention may be prepared, for example, by chiral chromatographic<br>
separation of a racemate, by synthesis from optically active starting materials or by<br>
asymmetric synthesis based on the procedures described thereafter.<br>
It will also be appreciated that certain compounds of the present invention may<br>
exist as geometrical isomers, for example E and Z isomers of alkenes. The present<br>
invention includes any geometrical isomer of a compound of Formula I. It will<br>
further be understood that the present invention encompasses tautomers of the<br>
compounds of the Formula I.<br>
It will also be understood that certain compounds of the present invention may<br>
exist in solvated, for example hydrated, as well as unsolvated forms. It will further be<br>
understood that the present invention encompasses all such solvated forms of the<br>
compounds of the Formula I.<br>
Within the scope of the invention are also salts of the compounds of the<br>
Formula I. Generally, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of the present<br>
invention may be obtained using standard procedures well known in the art, for<br>
example by reacting a sufficiently basic compound, for example an alkyl amine with a<br>
suitable acid, for example, HC1 or acetic acid, to afford a physiologically acceptable<br>
anion. It may also be possible to make a corresponding alkali metal (such as sodium,<br>
potassium, or lithium) or an alkaline earth metal (such as a calcium) salt by treating a<br>
compound of the present invention having a suitably acidic proton, such as a<br>
carboxylic acid or a phenol with one equivalent of an alkali metal or alkaline earth<br>
metal hydroxide or alkoxide (such as the ethoxide or methoxide), or a suitably basic<br>
organic amine (such as choline or meglumine) in an aqueous medium, followed by<br>
conventional purification techniques.<br>
In one embodiment, the compound of Formula I above may be converted to a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, particularly, an acid addition salt<br>
such as a hydrochloride, hydrobromide, phosphate, acetate, fumarate, maleate,<br>
tartrate, citrate, methanesulphonate or p-toluenesulphonate.<br>
We have now found that the compounds of the invention have activity as<br>
Pharmaceuticals, in particular as modulators or ligands such as agonists, partial<br>
agonists, inverse agonist or antagonists of CBi receptors. More particularly, the<br>
compounds of the invention exhibit selective activity as agonist of the CB] receptors<br>
and are useful in therapy, especially for relief of various pain conditions such as<br>
chronic pain, neuropathic pain, acute pain, cancer pain, pain caused by rheumatoid<br>
arthritis, migraine, visceral pain etc. This list should however not be interpreted as<br>
exhaustive. Additionally, compounds of the present invention are useful in other<br>
disease states in which dysfunction of CBj receptors is present or implicated.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of the invention may be used to treat cancer, multiple<br>
sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, Alzheimer's disease, anxiety<br>
disorders, gastrointestinal disorders and cardiovascular disorders.<br>
Compounds of the invention are useful as immunomodulators, especially for<br>
autoimmune diseases, such as arthritis, for skin grafts, organ transplants and similar<br>
surgical needs, for collagen diseases, various allergies, for use as anti-tumour agents<br>
and anti viral agents.<br>
Compounds of the invention are useful in disease states where degeneration or<br>
dysfunction of cannabinoid receptors is present or implicated in that paradigm. This<br>
may involve the use of isotopically labelled versions of the compounds of the<br>
invention in diagnostic techniques and imaging applications such as positron emission<br>
tomography (PET).<br>
Compounds of the invention are useful for the treatment of diarrhoea,<br>
depression, anxiety and stress-related disorders such as post-traumatic stress<br>
disorders, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and obsessive<br>
compulsive disorder, urinary incontinence, premature ejaculation, various mental<br>
illnesses, cough, lung oedema, various gastro-intestinal disorders, e.g. constipation,<br>
functional gastrointestinal disorders such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Functional<br>
Dyspepsia, Parkinson's disease and other motor disorders, traumatic brain injury,<br>
stroke, cardioprotection following miocardial infarction, spinal injury and drug<br>
addiction, including the treatment of alcohol, nicotine, opioid and other drug abuse<br>
and for disorders of the sympathetic nervous system for example hypertension.<br>
Compounds of the invention are useful as an analgesic agent for use during<br>
general anaesthesia and monitored anaesthesia care. Combinations of agents with<br>
different properties are often used to achieve a balance of effects needed to maintain<br>
the anaesthetic state (e.g. amnesia, analgesia, muscle relaxation and sedation).<br>
Included in this combination are inhaled anaesthetics, hypnotics, anxiolytics,<br>
neuromuscular blockers and opioids.<br>
Also within the scope of the invention is the use of any of the compounds<br>
according to the Formula I above, for the manufacture of a medicament for the<br>
treatment of any of the conditions discussed above.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is a method for the treatment of a subject<br>
suffering from any of the conditions discussed above, whereby an effective amount of<br>
a compound according to the Formula I above, is administered to a patient in need of<br>
such treatment.<br>
Thus, the invention provides a compound of Formula I or pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt or solvate thereof, as hereinbefore defined for use in therapy.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides the use of a compound of<br>
Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, as hereinbefore<br>
defined in the manufacture of a medicament for use in therapy.<br>
In the context of the present specification, the term "therapy" also includes<br>
"prophylaxis" unless there are specific indications to the contrary. The term<br>
"therapeutic" and "therapeutically" should be contrued accordingly. The term<br>
"therapy" within the context of the present invention further encompasses to<br>
administer an effective amount of a compound of the present invention, to mitigate<br>
either a pre-existing disease state, acute or chronic, or a recurring condition. This<br>
definition also encompasses prophylactic therapies for prevention of recurring<br>
conditions and continued therapy for chronic disorders.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are useful in therapy, especially for<br>
the therapy of various pain conditions including, but not limited to: acute pain,<br>
chronic pain, neuropathic pain, back pain, cancer pain, and visceral pain.<br>
In use for therapy in a warm-blooded animal such as a human, the compound<br>
of the invention may be administered in the form of a conventional pharmaceutical<br>
composition by any route including orally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, topically,<br>
intranasally, intraperitoneally, intrathoracially, intravenously, epidurally,<br>
intrathecally, transdermally, intracerebroventricularly and by injection into the joints.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the route of administration maybe oral,<br>
intravenous or intramuscular.<br>
The dosage will depend on the route of administration, the severity of the<br>
disease, age and weight of the patient and other factors normally considered by the<br>
attending physician, when determining the individual regimen and dosage level at the<br>
most appropriate for a particular patient.<br>
For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds of this<br>
invention, inert, phannaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid and liquid.<br>
Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules,<br>
cachets, and suppositories.<br>
A solid carrier can be one or more substances, which may also act as diluents,<br>
flavoring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, or table<br>
disintegrating agents; it can also be an encapsulating material.<br>
In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid, which is in a mixture with the<br>
finely divided compound of the invention, or the active component. In tablets, the<br>
active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding properties in<br>
suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired.<br>
For preparing suppository compositions, a low-melting wax such as a mixture<br>
of fatty acid glycerides and cocoa butter is first melted and the active ingredient is<br>
dispersed therein by, for example, stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture in then<br>
poured into convenient sized moulds and allowed to cool and solidity.<br>
Suitable earners are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, lactose,<br>
sugar, pectin, dextrin, starch, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose, a low-melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like.<br>
The term composition is also intended to include the formulation of the active<br>
component with encapsulating material as a carrier providing a capsule in which the<br>
active component (with or without other carriers) is surrounded by a carrier which is<br>
thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets are included.<br>
Tablets, powders, cachets, and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms<br>
suitable for oral administration.<br>
Liquid form compositions include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. For<br>
example, sterile water or water propylene glycol solutions of the active compounds<br>
may be liquid preparations suitable for parenteral administration. Liquid<br>
compositions can also be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol<br>
solution.<br>
Aqueous solutions for oral administration can be prepared by dissolving the<br>
active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavoring agents, stabilizers,<br>
and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous suspensions for oral use can be made by<br>
dispersing the finely divided active component in water together with a viscous<br>
material such as natural synthetic gums, resins, methyl cellulose, sodium<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose, and other suspending agents known to the pharmaceutical<br>
formulation art.<br>
Depending on the mode of administration, the pharmaceutical composition<br>
will preferably include from 0.05% to 99%w (per cent by weight), more preferably<br>
from 0.10 to 50%w, of the compound of the invention, all percentages by weight<br>
being based on total composition.<br>
A therapeutically effective amount for the practice of the present invention<br>
may be determined, by the use of known criteria including the age, weight and<br>
response of the individual patient, and interpreted within the context of the disease<br>
which is being treated or which is being prevented, by one of ordinary skills in the art.<br>
Within the scope of the invention is the use of any compound of Formula I as<br>
defined above for the manufacture of a medicament.<br>
Also within the scope of the invention is the use of any compound of Formula<br>
I for the manufacture of a medicament for the therapy of pain.<br>

but not limited to: acute pain, chronic pain, neuropathic pain, back pain, cancer pain,<br>
and visceral pain.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is a method for therapy of a subject suffering<br>
from any of the conditions discussed above, whereby an effective amount of a<br>
compound according to the Formula I above, is administered to a patient in need of<br>
such therapy.<br>
Additionally, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a<br>
compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in association<br>
with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>

9Human CBi receptor from Receptor Biology (hCBi) or human CBa receptor<br>
membranes (BioSignal) are thawed at 37 °C, passed 3 times through a 25-gauge<br>
blunt-end needle and diluted in the GTPyS binding buffer (50 mM Hepes, 20 mM<br>
NaOH, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA). The EC50<br>
and Eaax of the compounds of the invention are evaluated from 10-point doseresponse<br>
curves done in SOOul with the appropriate amount of membrane protein and<br>
100000-130000 dpm of GTPg35S per well (0.11 -0.14 nM). The basal and maximal<br>
stimulated binding is determined in absence and presence of 1 uM (hCBi) or 10 uM<br>
(hCBj) Win 55,212-2 respectively. The membranes are pre-incubated for 5 minutes<br>
with 56.25 jiM (hCB2) or 112.5 uM (hCBi) GDP prior to distribution in plates (15<br>
uM (hCB2) or 30 uM (hCBj) GDP final). The plates are vortexed and incubated for<br>
60 minutes at room temperature, filtered on Unifilters GF/B (presoaked in water) with<br>
the Tomtec or Packard harvester using 3 ml of wash buffer (50 mM Tris, 5 mM<br>
MgCl2,50 mM NaCl, pH 7.0). The filters are dried for 1 hour at 55 °C. The<br>
radioactivity (cpm) is counted in a TopCount (Packard) after adding 65 ul/well of<br>
MS-20 scintillation liquid. Antagonist reversal studies are done in the same way<br>
except that (a) an agonist dose-response curve is done in the presence of a constant<br>
concentration of antagonist, or (b) an antagonist dose-response curve is done in the<br>
presence of a constant concentration of agonist.<br>
Based on the above assays, the dissociation constant (Ki) for a particular<br>
compound of the invention towards a particular receptor is determined using the<br>
following equation:<br>
Ki = IC50/(l+[rad]/Kd),<br>
Wherein ICso is the concentration of the compound of the invention at which<br>
50% displacement has been observed;<br>
[rad] is a standard or reference radioactive ligand concentration at that<br>
moment; and<br>
Kd is the dissociation constant of the radioactive ligand towards the particular<br>
receptor.<br>
Using the above-mentioned assays, the Ki towards human CBi receptors for<br>
certain compounds of the invention are in the range of between 3 nM and 195 nM.<br>
ECso for these compounds are in the range of between 2.3 nM and 300 nM. Emax for<br>
these compounds are in the range of between 109 % and 144 %.<br>
Assay Condition for Measuring Solubility<br>
A 30 mM DMSO stock is prepared of the sample and then a 25 uL aliquot is<br>
added to a 96-well plate and genevac at 40 °C for 4 hours. To the genevac compound<br>
add 250 uL of sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and then mix at 1200 rpm for 24 h<br>
using an Eppendorf Thermomixer at 25°C. After mixing solution is transferred to a<br>
96-well Whatman GF/B filter plate and then filtered under vacuum. 'The supernatant<br>
is men injected onto the LC/MS for analysis and quantitation is performed using a 1-<br>
point calibration for the compound of interest.<br>
Metabolic Stability Assays in Rat and Human Liver Microsomes<br>
A solution of 500 ul of 100 uM compound in DMSO is incubated with human<br>
or rat liver microsomes (843ul of rnicrosomes of 0.5618 mg/mL in 30ml 0.1 M<br>
KH2PO4 buffer pH7.4) at 37°C for 10 min in a 96-deep well plate. NADPH (46 uL)<br>
at a concentration of 8.33 mg/ml in 100 mM KHaPCU buffer pH 7.4 is added to start<br>
the reaction. The reaction mixtures are transferred to a 384-well plate containing<br>
acetonitrile to quench the reaction at time 0,1Q, 20,30 minutes. The 384 well plate is<br>
centrifuged for 30 min at 9000g, at 4°C, from which samples are analyzed by LOMS<br>
(model: XDB Eclipse CIS). Three references are analyzed by LC/MS as a positive<br>
control. Data are processed following a standard procedure. The metabolic stability<br>
of assayed compounds is expressed as uL/min/mg<br>
