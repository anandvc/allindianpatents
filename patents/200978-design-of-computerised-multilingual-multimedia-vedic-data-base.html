				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The four Vedas, with their 1131 branches recorded on palm leaves earlier are reduced to 8 branches only, because of media problems. Some attempts made for their preservation were having serious limitations. Under these conditions, I carried out intensive research studies and conducted several experiments, over the past three decades. My new invention, &quot;DESIGN OF COMPUTERISED MULTILINGUAL MULTIMEDIA VEDIC DATABASE&quot; is a culmination of the above efforts. The President of India appreciated my invention as &quot;Unique of its kind in the world&quot;. The present invention relates to Computerising the Devanagari script of Vedas, recording the Vedic texts and chantings, providing the details like Rishi and Devata, and presenting the system at a glance with four boxes. The present application for patent is submitted with the claims on the sequence of software commands, display formats, graphics, integrated presentation, and programs developed to operate the above.</td>

The present invention relates to a "DESIGN OF COMPUTERISED<br>
MULTILINGUAL MULTIMEDIA VEDIC DATABASE", relating to :<br>
i)        computerising the Devanagari script of Vedas<br>
ii)        recording the Vedic texts and chantings<br>
iii)      providing the details like Rishi, Devata, etc.<br>
iv) indicating the modern science/subject to which the Vedic mantra appears to be related and<br>
v) preparing an integrated presentation of the system at a glance with the Vedic mantra with Swara symbols in one box, the meaning of related mantra in the selected language like Hindi/Telugu in second box, the meaning of related mantra in English in third box on the screen and the graphical presentation of the picture in fourth box on the screen.<br>
RESEARCH TOPIC:<br>
The Vedas are the oldest scriptures of the world and are a source of inspiration for the mankind from times immemorial. The Vedas, divided into Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda, were having 1131 branches earlier. The contents of the Vedas and chanting were passed on from generation to generation through oral tradition. Several commentaries and translations were written for the Vedic mantras in several languages. Several sciences were also developed based on the information contained in the Vedic mantras. Several books were written describing the application of Vedic mantras for the benefit of the mankind. Most of these Vedic texts were recorded on Palm leaves for several centuries. In course of time, lot of Vedic literature was lost due to discontinuance of oral tradition and decay and destruction of Palm leaves. As on today only 13 branches of Vedic literature are traced and the chanting of 8 branches is available. Thus the need is felt for effective methods of preservation and propagation of Vedic literature and chanting.<br>
Some institutions have attempted for printing of part of the Vedic literature, while some organisations have attempted for audio recording of the chanting independently and without any coordination. While the books are having the audio limitation, the audio cassettes are having the visual limitation. Both these methods are having the common limitation of not being able to display the meanings and commentaries in different languages simultaneously. Further it was not possible to identify the Rishi, Devata, Chandas, Alamkara, Kamya etc., simultaneously alongwith the text of the Vedic mantras. Further the information in Vedic mantras was explained through lengthy texts which could not be comprehended easily by most of the Vedic students. Also there were no adequate tools for promoting research in Vedic subjects. More than all, the Vedic books are scattered around the world in piece meal form and are not easily available to interested persons and are not fastly accessible because of the limitation of money, space and time. Thus the existing methods are having serious limitations in preserving the Vedic literature and chanting.<br><br>
INVENTION OF COMPUTERISED MULTILINGUAL MtfLTIMEDIA VEDIC DATABASE<br>
Under these conditions, I have invented a new technique for effectively preserving the Vedic literature and chanting through the "Design of Computerised Multilingual Multimedia Vedic Database".<br>
For this, I carried out intensive research studies and conducted several experiments over the past three decades. The research involved was for<br>
v)        computerising the Devanagiri Script of Vedas<br>
vi)       recording the Vedic texts and chantings<br>
vii)      providing the details like Rishi, Devata, etc.,<br>
viii)     indicating the modern science/subject to which the Vedic mantra<br>
appears to be related and ix)       providing visual display with an integrated database approach using<br>
sophisticated computer technology.<br>
The new technique invented, viz., the "Design of Computerised Multilingual MultimediaVedic Database" is a culmination of various research experiments and achievements.<br>
This technique was applied using the computer language "Visual Basic", "MS Access" Software package, working under Windows - 95 environment of Pentium Computers. The new software technique facilitated the display of the meanings in different languages like English, Hindi and Telugu in addition to the text in Sanskrit.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The new software technique invented is for "Design of computerised Multilingual Multimedia Vedic Database".<br>
A Comprehensive view of the new Vedic database software technique is presented in Fig.l and is explained in the following lines<br>
The new software commences its execution through "START" module. This module comprises three programs.<br>
a)Set-up Program b)About the Project c)Vedic Database Program The display of these programs is presented in Fig.2.<br>
The set-up program was designed to load different software modules related to various fonts of the languages like Sanskrit, Telugu, Hindi and English into the computer memory.<br><br>
The program "About the Project" gives an overall view of the total Project of preservation and propagation of Vedic knowledge using sophisticated computer technology.<br>
The "START" module displays the contents of the present CD ROM on the computer screen like the Veda, Branch, Ashtaka, Adhyaya and type of chanting as presented in Fig.3.<br>
The Vedic database program commences its operation by giving a facility for selection of language like Sanskrit, Telugu, Hindi and English for display of the meanings as shown in Fig. 4.<br>
The system will be waiting for a response from the user to open the database and will display a Main Menu with options like Auto, Select, Sequential and Exit as shown in Fig. 5.<br>
The Auto Mode gives a facility for selection of one of the following options as shown in Fig. 6<br>
Chanting &amp; Gallery, Chanting &amp; Mantra, Sukta Selection.<br>
The Select Mode is designed to help the users in selecting the Mantras by any one of the following indexing methods as shown in Fig.7.<br>
Identification  Number,   Chandas,  Devata,  Aalamkara,  Kamya,     Rishi, Subject.<br>
The Sequential Mode displays the list of Identification Codes of the Suktas for commencing their execution.<br>
The new software allows the user to select any type of chanting from the following list as shown in Fig.8<br>
Samhita, Pada, Krama, Jata, Mala, Sikha, Rekha, Dhwaja, Danda, Ratha and Ghana.<br>
The new software, under Select Mode, displays the contents in four boxes of the Screen. The first box contains the Vedic mantra with Swara symbols, the second box contains the meaning of the related mantra in the selected language like Hindi or Telugu. The third box contains the meaning of the Mantra in English and the fourth box contains the Graphic presentation of the Picture.<br>
In addition the system provides the following list of command buttons as shown in Fig. 9.<br>
Back, Play, Pause, Stop, Details, Back to list, Next and End.<br><br>
The command button, Details, when clicked, will display the following list of items as shown in Fig. 10.<br>
I.D.No. Veda Sakha, Rishi, Kamya, Devata, Chandas, Alamkara, Modern Subject, Author of Sanskrit commentary, Author of Telugu translation, Author of Hindi translation and Author of English translation.<br>
The new system provides Visual display of graphic representations and pictures related to the Vedic Mantras. The graphics incorporated in the system were exclusively developed for this purpose for the first time and were integrated with other modules.<br>
The new software has also been incorporated with commands to Zoom the contents of the four boxes to full screen level.<br><br><br><br><br>
