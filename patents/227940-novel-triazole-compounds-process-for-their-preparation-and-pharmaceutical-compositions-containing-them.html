Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel triazole compounds of formula (I),<br>
4 _<br>
and   their   pharmaceutically   acceptable   salts   thereof,   pharmaceutical   compositions containing them.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the above said novel compounds.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Since the discovery of penicillin, pharmaceutical companies have produced more than one hundred antibacterial agents to combat a wide variety of bacterial infections. In the past several years, there has been rapid emergence of bacterial resistance to several of these antibiotics. The multidrug resistance among these bacterial pathogens may also be due to mutation leading to more virulent clinical isolation, the most disturbing milestone has been the acquisition of resistance to vancomycin, an antibiotic generally regarded as the agent of last resort for serious Gram-positive infections. This growing multidrug resistance has recently rekindled interest in the search for new structural class of antibiotic that inhibit or kill these bacteria possibly by novel mechanisms.<br>
A problem of larger dimension is the increasing incidence of the more virulent, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) among clinical isolates found worldwide. As with vancomycin resistant organisms, many MRSA strains are resistant to most of the known antibiotics, but MRSA strains have remained sensitive to vancomycin. However, in view of the increasing reports of vancomycin resistant clinical isolates and growing problem of bacterial resistance, there is an urgent need for new molecular entities effective against the emerging and currently problematic Gram-positive organisms.<br>
Recently, several oxazolidinones have been discovered, which inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 50S-ribosomal subunit which is close to the site to which chloramphenicol and lincomycin bind but their mode of action is mechanistically distinct from these two antibiotics.<br>
Various 1,2,3-triazoles, 1,2,4-triazoles and benzotriazoles have been reported to show various biological activities and have therefore found applications in medicinal chemistry. The literature survey shows the use of 1,2,3-triazoles, for the treatment of neuropathic   pain  and  associated  hyperalgesia,   including  trigeminal   and   herpectic<br><br>
neuralgia, diabetic neuropathic pain, migraine, causalgia and deafferentation syndromes such as brachial plexus avulsion, an anticoccidiostat, as antiproliferative agents, for antimetastatic activity in a model of ovarian cancer progression, for anti-inflammatory effect, controlling activity against noxious organisms, for the treatment of ischemia, anti-human immunodeficiency virus activity etc. Recently one PCX publication no. WO03/059894 showed the use of 1,2,3-triazole derivates as antiinfective agents.<br>
The novel triazole compounds of the present invention is useful for the treatment of various infections including local infections and systemic infections, caused by number of human and veterinary pathogens like Gram-positve, Gram-negative, multi resistant bacteria as well as anaerobic organisms and other Myco bacterial species.<br>
Some of the available triazole references are given below:<br>
(a)	Chem. Pharm. Bull. 48(12), 1935-1946 (2000) discloses the triazoles of<br>
formula (ia) and (ib), which are reported as antifungal agents,<br>
(b)	US 6054471 discloses fluorinated triazoles of the formula (ii), which are reported for the treatment of neuropathic pain and associated hyperalgesia, including trigeminal and herpectic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathic pain, migraine, causalgia and deafferentation syndromes such as brachial plexus avulsion,<br>
(c)	J. Med. Chem., 2843, 1991 discloses compound of formula (iii), which is an anticoccidiostat and also been found to have antiproliferative activity in several disease models and to posses antimetastatic activity in a model of ovarian cancer progression,<br>
(d)	J. Heterocycl. Chem., 609, 1989 discloses compound of formula (iv), which is reported for anti-inflammatory effects,<br>
(e)	EPO publication no 0304221 A2 discloses compounds of formula (v), which are reported as antiproliferative reagents.<br>
(f)	PCX publication no. WO03/059894 (by Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd.) discloses 1,2,3-triazoles as antibacterial agents.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
With an objective to develop novel compounds effective against a number of human and veterinary pathogens sensitive as well as resistant to various antiinfectives, including Gram-positive, Gram-negative, aerobic and anerobic bacteria. The pathogens such as MRSA, Streptococci including Str pneumoniae, Str. pyogenes, Enterococci as well as anaerobic organisms such as Bacteroides spp., Clostridia spp. species and Acid-fast organisms    such    as    Mycobacterium    tuberculosis,    Mycobacterium    avium    and<br><br>
Mycobacterium spp. fastidious Gram negative organisms, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis and several other bacterial species resistant to fluoroquinolone, Macrolide, Vancomycin, Aminoglycosides, Streptogramin, Lincosamides and β-Lactam, we focussed our research to develop new compounds effective against the above mentioned organisms, as well as expanded spectra of activity to include community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Efforts in this direction have led to the preparation of compounds having general formula (I) as defined above.<br>
The present invention provides novel 1,2,3-triazole derivatives of the general formula (I) as defined above, and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, their pharmaceutical compositions containing them. An aspect of the present invention is to provide pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of the general formula (I), in combination with suitable carriers, solvents, diluents and other media normally employed in preparing such compositions.<br>

By either route, the dosage is in the range of about 0.1 mg/kg to about 100 mg / kg, morepreferably about 3.0 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg of body weight of the subject per day administered singly or as a divided dose. However, the optimum dosage whether for prevention or treatment for the individual subject being treated will be determined by the person responsible for treatment. Initial dosage may be smaller than the optimum and the daily dosage may be progressively increased during the course of treatment depending on the particular situation. If desired, the daily dose may also be divided into multiple doses for administering, e.g. 2-4 times per day. It is to be understood that the dosages may vary depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the bacterial infection being treated, and the particular compound being used. In a topical treatment an effective amount of compound of formula (I) is admixed in a pharmaceutically acceptable gel or cream vehicle that can be applied to the patient's skin at the area of treatment.

Minimum Inhibiton Concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution technique as per the guidelines prescribed in the fifth edition of Approved Standards, NCCLS document M7-A5 Vol 20 - No 2, 2000 Villinova, PA.<br>
Initial stock solution of the test compound was prepared in DMSO. Subsequent two fold dilutions were carried out in sterile Mueller Hinton Broth (Difco) (MHB).<br>
Frozen cultures stocks were inoculated into 50 ml sterile MHB in 250 ml Erlyn Meyer flasks.<br>
Composition of MHB is as follows: Beef Extract Powder - 2.0 g/litre Acid Digest of Casein - 17.5 g/ litre Soluble Starch - 1.5 g/litre Final pH 7.3 ±0.1<br>
Flasks were incubated for 4 to 5 h at 35 *"€ on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm. Inoculum was prepared by diluting the culture in sterile MHB to obtain a turbidity of 0.5 McFarland standard. This corresponds to 1-2 x 10^ CFU/ml. The stock was further diluted<br><br>
in sterile broth to obtain 1-2 X 10 CFU/ml. 50 µl of the above diluted inoculum was added from 1-10 wells. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C.<br>
MIC is read as the lowest concentration of the compound that completely inhibits growth of the organism in the microdilution wells as detected by the unaided eye.<br>
