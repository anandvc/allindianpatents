Background of the Invention<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a windshield wiper with complaint force distribution, for a windshield of a vehicle, the windshield wiper with a complaint force distribution being coupled to a windshield wiper arm that is coupled at a first end thereof to the vehicle and at a second end thereof to the windshield wiper for applying a force thereto with respect to the vehicle in a first direction that urges the windshield wiper towards the windshield and which moves the windshield wiper in a second direction across the windshield, the windshield wiper having a windshield wiper blade coupled thereto for contacting the windshield of the vehicle<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Conventional windshield wipers employ a plurality of metallic beams pivotally coupled to one another The respective beams, which generally are not resilient or spring-like, are coupled to a windshield wiper blade at their free ends, and the pivoting of the beams with respect to one another approximates compliant bending of the windshield wiper as it travels across the windshield wiper One goal to be achieved, however, is to provide a compliant support mechanism that, within predeterminable langes of displacement of the windshield wiper blade in the direction of the windshield, cause a force to be directed by the windshield wiper blade substantially uniformly along its length onto the surface of the windshield, of a magnitude sufficient to perform the desired windshield wiping function, and for a given windshield contour<br>
The conventional windshield wiper support arrangement, with its plurality of cantilevered beams, cannot achieve a truly compliant functionality, as it stores within itself little, if any, potential energy Instead, the arrangement of pivotally attached beams merely approximates a truly compliant mechanism Another problem with the known arrangements lies in the fact that the cantilevered beams have a limited range of displacement in the direction toward the windshield A beam cannot be displaced beyond the point where its other end will stop against a sequentially superior beam The limitation on the amplitude capacity, and hence on the simulated compliance effect, places limitations on vehicle designers, as conventional windshield wiper support systems cannot perform adequately when the windshield surface contour has a relatively small radius of curvature anywhere in the wiping path<br>
1A<br><br>
In addition to failing to achieve a compliant function, the known windshield wiper support is implemented at significant complexity and expense In most cases, the pivoted beams are made of a metal, that typically is highly reflective of light and subject to corrosion upon exposure to the elements In order to prevent the glare of the sun on the eyes of the operator of the vehicle, as well as to protect against corrosion, each such pivoted beam must have a non-reflective coating applied thereto This, of course, is per se a costly step that is rendered more expensive and critical when it is realized that the coating process must be executed with accuracy and precision lest the coating material effect adversely the inter-beam pivot couplings There are numerous problems that can arise when painted or otherwise coated surfaces move pivotally with respect to one another If the coating is installed prior to assembly of the product, the coating, at least partially as a result of its thickness, will increase the width of the beams, and decrease the size of the apertures through which the pivots are installed On the other hand, if the product is coated after assembly, the coating process is more complex to avoid leaving areas uncoated, and of course, the coating will tend to accumulate at the pivot joints and at the places where the beams communicate with one another An overly thick coating causes interference fits and abrasion of the coating, while a coating that is too thin will wear prematurely as a result of exposure to the elements Clearly, coatings will produce problems irrespective of the point in the manufacture of the product at which they are applied<br>
There is a need, therefore, for a windshield wiper support that overcomes the problems described hereinabove, and others<br>
It is, therefore, an object of this invention to provide a windshield wiper frame that is simple and inexpensive, and which does not require a complex multi-pivoted interconnection between a windshield wiper actuator arm and the windshield wiper blade<br>
It is another object of this invention to provide a windshield wiper frame having precisely controllable compliance characteristics in terms of both, force and deflection<br>
It is also an object of this invention to provide a windshield wiper frame that avoids the need for mechanical links and joints<br>
It is a further object of this invention to provide a windshield wiper frame that can simply and inexpensively be manufactured as an integral unit, and that does not require subsequent painting<br>
It is additionally an object of this invention to provide a windshield wiper frame that can be manufactured in a wide variety of aesthetically pleasing configurations, while retaining<br>
2<br><br>
high compliance and strength characteristics<br>
It is yet another object of this invention to provide a windshield wiper frame that has a compliance capacity that can easily and inexpensively be made to achieve a specific compliance characteristic for a windshield having a predetermined surface contour, or a group of windshields having a predetermined range of surface contours <br>

In an advantageous embodiment, the steps of forming a primary beam member, forming a first compliant beam member integrally with the primary beam member, and forming a second compliant beam member integrally with said fast compliant beam member are, in one embodiment, performed simultaneously during performance of a step of molding That is. the process can incorporate the various forming steps in a molding operation Alternatives to the molding step, also wherein the various portions of the apparatus are simultaneously formed. include extrusion, casting, stamping, or any other process of<br>
6<br><br>
manufacture that in light of the teaching herein, is deemed appropriate by persons of skill in the art<br>
Attention on the part of the designer should be directed to the choice of materials, particularly in regard of certain physical and mechanical properties These include, for example, flexural strength, toughness (i e. impact strength), percentage of elongation, density, weather resistance, resistance to the effects of ultraviolet light, water absorption, temperature at which heat distortion occurs, resistance to creep, density stability, and dimensional stability Flexural strength is a measure of the magnitude of a load that can be imposed before the material breaks The present windshield wiper application requires relatively low flexural strength The toughness characteristic relates to the magnitude of the energy required to break a plastic material, and is used to measure impact strength Impact strength is not a measure of the stress required to break a sample, but rather a measure of the energy needed, or absorbed, in breaking the specimen A relatively large value of impact strength is required in the present windshield wiper application<br>
The combined effects of temperature, light radiation, moisture gases, and other chemicals in the environment can cause dimensional and other physical changes in plastic materials The "weatherability" of a plastic material relates to its ability to withstand direct sunlight, or the application of artificial weathering conditions Ultraviolet radiation, in conjunction with water and other environmental oxidants, may cause color fading, pitting, crumbling, surface cracking, crazing, or brittleness Heat stabilizers, that are well-known to persons of skill in the plastics art. can be added to the polymers to retard the damaging effects of heat, light energy, oxidation, or mechanical shear "Deflection temperature," or "heat distortion temperature," represent the characteristically highest continuous operating temperature that the material will withstand In the present windshield wiper application, the<br>
material should be effective within a range of approximately -50°F to 150°F<br>
The compliant, force distributor of the present invention, in embodiments thereof that are applicable to windshield wiper systems, can be made of a variety of materials These include, for example, Xenoy (from GE Plastics), low density polyethylene, polypropylene, PVC, aromatic polyesters, polycarbonate, fluoroplastics, ABS, polyallomers, and polystyrene Some of the referenced materials are considered to be quite expensive, notwithstanding their excellent mechanical and physical properties For example, PTFE is about fifty times more expensive than polyethylene<br>
7<br><br>
From the standpoint of economy of manufacture, it is self-evident to persons of skill in the art that, for a given mold configuration, a lower density material will yield more parts per pound It is necessary, therefore, to compare costs on a unit volume basis The plastic materials (without limitation), arranged in order of increasing cost per unit volume, are polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, ABS (polypropylene with 30% glass fill) and PTFE Polyethylene, preferably of the low density type, or polypropylene, appear to be well-suited for the present windshield wiper application Both such materials are characterized with low specific gravity (polyethylene is approximately 0 917, and polypropylene is approximately 0 904), excellent molding qualities, very low cost, high impact strength, and low flexural modulus Although subject to degradation upon exposure to UV radiation, UV absorbers and other additives known to persons skilled in the art can reduce the effects of UV radiation and improve creep resistance<br>
Polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyethylene do not absorb water and therefore are good candidates for the windshield wiper application Nylons, polyesters, polycarbonates, and ABS absorb moisture and therefore are not recommended From the standpoint of cost and flexural strength, polypropylene is a better choice as it costs less than $0 50 per pound and has a flexural modulus of approximately between 100.000 and 150 000 psi Polyacetal (trade name "Delrm") and polyethylene terephthalates (PET) are also good choices<br>
From the standpoint of manufacture, injection molding appears preferred, although extrusion is a cost-effective alternative During molding, care should be taken that a knit line is not produced A knit line is on along which two fronts of polymer flow meet Knit lines produce a line of weakness that is susceptible to failure during impact<br>

Detailed Description<br>
Fig 1 is a schematic plan view of a windshield wiper support frame 10 wherein highly compliant integrally formed coupling portions 11-16 are utilized for interbeam coupling, as will be described hereinbelow A primary beam 20 is coupled to a secondary beam 21 via coupling portion 13 Similarly, the primary beam is coupled to a further secondary beam 22 via coupling portion 16 Coupling portion 11 couples secondary beam 21 to a tertiary beam 23 Similarly, on the other half of the windshield wiper support frame, coupling portion 14 couples secondary<br>
9<br><br>
beam 22 to a further tertiary beam 26 Coupling portions 12 and 15 are shown to couple their respectively associated secondary beams 21 and 22 to tertiary beams 24 and 25<br>
In this specific illustrative embodiment of the invention, output forces, which correspond to predeterminable proportions of an input force that is represented by vector -30. are provided at tertiary beams 23 -26, and at secondary beams 21 and 22 More specifically, the output forces, that are represented by vectors 31-36, sum up to the magnitude of vector 30 'Vectors 31-36 therefore represent a distribution of the input force represented by vector 30 The force represented by vector 30 is supplied in this embodiment by a windshield wiper actuator arm (not shown) that is conventionally coupled to the windshield wiper motor (not shown) of a vehicle (not shown) and to the windshield wiper support frame, illustratively at aperture 40 through primary beam 20 Although not specifically shown in this figure, the terminations of the secondary and tertiary beams where the output forces are provided are adapted (not shown in this figure) in a conventional manner to be coupled to a windshield wiper blade The windshield wiper blade may be of the conventional single blade type, or. of the dual blade type<br>
As indicated, the primary, secondary, and tertiary beams, along with their respectively associated compliant coupling portions, are formed integrally with one another The coupling portions, such as coupling portions 13 and 16. permit their respectively associated secondary beams to pivot Moreover, terminations of the secondary and tertiary beams where the output forces are produced are translatable along paths that are parallel to the input force vector Persons of skill in the art will readily recognize that the magnitudes of the forces represented by vectors 31-36 can be made not to be equal to one another, as required by the particular application Proportions of the force magnitudes amongst the vectors are responsive to the location of the coupling portions along the respective beams', the mechanical properties of the compliant coupling portions and the mechanical properties of the beams themselves Persons of skill in the art can configure these characteristics in light of the teaching herein<br>
Fig 2 is a schematic plan view of a windshield wiper support frame 50 wherein resilient, hinge-like portions 51 -56 are integrally formed with the beams, there being provided eight equally spaced force distribution points As shown, a primary beam 60 is resiliently coupled via integrally formed resilient coupling portions 52 and 55 to respective secondary beams 61 and 62 Each secondary beam is coupled via respective integrally formed resilient coupling portions 51 and 53, and 54 and 56, to respective tertiary beams 64-67 In this specific illustrative embodiment of the invention, the tertiary beams are coupled to a<br>
10<br><br>
windshield wiper blade, which is schematically represented in the figure by structural element<br>
69	The windshield wiper blade can. in certain embodiments, be coupled to the force output<br>
points of the tertiary beams using any of several known wiper blade coupling arrangements<br>
(not shown), or it can be formed integrally with the windshield wiper support frame<br>
Fig 3 is a schematic plan representation of the configuration of a small resilient, hinge-like portion 70, which corresponds to coupling portions 51, 53, 54, and 56, shown in Fig 2 Fig 4 is a schematic plan view of the configuration of a larger resilient, hinge-like portion 80. which corresponds to coupling portion 55 in Fig 2 Coupling portion 52 in Fig 2 is the mirror image of coupling portion 55 Referring once again to Fig 3, hinge-like portion<br>
70	is formed with first and second resilient members 71 and 72. that couple beams 74 and 75<br>
resiliently to one another. When beam 75 is urged in the direction of arrow 77, first resilient<br>
member 71 is subjected to a compression force, and second resilient member 72 is subjected<br>
to tension Conversely, when beam 75 is urged in the direction of arrow 78, first resilient<br>
member 71 is subjected to a tensile force, and second resilient member 72 is subjected to<br>
compression force In this regard, without limitation, the present invention is distinguishable<br>
from the mere pivoting function of the interbeam couplers of the conventional windshield<br>
wiper support frames<br>
The larger resilient, hinge-like portion 80 of Fig 4 that corresponds to coupling portion 55 in Fig 2. functions in a manner similar to the hinge-like portion described with respect to Fig 3 More specifically, when beam 85 is urged in the direction of arrow 87, first resilient member 81 is subjected to a compression force, and second resilient member 82 is subjected to tension Conversely, when beam 85 is urged in the direction of arrow 88, first resilient member 81 is subjected to a tensile force, and second resilient member 82 is subjected to compression force<br>
Fig 5 is a schematic plan view of a windshield wiper support frame 100 embodiment of the invention wherein resilient hinge-like portions are integrally formed with the beams, with eight equally spaced force distribution points, and with greater flexibility than the embodiment of Fig 2 As shown in this figure, windshield wiper support frame 100 is provided with resilient, hinge-like portions 101-106 are integrally formed with the beams A primary beam 110 is resiliently coupled via integrally formed resilient coupling portions 102 and 105 to respective secondary beams 111 and 112 Each secondary beam is coupled via respective integrally formed resilient coupling portions l0l and 103, and 104 and 106, to respective tertiary beams 114-117 The embodiment of Fig 5 achieves a greater degree of<br>
11<br><br>
compliance over that of Fig 2 in that the resilient coupling portions are not only longer, but thinner Thus, when materials having relatively high stiffness characteristics are employed in the manufacture of the product, desired compliance characteristics can be achieved by controlling the size and thickness of the resilient coupling portions In this specific illustrative embodiment of the invention, the force output portions (not specifically designated in this figure) are shown schematically to be coupled to a windshield wiper blade 120 As previously noted, the windshield wiper blade can, in certain embodiments, be coupled to the force output points using any of several known wiper blade couplings, or it can be formed integrally with the windshield wiper support frame<br>

12<br><br>
coupling elements 161 and 167 are smaller than resilient coupling elements 162 and 166, etc , resilient element 164 being the largest in this embodiment<br>

14<br><br>
such as injection molding A practicable embodiment has been formed of Xenoy, a compound that is commercially available from GE Plastics<br>
Fig 11 is an enlarged fragmented schematic isometric representation of a portion of a specific embodiment of the invention showing certain details of the end pads with the blade coupling elements extending therefrom and a single-beam resilient element Elements of structure that are analogous to those discussed hereinabove with respect to Fig 10 are similarly designated Fig 11 shows, as does Fig 10. certain illustrative details of end pad 190 with blade coupling elements 200 and 201 extending therefrom As shown in Fig 11, end pad 190, as are the other end pads (not shown) in this embodiment is wider than the coupling elements, illustratively coupling element 208 which couples end pad 190 to first end 205 of primary beam 181 As previously discussed, the blade coupling elements are shown in this specific illustrative embodiment of the invention to be axially spaced apart from one another on the end pad and are provided with respective inwardly directed protuberances 210 and 211 which engage with an elongated support (not shown) of a conventional windshield wiper blade (not shown)<br>

A resilient element 241 is shown in the embodiment of Fig 11 to have a substantially S-shaped configuration, wherein a first end thereof is coupled to primary beam 181, and a second end is coupled to end pad 190 The structure of the resilient element of this specific illustrative embodiment of the invention is comprised of two resilient bends 243 and 244 which are resiliently interconnected by a resilient beam 246 As end pad 190 is displaced toward primary beam 181 by the application of a force in the direction of arrow 220. resilient beam 246 is caused to bend resiliently In this embodiment, the entire structure is integrally formed, as previously noted<br>
In addition, persons of skill in the art can configure multiple-tier resilient beam arrangements, similar in appearance to the embodiment shown in Fig 2, but instead of relying on the integrally formed resilient coupling portions (eg, 51 and 53) to provide the necessary compliance to the relatively firm subordinate beams (e g . 61 and 64). resilient beams of the type described in connection with Figs 9-11 can be tiered (not shown), whereby, as previously stated, the overall compliance characteristic of the windshield wiper blade support<br>
15<br><br>
is responsive to the resilience characteristics of the beams themselves In still further embodiment, the resilient coupling elements, such as coupling element 208 which couples end pad 190 to first end 205 of primary beam 181 in Figs 9-11, can themselves be configured to distribute force to the windshield wiper blade (not shown), in regions intermediate of the end pads In such embodiments, the resilient connectors between the end pads, or between an end pad and an end of the primary beam, has a preformed curvature that applies a resilient force to the windshield wiper blade<br>
