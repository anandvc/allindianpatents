POLYSACHHARIDES CONTAINING BENEFIT AGENT AND<br>
LAUNDRY TREATMENT COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING<br>
THE SAME.<br>
HINDUSTAN   LEVER   LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at  Hindustan   Lever  House,     165/166,   Backbay  Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to polysaccharides of the kind comprising a benefit agent and to compositions containing the same.  It also relates to a deposition aid for deposition of a further benefit agent onto a substrate. These compositions are suitable, for example, for use as laundry treatment compositions or as components  thereof. The invention further relates to a method of depositing a benefit agent from solution or dispersion, onto a substrate by means of such a composition.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The deposition of a benefit agent onto a substrate, such as a fabric, is well known in the laundry art.  In laundry applications typical "benefit agents" include fabric softeners and conditioners, soil release polymers, sunscreens and the like.  Deposition of a benefit agent is used, for example, in fabric treatment processes such as fabric softening to impart desirable properties to the fabric substrate.<br>
Conventionally, the deposition of the benefit agent has had to rely upon the attractive forces between an oppositely charged substrate and a benefit agent.  Typically, this requires the addition of benefit agents during the rinsing step of a for example a washing process so as to avoid adverse effects from other charged chemical species present<br><br>
in the treatment compositions.  By way of illustration, cationic fabric conditioners are incompatible with anionic surfactants such as are used in laundry washing compositions.<br>
Such "adverse charge" considerations can place severe limitations upon the inclusion of benefit agents in compositions where an active component thereof is of an  opposite charge to that of the benefit agent.  For example, cotton is negatively charged and thus requires a positively charged benefit agent in order for the benefit agent to be substantive to the cotton, i.e. to have an affinity for the cotton so as to absorb onto it.<br>
Often the substantivity of the benefit agent is reduced and/or the deposition rate of the material is reduced because of the presence of, incompatible charged species in the compositions.  However, in recent times, it has been proposed to deliver a benefit agent in a form whereby it is substituted onto another chemical moiety which increases the benefits agents affinity for the substrate in question.<br>
Prior Art<br>
It is known that cellulose is difficult to disperse in water.  This is not due to the inherent insolubility of the material but rather due to the extremely good hydrogen bonding which cellulose exhibits against itself.  Blocking some of hydrogen bonding sites, such as with ester or ether groups improves the solubility of cellulose.<br><br>
WO 98/29528 discloses cellulose ethers in which some substituents are (poly)alkoxylated, analogues of the latter in which the (poly)alkoxylated groups are terminated with a cationic moiety in the form of a quaternary ammonium group, and cellulose ethers in which some substituents are carboxylic acids in the salt form the charged species assist in the interaction of the cellulose with the substrate.<br>
WO 00/18861 provides a water-soluble or water-dispersible polysaccharide which comprises: a deposition enhancing part (the polymeric backbone - which in the case of cellulose shows self-recognition properties) and a benefit agent group attached to the deposition enhancing part by a hydrolytically stable bond.  During a treatment process the material undergoes a chemical change which does not involve the hydrolytically stable bond but by which the affinity of the material onto the substrate is increased.  A preferred material is cellulose mono acetate (CMA).  This molecule has an affinity for cotton due to the self-recognition properties of cellulose and is soluble due to the presence of the acetate groups.  The acetate groups hydrolyse in aqueous solution causing the deposited cellulose to remain on a cellulosic substrate.  Manufacture of CMA involves excessive esterification of the -OH groups of the cellulose and then hydrolysis of some of the esters to attain the desired degree of esterification.<br>
WO 03/020770 discloses a substituted β1-4 linked<br>
polysaccharide such as cellulose mono-acetate with one or more independently selected silicone chains covalently attached to it as the benefit agent.<br><br>
While the-molecules of WO 03/020770 are relatively expensive, it has been found that the covalently-linked silicone chains may be used to emulsify droplets of a further portion of silicone to enhance the deposition of that" material.<br>
Our UK patent application no WO 03/020819 discloses a laundry treatment composition comprising, a composition similar to that of WO 03/020770 in combination with a non-covalently bonded silicone which is, for example, emulsified in the same composition.  This enables relatively large quantities of silicone to be deposited without an excessive" on-cost for the formulator.<br>
Despite the above-mentioned advances, the need remains to further improve upon deposition systems based on cellulose-recognition.  It is advantageous to reduce cost, improve stability and/or increase efficacy, improve the sustainability or biodegradability of the material.<br>
Definition of the Invention<br>
We have now determined that certain natural polysaccharides can be used as a surprisingly effective alternative to synthetic cellulose mono acetate in the deposition of benefit agents, particularly textile softening agents.<br>
Accordingly, a first aspect of the present invention provides a water-soluble or dispersible, non-hydrolysable polysaccharide (NHP), having at least one first polymeric<br><br>
textile benefit species bonded thereto by a hydrolytically stable bond.<br>
Preferably, the first polymeric textile benefit species is a first polymeric textile softening species (FPSS).  While the invention is described below with particular reference to textile softening as the benefit obtained, other and broader aspects of the invention are not hereby excluded.<br>
By water-soluble, as used herein, what is meant is that the material forms an isotropic solution on addition to water or another aqueous solution.<br>
By water-dispersible, as used herein, what is meant is that the material forms a finely divided suspension on addition to water or another aqueous solution.<br>
By non-hydrolysable polysaccharide is meant that the polysaccharide does not contain a deposition enhancing group which undergoes a chemical change under conditions (including temperature) of use to increase the affinity of the polysaccharide to a substrate.  In those" embodiments of the invention intended for aqueous treatment of substrates, such as, in a wash liquor, these conditions can include, elevated pH and/or temperatures above ambient.<br>
By an increase in the affinity of the substituted polysaccharide for a substrate such as a textile fabric upon a chemical change, what is meant is that at some time during the treatment process, the amount of material that has been deposited is greater when the chemical change is occurring<br><br>
or has occurred, compared to when the chemical change has not occurred and is not occurring, or is occurring more slowly, the comparison being made with all conditions being equal except for that change in the conditions which is necessary to affect the rate of chemical change.<br>
The FPSS is attached to the non-hydrolysable polysaccharide by a stable bond.  That means that the bonding of the FPSS should be sufficiently stable so as not to undergo hydrolysis during processing or on storage prior to use or in the environment of the treatment process for the duration of that process.  For example, in laundry cleaning applications, the FPSS-polysaccharide conjugate should be sufficiently stable so that the bond between the FPSS and polysaccharide does not undergo hydrolysis in the wash liquor, at the wash temperature, before the silicone has been deposited onto the fabric.<br>
Preferably, the bond between the FPSS and the polysaccharide<br>
is such that the decay rate constant (kd) of the material in<br>
an aqueous solution at 0.01 wt% of the material together with 0.1 wt% of anionic surfactant at a temperature of 40°C at a pH of 10.5 is such that<br>
kd
The hydrolyti-c stability of the molecule is advantageous in that it may be stored for extended periods without the requirement that it is protected from atmospheric or other ambient moisture.  This is a distinct advantage over the<br><br>
prior art, wherein the deposition enhancing groups are inherently unstable.<br>
Deposition onto a substrate includes deposition by adsorption, co-crystallisation, entrapment and/or adhesion.<br>
Preferably, the NHP has a backbone comprising β 1-4 linkages.<br>
More preferably it is a poly-glucan, poly-mannan, or gluco-mannan and most preferably a galacto-mannan or xylo-glucan. Preferred polysaccharides are Locust Bean Gum, Tamarind xyloglucan, and guar gum. The most highly preferred polysaccharides are Locust Bean Gum and Tamarind xyloglucan. Mixtures of these polysaccharides may also be utilised.<br>
Naturally occurring polysaccharides are preferred.  These have the particular advantages, amongst others, that the esterification/de-esterification reaction used to prepare CMA is avoided, costs are generally lower and the materials have a high environmental compatibility.<br>
The first polymeric textile softening species (FPSS) is preferably a silicone and more preferably an amino silicone.<br>
While the	invention will be described below with particular<br>
reference	to the use of silicones as the softening species,<br>
other and	broader aspects of the invention are not thereby<br>
excluded.<br>
While a benefit can be obtained with the above-mentioned FPSS-NHP molecule per se, it is preferable that the molecule<br><br>
is used to aid the deposition of a further softening benefit<br><br>
agent.<br>
Advantageously, the present invention further provides a composition comprising the composition of the first aspect of the invention (FPSS-NHP) in combination with a second textile benefit species which is not covalently bonded thereto.<br>
 Preferably the second textile benefit species is a second polymeric textile softening species (SPSS).<br>
Preferably the SPSS is also a silicone, more preferably an amino-silicone, independently selected from the FPSS. Advantageously the SPSS is a hindered amine silicone.  The preferred dynamic viscosity of the SPSS is &gt; 2,500 mPas (at a shear rate of around 100 reciprocal seconds and a temperature of 20°C).<br>
Preferably, the ratio of the NHP-FPSS. conjugate to the SPSS is in the range 1:200 to 1:5 parts by weight.  Most preferably around 1:20 to 1:10 parts by weight.  For the sake of clarity, the NHP-FPSS conjugate is the NHP with the FPSS bonded thereto.<br>
The invention further provides emulsions comprising NHP with FPSS bonded thereto (i.e. NHP-FPSS), and optionally SPSS, as a dispersed phase. Ideally, these emulsions may be dried or otherwise encapsulated, to provide a dispersible form of the compositions of the invention. The dispersible form can comprise an adjunct, preferably a granulate, suitable for inclusion in a laundry composition.<br><br>
Fully formulated, compositions according to the present invention preferably contain a surfactant (which may be nonionic, anionic, cationic, or a mixture of some or all thereof).  Preferably the surfactant is a detersive surfactant, more preferably an anionic or nonionic surfactant or a mixture thereof.<br>
Typically, the level of NHP-FPSS or NHP-FPSS plus SPSS in a fully formulated composition will be 0.001-25%wt on product.<br>
Advantageously, the emulsion and/or granulate and/or fully formulated composition comprises a perfume.  Inclusion of the perfume in the emulsion can be used to modify the viscosity of the emulsion components, making the emulsion easier to process.  Moreover, delivery of the perfume may be enhanced by this mode of incorporation.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention provides a method for depositing a silicone onto a substrate, the method comprising, contacting in an aqueous medium, the substrate and a composition according to the invention.<br>
A yet further aspect of the invention provides the use of a composition according to the invention to enhance the softening benefit of a laundry treatment composition on a substrate<br>

The. Polysaccharide Part "<br>
The hydrolytically-stable polysaccharide is preferably a β-1,4-linked polysaccharide having an affinity for cellulose.<br>
The polysaccharide may be straight or branched.  Many naturally occurring polysaccharides have at least some degree of branching, or at any rate at least some saccharide rings are in the form of pendant side groups on a main polysaccharide backbone..<br>
A polysaccharide comprises a plurality of saccharide rings which have pendant hydroxyl groups.  In the preferred polysaccharides of the present invention,.at least some of these hydroxyl groups are independently substituted by, or replaced with, one or more other substituents, at least one being a silicone chain as FPSS.  The "average degree of substitution" for a given class of substituent means the average number of substituents of that class per saccharide ring for the totality of polysaccharide molecules in the sample and is determined for all saccharide rings.<br>
The polysaccharide is not cellulose or a hydrolytically-stable modified cellulose as,.while cellulose displays excellent self recognition, it is of poor solubility.<br>
Silicone Chain(s) as FPSS<br>
As used herein the term "silicone chain" means a polysiloxane or derivative thereof.<br><br>
In this specification the "n" subscript used in the general formulae of the substituted polysaccharide is a generic reference to a polymer.  Although "n" can also mean the actual (average) number of repeat units present in the polysaccharide, it is more meaningful to refer to "n" by the number average molecular weight.<br>
The number average molecular weight . (Mn). of the substituted<br>
polysaccharide part may typically be in the range of 1,000 to 200,000, for example 2,000 to 100,000, e.g. as measured using GPC with multiple-angle, laser-scattering detection.<br>
Preferably, the average degree of substitution for the silicone chains on- the polysaccharide backbone is from 0.00001 to 0.5, preferably from 0.001 to 0.5, more preferably from 0.001 to 0.1.  A further preferred range is from 0.01 to 0.05.<br>
Preferred silicone chains suitable for this use are those of formula:<br><br><br><br>
wherein L is absent or is a linking group and one or two of<br>
substituents G1 -G3 is a methyl group, the remainder being<br>
selected from groups of formula<br><br><br><br>
the -Si(CH3)2O- groups and the -Si(CH3 0) (G4 )- groups being arranged in random or block fashion, but preferably random.<br>
wherein n is from 5 to 1000, preferably from 10 to 200 and m is from 0 to 100, preferably from 0 to 20, for example from 1 to 20.<br>
G4 is selected from groups of formula:<br>
-(CH2)p-CH3, where p is from 1 to 18<br>
-(CH2) q-NH—(CH2) r,—NH2 where q and r are independently from 1<br>
to 3<br>
-(CH2)S-NH2, where s is from 1 to 3<br><br><br>
where t is from 1 to 3<br><br>
-(CH2)u~COOH, where u is from 1 to 10,<br><br>
where v is from 1 to 10, and.<br>
-(CH2 CH2O)W-(CH2)X H, where w is from 1 to 150, preferably from 10 to 20 and x is from 0 to 10;<br>
and G5 is independently selected from hydrogen, groups<br>
defined above for G4 , -OH, -CH3 and -C(CH3)3-<br>
L may be selected from amide linkages, ester linkages, ether linkages, urethane linkages, triazine linkages, carbonate linkages, amine linkages and ester-alkylene linkages.<br>
Other Substituents<br>
As well as the FPSS, pendant groups of other types may optionally be present, i.e. groups which do not confer a softening benefit and which do not undergo a chemical change to enhance substrate affinity.  Within that class of other groups is the sub-class of groups for enhancing the solubility of the material (e.g. groups which are, or<br><br>
contain one or more free carbo.xylic acid/salt and/or sulphonic acid/salt and/or"sulphate groups).<br>
Examples of solubility enhancing substituents include carboxyl, sulphonyl, hydroxyl, (poly)ethyleneoxy- and/or (poly)propyleneoxy-containing groups, as well as amine groups.<br>
The other pendant groups preferably comprise from 0% to 65%, more preferably from 0% to 10% of the total number of pendant groups.  The water-solubilising groups could comprise from 0% to 100% of those other groups but preferably from 0% to 20%, more preferably from 0% to 10%, still more preferably from 0% to 5% of the total number.of other pendant groups.<br>
It is preferable that the polysaccharide has no pendant groups other that those which are naturally present.  Unlike cellulose mono-acetate, the polysaccharide is free of hydrolytically releasable esterified pendant groups (i.e. the acetate groups in CMA).<br>
The preferred polysaccharides (locust bean gum, for example) have pendant galactose or other sugar residues which make them effectively more water dispersible/soluble than unmodified cellulose, but which are not hydrolysed from the backbone under conditions of use.<br><br>
Synthetic Routes<br>
Silicone chains as FPSS are preferably attached via a linking group "-L-".  This linking group is the residue of the reactants used to form the FPSS-polysaccharide conjugate.<br>
For silicone chains as FPSS, one or more hydroxyl groups on the polysaccharide are reacted with a reactive group attached to the silicone chain, or the hydroxyl group(s) in question is/are converted to another group capable of reaction with a reactive group attached to the silicone chain.<br>
Listed below, are suitable mutually reactive groups.  In the case of hydroxyl groups, these may be the original hydroxyl group of the polysaccharide.  However, either of a pair of these mutually reactive groups may be present on the polysaccharide and the other attached to the silicone chain, or vice versa,   the reaction chemistry being chosen appropriately.  In the following description, for convenience, "PSC" refers to the polysaccharide chain with or without deposition enhancing group(s) and/or other substituent (s) already attached.

Preferred inorganic persalts are sodium perborate monohydrate and tetrahydrate, and sodium percarbonate.<br><br>
Especially preferred is sodium percarbonate having a protective coating against destabilisation by moisture. Sodium percarbonate having a protective coating comprising sodium metaborate and sodium silicate is disclosed in GB 2 123 044B (Kao).<br>
The peroxy bleach compound is suitably present in an amount of from 0.1 to 35 wt%, preferably from 0.5 to 25 wt%.  The peroxy bleach compound may be used in conjunction with a bleach activator (bleach precursor) to improve bleaching action at low wash temperatures.  The bleach precursor is suitably present in an amount of from 0.1 to 8 wt%, preferably from 0.5 to 5 wt%.<br>
Preferred bleach precursors are peroxycarboxylic acid<br>
precursors, more especially peracetic acid precursors and<br>
pernoanoic acid precursors!.  Especially preferred bleach<br>
precursors suitable for use in the present, invention are<br>
N,N,N",N",-tetracetyl ethylenediamine (TAED) and sodium<br>
nonanoyloxybenzene sulphonate (SNOBS).  The novel quaternary<br>
ammonium and phosphonium bleach precursors disclosed in<br>
DS 4 751 015 and US 4 818 426 (Lever Brothers Company) and<br>
EP 402 971A (Unilever), and the cationic bleach precursors<br>
disclosed in EP 284 292A and EP 303 520A (Kao) are also of<br>
interest.	<br>
The bleach system can be either supplemented with or replaced<br>
by a peroxyacid. Examples of such peracids can be found in<br>
US 4 686 063 and US 5 397 501 (Unilever).  A preferred<br>
example is the imido peroxycarboxylic class of peracids<br>
described in EP A 325 288, EP A 349 940, DE 382 3172 and<br><br>
EP 325 289. A particularly preferred example is phthalimido peroxy caproic acid (PAP).  Such peracids are suitably present at 0.1 - 12%, preferably 0.5 - 10%.<br>
A bleach stabiliser (transition metal sequestrant) may also be present.  Suitable bleach stabilisers include ethylenediamine tetra-acetate (EDTA), the polyphosphonates such as Dequest (Trade Mark) and non-phosphate stabilisers such as EDDS (ethylene diamine di-succinic acid).  These bleach stabilisers are also useful for stain removal .especially in products containing low levels of bleaching species or no bleaching species.<br>
An especially preferred bleach system comprises a peroxy bleach compound (preferably sodium percarbonate optionally together with a bleach activator), and a transition metal bleach catalyst as described and claimed in EP 458 397A", EP 458 398A and EP 509 787A (Unilever).<br>
Bleach systems may comprise transition metal catalyst systems such as those disclosed in WO9965905; WO0012667; WO0012808; WO0029537, and, WO0060045.  These catalyst systems have the advantage that they require no added peroxyl compounds and can work, directly or indirectly, using atmospheric oxygen.<br>
The compositions according to the invention may also contain one or more enzyme (s).  Suitable enzymes include the proteases, amylases, cellulases, oxidases, peroxidases and lipases usable for incorporation in detergent compositions.<br><br>
Preferred proteolytic enzymes (proteases) are, catalytically active protein materials which degrade or alter protein types of stains when present as in fabric stains in a hydrolysis reaction.  They may be of any suitable origin, such as vegetable, animal, bacterial or yeast origin.<br>
Proteolytic enzymes or proteases of various qualities and origins and having activity in various pH ranges of from 4-12 are available and can be used in the instant invention. Examples of suitable proteolytic enzymes are the subtilisins which are obtained from particular strains of B. Subtilis B. licheniformis, such as the commercially available subtilisins Maxatase (Trade Mark), as supplied by Genencor International N.V., Delft, Holland, and Alcalase (Trade Mark), as supplied by Novozymes Industri A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark.<br>
Particularly suitable is a protease obtained from a strain of Bacillus having maximum activity throughout the pH range of 8-12, being commercially available, e.g. from Novozymes Industri A/S under the registered trade-names Esperase (Trade Mark) and Savina-se (Trade-Mark) .  The preparation of these and analogous enzymes is described in GB 1 243 785. Other commercial proteases are Kazusase (Trade Mark obtainable from Showa-Denko of Japan), Optimase (Trade Mark from Miles Kali-Chemie, Hannover, West Germany), and Superase (Trade Mark obtainable from Pfizer of D.S.A.).<br>
Detergency enzymes are commonly employed in granular form in amounts of from about 0.1 to about 3.0 wt%.  However, any suitable physical form of enzyme may be used.<br><br>
"The combination of non-cellulose polysaccharides and cellulase enzymes is particularly useful, as these enzymes exhibit reduced activity against this class of polysaccharides, as compared to their activity against cellulose.  Cellulase is known to be useful and is used in laundry products for de-fuzzing and colour brightening.<br>
The compositions of the invention may contain alkali metal (preferably sodium)" carbonate, in order to increase detergency and ease processing.  Sodium carbonate may suitably be present in amounts ranging from 1 to 60 wt%, preferably from 2 to 40 wt%.  However, compositions containing little or no sodium carbonate are also within the scope of the invention.<br>
Powder flow may be improved by the incorporation of a small amount of a powder structurant, for example, a fatty acid (or fatty, acid soap), a sugar, an acrylate or acrylate/maleate copolymer, or sodium silicate. . One preferred powder structurant is fatty acid soap, suitably present in an amount of from 1 to 5 wt%.<br>
Other materials that may be present in detergent compositions of the invention include sodium silicate; anti-redeposition agents such as cellulosic polymers; soil release polymers; inorganic salts such as sodium sulphate; or lather boosters as appropriate; dyes; coloured speckles; fluorescers and de¬coupling polymers.  This list is not intended to be exhaustive. However, many of these ingredients will be better delivered as benefit agent groups in materials according to the first aspect of the invention.<br><br><br>
The detergent composition when diluted in the wash liquor (during a typical wash cycle) will typically give a pH of the wash liquor from 7 to 10.5 for a main wash detergent.<br>
Particulate detergent compositions are suitably prepared by spray-drying a slurry of compatible heat-insensitive ingredients, and then spraying on or post-dosing those ingredients unsuitable for processing via the slurry.  The skilled detergent formulator will have no difficulty in deciding which ingredients should be included in the "slurry and which should not.<br>
Particulate detergent compositions of the invention preferably have a bulk density of at least 400 g/1, more preferably at least 500 g/1.  Especially preferred compositions have bulk densities of at least 650 g/litre, more preferably at least 700 g/litre.<br>
Such powders may be prepared either by post-tower densification of spray-dried powder, or by wholly non-tower methods such as dry mixing and granulation; in both cases a high-speed mixer/granulator may.advantageously be used. Processes using high-speed mixer/granulators are disclosed, for example, in EP 340 013A, EP 367 339A, EP 390 251A and EP 420 317A (Unilever).<br>
Liquid detergent compositions can be prepared by admixing the essential and optional ingredients thereof in any desired order to provide compositions containing components in the requisite concentrations.  Liquid compositions according to the present invention can also be in compact<br><br>
form which means it will contain a lower level of water compared to a conventional liquid detergent.<br>
Product Forms<br>
Product forms include.powders, liquids, gels, tablets, any of which are optionally incorporated in a water-soluble or water dispersible sachet.  The means for manufacturing any of the product forms are well known in the art. If the SPSS and the FPSS-polysaccharide conjugate are to be incorporated in a powder (optionally the powder to be tableted), and whether or not pre-emulsifiedr they are optionally included in a separate granular component, e.g.. also containing a water soluble organic or inorganic material, or in encapsulated form.<br>
Substrate<br>
The substrate may be any substrate onto which it is desirable to deposit FP.SS and which is subjected to treatment such as a washing or rinsing process.<br>
In particular, the substrate may be a textile fabric.  It has been found that particular good results are achieved when using a natural fabric substrate such as cotton, or fabric blends containing cotton.<br><br>
Treatment<br>
The treatment of the substrate with the material of the invention can be made by any suitable method such as washing, soaking or rinsing of the substrate.<br>
Typically the treatment will involve a washing or rinsing method such as treatment in the main wash or-rinse cycle of   a washing machine and involves contacting the substrate with an aqueous medium comprising the material of the invention.<br>
Examples<br>
The present invention will now be explained in more detail by reference to the following non-limiting examples.<br>
In the following examples where percentages are mentioned, this is to be understood as percentage by weight.  In the following tables where the values do not add up to 100 these are to be understood as parts by weight.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of Locust Bean Gum Poly Dimethyl Siloxane Conjugate:<br>
Lithium chloride (27 g) was dissolved in anhydrous dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide (300  cm ) with heating (150 C) and stirring under<br>
nitrogen.  Once the lithium chloride was dissolved the<br>
solution was cooled to 120 C before slowly adding locust<br>
bean gum (3.5 g) over a period of 20  minutes with vigorous stirring.<br><br>
The viscous solution thus obtained was then further cooled<br>
to 70 C and carbonyl diimidazole (54 mg, 0.5 mmols) was<br>
added and stirring and heating was continued for a further two hours.  Diaminopropyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane, 3,000 MWt, (1 g, 0.33 mmols) was then added and the solution stirred with heating for 18 hours.<br>
The solution was cooled to room temperature before adding drop-wise to vigorously stirring acetone (3 litres) to precipitate the.polymer.  The solution was centrifuged to isolate the product which was then washed with acetone (2 x<br>
200 cm ) .before drying under vacuum (40 C) overnight to<br>
give an off-white solid (3.1 g).<br>
From the IH NMR of the hydrolysed product (heated to 1 hour at 70 °C in 20% DCI/D2O) the degree of substitution of PDMS groups to sugar units was found to be 5.3 x 10~4.<br>

The wash liquors were placed in separate pots of a Rotawash™ Colour Fastness Tester (ex SDL, UK and as described in ISO 105) that had been preheated to 40°C.  To each pot was added a piece of white 100% cotton sheeting (ex Phoenix Calico, UK) weighing 18 g along with 25 stainless steel balls.  The pots were sealed and then washed for 45 minutes with end over end agitation at<br><br>
40 rpm.  At the end of the wash period, the liquor was decanted from each of the pots, which were then refilled with 250 cm of water, resealed, replaced in the Rotawash and washed for a further ten minutes.  The rinse step was repeated one more time after which, the rinse liquor was decanted from the pots, the cloths gently squeezed by hand to remove excess water and the fabrics dried flat overnight under ambient conditions.<br>
The quantity of aminosilicone deposited onto the fabrics during the wash was then determined as follows.  Each fabric piece was cut into three and the individual pieces weighed. Each fabric piece was added to a bottle containing 50 cm3 of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and the deposited silicone extracted with the aid of ultrasonication for five minutes.  The amount of aminosilicone extracted was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using a PLgel HTS-F column with THF eluent and an evapourative light scattering detector ELS 1000 light scattering detector.  The area under the elution peak for the aminosilicone was calculated by integration of the trace and this area was used to calculate the concentration of aminosilicone in the THF solution from the extraction by comparison to a calibration curve produced using aminosilicone in THF standards.  The results from the three portions of cloth were used to calculate an average value for the amount of aminosilicone deposited on the fabric expressed as milligrams of aminosilicone deposited per gram of fabric. These results are tabulated below in Table 3.<br><br>

"Bohlin CV 120 High Resolution" viscometer at 20°C and a<br>
shear rate of 100 s-1 using the cone and plate method.<br>
Polymer A and Synperonic A7 were weighed into a bottle along with the required amount of water.  This mixture was agitated using an ultrasonic probe (Soniprobe™) at half<br><br>
power until no undissolved Polymer A is visible (3 x 1 minute periods) The Rhodorsil huile ExtrasoftTM was then added to the bottle.  The mixture was sheared using a Silverson™ L4R high shear mixer fitted with a 25 mm diameter shearing head and a square-hole, high shear screen.  The mixer was set at full speed (approximately 6000 rpm) for five minutes at room temperature.<br>
, Example 5 - Treatment of Fabrics in Washing Machine<br>
Representative washloads as detailed in Table 5 were placed in each of two Computer controlled Miele Front loading automatic washing machines.<br>

100% cotton sheeting	404<br>
65:35 polyester/cotton sheeting	534<br>
100% knitted polyester	589<br>
To the dosing drawer of each machine was added 87 g of the detergent powder formulation given in Table 6.  The emulsion samples were introduced into the machines via a spherical plastic dosing ball.  25 g of Example 4 and 50 g of Control 4A were placed in separate dosing balls and these were placed on top of the washloads in the washing machine.  The machines were set running with identical conditions of: standard cotton cycle; 40oG wash temperature; 15 litre<br><br><br>
intake-of normal tap water of about 15"French Hardness.  At the end of the wash cycle, the fabrics were line dried indoors under ambient conditions. When dry, four samples of fabric were cut randomly from each of the fabric types included in the wash and were analysed for deposited silicone using the extraction and GPC method described in Example 3.-  The results of this extraction were used to calculate the amount of aminosilicone deposited onto the fabric as milligrams of aminosilicone per gram of fabric. Knowing the overall composition of the wash load, the total amount of silicone deposited onto fabric was calculated. This was then expressed as the percentage of the aminosilicone added to the wash liquor that ended up deposited on the washload.  These results are given. in Table 7.  It is clear that even though less aminosilicone was added to the wash liquor in Example 4 compared to Control 4A, Example 4 resulted in almost twice as much aminosilicone being deposited onto the fabric - this represents a fourfold increase in the deposi"tion efficiency.<br><br>
