				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention ^MEDICAL GAS TERMINAL UNIT', relates to the Medical Gas Outlet, which the medical staff i.e., the Doctors and Nurses use for daily medical care. With safety aspects in view, it is desired that cross-connection of the different medical gas lines, which run adjacent to each other is not allowed at any cost.<br>
The inventor of 'MEDICAL GAS TERMINAL UNIT' has developed a pin guide system to prevent a cross connection mechanically and furthermore has adopted a colour code to identify the different gases, for visual identification. Accordingly, a different colour code has been designated to the exclusive kind of gas, resulting in aremarkablc effect. In order to prevent a cross connection when attaching a medical gas outlet valve at the time of installation or regular maintenance, a pin guide system is adopted to the valve base of the outlet. A stop valve is provided at the base of each outlet valve for easy mainlen^ice, without disturbing the main branch gas pipeiine. This Medical Gas Outlet Unit is suitable for the medical treatment conditions in Operating Room, Intensive Care Units, Delivery Room, Immature Baby's Room and so uu.<br>
The 'MEDICAL GAS TERMINAL UNIT', basically consists of two separate modules, the brass forged and machined Rough Valve Assembly, as illustrated on Sheet No: 2, Figure (B) of the accompanying drawings and the machined brass Latch Valve Assembly, as illustrated on Sheet No; 3, Figure (C) of the accompanying drawings. While Rough Valve Assembly is the same for all types of gases, the Latch Valve Assembly determines the type of adopter, the outlet will accept.<br><br>
The Rough Valve Assembly basically consists of a brass forged-machined body that incorporates a stop-valve as shown on Drawing Sheet No: 2, Figure (B), as well as (3) of Figure (A) of the accompanying drawings. The purpose of incorporating a Stop-Valve, (1) of Figure (B) in the rough valve assembly is for easy maintenance, ^ the overhaul of the equipment could be carried out without requiring the entire pipeline to be shut down. A 3/8" diameter copper pipe is silver brazed into the body of the Rough Valve Assembly, which is meant for external pipeline connection. Guide Pin holes are provided in the Rough Valve Assembly to prevent any wrong matching of the Latch Valve Assembly. The Rough Valve Assembly is fixed on aplastic baseplate, (i) of Figure (A). In tiie Latch Valve Assembly, guide pins made of stainless steel are provided for non-interchangei^iUty of specific gas outlet, as illustrated in Figure (D) of the accompanying drawing. For example, tlie two pin holes in case of oxygen are at an angle of 180Â° and the con figu ratio ii of the stainless steel guide pius being accordingly. Similarly, the pinholes in case of Nitrous oxide are at an angle of 135" and in case of vacuum, it is 90". For Air, there are three pinholes, each at an angle of 120" with respect to each other. This distinct orientation of the pinholes and the corresponding relative position of the guide pins is unique for each of the gases, thereby ruling out even a remote possibility of mismatch. Thus the pin guide holes provided in the front of the Latch Valve Assembly ensures non-interchangeabilily of probe for each of the specific gas in service. The Latch Valve Assembly, Figure (C) on drawing sheet No: 3, as well as (4) of Figure (A) on Drawing Sheet No: 1 basically consists of amain Integral Gas seal (1) of Figure (C) and a Check Valve Mechanism. (3) on Figure (C), shows the position of the guide pm.<br><br>
The conjunction of the Rough Valve Assembly and tiie Latch Valve Assembly is by means of bolting three stainless steel alien bolts. Consequently, both the assemblies are covered with a plastic box (2) of Figure (A), keeping in view, the aesthetic aspects, with specific colour code release plastic handles (8) of Figure (A), projecting outw^ds.<br>
The Medical Gas Terminal Units arc used for the Medical Gas Pipeline System to terminate the gases from the Central Pipeline System. This newly invented 'MEDICAL GAS TERMINAL UNIT' is at par with the International Standards and Specifications. The gas from the branch line is terminated using vertical dropline size of 3/8" or Yi" copper conduit. A 6" long copper conduit (2) of Figure (B) is brazed in Rough Valve Assembly and joined witli dropline by means of brazing. The incoming gas is closed by a gas sea! through spring loaded poppet inside the Latch Valve Assembly. When we insert the probe, the poppet will be pushed inward and the probe end will be sealed by a seal ring, which is provided inside the Latch Valve Assembly, by which time the gas flows. Secondary equipment will be connected on the other end of the probe through a hose or directly to the valve. To release the probe, the released knob is turned clockwise so that the probe is disconnected from the outlet.<br>
The purpose of the stop valve is to easily maintain the system at the time of overhaul, by virtue of which servicing could be carried out without isolating the branch gas pipeline. A screw type stop valve with face seal and "0" ring is fastened with brass nut in the Rough Valve Assembly. For<br><br>
servicing, by screwing the stop valve, the entry of gas to the Rough Valve Assembly from the dropline will be sealed to the extent of 100%. after which the Latch Valve Assembly is isolated and serviced. After servicing, the stop-valve now is unscrewed so that the gas flows to the valve assembly, as usual.<br>
The gas sealing is done by providing a spring loaded poppet valve and a self-seal seat, which is placed in the Latch Valve Assembly and the whole unit is coupled with the Rough Valve Assembly by means of alien bolts. When the probe is inserted, the poppet will be pushed inside and thus this mechanism makes the gas to flow through the probe and the body seal will seal the probe outer area in such a manner to avoid any leakage within the valve.<br>
The non-interchangeable mechanism, which basically operates on "Difference in the Configuration of Pin-Guide Hole", is as enumerated on Figure (D) of Sheet No; 4 of the accompanying drawings. (3) of Figure (B) on Drawing Sheet No: 2, shows the placement of these pin-guide holes. Outlet valve and the probe are made non-interchangeable by the difference of pin-guide hobs and the relevant sketch is self-explanatory. For example, an oxygen probe fits only with the oxygen outlet valve and thus does not fit into any other valve.<br>
This mechanism of locking the probe inside the Latch Valve Assembly is facilitaled by providing two cams, loaded by tension plates, which in turn is screwed on either side of the Latchet Valve.   A brass release ring is<br><br>
screwed over the Latchet Valve by pin screws. When the spring is turned clockwise, the pin screws will open the cams and the probe will be released. A plastic release knob (6) of Figure (A) is screwed on to the ring for easy operation, as well as aesthetics. A release knob guide frame is provided for the respective gases wiUi colour codes for easy identification of each of Uie gases.<br>
The Key Probe (7) of Figure (A) is made of steel, with guide pins (3) of Figure (C). The hose connection is provided with the angle and encased with a neat plastic handle, consisting of three pieces. The entire assembly can be dismantled easily and the hose could be inserted and ferruled. A handle (8) of Figure (A) on Drawing Sheet No.L is provided for easy hmdling and aesthetics. A sticker is affixed on the respective handles with the gas name on it, for easy identification. A base plate (1) of Figure (A) is provided for fixing the Rough Valve Assembly. The whole valve assembly is enclosed in aplastic box and covered for standards and aesthetics, shown as (2) of Figure (A) on Drawing SheetNo.l of the accompanying drawings.<br><br><br>
