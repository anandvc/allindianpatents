				<td>Field of the invention;<br>
The present invention relates to a bioactive composition useful for induction of apoptosis thereof cytotoxicity and anti-cancer activity, obtained by natural isolate from Boswellia species, alternatively prepared semi-synthetically, that comprises an isomeric mixture of 3a, 24-dihydroxyurs-12-ene and 3a, 24-dihydroxyolean-12-ene of formula 1 in the ratio 1:20 to 1:1, alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable or other carriers.<br>
More particularly the present invention relates to bioactive composition useful for cancer of colon, prostrate, liver, breast, central nervous system (CNS), leukemia and malignancy of other tissues, including ascites and solid tumors wherein the cancer cell death is mediated by induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation at specific doses of the composition. The active mixture may be isolated from Boswellia serrata, Boswellia ovalifoliolata and related species or may be prepared semi-synthetically from the natural isolates i.e. boswellic acids, which comprise an isomeric mixture of a and p-boswellic acids or their carboxylic esters by lithium aluminium hydride reduction.<br>
The present invention further relates to the bioactive composition that kills cancer cells through induction of programmed cell death (apoptosis) and can be used for the treatment of cancer. The herbal product comprising an isomeric mixture of 3ot, 24-dihydroxyurs-12-ene and 3a, 24-dihydroxyolean-12-ene of formula 1 in the ratio 1:20 to 1:1 are isolated from<br><br>
Boswellia species and alternatively prepared semi-synthetically from (a+p) boswellic acids.<br>
Background and prior art of the invention;<br>
The gum exudates from Boswellia serrata, the source of these products has been used since long in the traditional Ayurvedic system of medicine for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases in Indian subcontinent besides being used in preparations of commercial importance such as in fragrance and cosmetic industry.<br>
Gum resin of another species of the same genus i.e. Boswellia ovalifoliolata Roxb (Buseraceae) is also the source of 3oc, 24-dihydroxyurs-12-ene and 3a, 24-dihydroxyolean-12-ene of formula 1 also known as olibanum was used traditionally in the perfumery industry only. Boswellia serrata is a rich source of pentacyclic triterpenoids also known as boswellic acids while Boswellia ovalifoliolata is rich in tetracyclic triterpenoids. One of the isomers of the bioactive constituents i.e. 3a, 24-dihydroxyurs-12-ene has earlier been isolated and reported as new natural triterpenoid from the gum resin of Boswellia serrata [(B. Mahajan, S. C. Taneja, V. K.Sethi and K. L. Dhar, Phytochemistry 39(2), (1995)453-55], though it was semisynthetically known earlier [Allan, G.G., Phytochemistry (1968), 7, 963]. However, there has been no report of its occurrence in two isomeric forms in plants including their bioactivity.<br>
Second to coronary heart diseases, cancer has emerged as the most common cause of death in many countries. Unlike normal cells, cancer cell appears<br><br>
after having undergone accumulation of several genes mutations within it, which account for independent and uncontrolled growth of this cell into a clonal expansion amounting to invasion of adjoining tissues, and some times metastasing to other tissues. Dysregulation of programmed cell death (apoptosis) is the hall mark of all cancer cells and hence provides important therapeutic target to intervene in the development of anti-cancer agents, because activation of apoptosis is a common mechanism of malignant cell killing by anti-cancer agents [(K.M.Deabatin, Activation of apoptosis pathways by anti-cancer treatment, Toxicol Lett., 112/113 (2000) 41-48)]. Several pathways therefore, are proposed to be involved in the death of cancer cells by anti-cancer drugs. The drug may kill cells by activation of death receptors mediated pathways or via mitochondrial dependent pathways involving reactive oxygen and nitrogen species culminating in activation of certain genes in the apoptotic signal transduction pathways. Several agents are known to kill malignant cells by inducing apoptosis via free radicals generation and one such example is doxorubicin [(G. Minotti, P. Mena, E. Salvatorelli, G. Cairo, L. Gianni, Anthracyclines: Molecular advances and pharmacologic developments in anti-tumor activity and cardiotoxicity, Pharmacol. Rev. 56 (2004), 185-229)]. Most of these agents activate various caspases, genes, translocate cytochrome c that upregulate downstream events leading to DNA fragmentation (DNA laddering) typical of apoptosis.<br>
In another two decades world is expected to peak in all kinds of cancer and brain cancer in particular appears difficult to manage. Recently there has been a report of inhibitory activity of boswellic acids against human leukemia HL-60 cells in culture. Out of the four natural boswellic acids tested in vitro against the cell line HL-60 it was reported that acetyl -11-<br><br>
keto-(3-boswellic acid induced the most pronounced inhibition in a dose dependent manner on DNA, RNA and protein synthesis (1C 50 values 0.6, 0.5, and 4.1 jo, mol) while for other boswellic acids of the same group recorded 1C 50 value in the range of 0.6- 7.1 |n mol. The effect of acetyl -11-keto-p-boswellic acid on DNA synthesis was found to be irreversible. The composition also significantly inhibited the cell growth of HL-60 [Yu Shao,, Chi-Tang Ho, Chee-Kok Chin, Vladimir Badmaev, Wei Ma and Mou-Tan Huang ; Planta Medico. 64 (1998) 328-31]. A patent has claimed the DNA topoisimerse I and II inhibitory effect of pentacyclic triterpenic acids of Boswellia serrate [Y-W. Lee, Q-C. Fang, Z-G. Wang, D-H. Li and C.E. Cook, (1991) USP 5,064,823]. There have also been IPR's related to the use of boswellic acid in the treatment of brain tumors [Simmet Thomas (De) (1994) USP 5919821 and USP 6174876] and other anti-cancer related activities of boswellic acids, [Subbiah, Ven, Natural product based apoptosis inducers (plant extracts), USP, 20050084547. Ammon, Hermann P.T, et al. use of boswellic acid and its derivatives for inhibiting normal and increased leucocytic elastase or plasmin activity (USP, 20020010168).<br>
Therefore, it is apparent from the literature search that in the present invention, the isolation and use of isomeric mixture of 3 a, 24-dihydroxyurs-12-ene and 3a, 24-dihydroxyolean-12-ene of formula 1 is novel as a cytotoxic agent and inducer of apoptosis in cancer cells and can be used for the treatment of cancer derived from various tissues.

Example-1<br>
Isolation of bioactive triterpenoids 3 a, 24-dihydroxyurs-12-ene and 3a, 24-dihydroxyolean-12-ene of formula 1 from the gum resin<br>
Boswellia serrata gum resin (IKg) was cleaned and made free of extraneous impurities. The gum is extracted with 3x3L of ethyl alcohol at room temperature. The combined extract after filtration was concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrated extract (530 g) was diluted with 3% potassium hydroxide solution (3L) and the mixture stirred for an hour. The aqueous extracted thus obtained was extracted with (2x 2L) hexane and then with 10% ethyl acetate in hexane (lx2L). The combined organic solvents were washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 130 g of viscous liquid comprising the neutral components of the gum resin. A portion of the concentrated extract (20g) was subjected to repeated column chromatography over silica gel. Gradient elution with hexane/ethyl acetate furnished besides other compounds, a compound (400 mg) mp 1 82°C, [a]D + 63. It was identified as a mixture of two isomeric compounds by 13CNMR,<br>
. The ratio of the isomeric mixture was determined by reverse phase HPLC on C-18 column (acetonitrile and water in the ratio of 95:5) and detection at 200 nm.<br><br>
Example-2<br>
Preparation of 3a, 24-dihydroxyurs-12-ene and 3a, 24-dihydroxyoIean-12-ene of formula 1 by semi-synthetic method<br>
a.	An isomeric mixture of (a+P) of boswellic acids (R=H) (230 mg) was<br>
dissolved in dry solvent ether at room temperature and to the stirring<br>
solution under nitrogen atmosphere was added lithium aluminum hydride 20<br>
mg (LiAlH4) while maintaining the temperature between 20-25°C. After the<br>
completion of the addition the reaction mixture is further stirred for one<br>
hour. The excess of LAH was destroyed by adding ethyl acetate and the<br>
organic layer washed with water. Concentration of the solvent gave desired<br>
product 3 a, 24-dihydroxyurs-12-ene and 3a, 24-dihydroxyolean-12-ene in<br>
almost quantitative yield (a:(3 :: 1:4). It was crystallized from hexane-ethyl<br>
acetate to furnish white crystal of mixture of formula 1 and confirmed by<br>
physicochemical and spectral data. The ratio of isomers (ot:p:  1:4) was<br>
estimated by HPLC on C-18 column using acetonitrile : water : acetic acid<br>
(95:5 : 0.1) as the mobile phase .<br>
b.	An isomeric mixture of (a+P) of boswellic acids was converted to methyl<br>
ester by diazomethane generated in situ by the method known in the art of<br>
synthesis. A mixture of (ct+p) of boswellic acids (230 mg) was dissolved in<br>
dry solvent ether and diazomethane solution in diethyl ether was slowly<br>
added till completion of reaction as monitored by TLC.  The mixture<br>
comprising the methyl esters of compound of structure formula 1 (R=Me)<br>
without purification was further reduced by LAH by the method described as in part a example 2.(Figure Removed) <br><br>

Human leukemia cells are grown in suspension in 96-well culture plate and were incubated with different concentrations of the composition for 48 hr. The cells were then incubated with MTT and the MTT-formazon formed is<br>
eluted with DMSO, and OD measured in ELISA Reader [(Shashi B., SinghJ., Rao, J.M., Saxena, A. K. and Qazi, G. N.(2006), A novel lignan composition from Cedrus deodara induces apoptosis and early nitric oxide generation in human leukemia Molt-4 and HL-60 cells. Nitric Oxide, 14, 72-88)]. The intensity of the color formed in the untreated control wells relates to 100% cell growth. The growth of<br>
cells is recorded with different concentrations of the bioactive composition of formula 1, and the concentration that inhibits 50% cell growth is taken as 1C so value.<br>

The composition of formula 1 induces programmed cell death (apoptosis), a desired therapeutic anticancer drug target, in lymphoblastic human leukaemia MOLT-4 and human myeloma leukaemia HL-60 cells. Composition of formula 1 produced dose dependent effect in both the cell lines and the DNA laddering produced is comparable to the one produced by standard anti-cancer drug camptothecin. Human leukemia cell lines grown in culture were exposed to 3-100 (J,g/ml of composition of formula 1 for 18hr. The control group received only the vehicle. Cells were similarly treated with camptothecin, 4uM as positive control. Increasing bioactive product concentration enhanced DNA ladder of about 180bp fragments as indicated by increased ethidium bromide fluorescence intensity of the fragments indicative of apoptosis.<br>

Concentration related influence of 3a, 24-dihydroxyurs-12-ene and 3a, 24-dihydroxyolean-12-ene of formula 1 on apoptosis: Flow cytometric analysis in HL-60 leukemia cells.<br>
During the early events of apoptosis, phospholipid phosphatidyl serine of plasma membrane is exteranalized, which has very high affinity for annexinV antibody. HL-60 cells were treated with different concentrations of composition of formula 1 and incubated for a brief period of 6 hr. There after, cells were washed and stained with FITC conjugated annexinV antibody and propidium iodide. The cells (10,000) were analyzed by flow cytometery (BD, LSR) using ProQuest software. The fraction of cell<br><br>
population in the lower right quadrant indicates apoptotic cells, upper right post apoptotic and upper left as necrotic populations. Composition of formula 1 produced concentration dependent increase in apoptotic and post apoptotic cell population. Composition of formula 1 at 1 jag/ml produced almost 18% apoptotic / post-apoptotic population, which increased to 74% at 50ug/ml concentration. The studies indicated that cell killing is mainly mediated via apoptosis and that composition of formula 1 is an interesting lead to be developed into anti-cancer agent.<br>

Example 7<br>
Influence of bioactive composition formula 1 on the early generation of reactive oxygen species (peroxides): analysis by flow cytometery<br>
The endogenous generation of peroxides was measured using a non-fluorescent probe DCFH-DA which upon entering the cell is deesterified to DCFH which is oxidized by the reactive oxygen species to a fluorescent product DCF that remains entrapped within the cells offering analysis by flow cytometery [(Shashi et al, 2006, cited in Example 4 )]. HL-60 cells were incubated with different concentrations of the composition of formula 1 for a brief period of 6hr. Thereafter cells were washed and stained for 1 hr with DCFH-DA and analysed on flow cytometer. The composition of formula 1 produced dose dependent increase in peroxide positive cell population, being 79% at 50 jug/ml. The pro-oxidant effect was completely impaired in the presence of anti-oxidant, ascorbate. Formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are indicated in the induction of apoptosis.<br>

Example 8<br>
Composition of formula 1 comprising 3 a, 24-Dihydroxyurs-12-ene and 3a, 24-dihydroxyolean-12-ene mediated early generation of endogenous nitric oxide measured by flow cytometery.<br>
Measurement of in situ NO generation involved the use of a fluorescent probe diaminofluoresceine-2-diacetate, which is permeated easily into the cells. Once inside the cell it binds NO soon it is formed and emits fluorescence [H.Kojima et, Development of a fluorescent indicator for the nitric oxide based on the fluoresceine chromophore, Chem. Pharm. Bull., 46 (1998) 373-375]. For this purpose, the HL-60 cells were incubated with DAF-2-DA for 30 min before being incubated with the composition of formula 1 for 6hr. Cells were washed and stained with anti-annexinV-PE. Cells were analyzed on flow cytometer in FL-1 channel for NO and FL-2 channel for apoptosis FL-1. It appears that all the cells formed NO within 6<br>
hr irrespective of the concentration of bioactive composition used, because there were no cells in the lower left quadrant as indicated in control cells. However, the extent of apoptosis was much higher in bioactive composition of formula 1 when the cell populations from the upper two quadrants (apoptotic and early apoptotic) are taken into consideration. Interaction of NO with superoxide, while both are generated simultaneously, may affect the mitochondria! membrane potential that may be responsible for the activation of apoptosis<br>

Example 9<br>
Mitochondrial membrane depolarization by 3 a, 24-dihydroxyurs-12-ene and 3a, 24-dihydroxyolean-12-ene of formula 1: measurement by flow cytometery<br>
Rhodamine-123 uptake into the mitochondria is driven by mitochondrial transmembrane potential ( \j/mt ) that allows the determination of cell population with active integrated mitochondrial functions. Loss of \j/mt would lead to depolarization of mitochondria consequent to ROS and NO generation leading to cell death. HL-60 cells were exposed to the composition of formula 1 for 12 hr and incubated with Rh-123. Cells, 10000, were acquired for analysis by flow cytometery. The percentage of cells with low Rh-123 fluorescence was calculated from the dot plot stastics. In untreated control cells more than 92% cells showed Rh-123 fluorescence, which decreased with treatment of composition of formula 1 .This shows that reactive oxygen/nitrogen species generated by 1 bring about oxidative damage to mitochondria ensuing apoptosis.<br>

Anti-cancer activity of 3 a, 24-dihydroxyurs-12-ene and 3a, 24-dihydroxyolean-12-ene of formula 1 in the mouse model of Sarcoma 180 solid tumor and Ehrlich ascitic carcinoma (suspension)<br>
Swiss albino mice, 6-8 weeks old (18-22 gm by weight) were bred and maintained at institute's animal house. Approval of the Institute's ethics committee was taken for use of laboratory animals and the procedures employed therein. The mice were housed in well individually ventilated cage (IVC) system and maintained on pelleted diet and water ad libitum. For the initiation of experiment, 1X107 cells of sarcoma -180 tumors were transplanted intramuscularly in the thigh of mice for the development of solid tumor. The day of tumor transplantation was assigned as day 0, next day (day-1) animals were randomly selected and divided into three groups of<br><br>
seven mice in each group of similar body wt. Group-1 was treated with composition of formula 1 100 mg/kg i.p prepared in 10 % alcohol of the total volume 0.2ml. Group-2 received 0.2 ml of vehicle and served as normal control while group-3 serving as positive control was treated with 5-FU (22 mg/ kg b.wt.) intraperitoneally. The total duration of treatment was of 9 days. The evaluation of effect of treatment on tumor was done on 13th day by measuring the tumor weight.<br>
Similarly Ehrlich Ascitic carcinoma (suspension tumor) was produced by transplanting IxlO7 cells of Ehrlich Ascitic Carcinoma intraperitoneally. In case of Ehrlich Ascites tumor model 1x107 cells of Ehrlich Ascitic tumor cells were transplanted intramuscularly in the right hind thigh of the mice for the development of solid tumor. Composition of formula 1 produced significant regression of tumor when given both orally and intraperitoneally in 10 % alcohol or in 0.5% Tween-20 (weight/vol, normal saline) in a total volume of 0.2 ml per mouse. The composition of formula 1 thus offers a novel innovation for its development as anticancer therapeutic.<br>
