				<td>The present invention relates to a Document having a security feature and a process for producing the same<br>
Field of the invention:<br>
The invention relates to a process for the production of documents, in particular securities or notes of value, with a security feature in the form of a foil component which is permanently attached to the document and cannot be changed without destroying it, and to a document, in particular a note of value with a security feature of this kind.<br>
Prior Art:<br>
Documents of this kind in the form of notes of value are known for example from EP-<br>
A-0 625 466 corresponding to Indian Patent No. 188877. According to it, to increase security against forgery pieces of film with optically variable images are stuck on the notes, these images being in particular holograms or cinegrams, which change their appearance depending on the angle from which they are viewed. Notes of this kind can not be reproduced with colour copiers.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
This invention is based on the task of further increasing the security of documents<br>
against forgery, above all bank notes, via the use of foil components, by creating an additional security feature which not only allows the individual registration of a document but also can be detected by any member of the general public without technical aids and which can be produced simply and reliably.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the production of documents (Wl, W2) with a security feature in the form of a foil component (2), which is permanently attached to the document and cannot be changed without destroying it, characterised in that<br>
giving machine readable variable image information to a foil component (2) before said foil component is applied to the documents (W1,W2), said image information varying from one foil component to another (3a,3b;4a,4b),, applying the foil component (2) to documents (W1,W2), passing the documents (W1,W2) through reading means, and applying a copy of the variable image information (7a,7b;8a,8b) to the documents (W1,W2) outside the foil component(2) via a printer controlled by the reading device.<br>
The variable image information contains preferably a combination of characters in the form of a sequence of letters and/or figures, which for example can be placed on the notes as part of the serial number and can be reproduced to the same or to a different scale.<br>
The foil component preferably contains not only the variable image information but also an unchanging part of the image, for example in the form of a hologram.<br>
The variable image information read is applied to the documents preferably with a non-impact printer, in particular an inkjet printer.<br>
A document in accordance with the invention is characterized by the fact that the foil component permanently attached to it has image information which is variable from one document to another and that the same image information is printed again, outside the foil component, on the document, as a copy to the same or a different scale.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings:<br>
The invention is more clearly explained by tne drawing of one embodiment, namely<br>
notes or bills with a seriai number. The illustrations show:<br>
Figures i and 2, two different notes of value which were made by the process in accordance with the invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)<br>
Each note of value Wl, W2 has a normal serial number 6a or 6b, in the embodiment concerned the serial number 13467 and 13468, and has a foil component 2 permanently attached to it which cannot be changed without destroying it. These foil components 2 are applied for example by hot-embossing on the notes.<br>
Before being applied to the notes, these foil components 2 are provided on the one hand with a machine-readable image information which is changed from one foil component to another, and on the other hand with an image section which is not changed and which is the same for all the foil components. In the embodiment concerned, the variable image information comprises a combination of characters 3a and 3b and a simple figure 4a and 4b for the notes Wl and W2, and the non-variable part of the image 5 comprises for example a hologram indicated only schematically, which thus is the same for all notes. In the embodiment concerned, the foil component 2 on note Wl has a combination of characters 3a comprising the sequence of characters ABC3 and as figure 4a a triangle, whereas the foil component 2 on note W2 has a combination of characters 3b comprising the sequence of characters XYZ5 and as figure 4b a circle.<br>
Once the foil components 2 have been applied to the notes, the latter are passed through a reading device which reads the variable image information, thus the combination of characters 3a and 3b and figures 4a and 4b. This variable image information is then applied to the relevant note outside the foil component 2 via a printer controlled by the reading device, and in the embodiment concerned the combination of characters read 3a and 3b is placed at the end of the serial numbers 6a and 6b as copies 7a and 7b, so that this combination of characters forms for the observer part of the serial number. At the same time, the figures 4a and 4b read on foil components 2 are placed underneath the serial numbers as figure copies 8a and 8b. This variable image information is applied to the notes,<br>
preferably with a non-impact printer, in particular an inkjet printer, whereby this reproduction can be to the same or, as shown for copies 8a and 8b, a different scale.<br>
The invention is not limited to the embodiment described, but allows for many variations with regard to the variable image information, which can be any sequence of numbers and/or letters and/or a variable figure, for example a variable interference figure, and with regard to the place where this image information is reproduced on the note of value. In addition, of course, variable information in the form of an additional figure does not have to be present. Also, any suitable known printing process can be used to make the variable image information, whereby after each individual print, a change to the image information takes place for the subsequent print.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We ciaim:<br>
i. A process for the production of documents (Wl, W2) with a security feature in the form of a foil component (2), which is permanently attached to the document and cannot be changed without destroying it, characterised in that<br>

-	passing the documents (Wl ,W2) through reading means, and<br>
-	applying a copy of the variable image information (7a,7b;8a,8b) to the documents (W1,W2) outside the foil component(2) via a printer controlled by the reading device.<br>
2	A process for the production of documents as claimed in claim 1, wherein the variable<br>
