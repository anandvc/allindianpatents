TITLE<br>
METHOD FOR CONTROLLING PARTICULAR INSECT PESTS BY APPLYING<br>
ANTHRANTLAMLDE COMPOUNDS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a method of use for controlling invertebrate pests in both agronomic and nonagronornic environments of certain anthranilamides, their TV-oxides, agriculturally suitable salts and compositions.<br>
The control of invertebrate pests is extremely important in achieving high crop efficiency. Damage by invertebrate pests to growing and stored agronomic crops can cause significant reduction in productivity and thereby result in increased costs to the consumer. The control of invertebrate pests in forestry, greenhouse crops, ornamentals, nursery crops, stored food and fiber products, livestock, household, and public and animal health is also important. Many products are commercially available for these purposes, but the need continues for new compounds that are more effective, less costly, less toxic, environmentally safer or have different modes of action.<br>

10     and 2,4-hexadienyl. "Alkynyl" includes straight-chain or branched alkynes such as<br>
1-propynyl, 2-propynyl and. the different butynyl, pentynyl and hexynyl isomers. "Alkynyl" can also include moieties comprised of multiple triple bonds such as 2,5-h.exadiynyl. "Alkoxy" includes, for example, methoxy, ethox3", 77-propyloxy, isopropyloxy and the different butoxy, pentoxy and hexyloxy isomers. "Alkoxyalkyl" denotes alkoxy substitution<br>
15      on alkyl. Examples of "alkoxyalkyl" include CH3 OCH2, CH3OCH2CH2, CH3CH2OCH2, CH3CH2CH2CH2OCH2 and CH3CH2OCH2CH2. "Alkylthio" includes branched or straight-chain alkylthio moieties such as methylthio, ethylthio, and the different propylthio, butylthio, pentylthio and hexylthio isomers. "Cycloalkyl" includes, for example, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and. cyclohexyl.<br>
20	The term "heterocyclic ring" or heterocyclic ring system" denotes rings or ring<br>
systems in which at least one ring atom is not carbon and. comprises 1 to 4 heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, provided that each heterocyclic ring contains no more than 4 nitrogens, no more than 2 oxygens and no more than 2 sulfurs. The heterocyclic ring can be attached through any available carbon<br>
25     or nitrogen by replacement of hydrogen on said carbon or nitrogen. The term "aromatic ring system" denotes fully unsaturated carbocycles and heterocycles in which at least one ring of the polycyclic ring system is aromatic (where aromatic indicates that the Hiickel rule is satisfied for the ring system). The term "heteroaromatic ring" denotes fully aromatic rings in which at least one"ring atom is not carbon and comprises 1 to 4 heteroatoms independently<br>
30     selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, provided that each<br>
heterocyclic ring contains no more than 4 nitrogens, no more than 2 oxygens and no more than 2 sulfurs (where aromatic indicates that the Hiickel rule is satisfied). The heterocyclic ring can be attached through any available carbon or nitrogen by replacement of hydrogen on said carbon or nitrogen. The term "aromatic heterocyclic ring system" includes fully<br>
35      aromatic heterocycles and heterocycles in which at least one ring of a polycyclic ring system is aromatic (where aromatic indicates that the Hiickel rule is satisfied). The term "fused heterobicyclic ring system" includes a ring system comprised of two fused rings in which at least one ring atom is not carbon and can be aromatic or non aromatic, as defined above.<br><br>
WO 03/015518<br><br>
PCT/US02/25613<br><br>
5<br>
The term, "halogen", either alone or in compound words such as "haloalkyl", includes<br>
fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. Further, when used in compound, words such as<br>
"haloalkyl", said alkyl may be partially or fully substituted with halogen atoms which may<br>
be the same or different. Examples of "haloalkyT include F3C, C1CH2, CF3CH9 and<br>
5     CF3CCI2. The terras "haloalkenyl", "haloalkynjT", "haloalkoxy", and the like, are defined<br>
analogously to the terra "haloalkyl". Examples of "haloalkenyl" include (Cl)2OCHCH2<br>
and CF3CH2CH=CHCH2. Examples of "haloalkynyl" include HOCCHCL CF3C=C,<br>
CCI3 C^C and FCH2OCCH2. Examples of "haloalkoxy" include CF3 O, CC13 CH20,<br>
HCF2CH2CH20 and CF3CH20.<br>
10	The total number of carbon atoms in a substituent group is indicated by the "Ci-Cj"<br>
prefix where i and j are numbers from 1 to 8. For example, C1-04 alkylsulfonyl designates methylsulfonyl through butylsulfonyl; C2 alkoxyalkyl designates CH30CH2; C3 alkoxyalkyl designates, for example, CH3CH(OCH3), CH3OCH2CH2 or CH3CH2OCH2; and C4 alkox3^alkyl designates the various isomers of an alkyl group substituted with an alkoxy 15     group containing a total of four carbon atoms, examples including CHL3CH2CH2OCH2 and CH3CH2OCH2CH2. In the above recitations, when a compound of Formula I comprises a heterocyclic ring, all substituents are attached to this ring through any available carbon or nitrogen by replacement of a hydrogen on said carbon or nitrogen.<br>
The term "optionally substituted with one to three substituents" indicates that one to 20     three of the available positions on the group may be substituted. When a group contains a substituent which can be hydrogen, for example R6, then, when this substituent is taken as hydrogen, it is recognized that this is equivalent to said group being unsubstituted.<br>
Compounds of Formula I can exist as one or more stereoisomers. The various stereoisomers include enantiomers, diastereomers, atropisomers and geometric isomers. One 25     skilled in the art will appreciate that one stereoisomer may be more active and/or may exhibit beneficial effects when enriched relative to the other stereoisomer(s) or when separated from the other stereoisomer(s). Additionally, the skilled artisan knows how to separate, enrich, and/or to selectively prepare said stereoisomers. Accordingly, the compounds of Formula I may be present as a mixture of stereoisomers, individual 30     stereoisomers, or as an optically active form. Similarly, compounds of Formula 10 can exist as one or more stereoisomers. The various stereoisomers include enantiomers, diastereomers, atropisomers and geometric isomers. One skilled in the ait will appreciate that one stereoisomer of a compound of Formula 10 may be more useful in preparing a specific stereoisomer of Formula I. Additionally, the skilled artisan knows how to separate, 35     enrich, and/or to selectively prepare said stereoisomers. Accordingly, the compounds of Formula 10 may be present as a mixture of stereoisomers, individual stereoisomers, or as an optically active form.<br><br>
WO 03/015518	PCT/US02/25613<br>
The salts of the compounds of Formula I include acid-addition salts with inorganic or<br>
organic acids such as hydrobromic, hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, acetic, butyric,<br>
fumaric, lactic, maleic, malonic, oxalic, propionic, salicylic, tartaric, 4-toluenesulfonic or<br>
valeric acids.<br>
5	As noted above, R7 is (among others) a phenyl, a benzyl, a 5- or 6-membered<br>
heteroaromatic ring, a naphthyl ring system or an aromatic 8-, 9- or 10-membered fused heterobicyclic ring system, each ring or ring system optionally substituted with one to three substituents independently selected from R9. The term "optionally substituted" in connection with these R7 groups refers to groups which are unsubstituted or have at least one 10     non-hydrogen substituent that does not extinguish the invertebrate pest control activity possessed by the unsubstituted analog. Note also that J-l through J-4 below denote 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic rings. An example of a phenyl ring optionally substituted with 1 to 3 R9 is the ring illustrated as J-5 in Exhibit 1, wherein r is an integer from 0 to 3. An example of a benzyl ring optionally substituted with 1 to 3 R9 is the ring illustrated as J-6 in 15      Exhibit 1, wherein r is an integer from 0 to 3. An example of a naphthyl ring system         optionally substituted with 1 to 3 R9 is illustrated as J-59 in Exhibit 1, wherein r is an integer from 0 to 3. Examples of a 5- or 6-membered heteroaromatic ring optionally substituted with 1 to 3 R9 include the rings J-7 through J-58 illustrated in Exhibit 1 wherein r is an integer from 0 to 3. Note that J-7 through J-26 are examples of J-l, J-27 through J-41 are 20      examples of J-2, and J-46 through J-58 are examples of J-3 and J-4. The nitrogen atoms that require substitution to fill then valence are substituted with H or R9. Note that some J groups -can only be substituted with less than 3 R9 groups (e.g. J-19, J-20, J-23 through J-26 and J-37 through J-40 can only be substituted with one R9). Examples of aromatic 8-, 9- or 10-membered fused heterobicyclic ring systems optionally substituted with 1 to 3 R9 include 25     J-60 through J-90 illustrated in Exhibit 1 wherein r is an integer from 0 to 3. Although R9 groups are shown in the structures J-5 through J-907 it is noted that they do not need to be present since they are optional substituents. Note that when the attachment point between (R9)r and the J group is illustrated as floating, (R9)r can be attached to any available carbon atom of the J group. Note that when the attachment point on the J group is illustrated as 30     floating, the J group can be attached to the remainder of Formula I through any available carbon of the J group by replacement of a hydrogen atom.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Useful formulations include liquids such as solutions (including emulsifiable concentrates), suspensions,<br>
can be thickened into gels. Useful formulations further include solids such as dusts,<br>
powders, granules, pellets, tablets, films, and the like which can be water-dispersible<br>
("wettable") or water-soluble. Active ingredient can be (micro)encapsulated and further<br>
formed into a suspension or solid formulation; alternatively the entire formulation of active<br>
ingredient can be encapsulated (or "overcoated"). Encapsulation can control or delay release<br>
of the active ingredient. Spray able formulations can be extended in suitable media and used<br>
at spray volumes from about one to several hundred liters per hectare. High-strength<br>
compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation.<br>
The formulations will typically contain effective amounts of active ingredient, diluent<br>
and surfactant within the following approximate ranges that add up to 10.0 percent by weight.<br>

In certain instances, combinations with other invertebrate pest control compounds or 25     agents having a similar spectrum of control but a different mode of action will be<br>
particularly advantageous for resistance management. Thus, compositions of the present invention can further comprise an biologically effective amount of at least one additional invertebrate pest control compounds or agents having a similar spectrum of control but a different mode of action. Contacting a plant genetically modified to express a plant 30 protection compound (e.g., protein) or the locus of the plant with a biologically effective amount of a compound of invention can also provide a broader spectrum of plant protection and be advantageous for resistance management.<br>
Invertebrate pests are controlled and protection of agronomic, horticultural and specialty crops, animal and human health is achieved by applying one or more of the 35      compounds of this mvention, in an effective amount, to the environment of the pests including the agronomic and/or nonagronomic locus of infestation, to the area to be protected, or directly on the pests to be controlled. Thus, the present invention further comprises a method for the control of foliar- and soil-inha"biting invertebrates and protection<br><br>
WO 03/015518<br><br>
PCT/OS02/25613<br><br>

of agronomic and/or nonagronomic crops, comprising contacting the invertebrates or their environment with a biologically effective amount of one or more of the compounds of the invention, or with a composition comprising at least one such compound or a composition comprising at least one such compound and an effective amount of at least one additional 5      biologically active compound or agent. A preferred method of contact is by spraying. Alternatively, a granular composition comprising a compound of the invention can be applied to the plant foliage or the soil. Compounds of this invention are effective in delivery through plant uptake by contacting the plant with a composition comprising a compound of this invention applied as a soil drench of a liquid formulation, a granular formulation to the<br>
10     soil, a nursery box treatment or a dip of transplants. Other methods of contact include<br>
application of a compound or a composition of the invention by direct and residual sprays, aerial sprays, seed coats, microencapsulations, systemic uptake, baits, eartags, boluses, Joggers, furnigants, aerosols, dusts and many others.<br>
The compounds of this invention can be incorporated into baits that are consumed by<br>
15     the invertebrates or within devices such as traps and the like. Granules or baits comprising between 0.01-5% active ingredient, 0.05-10% moisture retaining agent(s) and 40-99% vegetable flour are effective in controlling soil insects at very low application rates, particularly at doses of active ingredient that are lethal by ingestion rather than by direct contact.<br>
20	The compounds of this invention can be applied in their pure state, but most often<br>
application will be of a formulation comprising one or more compounds with suitable carriers, diluents, and surfactants and possibly in combination with a food depending on the contemplated end use. A preferred method of application involves spraying a water dispersion or refined oil solution of the compounds. Combinations with spray oils, spray oil<br>
25     concentrations, spreader stickers, adjuvants, other solvents, and synergists such as piperonyl butpxide often enhance compound efficacy.<br>
The rate of application required for effective control (i.e. "biologically effective amount") will depend on such factors as the species of invertebrate to be controlled, the pest"s life cycle, life stage, its size, location, time of year, host crop or animal, feeding<br>
30     behavior, mating behavior, ambient moisture, temperature, and the like. Under normal circumstances, application rates of about 0.01 to 2 kg of active ingredient per hectare are sufficient to control pests in agronomic ecosystems, but as little as 0.0001 kg/hectare may be sufficient or as much as 8 kg/hectare may be required. For nonagronomic applications, effective use rates will range from about 1.0 to 50 mg/square meter but as little as<br>
35      0.1 mg/square meter may be sufficient or as much as 150 mg/square meter may be required. One skilled in the art can easily determine the biologically effective amount necessary for the desired level of invertebrate pest control.<br><br>
