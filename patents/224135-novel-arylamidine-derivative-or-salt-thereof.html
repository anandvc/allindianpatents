				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
NOVEL ARYLAMIDINE DERIVATIVE OR SALT THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel<br>
arylamidine derivative having an antifungal activity,<br>
or a salt thereof. In addition, it relates to an<br>
antifungal agent containing the arylamidine derivative<br>
as active ingredients.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Serious deep mycosis such as invasive<br>
candidiasis often becomes a fatal disease. Originally,<br>
it has been considered that a principal protective<br>
mechanism on the side of a host organism to Mycomycetes<br>
such as Candida would be nonspecific immunization by<br>
neutrophils. When this protective mechanism normally<br>
functions, there is a little risk of becoming infected<br>
with Mycomycetes. However, in recent years, a risk of<br>
developing deep mycosis has been increased because of<br>
increase in the number of patients with underlying<br>
diseases decreasing the immunological function of an<br>
organism, such as malignant tumors (in particular,<br>
hemopoietic malignant tumors such as acute leukemia or<br>
malignant lymphoma) or AIDS, heavy use of anticancer<br>
agents or immunosuppressive agents, heavy use of<br>
antibacterial antibiotics or steroid hormone, long-term<br><br>
use of central venous hyperalimentation or venous<br>
catheterization, and so on (Rinsho to Biseibutsu<br>
(Clinics and Microorganisms), vol. 17, p. 265, 1990).<br>
The number of agents applied to a treatment<br>
for such deep mycosis is much smaller than that of<br>
antibacterial agents. There are only 6 types of<br>
agents, such as amphotericin B, flucytosine,<br>
miconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, and micafungin.<br>
Amphotericin B has an extremely strong<br>
fungicidal action to Mycomycetes. However, at the same<br>
time, it has a problem regarding strong side effects<br>
such as nephrotoxicity, and therefore, to use the agent<br>
in a clinical situation is limited. In addition,<br>
flucytosine has a problem that the agent causes rapid<br>
development of resistance when it is chronically used.<br>
Accordingly, at present, this agent is seldom used<br>
singly. Micafungin has a low activity to the<br>
Cryptococcus species. Other agents are generically<br>
called azole antifungal agents in terms of their<br>
structural characteristics. There is a general<br>
tendency that the fungicidal action of these agents to<br>
Mycomycetes is poorer than that of amphotericin B.<br>
However, considering both effectiveness and safety,<br>
azole antifungal agents are most frequently used at<br>
present ((Rinsho to Biseibutsu (Clinics and<br>
Microorganisms), vol. 21, p. 277, 1994).<br>
Currently, fluconazole-resistant Candida<br>
albicans (C. albicans) has been detected with a high<br><br>
frequency of 30% or more in oropharyngeal candidiasis<br>
lesion of AIDS patients to whom fluconazole had been<br>
repeatedly administered. Moreover, most of the<br>
resistant strains show cross resistance to itraconazole<br>
and other azole agents. Furthermore, separation of the<br>
resistant strains has also been reported regarding non-<br>
AIDS patients who developed chronic mucocutaneous<br>
candidiasis or deep candidiasis {Rinsho to Biseibutsu<br>
(Clinics and Microorganisms), vol. 28, p. 57, 2001).<br>
Thus, if a limited number of agents have a<br>
problem regarding resistance, it will inevitably affect<br>
the management of patients with deep mycosis, the<br>
number of which is being increased (Rinsho to<br>
Biseibutsu (Clinics and Microorganisms), vol. 28, p.<br>
51, 2001).<br>
Accordingly, it is strongly desired that an<br>
antifungal agent will be developed, whose action<br>
mechanism differs from those of the existing agents and<br>
which has effects on Mycomycetes resistant to azole<br>
agents, while having a little side effects.<br>

Test example 1 Antifungal action<br>
50% growth inhibitory concentration (IC50) was<br>
measured according to the microbroth dilution method,<br>
using, as a reference, the antifungal agent sensitivity<br>
test method proposed by the subcommittee for the<br>
antifungal agent sensitivity test, the Japanese Society<br>
for Medical Mycology (Japanese Journal of Medical<br><br>
Mycology, vol. 36, No. 1, pp. 62 to 64, 1995).<br>
Synthetic amino acid medium, fungal (SAAMF,<br>
manufactured by Nippon Bio-Supp. Center) was used as a<br>
medium for measurement of sensitivity. Candida<br>
albicans TIMM 1623 was cultured at 30°C overnight on a<br>
Sabouraud agar plate medium (Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd.),<br>
and the obtained culture was suspended in a sterilized<br>
physiological saline solution. Thereafter, the<br>
suspension was diluted with a measurement medium such<br>
that the number of cells became 1 x 104 cells/ml,<br>
thereby producing an inoculum organism solution. 175<br>
µl of a medium, 5 µl of a test agent (an agent diluted<br>
solvent in a growth control well), and 20 µl of the<br>
inoculum organism solution were added to a 96-well<br>
microplate (flat bottom, manufactured by Sumitomo<br>
Bakelite Co., Ltd.), and the mixture was stirred with a<br>
mixer. Thereafter, using a well Reader SME3400<br>
(Scinics Co., Ltd.), an initial turbidity at a<br>
wavelength of 630 nm was measured. The above mixture<br>
was cultured at 35°C, and 36 hours later, a final<br>
turbidity was measure in the same manner. For an<br>
agent-diluted line, values were obtained by subtracting<br>
the initial turbidities from the final turbidities.<br>
For a growth control line also, values were obtained by<br>
subtracting the initial turbidities from the final<br>
turbidities. IC50 was defined as the lowest agent<br>
concentration among the test agent concentrations<br>
having a turbidity equal to or lower than the 50% value<br><br>
(IC50 calculated value) of a value obtained by<br>
subtracting the initial turbidity of a growth control<br>
from the final turbidity thereof. The results<br>
regarding the IC50 value to each cell strain are shown<br>
in Table 14.<br><br>
Test example 2 Therapeutic effect of Candida albicans<br>
on mouse systemic infection<br>
Candida albicans TIMM 1623 was cultured at<br>
30°C overnight on a Sabouraud agar plate medium (Eiken<br>
Chemical Co., Ltd.), and the obtained culture was<br>
suspended in a sterilized physiological saline<br>
solution. Thus, a fungal solution for infection,<br>
having a concentration of 1 x 107 cells/ml, was<br>
prepared. This fungal solution was inoculated in a<br>
concentration of 0.2 ml (2 x 106 CFU/mouse) into the<br>
tail vein of each of five ICR male mice (4-week-old,<br>
body weight of 20 ± 1 g). 2 hours later, 0.2 ml of a<br><br>
solution, which had been prepared by dissolving a test<br>
compound into a sterilized physiological saline<br>
solution and setting the concentration at 0.01 mg/ml,<br>
was administered once into the dorsal subcutis of each<br>
mouse. To mice of a control group, an equal amount of<br>
a sterilized physiological saline solution was<br>
administered.<br>
Viability of the mice was observed until the<br>
14th day after the infection, and the cumulative<br>
survival rate (T/C) of the treatment group to the<br>
control group was calculated, and the obtained value<br>
was used as an index of the life-prolonging effect.<br>
As a result, it was found that, in the case<br>
of the compound in Example 24, T/C was 180 with<br>
administration of 0.1 mg/kg.<br>
Test example 3 Therapeutic effect of Candida albicans<br>
on mouse systemic infection<br>
Candida albicans TIMM 1623 was cultured at<br>
30°C overnight on a Sabouraud agar plate medium (Eiken<br>
Chemical Co., Ltd.), and the cultured fumgus was<br>
suspended in a sterilized physiological saline<br>
solution. Thus, a fungal solution for infection,<br>
having a concentration of approximately 107 cells/ml,<br>
was prepared. 0.2 ml of this fungal solution was<br>
inoculated into the tail vein of each of five ICR male<br>
mice (4-week-old, body weight of 20 ± 1 g). 2 hours<br>
after the infection, 0.2 ml of a solution, which had<br><br>
been prepared by dissolving a test compound into a<br>
sterilized physiological saline solution and adjusting<br>
the concentration at 0.01 mg/ml, was administered once<br>
into the dorsal subcutis of each mouse. From the<br>
following day, the same solution was administered<br>
thereto once a day for 6 days. Thus, the above<br>
solution was administered into the dorsal subcutis of<br>
the mice 7 times in total. To mice of a control group,<br>
an equal amount of a sterilized physiological saline<br>
solution was administered. Viability of the mice was<br>
observed until the 28th day after the infection.<br>
As a result, it was found that the mice of<br>
the control group all died by the 28th day after the<br>
infection, but that the mice of the compound<br>
administration groups in Example 24, Example 40-2, and<br>
Example 56 survived at a ratio of 3/5, 4/5, and 4/5,<br>
respectively.<br>
