CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Application No. 11/283,217, filed<br>
November 18,2005, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/710,341 filed August 22, 2005, the contents of both of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention also relates to chewing gum compositions and products that<br>
exhibit reduced stickiness or non-stick properties during processing, storage, and/or after<br>
chewing. Moreover, the present invention further relates to chewing gum bases for use in<br>
such chewing gum compositions which contribute to the reduced and non-stick properties.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Conventional chewing gum products are not "environmentally-friendly." They can<br>
maintain stickiness during and after chewing and adhere to the ground (as well as any other<br>
surface with which the gum product may come into contact) if care is not used with regard to<br>
disposal of the gum product. The stickiness of such conventional chewing gum products<br>
results, in large part, from the use of elastomer solvents (i.e., resins) and other "tacky"<br>
ingredients (such as wax) during the manufacturing process. In particular, conventional<br>
chewing gums manufactured using elastomer solvents exhibit a continuous or substantially<br>
continuous phase when chewed. As the continuous phase is characterized by an amorphous<br>
elastomer matrix containing sticky elastomer solvents, the gum bolus that results upon<br>
chewing also is sticky.<br>
Many elastomers, and particularly high molecular weight elastomers (e.g. 200,000<br>
mw or greater), used in chewing gum compositions are usually solid at room temperature.<br>
They are usually purchased as blocks of solid material and generally require softening using<br>
solvents to be useful in chewing gum compositions. Softening elastomers in the absence of<br>
1<br>
 <br>
elastomer solvents is difficult, since the solid elastomer must still be processed into a<br>
continuous homogeneous and flowable mass to be useful in chewing gum compositions.<br>
Although gum products that are manufactured without the use of elastomer solvents<br>
and/or other "tacky" ingredients have reportedly been developed, such gum products often<br>
rely on "non-conventional" gum ingredients to achieve desired properties. U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,882,702, for example, obviates the need for elastomer solvents by replacing elastomers with<br>
a plasticized proteinaceous material such as zein. The incorporation of non-conventional<br>
ingredients in gum products, however, often compromises taste and thus can be undesirable<br>
from a consumer acceptability standpoint.<br>
Moreover, although gum products that allegedly do not stick to teeth and oral<br>
prosthetics during mastication are reported (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,518,615 ), there<br>
nevertheless remains a need for chewing gum products that also exhibit reduced stickiness or<br>
non-stick properties upon disposal of the gum product subsequent to chewing. In particular,<br>
there remains a need for environmentally-friendly chewing gum boluses that exhibit reduced<br>
stickiness to, or do not stick to, those surfaces where gum boluses that are improperly<br>
disposed of are often found (e.g., pavement, shoes, hair, undersides of tables and desks).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Some embodiments of the invention are directed to producing reduced-stick or non-<br>
stick gum base and reduced-stick or non-stick chewing gum compositions using such gum<br>
base. The reduced or non-stick properties are achieved by employing certain fats and/or oils<br>
which soften the elastomers in chewing gum without causing excess stickiness. Other<br>
embodiments of the invention relate to rendering chewing gum compositions biodegradable.<br>
Biodegradability is enhanced by incorporation of free-radical generators, such as<br>
photosensitizers.<br>
As used herein the transitional term "comprising," (also "comprises," etc.) which is<br>
synonymous with "including," "containing," or "characterized by," is inclusive or open-ended<br>
and does not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps, regardless of its use in<br>
the preamble or the body of a claim.<br>
8<br>
 <br>
As used herein, the terms "bubble gum" and "chewing gum" are used interchangeably<br>
and are both meant to include any gum composition.<br>
As used herein, the term "non-stick inducing component(s)" refers to components that<br>
are incorporated in a gum composition such that the gum composition exhibits reduced<br>
stickiness as compared to the same gum composition in the absence of the non-stick inducing<br>
components. Desirably, the non-stick inducing components have a number of advantages,<br>
including facilitating the softening of solid elastomer components in the production of gum<br>
base as well as preventing or reducing the tendency of chewing gum compositions and<br>
products made therefrom from sticking to surfaces such as packages, teeth, oral prosthetics<br>
such as implants and dentures, as well as to concrete, stone, plastic, wood, pavement, brick,<br>
glass and various other similar surfaces. The non-stick inducing components may be any<br>
components that cause the final (as defined herein) Tg of an elastomer used in a chewing gum<br>
composition to change no more than about three degrees (3 Â°), up or down from the initial Tg<br>
(as defined herein) during processing. The non-stick inducing components also may be any<br>
components that serve as a release agent, as defined herein. Furthermore, the non-stick<br>
components may be any components that crystallize or form domain regions in the gum base<br>
elastomers. Additionally, the non-stick inducing components may be any components that<br>
have a hydrophobic portion and a hydrophilic portion, wherein the hydrophobic portion is<br>
capable of orienting inwardly within a gum bolus and the hydrophilic portion is capable of<br>
orienting outwardly within a gum bolus. Non-stick inducing components include, for<br>
example, oils and other fats that may be included in a gum composition in an amount<br>
sufficient to render the composition non-sticky, both during processing and after processing<br>
of a chewing gum subsequent to chewing of the gum products made therefrom. These non-<br>
stick inducing components may be used to replace some or all of the elastomer solvent<br>
materials, such as resins and waxes conventionally used in chewing gum compositions. The<br>
non-stick inducing components, when added to a gum base may also act as an elastomer<br>
processing aid to permit softening processing of the elastomer from a solid to a useful gum<br>
base material.<br>
As used herein, the term "Tg" refers to the glass transition temperature of an<br>
elastomer used in chewing gum compositions as measured at any time before or after<br>
processing of the elastomer. Mor^'prticularly, the term 'Tg initial" refers to the glass<br>
9<br>
 <br>
transition temperature of an elastomer prior to processing of the elastomer into a substantially<br>
homogenous mass in the presence of a non-stick inducing component. The term 'Tg final"<br>
refers to the glass transition temperature of an elastomer subsequent to processing of the<br>
elastomer into a softened mass useful for gum base.<br>
Glass transition temperature (Tg) is generally understood to be the temperature below<br>
which molecules have very little mobility. On a larger scale, polymers are rigid and brittle<br>
below their glass transition.temperature and can undergo plastic deformation above it. Tg is<br>
usually applicable to amorphous phases and is commonly Applicable to glasses, plastics and<br>
rubbers. In polymers, Tg is often expressed as the temperature at which the Gibbs free<br>
energy is such that the activation energy for the cooperative movement of a .significant<br>
portion of the polymer is exceeded. This allows molecular chains to slide past each other<br>
when a force is applied.<br>
The non-stick inducing components may contribute to one or more of the following<br>
advantages: (i) facilitate the process of converting a solid or solid-like elastomer into some<br>
other form, such as a homogenous or substantially homogenous softened or malleable mass;<br>
(ii) allow sufficient softening for processing and for use in a chewing gum product; and (iii)<br>
provide softening without an increase in stickiness of the final gum product. The non-stick<br>
inducing components, when used in the present invention may provide one or more of these<br>
advantages, as well as modulate the change in elastomer Tg during formation of the gum<br>
base. In some embodiments, when the non-stick inducing components are used to make a<br>
chewing gum base , the Tg of the elastomer used to make the gum base changes no more than<br>
about three degrees (3 Â°) up or down (plus/minus) as compared to the Tg of the elastomer<br>
prior to gum base processing. The maximum three degrees change (i.e., Tg final) includes a<br>
change either higher or lower than the Tg initial. For example, if the Tg initial of the<br>
elastomer is 60Â°C, the Tg final of the elastomer subsequent to the addition of the non-stick<br>
inducing component may be about 57Â°C to about 63Â°C, e.g., +/- 3Â°C. The term "non-stick<br>
inducing components" also includes, for example, any component that facilitates the process<br>
of converting solid or solid-like elastomers to a form useful for chewing during batch<br>
systems, continuous systems, and other manufacturing systems and/or processes known in the<br>
art. Desirably, the elastomer processing aid has a limited capability to plasticize polymers, as<br>
defined herein below.<br>
10<br>
 <br>
As used herein, the phrase "release properties" means properties that allow a chewing<br>
gum base and/or chewing gum product to exhibit reduced adherence to a surface.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "limited capability to plasticize polymers" means that a<br>
component will not change the Tg of a gum base more than about plus/minus three (+/- 3)<br>
degrees upon incorporation of the component into the gum base.<br>
As used herein, the term "processing" refers to any step taken during the manufacture<br>
of a gum base and/or gum product, including any step that occurs when manufacturing a gum<br>
product by means of batch systems, continuous systems, or any other manufacturing system<br>
known in the art. As used herein, the term processing includes the process of "masticating an<br>
elastomer" so that it is suitable for inclusion in a chewing gum product.<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, various chewing gum compositions and<br>
products made therefrom are provided with reduced stickiness or non-stick properties by the<br>
incorporation of non-stick inducing components which include various fats and oils. These<br>
non-stick inducing components may be used to partially or fully replace conventional<br>
components such as elastomer solvents and certain waxy materials, which are conventionally<br>
used to soften gum base elastomers such that they are processible for chewing gum<br>
compositions, but which are known to contribute to the stickiness of chewing gum<br>
compositions made therefrom. The incorporation of these non-stick inducing components<br>
have a number of advantages in the processing of gum base as well as contributes to the<br>
overall reduced stickiness in the final chewing gum compositions and products made<br>
therefrom.<br>
In some embodiments, the non-stick inducing components, when added to the gum<br>
base, allow for softening in the gum base elastomers such that they can be easily processed<br>
from solid rubbers to soft matrices, which can then be incorporated into chewing gum<br>
compositions.<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, the addition of the non-stick inducing<br>
components balances the softening of the gum base elastomer components, as well as the<br>
chewing gum composition as a whole, while reducing the overall stickiness of the products<br>
made therefrom.<br>
11<br>
 <br>
In some embodiments, the elastomer components in chewing gum compositions, such<br>
as those used to form gum base, are softened through the incorporation of the non-stick<br>
inducing components without changing the glass transition temperature (TgÂ°C) of the<br>
elastomer more than three degrees above its initial TgÂ°C nor less than three degrees below the<br>
initial TgÂ°C, i.e., +/- three (3) degrees.<br>
In other embodiments, the non-stick inducing components have been found to exhibit<br>
various physical properties including the ability to migrate to the surface of the chewing gum<br>
product to create a release barrier which reduces the ability of the chewing gum product to<br>
stick to surfaces. In some embodiments, the non-stick inducing components have<br>
hydrophobic and hydrophilic character, i.e., HLB values, which enhance the release barrier<br>
characteristics due to the tendency of these materials to molecularly orient themselves such<br>
that the hydrophobic portion orients itself inward of the chewing gum and they hydrophilic<br>
portion orients itself to the surface of the chewing gum, thereby contributing to the release<br>
properties and reducing the stickiness.<br>
Non-stick inducing components may be present in the gum base prior to its use in a<br>
chewing gum composition, as well as being added to the chewing gum composition as a<br>
whole. In some embodiments, conventional components which contribute to stickiness, such<br>
as elastomer solvents, may be partially for fully replaced with the non-stick inducing<br>
components of the present invention. It has also been discovered, that the addition of a<br>
methyl ester liquid rosin, desirably in low amounts, may be advantageously employed to<br>
enhance softening without contributing to stickiness. It has been discovered that methyl ester<br>
liquid resins tend to be relatively small molecules which do not destroy emulsions which may<br>
be formed by the elastomer/non-stick inducing components.<br>
In other embodiments of the invention, the chewing gum compositions may be<br>
rendered more environmentally friendly by the incorporation of additional components which<br>
enhance the degradation of the chewing gum, such that it looses its ability to maintain its<br>
cohesiveness and crumbles and breaks apart into smaller, discontinuous pieces over time.<br>
Components which contribute to the degradation include light absorbing materials which<br>
upon exposure to light, e.g. sunlight, react with the elastomer components and cause them to<br>
degrade, or otherwise become modified to become less sticky. In some embodiments, upon<br>
12<br>
 <br>
exposure to light, the molecular weight of the elastomer component is reduced sufficiently<br>
enough to render them and chewing gum compositions containing them less sticky. In some<br>
embodiments, there may be included components which when exposed to light cause an<br>
increase in the molecular weight of the elastomer components sufficient to reduce the<br>
stickiness of the elastomer, as well as reduce the stickiness of chewing gum compositions<br>
containing them.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "non-conventional gum ingredients" refers to ingredients<br>
not conventionally included in chewing gum products and includes ingredients such as zein<br>
and seed oils from the plant genus Cuphea.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "conventional gum ingredients" refers to ingredients<br>
traditionally included in gum products such as elastomers and elastomer solvents.<br>
As used herein, the term "surface", when used in connection with non-stick<br>
properties, refers to any surface with which a chewing gum base, chewing gum composition,<br>
chewing gum product or chewing gum bolus comes into contact. Such surfaces include<br>
without limitation, for example, the following: any surface in the oral cavity such as the<br>
surface of a tooth or the surface of any dental or orthodontic device contained in the oral<br>
cavity; any surface on a human body including the skin, such as the skin on the face, and hair;<br>
and any surface external to a human body, such as the surface of pavements, sidewalks,<br>
roadways, brick, glass, wood, plastic, stone, furniture, carpeting, the soles of footwear<br>
including shoes or sneakers, cardboard, paper, metal, and surfaces of porous nature to which<br>
conventional gum ingredients stick and are difficult to remove.<br>
The present invention provides numerous advantages over conventional chewing gum<br>
compositions by the incorporation of certain components which aid in the processing of the<br>
gum base, as well as contribute to certain advantages and properties in the final chewing gum<br>
compositions and products made therefrom. One such advantage is the reduced-stick and/or<br>
non-stick properties that are imparted to the gum base and consequently to the chewing gum<br>
compositions as a whole, both during processing of the chewing gum base and subsequent to<br>
chewing. Another advantage is the ability to process elastomer gum base components<br>
without relying on conventional solvent additives, such as gum resins. Yet another advantage<br>
4s the ability to substitute some or all of the elastomer solvent within a gum base with the<br>
13<br>
 <br>
non-stick inducing components. In some embodiments, only a portion of an elastomer<br>
solvent is replaced to take advantage of the softening capabilities of the solvent without<br>
imparting stickiness to chewing gum compositions made therefrom.<br>
Any suitable non-stick inducing components as defined herein may be incorporated in<br>
the present inventive chewing gum bases. Desirably, the non-stick inducing component(s)<br>
provide(s) a maximum change in glass transition temperature of an elastomer of about +/- 3 Â°<br>
when brought into contact with an elastomer (e.g., by mixing) during manufacture of a<br>
chewing gum base.<br>
In some embodiments, the chewing gum compositions of the present invention<br>
include a non-stick inducing component in an amount sufficient to migrate to the surface of a<br>
chewing gum product formed therefrom and provide a surface barrier. Desirably, the surface<br>
barrier has release properties such that a gum bolus formed upon chewing exhibits a reduced<br>
adherence to a variety of surfaces as compared to gum compositions not containing the non-<br>
stick inducing component.<br>
In some embodiments, the chewing gum compositions of the present invention<br>
include non-stick inducing components that are molecularly oriented within the gum base in<br>
such a manner that the gum base exhibits reduced stickiness as compared to the gum base in<br>
the absence of the non-stick inducing components, hi particular, in some embodiments, the<br>
non-stick inducing components contain a hydrophobic portion that is oriented inwardly<br>
within the chewing gum product and a hydrophilic portion that is oriented outwardly.<br>
For example, in some embodiments, the non-stick inducing component may be a<br>
surface release agent having a hydrophilic portion and a hydrophobic portion. When such a<br>
surface release agent is employed, the hydrophobic portion of the surface release agent tends<br>
to direct itself within the chewing gum composition and the hydrophilic portion tends to<br>
direct itself toward the chewing gum composition surface upon migration of the surface<br>
release agent to the surface of the chewing gum.<br>
In some embodiments, the non-stick inducing components when added to gum bases<br>
form domain regions which indicate the crystallization of the non-stick components within an<br>
elastomer matrix. The non-stick inducing components may have limited miscibility in the<br>
14<br>
 <br>
elastomer at room temperature such that upon cooling of the gum base or chewing gum<br>
composition, a separate crystalline phase forms. In particular, in some embodiments of the<br>
invention, such domains can form upon cooling of the gum base during processing.<br>
Advantageously, chewing gum compositions incorporating gum bases containing such<br>
domains exhibit reduced stickiness to surfaces that are both internal and external to the<br>
mouth, as compared to gum bases not containing such domains. Moreover, when a gum base<br>
contains at least one domain and at least one elastomer, the at least one domain may be<br>
characterized by a particular Tg value and the at least one elastomer may be characterized by<br>
a different Tg value.<br>
Accordingly, unlike conventional gum bases which have a continuous phase of a<br>
sticky elastomer matrix, the gum bases of the present invention may have a discontinuous<br>
phase that is separate and distinct from the elastomer matrix of the gum base. Gum bases of<br>
the present invention that contain a discontinuous phase exhibit reduced stickiness as<br>
compared to gum bases not having a discontinuous phase.<br>
The discontinuous phase may be a result of one or more of the following: the<br>
formation of a release barrier on the surface of the gum base due to the incorporation of a<br>
non-stick inducing component therein; the presence of domains; and the orientation of the<br>
non-stick inducing component such that the gum base surface has greater hydrophilic<br>
character.<br>
The non-stick inducing component may include, for example, any suitable fat or oil or<br>
combination thereof which performs to reduce stickiness or render non-stick the composition<br>
and products made therefrom. In particular, they may include fats and oils having an HLB<br>
(hydrophilic lipophilic balance) range of about 3.5 to about 13. Useful fats and oils include<br>
those having a wide range of melting points, for example from about 10 Â°C and about 75 Â°C,<br>
desirably from about 20Â°C to about 73Â°C and more desirably about 40 Â°C and about 70 Â°C.<br>
More particularly, non-stick inducing components may include, without limitation,<br>
the following: various fats and oils including saturated and unsaturated fatty acids having a<br>
carbon chain length of Cu to C24; including for example saturated and unsaturated fatty acids<br>
such as stearic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid, linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, myristic acid,<br>
palmitoleic acid and vaccenic acid; monoglycerides, diglyCSrides, and triglycerides of<br>
15<br>
 <br>
saturated and unsaturated fatty acids having a chain length of C14 to C24; natural fats<br>
containing predominantly triglycerides of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids having a chain<br>
length of C14 to C24, including hydrogenated and non-hydrogenated cottonseed oil, soybean<br>
oil, canola oil, olive oil, grape seed oil, peanut oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, palm oil,<br>
cocoa butter, coconut oil, and palm kernel oil; esters of monoglycerides and diglycerides,<br>
such as acetylated monoglycerides and acetylated diglycerides and the glycerol esters of fatty<br>
acids including glycerol monostearate (GMS); animal fats such as beef tallow oil, lard, butter<br>
and chicken fat; fatty esters of sugars; esters of alcohols such as lower alkyl (Q.4) stearates<br>
including methyl and ethyl stearates, as well as high molecular weight esters of alcohols;<br>
phospholipids such as lecithin and lanolin; and mixtures and combinations thereof.<br>
Fatty acids and their esters having lengths of C2-C13 may also be employed in<br>
combination with the C14-C24 fatty acid esters described above but due to the tendency of the<br>
medium chain triglycerides (MCTs having a carbon chain length of C6-C12) to be more<br>
miscible or compatible with the elastomer, their presence must be balanced such that the Tg<br>
final as defined herein is maintained and/or separate crystals and/or domains are present or<br>
maintained in the elastomer matrix.<br>
The ratio of non-stick inducing component to elastomer (non-stick: elastomer) may be<br>
in the range of about 1:1 to about 10:1 and desirably in the range of about 4:1 to about 8:1.<br>
When optional components such as elastomer solvents or waxes are employed along with the<br>
non-stick inducing component, the ratio of non-stick inducing component to elastomer<br>
solvent (non-stick solvent or wax) may be about 1:0 to about 4:1.<br>
Desirably, some embodiments include inventive gum bases which have at least one<br>
non-stick inducing component having a melting point of about 60Â°C to about 70 Â°C and at<br>
least one other non-stick inducing component having a melting point of about 20Â°C to about<br>
40 Â°C. More particularly, the present inventive gum bases may include at least one fat having<br>
a melting point of about 70 Â°C and at least one fat having a melting point of about 40 Â°C.<br>
The non-stick inducing component may be present in amounts of about 10% to about<br>
60% by weight of the chewing gum base. In some embodiments, the non-stick inducing<br>
component may be present in amounts of about 20% to about 50% by weight of the chewing<br>
16<br>
 <br>
gum base. In other embodiments, the non-stick inducing component may be present in<br>
amounts of about 30% to about 40% by weight of the chewing gum base.<br>
The elastomers (rubbers) employed in the gum base will vary greatly depending upon<br>
various factors such as the type of gum base desired, the consistency of gum composition<br>
desired and the other components used in the composition to make the final chewing gum<br>
product. The elastomer may be any water-insoluble polymer known in the art, and includes<br>
those gum polymers utilized for chewing gums and bubble gums. Illustrative examples of<br>
suitable polymers in gum bases include both natural and synthetic elastomers. For example,<br>
those polymers which are suitable in gum base compositions include, without limitation,<br>
natural substances (of vegetable origin) such as chicle, natural rubber, crown gum, nispero,<br>
rosidinha, jelutong, perillo, niger gutta, tunu, balata, guttapercha, lechi capsi, sorva, guttakay,<br>
and the like, and combinations thereof. Examples of synthetic elastomers include, without<br>
limitation, styrene-butadiene copolymers (SBR), polyisobutylene, isobutylene-isoprene<br>
copolymers, polyethylene, polyvinyl acetate and the like, and combinations thereof. Specific<br>
examples of elastomers include polyisobutylene, styrene butadiene rubber, butyl rubber, and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
Additional useful polymers include: polybutuylmethacrylate/acrylic acid copolymers,<br>
polyvinylacetate/vinylalcohol copolymers, microcrystalline celluylose, sodium<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxylpropylmethyl cellulose, crosslinked cellulose acetate<br>
phthalate, crosslinked hydroxyl methyl cellulose polymers, zein, crosslinked polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone, polymethylmethacrylate/acrylic acid copolymers, copolymers of lactic acid,<br>
polyhydroxyalkanoates, plasticized ethylcellulose, polyvinyl acetatephthalate and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
In general, the elastomer employed in the gum base may have an average molecular<br>
weight of at least about 200,000. Desirably, the elastomer employed in the gum base has an<br>
average molecular weight from about 200,000 to about 2,000,000.<br>
It is particularly useful to include an elastomer composition including a predominant<br>
amount of a material selected from polyisobutylene, butyl rubber, butadiene-styrene rubber<br>
and combinations thereof, the elastomer composition having an average molecular weight of<br>
at least about 200,000; and a mastication processing aid, wherein the addition of the non-<br>
17<br>
 <br>
stick inducing component maintains the glass transition temperature of the elastomer within<br>
a three degree (3Â°) range, i.e., +/- three degrees. By "predominant" is meant that the<br>
composition includes greater than about 50% to about 98%of a material selected from<br>
polyisobutylene, butyl rubber, butadiene-styrene rubber and combinations thereof.<br>
The amount of elastomer employed in the gum base may vary depending upon<br>
various factors such as the type of gum base used, the consistency of the gum composition<br>
desired and the other components used in the composition to make the final chewing gum<br>
product. In general, the elastomer may be present in the gum base in an amount from about<br>
1% to about 30% by weight of the gum base. Desirably, the elastomer is present in an<br>
amount from about 2% to about 15% by weight of the gum base. More desirably, the<br>
elastomer is present in the gum base in an amount from about 3% to about 10% by weight of<br>
the gum base.<br>
In some embodiments, the chewing gum base may include a texture-modifier. In<br>
general, the texture-modifier has a molecular weight of at least about 2,000.<br>
In some embodiments, the texture-modifier comprises a vinyl polymer. Suitable<br>
texture-modifiers include, for example, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl laurate acetate, polyvinyl<br>
alcohol or mixtures thereof.<br>
Desirably, the texture-modifier is present in an amount from about 15% to about 70%<br>
by weight of the gum base. More desirably, the texture-modifier is present in an amount<br>
from about 20% to about 60% by weight of the gum base. Most desirably, the texture-<br>
modifier is present in an amount from about 30 % to about 45% by weight of the gum base.<br>
In addition to the components set out above, the gum base may include a variety of<br>
other ingredients, such as components selected from elastomer solvents, emulsifiers,<br>
plasticizers, fillers, and mixtures thereof. As mentioned above, the use of elastomer solvents<br>
is not needed to masticate the rubber during the manufacturing process. It may be present in<br>
limited amounts, but can lessen from the non-stick properties of the invention if used in<br>
amounts above about 5% by weight of the gum base.<br>
18<br>
 <br>
In some embodiments, the gum base may also contain less than conventional amounts<br>
of elastomer solvents to aid in softening the elastomer component. Such solvents are not<br>
required, but may be used in limited amounts along with the non-stick inducing components.<br>
Such elastomer solvents may include those elastomer solvents known in the art, for example,<br>
terpinene resins such as polymers of alpha-pinene or beta-pinene, methyl, glycerol and<br>
pentaerythritol esters of rosins and modified rosins and gums such as hydrogenated,<br>
dimerized and polymerized rosins, and mixtures thereof. Examples of elastomer solvents<br>
suitable for use herein may include the pentaerythritol ester of partially hydrogenated wood<br>
and gum rosin, the pentaerythritol ester of wood and gum rosin, the glycerol ester of wood<br>
rosin, the glycerol ester of partially dimerized wood and gum rosin, the glycerol ester of<br>
polymerized wood and gum rosin, the glycerol ester of tall oil rosin, the glycerol ester of<br>
wood and gum rosin and the partially hydrogenated wood and gum rosin and the partially<br>
hydrogenated methyl ester of wood and rosin, and the like, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The elastomer solvent may be employed in the gum base in less than conventional<br>
amounts, for example, amounts from about 0% to about 5.0%, and preferably from about<br>
0.1% to about 3.0%, by weight, of the gum base. In some embodiments, the gum base<br>
includes a maximum of about 5.0% by weight of an elastomer solvent. In other<br>
embodiments, the gum base is free of added elastomer solvent. In some embodiments the<br>
gum base is also free of added waxes.<br>
Desirably, the incorporation of an elastomer solvent in the gum base does not interfere<br>
with the non-stick inducing components of the gum base. In particular, the elastomer solvent<br>
desirably softens the gum base without contributing to stickiness. Moreover, the Tg of the<br>
gum base desirably does not change more than +/- three (3 Â°) upon incorporation of the<br>
elastomer solvent in the gum base.<br>
In some embodiments, the elastomer solvent employed may have at least one<br>
hydrophilic portion and at least one hydrophobic portion such that the hydrophilic portion<br>
orients inwardly within a gum base and such that the hydrophilic portion orients outwardly<br>
within a gum base made from elastomers. Suitable elastomer solvents having at least one<br>
hydrophilic portion and at least one hydrophobic portion include, for example, methyl ester<br>
liquid rosin. It is especially useful to incorporate a methyl ester liquid rosin in relatively low<br>
amounts. Methyl ester liquid rosin interferes less with the non-stick inducing components as<br>
19<br>
 <br>
compared to other resins, but yet acts to increase softening of the gum base without<br>
contributing to increased stickiness when used in combination with the non-stick inducing<br>
component.<br>
Desirably, a methyl ester liquid rosin is incorporated in a gum base in an amount from<br>
about 0.5% by weight to about 5.0% by weight of the gum base. More desirably, a methyl<br>
ester liquid rosin is incorporated in a gum base in an amount from about 1.0% by weight to<br>
about 3.0% by weight of the gum base.<br>
The gum base also may include emulsifiers which aid in dispersing the immiscible<br>
components of the gum base into a single stable system. The emulsifiers useful in this<br>
invention include glyceryl monostearate, lecithin, fatty acid monoglycerides, diglycerides,<br>
propylene glycol monostearate, and the like, and mixtures thereof. The emulsifier may be<br>
employed in amounts from about 0% to about 50%, and more specifically, from about 2% to<br>
about 7%, by weight, of the gum base.<br>
The gum base also may include plasticizers or softeners to provide a variety of<br>
desirable textures and consistency properties. Because of the low molecular weight of these<br>
ingredients, the plasticizers and softeners are able to penetrate the fundamental structure of<br>
the gum base making it plastic and less viscous. Useful plasticizers and softeners include<br>
triacetin (glyceryl triacetate), lanolin, palmitic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, sodium stearate,<br>
potassium stearate, glyceryl triacetate, glyceryl lecithin, glyceryl monostearate, propylene<br>
glycol monostearate, acetylated monoglyceride, glycerine, waxes, and the like, and mixtures<br>
thereof. The aforementioned plasticizers and softeners are generally employed in the gum<br>
base in amounts up to about 20% by weight of the gum base, and more specifically in<br>
amounts from about 2% to about 12%, by weight of the gum base.<br>
Suitable waxes, include for example, natural and synthetic waxes, petroleum waxes<br>
such as polyurethane waxes, polyethylene waxes, paraffin waxes, microcrystalline waxes,<br>
and fatty waxes. Wax can be present in the gum base in an amount from about 1% to about<br>
15% by weight of the gum base. When used, the wax is desirably present in an amount from<br>
about 2% to about 10% by weight of the gum base and, more desirably, is present in an<br>
amount from about 3% to about 8% by weight of the gum base.<br>
20<br>
 <br>
In some embodiments, the gum base includes a maximum of about 8% of a wax. In<br>
other embodiments, the gum base is free of added wax.<br>
Anhydrous glycerin also may be employed as a softening agent, such as the<br>
commercially available United States Pharmacopeia (USP) grade. Glycerin is a syrupy liquid<br>
with a sweet warm taste and has a sweetness of about 60% of that of cane sugar. Because<br>
glycerin is hygroscopic, the anhydrous glycerin may be maintained under anhydrous<br>
conditions throughout the preparation of the chewing gum composition.<br>
In some embodiments, the gum base of this invention also may include effective<br>
amounts of bulking agents such as mineral* adjuvants which may serve as fillers and textural<br>
agents. Useful mineral adjuvants include calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, alumina,<br>
aluminum hydroxide, aluminum silicate, talc, starch, tricalcium phosphate, dicalcium<br>
phosphate, calcium sulfate and the like, and mixtures thereof. These fillers or adjuvants may<br>
be used in the gum base compositions in various amounts. The filler may be present in an<br>
amount from about zero to about 40% by weight of the gum base and, more specifically, from<br>
about zero to about 30%, by weight, of the gum base. In some embodiments, the amount of<br>
filler will be from about zero to about 15% by weight of the gum base and, more specifically,<br>
from about 3% to about 11%, by weight, of the gum base.<br>
In some embodiments, the gum base also may include at least one hydrophilic, water-<br>
absorbing polymer to help reduce the stickiness of the gum base and any resultant gum<br>
product made from the gum base. Suitable hydrophilic, water-absorbing polymers include<br>
the following: native and modified starches; chemically modified cellulose, including methyl<br>
cellulose, ethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose; gums including<br>
xanthan gum, carageenan gum, guar gum, gum arabic, locust bean gum, curdlan,<br>
arabinoxylan, agara, and alginate; and pectin and gelatin.<br>
In general, at least one hydrophilic, water-absorbing polymer is included in an amount<br>
from about 0.1% to about 10% by weight of the gum base. Desirably, at least one<br>
hydrophilic, water-absorbing polymer is present in an amount from about 2% by weight to<br>
about 8% by weight of the gum base. More desirably, at least one hydrophilic, water-<br>
absorbing polymer is present in an amount from about 3% by weight to about 6% by weight<br>
of the gum base.<br>
21<br>
 <br>
In some embodiments, the chewing gum compositions include at least one elastomer<br>
and at least one agent capable of changing the molecular weight of the elastomer over time,<br>
such as by degrading the elastomer or increasing the molecular weight of the elastomer.<br>
Any agent that is capable of degrading an elastomer may be incorporated in various<br>
chewing gum composition embodiments. Desirably, the agent is lipophilic and is<br>
incorporated in the gum base composition. In some embodiments, an agent serves to<br>
enhance the degradation of the gum product in the presence of light, i.e., photodegradation.<br>
A particularly useful agent that is capable of enhancing the elastomer degradation in the<br>
presence of light is chlorophyll and derivatives such as chlorophyllin, pheophytin,<br>
pyropheophytin and pheophorbide. Chlorophyll and its derivatives are capable of absorbing<br>
light and generating free radicals. The presence of free radicals may react with elastomer<br>
components to render them less sticky.<br>
Other suitable components to enhance degradation include other photosensitizers such<br>
as phthalocyanine derivatives, riboflavin, hemoglobin, myoglobin, and heme. In some<br>
embodiments, the elastomer component may be degraded by oxidation to form smaller<br>
discontinuous phases of elastomer. In some embodiments, the elastomer component may<br>
interact with free radicals to increase the elastomer molecular weight. When certain<br>
elastomer components are used in combination with the chlorophyll, such as elastomers with<br>
unsaturated bonds, the chlorophyll may increase the molecular weight of the elastomeric<br>
component by inducing higher molecular weight reaction products caused by free radical<br>
generation. A variety of reaction possibilities may occur depending on such factors as the<br>
type of elastomer present, the amount of degradation agent present such as free-radical<br>
inducing agent, the particular chewing gum composition, as well as the type of light and<br>
environmental exposure the chewing gum sees.<br>
In some embodiments, the at least one agent capable of degrading an elastomer is<br>
encapsulated. Encapsulation may be desirable to prevent premature degradation of the<br>
chewing gum base prior to mastication. The at least one agent capable of degrading an<br>
elastomer may be encapsulated as microcapsules or microparticles as described in PCT<br>
Publication No. WO 2004/064544, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
22<br>
 <br>
Suitable encapsulants include, but are not limited to, fats, polymers, carbohydrates and<br>
combinations thereof. A particularly suitable encapsulant is gum arabic.<br>
In some embodiments the agent capable of degrading an elastomer is present in the<br>
chewing gum composition as part of the center-fill. In such compositions the agent may be<br>
encapsulated or non-encapsulated.<br>
In some embodiments, the agent capable of degrading an elastomer is present in a<br>
coating of the chewing gum composition. For example, such coatings are used on sugarless<br>
tablet gums to provide crunchiness as well as flavor, sweetness and sensate perception. In<br>
such compositions, the agent maybe encapsulated or non-encapsulated.<br>
In general, the at least one agent capable of degrading an elastomer is present in an<br>
amount sufficient to substantially degrade the chewing gum product subsequent to<br>
mastication over time. In some embodiments, the at least one agent capable of degrading an<br>
elastomer is present in an amount sufficient to substantially degrade the chewing gum<br>
product subsequent to mastication within about ten (10) weeks.<br>
Desirably, the at least one agent capable of degrading an elastomer is present in an<br>
amount from about 0.01% to about 0.3% by weight of the gum base. More desirably, the at<br>
least one agent capable of degrading an elastomer is present in an amount from about 0.05%<br>
to about 0.2% by weight of the gum base. Most desirably, the at least one agent capable of<br>
degrading an elastomer is present in an amount from about 0.07% to about 0.12% by weight<br>
of the gum base.<br>
In general, chlorophyll may be present in an amount from about 0.01% to about 0.3%<br>
by weight of the gum base. Desirably, chlorophyll may be present in an amount from about<br>
0.05% to about 0.2% by weight of the gum base. More desirably, chlorophyll may be present<br>
in an amount from about 0.07 to about 0.12% by weight of the gum base.<br>
In some embodiments, at least one antioxidant may be present in the chewing gum<br>
bases. Desirably, the antioxidant is water-soluble. Suitable antioxidants include, for<br>
example, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), propyl gallate,<br>
vitamin C, vitamin E and mixtures thereof.<br>
23<br>
 <br>
When an antioxidant is included in the gum base, the antioxidant is generally present<br>
in an amount from about 0.01% by weight to about 0.3% by weight of the gum base.<br>
Desirably, the antioxidant is included in the gum base in an amount from about 0.05% by<br>
weight to about 0.1% by weight of the gum base. When incorporated in embodiments<br>
together with the agent capable of degrading the elastomer, it is desirable to keep the<br>
antioxidant down to lower amounts to prevent any interference with free radicals which may<br>
be generated by photosensitizers.<br>
The chewing gum bases of the present invention do not stick to a variety of surfaces<br>
or exhibit reduced stickiness as compared to chewing gum bases not having the present<br>
inventive compositions. In particular, during manufacture, the chewing gum bases do not<br>
stick to processing equipment. Moreover, during chewing, the chewing gum bases do not<br>
stick to surfaces within the oral cavity, including the teeth and any orthodontic or dental<br>
appliances. Additionally, gum boluses of the present invention will not stick to, or will have<br>
reduced stickiness, to a variety of surfaces external to the oral cavity, including, for example,<br>
asphalt, bricks, wood, plastic, hair, skin, carpeting, and the soles of shoes, as compared to<br>
gum boluses not having the formulations of the gum boluses of the present invention.<br>
Some embodiments of the present invention provide chewing gum compositions and<br>
products that have non-stick surfaces during processing and subsequent to chewing into a<br>
gum bolus.<br>
In some embodiments, a chewing gum base as discussed above may be incorporated<br>
in a chewing gum composition in an amount from about 5% by weight to about 95% by<br>
weight. More desirably, a chewing gum base may be present in an amount from about 28%<br>
by weight to about 42% by weight of the total chewing gum composition, and even more<br>
specifically, the range may be from about 28% to about 30% by weight of the total chewing<br>
gum composition. In the case of center-filled chewing gum compositions, this weight percent<br>
may be based on the gum region rather than the center-filled region.<br>
The present inventive chewing gum compositions may include bulk sweeteners such<br>
as sugars, sugarless bulk sweeteners, or the like, or mixtures thereof.<br>
24<br>
 <br>
Suitable sugar sweeteners generally include monosaccharides, di-saccharides and<br>
poly-saccharides such as but not limited to, sucrose (sugar), dextrose, maltose, dextrin,<br>
xylose, ribose, glucose, lactose, mannose, galactose, fructose (levulose), invert sugar, fructo<br>
oligo saccharide syrups, partially hydrolyzed starch, corn syrup solids, isomaltulose, and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable sugarless bulk sweeteners include sugar alcohols (or polyols) such as, but not<br>
limited to, sorbitol, xylitol, mannitol, galactitol, maltitol, hydrogenated isomaltulose<br>

mixtures thereof. Hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are primarily prepared by the controlled<br>
catalytic hydrogenation of corn syrups. The resulting hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are<br>
mixtures of monomelic, dimeric, and polymeric saccharides. The ratios of these different<br>
saccharides give different hydrogenated starch hydrolysates different properties. Mixtures of<br>
hydrogenated starch hydrolysates, such as LYCASINÂ®, a commercially available product<br>
manufactured by Roquette Freres of France, and HYSTARÂ®, a commercially available<br>
product manufactured SPI Polyols, Inc. of New Castle, Delaware, also are useful.<br>

incorporated in their entirety herein by reference.<br>
Various herbs also may be included such as those with various medicinal or dietary<br>
supplement properties. Herbs are generally aromatic plants or plant parts that can be used<br>
medicinally or for flavoring. Suitable herbs can be used singly or in various mixtures.<br>
Commonly used herbs include Echinacea, Goldenseal, Calendula, Aloe, Blood Root,<br>
Grapefruit Seed Extract, Black Cohosh, Cranberry, Ginko Biloba, St. John's Wort, Evening<br>
Primrose Oil, Yohimbe Bark, Green Tea, Maca, Bilberry, Lutein, and combinations thereof.<br>
Acidulants also may be included in the chewing gum compositions. Suitable<br>
acidulants include, for example, malic acid, adipic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, fumane acid,<br>
and mixtures thereof.<br>
Any of the aforementioned additives for use in a chewing gum composition, as well<br>
as other conventional additives known to one having ordinary skill in the art, such as<br>
thickeners, may be incorporated into the chewing gum base of the chewing gum compositions<br>
or any coating that the chewing gum product may contain.<br>
35<br>
 <br>
The chewing gum compositions of the present invention may be formed into a variety<br>
of shapes and sizes and may take various product forms, including without limitation, sticks,<br>
slabs, chunks, balls, pillows, tablet, pellet, center-filled, pressed tablet, deposited, compressed<br>
chewing gum or any other suitable format as well as coated and uncoated forms.<br>
When the chewing gum compositions are formed into coated products, the coating<br>
may be applied by any method known in the art. The coating composition may be present in<br>
an amount from about 2% to about 60%, more specifically from about 25% to about 35% by<br>
weight of the total center-filled gum piece, even more specifically about 30% by weight of<br>
the gum piece.<br>
The outer coating may be hard or crunchy. Typically, the outer coating may include<br>
sorbitol, maltitol, xylitol, erythritol, isomalt, and other crystallizable polyols; sucrose may<br>
also be used. Furthermore the coating may include several opaque layers, such that the<br>
chewing gum composition is not visible through the coating itself, which can optionally be<br>
covered with a further one or more transparent layers for aesthetic, textural and protective<br>
purposes. The outer coating may also contain small amounts of water and gum arabic. The<br>
coating can be further coated with wax. The coating may be applied in a conventional manner<br>
by successive applications of a coating solution, with drying in between each coat. As the<br>
coating dries it usually becomes opaque and is usually white, though other colorants may be<br>
added. A polyol coating can be further coated with wax. The coating can further include<br>
colored flakes or speckles. If the composition comprises a coating, it is possible that one or<br>
more oral care actives can be dispersed throughout the coating. This is especially preferred if<br>
one or more oral care actives is incompatible in a single phase composition with another of<br>
the actives. Flavors may also be added to yield unique product characteristics.<br>
In the case of center-filled chewing gum products, the coating may also be formulated<br>
to assist with increasing the thermal stability of the gum piece and preventing leaking of the<br>
liquid fill. In some embodiments, the coating may include a gelatin composition. The gelatin<br>
composition may be added as a 40% by weight solution and may be present in the coating<br>
composition from about 5% to about 10% by weight of the coating composition, and more<br>
specifically about 7% to about 8%. The gel strength of the gelatin may be from about 130<br>
bloom to about 250 bloom.<br>
36<br>
 <br>
Other materials may be added to the coating to achieve desired properties. These<br>
materials may include without limitations, cellulosics such as carboxymethyl cellulose,<br>
gelatin, pullulan, alginate, starch, carrageenan, xanthan gum, gum arabic and polyvinyl<br>
acetate (PVA).<br>
The coating composition may also include a pre-coating which is added to the<br>
individual gum pieces prior to an optional hard coating. The pre-coating may include an<br>
application of polyvinyl acetate (PVA). This may be applied as a solution of PVA in a<br>
solvent, such as ethyl alcohol. When an outer hard coating is desired, the PVA application<br>
may be approximately 3% to 4% by weight of the total coating or about 1 % of the total<br>
weight of the gum piece (including a liquid-fill, gum region and hard coating).<br>
Some embodiments extend to methods of processing an elastomer in a gum base. In<br>
particular, some embodiments extend to methods of processing an elastomer for use in a gum<br>
base without substantially changing the Tg of the gum base as measured by differential<br>
scanning calorimetry (DSC). Such methods include the step of mixing at least one elastomer<br>
and at least one fat.<br>
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is a thermoanalytical technique in which the<br>
difference in the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a sample and<br>
reference are measured as a function of temperature. The basic principle underlying this<br>
technique is that, when the sample undergoes a physical transformation such as phase<br>
transitions, more (or less) heat will need to flow to it than the reference to maintain both at<br>
the same temperature. Whether more or less heat must flow to the sample depends on<br>
whether the process is exothermic or endpthermic. For example, as a solid sample melts to a<br>
liquid it will require more heat flowing to the sample to increase its temperature at the same<br>
rate as the reference. This is due to the absorption of heat by the sample as it undergoes the<br>
endothermic phase transition from solid to liquid. Likewise, as the sample undergoes<br>
exothermic processes (such as crystallization) less heat is required to raise the sample<br>
temperature. By observing the difference in heat flow between the sample and reference,<br>
differential scanning calorimeters are able to measure the amount of energy absorbed or<br>
released during such transitions. DSC is used to observe more subtle phase changes, such as<br>
glass transitions.<br>
37<br>
 <br>
Other embodiments extend to methods of processing a solid elastomer that include:<br>
providing a solid elastomer composition suitable for use in a chewing gum base and<br>
combining with the solid elastomer composition a non-stick inducing component including at<br>
least one fat having an HLB range of about 3.5 to about 13. In such methods, the non-stick<br>
inducing component is present in amounts sufficient to permit mastication of the solid<br>
elastomer composition into a homogenous mass.<br>
In some embodiments, the above-described methods of processing an elastomer are<br>
carried out in the presence of very low amounts of elastomer solvent. In such embodiments,<br>
the elastomer solvent includes a maximum of about 5.0% of any gum base made by<br>
masticating an elastomer as described above.<br>
In other embodiments, the above-described methods of processing an elastomer are<br>
carried out in the absence of added elastomer solvent.<br>
Some embodiments extend to methods of making a chewing gum base. In some<br>
embodiments, the methods of making a chewing gum base include providing at least one<br>
elastomer and mixing at least one non-stick inducing component with the elastomer to form a<br>
chewing gum base, wherein the at least one non-stick inducing component softens the<br>
elastomer without causing the chewing gum base to become sticky. In such embodiments,<br>
the chewing gum base has reduced stickiness in the presence of the non-stick inducing<br>
component as compared to in the absence of the non-stick inducing component.<br>
In additional embodiments, the methods of making a chewing gum base include<br>
processing an elastomer for use in a gum base without substantially changing the Tg of the<br>
gum base as measured by DSC by mixing at least one elastomer and at least one fat or oil.<br>
Moreover, in further embodiments, the methods of making a chewing gum base<br>
include providing a solid elastomer composition suitable for use in a chewing gum base and<br>
combining with the solid elastomer composition a non-stick inducing component that<br>
includes at least one fat or oil having an HLB range of about 3.5 to about 13. In such<br>
methods, non-stick inducing component is present in amounts sufficient to permit processing<br>
of the solid elastomer composition into a softened, processable mass.<br>
38<br>
 <br>
In some embodiments, the above-described methods of making a chewing gum base<br>
may be carried out in the presence of lower than conventional amounts of elastomer solvent.<br>
In such embodiments, the elastomer solvent includes a maximum of about 5.0% of the gum<br>
base. Desirably, an elastomer solvent can be mixed with an elastomer and non-stick inducing<br>
component to soften the elastomer without causing the resultant chewing gum base to<br>
become sticky.<br>
In other embodiments, the above-described methods of making a chewing gum base<br>
are carried out in the absence of added elastomer solvent.<br>
The manner in which the gum base components are mixed is not critical and such<br>
mixing is performed using standard apparatuses known to those skilled in the art. In a typical<br>
method, at least one elastomer is admixed with at least one mastication processing aid, which<br>
for purposes of the invention includes one or more non-stick inducing components and<br>
agitated for a period of from 1 to 30 minutes. The remaining ingredients, such as the texture-<br>
modifier and/or softener are then admixed, either in bulk or incrementally, while the gum<br>
base mixture is blended again for 1 to 30 minutes.<br>
The features and advantages of the present invention are more fully shown by the<br>
following examples which are provided for purposes of illustration, and are not to be<br>
construed as limiting the invention in any way.<br>

Gum bases are prepared as set forth in Tables 1-2 above. In particular, inventive gum<br>
base compositions A-I are prepared as follows:<br>
A Master Batch (masticated elastomer) was prepared in the following manner:<br>
40<br>
 <br>
Elastomer (1250 grams) was put in 3000 ml kettle heated to 128Â°C and was mixed for<br>
15 minutes. Hydrogenated cottonseed oil with a melting point of about 70Â°C (1250 grams)<br>
was added over a 90 minute period. Glycerol monohydrate (500 grams) was added over a<br>
period of 15 minutes. The batch was mixed for another 20 minutes to fully homogenize.<br>
Gum Base<br>
Gum base was then prepared from the Master Batch. Polyvinyl acetate (1200 grams)<br>
was added in the 3000 ml kettle heated to 128Â°C and was mixed for 15 minutes. Master<br>
Batch (720 grams) prepared as previously described was added and mixed for 10 minutes.<br>
Hydrogenated cottonseed oil with a melting point of about 40Â°C (283 grams) was added and<br>
mixed for 10 minutes. Triacetin (197 grams) was added and mixed for 10 minutes. Talc<br>
(600 grams) was added and mixed for 20 minutes to obtain a homogeneous mixture.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Inventive chewing gum compositions using the inventive gum base compositions A-I<br>
were chewed for 30 minutes and the cuds deposited on a concrete brick inside sample holders<br>
made out of 1.25 cm diameter PVC pipe. FIGS. 1A and IB are photographs that illustrate<br>
how gum samples were applied to a brick and subjected to an adhesion test as described<br>
herein. The cuds were compressed to imbed them in the concrete. The brick with the<br>
imbedded cuds was conditioned for 72 hours at room temperature. Instron Corporation<br>
(Norwood, MA) universal material testing machine was used to measure the force required to<br>
remove the cuds from the concrete surface. When the sample was completely removed off the<br>
surface of the concrete the reading was a true measurement of adhesion. Reliable adhesion<br>
reading could not be obtained for the tested commercial samples since they broke apart<br>
(cohesive failure) during testing. The adhesion reading for those samples was assumed to be<br>
higher than the obtained reading for cohesive failure. Higher adhesion readings at room<br>
temperature are indicative of greater stickiness of the gum.<br>
41<br>
 <br>
The inventive chewing gum bases contained a high melting point fat (i.e.,<br>
hydrogenated cottonseed oil having a melting temperature of about 70 Â° C) and a low melting<br>
point fat (i.e., hydrogenated cottonseed oil having a melting point of about<br>
40 Â° C).<br>
Moreover, two commercially available chewing gum products, one sold under the<br>
trademark Freedent Peppermint by William Wrigley Jr., Company and the other sold under<br>
the trademark Orbit by William Wrigley, Jr., Company, also were deposited in a V2" PVC<br>
pipe and applied onto the brick in the same manner used with respect to inventive chewing<br>
gum bases A-I. The Freedent product is sold as a product that "Won't stick to most dental<br>
workâ„¢".<br>
The maximum breaking force of each of the samples was measured using an Instron<br>
testing machine. The testing was done at room temperature at a speed of 1 inch/minute. The<br>
results are set forth in Table 3 below.<br>

 <br>
Furthermore, a photograph of any cud residue remaining on the brick after the<br>
application of removal force to each of the samples is shown in FIGS. 2-13. In particular,<br>
Figure 2 is a photograph of any cud remaining on the brick after the application of a removal<br>
force to Inventive Gum Sample A. Figure 3 is a photograph of any cud remaining on the<br>
brick after the application of a removal force to Inventive Gum Sample B. Figure 4 is a<br>
photograph of any cud remaining on the brick after the application of a removal force to<br>
Inventive Gum Sample C. Figure 5 is a photograph of any cud remaining on the brick after<br>
the application of a removal force to Inventive Gum Sample D. Figure 6 is a photograph of<br>
any cud remaining on the brick after the application of a removal force to Inventive Gum<br>
Sample E. Figure 7 is a photograph of any cud remaining on the brick after the application of<br>
a removal force to Inventive Gum Sample F. Figure 8 is a photograph of any cud remaining<br>
on the brick after the application of a removal force to Inventive Gum Sample G. Figure 9 is<br>
a photograph of any cud remaining on the brick after the application of a removal force to<br>
Inventive Gum Sample H. Figure 10 is a photograph of any cud remaining on the brick after<br>
the application of a removal force to Inventive Gum Sample I. Figure 11 is a photograph of<br>
any cud remaining on the brick after the application of a removal force to an Inventive Gum<br>
Sample J. Figure 12 is a photograph of any cud remaining on the brick after the application<br>
of a removal force to the Freedent Gum Sample. Figure 13 is a photograph of any cud<br>
remaining on the brick after the application of removal force to the Orbit Gum Sample.<br>
As is apparent from Table 3 above and the photographs attached as FIGS. 2-11,<br>
chewing gums made from inventive chewing gum base compositions all could be completely<br>
or substantially removed from the brick. The Freedent Peppermint and Orbit samples broke<br>
apart cohesively and were not able to be removed from the brick surface as seen in Figures 12<br>
and 13.<br>

The glass transitions of butyl rubber (BR) and styrene rubber (SBR) gum base<br>
samples were determined using modulated differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).<br>
Additionally, the glass transitions (Tg) of gum base samples AA-DD having the components<br>
set forth in Table 8 below were determined using DSC. In particular, all of the samples were<br>
heated under nitrogen purge from -100 Â°C to 200 Â°C at 3 Â°C per minute. The instrument used<br>
to measure the glass transition was a TA Instrument 2920 MDSC. Additionally, the melt<br>
endotherms for each of the samples were determined using modulated differential<br>
calorimetry.<br>

Comparative Master Batch Gum Base composition AA was prepared by masticating<br>
butyl rubber with resin while Inventive Master Batch Gum Base composition BB was<br>
prepared by masticating butyl rubber with a fat. Moreover, Comparative Master Batch Gum<br>
Base CC composition was prepared by masticating styrene butadiene rubber with resin, while<br>
Inventive Master Batch Gum Base DD composition was prepared by masticating styrene<br>
butadiene with fat. Although a master batch process was used to make the gum base, other<br>
processes such as a one-step, continuous kettle process or continuous extrusion process may<br>
be used.<br>
The glass transitions of each of the samples are set forth in Table 9 below.<br>

As is apparent from Table 9, the Tg of the inventive Master Batch Composition BB<br>
gum base containing butyl rubber masticated with fat was the same as the Tg of the sample<br>
containing only butyl rubber. Moreover, as is further apparent from Table 9 above, the Tg of<br>
the inventive gum base Master Batch DD containing styrene butadiene rubber masticated<br>
with fat was only one degree different (greater) than the Tg of SBR rubber alone.<br>
Accordingly, the Tg of the inventive Master Batch gum base compositions BB and DD did<br>
not change or substantially change upon mastication with a fat as compared to the elastomer<br>
alone . In contrast, as is further apparent from the Comparative AA and CC compositions in<br>
Table 9 above, mastication with a resin, i.e., a solvent plasticizer traditionally used for rubber<br>
mastication, increased the Tg of butyl rubber by at least five degrees (5 Â°)C and increased the<br>
Tg of styrene butadiene styrene rubber by at least twenty five degrees (25 Â°)C.<br>
47<br>
 <br>
Furthermore, each of the Inventive Master Batch gum base samples BB and DD<br>
contained crystalline fat in a separate phase, as each of those samples exhibited a melt<br>
endotherm at 62 Â°C. Accordingly, Inventive Master Batch gum bases BB and DD contain<br>
domains of crystalline fat in accordance with the present invention.<br>

Gum base was prepared using the above compositions and incorporated into the<br>
chewing gum composition of Table 7 to make chewing gum products. The resultant chewing<br>
gums were chewed for 30 minutes and the cuds were deposited on an asphalt parking lot.<br>
The cuds were further imbedded in the asphalt by a weighted object for about ten (10)<br>
seconds. Simultaneously commercially distributed gums (Freedent and Orbit from Wrigley's<br>
and Mintaburst from Cadbury Adams) were deposited and imbedded in the asphalt next to the<br>
inventive formulations in a similar fashion. After 24 hours more than 50 % of the inventive<br>
cuds were removed by pedestrian and automobile traffic. The remaining inventive cuds<br>
could easily be completely removed without leaving residue by scraping them with a spatula.<br>
Attempts to remove the cuds of the commercial gums required substantially more effort and<br>
resulted only in partial removal of the cud, i.e., the residues constituted about 10 to 30% of<br>
the original weight of the gum product and covered the original area of the cud.<br>

By way of background, when polarized light passes through a liquid or other uniform<br>
phase, a photograph of the liquid or other uniform phase will appear dark as there is no<br>
birefringence. However, when polarized light passes through a discontinuous phase<br>
containing a crystalline or other structure in a separate phase, a photograph of the<br>
discontinuous phase will appear as a bright image as a result of birefringence of the<br>
crystalline or other structure in a separate phase, i.e., as a result of the crystalline or other<br>
structure in the separate phase being illuminated by polarized light.<br>
As is apparent from FIGS. 14 and 15, the Master Batch gum base compositions not<br>
containing a non-stick inducing component of the present invention (i.e., gum bases EE and<br>
FF) were dark, indicating that the absence of a discontinuous phase. It should be noted that<br>
due to the presence of air bubbles, there are a few large bright spots. These are not<br>
attributable to the presence of separate domains, but are due to the refraction of light off the<br>
49<br>
 <br>
bubble. However, as is apparent from FIGS. 16-20, the photographs of the gum base Master<br>
Batch compositions containing at least one non-stick inducing component (i.e., inventive gum<br>
base Master Batches GG-KK) all show overall lighter images (light in color), indicating the<br>
presence of a discontinuous phase and evidencing crystallization of the non-stick inducing<br>
component (i.e. the fat or oil containing more than 12 carbon atoms) to form domains.<br>

Elastomer Solvents<br>
The following inventive gum base compositions were prepared. These compositions<br>
included a combination of the non-stick inducing components with conventional elastomer<br>
solvents (5%). These gum base compositions were incorporated into the chewing gum<br>
composition of Table 7. The chewing gums formed therefrom maintained reduced stickiness<br>
and non-stick properties even in the presence of a small amount of elastomer solvent.<br>

EXAMPLE 11<br>
A study was conducted to measure the molecular changes occurring in chewing gum<br>
when exposed to sunlight with and without the presence of photosensitizer. The molecular<br>
structure of the polymers (elastomers) is related to their physical properties. The adhesion is<br>
strongly affected by the molecular weight of the polymer. For instance, chewing gum<br>
compositions frequently use polysibutylene (PIB). When all other conditions are the same,<br>
the molecular mass of the polymer widely determines the adhesiveness of the polymer. Low<br>
molecular weight FDB adheres to most surfaces and poses a problem of handling the material<br>
50<br>
 <br>
because of its stickiness. On the other hand, high molecular weight PIB has been discovered<br>
to be not adhesive and exhibits a very weak tendency to cold flow. The adhesiveness of the<br>
polymers may be defined by their ability to form weak bonds with the adjacent surfaces. In<br>
order to form these weak bonds, the polymer has to come in close proximity to the adjacent<br>
surface. This may be achieved faster and easier by smaller molecules than the larger<br>
molecules. It has been discovered that a polymer of the same chemical composition may<br>
generally adhere more if it has relatively lower molecular weight.<br>
Light may induce changes in the elastomer polymers such as crosslinking,<br>
degradation and oxidation. This process occurs in the materials when exposed to the<br>
environment. However, the rate at which the photo-induced reactions are occurring is slow to<br>
have noticeable impact on the physical properties of the polymers. It has been discovered<br>
that photosensitizers such as chlorophyll, when added to compositions containing elastomers<br>
accelerate the photo-induced reactions significantly.<br>
Gum base compositions were made with three different types of elastomer, namely<br>
polyisbutylene (PIB), butyl rubber (BR), and styrene butadiene rubber (SBR). Each type of<br>
gum base composition (PIB, BR and SBR) was divided into two samples; to the first sample<br>
0.1% chlorophyll was added as a photosensitizer. The other was left as a control sample.<br>
These inventive gum base compositions are set forth in Table 14 below.<br>

Results<br>
The samples of BR and PEB without chlorophyll were easier to remove and left fewer<br>
residues than the samples of SBR without chlorophyll. The addition of chlorophyll hindered<br>
the removal of the PIB-containing samples, but improved the removal of the BR and SBR<br>
samples.<br>
Samples were then tested for molecular weight changes to the polymers. The results<br>
are shown in Tables 16-17 below. Additionally, Figures 21-23 show the results of adhesion<br>
tests on brick surfaces for the BR, PIB and SBR containing samples. The tests were<br>
conducted as previously discussed.<br>
Figure 21 shows the sample cuds of chewing gum made using PIB. The left side of<br>
the Figure shows gum containing chlorophyll. The right side of the Figure does not contain<br>
chlorophyll (control). As is apparent, both sides showed substantial removal from the brick,<br>
with minor residue.<br>
Figure 22 shows the sample cuds of chewing gum made using BR gum. The left side<br>
of this Figure contains chlorophyll and the right side of the Figure is the control with no<br>
52<br>
 <br>
chlorophyll. As is apparent, both sides showed substantial removal from the brick, with<br>
minor residue.<br>
Figure 23 shows the sample cuds of chewing gum made using SBR. The left side<br>
contains chlorophyll and the right side is the control with no chlorophyll. As is apparent, the<br>
left side which contained chlorophyll showed substantially less residue than the right side<br>
without chlorophyll.<br>
The sample containing PIB had a slight increase in both molecular weight and<br>
molecular number of PVAc when chlorophyll was added. There was another compound<br>
detected with solubility similar to PVAc. The PIB sample containing chlorophyll had<br>
reduced average molecular weight and lower molecular weight number after exposure to<br>
sunlight.<br>

Subsequent to exposure to sunlight, BR samples had a decrease in the average<br>
molecular weight and molecular weight number of the PVAc when chlorophyll was added.<br>
The chlorophyll had the opposite effect on the BR fraction, i.e. both molecular weight<br>
average and molecular number increased. The increase in the molecular number was more<br>
pronounced than the increase in the molecular number.<br>

Subsequent to exposure to sunlight, the SBR samples showed similar trend as the BR<br>
samples. There was decrease in the average molecular weight of the PVAc when chlorophyll<br>
was added. The molecular number of the PVA was higher when chlorophyll was added.<br>
Both the molecular weight average and the molecular number of the SBR increased.<br>

Free radicals generated by the chlorophyll may act in a different way depending on<br>
the system they are in. They may cause several reactions in the polymers, such as<br>
crosslinking, degradation and oxidation depending on the structure of the compounds they<br>
encounter. The level of the oxidation was not measured in this study, only crosslinking and<br>
degradation as witnessed by changes in the molecular weight was measured. The changes in<br>
the poly (vinyl acetate) (PVAc) were not expected to have significant impact on the gum<br>
stickiness. However, the changes in the molecular weight of the rubbers proved to have<br>
significant impact on the stickiness of the samples.<br>
54<br>
 <br>
Subsequent to exposure to sunlight, the PIB containing sample had slight increase in<br>
both molecular weight and molecular number of PVAc when chlorophyll was added,<br>
suggesting that the PVAc crossinked either with itself or with the PIB. The compound<br>
detected with solubility similar to PVAc may be this reaction product. The PIB had reduced<br>
average molecular weight and lower molecular weight number. This is consistent with<br>
reactions of degradation. One high molecular weight polymer molecule gives rise to several<br>
molecules with much lower molecular weight upon degradation. Low molecular weight PIB<br>
was quite sticky. The decrease in the molecular weight of the PIB resulted in the increase in<br>
the stickiness of the PIB samples.<br>
The higher increase in the molecular weight number as compared to increase in the<br>
average molecular weight of the BR samples could be explained by the lower amounts of low<br>
molecular weight polymer fraction as a result of crosslinking. Low molecular weight rubber<br>
was a bigger contributor to stickiness due to its higher mobility. The reduction in the lower<br>
molecular weight fraction and the increase of the average molecular weight of the rubber is<br>
believed to explain the observed reduction of gum stickiness.<br>
Subsequent to exposure to sunlight, the SBR samples showed a large increase in both<br>
the molecular weight number and the average molecular weight. This is believed to explain<br>
the largest decrease in the stickiness observed physically when chlorophyll was added.<br>
As seen from the above results, the chlorophyll addition reduced the adhesion of<br>
compositions containing unsaturated rubbers (BR and SBR) after exposure to sun light. This<br>
observation was confirmed by the increase in both the molecular weight and the molecular<br>
number of these rubbers.<br>
While there have been described what are presently believed to be the preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention, those skilled in the art will realize that changes and<br>
modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit of the invention, and it<br>
is intended to include all such changes and modifications as fall within the true scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
