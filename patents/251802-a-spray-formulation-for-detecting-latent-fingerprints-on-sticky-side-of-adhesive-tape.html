				<td>Field of the Invention:<br>
The invention relates to a spray formulation for detecting latent fingerprints on adhesive tapes.<br>
Background of the Invention;<br>
Latent fingerprints are one of the most commonly encountered physical evidence at the scene of crime. Development of the latent fingerprints depends upon many factors including type of the surface on which these are impinged. One of the surface on which it is difficult to develop latent fingerprints is the sticky side of adhesive tapes. The use of adhesive tapes has consistently risen over the past few years. These items are now commercially available in a number of hues, shades and textures.<br>
The conventional procedures for developing latent fingerprints involve the application of a suitable chemical that converts the colorless sweat deposition from the fingertips into a colored derivative, so that what is latent is rendered visible. In the present innovation, inventors have used Rose Bengal stain, in concert with a phase transfer catalyst to prepare a spray composition that can detect latent fingerprints on a wide range of adhesive tapes.<br>
Object of the Invention;<br>
The object of this invention is to develop a process for detecting latent fingerprints on adhesive tapes.<br>
Other object is to use a spray formulation for detecting latent finger prints on adhesive tapes.<br>
Another object is to use specific stain in concert with specific catalyst to detect latent fingerprints on a wide range of adhesive tapes.<br>
Yet another object is to use specific catalyst wherein the catalyst brings liaison between the stain and the fingerprint residue to bring out clear and sharp fingerprints.<br>
Other object is to develop clear and sharp fingerprints within 2-3 minutes.<br>
Another object is to develop a spray composition comprising a non-toxic stain and a phase transfer catalyst.<br>
Another object is to detect fingerprints on adhesive tapes that were earlier pasted on different objects.<br>
Statement of the Invention;<br>
According to this invention there is provided a spray formulation for detecting latent fingerprints on adhesive tapes comprising a nontoxic stain Rose Bengal or Palatine B having concentration of 1.0-1.2% and the phase transfer catalyst t-tetrabutylammonium iodide or t-tetrabutylammonium hydrogen caliphate having concentration of 0.35-0.40% and the process of preparation thereof comprising dissolving 1.0-1.2 gm of Rose Bengal in 100 ml distilled water, followed by addition of 0.35-0.4 gm of t-tetrabutylammonium iodide to a stirring mixture for 30-40 minutes, spraying the contents on adhesive tape bearing latent fingerprints, allowing the adhesive tape to stand under natural conditions for 1-1.5 minutes, washing the adhesive tape under running water for 30-40 seconds followed by photographing the developed fingerprints.<br>
Brief Description of the Invention;<br>
Here inventors have used t-tetrabutylammonium iodide as the phase transfer catalyst. The catalyst brings a liaison between the stain and the fingerprint residue. Clear and sharp fingerprints develop within 2-3 minutes on the following varieties of adhesive tapes.<br>
1.	Sello™tape<br>
2.	Brown packaging tape<br>
3.	Black electrical tape<br>
4.	Double side adhesive tape<br>
5.	Invisible tape<br>
6.	Decorative shining tape<br>
7.	Doctor's tape<br>
8.	Surgical tape<br>
9.	Currency tape<br>
Fingerprints were impinged on tape substrates and were developed on day 1, 2, 4, 6 and 11. The substrates were kept in ambient conditions. The environment was hot, dry and dusty. The temperature varied from 28-31 degree Celsius, while humidity ranged from 19-32 %.<br>
Fingerprints were also developed on adhesive tapes removed from different surfaces. After impinging latent fingerprints on Sello™ tape, the latter was pasted on to number of surfaces, such as air conditioner case, painted wall, rusted parts of an almirah, window pane, cardboard and fabric bag. Black electrical tape was rolled on electric wire, bakelite handle of a hand lens and a rubber pipe. One set of tapes were removed from the substrates just after affixing them while the other set of tapes were removed after 24 hours and prints were developed.<br>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of the fingerprint developing spray composition comprising:<br>
a.	Dissolving 1.0-1.2 gram of Rose Bengal in 100 ml distilled<br>
water.<br>
b.	Adding 0.35-0.40 gram of t-tetrabutylammonium iodide to a.<br>
c.	Stirring the mixture of step b for 30-40 minutes.<br>
d.	Spraying the contents prepared in step c on sample latent<br>
fingerprints impinged on adhesive tape.<br>
e.	Allowing the adhesive tape to stand under natural conditions<br>
for 1-1.5 minutes.<br>
f.	Washing the adhesive tape under running water for 30-40<br>
seconds.<br>
Yet another aspect of the invention relates to a method of photographing the developed fingerprints. Developed fingerprints were photographed both in macro and micro modes by using a digital camera (Canon digital Ixus 700). Photography was done in daylight. Photomicrography was done with zoom stereomicroscope (Olympus Inc.). All the photographs were stored in the .jpeg format.<br>
Still another aspect of the invention relates to a method of detecting latent fingerprints on adhesive tapes after removing the latter from different objects.<br>
Detailed description of the Invention;<br>
The invention relates to a fingerprint developing spray composition for detecting finger impressions on adhesive tapes. The fingerprint<br>
developing spray composition of the present invention is non-toxic, and develops sharp and clear fingerprints. The invention is able to detect fingerprints on a wide range of adhesive tapes.<br>
