				<td>Simple Pendulum Feed Dispenser<br>
The field of invention is pond aquaculture; the invented apparatus can be used by<br>
economically weaker section also. Its field extends to fish farming in all types of inland<br>
water body.<br>
Feed constitutes a major cost in aquaculture operations. Depending upon the culture<br>
system and species, the rate of feeding varies. Feeding trays, broadcasting feed<br>
manually and use of plastic bags for feeding purpose are common practices. All the<br>
above result in wastage of substantial amount of feed, which not only affects the cost<br>
benefit ratio but also creates environmental degradation of the ambient water.<br>
Object of invention is to minimize feed wastage and attaining a better feed conversion<br>
ratio (F.C.R.), which is of utmost importance from both environmental and economic<br>
point of view.<br>
To economize the use of fish feed a concept of an apparatus which can discharge an<br>
optimum amount of feed whenever a fish demands it, it was obvious that the equipment<br>
should consist of the following:-<br>
(i) a container to hold the fish feed<br>
(ii) a mechanism to release the fish feed as per demand<br>
(iii) an actuator to translate the demand of a fish to mechanical energy (force)<br>
(iv) to attract fish to the feeder<br>
(v) a frame work to hold the container and the releasing mechanism<br>
A Simple Pendulum Feed Dispenser, FIG. 1/5, consists of the following components:<br>
1. Cover/Lid,	2. Container,	3. Lug,	4. Legs,<br>
5. Fastener-ll ,	6. Neck,	7. Bottom plate,	8. Holding arms,<br>
9. Fastener-III,	10. Plummer blocks,	11. Cross rods,	12. Hinge pin,<br>
13. Hinge box,	14. Vertical rod,	15. Pendulum weight	16. Threaded socket nut,<br>
17. Fastener-IV, 18. Floats,	19. Extension rod,	20. Actuator,<br>
21. Fastener-I.<br><br>
The Simple Pendulum Feed Dispenser has been visualized and made to feed fish as<br>
per its' demand, and for economic use of fish feed. The operating theory of the<br>
apparatus is as follows:<br>
Fish feed is put inside the container and covered by the lid. In normal condition due to<br>
the pendulum weight the bottom plate stays horizontal and prevents the feed from<br>
falling freely in the water.<br>
Whenever fish strikes/pokes the actuator the bottom plate tilts. The bottom plate tilts<br>
both ways, i.e. about x-axis &amp; y-axis by virtue of the hinge and Plummer blocks. The<br>
gap generated in between the neck and bottom plate allows the feed to pour out. The<br>
bottom plate assumes its normal position whenever the external force applied by the<br>
fish is removed. The container is kept in vertical position either by fixing legs and floats<br>
to the lugs or by hanging it using the lugs (any other frame work as per user's choice).<br>

Detailed description of the preferred embodiments:<br>
The apparatus visualized and designed consists of the following parts:<br><br>
The purpose of the cover, item 1 of FIG. 1/5, is to protect fish feed (put in the container) from<br>
the environment (i.e., rain, dust, etc). It should fit snuggly over the rim of the container. Shape of<br>
the cover is slightly spherical (dome) with circular rim to sit over the container surface. Any<br>
water resistant material from powdered coated M.S. sheet to P.V.C. may be used, which will be<br>
governed by the purpose, function and shape.<br>
The purpose of the container, item 1 of FIG. 2/5, is to hold feed and preserve it for discharge as<br>
and when required. The function of the container is to hold fish feed of desired quantity. The<br>
container shape is cylindrical and symmetrical so that the weight of the feed should act vertically<br><br>
and along the axis. The conical bottom part is to facilitate the pouring out process of the fish<br>
feed. The conical part also helps to cut down the size of the bottom plate so that the quantity of<br>
fish feed pouring out of the container is limited. The size of the container may vary according to<br>
customer demand.<br>
The purpose of the lug, item 3 of FIG. 1/5, is to provide an extension of container from which the<br>
legs or a hanging attachment can be attached for supporting the apparatus. The function of the<br>
lug is to attach the holding parts to the container. The size of the lug depends on the part (leg)<br>
attached to it and also depends on the rigidity required.<br>
The purpose of the legs, item 2 of FIG. 4/5, is to connect the apparatus with the float. The<br>
function of the legs is to support the apparatus vertically on the pond water. The legs are<br>
fastened to equidistance lugs (4 nos.) by bolted fasteners. At the other end they are fixed with<br>
the floats. The shape or cross section of the legs is such that it should maintain its rigidity. It<br>
may be angular section, perpendicular section or tubular. At both end of the legs, plates are<br>
attached so that legs could be fastened to the container as well as to the floats. The length is<br>
enough to hold the end of vertical rod sufficiently above pond water.<br>
The purpose of the fastener-ll, item 5 of FIG. 1/5, is to temporarily join the neck with the<br>
container. The function of the fastener-ll is to hold the neck and other parts together. The<br>
fasteners should be strong enough to support the neck and the tilting mechanism with the<br>
actuator and should withstand externally applied forces arising out of its usage. The size of the<br>
bolted fasteners shall change according to the size of the apparatus. In the initial phases (while<br>
making the model) bolted fasteners with double nut have been used but in future, rivets or<br>
bolted fasteners with locking nuts (Nylock nuts) may be used as per requirement.<br>
The purpose of the neck, item 2 of FIG. 5/5, is to hold limited quantity of feed and discharge the<br>
feed as and when the bottom plate tilts and a gap is generated at its circumference. The neck<br>
holds the feed to be discharged; it is also attached to the main body of the container. The<br>
holding arms which support the Plummer blocks are also attached to the neck. The shape of the<br>
neck is a hollow cylinder; wall thick ness is enough so that it retains its shape and the holding<br>
arms fixed to it. The lower part of cylinder (opening) wall thickness shamphered so that the<br>
circular bottom plate can play both ways within the neck.<br><br>
The purpose of the bottom plate, item 3 of FIG. 4/5, is (a) to prevent fish feed from pouring out<br>
from the container in normal condition, and (b) when the bottom plate tilts to allow limited<br>
quantity of fish feed to pour out for feeding fish. The bottom plate stays horizontal in normal<br>
condition and when a force is applied on the actuator it tilts to allow feed to pass through the<br>
gap generated. The upper surface of the bottom plate is curved. It has the contour of a dome. It<br>
may be of solid construction or may be pressed out from a plate. It is threaded at the bottom so<br>
that the vertical rod can be attached to it. The material of the bottom plate may be steel, brass,<br>
white metal, or any synthetic nontoxic substance.<br>
The purpose of the holding arms, item 1 of FIG. 4/5, is to support the Plummer blocks. The<br>
function of the holding arms is to hold the Plummer blocks firmly with the help of fasteners. The<br>
other function is to maintain sufficient gap between the Plummer block centers so that the tilting<br>
mechanism along with the hinge box can operate property. The shape and size of the holding<br>
arms is such that they can support the Plummer blocks properly. A fixed center distance is<br>
maintained so that the tilting movement of the bottom plate is not hampered. The dimensions<br>
and length of the holding arms are such that it can support the tilting mechanism, along with<br>
hinge box, vertical rod, cross rod and actuator mechanism.<br>
The purpose of the fastener-Ill, item 9 of FIG. 1/5, is to temporarily join Plummer blocks firmly<br>
with the holding arms. The function of these fasteners is to hold Plummer blocks firmly with the<br>
holding arms. The size of the bolted fasteners shall change according to the size of the<br>
apparatus. In the initial phases (wtiile making the model) bolted fasteners with double nut have<br>
been used but in future, rivets or bolted fasteners with locking nuts (Nylock nuts) may be used<br>
as per requirement.<br>
The purpose of the Plummer blocks, item 3 of FIG. 3/5, is to allow the cross rod to rotate freely.<br>
The function of the Plummer block is to support the cross rod along with tilting mechanism and<br>
to act as bearings. The shape is functional and the size is according to the diameter of the cross<br>
rod. Any bearing material like brass, gun metal, Babbitt metal, Teflon or nylon can be used.<br>
The purpose of the cross rods, item 1 of FIG. 3/5, is to act as an extension of the hinge box in<br>
rotating. The cross rods are joined to the hinge box axially by welding. The hinge box along with<br><br>
the cross rods is supported by the Plummer blocks at both ends. The circular section cross rods<br>
rotates freely in the Plummer blocks and enable the vertical rod and the bottom plate to tilt.<br>
Cross rods are circular pins of suitable diameter strong enough to hold the mechanism.<br>
The purpose of the hinge pin, item 1 of FIG. 3/5, is to enable the vertical rod to tilt within the<br>
hinge box. The hinge pin, supported on both sides by hinge box wall holes which act as<br>
bearings, can rotate freely. The hinged pin is passed through a drilled hole in the vertical rod (or<br>
welded to it, if situation demands). When the external force (applied by the fish) acts, the hinge<br>
pin allows the vertical rod to tilt. To prevent axial movement of the hinge pin it is locked by<br>
wielding stoppers (washers) outside the hinge box. The hinge pin is of circular cross section and<br>
the size depends on the overall dimension of the apparatus as well as on its function.<br>
The purpose of the hinge box, item 1 of FIG. 3/5, is to hold the vertical rod and to facilitate the<br>
mechanism to tilt both ways. The function of the hinge box is to (a) support hinge pins, (b)<br>
support vertical rod, and (c) rotate along its axis. The hinge box is a fabricated rectangular box<br>
structure made of brass strip. The size of the hinge box depends on the allowable tilting of the<br>
bottom plate i.e. the rotation of the hinge pin along its axis and the centre distance of the<br>
Plummer blocks.<br>
The purpose of the vertical rod, item 4 of FIG. 3/5, is to link different parts of the mechanism.<br>
The vertical rod is threaded at the top to attach the bottom plate. The hinge pin is joined (by<br>
welding) at a predetermined length. The rod is attached with the pendulum weight and at the<br>
bottom to the actuator rod. The vertical rod along with the bottom plate tilts whenever a fish<br>
thrusts the actuator. The vertical rod is one of the main components of the apparatus. The rod is<br>
of circular cross section. The length of the rod is such that at the top end it is attached to the<br>
bottom plate and in the middle it is joined with hinge pin. It should also support the pendulum<br>
weight as well as be attached to the extension rod though socket nut.<br>
The purpose of the pendulum weight, item 2 of FIG. 3/5, is to govern the tilting movement of the<br>
vertical rod. The pendulum weight helps the vertical rod to assume its vertical position when<br>
stationary; and also helps it to come back to its normal position after tilting. The shape of the<br>
pendulum weight is cylindrical with a hole through it so that it can be attached to the vertical rod.<br>
The size of the pendulum weight depends upon the weight of the feed on the bottom plate, as<br>
well as the resistance of the water on the actuator.<br><br>
The purpose of the cylindrical socket nut, item 16 of FIG. 1/5, having internal thread is to join<br>
firmly the vertical rod with the extension rod. The shape and size of the nut is governed by the<br>
size of the vertical rod as well as the extension rod.<br>
The purpose of the fastener-IV, item 17 of FIG. 1/5, is to temporarily join the leg with the float.<br>
The function of the faster-lV is to prevent relative motion between neck and the float and also to<br>
attach total apparatus with the float. The size of the bolted fasteners shall change according to<br>
the size of the apparatus. In the initial phases (while making the model) bolted fasteners have<br>
been used but in future, rivets or bolted fasteners with locking nuts (Nylock nuts) may be used<br>
as per requirement.<br>
The purpose of the floats, item 18 of FIG. 1/5, is to support the apparatus vertically over the<br>
pond water. The shape and size of the float shall vary according to the weight of apparatus filled<br>
with fish feed. While making the working model 08" commercially available spherical floats have<br>
been used.<br>
The purpose of the extension rod, item 19 of FIG. 1/5, is to join the actuator with the vertical rod.<br>
The cross section of the extension and the length varies accordingly to the demand of the<br>
customer, i.e. it depends on the depth of the actuator underwater.<br>
The purpose of the actuator, item 20 of FIG. 1/5, is to attract fish. The function of the actuator is<br>
to (a) hold proper fish attractants, and (b) transmit the external force applied by the fish. The<br>
material of the actuator should be waterproof. The actuator is a hollow container with<br>
perforations. The material can either be stainless steel or transparent plastic (hard enough to<br>
retain its shape). It is attached to the actuator rod by wielding joint with the cap of the actuator.<br>
The purpose of fastener-l, item 21 of FIG. 1/5, is to temporarily join the leg with the container.<br>
The function of fastener-l is to prevent relative movement of container and the neck and hold<br>
them rigidly. The size of the bolted fasteners shall change according to the size of the<br>
apparatus. In the initial phases (while making the model) bolted fasteners with double nut have<br>
been used but in future, rivets or bolted fasteners with locking nuts (Nylock nuts) may be used<br>
as per requirement.<br><br>

The Simple Pendulum Feed Dispenser has been visualized and made to feed fish as<br>
per its' demand, and for economic use of fish feed. The operating theory of the<br>
apparatus is as follows:<br>
Fish feed is put inside the container and covered by the lid. In normal condition due to<br>
the pendulum weight the bottom plate stays horizontal and prevents the feed from<br>
falling freely in the water.<br>
Whenever fish strikes/pokes the actuator the bottom plate tilts. The bottom plate tilts<br>
both ways, i.e. about x-axis &amp; y-axis by virtue of the hinge and Plummer blocks. The<br>
gap generated in between the neck and bottom plate allows the feed to pour out. The<br>
bottom plate assumes its normal position whenever the external force applied by the<br>
fish is removed. The container is kept in vertical position either by fixing legs and floats<br>
to the lugs or by hanging it using the lugs (any other frame work as per user's choice).</td>
