HYDRAULIC FLUID<br>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic fluid. Background of the Invention<br>
WO 93/03121 relates to hydraulic fluids having improved wet filterability and having increased resistance to loss of zinc when the oil is exposed to water. These compositions comprise (A) a combination of a metal salt selected from the group consisting of sulfonates, phenates, carboxylates and mixtures thereof, (B) an aliphatic carboxylic acid or anhydride, or carboxylic acid group containing derivative thereof, wherein the aliphatic group contains at least 20 carbon atoms, and optionally (C) a metal salt of (C)(I) at least one organic phosphorus acid or mixture of (C)(I) at least one organic phosphorus acid and (C) (II) at least one carboxylic acid group, and optionally (D) triazole. In one embodiment, the carboxylic acids of (A) are aromatic carboxylic acids. Zinc, calcium and magnesium salts of these aromatic carboxylic acids, and especially salicylic acids, are preferred. Although magnesium salicylate and zinc dithiophosphate are both mentioned per se, there is no teaching to use the combination of these compounds.<br>
WO 89/04358 relates to compositions comprising (A) a neutral or basic metal salt of an acidic organic compound, (B) a metal deactivator, preferably an optionally substituted benzotriazole, and (C) a sulfur and/or phosphorus-containing compound selected from the group consisting of (C-1) phosphorus-containing amide, (C-2) phosphorus-containing ester, (C-3) sulfur-coupled<br><br>
dithiocarbamate/ (C-4) sulfur-containing compound according to formula (I). Particularly preferred metals for the salts (A) are sodium, magnesium, calcium or mixtures of two or more thereof. In the extensive list of additional compounds which can be present, zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate is mentioned. Although magnesium salicylate and zinc dithiophosphate are both mentioned per se, there is no teaching to use the combination of these compounds -<br>
EP-A-604 218 describes functional fluids comprising a major amount of an oil of lubricating viscosity, at least one metal salt of thiophosphoric acid, a zinc salt of salicylic acid, and a rust inhibitor, which fluid contains less than about 1 %wt of dispersant and less than about 1 %wt of basic sulfonate salt. The thiophosphoric acid is most commonly a dihydrocarbyl dithiophosphoric acid; the metal is most preferably zinc. The teaching of the document is restricted to the use of zinc salicylate.<br>
In US-A-4,627,928, a process has been described, for preparing basic magnesium salicylates which can be characterised as having a magnesium content of at least 150% up to 500%, of the stoichiometrically equivalent amount of magnesium based on the amount of total acid present.  The magnesium salts obtained are described to be suitable for use as additives in general, more specifically as additives for a variety of lubricating oils and fuels, e.g, gasoline and diesel fuels. It is mentioned that these specific magnesium salicylates can be used in combination with a wide range of other compounds.  There is no disclosure or teaching to apply a combination of zinc dithiophosphate and magnesium salicylate in a hydraulic fluid.<br><br>
Hydraulic fluids need to meet special requirements as they both lubricate and transmit pressure. In order to meet these requirements, hydraulic fluids contain additives. Generally, hydraulic fluids contain antiwear/extreme pressure additives. The conditions for a hydraulic fluid are especially difficult in vane pumps where the vane tips slide against the casing at high speed under heavy load and at high temperature. Further, the increasingly high operating temperatures of modern hydraulic equipment requires the fluid to be thermally stable to avoid the formation of deposits and sludge and to resist the corrosion of both ferrous and non-ferrous metals. The requirement of good thermal stability in hydraulic fluids containing an anti-wear additive, means that these additives are often used in combination with detergents. However, the calcium salts of alkylbenzene sulphonateS/ alkyl-naphthalene sulphonates, petroleum sulphonates, alkylphenates, alkyl sulphurized phenates or alkylsalicylates which are usually applied, give, increased wear. The increased wear is especially mairked in vane pumps, more specifically under low load conditions- Low load conditions occur in practice when the pump, is idle.<br>
WO-A-97/10318 describes lubricants with improved acid neutralisation properties and excellent sludge' and wear performance in the Seq. BE test,  said lubricants are formed using a detergent system comprising one or more alkali or alkaline earth metal salts of an oil soluble organic acid selected from the group consisting of sulfonic acids, phenols, sulfurised phenols and<br><br>
carboxylic acids (including salicylate acids) wherein at least one metal salt, is overbased and the ratio of inorganic to organic salt present in the detergent system expressed as TBN from inorganic salts (the overbasing) to the total molea of organic salt is at least 2500.<br>
US-A-5 558 802 describes multigrade crankcase lubricants that have, good low temperature pumpability and low volatility.<br>
US-A-5 558 8 02 states that neutral and overbased<br>
calcium' salts of organic acids have been found to<br>
■<br>
increase low-temperature high shear viscosity when measured in a cold cranking simulator (CCS).<br>
In order to produce lubricants with low CCS viscosities under high shear rates (i.e. to allow the engine to crank more easily at lower temperatures and thus improve engine staftability at those ambient temperatures), it is said in  US-A-5 558 802 that these salts should be avoided altogether or used at a level not exceeding 0.0007 moles of calcium salt per 100 grams of lubricant.<br>
WO-A-96/37582 describes lubricating oil compositions for internal-combustion engines; automatic transmission gearboxes, dampers, power steering units and the like.<br>
Lubricating oils of described in WO-A-96/37582 comprise sulfoxymolybdenum dithiocarbamate having a specific alkyl group, zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate having a specific alkyl group, specific alkylsalicylate(s), and, if desired, succinimide<br><br>
containing boron, each in a predetermined amount intra lubricating oil base stock.<br>
US-A-446291B describes a lubricating oil composition comprising a major proportion of a lubricating oil and a minor proportion of each of a Group II metal dithiophosphate and a composition having the formula:<br>
R2O.C0,CR2(NR3R4) .CR6R7.CO.OR5, where R1 , R2, R3, R4,<br>
R5, R6 and R7are hydrogen or a hydrocarbon radical<br>
containing 1-30 carbon atoms, and wherein R or R are independently selected from hydrogen, hydrocarbon containing from 1 to 3 0 carbon atoms, and acyl containing from 1 to 30 carbon.<br>
finmmary of the Invention<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that hydraulic fluid containing a combination of magnesium salicylate and zinc dithiophosphate, gives improved performance at low load compared with a combination containing calcium salicylate. Additionally, it was found that this combination also provides greater thermal stability. Less sludge and deposits are formed when subjecting the hydraulic fluid of the present invention to the Cincinnati Milacron Thermal stability Test-<br>
The present invention provides a hydraulic fluid comprising a lubricant base oil in combination with (a) from 0.0 01 to 5 %wt of magnesium salicylate, (b)  from 0.01 to 8 %wt of zinc dithiophosphate, which amounts are based on total weight of hydraulic fluid.<br><br>
Detailed description of the Invention<br>
The magnesium salicylate for use in the present invention can be either neutral or overbased.  The expression "overbased" is equivalent to "basic", "superbased", "hyperbased" and '*high-metal containing salts". These magnesium salicylates contain an excess metal content compared to the amount of metal which would be present according to the scoichiometry of the metal and the salicylic acid reacted with the metal. Processes for making such neutral and basic metal salts are well known in the art. Neutral salts can be made by heating a mineral oil solution of an acidic organic compound with a stoichiometric equivalent amount of a metal neutralizing agent such as the metal oxide, hydroxide, carbonate, bicarbonate, or sulfide at a<br>
temperature above 50 °C and filtering the resulting mass. Basic salts are made similarly with the exception that a stoichiometric excess of the metal is used.<br>

The total base number is preferably at least 100 mg KOH/g, more preferably at least 2 00 mg KOH/g, most preferably at least 300 mg KOH/g. The total base number is preferably at most 6 00 mg KOH/g-  Another method of characterising overbased magnesium salicylates is by the magnesium content relative to the stoichiometrically equivalent amount of magnesium based on the amount of total acid present.  Overbased magnesium salicyclates for use in the present invention preferably have a magnesium content of more than 50 0% of<br><br>
the stoichiometrically equivalent amount of magnesium based on the amount of total acid present, more preferably at least 550%-<br>

These compounds were added to a lubricant base oil containing less than 1.0 % by weight of aromatic compounds, less than 0.05 %wt of sulphur, calculated as elemental sulphur and having a kinematic viscosity in the range of 32 cSt (at 40 °) (ISO viscosity grade 32) .<br><br>
The compositions obtained are described in Table 1. The amounta are of the compounds per se, excluding the mineral oil.<br>
Compositions 1 and 2 were used in Vickera V104C vane pump tests. A new pump cartridge was used for each test. The test duration was 250 hours, performed at a fluid<br>
temperature of about S6 °C, at a fluid outlet pressure of 35 bar (3.5 MPa) and at a pump speed of 1450 revolutions per minute. The results are described in Table 1.<br>
