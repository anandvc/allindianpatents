DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0025] In the following detailed description, reference is<br>
made to the accompanying drawing figures which form a part hereof,<br>
and which show by way of illustration specific embodiments of the<br>
invention. It is to be understood by those of ordinary skill in<br>
this technological field that other embodiments may be utilized,<br>
and structural, electrical, as well as procedural changes may be<br>
made without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used<br>
throughout the drawings to refer to the same or similar parts.<br>
[0026] First of all, mobile terminals described in this<br>
disclosure can include a mobile phone, a smart phone, a laptop<br>
computer, a digital broadcast terminal, a PDA (personal digital<br>
assistants), a PMP (portable multimedia player), a navigation<br>
system and the like. The configurations according to an<br>
embodiment described in this disclosure may also be applied to a<br>
stationary terminal such as a digital TV, a desktop computer and<br>
the like.<br>
[0027] FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a mobile terminal 100<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention. Referring<br>
to FIG. 1, the mobile terminal 100 includes a wireless<br>
communication unit 110, an A/V (audio/video) input unit 120, a<br>
user input unit 130, a sensing unit 140, an output unit 150, a<br>
memory 160, an interface unit 170, a controller 180, a power<br>
supply 190 and the like. FIG. 1 shows the mobile terminal 100<br>
having various components, but it is understood that implementing<br>
all of the illustrated components is not a requirement. Greater<br>
or fewer components may alternatively be implemented.<br>
[0028] The wireless communication unit 110 includes one or<br>
more components which permits wireless communication between the<br>
mobile terminal 100 and a wireless communication system or<br>
network within which the mobile terminal 100 is located. For<br>
instance, and as shown in FIG. 1, the wireless communication unit<br>
110 can include a broadcast receiving module 111, a mobile<br>
communication module 112, a wireless Internet module 113, a<br>
short-range communication module 114, a position-location module<br>
115 and the like.<br>
[0029] The broadcast receiving module 111 receives a<br>
broadcast signal and/or broadcast associated information from an<br>
external broadcast managing server via a broadcast channel. The<br>
broadcast channel may include a satellite channel and a<br>
terrestrial channel. Further, the broadcast managing server<br>
generally refers to a server which generates and transmits a<br>
broadcast signal and/or broadcast associated information or a<br>
server which is provided with a previously generated broadcast<br>
signal and/or broadcast associated information and then transmits<br>
the provided signal or information to a terminal. The broadcast<br>
signal may also be implemented as a TV broadcast signal, a radio<br>
broadcast signal, and a data broadcast signal, among others. The<br>
broadcast signal may further include a broadcast signal combined<br>
with a TV or radio broadcast signal.<br>
[0030] The broadcast associated information includes<br>
information associated with a broadcast channel, a broadcast<br>
program, a broadcast service provider, etc. In addition, the<br>
broadcast associated information can be provided via a mobile<br>
communication network, and in this instance, the broadcast<br>
associated information can be received by the mobile<br>
communication module 112.<br>
[0031] Further, the broadcast associated information can be<br>
implemented in various forms. For instance, broadcast associated<br>
information may include an electronic program guide (EPG) of the<br>
digital multimedia broadcasting (DMB) system and electronic<br>
service guide (ESG) of the digital video broadcast-handheld (DVB-<br>
PI) system.<br>
[0032] The broadcast receiving module 111 may also be<br>
configured to receive broadcast signals transmitted from various<br>
types of broadcast systems. In a non-limiting example, such<br>
broadcasting systems include the digital multimedia broadcasting-<br>
terrestrial (DMB-T) system, the digital multimedia broadcasting-<br>
satellite (DMB-S) system, the digital video broadcast-handheld<br>
(DVB-H) system, the data broadcasting system known as media<br>
forward link only (MediaFLO®) and the integrated services digital<br>
broadcast-terrestrial (ISDB-T) system. The broadcast receiving<br>
module 111 can also be configured suitable for other broadcasting<br>
systems as well as the above-explained digital broadcasting<br>
systems. Further, the broadcast signal and/or broadcast<br>
associated information received by the broadcast receiving module<br>
111 may be stored in a suitable device, such as the memory 160.<br>
[0033] In addition, the mobile communication module 112<br>
transmits/receives wireless signals to/from one or more network<br>
entities (e.g., base station, external terminal, server, etc.).<br>
Such wireless signals may represent audio, video, and data<br>
according to text/multimedia message transmission/receptions,<br>
among others. Further, the wireless Internet module 113 supports<br>
Internet access for the mobile terminal 100, and may be<br>
internally or externally coupled to the mobile terminal 100. In<br>
this instance, the wireless Internet technology can include WLAN<br>
(Wireless LAN) (Wi-Fi), Wibro (Wireless broadband), Wimax (World<br>
Interoperability for Microwave Access), HSDPA (High Speed<br>
Downlink Packet Access), etc.<br>
[0034] Further, the short-range communication module 114<br>
facilitates relatively short-range communications. Suitable<br>
technologies for implementing this module include radio frequency<br>
identification (RFID), infrared data association (IrDA), ultra-<br>
wideband (UW3) , as well at the networking technologies commonly<br>
referred to as Bluetooth and ZigBee, to name a few. In addition,<br>
the position-location module 115 identifies or otherwise obtains<br>
the location of the mobile terminal 100, and may be implemented<br>
with a global positioning system (GPS) module.<br>
[0035] Referring to FIG. 1, the audio/video (A/V) input unit<br>
120 is configured to provide audio or video signal input to the<br>
mobile terminal 100. As shown, the A/V input unit 120 includes a<br>
camera 121 and a microphone 122. The camera 121 receives and<br>
processes image frames of still pictures or video, which are<br>
obtained by an image sensor in a video call mode or a<br>
photographing mode. The processed image frames can then be<br>
displayed on the display 151.<br>
[0036] Further, the image frames processed by the camera 121<br>
can be stored in the memory 160 or can be externally transmitted<br>
via the wireless communication unit 110. Optionally, at least two<br>
cameras 121 can be provided to the mobile terminal 100. In<br>
addition, the microphone 122 receives an external audio signal<br>
while the mobile terminal or portable device is in a particular<br>
mode, such as phone call mode, recording mode and voice<br>
recognition. The audio signal is processed and converted into<br>
electric audio data, and the processed audio data is transformed<br>
into a format transmittable to a mobile communication base<br>
station via the mobile communication module 112 for a call mode.<br>
The microphone 122 also can include assorted noise removing<br>
algorithms to remove noise generated in the course of receiving<br>
the external audio signal.<br>
[0037] In addition, the user input unit 130 generates input<br>
data responsive to user manipulation of an associated input<br>
device or devices. Examples of such devices include a keypad, a<br>
dome switch, a touchpad (e.g., static pressure/capacitance), a<br>
jog wheel, a jog switch, etc. Further, the sensing unit 140<br>
provides sensing signals for controlling operations of the mobile<br>
terminal 100 using status measurements of various aspects of the<br>
mobile terminal 100. For instance, the sensing unit 140 can<br>
detect an open/close status of the mobile terminal 100, relative<br>
positioning of components (e.g., a display and keypad) of the<br>
mobile terminal 100, a change of position of the mobile terminal<br>
100 or a component of the mobile terminal 100, a presence or<br>
absence of user contact with the mobile terminal 100, an<br>
orientation or acceleration/deceleration of the mobile terminal<br>
100.<br>
[0038] As an example, consider the mobile terminal 100 being<br>
configured as a slide-type mobile terminal. In this configuration,<br>
the sensing unit 14 0 can sense whether a sliding portion of the<br>
mobile terminal 100 is opened or closed. Other examples include<br>
the sensing unit 140 sensing the presence or absence of power<br>
provided by the power supply 190, the presence or absence of a<br>
coupling or other connection between the interface unit 170 and<br>
an external device. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the<br>
sensing unit 140 also includes a proximity sensor 141.<br>
[0039] Further, the output unit 150 generates outputs<br>
relevant to the senses of sight, hearing, touch and the like. In<br>
FIG. 1, the output unit 150 includes the display 151, an audio<br>
output module 152, an alarm unit 153, a haptic module 154 and the<br>
like. In more detail, the display 151 visually displays (outputs)<br>
information associated with the mobile terminal 100. For<br>
instance, if the mobile terminal is operating in a phone call<br>
mode, the display can provide a user interface (UI) or graphical<br>
user interface (GUI) which includes information associated with<br>
placing, conducting, and terminating a phone call. As another<br>
example, if the mobile terminal 100 is in a video call mode or a<br>
photographing mode, the display 151 can additionally or<br>
alternatively display images which are associated with these<br>
modes, the "JI or the GUI.<br>
[0040] In addition, the display 151 can be implemented using<br>
display technologies including, for example, a liquid crystal<br>
display (LCD), a thin film transistor-liquid crystal display<br>
(TFT-LCD), an organic light-emitting diode display (OLED) , a<br>
flexible display and a three-dimensional display. The mobile<br>
terminal 100 may also include one or more of such displays. Some<br>
of the above displays can also be implemented in a transparent or<br>
optical transmittive type, which is called a transparent display.<br>
A TOLED (transparent OLED) or the like is a representative<br>
example for the transparent display. A rear configuration of the<br>
display 151 can also be implemented in the optical transmittive<br>
type as well. In this configuration, a user can see an object in<br>
rear of a terminal body via the area occupied by the display 151<br>
of the terminal body.<br>
[0041] At least two displays 151 can also be provided to the<br>
mobile terminal 100 in accordance with the implemented<br>
configuration of the mobile terminal 100. For instance, a<br>
plurality of displays can be arranged on a single face of the<br>
mobile terminal 100 in a manner of being spaced apart from each<br>
other or being built in one body. Alternatively, a plurality of<br>
displays can be arranged on different faces of the mobile<br>
terminal 100.<br>
[0042] In addition, when the display 151 and a sensor for<br>
detecting a touch action (hereinafter called xtouch sensor')<br>
configures a mutual layered structure (hereinafter called<br>
'touchscreen'), the display 151 can be used as an input device as<br>
well as an output device. In this instance, the touch sensor can<br>
be configured as a touch film, a touch sheet, a touchpad or the<br>
like. Further, the touch sensor can be configured to convert a<br>
pressure applied to a specific portion of the display 151 or a<br>
variation of a capacitance generated from a specific portion of<br>
the display 151 to an electric input signal. Moreover, the touch<br>
sensor can detect a pressure of a touch as well as a touched<br>
position or size.<br>
[0043] Further, if a touch input is made to the touch sensor,<br>
signal(s) corresponding to the touch is transferred to a touch<br>
controller. The touch controller then processes the signal(s) and<br>
transfers the processed signal (s) to the controller 180.<br>
Therefore, the controller 180 can determine or know whether a<br>
prescribed portion of the display 151 is touched.<br>
[0044] Referring again to FIG. 1, the proximity sensor 141<br>
can be provided to an internal area of the mobile terminal 100<br>
enclosed by the touchscreen or around the touchscreen. The<br>
proximity sensor 141 is also a sensor that detects a presence or<br>
non-presence of an object approaching a prescribed detecting<br>
surface or an object existing around the proximity sensor 141<br>
using an electromagnetic field strength or infrared ray without<br>
mechanical contact. Hence, the proximity sensor 141 has a<br>
durability longer than that of a contact type sensor and also has<br>
a utility wider than that of the contact type sensor.<br>
[0045] Further, the proximity sensor 141 can include one of a<br>
transmittive photoelectric sensor, a direct reflective<br>
photoelectric sensor, a mirror reflective photoelectric sensor, a<br>
radio frequency oscillation proximity sensor, an electrostatic<br>
capacity proximity sensor, a magnetic proximity sensor, an<br>
infrared proximity sensor and the like. When the touchscreen<br>
includes the electrostatic capacity proximity sensor, the sensor<br>
can detect the proximity of a pointer using a variation of<br>
electric field according to the proximity of the pointer. In this<br>
instance, the touchscreen (touch sensor) can be classified as the<br>
proximity sensor.<br>
[0046] In the following description, for clarity, an action<br>
that a pointer approaches without contacting with the touchscreen<br>
to be recognized as located on the touchscreen is named a<br>
'proximity touch/ . Also, an action that a pointer actually<br>
touches the touchscreen is named 'contact touch' . The meaning of<br>
the position on the touchscreen proximity-touched by the pointer<br>
means the position of the pointer which vertically opposes the<br>
touchscreen when the pointer performs the proximity touch.<br>
[0047] The proximity sensor 141 also detects a proximity<br>
touch and a proximity touch pattern (e.g., a proximity touch<br>
distance, a proximity touch duration, a proximity touch position,<br>
a proximity touch shift state, etc.). Information corresponding<br>
to the detected proximity touch action and the detected proximity<br>
touch pattern can also be output to the touchscreen.<br>
[0048] In addition, the audio output module 152 functions in<br>
various modes including a call-receiving mode, a call-placing<br>
mode, a recording mode, a voice recognition mode, a broadcast<br>
reception mode and the like to output audio data which is<br>
received from the wireless communication unit 110 or is stored in<br>
the memory 160. During operation, the audio output module 152<br>
outputs audio relating to a particular function (e.g., call<br>
received, message received, etc.). The audio output module 152 is<br>
often implemented using one or more speakers, buzzers, other<br>
audio producing devices, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0049] Further, the alarm unit: 153 can output a signal for<br>
announcing the occurrence of a particular event associated with<br>
the mobile terminal 100. Typical events include a call received<br>
event, a message received event and a touch input received event.<br>
The alarm unit 153 can also output a signal for announcing the<br>
event occurrence using vibration as well as video or audio signal<br>
The video or audio signal can also be output via the display 151<br>
or the audio output unit 152. Hence, the display 151 or the audio<br>
output module 152 can be regarded as a part of the alarm unit 153<br>
[0050] In addition, the haptic module 154 generates various<br>
tactile effects that can be sensed by a user. Vibration is a<br>
representative one of the tactile effects generated by the haptic<br>
module 154. A strength and pattern of the vibration generated by<br>
the haptic module 154 can also be controlled. For instance,<br>
different vibrations can be output in a manner of being<br>
synthesized together or can be output in sequence.<br>
[0051] The haptic module 154 can also generate various<br>
tactile effects as well as vibration. For instance, the haptic<br>
module 154 generates the effect attributed to the arrangement of<br>
pins vertically moving against a contact skin surface, the effect<br>
attributed to the injection/suction power of air though an<br>
injection/suction hole, the effect attributed to the skim over a<br>
skin surface, the effect attributed to the contact with electrode,<br>
the effect attributed to the electrostatic force, the effect<br>
attributed to the representation of hold/cold sense using an<br>
endothermic or exothermic device and the like.<br>
[0052] The haptic module 154 can also be implemented to<br>
enable a user to sense the tactile effect through a muscle sense<br>
of finger, arm or the like as well as to transfer the tactile<br>
effect through a direct contact. Optionally, at least two haptic<br>
modules 154 can be provided to the mobile terminal 100 in<br>
accordance with the corresponding configuration type of the<br>
mobile terminal 100.<br>
[0053] Further, the memory 160 can store various types of<br>
data to support the processing, control, and storage requirements<br>
of the mobile terminal 100. Examples of such data include<br>
program instructions for applications operating on the mobile<br>
terminal 100, contact data, phonebook data, messages, audio,<br>
still pictures, moving pictures, etc. In addition, a recent use<br>
history or a cumulative use frequency of each data (e.g., use<br>
frequency for each phonebook, each message or each multimedia)<br>
can be stored in the memory 160. Moreover, data for various<br>
patterns of vibration and/or sound output for a touch input to<br>
the touchscreen can be stored in the memory 160.<br>
[0054] The memory 160 may be implemented using any type or<br>
combination of suitable volatile and non-volatile memory or<br>
storage devices including hard disk, random access memory (RAM),<br>
static random access memory (SRAM), electrically erasable<br>
programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), erasable programmable<br>
read-only memory (EPROM), programmable read-only memory (PROM),<br>
read-only memory (ROM), magnetic memory, flash memory, magnetic<br>
or optical disk, multimedia card micro type memory, card-type<br>
memory (e.g., SD memory, XD memory, etc.), or other similar<br>
memory or data storage device. And, the mobile terminal 100 is<br>
able to operate in association with a web storage for performing<br>
a storage function of the memory 160 on Internet.<br>
[0055] In addition, the interface unit 170 can be used to<br>
couple the mobile terminal 100 with external devices. The<br>
interface unit 170 also receives data from the external devices<br>
or is supplied with the power and then transfers the data or<br>
power to the respective elements of the mobile terminal 100 or<br>
enables data within the mobile terminal 100 to be transferred to<br>
the external devices. The interface unit 170 may also be<br>
configured using a wired/wireless headset port, an external<br>
charger pert, a wired/wireless data port, a memory card port, a<br>
port for coupling to a device having an identity module, audio<br>
input/output ports, video input/output ports, an earphone port<br>
and/or the like.<br>
[0056] In addition, the identity module is a chip for storing<br>
various kinds of information for authenticating a use authority<br>
of the mobile terminal 100 and can include a User Identify Module<br>
(UIM), Subscriber Identify Module (SIM), Universal Subscriber<br>
Identity Module (U3IM) and/or the like. A device having the<br>
identity module (hereinafter called 'identity device') can be<br>
manufactured as a smart card. Therefore, the identity device is<br>
connectible to the mobile terminal 100 via the corresponding port<br>
[0057] Further, when the mobile terminal 110 is connected to<br>
an external cradle, the interface unit 170 becomes a passage for<br>
supplying the mobile terminal 100 with a power from the cradle or<br>
a passage for delivering various command signals input from the<br>
cradle by a user to the mobile terminal 100. Each of the various<br>
command signals input from the cradle or the power can operate as<br>
a signal enabling the mobile terminal 100 to recognize that it is<br>
correctly loaded in the cradle.<br>
[0058] In addition, the controller 180 controls the overall<br>
operations of the mobile terminal 100. For example, the<br>
controller 180 performs the control and processing associated<br>
with voice calls, data communications, video calls, etc. In the<br>
embodiment in FIG. 1, the controller 180 also includes a<br>
multimedia module 181 that provides multimedia playback. The<br>
multimedia module 181 may also be configured as part of the<br>
controller 180, or implemented as a separate component. Moreover,<br>
the controller 180 can perform a pattern recognizing process for<br>
recognizing a writing input and a picture drawing input carried<br>
out on the touchscreen as characters or images, respectively. In<br>
addition, the power supply 190 provides power required by the<br>
various components for the mobile terminal 100. The power may be<br>
internal power, external power, or combinations thereof.<br>
[0059] Various embodiments described herein may also be<br>
implemented in a computer-readable medium using, for example,<br>
computer software, hardware, or some combination thereof. For a<br>
hardware implementation, the embodiments described herein may be<br>
implemented within one or mere application specific integrated<br>
circuits (ASICs), digital signal processors (DSPs), digital<br>

(PLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), processors,<br>
controllers, micro-controllers, microprocessors, other electronic<br>
units designed to perform the functions described herein, or a<br>
selective combination thereof. Such embodiments may also be<br>
implemented by the controller 180.<br>
[0060] For a software implementation, the embodiments<br>

[0061] A mobile terminal mentioned in this disclosure can<br>
include at least one of the components shown in FIG. 1, and<br>
preferably includes a touchscreen configured to receive an input<br>
of a touch action from a user. Since the touchscreen is one<br>
example of the display 151, the Touchscreen will be indicated by<br>
the same reference number 151 in the following description.<br>
[0062] In addition, communication data mentioned in this<br>
disclosure can include an audio call, a video call, a short text<br>
message, a long text message, a multimedia message, an email, and<br>
the like, for example. Of course, the communication data can<br>
include all types of communication data transmittable/receivable<br>
to/from a counterpart terminal as well as the examples of the<br>
communication data.<br>
[0063] According to one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the mobile terminal 100 can include a plurality of identity<br>
modules such as a first identity module, a second identity module<br>
and the like. Also, each of the first and second identity modules<br>
can be detachably provided to the mobile terminal 100.<br>
[0064] Configurations of the mobile terminal 100 provided<br>
with a plurality of identity modules will now be explained in<br>
more detail with reference to FIGs. 2A and 23. For clarity and<br>
convenience of the following description, the plurality of the<br>
identity modules is assumed to include a first identity module<br>
210 and a second identity module 220.<br>
[0065] Referring to FIGs. 2A and 2B, the first identity<br>
module 210 and the second identity module 220 can be detachably<br>
provided to a prescribed portion of the mobile terminal 100, and<br>
more particularly, to a backside of the mobile terminal 100. In<br>
addition, each of the first and second identity modules 210 and<br>
220 has user authentication information stored therein and also<br>
has an individual phone number set therefor. Thus, because two<br>
phone numbers are set for the mobile terminal 100, a user can be<br>
substantially provided with an effect of using a pair of<br>
terminals.<br>
[0066] For instance, one phone number '010-111-1111' can be<br>
set for the first identity module 210, while the other phone<br>
number '010-123-1234' can be set for the second identity module<br>
220. The mobile terminal 100 can also transceive communication<br>
data corresponding to the first identity module 210 and<br>
communication data corresponding to the second identity module<br>
220 simultaneously or at different timing points, using the first<br>
and second identity modules 210 and 220.<br>
[0067] Also, as mentioned in the foregoing description, an<br>
identity module can include one of USIM, SIM and the like. In<br>
addition, according to an embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the mobile terminal 100 displays a send key zone on the<br>
touchscreen 151 and can then receive an input of a user touch<br>
action performed on the send key zone. The send key zone is a<br>
predetermined touch area for selecting one of the first and<br>
second identity modules.<br>
[0068] In more detail, the send key zone is a key<br>
zone/predetermined area configured to receive an input of a<br>
transmission command of communication data from a user and is<br>
able to receive an input of a transmission command in a manner of<br>
discriminating the first identity module 210 and the second<br>
identity module 220, which shall be described in more detail<br>
later with reference to FIGs. 6A to 10C.<br>
[0069] Next, FIGs. 3A and 3B are diagrams of screen<br>
configurations for displaying a send key zone/predetermined touch<br>
area on a touchscreen of a mobile Terminal according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 3A, a send<br>
key zone 310 is provided to a lower end portion of a screen. When<br>
receiving an input of a touch &amp; drag action in a direction ® ,<br>
the send key zone 310 receives a transmission command of<br>
communication data using the first identity module 210. Also,<br>
when receiving an input of a touch &amp; drag action in a direction<br>
2 , the send key zone 310 receives a transmission command of<br>
communication data using the second identity module 220.<br>
[0070] Referring to FIG. 33, the send key zone 310 is again<br>
provided to a lower end portion of a screen. In this example,<br>
when receiving an input of a touch &amp; drag action performed on a<br>
prescribed point, the send key zone 310 receives a transmission<br>
command of communication data using the first identity module 210.<br>
Also, when receiving an input of a touch &amp; drag action in a<br>
direction (D , the send key zone 310 receives a transmission<br>
command of communication data using the second identity module<br>
220. Specifically, FIG. 3B shows the first identity module 210 is<br>
designated as a basic identity module or a priority identity<br>
module.<br>
[0071] Next, a method of controlling communication data<br>
transmission in a mobile terminal according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention will be explained with reference to FIGs. 4<br>
to 15B. In more detail, FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating a<br>
method of controlling communication data transmission in a mobile<br>
terminal according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0072] Referring to FIG. 4, the mobile terminal 100 receives<br>
input information of a counterpart terminal via the user input<br>
unit 130 from a user (S410). That is, the counterpart terminal is<br>
at least one other terminal that will communicate with the mobile<br>
terminal 100. Also, because the display includes the touchscreen<br>
151, the user can use the touchscreen 151 as one example for the<br>
user input unit 130.<br>
[0073] For example, the touchscreen 151 can display a virtual<br>
keypad that the user can use to input the counterpart information<br>
Of course, the user can input the counterpart information using a<br>
physical keypad (e.g., a button type keypad) on the mobile<br>
terminal 100. In addition, the user can directly input the<br>
counterpart information, or can select specific counterpart<br>
information from counterpart information stored in the memory 160.<br>
For instance, the counterpart information stored in the memory<br>
160 can be linked to a phonebook related application or<br>
counterpart information corresponding to recently-transceived<br>
communication data. Specifically, the counterpart information<br>
linked to the phonebook related application can include a<br>
counterpart title/name, a counterpart phone number and the like.<br>
[0074] Next, the controller 180 displays a send key zone on a<br>
prescribed portion of a screen displayed on the touchscreen 151<br>
(S420) . The send key zone is a predetermined touch area on the<br>
touchscreen 151 and can be displayed using a soft-touch button,<br>
or by simply designated a particular area of the touchscreen 151.<br>
The user can also designate a desired portion of the touchscreen<br>
151 to be used as the send key zone by drawing the-predetermined<br>
area with their finger, for example, and using the appropriate<br>
menu options on the terminal 100.<br>
[0075] In addition, the send key zone can always be displayed<br>
in a standby picture or a background picture. Alternatively, the<br>
send key zone can be displayed only if the counterpart<br>
information for a counterpart terminal that is to be communicated<br>
with is entirely or partially input. Further, when one of the<br>
first and second identity modules 210 and 220 is designated as a<br>
priority identity module, the mobile terminal 100 can display<br>
identity information indicating which of the identity modules is<br>
designated as the priority identity module on the send key zone.<br>
[0076] Further, the priority identity module can be the<br>
identity module that will preferentially transmit or receive<br>
communication data among a plurality of the identity modules<br>
provided to the mobile terminal 100. Therefore, communication<br>
data can be transmitted using the priority identity module unless<br>
the user requests another identity module be used. In addition,<br>
the identity information indicates a corresponding identity<br>
module and can be represented as a numeral, symbol, icon, image,<br>
text or the like.<br>
[0077] Next, a method of setting a configuration of an<br>
identity module will be explained with reference to FIGs. 5A and<br>
53. For clarity and convenience of the following description, the<br>
identity module is assumed to be a SIM, and include two identity<br>
modules SIM 1 and SIM 2.<br>
[0078] Referring to FIG. 5A, when the user enters a SIM<br>
configuration setting mode, the user can set a particular SIM to<br>
perform a particular function. For example, the user can set a<br>
call priority SIM and a messaging priority SIM to the SIM 1.<br>
Thus, calls and messages will be performed by the SIM 1 as a<br>
default unless the user overrides this selection.<br>
[0079] Referring to FIG. 5B, the mobile terminal 100 or user<br>
can set identity information for each of the SIM 1 and the SIM 2.<br>
For instance, if the user selects an identifier SIM 1 503, the<br>
controller 180 displays a user interface for inputting setting<br>
identity information for the SIM 1 as shown in FIG. 5B(a). If the<br>
user selects an identifier SIM 2 504, the controller 180 displays<br>
setting identity information for the SIM 2 as shown in FIG. 5B(b).<br>
[0080] In particular, referring to FIG. 5B(a), the identify<br>
information for the SIM 1 is set using a color (Blue) and shape<br>
(©). Referring to FIG. 5B(b), the identify information for the<br>
SIM 2 is set using a color (Red) and shape (©) . Referring again<br>
to FIG. 4, the user performs a touch action on the send key zone<br>
displayed in the displaying step S420 (S430). For example, the<br>
touch action can include a touch to a prescribed point, a touch &amp;<br>
drag action in a prescribed direction, etc.<br>
[0081] Further, the mobile terminal can receive the user's<br>
touch action when transmitting an audio or video call, sending a<br>
written message, etc. For instance, when transmitting an audic or<br>
video call, the user can first input counterpart information cf a<br>
counterpart terminal that is to receive the audio or video cal.<br>
Similarly, when sending a written message, the user can input the<br>
message and the counterpart information input.<br>
[0082] The controller 180 then determines whether the user's<br>
touch action on the send key is for selecting the SIM1 (210) or<br>
the SIM 2 (220) (S440). Further, when the input touch action is a<br>
touch &amp; drag, the touch pattern can include at least one of a<br>
touch &amp; drag direction, a touch &amp; drag distance and a touch &amp;<br>
drag speed. For instance, when the touch &amp; drag direction is a<br>
left direction, the controller 180 can determine the touch<br>
pattern is the transmission command for the first identity module<br>
210. Also, when the touch &amp; drag direction is a right direction,<br>
the controller 180 can determine that the touch pattern is the<br>
transmission command for the second identity module 220.<br>
[0083] Moreover, if the input touch action is a touch to a<br>
prescribed point, the touch pattern can include at least one cf a<br>
touch count, a touch pressure, a touch size, a touch point and a<br>
proximity touch distance. For instance, if the touch count is 1,<br>
the controller 180 can determine that the touch pattern is the<br>
transmission command for the first identity module 210. If the<br>
touch count is 2, the controller 180 can determine that the touch<br>
pattern is the transmission command for the second identity<br>
module 220.<br>
<br>
[0084] In addition, when the first identity module 210 is<br>
designated as the priority identity module (the second identity<br>
module 220 can alternatively be designated as the priority<br>
identity module), and if the touch pattern is the touch to a<br>
prescribed point, the controller 180 can determine that the touch<br>
pattern is the transmission command for the first identity module<br>
210. If the touch pattern is the touch &amp; drag in one direction,<br>
the controller 180 can determine that the touch pattern is the<br>
transmission command for the second identity module 220.<br>
[0085] Furthermore, the controller 180 can display either the<br>
first identity module 210 or the second identity module 220,<br>
which corresponds to the identity module indicated by the touch<br>
pattern, on the send key zone. In addition, when the first<br>
identity module 210 is designated as the priority identity module,<br>
the controller 180 can display the identity information of the<br>
first identity module 210 on the send key zone. Also, when<br>
receiving an input of the touch action of the touch pattern<br>
indicating the second identity module 220, the controller 180 can<br>
display the identity information of the second identity module<br>
220 on the send key zone.<br>
[0086] Further, the controller 180 transmits the<br>
communication data to the counterpart terminal corresponding to<br>
the counterpart information input in the inputting step S410<br>
using either the first identity module 210 or the second identity<br>
module 220, which is indicated by the touch pattern corresponding<br>
to the result of the determination made in the determining step<br>
S440 (S450). Also, the transmitting step S450 can be performed by<br>
the wireless communication unit 110.<br>
[0087] Thus, the mobile terminal can transmit an audio or<br>
video call to the counterpart terminal or send a message to the<br>
counterpart terminal using the identity module indicated by the<br>
touch pattern. Also, when the user releases the touch action from<br>
the send key zone or retouches the send key zone after the<br>
release of the touch action, the mobile terminal 100 can transmit<br>
the communication data to the counterpart terminal using the<br>
identity module indicated by the touch pattern. Moreover, a touch<br>
pattern of the touch action (hereinafter named a first touch<br>
action) input in the inputting step S430 may be different from<br>
that of a retouch action (hereinafter named a second touch<br>
action). For instance, the first touch action includes a touch &amp;<br>
drag, while the second touch action includes a touch to a<br>
prescribed point of the send key zone.<br>
[0088] Next, FIGs. 6A to 10C are diagrams of screen<br>
configurations for transmitting a call using an identity module<br>
indicated by a touch pattern of a touch action performed on a<br>
send key zone according to an embodiment of the present invention<br>
That is, the communication data is an audio call. For clarity and<br>
convenience of the following description, the user has already<br>
input the counterpart information (e.g., telephone number) of the<br>
counterpart terminal that will receive an audio call. Also, the<br>
first and second identity modules 210 and 220 include the SIM 1<br>
and SIM 2, respectively.<br>
[0089] Referring to FIGs. 6A to 6C, the controller 180 can<br>
select either the SIM 1 or SIM 2 to use for the audio call<br>
transmission according to a direction of a touch &amp; drag performed<br>
on a send key zone 310. For instance, when receiving an input of<br>
a touch &amp; drag action 1 in a left direction of the send key zone<br>
313, the mobile terminal 100 can transmit the audio call using<br>
the SIM 1 and display identity information '1' 311 of the SIM 1<br>
on the send key zone 310 as shown in FIG. 6B. Moreover, when<br>
receiving an input of a touch &amp; drag action 2 in a right<br>
direction of the send key zone 310, the mobile terminal 100 can<br>
transmit an audio call using the SIM 2 and display identity<br>
information '2' 312 of the SIM 2 on the send key zone 310 as<br>
shown in FIG. 6C. Further, a drag direction per identity module<br>
can be designated by the user or be preset by the mobile terminal<br>
100.<br>
[0090] Referring to FIGs. 7A to 7C, the controller 180 can<br>
select either the SIM 1 or SIM 2 to use for an audio call<br>
transmission according to a distance cf a touch &amp; drag performed<br>
on the send key zone 310. For instance, when receiving an input<br>
of a touch &amp; drag action ® in a first distance dl in one<br>
direction of the send key zone 310, the mobile terminal 100 can<br>
transmit an audio call using the SIM 1 and display identity<br>
information 'SIM 1' 311 of the SIM 1 on the send key zone 310 as<br>
shown in FIG. 7B.<br>
[0091] Moreover, when receiving an input of a touch &amp; drag<br>
action © in a second distance d2 in one direction of the send<br>
key zone 310, the mobile terminal 100 can transmit an audio call<br>
using the SIM 2 and display identity information 'SIM 2' 312 of<br>
the SIM 2 on the send key zone 310 as shown in FIG. 7C. Further,<br>
a drag distance per identity module can be designated by the user<br>
or be preset by the mobile terminal 100.<br>
[0092] Referring to FIGs. 8A to 8C, the controller 180 can<br>
select either SIM 1 or SIM 2 to use for an audio call<br>
transmission according to a count or number of touch actions<br>
performed on a send key zone 310. For instance, when receiving an<br>
input of one touch to the send key zone 310, the mobile terminal<br>
100 can transmit an audio call using the SIM 1 and display<br>
identity information '1' 311 of the SIM 1 on the send key zone<br>
310 as shown in FIG. 8B.<br>
[0093] Moreover, when receiving an input of two touches to<br>
the send key zone 310, the mobile terminal 100 can transmit an<br>
audio call using the SIM 2 and display identity information '2'<br>
312 of the SIM 2 on the send key zone 310 as shown in FIG. EC.<br>
Further, a touch count per identity module can be designated by<br>
the user or be preset by the mobile terminal 100.<br>
[0094] Next, referring to FIGs. 9A to 9C, a first point 310-1<br>
corresponding to the SIM 1 and a second point 310-2 corresponding<br>
to the SIM 2 are included on the send key zone 310 of the mobile<br>
terminal 100. The controller 180 can then select either the SIM 1<br>
or SIM 2 to use for an audio call transmission according tc a<br>
point selected by a user. For instance, when receiving an input<br>
of a touch to the first point 310-1 of the send key zone 310, the<br>
mobile terminal 100 can transmit an audio call using the SIM 1 as<br>
shown in FIG. 93.<br>
[0095] Moreover, when receiving an input of a touch to the<br>
second point 310-2 of the send key zone 310, the mobile terminal<br>
100 can transmit an audio call using the SIM 2 as shown in FIG.<br>
9C. Also, a point per identity module can be designated by the<br>
user or be preset by the mobile terminal 100.<br>
[0096] Referring to FIGs. 10A to 10C, when the SIM 1 is<br>
designated as a priority identity module, the mobile terminal 100<br>
can display identity information ' 1 ' 311 of the SIM 1 on the<br>
send key zone 310 before receiving an input of a touch action<br>
from the user as shown in FIG. 10A. For instance, when receiving<br>
an input of a touch action performed on one point of the send key<br>
zone 310, the mobile terminal 100 can transmit an audio call<br>
using the SIM 1 as shown in FIG. 103.<br>
[0097] Moreover, when receiving an input of a touch &amp; drag<br>
action in one direction of the send key zone 310, the mobile<br>
terminal 100 can transmit an audio call using the SIM 2 and<br>
display identity information ' 1 ' 312 of the SIM 2 on the send<br>
key zone 310 as shown in FIG. 100. In addition, the priority<br>
identity module can be designated by the user or be preset by the<br>
mobile terminal 100.<br>
[0098] Next, FIGs. 11A to 11C are diagrams of screen<br>
configurations for sending a message using an identity module<br>
indicated by a touch pattern of a touch action performed on a<br>
send key zone according to an embodiment of the present invention<br>
In this example, the communication data is a message. For clarity<br>
and convenience of the following description, the user has<br>
already input the message content and counterpart information of<br>
a message receiving side. The first and second identity modules<br>
210 and 220 also include the SIM 1 and SIM 2, respectively.<br>
[0099] Referring to FIGs. 11A to 11c, the controller 180 can<br>
select either the SIM 1 or SIM 2 to use for a message<br>
transmission according to a direction of a touch &amp; drag perforrried<br>
on a send key zone 310. For instance, when receiving an input of<br>
a touch &amp; drag action 1 in a left direction of the send key zone<br>
310, the mobile terminal 100 can transmit a message using the SIM<br>
1 and display identity information '1' 311 of the SIM 1 on the<br>
send key zone 310 as shown in FIG. 11B. Moreover, when receiving<br>
an input of a touch &amp; drag action © in a right direction of ;;he<br>
send key zone 310, the mobile terminal 100 can transmit a message<br>
using the SIM 2 and display identity information '1' 312 of the<br>
SIM 2 on the send key zone 310 as shown in FIG. 11C.<br>
[00100] Further, the former embodiments for the touch action<br>
input for the send key zone 310 and the corresponding selection<br>
of the identity module shown in FIGs. 6A to 10C are also<br>
applicable to this message transmission. In addition, the<br>
controller 180 can select a SIM to use for an audio call<br>
transmission or a message transmission in accordance with a speed<br>
of a touch &amp; drag action performed on the send key zone 310. For<br>
instance, if the touch &amp; drag action speed is 10 cm/s, the mobile<br>
terminal 100 can select the SIM 1, and if the touch &amp; drag action-<br>
speed is 20 cm/s, the mobile terminal 100 can select the SIM 2.<br>
[00101] Further, when a touch pressure or size for the send<br>
key zone 310 is smaller than a first reference, the mobile<br>
terminal 100 can select the SIM 1, and when a touch pressure or<br>
size for the send key zone 310 is equal to or greater than a<br>
first reference, the mobile terminal 100 can select the SIM 2.<br>
Also, when a proximity touch distance for the send key zone 310<br>
is a first distance, the mobile terminal 100 can select the SIM 1,<br>
and when a proximity touch distance for the send key zone 310 is<br>
a second distance, the mobile terminal 100 can select the SIM 2.<br>
[00102] Also, according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, if a priority identity module corresponding to the<br>
first identity module 210 or the second identity module 220 is in<br>
a poor communication state, the mobile terminal 100 can display<br>
identity information on the first: or second identity module,<br>
which is not the priority identity module, on the send key zone<br>
310.<br>
[00103] In more detail, FIGs. 12A and 12B are diagrams of<br>
screen configurations for displaying second identity information<br>
on a send key zone if a first identity module, which is a<br>
priority identity module, is in a poor communication state<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to<br>
FIG. 12A, if a communication state of the SIM 1 (i.e., the<br>
priority identity module) is poor, the mobile terminal 100 can<br>
display a window 1210 for enabling a user to select whether to<br>
change the priority identity module.<br>
[00104] Referring to FIG. 12B, if the user selects 'change<br>
priority identity module' in FIG. 12A, the controller 180 changes<br>
the priority identity module to be set to the SIM 2 from the SIM<br>
1 and displays identity information '2' 312 of the SIM 2 on the<br>
send key zone 310 instead of identity information '1' 311 of the<br>
SIM 1 as shown in FIG. 12B.<br>
[00105] Alternatively, if a communication state of the SIM 1<br>
(i.e., the priority identity module) is poor, the mobile terminal<br>
100 can automatically change the priority identity module to be<br>
set to the SIM 2 from the SIM 1 irrespective of a selection made<br>
by a user. In addition, if the communication state corresponding<br>
to the SIM 1 is restored, the mobile terminal 100 can set the<br>
priority identity module to the SIM 1 again or can keep setting<br>
the priority identity module to the SIM 2 according to a<br>
selection made by a user or terminal.<br>
[00106] Also, according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, when connecting a first call and a second call using<br>
the first and second identity modules 210 and 220, the controller<br>
180 can display an end key zone on a prescribed region of a<br>
touchscreen and receives an input of a touch action performed on<br>
the end key zone from the user. For instance, when connecting a<br>
first call and a second call, the mobile terminal 100 can output<br>
an audio signal or a video signal (for a video call) transceived<br>
via either the first call or the second call.<br>
[00107] The controller 180 also determines whether a touch<br>
pattern of the input touch action indicates an end command for<br>
the first call or an end command for the second call. The<br>
controller 180 also controls the wireless communication unit 110<br>
to end either the first call or the second call indicated by the<br>
touch pattern according to a result of the determination.<br>
[00108] A process for inputting a touch action performed on an<br>
end key zone and ending a call using an identity module indicated<br>
by a touch pattern will now be explained with reference to FIGs.<br>
13A to 14C. In more detail, FIGs. 13A to 14C are diagrams of<br>
screen configurations for ending a call using an identity module<br>
indicated by a touch pattern of a touch action performed on an<br>
end key zone when the first and second calls are connected using<br>
the first and second identity modules according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
[00109] Referring to FIGs. 13A and 13B, while a first cal and<br>
a second call are connected, the mobile terminal 100 displays<br>
information (e.g., counterpart phone number, call duration, etc.)<br>
1310 on the first call and information (e.g., counterpart phone<br>
number, call duration, etc.) 1320 on the second call and also<br>
displays an end key zone 320 on a prescribed region of the screen<br>
[00110] Also, referring to FIG. 13B, if the SIM 1 is set . to<br>
the priority identity module, and when, an audio signal according<br>
to the first call is output or the information 1310 on the first<br>
call is selected, the controller 180 displays identity<br>
information '1' 321 of the SIM 1 on the end key zone 320.<br>
Referring to FIG. 13C, if the SIM 2 is set as the priority<br>
identity module, when an audio signal according to the second<br>
call is output or the information 1320 on the second call is<br>
selected, the controller 180 displays identity information '2'<br>
322 of the SIM 2 on the end key zone 320.<br>
[00111] Referring to FIGs. 13C and 13D, while the identity<br>
information 321 of the SIM 1 is displayed on the end key zone 320<br>
(see FIG. 13C) , and when receiving an input of a touch &amp; drag<br>
action performed on the end key zone 320, the controller 180 ends<br>
the second call by displaying the identity information 322 on the<br>
SIM 2 on the end key zone 320 (see FIG. 13D) .<br>
[00112] Referring to FIGs. 14A to 14C, the mobile terminal 100<br>
can selectively end the first call or the second call according<br>
to a direction of a touch &amp; drag operation performed on the end<br>
key zone 320. For instance, when receiving a touch &amp; drag action<br>
1 in a left direction of the end key zone 320, the mobile<br>
terminal 100 ends the first call using the SIM 1 and displays the<br>
identity information '1' 321 of the SIM 1 on the end key zone<br>
320 as shown in FIG. 14B. In another example, when receiving a<br>
touch &amp; drag action 2 in a right direction of the end key zone<br>
320, the mobile terminal 100 ends the second call using the SIM 2<br>
and displays the identity information '2' 322 of the SIM 2 on<br>
the end key zone 320 as shown in FIG. 14C.<br>
[00113] Further, if a touch &amp; drag distance is equal to or<br>
greater than a predetermined reference, a touch action is removed<br>
or a retouch action is performed on the end key zone 320 after<br>
removal of the touch action, the mobile terminal 100 ends the<br>
corresponding call. Moreover, the former embodiments for the<br>
touch action input to the end key zone 310 and the corresponding<br>
identity module selection regarding the audio call transmission<br>
(shown in FIGs. 6A to 10C) are also applicable to the end call<br>
operation.<br>
[00114] Thus, according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, when receiving communication data using a specific one<br>
of the first identity module 210 and the second identity module<br>
220, the controller 180 displays identity information of the<br>
specific identity module on a send key zone. Further, a user cf a<br>
counterpart terminal can designate a terminal on a communication<br>
data receiving side by inputting a phone number corresponding to<br>
the specific identity module. This embodiment will now be<br>
exolained in more detail with reference to FIG. 15A and FIG. 15B.<br>
<br>
[00115] In particular, FIGs. 15A and 15B are diagrams of<br>
screen configurations for displaying second identity information<br>
on a send key zone when receiving a call using a second identity<br>
module according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 15A, the mobile terminal 100 displays the send<br>
key zone 310 on a standby picture. Also, when receiving a call<br>
using the SIM 2, the mobile terminal 100 displays identity<br>
information '2' 312 of the SIM 2 on the send key zone 310 as<br>
shown in FIG. 15B.<br>
[00116] A method of controlling a communication list display<br>
in a mobile terminal will now be explained with reference to FIGs.<br>
16 to 20C. In particular, FIG. 16 is a flowchart illustrating a<br>
method of displaying a communication list in a mobile terminal<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[00117] Referring to FIG. 16, the controller 180 of the mobile<br>
terminal 100 transceives communication data with at least one<br>
counterpart (other) terminal using at least one of the first<br>
identity module 210 and the second identity module 220 (S1610).<br>
Further, the transceiving step S1610 can be performed by the<br>
wireless communication unit 110.<br>
[00118] The controller 180 then displays a communication list<br>
including counterpart information of the at least one counterpart<br>
terminal having transceived the communication data in the<br>
transceiving step S1610 on the touchscreen (S1620). In this<br>
instance, the counterpart information is included in the<br>
communication list per communication data transceived or can be<br>
included in the communication list per counterpart terminal. In<br>
the latter case, even if the communication data are transceived<br>
with a specific counterpart terminal plural times, one<br>
counterpart information can be included in the communication list.<br>
[00119] Moreover, the counterpart information can include a<br>
phone number of a corresponding counterpart terminal, a<br>
title/name of a corresponding counterpart terminal linked to a<br>
phonebook related application, a corresponding call duration, a<br>
corresponding call date/hours (or a corresponding message<br>
transceived hour) and the like. In addition, the mobile terminal<br>
100 can also display identity information on a corresponding<br>
identity module having transceived the corresponding<br>
communication data as counterpart information included in the<br>
communication list.<br>
[00120] For instance, when the counterpart information<br>
included in the communication list is generated per communication<br>
data transceived with a counterpart terminal, the mobile terminal<br>
100 can display identity information of a corresponding identity<br>
module used in transceiving the corresponding communication data<br>
for each counterpart information as the counterpart information.<br>
In another instance, when the counterpart information included in<br>
the communication list is generated per counterpart terminal, the<br>
mobile terminal 100 can display identity information of an<br>
identity module used in transceiving the last communication data<br>
with the corresponding counterpart terminal as the counterpart<br>
information.<br>
[00121] In still another instance, the mobile terminal 100 car-<br>
display a send key zone (hereinafter named an individual send key<br>
zone) for displaying identity information of a corresponding<br>
identity module for each counterpart information included in the<br>
communication list. In this instance, the corresponding identity<br>
module can include an identity module used in transceiving<br>
communication data with a counterpart terminal corresponding to<br>
the counterpart information (when generating counterpart<br>
information per communication data). Alternatively, the<br>
corresponding identity module can include an identity module used<br>
in transceiving last communication data with a counterpart<br>
terminal corresponding to the counterpart information (when<br>
generating counterpart information per counterpart terminal).<br>
[00122] The mobile terminal 100 also displays a representative<br>
send key zone on a prescribed region of a screen and displays<br>
identity information of an identity module having transceived<br>
communication data corresponding to specific counterpart<br>
information selected from the communication list on the<br>
representative send key zone. Therefore, the identity information<br>
displayed on the send key zone can be changed according to what<br>
kind of counterpart information is selected from the<br>
communication list.<br>
[00123] A communication list display will now be explained in<br>
more detail with reference to FIGs. 17A to 17C. In this example,<br>
the counterpart information included in the communication list is<br>
generated per transceived communication data. In more detail,<br>
FIGs. 17A to 17C are diagrams of screen configurations for<br>
displaying a communication list constructed with counterpart<br>
information including identity information of a corresponding<br>
identity module according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[00124] Referring to FIG. 17A, the mobile terminal 100<br>
displays a communication list including a plurality of<br>
counterpart informations 1710 to 1740. In particular, each of the<br>
counterpart informations can include a communication data type<br>
(e.g., a presence or non-presence of an audio call_, a presence<br>
or non-presence of a video call, a presence or non-presence of a<br>
text message, a presence or non-presence of a multimedia message,<br>
etc.), a presence or non-presence of transceiving (e.g.,<br>
transmit_?, receive_? etc.), identity information (SIM 1 1,<br>
SIM 2_ 2 ) of a corresponding identity module, a corresponding<br>
counterpart name, a corresponding communication data transceived<br>
time (hour/min etc.), and the like.<br>
[00125] Each of the counterpart informations can also include<br>
a corresponding one of individual send key zones 1711 to 1741.<br>
Further, identity information 1711-1, 1721-2, 1731-1 and 1741-2<br>
of the SIM used in transceiving the corresponding communication<br>
data can be displayed on the individual send key zones 1711 to<br>
1741, respectively.<br>
[00126] Referring to FIG. 17B, the mobile terminal 100<br>
displays a communication list including counterpart information<br>
1710 and 1730 corresponding to the communication data transceived<br>
using the SIM 1 only. In particular, when the indicator SIM 1<br>
1751 is selected in FIG. 17A or FIG. 17C, the communication list<br>
shown in FIG. 173 is displayed.<br>
[00127] Referring to FIG. 17C, the mobile terminal 100<br>
displays a communication list including counterpart information<br>
1720 and 1740 corresponding to the communication data transceived<br>
using the SIM 2 only. In particular, when the indicator SIM 2<br>
1752 is selected in FIGs. 17A or 17B, the communication list<br>
shown in FIG. 17C can be displayed. Also, if the indicator 'All'<br>
1753 is selected in FIGs. 17B or 17C, the mobile terminal 100<br>
returns to the state shown in FIG. 17A.<br>
[00128] Referring again to FIG. 16, the mobile terminal 100<br>
receives an input of a touch action performed on the individual<br>
send key zone (S1630). Regarding the touch action input in the<br>
inputting step S1630 and a touch pattern of the input touch<br>
action, the descriptions of the former inputting step S430 and<br>
the former determining step S440 in FIG. 3 are used.<br>
[00129] The controller 180 also determines whether the touch<br>
pattern of the input touch action is a command (hereinafter named<br>
a first transmission command) for transmitting communication data<br>
using a corresponding identity module or a command (hereinafter<br>
named a second transmission command) for transmitting<br>
communication data using another identity module different from<br>
the corresponding identity module.<br>
[00130] For instance, if the touch pattern is a single touch<br>
to a prescribed point of an individual send key zone less than a<br>
predetermined duration, the mobile terminal 100 determines that<br>
the touch pattern is the first transmission command. If the touch<br>
pattern is a touch &amp; drag operation to a prescribed point of an<br>
individual send key zone, multiple touches to a prescribed point<br>
or a touch to a prescribed point greater or equal tc a<br>
predetermined duration, the mobile terminal 100 determines that<br>
the touch pattern is the second transmission command.<br>
[00131] According to the determination result, the controller<br>
180 transmits the communication data to the corresponding<br>
counterpart terminal using the first identity module 210 when the<br>
first transmission command is used. When the second transmission<br>
command is used, the controller 180 transmits the communication<br>
data to the corresponding counterpart terminal using the second<br>
identity module 220 (S1640) . Further, the transmitting step S1640<br>
can be performed by the wireless communication unit 110.<br>
[00132] In addition, the corresponding counterpart terminal<br>
can include a counterpart terminal corresponding to the<br>
counterpart information including the individual send key zone to<br>
which the touch action was input. Moreover, the communication<br>
data transmitted in the transmitting step S640 can have the same<br>
type of the communication data corresponding to the counterpart<br>
information including the individual send key zone to which the<br>
touch action was input. Communication data of a different type<br>
according to a user selection can also be transmitted as well.<br>
[00133] An input of a touch action performed on an individual<br>
send key zone and a corresponding communication data transmitting<br>
operation will now be described. In more detail, FIGs. 18A to<br>
18D are diagrams of screen configurations for transmitting a call<br>
to a specific counterpart terminal using an identity module<br>
indicated by a touch pattern of a touch action performed on a<br>
send key zone included in specific counterpart information<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[00134] Referring to FIG. 18A, the mobile terminal 100<br>
receives an input of a touch action performed on a first<br>
individual send key zone 1711 included in a first counterpart<br>
information 1710. In this instance, because the identity module<br>
corresponding to the first counterpart information 1710 is the<br>
SIM 1, the mobile terminal 100 displays an identity information<br>
1711-1 of the SIM 1 on the first individual send key zone 1711.<br>
[00135] Also, when a touch 1 to a prescribed point of the<br>
first individual send key zone 1711 is input in FIG. 18A [1],<br>
the mobile terminal 100 transmits an audio call to a counterpart<br>
terminal corresponding to the first counterpart information 1710<br>
using the SIM 1 as shown in FIG. 183. Also, when a touch &amp; drag<br>
operation 2 from a prescribed point of the first individual send<br>
key zone 1711 is input in FIG. 18A, the mobile terminal 100<br>
transmits an audio call to a counterpart terminal corresponding<br>
to the first counterpart information 1710 using the SIM 2 as<br>
shown in FIG. 18C.<br>
[00136] Also, because communication data corresponding to the<br>
first counterpart information 1710 is an audio call, the mobile<br>
terminal 100 transmits an audio call to a counterpart terminal,<br>
as shown in FIGs. 183 or 18C. The mobile terminal 100 can also<br>
transmit communication data of a type different from the former<br>
communication data corresponding to the first counterpart<br>
information 1710 according to a user selection.<br>
[00137] In addition, when receiving an input of a check<br>
command of the first counterpart information 1710 in FIG. 18A,<br>
the mobile terminal 100 displays detailed information<br>
corresponding to the first counterpart information 1710 on the<br>
screen as shown in FIG. 18D. That is, the mobile terminal 100<br>
displays a send key zone 1810, which is marked with an identity<br>
information '1' 1811 of the identity module (SIM 1) corresponding<br>
to the first counterpart information 1710 on a prescribed region<br>
of the screen.<br>
[00138] Next, FIGs. 19A to 19C are diagrams of screen<br>
configurations for sending a message to a specific counterpart<br>
terminal using an identity module indicated by a touch pattern of<br>
a touch action performed on a send key zone included in specific<br>
counterpart information according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. In this example, the communication data includes a<br>
message.<br>
[00139] Referring to FIG. 19A, the mobile terminal 100<br>
receives an input of a touch action performed on a fourth<br>
individual send key zone 17 41 included in a fourth counterpart<br>
information 1740. Further, because an identity module<br>
corresponding to the fourth counterpart information 1740 is the<br>
SIM 2, the mobile terminal 100 displays an identity information<br>
1741-2 of the SIM 2 on the fourth individual send key zone 1741.<br>
[00140] In addition, if a touch 1 to a prescribed point of<br>
the fourth individual send key zone 1741 is input in FIG. 19A,<br>
the mobile terminal 100 enters a writing state of a message to<br>
send to a counterpart terminal corresponding to the fourth<br>
counterpart information 1740 and displays a send key zone 1910<br>
marked with the identity information 1912 of the SIM 2 on a<br>
prescribed region of the screen as shown in FIG. 19B.<br>
[00141] Further, using the SIM 2 for receiving an input of a<br>
touch to a prescribed point of the send key zone 1910 shown in<br>
FIG. 19B or using the SIM I for receiving an input of a touch &amp;<br>
drag, the mobile terminal 100 can send the written message to the<br>
counterpart terminal corresponding to the fourth counterpart<br>
information 1740.<br>
[00142] If a touch &amp; drag operation 2 from a prescribed point<br>
of the fourth individual send key zone 17 41 is input in FIG. 19A,<br>
the mobile terminal 100 enters a writing state of a message to<br>
send to a counterpart terminal corresponding to the fourth<br>
counterpart information 1740 and displays a send key zone 1910<br>
marked with the identity information 1911 of the SIM 1 on a<br>
prescribed region of the screen as shown in FIG. 19C. Further,<br>
using the SIM 1 for receiving an input of a touch to a prescribed<br>
point of the send key zone 1910 shown in FIG. 19C or using the<br>
SIM 2 for receiving an input of a touch &amp; drag, the mobile<br>
terminal 100 can send the written message to the counterpart<br>
terminal corresponding to the fourth counterpart information 1740.<br>
[00143] Next, FIGs. 20A to 20C are diagrams of screen<br>
configurations for displaying identity information of a<br>
corresponding identity module when the user selects that specific<br>
counterpart information according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Referring to FIG. 20A, the mobile terminal 100<br>
displays a communication list including a plurality of<br>
counterpart information 1710 to 1740 and also displays a<br>
representative send key zone 2010 on a prescribed region of the<br>
screen.<br>
[00144] Referring to FIG. 203, if the user selects a first<br>
counterpart information 1710 from the communication list, the<br>
mobile terminal 100 displays an identity information 2011 of an<br>
identity module (i.e., SIM 1) corresponding to the first<br>
counterpart information 1710 on the representative send key zone<br>
2010.<br>
[00145] Also, using the SIM 1 when receiving an input of a<br>
touch to a prescribed point of the representative send key zone<br>
2010 shown in FIG. 20B or using the SIM 2 when receiving an input<br>
of a touch &amp; drag, the mobile terminal 100 can send an audio call<br>
to the counterpart terminal corresponding to the first<br>
counterpart information 1710.<br>
[00146] Referring to FIG. 20C, if a fourth counterpart<br>
information 1740 is selected from the communication list, the<br>
mobile terminal 100 can display an identity information 2022 of<br>
an identity module (i.e., SIM 2) corresponding to the fourth<br>
counterpart information 1740 on the representative send key zone<br>
2020.<br>
[00147] Moreover, using the SIM 2 when receiving an input of a<br>
touch to a prescribed point of the representative send key zone<br>
2020 shown in FIG. 20C or using the SIM 1 when receiving an input<br>
of a touch &amp; drag, the mobile terminal 100 can set a state for<br>
sending a message to the counterpart terminal corresponding to<br>
the fourth counterpart information 1740.<br>
[00148] According to an embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the mobile terminal 100 can display a communication state<br>
information on a first identity module 210 and a communication<br>
state information on a second identity module 220. For instance,<br>
the mobile terminal can display an indicator indicating a signal<br>
strength of a communication via the first identity module 210 and<br>
an indicator indicating a signal strength of a communication via<br>
the second identity module 220.<br>
[00149] Also, according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, when receiving an input of a touch &amp; drag action<br>
operation performed on a send key zone (or an end key zone), the<br>
mobile terminal 100 can shift the send key zone to correspond to<br>
a touch &amp; drag distance and direction. Further, even if a touch &amp;<br>
drag action is input, the send key zone can be set not to move to<br>
correspond to the touch &amp; drag distance and direction.<br>
[00150] In addition, when a corresponding communication data<br>
is an audio call or a video call, a send key region mentioned in<br>
the foregoing description of the present invention can display<br>
information indicating the audio call or the video call. If a<br>
corresponding communication data is a message, the send key zone<br>
can display information indicating that message. The send or end<br>
key zone mentioned in the foregoing description of the present<br>
invention can also be set to differ in its functionality only in<br>
the same key zone for a call related operation.<br>
[00151] Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention<br>
provide several advantages. First of all, an embodiment of the<br>
present invention can select a specific identity module to<br>
transmit communication data from a plurality of identity modules<br>
by determining a touch pattern of a touch action performed on a<br>
send key zone, thereby quickly performing a transmission command<br>
signal input and an identity module selection even though a<br>
plurality of the identity modules are provided.<br>
[00152] Secondly, an embodiment of the present invention can<br>
display identity information of a corresponding identity module<br>
on a send key zone, thereby providing a user with information<br>
indicating which identity module will be used in transmitting<br>
communication data in a current status using the send key zone.<br>
[00153] Thirdly, an embodiment of the present invention<br>
displays identity information of a corresponding identity module<br>
for each counterpart information on a communication list, thereby<br>
providing a user wirh information indicating which module has<br>
transceived communication data corresponding to specific<br>
counterpart information.<br>
[00154] Finally, an embodiment of the present invention<br>
displays an individual send key zone, on which identity<br>
information of a corresponding identity module is displayed, for<br>
each counterpart information on a communication list, thereby<br>
transmitting communication data to a corresponding counterpart<br>
terminal according to an input of a touch action to the<br>
individual send key zone for each counterpart information.<br>
[00155] Further, according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the above-described methods can be implemented in a<br>
program recorded medium as computer-readable codes. The computer-<br>
readable media include all kinds of recording devices in which<br>
data readable by a computer system are stored. The computer-<br>
readable media include ROM, RAM, CD-ROM, magnetic tapes, floppy<br>
discs, optical data storage devices, and the like for example and<br>
also include carrier-wave type implementations (e.g.,<br>
transmission via the Internet).<br>
[00156] It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that<br>
various modifications and variations can be made in a mobile<br>
terminal and method of controlling communication data<br>
transmission and communication list display therein according to<br>
the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope<br>
of the inventions. Thus, it is intended that the present<br>
