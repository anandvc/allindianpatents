FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a method for preparing a coated substrate<br>
for immobilizing a biological sample thereon, preferentially for analysis thereof. The<br>
present invention is further directed to a pre-coated substrate prepared according to<br>
the above method. The substrate is coated with a polycationic polymer providing a<br>
stable polymer layer capable of ionic interaction with anionic biological components.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Various biological preparatory techniques require immobilization of sample<br>
materials, such as cells, tissue, proteins, or nucleic acids, to a substrate prior to<br>
subsequent processing. Many of these biological materials of interest are anionic in<br>
nature, exhibiting net negative charge sites. One method of immobilizing these<br>
materials is to coat the target substrate with a chemical solution containing active<br>
ingredients that are cationic in nature, exhibiting a net positive charge. As the<br>
biological materials of interest to be immobilized exhibit net negative charge sites, the<br>
biological materials bind to the surface of the substrate through interaction with, the<br>
net positive charge sites of the coating solution. This adhesion property of the coating<br>
solution allows the immobilization of sample material for subsequent processing.<br>
The immobilization effect described above can be created through the use of<br>
coatings containing various active ingredients currently known in the art. For<br>
example, it is currently known to use coating agents, such as poly-1-lysine, 3-<br>
aminopropyl triethoxysilane, chrome alum gelatin, and egg white albumin. One of<br>
the most widely used of these known immobilization agents is poly-1-lysine (PLL).<br>
PLL is a large polycationic homopolymer that exhibits a strong positive<br>
charge produced by the terminal amino groups of the lysine residue side chains all<br>
along the polymer. L-Lysine [(S)-2,6-diaminohexanoic acid] is an amino acid of the<br>
chemical structure shown below in formula (1).<br><br><br>
The polymer PLL is a chain of 1-lysine monomer units attached through peptide<br>
bonds. The chemical structure for PLL is provided below in formula (2), wherein n is<br>
an integer representing the number of monomer units in the polymer chain.<br><br>
While PLL is widely used as a polycationic polymer coating, substrates coated<br>
with PLL tend to lose their immobilization effectiveness over a relatively short time<br>
period. This decline in effectiveness over time is generally thought to be due to<br>
oxidation of the PLL side chain amine groups. The oxidized groups do not exhibit the<br>
net positive charge required for proper adhesion to the biological materials to be<br>
immobilized.,	<br>
The effectiveness of PLL as an immobilization agent is also limited by its<br>
inherent chemical structure shown above in formula (2). As previously noted, the<br>
amino acid residues of the polymer are connected by peptide bonds (-CO-NH- bonds).<br>
These peptide bonds are highly vulnerable to cleavage by proteolytic enzymes, such<br>
as trypsin, and to general hydrolytic cleavage, such as through attack from a<br>
nucleophilic substance. Cleavage of the peptide bonds results in PLL molecules of<br>
substantially shorter chain length, as measured by the average molecular weight of the<br>
polymer. As the molecular weight of the PLL molecule is reduced through<br>
proteolytic cleavage, the immobilization capability of the molecule (i.e. its adhesive<br>
property) becomes greatly reduced.<br><br>
Known immobilization agents, such as PLL, exhibit limited usefulness as a<br>
result of the chemical instabilities described above. Accordingly, substrates coated<br>
with the. known agents also exhibit limited usefulness, particularly for long-term use<br>
or use after significant storage time. Given the limited stability of substrates coated<br>
with the known immobilization agents, it would be highly useful to have a pre-coated<br>
substrate that is coated with an immobilization agent that exhibits increased stability,<br>
particularly being useful for immobilizing a biological sample for observation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a coated substrate preferentially adapted for<br>
immobilizing a biological sample. The substrate is coated with a polycationic<br>
polymer exhibiting increased stability in comparison to the immobilization agents<br>
previously known in the art. Accordingly, the substrate coated with the stable<br>
polycationic polymer is useful for immobilizing biological samples having net a<br>
negative charge, and the coated substrate maintains such usefulness for an extended<br>
time period.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a method for<br>
preparing a coated substrate. Preferentially, the coated substrate is adapted for<br>
immobilizing a biological sample. According to one embodiment, the method<br>
comprises providing a substrate having a surface comprising a plurality of anionic<br>
groups, and contacting the substrate with a composition comprising a solution of a<br>
non-peptidic polymeric material to form a coating of the non-peptidic polymeric material on at least a portion of the surface of the substrate. The solution comprising<br>
the non-peptidic polymeric material can be an aqueous solution or an organic<br>
solution, preferably having a pH of at least about 6.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the,invention,.the method further comprises<br>
the steps of drying the substrate coated with the non-peptidic polymeric material.<br>
Preferentially, the coated substrate with the dried non-peptidic polymeric material<br>
thereon is rinsed.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the method is characterized<br>
by the absence of substrate cleaning. In particular, the method excludes subjecting<br><br>
the substrate to a cleaning process prior to contacting the substrate with the non- <br>
peptidic polymeric material.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a pre-<br>
coated substrate, such as a microscope slide, that is preferentially adapted for<br>
immobilizing a biological sample for analysis. According to one embodiment, the<br>
substrate comprises a surface having a plurality of anionic groups for providing a net<br>
negative charge, and the substrate is coated with a non-peptidic polymeric material<br>
comprising a plurality of cationic groups.<br>
The pre-coated substrate, according to this aspect of the invention, is<br>
characterized by its capability of immobilizing an average number of cells per surface<br>
area of the substrate, In one particular embodiment, the pre-coated substrate is<br>
capable of immobilizing an average number of cells per surface area of at least about<br>
20,000 cells/cm2 when the pre-coated substrate is contacted with 1 mL of a<br>
suspension of cells from the SiHa cell line.<br>
 According to another embodiment of the invention, the non-peptidic<br>
polymeric material used for coating the pre-coated substrate comprises an allylic<br>
polymer, a vinylic polymer, or a combination thereof, preferentially comprising<br>
cationic groups selected from the group consisting of primary amines, secondary<br>
amines, tertiary amines, and quaternary amines. In one preferred embodiment, the<br>
non-peptidic polymeric material comprises polydiallyldimethylammoniurn (PDDA).<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the non-peptidic polymeric<br>
material comprises polyallylamine (PAH).<br>
The substrate according to the present invention can be any item or apparatus<br>
useful or necessary for observing or analyzing a biological material. In one preferred<br>
embodiment, the substrate is selected from the group consisting of slides, plates,<br>
beads, test tubes, cuvettes, dipsticks, swabs, and gauze. In a further embodiment, the<br>
substrate could be a device useful as a contaminant gathering device. For example,<br>
the substrate could be a glove, a towel, or a medical drape.<br>
The coated substrates according to the present invention are adapted for<br>
immobilizing materials that are at least partially anionic in nature. Preferably, the<br>
materials for immobilization have a net negative charge. Accordingly, the coated<br>
substrates are useful for immobilizing various materials, particularly being adapted<br><br>
for immobilizing biological material, such as cells, tissue, fluids, DNA, RNA,<br>
proteins, and similar biological material having anionic groups available for<br>
interaction with the cationic groups of the non-peptidic polymeric material used in<br>
preparing the coated substrate of the present invention.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
method of analyzing a biological sample. In one embodiment according to this aspect<br>
of the invention, the method comprises the following steps: providing a pre-coated<br>
substrate adapted for immobilizing a biological sample, the substrate comprising a<br>
surface having a plurality of anionic groups, wherein the substrate is coated with a<br>
non-peptidic polymeric material comprising a plurality of cationic groups; applying a<br>
biological sample to the pre-coated substrate to immobilize the biological sample on<br>
the substrate; and analyzing the biological sample immobilized on the pre-coated<br>
substrate. In a particular embodiment, the pre-coated substrate is capable of<br>
immobilizing an average number of cells per surface area of at least about 20,000<br>
cells/cm when the pre-coated substrate is contacted with 1 mL of a suspension of<br>
cells from the SiHa cell line.	<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter. However,<br>
this invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed<br>
as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are<br>
provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. As used in<br>
this specification and the claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural<br>
referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.<br>
The pre-coated substrate of the present invention is characterized by the use of<br>
a polymeric coating material preferably demonstrating immobilization capabilities at<br>
least equivalent to the coating agents presently known, but also demonstrating<br>
extended stability of this immobilization effect after coating of the substrate. Further,<br>
in a preferred embodiment, the polymeric coating material is of a chemical structure<br>
that is less vulnerable, or invulnerable, to proteolytic or hydrolytic degradation as<br>
compared to conventional coating agents, such as PLL.<br><br>
The polymeric coating material according to the present invention comprises a<br>
plurality of cationic groups that are available for interaction with anionic groups, such<br>
as on a substrate to be coated and within a biological sample to be immobilized. The<br>
cationic groups can be an integral component of the polymeric backbone of the<br>
polymeric coating material or present as side chain groups. The cationic groups can<br>
be any group having a net positive charge and being capable of ionic interaction with<br>
oppositely charged particles or groups. Particularly preferred cationic groups include<br>
amine groups and ammonium groups, which can be primary, secondary, tertiary, or<br>
quaternary amine groups or ammonium groups. Cationic groups, particularly an<br>
ammonium group, often have a negatively charged counterion associated with the<br>
group, such as chloride.<br>
Cationic groups exhibiting greater degrees of substitution are particularly<br>
preferred. As previously noted, simple amine groups, such as primary amines, are<br>
highly susceptible to oxidation. Substituted amines are less susceptible to such<br>
oxidative attack and therefore exhibit increased stability. It is believed substitution of<br>
the hydrogen groups on the amine with more complex groups, such as methyl groups,<br>
provides protection against oxidation, the more complex groups being less susceptible<br>
to substitution. Accordingly, higher degrees of substitution are believed to yield<br>
amines of increased stability. Quaternary ammonium groups are particularly<br>
preferred for their increased stability.<br>
- The polymeric coating material of the present invention is preferably formed<br>
by polymerization of one or more allylic or vinylic monomers. Allylic polymers are<br>
understood to be polymers derived from monomers comprising at least one allylic<br>
group, which is illustrated below in formula (3).<br><br>
Vinylic polymers are understood to be polymers derived from monomers comprising<br>
at least one vinylic group which is illustrated below in formula (4).<br><br><br>
Acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, and various esters thereof are examples of vinylic<br>
monomers useful in the present invention. Both allylic and vinylic monomers result<br>
in formation of non-peptidic polymer backbones and, as a result, exhibit greater<br>
resistance to proteolytic degradation than PLL.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, a particularly preferred polymer<br>
derived from an allylic monomer for use as the polymeric coating material is<br>
polydiallyldimethylammonium (PDDA), which is generally available as the chloride<br>
salt of the polymer. Like PLL, PDDA is a large polycationic homopolymer that<br>
exhibits a strong net positive charge. The strong net positive charge on the PDDA<br>
molecule is produced by side chain dimethylated ammonium groups on the residues<br>
all along the polymer. The chemical structure of the polymer PDDA is provided<br>
below in formula (5), wherein n is an integer representing the number of monomer<br>
units in the polymer chain. <br>
PDDA is a particularly stable immobilization agent for use as the polymeric<br>
coating material of the present invention. The.cationic groups on PDDA are<br>
quaternary ammoniums, meaning they are much less susceptible to oxidation as<br>
described above. The polymer backbone of PDDA is derived from allylic groups and<br>
contain no peptide bonds, such as those found in the PLL molecule. This absence of<br>
peptide bonds makes PDDA resistant to attack by proteolytic agents, such as trypsin,<br>
that have been proven to break down the PLL polymer chain and reduce<br>
immobilization capabilities.<br>
The increased stability of substrates coated with a polymeric coating material<br>
comprising PDDA has been substantiated by laboratory testing. In one test, a<br>
substrate was coated with a polymeric coating material comprising PDDA, allowed to<br>
dry, and rinsed with deionized water. Accelerated stability studies comparing PLL<br><br>
coated substrates against the PDDA coated substrates at 45 °C predicted exceptional<br>
performance stability in excess of 15 months. This comparison is further illustrated in<br>
Example 2.<br>
In addition, PDDA is advantageous for use in the polymeric coating material<br>
of the present invention because of its inherent hydrophilicity. Surprisingly,<br>
substrates coated with PDDA exhibit increased hydrophilicity in comparison to<br>
substrates coated with the known coating agents, such as PLL. This is an<br>
advantageous effect because small aqueous analytical samples will spread more<br>
evenly across the substrate coated with PDDA. This allows for a more uniform<br>
distribution of the immobilized sample, which facilitates better observation of the<br>
immobilized sample.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the polymer used in the<br>
polymeric coating material is polyallylamine (PAH), which is generally available as<br>
the hydrochloride salt (polyallylamine hydrochloride). As with PDDA, PAH is an<br>
allylic polymer having no peptide bonds. The amine group of PAH is not highly<br>
substituted, such as with PDDA; however, PAH is still useful as a polymeric coating<br>
material according to the present invention. The chemical structure of the polymer<br>
PAH is provided below in formula (6), wherein n is an integer representing the<br>
number of monomer units in the polymer chain.<br><br>
In addition to PDDA and PAH, the polymeric coating material can be a<br>
polymer derived from polymerization of one or more various monomers, particularly<br>
allylic or vinylic monomers. Accordingly, the polymeric coating material can be a<br>
homopolymer, copolymer, or terpolymer. Additionally, the polymeric coating<br>
material can be a physical mixture of one or more homopolymers, copolymers, or<br>
terpolymers. When the polymeric coating material comprises a homopolymer, the<br>
monomers are preferably all cationic monomers; however, when the polymer is a<br>
copolymer, terpolymer, or physical polymer mixture, it is not necessary for all<br><br>
monomers to be cationic. In one preferred embodiment, the polymeric coating<br>
material comprises a mole percentage of about 5% to about 100% cationic polymer or<br>
monomers. More preferably, the polymeric coating material comprises a mole<br>
percentage of about 30% to about 100% cationic polymer or monomers, most<br>
preferably about 50% to about 100% cationic polymer or monomers.<br>
The cationic monomer used in the polymeric coating material can be cationic<br>
in its normal state or can be derivatized from a non-cationic state to a cationic state.<br>
Such derivatization can be through any method generally known in the art, such as<br>
through addition of an ionic functionality, such as an amine or ammonium group.<br>
That is to say, the monomers used to form the polymeric coating material may contain<br>
native cationic groups, as in the case of the monomers used to form PDDA and PAH,<br>
or can contain side groups that can be derivatized to form cationic side groups.<br>
Preferably, the polymeric coating material is derived from at least one<br>
monomer selected from the group consisting of diallyldimethylammonium,<br>
allylamine, methylacrylamidopropyltrimethylammonium, acrylamide, acrylic acid,<br>
methacryloyloxyethyltrimethylammonium, 4-vinyl-benzyltrimethylammonium,<br>
methacrylic acid, hydroxyethylacrylate, methacrylate, methylmethacrylate,	'<br>
hydroxyethylmethacrylate, 4-vinylpyridiniurn, 4-vinyl-l-methylpyridinium, methyl<br>
acrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, 2-ethyl hexyl acrylate,<br>
dimethylaminoethylacrylate, dimethylaminoethylacrylate methyl chloride quaternary,<br>
dimethylaminopropylacrylamide, dimethylaminopropylacrylamide methyl chloride<br>
quaternary, acryloxyethyldimethylbenzyl ammonium, acryloxyethyltrimethyl .<br>
ammonium, dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate,'<br>
methacryloxyethyldimethylammonium,<br>
methacryloxyethyltrimethylbenzylammomum, ethene, ethyleneimine, propene,<br>
styrene, vinyl chloride, isobutylene, trimethyl-2-methacryloylethylammonium,<br>
trimethyl-2-methacrylaminopropylammonium, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the polymeric coating<br>
material comprises a copolymer of a cationic monomer and at least one additional<br>
monomer. Preferentially, the polymeric coating material comprises a copolymer of<br>
diallyldimethylammonium and at least one additional monomer. Most preferably, the<br>
at least one additional monomer comprises a vinylic monomer. In one embodiment,<br><br>
the polymeric coating material comprises a copolymer comprising<br>
diallyldimethylammonium and acrylic acid monomer units. In another embodiment,<br>
the polymeric coating material comprises a copolymer comprising<br>
diallyldimethylammonium and acrylamide monomer units. In another embodiment of<br>
the invention, the polymeric coating material comprises a terpolymer comprising<br>
diallyldimethylammonium, acrylic acid, and hydroxyethylmethacrylate monomer<br>
units.<br>
Preferably, the polymeric coating material according to the present invention<br>
is "non-peptidic", meaning the linkages between monomer units ate predominately<br>
and, preferably substantially, non-peptidic in nature. Preferably, the polymeric<br>
coating material comprises no greater than about 25% peptidic monomeric linkages,<br>
meaning no more than about 25% of the linkages between monomer units comprise<br>
peptide bonds. More preferably, no greater than about 10% of the monomeric<br>
linkages are peptidic linkages, and most preferably no greater than about 5% of the<br>
monomeric linkages are peptide bonds. In certain preferred embodiments, the<br>
polymer coating material is completely free of peptidic linkages.<br>
The polymer used in the polymeric coating material of the present invention is<br>
preferably of relatively high molecular weight. High molecular weight polymers are<br>
preferred because of the high charge density associated with such high molecular<br>
weight. Accordingly, while high molecular weights are preferred, polymers having<br>
lesser molecular weights than as described herein would also be useful according to<br>
the present indention if the lesser molecular weight polymers exhibited a charge'<br>
density sufficiently high to be considered equivalent to the charge density of the high<br>
molecular weight polymers described herein.<br>
The polymer used in the polymeric coating material preferably has a<br>
molecular weight of greater than about 75,000 Da, more preferably greater than about<br>
100,000 Da. In particular embodiments, the polymer has a molecular weight in the<br>
range of about 250,000 to about 750,000 Da, most preferably in the range of about<br>
400,000 Da to about 500,000 Da. Unless otherwise noted, molecular weight is<br>
expressed herein as weight average molecular weight (Mw), which is defined by<br>
formula (7) below<br><br><br>
wherein Ni is the number of polymer molecules (or the number of moles of those<br>
molecules) having molecular weight Mi.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the polymeric coating material comprises<br>
PDDA, as shown above in formula (5), wherein n is an integer between about 500 and<br>
6,000, preferably between about 2,000 and about 5,000, more preferably between<br>
about 3,000 and about 4,000. In another preferred embodiment, the polymeric coating<br>
material comprises PAH, as shown above in formula (6), wherein n is an integer<br>
between about 1,000 and about 15,000, preferably between about 5,000 and about<br>
12,000, more preferably between about 8,000 and about 10,000.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for preparing a<br>
coated substrate that is preferentially adapted for immobilizing a biological sample.<br>
Generally, the method comprises providing a substrate having a surface comprising a<br>
plurality of anionic groups, contacting the substrate with a composition comprising a<br>
solution of anon-peptidic polymeric coating material, as described above, to form a<br>
coating of the polymeric coating material on at least a portion of the surface of the<br>
substrate, and drying the polymeric coating material coated on the substrate surface.<br>
The substrate used according to the method of the invention can be any<br>
substrate.comprising a surface having a plurality of anionic groups and exhibiting a<br>
net negative charge and that would be useful for immobilizing a sample thereon.<br>
Preferably, the substrate is an item useful as a diagnostic tool, an observation tool, an<br>
anti-contamination tool, and other similar tools, the use of which would be apparent to<br>
one of skill in the art.' Preferentially, the substrate used in the method of the invention<br>
comprises glass, metals, ceramics, natural or synthetic polymers, natural or synthetic<br>
fibrous materials, and mixtures thereof. Specific, non-limiting examples of substrates<br>
useful in the method include slides, beads, test tubes, cuvettes, dipsticks, swabs,<br>
gauze, and the like.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the substrate to be coated with the<br>
polymeric coating material is a plate or slide, such as a microscope slide. The slide<br>
can comprise any material generally accepted in the art as being useful as such. For<br><br>
example, the slide can be constructed of glass, ceramic, or a polymer material. When<br>
glass is used, the glass can be any kind of standard glass comprising primarily silicon<br>
dioxide, such as standard soda lime glass. Alternately, the glass can be specialty<br>
glass, such as borosilicate glass.<br>
When the slide is comprised of a polymer, it is preferred that the polymer, in<br>
its normal state, comprises anionic groups capable of interaction with the cationic<br>
groups of the polymeric coating material. In the absence of such groups, however, the<br>
polymer can be derivatized to enhance cell adhesion. Examples of polymer useful as<br>
slides according to this embodiment of the present invention include, but are not<br>
limited to, polystyrene, polyhydroxy methacrylate, polyethylene terephthalate,<br>
polytetrafiuoroethylene, fluorinated ethylene, and polydimethylsiloxane. The<br>
polymer can be a homopolymer, copolymer, terpolymer, or physical polymer mixture.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method of the invention, the polymeric<br>
coating material is in solution, which can be in an aqueous solution or an organic<br>
solution. Any suitable solver known in the art can be used to solubilize the<br>
polymeric coating material, such as deionized water to make an aqueous solution or<br>
an alcohol to make an organic solution. The solution can have a concentration of the<br>
polymeric coating material ranging from about 0.001% (w/v) to about 50% (w/v).<br>
Preferably, the polymeric coating material concentration in the solution is about<br>
0.01%o to about 10%, more preferably about 0.05% to about 2%, still more preferably<br>
about O.P/o to about 1%, and most preferably about 0.15% to about 0.75%.<br>
Particularly surprising according to the present invention, in certain<br>
embodiments, lower concentration solutions can be used to prepare a coated substrate<br>
having an immobilization capability superior to a coated substrate prepared using a<br>
higher concentration solution. For example, in particular embodiments, solutions<br>
having a polymeric coating material concentration of about 0.25% have been shown<br>
especially advantageous for preparing a pre-coated substrate according to the<br>
invention.<br>
As noted above, the polycationic polymers useful in the invention can exist in<br>
a neutral state being coupled with a counterion (for example, chloride in the case of<br>
PDDA and hydrochloride in the case of PAH). When in solution, the ions tend to<br><br>
disassociate. Accordingly, the polymer is in its cationic state, ready for use as an<br>
immobilizing agent according to the present invention.<br>
The present invention also encompasses facilitating the activation of binding<br>
sites on the substrate, thereby increasing the number of anionic sites available for<br>
interacting with the cationic groups on the polymeric coating material. Any method<br>
known in the art for activation of anionic binding sites on a substrate would be useful<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, the pH of the<br>
polymeric coating material can be adjusted. Such adjustment of the pH of the<br>
polymeric coating material can be to raise or lower the pH and can take place<br>
preceding or following the coating of the substrate with the polymeric coating<br>
material. This ability to adjust the pH of the polymeric coating material is particularly<br>
advantageous for increasing the number of anionic binding sites on the substrate<br>
through deprotonization of the substrate when contacted with the polymeric coating<br>
material. Generally, increasing the pH at the substrate surface will promote<br>
deprotonization and increase the number of available anionic binding sites.<br>
Preferentially, the pH of the solution comprising the polymeric coating<br>
material is adjusted to a preferred pH. In one embodiment, the pH of the solution is at<br>
least about 6. In other words, the solution pH is about 8, about 9, about 10, about 11,<br>
about 12, about 13, or about 14. In one preferred embodiment, the pH of the solution<br>
comprising the polymeric coating material is about 8 to about 14, preferably about 8<br>
to about 10.<br>
After contacting the substrate with the polymeric coating material, the<br>
polymeric coating material coated on the substrate is preferably dried prior to further<br>
processing or use. Dryness of the polymeric coating material can be evaluated by any<br>
method generally known in the art. In one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
polymeric coating is at least dried to a point of visual dryness. The visual difference<br>
between a wet polymeric material and a dry polymeric material would be easily<br>
recognizable to one of skill in the art.<br>
Drying of the polymeric coating material can be achieved by any method<br>
generally accepted in the art and can comprise passive drying or active drying {e.g.,<br>
forced air, such as a fan). The polymeric coating material coated on the substrate can<br><br>
be dried at ambient temperature or at an elevated temperature. Ambient temperature,<br>
as used herein, is understood to refer to the temperature of the surrounding<br>
environment In one embodiment, ambient temperature is an average room<br>
temperature, generally considered to be in the range of about 20 °C to about 25 °C<br>
(about 68 °F to about 77 °F). Of course, temperatures below about 20 °C are not to be<br>
excluded by the present invention. In fact, drying could be performed at temperatures<br>
as low as about the freezing temperature of the polymeric coating material.<br>
Drying of the polymeric coating material coated on the substrate can also be<br>
carried out at an elevated temperature. The temperature can be elevated up to about<br>
the temperature wherein further increase would cause degradation of the polymeric<br>
coating material. Accordingly, the polymeric coating material coated on the substrate<br>
can be at least partially dried at a temperature elevated to about 35 °C to about 120 °C<br>
(about 95 °F to about 248 °F), more preferably about 45 °C to about 80 °C (about 113<br>
°F to about 176 °F), most preferably about 50 °C to about 60 °C (122 °F to about 140<br>
°F).<br>
The period of time over which the polymeric coating material coated on the<br>
substrate is dried can vary depending upon the temperature and method of drying.<br>
Generally, the period of time for drying can vary from about 1 minute to about 1 hour,<br>
or longer. For example, when drying of the polymeric coating material coated on the<br>
substrate is carried out at ambient temperature, such drying is preferably carried out<br>
for a period of time of up to about 1 hour, more preferably for a period of time of<br>
about 5 minutes to about 1 hour, and most preferably for a period of time of about 10<br>
minutes to about 30 minutes. Drying at ambient temperature can be continued in<br>
excess of 1 hour without detriment to the polymeric coating material.<br>
When drying of the polymeric coating material coated on the substrate is<br>
carried out at an elevated temperature, such drying is preferably carried out for a<br>
period of time of about 1 minute to about 20 minutes, more preferably for a period of<br>
time of about 2 minutes to about 10 minutes. Drying at elevated temperatures can<br>
take place for a period of time in excess of about 20 minutes so long as the time and<br>
temperature combination would not lead to polymer degradation.<br>
The substrate with the dried polymeric coating material applied thereto is<br>
preferentially rinsed, such as with deionized water, prior to use for immobilizing a<br><br>
sample. Such rinsing is useful for removing disassociated counterfoils as well as<br>
excess polymeric coating material that has not ionically interacted with the substrate.<br>
Drying the polymeric material coated on the substrate prior to rinsing is preferred<br>
since failure to perform the drying step prior to the rinsing step can result in a coated<br>
substrate wherein the coating is incomplete (i.e., "patchy"). Rinsing immediately<br>
after coating leads to washing away of excessive amounts of the polymeric coating<br>
material leaving a coated substrate with limited ability for later immobilization of a<br>
sample. Drying the polymeric coating material coated on the substrate prior to rinsing<br>
(as described above), however, facilitates maximum ionic interaction between the<br>
polymeric coating material and the substrate, which provides a coated substrate<br>
having a maximum amount of polymeric coating material applied thereto (i.e.,<br>
maximum charge density) and therefore having a maximized ability for later<br>
immobilization of a sample.<br>
Maximization of immobilization ability is further possible according to the<br>
present invention in that there is provided a method for application of the polymeric<br>
coating material to the substrate in a controlled manner such that the rinsing step is<br>
completely eliminated. Rinsing is generally included in the coating method to remove<br>
excess polymeric material that has not been immobilized on the substrate through<br>
ionic interactions. This is economically undesirable. First, the rinsing step increases<br>
the time necessary to prepare the coated substrates, particularly in mass production,<br>
such as with microscope slides. Second, rinsing represents a loss of material. Excess<br>
polymeric material applied to the substrate (i.e., polymeric material that does not<br>
adhere to the substrate) is lost in the rinse. Again, in mass production, the amount of<br>
polymeric material lost in rinsing can add up to a substantial cost.<br>
The present invention solves these problems, however. In one embodiment,<br>
the invention provides a method for controlled application of a polymeric material to<br>
a substrate. In this method, the volume of polymeric material needed for maximum<br>
ionic interaction with the ionic groups on the surface of the substrate is calculated,<br>
and only the amount of polymeric material necessary is applied to the substrate.<br>
Accordingly, the substrate is coated with the polymeric material, and there is no<br>
excess volume present to require a rinsing step. Preferably, the polymeric material is<br>
still dried prior to use of the coated substrate for immobilization of a sample.<br><br>
Another surprising aspectof the present invention heretofore unrecognized in<br>
the art is that when the method of the invention specifically excludes subjecting the<br>
substrate surface to a cleaning process prior to contacting the substrate with the<br>
polymeric coating material, the resulting coated substrate exhibits improved<br>
immobilization properties. It is generally accepted in the art that substrates used for<br>
immobilizing samples thereon undergo a vigorous cleaning prior to the<br>
immobilization step. For example, when the substrate is a microscope slide, common<br>
practice is to take the slide, as received from the manufacturer, and wash the slide<br>
prior to proceeding with any immobilization steps. Multiple examples of cleaning, or<br>
washing, processes are provided by Cras, J.J., et al., Biosensors &amp; Bioelectronics, 14<br>
(1999) 683-688.<br>
Cleaning processes to be avoided according to the present invention are<br>
processes comprising the use of chemical recognized as useful for removing organic<br>
compounds from substrate surfaces. Exemplary of the cleaning processes to be<br>
avoided are processes including the use of acids {e.g., hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid,<br>
nitric acid, chromic acid, and chromosulfuric acid), bases {e.g., ammonium hydroxide,<br>
sodium hydroxide, and potassium hydroxide), and organic solvents {e.g., methyl<br>
alcohol, ethyl alcohol, propyl alcohol, toluene, acetone, methylene chloride, and<br>
mineral spirits). Further cleaning processes to be avoided include silanization .<br>
processes designed to expose silane groups on substrates, such as glass. Processes<br>
such as described above (and further described by Cras, J.J., et al.) include a<br>
mechanism of action beyond simple rinsing or wiping of a substrate surface.<br>
Accordingly, process steps, such as rinsing a substrate with deionized water or wiping<br>
the surface of a substrate with a cloth, are not excluded according to the invention. In<br>
other words, the present invention encompasses processes wherein a substrate is<br>
wiped free of dust or rinsed with water prior to coating with the non-peptidic<br>
polymeric material.<br>
Cleaning processes, such as described above, are time consuming and can<br>
include the use of toxic chemicals. The method of the present invention, therefore, is<br>
particularly useful in that such cleaning steps are completely excluded in preferred<br>
embodiments. Accordingly, a microscope slide, for example, can be used as received<br>
from the manufacturer without including any cleaning steps. In other words, in the<br><br>
method of the invention, the method excludes subjecting the substrate to a cleaning<br>
process prior to contacting the substrate with the non-peptidic polymeric coating<br>
material.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, there is provided a pre-coated substrate<br>
particularly useful for immobilizing a biological sample thereon. In one embodiment,<br>
the pre-coated substrate is prepared according to the method described above.<br>
A pre-coated substrate according to the invention utilizing the polymeric<br>
coating material described herein is advantageous in that even when the coating layer<br>
of the non-peptidic polymeric coating material is relatively thin, the pre-coated<br>
substrate is still useful and effective for immobilizing a biological sample. Of course,<br>
the effectiveness of the coating is not limited to such relatively thin coatings, and the<br>
polymeric coating material is also effective with relatively thick coatings. The ability<br>
to prepare a per-coated substrate according to the invention, however, is particularly<br>
advantageous in terms of cost of preparation of such slides. In other words, the ability<br>
to prepare substrates for immobilizing a sample thereon using only a thin coating of<br>
the polymeric coating material is economical in that a reduced amount of the<br>
polymeric material can be used.<br>
The polymeric coating material, when coated on a substrate, can have a<br>
thickness of about 0.005 µm to about 500 µm. Preferably, the polymeric coating<br>
material has a coating thickness of about 0.5 µm to about 100 µm, more preferably .<br>
about 1 µm to about 50 µm. Preferably, the polymeric coating material is coated onto<br>
the substrate as a single layer, meaning there are no intervening layers of a different<br>
material sandwiched between two or more layers of the polymeric coating material of<br>
the invention. However, multi-layer coatings are also envisioned by the present<br>
invention.<br>
The pre-coated substrate of the present invention is particularly useful not only<br>
in tenns of increased shelf-life, but also in terms of ability to immobilize an increased<br>
amount of a biological sample. For example, in one embodiment, the pre-coated<br>
substrate of the invention can be characterized as being capable of immobilizing an<br>
increased average number of cells per surface area over other previously known pre-<br>
coated substrates.<br><br>
In one particular embodiment, the average number of cells per surface area<br>
immobilized on the pre-cpated substrate of the present invention is at least about 10%<br>
greater than the average number of cells per surface area over the same area of a<br>
substrate not coated according to the methods of the present invention that has been<br>
contacted with the same cell sample. Preferably, the average number of cells per<br>
surface area immobilized on the pre-coated substrate of the present invention is at<br>
least about 15% greater than the average number of cells per surface area over the<br>
same area of a substrate not coated according to the methods of the present invention,<br>
most preferably at least about 20% greater.<br>
The increased cell count of biological material associated with a pre-coated<br>
substrate according to the present invention can be determined using various<br>
equipment and methods that would be recognized by one of skill in the art. For<br>
example, it is well known in the art that a hemacytometer can be used to count cells<br>
manually over a representative number of fields of view and thereafter extrapolate a<br>
total number of cells per area.<br>
Cell counts can also be obtained through use of computer-controlled,<br>
automated equipment, such as the FOCALPOINTTM Cell Profiler automated slide<br>
reading system (available from TriPath Imaging, Inc.). The FOCALPOINT™ Cell<br>
Profiler uses specific algorithms to limit the number of cells included in the cell, count<br>
to a population of diagnostically significant value (i.e., counts only actual cells and<br>
disregards artifacts). This cell count is accumulated from approximately 950 to 1,000<br>
images taken"at high resolution in fields of cells evaluated as highest potential. .<br>
Preferably, methods used to obtain cell'counts, such as-described above, are<br>
capable of providing reproducible results and are capable of providing results that can<br>
be evaluated in a statistically significant manner. Accordingly, a biological sample<br>
applied to a substrate can be processed using standardized equipment such that<br>
samples processed using the equipment can be comparatively evaluated. One<br>
example of such processing equipment is a PrepStain Slide Processor (available from<br>
TriPath Imaging, Inc.). The.PrepStain Slide Processor allows for preparation of a<br>
slide with a consistently applied volume of a biological sample, such that the area of<br>
the slide to which the sample is applied is consistent and reproducible. Such<br><br>
processing is particularly useful for evaluating a biological sample applied to a<br>
substrate based on an average cell count per surface area of the substrate.<br>
One particular embodiment of the invention provides a pre-coated substrate<br>
adapted for immobilizing a biological sample for analysis. The substrate can be any<br>
substrate as described herein that is coated with a non-peptidic polymeric coating<br>
material, such as described above. The pre-coated substrate in this embodiment of the<br>
invention is characterized in that it is capable of immobilizing an average number of<br>
cells per surface area. Such immobilization ability can be evaluated based on<br>
immobilization of a standard cell line. For example, the ability of a pre-coated<br>
substrate to immobilize cells can be evaluated using human cervical carcinoma cells,<br>
commonly known as a SiHa cell line. SiHa cells are readily available, such as from<br>
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) identified by ATCC Number HTB-35.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, a pre-coated substrate is<br>
provided wherein the pre-coated substrate surface is capable of immobilizing an<br>
average number of cells per surface area of at least about 20,000 cells/cm when the<br>
pre-coated substrate is contacted with 1 mL of a suspension of cells from the SiHa<br>
cell line. Preferably, the pre-coated substrate surface is capable of immobilizing an<br>
average of at least about 21,000 cells/cm when the pre-coated substrate is contacted<br>
with 1 mL of a suspension of cells from the SiHa cell line, more preferably at least<br>
about 22,000 cells/cm2, most preferably at least about 23,000 cells/cm2.<br>
The improved immobilizing ability of the pre-coated substrate according to the<br>
present invention can be observed through further analytical methods as well. One<br>
method suitable for use in quantifying charge density of the coated substrate would<br>
directly measure charge density in terms of charge density per area of coated<br>
substrate. Another method would indirectly measure charge density by correlation to<br>
another measurable property. For example, the charge density of the polymeric<br>
coating material coated on the substrate can be quantified through spectrographic<br>
measurement of a dye associated with the coated substrate (e.g., adsorbed thereon).<br>
As previously noted, the ability of a coated substrate for adhering a biological<br>
sample (generally being negatively charged) is directly related to the quantity of<br>
excess positive charge on the slide surface. When a negatively charged dye is<br>
associated with the slide surface, the excess positive charge on the slide surface can<br><br>
be quantified through spectrographic analysis of the dye. It is well known in the art<br>
that the absorption of electromagnetic radiation at a given wavelength by a dye is<br>
directly proportional to the concentration of the dye. Therefore, given a proportional<br>
relationship between the anionic dye and the cationic coating material, a measurement<br>
of absorbance of the dye associated with the coating material is a reliable indicator of<br>
the quantity of excess positive charge on the surface of the coated substrate. In other<br>
words, the greater the charge density, the greater the concentration of the dye<br>
adsorbed on the coated substrate, and the greater the dye's absorption of<br>
electromagnetic radiation at a given wavelength. Such a measurement technique is<br>
described by Tadao Sakai and Akihiko Hirose {Talanta 59 (2003) 167-175), which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Multiple dyes known in the art are useful in an analytical technique for<br>
quantifying the charge density of a polymeric coating material coated on a substrate<br>
according to the present invention. A class of dyes particularly useful for quantifying<br>
charge density of a coated substrate in the present invention is xanthene dyes, such as<br>
eosin and tetraiodofluorescein. A particularly useful dye according to the present<br>
invention is Eosin Y (shown below in formula 8) which is, in a neutral aqueous<br>
solution, di-anionic. As a di-anionic species, the dye binds to a mono-cationic species<br>
in a 1:2 relationship.<br><br>
Eosin Y adsorbed onto a cationic polymer, such as PDDA, has a maximum<br>
absorption wavelength (λmax) of about 542 nm. Therefore, absorption measurements<br>
at this wavelength are effective for quantification of excess positive charge on the<br>
surface of a coated substrate. Such measurements can be taken on any analytical<br>
device known in the art as useful for such measurements, such as a UV-Vis<br><br>
spectrophotometer. An example of the measurement of the charge density of a<br>
substrate coated with a polymeric coating material according to the present invention<br>
is provided below in Example 4.<br>
A coated substrate according to the present invention coated with a polymeric<br>
coating material has an excess of positive charge sites, such excess being of a quantity<br>
to effectively bind a biological sample. The polymeric coating material on the coated<br>
substrate is effective for binding a biological sample according to the present<br>
invention when the polymeric coating material exhibits at least a minimally<br>
acceptable charge density. The charge density of a pre-coated substrate prepared<br>
according to the present invention, through quantitative measurement, can easily be<br>
seen to be much greater than the charge density of a pre-coated substrate that is not<br>
prepared according to the present invention. When Eosin Y dye is used in a<br>
quantification method as described above, a pre-coated substrate according to the<br>
present invention would exhibit an absorbance that is at least twice as great as the<br>
absorbance on a substrate not prepared according to the present invention. More<br>
preferably, the absorbance exhibited by a substrate according to the present invention<br>
is at least about three times greater than the absorbance on a substrate not prepared<br>
according to the present invention. Even more preferably, the absorbance exhibited<br>
by a substrate according to the present invention is at least about four times greater<br>
than the absorbance on a substrate not prepared according to the present invention.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
pre-coated glass slide adapted for immobilizing a biological sample for analysis. The<br>
glass slide has a plurality of anionic groups, and the slide is coated with a non-<br>
peptidic polymeric coating material comprising a plurality of cationic groups. The<br>
pre-coated glass slide has a charge density such that when Eosin Y dye is adsorbed on<br>
the coated slide and is thereafter subjected to electromagnetic radiation at a<br>
wavelength of 542 nm, the dye exhibits an absorbance of at least about 0.05, which is<br>
indicative of a minimally acceptable charge density (i.e., excess positive charge) on<br>
the polymeric coating material coating the glass slide. Preferably, the absorbance is at<br>
least about 0.1. Most preferably, the absorbance is at least about 0.15.<br>
As would be known to one of skill in the art, the choice of substrate could<br>
affect the measured absorbance of the dye adsorbed on the coating material used to<br><br>
coat the substrate. Accordingly, if a substrate other than a glass slide was used<br>
according to the present invention, absorbance values could vary from the range<br>
provided above. Nevertheless, as previously noted, a substrate coated according to<br>
the present invention would be would exhibit an absorbance that is at least about two<br>
times greater than the absorbance exhibited when the same substrate is coated by a<br>
method that is not according to the present invention, preferably at least about three<br>
times greater, most preferably at least about four times greater.<br>
The sample for immobilization on the substrate coated with the polymeric<br>
coating material can be any sample having anionic groups capable'of interacting with<br>
the cationic groups of the polymeric coating material and thereby being immobilized<br>
thereon. Preferably, the sample comprises a biological component. Examples of<br>
biological samples for immobilization on the coated substrate according to the present<br>
invention include, but are not limited to, cells, tissue, fluids, nucleic acids, including<br>
polynucleotides and oligonucleotides (e.g., DNA, RNA and fragments thereof),<br>
polypeptides, and proteins.<br>
In one embodiment according to the present invention, a single layer of the<br>
biological sample is immobilized on the substrate coated with the polymeric coating<br>
material. The phrase "single layer" is intended to mean that only one layer of material<br>
is deposited on, and immobilized on, the coated substrate. Accordingly, no further<br>
layers are immobilized in addition to, particularly over, the biological sample, such as<br>
would obstruct viewing and hinder analysis of the biological sample immobilized<br>
directly orr the polymeric coating material on the substrate.<br>
The biological sample can be immobilized on the coated substrate for a variety<br>
of uses. Preferentially, the use is a diagnostic use. For example, the biological<br>
sample could be immobilized for the purposes of extraction from a greater sample, for<br>
additional processing or testing, and for various analytical methods. Specific, non-<br>
limiting examples of uses for the coated substrate include, tissue micro-arrays (TMA),<br>
cytological micro-arrays (CMA), nucleic acid micro-arrays, and other cytological or<br>
histological diagnostics. In addition to such specific uses, the pre-coated substrates of<br>
the present invention could also be used for immobilization of various biological<br>
samples for manual or automated diagnostic assay kits.<br><br>
The pre-coated substrate of the invention can be used in a variety of diagnostic<br>
methods. For example, the pre-coated substrate could be used to immobilize an<br>
antibody that is selective for a particular protein. In another example, the pre-coated<br>
substrate could be used to immobilize a reactive substrate, which would be<br>
particularly useful for isolating a particular protein that is an enzyme capable of acting<br>
on the reactive substrate. Other similar diagnostic uses are also encompassed by the<br>
present invention.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a pre-coated<br>
bead. Preferably, the pre-coated bead is adapted for extracting a biological<br>
component from a sample. The bead in this embodiment has a surface comprising a<br>
plurality of anionic groups capable of interacting with the cationic groups of anon-<br>
peptidic polymeric coating material, such as described above. Accordingly, the bead<br>
has a non-peptidic polymeric coating material overlaying and ionically attached to the<br>
surface of the bead. The coated bead therefore has a plurality of exposed cationic<br>
groups for interacting with the anionic groups of the biological component of interest<br>
in the sample. The biological component can then be immobilized on the surface of<br>
the bead and extracted from the sample.<br>
The pre-coated bead preferentially comprises a material selected from the<br>
group consisting of glass, polymers, silicas, metals, metal oxides, and ceramics, In<br>
one particularly preferred embodiment, the bead comprises a polymer selected from<br>
the group consisting of polystyrene, polyacrylate, polymethacrylate, polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene, polyester, polyurethane, polyamide, polycarbonate,<br>
polydimethylsiloxane, polydialkylsiloxane, cellulose, derivatives thereof, co-polymers<br>
thereof, and combinations thereof.<br>
Pre-coated beads according to the present invention can be used in a variety of<br>
extraction and separation methods, such as have been previously described, and as<br>
would be readily envisioned by one of skill in the art. For example, the pre-coated<br>
beads could be used in various chromatographic separately methods. Additionally,<br>
the pre-coated beads could be inserted into a sample and selectively removed to<br>
extract a biological component therefrom.<br>
Of course, the present invention also encompasses multiple other<br>
embodiments wherein a pre-coated substrate as described herein can be used in a<br><br>
diagnostic method, and inventionis not limited by the present disclosure. For<br>
example, embodiments wherein the pre-coated substrate is a microscope slide have<br>
previously been described herein.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
method of analyzing a biological sample. The method generally comprises providing<br>
a pre-coated substrate adapted for immobilizing a biological sample, wherein the<br>
substrate is coated with a polymeric coating material as described herein,<br>
immobilizing the biological sample on the pre-coated substrate, and analyzing the<br>
biological sample immobilized on the pre-coated substrate.<br>
In one particular embodiment, the step of analyzing the biological sample<br>
immobilized to the pre-coated slide is performed through use of a diagnostic<br>
instrument; however, the present invention also contemplates analysis of the<br>
immobilized sample by an individual without the aid of additional instrumentation<br>
{i.e., through use of the senses alone). Examples of diagnostic instruments useful in<br>
the analysis of the immobilized sample according to the present method include, but<br>
are not limited to, microscopes (such as light microscopes or electron microscopes),<br>
chromatographs, spectrometers, and imaging devices (such as digital cameras, video<br>
cameras, and charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras).<br>
The present invention also encompasses various embodiments wherein the<br>
pre-coated substrate of the invention has uses other than diagnostic uses, as previously<br>
described. For example, in one embodiment, there is provided a device useful for<br>
gathering one or more biological contaminants. In this embodiment, as before, the<br>
substrate comprises a material having a plurality of anionic groups and is coated with<br>
a non-peptidic polymeric coating material. Particularly preferred embodiment in this<br>
embodiment, the substrate comprises a fibrous material. The fibrous material can be<br>
natural or synthetic and can be woven or non-woven. Non-limiting examples of<br>
fibrous materials useful as the biological contaminant gathering device include cotton,<br>
cellulose, and polyethylene.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the biological contaminant gathering device is<br>
selected from the group consisting of gauze, towels, and medical drapes.<br>
Accordingly, the biological contaminant gathering device can be used in transferring<br>
samples, in medical procedures, and in other situations wherein it is useful to collect<br><br>
or gather possible or known biological material to prevent the biological material<br>
from contaminating a material or area. For example, the biological contaminant<br>
gathering device could be used for holding a slide with a DNA sample thereon.<br>
Accordingly, extraneous DNA, such as from the individual handling the slide, is<br>
prevented from contaminating the DNA sample on the slide. Similarly, the<br>
contaminant gathering device could be used around a surgical site to collect biological<br>
material to prevent the material from contaminating the surgical site.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the biological<br>
contaminant gathering device is a glove, such as a surgical glove.' The glove could be<br>
comprised of a fibrous material coated with a polymeric coating material as described<br>
above. Alternately, the glove could be comprised of a natural or synthetic polymer<br>
(e.g., a "rubber" glove).<br>
Further embodiments of the present invention are more distinctly described<br>
according to the following experimental examples.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL<br>
The present invention is more fully illustrated by the following examples,<br>
which are set forth to illustrate the present invention and are not to be construed as<br>
limiting thereof.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Pre-Coating Glass Microscope Slide<br>
With PDDA<br>
In the preparation of a pre-coated glass microscope slide, a solution of PDD A<br>
in deionized water was prepared such that the final concentration of the solution was<br>
1% PDDA (+/- 0.05%) w/v. The pH of the solution was then adjusted to 9.0 (+/- 0.2)<br>
through addition of IN NaOH.<br>
The pH adjusted PDDA solution was placed into a manual slide staining bath.<br>
A manual slide staining rack was loaded with glass microscope slides, and the rack<br>
with the glass microscope slides was added to the PDDA solution in the bath, with the<br>
solution covering the slides up to the frosted edge of the slides. The slides were<br>
allowed to rest in the PDDA solution for approximately 10 seconds. The rack was<br><br>
removed from the bath, the slides-were removed from the rack, and the slides were<br>
placed in an upright, slightly angled position and allowed to dry at ambient<br>
temperature. The slides with the PDDA solution applied thereto were allowed to dry<br>
to visual dryness then rinsed with deionized water. The rinsed slides were again<br>
allowed to dry providing PDDA-coated slides ready for use in analyzing anionic<br>
samples.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Comparison of PDDA-Coated Microscope Slide<br>
With PLL-Coated Microscope Slide<br>
A PDDA solution was prepared and multiple glass microscope slides were<br>
coated using the solution according to Example 1. Multiple additional microscope<br>
slides were coated similarly using PREPSTAIN Slide Coat Reagent (PEL)<br>
(available from TriPath Imaging, Inc.).<br>
The PDDA-coated slides and the PLL-coated slides were each separated into<br>
two groups. One group of PDDA-coated slides was stored for 16 weeks at ambient<br>
temperature. Likewise, one group of PLL-coated slides was stored for 16 weeks at<br>
ambient temperature. A second group of PDDA-coated slides, and a second group of<br>
PLL-coated slides were stored for 5 weeks at room temperature and were stored for 9<br>
additional weeks at 45 °C, for a total of 16 weeks of storage. At the end of the 16<br>
weeks, all four groups of slides were removed from storage for further testing, as<br>
described below. As a comparative in the experimentation, a fresh set of PLL-ooated<br>
slides was prepared according to the same method previously described for<br>
comparison with the Stability Groups.<br>
Slides from each of the five groups described above were subjected to a single<br>
pool of cytological material and subsequently stained using the PREPSTAIN™<br>
method. The slides from all five groups were then compared on the basis of the<br>
amount of cytological material that adhered to the coated surface.<br>
The PLL coated slides coated were noted as having reduced stability, which<br>
decreases with time and temperature. This reduced stability was visibly recognizable<br>
from the decreased amount of adhered and stained cytological material present on the<br>
PLL coated slides. Slide 1, the control slide, was freshly coated with PLL at the time<br><br>
of evaluation and was not subjected to the 16 week testing. Slide 2, coated with PLL,<br>
was allowed to sit at ambient temperature for 16 weeks. A comparison of slide 2 with<br>
slide 1 indicated less stained cytological material adhered to slide 2, which indicated a<br>
degradation of the polymer coating over the 16-week period. Slide 4, also coated with<br>
PLL, sat for 5 weeks at ambient temperature and 9 weeks at 45 °C. The polymer<br>
degradation in this slide was even more apparent. Visual inspection of slide 4<br>
indicated only minimal cytological material adhered to the slide surface (i.e.,<br>
practically no visible stained cytological material).<br>
Slide 3 was coated with PDDA and stored at ambient temperature for 16<br>
weeks. Slide 5 was coated with PDDA, stored at ambient temperature for 5 weeks,<br>
and then stored at 45 °C for 9 weeks. Both of slides 3 and 5 indicated little to no<br>
coating degradation. This was visibly apparent by the complete and even distribution<br>
of stained cytological material adhered to the coated slides. Further, in comparison<br>
with the freshly coated PLL control slide (slide 1), the PDDA slides, even after sitting<br>
for 16 weeks, exhibited deeper staining of the coating, indicating an increased<br>
concentration of polymer (and thus cationic binding sites) on the PDDA-coated slides<br>
in comparison with the PLL-coated slides.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Comparison of Microscope Slides Coated<br>
Using Varying Coating Methodologies<br>
Two sets of microscope slides were coated with PDDA according to the<br>
method of the present invention and a previously described method. A comparison of<br>
the immobilization capabilities of the slides is provided below.<br>
Twelve glass microscope slides were coated with PDDA according to the<br>
present invention. Particularly, a 0.25% (w/v) solution of PDDA in deionized water<br>
was prepared and pH adjusted using NaOH to a final pH of 9.2. The 12 microscope<br>
slides were removed from the packaging as received from the manufacturer and were<br>
specifically not subjected to any cleaning process prior to coating with the PDDA<br>
solution. Next, the uncleaned slides were manually dipped in the PDDA solution,<br>
removed, allowed to dry at ambient conditions to visual dryness, and then rinsed with<br><br>
deionized water to remove any residual PDDA. The rinsed slides were allowed to dry<br>
prior to use.<br>
Twelve additional microscope slides were prepared according to known<br>
preparation methods for comparison with the PDDA-coated slides of the invention.<br>
First, the 12 slides, taken new from the same packaging and manufacturer, were<br>
cleaned according to Method 2 disclosed by Cras, J.J., et al., Biosensors &amp;<br>
Bioelectronics, 14 (1999) 683-688. The cleaned slides were then coated with a 1.0%<br>
aqueous PDDA solution according to the method provided by Seyfert, S., et al,<br>
Biomaterials, 16 (1995) 201-207. Particularly, the cleaned slides were manually<br>
dipped in the 1% PDDA solution, removed from the solution, and immediately rinsed<br>
to remove any residual PDDA solution {i.e., no drying of the coating was performed<br>
prior to rinsing). The rinsed slides were allowed to dry prior to use.<br>
To prepare the cell sample for immobilization of the microscope slides, three<br>
bottles of SiHa control cells (from TriPath Imaging, Inc.) were obtained. The SiHa<br>
cells used in the experimentation were from a single cell line first described in Friedl,<br>
F., Proa Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., 135 (1970) 543-545. The contents of the three bottles<br>
were centrifuged (800g for 10 minutes) to compact the cells into a pellet. The<br>
supernatant was discarded and the cells resuspended in deionized water. The cells<br>
were then recompacted into a pellet by centrifugation (800g for 10 minutes). The<br>
supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended into approximately 30 mL<br>
deionized water. One mL of the cell suspension was transferred into each of 24<br>
conical tubes* and the samples were processed according to the standard protocol<br>
using a TriPath Imaging PRJEPSTAIN™ Slide Processor instrument (the samples were<br>
applied to the slides and stained).<br>
After the slides were stained and coverslipped, the slides were evaluated with<br>
a TriPath Imaging FOCALPOINT™ Slide Profiler. The number of cells on each slide<br>
was counted by the instrument, and the cell count for each microscope slide was<br>
extracted from the instrument's database (cell count being directly proportional to the<br>
number of objects registered by the Slide Profiler.<br>
The cell sample on each microscope slide was prepared as a uniform circle<br>
having a known diameter of 1.3 cm (13 mm). Accordingly, the sample area on each<br>
slide was 1.33 cm2 (132.7 mm2). The number of cells immobilized on each slide is<br><br>
shown below. Table 1 provides the number of cells immobilized on the slides<br>
prepared according to the methods of the present invention, and Table 2 provides the<br>
number of cells immobilized on the slides prepared according to previously described<br>
methods.<br><br><br>
Comparison of the cell counts provided above in Table 1 and Table 2 using<br>
Student's t-distribution reveals a significance level of less than 0.005. Accordingly,<br>
the cell counts illustrate with statistical significance that the PDDA coated slides<br>
prepared according to the present invention immobilize a greater average number of<br>
cells than PDDA coated slides prepared according to previously known methods. In<br>
particular, the PDDA coated slides of the invention immobilized an average number<br>
of cells 22.97% greater than the average number of cells immobilized on the PDDA<br>
coated slides prepared according to the previously known methods.<br>
As noted above, the cell sample area on each slide was 1.33 cm2 (132.7 mm2).<br>
Accordingly, it is possible to calculate the average number of cells immobilized on a<br>
given surface area. With the slides prepared according to the present invention, the<br>
average number of cells per surface area immobilized was 23,475 cells/cm2 (235.2<br>
cells/mm2). By contrast, the slides prepared according to previously known methods<br>
had an average number of cells per surface area immobilized of only 19,090 cells/cm2<br>
(191.3 cells/mm2).<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Analysis of Slides Coated with PDDA<br>
By UV Absorption of Adsorbed Eosin Y dye<br>
Fifteen ESCO microscope slides (catalog number 2951) were obtained. Three<br>
slides were set aside for use as control slides. The remaining twelve slides were<br>
divided into Tour groups of three slides each. Group 1 slides were coated with a 1%<br>
solution of PDDA at a pH of approximately 9.2. The coated slides were allowed to<br>
dry for 1 hour, were rinsed with deionized water, and allowed to dry for an additional<br>
1 hour. Group 2 slides were coated with a 1% solution of PDDA at a pH of<br>
approximately 9.2. The coated slides were immediately rinsed with deionized water<br>
(no drying of the PDDA coating), and the rinsed slides were allowed to dry for 1 hour.<br>
Group 3 slides were coated with a 1% solution of PDDA at a pH of approximately<br>
5.3. The coated slides were allowed to dry for 1 hour, were rinsed with deionized<br>
water, and allowed to dry for an additional 1 hour. Group 4 slides were coated with a<br>
1% solution of PDDA at a pH of approximately 5.3. The coated slides were<br>
immediately rinsed with deionized water (no drying of the PDDA coating), and the<br><br>
rinsed slides were allowed to dry for 1 hour. Group 5 slides (the control slides) were<br>
not coated.<br>
All slides in the above 5 groups were prepared for treatment by placing each<br>
slide into a Hettich microscope slide-holder base and positioning a Hettich settling<br>
chamber on the slides to isolate a portion of the slide. The isolated portion of the<br>
surface of each slide was treated with 200 µL of a 5% w/v Eosin Y solution in<br>
deionized water for 1 minute. The dye solution was removed with vacuum suction,<br>
and each slide was treated twice with 2.5 mL of deionized water, allowing each rinse<br>
to stand for 1 minute before removing with vacuum suction. Each slide was then<br>
treated twice with 2.5 mL isopropanol, allowing each rinse to stand for 1 minute<br>
before removing with vacuum suction. Each slide was then removed from the slide<br>
holder and allowed to dry for at least 10 minutes. Each slide treated with the dye had<br>
a circular stained portion having an area of about 240 mm2, the center of the circular<br>
stained portion being approximately 17.5 mm from the unfrosted short end of the<br>
slide.<br>
Spectrographic analysis was performed using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer as<br>
542 nm. The instrument was zeroed using a plain, untreated, uncoated glass slide.<br>
The measured absorbance for each slide (provided below in Table 6) indicated a<br>
significant difference between slides coated with no drying of the polymeric coating<br>
prior to rinsing and those coated by the method of the present invention. Eosin Y<br>
adsorption onto the positively-charged surfaces of the PDDA-coated slides was much<br>
greater on 'the slides which were allowed to dry at ambient temperature for about 1<br>
hour prior to being rinsed with deionized water.<br><br><br>
A direct comparison of the slides coated without drying (Group 2) and the<br>
slides coated according to the methods of the present invention (Group 1), both at pH<br>
9.2, indicates that the excess positive charge was about 4.3 (+/- 0.8) times greater on<br>
the slides prepared according to the present invention. Similarly, a direct comparison<br>
of the slides coated without drying (Group 4) and the slides coated according to the<br>
methods of the present invention (Group 3), both at pH 5.3, indicates that the excess<br>
positive charge was about 4.7 (+/- 3.0) times greater on the slides prepared according<br>
to the present invention. The contribution of the glass itself to the adsorption of Eosin<br>
Y dye is negligible, as indicated by the near-zero absorption values for the uncoated<br>
slides (control slides). The adsorption of Eosin Y dye can therefore be attributed<br>
solely to the positive charges carried by the PDDA coated on the slides.<br>
