				<td>WETTING AGENTS AND DISPERSANTS,<br>
THEIR PREPARATION AND USE<br>
The present invention relates to addition compounds and<br>
salts thereof that are suitable as wetting agents and<br>
dispersants and as dispersion stabilizers. The<br>
invention further relates to processes for preparing<br>
these addition compounds, to their use as wetting<br>
agents and dispersants and dispersion stabilizers for<br>
organic and inorganic pigments and also fillers in<br>
organic and aqueous systems, and to pulverous or<br>
fibrous solids coated with such wetting agents and<br>
dispersants and amenable to incorporation into liquid<br>
systems.<br>
In solution or dispersion in a liquid, wetting agents<br>
lower the surface tension or interface tension and in<br>
that way increase the wetting capacity of the solution.<br>
Dispersants are suitable in general for stabilizing<br>
particulate solids in binders, paints, pigment pastes,<br>
plastics and plastics blends, for reducing the<br>
viscosity of such systems, and for improving the flow<br>
properties. Dispersion stabilizers are suitable in<br>
general for stabilizing dispersions that have already<br>
been produced.<br>
In order to be able to incorporate solids into liquid<br>
media, high mechanical forces are necessary. It is<br>
usual to use dispersants in order to lower the<br>
dispersing forces and in order to minimize the total<br>
input into the system of energy needed to deflocculate<br>
the particulate solids, and hence also to minimize the<br>
dispersing time. Dispersants of this kind are surface-<br>
active substances of anionic, cationic or neutral<br>
structure. These substances, in a small amount, are<br>
either applied directly to the solid or added to the<br>
dispersing medium. It is also known that, following<br>
complete deflocculation of the agglomerated solids into<br>
primary particles, after the dispersing operation,<br>
there are also instances of reagglomeration, thereby<br>
completely or partly nullifying the dispersing effort.<br>
As a consequence of the inadequate dispersing and/or as<br>
a result of reagglomeration there are unwanted effects,<br>
such as viscosity increase in liquid systems, shade<br>
drift and losses of gloss in paints and coatings, and a<br>
reduction of mechanical strength in plastics.<br>
A multiplicity of different substances are nowadays<br>
used as dispersants for pigments and fillers. Besides<br>
simple compounds of low molecular mass, such as<br>
lecithin, fatty acids and their salts, and alkylphenol<br>
ethoxylates, for example, complex structures, too, are<br>
used as dispersants. Such structures especially include<br>
amino-functional and amide-functional systems, which<br>
find broad use within the dispersants. In EP 158 406<br>
and EP 208 041 use is made, for example, for the<br>
purpose of dispersing pigments, of amino- and amide-<br>
functional poly- and oligocopolymers based on<br>
polyamines and polycaprolactones, in which all the<br>
reactive amino groups have been converted into amide<br>
groups. These products, however, constitute complex<br>
reaction mixtures which are difficult to reproduce and<br>
have very poor solubilities in solvents and inadequate<br>
compatibilities with binders and other resins.<br>
Good results can already be achieved with polymeric<br>
dispersants based on polyisocyanates, as are described<br>
for example in EP 0 154 678 Al or EP 0 318 999 A2.<br>
EP 0 154 678 Al describes dispersants which are<br>
obtained by addition of monohydroxy compounds with<br>
polyisocyanates. The monohydroxy compounds contain at<br>
least one aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic group<br>
of at least one -O- and/or -COO- group. The monohydroxy<br>
compounds are preferably polyesters. In particular,<br>
polyesters formed from aliphatic lactones and aliphatic<br>
monoalcohols are employed. As a further compound for<br>
addition with polyisocyanates it is preferred to use<br>
di- or trifunctional polyethylene glycols.<br>
In EP 0 318 999 A2 the addition compounds known from<br>
EP 0 154 678 Al were modified by the additional<br>
incorporation of silicone-containing and/or urethane-<br>
containing groups. The resultant dispersants have more<br>
universal compatibility.<br>
WO 2006/132910 A2 describes polyurethane-based<br>
dispersants which are composed of a linear polyurethane<br>
main chain with various possible side chains. The<br>
compounds described are characterized in that they<br>
contain at least one or, preferably, two or more<br>
reactive carbon-carbon double bonds per molecule.<br>
Consequently the compounds, after the dispersing<br>
operation, can be crosslinked either through Michael<br>
addition of polyamines or else through free-radical<br>
reaction.<br>
EP 0 335 197 Al discloses polyisocyanate polyaddition<br>
compounds which act as dispersants. They are prepared<br>
using, among other components, polyesters or, in<br>
particular, polyethylene oxides.<br>
EP 0 731 148 A2 discloses the use of polyisocyanate<br>
addition products which contain hydrophilic polyether<br>
chains as suitable dispersants for the incorporation of<br>
solids into aqueous coating materials. The dispersants<br>
are prepared from the reaction of 5 - 100 equivalent-%<br>
(based on the isocyanate groups of the isocyanate<br>
component) of a monohydric alcohol component (B) and<br>
also, where appropriate, three further, optional<br>
components with a polyisocyanate. The monohydric<br>
alcohol component (B) is composed of at least one<br>
monohydric polyether alcohol having an ethylene oxide<br>
unit content of 50% to 99.5% by weight, which may be<br>
modified by addition reaction with epsilon-caprolactone<br>
in an amount of up to 40% by weight, based on the<br>
weight of the monohydric alcohol.<br>
In EP 0 826 753 Al, dispersants comparable with those<br>
of EP 0 731 148 A2 are prepared in a solvent-free way.<br>
In this case, as a difference, 0 to 75 equivalent-% of<br>
the ethylene oxide-based monofunctional polyether<br>
component (B), where appropriate with modification with<br>
epsilon-caprolactone, is used. In addition there may be<br>
three further, optional components reacted with the<br>
isocyanate component. The polymers of the pigment<br>
formulation that are disclosed in EP 0 827 973 Al also<br>
contain high fractions of ethylene oxide in the<br>
polyalkylene oxide fraction.<br>
WO 1997/26984 Al describes reaction products of<br>
polyisocyanates with a component Y-R-X. In the<br>
component Y-R-X the hydroxyl- or amino-functional group<br>
X is attached via the bridge R to a nitrogen-containing<br>
heterocycle Y in such a way that a nitrogen atom of the<br>
heterocycle forms a tertiary amine with the bridge R.<br>
The addition of the tertiary amines Y-R-X with<br>
polyisocyanates produces dispersants which are used in<br>
compositions with high solids content.<br>
US 2004/0242727 Al discloses special radiation-curable<br>
dispersants for producing tack-free inks and coatings.<br>
The compounds in question are the reaction products of<br>
polyisocyanates with at least one radiation-curable<br>
component, preferably with (meth)acrylates, especially<br>
polycaprolactone acrylates, and one or more further<br>
components.<br>
US 2004/0260013 Al discloses dispersants with acidic<br>
groups which are composed of a linear polyurethane<br>
backbone of low molecular mass diisocyanates with side<br>
chains composed of poly(C2-C4)alkylene oxides. Of the<br>
alkylene oxide side chains, at least 60%, preferably<br>
70% or even 80% by weight, based on the total weight of<br>
the alkylene oxides, must have been synthesized from<br>
ethylene oxide units.<br>
DE 101 59 315 Al describes dispersants which are<br>
obtainable from diisocyanates and which contain an<br>
alkyl-capped oligoalkylene oxide radical. The<br>
oligoalkylene oxide radical necessarily comprises one<br>
or more ethylene oxide groups and may in addition also<br>
contain a further, branched alkyl radical, although<br>
this is not preferred.<br>
WO 2004/104064 A2 concerns a dispersant comprising low<br>
molecular mass diisocyanates for non-aqueous systems,<br>
said dispersant being composed of a linear polyurethane<br>
backbone with polyester, polyether and/or polyacrylate<br>
side chains.<br>
But the dispersants presented above often represent<br>
only partial solutions to the problems depicted at the<br>
outset. On account of numerous possible side reactions<br>
in the course of their preparation, many of these<br>
products represent very complex and poorly defined<br>
reaction mixtures, with the resulting disadvantages,<br>
such as very restricted compatibilities and poor<br>
solubilities. Consequently these reactions can be<br>
carried out only in highly dilute solutions, and the<br>
end products have very low solids contents of, in<br>
general, below 50% and in many cases even only 20-30%.<br>
The large quantities of solvent that are consequently<br>
introduced by way of these products, however, lead to<br>
considerable problems in modern coating systems, since,<br>
as part of the ongoing efforts to produce<br>
environmentally compatible systems, there is a need to<br>
reduce the amount of solvent as far as possible (e.g.<br>
in the case of pigment concentrates, high-solids and<br>
ultra-high-solids coatings), or even to abandon organic<br>
solvents entirely. Products which contain polyester<br>
radicals based on hydroxycarboxylic acids and/or their<br>
lactones, such as epsiIon-caprolactone and/or delta-<br>
valerolactone, are problematic on account of their<br>
crystallization tendency, and exhibit problems with<br>
poor solubility and compatibility. Particularly in the<br>
case of decorating paints based on aromatic-free white<br>
spirits, the dispersants of the prior art can be used<br>
either not at all or only with restrictions, owing to<br>
poor compatibility.<br>
In view of the multiplicity of organic and inorganic<br>
pigments and filling materials that are used today,<br>
sufficient stabilization of the particulate solids to<br>
be dispersed, by desorption-stable occupancy of the<br>
surface, is not adequately ensured. Consequently there<br>
are instances of agglomeration, since the efficient<br>
steric shielding that is necessary is lacking.<br>
On account of the high quantities of such dispersants<br>
that are used, relative to the solids to be dispersed<br>
(in the case of carbon black, up to 100% of dispersant<br>
relative to pigment) , it is frequently the case in the<br>
finished coating film that there are impairments<br>
affecting the intercoat adhesion and the resistance<br>
properties, especially water resistance, solvent<br>
resistance and scratch resistance.<br>
The present invention is therefore based on the object<br>
of eliminating the above-described disadvantages of<br>
known dispersants, in other words of developing<br>
additives which, while effectively stabilizing pigments<br>
or fillers, lower the millbase viscosity of the paints,<br>
pastes or plastics formulations to an extent such that<br>
processing with a high degree of filling is possible,<br>
without detriment to the resistance properties of the<br>
cured coatings. At the same time, especially in the<br>
case of pigment pastes and filler pastes, a broad<br>
compatibility must be ensured, so that they can be used<br>
in many different binders and coating materials.<br>
Furthermore, it is necessary for the dispersing<br>
additives of the invention that are used to allow the<br>
pastes, or the binders prepared with these pastes, to<br>
be mixed with one another without flocculation.<br>
A further aim is to provide dispersing additives which<br>
also act as wetting agents. Lastly, the additives<br>
provided ought also to act as dispersion stabilizers,<br>
especially as emulsion stabilizers.<br>
Furthermore, the intention is that the addition<br>
compounds provided in accordance with the invention<br>
should solve the problems associated with the<br>
incorporation of lactones into the dispersants of the<br>
prior art. High fractions of lactone, especially<br>
caprolactone, frequently lead, as already described<br>
above, to partially crystalline compounds with a high<br>
viscosity, something which adversely affects the<br>
processing properties especially in the case of the<br>
production of pigment pastes and filler pastes. Such<br>
lactone-based dispersants also possess the solubility<br>
problems outlined above. Similar disadvantages are also<br>
known for dispersants which contain very high<br>
polyethylene oxide fractions.<br>
These addition compounds, furthermore, are of<br>
surprisingly broad usefulness both in polar and in<br>
apolar binder systems. They strongly lower the<br>
viscosity of the millbase during dispersing and so make<br>
it possible to prepare formulations having a high<br>
solids fraction.<br>
Surprisingly it has become apparent that a marked<br>
improvement in the resistance properties in conjunction<br>
with effective dispersing and stabilizing of pigments<br>
or filler particles in binders, pigment pastes or<br>
plastics formulations can be achieved if the addition<br>
compounds of the invention, described below, are used.<br>
The objective is achieved through the provision of<br>
addition compounds and salts thereof which are<br>
obtainable by reacting<br>
(a) one or more polyisocyanates having at least<br>
two isocyanate groups per molecule with<br>
(bl) one or more compounds of the formula (la)<br>
Y-XH (la)<br>
where<br>
XH is a group that is reactive towards<br>
isocyanates and<br>
Y is a monomeric or polymeric group that is<br>
not reactive towards isocyanates, that<br>
contains no tertiary amino groups and that<br>
comprises one or more aliphatic,<br>
cycloaliphatic and/or aromatic groups,<br>
the compound of the general formula (la)<br>
possessing a number-average molar mass Mn of<br>
less than 20 000 g/mol and<br>
at least 55 mol% of the compounds of the<br>
formula (la) possessing a number-average<br>
molecular weight Mn of 150 to 10 000 g/mol<br>
and which represent XH-functionalized<br>
polyalkylene oxides which contain 4 0 to<br>
100 mol% of alkylene oxide units having at<br>
least three carbon atoms, based on the total<br>
amount of alkylene oxide units,<br>
with the proviso that 20% to 90% of the<br>
isocyanate groups of component (a) are<br>
reacted with the compounds of the formula<br>
(la),<br>
(b2) one or more compounds of the formula (lb)<br>
G-(XH)a (lb)<br>
where n is 2 to 4 and G is an aliphatic,<br>
cycloaliphatic and/or aromatic group which<br>
contains at least 2 carbon atoms, has no<br>
tertiary amino groups and has a number-<br>
average molecular weight Mn of not more than<br>
3000, and which can contain -0-, -COO-,<br>

in an amount such that 0% to 60%, preferably<br>
0 to 45% and more preferably 0 to 40% of the<br>
NCO groups of the polyisocyanates originally<br>
used are reacted,<br>
with the proviso that, as a result of the<br>
reactions (bl) and (b2) , a total of at least 20%<br>
and not more than 90%, preferably 30 to 65% and<br>
more preferably 40 to 60% of the isocyanate groups<br>
of the polyisocyanates originally used have<br>
undergone reaction, and<br>
(cl) one or more compounds of the general formula<br>
(Ha)<br>
Z-Q (Ha)<br>
in which Q is -NH2, -NHR or OH, in which R is<br>
a linear or branched alkyl group having 1 to<br>
18 carbon atoms, and<br>

one tertiary amino group and containing no<br>
isocyanate-reactive groups, and<br>
(c2) optionally one or more compounds of the<br>
general formula (lib)<br>

with the proviso that at least 10% of the<br>

with component (cl).<br>
Component (a)<br>
For preparing the addition compounds of the invention<br>
use is made as component (a) of polyisocyanates having<br>
at least two isocyanate groups per molecule.<br>
Isocyanates of this kind are known from the prior art<br>
in the present technical field.<br>
The compounds in question are more preferably<br>
oligomeric or polymeric derivatives of monomeric<br>
diisocyanates that contain biuret, urethane, uretdione<br>
and/or isocyanurate groups. Monomeric diisocyanates of<br>
this kind are, for example, 1,4-diisocyanatobutane,<br>
hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), 2-methyl-l,5-diiso-<br>
cyanatopentane, 1,5-diisocyanato-2,2-dimethylpentane,<br>
2,2,4- or 2,4,4-trimethyl-l,6-diisocyanatohexane, 1,10-<br>
diisocyanatodecane, 1,3- and 1,4-diisocyanatocyclo-<br>
hexane, 1,3- and 1,4-bis(isocyanatomethyl)cyclohexane,<br>
1-isocyanato-3,3,5-trimethyl-5-isocyanatomethylcyclo-<br>
hexane (isophorone diisocyanate, IPDI), 4,4'-<br>
diisocyanatodicyclohexylmethane, tolylene diisocyanate<br>
(TDI), 1-isocyanato-1-methyl-4(3)-isocyanatomethyl-<br>
cyclohexane, bis(isocyanatomethyl)norbornane and 1,3-<br>
and 1,4-bis(2-isocyanatoprop-2-yl)benzene (TMXDI) or<br>
mixtures of such diisocyanates. Alternatively, the<br>
stated monomeric isocyanates may be used as they are,<br>
alone or in a mixture, or in a mixture with their<br>
oligomeric or polymeric derivatives containing biuret,<br>
urethane, uretdione and/or isocyanurate groups. In<br>
accordance with the invention it is possible to use one<br>
or more monomeric, oligomeric or polymeric poly-<br>
isocyanates.<br>
The polyisocyanates must possess an average<br>
functionality of at least 2. The average functionality<br>
is preferably at least 2.5 and more preferably at least<br>
3. Particular preference is given to the above-<br>
described derivatives of HDI, TDI and/or IPDI, and<br>
especially those of TDI,<br>
Examples of polyisocyanates of this kind are those<br>
which are obtainable, for example, by addition of<br>
diisocyanates with polyols, such as Desmodur L from<br>
Bayer, or those obtainable by biuret reaction from<br>
diisocyanates, such as the commercial product<br>
Desmodur N from Bayer, or else the polyisocyanates with<br>
an isocyanurate parent structure that are obtainable by<br>
cyclization of diisocyanates, such as the commercial<br>
products Desmodur HL and Desmodur IL from Bayer, the<br>
commercial products Polurene KC or Polurene HR from<br>
SAPICI, or trimeric isophorone diisocyanate<br>
(isocyanurate T1890 from Chemische Werke Hiils) . Further<br>
examples of polyisocyanates available as commercial<br>
products are Desmodur VL (polyisocyanate based on<br>
diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI), Bayer AG) , Desmodur<br>
Z4370 (polyisocyanate based on isophorone diisocyanate<br>
(IPDI), Bayer AG) , Desmodur N3400 (aliphatic HDI uret-<br>
dione, Bayer AG), Thanecure T9 (aromatic TDI uretdione,<br>
TSE Industries), Crelan VP LS 2147 and Crelan VP LS<br>
2347 (aliphatic IPDI uretdiones, Bayer AG), Polurene KD<br>
(polyisocyanurate based on tolylene diisocyanate (TDI),<br>
SAPICI), Uronal RA.50 (polyisocyanurate based on TDI,<br>
from Galstaff), Polurene A (polyisocyanate based on TDI<br>
trimethylolpropane (TMP), SAPICI), Polyurene MC (poly-<br>
isocyanate based on TMP-IPDI, SAPICI), Polyurene MD.70<br>
(polyisocyanate based on TMP-TDI-MDI, SAPICI). These<br>
commercial products are frequently not in the pure form<br>
of a polyisocyanate, but instead in the form of<br>
mixtures of polyisocyanates of similar structure. As<br>
polyisocyanates in the present invention it is<br>
preferred to use trimerization products - that is,<br>
products containing one or more isocyanurate<br>
groups - of diisocyanates based on hexamethylene<br>
diisocyanate (HDI), isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI)<br>
and/or tolylene diisocyanate (TDI).<br>
By the abovementioned "average functionality of at<br>
least 2" is meant that in terms of the isocyanate<br>
groups the commercial products have the stated<br>
functionality of at least 2. "Functionality of 3", for<br>
example, means that a molecule contains on average 3<br>
free isocyanate groups.<br>
The average functionality can be determined<br>
experimentally by determining the number-average<br>
molecular weight Mn and the NCO number as described in<br>
the example section of the present invention, and<br>
calculating therefrom the NCO equivalent weight. The<br>
average functionality is the ratio formed from the<br>
number-average molecular weight and the NCO equivalent<br>
weight. Preferably the average molecular weight of the<br>
polyisocyanates is at least 200, more preferably at<br>
least 300, very preferably at least 500. Preferably the<br>
average functionality is 2.5 to 10, more preferably at<br>
least 3, such as 3 to 6, for example.<br>
Component (bl)<br>
The polyisocyanates of component (a) are reacted in<br>
accordance with the invention with compounds of<br>
component (bl) of the above formula (la).<br>
The compounds of the formula (la) are characterized in<br>
that they contain exactly one group XH that is reactive<br>
towards isocyanate groups. The compounds of the formula<br>
(la) react irreversibly via their reactive XH group<br>
with the isocyanates.<br>
For the Y group of the compound of the general formula<br>
(la) , it is the case that it is not reactive towards<br>
isocyanates, i.e. that they contain no active hydrogen<br>
atoms according to Zerewitinoff. This means in<br>
particular that the group Y is free from the above-<br>
mentioned groups XH.<br>
Examples of XH are OH, NH2, NHR, SH or COOH, R being a<br>
branched or unbranched alkyl group having 1 to 18<br>
carbon atoms. Preferably XH is OH, NH2 or NHR. With<br>
particular preference these functional groups are<br>
hydroxyl groups, since these compounds are readily<br>
obtainable and/or available commercially and the<br>
resulting reaction products are highly soluble in<br>
solvents which are employed in the context of the later<br>
use of the additives in accordance with the invention.<br>
The groups Y that are not reactive towards isocyanates<br>
may contain the heteroatoms 0, S, Si and/or N and/or<br>
ether, urethane, carbonate, amide and/or ester groups.<br>
In the groups Y it is possible for halogen, preferably<br>
fluorine and/or chlorine, to be substituted for<br>
hydrogen.<br>
As compounds of the formula (la) it is possible to use<br>
aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and/or araliphatic compounds.<br>
It is also possible to use mixtures of such compounds,<br>
in other words at least two different compounds of the<br>
formula (la). The aliphatic or araliphatic compounds of<br>
the formula (la) may be straight-chain or branched.<br>
They may be saturated or unsaturated. Saturated<br>
compounds are preferred, however.<br>
Examples of compounds of the formula (la) are straight-<br>
chain or branched alcohols such as methanol, ethanol,<br>
butanol, ethylhexanol, decanol, isotridecyl alcohol,<br>
lauryl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, isobornyl alcohol,<br>
benzyl alcohol, propargyl alcohol, oleyl alcohol,<br>
linoleyl alcohol, oxo-process alcohols, neopentyl<br>
alcohol, cyclohexanol, fatty alcohols, alkylphenols,<br>
monophenyl diglycol, alkylnaphthols, phenylethanol,<br>
hydroxy-functional vinyl compounds such as, for<br>
example, hydroxybutyl vinyl ether, hydroxy-functional<br>
acrylates or methacrylates such as, for example,<br>
hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate,<br>
hydroxybutyl (meth)acrylate, and also polyolefin<br>
polyols, such as unhydrogenated or hydrogenated,<br>
hydroxy-functional polybutadienes, polypropylenes,<br>
ethylene/butylene copolymers or polystyrenes having an<br>
average functionality of 1 to 3. Examples of<br>
corresponding commercial products are the hydroxy-<br>
terminated hydrogenated polybutadienes, available under<br>
the name Polytail® from Mitsubishi Chemical, or the<br>
hydroxy-terminated ethylene/butylene copolymers Kraton®<br>
Liquid L-1203, L-1302 and L-2203 from Kraton Polymers,<br>
or the liquid polybutadienes available as NISSO-PB from<br>
Nippon Soda Co., or the saturated, long-chain, linear,<br>
largely primary alcohols available from Baker Petrolite<br>
as Unilin alcohols, having chain lengths of up to C50<br>
and molecular weights of 375 to 700 g/mol, and their<br>
ethoxylates, which are obtainable under the Unithox®<br>
name. Further examples are described inter alia in<br>
EP-A-154 678. Of the aforementioned hydroxy compounds,<br>
those containing no polymerizable double bonds are<br>
preferred.<br>
As compounds of the formula (la) it is also possible to<br>
use those which contain ester, ether, urethane,<br>
carbonate, amide and/or siloxane groups or combinations<br>
of these groups. They may therefore, for example, be<br>
polyethers, polyesters, polyurethanes, polycarbonates,<br>
polysiloxanes or, for example, mixed polyether-<br>
polyesters.<br>
Polyesters can be prepared for example by reacting<br>
dicarboxylic acids and also their esterifiable<br>
derivatives such as, for example, anhydrides, acid<br>
chlorides or dialkyl esters such as dimethyl esters or<br>
diethyl esters by reaction with diols and mono. The<br>
esterification may be carried out in bulk or else by<br>
means of azeotropic esterification in the presence of<br>
an entraining agent. Examples of dicarboxylic acids are<br>
succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, glutaric<br>
acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, pimelic acid, phthalic<br>
acid or dimerized fatty acids and their isomers and<br>
hydrogenation products. Examples of diols are as<br>
follows: ethylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-<br>
propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, neopentyl<br>
glycol, cis-1,2-cyclohexanedimethanol, trans-1,2-cyclo-<br>
hexanedimethanol, and also polyglycols based on<br>
ethylene glycol and/or propylene glycol.<br>
Polyesters of the formula (la) may also be those which<br>
can be obtained by polycondensation of one or more,<br>
optionally alkyl-substituted, hydroxy carboxylic acids<br>
and/or ring-opening polymerization of the corresponding<br>
lactones such as propiolactone, valerolactone or<br>
caprolactone, for example, by means of a monohydroxy<br>
starter component, as described in EP-A-154 678 (US-A-<br>
4 647 647). If used, preferably they possess a number-<br>
average molecular weight Mn of 150 to 5000 g/mol. As a<br>
starter component it is possible in principle to use<br>
any compounds other than those given as compounds of<br>
the formula (la). The monofunctional alcohols used as<br>
starter components possess preferably 1 to 30, more<br>
preferably 4 to 14, carbon atoms. Mentioned by way of<br>
example are n-butanol, longer-chain, saturated and<br>
unsaturated alcohols, such as propargyl alcohol, oleyl<br>
alcohol, linoleyl alcohol, oxo-process alcohols,<br>
cyclohexanol, phenylethanol, neopentyl alcohol,<br>
ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and glycerol, but<br>
also fluorinated alcohols, hydroxy-functional<br>
polydialkylsiloxanes, hydroxy-functional vinyl<br>
compounds such as, for example, hydroxybutyl vinyl<br>
ether, hydroxy-functional acrylates or methacrylates<br>
such as, for example, hydroxyethyl aerylate,<br>
hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxybutyl (meth)acrylate,<br>
and hydroxy-functional polyalkylene glycol acrylates<br>
and methacrylates. It is also possible to convert<br>
alcohols of the above-described kind and substituted<br>
and unsubstituted phenols, by alkoxylation in<br>
accordance with known processes, using alkylene oxides<br>
such as, for example, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide,<br>
butylene oxide and/or styrene oxide, into<br>
polyoxyalkylene monoalkyl, polyoxyalkylene monoaryl,<br>
polyoxyalkylene monoaralkyl and polyoxyalkylene<br>
monocycloalkyl ethers and to use these hydroxy<br>
polyethers in the manner described above as starter<br>
components for the lactone polymerization. In each case<br>
it is also possible to use mixtures of the<br>
aforementioned compounds, examples being lactone<br>
mixtures, of e-caprolactone and 8-valerolactone, for<br>
example. The lactone polymerization is carried out by<br>
known methods, initiated by BF3, p-toluenesulphonic<br>
acid or dibutyltin dilaurate, for example, at<br>
temperatures of about 70°C to 180°C. Preferably,<br>
however, component (bl) contains less than 35 mol% of<br>
compounds of the formula (la) which contain<br>
copolymerized lactones or their hydroxycarboxylic acid<br>
analogues. With particular preference their fraction is<br>
less than 20 mol%. With very particular preference<br>
component (bl) contains no compounds of the general<br>
formula (la) that contain copolymerized lactones or<br>
their hydroxycarboxylic acid analogues.<br>
Preferred compounds of the formula (la) are hydroxy-<br>
functional polyethers, hydroxy-functional polyesters,<br>
hydroxy-functional polyether-polyesters and/or<br>
aliphatic and/or cycloaliphatic alcohols having 2 to 3 0<br>
carbon atoms, some of whose hydrogen atoms may have<br>
been replaced by halogen and/or aryl radicals.<br>
As compounds of the formula (la) it is also possible to<br>
use monofunctional polysiloxanes such as, for example,<br>
monoamino- or monohydroxy-functional polydialkyl-<br>
siloxanes containing hydroxy1 groups not attached to<br>
silicon atoms, or to use aminoalkylpolysiloxanes, which<br>
where appropriate may have been polyether-modified<br>
and/or polyester-modified. In this case the respective<br>
amino-functional compounds carry primary or secondary,<br>
but not tertiary, amino groups. It is preferred to use<br>
hydroxyalkylpolydimethylsiloxanes having number-average<br>
molecular weights Mn of 400 to 8000 g/mol, more<br>
preferably 400 to 5000 g/mol and very preferably 400 to<br>
2000 g/mol.<br>
As compounds of the formula (la) it is also possible to<br>
use polyurethanes, polyether-polyurethanes, polyester-<br>
polyurethanes and/or polyether-polyester-polyurethanes,<br>
which can be obtained by addition reaction of<br>
diisocyanates with dihydroxy compounds in the presence<br>
of monofunctional starter components.<br>
As a diisocyanate for synthesizing the compounds of the<br>
formula (la) that contain urethane groups it is<br>
possible to use the aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and/or<br>
aromatic diisocyanates known per se from polyurethane<br>
chemistry and having 4 to 15 carbon atoms, such as<br>
tetramethylene, hexamethylene, trimethylhexamethylene,<br>
dodecamethylene, isophorone, tolylene and diphenyl-<br>
methane diisocyanates, methylenebis(4-cyclohexyl iso-<br>
cyanate) or 1,4-cyclohexanebis(methyl isocyanate). As<br>
hydroxy compounds for synthesizing the compounds of<br>
formula (la) that contain urethane groups it is<br>
preferred to use diols having 2 to 12 carbon atoms,<br>
polyoxyalkylene glycols and dihydroxy-functional<br>
polyesters having preferred number-average molecular<br>
weights Mn of not more than 2000 g/mol. As monohydroxy-<br>
functional starter component it is possible to use<br>
alcohols having up to 30 carbon atoms, such as already<br>
described for preparing the polyesters of formula (la),<br>
but also the hydroxy polyesters and hydroxy polyethers<br>
that are described as a compound of formula (la) . The<br>
polyesters preferably have a number-average molecular<br>
weight Mn of 300 to 5000 g/mol, and the polyethers one<br>
of 200 to 2000 g/mol.<br>
The radical Y can also contain carbonate groups such as<br>
are obtained by reaction with open-chain and/or cyclic<br>
carbonates in accordance with the prior art.<br>
Suitability is possessed for example by carbonate-<br>
modified linear polyesters or polycarbonate diols such<br>
as are used in preparing polyurethane. Examples are<br>
described in US 410 152 9, EP 0358 555, or<br>
WO 02/085507. Suitable carbonates are, for example,<br>
aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, araliphatic and/or aromatic<br>
esters of carbonic acid, such as dialkyl carbonates<br>
such as dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate or<br>
diphenyl carbonate, for example, catechol carbonate or<br>
cyclic alkylene carbonates. Particular suitability is<br>
possessed by cyclic alkylene carbonates having 5- or<br>
6-membered rings, which if desired may be substituted.<br>
Preferred substituents are aliphatic, cycloaliphatic<br>
and/or aromatic groups having up to 30 carbon atoms.<br>
Examples of suitable cyclic alkylene carbonates are<br>
ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, glyceryl<br>
carbonate, trimethylene carbonate, 4-methyltrimethylene<br>
carbonate, 5-methyltrimethylene carbonate, 5,5-<br>
dimethyltrimethylene carbonate, 5,5-diethyltrimethylene<br>
carbonate or 5-methyl-5-propyltrimethylene carbonate.<br>
The radical Y may carry further groups which behave<br>
inertly during the formation of the adduct, such as,<br>
for example, the carboxamide group (-NHCO-),<br>
unactivated double bonds or urea moieties (-NHCONH-).<br>
The fraction of the compounds of the formula (la) that<br>
carry such groups should preferably be below 40 mol%,<br>
more preferably below 5 mol%, based on all of the<br>
compounds used of the formula (la). Particularly<br>
preferred compounds are those containing none of these<br>
groups at all.<br>
The ester, ether, urethane, carbonate and/or siloxane<br>
groups that may be present can be in a block structure<br>
(for example poly(ethylene oxide-block-propylene oxide-<br>
block-epsilon-caprolactone), form a gradient or else be<br>
arranged randomly.<br>
As a compound of the formula (la) it is also possible<br>
to use polyacrylic esters and/or polymethacrylic esters<br>
having on average one isocyanate-reactive group, such<br>
as are obtained by anionic, cationic or free-radical<br>
polymerization of acrylic esters and/or methacrylic<br>
esters. Preference is given to monohydroxy-functional<br>
compounds. Monohydroxy-functional polyacrylic esters<br>
and polymethacrylic esters are those containing on<br>
average one hydroxyl group in the molecule. Such<br>
compounds have already been used in this field of the<br>
art for preparing other dispersants, as are described<br>
for example in US-A-4 032 698 or EP 318 999. Such<br>
polyacrylates have preferably a number-average<br>
molecular weight Mn of 300 to 20 000 g/mol, more<br>
preferably 500 to 10 000 g/mol. They can be arranged in<br>
a block structure or else randomly or form a gradient.<br>
The carboxyl group of the monomeric acrylates and/or<br>
methacrylates can be esterified with, for example,<br>
aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and/or aromatic alcohols such<br>
as methanol, butanol, cyclohexanol, 2-ethylhexanol,<br>
lauryl, stearyl, isobornyl or benzyl alcohol or with<br>
ether alcohols such as 2-methoxyethanol,<br>
2-phenoxyethanol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, or<br>
glycidol, with polyester alcohols such as hydroxy-<br>
functional polycaprolactone, or with alkoxypolyalkylene<br>
glycols such as methoxypolyethylene glycol or<br>
methoxypolypropylene glycol. Methoxypolypropylene<br>
glycols are preferred as alkoxypolyalkylene glycols.<br>
The number-average molecular weight Mn of the<br>
esterification component is preferably below<br>
2000 g/mol. For preparing the hydroxy-functional<br>
polyacrylates and/or polymethacrylates it is also<br>
possible to use mixtures of different monomers<br>
described above. For preparing these polyacrylates<br>
and/or polymethacrylates it is also possible as<br>
comonomers to use vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate,<br>
vinyl ethers such as vinyl ethyl ether, styrene,<br>
vinyltoluene and/or vinylcyclohexane. The resulting<br>
copolymers have been synthesized from preferably not<br>
more than 50 mol% of comonomers that have no acrylic<br>
functionality.<br>
Also possibly functioning as compound of the formula<br>
(la) are hydroxy-functional poly-2-alkyl-2-oxazolines<br>
or poly-2-alkyl-2-oxazines. Monohydroxy-functional<br>
compounds are used with preference. As the person<br>
skilled in the art is aware, poly-2-alkyl-2-oxazolines<br>
or poly-2-alkyl-2-oxazines are obtained by cationic,<br>
ring-opening polymerization of 2-alkyl-2-oxazolines or<br>
2-alkyl-2-oxazines with initiators such as para-<br>
toluenesulphonic acid, methyl tosylate or methyl<br>
triflate, for example. The oxazolinium or oxazinium end<br>
groups that result from the living cationic<br>
polymerization mechanism can be converted by alkaline<br>
hydrolysis via amino ester end groups into the more<br>
stable hydroxy amides. An alternative route to the<br>
preparation of monohydroxy-functional poly-<br>
2-alkyl-2-oxazolines or poly-2-alkyl-2-oxazines is the<br>
polymerization with 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-N-meth-<br>
yl-2-oxazolinium trifluoromethanesulphonate as the<br>
initiating species (A. Grofi, G. Maier, O. Nuyken,<br>
Macromol. Chem. Phys. 197, 2811-2826 (1996)). Through<br>
the choice of the alkyl substituent it is possible to<br>
control the compatibility: for example, the water-<br>
solubility of poly-2-ethyl-2-oxazoline makes it<br>
suitable for highly polar systems, whereas<br>
poly-2-lauryl-2-oxazoline, for example, is compatible<br>
in apolar systems. Where block copolymers are formed<br>
from 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline and 2-lauryl-2-oxazoline, the<br>
polymers are notable for a particularly broad<br>
compatibility. Such poly-2-alkyl-2-oxazolines or<br>
poly-2-alkyl-2-oxazines possess preferably a number-<br>
average molecular weight Mn of 300 to 20 000 g/mol,<br>
more preferably 500 to 10 000 g/mol.<br>
As compounds of the formula (la) it is also possible to<br>
use mono-XH-functional polyalkylene oxides. These can<br>
be obtained, for example, by alkoxylating the other<br>
compounds described as compounds of the formula (la) ,<br>
such as alkanols, cycloalkanols, phenols or the above-<br>
described hydroxy polyesters, with alkylene oxides such<br>
as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide,<br>
styrene oxide or mixtures thereof. In the case of mixed<br>
polyethers, they may be arranged randomly, as a<br>
gradient or in blocks. These polyethers advantageously<br>
have a number-average molecular weight (Mn) in the<br>
range from about 100 to 10 000, preferably from 150 to<br>
5000 and more preferably from 200 to 3500 g/mol.<br>
Preference is given to polyethers based on ethylene<br>
oxide, propylene oxide, and also butylene oxide and<br>
mixtures thereof. Further preferred are monohydroxy-<br>
functional polyoxyalkylene monoalcohols such as allyl<br>
polyethers, for example Polyglycol A 350, Polyglycol<br>
A 500, Polyglycol A 1100, Polyglycol A 11-4, Polyglycol<br>
A 20-10 or Polyglycol A 20-20 from Clariant AG or<br>
Pluriol® A 010 R, Pluriol® A 11 RE, Pluriol® A 13 R,<br>
Pluriol® A 22 R or Pluriol® A 23 R from BASF AG, vinyl<br>
polyethers, for example Polyglycol V 500, Polyglycol<br>
V 1100 or Polyglycol V 5500 from Clariant AG,<br>
polyoxyethylene monoalcohols prepared starting from<br>
methanol, such as Pluriol® A 350 E, Pluriol® A 500 E,<br>
Pluriol® A 750 E, Pluriol® A 1020 E, Pluriol® A 2000 E<br>
or Pluriol® A 5010 E from BASF AG, polyoxypropylene<br>
monoalcohols prepared starting from alkanol, such as<br>
Polyglycol B01 / 20, Polyglycol B01 / 40, Polyglycol<br>
B01 / 80, Polyglycol B01/120 or Polyglycol B01 / 240<br>
from Clariant AG or Pluriol® A 1350 P or Pluriol®<br>
A 2000 P from BASF AG, and polyalkoxylates started<br>
using different fatty alcohols and having a variable<br>
degree of alkoxylation, of the kind known to the<br>
skilled worker under the trade names Lutensol® A,<br>
Lutensol® AT, Lutensol® AO, Lutensol® TO, Lutensol® XP,<br>
Lutensol® XL, Lutensol® AP and Lutensol® ON from BASF<br>
AG. Preference is given to using polyoxyalkylene<br>
monoalcohols which contain ethylene oxide and/or<br>
propylene oxide and/or butylene oxide groups and which<br>
may have been modified with styrene oxide. Particular<br>
preference is given to using polyoxyalkylene<br>
monoalcohols such as, for example, Polyglycol B 11/50,<br>
Polyglycol B 11/70, Polyglycol B 11/100, Polyglycol<br>
B 11/150, Polyglycol B 11/300 or Polyglycol B 11/700<br>
from Clariant AG, Pluriol® A 1000 PE, Pluriol®<br>
A 1320 PE, or Pluriol® A 2000 PE from BASF AG or<br>
Terralox WA 110 from DOW Chemicals, which are<br>
polyoxyalkylenes prepared starting from butanol, formed<br>
from ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, and with a<br>
terminal OH group. Of the aforementioned compounds,<br>
preference is given to those which contain no<br>
polymerizable double bonds.<br>
Component (bl) must contain at least 55 mol%,<br>
preferably at least 7 5 mol% and more preferably<br>
100 mol% of compounds of the general formula (la) which<br>
are XH-functionalized polyalkylene oxides and which<br>
possess a number-average molecular weight Mn of 150 to<br>
10 000 g/mol, preferably at least 3 00 g/mol, more<br>
preferably at least 600 g/mol and very preferably at<br>
least 1000 g/mol. The upper limit for the maximum<br>
molecular weight Mn is preferably not more than<br>
5000 g/mol, more preferably not more than 3000 g/mol,<br>
and very preferably not more than 2000 g/mol. These<br>
compounds must contain alkylene oxide units with at<br>
least three carbon atoms in an amount of 40 to<br>
100 mol%, preferably at least 55 mol%# more preferably<br>
at least 60 mol%, very preferably at least 65 mol% and,<br>
in one particularly preferred embodiment, 100 mol%,<br>
based on the total amount of alkylene oxide units. The<br>
alkylene oxide units having at least three carbon atoms<br>
derive preferably from propylene oxide and butylene<br>
oxide. Particular preference is given to the use of<br>
polypropylene oxide-based compounds, and very<br>
particular preference to monohydroxy-functional<br>
polypropylene oxides prepared starting from butanol. A<br>
suitable comonomer having less than three carbon atoms<br>
is ethylene oxide. These compounds are prepared<br>
preferably, as described in the preceding section, by<br>
alkoxylation of monohydroxy-functional starter<br>
compounds. They preferably contain no polyester<br>
fractions, in particular no polyester fractions derived<br>
from lactones or hydroxy carboxylic acids, and are<br>
preferably free from polymerizable double bonds.<br>
In applications requiring a broad compatibility, as in<br>
the universal paste sector, for example, it is<br>
frequently advantageous to use addition compounds which<br>
are prepared with mixtures of different compounds of<br>
the formula (la). Where, for example, the addition<br>
compounds of the invention are to be used in universal<br>
tinting pastes for aqueous and apolar systems, a<br>
combination of water-soluble with apolar compounds of<br>
the formula (la) is an advantage.<br>
The number-average molecular weight Mn of the compound<br>
Y-XH is smaller than 20 000 g/mol and is preferably not<br>
more than 10 000 g/mol, more preferably not more than<br>
5000 g/mol, very preferably not more than 3500 g/mol,<br>
and better still not more than 2000 g/mol. The minimum<br>
molecular weight Mn of Y-XH is preferably 100 g/mol,<br>
more preferably 150 g/mol, very preferably 200 g/mol,<br>
and most preferably 400 g/mol. Preferably less than<br>
50 mol% of the compounds used of formula (la) ought to<br>
possess a number-average molecular weight of less than<br>
100 g/mol, more preferably less than 25 mol%, very<br>
preferably less than 15 mol% and most preferably<br>
0 mol%.<br>
In the reaction with the monofunctional compounds of<br>
the formula (la), 20% to 90%, preferably 20% to 70% and<br>
more preferably 25% to 60% of the free NCO groups<br>
originally used are reacted.<br>
Component (b2)<br>
The compounds of the general formula (lb) G-(XH)n with<br>
n = 2 to 4 differ from those of the formula (la)<br>
essentially in that they contain two, three or four<br>
functional groups XH, defined independently of one<br>
another, which are reactive towards isocyanates. Of the<br>
groups XH, those which are preferred are the same as<br>
under formula (la). The number-average molecular weight<br>
Mn of the compounds of the formula (lb) is less than<br>
3000 g/mol and it is preferably not more than<br>
2500 g/mol, more preferably not more than 2000 g/mol,<br>
very preferably not more than 1500 g/mol. The minimum<br>
molecular weight Mn of compounds of the formula (lb) is<br>
preferably 100 g/mol, more preferably 150 g/mol, very<br>
preferably 300 g/mol and ideally 600 g/mol.<br>
Examples of di-, tri- and tetra-functional compounds of<br>
the formula (lb) are diols, triols and tetraols and,<br>
respectively, diamines, triamines and tetramines<br>
without tertiary amino groups having 2 to 12 carbon<br>
atoms, dihydroxydialkyl sulphides and dihydroxy<br>
sulphones. Examples are butanediol, hexanediol,<br>
cyclohexanedimethanol, neopentyl glycol, ethylene<br>
glycol, glycerol, trimethy1olpropane, pentaerythritol<br>
fatty acid dialkanol amides, thiodiglycol di(4-hydroxy-<br>
phenyl) sulphone, and also hydroxy-functional<br>
polybutadienes having an average functionality of 2 to<br>
3. One preferred group of compounds of the formula (lb)<br>
are polyoxyalkylene glycols more preferably having<br>
alkylene groups having 2 to 4, very preferably with<br>
two, carbon atoms, and preferably having number-average<br>
molecular weights Mn in the range from 200 to<br>
2000 g/mol and more preferably 400 to 1500 g/mol.<br>
Ethoxylates with 3 hydroxyl groups are obtained, for<br>
example, by polymerization using trifunctional alcohols<br>
as a starter component. Preferred polyoxyalkylene<br>
glycols are polyethylene glycols.<br>
As di-, tri- or tetra-functional compounds of the<br>
formula (lb) it is also possible to use those which can<br>
be obtained by polymerizing one or more lactones, as<br>
already mentioned, by means of di-, tri- or<br>
tetrahydroxy starter components. Preferably these<br>
polyesterpolyols have a number-average molecular weight<br>
Mn of 500 to 2000 g/mol. A preferred starter component<br>
is butanediol or ethylene glycol. Also suitable,<br>
however, are the abovementioned diols, triols or<br>
tetraols as starter components. Preferably component<br>
(b2) contains less than 50 mol%, more preferably less<br>
than 20 mol% and very preferably no polyester polyols,<br>
in particular no polyester polyols based on lactones or<br>
their hydroxycarboxylic acid analogues.<br>
As polyfunctional compounds of the formula (lb) it is<br>
also possible to use polyurethanes, polyether-<br>
polyurethanes, polyester-polyurethanes and/or<br>
polyether-polyester-polyurethanes, which can be<br>
obtained by addition reaction of a diisocyanate with a<br>
dihydroxy compound in analogy to the corresponding<br>
monofunctional compounds according to formula (lb).<br>
Preferably these urethane-containing compounds<br>
according to formula (lb) have an average functionality<br>
of not more than 2 and a number-average molecular<br>
weight of 300 to 2500 g/mol, preferably of 500 to<br>
1500 g/mol.<br>
The di-, tri- or tetra-functional compounds of the<br>
formula (lb) produce crosslinking between the reaction<br>
products of polyisocyanate and monofunctional compounds<br>
of the formula (la) . The starting products can be used<br>
for example in amounts such that the di-, tri- or<br>
tetra-functional compounds of the formula (lb)<br>
constitute the centre of the molecule, and such that<br>
attached to them are the polyisocyanates whose<br>
remaining isocyanate groups have been or are reacted<br>
with monofunctional compounds of the formula (I). It is<br>
of course also possible for a certain overcrosslinking<br>
or undercrosslinking to be present.<br>
In the case of the reaction with the di-, tri- or<br>
tetra-functional compounds of the formula (lb) it is<br>
the case that 0% to 60%, preferably 0% to 45% and more<br>
preferably 0% to 40% of the NCO groups originally used<br>
are reacted.<br>
Particularly preferred products are obtained entirely<br>
without the use of di-, tri- or tetra-functional<br>
compounds of the formula (I).<br>
In total at least 20%, more preferably at least 25%,<br>
and not more than 90%, preferably not more than 80%,<br>
more preferably not more than 70%, of the NCO groups of<br>
the component (a) polyisocyanate that were originally<br>
used are reacted with the compounds of the formula (I).<br>
The reaction of the polyisocyanates with different<br>
compounds of the formulae (la) and (lb) can be carried<br>
out in one single reaction step or in two or more<br>
reaction steps in succession. This can take place in<br>
any order. In many cases, however, it is advantageous<br>
to react the polyisocyanate in succession with the<br>
components in the order first of monofunctional<br>
compounds (formula (la)) and then of polyfunctional<br>
compounds (formula (lb)). The isocyanate addition can<br>
take place, depending on the reactivity of the<br>
individual reactants, within the temperature range that<br>
is customary for this kind of reaction, from room<br>
temperature up to about 150°C. For the purposes of<br>
acceleration and reduction of side reactions it is<br>
possible to use the customary prior art catalysts such<br>
as tertiary amines, for example triethylamine, di-<br>
methylcyclohexylamine, N-methylmorpholine, N,N' -di-<br>
me thy lpiperazine, 2-(dimethylaminoethoxy)ethanol, di-<br>
azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and similar compounds, and<br>
also, in particular, organometallic compounds such as<br>
titanic esters, for example, iron compounds such as<br>
iron(III) acetylacetonate, for example, tin compounds,<br>
such as tin diacetate, tin dioctoate, tin dilaurate or<br>
the dialkyl derivatives of tin dialkyl salts of<br>
aliphatic carboxylic acids such as dibutyltin<br>
diacetate, dibutyltin dilaurate or the like. These<br>
catalysts are customarily used in amounts of 0.0001 to<br>
0.1 part by weight per 100 parts by weight of<br>
polyisocyanate.<br>
Component (cl)<br>
Component (cl) is represented by the general formula<br>
(Ila) as Z-Q. The group Z is an organic basic radical<br>
having at least one tertiary amino group that contains<br>
no NCO-reactive groups. The radical Z is preferably an<br>
aliphatic or cycloaliphatic group having at least one<br>
tertiary amino group, where appropriate in the form of<br>
a tertiary ring nitrogen atom of a heterocyclic ring<br>
system. The tertiary amino group, or the heterocyclic<br>
ring system with tertiary ring nitrogen, may be<br>
attached to the group Q directly or via an organic<br>
bridging group ("spacer"). The spacer via which the<br>
tertiary amino group or the heterocyclic ring system<br>
with tertiary ring nitrogen may be attached to the<br>
group Q comprises preferably 2 to 10, more preferably 2<br>
to 5, carbon atoms. With particular preference it is an<br>
alkylene group having 2 to 10, very preferably 2 to 5,<br>
carbon atoms, or a polyether group having the same<br>
number of carbon atoms. The group Q stands for NH2, OH<br>
or NHR, in which R stands for a linear or branched<br>
alkyl group having 1 to 18 carbon atoms.<br>
One group of compounds which can be used as compounds Z-Q<br>
of the formula (Ila) is composed of monohydroxy amines<br>
having a tertiary amino group, or aliphatic diamines having<br>
a tertiary amino group and a primary or secondary amino<br>
group, such as, for example, {N,N-diethylamino)ethanol,<br>
(N,N-dimethylamino)ethanol, (N,N-dimethylamino)propanol,<br>
2-(diethylamino)ethylamine, 3-(dimethylamino)propylamine,<br>
3-(diethylamino)propylamine, N,N-diethyl-1,4-butanediamine,<br>
l-diethylamino-4-aminopentane, of which 3-(dimethyl-<br>
amino)propylamine and (N,N-diethylamino)ethanol are<br>
preferred.<br>
In the case of a further group, Z is a monocyclic or<br>
bicyclic heterocyclic group, of which a ring nitrogen<br>
atom is attached to the group Q preferably via an<br>
alkylene group having 2 to 5 carbon atoms. Preferred<br>
heterocycles are triazole, pyrimidine, imidazole,<br>
pyridine, morpholine, pyrrolidine, piperazine,<br>
piperidine, benzimidazole, benzothiazole and/or<br>
triazine and more preferably imidazole and<br>
benzimidazole. These heterocycles may contain one or<br>
more substituents. They preferably carry one of the<br>
following groups: alkyl and/or alkoxy groups having 1<br>
to 6, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms (in which case a<br>
methoxy group is preferred), or tertiary amino groups.<br>
It is preferred that the heterocyclic groups are<br>
attached via a ring nitrogen atom and an alkylene<br>
group, preferably with 2 to 5 carbon atoms, to the<br>
group Q. The heterocyclic group may of course, besides<br>
this ring nitrogen atom, also contain further<br>
heteroatoms, including further ring nitrogen atoms.<br>
Further examples of the compounds of the formula (Ila)<br>
are N-(3-aminopropyl)imidazole, N-(3-aminopropyl)<br>
morpholine, N-(2-aminoethyl)piperidine, 1-methyl-<br>
piperazine, aminoethylpiperazine. It is characteristic<br>
of these compounds that they contain per molecule at<br>
least 1 reactive group with at least 1 Zerewitinoff<br>
hydrogen atom which is able to react with the NCO<br>
groups, and that they additionally possess a nitrogen-<br>
containing basic group without reactive hydrogen. These<br>
basic groups are characterized in the prior art by<br>
their pKa value (cf. US-A-3,817,944; 4,032,698 and<br>
4,070,388). Preference is given to compounds with basic<br>
groups having a pKa value of 2 to 14, more preferably<br>
of 5 to 14 and very preferably of 5 to 12. The pKa<br>
value can be taken from tabular works. The limiting<br>
values indicated above refer to the measurement of the<br>
pKa value at 25°C in a 0.01 molar concentration in<br>
water. These basic groups likewise endow the addition<br>
compounds of the invention with basicity.<br>
Compounds of the formula Z-Q can be obtained, for<br>
example, by reacting a (meth)acrylate or epoxide with<br>
an amine or nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring<br>
system. Examples of reaction products between a<br>
(meth)acrylate and a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic<br>
ring system are the reaction products of the<br>
hydroxyethyl esters and hydroxypropyl esters of<br>
(meth)acrylic acid with the nitrogen-containing<br>
heterocyclic ring structure, the following structural<br>
elements being attached to the nitrogen of the<br>
heterocyclic ring structure:<br>
-propionic acid 2-hydroxyethyl ester, -propionic acid<br>
2-hydroxypropyl ester, -2-raethylpropionic acid 2-<br>
hydroxyethyl ester and -2-methylpropionic acid 2-<br>
hydroxypropyl ester, and ethoxylated and/or<br>
propoxylated derivatives thereof. The acrylic esters<br>
are preferred.<br>
The reaction with amines proceeds analogously.<br>
Through reaction of an epoxide with an amine or with a<br>
nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compound it is<br>
likewise possible to prepare the compounds Z-Q. In the<br>
course of the reaction, the group Q formed is a<br>
secondary hydroxyl group, and a tertiary amino group is<br>
formed on the nitrogen atom that takes part in the<br>
reaction.<br>
Component (c2)<br>
Compounds M-Q according to formula (lib) that are used<br>
are compounds in which M is an organic radical having a<br>
number-average molar mass of not more than 1000 g/mol,<br>
preferably not more than 500 g/mol and more preferably<br>
300 g/mol, containing at least one tertiary amino group<br>
and at least one OH group, and in which Q is NH2, NHR<br>
or OH (where R is a linear or branched alkyl group<br>
having 1 to 18 carbon atoms).<br>
M preferably contains 1 to 10, more preferably 1 to 5<br>
and very preferably 1 to 3, such as for example 2, OH<br>
groups. Primary OH groups are preferred.<br>
Examples of M-Q with tertiary amino groups and OH<br>
groups are triethanolamine, N-methyldiethanolamine,<br>
aminopropylmethylethanolamine, 3-(diethylamino)propane-<br>
1,2-diol, tetrakis(2-hydroxypropyl)ethylenediamine,<br>
bis(2-hydroxyethyl)dodecylamine and bis(2-hydroxy-<br>
ethyl)octadecylamine.<br>
The compounds of component (c2) can be prepared in<br>
analogy to the compounds of component (cl) by reaction<br>
of (meth)acrylates or epoxides with amines. Where, for<br>
example, glycidol is employed as the epoxide, which<br>
already contains a primary hydroxyl group, then, by<br>
reaction with a secondary amine, a tertiary amine and a<br>
secondary hydroxyl group are formed additionally, and<br>
so such adducts carry a primary and a secondary<br>
hydroxyl group and also a tertiary amino group.<br>
Nitrogen-containing heterocycles can be reacted<br>
analogously with (meth)acrylates and epoxides.<br>
For preparing the addition compounds of the invention,<br>
it is also possible to use mixtures of different<br>
starting materials such as mixtures of (a)<br>
polyisocyanates and/or components (bl) and/or (b2)<br>
and/or components (cl). Individual representatives of<br>
the two or more components (a), (bl), (b2) or (cl) may<br>
be used in a superstoichiometric or substoichiometric<br>
amount. The proportions, however, are preferably chosen<br>
such that the isocyanate groups undergo substantially<br>
complete reaction; this means that preferably at least<br>
90%, more preferably at least 95%, very preferably at<br>
least 98%, and ideally all of the isocyanate groups<br>
have undergone reaction.<br>
By virtue of the basic groups the addition compounds<br>
are capable of forming salts. For the purposes of the<br>
invention, as dispersants, they can also be used in the<br>
form of the corresponding salts. In certain cases, by<br>
means of such partial or complete salination it is<br>
possible to obtain an improvement in activity and/or an<br>
enhanced solubility or compatibility. Even in<br>
applications where the basicity of the products is a<br>
disrupting factor, as for example, in acid-catalysed<br>
systems, it is frequently possible to achieve<br>
improvements by means of partial or complete<br>
neutralization.<br>
The salts are obtained from the resultant reaction<br>
product by neutralization with one or more organic or<br>
inorganic acids or by quaternization. The amount of<br>
acid to be used is guided by the field of use.<br>
Depending on each individual case, the acid components<br>
may be used in equimolar, substoichiometrie or super-<br>
stoichiometric amounts. From polycarboxylic acids, for<br>
example, it is also possible to use up to one<br>
equivalent of polycarboxylic acid per basic group to be<br>
neutralized in order to give the products an acidic<br>
character. It is preferred to carry out approximately<br>
equimolar neutralization. Preference is given to salts<br>
with organic carboxylic acids or acidic phosphoric<br>
esters. Examples of such acidic phosphoric esters are<br>
given in EP 893 155, EP 417 490 and US 5 143 952.<br>
Examples of carboxylic acids are aliphatic and/or<br>
aromatic carboxylic acids such as short-chain or long-<br>
chain fatty acids, formic acid, acetic acid,<br>
neodecanoic acid, oleic acid, tall oil fatty acid,<br>
stearic acid, ricinoleic acid, natural saturated or<br>
unsaturated plant or animal fatty acids and their<br>
maleic anhydride adducts, maleic acid, fumaric acid,<br>
succinic acid, dodecenylsuccinic acid, 5-norbornene-<br>
2,3-dicarboxylic acid, adipic acid, glutaric acid,<br>
benzoic acid, nitrobenzoic acid, phthalic acid,<br>
tetrahydrophthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic<br>
acid, dimerized or trimerized fatty acids, citric acid<br>
and abietic acid.<br>
The addition compounds of the invention preferably<br>
contain no ethylenically unsaturated groups.<br>
Furthermore, the addition compounds of the invention<br>
are preferably prepared from components which are not<br>
lactone-based, especially not caprolactone-based; in<br>
other words, from components (a), (bl), optionally<br>
(b2), (cl) and optionally (c2) , which have themselves<br>
been prepared without the use of any lactones, in<br>
particular no caprolactones (or the corresponding<br>
hydroxycarboxylic acid).<br>
When the polyisocyanates whose use is preferred are<br>
employed that have on average at least 2.5 free<br>
isocyanate groups, branched, i.e. non-linear,<br>
polyurethane structures are formed. Accordingly, non-<br>
linear addition compounds are particularly preferred in<br>
accordance with the invention.<br>
The preparation of the addition compounds of the<br>
invention can be carried out, according to viscosity,<br>
in bulk or in the presence of suitable solvents,<br>
solvent mixtures or other suitable carrier media.<br>
Suitable solvents or carrier media are all those which<br>
are not reactive under the chosen reaction conditions<br>
or whose reactivity towards the coreactants is<br>
negligible and in which the reactants and the reaction<br>
products are at least partly soluble. Examples are<br>
hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylene, aliphatic and/or<br>
cycloaliphatic benzine fractions, chlorinated<br>
hydrocarbons such as chloroform, trichloroethane,<br>
cyclic and acyclic ethers such as dioxane,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, polyalkylene glycol dialkyl ethers<br>
such as dipropylene glycol dimethyl ether, esters of<br>
monocarboxylic, dicarboxylic or polycarboxylic acids,<br>
such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, butyrolactone,<br>
dimethyl 2-methylglutarate, triacetin, phthalates or<br>
other plasticizers, di- or polycarboxylic esters,<br>
dialkyl esters of C2 to C4 dicarboxylic acids, referred<br>
to as "Dibasic Esters", alkyl glycol esters such as<br>
ethyl glycol acetate, methoxypropyl acetate, ketones<br>
such as methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexanone, acetone,<br>
acid amides such as dimethylformamide,<br>
N-methylpyrrolidone, and the like. The solvent or<br>
solvents and/or carrier media are advantageously<br>
selected to take account of the planned field of use.<br>
For example, for addition compounds of the invention<br>
for use in water-thinnable coating systems, or for<br>
coating pigments in aqueous suspension following the<br>
pigment synthesis, it is preferred to use solvents<br>
which are totally or partly water-dilutable. Where the<br>
products are to be used, for example, in applications<br>
where the presence of VOCs (volatile organic compounds)<br>
is unwanted, the formulation should as far as possible<br>
be solvent-free or in appropriately high-boiling<br>
carrier media.<br>
Depending on the field of application it is possible<br>
for the solvents used for the synthesis to remain in<br>
the reaction mixture, or they are fully or partly<br>
removed and, where appropriate, replaced by other<br>
solvents or carrier media. Depending on compatibility<br>
the addition compounds of the invention can also be<br>
combined with resins, resin solutions, reactive<br>
diluents, binders or other prior art additives, such as<br>
other wetting agents and dispersants, anti-settling<br>
agents, surface-active additives such as silicones, for<br>
example, and the like.<br>
The solvent can be removed, for example, by<br>
distillation, where appropriate under reduced pressure,<br>
and/or azeotropically with the addition of water, such<br>
removal being complete or partial. Alternatively the<br>
active substance can be isolated by precipitation, by<br>
the addition of non-solvents such as aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons, hexane for example, subsequent separation<br>
by filtration, and drying if desired. The active<br>
substance obtained by one of these methods can then be<br>
diluted in a solvent suitable for the particular field<br>
of application, or where appropriate can be used as it<br>
is, in the case of powder coating materials for<br>
example. If desired, following the addition of suitable<br>
high-boiling solvents, the solvent in which the<br>
addition product is dissolved can be distilled off,<br>
where appropriate under reduced pressure, and/or<br>
azeotropically with addition of water, and in this way<br>
the addition product can be transferred to a carrier<br>
medium that is suitable for the respective field of<br>
application.<br>
The reactions can be carried out in the presence of<br>
customary catalysts, examples being organotin<br>
compounds, such as dibutyltin dilaurate, other<br>
organometallic compounds such as iron acetylacetonate,<br>
tertiary amines such as triethylenediamine, enzymes or<br>
the like.<br>
By varying the substituents of the formula (la) in<br>
terms of the nature, proportions and/or molecular<br>
weights thereof, it is possible to adapt the properties<br>
of the addition compounds of the invention to the<br>
different fields of application. For example, the<br>
solubility and compatibility can be brought into line<br>
with a very wide variety of solvents, carrier media,<br>
binders, resins, solids and, where appropriate, further<br>
polymeric compounds that are present in coating and<br>
moulding materials in which the addition compounds<br>
according to the invention are employed.<br>
For use in highly polar systems such as water-based<br>
coating materials, for example, the radicals Y ought to<br>
include a sufficiently high fraction of polar groups,<br>
such as polyethylene oxides, for example, in order to<br>
achieve a level of water solubility which is sufficient<br>
for the particular area of use. This fraction of<br>
hydrophilic groups ought also not to be too high,<br>
however, if in certain applications this results in an<br>
unwanted increase in the sensitivity to water. In one<br>
important embodiment the radicals Y of the XH-<br>
functionalized polyalkylene oxides are radicals which<br>
endow the compounds Y-XH and also, ultimately, the<br>
addition compounds of the invention essentially with<br>
insolubility in water. Such radicals Y of the<br>
XH-functionalized polyalkylene oxides advantageously<br>
contain up to a maximum of 28% by weight, preferably up<br>
to a maximum of 20% by weight, more preferably up to a<br>
maximum of 10% by weight and very preferably up to a<br>
maximum of 5% by weight of ethylene oxide units, based<br>
on the total amount of alkylene oxide units in the<br>
radical Y.<br>
In the case of use in apolar systems such as long-oil<br>
alkyd paints, PVC plastisols or polyolefins there<br>
should preferably be an appropriate fraction of apolar<br>
groups, and in the case of use in systems where broad<br>
compatibility is important, such as pigment<br>
concentrates, for example, a balanced combination of<br>
polar and apolar groups is of advantage.<br>
For dispersing in silicone oils such as<br>
decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, for example, for cosmetic<br>
preparations for example, polydimethylsiloxane-<br>
containing addition compounds in particular are<br>
suitable. If the addition compounds are used, for<br>
example, in a polyurethane resin or in a coating<br>
material whose binder is a polyurethane it is<br>
advantageous to use those addition compounds of the<br>
invention whose molecule, by virtue of the groups<br>
present in the starting compounds of the formulae (la)<br>
and (lb), also includes urethane groups or similar<br>
groups which, as is known to the skilled person, are<br>
compatible with polyurethanes. The same applies,<br>
mutatis mutandis, to, for example, polyacrylates,<br>
polyesters, alkyd resins, and other polymers.<br>
Mutatis mutandis this also applies to the substituents<br>
of components (cl) and (c2) , which are of particular<br>
influence on the affinity of the addition compounds of<br>
the invention for the solids used that are to be<br>
dispersed.<br>
Addition compounds of the invention with surface-active<br>
substituents may modify the surface tension of the<br>
substrates produced using them. If, for instance, very<br>
apolar groups such as long-chain alkyl groups having<br>
more than 12 carbon atoms, polydimethylsiloxane-<br>
containing and/or perfluoroalkyl-containing groups are<br>
present, for example, the products are suitable for<br>
reducing the surface tension of liquid organic or<br>
aqueous systems or of solid systems, and for<br>
influencing the associated properties such as, for<br>
example, wetting properties, stainability,<br>
printability, flow and foam behaviour. In systems which<br>
exhibit reactivity with OH groups, COOH groups and/or<br>
double bonds, examples being 2-component systems based<br>
on isocyanate or on melamine resin, epoxide-containing<br>
systems, radiation-curing coatings, such as UV-curing<br>
or electron-beam-curing paints and printing inks, or<br>
unsaturated polyester systems, for example, co-<br>
cross linking can be achieved through the use of<br>
addition compounds of the invention containing reactive<br>
groups such as OH groups, COOH groups and/or<br>
unsaturated groups, and leads to improvements in<br>
adhesion, incorporation of solids, mechanical<br>
properties and migration behaviour. In applications<br>
where the presence of double bonds leads to unwanted<br>
disadvantages such as discoloration, as a result for<br>
example of high processing temperatures, it is<br>
advantageous to use addition compounds of the invention<br>
with as few unsaturated groups as possible and<br>
preferably none at all.<br>
The number-average molecular weight Mn of the addition<br>
compounds of the invention is preferably at least<br>
500 g/mol, more preferably at least 800 g/mol, very<br>
preferably at least 1200 g/mol and ideally at least<br>
2000 g/mol.<br>
The invention also provides a process for preparing the<br>
" addition compounds of the invention, which comprises<br>
reacting<br>
(a) one or more polyisocyanates having at least<br>
two isocyanate groups per molecule with<br>
(bl) one or more compounds of the formula (la)<br>
Y-XH (la)<br>
where<br>
XH is a group that is reactive towards<br>
isocyanates and<br>
Y is a monomeric or polymeric group that is<br>
not reactive towards isocyanates, that<br>
contains no tertiary amino groups and that<br>
comprises one or more aliphatic,<br>
cycloaliphatic and/or aromatic groups,<br>
the compound of the general formula (la)<br>
possessing a number-average molar mass Mn of<br>
less than 20 000 g/mol and<br>
at least 55 mol% of the compounds of the<br>
formula (la) possessing a number-average<br>
molecular weight Mn of 150 to 10 000 g/mol<br>
and which represent XH-functionalized<br>
polyalkylene oxides which contain 40 to<br>
100 mol% of alkylene oxide units having at<br>
least three carbon atoms, based on the total<br>
amount of alkylene oxide units,<br>
with the proviso that 20% to 90% of the<br>
isocyanate groups of component (a) are<br>
reacted with the compounds of the formula<br>
(la),<br>
(b2) one or more compounds of the formula (lb)<br>
G-(XH)n (lb)<br>
where n is 2 to 4 and G is an aliphatic,<br>
cycloaliphatic and/or aromatic group which<br>
contains at least 2 carbon atoms, has no<br>
tertiary amino groups and has a number-<br>
average molecular weight Mn of not more than<br>
3000, and which can contain -O-, -COO-,<br>
-CONH-, -S- and/or -S02- groups, are reacted<br>
in an amount such that 0% to 60%, preferably<br>
0 to 45% and more preferably 0 to 40% of the<br>
NCO groups of the polyisocyanates originally<br>
used are reacted,<br>
with the proviso that, as a result of the<br>
reactions (bl) and (b2) , a total of at least 20%<br>
and not more than 90%, preferably 30 to 65% and<br>
more preferably 4 0 to 60% of the isocyanate groups<br>
of the polyisocyanates originally used have<br>
undergone reaction, and<br>
(cl) one or more compounds of the general formula<br>
(Ha)<br>
Z-Q (Ha)<br>
in which Q is -NH2, -NHR or OH, in which R is<br>
a linear or branched alkyl group having 1 to<br>
18 carbon atoms, and<br>
Z is an organic basic radical having at least<br>
one tertiary amino group and containing no<br>
isocyanate-reactive groups, and<br>
(c2) optionally one or more compounds of the<br>
general formula (lib)<br>
M-Q (lib)<br>
in which Q is -NH2, -NHR or OH, in which R is<br>
a linear or branched alkyl group having 1 to<br>
18 carbon atoms, and<br>
M is an organic radical having a number-<br>
average molar mass of not more than<br>
1000 g/mol, with at least one tertiary amino<br>
group and at least one hydroxyl group,<br>
with the proviso that at least 10% of the<br>
isocyanate groups of component (a) are reacted<br>
with component (cl).<br>
The components (a) , (bl) , (b2) , (cl) and (c2) that are<br>
used in the process of the invention correspond to<br>
those already described earlier on above.<br>
The process of the invention is preferably carried out<br>
such that first of all the compounds of component (a)<br>
are reacted with those of component (bl) and, if used,<br>
(b2) and only then are the remaining isocyanate groups<br>
reacted with the compounds of component (cl).<br>
It is further advantageous, first to react the<br>
compounds of the formula (la) of component (bl) with<br>
the polyisocyanate component (a) and only then to carry<br>
out a reaction with the compounds of the formula (lb)<br>
of component (b2).<br>
The invention further provides for the use of the<br>
above-described addition compounds of the invention as<br>
wetting agents and dispersants and as dispersion<br>
stabilizers.<br>
The invention further provides pulverous or fibrous<br>
solids intended for incorporation into liquid systems<br>
and coated with these addition compounds as dispersants<br>
and as dispersion stabilizers or as wetting agents.<br>
The addition compounds of the invention can be used in<br>
dispersants, dispersion stabilizers or wetting agents<br>
in place of their prior art counterparts. Thus, for<br>
example, they can be used in the preparation or<br>
processing of paints, printing inks, other inks, for<br>
example inkjet inks, paper coatings, leather and<br>
textile colours, pastes, pigment concentrates,<br>
ceramics, and cosmetic preparations, particularly if<br>
they contain solids such as pigments and/or fillers.<br>
They can also be employed in connection with the<br>
preparation or processing of moulding compositions<br>
based on synthetic, semi-synthetic or natural<br>
macromolecular substances, such as polyvinyl chloride,<br>
saturated or unsaturated polyesters, polyurethanes,<br>
polystyrenes, polyacrylates, polyamides, epoxy resins,<br>
polyolefins such as polyethylene or polypropylene, for<br>
example. By way of example it is possible to use the<br>
addition compounds for preparing casting compositions,<br>
PVC plastisols, gelcoats, polymer concrete, printed<br>
circuit boards, industrial paints, wood and furniture<br>
varnishes, vehicle finishes, marine paints, anti-<br>
corrosion paints, can coatings and coil coatings,<br>
decorating paints and architectural paints, where<br>
binders and/or solvents, pigments and optionally<br>
fillers, the addition compound, and typical auxiliaries<br>
are mixed.<br>
The addition compounds are used preferably for<br>
producing pigment- and/or filler-comprising pigment<br>
concentrates, paints, pastes and/or moulding<br>
compositions.<br>
Examples of typical binders are resins based on<br>
polyurethanes, cellulose nitrates, cellulose<br>
acetobutyrates, alkyds, melamines, polyesters,<br>
chlorinated rubbers, epoxides and acrylates. Examples<br>
of water-based coatings are cathodic or anodic<br>
electrodeposition coatings for car bodies, for example.<br>
Further examples are renders, silicate paints, emulsion<br>
paints, aqueous paints based on water-dilutable alkyds,<br>
alkyd emulsions, hybrid systems, 2-component systems,<br>
polyurethane dispersions and acrylate dispersions.<br>
The addition compounds of the invention are<br>
particularly suitable as well for preparing<br>
concentrates of solids, such as pigment concentrates,<br>
for example. For that purpose the compounds of the<br>
invention are initially introduced in a carrier medium<br>
such as organic solvents, plasticizers and/or water,<br>
and the solids to be dispersed are added with stirring.<br>
Additionally these concentrates may include binders<br>
and/or other auxiliaries. With the addition compounds<br>
of the invention, however, it is possible in particular<br>
to prepare stable binder-free pigment concentrates. It<br>
is also possible using the compounds of the invention<br>
to prepare fluid concentrates of solids from pigment<br>
presscakes. In this case the compound of the invention<br>
is admixed to the presscake, which may additionally<br>
contain organic solvents, plasticizers and/or water,<br>
and the resulting mixture is dispersed. Prepared in<br>
their different ways, the concentrates of solids can<br>
then be incorporated into different substrates such as,<br>
for example, alkyd resins, polyester resins, acrylate<br>
resins, polyurethane resins or epoxy resins. Pigments<br>
can also, however, be dispersed directly in the<br>
addition compounds of the invention, without solvent,<br>
and are then particularly suitable for pigmenting<br>
thermoplastic and thermoset polymer formulations.<br>
The addition compounds of the invention can also be<br>
used with advantage in connection with the production<br>
of colour filters for liquid-crystal displays, liquid-<br>
crystal screens, colour resolution devices, sensors,<br>
plasma screens, displays based on SED (Surface<br>
conduction Electron emitter Display) and for MLCC<br>
(Multi-Layer Ceramic Compounds). The MLCC technology is<br>
used in connection with the production of microchips<br>
and printed circuit boards.<br>
The addition compounds of the invention can also be<br>
used to produce cosmetic preparations such as, for<br>
example, makeup, powder, lipsticks, hair colorants,<br>
creams, nail varnishes and sun protection products.<br>
These may be present in the customary forms, as for<br>
example W/0 or 0/W emulsions, solutions, gels, creams,<br>
lotions or sprays. The addition compounds of the<br>
invention can be used with advantage in dispersions<br>
that are used for preparing these preparations. These<br>
dispersions may contain the carrier media that are<br>
typical for these purposes in cosmetology, such as, for<br>
example, water, castor oils or silicone oils, and<br>
solids, such as organic and inorganic pigments such as<br>
titanium dioxide or iron oxide, for example.<br>
The invention also provides, furthermore, for the use<br>
of an addition compound of the invention for preparing<br>
a pigmented paint which serves in particular for<br>
producing a pigmented coating on a substrate, the<br>
pigmented paint being applied to the substrate and the<br>
pigmented paint which has been applied to the substrate<br>
being baked or cured and/or crosslinked.<br>
The dispersants can be used alone or together with<br>
customary prior art binders. For use in polyolefins,<br>
for example, it can be advantageous to use<br>
corresponding polyolefins of low molecular mass as<br>
carrier materials, together with the dispersant.<br>
One inventive use of the addition compounds is in the<br>
preparation of dispersible solids in powder particle<br>
and/or fibre particle form, particularly of dispersible<br>
pigments or plastics fillers, the particles being<br>
coated with the inventive addition compound. Coatings<br>
of this kind of organic and inorganic solids are<br>
performed in a known way, as described in EP-A-<br>
0 270 126, for example. In this case the solvent or<br>
emulsion medium can either be removed or remain in the<br>
mixture, with the formation of pastes. These pastes are<br>
customary commercial products and may additionally<br>
include binder fractions and also further auxiliaries<br>
and additives. Specifically in the case of the pigments<br>
it is possible for the pigment surface to be coated<br>
during or after the synthesis of the pigments, by the<br>
addition, for example, of the addition products of the<br>
invention to the pigment suspension or during or after<br>
the pigment finish. The pigments pretreated in this way<br>
are distinguished by greater ease of incorporation and<br>
also by improved viscosity, flocculation and gloss<br>
behaviour and by higher colour strength as compared<br>
with untreated pigments.<br>
Besides the above-described application, as dispersants<br>
and/or coating materials for pulverous and fibrous<br>
solids, the addition compounds of the invention can<br>
also be used as viscosity reducers and compatibilizers<br>
in synthetic resins. Examples of such synthetic resins<br>
are those known as sheet moulding compounds (SMC) and<br>
bulk moulding compounds (BMC), which are composed of<br>
unsaturated polyester resins with high filler and fibre<br>
contents. Their preparation and processing are<br>
described by way of example in DE-A-36 43007. One<br>
problem affecting SMC and BMC synthetic resin mixtures<br>
is that often polystyrene (PS) is added to the<br>
formulation in order to reduce contraction during the<br>
processing operation. PS is not compatible with the<br>
unsaturated polyester resins used, and separation of<br>
the components occurs. When PS-filled SMC or BMC<br>
mixtures are being used, the additives of the<br>
invention, by virtue of their good dispersing<br>
qualities, are able to bring about compatibilization<br>
between PS and unsaturated polyester resin, thereby<br>
increasing the storage stability and processing<br>
reliability of such mixtures.<br>
In many cases, including for example in incompatible<br>
polyol mixtures, polyol/isocyanate mixtures or<br>
polyol/blowing agent mixtures used for polyurethane<br>
production, through the addition compounds of the<br>
^ invention it is possible wholly or partly to prevent<br>
the separation problems which result from this<br>
incompatibility and affect dispersions, especially<br>
emulsions.<br>
The addition compounds of the invention are added<br>
preferably in an amount of 0.01% to 10% by weight,<br>
based on the total formulation amount. Based on the<br>
solid to be dispersed, they are used in an amount of<br>
preferably 0.5% to 100% by weight. Where difficult-to-<br>
disperse solids are used, the amount of inventive<br>
addition compound employed may well be higher. The<br>
amount of dispersant is generally dependent on the<br>
surface that is to be coated of the substance that is<br>
to be dispersed. For example, if titanium dioxide is<br>
used as a pigment, the amount of dispersant is lower<br>
than in the case of, say, carbon black. Generally<br>
speaking, the amount of dispersant needed to disperse<br>
inorganic pigments is less than for organic pigments,<br>
since the latter have a higher specific surface area<br>
and, consequently, a greater amount of dispersant is<br>
needed. Typical addition levels for inorganic pigments<br>
are 1-10% by weight, for organic pigments 10-30% by<br>
weight (in each case expressed as active substance of<br>
addition compound relative to pigment). In the case of<br>
very finely divided pigments (e.g. some carbon blacks),<br>
amounts of 30-80% by weight or more need to be added,<br>
even.<br>
As a criterion of sufficient pigment stabilization it<br>
is possible for example to employ colour strength,<br>
gloss and transparency of the pigment dispersion or the<br>
degree of floating (rub-out test) in the case of a<br>
white reduction.<br>
The dispersing of the solids may take place as a single<br>
dispersion or else as a mixed dispersion with two or<br>
more pigments simultaneously, the best results<br>
generally being achievable with single dispersions.<br>
When mixtures of different solids are used, opposing<br>
charges on the surfaces of the solids may result in an<br>
increased incidence of agglomeration in the liquid<br>
phase. In these cases it is frequently possible, using<br>
the addition compounds of the invention, to achieve a<br>
charge of equal sign, generally a positive charge, for<br>
all of the particles and hence to avoid instabilities<br>
due to charge differences. The dispersants achieve<br>
their optimum effect when added to the millbase,<br>
particularly if first of all the solid to be dispersed<br>
is mixed only with the additive and, where appropriate,<br>
solvents ("premix"), since in that case the additive is<br>
able to adsorb preferentially onto the surface of the<br>
solid, without having to compete with the binder<br>
polymers. In practice, however, this procedure is<br>
necessary only in exceptional cases. If necessary, the<br>
addition compounds can also be employed subsequently<br>
(as what are called "post-additives"), in order, for<br>
example, to solve floating or flocculation problems in<br>
a batch which has already been let down. Generally<br>
speaking, however, increased levels of addition of<br>
additive are necessary in this case.<br>
In certain cases the addition compounds of the<br>
invention may exert a more or less pronounced influence<br>
on the rheology of the system. In such cases,<br>
therefore, they can also be used for rheology control,<br>
where appropriate in combination with other rheological<br>
additives such as fumed silica, phyllosilicates<br>
(bentonites), hydrogenated castor oils, or the<br>
additives BYK® -410, BYK®-420 and BYK®-425 (BYK Chemie<br>
GmbH). In these cases, synergistic effects are<br>
frequently observed. In many cases it is also possible<br>
to improve the corrosion control properties of coatings<br>
through the use of the addition compounds of the<br>
invention.<br>
Examples of pulverous or fibrous solids are those which<br>
may be coated with dispersants, especially organic and<br>
inorganic pigments which are used in paints, coating<br>
materials, moulding compositions or other plastics, and<br>
organic or inorganic fillers which are used to fill or<br>
reinforce paints, coating materials, moulding<br>
compositions or other plastics. A subgroup of such<br>
fillers are fibres of organic and/or inorganic type<br>
which are likewise used as fillers or reinforcing<br>
substances.<br>
Examples of pigments are mono-, di-, tri- and poly-azo<br>
pigments, oxazine, dioxazine and thiazine pigments,<br>
diketopyrrolopyrroles, phthalocyanines, ultramarine and<br>
other metal complex pigments, indigoid pigments,<br>
diphenylmethane, triarylmethane, xanthene, acridine,<br>
quinacridone and methine pigments, anthraquinone,<br>
pyranthrone, perylene and other polycyclic carbonyl<br>
pigments, inorganic pigments based on carbon black,<br>
graphite, zinc, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, zinc<br>
sulphide, zinc phosphate, barium sulphate, lithopones,<br>
iron oxide, ultramarine, manganese phosphate, cobalt<br>
aluminate, cobalt stannate, cobalt zincate, antimony<br>
oxide, antimony sulphide, chromium oxide, zinc<br>
chromate, mixed metal oxides based on nickel, bismuth,<br>
vanadium, molybdenum, cadmium, titanium, zinc,<br>
manganese, cobalt, iron, chromium, antimony, magnesium,<br>
aluminium (for example nickel titanium yellow, bismuth<br>
vanadate, molybdate yellow or chromium titanium<br>
yellow), magnetic pigments based on pure iron, iron<br>
oxides and chromium oxides or mixed oxides, metallic<br>
pigments comprising aluminium, zinc, copper or brass,<br>
and also pearlescent pigments, and fluorescent and<br>
phosphorescent luminescent pigments. All of the afore-<br>
mentioned pigments may be in surface-modified form and<br>
may possess basic, acidic or neutral groups on the<br>
surface. Preference is given to neutral or acidically<br>
modified pigments, such as oxidized carbon blacks, for<br>
example.<br>
Further examples are nanoscale organic or inorganic<br>
solids having particle sizes below 100 nm, such as<br>
certain grades of carbon black, or particles composed<br>
of a metal or semimetal oxide or hydroxide, and also<br>
particles composed of mixed metal and/or semimetal<br>
oxides and/or hydroxides. By way of example it is<br>
possible to employ the oxides and/or oxide hydroxides<br>
of aluminium, silicon, zinc, titanium, etc. in order to<br>
prepare extremely finely divided solids of this kind.<br>
These oxidic, hydroxidic or oxide-hydroxidic particles<br>
may be prepared by any of a wide variety of methods<br>
such as, for example, ion-exchange operations, plasma<br>
operations, sol-gel processes, precipitation,<br>
comminution (by grinding, for example) or flame<br>
hydrolysis, and the like.<br>
Examples of pulverous or fibrous fillers are, for<br>
example, those composed of pulverous or fibrous<br>
particles of aluminium oxide, aluminium hydroxide,<br>
silicon dioxide, kieselguhr, siliceous earth, quartz,<br>
silica gel, talc, kaolin, mica, perlite, feldspar,<br>
slate flour, calcium sulphate, barium sulphate, calcium<br>
carbonate, calcite, dolomite, glass or carbon. Further<br>
examples of pigments or fillers are found for example<br>
in EP-A-0 270 126. Additionally flame retardants such<br>
as, for example, aluminium hydroxide or magnesium<br>
hydroxide, and matting agents such as silicas, for<br>
example, can likewise be dispersed and stabilized<br>
outstandingly.<br>
In the text below, the present invention is further<br>
illustrated by examples which follow.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
In the case of substances without molecular uniformity<br>
the stated molecular weights - below as already in the<br>
foregoing description - represent average values of the<br>
numerical mean. The molecular weights or number-average<br>
molecular weights Mn/ are determined, when titratable<br>
hydroxyl or amino groups are present, by end-group<br>
determination via the determination of the OH number or<br>
amine number, respectively. In the case of compounds to<br>
which an end-group determination cannot be applied, the<br>
number-average molecular weight is determined by means<br>
of gel permeation chromatography against a polystyrene<br>
standard.<br>
Unless otherwise remarked, parts are parts by weight<br>
and percentages are percentages by weight.<br>
The free NCO content of the polyisocyanates employed<br>
and also the course of the NCO addition reactions, are<br>
determined in accordance with EN ISO 9369 by reaction<br>
with butylamine and subsequent titration of the amine<br>
excess. These methods are also described in<br>

Derivatives", Part 1, Chapter 5, 1977.<br>
The hydroxy-functional caprolactone polyesters are<br>
prepared as described in EP 158678, for example.<br>
