Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1-3, one preferred embodiment of a bay or frame 20 is shown for splicing, terminating, and managing fiber optic cables within the frame. Further features of frame 20 are shown in FIGS. 4-13. An upper portion 22 of frame 20 defines a termination and storage area. A lower portion 24 of frame 20 defines a splice area. Cables containing one or more individual optical fibers enter<br><br>
frame 20 typically from an overhead cable environment through a top 26 of frame 20, or from a raised floor environment at a bottom 28 of frame 20. If the cables are pre-terminated, the cables extend directly to termination and storage area 22. If the cables entering frame 20 are not pre-terminated, the cables extend to splice area 24 for splicing to terminated cables. From splice area 24, the cables then extend to termination and storage area 22. In termination and storage area 22, a plurality of accessible termination locations are provided for the terminated cables and for connecting other cables to the terminated cables, such as patch cords or cables. Utilizing patch cables, telecommunications equipment can be cross-connected between the termination locations through frame 20.<br>
Frame 20 includes a rack 30 which supports a plurality of termination modules 32. In the preferred embodiment, left and right arrays 34S 36 of termination modules 32 are provided. Each array 34, 36 in the illustrated embodiment includes three individual termination modules 32a (left side), 32b (right side).<br>
Rack 30 also supports an inner bay management panel 40 positioned between arrays 34, 36 of termination modules 32 for organizing and storing excess lengths of patch cables. Preferably, inner bay management panel 40 includes a vertical array of individual modules or sections 40a. By providing individual termination modules 32a, 32b and individual sections 40a of inner bay management panel 40 all of which are separately mountable to rack 30, these modules can be added at different times to rack 30, and replaced, if desired. Also, customized frames 20 can be provided where other fiber optic management equipment may be utilized in one or more of the areas in rack 30 instead of the six termination modules 32a, 32b and the three sections 40a of inner bay management panel 40 of the illustrated embodiment.<br>
Rack 30 further supports a splice tray assembly 44, for holding a plurality of splice trays 46. In the preferred embodiment, frame 20 includes two vertically stacked splice tray assemblies 44. Each splice tray 46 includes structure for holding the ends of a plurality of fiber optic cables, and for holding individual spikes between the ends of the cables. A variety of splice trays 46 may be used. Example splice trays arc shown in commonly assigned U.S. Application Serial Number 09/158,182, filed September 21, 1998, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Rack 30 further supports a horizontal cable tray 50 positioned between termination and storage area 22 and splice area 24. Horizontal tray 50 supports patch cables on a front of frame 20 extending between the left and right arrays 34. 36 of termination modules 32 and inner bay management panel 40. Tray<br><br>
50 also supports patch cables extending between frame 20 and further frames 20 or other telecommunications equipment in an adjacent area.<br>
Frame 20 preferably includes hingedly mounted upper front doors 52, 54, and hingedly mounted lower front doors 56, 58 for protection of the cables, connectors, adapters and splice trays. Upper front doors 52, 54 pivot about vertical axes. Lower front doors 56, 58 pivot about horizontal axes. The doors preferably include one or more latches 59 to retain them in the closed positions.<br>
Rack 30 further supports two vertical cable guides 60, 62, one on each side of rack 30, for use in managing and protecting patch cables adjacent to a front of frame 20. Cable guides 60, 62 include a plurality of spaced apart fingers 65 which permit cable access to an interior of each of cable guides 60, 62 through a vertical side of each guide. In the illustrated embodiment, each cable guide 60, 62 also includes hinge plates 64 for forming a portion of the hinge for upper front doors 52, 54. Each cable guide 60, 62 is preferably made in segments, as part of the modular design of frame 20.<br>
For ease of assembly, and versatility in use, components making up frame 20 are preferably separate components held together by fasteners. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, termination modules 32, inner bay management panel 40, splice tray assemblies 44, cable tray 50, and cable guides 60, 62 are separate from rack 30.<br>
Frame 20 defines various access openings to permit cables to enter frame 20. At bottom 28 of frame 20, a center opening 66 allows cables to enter frame 20 from a raised floor environment. Central passage 68 allows the cables to pass to the individual splice trays 46. Ties 69 (FIGS. 11 and 12) are provided to securely tie the incoming cables to frame 20. A central opening 70 in cable tray 50 links splice area 24 to termination and storage area 22. Adjacent to top 26 of frame 20, access openings are provided by a rear central opening 72 or two top openings 74, 76, one in each top termination module 32. For pre-terminated cables, the cables can be passed directly through top openings 74, 76 for termination in the termination modules 32. For cables which are spliced to terminated cables, rear opening 72 opens into a rear vertical passage 78 which extends down to splice area 24. and ties 69, for splicing to the termination cables at splice trays 46.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1. 2 and 13, each section 40a of inner bay<br>
management panel 40 includes a center section 80, two forwardly extending opposed sides 82, 84. and one or more vertically spaced central spools 86 forwardly extending from center section 80. Spools 86 provide for storage of excess cable lengths for patch cables, such as the patch cables extending between left and right arrays 34. 36 of termination modules 32. Preferably, each section 40a includes two<br><br>
spools 86, such that when only one section is provided, cable storage capability is provided.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 1, 2, and 12, each splice tray assembly 44 includes a main horizontal support 90, a main back support 91, a plurality of divider walls 92, and plurality of spool cradles or supports 94, for supporting each of splice trays 46 having a round outer perimeter. Divider walls 92 extend vertically in the illustrated embodiment. Main horizontal support 90 has an open middle 90a for cable passage. A cable guide finger 96, and a cable tie 98 are provided to securely retain the cables to frame 20. Such permits removal of splice trays 46 from splice tray assembly 44, and the unwinding of the ends of the cable from splice tray 46 without excessive stresses or movements of the cables. In the illustrated embodiment, divider walls 92 extend vertically. In other embodiments, the divider walls can be angled with respect to the vertical, or even horizontal. While each splice tray assembly 44 is shown as part of frame 20, the splice trays could be stored separate from frame 20, if desired.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 1-3, and 11, horizontal cable tray 50 includes a main horizontal portion 99 including central opening 70, two opposed and upwardly extending curved cable guides 101 on each side of central opening 70, and a center cover 102 over central opening 70. Curved guides 101 protect cables extending from splice area 24 to termination and storage area 22. Center cover 102 prevents stored patch cables from hanging down from inner bay management panel 40 into splice area 24. Cut outs 104 on each end of horizontal tray 50 can be filled in with horizontal supports for supporting cables extending horizontally, or downwardly curved supports, if cables are directed downwardly from frame 20. Horizontal cable tray 50 also includes a front wall 105, and a rear wall 106 extending from main horizontal portion 99.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 4-10, each termination module 32 includes a top 110, a bottom 112, opposed sides 114, 116, and a rear 118. The illustrated module 32 is from right array 36. Preferably, each of termination modules 32a, 32b are identical, but positioned in a flipped orientation. Therefore, top 110 and bottom 112 would be in the reversed orientation for the left array 34 of modules 32.<br>
Each termination module 32 defines an open front 120 preferably closed off by a first smaller door 122 and a second larger door 124. both of which are hingedly mounted to a remainder of termination module 32 about vertical axes. First door 122 defines a cable access door, especially useful for allowing cables to enter the termination module 32 and for positioning cables passing between locations on frame 20, such as cable extending between splice area 24. and an upper<br><br>
termination module 32 positioned above the particular termination module 32. Cable access door 122 is rotatively mounted to side 114 by a hinge 126.<br>
Second door 124 defines a main panel 124 and is rotatably mounted to side 116 by a second hinge 128. Main panel 124 includes a plurality of rows 130 of openings 132 each sized for holding an adapter 134. Adapters 134 each include at least two aligned openings, one on a front side 134a, and the other on a rear side 134b for holding two connectors 142 to optically connect the connectors and the cables connected to the connectors. Various adapters 134 can be utilized including an adapter of the type shown in U.S. Patent No. 5,317,663, constructed so as to have the commonly known SC configuration for receiving an SC connector on each end. Other adapters/connectors styles can be utilized including ST, FC, E-2000, and other styles. Preferably, main panel 124 includes six upper rows 130 of eight openings each, and six lower rows 130 of eight openings each. If desired, less than eight of the openings can be utilized for a given application. In the illustrated embodiment, adapters 134 snap mount to main panel 124 with a clip 135. Designation strips (not shown) can be provided to label each of openings 132.<br>
Rear connectors 142b are connected to the cables entering frame 20 from the telecommunications equipment. A rear 140 of main panel 124 is primarily utilized as a semi-permanent connection between the connectors 142b and adapters 134. A front 138 of main panel 324 defines a plurality of accessible termination locations which can be connected between each other with patch cables and connectors 142a, so as to cross-connect the telecommunications equipment.<br>
Main panel 124 includes an angled side panel 143. Side panel 143 includes a vertical array of clips 144 adjacent each row 130 of openings 132. Clips 144 rotate with main panel 124 and side panel 143. Each clip 144 holds the cables from each connector 142 disposed in each row. From clips 144, the cables extend through a side access of each cable guide 60, 62. Clips 144 help retain and protect the cables as main panel 124 is rotated. Without clips 144, rotation of main panel 124 may excessively pull or push on the portions of the cables positioned within cable guides 60, 62.<br>
Main panel 124 further includes upper and lower hinge plates 146, 148. A top plate 150 and a bottom plate 152 define top 110 and bottom 112 of termination module 32 and each includes a hinge plate portion 154, 156 which cooperate with hinge plates 146, 148 to rotatably mount main panel 124 to top and bottom plates 150, 152. Each of hinge plate portions 154. 1 56 include a stop 158, 160 to limit rotation of main panel 124.<br>
Main panel 124 is disposed at an angle to a vertical plane extending parallel to a front and a rear of frame 20. Such angling permits increased density<br><br>
over adapters 134 arranged with the longitudinal axes transverse to the front and rear planes. Also, cable management is facilitated by the angling of the cables toward cable guides 60, 62. For right array 36 of modules 32, main panels 124 are angled toward the right side of rack 30. For left array 34 of modules 32, main panels 124 are angled toward the left side of rack 30.<br>
To maintain main panel 124 in the closed position, such as shown in FIGS. 1-5, two latches 162 are provided. Each latch 162 engages a tab 164 extending from top and bottom plates 150, 152. Cable access door 122 is also maintained in the closed position shown in FIGS. 4 and 5 by a second latch 166 which engages an edge 168 of main panel 124. Cable access door 122 also overlaps edge 168. Both top and bottom plates 150,152 include cable passages 170, to permit vertical passing of cables into, and through termination module 32, if desired.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 6-10, internal cable management features are provided within termination module 32. A cable clamp 182 securely holds a cable entering termination module 32. A lower tab 18la helps maintain the cable in passage 170. Tab 181 a also maintains other cables passing through module 32 in passage 170. An intermediate tab 181 c and an upper tab 181 b are also provided to position desired cables in passage 170. From clamp 182, the individual fibers are routed through a cable transitional area 171 including various cable guides 186 including tabs, spools, clips, or rings. A tie bracket 190 can be utilized with or instead of clamp 182 (see FIGS. 9 and 10) to tie down cable entering termination module 32. On rear 140 of main panel 124, a rear tray 192 is positioned in a central location on main panel 124 projecting horizontally and rearwardly. Rear tray 192 includes a plurality of horizontal cable rings 194. A curved edge 196 helps prevent rear tray 192 from catching on cables positioned within an interior of termination module 132, either in vertical cable passage 170. or in cable transitional area 171.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, an example cable 184 containing multiple fibers enters termination module 32 through bottom plate 152 in passage 170. Clamp 182 holds cable 184. A first fiber 184a extends around upper spool or guides 186a, past intermediate guides 186b, and around lower spool or guides 186c, around lower corner guide 186d to lower ring 188b. through horizontal ring 194 to one of the upper locations on main panel 124.

To facilitate retention of splice trays 46 within the individual compartments defined by divider walls 292, side lips 294 are provided on opposite sides of each divider wall 292. Also, front notches 295 are provided to facilitate ease of access to a stored splice tray 46. The angling of dividers 292 aids in reducing the horizontal space taken up by splice tray assembly, and allows for sufficient cable pathway spacing to upper pathway 278.<br>
Horizontal cable tray 250 includes a main horizontal portion 299, a rear wall 300, and one or more front walls 302. The front and rear walls 302, 299 help protect and retain patch cables passing through horizontal cable tray 250.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 17-23, each termination module 232 includes a top 310, a bottom 312, opposed sides 314, 316, and a rear 318. Side 314 defines a side opening 315 bounded on three sides. Side opening 315 permits cable access to an interior of module 232. The illustrated module 232 is from right array 236. Preferably each of termination modules 232a, 232b are identical but positioned in a flipped orientation. Therefore, top 310 and bottom 312 would be in a reversed orientation for the left array 234 of modules 232.<br>
Each termination module 232 defines an open front 320 preferably closed off by door or main panel 324 which is hingedly mounted to a main housing 322. Main panel 324 is rotatably mounted adjacent to side 316 by a hinge 328. Main panel 324 includes a plurality of openings 332 (see FIGS. 14-16) each sized for holding one or more adapters 134. Openings 332 are configured as elongated<br><br>
slots. To facilitate mounting of adapters 134. angled retainers 336 are provided. As noted above, various adapters 134 can be utilized including an SC type.

Main panel 324 includes an angled side panel 343 including a vertical array of clips 344 adjacent each row of adapters 134. Clips 344 rotate with main panel 324 and side panel 343. Each clip 344 holds the cables from each connector 142a disposed in each row. From clips 344, the cables extend through a side access of each cable guide 260, 262. Clips 344 help retain and protect the cables as main panel 324 is rotated. Without clips 344, rotation of main panel 324 may excessively pull or push on the portions of the cables positioned within cable guides 260, 262.<br>
Main panel 324 further includes upper and lower hinge plates 346, 348. A top plate 350 and a bottom plate 352 define top 310 and bottom 312 of termination module 232 and each includes a hinge plate portion 354, 356 which cooperate with hinge plates 346, 348 to rotatably mount main panel 324 to top and bottom plates 350, 352. Each of hinge plate portions 354, 356 includes a stop 358, 360 to limit rotation of main panel 324.<br>
Main panel 324 is disposed at an angle to a vertical plane extending parallel to a front and a rear of frame 220. Such angling permits increased density over adapters arranged with the longitudinal axes transverse to the front and rear planes. Also, cable management is facilitated by the angling of the cables toward cable guides 260, 262. For right array 236 of modules 232, main panels 324 are angled toward the opposite side of rack 230. Similarly, for left array 234 of modules 232, main panels 324 are angled toward the right side of rack 230. Use of the angled retainers 362 permits angling back of the cables toward the respective right and left sides of rack 230. The angled retainers 362 hold each adapter 134 so its longitudinal axis is at a non-transverse angle to the planar portion of main panel 324. Commonly owned U.S. Patent No. 5,214,735 shows example retainers usable with<br><br>
main panel 324. The disclosure of U.S. Patent No. 5,214,735 is incorporated by reference.<br>
To maintain main panel 324 in the closed position, two latches 362 are provided, similar to latches 162 noted above. Each latch 362 engages a tab 364 extending from top and bottom plates 350, 352.<br>
