				<td>Field of the Invention.<br>
The present invention relates to a system and user interface for processing<br>
digital data, containing a plurality of time multiplexed data streams, some of which represent<br>
video signals, and in particular coded high-definition (HD) video signals, to derive a decoded<br>
video signal suitable, for example, for recording or producing a picture-in-picture (PEP) or<br>
other reduced resolution purposes.<br>
Description of the Prior Art:<br>
Television receivers are known that, while displaying a relatively large picture derived<br>
from a primary television channel, also can simultaneously display a small subimage such as a<br>
picture-in-picture (PIP) derived from a secondary television channel. For high-definition<br>
television (HDTV) receivers, the large picture may be derived from a high-definition source,<br>
and be displayed with a corresponding high visual resolution. However, because the PEP is<br>
small, there is no need to provide a high definition PIP display because a viewer inherently<br>
would not be able to resolve the higher definition components of a high definition PEP.<br>
Viewers also sometimes desire to record television signals. Standard analog video cassette<br>
recorders (VCRs) cannot record HDTV signals at their full resolution. Therefore, before a<br>
HDTV channel may be recorded on a standard VCR, it must be transformed into a lower<br>
resolution e.g. NTSC format video signal. This lower resolution signal may then be supplied<br>
to the VCR.<br>
In a digital television signal distribution system, a plurality of digital data streams, each<br>
representing a respective video signal, are time multiplexed together and transmitted to the<br>
receiver, in a known manner. The digital data in each of the plurality of data streams is<br><br><br>
encoded and highly compressed according to known encoding schemes, such as MPEG<br>
encoding, and must be decoded to regenerate any of the video signals represented by it.<br>
Known HDTV receivers include a relatively complex and expensive decoder that conforms<br>
with the ISO 1 3818-2 standard for decoding a received coded HD video signal in real time to<br>
generate a high-definition video signal for the high definition display device in the receiver.<br>
This decoder uses all of the transmitted data in the data stream representing that video signal<br>
to reproduce the high-definition video signal representing the transmitted image. However, as<br>
described above, a lower resolution video signal is generated for a PIP and/or VCR. This<br>
process involves two steps. First, the digital data stream is decoded into a video signal<br>
represented by that data stream. Second, this video signal is sample-rate-converted to the<br>
lower resolution, e.g. NTSC, video format.<br>
To provide the PIP and/or VCR video signal, known HDTV receivers also include a<br>
second, lower-resolution, simpler and less expensive, decoder which also conforms with the<br>
ISO 13818-2 standard. This decoder, however, uses only a portion of the transmitted data in<br>
the data stream representing that video signal to reproduce a low-definition video signal<br>
representing the transmitted image. Consequently, this video signal possibly represents an<br>
image which contains visible and objectionable artifacts. For a PIP image, this is not a<br>
problem, because the small size of the PIP image makes such artifacts practically invisible to<br>
the viewer. However, an image to be recorded and played-back will most likely be displayed<br>
at full size, allowing these artifacts to remain visible, and possibly objectionable. If a high-<br>
definition TV program is selected to record, a choice exists for how to produce the low-<br>
resolution video signal. First, the high definition video data may be first decoded using the<br>
low resolution decoder. This produces a low resolution video signal having artifacts, as<br>
described above. This low-resolution signal is then scan-rate-converted into the low<br>
resolution, e.g. NTSC, format. Alternatively, the high resolution data may be first decoded<br>
using the high resolution decoder. This produces a high resolution video signal free of<br>
artifacts. This high resolution signal is then scan-rate-converted into the low resolution, e.g.<br>
NTSC, format.<br><br>
3<br>
A receiver including nvo decoders is relatively expensive. Further developments have<br>
led to an arrangement in which a single decoder was able to be "shared" by two video data<br>
streams. Such a decoder was developed which was time multiplexed to be able to decode<br>
multiple data streams from the time multiplexed data stream. Such a decoder produces two<br>
output signals independently, representing two of the plurality of video signals in the data<br>
stream. However, a practical single decoder may not be constructed in an economical manner<br>
to simultaneously decode two HDTV signals. Instead, such a decoder may decode a single<br>
HDTV signal, and a second signal decoded at lower resolution.<br>
A number of problems arise in providing a User interface suitable for operation of an<br>
HDTV (or other digital TV) receiver employing decoder units capable of simultaneously<br>
processing multiple images for display and/or recording. Such problems arise because of the<br>
increased number of processing options available to a User, bandwidth constraints of the<br>
decoder, and different system and peripheral configurations (e.g. different storage and<br>
playback units) that may be used in an HDTV entertainment system. These problems and<br>
derivative problems are addressed by a system according to the present invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with principles of the present invention a television receiver includes a<br>
source of digital data comprising a plurality of data streams each representing one of a<br>
standard definition television signal and a high definition television signal and encoded in such<br>
a manner that it may be decoded at full resolution to produce an image substantially without<br>
visible decoding artifacts or decoded at partial resolution to produce an image possibly<br>
including visible decoding artifacts. A decoder is coupled to the digital data source, and has a<br>
maximum decoding bandwidth less than that required to simultaneously decode two high<br>
definition television signals at full decoding resolution. A controller, is coupled to the<br>
decoder, for selecting two respective ones of the data streams responsive to user input, and if<br><br>
4<br>
both represent a high definition television signal, requesting user input for specifying one of<br>
the two respective data streams to decode at partial resolution..<br>
A television receiver according to the present invention allows the user to select<br>
whether a signal desired for recording is decoded at partial resolution, or at full resolution.<br>

video images which may be displayed on a display device in a television receiver illustrated in<br>
FIGURE 1;<br>
FIGURE 2b is a diagram of the layout of a remote control device which may be used<br>
in conjunction with a television receiver illustrated in FIGURE 1;<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram of a portion of an HDTV receiver according to principles|<br>
of the present invention. In Figure 1, only those elements necessary for an understanding of<br>
the present invention are illustrated. One skilled in the art will understand that many other<br>
elements necessary in an HDTV receiver are not illustrated, and will understand what those<br>
elements are, how to design and implement them, and how those other elements are<br>
interconnected with the illustrated elements. In Figure 1, an input terminal 5 is coupled to a<br>
source (not shown) of digital data including a plurality of time multiplexed data streams, each<br>
representing a video signal. Some of these data streams may represent high-definition video<br>
images, while others may represent standard-definition video images. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, the video signal data streams in the digital data are encoded using known MPEG<br>
encoding, although other encoding techniques may be used. Other data streams, representing<br>
other signals may also be included in this digital data. For example, one or more of the data<br><br>
s<br>
streams may contain data representing an audio signal corresponding to a video signal data<br>
stream, or representing a program guide containing information relating to the content of the<br>
respective television programs multiplexed within the digital data, all in a known manner. The<br>
digital data source (not shown) may be, for example, a satellite receiver, a cable receiver, a<br>
digital recorder playback output, or any source providing such a signal.<br>
Input terminal 5 is coupled to an input terminal of an MPEG video signal decoder 10.<br>
In Figure 1, the input terminal 5 is coupled to an input terminal of a data stream selector 98<br>
within the MPEG decoder 10. An output terminal of the selector 98 is coupled to an input<br>
terminal of a variable length codeword decoder (VLD) 100. A first output terminal of the<br>
VLD 100 is coupled to a partial-resolution decoder 102. A second output terminal of the<br>
VLD 100 is coupled to an input terminal of a full resolution decoder 104. Respective output<br>
terminals of the partial resolution decoder 102 and the full resolution decoder 104 are coupled<br>
to corresponding input terminals of a switching circuit 106. A first output terminal of the<br>
switching circuit 106 is coupled to a display device 108. The display device 108 is integrated<br>
in the television receiver and is capable of displaying a high-definition video image. One<br>
skilled in the art will understand that a sample rate converter (not shown) may be required to<br>
generate high definition television signals for the HDTV display device 108. One skilled in the<br>
art will also understand that this output terminal of the switching circuit 106 may also be<br>
coupled to an output terminal of the television receiver, and, thus, made available to<br>
equipment external to the television receiver, such as a standalone video monitor.<br>
A second output terminal of the switching circuit 106 is coupled to a sample rate<br>
converter 110. An output terminal of the sample rate converter 110 produces a low resolution<br>
video signal suitable to be recorded on a standard VCR, and is coupled to an output terminal<br>
15. In Figure 1, this signal is an NTSC format television signal, though other formats, such as<br>
PAL or SECAM, or any other such format may also be used. The output terminal 15 may be<br>
connected to a VCR (not shown) capable of recording the signal produced by the scan rate<br>
converter 110.<br><br>
6<br>
A controller 112 has lespective control output terminals coupled to corresponding<br>
control input terminals of the MPEG video decoder 10, the switching circuit 106 and the<br>
sample rate convener 110. More specifically, the controller 112 produces control signals for<br>
the internal circuits within these elements, such as for the data stream selector 98, VLD 100.<br>
the partial resolution decoder 102 and the full resolution decoder 104 in the MPEG video<br>
decoder 10. Other control signals may be generated by the controller 112 and supplied to<br>
other, non-illustrated, circuitry in the illustrated embodiment, all in a known manner. The<br>
controller 112 may also generate video image signals, and couple those image signals, through<br>
the switching circuit 106, to the display device 108. For example, such images may represent<br>
on-screen-displays (OSDs) for presenting information to the user, and requesting command<br>
information back from the user, also in a known manner. A user input terminal 25 receives<br>
data representing user command data. The user input terminal 25 may be coupled to a control<br>
panel (not shown) on the television receiver, including, for example, buttons for entering<br>
control information. The user input terminal 25 may also be coupled to a receiver (not shown)<br>
for receiving data from a remote control device (also not shown), also including buttons for<br>
entering control information, possibly similar to those on the receiver control panel (if any),<br>
and capable of being operated by a user from a remote location, such as across the room from<br>
the receiver, all in a known manner.<br>
In operation, the MPEG decoder 10 operates in a time multiplexed manner to<br>
simultaneously decode more than one video data stream from the MPEG digital data at input<br>
terminal 5, representing respective video signals, selected in response to a control signal from<br>
the controller 112. More specifically, the selector 98 operates to extract the selected data<br>
streams from the digital data and provide only those data streams to the variable length<br>
codeword decoder 100. The data in those data streams includes successive variable length<br>
codewords. As is known, the codewords represent, among other things, coefficients of<br>
spatially encoded discrete cosine transform (DCT) macroblocks each representing a small<br>
block of the image represented by that data stream. In a known MPEG embodiment, up to 64<br>
coefficients represent each macroblock. The VLD 100 produces respective streams of DCT<br>
coefficients from the selected data streams. The DCT coefficients related to one of the<br><br>
7<br>
selected data streams are supplied to the full resolution decoder 104. while the DCT<br>
coefficients related to another one of the selected data streams are supplied to the partial<br>
resolution decoder 102, in response to a control signal from the controller ] 12. The full<br>
resolution decoder 104 processes all of these 64 coefficient codewords to reproduce a video<br>
signal representing the image. This results in a video signal having the maximum quality. The<br>
partial resolution decoder 102, however, processes only a fraction of these 64 coefficient<br>
codewords. For example, in a known embodiment, only 6 of the 64 coefficients are processed<br>
to regenerate each macroblock in the image. This results in an image missing some of the<br>
information which was transmitted to the receiver. Because transmitted information is missing<br>
from the reproduced image, artifacts may be present in the image, and those artifacts may be<br>
visible and objectionable.<br>
The switching circuit 106 couples the respective output terminals of the MPEG<br>
decoder 10, from the full resolution decoder 104 and the partial resolution decoder 102<br>
respectively, to either the display device 108 or the sample rate converter 110, in response to<br>
control signals from the controller 112. The display device 108 displays the image represented<br>
by the video signal coupled to its input terminal, in a known manner. The sample rate<br>
converter 110 converts the data at its input terminal to a low resolution format video signal,<br>
such as an NTSC format signal, and supplies that signal to the output terminal 15, in a known<br>
manner.<br>
The controller. 112- includes a processor (not shown) which operates in accordance <br>
with a software program, in a known manner. The controller 112 is programmed to receive<br>
commands from the user input terminal 25 and generate appropriate control signals to<br>
configure the various circuits to which it is coupled to the desired states. The controller 112<br>
further operates to produce signals representing OSDs to be displayed on the display device<br>
108, all in a manner to be described in more detail below.<br>
The system illustrated in Figure 1 will support a high resolution video output signal <br>
(analog or digital) at one output terminal of the switching circuit 106 while concurrently<br>
providing a low resolution output video signal for display/record on an NTSC compatible J <br><br>
8<br>
device at the output terminal of the sample rate converter ] 10. The two output paths are<br>
independent so it is not required that the video signal at the low resolution output terminal be<br>
a resampled version of the video signal at the high resolution output terminal. That is, the<br>
switching circuit 106 may route any of the decoded pictures from the full resolution decoder<br>
104 and the partial resolution decoder 102 to either of the two output terminals.<br>
The MPEG video decoder 10 has a limited bandwidth in operation which may be<br>
described in terms of the total number of rnacroblocks that may be decoded per second. This<br>
bandwidth is shared between the selected data streams in such a way that the MPEG video<br>
decoder 10 is effectively time-multiplexed between several source pictures. This MPEG video<br>
decoder 10 further includes known display processing (not shown) that will allow the<br>
independent scaling and overlay of all decoded pictures. This display processing is used to<br>
facilitate multi-picture display modes, including subimages such as PIP, POP and PIG (picture<br>
in picture, picture outside picture and picture in graphic).<br>
It is anticipated that the low resolution output terminal 15 from the television receiver<br>
illustrated in Figure 1 will be used to support NTSC recording of digital source material.<br>
Current VCRs may have multiple video input terminals. The user will typically navigate a<br>
menu system in the VCR to select one of the video input terminals for recording. In a digital<br>
system as illustrated in Figure 1, however, the desired video signal is typically carried by one<br>
of the plurality of MPEG encoded digital data streams, and must be extracted and decoded<br>
before being output to an analog video recorder. As such, part of the process of selecting a<br>
signal to record on a VCR must be located within the digital television receiver itself. The<br>
television receiver, therefore, must also include a user interface to allow a user to navigate and<br>
select from among the range of video signals supplied to the receiver that may be directed to<br>
the record output terminal 15, and thus to the record input terminal of the VCR. The<br>
remainder of this application will describe the user interface in the television receiver.<br>
Figures 2a, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, 5a, 5b, 6a, 6b and 6c are diagrams of television<br>
video images which may be displayed on a display device 108 in a television receiver<br>
illustrated in Figure 1, and Figure 2b is a diagram of the layout of a remote control device 130<br><br>
9<br>
which may be used in conjunction with a television receiver illustrated in Figure I. Referring<br>
to Figure 2a, under some conditions, the image 120 displayed on the display device 108 will<br>
be controlled by the controller ] 12 (of Figure 1) to include a banner display 122, meaning an<br>
overlay along one edge of the display screen 108, typically the top. in a known manner. In the<br>
illustrated embodiment, the banner display 122 includes the time, date and title of the program<br>
currently being displayed. In some configurations of the banner display 122, a 'quick record'<br>
icon 124 may be also displayed. Referring again to Figure 1, the controller 112 monitors the<br>
user input terminal 25 to detect user commands, also in a known manner.<br>
The user may invoke a record menu system in the television receiver by highlighting<br>
and selecting the 'quick record' icon 124 from the display banner 122 using e.g. the control<br>
panel on the television receiver or the remote control 130. To do this on the remote control<br>
130, the user would press the directional buttons 132 on the remote control 130 until the<br>
'quick record' icon 124 is highlighted, then press the select button 134. Alternatively, the user<br>
may invoke the record menu system by pushing the "record" button 136 on the remote control<br>
130. The user may also invoke the record menu system by maneuvering through the receiver<br>
program guide menu system in a manner to be described in more detail below.<br>
When the record menu is invoked by any of these methods, the system will at first<br>
assume that the user wishes to record one of the programs that is currently being displayed on<br>
the display device 108. If only one program is currently displayed on the screen the record<br>
operation will begin for that program. The switching circuit 106 will be conditioned by the<br>
controller 112 to couple the video signal being supplied to the display device 108 to the<br>
sample rate converter 110 also. The sample rate converter 110 will convert the signal to an<br>
NTSC signal, which is supplied to the record output terminal 15. The currently displayed<br>
picture will, thus, be formatted for NTSC output. In addition, when possible the video<br>
recorder will be signaled by the television receiver to begin recording via the VCR remote<br>
control link. It is anticipated that the video signal supplied to the display device 108 will be<br>
decoded at full resolution by decoder 104. However, one skilled in the art will understand<br>
that the signal being supplied to the display device 108 could be either a high definition or JJf<br><br>
10<br>
standard definition video signal, and it could be either decoded at full resolution by the full<br>
resolution decoder 104 or at partial resolution by the partial resolution decoder 102.<br>
In Figure 2a, a second image 121, in PIP format, is illustrated in phantom in the<br>
bottom left hand corner of the display device 108. More than one such picture could be<br>
included in the image displayed on the display device 108. If more than one program image is<br>
currently displayed on the display device 108, e.g. main image 120 and PIP 121, then, when<br>
the record menu system is invoked in the manner described above, a visual cue on the display<br>
device 108 will highlight one of the displayed program images (120, 121) and a graphic will be<br>
created to inform the user which program will be recorded. The user then may confirm or<br>
cancel the recording operation. For example, in Figure 3a, a bold black box 126a is displayed<br>
around the main program video image 120 to indicate that it is the current selection for the<br>
record output terminal 15. An on-screen display of a confirmation box 128a is generated by<br>
the controller 112 (of Figure 1) and also displayed on the display device 108. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, this confirmation box 128a includes the channel number, the program title, and a<br>
brief description of the main image 120 program. The OK button of the confirmation box 128a<br>
is shown as depressed in order to indicate that it is the default selection for the confirmation<br>
box 128a. That is, when the user presses the select button 134 on the remote control 130, the<br>
default selection is activated. If the user presses the select button 134 on the remote control<br>
130, activating the OK button, thus, confirming this selection for recording, the video signal<br>
representing the main image 120 will be supplied to the sample rate converter 110, and<br>
recording will begin.<br>
If the user does not want to record the video displayed in the main program video<br>
image 120, then the directional keys 132 on the remote control 130 may be pressed. This will<br>
condition the controller 112 to make the arrow button the default selection, and to show the<br>
arrow button as depressed (not shown - but similar to the depressed OK button illustrated in<br>
confirmation box 128a). This, in turn, indicates that a different program is desired for<br>
recording. If the select button 134 on the remote control 130 is then pressed, the next<br>
program currently being displayed on the display device 108 will be highlighted. As illustrated<br><br>
11<br>
in Figure 3b. the PIP image 121 is selected, and a bold black box 126b is displayed around the<br>
PIP image 121. Similarly to Figure 3a, a confirmation box 128b is displayed, including the<br>
channel number, program title and brief description of the PIP image 121 program. If the user<br>
wishes to confirm that the PIP image 121 program is to be recorded, then the directional keys<br>
132 on the remote control 130 are again pressed. The controller ] 12 in response makes the<br>
OK button the default selection, and generates the confirmation box 128b with the OK button<br>
depressed, as illustrated. If the user presses the select button 134 on the remote control 130,<br>
activating the OK button, and confirming this selection for recording, the video signal<br>
representing the PIP image 121 will be supplied to the sample rate converter 110, and<br>
recording will begin. On the other hand, if yet another displayed program (not illustrated in<br>
Figure 3) is desired, then the arrow button on the confirmation box 128b may be activated<br>
again, by pressing the select button 134 on the remote control 130, until the desired program<br>
is highlighted. Then the OK button is activated, as described above, to begin recording of the<br>
selected program.<br>
The order of navigating among the displayed programs may be flexible and may be<br>
chosen in a way that is consistent with other menu operations in the television receiver and<br>
that may be easily understood by the user. For example, video windows may be navigated in<br>
order from the top of the screen to the bottom, and from left to right. The top left corner of<br>
each video window may be used as its point of reference when creating the select order for the<br>
displayed windows. If two or more windows have the same point of reference, then the<br>
windows will be selected in top to bottom order according to their stacking in the overlay. A<br>
system with a more sophisticated controller 112 and remote control 130 combination may<br>
allow a user to directly indicate which of the displayed programs should be recorded, e.g. by<br>
pressing digit buttons 135.<br>
One skilled in the art will recognize that known Copy Generation Management System<br>
(CGMS) markers may be present in some of the received programs. These markers will be<br>
detected and recognized by known circuitry (not shown) in the television receiver. The<br>
controller 112 will receive a status signal (not shown) from the detection and recognition<br><br>
12<br>
circuitry indicating if such markers are present in a displayed program, thereby indicating that<br>
the program is not available for recording. When in the record menu system a graphical<br>
and/or text cue will be used to indicate those programs which are marked as not available for<br>
recording by such markers. For example, when moving the selection from one displayed<br>
program to another by activating the arrow button on the confirmation box (128a, 128b),<br>
those programs that are not available for record will be automatically skipped. Some systems,<br>
however, may allow for direct selection of a program window for recording, e.g. by pressing<br>
the number buttons 135 on the remote control 130. In this case, an attempt to select a<br>
program that is not available for record will trigger the display of an on-screen message,<br>
similar in form to the confirmation boxes 128a and 128b, that explains that the program may<br>
not be recorded.<br>
If the selected record program is a standard definition television signal, i.e. MPEG<br>
Main Profile, Main Level or less, then the MPEG decoder 10 will be conditioned by the<br>
controller 112 to decode the record program in full resolution, because there is enough<br>
decoder 10 bandwidth to simultaneously decode a standard definition and a high definition<br>
television program (for the display device 108, for example) at full resolution. If, however,<br>
the selected record program is a high definition television signal, then the MPEG decoder 10<br>
will not have sufficient bandwidth to simultaneously decode both the selected record program<br>
and another high definition television program at full resolution. Typically the record program<br>
would be decoded at partial resolution. However, in some cases, a user may wish to record a<br>
program at NTSC resolution without the artifacts introduced by the partial resolution decoder<br>
102. Referring to Figure 4, if the selected record program is a high definition television signal<br>
then the controller 112 will generate an OSD in a known manner in which the user will be<br>
prompted to select between decoding the record program using the full resolution decoder<br>
104 or the partial resolution decoder 102, as illustrated in Figure 4a. If the user selects the full<br>
resolution decoder 104, then the user is informed that it is not possible for another high<br>
definition programs to be decoded and displayed while the record is in progress (because there<br>
is insufficient bandwidth in the MPEG video decoder 10), as illustrated in Figure 4b. If the<br>
user selects the partial resolution decoder 102, then the user is informed that there are no<br><br>
13<br>
restrictions on what other programs may be decoded and displayed while the recording is in<br>
progress, as illustrated in Figure 4c. Once all the appropriate selections have been made by<br>
the user, the selected program, decoded in the selected manner, is started.<br>
Referring to Figure 5a, after recording of the selected program is started, the user will<br>
be asked whether the user desires to record this program on a schedule. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, the controller 112 generates an OSD banner 142 on the bottom of the screen<br>
which asks the user to press 'Select' to add this program to the record schedule. Referring to<br>
Figure 5b, if the user presses the select button 134 on the remote control 130, a record<br>
schedule menu 144 will be displayed under the control of the controller 112. Those fields that<br>
can be filled in based on information known about the selected program will be shown with the<br>
appropriate data already entered. The cursor will be placed in the field that allows a user to<br>
select the frequency of the record event. The user may then enter desired information using<br>
the remote control 130 in a known manner. The controller 112 receives this information, and<br>
generates an appropriate schedule entry containing the user-entered information.<br>
As described above, if a high definition television program is being decoded at full<br>
resolution for recording, then the user is restricted to standard definition television programs<br>
only for viewing on the display device 108. This restriction may be enforced in different ways.<br>
One, simple, approach would be for the controller 112 to condition the display device 108 to<br>
display a black screen when an attempt is made to display a high definition television program<br>
on the display device 108. The controller 112 may further generate an OSD, to be overlaid<br>
atop the black screen, with a message informing the user that the requested program is not<br>
available while recording is in progress. The OSD may also simply give the user the option to<br>
terminate the record session and change channels to display the desired program on the display<br>
device 108 (not shown). Alternatively, the OSD may give the user the option of continuing the<br>
record session, by switching to partial resolution decoding of the record program, and change<br>
channels to display the desired program on the display device 108, or continue the record<br>
session and ignore the channel change request, as illustrated in Figure 4d. Referring to Figure<br>
4d, pressing the select button 134 in this context would condition the controller 112 to display<br><br>
14<br>
the confirmation box illustrated in Figure 4c. This confirmation box would allow the user to<br>
either confirm or cancel the channel change for display and resolution change for the record<br>
program, by appropriate pressing of the directional buttons 132 and the select button 134, in<br>
the manner described above. Alternatively, the user may manipulate the directional buttons<br>
132 and select button 134 to continue the high resolution recording and ignore the channel<br>
change. In response, the controller 112 displays the confirmation box illustrated in Figure 4b,<br>
that again would allow the user to either confirm or cancel continuing the record session, by<br>
appropriate pressing of the directional buttons 132 and the select button 134.<br>
Another approach to enforce the MPEG video decoder 10 restrictions, described<br>
above, would be for the controller 112 to implement what will be termed in this application an<br>
intelligent channel scan. When the record output terminal 15 video signal is being generated<br>
from a high definition television signal using the full resolution decoder 104, the controller 112<br>
would generate program guide listings (Figure 6a) from which all other channels broadcasting<br>
high definition television material would automatically be removed. Attempts by a user to<br>
directly enter the channel number, e.g. using the digit keys 135 on the remote control 130, for<br>
a channel that carries a high definition television signal would be detected by the controller<br>
112, which would generate the above mentioned OSDs (Figures 4b, 4c and 4d) atop a black<br>
screen explaining that the requested channel is not available while recording is in progress.<br>
The same options would then be presented to cancel the record operation.<br>
If the high definition television program selected for recording had been previously<br>
scheduled for a future time (see Figure 5 and associated description), then a second high<br>
definition television program may be decoded by the full resolution decoder 104 and displayed<br>
on the display device 108 until the scheduled record start time arrives. However, if the end<br>
time of the high definition television program being viewed would overlap the recording start<br>
time for the scheduled record program, then the controller 112 will generate a warning banner<br>
(similar to 142), to be displayed e.g. across the bottom of the screen of the display device 108<br>
in a known manner, stating that it will not be possible to continue viewing this program after<br>
the scheduled recording begins. If the currently displayed program is a high definition<br><br>
15<br>
television program, is being decoded in full resolution using the decoder 104, and does not<br>
carry information about its end time, then the controller 112 will generate such a warning<br>
banner automatically. It is further possible for the controller 112 to display the warning<br>
banner only after a user has displayed the channel on the display device 108 for some<br>
minimum time period. It is further possible for the controller to remove the banner from the<br>
display device 108 after a brief time, on the order of several seconds, or in response to the<br>
user pressing the clear button (not shown) on the remote control 130. In addition, the<br>
controller 112 may display a warning message in the top right corner of the display device 108<br>
prior to the start of the recording, for example, around 1 minute before the starting time for<br>
recording. This displayed message also will offer the user the opportunity to enter the record<br>
menu and preempt the scheduled recording.<br>
The user also has the opportunity at any time to enter the record menu system to<br>
create, modify or delete scheduled recording events. This menu is accessed through the TV<br>
main menu and may be accessed by pressing the menu button 138 on the remote control 130.<br>
The controller 112, in response to detecting the press of the menu button 138 will display a<br>
menu with several entries on the display device 108, in a known manner. One of those entries<br>
will be "schedule". By appropriate pressing of the directional buttons 132 and the select<br>
button 134, the controller 112 will similarly display a "schedule" menu, with several entries.<br>
One of those entries will be "record". Again, by appropriate pressing of the directional<br>
buttons 132 and the select button 134, the controller 112 will display a recording scheduling<br>
display. This is identical to the recording scheduling display 144 illustrated in Figure 5b. By<br>
entering appropriate information in response to the prompts, all in a known manner, a program<br>
may be scheduled for future recording.<br>
As described above, one or more of the data streams in the digital data at the input<br>
terminal 5 may carry program guide information, including channel numbers, starting and<br>
ending times (or durations), names and brief descriptions of all the programs present in the<br>
digital data. Referring to Figure 1, this information may be extracted by the selector 98, and<br>
the data in those data streams provided to the controller 112. Referring to Figure 6a, this data<br><br>
16<br>
may be processed by the controller 112 to generate a tabular display of this information. The<br>
user may condition the controller 112 to show this table on the display device 108, and then<br>
may select programs to watch or record from the information in the displayed table on the<br>
display device 108 by manipulating the directional keys and select key on the remote control<br>
130, all in a known manner. In Figure 6a, the television program "Six Million Dollar Man"<br>
has been selected by the user, and appears highlighted. In Figure 6a, the entry is highlighted<br>
by having a white background. One skilled in the art will understand that any method of<br>
highlighting may be used.<br>
The record menu may be invoked directly from the program guide display by selecting<br>
a program using the directional buttons 132, as described above, and then pressing the record<br>
button 136 on the remote control 130. As described above, when a program is selected for<br>
recording, the controller 112 generates an OSDs asking for confirmation, as illustrated in<br>
Figures 4a, 4b and/or 4c. When the program that is selected for record is scheduled to occur<br>
at some future time it may be necessary for the user to choose whether the program will be<br>
recorded using the full resolution (104) or partial resolution (102) decoder, as illustrated in<br>
Figure 4d. The illustrated system will support different on-screen program guide data streams.<br>
Some of the program guides provide information about the definition of the program, i.e.<br>
standard definition versus high definition. If the program guide indicates that the selected<br>
record program is a high definition television program, the user will be immediately prompted<br>
for a record resolution, as described in detail above.<br>
The user interface system described above is intended for use in a television program<br>
distribution system carrying high-definition television (HDTV) and standard definition video<br>
signals, and containing a decoder having a bandwidth in which more than one channel can be<br>
decoded simultaneously, subject to the maximum bandwidth of the decoder. In particular, if a<br>
user instructs such a distribution system to record a program on a standard-definition medium<br>
(e.g., VHS tape), and if the system requires that one of two high-definition format programs<br>
be decoded at a reduced resolution for simultaneous decoding, then the proposed invention<br>
allows the user to choose between two options for recording: either using full resolution<br><br>
17<br>
decoding for the record program and forbidding simultaneous decoding and display of any<br>
other high-definition television program, or using reduced resolution decoding for the record<br>
program, and permitting simultaneous decoding and display of other high-definition television<br>
programs<br><br>
