				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has a rich pharmacology arising from a heterogeneous population of at least 14 distinct receptors.  Each receptor has a distinct, though often overlapping distribution throughout the body and a unique serotonin binding site leading to different affinities for serotonin and different physiological responses to interaction with serotonin.  The 5-HT7 receptor has been shown to have important functional roles in thermoregulation, circadian rhythm, learning and memory, hippocampal signaling, and sleep.  The 5-HT7 receptor has also been linked to various neurological disorders including migraine and anxiety, as well as to persistent pain, more specifically inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain.  <br>
High affinity 5-HT7 receptor antagonists would provide useful therapeutics for the treatment of the above mentioned 5-HT7 receptor-associated disorders including migraine, and persistent pain, particularly, inflammatory and neuropathic pain.  High affinity 5-HT7 receptor antagonists that are also selective for the 5-HT7 receptor would provide such therapeutic benefit without the undesirable adverse events associated with modulation of the other receptor types, as for example the other serotonergic receptor subclasses, such as 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D or alpha adrenergic receptors.  Achieving selectivity for the 5-HT7 receptor over other 5-HT receptor subtypes has proven difficult in designing 5 HT7 antagonists.  5-HT1A receptor agonists have been associated with serotonin syndrome.  5 HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor agonists have been associated with adverse events such as chest pain.  <br>
Leopoldo, M. (2004) “Serotonin(7) receptors (5-HT(7)Rs) and their ligands”  Curr. Med. Chem. 11, 629-661, describes various prior approaches to obtaining 5-HT7 receptor ligands.  WO 2004/067703 describes 5-HT7 antagonists including certain 2 (piperazin-1-yl)-3-phenyl-pyrazines and pyridines.<br>

The general chemical terms used throughout have their usual meanings.  <br>
	The term “amino protecting group” as used in this specification refers to a substituent commonly employed to block or protect an amino functionality while reacting other functional groups on the compound.  The species of amino protecting group employed is not critical so long as the derivatized amino group is stable to the conditions of subsequent reactions on other positions of the molecule and can be removed at the appropriate point without disrupting the remainder of the molecule.  The selection and use (addition and subsequent removal) of amino protecting groups is well known within the ordinary skill of the art.  Further examples of groups referred to by the above terms are described by T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis”, 3rd edition, John Wiley and Sons, New York, NY, 1999, chapter 7, hereafter referred to as “Greene”.<br>
	The term "pharmaceutical" or “pharmaceutically acceptable” when used herein as an adjective, means substantially non-toxic and substantially non-deleterious to the recipient. <br>
	By "pharmaceutical composition" it is further meant that the carrier, solvent, excipients and/or salt must be compatible with the active ingredient of the composition (e.g. a compound of Formula I).  It is understood by those of ordinary skill in this art that the terms “pharmaceutical formulation” and “pharmaceutical composition” are generally interchangeable, and they are so used for the purposes of this application.<br>
The term "effective amount" means an amount of a compound of Formula I which is capable of antagonizing 5-HT7 receptors and/or eliciting a given pharmacological effect.  <br>
	The term “suitable solvent” refers to any solvent, or mixture of solvents that sufficiently solubilizes the reactants to afford a medium within which to effect the desired reaction and that does not interfere with the desired reaction.<br>
A compound intended for use in a pharmaceutical composition may, where possible and warranted, be converted to a salt form in an effort to optimize such characteristics as the handling properties, stability, pharmacokinetics, and/or bioavailability, etc.  For any compound, it is unpredictable which counterions will produce salt forms, as for example a crystalline salt form, having optimal combinations of properties for the intended use.  Methods for converting a compound to a given salt form are well known in the art (see, e.g., P. Stahl, et al., Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection and Use, (VCHA/Wiley-VCH, 2002); Berge, S.M, Bighley, L.D., and Monkhouse, D.C., J. Pharm. Sci., 66:1, (1977)).  Such salts are also embodiments of this invention.  It is well known that salts can form in various molar ratios with the acid to provide, for example, the hemi-acid, mono-acid, di-acid salt, etc.  Where in the salt formation procedure, the acid is added in a specific stoichiometric ratio, unless otherwise analyzed to confirm, the salt is presumed, but not known, to form in that molar ratio.  <br>
Abbreviations used herein are defined as follows:<br>
“DCM” means dichloromethane.<br>
“MS (ES)” means mass spectroscopy using electrospray ionization.<br>
“SCX chromatography” means chromatography on a SCX column or cartridge.<br>
“SCX column” or “SCX cartridge”, as used herein, refers to a Varian Bond Elute® silica based strong cation exchange resin column or disposable cartridge or equivalent (as for example a SCX-2 cartridge).<br>
While all of the compounds of the present invention are useful as 5-HT7 antagonists, certain classes are preferred, as for example, compounds having any of the following enumerated selections of substituents:  <br>
1)	R1 is selected from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, phenyl optionally substituted with 1 to 2 fluoro groups, or benzyl;<br>
2)	R1 is selected from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, and phenyl optionally substituted with 1 to 2 fluoro groups;<br>
3)	R1 is methyl or ethyl;<br>
4)	R1 is phenyl;<br>
5)	R1 is phenyl, R2 is hydrogen, R3 is chloro and R4 is hydroxy, hydroxymethyl or methoxymethyl;<br>
6)	R4 is hydroxy, hydroxymethyl, or methoxymethyl;<br>
7)	R4 is hydroxy;<br>
8)	R4 is hydroxymethyl;<br>
9)	R4 is methoxymethyl;<br>
10)	R1 is selected from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, and phenyl optionally substituted with 1 to 2 fluoro groups and R4 is hydroxy, hydroxymethyl, or methoxymethy.<br><br>
Generally, pyrazinyl compounds are preferred over pyridyl compounds.  Of pyrazinyl compounds, preferred ones are those having selections of substituents according to any one of paragraphs 1 through 10 above.  Likewise, of pyridyl compounds, preferred compounds are those having selections of substituents according to any one of paragraphs 1 through 10 above.  <br>
Specific preferred compounds of the present invention are those described in the Examples herein, including the free bases and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.  One particularly preferred compound is 3'-[4-(1-Ethyl-5-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-ylmethyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2H-[1,2']bipyridinyl-4-ol or a pharmaceutically accecptable salt thereof, as for example the compound of Example 1.<br>
	The compounds of the present invention can be prepared according to the following synthetic schemes by methods well known and appreciated in the art.  Suitable reaction conditions for the steps of these schemes are well known in the art and appropriate substitutions of solvents and co-reagents are within the skill of the art.  Likewise, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that synthetic intermediates may be isolated and/or purified by various well known techniques as needed or desired, and that frequently, it will be possible to use various intermediates directly in subsequent synthetic steps with little or no purification.  Furthermore, the skilled artisan will appreciate that in some circumstances, the order in which moieties are introduced is not critical.  The particular order of steps required to produce the compounds of Formula I is dependent upon the particular compound being synthesized, the starting compound, and the relative lability of the substituted moieties, as is well appreciated by the skilled chemist.  All substituents, unless otherwise indicated, are as previously defined, and all reagents are well known and appreciated in the art.  <br>
	Scheme I below shows one general synthetic route to obtain compounds of the present invention.    <br>
Scheme I<br><br><br><br>
In this scheme, for compounds of formula VII wherein A is nitrogen, Hal will typically be chloro.  The di-halo piperazine is reacted with N-protected piperazine and a suitable base such as potassium carbonate in an appropriate solvent such as N,N-dimethylacetamide at an elevated temperature to provide compounds of formula VI wherein A is nitrogen.  For compounds of formula VII wherein A is -CH=, Hal is typically bromo or iodo.  The di-halo pyridyl is coupled with N-protected piperazine under suitable catalytic coupling conditions well known in the art (John P. Wolfe and Stephen L. Buchwald. Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 10, p.423 (2004); Vol. 78, p.23 (2002)) to provide compounds of formula VI (A is CH).<br>
Compounds of formula VI can be de-protected under conditions well known to a skilled artisan (For example, see:  Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, 1999, Chapters 2 and 7, John Wiley and Sons Inc.,) to provide amines of formula III.  The amines are further reacted with appropriate pyrazole aldehydes under reductive amination conditions well known to a skilled artisan (Richard C. Larock , Comprehensive Organic Transformations, Second Edition, 1999, Page 835-846, Wiley and Sons Inc., ) to provide compounds of formula II.  Compounds of formula II can then react with appropriately substituted piperidines that are either commercially available or that may be made by methods well known in the art to provide the desired free bases I. If desired, the free bases be converted to a salt form by means well known in the art, as for example by reaction with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid.<br>
Alternatively, intermediates of formula VI can be reacted with piperidines VIII at elevated temperature to provide intermediates of formula V.  The intermediates V are then de-protected under conditions well known to the skilled artisan to provide compounds of formula IV.  The resulting amines are then reacted with appropriate pyrazole aldehydes under reductive amination conditions well known to a skilled artisan to provide compounds of formula I.  <br>
Scheme II<br><br>
Substituted pyrazoles are either commercial available or may be synthesized by generally known procedures, as for example the procedure shown in Scheme II where variables R1, R2, and R3 are as previously defined. When R2 does not equal R3, the regio-isomeric products from the cyclization must be separated with common chromatographic techniques.  If XII is a labile aldehyde, XII will typically be in the form of an acetal. Compounds of formula XII are reacted with suitable hydrazines to provide compounds of formula XI.  Intermediates XI are then reacted with POCl3 in a suitable solvent such as dimethylformamide at an elevated temperature to provide the desired intermediates of formula IX. <br><br>
Scheme III<br><br><br><br>
Variations on the chemistry can be used where the aldehyde precursors are incorporated into the cyclization precursors as shown in Scheme III.  A compound of formula XIV reacts with a suitable hydrazine to provide a pyrazole ester of formula XIII, which is reduced with a suitable reducing agent such as LiAlH4 to provide a pyrazole alcohol of formula XII.  The alcohol can be oxidized with methods well known to a skilled artisan to provide the desired pyrazole aldehyde of formula IX.  <br><br>

(Hybritech media is a low calcium modified DMEM/F12 media for supporting cell growth in suspension having the following formula: biotin 7.3 µg/L, calcium chloride anhydride 11 mg/L, choline chloride 8.98 mg/L, cupric sulfate 5 H2O 3.75 µg/L, D glucose (dextrose) 6.00 g/L, DL lipoic acid thioctic 0.21 mg/L, thanolamine HCL 10 mg/L, ferric nitrate 9* H2O  50 µg/L, ferrous sulfate 7*H2O 0.42 mg/L, folic acid 4 mg/L, glycine 30 mg/L, I inositol 12.6 mg/L, L alanine 8.9 mg/L, L arginine HCL 211 mg/L, L asparagine H2O 15 mg/L, L aspartic acid 13.3 mg/L, L cystine 2*HCl 62.6 mg/L, L glutamic acid 7.35 mg/L, L glutamine 1.46 g/L, L histidine HCl H2O 42 mg/L, L isoleucine, 105 mg/L, L leucine 105 mg/L, L lysine HCl 146 mg/L, L methionine 30 mg/L, L phenylalanine 66 mg/L, L proline 17.25 mg/L, L serine 42 mg/L, L threonine 95 mg/L, L tryptophan 16 mg/L, L tyrosine disodium salt 104 mg/L, L valine 94 mg/L, magnesium chloride anhydrate 28.64 mg/L, magnesium sulfate anhydrate 48.84 mg/L, niacinamide 4 mg/L, KCl 311.8 mg/L, purescine 2*HC l 0.08 mg/L, pyridoxal HCl 4 mg/L, pyridoxine HCl 30 µg/L, riboflavin 0.4 mg/L, NaCl 5.50 g/L, sodium hypoxanthine 4.77 mg/L, sodium pantothenate 4 mg/L, sodium phosphate di-basic anhydrate 71.2 mg/L, sodium phosphate mono-basic 62.5 mg/L, sodium pyruvate 220 mg/L, sodium selenite 5.00 µg/L, thiamine HCl 4 mg/L, thymidine 0.73 mg/L, vitamin B-12 0.68 mg/L, zinc sulfate 7*H2O 0.43 mg/L.)  The cells are grown overnight to condition the media.  The next morning the conditioned media (~150 mL total) is removed and set aside in a sterile container.  The cells are trypsinized and collected in the conditioned media.  Fresh suspension media is added to bring the total volume to 500 mL and a cell density of 5 x 105cells/mL.  The suspension culture volume is repeatedly increased over the next 3 weeks to the desired volume and density until harvest (approx. 3.5 - 4.0 x106 cells per mL targeted cell density).  Cells are harvested by centrifugation at 1,500g at 4 °C for 30 min.  The supernatant is decanted and the cell pellets are resuspended in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS).  The cell suspension is aliquoted into 50 mL centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 1,500g at 4 °C for 15 min.  The supernatant is removed, the pellets are weighed, and then frozen on dry ice. <br>
To prepare membranes, the above pellets are resuspended in ice-cold Tris buffer (20 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4 at 23 °C, 5 mM EDTA) and homogenized with a Wheaton tissue grinder.  The lysate is subsequently centrifuged at 200 x g for 5 min. at 4 °C to pellet large fragments which are discarded.  The supernatant is collected and centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 60 min. at 4 °C.  The resulting pellet is resuspended in a final buffer containing 50 mM Tris HCl and 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4.  Membrane preparations are snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at -80oC.  Protein concentrations are determined by the method of Bradford. Anal. Biochem., 72:248-254, 1976.<br>
For cAMP functional assays, the 5-HT7-expressing cells from above are grown in 150 cm2 flasks and processed essentially as follows.  The media is aspirated from the flasks and cells are washed with 1mL PBS.  The cells are released from the flask surface using enzyme free cell dissociation solution (Specialty media (www.chemicon.com) CAT#S-004-B) and resuspended in complete media.  A sample of the cells is counted and the remainder is centrifuged as above for 3 min.  The resulting cell pellet is resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells per mL and used directly in the cAMP assay as described.<br><br>
5-HT7 receptor affinity: Radioligand binding assay:	<br>
[3H] 5-HT binding is performed using modifications of the assay conditions reported by Kahl et al.(J. Biomo.l Screen, 2: 33-40 (1997), essentially as follows.  Radioligand binding assays are conducted in 96-well microtiter plates, in a total volume of 125 ?l containing the following reaction buffer: 50 mM Tris, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 10 mM pargyline, 0.1% ascorbate, pH 7.4 at room temperature.  Competition binding is conducted using eleven test compound concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10,000 nM, in the presence of 1 nM [3H]5-HT.  Unlabeled 5-HT (10 ?M) is used to define nonspecific binding.  The binding reaction is initiated by addition of 0.15 ?g of membrane homogenate (2.31 ng/?L, 65 ?L per well) and 0.5 mg of scintillation proximity assay fluoromicrospheres.  The reactions are incubated at room temperature for 3 hr. and then counted in a Trilux Microbeta™ scintillation counter to detect receptor-bound radioligand.  Binding data are analyzed by computer-assisted 4 parameter fit analysis (ID Business Solutions Ltd, Guildford, Surrey, UK).  IC50 values are converted to Ki values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation.  Biochem. Pharmacol., 22:3099-3108 (1973).  <br>
Exemplified compounds are tested essentially as described and found to have Ki values 
	Affinity for other serotonin receptor subtypes as well as for alpha 1 &amp; 2 adrenergic receptors can readily be determined by modification of the above described radioligand receptor binding assay using membranes derived from cells stably expressing the desired receptor subtype including the 5 HT1A, 5 HT1B ,and 5 HT1D subtypes, as well as the 5 HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5 HT4, 5 HT5, and 5 HT6 receptor subtypes.  The selectivity ratio of Ki-x / Ki-5HT7 , where Ki-x is the Ki for the receptor being compared, is indicative of the relative affinity of a compound for the 5-HT7 receptor.  Exemplified compounds are tested and found to have selectivity ratios against other serotonergic receptors of &gt; 4 and against andronergic receptors of &gt; 4.  The compound of Example 1 is tested essentially as described and is found to have the following selectivity profile:<br>
Receptor	Ex. 1<br>
Ki (nM)<br>
5 HT1A 	213<br>
5 HT1B 	&gt;3580<br>
5 HT1D 	1840<br>
5 HT2A 	&gt;7470<br>
5-HT2B 	&gt;6810<br>
5-HT2C 	&gt;8360<br>
5 HT4 	(not tested)<br>
5 HT5 	4550<br>
5 HT6	&gt;5830<br>
5 HT7	16.2<br>
alpha 1 adrenergic	1380<br>
alpha 2 adrenergic	&gt;2670<br><br>
Functional antagonist assay:  Measurement of cAMP formation:	<br>
The 5-HT7 receptor is functionally coupled to a G-protein as measured by the ability of serotonin and serotonergic drugs to stimulate cAMP production in CHO cells transfected with the 5-HT7 receptor.  (Ruat, et al., Proceedings  of the National Academy of Sciences (USA), 90:8547-8551, 1993.)  Accordingly, functional receptor activity can be measured by measuring adenylate cyclase activity using a commercially available cell-based, homogeneous, time resolved fluorescence assay kit, as for example the kit produced by Cisbio-US, Inc. (Bedford, MA).  Essentially, and using the protocol and reagents provided by the manufacturer, approximately 20,000 human 5-HT7 receptor-expressing AV-12 cells (as described above) are used with test compound dose concentrations in the range described for the binding assay.  EC-90 dose-response curves for 5-HT are measured in parallel to demonstrate competitive antagonism.  A cAMP standard curve is also run in every experiment.  After the assay plates are read in an Envision™ instrument (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley MA), the data are normalized to the standard curve and converted to percent inhibition for data analysis as described above for the receptor binding assay results.  The Kb (nM) is calculated as a measure of the antagonist potency of the compound.  Preferred compounds are those having percent inhibition &gt; 75%.  Still other preferred compounds are those having Kb

Animal Model of Dural Plasma Protein Extravasation (PPE).<br>
The dural plasma protein extravasation model is an established model for migraine.  The ability of a test compound to reduce extravasation of plasma proteins into the dura under assay conditions is considered indicative of the compound’s ability to reduce or prevent the dural inflammation thought to be symptomatic of migraine.  (see Johnson, K.W., et al., Neuroreport, 8 (1997) 2237-2240.)<br>
To assay compounds for their ability to reduce or prevent dural plasma protein extravasation, male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (250-350 g) are anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (65 mg/kg, i.p.) and placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments) with the incisor bar set at -2.5 mm.  Following a midline sagital scalp incision, 2 pairs of bilateral holes are drilled through the skull (3.2 mm posterially, 1.8 and 3.8 mm laterally, all coordinates referenced to bregma).  Pairs of stainless steel stimulating electrodes, insulated except at the tips (Rhodes Medical Systems, Inc.), are lowered through the holes in both hemispheres to a depth of 9.2 mm.<br>
Test compound is administered intravenously (i.v.) to the femoral vein at a dosing volume of 1 mL/kg.  Approximately 8 min. post injection, the animals are dosed with Fluorescein isothiocyanate–bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA) (20 mg/kg, i.v.).  The FITC-BSA functions as a marker for protein extravasation.  Ten min. post-injection of the test compound, the left trigeminal ganglion is electrically stimulated for 5 min. at a current intensity of 1.0 mA (5 Hz, 5 msec pulse every 200 msec) with a Model S48 Grass Instrument Stimulator with PSIU6 photoelectric isolation unit (Grass-Telefactor).<br>
Alternatively, rats fasted overnight are dosed orally with test compound via gavage at a volume of 2 mL/kg.  Approximately 50 min. post dosing, the animals are anesthetized and placed in the stereotaxic frame as described above.  The animals are dosed with FITC-BSA (20 mg/kg, i.v.) at 58 min. post-p.o. dosing.  Sixty min. post compound dosing, the animals are electrically stimulated as described above.<br>
Five min. following the termination of stimulation, the animals are killed by exsanguination with 40 mL of saline.  The top of the skull is removed and the dural membrane samples are removed from both hemispheres, rinsed with water, and spread flat on microscopic slides.  Once dried, the tissues are coverslipped with a 70% glycerol/water solution.<br>
The amount of FITC-BSA for each sample is quantified with a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a grating monochromator, a spectrophotometer, and a computer driven stage.  Fluorescence measurements are taken at 25 points in a 5x5 grid in 500 ?m steps on each dural sample with an excitation wavelength of approximately 490 nm and emission intensity measured at approximately 535 nm.  The mean and standard deviation of the 25 measurements are determined.<br>
The extravasation induced by the electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion is an ipsilateral effect (i.e. occurs only on the side of the dura in which the trigeminal ganglion was stimulated).  This allows the use of the other (unstimulated) half of the dura as a control.  The ratio of the amount of extravasation in the dura from the stimulated side, over the amount of extravasation in the unstimulated side, is calculated.  Control animals dosed only with saline, yield a ratio of approximately 2.0.  In contrast, a compound which effectively prevented the extravasation in the dura from the stimulated side would yield a ratio of approximately 1.0.<br>
Preferred compounds are those that effectively prevent extravasation.  The compound of Example 1 is assayed essentially as described and is found to have an ID100 of 0.1 mg/Kg, providing a ratio of about 1.15.<br>
	While it is possible to administer compounds employed in the methods of this invention directly without any formulation, the compounds are usually administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as an active ingredient and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent and/or excipient.  These compositions can be administered by a variety of routes including oral, sublingual, buccal, intranasal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, and pulmonary.  Such pharmaceutical compositions and processes for preparing them are well known in the art. See, e.g., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, ed., 21st ed., Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins Co., 2005).<br>
	The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 0.1 to about 200 mg, more usually about 1.0 to about 30 mg, of the active ingredient.  The term "unit dosage form" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with at least one suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent and/or excipient.<br>
	The compounds are generally effective over a wide dosage range.  For example, dosages per day will normally fall within the range of about 0.01 to about 30 mg/kg, as for example within the range of about 0.1 to about 15 mg/kg/day, in single or divided dose.  However, it will be understood that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound or compounds administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, and the severity of the patient's symptoms, and therefore the above dosage ranges are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way.  In some instances dosage levels below the above lower limit may be adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be used. <br>
A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention comprising a compound, as an active ingredient such as herein described in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient showed unexpected, surprising and enhanced results.  Therefore, the said composition is synergistic.<br>
The type of formulation employed for the administration of the compounds employed in the methods of the present invention may be dictated by the particular compound employed, the type of pharmacokinetic profile desired from the selected route of administration, and the state of the patient.<br><br>
