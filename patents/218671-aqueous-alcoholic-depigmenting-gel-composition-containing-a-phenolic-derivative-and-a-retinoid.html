				<td>Aqueous-Alcoholic Depigmenting Gel<br>
The invention relates to a depigmenting composition for cosmetic or pharmaceutical application, comprising a phenolic derivative, a retinoid, especially a dispersed retinoid, and optionally a sunscreen, in the form of an aqueous-alcoholic gel.<br>
By virtue of its composition, this gel provides the composition with both stability and harmlessness.<br>
Among the therapeutic agents recommended in the treatment of cutaneous hyperpigmentation, phenolic derivatives such as hydroquinone and derivatives thereof have for decades been among the active agents that are the most effective. The therapeutic use of these agents results from the observation of cutaneous depigmentation in the case of operatives in the rubber industry, in which some of these products are used as antioxidants. Subsequently, numerous studies have confirmed their efficacy, alone or combined with other depigmenting agents [Jorge L. Sanchez, M.D. and Miguel Vazquez, M.D. International Journal of Dermatology Jan-Feb 1982 Vol. 21, pp. 55-58]. They are thus found to be active agents that are virtually indispensable in the treatment of hyperpigmentation and are consequently present in many commercial products. Hydroquinone has been the subject of various patent application filings, and in particular patent US 3 856 934 in which hydroquinone is in combination with retinoic acid and a corticoid, as a depigmenting composition.<br>
However, the incorporation of a phenolic derivative such as hydroquinone presents, inter alia, two major drawbacks.<br>
Firstly, the degradation of formulations containing phenolic derivatives such as hydroquinone, alone or in combination with other active principles, is often observed. Specifically, hydroquinone is known for its sensitivity to oxidation and to heat, resulting in reduced efficacy, rapid browning of the formulations and occasionally<br><br>
even demixing or phase separation of the formulation.<br>
This problem is found to be an obstacle to obtaining compositions containing several active agents, especially a phenolic derivative and a retinoid.<br>
In the prior art, sulphite salts are conventionally used to reduce this phenomenon, but they are insufficient to overcome this drawback. They can also impair the viscosity of electrolyte-sensitive formulations and thereby result in sedimentation of the active agents (for example retinoids). Specifically, the carbomers conventionally used to provide a minimum level of viscosity are affected by the electrolytes of sulphite salts and are therefore no longer sufficient alone to allow good stability of the retinoid.<br>
Furthermore, to accelerate their dissolution, phenolic derivatives such as hydroquinone are often exposed to heat during the preparation of the composition, especially in standard emulsions, this phenomenon initiating and accelerating the browning phenomenon.<br>
The second drawback caused by the presence of phenolic derivatives such as hydroquinone, alone or in combination with other active agents, in the composition is their high irritant power.<br>
As a result of its irritant power, hydroquinone at high concentration can give rise to post-inflammatory hypermelanosis and ochronosis phenomena.<br>
Local irritation and dermatitis may develop after a prolonged use of hydroquinone at high concentration ["N-acetyl4S cysteaminylphenol as a new type of depigmenting agent" Jimbow K. Arch. Dermatol. 1991 Oct; 127 (10): 1528-1534].<br>
Treatment with hydroquinone may be accompanied by irritation that may lead to a post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. The incidence of the irritation depends on the hydroquinone concentration. This irritation is relatively high for 10% concentrations and reduces greatly for preparations with a 5% dose, and is considered to be virtually nonexistent at a concentration of 2% ["Les agents chimiques depigmentants (Depigmenting chemical agents)" JP. Ortonne Ann.<br><br>
Dermatol. Venerol. 1986, 113: 733-736].<br>
The selected composition may thus play a predominant role in minimizing these effects and improving the tolerance of a composition containing two potentially irritant active principles.<br>
The problem posed is thus that of proposing a composition containing a phenolic derivative and a retinoid that are physically stable over time, thus ensuring that the formulation remains unchanged. The product must also show good cosmeticity and have little irritant nature.<br>
The Applicant has discovered, surprisingly, that an aqueous-alcoholic gel containing suitable excipients gives good results in terms of physical and chemical stability. It also offers an excellent compromise between stability, especially to temperature and oxidation, efficacy, harmlessness and cosmeticity.<br>
i<br>
The Applicant has also developed a process for manufacturing the composition according to the invention, which may be prepared under cold conditions, without heating, thus making it possible to avoid exposing the phenolic derivative to heat.<br>
The invention thus relates to a depigmenting composition comprising, in a physiologically acceptable medium, a phenolic derivative, a retinoid, especially a dispersed retinoid, and optionally a sunscreen, characterized in that it is an aqueous-alcoholic gel.<br>
The term "aqueous-alcoholic gel" means an aqueous gel containing alcohol and at least one gelling agent, and optionally containing a small proportion (up to 15%) of fatty phase.<br>
All proportions are expressed as weight percentages relative to the total weight of the composition.<br>

Preferably, the retinoid is a compound chosen from the family of benzonaphthalene-based retinoids as described in patent application EP 0 199 636. Adapalene (6-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-methoxyphenyl]-2-naphthoic acid) and precursors and/or derivatives thereof will be preferred in particular. Tretinoin and isotretinoin may also be used.<br>
