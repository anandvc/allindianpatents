				<td>The present invention pertains to new haloalkyl carboxamides, several processes for their synthesis and their use for combating undesired microorganisms.<br>
It is already known that numerous carboxamides possess fungicidal properties (see, for example, WO 03/010149, WO 02/059086, EP-A 0 824 099, EP-A 0 737 682, EP-A 0 591 699, EP-A 0 589 301, EP-A 0 545 099, DE-A 24 09 011, DE-A 20 06 472, JP-A 2001-302605, JP-A 10-251240, JP-A 8-176112, JP-A 8-92223 and JP-A 53-72823). Thus numerous alkyl carboxamides have already become known that are not substituted in the alkyl portion, such as, for example, N-allyl-N-[2-(l,3-dimethylbutyl)phenyl]-l-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-lH-pyrazole-4-carboxamide from WO 02/059086, N-[2-(l,3-dimethylbutyl)-phenyl]-2,4-dimethyl-l,3-thiazole-5-carboxamide from EP-A 0 824 099 and 5-fluoro-l,3-dimethyl-N-[2-(l,3,3-trimethylbutyl)phenyl]-lH-pyrazole-4-carboxarnide from WO 03/010149. The effectiveness of these materials is good, but they leave something to be desired in many cases, for example at low application rates.<br>

The inventive active substances also show a considerable strengthening effect in plants. Thus they are suited for mobilization of the plants' own defenses against infestation by undesirable microorganisms.<br>
In this context, plant-strengthening (resistance-inducing) materials are to be considered those substances that are able to stimulate the immune system of plants such that the plants treated show extensive resistance against undesired microorganisms when subsequently inoculated with these microorganisms.<br>
In the present context, undesired microorganisms are to be understood as phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses. The inventive materials can also be used to protect plants against infestation by the pathogens cited for a certain period after treatment. The period during which this protection is provided generally lasts from one to 10 days, preferably one to seven days after treatment of the plants with the active substances.<br>
The active substances show good compatibility with plants at the concentrations needed to combat plant diseases, enabling treatment of above-ground plant parts, plant seed stock and soil.<br>
In this regard, the inventive active substances can be used with particularly good success to combat<br>
diseases of grain, such as, for example, those caused by Puccinia species, and of diseases in the vinoculture, fruit and vegetable farming, such as, for example, those caused by Botrytis, Venturia or Alternaria species.<br>
The inventive active substances are also suited for increasing harvest yields. Furthermore, they have low toxicity and show good compatibility with plants.<br>
If necessary, at particular concentrations and application rates, the inventive active substances can also be used as herbicides, influencers of plant growth, as well as to fight animal pests. They can also be used as intermediates and starting products for for synthesizing other active substances.<br>
All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. As plants in this context, all plants and plant populations are meant, such as desirable wild plants and undesired wild plants (weeds) or cultured plants (including natural occurring cultured plants). Cultured plants can be plants that can be obtained through conventional breeding and optimization methods or through methods of biotechnology and gene technology or a combination of these methods, including transgenic plants and including those plant types which may be eligible or not be eligible for plant variety protection under law. Plant parts should be understood as all above-ground and subterranean parts and organs of plants, such as sprout, leaf, flower and root, whereby, for example, leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruiting bodies, fruits and seeds as well as roots, tubers and rhizomes are listed. Plant parts also include harvest product as well as vegetative and generative propagation material, such as cuttings, tubers, rhizomes, scions and seeds.<br>
The treatment of plants and plant parts with the active substances in accordance with the invention is done directly or by acting on their environment, habitat or storage space by conventional treatment methods, such as by immersion, spraying, vapor exposure, fogging, scattering, spreading and by propagation material, particularly seeds, furthermore by single or multi-layered coverage.<br>
In material protection, the inventive materials can be used to protect technical materials against infestation and destruction by undesirable microorganisms.<br>
Technical materials in this context are to be understood as non-living materials for use in technology. For example, technical materials that are to be protected from microbial change or destruction by active substances according to the invention can be adhesives, glues, paper and cardboard, textiles, leather, wood, paints and plastic articles, cooling lubricants and other materials that can be infested or destroyed by microorganisms. Parts of production systems that can be<br>
adversely affected by an increase of microorganisms, such as cooling water circuits, also fall within the scope of materials to be protected. Technical materials within the scope of the present invention include preferably adhesives, glues, papers and cardboards, leather, wood, paints, cooling lubricants and heat transfer fluids, particularly preferably wood.<br>
Microorganisms that can effect degradation or a change in technical materials include, for example, include bacteria, fungi, yeasts, algae and slime organisms. The inventive active substances act preferentially against fungi, especially molds, wood-discoloring and wood-destroying fungi (Basidiomycetes) as well as against slime organisms and algae.<br>

The active substances can be compounded, depending on their particular physical and/or chemical properties, in typical formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, suspensions, powders, foams, pastes, granulates, aerosols, microencapsulations in polymeric materials and in coatings for seeds, as well as ultra-low volume cold and warm fog formulations.<br>
These formulations are produced according to known methods, such as by mixing the active substances with extenders, i.e. liquid solvents, pressurized, liquified gases and/or solid carrier materials, if necessary with the use of surface-active materials, i.e. emulsifiers and/or dispersing agents and/or foam-producing materials. In the case that water is used as an extender, organic solvents can also be used as solubility aids for example. The following liquid solvents are the main ones to be considered: aromatics, such as xylene, toluene or alkyl naphthalene, chlorinated<br>
aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane or paraffins, such as petroleum fractions, alcohols, such as butanol or glycol as well as their ethers and esters, ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as dimethyl formamide and dimethyl sulfoxide, as well as water. Liquified gas extenders or carriers are liquids that are gases at normal temperature and normal pressure, for example aerosol propellants, such as halogenated hydrocarbons, as well as butane, propane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Solid carriers to be considered for are, for example, natural mineral powders, such as kaolines, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth and synthetic mineral powders, such as highly disperse silica, aluminum oxide and silicates. Solid carriers to be considered for granulates are, for example, crushed and fractionated natural minerals such as calcite, pumice, marble, sepiolite, dolomite as well as synthetic granulates from inorganic and organic powders as well as granulates from organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, corn cobs and tobacco stalks. Emulsifiers and/or foam-producing materials to be considered are, for example, non-ionizable and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene-fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene-fatty alcohol ethers, such as alkyl aryl polyglycol ethers, alkyl sulfonates, alkyl sulfates, aryl sulfonates as well as protein hydrolysates. Dispersing agents to be considered are, for example, lignin, sulfite waste liquors and methyl cellulose.<br>
Formulations can also include bonding agents like carboxymethyl cellulose, natural and synthetic polymers in powdered, granular or latex-like form, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate, as well as natural phospholipids, such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids. Other additives can be mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
Dyes, such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide, Prussian blue and organic dyes, such as alizarin, azo and metal phthalocyanine dyes and trace elements, such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc can be used.<br>
The formulations usually contain between 0.1 and 95 weight percent of the active substance, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The inventive active substances can be used as such or in their formulations, also mixed with known fungicides, bactericides, akacaricides, nematicides or insecticides, in order, for example, to increase the spectrum of effectiveness or prevent the development of resistances. In many cases, synergistic effects are achieved, i.e. the effectiveness of the mixture is greater than the effectiveness of the individual components.<br>

Mixing with other known active substances, such as herbicides or with fertilizers and growth regulators, safeners or semiochemicals is also possible.<br>
In addition, the inventive compounds of the formula (I) also show very good antimycotic activity. They have a very broad spectrum of antimycotic effectiveness, especially against dermatophytes and sprouting fungi, mold and diphasic fungi (for example against Candida species, such as Candida albicans, Candida glabrata) as well as Epidermophyton floccosum, Aspergillus species, such as Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigatus, Trichophyton species, such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporon species, such as Microsporon canis and audouinii. The listing of these fungi in no way represents a limitation of the ascertainable mycotic spectrum, but rather is only explanatory in character.<br>
The active substances can be used as available, in formulations or application forms prepared therefrom, such as ready-to-use solutions, suspensions, spray powder, pastes, soluble powders, scattering agents and granulates. Application takes place in the usual manner, such as by pouring, spraying, showering, scattering, dusting, foam application, spreading, etc. Furthermore, it is possible to apply the active substances according to the ultra-low volume process or to inject the active substance itself into the ground. Seeds of the plants can also be treated.<br>
For the use of the inventive active substances as fungicides, the application rates can be varied over a wide range, depending on the type of application. For treatment of plant parts, the application rates of active substance generally lie between 0.1 and 10,000 g/ha, preferably between<br>
10 and 1,000 g/ha. For treatment of seeds, the application rates of active substance generally lie between 0.001 and 50 g per kilogram of seed, preferably between 0.01 and 10 g per kilogram of seed. For soil treatment, the application rates of active substance generally lie between 0.1 and 10,000 g/ha, preferably between 1 and 5,000 g/ha.<br>
As mentioned above, all plants and their parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. In a preferred embodiment, naturally occurring plant types and varieties and their parts can be treated, as well as those obtained by conventional biological cultivation methods, such as cross-breeding or protoplast fusion. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant types obtained by genetic technology methods, possibly in combination with conventional methods, (genetically modified organisms) and their parts are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" was explained above.<br>
It is particularly preferred that plants typically available commercially in each case or plant types in use be treated in accordance with the invention. The term "plant types" is to be understood as plants with new characteristics ("traits") that have been produced by conventional cultivation, as well as those from mutagenesis or recombinant DNA techniques. These can be types, breeds, biotypes and genotypes.<br>
Depending on the plant varieties or types, their location and growing conditions (soils, climates, vegetation cycle, nutrition), treatment in accordance with the invention can also show synergistic effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or increases in the spectrum of effectiveness and/or an intensification of the activity of the usable materials and agents according to the invention, improved plant growth, increased tolerance of high or low temperatures, increased tolerance of dryness or salt content of water or soil, increased flowering rates, easier harvesting, accelerated ripening, higher harvest yields, higher quality and/or higher nutritional value of the harvested products, improved storage characteristics and/or processability of the harvested products are possible, which go beyond the effects that are actually anticipated.<br>
The category of transgenic plants or plant types (those obtained via genetic technology) to be treated preferentially according to the invention includes all plants that receive genetic material by modification using gene technology, said material giving these plants particularly advantageous, valuable characteristics ("traits"). Examples of such traits are improved plant growth, increased tolerance of high or low temperatures, increased tolerance of dryness or the salt content of water or soil, increased flowering rates, easier harvesting, accelerated ripening, higher harvest yields, higher quality and/or higher nutritional value of the harvested products, improved storage characteristics<br>
and/or processability of the harvested products. Other especially emphasized examples for such traits are an increase in the defenses of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses as well as increased tolerance by the plants of particular herbicidal active substances. Examples of transgenic plants to mention are the important cultured plants, such as grains (wheat, rice), corn, soy, potatoes, cotton, tobacco and rape as well as fruit-bearing plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus and grapes), whereby corn, soy, potatoes, cotton, tobacco and rape are especially emphasized. Especially emphasized traits are increased resistance of plants to insects, cocooning pests, nematodes and snails as a result of toxins produced by the plants, especially those produced in the plants (referred to below as "Bt plants") by genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (such as by the genes CryIA(a), CryIA(b), CryIA(c), CryllA, CrylllA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF as well as their combinations). Especially emphasized traits also include increased resistance of plants to fungi, bacteria and viruses through systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins and elicitors as well as resistance genes and corresponding expressed proteins and toxins. Additional especially emphasized traits are increased tolerance of the plants toward particular herbicidal active substances, such as imidazolinones, sulfonyl ureas, glyphosates or phosphinotricin (such as "PAT" genes). The genes providing the particular desired traits can also occur in combinations with one anothedr in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" are varieties of corn, cotton, soy and potato marketed under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example corn, cotton, soy), KnockOut® (for example corn), StarLink® (for example corn), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucoton® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants are varieties of corn, cotton and soy marketed under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance of glyphosates, for example corn, cotton, soy), Liberty Link® (tolerance of phosphinotricin, for example rape), IMI® (tolerance of imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance of sulfonyl ureas, for example corn). Herbicide-resistant plants (conventionally cultured for herbicide-tolerance) plants are also the varieties marketed under the designation Clearfield® (for example corn). Of course these statements also apply to plant varieties developed or brought to market in the future with these genetic traits or ones developed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can benefit especially from treatment with compounds of general formula (I) or active ingredient mixtures in accordance with the invention. The preferential areas cited above for the active substances or mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Treatment of plants with the compounds or mixtures particularly listed in the present text is especially emphasized.<br>
