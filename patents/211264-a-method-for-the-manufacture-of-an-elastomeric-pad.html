				<td>TITLE:<br>
MANUFACTURE OF AN ELASTOMERIC PAD<br>
This Invention relates to a manufacture of an elastomeric pad,<br>
This invention also relates to the formulation and the preparation of rubber which is used<br>
In the said pad.<br>
Elastomeric pads are metal bonded rubber pad used in Indian Railways as a shock<br>
absorber to protect the bogie and rail from damage under service condition.<br>
Eight number of rubber pads are used for each bogie which is placed between side<br>
frame and adapter. It is subjected to compressive and shear forces of the order of 15<br>
and 04 tones respectively under dynamic condition.<br>
Previously, the pad was manufacture by Research Design &amp; Standard Organisation<br>
(RDSO), Ministry of Railways, Lucknow which had abnormally short life resulting in huge<br>
annual loss of Indian Railways in respect of material and labour cost due to replacement<br>
of those pads. Initially, the pads consisted of two metal plates which could not prevent<br>
the positive bulging and flex crack of rubber. Also in the previous product the possibility<br>
of bond failure and stress relaxation in shear remains. Further,when the train brakes<br>
the wagon has a tendency to move forward due to its kinetic energy and the known pads<br>
are not manufactured to stop or reduce such movement. Thus, to overcome the<br>
shortcomings, the novel design and formulation of the present invention was proposed.<br>
An object of this invention is to propose an elastomeric pad with a novel design.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose an elastomeric pad with a high flex and<br>
fatigue resistant rubber compound.<br>
Still another object of this invention is propose a novel composition of the rubber<br>
compound.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose preparation of rubber compound.<br>
According to this invention, there is provided en elestomertc pad comprising three metal<br>
plates bonded with rubber compound; the top metal plate (A) has a "V" shapped<br>
projection in its bondable area which when bonded with rubber compound forms a<br>
uniform layers, middle plate (B) has two angles, one at the center and the other Is at the<br>
contour and third plate (C) is totally flat.<br>
This invention also relates to the preparation of the rubber compound comprising:<br>
preparing master batch by mixing natural rubber (smoke sheet) and other ingredients;<br>
dividing the said master batch into 3 equal parts;<br>
mixing each part with curative/s;<br>
extruding each part through a twin-screw extruder;<br>
cooling said extrudate;<br>
introducing said cooled extrudate into a 2-roll calender machine to produce sheets;<br>
cutting said sheets to desired size.<br>
The invention will be described in greater detail herein after with reference to<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 povides the produce having metal plates bonded with rubber compound. The<br>
top metal plate (A) has a projected "V" shape part in its bondable area, the middle plate<br>
(B) has two angles, one at the center and the other is at the contour. The third plate (C)<br>
is totally flat.<br>
Figure 2 depicts that in the second layer of rubber the middle plate gives very high<br>
stiffness at the center with lower plate (C), but the ends are of low stiffness value.<br>
The elastomeric pad of the instant invention has 3 layers, the top plate makes a uniform<br>
layer of uniform stress distribution with the second plate except at the end where<br>
stiffness is quite higher than the middle. In the second layer of rubber, the middle plate<br>
gives very high stiffness at the center with the third and the lowest plate but the ends are<br>
of low stiffness value.<br>
In the proposed design, the middle plate is at an angle of 160°<br>
which gives a parallel surface to the projected part of upper<br>
plate. As as result, the lower plate makes an angle of 10° in<br>
both sides of middle plates. Radius of rubber curvature had<br>
been changed from old design and has been made 10R for upper<br>
and 18R for lower part.<br>
Under dynamic condition, the middle part of the top rubber layer<br>
will act as a shock absorbing membrane and the side end parts<br>
of that top layer will absorb a part of the shock and also will<br>
transfer the rest shock to its just next lower portion at second<br>
layer where stiffness is low compared to the middle part of<br>
that layer.<br>
When functioning, the high stiffness zones of the elastomeric<br>
pad are being deflected under load to about 25% of total<br>
deflection and acts as a Primary Suspension. Accordingly, the<br>
low stiffness zones being deflected to about 75% of total<br>
deflection and acts as a Secondary Suspension. Moreover, the<br>
side ends of middle plate will act as a flexible wing also<br>
(Fig.3). As a result, the stress concentration at the side end<br>
of the top rubber layer will be distributed into those two top<br>
and bottom layers. When the train brakes, the wagon has a<br>
tendency to move forward due to its kinetic energy. The proposed<br>
design restricts the wagon to move forward when braking.<br>
The detailed process for the manufacture of elastomeric pad<br>
comprises the following steps:<br>
preparing the master batch in a dispersion knidder by mixing<br>
natural rubber (smoke sheet IX), polybutadiene rubber and other<br>
ingredients such as stearic acid, wood rosin, zinc oxide,<br>
antioxidant such as 2,2,4-trimethyl quinoline (TMQ), N-butyl-<br>
N-isopropyl paraphenylene diamine (6PPD), high abrasion furnace<br>
black (HAF) and semi-reinforcing furnace black (SRF) at 6 kg/sq<br>
cm pneumatic pressure for 10 minutes; dividing said master batch<br>
into 3 equal parts; mixing each part with curative like<br>
N-cyclohexyl 2 benzothiazole-sulphenamide (CBS), extruding each<br>
part through a twin-screw extruder, cooling the extrudate<br>
introducing said extrudate to a 2-roll calender to get the rubber<br>
sheets of uniform thickness; cutting said sheets by automatic<br>
pneumatic cutter to obtain the desired size and length;<br>
treating 3 plates of mild steel with 10% HCl at room temperature<br>
for 10 minutes and drying the same;<br>
shot blasting the said metal sheets by using steel shots;<br>
coating the said blasted metal surface with two layers of<br>
adhesive, i.e one coat of primer bonding adhesive and two coats<br>
of cover bonding adhesive;<br>
fixing the rubber compound between the metal layers, i.e between<br>
first and second metal plates and second and third metal plates;<br>
curing the metal bonded rubber pad in a transfer/compression<br>
moulding press at 140°C-150°C for 25 minutes;<br>
cooling the cured product for 24 hours;<br>
cutting the extra flashes of the pad by using scissors and knife;<br>
and<br>
painting the exposed metallic parts of the elastomeric pad with<br>
anti-corrosive paint.<br>

into 3 equal parts; mixing each part with curative like<br>
N-cyclohexyl 2 benzothiazole-sulphenamide (CBS), extruding each<br>
part through a twin-screw extruder, cooling the extrudate,<br>
introducing said extrudate to a 2-roll calender to get the rubber<br>
sheets of uniform thickness; cutting said sheets by automatic<br>
pneumatic cutter to obtain the desired size and length; treating<br>
3 plates of mild steel with 10% HC1 at room temperature for<br>
10 minutes and drying the same;<br>
shot blasting the said metal sheets by using steel shots;<br>

adhesive, i.e one coat of primer bonding adhesive and two coats<br>
of cover bonding adhesive; fixing the rubber compound between<br>
the metal layers, i.e between first and second metal plates<br>
and second and third metal plates; curing the metal bonded rubber<br>
