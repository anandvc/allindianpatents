				<td>DEVICE FOR THE REMOVAL OF SLIPS FROM A CONTINUOUSLY<br>
TRANSPORTED SLIP WEB<br>
The invention pertains to a device for the removal of slips<br>
[of paper] from a continuously transported slip web, having an<br>
advancement roll pair which continuously advances and holds the<br>
slip web/ having a blade cylinder whose blade, which follows a<br>
path along a surface line, pushes the respective lead end of a<br>
slip into an open gripper of a gripper cylinder, having a device<br>
arranged between the advancement roll pair and blade cylinder,<br>
for providing transverse perforations in the slip web and having<br>
a rotating tear-off segment which cooperates with the blade<br>
cylinder.<br>
A device of this type known from practical operation and<br>
described with the aid of Figure 2 cannot be reset to different<br>
this, the distance from the device which carries out the<br>
transverse perforation to the cooperating rotating tear-off<br>
segments, or, to f.he grippper of the gripper cylinder<br>
respectively, must be changed. Changing this distance is costly,<br>
since the drives of the advancement rolls and of the transverse<br>
perforating device must also be adjusted to the changed format.<br>
That is why the purpose of the invention is to create a<br>
device of the aforementioned type which can be adapted to<br>
different slip formats simply and rapidly, and with limited<br>
structural cost. <br>
This problem is solved in accordance with the invention for<br>
a device of the aforementioned type by means of the fact that the<br>
blade cylinder is provided with two sleeve sections of larger and<br>
smaller radius, the tear-off segment cooperates with the sleeve<br>
section having a greater radius and rotates at the same<br>
peripheral speed as the latter and the diameter of the enveloping<br>
cylinder described by the tear-off segment is equal to the radius<br>
of the sleeve section having a greater radius, the angle at<br>
circumference of the sleeve section having a smaller radius is<br>
large enough that the tear-off segment, when passing by the blade<br>
cylinder, alternately cooperates with the sleeve section having a<br>
greater radius and encounters the sleeve section having a smaller<br>
radius, the angle of action of the tear-off segment relative to<br>
the blade cylinder can be adjusted, the speed of the advancement<br>
rolls can be adjusted between a highest speed, which is less than<br>
the peripheral speed of the blade cylinder and corresponds<br>
approximately to the speed required by the web start in order,<br>
during one rotation of the blade cylinder, to overcome the<br>
distance of the path between the perforating device up to the<br>
blade cooperating with the gripper, and a minimum speed, which<br>
corresponds approximately to the speed which the web start<br>
requires in order, during one rotation of the cutter cylinder, to<br>
overcome the distance of the path between the perforating device<br>
up to the contact point of the tear-off segment on the blade<br>
cylinder, a hugger belt is arranged at the section of the<br>
periphery of the blade cylinder between the contact point of the<br>
blade with the gripper and the contact point of the tear-off<br>
segment with the blade, and holds the slip web against the blade<br>
cylinder with a sliding contact prior to the separation of a slip<br>
from it, and does not entrain the slip without slippage until<br>
aftez separation, the transverse perforating device can be<br>
adjusted to the web slips in such a way that it provides<br>
transverse perforations on the latter at intervals of the desired<br>
length of the slip, and the angle of action of the tear-off<br>
segment is adjusted such that a tearing off of the slip is<br>
carried out when the blade is located precisely in the region of<br>
the front end of the web slips.<br>
The device in accordance with the invention can be adjusted<br>
to different lengths of slips simply and rapidly by means of the<br>
fact that the advancement speed of the advancement rolls, the<br>
transverse perforating device and the angle of action of the<br>
tear-off segment can be correspondingly changed relative to the<br>
blade cylinder. A device in accordance with the invention can be<br>
used in order to tear slips from the slip web along transverse<br>
perforation lines, the greatest length of which slips corresponds<br>
approximately to the distance of the contact point of the blade<br>
of the blade cylinder in the opened grippers from the transverse<br>
perforating device. The shortest cut length of a slip is less<br>
than the length from of the contact point of the tear-off segment<br>
at the blade cylinder up to the transverse perforating device.<br>
After each slip is torn off, the front end of the slip web<br>
arrives in the gap between the carrier of the tear-off segment or<br>
hugger belt respectively, and the blade cylinder. The front<br>
region of the slip web is then held contact with the sleeve of<br>
the blade cylinder by means of the bugger belt in with both the<br>
sleeve of the blade cylinder as well as the hugger belt gliding<br>
over the slip web with slippage, since the latter is advanced at<br>
only a limited speed. The perforating device provides the slip<br>
web with transverse perforations at desired intervals, with the<br>
tearing-off of a slip always being carried out when the<br>
transverse perforations are located between the contact point of<br>
the tear-off segment at the blade cylinder and the transverse<br>
perforating device. A tearing-off in this place is possible,<br>
since the tear-off segment and blade cylinder rotate at a greater<br>
peripheral speed than corresponds with the advancement speed of<br>
the web. In this connection, the adjustment is selected such<br>
that, in each case/ at the time at which a tearing-off occurs,<br>
the blade of the blade cylinder is located under the front end<br>
region of the web, such that a slip is entrained without slippage<br>
by the blade cylinder after being torn off, and the hugger belt<br>
and the blade introduces the front end of the slip, in correct<br>
position, into the open gripper.<br>
Also, instead of a transverse perforating device, a device<br>
in accordance with the invention can be provided with a cutter<br>
which executes a transverse cut. Hence, a tear-off segment can be<br>
omitted with this configuration in accordance with the invention.<br>
For this device in accordance with the invention, the time at<br>
which a removed slip is entrained can be determined solely by<br>
means of the execution of the transverse cut. Therefore, the<br>
transverse cut is to be carried out at. the point when the blade<br>
of the blade cylinder is located in the front region of the slip<br>
web, such that a slip which has been removed is thereupon<br>
entrained by the blade cylinder without slippage and the front<br>
region of the slip can be introduced in the correct position into<br>
the gripper.<br>
An embodiment of the invention is explained in greater<br>
detail in the following, with the aid of the drawings. "-These show<br>
Figure 1: a schematic plan view of an adhesive-application device<br>
which during sack production cooperates with a device for tearing<br>
off base cover sheets from a slip web and depositing the same on<br>
the bottoms of sacks which have been pulled open and<br>
Figure 2: a schematic plan view of a known device which, during<br>
sack production, removes bottom cover sheets from a slip web- in<br>
order to put adhesive onto and deposit the same onto the bottoms<br>
of sacks which have been pulled open.<br>
For the known device, shown schematically in Figure 2,<br>
advancement rolls (37), which advance a slip web (38) drawn from<br>
a supply reel, not shown, and hold it between themselves without<br>
slippage, are supported in a roll stand (36) which, in lateral<br>
guides (34,35), can be adjusted in the direction of double arrow<br>
C. This slip web is provided with transverse perforations by<br>
means of cooperating cutters (39). Advancement rolls (40) turn<br>
over the lead end of the slip web (38) to a gripper cylinder<br>
(41), into whose gripper (42) a blade (44) arranged on the blade<br>
cylinder (43) pushes the front end respectively, of each slip for<br>
the purpose of a secure seizing of the same. The gripper cylinder<br>
(41) and the blade cylinder (43) are provided with cooperating<br>
tear-off segments (45,46), in which, in each case, slips taken<br>
over by the gripper cylinder (41) are torn off along the<br>
transverse perforation line provided by the cutters (39) .<br>
The gripper cylinder (41) cooperates with an<br>
adhesive-application roll (46) which provides a slip that has<br>
been torn off from the slip web (38) and the front end of which<br>
has been taken over by the gripper (42), with an adhesive deposit<br>
in accordance with a format. The gripper cylinder (21) thereupon<br>
presses the slip, e.g., a base cover sheet, to which adhesive has<br>
been deposited in accordance with the format, against workpieces,<br>
e.g., open sack bottoms, transported continuously in the<br>
direction of the arrow, which workpieces are then released by the<br>
gripper (42).<br>
In order to change the format of a slip which has been<br>
removed from the slip web (38) it is necessary, for the known<br>
device evident from Figure 2, to move the roll stand (3 6) in the<br>
direction of double arrow C, which, however, is extraordinarily<br>
laborious because the drive is adapted after each move.<br>
In contrast, the device (30) for the removal of slips from a<br>
slip web and for the transfer of the slips to these workpieces to<br>
be completed, in accordance with the invention as seen from<br>
Figure 1, can be changed to different formats much more simply<br>
and rapidly.<br>
For the device in accordance with the invention, evident<br>
from Figure 1, the slip web (31) is pulled up by means of the<br>
advancement and holding rolls (50) . It is thereupon provided with<br>
Once the slip web (31) has been provided with transverse<br>
perforated lines, the lead end of the slip web arrives, by means<br>
of cooperating guiding sheets (53), into the gap between the<br>
blade cylinder (54) and the tear-off cylinder (56) provided with<br>
a tear-off segment (55). Between the contact point of the blade<br><br>
gripper cylinder (62) and the tear-off cylinder (56)., the front<br>
region of the slip web (31) is pressed against the sleeve of the<br>
blade cylinder (54) by means of a hugger belt (65), which runs<br>
over regions of the tear-off cylinder and guide rolls.--The hugger<br>
belt (65) can be composed of several continuous driving belts,<br>
revolving parallel to each other, and revolves at a speed which<br>
corresponds to the peripheral speed of the blade cylinder (54).<br>
The hugger belt (65) presses the front region of the slip web so<br>
strongly against the sleeve of the blade cylinder (54), that both<br>
the hugger belt as well as the sleeve of the blade cylinder (54)<br>
slide over the slip web, with slippage, so long as the latter is<br>
held by the advancement roll pair (50) which advances the slip<br>
web (31) at only a limited speed. Not until a tearing off occurs<br>
is a slip, which has been torn off, entrained without, slippage.<br>
The blade cylinder (54) is provided with two sleeve<br>
sections, namely, a sleeve section (57) having a greater radius<br>
and a sleeve section (58) having a smaller radius, with the<br>
clamping force required for a tearing off being summoned up by<br>
the tear-off segment (55), only if the latter cooperates with the<br>
sleeve section (57), whereas the sleeve section (58) runs under<br>
the tear-off segment (55) without causing a clamping to occur. In<br>
order to guarantee that the tearing off of a slip is always<br>
carried out at the same angular position of the blade cylinder<br>
(54) for every format adjustment, the greater radius of the<br>
sleeve section (57) is equal to the diameter of the enveloping<br>
circle of the tear-off segment (55).<br>
After a format change, in order to be able to undertake a<br>
tearing off of the slip in correct phase, the angle of the<br>
tear-off segment (55) can be adjusted relative to the tear-off<br>
cylinder (56) , such that an angular tearing-off location on the<br>
blade cylinder (54) can be adjusted for. The ability of the<br>
tear-off segment (55) to be adjusted relative to the tear-off<br>
cylinder (56) is indicated by means of the elongated hole (68)<br>
having a semicircular shape.<br>
In order to be able to tear off a slip from the slip web<br>
(31) along the transverse perforated lines, the tear-off cylinder<br>
(56), along with the tear-off segment (55) and blade cylinder<br>
(54), revolves at a greater peripheral speed than the clamping<br>
and advancement rolls (50). A tearing off along a transverse<br>
perforated line is always carried out when a perforated section<br>
is located between the roll pair (55) [sic; 51,52] and the<br>
tear-off segment (55) located in the clamping position and the<br>
blade (60) is located in the region of the front end of the slip<br>
web (31). During tearing-off process, the perforating, cutters<br>
(51/52), of course, must not act upon the slip web (31),<br>
The respective leading end of a slip which has been torn off<br>
is pushed, by the blade (60) of the blade cylinder (54), into the<br>
open gripper (61) of the gripper cylinder (62). On the gripper<br>
cylinder (62), the slip is thereupon provided with an adhesive<br>
deposit by the adhesive-application roll (10) in accordance with<br>
the format, and thereupon pressed onto a workpiece, e.g., the<br>
bottom of a sack which has been drawn up, which is continuously<br>
transported in the direction of arrow B.<br>
The adhesive-application roll (10) is part of an<br>
adhesive-application device (29) which has been described in<br>
Patent Application No. 19,532,582.6, to which reference is made<br>
for a more detailed representation. In order to bring about a<br>
format change of slips to be torn off, it is merely required, for<br>
the device in accordance with the invention, to allow the<br>
advancement roll pair (50) to revolve at a faster or slower<br>
speed, such that different sized advance lengths of the slip web<br>
(31) can be pushed between the hugger belt (65) and the sleeve of<br>
the blade cylinder (54) up to the point of a tearing off.<br>
Naturally, the intervals of the transverse perforated lines and<br>
the angle of action of the tear-off segment (55) must be<br>
correspondingly adjusted, which can be carried out under computer<br>
control.<br>
