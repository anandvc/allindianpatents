NEW COMPOUND AND ORGANIC LIGHT EMITTING DEVICE<br>
USING THE SAME (6)<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1] The present invention relates to an organic light emitting device which comprises a<br>
fluorene derivative capable of significantly improving a lifespan, efficiency, and electrochemical<br>
and thermal stabilities thereof.<br>
[2]<br>
Background Art<br>
[3] An organic light emission phenomenon is an example of a conversion of current<br>
into visible rays through an internal process of a specific organic molecule. The<br>
organic light emission phenomenon is based on the following mechanism. When<br>
organic material layers are interposed between an anode ar.d a cathode, if voltage is<br>
applied between the two electrodes, electrons and holes are injected from the cathode<br>
and the anode into the organic material layer. The electrons and the holes which are<br>
injected into the organic material layer are recombined to from an exciton, and the<br>
exciton is reduced to a bottom state to emit light. An organic light emitting device<br>
which is based on the above mechanism typically comprises a cathode, an anode, and<br>
organic material layer(s). for example, organic material lasers including a hole<br>
injection layer, a hole transport layer, a light emitting layer, and an electron transport<br>
layer, interposed therebetween.<br>
14] The materials used in the organic light emitting device are mostly pure organic<br>
materials or complexes of organic material and metal. The material used in the organic<br>
light emitting device may be classified as a hole injection material, a hole transport<br>
material, a light emitting material, an electron transport material, or an electron<br>
injection material, according to its use. In connection with this, an organic material<br>
having a p-type property, which is easily oxidized and is e'ectrochemically stable when<br>
it is oxidized, is mostly used as the hole injection material or the hole transport<br>
material. Meanwhile, an organic material having an n-type property, which is easily<br>
reduced and is electrochemically stable when it is reduce- is used as the electron<br>
injection material or the electron transport material. As the light emitting layer<br>
material, an organic material having both p-type and n-type properties is preferable,<br>
which is stable when it is oxidized and when it is reducec. Also a material having high<br>
light emission efficiency for conversion of the exciton into light when the exciton is<br>
formed is preferable.<br>
[5] In addition, it is preferable that the material used in the organic light emitting device<br>
further have the following properties.<br>
[6] First, it is preferable that the material used in the organic light emitting device have<br>
excellent thermal stability. The reason is that joule heat is generated by movement of<br>
electric charges in the organic light emitting device. NPB, which has recently been<br>
used as the hole transport layer material, has a glass transition temperature of 100Â°C or<br>
lower, thus it is difficult to apply to an organic light emitting device requiring a high<br>
current.<br>
[7] Second, in order to produce an organic light emitting device that is capable of being<br>
actuated at low voltage and has high efficiency, holes and electrons which are injected<br>
into the organic light emitting device must be smoothly transported to a light emitting<br>
layer, and must not be released out of the light emitting layer. To achieve this, a<br>
material used in the organic light emitting device must have a proper band gap and a<br>
proper HOMO and LUMO energy levels. A LUMO energy level of PEDOT:PSS,<br>
which is currently used as a hole transport material of an organic light emitting device<br>
produced using a solution coating method, is lower than that of an organic material<br>
used as a light emitting layer material, thus it is difficult to produce an organic light<br>
emitting device having high efficiency and a long lifespan.<br>
[8] Moreover, the material used in the organic light emitting device must have excellent<br>
chemical stability, electric charge mobility, and interfacial characteristic with an<br>
electrode or an adjacent layer. That is to say, the material used in the organic light<br>
emitting device must be little deformed by moisture or oxygen. Furthermore, proper<br>
hole or electron mobility must be assured so as to balance densities of the holes and of<br>
the electrons in the light emitting layer of the organic light emitting device to<br>
maximize the formation of excitons. Additionally, it has to be able to have a good<br>
interface with an electrode including metal or metal oxides so as to assure stability of<br>
the device.<br>
19] Accordingly, there is a need to develop an organic light emitting device including<br>
an organic material having the above-mentioned requirements in the art.<br>
[10]<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[11] Therefore, the object of the present inventions is to provide an organic light<br>
emitting device which is capable of satisfying conditions required of a material usable<br>
for an organic light emitting device, for example, a proper energy level, electrochemical<br>
stability, and thermal stability, and which includes a fluorene derivative<br>
having a chemical structure capable of playing various roles required in the organic<br>
light emitting device, depending on a substituent group.<br>
[12]<br>
[13]<br>
[14]<br>
[15]<br>
Technical Solution<br>
The present invention provides an organic light emitting device which comprises a<br>
first electrode, organic material layer(s) comprising a light emitting layer, and a second<br>
electrode, wherein the first electrode, the organic material layer(s), and the second<br>
electrode form a layered structure and at least one layer of the organic material layer(s)<br>

as styryl; and an alkynyl group having a triple bond, such as an acetylene group.<br>
[25] The carbon number of the alkyl, alkoxy, and alkenyl groups of Rl to R9 of Formula<br>
1 is not limited, but is preferably 1 - 20.<br>
[26] The length of the alkyl group contained in the compound does not affect the<br>
conjugate length of the compound, but may affect the method of applying the<br>
compound to the organic light emitting device, for example, a vacuum deposition<br>
method or a solution coating method.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, a detailed description will be given of the present invention.<br>
Various substituent groups are introduced into a core structure shown in Formula 1.<br>
in detail, the core structure in which a fluorene group is bonded to a combination of an<br>
acridine group and a carbazolyl group to form a spiro structure, thereby the compound<br>
of Formula 1 has characteristics suitable for application to an organic material layer<br>
used in an organic light emitting device. This will be described in detail, below.<br>
The steric core structure of the compound of Formula 1 can be divided into t\vo<br>
portions, A and B, for explanation, as shown in the following figure.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
 [76] The compound of Formula 1 has the steric core structure in which a plane A meets<br>
with a plane B at right angles around X, and conjugation does not occur between the A<br>
and B portions around X. Furthermore, since one nitrogen atom is positioned among<br>
three aryl groups in the plane B, conjugation is limited in the plane B.<br>
[77] The conjugation length of the compound has a close relationship with an energy<br>
band gap. In detail, the energy band gap is reduced as the conjugation length of the<br>
compound increases. As described above, since a conjugation structure is limited in the<br>
core structure of the compound of Formula 1, the core structure has a large energy<br>
band gap.<br>
â¢â¢<br>
[78] As described above, in the present invention, various substituent groups are<br>
introduced to Rl - R9 positions and Zl ~ Z4 positions of the core structure having the<br>
large energy band gap so as to produce compounds having various energy band gaps.<br>
Generally, it is easy to control the energy band gap by introducing substituent groups<br>
into a core structure having a large energy band gap, but it is difficult to significantly<br>
control the energy band gap by introducing substituent groups into a core structure<br>
having a small energy band gap. Furthermore, in the present invention, it is possible to<br>
control HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the compound by introducing various<br>
substituent groups into Rl to R9 and Zl to Z4 of the core structure.<br>
!79] Additionally, by introducing various substituent groups into the core structure.<br>
compounds having intrinsic characteristics of the substituent groups can be obtained.<br>
For example, substituent groups, which are frequently applied to hole injection layer<br>
material, hole transport layer material, light emitting layer material, and electron<br>
transport layer materials during the production of the organic light emitting device, are<br>
introduced into the core structure so as to produce substances capable of satisfying the<br>
requirements of each organic material layer. Particularly, since the core structure of the<br>
compound of Formula 1 includes the arylamine structure, it has an energy level<br>
suitable for the hole injection and/or hole transport materials in the organic light<br>
emitting device. In the present invention, the compound having the proper energy level<br>
is selected depending on the substituent group among the compounds expressed by<br>
Formula 1 to be used in the organic light emitting device, thereby it is possible to<br>
realize a device having a low actuating voltage and a high light efficiency.<br>
[80] Furthermore, various substituent groups are symmetrically introduced into the core<br>
structure (the A and B portions are located at both sides of the core structure) so as to<br>
precisely control the energy band gap. improve interfacial characteristics with organic<br>
materials, and apply the compound to various fields.<br>
[81] In addition, if the numbers of nitrogen contained in the substituent groups A and B<br>
are each set to 1 (if Zl to Z4 are hetero aromatic amine compounds, the number of<br>
nitrogen contained in them is not counted), it is possible to precisely control the<br>
HOMO or LUMO energy levels and the energy band gap, on the other hand, to<br>
improve interfacial characteristics with the organic materials, and apply the compound<br>
to various fields.<br>
[82] Additionally, various substituent groups are introduced into the steric structure of<br>
the compound of Formula 1 using spiro bonding to control the three-dimensional<br>
structure of the organic material so as to minimize -t-;t interaction in the organic<br>
material, thereby formation of excimers is prevented.<br>
[83] Meanwhile, since the compound of Formula 1 has a high glass transition<br>
temperature (Tg), it has excellent thermal stability. For example, the glass transition<br>
temperature of the compound of Formula 2-4 is 148Â°C, which is still higher than that of<br>
conventionally used NPB (Tg: 96Â°C). Such increase in thermal stability is an important<br>
factor providing actuating stability to the device.<br>
[84] Furthermore, the compound of Formula 1 may be used to form the organic material<br>
layer using a vacuum deposition process or a solution coating process during the<br>
production of the organic light emitting device. In connection with this, illustrative, but<br>
non-limiting, examples of the solution coating process include a spin coating process, a<br>
dip coating process, an inkjet printing process, a screen printing process, a spray<br>
process, and a roll coating process.<br>
[85] For example, the compound of Formula 1 has excellent solubility to a polar solvent,<br>
such as xylene, dichloroethane, or NMP. which is used during the production of the<br>
device, and forms a thin film very well through the process using a solution, thus the<br>
solution coating process may be applied to produce the device.<br>
[86] Tertiary alcohol, which is produced by a reaction of a lithiated aryl and keto group,<br>
is heated in the presence of an acid catalyst to form a hexagonal cyclic structure while<br>
water is removed, thereby producing the compound having a spiro structure according<br>
to the present invention. The above-mentioned procedure for producing the compound<br>
is well known in the art. and those skilled in the art can change the production<br>
conditions during the production of the compound of Formula 1. The production will<br>
be described in detail in the preparation examples later.<br>
[87] In the organic light emitting device of the present invention, a compound, in which<br>
a thermosetting or photo-crosslinkable functional group is introduced into the<br>
compound of Formula 1, may be used instead of the compound of Formula 1. The<br>
former compound has the basic physical properties of the compound of Formula 1, and<br>
may be used to form a thin film using a solution coating process and then be cured so<br>
as to form an organic material layer during the production of the device.<br>
[88] The method of forming the organic material layer, which comprises introducing the<br>
curable functional group into the organic material during the Preparation of the organic<br>
light emitting device, forming the organic thin film using the solution coating process,<br>
and curing the resulting film, is disclosed in US Pat. No. 2003-0044518 and EP Pat.<br>
No. 1146574 A2.<br>
[89] The above documents state that, if the organic material layer(s) is formed through<br>
the above-mentioned method using a material having a thermosetting or photocrosslinkable<br>
vinyl or acryl group so as to produce an organic light emitting device, it<br>
is possible to produce an organic light emitting device having a low voltage and high<br>
brightness as well as an organic light emitting device having a multilayered structure<br>
using the solution coating process. This operation mechanism may be applied to the<br>
compound of the present invention.<br>
[90] In the present invention, the thermosetting or photo-crosslinkable functional group<br>
may be a vinyl or an acryl group.<br>
[91 ] The organic light emitting device of the present invention can be produced using<br>
known materials through a known process, modified only in that at least one layer of<br>
organic material layer(s) include the compound of the present invention, the compound<br>
of Formula 1.<br>
[92] The organic material layer(s) of the organic light emitting device according to the<br>
present invention may have a single layer structure, or alternatively, a multilayered<br>
structure in which two or more organic material layers are layered. For example, the<br>
organic light emitting device of the present invention may comprise a hole injection<br>
layer, a hole transport layer, a light emitting layer, an electron transport layer, and an<br>
electron injection layer as the organic material layer(s). However, the structure of the<br>
organic light emitting device is not limited to this, but may comprise a smaller number<br>
of organic material layers.<br>
193] Furthermore, the organic light emitting device of the present invention may be<br>
