				<td>when injection moulding, with such a slimming down quite obviously forming an obstruction<br>
to the flow of the molten material. The thicknesses of this area vary from 0.1 to 1.0 mm<br>
whilst the thickness of the cover wall is of the order of some 10 mm.<br>
[0009] This cover must also have a certain rigidity to allow it to fit on, for example, a<br>
steering wheel.<br>
[0010] This cover must moreover be regarded as a so-called appearance part. Paint is<br>
generally applied to the cover with the aim of masking aesthetic defects that might appear on<br>
the surface of the injected part at the visible skin level. These defects may be the result of<br>
change in lustre or reveal the presence of run lines. These visual defects arise from<br>
injection, particularly at the rupture lines and this is in spite of the optimisation of material<br>
flows and injection points. However, this same thermoplastic composition can also be used<br>
for applications that will not be painted and it will then be far more difficult to achieve a good<br>
external appearance without the presence of this coat of paint.<br>
[0011] Moreover, despite temperature changes in the vehicle's passenger compartment,<br>
this lower strength zone must be able to be retain a long term decorative appearance; the<br>
surfaces must remain soft and supple and it must be able to retain sufficient mechanical<br>
properties that do not alter, particularly losing its shape and stretching or even cracking.<br>
[0012] Finally the performance conditions of the cover during use and the operation of a<br>
motor vehicle safety airbag are particularly critical. Each cover design, as designed by<br>
equipment manufacturers and car builders, is different; however, under the most extreme<br>
practical conditions the thermoplastic material comprising this injected part should resist an<br>
actual temperature of -35° C whilst also being able to withstand with changes a temperature<br>
of +85° C. Consequently, this implies that the covers for testing will actually be placed in<br>
these temperature conditions and they will be tested at these actual temperatures. Thus the<br>
covers are placed in a conditioning chamber at the above-mentioned temperatures; when<br>
the cover has actually reached these temperatures, it is then tested under real conditions to<br>
verify its correct operation. This correct operation implies that no piece of plastic must break<br>
off during the release of the airbag (explosion), since it is feared that a detached plastic<br>
piece could potentially injure the vehicle occupant. The cover must therefore tear and open<br>
in the sector foreseen to this end, often following this H or I shape, with the opening of the<br>
flaps taking place in a pre-determined manner in order to allow the safety airbag to be<br><br>
properly deployed. It is a matter of ensuring that the bag is fully deployed in a precise time<br>
interval: if the bag is deployed too quickly, the occupant could hit the bag before it is actually<br>
inflated; however, if the bag is deployed too slowly, then there is a risk of the driver hitting<br>
the steering column.<br>
[0013] If the vehicle strikes an obstacle with an impact force sufficient to make sure that<br>
the airbag deployment mechanism is triggered, the insert acting as a cover must be capable<br>
of being opened in a few milliseconds, and to do so by rupturing following the notches<br>
designed to this end and which form integral parts of the moulded part. During this<br>
deployment the cover plays an important role by retaining the airbag mechanism whilst<br>
remaining attached to the steering wheel with respect to the part left behind if it is a cover<br>
concealing the driver's safety airbag, or by ensuring the door's integrity is maintained if it<br>
constitutes the plate concealing the safety airbag on the vehicle sides.<br>
[0014] These use requirements are expressed as the functional need for good impact<br>
strength at low temperature for such compositions and particularly the need for a ductile<br>
rupture. It should also be borne in mind that increasingly demanding safety stipulations<br>
mean that this performance is required at lower and lower temperatures.<br>
[0015] In addition, over the long term, the skin may lose its suppleness and become<br>
fragile, particularly around the rupture line, due to the repeated effect of the thermal<br>
variations to which the vehicle's passenger compartment is subjected.<br>
[0016] Thermal performance tests are generally conducted for 400 hours at 107° C.<br>
Accelerated tests simulating 10 years of ageing and thus of life cycle are likewise well known<br>
for such motor vehicle passenger compartment components. Finally, other tests include<br>
chemical resistance, ultra-violet radiation resistance, response to risks of changes in colour,<br>
as well as to the risks of the formation of condensation forming on the windscreen, this<br>
condensation resulting from the deposition of volatile organic materials contained in the<br>
composition comprising the passenger compartment parts subjected to a temperature<br>
increase.<br>
[0017] Compositions allowing the production of covers for housing a motor vehicle safety<br>
airbag, particularly by injection, are already known.<br><br>
[0018] The majority of compositions are of the thermoplastic elastomer type with a<br>
chemically cross-linked rubber phase, generated by dynamic vulcanisation. Co-polyester<br>
type elastomers are also possible.<br>
[0019] Nevertheless, costs considerations mean that compositions that are mostly<br>
polyolefins are preferred.<br>
[0020] Document US 6,087,431 discloses a thermoplastic elastomer olefin composition<br>
obtained from a mixture comprised of (1) 100 parts by weight of an olefin elastomer<br>
comprising ethylene and at least one or-olefin with 6 to 12 carbon atoms, and having an a -<br>
olefin copolymerisation ratio of 20 to 30% by weight, a density of 0.8 to 0.9 g/cm3 and a<br>
molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of less than 3.0 when determined by gel phase<br>
chromatography techniques, (2) 5 to 90 parts by weight of a propylene polymer, and (3) 5 to<br>
250 parts by weight of an oil for rubber, with the mixture being cross-linked by a radical<br>
initiator or by both a radical initiator and a cross-linking promoter.<br>
[0021] However, such a composition no longer meets the new requirements for the<br>
absence of volatile organic components having the capability of exuding on the surface of<br>
the item moulded from this composition when kept for a long time at high temperatures, as<br>
happens with a car left in full sunlight, with the aforesaid compositions being deposited by<br>
sublimation on the windscreen, changing its transparency.<br>
[0022] Document WO0224803 discloses a thermoplastic elastomer composition with<br>
modified rheology obtained from a mixture comprised of at least a first polyolefin with the<br>
elastomeric properties of the ethylene and a -olefin copolymer type and a second polyolefin<br>
of the polypropylene homopolymer or ethylene propylene copolymer type associated with a<br>
peroxide type cross-linking agent and a free radicals former type coagent; with the<br>
composition being subjected to hot mixing in order to improve the composition's visco-elastic<br>
properties, particularly its rheology. The main cross-linking or vulcanising system is actually<br>
supplemented by a secondary system acting as a chain cutter as regards the polypropylene<br>
component and this is in order to allow satisfactory implementation behaviour for such a<br>
composition to be achieved, particularly in processes such as sheet extrusion and heat<br>
moulding. Other additives are possible in such compositions, particularly mineral fillers,<br>
stabilisers, plasticisers, bulking or other agents according to the types of compositions to be<br>
obtained and standards to be met. This composition has the advantage of being able to be<br><br>
used easily, including by injection and including when the walls of the object for moulding are<br>
particularly thin whilst allowing the item to have a good surface appearance. However, such<br>
a composition is not suited to quite specific use performance situations, since it does not<br>
allow production of parts able to withstand the most critical notch impact resistance tests at -<br>
45° C.<br>
[0023] US 2002/0151653 describes a thermoplastic resin composition for use as a skin<br>
material for automobile interior parts comprising a base composition of polypropylene, an<br>
olefin based copolymer rubber, a processing oil and a high density polyethylene resin, in<br>
combination with an organic peroxide cross-linking agent to prevent hyper-degradation of the<br>
polypropylene resin and as a free radical stabilizer, and polytetraflourorethylene resin.<br>
[0024] US2002/0037954 describes a polypropylene resin composition comprising:<br>
(i) a polypropylene based composition comprising polypropylene, talc and<br>
optionally an ethylene-or-olefin copolymer rubber and/or an aromatic rubber<br>
vinyl containing rubber; and<br>
(ii) a pigment masterbatch.<br>
This composition does not contain any form of cross-linking agent.<br>
[0025] EP0774489 describes a thermoplastic resin composition comprising<br>
(A) a polypropylene/ethylene block copolymer<br>
(B1) a mixture of ethylene/butane random copolymer resins<br>
(B2) an ethylene/octane random copolymer and an ethylene/propylene copolymer<br>
(C)	a polyethylene moiety-(ethylene/butane random elastomer moiety-<br>
polyethylene moiety or a polyethylene moiety-(-ethylene/butane random<br>
elastomer moiety)' and<br>
(D)	talc,<br>
Each of (A), (B1), (B2), (C) and (D) have specific parameter requirements.<br>
[0026] US 5596042 describes an olefin thermoplastic elastomer. WO 97/22665 relates to<br>
a powdered thermoplastic polyolefin composition with resilient properties. EP 0872517<br><br>
relates to a thermoplastic elastomer composition. WO98/54260 describes a low modulus<br>
thermoplastic olefin composition.<br>
[0027] The invention consequently has the aim of compensating for the drawbacks<br>
mentioned above by offering a composition allowing an excellent surface appearance and a<br>
significant improvement in notched impact resistance performance when cold, i.e. having<br>
ductile rupture, but a rupture nevertheless without losing anything for all that in terms of<br>
rigidity modulus and high temperature resistance, to be obtained from the aforesaid<br>
composition and for an injection-moulded part.<br>
[0028] The invention has as its first object the creation of a polyolefin composition intended<br>
to be transformed by any plastics processing technique, but preferably by injection moulding,<br>
into an insert or cover type part for housing a motor vehicle safety airbag, that must<br>
withstand an impact at low temperature without necessarily splitting, i.e. having a ductile<br>
type rupture and maintaining its shape at high temperature.<br>
[0029] The invention has as another object the creation of a partly cross-linked<br>
thermoplastic elastomer polyolefin composition intended for producing a cover fully meeting<br>
the specification of motor vehicle manufacturers, in particular having to withstand<br>
temperatures of 107° C and having a high rigidity modulus without sacrificing the<br>
characteristics of rupture ductility to notched impact at low temperature.<br>
[0030] The invention has as another object the creation of a partly cross-linked<br>
thermoplastic elastomer polyolefin composition intended for producing a cover that has<br>
attractive appearance properties in order to allow its possible use without painting and more<br>
particularly offering a sufficiently broad range of use by injection to obtain moulded parts free<br>
of material run lines, regular surface states, homogenous shrinkage not shown by<br>
temperature cycles, particularly during painting, and to do so in spite of high moulding rates.<br>
[0031] The invention has, as another object the creation of a partly cross-linked<br>
thermoplastic elastomer polyolefin composition for making an insert, in particular a cover<br>
which can be made at high moulding rates, that is to say having short cycle times resulting<br>
from short injection and release times without being effected by any risk of stickiness to the<br>
mould.<br><br>
[0032] To this end the invention concerns a partly cross-linked thermoplastic elastomer<br>
polyotefin composition intended to be utilised initially by any blending technique in its molten<br>
state and under shearing force before being transformed by plastics processing moulding<br>
techniques, and preferably by injection moulding into an insert in particular a cover type part<br>
for housing a motor vehicle safety airbag, with the said composition comprising an olefin<br>
polymer of polypropylene type, at least one copolymer of ethylene- o-olefin type, at least one<br>
cross-linking agent and a free radical initiator characterised in that<br>
a)	the at least one olefin polymer of polypropylene type is chosen from the<br>
polypropylene/ethylene or polypropylene/ o-olefin copolymers group<br>
and selected from those having an impact resistance of at least 30<br>
kJ/m2 when measured using the notched Izod impact resistance Test<br>
at 23° C, in accordance with ISO standard 180;<br>
b)	the at least one ethylene type copolymer of the ethylene-a-olefin type is<br>
selected from the group of those having a maximum density of 0.870<br>
g/cm3, in accordance with ISO standard 1183;<br>
c)	at least one thermoplastic elastomer is introduced<br>
d)	optionally a polymer of the high density polyethylene type is added<br>
[0033] Since a high rigidity modulus for the composition comprising the cover must be<br>
sought and a resistance to high temperatures is necessary, different types of high melting<br>
point thermoplastic olefin polymers can be used, such as polypropylenes in their<br>
homopolymer or copolymer form; however, insofar as the inclusion of impact resistance<br>
performance when cold, the choice is preferably oriented to polypropylene copolymers, and<br>
preferably to olefinic polymers of the high density polyethylene type which are conceivable<br>
although they have lower melting points than polypropylene<br>
[0034] Nevertheless, the addition of thermoplastic elastomers proves to be essential in<br>
order to meet the requirements of low hardness and ductile rupture at low temperature.<br>
[0035] The state of the art indicates that, of the polyolefins, those having a low crystallinity<br>
should be chosen out of preference. In fact, visco-elastic behaviour and suppleness of the<br>
polymer material go hand in hand since these two properties are linked to the crystalline,<br>
semi-crystalline or amorphous state of the aforesaid polymer material.<br><br>
[0036] The state of the art likewise indicates that partial cross-linking accompanies the<br>
formation of a network between the crystalline parts and the amorphous parts, likewise<br>
changing the lengths of chains and thus creating the morphological conditions to obtain a<br>
real thermoplastic elastomer. However, ductile rupture performance, including at very low<br>
temperatures, is not achieved by this single approach.<br>
[0037] Finally, changing the Theological characteristics of such compositions is called for in<br>
order to combine fluidity and low viscosity behaviour at high shearing rates whilst<br>
maintaining cohesion of the material in the molten state. Such characteristics are desired<br>
with the aim of retaining appearance properties; these are dependent upon sensitivities to<br>
polymer chain orientations that are too strong when subjected to high injection shearing<br>
rates, then to the possible release of stresses set during thermal cycles, for example.<br>
POLYPROPYLENE POLYMER<br>
[0038] According to the invention, propylene polymers form the main element by quantity<br>
of the partly cross-linked thermoplastic elastomer olefin composition.<br>
[0039] In Accordance with the present invention the polypropylene polymer is a semi-<br>
crystalline isotactic copolymer of the sequential block type or random type whose sequences<br>
are constituted by propylene and by ethylene or a-olefins from C4 - C12 such as 1-butene, 1-<br>
pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene and methyl pentene.<br>
[0040] The semi-crystalline copolymer is preferably a copolymer of propylene and ethylene<br>
containing small quantities of ethylene, generally between 2% and 5% by weight.<br>
[0041] The polypropylene / ethylene or polypropylene / ^-olefin copolymer is selected from<br>
those having an impact resistance of at least 30 kJ/m2 when measured using the notched<br>
Izod impact resistance test at 23° C in accordance with ISO standard 180.<br>
[0042] A homopolypropylene polymer cannot be envisaged due to such a material's low<br>
impact resistance at low temperature.<br>
[0043] The fluidity index of propylene-ethylene copolymer and/or propylene-a-olefin<br>
copolymer in accordance with the present invention is in the range of from 0.1 to 100 g/10<br><br>
minutes (under a load of 2.16 kilograms at 230° C in accordance with ASTM standard 1238).<br>
The chosen copolymer of the propylene type preferably has a fluidity index of between 0.5<br>
and 50 g/10 minutes. Above 50 g/10 minutes, the thermal resistance and mechanical<br>
resistance of the thermoplastic elastomer composition will be insufficient, whilst below 6.5<br>
g/10 minutes, the fluidity and use capability will be too far reduced.<br>
[0044] At least one copolymer chosen from these propylene based copolymers is added in<br>
the proportion of 45% to 80% by weight, and preferably 50% to 70% by weight in<br>
comparison with the total formulated composition. In the description below, all percentages<br>
for various additives, such as cross-linking agents, coagents, stabilising agents, fillers, and<br>
any other additives are given in % by weight compared with the complete composition.<br>
Below 45% by weight, the composition's fluidity and capability of use, as well as its rigidity,<br>
will be diminished too sharply, whilst above 80% by weight, the composition's flexibility will<br>
be manifestly insufficient, particularly at low temperatures.<br>
ETHYLENE BASED A-OLEFIN COPOLYMER<br>
[0045] The ethylene-a-olefin copolymer in accordance with the invention appears to be the<br>
second largest component in quantity terms of the partly cross-linked thermoplastic<br>
elastomer composition is a copolymer comprising ethylene as the major co-monomer and at<br>
least one a-olefin preferably having 3 to 12 carbon atoms as a secondary co-monomer, a-<br>
olefins having 3 to 12 carbon atoms include, for example, butene, 1-hexene, 1-<br>
methylpentene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1-nonene, 1-decene, 1-undecene and 1-dodecene.<br>
[0046] Examples of comonomers that reduce crystallinity which can be used in the<br>
preparation of an ethylene based copolymer in accordance with the present invention also<br>
include ethylene-a-olefin comonomers, or an ethylene comonomer the latter being made by<br>
mixing with the ethylene-a-olefin copolymer. The comonomer is chosen from the group<br>
comprising vinyl acetate, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate,<br>
ethyl acrylate and ethyl methacrylate; however, a-olefins give rise to individual behaviours.<br>
[0047] According to the invention olefin copolymers of the ethylene-butene and the<br>
ethylene-octene type are preferably chosen. These are preferably produced by a well-<br>
known catalyst of the metallocene type in accordance with so-called "constrained geometry"<br>
technology and have the form of substantially linear polymers. These polymers are also<br>
called very low-density linear polyethylenes. These or-olefin copolymers are obtained by<br><br>
polymerisation of ethylene with butene or octene in the presence of a catalyst belonging to<br>
the family of those termed as having "constrained geometry" acting on a specific site and<br>
differing chemically in that from those of classic metallocene type catalysts.<br>
[0048] Generally co-monomers may be present at different rates, thereby increasing or<br>
decreasing the crystallinity of the resulting materials and thus their densities and<br>
consequentially, their visco-elastic properties. In fact a sufficiently viscoelastic character is<br>
necessary to obtain the ductile rupture performance at very low temperatures. Ethylene-a-<br>
olefin copolymers for use in this invention preferably have a fluidity index in the range from<br>
0.05 to 50 g/10 minutes, under a load of 2.16 kilograms at 190° C, when measured in<br>
accordance with method ASTM D-1238, and more preferably from 0.2 to 20 g/10 minutes.<br>
[0049] The ethylene-a-olefinic copolymer for use in this invention has a sufficiently low<br>
density corresponding to a very low crystallinity. Density is chosen at a maximum value of<br>
0.870 g/cm3 when measured in accordance with method ASTM D-792. There is a<br>
correlation between density, crystallinity and the glass transition temperature value. The<br>
ethylene-o-olefin copolymers having the lowest glass transition temperatures will be those<br>
having the lowest crystallinity and thus the lowest density, and do so whatever the o-olefin<br>
comonomer selected, which preferably comprise butene or octene. Such olefinic elastomers<br>
have glass transition temperatures lower than -55° C, for total rates of crystallinity<br>
expressed as a percentage of more than 15% when measured by differential thermal<br>
analysis.<br>
[0050] It should be noted that<br>
- the selected ethylene-butene copolymers resulting from such copolymerisation<br>
processes have the characteristic of having a lower crystallinity than that of ethylene-<br>
octene copolymers of identical density reinforcing this sought-for visco-elasticity<br>
capability peculiar to elastomeric behaviour.<br>
It should be noted that these copolymers have the capacity to be partly cross-linked<br>
in the presence of cross-linking agents and they then enter a plastomeric type state,<br>
thus borrowing from both thermoplastics and elastomers.<br><br>
[0051] The or-olefin copolymer in accordance with the invention is added at the proportion<br>
of 25% to 50% by weight of the composition and preferably 30% to 45% by weight of<br>
ethylene-butene copolymer or ethylene-octene copolymer.<br>
[0052] Above 50% by weight of the composition, the rigidity modulus will be reduced<br>
sharply. Below 25% impact resistance at very low temperatures, measured on the notched<br>
test-piece, is low.<br>
THERMOPLASTIC ELASTOMERS<br>
[0053] According to the invention, and in an utterly surprising manner, the addition of a<br>
specific thermoplastic elastomer in particular proportions to the mixture produced from a<br>
polypropylene copolymer combined with a selected ethylene-o-olefin copolymer most<br>
preferably ethylene-butene or ethylene octene copolymer obtained by polymerisation of<br>
ethylene with butene or octene in the presence of a catalyst belonging to the so-called<br>
"constrained geometry" family, acting on a specific site, allows a composition to be produced<br>
which, when at least partly cross-linked and rheologically modified, particularly as regards its<br>
polypropylene component, by a free radical initiator coagent, by extrusion and shearing at<br>
high temperatures, and once used in a cover by injection techniques, offers excellent<br>
notched impact and very low temperature ductile rupture performance, whilst providing<br>
satisfactory thermal resistance and to do so with all other properties remaining unchanged in<br>
comparison with other thermoplastic elastomer polyolefin compositions. In addition, such a<br>
composition has such use characteristics allowing parts with excellent surface appearance<br>
to be obtained.<br>
[0054] These characteristics of high notch impact resistance and ductile rupture at very low<br>
temperatures are provided by the presence of this specific thermoplastic elastomer,<br>
specifically for use as an impact modifier<br>
[0055] According to the invention, the partly cross-linked thermoplastic olefin elastomer<br>
composition contains at least one specific thermoplastic elastomer chosen in such a manner<br>
that the composition's physical properties are reinforced in respect of resistance to notched<br>
impact at low temperature and capacity to have a ductile rupture without any loss whatever<br>
as regards rigidity modulus.<br><br>
[0056] The impact modification additive is preferably chosen from the group formed by the<br>
ethylene-propylene-diene (EPDM), styrene-butadiene-styrenes (SBS), styrene-ethylene-<br>
butylene-styrenes (SEBS), styrene-butadiene rubbers (SBR), styrene-isoprene-styrenes<br>
(SIS), polyolefin-based thermoplastic elastomers, particularly polypropyfenes<br>
(homopolymers) with amorphous and semi-crystalline blocks and propylene/ethylene or a-<br>
olefin copolymers with amorphous and semi-crystalline blocks of styrene-<br>
(ethylene/propylene) (SEP), styrene-b- (ethylene/propylene)styrene (SEPS), styrene-<br>
(ethylene/butylene)-styrene (SEBS) styrene-(ethylene-ethylene/propylene)-styrene (SEEPS)<br>
type.<br>
[0057] Such specific thermoplastic elastomers include block copolymers comprising a<br>
block A of polymer composed principally of at least one aromatic composition of vinyl type<br>
and a block B of polymer composed principally of at least one conjugated diene composition,<br>
as well as block copolymers obtained by hydrogenation of block copolymers and ethylene<br>
polymers with a low molecular weight.<br>
[0058] The specific elastomers include block copolymers comprising a block A of polymer<br>
composed principally of at least one vinylaromatic type composition and a block B of<br>
polymer composed principally of at least one conjugated diene composition or of block<br>
copolymers obtained by hydrogenation of these block copolymers and ethylenic polymers of<br>
lesser molecular weight.<br>
[0059] The copolymer block comprising at least one vinylaromatic composition contains at<br>
least 50% by weight of the aromatic block of vinyl type and or vinyl homopolymer block.<br>
[0060] The copolymer block composed mainly of at least one conjugated diene<br>
composition contains at least 50% by weight of the conjugated diene composition and/or<br>
homopolymer block of conjugated diene composition.<br>
[0061] The vinylaromatic composition is chosen from the group of styrenes, methyl-<br>
styrenes, 1,3-dimethylstyrenes, p-tert-butyl-styrenes. Styrene is chosen out of preference.<br>
[0062] The conjugated diene composition constituting the copolymer block is chosen from<br>
the group of butadienes, isoprenes, 1,3-pentadienes and 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadienes.<br>
Butadiene and isoprene singly or blended together are chosen out of preference. Such<br><br>
thermoplastic elastomers are traditionally known by the name SBS (styrene butadiene<br>
styrene) or SIS (styrene isoprene styrene).<br>
[0063] The styrene block copolymers may be hydrogenated at intermediate block levefand<br>
then become block copolymers better known under the names SEBS, (styrene ethylene-<br>
butadiene-styrene), SEPS (styrene-ethylene-propylene-styrene) and SEP (styrene-ethylene-<br>
propylene).<br>
[0064] The hydrogenated block copolymers are obtained amongst other ways by<br>
hydrogenation of the aforementioned block copolymers, in particular SBS and SIS.<br>
These polymers may be of linear type, A-B-A. such as for example styrene-butadiene-<br>
styrene, or of radial type, (A-B)n (with n &gt; 2), or of bi-block type A-B.<br>
[0065] According to the invention, styrene-butadiene-styrene are preferably chosen.<br>
[0066] The block copolymers whose structures have been mentioned above are preferably<br>
chosen from those having an average molecular weight of at least 20,000g/mole, and more<br>
preferably between 30,000g/mole and 200,000g/mole.<br>
[0067] When present in the composition in accordance with the invention such a block<br>
copolymer provides excellent mechanical characteristics. In particular impact at very low<br>
temperatures measured on a notched test-piece and ductile rupture are well above values<br>
any thermoplastic elastomer could achieve, without any loss of rigidity and this is in part due<br>
to its capability for partial cross-linking right in the interior of the composition.<br>
[0068] Thus the block copolymer of the composition according to the invention acts as an<br>
integral and interdependent component of the composition. Due to the dynamic cross-<br>
linking reaction achieved during blending in the extruder at high temperature and under<br>
extruder shearing conditions, the block copolymer develops its capacity for interaction in the<br>
network formed by the propylene copolymer, combined with the selected ethylene-a-olefin<br>
copolymer on account of the fact that it becomes a partially dynamically vulcanised<br>
thermoplastic elastomer and that the same occurs for the a-olefin ethylene copolymer<br>
becoming an olefin thermoplastic elastomer that is likewise partly cross-linked.<br><br>
[0069] The block copolymer, impact modification additive, in accordance with the invention,<br>
is added in the proportion of 1% to 15% by weight of the composition.<br>
[0070] Above 15% by weight of the composition, the possibility for cross-linking of the<br>
composition will be reduced, but most of all the rigidity modulus will be sharply lowered.<br>
Below 1%, the gain in impact resistance at very low temperatures measured on the notched<br>
test-piece is not significant.<br>
HIGH DENSITY POLYETHYLENE<br>
[0071] According to the invention a high density polyethylene may be added into the<br>
composition in the proportions of from 0% to 40% by weight of the total composition and<br>
when present preferably comprises between 5% and 30% by weight of the total composition.<br>
Such high density polyethylenes generally have a density equal to or greater than<br>
0.930g/cm3 and for the purpose of this invention are chosen from those having a fluidity<br>
index of between 0.5 and 50g/10 minutes. Such high density polyethylenes are produced<br>
via Ziegler Natta type polymerisation processes.<br>
CROSS-LINKING AGENT<br>
[0072] According to the invention the presence of a partial cross-linking agent allows<br>
structuring of the network formed by the a-olefin copolymers and the specific thermoplastic<br>
elastomer and therefore allows improvement of the composition's properties in terms of<br>
elastomer behaviour, hysteresis of the traction plots / stretching and impact resistance<br>
behaviour at low temperatures, including creep resistance, particularly when subjected to an<br>
increase in temperature under load.<br>
[0073] The cross-linking agent which may be used for the production of the extruded<br>
composition, then intended to be changed into a moulded part, such as, for example, a cover<br>
for housing a motor vehicle safety airbag, is chosen from the group formed by the organic<br>
peroxides such as dicumyl peroxide, 1,1-di-t-butyl-3,3,5-trimethyl-cyclohexane, 2,5-dimethyl-<br>
2,5-di-t-butyl-peroxyhexane, 2,5-dimethyl 2,5-di-t-butyl-peroxyhexane-3, t-amyl peroxy-<br>
ethylhexonate, di-t-butylperoxide, di-(t-amyl) peroxide, 2,5-di (t-amyl peroxy)-2,5-<br>
dimethylhexane, le 2,5-di- (t-butylperoxy)- 2,5-diphenylhexane, bis (o-methylbenzyl)<br>
peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, t-butylperbenzoate, 3,6,9-triethy!-3,6,9-trimethyl-1,4,7-<br>
triperoxonane and bis (t-butylperoxy)diisopropylbenzene, o-a-bis(t-butylperoxy)di-<br><br>
isopropylbenzene, t-butyl-peroxyketone and t-butyl peroxybenzoate, and by silanes, with one<br>
or the other type of cross-linking agent being able to be used singly or in a mixture.<br>
[0074] The cross-linking agent is present in the composition at the amount of 0.1 to 3% by<br>
weight in relation to the total composition.<br>
[0075] When peroxides are used, at least partial cross-linking of the composition takes<br>
place during the composition's blending extrusion phase at high temperatures and at<br>
controlled shearing rates.<br>
FREE RADICAL INITIATOR AND RHEOLOGY MODIFIER<br>
[0076] The composition according to the invention also comprises a rheology modifier<br>
agent or coagent chosen from the group comprising monomer type free radical initiator<br>
compositions, dimers, trimers or very low molecular weight polymers having reactive groups<br>
capable of creating free radicals by thermal decomposition. Such functional groups are, for<br>
example, the allyl groups, the vinyl groups and the methacrylate groups.<br>
[0077] The mechanisms of chain splitting and chain branching in the non-crystalline zones<br>
generated by the action of the free radical initiator coagent allow a rheological modification of<br>
the composition, altering the molecular weight distribution without for all that substantially<br>
modifying the other morphological aspects. It is likely that the behaviour of the propylene<br>
based copolymer, the ethylene and o-olefin copolymer and the specific thermoplastic<br>
elastomer in the molten state are sufficiently different in the presence of the free radicals<br>
generated. The state of the art indicates that splits in chains are easy for polypropylenes<br>
and that these techniques are used to control the viscosity of such polymers. However, the<br>
presence of other polymers makes prediction of ultimate rheological behaviour complex for<br>
the composition according to the invention.<br>
[0078] This coagent generates free radicals because it is very reactive. As soon as the<br>
free radicals are formed they will interact with the ethylene-a-olefin copolymers and partially<br>
cross-link the composition containing these polymers. The degradation of the propylene<br>
copolymer is reduced by the fact that a part of the free radicals is used for cross-linking the<br>
other components of the composition: also the cross-linking agent may be a cross-linking<br>
accelerator.<br><br>
[0079] According to the invention, the free radical initiator coagent in accordance with the<br>
present application are chosen from the group of diallyl terephthalate, triallylcyanurate,<br>
triallylisocyanurate, 1,2 polybutadiene, divinyl benzene, trimethylolpropanetrimethacrylate,<br>
polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate,<br>
allyl methacrylate, N N'-m-phenylene bismaleimide, toluenebismaleimide-p-quinone dioxime,<br>
nitrobenzene and diphenylguanidine.<br>
[0080] Preferably the chosen rheology modifier coagents are triallylcyanurate, 1,2-<br>
polybutadiene, divinyl benzene and trimethyolpropane trimethacrylate (TMPTMA).<br>
[0081] The rheology modifier coagent is added to the composition to the amount of 0.05%<br>
to 2% and preferably from 0.10% to 1.5% by weight of the total composition.<br>
[0082] According to the invention, the composition comprises a stabilisation system. This<br>
stabilisation system is first of all photonic (anti-UV). The photonic stabiliser is chosen from<br>
amongst the HALS type products, i.e. amine with heavy steric bulk, benzophenones,<br>
benzotriazoles which may be used alone or in a mixture.<br>
[0083] The heavy steric bulk amines are preferably chosen. Of these amines, the so-<br>
called polymeric amines have a molecular weight of about 2,000 g/mol, whereas the so-<br>
called monomeric amines have a molecular weight of the order of 500 g/mol.<br>
[0084] This photonic stabilisation agent is incorporated to the amount of from 0.1 % to 0.5%<br>
(1,000 to 5,000 ppm) by weight of the total composition.<br>
[0085] This stabilisation system is also chemical (i.e. anti-oxidising). The antioxidants are<br>
of phenolic type (primary antioxidant), or of phosphites type (secondary antioxidant), used<br>
alone or blended.<br>
[0086] The antioxidant is formulated specifically in quantity terms. The antioxidant is<br>
preferably present in a range of from 0.1% to 0.5% (1,000 to 5,000 ppm) by weight of the<br>
total formulation.<br>
[0087] According to the invention the composition may also comprise 0.5% to 15% by<br>
weight of non-siliceous mineral filler, particularly of the calcium carbonate, talc, carbon black<br><br>
or titanium oxide type. However, the addition of fillers is a step in the wrong direction in<br>
relation to the problem of retaining the property of impact at low temperatures, but reduces<br>
the composition's cost. The addition of nanometric fillers of the lamellar clay type is also<br>
possible. Hence, whilst it is possible to incorporate filler into the composition of the present<br>
invention, preferably the composition contains no filler.<br>
[0088] Finally, colorants in the form of mineral pigments or organic colorants may also be<br>
considered for incorporation in the composition.<br>
[0089] Typically a polytetrafluoroethylene resin would not be used the present invention.<br>
[0090] The components of the composition according to the invention are combined into a<br>
homogenous mixture by any suitable technique such as, for example, mixing extrusion<br>
(compounding). The composition's components are then blended in the form of granules or<br>
in powder form, according to the types of components, in a blender before plast'rfication and<br>
homogenisation. Blending may be effected in a discontinuous process working with batches<br>
or in a continuous process. The components may be mixed, for example, in an internal<br>
mixer of Banbury type, in a single or twin-screw co-rotary or counter-rotary extruder, or in<br>
any other mixer capable of supplying sufficient energy to melt and fully homogenise the<br>
mixture. However, production of the mixture resulting from the composition may be done<br>
preferably by mixing extrusion (compounding) in a twin-screw extruder. In any event, special<br>
care must be paid to the control of temperatures and mixing (shear) conditions (screw profile<br>
and speed of rotation) in order to ensure the performance of the cross-linking agents and the<br>
rheology modifier coagents. Such a mixture must be a uniform and homogenous mixture.<br>
[0091] The components may be incorporated in the mixture sequentially at any stage<br>
during the mixing operation or during the extrusion stage. Pre-determined quantities of<br>
cross-linking agent and free radicals initiator coagent may be injected into the extruder by<br>
the injection orifice downstream of the feed area by an appropriate pump.<br>
[0092] Once mixed, the composition is extruded in pellets obtained by cutting under<br>
cooling water; the pellets, which will be stored for subsequent conversion into items and<br>
parts, in particular a cover intended to be fitted into the steering column or a dashboard or<br>
onto a door panel or any other area of the motor vehicle able to accommodate such an<br>
active safety device working by a bag inflated by a pyrotechnic mechanism. The conversion<br><br>
techniques used are those of plastics processing such as, in particular, injection if a cover is<br>
involved, and having very different wall thicknesses between the tear start zone and the<br>
support and fitting structural zone.<br>
[0093] The composition in accordance with the present invention is used for producing the<br>
cover for the motor vehicle safety airbag for motor vehicles comprising zones designed to<br>
rupture and that must be able to tear under the influence of the airbag's instantaneous<br>
inflation without giving rise to fragmentation in other areas close to the tear zone designed to<br>
this end.<br>
[0094] The rheological properties of the composition according to the invention are such<br>
that they allow the use of the composition in injection moulding machines for the production<br>
of parts comprising areas of very small thicknesses, of the order of a few tenths of a<br>
millimetre, and thus high shearing stress areas, without resulting in excessive injection<br>
pressure requirements, nor giving rise to areas of turbulence that generate orientations of<br>
materials likely to result in surface defects.<br>
[0095] Rheological properties are expressed respectively by<br>
s the fluidity index measurement test measured under 2.16 kg at 230° C in<br>
accordance with ISO standard 1133, but above all by,<br>
s the fill length measurement test, expressed in centimetres, of a spiral from an<br>
injection mould of specified section, this spiral being filled under controlled material<br>
injection pressure, material temperature and mould temperature conditions, with<br>
these conditions being clarified following an internal test.<br>
[0096] One such composition in accordance with the invention provides equally the<br>
processing characteristics such that they enable the production of parts have an excellent<br>
surface finish such that the composition can be moulded at a high production rate from the<br>
short injection time and moreover short release time.<br>
[0097] The parts produced from the composition in accordance with the present invention<br>
don't adhere to the mould surface thereby affecting the fast release of the moulded part.<br><br>

[0098] Examples of the composition are described in the tables below, with the quantities<br>
of components being expressed as percentages by weight in relation to the total complete<br>
composition.<br>

and a melting point of 165°C and a cold temperature notched Izod impact resistance test,<br>

[0100] Selected ethylene-butene copolymers obtained by copolymerisation of ethylene<br>
with a butene co-monomer or with an octene co-monomer in the presence of a so-called<br>
"constrained geometry" catalyst are commercially available in groups such as EXXON<br>
CHEMICAL COMPANY under the trademark EXACT®, DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY and<br>
DOW DUPONT ELASTOMERS under the trademarks AFFINITY® and ENGAGE®, as well<br>
as under the trademark TAFMER® of MITSUI CHEMICALS.<br>

density 0.862 g/cm3 according to ASTM D-792 and fluidity index of 1.0 g/10 min according to<br>
ASTM D-1238 were also tested.<br>
[0102] Finally the ethylene-butene copolymers having the commercial designation of<br>

[0103] The chosen thermoplastic elastomer of the SBS type was Calprene® 501 of the<br>
DYNASOL ELASTOMERS Company. This elastomer is a thermoplastic copolymer<br>
Styrene/Butadiene/Styrene type whose butadiene and styrene contents are 69% and 31%<br>
respectively, (when measured according to the ASTM D-5775 method), polymerised in<br>
solution and having a linear structure. Its Shore A hardness is 76, measured in accordance<br>
with standard ASTM D-2240. Calprene® 501 has a high molecular weight when measured<br>
through its viscosity.<br><br>
[0104] The thermoplastic elastomer of the SBS type chosen for comparative purposes was<br>
• Calprene® 500 from DYNASOL ELASTOMERS. It also has a linear structure but its<br>
molecular weight is always lower when measured through its viscosity.<br>
[0105] The molecular weights of Calprene® 500 and 501 are Mw = 110,000 g/mole for<br>
Calprene® 500 and Mw = 150,000 g/mole for Calprene® 501 respectively.<br>
[0106] By way of comparative testing other thermoplastic elastomers were tested:<br>
These were SEEPS, which are polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene-ethylene/propylene)-b-<br>
polystyrenes, (b) designing the blocks. These materials are hydrogenated poly(styrene-b-<br>
isoprene/butadiene-b-styrene). Two different types of SEEPS were tested; Septon® 4033,<br>
with low molecular weight and Septon® 4055, with high molecular weight. These two<br>
thermoplastic elastomers are available from KURARAY CO LTD.<br>
[0107] Another thermoplastic elastomer was also tested; this was SEBS (Styrene/ethylene/<br>
butadiene/styrene) sold under the name Tuftec® H1062 by ASAHI KASEI CHEMICAL<br>
CORP. The styrene content was 17.5% by weight.<br>
[0108] The cross-linking agent used is an organic peroxide of the 2,5-Dimethyl-2,5-di(t-<br>
butylperoxy)hexane type, reference 101-XL-45, marketed under the trademark Luperox® by<br>
ATOFINA ARKEMA. Another agent was also tested, reference 101-PP-75, marketed under<br>
the trademark Luperox® by ATOFINA ARKEMA. This product contains for the most part<br>
2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(t-butylperoxy) hexane, but also 3,3,6,6-tetramethyl-1,2-dioxacyclohexane<br>
and di-tert-butyl peroxide.<br>
[0109] Other cross-linking agents would have been quite possible, such as Luperox® F of<br>
ATOFINA ARKEMA, still of the bis (tertio-butylperoxyisopropyl)benzene type or of the tertio-<br>
butylcumylperoxyde type, for example reference Luperox® 801 or Trigonox® T of AKZO<br>
NOBEL CHEMICALS, or of di-tertio-butylperoxide type, for example reference Trigonox® B.<br>
[0110] The rheology modification coagent used as a free radical initiator is a<br>
trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate (TMPTMA) in the form of master mixture on a calcium<br>
carbonate support at 70% by weight, commercially available under the ALCAN POUDRE<br>
TMPTMA 70 • EP from SAFTIC ALCAN. Trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate is available<br>
from ATOFINA SR-350 (TMPTMA).<br><br>
[0111] Other coagents which may be used such as trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate (SR-<br>
350 KD96 from SARTOMER Company Inc which may or may not be on a calcium silicate<br>
support or trially cyanurates from CYTEC INDUSTRIES INC . or 1,2-polybutadiene sold<br>
under the name RICON® 152D from SARTOMER CORPORATION which may again be<br>
alone or on a calcium silicate support.<br>
[0112] A thermal stability agent Ultra-violet stabilisation was introduced to the composition.<br>
It was tris(2,4-ditert-buty!phenyl) phosphite sold under the trademark Irgafos® 168 by CIBA<br>
SPECIALTY CHEMICALS.<br>
[0113] Carbon black in the form of a master blend sold under the reference POLYBLAK®<br>
1423 by A. SCHULMAN was added to the composition.<br>
[0114] Implementation was effected on a Maris laboratory twin-screw extruder with 40 mm<br>
screw diameter equipped with eleven heating zones whose temperature instructions were<br>
set between 180° C and 220° C.<br>
[0115] The propylene based co-polymers, or-olefin polyethylenes, thermoplastic<br>
elastomers, cross-linking agents and rheology modifier coagents, as well as the different<br>
additives, were fed into the extruder's main input after being mixed in a slow mixer. A water-<br>
cooled head cutter device enabled pellets to be fabricated.<br>
[0116] The essential characterisation properties of the composition according to the<br>
invention were respectively hardness expressed as Shore D in accordance with ISO<br>
standard 868, the fluidity index expressed in g/10 minutes under 2.16 kg at 230° C<br>
respectively according to ISO standard 1133 (equivalent to ASTM 1238).<br>
[0117] Rheological characterisation combining viscosity performance under a high<br>
shearing rate such as exists in an injection process was done by means of the spiral length<br>
test expressed in centimetres of fill of such a mould rather than by measurement of a fluidity<br>
index under higher load.<br><br>
[0118] Sample test-pieces were produced from the composition according to the invention<br>
thus extruded and then granulated according to the accepted standards for fabricating test-<br>
pieces by injection.<br>
[0119] The test and measurement conditions were those described in the ISO and ASTM<br>
standards with regard to mechanical tests, as well as traction properties, tensile strength and<br>
elongation at break at ambient temperature and at -35° C, (ISO R527, ASTM D 638, 20<br>
mm/min traction speed), for the flexing modulus (ISO 178, ASTM D 790 2 mm/min), tearing,<br>
(ISO 34), and cold temperature Izod impact resistance properties on a notched test-piece,<br>
(ASTM D 256).<br>
[0120] For the low temperature tests, the actual temperature of the sample was retained<br>
and in particular with the impact tests (notched Izod impact resistance test-pieces) were<br>
carried out at temperatures of -40° C, -45° C and -50" C respectively.<br>
[0121] A correlation was determined leading to the conclusion that a non-rupture of a test-<br>
piece under notched impact at -45° C allowed passage of the actual rupture tests for the<br>
safety airbag at -35° C actual temperature and that a non-rupture under notched impact at -<br>
50° C allowed passage with total safety of all the safety airbag rupture tests whatever the<br>
currently set temperature conditions.<br>
[0122] Another correlation was worked out leading to the conclusion that a composition<br>
whose fluidity index under 2.16 kg at 230° C of between 2 and 12 g/10 minutes combined<br>
with a spiral filling of between 20 and 50 centimetres allowed the meeting of requirements in<br>
respect of the ability to fill moulds and the surface appearance for such injected parts.<br>
[0123] The experimental data set out in Table 1 show the performance differences in terms<br>
of cold temperature notched impact performance between a control composition (bearing<br>
reference 2a) not comprising thermoplastic elastomer and the composition according to the<br>
invention (bearing reference 1a). If resistance to cold temperature notched impact at -40° C<br>
is equivalent in both instances, there is a large difference in favour of the composition<br>
according to the invention, i.e. with the thermoplastic elastomer present. The test-pieces<br>
made from a composition not containing thermoplastic elastomer will break suddenly when<br>
tested for notched impact resistance when cold measured at -45° C, whereas the test-<br>
pieces made from the composition containing a thermoplastic elastomer do not break.<br><br>
[0124] The quantities of linear a-olefin polyethylenes are the same in both instances, 37%<br>
and 38% respectively, the cross-linking additives and the coagents are identical, but the<br>
percentage of polypropylene was reduced and replaced by the specific thermoplastic<br>
elastomer within the scope of the composition according to the invention. The fluidity index<br>
of the composition according to the invention is slightly lower, likewise resulting a smaller<br>
spiral length due to the composition's higher viscosity.<br><br><br><br>
[0125] Table 2 shows the effect of the percentage of SBS in the composition on both the<br>
resistance to impact of the energy absorbing material notched impact resistance at -45°C<br>
and fluidity.<br><br><br><br>
[0126] The experimental data collated in Table 3 show the influence of the molecular<br>
weight of the thermoplastic elastomer included in the composition according to the invention.<br><br><br><br>
[0127] The use of a high molecular weight thermoplastic elastomer in the composition<br>
according to the invention makes it possible to ensure low temperature notched impact<br>
resistance. The thermoplastic elastomer considered in this test is SBS.<br>
[0128] The experimental data collated in Table 4 show the effect of different types of<br>
thermoplastic elastomers it is possible to use, for example SBS, SEBS, SEEPS, and to do<br>
so in different molecular weights in the composition according to the invention. All<br>
percentages are identical for the composition's components. The thermoplastic elastomer is<br>
added at 4% in the three examples. The performance of the composition using the SBS of<br>
high molecular weight is clearly greater than the performance of the other two compositions<br>
using the other low molecular weight thermoplastic elastomers. It should be noted that the<br>
traction and tearing properties do not denote this type of difference in favour of the<br>
composition using the SBS with the higher molecular weight. In addition, the flow values in<br>
the injection conditions are quite comparable.<br><br><br><br>
[0129] The experimental data collated in Table 5 show the mechanical resistance<br>
properties of test-pieces produced from compositions using different types of ethylene-cr-<br>
olefin copolymers, ethylene-butene copolymers and ethylene-octene copolymers obtained<br>
by copolymerisation of ethylene with a co-monomer of butene or octene in the presence of a<br>
so-called "constrained geometry" catalyst according to their density and their fluidity index.<br><br><br><br>
[0130] In both instances the fluidity index of the cr-olefin is 1 g/10 minutes, and the<br>
densities are low at 0.857 g/cm3for ethylene-butene and 0.863 g/cm3 for ethylene-octene. It<br>
is observed that the crystallinity of the ethylene-butene is less than the crystallinity of the<br>
ethylene-octene at identical densities.<br>
[0131] The experimental data collated in Table 6 show the results of using butene type a-<br>
olefins with different densities and fluidity indexes<br>
[0132] It is observed that a very high value fluidity index gives a reduction in performance<br>
of the utilisation of a-olefins having very high densities<br><br><br><br>
[0133] This data shows that at equal densities but much higher fluidity index values there<br>
is a loss of impact resistance and that the choice of very low density results in high<br>
resistance to shock values<br>
[0134] The experiments depicted in Table 7 show results comparing compositions in<br>
accordance with the invention using different of propylene copolymers.<br><br><br><br><br>
[0135] The results with a propylene based homopolymer clearly show a weakness to<br>
impact at low temperatures of such compositions. The results with polypropylene based<br>
copolymers give resistance values using the Choc Izod at ambient temperature of &gt;40kJ/m2<br>
showing the differences also show the differences in the energy absorbed by the materials.<br>
[0136] The effects of the cross-linking system are illustrated in Tables 8, 9 and 10<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
