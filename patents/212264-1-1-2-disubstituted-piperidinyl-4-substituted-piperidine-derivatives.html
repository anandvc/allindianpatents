This invention concerns 1-(1,2-disubstituted piperidinyl)-4-sibstituted piperidine derivatives having tachykinin antagonistic acitivity, in particular substance P antagonistic activity, and their preparation; it further relates to compositions comprising them, as well as their use as a medicine.<br>
Substance P is a naturally occurring neuropeptide of the tachykinin family. There are ample studies showing that substance P and other tachykinins are involved in a variety of biological actions, and therefore, play an essential role in various disorders (Regoli et al. Pharmacological Reviews 46(4), 1994, p.551-599, "Receptors and Antagonists for Substance P and Related Peptides'). The development of tachykinin antagonists has ted to date to a series of peptide compounds of which might be anticipated that they are metabolically too labile to be employed as pharmaceutically active substances (Longmore J. et. al., DN &amp;P 8(1), February 1954.p.5-23, Neurokinin Receptors'). The present invention concerns nonptide tachykinin antagonists, in particular nonpeptide substance P mtagonists, which in general are metabolkally more stable, and hence, may be more appropriate as pharmaceutk:alty active substances.<br>
Several nonpeptile tachykinin antagonists are disclosed in the art. For instance, EP-0,32,456-A, (Ciba-Geigy)published on March 17, 1993, discloses 1-acylpiperidine compounds, in particular 2-arylalkyl-1-arylcarbonyl-4-pipertdinamine derivatives, and ther use as substance P antagonists.<br>
EP-0,151,824-A(JAB 435) and EP-0,151,826-A(JAB 436) disclose structurally related 1-(1-(carbonyl or imino)-4-piperidinyl)-4-piperidinamine derivatives as histamine- and serotonine antagonists.<br>
The present compounds differ from the art compounds by their structure and by their favourable pharmacological properties.<br><br>

-8-<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be prepared by reductively N-alkylating an intermediate of formula (III) with an intermediate of formula (II). Said reductive N-alkylation may be performed in a reaction-inert solvent such as, for example, dichloromethane, ethanol, toluene or a mixture thereof, and in the presence of a reducing agent such as, for example, a borohydride, e.g. sodium borohydride, sodium cyano-borohydride or triacetoxy borohydride. In case a borohydride is used as a reducing agent, it may be convenient to use a catalyst such as, for example, titanium(IV) isopropylate as described in J. Org. Chem, 1990, 55, 2552-2554. Using said catalyst may also result in an improved cisltrans ratio in favour of the trans isomer. It may also be convenient to use hydrogen as a reducing agent in combination with a suitable catalyst such as, for example, palladium-on-charcoal or platinum-on-charcoal. In case hydrogen is used as reducing agent, it may be advantageous to add a dehydrating agent to the reaction mixmre such as, for example, aluminium tert-butoxide. In order to prevent the undesired further hydrogenation of certain functional groups in the reactants and the reaction products, it may also be advantageous to add an appropriate catalyst-poison to the reaction mixture, e.g., thiophene or quinoline-sulphur. Stirring and optionally elevated temperatures and/or pressure may enhance the rate of the reaction.<br><br>
In this and the following preparations, the reaction products may be isolated from the reaction medium and, if necessary, further purified according to methodologies generally known in the art such as, for example, extraction, crystallization, trituration and chromatography.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can also be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (IV) wherein W1 is an appropriate leaving group such as, for example, a halogen, e.g. chloro or bromo, or a sulfonyloxy leaving group, e.g. methanesulfonyloxy or benzenesulfonyloxy, with an intermediate of formula (V). The reaction can be performed in a reaction-inert solvent such as, for example, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, e.g. dichloromethane, an alcohol, e.g. ethanol, or a ketone, e.g. methyl isobutylketone, and in the presence of a suitable base such as, for example, sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate or triethylamine. Stirring may enhance the rate of the reaction. The reaction may conveniently be carried out at a temperature ranging between RT and reflux temperature.<br><br><br>
-9-<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may also be prepared by reacting a piperidinone derivative of formula (VI) with an appropriate organometallic reagent of formula (VII) wherein R4 is the same as R4 but other than hydrogen and M is an organometallic part such as, e.g. -MgBr, yielding compounds of formula (I) wherein R5 is -OH, said compounds being represented by formula (I-a).<br><br>
As outlined below, compounds of formula (I) may be converted into each other using art-known transformations.<br>
For instance, compounds of formula (I) wherein R5 is -OH may be converted into compounds of formula (I) wherein R5 is Ar3C1-6alkyloxy, di(Ar3)C1-6alkyloxy or a<br>
radical of formula (a-1) wherein Y is O.<br>
Also, compounds of formula (I) wherein R5 is -NR7H may be converted into compounds of formula (I) wherein R5 is -NR7R8, R8 being other than hydrogen; or wherein R5 is a radical of formula (a-1) wherein Y is -NR7-<br>
Further, compounds of formula (I) wherein R5 is a radical of formula (a-2) wherein R10 is hydrogen may be converted into compounds of formula (I) wherein R5 is a radical of formula (a-2) wherein R10 is a C1-6alkylcarbonyl.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may also be converted to the corresponding N-oxide forms following art-known procedures for converting a trivalent nitrogen into its N-oxide form. Said N-oxidation reaction may generally be carried out by reacting the starting material of formula (I) with an appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide. Appropriate inorganic peroxides comprise, for example, hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal or earth alkaline metal peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides may comprise peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarboperoxoic acid or halo substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chlorobenzenecarboperoxoic acid, peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid,<br><br>

alkylhydroperoxides, e.g. tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, lower alkanols, e.g. ethanol and the like, hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, ketones, e.g. 2-butanone, halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, and mixtures of such solvents.<br>
The starting materials and some of the intermediates are known compounds and are commercially available or may be prepared according to conventional reaction procedures generally known in the art. For example, intermediates of formula (HI), (IV), (Vn) and (XI) may be prepared according to art-known procedures.<br>
Intermediates of formula (II) may be prepared by condensing an intermediate of formula (IV) with an intermediate of formula (VIII) analogous to the procedure described in EP-0,532,456-A.<br><br>
The preparation of intermediates of formula (VIII) is also described in EP-0,532,456-A. However, intermediates of formula (VIII) wherein R1 is optionally substituted Ar1C1-6alkyl or di(Ar1)C1-4alkyl, said R1 being represented by -CH(R1a)2 and said<br>
intermediates being represented by formula (VUI-a), may also be prepared as depicted in scheme 1.<br><br>
In scheme 1, the intermediates of formula (IX-b) may be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (IX-a) with an aldehyde or a ketone of formula (X). The C1-6alkyl-<br><br>
-11-<br>
carbamate moiety in the intermediates of formula (IX-b) may be converted into a fused oxazolone which in turn may be reduced to an intermediate of formula (DC-d). Said intermediate (IX-d) may in turn be deprotected, thus forming an intermediate of formula (Vni-a). Subsequently, intermediates of formula (Vni-a) may be reacted with an intermediate of formula (IV) to prepare intermediates of formula (II) wherein R1 is defined as -CH(R1a)2, said intermediates being represented by formula (Il-a). The<br>
reactions performed in scheme 1 may all be conducted following conventional methods that are generally known in the art.<br>

The ketalized intermediate of formula (DC-c) may be transformed to the corresponding ketone of formula (IX-e) which subsequently may be reductively aminated with a pyrrolidine, piperidine or homopiperidine derivative of formula (HI). The thus obtained intermediate may then be reduced with a suitable reducing agent to an intermediate of formula (V-a).<br>
Piperidinone derivatives of formula (VI) may be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (II) with an intermediate of formula (XI), according to the previously described N-alkylation procedure, followed by deprotection.<br><br>
Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) may be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. Diastereomers may be separated by physical methods such as selective crystallization and chromatographic techniques, e.g., counter-current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) as prepared in the hereinabove described processes are generally racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of formula (I) which are sufficiently basic or acidic may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid, respectively chiral base. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali or acid. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) involves liquid chromatography, in particular liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereo-specifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) have valuable pharmacological properties in that they interact with tachykinin receptors and they antagonize tachykinin-induced effects, especially substance P-induced effects, both in vivo and in vitro and are thus of use in<br><br>
-13-<br>
the treatment of tachykinin-mediated diseases, and in particular in substance P-mediated diseases.<br>
Tachykinins, also referred to as neurokinins, are a family of peptides among which substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA), neurokinin B (NKB) and neuropeptide K (NPK) may be identified. They are naturally occurring in mammals, including human beings, and are distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system, where they act as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators. Their actions are mediated through several subtypes of receptors, such as, for example, NKj, NK2 and NK3 receptors.      Substance P displays highest affinity for NK1 receptors, whereas NKA preferentially binds to NK2 receptors and NKB preferentially binds to NK3 receptors. However, the selectivity of these tachykinins is relatively poor and under physiological conditions the action of any of these tachykinins might be mediated by activation of more than one receptor type.<br>
Substance P and other neurokinins are involved in a variety of biological actions such as pain transmission (nociception), neurogenic inflammation, smooth muscle contraction, plasma protein extravasation, vasodilation, secretion, mast cell degranulation, and also in activation of the immune system. A number of diseases are deemed to be engendered by activation of neurokinin receptors, in particular the NK1 receptor, by excessive release of substance P and other neurokinins in particular cells such as cells in the neuronal plexi of the gastrointestinal tract, unmyelinated primly sensory afferent neurons, sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons and nonneuronal cell types (DN&amp;P 8(1), February 1995, p. 5-23, "Neurokinin Receptors" by Longmore J. et al.; Pharmacological Reviews 46(4), 1994, p. 551-599, "Receptors and Antagonists for Substance P and Related Peptides" by Regoli et al).       <br>
The compounds of the present invention are potent inhibitors of neurokinin-mediated effects, in particular those mediated via the NK1 receptor, and may therefore be escribed as tachykinin antagonists, especially as substance P antagonists, as indicated in vitro by the antagonism of substance P-induced relaxation of pig coronary arteries 'which is described hereinafter. The binding affinity of the present compounds for the human, guinea-pig and gerbil neurokinin receptors may be determined in vitro in a receptor binding test using H-substance P as radioligand.   The subject compounds also show substance-P antagonistic activity in vivo as may be evidenced by, for instance, the antagonism of substance P-induced plasma extravasation in guinea-pigs, or the antagonism of drug-induced emesis in ferrets (Watson et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. 115,84-94,1995).<br><br>
-14-<br>
In view of their capability to antagonize the actions of tachykinins by blocking the tachykinin receptors, and in particular antagonizing the actions of substance P by blocking the NK1 receptor, the subject compounds are useful in the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of tachykinin-mediated diseases such as, for example,<br>

The compounds of the present invention have a favourable metabolic stability and exhibit good oral availability. They also have an advantageous onset and duration of action. The compounds of formula (I) also have the ability to penetrate the central nervous system as may be demonstrated in vivo by their inhibitory effect on the change in behaviour induced by intracerebroventricular-applied substance P in the gerbil.<br>
In view of the utility of the compounds of formula (I), there is provided a method of treating warm-blooded animals, including humans, suffering from tachykinin-mediated diseases as mentioned hereinabove, in particular, pain, emesis or asthma. Said method comprises the systemic administration of an effective tachykinin antagonizing amount of a compound of formula (I), a N-oxide form, a pharmaceutically acceptable addition<br><br>
-16-<br>
salt or a possible stereoisomeric form thereof, to warm-blooded animals, including humans. Hence, the use of a compound of formula (I) as a medicine is provided, and in particular a medicine to treat pain, emesis or asthma.<br>
For ease of administration, the subject compounds may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, a therapeutically effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules<br>
represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid <br>
pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable solutions containing<br>
compounds of formula (I) may be formulated in an oil for prolonged action<br>
Appropriate oils for this purpose are, for example, peanut oil, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, soy bean oil, synthetic glycerol esters of long chain fatty acids and mixtures of these and other oils. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wettable agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not cause any significant deleterious effects on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on or as an ointment. Acid or base addition salts of compounds of formula (I) due to their increased water solubility over the<br><br>
-17-<br>
corresponding base or acid form, are obviously more suitable in the preparation of aqueous compositions.<br>
In order to enhance the solubility and/or the stability of the compounds of formula (I) in pharmaceutical compositions, it can be advantageous to employ a-, ß- or ?-cyclo-dextrins or their derivatives, in particular hydroxyalkyl substituted cyclodextrins, e.g. 2-hydroxypropyl-ß-cyclodextrin. Also co-solvents such as alcohols may improve the solubility and/or the stability of the compounds of formula (I) in pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>
Those of skill in the treatment of tachykinin mediated diseases could determine the effective therapeutic daily amount from the test results presented hereinafter. An effective therapeutic daily amount would be from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 40 mg/kg body weight, more preferably from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 5 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to administer the therapeutically effective dose once daily or as two, three, four or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example, containing 0.05 mg to 500 mg, and in particular, 0.5 mg to 50 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.<br>
The exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular compound of formula (I) used, the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight and general physical condition of the particular patient as well as other medication the patient may be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the response of the treated patient and/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention. The effective daily amount ranges mentioned hereinabove are therefore only guidelines.<br><br>

Example C.l : Antagonism of substance-P induced relaxation of the pig coronary<br>
arteries<br>
Segments of coronary arteries taken from pigs (killed by injection of an overdose of<br>
sodium pentobarbital) were inverted and mounted for recording of isometric tension in<br>
organ baths (volume 20 ml) with the endothelium at the outside. The preparations were<br>
bathed in Krebs - Henseleit solution. The solution was kept at 37 °C and gassed with a<br>
mixture of O2 / CO2 (95/5). After stabilisation of the preparations, prostaglandin F2a<br>
(10"5 M) was administered to induce a contraction. This was repeated until contractile responses became stable. Then prostaglandin F2a was again administered and<br>
substance P (3x10"*^ ^4 and 10"^ M cumulatively) was added. Substance P induced endothelium dependent relaxations. After washing away the agonists, a known concentration of a compound of formula (I) was added. After an incubation period of<br><br>
-37-<br>
30 minutes, prostaglandin F2a (10-5 M) and the same concentrations of substance P as described above were again administered in the presence of the compound to be tested. Relaxations caused by substance P were expressed as relaxations under control conditions, and percentage inhibition (% inhibition) of the response to 10-9 M substance P was taken as a measure of the antagonistic activity of the compound to be tested. The results for the compounds of the present invention at a certain test concentration are listed in table 6<br>
