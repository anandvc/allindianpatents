Description<br>
The present invention relates to a chip module in particular for implantation in a chip card body, having a carrier and a chip fitted on the carrier.<br>
Chip modules of this type are known in a large number of different embodiments.<br>
The core of any chip module is, as already indicated by the designation, a (semiconductor) chip. This chip is bonded by means of an adhesive onto a carrier, which is as a rule produced from epoxy resin or the like, and connected electrically by means of bonding or the like to conductive structures provided on the carrier.<br>
If the chip module is provided for use in a chip card having external contact points (provided with contacts), then the conductive structures of the carrier comprise at least the contact areas (surface contacts) of the chip card to be produced. If the chip module is provided for use in a chip card not provided with contacts, that is to say a contactless chip card, then the conductive structures of the carrier comprise at least those structures which are provided for the purpose of connection to an antenna which is arranged outside the chip module, put more precisely, to an antenna integrated in the chip card body.<br>
In order to protect the chip, as a rule a stiffening frame, which surrounds the said chip and is normally metallic, is bonded onto the carrier and filled with a compound protecting the chip and the bonding wires (against mechanical damage and against optical analyses).<br>
The finished chip module is finally inserted<br>
(implanted) into an appropriate cut-out in a chip card<br>
body, which results in the production of a chip card<br><br>
2<br>
which is ready to use.<br>
If the chip card to he produced is a chip card provided with contacts, then<br>
the implantation of the chip module into the chip card body can be performed<br>
merely by means of mechanical joining (bonding) of chip module and chip card<br>
body. Chip modules designed for such applications specifically contain, as has<br>
already been mentioned above, not only the chip itself but also the contact area<br>
(surface contacts) located on the outside on the finished chip card, so that no<br>
electrical connection is necessary between the chip module and the chip card<br>
body.	<br>
If the chip card to be produced is a chip card which can be operated without contact, then the implantation of the chip module into the chip card body requires, in addition to the mechanical joining of chip module and chip card body, also an electrical connection of the same (in order to connect an antenna integrated in the chip card body to the chip contained in the chip module).<br>
Experience shows that contactless chip cards in particular are now and then not usable at all or usable only to a limited extent.<br>
The present invention is therefore based on the object of developing the chip module, in particular for implantation in a chip card body, having a carrier and a chip fitted on the carrier in such a way that chip cards which can be operated without contact can be reliably produced without faults in an extremely simple way by using the said chip module.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by a chip card having a carrier on which there is provided a base-like elevation running wholly or partly around the chip and electric conductor tracks, and/or contact areas, said electric conductor tracks, and/or said contact areas, at points where they encounter the elevation, are a constituent part of the elevation.<br>
As a result of the provision of the said elevation, it is possible to provide for the stiffening frame a bearing surface on which the said frame can be placed over a large area and in a precisely defined position, irrespective of other structures on the relevant surface of the carrier of the chip module.<br>
it is thus possible reliably to rule out the	<br><br>
 	- 3 -<br>
situation in which conductive structures such as conductor tracks and the like, which run on that surface of the carrier of the chip module on which the stiffening frame is to be arranged, can be electrically short-circuited or negatively influenced in any other way by the latter.<br>
This applies even when at least parts of the elevation are formed by the said conductive structures which are to be protected against short circuits, and the stiffening frame is "only simply" bonded onto the elev-ation. The possibility of being borne over a large area and uniformly, which the elevation for the stiffening frame can offer, in particular ensures that the stiffen-ing frame can form a connection to the elevation all round only indirectly via the (preferably insulating) adhesive.<br>
The bearing surface, which runs all around essentially without interruption and in planar fashion and which can be provided for the elevation for the stiffening frame, moreover ensures that it is not possible for any gaps, or in any case no such gap as cannot be more or less completely filled by the adhesive by means of which the stiffening frame is bonded onto the elevation, to be produced between the stiffening frame and the bearing surface on which the former is placed. This achieves the situation where a covering compound provided in order to produce a so-called globe top and with which the interior of the stiffening frame is more or less completely filled, cannot escape to the outside. This has in turn the positive effect that, otherwise than hitherto, there is no risk that conductive structures which run outside the stiffening frame and which are to be connected electrically to chip card components located outside the chip module, will be covered by a covering compound escaping from the stiffening frame, and hence made unusable for electrical connections.<br>
Conductive structures, which are provided on that side of the carrier on which the stiffening frame is also to be placed, are therefore negatively influenced by the<br><br>
4<br>
stiffening frame neither in their electrical properties nor in their mechanical properties.<br>
Hence, even those conductive structures which serve to connect the chip contained in the chip module to the antenna integrated in the chip cad body in particular remain uninfluenced.<br>
This is correspondingly true for the case in which the chip, without the provision of a stiffening frame, is covered with an appropriately solid (rigid) covering compound such as a moulding compound, a heat-curable covering compound or the like. In this case, the elevation can be used as a supporting surface and/or bearing surface for a casting mould or other aid. Hence it is possible to ensure, even in this case, that a maximum number of those gaps or interruptions between the casting mould and the carrier which cannot he penetrated by the covering compound used are present or remain open.<br>
Consequently, a chip module is provided by means of which in particular chip cards whose chip modules have to be connected electrically to the chip card body, that is say inter alia also chip cards which can be operated without contact, can be reliably produced without faults in an extremely simple way by using the said chip module.<br>
With the foregoing and other objects in view there is provided, in accordance with the invention a chip module, in particular for implantation in a chip card body having a carrier and a chip fitted on the carrier, characterized in that there is provided, on the carrier, a base-like elevation running wholly or partly around the chip and electric conductor tracks and/or contact areas, said electric conductor tracks and/or said contact areas, at points where they encounter the elevation, are a constituent part of the elevation.<br>
In accordance with an added feature of the invention, the elevation is formed by an electrically conductive structure fitted onto the carrier.<br>
In accordance with an additional feature of the invention, the elevation is a frame carrier essentially running completely around the chip, and a stiffening frame is placed on the frame carrier.<br><br>
4A<br>
In accordance with another feature of the invention, the elevation is adapted to have casting moulds placed thereon for forming a chip covering on the chip.<br>
In accordance with a further feature of the invention, a plurality of conductor tracks and/or contact areas are formed on the carrier, and wherein the elevation is produced in concomitant production steps together with the electric conductor tracks and/or contact areas.<br>
In accordance with again an added feature of the invention, the electric conductor tracks and/or contact areas form a constituent part of the elevation at mutual intersection points where the electric conductor tracks and/or contact areas encounter the elevation.<br>
In accordance with again an additional feature of the invention, the elevation is formed with interruptions disposed such that parts of the elevation formed by the electric conductor tracks and/or the contact areas cannot be short-circuited by parts of the elevation not formed by the electric conductor tracks and/or contact areas.<br>
In accordance with again another feature of the invention, the interruptions are respectively formed between the parts of the elevation formed by the electric conductor tracks and/or the contact areas and the parts of the elevation not formed by the electric conductor tracks and/or the contact areas.<br>
In accordance with again a further feature of the invention, the interruptions are formed so as to be substantially impenetrable by a covering compound forming a chip covering.<br>
In accordance with yet an added feature of the invention, the interruptions are formed so as to be filled with an adhesive bonding a stiffening frame onto the elevation.<br>
In accordance with a concomitant feature of the invention, parts of the elevation formed by the electric conductor tracks and/or contact areas have a height that is equal to or smaller than a height of the parte of the elevation not formed by the electric conductor tracks and/or contact areas.<br><br>
4B<br>
The invention with its advantageous developments will be explained in more detail below using an exemplary embodiment, with reference to the accompanying, drawing, in which<br>
Figure 1 shows a plan view of a carrier strip having a multiplicity of partly finished chip modules according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows a sectional view, running in steps through various levels, through a completely finished chip module according to the invention, and<br>
Figure 3 shows a sectional view, in highly schematic form, of a chip card body<br>
having a chip module according to the invention inserted into said	<br><br>
chip card body.<br>
The chip module according to the invention can be inserted into chip card bodies like the conventional chip modules, which produces a chip card as a result. However, chip modules of this type can be used not only for the "normal" chip cards which are usual at present, such as telephone cards, authentication cards and the like, but in general for cards containing chips or modules of any type, that is to say, for example, also for the so-called SIM modules for mobile telephones, etc.<br>
The chip module which is described below is suitable for the production of a chip card which can be used both as a chip card provided with contacts and as a contactless chip card. For reasons of simplicity, chip cards of this type will be referred to below as combi-cards.<br>
Combi-cards are distinguished by the fact that, on the one hand, they have external connection options at predetermined locations in the form of surface contacts for wire-bound information transfer, and on the other hand have an antenna for wireless information transfer.<br>
The surface contacts are integrated in the chip module, whereas the antenna is contained in the chip card body and has to be electrically connected to corresponding connections on the chip module (of its chip).<br>
Although the chip module which is described below is in particular suitable for use in combi-cards and chip cards that can be operated without contact, chip modules designed in accordance with the invention can also in principle be used advantageously in any other chip cards and chip modules.<br>
The chip module described in more detail below is designated by the reference symbol 1 in the figures. The chip module 1 is one of a large number of chip modules which are constructed on a carrier 10, lying one behind another and one alongside another.<br>
A carrier strip is preferably used as the carrier 10. A detail of such a carrier strip with four chip modules 1 that are still in production is shown in<br><br>
	- 6 -<br>
Figure 1.<br>
The carrier strip (consisting of an electrically insulating epoxy resin) has lateral perforation holes, which enables simple and reliable transport of the carrier strip during the production of the chip modules 1. Constructed on the detail drawn of the carrier strip are four chip modules 1 which, following their finishing, are separated by cutting up or sawing up the carrier strip along the cut lines 11 drawn with dotted lines in Figure 1.<br>
The construction of each chip module 1 can be seen from Figure 1 (plan view) and from Figure 2 (lateral sectional view) ; in Figure 2, although this is a sectional illustration, no hatching has been drawn in for reasons of better clarity.<br>
The core of each chip module 1 is a chip 13 that is bonded onto the carrier 10 by an adhesive 12. This chip 13 is preferably connected by bonding to conductive structures provided on the carrier 10 or within the carrier 10.<br>
The conductive structures in the example being considered are located both on the side of the carrier 10 on which the chip 13 is arranged and also on the side of the carrier 10 opposite this side. That side of the carrier 10 on which the chip 13 is arranged will be referred to below as the chip side 14 of the carrier 10, and the side of the carrier 10 lying opposite the chip side 14 will be referred to as its contact area side 15.<br>
The conductive structures constructed on the chip side 14 of the carrier 10 comprise a first conductor track 16 running on this side of the chip 13 and a second conductor track 17 running on the other side of the chip 13, via which an antenna provided in the chip card body can be connected to the chip 13; the conductor tracks 16 and 17 are connected via bonding wires 18 to appropriate connections of the chip 13.<br>
The conductive structures constructed on the contact area side 15 of the carrier 10 are constructed as contact areas (surface contacts) 19, via which the chip<br><br>
 	- 7 - <br>
card containing the chip module 1 described can subsequently be made contact with; the contact areas 19 are connected via bonding wires 20 to appropriate connections on the chip 13, the bonding wires 20 in each case running through bonding holes 21 provided in the carrier 10.<br>
The connections of the chip 13, via which the latter is to be connected via the conductor tracks 16 and 17 to the antenna, are not at the same time those connections which are to be connected to the connecting points 19. This makes it possible to prevent the antenna connections of the chip being short-circuited via the connecting points 19.<br>
The chip 13 is surrounded by a stiffening frame 22, which is placed on a base-like elevation in the form of a frame carrier 23 constructed on the carrier 10.<br>
The frame carrier 23 essentially runs all around the chip 13; it consists of the same material as the conductor tracks 16 and 17 provided on the same side of the carrier 10, that is to say on the chip side 14, and is produced together with the said conductor tracks in the same way.<br>
At the point where the conductor tracks 16 and 17 run through under the stiffening frame 22, these simultaneously form part of the frame carrier 23. The frame carrier parts formed by the conductor tracks 16 and 17 and the frame carrier parts not formed by the conductor tracks 16 and 17 have the same height and as a result form a planar bearing surface, on which the stiffening frame 22 can be placed over a large area and in a precisely defined manner, that is to say in particular without tilting. As an alternative, provision can be made for the conductor tracks 16 and 17 to be constructed to be somewhat lower than those parts of the frame carrier 23 which are not formed by the conductor tracks 16 and 17.<br>
In order that the conductor tracks 16 and 17 are not short-circuited or electrically influenced in any other way by the frame carrier sections which are not<br><br>
 	- 8 -<br>
formed by the former and are likewise metallic, appropriate interruptions (gaps) are provided in the frame carrier 23.<br>
These interruptions, not illustrated in the figures, are preferably provided directly alongside the conductor tracks 16 and 17, that is say between the frame carrier parts which are formed by the conductor tracks 16 and 17 and the frame carrier parts which are not formed by the conductor tracks 16 and 17. This makes it possible to prevent the physical properties of the conductor tracks 16 and 17, in particular their capacitive and inductive reactances, from being changed excessively. However, in principle an arbitrary number of interruptions can be provided and constructed at arbitrary points on the frame carrier 23.<br>
The width and/or the shape of the interruptions are intended to be dimensioned such that on the one hand a good electrical insulation effect is achieved, and on the other hand a gap is formed only such that a covering compound described in more detail later cannot escape through it. In the example being considered, the width of the interruption preferably lies in the range between 10 µm and 100 µm.<br>
In order to fasten the stiffening frame 22 on the frame carrier 23 described, an electrically insulating adhesive is used. The thickness of the adhesive layer which can be introduced between the frame carrier 23 and the stiffening frame 22 varies between 10 µm and 35 µm but - in each case given the provision of the described frame carrier 23 - is sufficiently great to prevent the conductor tracks 16 and 17, which certainly form parts of the frame carrier 23, being short-circuited by the stiffening frame 22, which is generally metallic. The relatively low thickness of the adhesive layer to be introduced between the frame carrier 23 and the stiffen-ing frame 22 is therefore in particular sufficient for a good insulating effect, since the stiffening frame 22 is able to bear over a large area on the essentially planar frame carrier 23 and - otherwise than without the provi-<br><br>
GR 96 P 2378	- 9 -<br>
sion of the frame carrier 23 - cannot tilt to the side over the conductor tracks 16 and 17 that project from the surface of the carrier 10, with a local reduction in the adhesive layer thickness.<br>
Provided the abovementioned interruptions in the frame carrier 23 are not too wide, these are closed by the insulating adhesive when the stiffening frame 22 is being bonded onto the frame carrier 23.<br>
The region located inside the stiffening frame 22 is filled with a covering compound 24 protecting the chip 13 and the bonding wires 18 and 20 against mechan-ical damage and optical analyses; this produces a so-called globe top.<br>
The covering compound 24 cannot escape from the internal space enclosed by the stiffening frame 22 and the frame carrier 23, because there are, between the stiffening frame 22 and the frame carrier 23, no openings or in any case no such openings that allow the covering compound 24 to emerge. The stiffening frame 22, the frame carrier 23 and the joint between the latter are essentially leakproof without gaps; any openings which may be present are shaped and/or dimensioned in such a way that they cannot be penetrated, or at most only to a negligible extent, by the covering compound 24. The (electrically insulating) covering compound 24 can therefore not get to conductive structures running outside the stiffening frame 22, such as the conductor tracks 16 and 17, as a result of which sections of the same to be used as contact points cannot, otherwise than hitherto, be impaired in terms of their function.<br>
After its finishing as shown schematically in Figure 3, the chip module is inserted into an appropriate cut-out in a chip card body.<br>
Figure 3 is a very simplified illustration in which in particular the chip module 1 is illustrated only in very schematic form. Moreover, although this is a sectional view, no hatching has been drawn in, for reasons of clarity.<br>
In Figure 3, the chip card body is designated by<br><br>
 - 10 -<br>
the reference symbol 25, and the cut-out provided therein for the insertion of the chip module 1 is designated by the reference symbol 26.<br>
Electrically conductive structures in the form of two at least partially freely located or exposed (antenna connecting) lines 27, which belong or lead to an antenna integrated in the chip card body 25, run through the cut-out 2 6 .<br>
When the chip module 1 is inserted into the cut-out 26 in the chip card body 25, the electrically conductive structures of the chip module 1, that is to say the conductor tracks 16 and 17, come at least partially into a frontal location opposite the electrically conductive structures of the chip card body 25, that is to say opposite the antenna connecting lines 27; the conductor tracks 16 and 17 at the same time come to lie over or - as is shown in Figure 3 - even on the antenna connecting lines 27.<br>
If the chip module is inserted into the cutout 26 in the chip card body 25 as described, then the contact areas 19 of the chip module 1 which are constructed on the contact area side 15 of the carrier 10 automatically come to lie on the outside of the chip card.<br>
The chip module 1 is bonded to the chip card body in the position shown in Figure 3.<br>
The conductor tracks 16 and 17 and the antenna connecting lines 27 are additionally electrically connected to one another by means of a suitable connecting technique. This can be provided, for example, by a solder paste provided at the desired connecting point being heated to the melting temperature by means of a laser, through the carrier 10 from the outside. Provided the conductor tracks 16 and 17 and the antenna connecting lines 27 lie directly on one another, as shown in Figure 3, they are already in contact with one another simply as a result of this, so that an additional connec-tion by soldering or the like can be dispensed with; nevertheless they can, of course, equally well be soldered to one another.<br><br>
The conductor tracks 16 and 17 and/or the contact areas 19, in the event that a separate connection between the conductor tracks 16 and 17 and the antenna connecting lines 27 is intended, are preferably arranged and constructed in such a way that the contact areas 19 do not hamper the heating of the solder paste. In particular, the conductor tracks 16 and 17 and/or the contact areas 19 are arranged in such a way that the sections of the conductor tracks 16 and 17 which are intended to be connected (to be soldered) to the antenna connecting lines 27 come to lie between the connecting points 19, with interspaces; the normally very narrow interspaces between the connecting points (the standard width is 0.2 mm) are preferably designed to be locally wider at the appropriate points.<br>
The chip module 1 according to the invention and described above with respect to its construction is produced as follows:<br>
The starting point is a carrier strip which has neither the bonding holes 21 nor any kind of conductive structures on its surfaces and is preferably provided with the latter whilst still at the carrier strip manufacturer's.<br>
The bonding holes 21 are produced by drilling or stamping.<br>
The conductive structures, put more precisely the conductor tracks 16 and 17 and the contact areas 19, are produced by using an electrically conductive sheet, which can subsequently be applied to the carrier strip. The frame carrier 23 is also produced together with the production of the said conductive structures; the frame carrier 23 is, in the example being considered, likewise a conductive structure, but which is not used as such.<br>
The electrically conductive sheet (a copper sheet in the example being considered), though which or from which the conductor tracks 16 and 17, the contact areas 19 and the frame carrier 23 are formed or produced, is laminated without additional adhesive onto the correspon-ding sides of the carrier strip. The conductive sheet may<br><br>
 	- 12 -<br>
optionally already have the necessary structure or may be appropriately structured only subsequently, that is to say only after being laminated onto the carrier strip.<br>
In the case of subsequent structuring, the sections which are not needed of the conductive sheet are in each case removed chemically, that is to say for example by means of selective etching. The conductive sheet is in this way reduced to the desired geometry. As a result there remain from the conductive sheet on the contact area side 15 the contact areas 19, and on the chip side 14 the conductor tracks 16 and 17 and the frame carrier 23.<br>
The conductor tracks 16 and 17 of chip modules that are adjacent on the carrier strip are, as can be seen from Figure 1, combined to form a continuous conductor track section. This is possible without problems, since the continuous conductor track section is in any case severed when the chip modules are separated (separation of the chip modules out of the carrier strip along the cut lines 11).<br>
Following the application and the optionally necessary structuring of the conductive sheet, this is subjected to finishing by electroplating. In the exemplary embodiment being considered, a nickel layer is firstly applied to the copper layer formed by the conductive sheet, and a gold layer is applied onto this. In the case of the contact areas 19, this takes place at those places where the bonding holes 21 are located, from both sides of the copper layer forming the contact areas. Instead of the Cu-Ni-Au layer structure, an Au-Ni-Cu-Ag layer structure or any other layer structure capable of being bonded can be provided.<br>
All the conductive structures on the carrier strip are produced in exactly the same way. This means, for the conductor tracks 16 and 17 and the frame carrier 23, that these have exactly the same height and exactly the same physical and chemical properties.<br>
The chips 13 are then bonded onto the carrier strip prepared as described, and electrically connected<br><br>
 	- 13 -<br>
by means of bonding to the contact areas 19 and the conductor track sections running inside the frame<br>
carrier.<br>
Subsequently, the stiffening frame 22 is bonded onto the frame carrier 23 by means of an electrically insulating adhesive.<br>
As a result of the provision of a frame carrier in general and its particular configuration in particular, it is possible to produce between the stiffening frame 22 and the frame carrier 23 a joint which is free of gaps all round and leakproof, by means of which the stiffening frame and the frame carrier are reliably electrically insulated from each other; the conductor . tracks 16 and 17 can be short-circuited neither by the stiffening frame 22 nor by the frame carrier 23.<br>
The region enclosed by the stiffening frame 22 is then filled more or less completely with the covering compound 24.<br>
Finally, the chip modules produced in the described way are cut out of the carrier strip and, as shown in Figure 3, inserted into respective chip card bodies 25 and connected to the latter mechancially and, if appropriate, also electrically.<br>
The chip module that has been described above with respect to the construction and the production is a chip module without a chip island, that is to say a chip module in which the chip is placed onto the carrier. However, the invention can in principle also be applied in the case of chip modules having chip islands, that is to say in the case of chip modules in which the chip is inserted into a cut-out provided in the carrier.<br>
The frame carrier 23 can be used not only for the placement of a stiffening frame 22; it can also provide useful services when no stiffening frame is provided. It is possible, inter alia, to dispense with the said stiffening frame 22 if the chip is covered with a covering compound which, such as a moulding compound, a heat-curable covering compound or the like, can be processed without the stiffening frame and itself becomes<br><br>
 -14 -<br>
sufficiently firm (rigid). In this case, the base-like elevation in the form of the previously extensively described frame carrier 23 can serve for the attachment and/or placement of moulds or other aids. The production of the chip covering using the frame carrier 23 is in this case advantageous from two points of view: on the one hand it is possible to prevent the chip covering being produced crookedly and/or in any other way deviating from a predefined desired position and/or desired alignment, and on the other hand it is also possible here (for essentially the same reasons as in the case of the provision of a stiffening frame) to prevent sections of the conductor tracks 16 and 17 which run outside the . actual chip covering becoming covered with covering compound and thus being made unusable for connections to components provided outside the chip module.<br>
It is also not necessary for the conductor tracks<br>
16	and 17 to be conductor tracks for connecting the chip<br>
module to an antenna (coil) provided outside the latter;<br>
the base-like elevation in the form of the frame car<br>
rier 23 and/or the described electrical connection<br>
between the chip module and the chip card body can also<br>
advantageously be used when the conductor tracks 16 and<br>
17	have any arbitrary other function than the one<br>
described above.<br>
Although it is particularly simple and elegant to produce the base-like elevation like the conductor tracks 16 and 17 and the contact areas 19 and together with the latter, this does not represent any restriction. The base-like elevation can in principle be produced independently of the conductor tracks 16 and 17, from any<br>
desired material and in any desired way.<br>
In summary, it can be emphasized that, using the<br>
chip module described, it is possible to produce contactless chip cards in particular, but also chip cards, in a fault-free manner significantly more reliably than hitherto.<br><br>
