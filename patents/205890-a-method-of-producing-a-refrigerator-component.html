COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; Rule 13]<br>
"A METHOD OF PRODUCING A REFRIGERATOR COMPONENT<br>
DAIKIN INDUSTRIES LTD., a corporation of Japan, of Umeda Center Building, 4-12, Nakazaki-nishi 2-chome, Kita-ku, Osaki-shi, Osaka 530-8323, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br><br>
1<br>
The present invention relates to a method of producing a refrigerator component.<br>
This invention relates to a porous part for<br>
refrigerators,  which  is  used  as  a  component  for  a<br>
compressor,  refrigerant  piping,  or  the  like.    This<br>
invention also relates to a refrigerator having a material<br>
(e.g., a porous part) used as a component for a compressor.,<br>
refrigerant piping, or the like.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A sintered part as a porous part is inexpensive. However, because oils such as a processing oil, a form-rolling oil, a cutting oil and so on are used when processing the sintered part, these oils are contained in large quantities in the sintered part after the processing.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
When this sintered part is used, for example, as<br>
a component for a compressor of a refrigerator, repetition<br>
of  operation/stop  Conditions  causes  variations  in  the<br>
pressure in the interior of the compressor.  As a result,<br>
the oils such as the processing oil exude from the sintered<br><br>
part.  Among these oils, rust-preventive oils, which are<br>
liable to deteriorate a refrigerator oil in a refrigerator,<br>
have a problem of easily causing contamination and/or<br>
sludge which are a cause of clogging.  For that reason, it<br>
5   is conceivable to wash the sintered part with a cleaning<br>
device before it is incorporated into the refrigerator as a<br>
component  thereof.   However,  since  this  requires  new<br>
capital .investment, there is a problem in that the cost<br>
increases.     .<br>
10	An object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a porous part which can be used as a component for refrigerators without causing contamination or sludge, and thus can realize a reduction in cost and a long-term reliability, and also provide a method for producing the 15 .   same and a refrigerator.<br>
In order to achieve the above object, a porous<br>
part  for  refrigerators  of  the  present  invention  is<br>
characterized in that a refrigerator oil is contained in<br>
the part.<br>
20	In the present invention, the refrigerator oil is<br>
contained in the porous part. Thus, even if the porous part is used as a component of a compressor and/or piping of a refrigerator, contamination and sludge, which is a cause of oil deterioration and/or clogging, is prevented 25    from'occurring.  A cutting oil, a form-rolling oil and/or a<br><br><br>
processing  oil  is  permitted  to  be  contained  in  the refrigerator oil.<br>
In one embodiment,  at least one of an al.kyl<br>
benzene type oil and an ether type oil is contained.<br>
5	In this embodiment, since the alkyl benzene or<br>
ether type oil, contained in the porous part, has a specific gravity smaller than that of R32 refrigerant, the oil . does not sink in the R32 refrigerant. Therefore, the porous part in this embodiment is suited as a component of 10   a refrigerator in which R32 refrigerant is used.<br>
In a method of producing a porous part  for<br>
refrigerators according to another aspect 'Of the present<br>
invention, a porous part is placed in a vacuum and then<br>
immersed in a refrigerator oil so that the refrigerator oil<br>
15   is' contained in the porous part.<br>
In this method, .placing the porous part in a vacuum allows rust-preventive oil or any other oil which would cause contamination and sludge to discharge from inside of the porous part. After discharging such oils 20 from the porous part, the porous part is immersed in the refrigerator oil. Thereby, the' deterioration-inducing substances are replaced with the refrigerator oil, thus it is possible to produce a porous part which will not bring about contamination or sludge even if used as a component 25   of refrigerators for a long time.<br><br>
A refrigerator according to one embodiment has a material containing a refrigerator oil.<br>
In the refrigerator, a part of a compressor and/or a refrigerant piping, for example, is made of this material. By thus . doing, contamination and sludge, which are cause of oil deterioration and/or clogging, is prevented from occurrence. Cutting oil, form-rolling oil and/or processing oil may be contained in the refrigerator oil.<br>
In another embodiment, the refrigerator uses a refrigerant that contains R32 refrigerant at 40 wt% or more. In this embodiment, because the refrigerant contains R32 at at least 40 wt%, it is possible to achieve an improvement in COP (coefficient of performance) by R32 refrigerant having a high refrigerating capacity.<br>
In one embodiment of the refrigerator, at least one of ether type oil, ester type oil and alkyl benzene type oil is contained in the above material as the refrigerator oil.<br>
Ether type oils and ester type oils have compatibility with HFC type refrigerants, while alkyl . benzene type oils have compatibility with the ether type oils and the ester type oils. These refrigerator oils do not cause contamination or sludge which is a cause of oil deterioration  and/or  clogging.    With  the  refrigerator<br><br>
10<br>
15<br><br>
having a material impregnated with such oil, it is possible to prevent the occurrence of contamination and sludge.<br>
In particular, since the alkyl benzene type oil and the ether: type oil have respective specific gravities smaller than that of R32 refrigerant,, they do,-not sink in R32 refrigerant. Therefore, the alkyl benzene type oil and the ether type oil are suited for the case where R32 refrigerant is used.<br>
In another embodiment, the refrigerator uses at least one porous material as the material impregnated with the refrigerator oil.<br>
In this embodiment, the porous material is adopted as the impregnated material, and thus it is possible to make the impregnation amount of the refrigerator oil large. This can improve a preventive effect of the occurrence of sludge and contamination.<br><br><br><br><br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION (First Embodiment)<br>
This invention will hereinafter be described in further detail by illustrated examples.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, a process for producing a sintered part for refrigerators as an embodiment of this invention will be described.. In this production process, as shown in Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B, a head part 11A in the interior of a compressor, which is a sintered part already subjected to processing and forming after sintering, is placed in a vacuum so that rust-preventive oil that was included in large quantities into the head part 11A during the processing and forming process is extracted from the head part 11A. Then, the head part 11A to be placed in the interior of the compressor is immersed in an alkyl benzene<br>
■i<br>
oil serving as a refrigerator oil, whereby the alkyl benzene oil is contained in the head part 11A. Figs. 2A and 2B show a plan view and a side view, respectively, of a rear head 11A serving as the head part disposed in the interior of the compressor.               <br><br>
As a result, the rust-preventive oil in the: head part 11A., which is a deterioration-inducing substance, is replaced with the alkyl. benzene oil as the refrigerator oil Thus it is possible to produce a head part to be placed 5   inside  a  compressor . that  will  hardly  bring  about contamination or sludge even if used as a component of a refrigerator for a long time.   In particular,  it is possible to prevent clogging of capillaries and expansion valves and oil deterioration in an air conditioner in which 10   an HFC type refrigerant is used, thus making it possible to secure long-term reliability.<br>
Further, since the alkyl benzene type oil as the refrigerator oil contained in the head part 11A in the interior of the compressor has a specific gravity smaller 15 than that of R32 refrigerant, it does not sink in the R32 refrigerant. Accordingly, the head part 11A . is particularly suitable as a component of a refrigerator using the R32 refrigerant.<br>
Although in this embodiment, the rear head 11A, 20 which is a head part in the interior of the compressor, is adopted as one example of components constituting a refrigerator to which the present invention is applied, a front head may also be adopted, and a middle plate 11B of the compressor as shown in Fig. 2C and Fig. 2D may also be 25    adopted.    Furthermore,  the  present  invention  is  also<br><br><br><br>
applicable to components of, for example, a piston and/or<br>
refrigerant piping.   Also, in the 'above embodiment, the<br>
head parts 11A, 11B, which are  sintered parts serving as<br>
porous  parts,  contain  an  alkyl  benzene  type  oil.<br>
5   Alternatively,  they may contain a mixture of an alkyl<br>
benzene type oil and an ether type oil.   Further, only an<br>
ether type oil may be used.  In these cases as well, the<br>
specific gravity of the oil is smaller than that of the R32<br>
refrigerant, thus making it possible to provide sintered<br>
10   parts suited as components of refrigerators.<br>
Besides the alkyl benzene type oils and the ether type "oils, the sintered parts may be impregnated with an ester type oil. Also, the sintered parts may be impregnated with a mixture of an ester' type oil with either 15 an alkyl benzene type oil or ' an ether type oil. Alternatively, the sintered parts may be impregnated with an oil containing benzene, a mixed oil of the oil containing benzene and an ester oil, or a mixed oil of the oil containing benzene and an ether oil. Furthermore, the 20 sintered parts may be impregnated with new punching oil (an isoparaffinic refrigerator oil or an isoparaffinic oil).<br>
In the above embodiment, the rust-preventive oil<br>
entering into the sintered parts when processed is let out<br>
under vacuum.,  Alternatively, the sintered parts may be<br>
25    impregnated  with  the  refrigerator  oil  by  using  the<br><br><br><br>
refrigerator oil in place of the rust-preventive oil during the processing of the sintered parts.  Further, although the porous parts in the above embodiment are sintered parts, the present invention can also be applied to porous parts formed of porous plastics or ceramics.<br>
(Second Embodiment)<br>
Next, a refrigerant circuit of an air conditioner as an embodiment of the refrigerator of .this invention is . shown in Fig. 1. In this air conditioner, an outdoor unit 1 is connected via connecting pipings 3,. 5 to an' indoor unit 2. R32 refrigerant, which ,is slightly inflammable, is used as' a refrigerant for the air conditioner.<br>
In the outdoor unit 1, a valve■6 connected to the connecting piping 5, a four-way selector valve 7, a liquid-gas separator ,8, an accumulator 10, a compressor 11, the four-way selector valve 7, an outdoor heat exchanger 19, a main expansion valve 12 and' a valve 13. are connected in this order via refrigerant piping, and the valve 13 is connected to the connecting piping 3. On the other hand, the indoor unit 2 has a heat exchanger 15 connected to the connecting pipings 3 and 5.<br>
A high-pressure relief valve 18 is connected to refrigerant piping 17 on the side of the expansion valve 12 of the outdoor heat exchanger 19.   This high-pressure<br>
10<br><br><br>
relief valve 18, which is arranged outside the outdoor unit 1, opens when the internal pressure of the refrigerant piping 17 exceeds a predetermined value, and it closes when the internal pressure thereof is. lowered below the 5   predetermined value.<br>
The outdoor unit 1 is provided with a control unit 25 comprising a microcomputer.   Connected to this control unit 25 are a temperature sensor 2 6 detecting the outdoor temperature, a temperature sensor 27 detecting the 10   suction-side  piping  temperature  T3UC and  a  temperature sensor 28 detecting the discharge-side piping temperature Tdi3 are  connected.  ' Further,  a  temperature  sensor  30 detecting the indoor ambient temperature,  a temperature sensor 31 detecting the temperature Tin of the indoor heat 15   exchanger 15 and a temperature sensor 32 detecting the temperature Tout of the outdoor heat exchanger  11  are connected to the control unit- 25.   The control unit 25 having the above constitution controls the output of the compressor 11 and the degree of opening of the expansion 20   valve 12 in response to temperature signals from those temperature sensors.<br>
In this air conditioner,  when heating,  paths<br>
shown by dotted lines are selected by the four-way valve 7<br>
of Fig. 1, so that the indoor heat exchanger 15 serves as a<br>
25    condenser, while the outdoor heat exchanger 19 serves as an<br><br><br><br>
■  evaporator.  As a result, when heating, a line extending from the compressor 11, through the connecting piping 5, the indoor heat exchanger 15,  and then the connecting piping 3, to the expansion, valve 12 becomes a high-pressure 5   line.  On the other hand, when air-cooling, the four-way valve 7 of Fig. 1 selects paths shown by solid lines, so that the .outdoor heat exchanger 19 serves as a condenser, while the indoor heat exchanger 15 serves as an evaporator. As a result, when air-cooling, a line from, the compressor 10   11, through the outdoor heat exchanger 19, to the expansion valve 12 becomes a high-pressure line.<br>
Next, a head part 11A of the compressor 11 is shown in Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B.  This head part 11A is a rear<br>
^■-■■1   ■ Willi ■!»,—M|P<br>
head.   The head part 11A was produced in the following 15   manner.  That is, a head part 11A, which is a sintered part already subjected to. processing or working, and forming after sintering, is placed in a vacuum so that a rust-preventive oil that was included in large quantities into the head part 11A during the. processing and forming process 20    is extracted from the head part 11A.  Then, the head part 11A is immersed in an alkyl benzene type oil serving as a refrigerator  oil,  whereby  the  alkyl  benzene  oil  is contained in the head part 11A.   Figs. 2A and 2B show a plan view and a.side view, respectively, of a rear head 11A 25    serving as the head part.<br>
12<br><br><br>
As a result, the rust-preventive oil in the head<br>
part 11A, which is a deterioration-inducing substance, is<br>
replaced  with  the  alkyl  benzene  type  oil  as  the<br>
refrigerator oil.   Thus the head part will hardly bring<br>
5'   about contamination or sludge even if used as . a component<br>
of a refrigerator for a long time.  In particular, it is<br>
possible to prevent clogging of capillaries and expansion<br>
valves and oil deterioration in an air conditioner in which<br>
an HFC type refrigerant is used, thus making it possible to<br>
10   secure long-term reliability.<br>
Further, since the alkyl benzene type oil as the refrigerator oil contained in the head part 11A of the compressor has a specific gravity smaller than that of the R32 refrigerant, it does not sink in the R32 refrigerant. 15 Accordingly, the head part 11A is particularly suitable as a component of a refrigerator using the R32 refrigerant.<br>
Although in this embodiment, the rear head 11A1, which is one of head parts in the interior of the compressor, is adopted as one example of components 20 constituting a refrigerator to which the present invention is applied, a front head may also be adopted, and a middle plate 11B of the compressor as shown in Fig. 2C and Fig. 2D may be adopted. Furthermore, another component such as a piston or refrigerant piping may also be adopted. Also, in 25    the  above  embodiment,  the head part  11A,  which is  a<br>
13<br><br>
sintered part' serving as a porous part, contains an alkyl benzene type oil.  Alternatively, it may contain a mixture of an alkyl benzene type oil and an ether type oil. Further, only an ether type oil may be used.   In these 5   cases   as well, the specific gravity of the oil is smaller than that of the R32 refrigerant, thus making it possible to provide a sintered part suited as a component of refrigerators using the R32 refrigerant.  Use of the R32 refrigerant achieves a high COP value..   The COP can be 10   improved when using , a  refrigerant  containing the  R32 refrigerant at 40 wt% or more.<br>
Besides the alkyl benzene type oils and -the ether type oils, the sintered parts may be impregnated with an ester . type oil. Also, the sintered parts may be 15 impregnated with a mixed oil of an ester type oil with either an alkyl benzene type oil or an ether type oil. Alternatively, the sintered parts may be impregnated with an oil containing benzene, a mixed oil of the oil containing benzene and an ester oil, or a mixed oil of the 20 oil containing benzene and an ether oil. Furthermore, the sintered parts may be impregnated with new punching oil (an isoparaffinic refrigerator oil or an isoparaffinic oil).<br>
*     In the above embodiment, the rust-preventive oil<br>
. entering into the sintered part when processed is let out<br>
25   under vacuum.   Alternatively,  the sintered part may be<br>
14<br><br><br>
impregnated  with  the  refrigerator  oil  by  using  the<br>
refrigerator oil in place of the rust-preventive oil during<br>
the processing of the sintered part.  Further, although the<br>
porous part in the above embodiment is a sintered part, the<br>
5   porous part may also be formed of porous plastics or<br>
ceramics.  Furthermore, making a material other than porous<br>
materials contain a refrigerator oil and using the material<br>
to constitute a part of a refrigerator also makes it<br>
possible  to  achieve  the  long-term  reliability  while<br>
10   preventing the occurrence  of contamination and sludge,<br>
which is a cause of oil deterioration and clogging.<br><br><br>
