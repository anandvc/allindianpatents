				<td>Compact low-pressure discharge lamp<br>
The invention relates to a compact low-pressure dischcirge lamp comprising a discharge vessel having electrodes and supply leads and having a lamp cap assembled from a cap, housing and mounting plate with a ballast arrangement, the mounting plate with the ballast arrangement being fitted in the interior of the lamp cap housing and having terminals for the electrical connection of the supply leads to the mounting plate.<br>
Known low-pressure discharge lamps are increasingly replacing the incandescent lamp in buildings and residential accommodation. In the known low-pressure discharge lamps, the discharge vessel mostly comprises a singly or multiply bent tube which is arranged in a lamp cap. In this case, a mounting plate constructed as a printed circuit board and on which there is soldered an electronic ballast arrangement is integrated in the lamp cap. Production costs for these compact low-pressure discharge lamps are relatively high, since many complicated manufacturing steps are required in the production. One of these manufacturing steps is the electrical connection between the supply leads of the discharge vessel and the corresponding terminals of the ballast arrangement. In order to produce this connection, the appropriate connecting wires are presently being brought together and, for example, crimped by means of a metal sleeve.<br>
A development of this simple connection is described in EP-A-0 452 743. This printed publication discloses a low-pressure discharge lamp of the type described at the beginning, which has holding pins with the aid of which the ends of the supply leads are aligned perpendicular to the bow-shaped connecting wires of the ballast arrangement. When assembling the lamp cap housing and mounting plate with the lamp cap, the wires which are respectively to make contact are arranged<br>
approximately at a right angle one behind another and pressed against one another resiliently with the aid of the holding pin and the inner wall of the lamp cap housing, with the result that an electrical connection is produced between the electrodes of the discharge vessel of the ballast arrangement.<br>
However, it is disadvantageous in this prior art that such an electric connecting system is very complicated. This increases the production costs. In addition, in order to ensure reliable contacting of the elements, the rate of production for such low-pressure discharge lamps is not very high. The multiplicity of components additionally produces problems of space inside the lamp housing. It is therefore not possible, for example, to reduce the size of the housing.<br>
It is therefore the object of the invention to provide a compact low-pressure discharge lamp of the type mentioned at the beginning in which the structure required for an electrical connection between the supply leads of the discharge vessel and the corresponding terminals of the ballast arrangement can be produced simply, in a space saving fashion, quickly and cost effectively while ensuring optimum contact reliability.<br>
The features of the independent claim serve to achieve this object.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided compact low-pressure discharge lamp comprising a discharge vessel having electrodes and supply leads and having a lamp cap assembled from a cap, housing and mounting plate with a ballast arrangement, the mounting plate with the ballast arrangement being fitted in the interior of the lamp cap housing and having terminals for the electric connection of the supply leads to the mounting plate, characterized in that the supply leads are connected to the electric terminals of the mounting plate via or by means of an electricalry conducting helical or spiral spring in each case.<br>
Advantageous embodiments are described in the subclaims.<br>
In a compact low-pressure discharge lamp according to the invention, the supply leads of a discharge vessel are connected to the electric terminals of a mounting plate with a ballast arrangement via or by means of an electrically conducting helical or spiral spring in each case. The use of a helical or spiral spring which .<br>
on the one hand bears against in each case one supply lead and the corresponding electric terminal of the mounting plate, or on the other hand presses the supply lead  against  the  corresponding  electric  terminal, ensures reliable contact is made. Thus, when assembling the lamp cap housing and mounting plate with the lamp cap,  the respective springs are pressed against the effective spring pressure against both the supply leads and the electric terminals of the mounting plate or the springs press the supply leads directly against the corresponding terminals. According to the invention, only one element is therefore advantageously required to connect the supply leads of the discharge vessel to the corresponding terminals of the mounting plate or of the bcillast. The production costs are thereby reduced substantially. In addition, this advantageously results in a substantial increase in the rate of production, since when assembling the lamp cap of the low-pressure discharge lamp the lamp cap housing and lamp cap need only be pressed against one another. Moreover,  more space is available for possible further components due to the space-saving method of making contact.  It is also advantageously possible to reduce the size of the entire lamp housing.<br>
Before assembling the lamp cap, according to the invention the helical or spiral spring is received in a spring receptacle constructed on the inner circumference of the cap. For this purpose, the spring receptacle has a cavity, formed by a side wall normally of circular construction in cross-section, for receiving at least one part of the spring. As a result, the springs can be mounted independently of the final assembly of the lamp, and this contributes to simplifying the production method and thus lowers the production costs. Moreover, it is thereby ensured that the lamp or the electronics section, that is to say, in particular, the mounting plate with ballast arrangement, can be easily reused. In addition to an<br><br>
advantageous functional testing of the lamp and electronics section which can be carried out separately, it is also possible for these components to be disposed of separately without any problem.<br>
In  a  further  advantageous  embodiment  of  the  low-pressure discharge lamp according to the invention, the side wall has two parallel, opposite slots open towards the free end of the spring receptacle,  for receiving the  supply  lead.  In  this  case,  a  shoulder  is constructed in the cap in the region of the cap-side slot. This serves to support an end of the supply lead. According  to  the  invention,  these  features  also contribute to simplifying the production process. Thus, before the final assembly of the lamp cap with the lamp cap housing, the respective end of the supply leads of the discharge vessel is laid in the open slots of the side wall of the spring receptacle and on the shoulder. If, now,  the spring is placed onto the end of the supply lead, it presses the end of the supply lead into the cavity of the spring receptacle and into a cavity which surrounds the shoulder, the supply lead coming to lie on the shoulder and in the slot of the spring receptacle. Since the other end of the spring is held down by the mounting plate,  a simple and reliable electric contact is  ensured between the helical or spiral spring and the supply lead, on the one hand, and the corresponding electric terminals on the mounting plate.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment of the low-pressure discharge lamp according to the invention, the springs are likewise received by in [sic] corresponding spring receptacles constructed on the inner circumference of the cap. For this purpose, the spring receptacles likewise have a cavity for receiving at least one part of the spring, which cavity is formed by the side wall, which is usually of circular construction  in  cross-section.   However,   in  this<br>
exemplary embodiment the side wall of the spring receptacle is constructed in a lengthened fashion in a subregion in such a way that the end of the subregion projects beyond the mounting plate or through into the region of the ballast arrangement, a slot being formed in the subregion for the purpose of receiving the supply lead. According to the invention, these features also contribute to simplifying the production process of the lamp. Thus, before the final assembly of the lamp cap with the lamp cap housing, the respective end of the supply leads of the discharge vessel is laid and pressed into the open slot in the lengthened subregion of the side wall of the spring receptacle. If the spring is now placed onto the end of the supply lead, it presses the end of the supply lead onto the electric terminal of the mounting plate. The result is that a simple and reliable electrical connection between the supply lead and the corresponding electric terminals on the mounting plate is ensured.<br>
The length of the helical or spiral spring	is,  in<br>
addition, selected so as to ensure a reliable	contact<br>
between the supply lead and the terminal	of the<br>
mounting plate.<br>
The helical or spiral spring usually consists of a metal alloy which is a good conductor. Additional tin-plating of the springs is possible.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment of the subject-matter of the invention, the supply lead and the spring are constructed in one piece. Since this reduces the number of the elements which make the electrical connection, a further simplification of the production process is possible.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment of the low-pressure discharge lamp according to the invention, the mounting  plate  is  fastened  perpendicular  to  the<br>
longitudinal lamp axis in the interior of the housing. In this case, the mounting plate rests on ribs which are  constructed on  the inner circumference  of  the housing and run parallel to the longitudinal lamp axis. The mounting plate is advantageously constructed as a printed   circuit  board,   conductor   tracks   being constructed on the side facing the discharge vessel, and circuit elements of the ballast arrangement being constructed on the side averted from the discharge vessel.  In  this  case,  at  least  one  terminal  is constructed as a soldering eyelet for the purpose of making electric contact between the supply lead and the mounting plate. In a further advantageous embodiment, at  least  one  terminal  comprises  one  or more  flat soldering surfaces and/or solder tag strips for the purpose of making electric contact between the supply lead and the mounting plate.  This simple and space saving structure of the lamp cap ensures that said cap can be kept small overall and can also be produced cost effectively.<br>
Positioning devices are advantageously constructed for positioning the cap and the housing of the lamp cap in the correct position.<br>

Figure 8  shows a diagrammatically represented top view of the lamp cap of the low-pressure discharge lamp according to the invention, in accordance with Figure 5.<br>
Reproduced in Figure 1 is a partially sectioned side view of a compact low-pressure discharge lamp 10 according to the invention. The lamp 10 comprises in this case a discharge vessel 14 and a lamp cap 12, the lamp cap 12 being assembled from a cap 16 and a housing 18. The lamp cap 12 is constructed in this case essentially in the shape of a cylinder. The cap 16 and the housing 18 are detachably interconnected, at least one  positioning  device   (not   represented)   being<br>
constructed for connecting the cap 16 and the housing 18 in the correct position. In this case, in the end facing the housing 18 the cap 16 has an annular bead 2 0 in its outer circumference. The bead 20 engages in this case in a corresponding annular groove 22 in the inner circumference of the housing 18. A secure connection between the two parts is produced by snapping the inner edge of the housing 18 onto the outer edge of the cap 16.<br>
In the interior of the housing 18, which is essentially of cylindrical construction, a mounting plate 24 is fastened perpendicular to the longitudinal lamp axis. The mounting plate 24 is constructed as a printed circuit board, conductor tracks being constructed on the side facing the discharge vessel 14, and circuit elements of the ballast arrangement 32 being constructed on the side averted from the discharge vessel 14. In addition, constructed on the inner circumference of the housing 18 are ribs 58 which run parallel to the longitudinal lamp axis and on whose ends the mounting plate 24 rests.<br>
The discharge vessel 14 normally comprises two or three tube lengths bent in the shape of a U, which are interconnected by a passage, the end limbs respectively supporting electrodes. The free ends of the tube lengths 3 8 or of the bulbs 3 4 are sealed in a gas tight fashion by pinches 3 6 and are seated inside the cap 16 of the lamp cap 12. Supply leads 30 emerge from the discharge vessel 14 in the region of the pinches 36. The supply leads 3 0 are connected to the electric terminals 2 6 of the mounting plate 24 via an electrically conducting helical or spiral spring 2 8 in each case. The spring 2 8 engages in this case in a spring receptacle 40 constructed on the inner circumference of the cap 16, and is fastened detachably therein in the exemplary embodiment shown.<br>
The spring receptacle 40 comprises a side wall 43 which is approximately of circular construction in cross-section and surrounds a cavity 42. The cavity 42 serves to receive a part of the spring 28.<br>
Figure 2 shows a diagrammatically represented, partially sectioned detailed side view of the low-pressure discharge lamp 10. It is to be seen that the helical or spiral spring 28 for the contact closure comes to lie between the supply lead 3 0 and the terminal 26. The supply leads 30 normally comprise two components, specifically Vakuvit and galvanized wire, and hcive a diameter of approximately 0.4 mm. The side wall 43 has two parallel opposite slots 44a, 44b, open towards the free end of the spring receptacle 40, for receiving the supply lead 30. A shoulder 46 is constructed in the cap 16 in the region of the cap-side slot 44b. It serves to support an end 56 of the supply lead 3 0 that is pressed, during assembly of the cap 16 with the housing 18, against the inner circumference of the cap 16 and the cavity constructed there.<br>
In addition, the side wall 43 surrounding the cavity 42 has bevels 45 towards the free end of the spring receptacle 40. These bevels 45 facilitate the insertion of the spring 28 and of the supply lead 30.<br>
It is to be seen, furthermore, that on the side facing the discharge vessel 14 the mounting plate 24 has terminals 2 6 for making electric contact with the supply leads 3 0 of the ballast arrangement 32. The termineils 2 6 can be constructed in this case as a soldering eyelet or else as flat soldering surfaces or solder tag strips integrated into the mounting plate 24.<br>
A top view of the lamp cap 12 of the low-pressure discharge lamp 10 is represented in Figures 3 and 4. It is to be seen that the free end of the housing 18 is<br>
connected to the free end of the cap 16. The spring receptacles 40 are constructed on the inner circumference of the cap 16. The spring receptacle 40 is in this case of essentially circular construction in cross-section.' The parallel position, with the same axis, of the slots 44a and 44b is also well in evidence. In addition, it is made clear that the spring 28 rests on the supply lead 30. The supply lead 30 is guided in the slots 44a and 44b, the end 56 of the supply lead 30 resting on the shoulder 46 and being pressed into a cavity, constructed in the cap 16, against the inner circumference of the cap 16.<br>
Figure 5 shows a diagrammatically represented, partially sectioned side view of a second embodiment of the low-pressure discharge lamp 10. The structure of this lamp 10 corresponds in this case essentially to that of the one described in Figures 1 to 4. In the case of this exemplary embodiment, as well, spring receptacles 40 for receiving and detachably fastening the helical or spiral springs 2 8 are arranged on the inner circumference of the cap 16. The spring receptacles 40 also each have a cavity 42 which is constructed by a side wall 43 of approximately circular construction in cross-section. By contrast with the embodiment first described, the helical or spiral springs 28 here press the supply leads 3 0 directly against the corresponding electric terminals 2 6 of the mounting plate 24.<br>
The detailed representations in accordance with Figures 6 and 7 show that the side wall 43 of the spring receptacle 40 is constructed in a lengthened fashion in a subregion 5 0 in such a way that the end of the subregion 50 of the side wall 43 projects beyond the mounting plate 24 or through into the region of the ballast arrangement 32, a slot 51 being formed in the subregion 50 for the purpose of receiving the supply lead 30. When assembling the lamp cap 16 with the lamp<br>
cap housing 18, the respective end of the supply leads 3 0 of the discharge vessel 14 is laid and pressed into the open slot 51 of the lengthened subregion 50 of the side wall 43 of the spring receptacle 40. The spring 28 then presses the end of the supply lead 30 onto the electric terminal 26 of the mounting plate 24. The terminals 26 can here also be constructed as a soldering eyelet or else as flat soldering surfaces and/or solder tag strips integrated into the mounting plate 24. The insertion of the supply lead 30 into the slot 51 is facilitated by corresponding bevels 45 of the side wall 50 on the free end of the spring receptacle 40. Furthermore, it is to be seen that a gap 48 is constructed between the inner circumference of the housing 18 and the spring receptacle 40. The gap 48 serves to receive the end 56 of the supply lead 30.<br>
Figure 8 represents a top view of the lamp cap 12 of the low-pressure discharge lamp 10. It is to be seen that the free end of the housing 18 is connected to the free end of the cap 16. The spring receptacles 40 are constructed on the inner circumference of the cap 16. The spring receptacles 40 are in this case of essentially circular construction in cross-section. It becomes clear, in addition, that the supply leads 3 0 in each case rest on the free ends of the spring receptcicles 40. The supply lead 3 0 is guided in the slot 51, the end 56 of the supply lead 3 0 coming to lie in the gap 48.<br>
The springs 28 used consist predominantly of a metal alloy which is a good conductor. In addition, the spring 28 can be at least partly tin-plated and/or galvanized. The lead of the helical or spiral spring 28 is smaller than the diameter of the spring.<br>
In a further exemplary embodiment (not represented), it is provided that the supply lead 3 0 and the spring 28 are constructed in one piece.<br><br><br><br><br>
