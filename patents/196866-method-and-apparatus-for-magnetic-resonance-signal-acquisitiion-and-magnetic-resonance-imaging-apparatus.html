				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for magnetic resonance signal acquisition and a magnetic resonance imaging apparatus, and more particularly' relates to a method and apparatus for magnetic resonance signal acquisition for magnetic resonance imaging based on a phase contrast method and a magnetic resonance imaging apparatus for magnetic resonance imaging based on the phase contrast method.<br>
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) apparatus generates a magnetic resonance signal by applying a gradient magnetic field and a high frequency magnetic field wherein in the magnetic resonance imaging apparatus an imaging target has been placed in the internal space of a magnet system, namely the space where a static magnetic field is formed, and forms (restructures) a tomographic image based on the received signal.<br>
The phase contract method has been known as one of the method for imaging the flow of blood or the like in an organism.    In this method, the gradient magnetic field that does not change the phase of the spin the position of which is not changed during imaging, and the gradient magnetic field that changes the phase of only the spin the position of which is changed during imaging is used.    Such a gradient magnetic field is called flow encode gradient magnetic field.<br>
The flow encode gradient magnetic field is the method in which two magnetic fields having inverse gradients are applied for an equal time successively. By applying such a gradient magnetic field, the phase of the spin of no positional<br>
change changes in one direction in the first half time of the gradient magnetic field application period and changes in the inverse direction in the second half time by the same magnitude.    The phase of the spin of no positional change does not change after all.    On the other hand, the phase of the spin of positional change along the gradient of the magnetic field changes in one direction in the first half time of the gradient magnetic field application period but changes in the second half time by the different magnitude because the intensity of the magnetic field is different between first half and second half due to the positional change.    The phase of the spin of positional change does not return to the original phase and causes the change from the original phase.<br>
In the case that the flow contrast method is applied, two gradient magnetic fields that allow the spin of positional change to cause inverse phase changes at different timings are used as a pair of flow encode gradient magnetic field.    The difference between the magnetic resonance signal obtained under the one flow encode gradient magnetic field and the magnetic resonance signal obtained under the other flow encode gradient magnetic field is calculated in order to offset the magnetic resonance signal of the spin of no positional change, and only the magnetic resonance signal of the moving spin remains there.    By restructuring of an image based on the abovementioned magnetic resonance signal, an image of the moving spin, namely for example an image of a blood flow image, can be obtained.<br>
However to say strictly, the phase of the no positional spin causes the change<br>
due to Maxwell term arising from the flow encode gradient magnetic filed.    Because<br>
the phase change due to the one flow encode gradient magnetic field of the pair is<br>
generally different from the phase change due to the other flow encode gradient<br>
magnetic field of the pair, and the phase change signal of the spin of no positional<br>
change remains residual in the difference of the magnetic resonance signal.<br>
Therefore, the flow image includes an image of a static portion as a residual image. The lower static magnetic field gives the larger Maxwell term, and the residual image is more remarkable on the flow imaging in the lower magnetic field application.<br>

The present apparatus is provided with a magnet system 100 as shown in FIG 1.    The magnet system 100 has a main magnetic field coil unit (coil) 102, a gradient coil unit 106, and an RF (radio frequency) coil 108.    These coils are all approximately cylinder-shaped, and located coaxially.    An imaging target 300 that has been placed on a cradle 500 is carried in to or out from the approximately cylindrical internal bore of the magnet system 100 by means of a earner not shown in the drawing.<br>
The main magnetic field coil unit 102 forms a static magnetic field in the internal bore of the magnet system 100.    The direction of the static magnetic field is approximately parallel to the direction of the body axis of the target 300.    In other words, the main magnetic field coil unit 102 forms a so-called horizontal magnetic field.    The main magnetic coil unit 102 is formed of, for example, a superconducting magnet coil.    As a matter of course, a resistive type conducting magnet may be used instead of the superconducting magnet coil.<br>
The gradient coil unit 106 generates a gradient magnetic field to incline the static magnetic field.    The generated gradient magnetic field includes three gradient magnetic fields, namely a slice gradient magnetic field, a phase encode gradient magnetic field, and a readout gradient magnetic field.    The gradient coil unit 106 has three series of gradient coil units not shown in the drawing corresponding to respective three gradient magnetic fields.    The gradient magnetic field is simply referred to as the gradient depending on the case hereinafter.<br>
 The three magnetic fields of three types give the gradient to the static magnetic field intensity in the three directions perpendicular each other respectively. This direction is referred to as the direction of the gradient in the present invention. A flow encode gradient magnetic field that will be described hereinafter is a magnetic field having the gradient in three directions, two directions of the three, or one direction of the three.<br>
The RF coil unit 108 forms a high frequency magnetic field that excites the spin in a body of a target 300 in the static magnetic field bore.    Forming of a high frequency magnetic field is referred to as transmission of RF exciting signal depending on the case.    The RF coil unit 108 receives a magnetic resonance signal, namely the radio wave arising from the excited spin.<br>

The direction of the static magnetic field is approximately orthogonal to the body axis direction of the target 300.    In other words, the main magnetic field magnet unit 102' forms a so-called perpendicular magnetic field.    The main magnetic field magnet unit 102' comprises, for example, a permanent magnet.    As a matter of course, a resistive type conducting magnet may be used instead of the superconducting magnet coil.<br>
The gradient coil unit 106' generates a gradient magnetic field to incline the static magnetic field.    The generated gradient magnetic field includes three gradient magnetic fields, namely a slice gradient magnetic field, a phase encode gradient magnetic field, and a readout gradient magnetic field.    The gradient coil unit 106' has three series of gradient coil units not shown in the drawing corresponding to respective three gradient magnetic fields.

driving unit 140, data collection unit 150, and control unit 160 is one embodiment of a<br>
magnetic resonance signal acquisition apparatus of the present invention.    The structure of the present apparatus shows one exemplary embodiment in accordance with the apparatus of the present invention.    The operation of the present apparatus shows one exemplary embodiment in accordance with the method of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 3 shows an example of a pulse sequence used for magnetic resonance imaging.    The pulse sequence is a pulse sequence based on the phase contrast method.    In FIG. 3, the abscissa represents the time and the ordinate represents the signal intensity.    In FIG. 3, a pulse sequence is divided into five time periods from Tl to T5 along the ordinate for convenience.<br>
(1) in FIG. 3 shows sequences of an RF signal, and shows the sequence of a degree pulse, namely RF excitation signal, and a gradient echo.    (2), (3), and (4) shows sequences of a slice gradient Gs, a phase encode gradient Gp, and a readout gradient Gr.<br>
The sequence of the slice gradient Gs has a signal waveform that is served to generate the gradient for slice selection in the time period Tl, and has a signal waveform that is served to generate the gradient for rephasing of the spin phase in the time period T2.    The signal waveform is, for example, a trapezoid waveform.<br>
The sequence of the slice gradient Gs has a signal waveform that is served to generate the flow encode gradient in the time period T4.    For example, a triangle waveform, in which an integral value is 0, is used as the signal waveform.    However, the signal waveform is by no means limited to the triangle wave, and any wave in which the integral value in a time period is 0 such as a sawtooth wave, a rectangular wave, a trapezoidal wave, or a sine wave may be used as the signal waveform.<br>
By using a signal having the waveform as described hereinabove, the flow encode gradient containing the first half and the second half having the same gradient<br>
absolute value in which the direction of the first half gradient is opposite to the direction of the second half in a time period is formed.<br>
When the flow encode gradient as described hereinabove is used, the'phase of a spin that moves along the direction of the slice gradient Gs deviates from the original phase with the positional change because magnetic fields having different intensities between the first half and the second half of a gradient application time period act in the opposite direction.      In other words, flow encode of a spin is performed.    The flow encode is served as the flow encode of the slice gradient direction component of the travel distance of the spin.<br>
The sequence of the phase encode gradient Gp has the signal waveform that is served to generate the gradient for phase encoding of the spin in the time period T3. The signal waveform is, for example, a trapezoidal waveform.    The amplitude of the trapezoidal waveform is changed periodically.    The amplitude change is shown with a broken line.<br>
The sequence of the phase encode gradient Gp has signal waveforms that are served to generate the flow encode gradient in the time periods T2 and T4.    The signal waveform in the time period T2 is the first half of the triangle wave and the signal waveform in the time period T4 is the second half of the triangle wherein the integral value of the signal waveforms in T2 and T4 is 0.    As a matter of course, the waveform is by no means limited to the triangle wave.<br>
When the waveform as described hereinabove is used, the phase of a spin that moves along the direction of the phase encode gradient Gp deviates from the original phase with the positional change because magnetic fields having different intensities between the first half and the second half of a gradient application time period act in the opposite direction.    In other words, flow encode is performed.    The flow encode is served as the flow encode of the phase encode gradient direction<br>
component of the travel distance of the spin<br>
The sequence of the readout gradient Gr has a waveform that is served to generate the gradient for dephasing the spin in the time period T4, and has a signal waveform that is served to generate the gradient for generating the gradient echo by rephasing and dephasing the spin in the time period T5     The signal waveform is, for example, a trapezoidal waveform<br>
The sequence of the readout gradient Gr has a signal waveform that is served to generate a flow encode gradient in the time period T2     For example, the triangle wave, in which the integral value in the time period is 0, is used as the signal waveform     As a matter of course, the waveform is by no means limited to the triangle wave<br>
When the waveform as described hereinabove is used, the phase of a spin that moves along the direction of the readout gradient Gr deviates from the original phase with the positional change because magnetic fields having different intensities between the first half and the second half of a gradient application time period act in the opposite direction.    In other words, flow encode is performed     The flow encode is served as the flow encode of the readout gradient direction component of the travel distance of the spin<br>
The magnetic resonance imaging that involves the pulse sequence as described hereinbefore is performed as described hereinafter    At first, the slice gradient Gs is applied in the time period Tl, a degree pulse is applied in the application time period to select and excite a spin, and the flip angle of the spin is a degrees     a degree is equal to or lower than 90 degrees<br>
Next, the spin is rephased in the time period T2 by means of the slice gradient Gs     In this time period, the travel distance of the spin in the phase encode gradient direction is subjected to the first half portion of the flow encode by means of<br>
the first half of the flow encode gradient that is added to the sequence of the phase encode gradient Gp.    Furthermore, the travel distance of the spin in the readout gradient direction is subjected to flow encode by means of the flow encode gradient that is added to the sequence of the readout gradient Gr.<br>
Next, the spin is subjected to phase encode by means of the phase encode gradient Gp in the time period T3.<br>
Next, the spin is subjected to spin dephasing by means of the readout gradient Gr in the time period T4.    At that time, the travel distance of the spin in the phase encode gradient direction is subjected to the second half portion of the flow encode by means of the second half of the flow encode gradient that is added to the sequence of the phase encode gradient Gp.    Furthermore, the travel distance of the spin in the slice gradient direction is subjected to flow encode by means of the flow encode gradient that is added to the sequence of the slice gradient Gs.<br>
Next, in the time period T5, the spin is rephased by means of the readout gradient Gr and is dephased subsequently, and a gradient echo is generated.    The signal intensity of the gradient echo attains to the maximum value at the time point after the echo time from the a degree excitation.    The gradient echo is collected by the data collection unit 150 as the view data.<br>
The pulse sequence is repeated with a repetition time TR.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a pulse sequence in the next repetition time.    The pulse sequence shown in FIG. 4 is the same as that shown in FIG 3 excepting the signal waveform of the flow encode gradient in the time period T2 that is added to the sequence of the readout gradient Gr.    The amplitude of the phase encode gradient Gp is also the same as that shown in FIG. 3.<br>
The phase of the signal waveform of the flow encode gradient in the time period T2 that is added to the sequence of the readout gradient Gr is inverse to that<br>
shown in FIG. 3.    As the result, the phase of the spin having the travel component in the readout gradient direction is changed in the reverse direction to the direction that is shown in FIG. 3.    In other words, the reverse polar flow encode is performed.<br>
The gradient echo to which such flow encode is added is collected as the view data.    The same phase encode gradient Gp that is used for both cases results in the same phase encode, and the data shows the same view as that shown in FIG. 3 excepting that the flow encode to the flow in the readout gradient direction is reverse in the polarity.<br>
FIG. 5 shows a pulse sequence in the next repetition time.    The pulse sequence shown in FIG. 5 is the same as that shown in FIG. 3 excepting the signal waveform of the flow encode gradient in the time periods T2 and T4 that is added to the sequence of the phase encode gradient Gp.    The amplitude of the phase encode gradient Gp is also the same as that shown in FIG. 3.<br>
The phase of the signal waveform of the flow encode in the time periods T2 and T4 that is added to the sequence of the phase encode gradient Gp is reverse to the phase shown in FIG. 3.    As the result, the spin having the travel component in the phase encode gradient direction is subjected to flow encode in the polarity that is reverse to the polarity shown in FIG. 3.<br>
The gradient echo to which such flow encode is added is collected as the view data.    The same phase encode gradient Gp results in the data of the same view as that obtained in FIG. 3.    However, the flow encode to the flow in the phase encode gradient direction is reverse in the polarity.<br>
FIG. 6 shows the pulse sequence in the next repetition time.    The pulse sequence in FIG. 6 is the same as that shown in FIG. 3 excepting the signal waveform of the flow encode in the time period 4 that is added to the sequence of the slice gradient Gs.    Furthermore, the amplitude of the phase encode gradient Gp is the<br>
same as that shown in FIG 3<br>
The phase of the signal waveform of the flow encode gradient in the time period T4 that is added to the sequence of the slice gradient Gs is reverse to that shown in FIG 3     As the result, the spin having the travel component in the slice gradient direction is subjected to flow encode in the polarity that is reverse to the polarity in the case of FIG 3<br>
The gradient echo to which such flow encode is added is collected as the view data    The same phase encode gradient Gp used herein results in the data of the same view as obtained in the case of FIG 3     However, the flow encode to the flow in the slice gradient direction is reverse in the polarity<br>
The spin that travels in three gradient directions perpendicular to each other is subjected to flow encode in both positive and negative polanty    The relation between the pulse sequence of respective figures and the flow encode polanty in the respective gradient directions is shown in FIG 7     + represents the positive polanty and - represents the negative polanty in FIG 7<br>
The flow encode gradient for flow encode in both positive and negative polanty forms a pair    In detail, the flow encode gradient in the time penod T2 that is added to the sequence of the readout gradient Gr shown in FIG 3 forms a pair with the flow encode gradient in the time period T2 that is added to the sequence of the readout gradient Gr shown in FIG 4<br>
Similarly, the flow encode gradient in the time penods T2 and T4 that is added to the sequence of the phase encode gradient Gp shown in FIG 3 forms another pair with the flow encode gradient in the time penods T2 and T4 that is added to the sequence of the phase encode gradient Gp shown in FIG 5<br>
Further similarly, the flow encode gradient in the time period T4 that is added to the sequence of the slice gradient Gs shown in FIG 3 forms another pair with the<br>
flow encode gradient in the time period T4 that is added to the sequence of the slice gradient Gs shown in FIG 6<br>
The data processing unit 170 calculates the difference between the gradient echo obtained from the pulse sequence shown in FIG 3 and the gradient echo obtained from the pulse sequence shown in FIG 4     As the result of the calculation of the difference, only the signal that is subjected to the flow encode reversely to each other, namely only the signal that involves the spin having the travel component in the readout gradient direction, remains residual, and others are offset     As the result, one view magnetic resonance signal that involves the spin having the travel component in the readout gradient direction is obtained<br>
Furthermore, the data processing unit 170 calculates the difference between the gradient echo obtained from the pulse sequence shown in FIG 3 and the gradient echo obtained from the pulse sequence shown in FIG 5     As the result of the calculation of the difference, only the signal that is subjected to the flow encode reversely to each other, namely only the signal that involves the spin having the travel component in the phase encode gradient direction, remains residual, and others are offset     As the result, one view magnetic resonance signal that involves the spin having the travel component in the phase encode gradient direction<br>
Furthermore, the data processing unit 170 calculates the difference between the gradient echo obtained from the pulse sequence shown in FIG 3 and the gradient echo obtained from the pulse sequence shown in FIG 6     As the result of the calculation of the difference, only the signal that is subjected to flow encode reversely to each other, namely only the signal that involves the spin having the travel component in the slice gradient direction, remains residual, and others are offset     As the result, one view magnetic resonance signal that involves the spin having the travel component in the slice gradient direction is obtained<br>
The phase of the gradient echo caused from the spin of no positional change also changes based on Maxwell term by means of the flow encode gradient.    The phase change occurs depending on the one and the other of the flow encode gradient pair.    The phase change difference is given by the following equation that includes Maxwell term.  (1) (Equation Removed)<br>
Wherein x, y, and z are the coordinate of the three-dimensional rectangular coordinate system in the static magnetic field bore,    z is assigned to the static magnetic field.    The original point of the coordinate is located at the center of the static magnetic field bore, namely the magnet center.<br>
In the equation (1), A, B, C, and D denote coefficients and are given by the respective following equations.  (Equation Removed) (2)  (Equation Removed)  (3)<br>
(Equation Removed)  (4) (Equation Removed) (5)<br>
Wherein;<br>
y denotes the magnetic rotation ratio,<br>
BO denotes the static magnetic field intensity,<br>
Gx(t) denotes the gradient magnetic field in x-direction,<br>
Gy(t) denotes the gradient magnetic field in y-direction, and<br>
Gz(t) denotes the gradient magnetic field in z-direction.<br>
The suffixes fel and fe2 in the equations (2) to (5) denote the one and the other of the flow encode gradient pair.    Therefore, Gx(t), Gy(t), and Gz(t) to which the suffix fel is added denote the one of the respective flow encode gradient pairs in x-direction, y-direction, and z-direction, Gx(t), Gy(t), and Gz(t) to which the suffix fe2 is added denote the other of the respective flow encode gradient pairs in x-direction, y-direction, and z-direction:<br>
The one of the flow encode gradient pair is referred to as first time flow encode gradient, and the other of the flow encode gradient is referred to as second time flow encode gradient.<br>
For example, on the assumption that the direction of the slice gradient Gs is assigned to z-direction, the direction of the phase encode gradient Gp is assigned to y-direction, and the direction of the readout gradient Gr is assigned to x-direction, Gz(t), Gy(t), and Gx(t) correspond to Gs, Gp, and Gr respectively.<br>
The direction of the slice gradient Gs is by no means limited to z-direction, and may be any one of x, y, z-directions.    Furthermore, the direction of the phase encode gradient Gp may be any one of residual two directions, and the direction of the readout gradient may be the residual one direction.<br>
Furthermore, the oblique gradient in which the direction of Gs, Gp, and Gr is inclined in x, y, and z-directions respectively may be employed.    In this case, Gz(t),<br>
.Gy(t), and Gx(t) are represented by means of vector synthesis of Gs, Gp, and Gr. An example in which Gz(t), Gy(t) and Gx(t) are correlated to Gs, Gp, and Gr respectively is described hereinafter, however, this is true in other cases as well.<br>
When Gs, Gp, and Gr change as shown in FIG. 3 to FIG. 6, the coefficients A, B, C, and D become 0 or a small value as described hereinafter.    As the result, the value of the equation (1) is a small value.<br>
At first the coefficient A will be described.    The left half term in {} of the equation (2) represents the sum of squares of the gradient Gx(t) in x-direction and the gradient Gy(t) in y-direction in the first time flow encode.    The first time flow encode is performed according to the pulse sequence shown in FIG. 3.    Therefore, the square of Gx(t) is equivalent to the square of the triangle wave signal of Gr in the time period T2, and the square of Gy(t) is equivalent to the square of the triangle wave signal of Gp in the time periods T2 and T4.<br>
Furthermore, the right half term in {} represents the sum of squares of the gradient Gx(t) in x-direction and the gradient Gy(t) in y-direction in the second time flow encode.    The second time flow encode is performed according to the pulse sequences shown in FIG. 4 and FIG 5 respectively.    Therefore, the square of Gx(t) is equivalent to the square of the triangle wave signal of Gr in the time period T2 shown in FIG. 4, and the square of Gy(t) is equivalent to the square of the triangle wave signal of Gp in the time periods T2 and T4 shown in FIG 5.<br>
Because only the difference between the first time and the second time of Gr involves the difference in the positive/negative phase, the first time is equalized to the second time by squaring. As the result, the difference between the left half term and the right half term in {} is 0, and the coefficient A is 0.<br>
Next, the coefficient B will be described.    The left half term in {} of the equation (3) represents the square of the gradient Gz(t) in z-direction in the first time<br>
flow encode.    Because the first time flow encode is performed according to the pulse sequence shown in FIG. 3, the square of Gz(t) is equivalent to the square of the triangle wave signal of Gs in the time period T4.<br>
Furthermore, the right half term in {} represents the square of the gradient Gz(t) in z-direction in the second time flow encode.    Because the second time flow encode is performed according to the pulse sequence shown in FIG. 6, the square of Gz(t) is equivalent to the square of the triangle wave signal of Gs in the time period T4 in FIG. 6.<br>
Only the difference between the first time and the second time of Gs involves the difference in the positive/negative phase, and the first time is equalized to the second time by squaring.    Therefore, the difference between the left half term and the right half term in {} is 0, and the coefficient B is resultantly 0.<br>
Next, the coefficient C will be described.    The left half term in {} of the equation (4) represents the product of the gradient Gx(t) in x-direction and the gradient Gz(t) in z-direction in the first time flow encode.    Because the first time flow encode is performed according to the pulse sequence shown in FIG 3, the product of Gx(t) and Gz(t) is equivalent to the product of the trapezoidal wave signal of Gs and the triangle wave signal of Gr in the time period T2 and is equivalent to the product of the triangle wave signal of Gs and the trapezoidal wave signal of Gr in the time period T4.<br>
Furthermore, the left half term in {} represents the product of the gradient Gx(t) in x-direction and the gradient Gz(t) in z-direction in the second time flow encode.    Because the second time flow encode is performed according to the pulse sequences shown in FIG 4 and FIG 6, the product of Gx(t) and Gz(t) is equivalent to the product of the trapezoidal wave signal of Gs and the triangle wave signal of Gr in the time period T2 in FIG. 4 and the product of the triangle wave signal Gs and the<br>
trapezoidal wave signal of Gr in the time period T4     Furthermore, in FIG 6, the product of Gs and Gr is equivalent to the product of the trapezoidal wave signal of Gs and the triangle wave signal of Gr in the time period T2 and the product of the triangle wave signal of Gs and the trapezoidal wave signal Gr in the time period T4<br>
Because Gr is given in the form of the triangle wave signal having the average value of 0 in the time period T2, the product of Gr and Gs given in the form of the trapezoidal wave signal gives the average value of 0 in the time penod T2 Furthermore, because Gs is given in the form of the triangle wave signal having the average value of 0 in the time period T4, the product of Gs and Gr given in the form of the trapezoidal wave signal gives the average value of 0 in the time penod T4 That is true for the first time and the second time as well     Therefore, the coefficient C that is given in the form of the integration of the values in {} is 0<br>
Next, the coefficient D will be descnbed    The left half term in {} of the equation (5) represents the product of the gradient Gy(t) in y-direction and the gradient Gz(t) in z-direction in the first time flow encode     Because the flow time flow encode is performed according to the pulse sequence shown in FIG 3, the product of Gy(t) and Gz(t) is equivalent to the product of the first half portion of the triangle wave signal of Gp and the trapezoidal wave signal of Gs in the time penod T2, and the product of the second half portion of the triangle wave signal of Gp and the triangle wave signal of GS in the time penod T4<br>
Furthermore, the left half in {} represents the product of the gradient Gy(t) in y-direction and the gradient Gz(t) m z-direction in the second time flow encode Because the second time flow encode is performed according to the pulse sequences shown in FIG 5 and FIG 6, the product of Gy(t) and Gz(t) is equivalent to the product of the first half portion of the triangle wave signal of Gp and the trapezoidal wave signal of Gs in the time period T2, and the product of the second half portion of the<br>
triangle wave signal of Gp and the triangle wave signal of Gs in the time period T4 in FIG 5     Furthermore, in FIG 6, the product of Gp and Gs is equivalent to the product of the first half portion of the triangle wave signal of Gp and the trapezoidal wave signal of Gs in the time period T2, and the product of the second half portion of the triangle wave signal of Gp and the triangle wave signal of Gs in the time period T4<br>
Because Gs is given in the form of the triangle wave signal having the average value of 0 in the time period T4, the product of Gs and Gp that is given in the form of a half of the triangle wave signal gives the average value of 0 in the time period T4     That is true for the first time and the second time as well     Therefore, the integration gives 0, and the coefficient D is not affected<br>
On the other hand, because Gp that forms the first half portion of the triangle wave signal is opposite in the sign between the first time and the second time in the time period T2, the product of Gp and Gs that is the trapezoidal wave is opposite in the sign between the first time and the second time, the value in {} is not 0, and the coefficient D is not 0 resultantly.<br>
However, because one repetition time signal of Gp is applied over the first half and second half, the signal intensity of half is sufficient to realize the same flow encode magnitude as that in different directions.    As the result, the value of the coefficient D is a small value.<br>
Three coefficients are 0 and the residual one coefficient has a small value out<br>
of four coefficients A, B, C, and D, and the phase represented by the equation (1) has<br>
a small value resultantly    The fact that the value is small means that the phase<br>
change of the gradient echo obtained from the static portion is approximately equal<br>
between the first time flow encode and the second time flow encode, and the phase<br>
change can be offset substantially by calculating the difference     In other words, the<br>
signal that causes residue can be removed substantially<br>
, The same data collection operation as described hereinbefore is repeated, for example, 64 to 512 times with changing the phase encode gradient Gp successively with application of the pulse sequence that includes the pulse sequences shown in FIG. 3 to FIG. 6 as one set.    Three sets of view data of 64 to 512 views that fill the k-space are obtained by doing the abovementioned operation.<br>
The data processing unit 170 restructures the respective images based on three set view data to obtain three tomographic images.    These tomographic images show the spin flow component in three directions that are perpendicular to each other. The data processing unit 170 extracts the square root of the sum of squares from three images for each same pixel, and structures an image of the pixel value having the values.    The image is a flow image that represents equally the spin flow in the slice plane regardless of the direction.<br>
The flow encode is performed in three directions as described hereinabove, however, the flow encode may be performed in arbitrary two directions instead.<br>
In other words, the flow encode is performed in the direction of the readout gradient Gr and performed in the direction of the phase encode gradient Gp like the pulse sequence shown in FIG. 8.    The pulse sequence shown in FIG. 8 is equivalent to the pulse sequence that is formed by removing the flow encode of Gs from the pulse sequence shown in FIG 3.<br>
Assuming that this flow encode is the first time flow encode, the second time flow encode in Gr direction is performed according to the pulse sequence shown in FIG. 9.    The pulse sequence shown in FIG. 9 is equivalent to the pulse sequence that is formed by removing the flow encode of Gs from the pulse sequence shown in FIG.<br>
A<br>
The second time flow encode in Gp direction is performed according to the pulse sequence shown in FIG. 10.    The pulse sequence shown in FIG. 10 is<br>
equivalent to the pulse sequence that is formed by removing the flow encode of Gs from the pulse sequence shown in FIG 5<br>
The difference between the gradient echo obtained from the pulse sequence shown in FIG 8 and the gradient echo obtained from the pulse sequence shown in FIG<br>
9	is calculated to obtain the magnetic resonance signal that represents the flow in Gr<br>
direction<br>
The difference between the gradient echo obtained from the pulse sequence shown in FIG 8 and the gradient echo obtained from the pulse sequence shown in FIG<br>
10	is calculated to obtain the magnetic resonance signal that represents the flow in Gp<br>
direction<br>
The respective pulse sequences shown in FIG. 8, FIG 9, and FIG. 10 are treated as one set.    Two view data groups including 64 to 512 views that are different in the phase encode magnitude are collected, respective images are restructured from these view data groups, and an image is structured that represents the flow in two-dimensional space including Gr direction and Gp direction by use of the square root extraction value of the sum of squares of the pixel value of the both images.<br>
The pulse sequences shown in FIG 11, FIG. 12, and FIG. 13 are used to obtain the image that represents the flow in two-dimensional space including Gp direction and Gs direction.<br>
The pulse sequence shown in FIG. 11 is equivalent to the pulse sequence that is formed by removing the flow encode of Gr direction from the pulse sequence shown in FIG. 3.    This pulse sequence is the pulse sequence of the first time flow encode.    The pulse sequence shown in FIG. 12 is equivalent to the pulse sequence that is formed by removing the flow encode of Gr direction from the pulse sequence shown in FIG. 5.    This pulse sequence is the pulse sequence of the second time flow encode of the Gp direction     The pulse sequence shown in FIG 13 is equivalent to<br>
the pulse sequence that is formed by removing the flow encode of Gr direction from the pulse sequence shown in FIG. 6.    This pulse sequence is the pulse sequence of the second time flow encode of Gs direction.<br>
The pulse sequences shown in FIG. 14, FIG. 15, and FIG. 16 are used as one set to obtain the image that represents the flow in two-dimensional space including Gr direction and Gs direction.<br>
The pulse sequence shown in FIG. 14 is equivalent to the pulse sequence that is formed by removing the flow encode of Gp direction from the pulse sequence shown in FIG. 3.    This pulse sequence is the pulse sequence of the first time flow encode.    The pulse sequence shown in FIG. 15 is equivalent to the pulse sequence that is formed by removing the flow encode of Gp direction from the pulse sequence shown in FIG. 4.    This pulse sequence is the pulse sequence of the second time flow encode of Gr direction.    The pulse sequence shown in 16 is equivalent to the pulse sequence that is formed by removing the flow encode of Gp direction from the pulse sequence shown in FIG. 6.    This pulse sequence is the pulse sequence of the second time flow encode of Gs direction.<br>
The flow encode is performed in any one direction of Gr, Gp, and Gs to obtain the one-dimensional flow image.<br>
In detail, the flow encode is performed only in the readout gradient Gr direction as shown in FIG 17.    The pulse sequence shown in FIG. 17 is equivalent to the pulse sequence that is formed by removing the flow encode according to Gp from the pulse sequence shown in FIG. 8.<br>
Assuming that this is the first time flow encode, then the second time flow encode of Gr direction is performed according to the pulse sequence shown in FIG. 18. The pulse sequence shown in FIG. 18 is equivalent to the pulse sequence that is formed by removing the flow encode according to Gp from the pulse sequence shown<br>
in FIG. 9.<br>
The difference between the gradient echo obtained from the pulse sequence shown in FIG. 17 and the gradient echo obtained from the pulse sequence shown in FIG. 18 is calculated to obtain the magnetic resonance signal that represents the flow in Gr direction.<br>
The pulse sequences shown in FIG. 17 and FIG. 18 are used as one set.    The view data including 64 to 512 views that are different in the phase encode magnitude is collected, an image is restructured based on the view data, and an image that represents the flow in Gr direction is obtained.<br>
The pulse sequences shown in FIG. 19 and FIG. 20 are used as one set to obtain an image that represents the flow in Gp direction.    The pulse sequence shown in FIG. 19 is equivalent to the pulse sequence that is formed by removing the flow encode of Gr direction from the pulse sequence shown in FIG. 8.    This pulse sequence is the pulse sequence of the first time flow encode.    The pulse sequence shown in FIG. 20 is equivalent to the pulse sequence that is formed by removing the flow encode of Gr direction from the pulse sequence shown in FIG. 10.    This pulse sequence is the pulse sequence of the second time flow encode.<br>
The pulse sequences shown in FIG 21 and FIG. 22 are used as one set to obtain an image that represents the flow of Gs direction.    The pulse sequence shown in FIG. 21 is equivalent to the pulse sequence that is formed by removing the flow encode of Gp direction from the pulse sequence shown in FIG. 11.    This pulse sequence is the pulse sequence of the first time flow encode.    The pulse sequence shown in FIG. 22 is equivalent to the pulse sequence that is formed by removing the flow encode of Gp direction from the pulse sequence shown in FIG. 13.    This pulse sequence is the pulse sequence of the second time flow encode.<br>
Because the gradient echo caused from the static portion is offset in the<br>
two-dimensional or one-dimensional flow encode as described hereinabove like in the case of three-dimensional flow encode, the residual image does not remain on the flow image.<br>
