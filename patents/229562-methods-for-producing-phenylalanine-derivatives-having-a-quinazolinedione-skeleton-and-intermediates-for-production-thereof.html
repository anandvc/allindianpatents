Methods for producing phenylalanine derivatives having a quinazolinedione<br>
Skeleton and intermediates for production thereof<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to methods for producing phenylalanine derivatives having a quinazohnedione skeleton, which are compounds highly useful as drugs having   4 integrin inhibiting activity, and intermediates thereof.<br>
Recently, research on inflammatory diseases in which Of 4 integrin-depending adhesion process participates in the pathology such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, Jorgenâ€™s syndrome, asthma, psoriasis, allergy, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, arterial sclerosis, restenosis, tumor proliferation, tumor metastasis and transplantation rejection has been advanced, and application to treating or preventing agents of the compounds having a 4 integrin inhibiting activity has been expected.<br>
The applicant has already invented new phenylalanine derivatives having a 4 integrin inhibiting activity, which are highly useful as treating or preventing agents for inflammatory diseases in which a 4 integrin-depending adhesion process participates in the pathology and filed a patent appKcations (WO2002-16329).<br>
Conventionally, as the method for producing the phenylalanine derivatives having a quinazolinedione skeleton, it has been reported such as that a quinazolinedione skeleton is constructed via amide intermediates by supporting phenylalanine derivatives on a solid-phase resin (WO2002-16329 and Synlett, 3, 333-336, 2001).<br><br>
However, though the solid-phase synthesis method has excellent advantages as synthesis of a wide range of derivatives, generally it is not a method suitable for industriahzation because the amount of derivatives which can be supported on a sohd-phase resin has limitations and, as a result, the amount of the object substance which can be prepared at one time is extremely small. Further, in the soKd-phase synthesis, a reaction reagent(s) is generally excessively used, and this is inappropriate from the point of industriahzation.<br>
In addition, by substituting the solid-phase synthesis method with a Hquid-phase method based on the sohd-phase synthesis method, for example, in accordance with well-known examples of reports (S.M.Gadekar, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 4666-4667, 1964, and L.GouiUex, et al., Tetrahedron lett, 37(39), 7031, 1996), a quinazohnedione skeleton can be constructed by a synthesizing method comprising steps of reacting amine with carboxylic acid of anthracitic acid to form an amide, and reacting an amino group of anthranihc acid with ethyl chloroform ate, l,l'-carbonyldiimidazole or the Kke to make it in carbamate or carbonyHmidazolyl form and then forming a quinazolinedione ring with a base(s). However, when the compound is synthesized, it has problems in that the number of reaction processes are large and therefore the jelled is low.<br>
On the other hand, as the method via urea intermediates, it has been known such as that amine is reacted with isocyanate to form an urea and a quinazohnedione ring is formed with a base (for example, WO2002-16329 and B.Taub, J. Org. Chem., 26, 5238-5239, 1961).<br>
However, isocyanate is typically a Hquid with a pungent odor and highly toxic, and it is known that isocyanate sometimes induces self-polymerization to produce isocyanurate or reacts with water in the air to disintegrate. Thus, isocyanate is typically low in chemical stability and has toxicity.<br>
From these mentioned above, it is needed to find methods for producing phenylalanine   derivatives   having   a   quinazohnedione   skeleton   suitable  for<br><br>
industrialization,<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>

The present invention also intends to provide intermediates for production of the phenylalanine derivatives having a quinazohnedione skeleton.<br>
The inventors studied the above problems to be solved and they found industrially apical production methods in which phenylalanine derivatives having a quinazohnedione skeleton are conducted in high yield by a synthesizing method using a carbonyl group-introducing reagent(s) via urea intermediates, which is concise operation in mild reaction temperature without compacted solvent extraction and concentration.

Particularly, R3 is preferably a a dimethylamino group, a diethylamino group, a methylethylamino group, a  l group, a piperidyl group, a methylamino group, an ethylamino group, a propylamine group, a cyclopropylmethylamino group, a dimethylaminomethyl group, a diethylaminomethyl group, a dimethylaminoethyl group, a diethylaminoethyl group, a methylaminomethyl group, an ethylaminomethyl group, a propylaminomethyl group, a methylaminoethyl group, an ethylaminoethyl group, a propylaminoethyl group, HC = CCH2 group, a carboxyl group, a methoxycarbonyl group, an ethoxycarbonyl group, a methylthio group or an ethylthio group.<br>
R4 is preferably a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group. In the formula (2), (S) and (4), a hydrogen atom is further preferable and, in the formula (5), an alkyl group is further preferable. While a substituent(s) of a benzyl group includes an alkyl group, an aikoxy group, a halogen atom and the hke, an unsubstituted benzyl group is preferable.<br>
R5 is particularly preferably an alkyl group.<br>
In the formula (2), it is preferable that R3 is in the para position to an amino group.<br><br>
The synthetic intermediates of the formula (l) are synthesized as follows.<br>
A phenylalanine having a nitro group on an aromatic ring and acid chloride are condensed under the conditions of the well-known method, Schotten-Baumann reaction (such as N. 0, V, Sonntag, Chem. Rev. 52, 272, 1953) to produce acylphenylalanine derivatives. Then, said carboxyhc acid is esterified using the well known method (such as R.C.Larockâ€™ Comprehensive Organic Transformations (2nd Ed.), p.1932-1941, Wiley-VCH, New York) to synthesize alkylester of acylphenylalanine. The conventional method, catalytic reduction with a transition metal catalyst(s) (such as R. C. Larock â€˜ Comprehensive Organic Transformations (2nd Ed.), p.821-828, Wiley-VCH, New York) is applied to the synthesized substance in the presence of hydrogen gas to obtain the corresponding compounds of the formula (l).<br>
For example, as the method for producing methylester of Nâ€™ -(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl)-4-amino-L-phenylalanine which is a new synthetic intermediate wherein, in the formula (l), Rl represents a 2,6-dichlorophenyl group and R2 represents a methyl group, said compound can be synthesized by following processes' condensing a publicly-known and commercially available 4"nitro-L"phenylalanine and a similarly pubhcly-known and commercially available 2,6-dichlorobenzoylchloride; subjecting the resultant to methyl esterification ; and reduction of a nitro group.<br>
Concretely, 4-nitro-L"phenylalanine and 2,6-dichlorobenzoylchloride are condensed in a mixed solvent of a sodium hydroxide aqueous solution and acetone with keeping the reaction temperature at 5 to 15 Â°C, and then crystallization is conducted to obtain a corresponding condensed substance, NÂ° -(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl)-4-nitro-L"phenylalanine almost quantitatively.<br>
Subsequently, the condensed substance is suspended into methanol, and methyl esterification is conducted by heating with adding concentrated sulfuric acid.     Then,  crystallization is conducted to  obtain  a corresponding methyl<br><br>
esterified	substance,	methylester	of	NÂ° -(2,6-dichloro<br>
benzoyl)-4-nitro-L-phenylalanine almost quantitatively.<br>
Then, catalytic reduction reaction is conducted to the methyl esterified substance using a transition metal catalyst(s) of a nitro group which is a well-known method (such as F. S. DoveU et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 87, 2767, 1965) and preferably using a platinum carbon catalyst poisoned with sulfur, and hydrogen gas. Thereafter, crystaUization is conducted to obtain methylester of Nâ€™-(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl)-4-amino-L-phenylalanine in high yield, wherein, in the formula (l), Rl represents a 2,6-dichlorophenyl group and R2 represents a methyl group.<br>
The yield in case of going through the three steps from 4-nitro"L-phenylalanine is about 90%.<br>
Meanwhile, the above-mentioned synthesizing method is not a sole method for producing the compound of the formula (l) and does not hmit the method of the present invention. Similarly, the jield indicates an average value thereof and doe not limit the value.<br>
On the other hand, as the method for producing the compound of the formula (2), said compound can be obtained by well-known methods from commercially available trisubstituted benzene derivatives.<br>
For example, as the method for producing methylester of 5-dimethylamino-2-aminobenzoic acid which is a new synthetic intermediate wherein, in the formula (2), R3 represents a dimethylamino group, R4 represents a hydrogen atom and R5 represent a methyl group, said compound can be synthesized by following processes: dimethyl amination, methyl esterification and reduction of a nitro group from a pubhcly-known and commercially available 5-chloro-2-nitrobenzoic acid.<br>
Concretely, 5-chloro-2-nitrobenzoic acid is dissolved in a dimethylamine aqueous solution and heated to produce 5-dimethylaminoâ€™2-nitrobenzoic acid.<br><br>
Hydrochloric acid is added to the reaction solution to precipitate out the product as a solid material. The sohd material is separated to obtain 5-dimethylamno-2-nitrobenzoic acid almost quantitatively.<br>
Next, the 5-dimethylamno-2-nitrobenzoic acid is dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid/methanol and heated to conduct methyl esterification in order to produce methylester of 5-dimethylamino -2-nitrobenzoic acid, which is a well"known method. Toluene and water are added to the reaction solution, and the obtained product is extracted to an organic layer, concentrated, and crystallized to obtain 5-dimethylamino-2-nitrobenzoic acid in high yield.<br>
Next, catalytic reduction is conducted to a nitro group of methylester of 5-dimethylamino-2-nitrobenzoic acid under the acidic condition by hydrochloric acid, using transition metal catalysts such as palladium carbon and hydrogen gas in a methanol solvent. Crystallization is conducted to obtain methylester of 5-dimethylamino-2-aminobenzoic acid / dihydrochloride in high yield.<br>
The yield via the three processes from 5-chloro-2-nitrobenzoic acid is about 80%,<br>
Further, thus obtained methylester of 5-dimethylamino-2-amino benzoic acid of the formula (2) can be obtained stably as salts with acidic substances, e.g., hydrochloride.<br>
However, the above-mentioned synthesizing method is not a sole method for producing the compound of the formula (2) and does not limit the production method of the present invention. Similarly, the jdeld indicates an average value thereof and does not Hmit the value.<br>
The step 1 of the production method of the present invention is explained below.<br>
The method for producing phenylalanine derivatives having a quinazohnedione ring of the formula (5) in the present invention is as follows. The compound of the formula (l) which is the important intermediate and the<br><br>
compound of the formula (2) are converted into asymmetric urea intermediates by using a carbonyl group-introducing reagent(s), preferably l,l'-carbonyldiimidazole or chloroformate, and then the compound of the formula (3) is converted to the compound of the formula (4) under mild basic condition.<br>
In case of the compound wherein R4 in the formula (4) represents a hydrogen atom, the compound can be prepared without isolating the compound of the formula (4), by successively conducting N-alkylation reaction with N-alkylation agents under basic condition. It may be also possible to isolate the compound of the formula (4) and then conduct N-alkylation reaction.<br>
For      example,      an      amino      group      of     methylester      of     N    â€˜â€˜<br>
-(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl)"4-amino-L-phenylalanine of the formula (l) is converted<br>
into carbonylimidazolyl by l,l'-carbonyldiimidazole using an organic solvent(s)<br>
having suitable solubility such as, particularly preferably, acetonitrile.   Without<br>
isolating	the	intermediates	thereof,	methylester	of<br>
5-dimethylamino-2-aminobenzoic acid of the formula (2) is put into the reaction<br>
solvent	to	be	able	to	obtain	methylester	of<br>
2-(3-{4-[2-(2,6-dichlorobenzoylamino)-2-methoxycarbonylethyl]phenyl}ureide)-5-di methylaminobenzoic acid of the formula (S), which is asymmetric urea intermediates, in high yield.<br>
In the present specification, "a carbonyl group-introducing reagent(s)" indicates those wherein only a carbonyl group in atomic groups of a quinazolinedione ring is derived from the present reagent. For instance, they include l,l'-carbonyldiimidazole (Organic syntheses collective volume V, R201-204, Wiley, New York, 1973, as a synthetic example thereof), chloroformate and the hke.   These are publicly known and commercially available.<br>
Further, it is also possible to use reagents wherein an imidazolyl group of l,l'-carbonyldiimidazole is substituted with other heteroaryl removing group(s), such as  l,r-carbonyldi(l,2,4-triazole) (an imidazolyl group in this reagent is<br><br>
substituted with a triazoyl group and the reagent is commercially available). The substituents thereof are not hmited to only an imidazolyl group and a triazoyl group. It is also possible to use other heteroaryl removing groups as the substituents.<br>
It is further possible to use N,N'-disuccinimidyl carbonate (DSC) (N"hydroxysuccinimide in this reagent is a removing group and the reagent is commercially available).<br>
Chloroformate includes reagents having 2 to 10 carbon atoms, such as phenyl chloroformate, nitrophenyl chloroformate, methoxjrphenyl chloroformate, methyl chloroformate, ethyl chloroformate, isobutyl chloroformate, octyl chloroformate and benzyl chloroformate, though they are not hmited to these examples.<br>
Similarly, it is also possible to use phosgene and phosgene analogues such as triphosgene as the carbonyl group-introducing reagents. These are gas or Uquid and highly toxic (Reference: RTECS SY 5600000) as compared with the above reagents and therefore difficult to deal with. Further, since a particular kind of facilities is usually required and distribution thereof is limited, these reagents are not very favorable in the carbonyl group-introducing reagents.<br>
l,l'-carbonyldiimida2ole is particularly preferred as a carbonyl group-introducing reagents. When l,r-carbonyldiimidazole is used, it is superior in that the amount of produced by-products is small and the objective asymmetric urea intermediates are obtained in high yield.<br>
A carbonyl group-introducing reagents is preferably used in 0.8 to 1.2 mol equivalent weight to 1 mol of the compound of the formula (l).<br>
The compound of the formula (2) is preferably used in 0.8 to 1.2 mol equivalent weight to 1 mol of the compound of the formula (l).<br>
The solvents of the present reaction include organic solvents having suitable solubihty to the compounds of the formula (l) such as methylester of N"<br><br>
-(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl)-4-amino-L-phenylalanine. For example, it is possible to use acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran (THF), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), halogenated carbon hydride such as methylene chloride, pyridine, pyrroHdone, N-methylpjn:rohdone, or mixed solvents thereof.<br>
Above aU, when acetonitrile is used, products can be easily separated from the reaction solvent by filtration. Therefore, it is possible to isolate very pure asymmetric urea intermediates of the formula (3) by only a simple separation with filtration. Since it does not require any cumbersome operations such as extraction and concentration of solvents, it is useful as industriahzed process. Similarly, it is also possible to obtain crystals of the objective compound by the steps of the reaction with N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF); adding poor solvents such as alcohols having 1 to 10 carbon atoms or water to precipitate asymmetric urea intermediates as a sohd substance; and then separation by filtration thereof. As a result, acetonitrile and N,N-dimethylformamide are particularly preferable as the solvents of the present reaction.<br>
The concentration of the above reaction is preferably that apphcable as industriahzed process. For example, when acetonitrile is used as a reaction solvent, the reaction should be conducted in 1 to 0.0IM and particularly preferably around 0.2M, from the point of flowabihty in stirring the reaction solution or crystallizing solution.<br>
When the compound of the formula (l) is converted into carbonylimidazolyl by carbonyl group-introducing reagents such as l,r-carbonyldiimidazole, the reaction temperature thereof is preferably within the range of around 0Â°C to not above the boiling point of the reaction solvent. To conduct the reaction around 0Â°C to not above 10Â°C is more industrially preferable in that it is useful for inhibiting side reactions and improving the yield. The reaction time is preferable around 1 to 5 hours.<br>
In the condensation reaction of the compound of the formula (l) converted<br><br>
into carbonyhmidazolyl with methylester of 5-dimethylamino-2-aminobenzoic acid of the formula (2), the reaction temperature thereof is preferably within the range of around 0Â°C to not above the boihng point of the appHed solvent. Particularly, the reaction is more preferably conducted at the reaction temperature of around 50Â°C since urea bond formation reaction is completed in around 2 to 3 hours and the asymmetric urea intermediates of the formula (3) can be obtained in high yield.<br>
However, the reaction temperature and time are not Umited to the above and the reaction time is determined by the balance with the reaction temperature. It is desirable from the industrial point of view that the reaction solution is controlled by analytical methods such as HPLC.<br>
In the above reaction, input order of raw materials and reagents is not particularly hmited. However, the method wherein the compound of the formula (l) is first reacted with a carbonyl group-introducing reagent(s) to convert into carbonyhmidazolyl and then reacted with the compound of the formula (2) is more preferable from the point of the high yield and side reactions as compared with the method wherein the compound of the formula (2) is first converted into carbonylimidazolyl. While, in the production method of the present invention, the compound of the formula (2) may be first converted into carbonylimidazolyl, and the compound of the formula (l), a carbonyl group-introducing reagent(s) and the compound of the formula (2) may be reacted simultaneously.<br>
Next, described herein is the step 2.<br>
The asymmetric urea intermediates of the formula (3) form a quinazoLLnedione ring in the presence of a base in a sviitable reaction solvent to give the quinazoUnedione compounds of the formula (4).<br>
The 'Tâ€™ase" herein includes an inorganic base and organic base. Inorganic bases include salts with alkali metals such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, cesium carbonate, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide and the hke;<br><br>
and salts with alkahne earth metals such as calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate. Organic bases include triethylamine, ethanolamine, morpholine, piperidine, dicyclohexylamine, l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec"7-ene (DBU) and N,N-diisopropyl-N-ethylamine (DIPEA). Inorganic bases are preferable and particularly potassium carbonate and sodium methoxide are preferable.<br>
The base is preferably used in 0,1 to 2.0 mol equivalent weight to 1 mol of the compound of the formula (3), and it is more preferable that 1 mol equivalent weight or less of a catalyst is used.   The reaction time is preferably 1 to 6 hours.<br>
For example, when potassium carbonate is used as a base, 0.1 to 2 mol equivalent weight thereof is preferable and 0.2 to 0.4 mol equivalent weight is more preferable. When sodium methoxide is used as a base, 0.1 to 1.0 mol equivalent weight thereof is preferable and 0.2 to 0.4 mol equivalent weight is more preferable.    1 to 2 hours of the reaction time are enough at that time.<br>
The solvents in the above reactions may be those in which the compound of the formula (3) is dissolved and the reaction proceeds smoothly. For example, they include dimethylformamide (DMF) and a mixed solvent with alcohols containing dimethylformamide as a main ingredient, though the solvents are not Hmited to these.<br>
Meanwhile, when potassium carbonate is used as a base, it is preferable to use a mixed solvent of DMF and methanol from the point of shortening of the reaction time. As the relative proportions of the mixed solvent of DMF and methanol, around 10 to 1 is suitable, though the proportions are not hmited to this.<br>
As the reaction concentration of the above reactions, it is preferable that the reaction is conducted in the concentration apphcable as industrialized process of within 0.01 to 2M and, for example, around 0.25M in case of the mixed solvent of DMF and methanol, though the concentration thereof is not Hmited to these.<br>
As the reaction temperature, 0Â°C to not above the boiling point of the solvent,<br><br>
and preferably around 25'C is suitable.<br>
The quinazohnedione compounds of the formula (4) produced by the above reactions can be precipitated as solid substance by adding water or an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid dropwise to the reaction solution, or by adding the reaction solution to water or an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid, and then precipitated substance can be isolated by the typical separating methods.<br>
When potassium carbonate is used as a base, the quinazohnedione ring formation reaction is conducted to the asymmetric urea intermediates of the formula (3) and then N-methylation reaction can be soon hnked after that without isolating the compound of the formula (4) and, therefore, one process in the reaction processes can be skipped. When taking account of improvement in production efficiency from the point of industriahzation, this method is particularly useful as industriahzed process since the isolating process of the compound of the formula (4) can be simplified.<br>
Finally, described herein is the step 3,<br>
In the formula (4), when R4 is a hydrogen atom, the compound can be derived into quinazohnedione compounds of the formula (5) with N- alkylation agents in the presence of a base.<br>
Meanwhile, it is also possible to isolate the quinazohnedione compounds of the formula (4), which is produced in the step 2, and then N-alkylate. However, it is preferable from the point of industriahzation to N-alkylate without isolation.<br>
In the present specification, "N-alkylation agents" indicate reagents which can introduce an alkyl group on a nitrogen atom, and haloalkane, alkyl sulfonate and benzyl hahde which may be substituted are included, for example.<br>
Here, haloalkane and alkyl sulfonate are preferably those having 1 to 10 carbon atoms. Those having 1 to 6 carbon atoms are further preferable and those having 1 to 3 carton atoms are particularly preferable. Haloalkane includes,  for example,  methyl iodide  and ethyl iodide,  and  alkyl sulfonate<br><br>
includes, for example, methyl methanesulphonate, ethyl methanesulphonate, methyl ethanesulphonate, ethyl ethanesulphonate, methyl p-toluenesulphonate and ethyl p-toluenesulphonate. Benzyl halide includes benzylchloride, benzylbromide and the like, and the substituents thereof are an alkyl group, an alkoxy group, a halogen atom and the like.<br>
For example, in the production of the compound wherein R4 in the formula (5) is a methyl group, methyl p-toluenesulphonate is suitable from the point of industrialization. Namely, methyl p-toluenesulphonate has the higher boiling point as compared with methyl iodide and is easy to deal with under room temperature. Further, methyl p-toluenesulphonate has the favorable flowabiUty of the reaction solution and is suitable for the industrialized process with solution sending.<br>
As the usage amount of N-alkylation agents, the range of 1 to 10 mol eqxuvalent weight thereof and preferably around 1.2 to 2.0 mol equivalent weight is suitable to the compound of the formula (3) or (4). The amount of the reagents can be increased or decreased in accordance with progress of the reaction.<br>
A base includes inorganic bases and organic bases. Here, examples of inorganic bases are salts with alkali metals such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, cesium carbonate, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide and the like; and salts with alkaline earth metals such as calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate. Organic bases include triethylamine, ethanolamine, morpholine, piperidine, dicyclohexylamine, l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) and N,N-dusopropyl-N-ethylamine (DIPEA). Inorganic bases are preferable and particularly potassium carbonate is preferable.<br>
The base is preferably used in 1.5 to 2 mol equivalent weight to the compound of the formula (3) or (4) and more preferably around 1.8 mol equivalent weight, while the amount is not limited to these and can be increased or decreased in accordance with progress of the reaction.<br><br>
The reaction solvents may be those in which the compound of the formula (3) or (4) is dissolved and the reaction proceeds smoothly. For example, they include dimethylformamide (DMF) and a mixed solvent with alcohols containing dimethylformamide as a main ingredient, though the solvents are not limited to these. Meanwhile, when potassium carbonate is used as a base, it is preferable to use a mixed solvent of DMF and methanol from the point of shortening of the reaction time. As the relative proportions of the mixed solvent of DMF and methanol, around 10 to 1 is suitable, though the proportions are not Hmited to this. As the reaction concentration of the above reactions, it is preferable that the reaction is conducted in the concentration apphcable as industriahzed process of within 0.01 to 2M and, for example, around 0.25M in case of the mixed solvent of DMF and methanol, though the concentration thereof is not Hmited to these.<br>
As the reaction temperature, 0Â°C to not above the boiling point of the reaction solvent, and preferably around 40Â°C is suitable, though the temperature thereof is not Hmited to these. The reaction time may be 3 to 18 hours, and it is desirable from the industrial point of view that the reaction solution is administered by analytical methods such as HPLC.<br>
For example, an asymmetric urea intermediate wherein, in the formula (4),<br>
Rl is 2,6-dihlorophenyl group, R2 is a methyl group and R3 is a dimethylamino<br>
group is dissolved at 25 â€˜C in a mixed solvent of DMF and methanol. The<br>
quinazolinedione ring formation reaction is conducted by stirring for 2 hours<br>
using 0.2 mol equivalent weight of potassium carbonate to the compound of the<br>
formula (4). Then, 1.5 mol equivalent weight of methyl p-toluenesulphonate and<br>
1.8 mol equivalent weight of potassium carbonate are added to conduct<br>
N-methylation reaction. Two processes are gone through from the formula (4) to<br>
be	able	to	obtain	methylester	of	N	â€˜â€˜<br>
-(2,6-dichlorobenzoyl)-4-(l-methyl-6-dimethylamino-2,4 [lH,3H]-quinazolinedione-3-yl)-L-phenylalanine of the formula (5) in the yield of<br><br>
80 to 90%.<br>
The compound of the formula (5) can be precipitated as solid substance by adding water to the reaction solvent and isolated by the typical separating methods such as jSltration, though the method is not limited to this.<br>
The above production methods describe the case using the compound wherein, in the formula (2), R4 is a hydrogen atom. As for the compounds wherein, in the formula (2), R4 is an alkyl group or a benzyl group which may have a substituent(s), as the reaction process with N-alkylation agents is not necessary, the compound of the formula (l) and the compound of the formula (2) are derived into asymmetric urea intermediates of the formula (3) by using a carbonyl group-introducing reagent(s) and preferably l,r-carbonyldiimidazole; the compound of the formula (3) is converted to the compound of the formula (4) under mild basic condition; and then the compound of the formula (4) is isolated to obtain the objective compound of the formula (5) (because the formula (4) and the formula (5) are identical in this case).<br>
From the above production methods, herein provided is the industrially appHcable method for producing phenylalanine derivatives having a quinazolinedione ring of the formula (5) via the crucial intermediate (3) from crucial intermediates of the formulae (l) and (2).<br>
Meanwhile, when R3 is a monoalkylamino group, an amino group, an alkyl group substituted with a monoalkylamino group or an alkyl group substituted with an amino group, a hydrogen atom(s) directly bonding to a nitrogen atom constituting the amino group may be protected in advance by a proper protecting group(s) and then the protection thereof may be removed by suitable methods of removal of protection. The methods for protection and removal of protection are described in, for example, "Protecting group in organic synthesis" by Theodora W. Greene, Peter G. M. Wuts, Second edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., New York, 1991, 309-385.<br><br>
For example, a hydrogen atom(s) directly bonding to a nitrogen atom constituting the amino group may be substituted, by using acylation agents in ordinary acylation methods, with an alkylcarbonyl group having 2 to 7 carbon atoms which may have a substituent(s) such as an acetyl group, a propionyl group, a butyryl group, an isobutyryl group, a valeryl group, an isovaleryl group, a pivaloyl group, a trifluoroacetyl group and the like; an arylcarbonyl group which may have a substituent(s) such as a benzoyl group; an arylalkylcarbonyl group which may have a substituent(s) such as a benzylcarbonyl group; an alkoxycarbonyl group having 2 to 7 carbon atoms which may have a substituent(s) such as a methoxycarbonyl group, an ethoxycarbonyl group, a propyloxycarbonyl group, a butoxycarbonyl group, a tertiarybutoxycarbonyl group, a trifluoromethoxy carbonyl group and the like; an aryloxycarbonyl group which may have a substituent(s) such as a phenoxycarbonyl group; and an arylalkyloxycarbonyl group which may have a substituent(s) such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group.<br>

In this case, after completion of the reaction of the first, second or third step in the present invention, particularly after the completion of the N-alkylation reaction in the third step of the present invention, a protecting group(s) can be removed under the catalytic reduction condition (hydrogenating reaction) and the hke.<br>
Meanwhile, the substituents in case of the above protecting groups "which may have a substituent(s)" include, for example, a halogen atom, an alkoxy group, an aUcyl group, a hydroxy group, a halogenoalkyl group and a halogenoalkoxy group.<br>
The 'Tialogen atom" in the present specification indicates a fluorine atom, a chlorine atom, a bromine atom and an iodine atom. The 'lialogeno"" as the component in a substituent indicates fluoro-, chloro-, bromo- and iodo-.<br>
The "chemically acceptable acids" in the formula (l) or (2) include inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid and hydrobromic acid; organic carboxylic acid such as acetic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, tannic acid, butyric acid, hibenzic acid, pamoic acid, enanthic acid, decanoic acid, teochc acid, salicylic acid, lactic acid, oxahc acid, mandehc acid and malic acid; and organic sulfonic acid such as methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and benzenesulfonic acid. The free forms are particularly preferable in the compound of the formula (l) and the hydrochloride is particularly preferable in the compound of the formula (2),   They may be hydrates or solvates thereof.<br>
In the present invention, when R3 in the formula (5) is a dialkylamino group, the resulting compound is therapeutically superior, and therefore, R3 in the formulae (2) and (3) are preferably dialkylamino groups.   Among dialkylamino<br><br>
groups, a dimethylamino group, a diethylamino group, a methylethylamino group, a pyrrolidinyl group and a piperidinyl group are preferable.   Particularly, it is preferable that R3 is a dimethylamino group.<br>
Similarly, it is also preferable that R3 in the formulae (2) and (3) are a monoalkylamino group, an alkyl group substituted with a dialkylamino group, an alkyl group substituted with a monoalkylamino group, an alkyl group substituted with an alkynyl group, a carboxyl group, an alkoxycarbonyl group or an alkylthio group. Particularly preferred ones are a methylamino group, an ethylamino group, a propylamino group, a cyclopropylmethylamino group, a dimethylaminometyl group, a diethylaminomethyl group, a dimethylaminoethyl group, a diethylaminoethyl group, a methylaminom ethyl group, an ethylaminomethyl group, a propylaminomethyl group, methylaminoethyl group, ethylaminoethyl group, a propylaminoethyl group, HC = CCH2 group, a carboxyl group, a methoxycarbonyl group, an ethoxycarbonyl group, a methylthio group and an ethylthio group.<br>
Among these, when R3 in the formulae (2) and (3) are a monoalkylamino group or an alkyl group substituted with a monoalkylamino group, a hydrogen atom(s) directly bonding to a nitrogen atom constituting the amino group may be substituted with an alkylcarbonyl group having 2 to 7 carbon atoms which may have a substituent(s) such as an acetyl group, a propionyl group, a butyryl group, an isobutyryl group, a valeryl group, an isovaleryl group, a pivaloyl group, a trifluoroacetyl group and the like; an arylcarbonyl group which may have a substituent(s) such as a benzoyl group; an arylalkylcarbonyl group which may have a substituent(s) such as a benzylcarbonyl group; an alkoxycarbonyl group having 2 to 7 carbon atoms which may have a substituent(s) such as a methoxycarbonyl group, an ethoxycarbonyl group, a propyloxycarbonyl group, a butoxycarbonyl group, a tertiary-butoxycarbonyl group, a triQuoromethoxy carbonyl  group  and the like;  an  aryloxycarbonyl group  which may have a<br><br>
substituent(s) such as a phenoxycarbonyl group; and an arylaUcyloxycarbonyl group which may have a substituent(s) such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group. A hydrogen atom(s) directly bonding to a nitrogen atom constituting the amino group may be substituted with an arylalkyl group which may have a substituent(s) such as a benzyl group, a phenethyl group, a methylbenzyl group, a methoxybenzyl group and a halobenzyl group, and the like.
