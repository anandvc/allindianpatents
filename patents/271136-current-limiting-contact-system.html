2. Applicant<br>
(a)	NAME :	LARSEN &amp; TOUBRO LIMITED<br>

State of Maharashtra, India<br>
3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a current limiting contact system. More particularly, the invention relates to a current limiting contact system for achieving strong magnetic field for moving contact and strong blow-out field for arc at the time of short circuit to clear the short circuit fault rapidly.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
A current limiting circuit breaker should clear fault as fast as possible so that let through energy passing to the connected downstream devices can be minimized and connected downstream devices remain safe from thermal stresses due to this let through energy passed. At the same time a current limiting circuit breaker also limits the fault current as low as possible so that connected downstream devices do not come under stresses due to high magnetic force because of this high magnitude limited current. Magnetic field in contact region and blow out field are some of the main factors contributing to clear the short circuit fault as fast as possible.<br>
In DE19629867 two parallel rails 33 and 34 are making two U-shaped parallel loops. Two parallel rails 40 and 41 are making two L-shaped parallel loops. U-shaped loops 33 and 34 are connected by 35 and 36 and L-shaped loops 40 and 41 are connected by 42 and 43. Part 36 and part 42 are connected by rotary bar 39 and 46. If we suppose that current enters from part 35 then arrows in part 35, part 33, part 34, part 36, part 39, part 46, part 42, part 40, part 41 and part 43 are showing the direction of the current in contact system.<br>
2<br><br>
Rotary bar 39 and 46 move in central plane. This central plane is that plane which bisects the distance between part<br>
33	and part 34 and the same central plane also bisects the distance between 40 and 41. Part 33 and part 34 are having an offset from this central plane and part 40 and 41 also have an offset from central plane. Rotary bar 39 interacts with magnetic field created by part 33 and part 34 at the central plane. Rotary bar 46 interacts with magnetic field created by part 40 and part 41. At the time of short circuit, current in rotary bar 39 and magnetic field, created by part 33 and part<br>
34	at central plane, interacts and clears the fault. Current in rotary bar 46 interacts with magnetic field created by part 40 and part 41at central plane and clears the fault. U-shaped loops and L-shaped loops have an offset from the central plane and because of this offset magnetic field strength at central plane decreases. The present invention doesn't make offset loops and the magnetic field strength at the central plane is more than DE19629867.<br>
Thus there is a need to provide for a current limiting contact system so as to achieve strong magnetic field for moving contact and strong blow-out field for arc at the time of short circuit to clear the short circuit fault rapidly.<br>
The present inventors have now found that strong magnetic field for moving contact and strong blow-out field for arc at the time of short circuit to clear the short circuit fault can be achieved by a unique design of a loop means carrying current being operatively combined to movable means.<br>
3<br><br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
Thus one object of the present invention is to provide a current limiting contact system to achieve strong magnetic field for moving contacts.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a current limiting contact system to provide for strong blowout field.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to clear the short circuit fault rapidly.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Thus according one aspect of the present invention there is provided a current limiting contact system comprising :<br>
cassette;<br>
conducting bar means being operatively disposed in plurality<br>
of chambers provided in  cassette, said conducting bar means<br>
being  movable  inside    said  chamber  having  appropriate<br>
clearance in a predetermined central plane;<br>
plurality of contact means suitably located on said bar<br>
means;<br>
plurality of loop means being accommodated in said chambers<br>
comprising  an  aperture  so  as  to  operatively  dispose<br>
conducting bar;<br>
wherein said loop means being profiled so as to generate<br>
strong magnetic field; and<br>
plurality of plate means being operatively placed in said<br>
loop means<br>
4<br><br>
for achieving strong magnetic field and strong blow-out field.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The contact system of the present invention comprises cassette having two chambers which are bridged by conducting bar. The bar has two moving parts each of which are disposed in the two chambers in a predetermined manner. The intermediate part the bridging conducting bar which lies between the two moving parts is housed in a driving shaft. The moving part comprises moving contact button means and fixed contact button means are fixed on loop means (herein described as current carrying fixed contact loop) . Just next to the fixed contact button an arc runner is assembled on current carrying fixed contact loop. Current carrying fixed contact loop employs arc chute, moving contact and moving part as described above. The current carrying fixed contact loop means comprises a U-shape profile of appropriate width such that the conducting bar means are able to move at high speed along the central plane bisecting the loop. The loop is beveled at appropriate locations.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention an insulating shield means is provided to current carrying fixed contact loop so that at the time of short circuit current carrying loop does not get exposed to the arc. Deion plates means are arranged in such a way that these deion plates direct ionized gases to the outside chamber with the help of an exit. A cut / aperture is provided in current carrying fixed contact loop so that moving contact<br>
5<br><br>
can pass through this cut / aperture. Insulating cover means is provided between current carrying fixed contact loop and moving part so that the moving part is prevented to be exposed to current carrying fixed contact loop. Second current carrying fixed contact loop is housed in the other chamber. Fixed contact button is assembled on current carrying fixed contact loop and just next to fixed contact button an arc runner is also fixed on the current carrying fixed contact loop.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention moving contact button and moving part rotate in a central plane. Because of the profile of current carrying fixed contact loop as described above a strong magnetic field B is created at central plane. Moving contact button and moving part move in central plane and because of the strong magnetic field moving parts open with high speed and blow out forces on the arc are also very high at the time of short circuit.<br>
