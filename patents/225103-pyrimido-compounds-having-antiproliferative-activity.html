These compounds inhibit the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases (SFKs). These compounds and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts have antiproliferative activity and are useful in the treatment or control of cancer, in particular in the treatment or control of solid tumors. In addition these compounds have advantageous bioavailability profiles. This invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds and to methods of treating or controlling cancer, most particularly the treatment or control of breast, colon, hepatic and pancreatic tumors.<br>
Protein kinases are a class of proteins (enzymes) that regulate a variety of cellular functions. This is accomplished by the phosphorylation of specific amino acids on protein substrates resulting in conformational alteration of the substrate protein. The conformational change modulates the activity of the substrate or its ability to interact with other binding partners. The enzyme activity of the protein kinase refers to the rate<br><br>
at which the kinase adds phosphate groups to a substrate. It can be measured, for example, by determining the amount of a substrate that is converted to a product as a function of time. Phosphorylation of a substrate occurs at the active-site of a protein kinase.<br>
Tyrosine kinases are a subset of protein kinases that catalyze the transfer of the terminal phosphate of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to tyrosine residues on protein substrates. These kinases play an important part in the propagation of growth factor signal transduction that leads to cellular proliferation, differentiation and migration.<br>
For example, the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases has been specifically implicated in cancer cell modulation and growth. See D, H. Boschelli and F. Boschelli, "Small molecule inhibitors of Src family kinases," Drugs of the Future 2000, 25(7):717-736.   Src over expression has been detected in colon, breast, hepatic and pancreatic tumors, as well as in certain B-cell leukemias and lymphomas. Id at 719. Increased Src expression and activity has also been shown to correlate with an increase in tumor malignancy.   Id at 719.  Thus, Src inhibitors can be useful as antitumor agents.<br>
There are several examples of small molecule inhibitors of protein kinase catalytic activity. In particular, small molecule inhibitors typically block the phosphorylation of substrates by tightly interacting with the protein kinase ATP binding site (or "active site"). See WO 98/24432 and Hennequin L. F. et. al., J. Med. Chem. 2002, 45(6), ppl300. Several of these compounds inhibit multiple targets. For example, W099/61444 (Warner-Lambert) discloses bicyclic pyrimidines and bicyclic 3,4-dihydropyrimidines of formula<br><br>
that are asserted to inhibit cyclin dependent kinases Cdkl, Cdk2 and Cdk4 as well as the growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase enzymes PDGFR and FGFR. Some compounds are also asserted to inhibit Cdk6.<br>
US Patent No. 6,150,373 (Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.) discloses bicyclic nitrogen heterocycles of formula<br><br><br>
that are stated to inhibit the T-cell tyrosine kinase p56lck.<br>
WO 01/29041 Al and WO 01/29042 (F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG) disclose alkylamino substituted bicyclic nitrogen heterocycles of formula<br><br>
that are stated to inhibit p38 mediated cellular functions and are thus inhibitors of cellular proliferation.<br>
WO 01/64679 Al (SmithKline Beecham) discloses l,5-disubstituted-3,4-dihydro-lH-pyrimido[4,5-D]pyrimidin-2-one compounds of formula<br><br>
that are stated to be useful in treating CSBP/P38 kinase mediated diseases.<br>
There continues to be a need for easily synthesized, small-molecule compounds effective in inhibiting the catalytic activity of protein kinases, in particular the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases ("SFKs"), for treating one or more types of cancers, particularly solid tumors. It is preferable that such small molecule inhibitors also possess advantageous bioavailability profiles. It is thus an object of this invention to provide such compounds and pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds.<br>
The present invention relates to novel pyrimido compounds capable of inhibiting the activity of SFKs. These compounds are useful in the treatment or control of cancer, in<br><br>
particular the treatment or control of solid tumors. In particular this invention relates to compounds of formula<br><br>
or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8 and R are as hereinafter defined.<br>
The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds of formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method for treating or controlling solid tumors, in particular treatment or control of breast, lung, colon and prostate tumors, most particularly breast or colon tumors, by administering to a human patient in need of such therapy an effective amount of a compound of formula I and/or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof.<br>
The present invention is further directed to novel intermediate compounds useful in the preparation of compounds of formula I.<br>
As used herein, the following terms shall have the following definitions.<br>
"Alkenyl" denotes a straight-chain or branched aliphatic hydrocarbon having at least one set of carbon-carbon double bond, for example vinyl, 2-butenyl, and3-methyl-2-butenyl.<br>
"Alkynyl" denotes a straight-chain or branched aliphatic hydrocarbon haying at least one set of carbon-carbon triple bond, for example ethynyl, and 2-butynyl.<br>
"Alkyl" denotes a straight-chain or branched saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon having 1 to 10, preferably 1 to 6, and more preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Alkyl groups<br><br>
having 1 to 6 carbon atoms are also referred to herein as "lower alkyi." Typical lower alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, t-butyl, 2-butyl, pentyl and hexyl. As used herein the sample designation C1-4 alkyl means alkyl having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
"Alkoxy" means an alkyl radical that is attached to the remainder of the molecule by oxygen ( RO -), e.g. methoxy, ethoxy.<br>
"Aryl" means an aromatic carbocyclic radical, for example a 6 -10 membered aromatic or partially aromatic ring system. Preferred aryl groups include, but are not limited to, phenyl, naphthyl, tolyl and xylyl.<br>
"Cycloalkyl" means a non-aromatic, partially or completely saturated cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbon group containing 3 to 8 atoms. Examples of cycloalkyl groups include cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl.<br>
"Effective amount" or "therapeutically effective amount" means an amount of at least one compound for formula I, or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof, that significantly inhibits proliferation of tumor cells, including human tumor cell lines.<br>
"Halogen" means fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, preferably chlorine, fluorine or bromine.<br>
"Hetero atom" means an atom selected from N, O and S, preferably N. If the hetero atom is N, it can be present as -NH- or -N-lower alkyl-. If the hetero atom is S, it can be present as S, SO or S02.<br>

whereby both peptides were synthesized by an optimized solid phase peptide synthesis protocol (Merrifield (1962) Fed. Proc. Fed. Amer. Soc Exp. Biol. 21, 412) on an Zinsser SMP350 peptide synthesizer. Shortly, the peptide was assembled on 160 mg (22/8 pmol scale) of a Rink-Linker modified polystyrene solid phase by repeatedly conjugating a twenty fold excess of aminoacids each protected by temporary piperidine labile Fmoc-and permanent acid labile tert- Bu- BOC- and O-tert-Bu-groups depending on the side<br><br>
chain function. The substrate sequence AEEEIYGEFEAKKKK was N-terminal additionally mounted with the spacer amino acids Aminocaprylic acid and Glycin. After cleavage of the N-terminal temporary protecting group the still attached and protected peptide was labeled with a 1.5 fold amount of LightCycler-Red 640-N-hydroxy succinimide ester (purchased from Roche Diagnostics GmbH) and triethylamine. After 3 hrs. the resin was washed with dimethylformamide and isopropanol until the eluates of the blue resin got colourless. The fully protected and labeled peptide was removed from the solid phase and released from the permanent protecting groups by treatment with a mixture of 80% trifluoracetic acid, 10% ethanedithiol, 5% thioanisol and 5% water. The substrate was finally isolated by a preparative reverse phase HPLC purification. The purification yielded 12.2 mg RP-HPLC single peak pure blue material (lyophilisate).
