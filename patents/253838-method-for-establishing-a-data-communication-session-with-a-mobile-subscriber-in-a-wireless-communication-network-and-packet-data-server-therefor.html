				<td>modern wireless networks are divided into geographical zones, called cells (hence the term<br>
"cellular"), which allow a plurality of subscribers to share the services of a radio tower and a<br>
frequency within each cell. Accordingly, it is a goal of communication providers to increase<br>
the capacity and performance of the available cellular communication infrastructure. This<br>
patent application provides systems and methods that are directed to such improvements.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0004] One or more embodiments described herein provide systems and methods for<br>
reducing data session establishment time in 3G or CDMA-2000 wireless communication<br>
networks. By preventing or minimizing the time lost in establishing a successful over the air<br>
configuration negotiation, service providers and subscribers will enjoy increased network<br>
performance. Time and signal-based triggers and wait periods are defined to optimize the<br>
timing of the delivery of the configuration request signals from the packet data servers to the<br>
mobile subscribers for minimum session establishment time.<br>
[0005] One embodiment is directed to a method for establishing a data communication<br>
session with a mobile subscriber in a wireless communication network, the method<br>
comprising registering a data communication session with a packet data server, wherein the<br>
method comprises providing a wait time period during which the packet data server refrains<br>
from sending a configuration request to the mobile subscriber and following the wait time<br>
period, sending a configuration request signal to the subscriber to negotiate establishment of<br>
the data communication session.<br><br>
[0006] In a preferred embodiment, the wait time is divided into a first wait period and a<br>
second wait period.<br>
[0007] The above method further comprises providing the first wait time period during<br>
which the packet data server negotiates an initial configuration with the mobile subscriber,<br>
the first wait time period substantially defining await time following unsuccessful attempts<br>
to send an initial configuration request signal to the mobile subscriber during establishment<br>
of the data session, and following providing the first wait time period, providing the second<br>
wait time period, different from the first wait time period, the second wait time period<br>
substantially defining a wait time following a data communication error event before the<br>
packet data server attempts to renegotiate the data session with the mobile subscriber.<br>
[0008] In yet another preferred embodiment, the method for establishing a data<br>
communication session with a mobile subscriber in a wireless communication network,<br>
further comprises buffering data packets in a buffer in a time period between said registering<br>
of the data session and said negotiating of the data communication session, the act of<br>
buffering said data' packets preventing loss of data packets sent from the packet dataserver<br>
to the mobile subscriber prior to successful establishment of an air linkto the mobile<br>
subscriber.<br>
[0009] Another preferred embodiment of a method for establishing a data communication<br>
session with a mobile subscriber in a wireless communication network, includes the steps of<br>
exchanging data session registration request and reply signals between a packet control<br>
function module and a data packet server module to register the data communication session<br><br>
according to a known communication control protocol; and<br>
preventing a premature transmission of a data session configuration request signal<br>
from the data packet server module to the mobile subscriber by preemptively withholding<br>
the data session configuration request signal at the data packet server module until a<br>
triggering event is received by the packet data server indicating that the data session<br>
configuration request signal is to be sent to the mobile subscriber.<br>
[0010] In another embodiment, a packet data server is provided, the packet data server<br>
being arranged to communicate with a mobile subscriber via a communication network, the<br>
communication network being adapted to carry control and data packets between the mobile<br>
subscriber and the packet data server, the communication network having a radio air link<br>
portion, the radio air link having associated therewith an air link establishment delay time,<br>
wherein said packet data server includes a processor arranged to receive a trigger signal<br>
indicating that said radio air link is ready to carry a configuration request signal to said<br>
mobile subscriber and arranged to send a configuration request signal over said<br>
communication network responsive to said trigger signal.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0012] A hallmark of successful wireless communication is the ability to seamlessly<br>
"hand off a mobile subscriber from one base station to another as the mobile subscriber<br>
physically moves, e.g. drives, from one cell to the other. Proper call handoff from one<br>
base station to another provides the subscriber with uninterrupted service during a call,<br>
and is done quickly and smoothly to avoid compromising the call quality. In data<br>
communications, this avoids dropped packets and provides increased data transfer speeds.<br>
In switching between base, stations, calls need to be established in each base statipn that<br>
comes online to service the calls.<br><br>
[0013] Two protocols are used in the setting up cellular calls on CDMA-2000<br>
networks: the A11 protocol used for call establishment, and the A10 protocol that<br>
provides for data transport. Together, the A10/A11 protocols are known as the RP<br>
Interface, and are specified according to the 3G Partnership Project-2 (3GPP2), which<br>
maintains an Internet presence at www.3gpp2.org. Subscriber data exchanged over the<br>
A10 protocol is formatted using the point-to-point (PPP) protocol, which connects most<br>
computers to the Internet.<br>
[0014] Refer to Figure 1, which illustrates a CDMA-2000 communication system<br>
100 and components thereof. Mobile subscriber (MS, 110) is serviced by base station<br>
(BTS, 120) and base station controller (BSC, 130). The system allows the subscriber to<br>
carry out a data communication session facilitated by a packet data server, also referred to<br>
herein as a packet data servicing node (PDSN, 160), over IP network 170. Packet control<br>
function (PCF, 150) is an entity that supplies A10/A11 communication between BSC 130<br>
and PDSN 160. Home Agent (HA, 180) is used to keep subscriber-specific data and<br>
controls the interaction between subscribers and their home (institution) networks and<br>
foreign agents. Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) Server 190<br>
provides the system with knowledge of the subscriber's subscription and service details<br>
relating to access and billing.<br>
[0015] To negotiate an IP data session to the point where data can be passed along the<br>
session, PCF 150 and PDSN 160 first signal one another according to a predetermined<br>
signaling scheme (Al 1) to register the data session. Following the PCF-PDSN<br>
registration transaction, PDSN 160 exchanges signals with MS 110 according to the Link<br>
Configuration Protocol (LCP). PPP provides the LCP for establishing, configuring and<br>
testing the data link connection. LCP is used to automatically negotiate the encapsulation<br><br>
format options between PDSN160 and MS 110, handle varying limits on sizes of<br>
packets, detect a looped-back link and configuration errors, and terminate the link. Other<br>
optional facilities provided are authentication of the identity of a peer on the link, and<br>
determining when a link is functioning properly and when it is failing.<br>
[0016] LCP packets are generally grouped into three types: 1) Link configuration<br>
packets, which are used to establish and configure a link (link configuration packets<br>
include Configure-Request, Configure-Ack, Configure-Nak, and Configure-Reject<br>
packets); 2) Link termination packets, which are used to terminate a link (link termination<br>
packets include Terminate-Request and Terminate-Ack packets); and 3) Link<br>
maintenance packets, which are used to manage and debug a link (these include Code-<br>
Reject, Protocol-Reject, Echo-Request, Echo-Reply, and Discard-Request packets). LCP<br>
packets are encapsulated in the PPP Information field (one packet per field), and the PPP<br>
Protocol field indicates the LCP type within the PPP Information Field using the<br>
designation hex:c021.<br>
[0017] Figure 2 illustrates a sequence of signals exchanged between an MS 110, PCF<br>
150, and PDSN 160 to establish a data session. MS 110 initiates a call to the network,<br>
through its base station BTS 120 and base station controller BSC 130. PCF 150 receives<br>
a notification of the request and contacts PDSN 160 with an Al 1 "registration request"<br>
signal 210, requesting a data session to be established. PDSN 160 responds with an Al 1<br>
"registration reply" signal 212 to accept or reject the data session. When PCF 150<br>
receives a favorable (acceptance) registration reply from PDSN 160, PCF 150 acts to<br>
establish a radio air link 215 with MS 110, allowing MS 110 to communicate with PDSN<br>
160.<br><br>
[0018] The act of establishing the radio air link is a common cause for delays in<br>
establishing data sessions in 3G wireless systems. Because the network connecting MS<br>
110, PCF 150, and PDSN 160 is geographically distributed, it takes a finite time for<br>
signals to travel between the components of the network. Notably, it can take an<br>
appreciable time for radio air link 215 to be established between PCF 150 and MS 110.<br>
In general, the time to establish an air link can vary, depending on the service vendor and<br>
network conditions, typically being between 50 milliseconds and a full second.<br>
[0019] If the air link is not established when the PDSN 160 commences sending its<br>
next request, an LCP configuration request 220 to MS 110 to establish the data session,<br>
the LCP configuration request 220 is lost; and PDSN 160 must retransmit its<br>
configuration request 220. Under the A11 protocol, there is no mechanism that prevents<br>
PDSN 160 from sending LCP configuration request 220 prematurely, before air link 215<br>
to MS 110 is established. This can occur because the A11 protocol does not include 3-<br>
way handshaking to ensure that all the components involved in establishing the data<br>
session are properly considered and synchronized. Therefore, a race condition can be<br>
created, where the A11 call establishment procedure allows PDSN 160 to send its initial<br>
LCP configure request 220 before the air link is properly established to MS 110. This<br>
condition results in a time-out in the PDSN PPP state machine, and the time-out results in<br>
retransmission of the lost LCP request 220 after some predetermined period of time.<br>
Under current protocols, this time-out period of time can be about 3 seconds, or even up<br>
to 6 seconds in duration.<br>
[0020] The missed initial LCP configuration request problem described above can be<br>
exacerbated when various functions of PCF 150 are carried out at different locations on<br>
separate hardware. For example, a first piece of hardware and functionality may be<br><br>
dedicated to processing the PCF-PDSN registration request-response messages, while a<br>
second piece of hardware and functionality may be dedicated to processing the -data<br>
packet flow between MS 110 and PDSN 160. Yet another piece of hardware might be<br>
responsible for making and maintaining the physical radio air link between MS 110 and<br>
PCF150. Note that communication between MS 110 and PDSN 160 normally passes<br>
through PCF 150.<br>
[0021] The race condition, and/or the time-out condition occur often enough in 3G<br>
wireless systems as to cause a noticeable degradation in system performance from the<br>
point of view of an affected subscriber. Wireless vendors have failed to appreciate or<br>
remedy the above problem, perhaps because they maintain a traditional voice service<br>
(time domain) perspective that is generally insensitive to a loss of a small leading portion<br>
of a signal (e.g., half a second of a voice signal). However, in the context of digital data<br>
communication, communication is usually viewed in the packet domain, and the same<br>
losses are not acceptable. Therefore, one issue recognized and treated in the present<br>
disclosure is that of the relative timing of the signals in the LCP sequence on establishing<br>
a data session and corresponding air linkiin a CDMA-2000 network.<br>
[0022] Referring again to the process depicted in Figure 2, the PPP communication<br>
between the MS 110 and PDSN 160 is symmetrical, and takes place between a PPP<br>
"stack" in each of MS 110 and PDSN 160. PCF 150 is a conduit for the PPP messaging<br>
between MS 110 and PDSN 160. Therefore, a set of an LCP configuration request 220<br>
and an LCP configuration response 221 messages is initiated by PDSN 160, and another<br>
set of an LCP configuration request 222 and an LCP configuration response 223<br>
messages is initiated by MS 110. Further LCP configuration requests 224,226 and LCP<br><br>
configuration response 225 messages are exchanged between MS 110 and PDSN 160 as a<br>
way of negotiating the details and form of the data session.<br>
[0023] Following a successful LCP configuration sequence, signals 230, 232 are<br>
exchanged between PDSN 160 and any or both of the home agent 180 and AAA server<br>
190 to determine subscriber use, authorization, and billing information. Data session<br>
setup also normally involves password authorization protocol (Ack) messages 240 and IP<br>
control protocol messages 242 to determine subscriber access and IP address information<br>
for MS 110. Following successful establishment of the data session, MS 110 can<br>
exchange user-level data in the form of digitized packets encapsulated in the A10-PPP<br>
protocols. It can be appreciated that user-level (e.g. Web browsing) data transactions<br>
must wait until several control and session establishment steps are successfully complete.<br>
Therefore, delays in data session establishment, which can occur because of the LCP<br>
configuration race condition, translate into delays getting data to and from MS 110.<br>
[0024] One way of treating the above-mentioned race condition is to purposely delay<br>
the sending of the first LCP configurationirequest message 220 by PDSN 160. This can<br>
be accomplished by building in a set or programmable time delay (e.g., 100 milliseconds)<br>
that would provide PCF 150 with sufficient time to establish air link 215 with MS 110<br>
before attempting to deliver initial LCP configuration request message 220. In this way,<br>
air link 215 can be made ready, and initial LCP configuration request message 220 is not<br>
lost, avoiding the (3 second) time-out condition. Thus, by waiting 100 milliseconds in<br>
this example to send LCP configuration request message 220, the system will establish a<br>
successful data session almost 3 seconds sooner than if the initial LCP configuration<br>
request message 220 was transmitted by PDSN 160 without waiting.<br><br>
[0025] Refer to Figure 3, which illustrates a portion of the data session establishment<br>
process shown in Figure 2. PCF 150 and PDSN 160 exchange the earlier-mentioned A11<br>
registration request 210 and reply 212. Then, before allowing PDSN 160 to send out the<br>
initial LCP configuration request 220, PDSN 160 waits for a period of time t1 to allow air<br>
link 215 to be established. During the wait time period, PDSN 160 refrains from sending<br>
initial LCP configuration request 220. The wait time t1 may be a pre-determined fixed<br>
time, or a time determined on the basis of some network condition. t1 could be stored or<br>
calculated within PCF 150 and/or PDSN 160. It should be noted that, in this<br>
embodiment, ti is not necessarily decided by the actual duration of time it takes to<br>
establish a particular air link, but rather by an appropriate duration that would reasonably<br>
be expected to allow for an air link 215 to be established in most or all instances in a<br>
given network configuration. Wait time t1 is provided to PDSN 160 or stored therein.<br>
[0026] The set or programmable waittime t\ can be made to depend on factors such<br>
as IP addresses of the communicating components, their physical or network separation,<br>
environmental, network conditions, etc., and the wait time can be stored in a look-up table<br>
or calculated dynamically using some algorithm. To achieve further perfornxance gains,<br>
this embodiment can be programmed so that if any data packets are received by PDSN<br>
160 from the MS 110/PCF150 client, then PDSN 160 should immediately proceed with<br>
the transmission of messages to the MS 110/PCF150 client, as it is established that air<br>
link 215 is up and operational. Therefore, there is no need for an initial wait period if it is<br>
clear that an air link has already been set up.<br>
[0027] Wait time t1 can also be determined by PDSN 160 "pinging" (sending a test<br>
signal to) PCF 150 and calculating the network propagation time from the time it takes to<br>
get a response to its ping. Those skilled in the art will appreciate various methods for<br><br>
determining network conditions and signal propagation times for use in the wait time<br>
determination. Still another factor that can be used in determining the appropriate wait<br>
time would be from knowledge of MS 110's radio access technology, which can be<br>
signaled using the 3GPP2's "service option" in the A11 registration request message 210.<br>
[0028] Alternatively, two different LCP retransmit wait times may be defined<br>
depending on the status of the data session. A first retransmit wait time t1 for resending<br>
the initial LCP configure request 220 if a first attempt to do so is unsuccessful, and a<br>
second retransmit wait time t2 before renegotiating a session that was interrupted by an<br>
error in the ordinary course of communication.<br>
[0029] Refer to Figure 4, which illustrates establishment of a data session, data<br>
packet communication, a communication error event 300, error recovery, and subsequent<br>
renegotiation of the failed session. PCF150 and PDSN 160 exchange the earlier-<br>
mentioned A11 registration request 210 and reply 212. The initial LCP configuration<br>
request 220 from PDSN 160 is sent before air link 215 is established, and is lost. PDSN<br>
160 then waits a short (e.g. 10-100 milliseconds) wait time t1 and retransmits an LCP<br>
configuration request 220a. As air link 215 is not yet established, PDSN 160 waits yet<br>
another time duration t1 and retransmits yet another LCP configuration request 220b.<br>
PDSN 160 repeats its attempts to deliver the LCP configuration request until an air link<br>
215 is established and its attempts succeed or another abort event occurs. In the example<br>
of Figure 4, an air link 215 is established after two unsuccessful attempts, and LCP<br>
configuration request 220b is successfully delivered. This phase of the session took<br>
approximately two t1 periods (e.g., 200 milliseconds) instead of the long (e.g., 3 second)<br>
time-out duration of presently used systems. Any redundant LCP request messages sent<br>
following successful session initiation can then be ignored by the PPP stacks. Once air<br><br>
link 215 and the data session are operationally negotiated, data packets can be exchanged<br>
as is commonly done in CDMA-2000 systems.<br>
[0030] Now assume an error event 300 occurs in the normal course of<br>
communication. Unlike the missed initial (session establishment) LCP configuration<br>
packets, dropped data packets in the course of data session communication usually<br>
indicate a substantive fault condition that takes a finite reset time (time-out) from which<br>
to recover. Therefore, a longer wait time t2 (e.g. 1-3 seconds) is used before attempting to<br>
renegotiate the session to allow for recovery from the error condition. PDSN 160 waits<br>
the period t2 and sends a new LCP configuration request 320 and receives a LCP<br>
configuration reply 321 in the same or similar way that the initial LCP configuration<br>
exchange 220-221 was made.<br>
[0031] It should be appreciated that the two short wait times t1 of Figure 4 are not<br>
necessarily identical. Figure 5 illustrates an embodiment similar to that of Figure 4,<br>
except that the two short wait times (indicated as t1 and t1a) are not of equal duration. In<br>
this embodiment, each of wait times t1 t1a, and t2 are of a different duration.<br>
[0032] Another embodiment provides a buffer within PCF 150 to prevent loss of<br>
initial LCP configuration request packet 220 or any other early data packets that precede<br>
establishment of air link 215. Here any data packets received from PDSN 160 are held in<br>
a queue/buffer while PCF 150 establishes the required air link with the appropriate MS<br>
110. In some specific situations, PCF 150 may hold the data packets in the buffer until<br>
the initial A11 LCP registration-request and registration-reply sequence is complete.<br>
[0033] Refer to Figure 6, which illustrates a data session setup process where PCF<br>
150 has a buffer 400 that stores data packets 402 sent by PDSN 160 while PCF 150<br>
establishes radio air link 215 with MS 110. Therefore, when air link 215 is delayed, data<br><br>
(including LCP configuration request 220) from PPSN 160 are not lost. The data can be<br>
delivered to MS 110 following establishment of air link 215.<br>
[0034] In the above examples, a time-based "trigger" was used to cause PDSN 160 to<br>
send its initial LCP configuration request signal 220 to MS 110/PCF150. It is also<br>
possible to use an event-triggered mode (e.g. waiting for a "Go"-signal) to control<br>
sending the initial LCP configuration request signal 220 to MS 110/PCF 150.<br>
[0035] One such embodiment uses optional "Air Link Start" information (e.g., in the<br>
A11 registration request message 210 from PCF 150 to PDSN 160) to trigger sending the<br>
initial LCP configuration request packet 220 so request 220 will not be sent prematurely<br>
and be lost. The Air Link Start information tells PDSN 160 that an air link has actually<br>
been established. In some cases, it can be inferred from the absence of the Air Link Start<br>
message that an air link does not yet exist, and that sending the initial LCP configuration<br>
request 220 would probably result in loss of the request 220 and delays in establishing the<br>
data session. Therefore, it is possible to introduce a wait time (e.g., 100 milliseconds)<br>
when PDSN 160 does not receive an Air Link Start signal with the Al 1 registration<br>
request message 210 to allow for the air link to be established. Note that the Air Link<br>
Start message can also be delivered to PDSN 160 subsequent to the Al 1 registration<br>
request message 210, for example, in a subsequent A11 request message sent by PCF 150<br>
to PDSN 160.<br>
[0036] In the event that PDSN 160 does not receive an "Air Link Start" message 700<br>
after waiting same predetermined time, PDSN 160 may nonetheless send LCP<br>
configuration request 220. Therefore, various embodiments provided herein are<br>
compatible with one another and may be used in combination.<br><br>
[0037] Refer to Figure 7, which illustrates a process for establishing a data session,<br>
including a step of sending Air Link Start signal 700 from PCF 150 to PDSN 160 only<br>
after air link 215 is established. Upon receiving Air Link Start signal 700, PDSN 160<br>
sends its initial LCP configuration request 220 as discussed previously. This avoids<br>
sending the initial LCP configuration request 220 too early, which might result in a delay<br>
in session establishment due to the time-out described above.<br>
[0038] It should be appreciated that the systems and concepts described herein apply<br>
not only to data conxmunication, but may also apply to other types of communication<br>
carried over systems sharing enough characteristics with those described above in the<br>
context of CDMA-2000 and 3G systems. In some respects, this includes the Mobile IP-<br>
based wireless systems. Additionally, numerous auxiliary communication and telephony<br>
functions and features may be included in the systems or methods described herein.<br>
[0039] Upon review of the present description and embodiments, those skilled in the<br>
art will understand that modifications and equivalent substitutions may be performed in<br>
carrying out the invention without departing from the essence of the invention. Thus, the<br>
invention is not meant to be limited by the embodiments described explicitly above;<br>
rather it should be construed by the scope of the claims that follow.<br>
