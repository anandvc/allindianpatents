DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
		Hydrocarbons are subjected to a variety of physical and chemical processes to<br>
	produce higher value products. These processes include fractionation, isomerization, bond<br>
	dissociation and reformation, purification, and increasing hydrogen content. The processes<br>
15 	tend to require high pressures and temperatures. Catalysts are employed in the processes for<br>
	various reasons including, but not limited to, reducing the temperatures and pressures at<br>
	Which the hydrocarbon conversion Teaction takes place. The term "hydroprocessing' is used<br>
	to refer to the encornpassing superset of these processes in which hydrogen is used.<br>
		Petroleum or crude oil is a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbons and smaller<br>
20	amounts of organic compounds containing heteroatoms such as sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen, and<br>
	metals (mostly nickel and vanadium). The petroleum products obtained from crude oil<br>
	processing vary considerably, depending on market demand, crude oil quality, and refinery<br>
	objectives. In current industrial practices, crude oils are submitted to distillation under<br>
	atmospheric pressure and under vacuum. The distillation fractions (including the residual<br>
25	 fractions) undergo further catalytic refining processes so high-value products can be<br>
	produced.<br>
		The hydrogen content of petroleum products is an important index of their economic<br>
	value. In conventional hydrocracking and hydrotreating processes, the hydrogenation<br>
	reactions of aromatic compounds play a crucial role. Heavy residual compounds are<br>
30	 normally aromatic in nature. The complete or partial saturation of these compounds by<br>
	hydrogen addition is an important step in their cracking into smaller, more valuable<br>
	compounds. Conventional heavy oil hydrocracking processes require relatively high<br>
	temperature (e.g. greater than 400Â°C) and very high pressure (e.g. greater than 1000 psi). In<br>
	current hydrotreating and hydroreforming processes, supported Ni-Mo and Co-Mo sulfided<br>
1<br><br>
	WO 2004/033205 							PCT/US2003/032587<br>
	catalysts "become active only at the high temperature range. In order for reactions to take<br>
	place at a favorable lower temperature range, expensive noble metal catalysts are usually<br>
	used in order to achieve good hydrogenation efficiency. Attempts have been made to find<br>
	new classes of catalysts that would signiflcantly lower the process parameters, while<br>
5 	increasing, the hydrogenation efficiency in terms of deep reduction of aromatic content, but<br>
	the progress made thus far is mostly small improvements over existing catalyst systems.<br>
		As the name implies, hydrocracking combines catalytic cracking and hydrogenation<br>
	by means of a bifunctional catalyst lo accomplish a number of favorable transformations of<br>
	partcular value for the selected feedstocks. In a typical bifunctional catalyst, the cracking<br>
10 	function is provided by an acidic support, whereas the hydrogenation function is provided, by<br>
	noble rnetals, or non-noble metal sulfides from Periodic Table Groups 6, 9, and 10 (based on<br>
	the 1990 IUPAC system in which the columns are assigned the numbers 1 to 18).<br>
	Hydrocracking is a versatile process for converting a variety of feedstocks, ranging from<br>
	raphthas through heavy gas oils, into useful products. Its most unqiue characteristic involves<br>
15 	the hydrogenation and breakup of polynuciear aiomatics. Significant portions of these<br>
	feedstocks are converted through hydroeracking into smaller-sized and more useful product<br>
	constituents. However, some of the large aromatic complexes within these feedstocks, once<br>
	partially hydrogenated via hydrocracking, can proceed to dehydnogenate forming coke on the<br>
	catalyses, Coke formation is ora of many deactivation mechanisma that reduce catalyst life.<br>
20 		In many refineries, the hydrocracker serves as the major supplier of jet and diesei fuel<br>
	components (middle distillates). Because of the htgh pressure required and hydrogen<br>
	consumption, conventional hydrocrackers are very costly to build and to operate. By<br>
	developing a class of catalysts with high, selectivity for middle distillates and favorable<br>
	operating conditions, it is possible to significantly reduce these high costs while maximizing<br>
25 	the production of the middle distillates.<br>
		To remove undesirable heteroatoms, desutfruization, denitrogenation, and<br>
	dernetallization processes are also accomplished using hydroprocessing methods. Because<br>
	the values of petroleum products are directly related to their hydiogen contents, the affective<br>
	hydrogenation of products is highly desirable in all stages of petroleum refining.<br>
30 		Metals, such as platinum, deposited on oxide supports, such as alumina or silica, are<br>
	widely used in catalysts for hydrocarbon reforming reactions. The deposited metal provides<br>
	reactive sites at which the desired reactions can occur. However, catalysts using these metals<br>
	have the problem of being rendered inactive if heavy polyaromatic organic compounds build<br>
	up and occupy or block the sites. The removal of sulfur and sulfur compounds are also a<br>
2<br><br>
	WO 2004/033205 							PCT/US2003/032587<br>
	problem for these catalysts. Sulfur reacts with the catalytic sites of Pt or Pd metals and can<br>
	also deactivate these sites by chemically binding to the metals. Successful catalysis requires<br>
	that a suitable high local concentration of hydrogen be maintained during the catalytic<br>
	process. Pressure and temperature conditions are selected to favor formation of the desired<br>
5 	product, to provide a suitable rate of conversion, and to avoid rapid deactivation of the<br>
	catalytic surface.<br>
	Hydroprocessing catalysts and their respective components can take many forms and<br>
	structures. Much is known about optimizing catalyst performance for specific processes<br>
	(e.g., hydrogenation, hydrocraking, hydrodemetallization and hydrodesulfrrization).<br>
10 	Regarding the catalyst form, the catalyst can be used as a powder, extrudate, or preformed<br>
	matrix based upon the type of chemical reactor design selected (e.g., fluidized bed; fixed bed,<br>
	catalytic converter).<br>
	An overall need remains, however, for improved catalysts and catalytic<br>
	hydroprocesses that can be carried out under relatively mild conditions,<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
		The present invention is directed to catalysts containing interstitial metal hydrides,<br>
	having reaction surfaces at which monatomic hydrogen is available, and to any catalytic<br>
	processes making use of these materials. The interstitial metal hydrides of the present<br>
4<br><br>
	WO 2004/033205 							PCT/US2003/032587	<br>
	invention (now specifically being defined as iMeH) are composed of alloyed metals<br>
	combined with atomic hydrogen that is stored interstitially within their metal alloy matrix-<br>
	These interstitial metal hydrides (iMeH), when configured according to ihe present invention<br>
	comprise a catalyst capable of absorbing molecular hydrogen, and reacting monatomic<br>
5	hydrogen at the reaction surface. The catalysts of the present invention have reaction<br>
	surfaces that may be kept substantially free of an oxide layer. Undesirable oxide species can<br>
	inhibit the manatomic hydrogen, from participating in the catalytic process. Production of an<br>
	oxide layer is avoided, and reaction surfaces are Kept substantially free of an oxide layer, by<br>
	minimizing exposure of the catalyst to oxygen or water vapor at elevated temperatures, such<br>
10 	as temperatures above 30Â°C, Exposure to oxygen and water vapor is minimized by<br>
	surrounding the catalyst with a blanketing atmosphere of an inert gas such as nitrogen or<br>
	argon which has been exposed to a desiccant. It has been found that the monatoniic hydrogen<br>
	concentration at the catalyst surface is maximized by exclusion of onygen and water vapor at<br>
	elevated temperatires, Monatomic hidrogen as the iMeH catalyst suface is monatomic<br>
15 	hydrogen in close enough proximity to the surface to react, in the monatomic form. with a<br>
	feedstock in contact with the surface.<br>
		In use, the interstitial metal hydride can be directly combined with the feedstock, at<br>
	reaction temperatures, or the iMeH may be first formed into a composite with other materials<br>
	to further enhance catalytic activity. The catalytic process of the present invention includes<br>
20	contacting the feedstock with a catalyst comprising an interstitial metal hydride, having a<br>
	reaction surface, to produce a catalyst-feedstock mixture, applying energy to an least one of<br>
	the catalyst and the catalyst-feedstock mixture, producing monatomic hydrogen at the<br>
	reaction surface of the interstitial metal hydride, and reacting the feedstock with the<br>
	monatomic hydrogen. In one embodiment of the invention, the feedstock is an organic<br>
25	compound.<br>
		Again, the interstitial metal hydrides are composed of alloyed metals combined with<br>
	atomic hydrogen, which is stored interstitially within the metal alloy rnatrix. This matrix can<br>
	have a crystalline or amorphous structure. The iMeH is especially suited to accommodating<br>
	atomic hydrogen, abstracted from molecular hydrogen. The quantity of atomic hydrogen in<br>
30 	the interstitial metallic hydrides has a measurable value, which is a function of alloy<br>
	composition, and operating temperature and pressure. The hydrogen stored within iMeH<br>
	is not subject to ionic or covalent bondjrng. In an iMeH the ratio of hydrogen to metal atoms<br>
	may vary over a range and may not be expressible as a ratio of small whole numbers. The<br>
	iMeH compounds of the present invention are able to dissociate diatomic hydrogen molecufes<br>
5<br><br>
	WO 2004/033205 							PCT/US2003/032587<br>
	at the surface into monalomic hydrogen, absorb copious amounts of monatomic hydrogen<br>
	thus produced, and desorb the monalornic hydrogen under the appropriate conditions. A heat<br>
	of absorption is produced when the molecular hydrogen dissociates into atomic hydrogen and<br>
	the hydrogen atoms position themselves interstilially in the structure of the material.<br>
5 	Additional energy at a suitable steady state process temperature and pressure is required for<br>
	the release of monatomic hydrogen from within the catalyst. This energy can be derived<br>
	from the process heat of reaction or from external application of energy or both. The atomic<br>
	hydrogen thus provided is available to promote hydroprocsssing and hydrogenation reactions,<br>
	Without intending to be limited by the theory, the catalyst's activity of the preseat invention<br>
10 	is believed to be due to the high concentration of available monatomic hydrogenl which the<br>
	iMeH uniquely provide by the nature of their dissociation and absorption of molecular<br>
	hydrogen (H:) and subsequent reaction exchange of highly reactive monatomic hydrogen<br>
	(H2) at the surface.<br>
		The catalytic activity of the catalyst of the present invention can be enhanced and<br>
15 	controlled by exposing the cataryst to RF or microwave energy (1000m- l0-4 m<br>
	wavelength), either in the absence or presence of fuel fired heating or resistive heating. The<br>
	RF or microwave energy can provide for a significant increase in hydroprocessing efficiency<br>
	in comparison to conventional beating. Furthermore the microwave energy can be modulated<br>
	and controlled in such a manner as to optimize the reaction exchange of the monatomie<br>
20 	hydrogen from the iMeH, In one embodiment of the invention, the iMeH catalyst component<br>
	is placed in contact with a separate absorber of RF or microwave energy. The separate<br>
	absorber of RF or microwave energy absorbs the energy and transfers it to the iMeK through<br>
	thermol conduction and convection, and may be one or more compounds such as silicon.<br>
	carbide, iron silicide, nickel oxide, and tungsten carbide. In another embodiment of the<br>
25 	invention, the iMeH component functions as the primary absorber of RF or microwave<br>
	energy, When used with microwave enhancement, the iMeH component is sufficiently<br>
	dispersed within the catalyst and feedstock combination to solve the problem of hot spots and<br>
	arcing generally associated with the introduction of metals into a microwave or RF field.<br>
		The selective use of RF or microwave energy to drive the catalytic component of the<br>
30 	catalyst results in the direct reaction of the iMeH monatomic hydrogen im&amp; the feedstock. It<br>
	is cost effective to maximize the use of fossil fuels to pre-heat the feedstocks to near reaction<br>
	temperatures and use minimum RF or microwave energy to drive and control the<br>
	hydroprocessing reactions. Ideally there will be a minimized or zero net temperature increase<br>
6<br><br>
	WO 2004/033205 							PCT/US2003/032587<br>
	from the RF or microwave energy into the catalyst support or into the feedstock because this<br>
	energy is primarily targeted into the iMeH to enhance the reaction exchange of monatomic<br>
	hydrogen. Selective coupling of the RF or microwave energy is accomplished through<br>
	selection and control of the relative dielectric parameters of the catalyst's components and the<br>
5 	feedstock. This results id efficient, economically viable catalytic processes, which are<br>
	enhanced using microwaves.<br>
		The catalyst of the present invention may be used in all types of hydroprocesses or as<br>
	a more specific example to hydrosrack organic compounds. In these processes, the<br>
	feedstock, e.g, organic compounds, are contacted with an iMeH catalyst comprising a metal<br>
10 	hydride capable of releasing monatomic hydrogen at its surface. The c ombinanon of the<br>
	iMeH and feedstocks may be exposed to any number of process conditions, (such as<br>
	temperature, pressure, and space velocity) suitable for a desired hydroprocessing reaction.<br>
		The catalyst enables hydroprocessing at milder conditions, and significantly lower<br>
	pressures. High reactivity, lower process pressures, and new degrees of selectivity and<br>
15	 control using RF or microwaves provide for improved products and lower capital equipment<br>
	and operating costs.<br>
		In the present invention, iMeH catalyst compositions having the following<br>
	characteristics have been specifically identified:<br>
			Â·	High hydrogen storage capacity (Range from 0,01 wt% - 7,5 wt% hydrogen in<br>
20				catalyst)<br>
			Â·	High molecular hydrogen absorption and monatotnie hydrogen reaction rates<br>
				(greater than 0,01 cc/min/gm,), for given, temperature or pressure changes.<br>
				Typical operating pressures and temperatures can range from ambient to 1000<br>
				psig and ambient to 600Â°C. A typical value for hydrogen reaction rates is 1<br>
25 				cc/min/gm, and materials have been measured with values greater than 50<br>
				cc/min/gm,<br>
			Â·	Temperature-dependent desorption pressure<br>
			Â·	Ability to undergo repeated hydrogenation cycling<br>
			Â·	Tolerance for impurities<br>
30.			Â·	Using the invention disclosed herein, iMeH catalysts with high reaction rates<br>
				can be designed for operation up to 3000 psi and 600oC-<br>

	WO 2004/033205 							PCT/US2003/032587<br>
		The monatomic hydrogen provided in the presence of an iMeH catatyst permits higher<br>
	reaction rales and milder reaction conditions to be used for a given process.<br>
		It is known that Pt and Pd dissociate molecular hydrogen into monatomic hydrogen<br>
	when it is adsorted onto the surface of these metals, The iMeH material; of the present<br>
5 	invention have this property as well The iMeH materials also store or absorb the dissociated<br>
	molecular hydrogen into the bulk of the iMeH matrix as monatomic hydrogen whereas metals<br>
	such as platinum do not.<br>
		Interstitial metal hydrides are produced by preparing samples of the constituent metals<br>
	in the desired proportions, and combining them and heating them so that they melt together<br>
10 	homogeneously to produce a metal alloy. The resulting metal alloy is then exposed to<br>
	hydrogen at a temperature and pressure characteristic of the alloy so that the metal alloy takes<br>
	up the hydrogen in monatomic form.<br>
		The iMeH materials of the present invention are typically prepared by a volumetric<br>
	(gas to solid alloy) method at a known temperature and pressure using a skinless sted<br>
15 	reactor. The metallic hydride will abserb hydrogen with an exothermic reaction, This<br>
	hydrogenation process is reversible according to the following chemical reaction schematic.<br><br>
	During this process, hydrogen atoms will occupy interstitial siles in the alloy lattice.<br>
		The meta! alloy fom which an iMeH is produced can be prepared by mechanical or<br>
20 	induction heated alloying processes. The metal alloy can be stoichiometrio or hyper-<br>
	stoichiometric. Hyper-stoichiometric compounds are compounds that exhibit wide<br>
	compositional variations from ideal stoichiometry. Hyper-stoichiometric systems contain<br>
	excess elements, which can significantly influence the phase stability of the metallic<br>
	hydrides. The iMeH is produced from a metal alloy by subjecting the alloy to hydrogen at a<br>
25 	pressure and temperatures that is a characteristic of the particular alloy.<br>
		The iMeH catalysis of the present invention can be selected to have a desired lartice<br>
	structure and thermodynamic properties, such as the applied pressure and temperature at<br>
	which they can be charged and the operating pressure and temperature at which they can be<br>
	discharged. These working thermodynamic parameters can be modified and fine tuned by an<br>
30 	appropriate alloying method and therefore, the composition of the catalysts can be designed<br>
	for use in a particular catalytic process.<br>
		The present invention is directed to catalysis containing interstitial metal hydrides,<br>
	These hydrides are composed of alloyed metais combined with monatomic hydrogen that is<br>
8<br><br>
	WO 2004/033205 							PCT/US2003/032587<br>
	stored interstitially within their metal alloy matrix. Multi-component metal alloys from<br>
	which the iMeH catalysts of the present invention are produced include combinations of<br>
	Group 4 elements with Group 5, 6, 7, S, 9, 10 and 11 elements (based or the 1990 UPAC<br>
	system in which the columns are assigned the numbers 1 to 18). Also iMeH catalysts of this<br>
5 	invention may be produced from alloys including all combinations of lanthanides (atomic<br>
	numbers 58 to 71) with Group 7, 8,9, 10 and-11 elements. For example; the alloy maybe<br>
	AxTy in which A is one or more Group 4 elements and T is one or more Group 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 10<br>
	and 11 elements, in another example, A is one or more lanthanides and T is one or more<br>
	Group 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 elements. X and y are the composition values for the different<br>
10 	elements in each series, Thess alloys may taks the form of crystalline or amorphous fine<br>
	powders, and the resulting interstitial metal hydrides have properties making them useful for<br>
	hydroprecessing reactions in which the operating temperature ranges from ambient (20Â°C) to<br>
	1000Â°C and operating hydrogen pressures in the range from ambient (15 psi) to 2000 psi.<br>
		The iMeH serves as a high density source of interstitial monatomic reactive hydrogen<br>
15 	and can be combined with known hydroproecssing catalysts such as noble metals metal<br>
	oxides, metal sulfides, zeolitic acid or base sites to further promote hydreprocessing of<br>
	feedstocks suth as organic tompo^wi^. The iMeH materials can be combined with other<br>
	hydroprocessing materials in a variety of ways to build an optimized catalyst for a particular<br>
	reaction or function. In general, the finer the powders being mixed (e.g. support, iMeH), the<br>
20 	higher the surface area and the more intimate the mixing. Key to the processing steps is to<br>
	minimize the exposure of iMeH to oxygen and/or water vapor at etevated temperatures<br>
	(above 25"C) for extended periods of time. Exposure can be minimized by use of desiccants<br>
	and by blanketing atmospheres of inert gases such as nitrogen and argon. The iMeH is not<br>
	calcined or sunjected to an oxidiaitig environmem at elevated temperatures.<br>
25 		Hydreprocessing catalysts and their respective components can take many forms and}<br>
	structures. Much is known about optimizing catalyst performance based upon process<br>
	requirements (e.g., hydrogenation, hydrocracking, hydrodesulfurization (HDS),<br>
	hydrodemetallization (HDM), and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN). For example, the catalyst<br>
	can be used as a powder, extrudate, or preformed matrix based upon the type of reactor<br>
30 	design selected (e.g,, fltudized bed, fixed bed, catalytic converter, etc)<br>
		The simplest iMeH catalyst is the iMeH powder itself. In this case the iMeH provides<br>
	monatomic hydrogen and is the catalyst for hydroprocessing. The process and reactor<br>
	hardware are more complex than in a fixed catalyst bed process.<br>

		The iMeH catalysts of the present invention, when used in powder form, may be<br>
	mixed and dispersed within the feedstock and transported through a reactor (e.g. slurry<br>
	reactor). After the desired reaction has been catalyzed in the reactor, the iMeH powder is<br>
	then separated from the reaction products for reuse.<br>
5 		An iMeH can be combined with a support and optionally other catalytic elements to<br>
	produce a composite catalyst. The support provides for the physical dispersion of iMeH,<br>
	providing greater surface area and ease of handling. The support also serves to increase the<br>
	surface area of the active catalytic elements and thereby increase the process reaction rates.<br>
	The support also serves to disperse the metallic or metal oxide catalytic sites so as to prevent<br>
10 	arcing in the presence of a strong electric or magnetic fields that may be used to expedite<br>
	catalytic action.<br>
		The iMeH compounds of the present invention can be utilized in a crystalline or<br>
	amorphous form. The support may be composed of an inorganic oxide, a metal, a carbon, or<br>
	combinations of these materials. The iMeH phases and catalytic elements can be dispersed as<br>
15.	mechanically mixed powders, or can be chemieally dispersed, impregnated or deposited.<br>
	When mixed powders are used in the present invention the powder particle size is controlled<br>
	to provide a powder that has particles that are small enough to provide suitable surface area<br>
	and reactivity, but not so fine as to produce significant surface oxidation, In one<br>
	embodiment, particles used in the catalyst of the present invention have diameters ranging<br>
20 	from about 0.01 micrometers to about 1000 micrometers, from about 0.1 micrometers to<br>
	about 100 micrometers, or from about 1 micrometer to about 10 micrometers. Nanosize<br>
	powders and nanostructural elements containing an iMeH have also been found to be useful.<br>
	The other catalytic elements may be known catalysts such as noble metals such as platinum<br>
	or palladium, metal oxides, metal suifides, and zeolite acid or base sites; these additional<br>
25 	catalytic elements can further promote hydroprocessing. A hydropnocessmg component and<br>
	a hydrocracking component used in combination with the iMeH may be one or more of these<br>
	catalytic elements. Both the combination of an iMeH powder with a support, which can<br>
	provide an additional catalyst function (i.e. at catalytically active or inert support), or an<br>
	iMeH dispersed onto a hydroprocessing catalytic powder; can be especially effective for<br>
30 hydracracking in an FCC type of Fluidized bed reactor.<br>
		The [MeH catalysts of the present invention can also be coated onto an extrudate,<br>
	typically formed from a mixed metal oxide such as alumina or silica. This method has<br>
	practical manufacturing advantages, provides a uniform coating, and yielos a high iMeH<br>
	surface area. The iMeH can be coated onto the spheres, pellets, rings, cylinders, and<br>
10<br><br>
	WO 2004/033205 							PCT/US2003/032587<br>
	extrudates of other shapes, including 3-lobed and 4-lobed extrudates, of which commercial<br>
	catalysts are typically farmed. The iMeH catalysis can also be incorporated into the body of<br>
	the extrudate. A powder of iMeH may be mixed with inert support powder, such as silica or<br>
	alumina, or a commercial hydroprocessing catalyst, commercial hydrotreating catalyst; or<br>
5 	commercial hydrocracking catalyst ground to a fine powder- The mixed powder is combined<br>
	with a binder and extruded. Fine powder large pore alumina coated with metal sulfides such<br>
	as COMOSX, or zeolite powder coated with a noble metal such as palladium or platinum may<br>
	also be combined with iMeH in this fashion.<br>
		The order of catalyst fabrication is based on minimizing exposure of the iMeH to<br>
10 	oxygen or water vapor. It has been found that chemically coating a mixed metal oxide form,<br>
	such as an extrudate, with iMeH has several manufacturing advantages, provides for a more<br>
	uniform coating, and should yield the highest practical iMeH surface area,<br>
		In a typical process for the production of a catalyst of the present invention<br>
	incorporating an extrudate, the raw inorganic oxides materials are extruded and calcined, the<br>
15 	extrudate is chemically coated with hydroprocessing metals such as Ni/Mo or Pd and the<br>
	resulting combination is calcined. Finally the extrudate is chemically coated with an iMeH<br>
	and treated with hydrogen.<br>
		The iMeH of the present invention can be combined by many means with existing<br>
	hydroprocessing catalysts or components.<br>

	invention. detailing the iMeH powder processing steps prior to mixing with the<br>
	hydropmcessing catalyst powder. A metal alloy, of selected composition, is first exposed to<br>
	hydrogen to produce an Interstitial metal hydride structure. Based on available equipment, the<br>
	iMeH is then reduced to powder form, under an inert or hydrogen atmosphere using any one<br>
25 	of several conventional powder processing techniques known to those skilled in the arts.<br>
	alternatively, the metal alloy can first be made into a powder and then exposed to hydrogen<br>
	to produce iMeH powder. The iMeH powder is then intimately mixed with a<br>
	hydroprocessing catalyst powder and formed into a catalyst structure. The catalyst may take<br>
	the form of an extrudate (including three-lobed and fout-lobed forms), sphere, pellet, ring,<br>
30 	cylinder, or odier shapes, including a powder of particle size differing from the powder sizes<br>
	of the starting powders - After forming, the iMeH is activated by exposure to hydrogen at<br>
	temperaiure and pressure appropriate to the iMeH composition.<br>

		Fig, 2 depicts the process steps, as an example, in the production of a catalyst of the<br>
	present invention in which an iMeH powder is mixed with a hydroproeessing catalyst<br>

10 	requirements. The iMeH coating can be produced by methods including but not limited to,<br>
	chemical vapor deposition (CVD), chemical coating, ion implating, and sputtering<br>
	Kydrotreating catalyst or hydrocracking catalyst may be substituled for the hydroprocessing<br>
	catalyst.<br>
		Fig. 4 depicts the process steps in the production of a catalyst detailing but not<br>
15 	limiting the present invention in which an iMeH is coated on a hydroprocessing catalyst<br>
	form. The hydroprocessing catalyst form can be manufactured, by those skilled in the art,<br>
	based upon process requirements. Fig. 4 elaborates sevetal possibilities consisting of a<br>
	support form coated with a noble metal catalyst and/or a metal sulfide such as NiMoSx.<br>
		Properties of the support such as porosity Pore size distnbution, surface area and<br>
20 	acidity are selected on the basis of the feedstock and the selected hydroprocess. For low<br>
	molecular weight organic compounds, microporous supports are appropriate because they<br>
	offer fine pore size and high surface area. For heavier organic compounds a larger pore meso<br>
	and/or macroporous catalyst structure are requirtd to allow the larger molecular size organic<br>
	compounds to enter, The acidity can be adjusted to a level suitable for the particuler process<br>
25 being catalyzed.<br>
		The iMeH can be combined with or placed in proximity to one or more additional<br>
	catalytic elements or components, such as a cracking catalyst or a hydroprocessing catalyst.<br>
	This combination reduces the severity of the conditions required for hydroprocessing. Pd,<br>
	Ni/MO, W, and Co/Mo catalysts are examples of materials that can function as these<br>
30 	additional catalytic elements or components. The support function and additional catalytic<br>
	properties can be combined in a single substance. The iMeH may, if it is placed in close<br>
	enough contact with the additional catalytic elements, supply them with monatomic<br>
	hydrogen, thereby increasing their catalytic activity. The additional catalytic elements need<br>
12<br><br>
	WO 2004/033205 							PCT/US2003/032587<br>
	not be capable of storing monatomic hydrogen in their matrix to exhibit increased catalytic<br>
	activity through the donation of montomic hydrogen from the iMeH.<br>
		Another means of increasing catalytic activity is by enhancement through the<br>
	hydrogen spillover effct. Without intending to be limited by this description, the hydrogen<br>
5 	spillover effect generally refers to the phenomenon when adsorbed hydrogen on the catalyst<br>
	(metal) surface migrates to a nearby catalynic site, or into the interstitial volume of the<br>
	support. The iMeH produces monatomic hydrogen, which may not be immediately reacted<br>
	with, but not limited to, the organic compound feed. Noble metal catalysts such as palladium<br>
	and platinum can assist the migration of the reactive monatomic hydrogen. These noble<br>
10 	metals have been shown to be novel promoters in combination with iMeH thereby increasing<br>
	the catalytic effect. This is thought to be due to the hydrogen spillover effect, which<br>
	increases the effective catalyst surface area.<br>
		A specific example of such a combined catalyst contains zeolite, palladium and iMeH<br>
	which can enhance hydrogen reaction. iMeH in powder form has a lower surface area<br>
15 	compared to chemically coated palladium on the zeolite support. The iMeH in powder form<br>
	can be an Order of magnitude larger in size than the palladium particles dispersed on the<br>
	suppon. The catalytic reaction site is thought to be extended beyond the surface of the iMeH<br>
	through the transport of the rnonatomic hydrogen by means of the palladium enhanced<br>
	hydrogen spillover effect.<br>
20 		Monatomic hydrogen is a highly reactive species and will react with many species as<br>
	well as with another hydrogen alom to form molecular hydrogen. Therefore, intimate contact<br>
	between the iMeH and the feedstock being hydroprocessed has been found to oe significant<br>
	for example, if an oxide layer exists on the iMeH surface, the rnonatomic hydrogen is likely<br>
	to react within the oxide layer before it encounters and reacts with a feedstock molecule. The<br>
25 	iMeH used in the present invention is essentially free from surface oxides; an iMeH having a<br>
	significant oxide coating cannot supply any significant amounts of monatomic hydrogen to a<br>
	chemical process occurring on the oxide coating. The extent of the zone in which monatomic<br>
	hydrogen can be found near the iMeH surface changes with process conditions that affect the<br>
	mobility and reactivity of the monatomic hydrogen. The surface of the catalyst of the present<br>
30 	invention is kept essentially free of oxides by avoiding exposure of the catalytic surface to<br>
	air any other oxidizing agent or water vapor at elevated temparatures. For certain highly<br>
	reactive catalysts of the present invention, contact with air, any other oxidizing agent or water<br>
	vapor is avoided at ambient temperatures as well as elevated temperatures Experimental<br>
	results have confirmed that minimizing the amount of surface oxides present increases the<br>
13<br><br>
	WO 2004/033205 							PCT/US2003/032587<br>
	activity of the catalyst of the present invention. For iMeH powders or dispersions, the finer<br>
	the particle size, the thinner the susface oxide layer requirements. The surface oxide<br>
	thickness should not exceed half the diameter of the iMeH particle, preferably being one<br>
	quarter the diameter or less, optimally being one-tenth the diameter or less, As an example,<br>
5 	with an iMeH particle. With a diameter of one micrometer, the oxide layer would optimally<br>
	be 100 mm or less.<br>
		It has also been found that surface condition of the iMeH is related to the state of<br>
	matter of feedstocks that can be catalyzed. It has been found that the catalysts of the present<br>
	invention are able to process liquid feedstocks as well as gaseous feedstocks,<br>
10 		The present invention has been found to be particularly useful in the hydroprocessing<br>
	of organic compounds at lower pressures than conventional catalysts for a particular process.<br>
		According to the present invention, iMeH catalysts have been found to be of<br>
	particular utility in catalyzing reactions involving the addition or rearrangement of hydrogen<br>
	atoms in chemical species. It is expected that the catalyst of the present invention will<br>
15 	catalyze reactions of inorganic materials in which hydrogen is involved. In particular the<br>
	cracking and hydroprocessing of petrochemicals is expedited by iMeH catalysts. Organic<br>
	compounds are defined as compounds of carbon. Other elements that may be included in<br>
	organic compounds include hydrogen oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, halogens, and<br>
	metals. Classes of organic compounds include aliphatic compounds, including straight chain<br>
20 	and cyclic alkanes, ckefins, and acetylenes, atomatic compounds, including polycyclic<br>
	structures, oxygen bearing compounds, including alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketoncs,<br>
	carboxylic acids, esters, glycerides, and carbohydrates, nitrogen bearing compounds,<br>
	including amines, amides, pyrroles, and porphyrins, sulfur bearing compounds, including<br>
	thiols, sulfides, and thiophenes, phosphorus bearing compounds, including phosphate esters,<br>

	The following terms are used in the description of processes in which the present invention<br>
	can be practiced:<br>
	â¢ 	Hydroprocessing - General term used to describe all catalytic processes involving<br>
		hydrogen. Includes the reaction of any petroleum fraction with hydrogen in the<br>
30 		presence of a catalyst. Examples include hydrocracking, hydrotreating and<br>
		hydrodesulfurization.<br>
14<br><br>
	WO 2004/033205 							PCT/US2003/032587<br>
	Â·	Hydrocracking - A process used to convert heavier feedstocks into lower-boiling,<br>
		higher-value products. The process employs high pressure, high temperature, a<br>
		catalyst, and hydrogen Typically 50% or more of the feed is reduced in molecular<br>
		size.<br>
5 	Â·	Dewaxing - The process of removing waxes from a processed oil stream in order to<br>
		improve low temperature properties. Waxes are high molecular weight saturated<br>
		hydrocarbons or paraffins, typically those that are solids at room temperature.<br>
		Dewaxing, can be accomplished by solvent separation,chilling and filtering. The<br>
		catalytic dewaxing process uses one or two zeolite catalysts to selectively hydrocrack<br>
10 		the waxes into lower molecular weight materials.<br>
	Â· 	Catalytic Dewaxing - A catalytic hydrocracking process which uses molecular sieves<br>
		to selectively hydrocrack the waxes present into hydrocarbon fractions. This process<br>
		is also referred to as hydrodewaxing.<br>
	Â· 	Hydrotreating - Processes which remove undesirable impurities such as sulfur,<br>
15 		nitrogen, motals, and unsaturatcd compounds in the presence of hydrogen and a<br>
		catalyst. In contrast with hydrocracking, essentially none of the feed Is reduced in<br>
		molecular size in hydrotreating.<br>
	Â· 	Hydrodenitrogenation - A hydratreating process in which the nitrogen species which<br>
		are present in heavier distillates are removed.<br>
20 	Â· 	Hydrodcmetalization (HDM) - A hydrotreating process in which metal species,<br>
		typically nickel and vanadium, which are present in heavier distillates are removed.<br>
	Â· 	Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) - A catalytic process in which the principal purpose is to<br>
		remove sulfur from petroleum fractions in the presence of hydrogen.<br>
	Â· 	Feedslock - Petroleum fraction subjected to a treatment process, including<br>
25 		hydroprocessing and cracking.<br>
	Â· 	Cracking - The conversion of feedstocks into fighter products.<br>
		Conventional catalysts show increased activity with increased temperature, and are<br>
	generally subjected to thermally-conducted conventional heating to increase temperatures. <br>
30 	Selected catalysts can also be heated dielectrically. Dielectric heating refers to a broad range<br>
	of electromagnetic heating, either magnetically or electric field coupled, and includes radio<br>
	frequency (RF) heating and microwave heating. It has been found that the value added for<br>
	the process is maximized by using a minimum of dielectrically coupled energy, and by using<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2004/033205 							PCT/US2003/032587<br>
	conventional heat to supplement the total process energy. In a preferred embodiment of the<br>
	present invention, microwave or RF energy is used in conjunction with fuel-fired heating or<br>
	resistive heating. The exclusive use of microwave heating of RF heating, in the absence of<br>
	fuel-fired heating or resistive heating, is not an economically viable process. In the present<br>
5 	process, the primary effect provided by microwave and RF energy is the enhancement of the<br>
	catalyzed chemical reaction, rather than the indirect effect of heating.<br>
		In a preferred embodiment of the present invention when used with microwave<br>
	enhancement, the iMeH is in direct contact with a support; the iMeH functions as the primary<br>
	microwave absorption material and no other microwave absorbing component is needed in<br>
10 	the catalyst. If the iMeH is suitably dispersed, for example in a slurry comprising, a feedstock<br>
	and iMeH, it may be used in the absence of a separate support material.<br>
		The dielectric parameter called the loss tangent is Known by those skilled in the art to<br>
	measure the relative RF or microwave energy that a particular material absorbs at a given<br>
	frequency. The loss tangent, also called the loss factor, is the ratio of the energy lost to the<br>
15 	energy stored, A larger loss targent for a material means that more energy is absorbed<br>
	relative to a material with a lower loss tangent. The dielectric absorption of energy can cause<br>
	ifferent materials to heat, at substantially different cates and to achieve considerably different<br>
	temperarures within the same RF or microwave field.<br>
		The dielectrically absorbed energy can also directly contribute to the process energy<br>
20 	balance. When used to drive an endothermic reaction, such as a cracking reaction, this means<br>
	that if the absorbed RF ar microwave energy equals the heat-of-reaction cracking energy,<br>
	then there will not be a net increase in the bulk temperature for the process. However if more<br>
	RF or microwave energy is absorbed than is necessary for the cracking reaction, or if there is<br>
	a resulting exothermic reaction, e.g, hydrogenation from the release of monatomic hydrogen,<br>
25 	then there will be a net increase in the bulk temperature.<br>
		In the preferred embodiment, for use with microwave and RF enhancement, the iMeH<br>
	catalytic material is selected to have a higher loss factor than the cata1yst support or other<br>
	materials comprising the catalyst. In this preferred embodiment, the iMeH catalyst combines<br>
	the two attributes of; 1) iMeH catalytically active sites and 2) iMeH material being the<br>
30 	primary microwave and RF energy absorber due to its higher loss factor than other materials<br>
	comprising the catalyst. This embodiment of the present invention has been found to produce<br>
	higher reaction efficiencies than previously obtained.<br>
		In another embodiment of the invention, the iMeH is the primary absorber of<br>
	microwave or RF energy, but one or more other secondary microwave absorbing components<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2004/033205 							PCT/US2003/032587<br>
	are present In yet another embodiment of the invention, the iMeH is not the primary<br>
	absorber of microwave or RF energy and does not have the highest loss factor, but the iMeH<br>
	material is in direct thermal contact with materials that are the primary absorbers of<br>
	microwave or RF energy and have higher loss factors.<br>
5 		Loss factors for the bulk iMeH catalyst of 0.30 or less, particularly 0.20 or less, such<br>
	as 0.01 to 0.20, have been found to enhance reactions, while minimizing nonselective heating<br>
	of the foedslock. This consideration for loss factor values maximizes the penetration depth of<br>
	RF or microwaves, enabling the process of the present invention to be carried out on a large<br>
	scale. In the preferred embodiment the loss factor for the iMeH, in combination with the<br>
10 	support or bulk of the catalyst, is greater than that of the feedstock. Therefore the energy<br>
	goes into catalyzing the reaction rather than the nonselective heating of the feedstock. The<br>
	penetration depth is also a function of frequency.<br>
		The combined Use of iMeH catalyst along with microwave or RF energy comprises<br>
	two new process variables with which to optimize catalytic hydroprocessing. The iMeH<br>
15 	serves as a high density source of interstitial monatomic reactive hydrogen. The application<br>
	of microwave or RF energy provides a means of controlling the reaction of iMeH monatomic<br>
	hydrogen with the feedstock. Also, proper application of microwave or RF energy promotes<br>
	higher flux exchange of monatomic hydrogen from the matrix and further enhances the<br>
	hydroprocessiing reactions. This also controls and promotes the adsorption of molecular<br>
20 	hydrogen to be dissociated into monatomic hydrogen. More specifically, the proper<br>
	application includes control of the microwave or RF intensity or field strength, frequency,<br>
	and making use of modulation techniques. Control of these parameters, in particular, using<br>
	any number of modulation tachniques known, to those skilled in the art, for example<br>
	amplitude modulation, frequency modulation and puise width modulation, is of great utility<br>
25 	to precisely control or to maximize the flux exchange of monatomic hydrogen from the iMeH<br>
	to react with organic compounds.<br>
		Altetnatively, the catalyst of the present invention may contain a separate microwave<br>
	absorption material in combination with the iMeH. The support may be catalytically inactive<br>
	or active. If the support is catalytically active, its activity may be enhanced by the production<br>
30 	of monatomic hydrogen by the iMeH, with which the support is in close contact.<br>
		An iMeH catalyst used in combination with microwave energy can be configured in a<br>
	variety of ways to produce a catalyst optimized for a particular reaction or function. If a<br>
	more intimate mixture is desired, so that the iMeH and the support are in closer contact, finer<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2004/033205 							PCT/US2003/032587<br>
	powders, sub-micron or nano-particles, can be used; and would also increase catalytic surface<br>
	area.<br>
		In the present invention, monatomic hydrogen, which can also be described as<br>
	interstitial (dissociated) atomic-hydrogen radicals, from within the matrix of the iMeH is used<br>
5 	for the hydrogenation of organic compounds and their derivatives. These dissociated<br>
	monatomic hydrogen radicals are not covalently or ionically bound to metal atoms within the<br>
	iMeH. The population of these free monatomic hydrogen radicals is generally in equilibrium<br>
	between the interstitial hydrogen of the selected iMeH and its surface. This equilibrium is<br>
	governed by factors of iMeH structure, temperature, pressure, and field strength of the radio<br>
10 	frequency or microwave energy. The absorption of monatomic hydrogen by the crystal<br>
	lattice of the iMeH is an exothermic reaction. The surface monatormc hydrogen radicals, in<br>
	equilibrium with the interstitial matrix of the iMeH, may be directly reacted with organic<br>
	compounds and their derivatives contacted at or near the surface of the iMeH, It is believed,<br>
	without wishing to be bound by this characterization of the invention, that this hydrogenation<br>
15 	happens because a localized high density of monatomic hydrogen radicals results in reactivity<br>
	equivalent to or higher than that produced by non-localized high density of molecular<br>
	hydrogen exerted by high hydrogen pressure. Hydrogen is more reactive with the C-C bond<br>
	when it is in a radical monatomic form than when it is in the form of a diatomic molecule.<br>
	Catalytic reactions involving an iMeH can provide a performance equivalent or better to that<br>
20 	of a high-pressure zone of molecular hydrogen.<br>
		The processes of the present application, even though they may not result in an<br>
	increase in the hydrogen content of the product, depend on hydrogen availability for two<br>
	reasons: 1) hydrogen availability prevents poisoning of calayst, and 2) hydrogen availability<br>
	is a key factor permitting molecules to undergo rearrangement. Ideally, a molecule binding<br>
25 	to an active catalytic site undergoes the desired reaction or rearrangement and leaves the<br>
	catalytic surface. However, if there is a local deficiency of hydrogen, the molecule may<br>
	polymerize, react with another active molecule, or deposit on the catalytic surface as coke; all<br>
	three of these outcomes can reduce the number of available catalytic sites. In the absence of<br>
	hydrogen, the catalyst becomes deactivated more rapidly and requires more frequent cycling,<br>
30 	Because the catalyst of the present invention can provide hydrogen from its own structure as<br>
	well as accommodate hydrogen from the reaction medium, problems of localized hydrogen<br>
	deficiency are minimized. In addition, because of its ability to stabilize monatomic hydrogen,<br>
	the catalyst of the present invention is able to promote reactions in which hydrogen atoms are<br>
	added to the feedstock molecules.<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2004/033205 							PCT/US2003/032587<br>
		Test results indicate that it is important to balance tite hydrogenation with other<br>
	catalytic functions such as cracking or desulfurization so as to minimize undesired reactions<br>
	like coking. This balance is achieved by controlling the ratio of iMeH contenl and its<br>
	respective surface area to the content and surface area of the support and other catalytic<br>
5 	components.<br>
		The present invention has been also found to be particularly useful in the cracking or<br>
	hydrocracking of heavy organic compounds. The dielectric properties of heavy organic<br>
	compounds allow them to be selectively heated by RF and microwave heating. If they crack<br>
	near the surface of the iMeH, then they will react with monatomic hydrogen and undergo<br>
10 	hydro genation, desulfurization and other desired processes. The produets of the cracking<br>
	reaction have lower microwave loss factors than do the reactants, and are thus less subject to<br>
	undergo RF and microwave heating, than the reactants. The reactants are therefore selectively<br>
	heated and selectively reacted, resulting in enhanced process efficiency.<br>

10 		The catalyst of the present invention may be used with all varieties of process reactor<br>
	configurations, which are known to those skilled in the art. Generally common to these<br>
	configurations are a reaction vessel designed to permit the introduction of gas and liquid, to<br>
	contain the feedstock and the catalyst at a suitable pressure and temperature, and that<br>
	accommodates the removal Of product, as shown in Fig. 5. Altenatively either gas and/or<br>
15 	liquid may be pre - heated, depending upon process conditions, as is common practice to those<br>
	skilled in the art. The catalyst is introduced into the raction vessel under conditions<br>
	preventing the formation of surface oxides. Depending on the reactivity of the catalyst,<br>
	exposure of the catalyst to oxygen or water vapor at high temperature may be avoided, or an<br>
	inert atmosphere may be used to blanket the catalyst. The catalyst may take the form Of a bed<br>
20 	in the reaction vessel, or the catalyst and feedstock may be circulated so that they are in close<br>
	contact with each other during processing, resulting in a catalyst-feedstock (catalyst-organic<br>
	compound) mixture. It is known to those skilled in the art that other types of reactor catalyst<br>
	beds are possible, e.g. fixed beds, moving beds, slurry reactors, fluidized beds. Preferably<br>
	provision is made for recirculating hydrogen during the catalytic process. Reaction occurs On<br>
25 	introduction of feedstock and hydrogen gas on to catalyst within the reaction vessel .The<br>
	feedstock (organic compounds) reacts with the monatomic hydrogen at the surface of the<br>

	resulting from a chemical reaction sach as combustion, by resistive heating or by acoustic<br>
30 	heating, may be heated diclectrically by radio frequency or microwave energy, or they may<br>
	be heated by a combination of these methods. Combustion is the chemical combination of a<br>
	substance with oxygen. Resistive heating is heating resulting from the flow of a current<br>
	through an electrical conductor. Acoustic heating is heating resulting from physical morion<br>

	frequency greater than a equal to about i MHz, and more particularly, at least about 500<br>
	MHz may generally be applied. RF or microwave energy at a frequency less than about<br>

	feedstock to the volume of catalyst that passes through the catalyst on an hourly basis. The<br>
	LHSV range is generally at least about 0.10 per hour, and more particularly at least about<br>

	Logarithmic Pressure Composition Isotherms of an iMeH Catalyst<br>

		Figure 10 shows the logarithmic pressure composition isotherms for the monatumic<br>
	hydrogen desorption curve of iMeH Cat 100, Mm(1.1) Ni(4.22)Co(0.42)Al(0.15)Mn(0.15). The plot<br>
	displays the results at constant temperatures and equilibrium conditions for Cat 100 powder,<br>
	relating pressure amd stored iMcH hydrogen density. The plot shows that at a constant<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2004/033205 							PCT/US2003/032587<br>
	temperature, the iMeH hydrogen density increases as a non-linear function of pressure. The<br>
	plot also shows that decreasing the temperature of the isotherms results in an increase of the<br>
	iMaH hydrogen density. This data characterixes the iMeH catalyst' s hydrogen capacity to<br>
	provide monatomic hydrogen for hydrogenation or hydroprocessing reactions.<br>
5<br>
	Example 2<br>
	Selection of an iMeH Catalyst<br>
		To select an iMeH for a catalytic process, and to determine the operating parameters,<br>
10 	it is useful to know how much hydrogen an iMeH material stores, the temperature at which<br>
	the monatomic hydrogen desorbs, and the effect of pressure on menatomic hydrogen<br>
	desorption.<br>
		In Fig. 11, plots of total hydrogen capacity versus temperature at ambient pressure are<br>
	Shown for Cat 100, Cat 200 and Cat 300, three example catalysts of the present invention.<br>
15 	The compositions of these examples of iMeH catalysts according to the present invention are<br>
	as follows;<br>
	Cat 100<br>
	Mm(1.1)Ni(4.22)Co(0.15)Mo(0.13)<br>
20<br>
	Cat 200<br>
	Ncl(2.05)Dy(0.25)Fe(1.3)B(1.05)<br>
	Cat 300<br>
25.	Mg(1.05)Ni(0.95)Cu(0.07)<br>
		Given the standard industial tolerances in the production of metals it is expected that<br>
	very similar properties will be exhibited by a composition with the following general<br>
	formulas:<br>
30<br>
	Cat 100<br>
	Mm(30+34.5)(Ni, Co, Al, Mn)(69.9-66.4)<br>

	Cat 200 <br>
	(Nd, Dy)(15.5-10.5)(Fe, B)(83.5-84.5)<br>
	Cat 300<br>
5 	Mg(44-56) (Ni, Cu)(54-56) <br>
		Monatomic hydrogen desorbs from Cat 100 at lower temperatures, below 200oC<br>
	while monatomic hydrogen desorbs from Cat 300 at temperatures above 250Â°C. Also, the<br>
	transition for desorption for Cat 300 is sharper. Thus, for a reaction at ambient pressure, one<br>
10 	would select Cat 100 for a low temperature reaction below 200Â°C and Cat 300 for a higher<br>
	temperature reaction above 300Â°C Cat 200, while it has s lower total hydrogen capacity, has<br>
	the property of desorbing monatomic hydrogen over an extended temperature range,<br>
		When the pressure is adjusted, the operating temperature that optimizes the release of<br>
	monatomic hydrogen is changed. Table 1 shows that at a given temperature, less monatomic<br>
15 	hydrogen is released as the operating pressure increases. Therefore, selection of iMeH<br>
	depends up on both process temperature and pressure. The hydrogenation performance of the<br>
	iMeH can be controlled by the opeating parameters so that, in this example, the low<br>
	temperature iMeH can be used at higher temperatures by increasing the process pressure,<br>
	within its thermodynamic limit.<br>

	Example 3<br>
	Microwave Enhanced Hydroprocessing with Respect to Feedstock<br>
		For heavy oils, such as pitch residuum, microwave energy is preferentially absorbed<br>
25 	by the aromatic arid polar compounds in The oil thereby promoting their reaction. This is<br>
	shown in fig. 12 where the less tangent (y-axis) for pitch residuum is approximately an order<br>
	of magnitude gresler than fox microwave processed pitch (reduced molecular weigjht and<br>
	lower boiling point) across a wide range of microwave frequencies (0.5 -2,8 GHz). The loss<br>
	tangent, also called loss factor or the dissipation factor, is a measure of the material's<br>
30 	microwave adsorption. The loss tangent is also the ratio of the energy lost to the energy<br>
	stored.<br>
		In hydroprocessing according to the present invention the proper control and use of<br>
	the dielectric loss tangent leads to the efficient use of microwave energy. The fraction of<br>
	microwave energy, which is absorbed by any component of the oil and catalyst mixture, can<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2004/033205 							PCT/US2003/032587<br>
	be efficiently controlled. For example, when the dielectric loss tangent of the catalyst is<br>
	equal to the oil, then approximately half the microwave energy initially goes into heating the<br>
	oil and half into the catalyst. The primary method of loss tangent control is by adjusting the<br>
	meterial compositions of the individual components. This includes the optimization of<br>
5 	catalyst composition or the blending of feedstocks.<br>
		In the case where increased hydrogenation is desirable, hydrogenation can be<br>
	enhanced by incrsasing the loss tangent of the iMeH catalyst component relative to that of the<br>
	oil. For heavy oils, as the oil is reacted from residuum to cracked oil, on a local scale, more<br>
	of the microwave energy, as further explained in example 5 and shown in Figure 13, is<br>
10 	available to go into the catalyst, further promoting hydrogenation enhancement, in<br>
	comparison to thermal heating of the oil.<br>
		When lighter oil is being hydrogenated, the oil itself would already have a lower loss<br>
	tangent. In this case the catalyst can be adjusted to maintain a high fixed loss tangent ratio of<br>
	the catalyst to the oil. Microwave energy can thereby be efficiently directed to promote<br>
15 	hydrogenation by the coupting, into the hydrogenation components of the catalyst.<br>
		Methods for adjusting the catalyst loss tangent include, but are not limited to<br>
	controling iMeH dispersion, iMeH concentration, and selection of iMeH alloy type or<br>
	composition and/or type. Similar modification to the support structure can be made as well<br>
	as doping and coating with selected materials.<br>
20 		Similarly hydrocracking can be controlled through the adjustment of the dielectric<br>
	properties of the catalyst. Microwave energy can be efficiently directed to promote cracking<br>
	by the coupling into the hydrocracking components of the catalyst.<br>
	Example 4<br>
25 	Evaluation of Microwave Assisted Processing of Heavy Petroleum Fractions<br>
		The feed samples used for this example were pitch residuum, heavy residue left after<br>
	straight run atmospheric distillation in the production of gasoline and diesel fuels. The<br>
	samples were processed, using microwave energy at 2,45 GHz, stightly below ambient<br>
30 	pressures under a blanket of nitrogen. Several types of commercially available zeolites were<br>
	used as catalyst: 5A; I3X, and ammonium Y. Spot checks of the bulk temperature of the<br>
	catalystpitch mixture were conducted using a type, K thermocouple. Temperatures ranged<br>
	from about 200Â°C to 475CC. Temperature checks were conducted as rapidly as possible after<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2004/033205 							PCT/US2003/032587<br>
	the microwave power was turned off, Typically within five to ten seconds, to minimize<br>
	cooling of the sample.<br>
		These tests show the effect of using only a simple catalyst without the addition of<br>
	iMeH catalyst. The properties of the feed (pitch residuum) and the product (microwave<br>
5 	processed pitch) are shown in Table 2. Microwave processing of the feed reduced the pour<br>
	point reduced from 95 to 30 and the viscosity was lowered from 413 cSt at 100Â°C to 7 cSt at<br>
	50Â°C. Additionally, the simulated distillation results show that the boiling point distribution<br>
	has significantly shifted from mostly high boiling organic compounds, in the pitch feed, to<br>
	lower boiling organic compounds in the product. Liltle change was observed in either the<br>
10 	specific gravity or in the concentration of sulfur. This indicates that without the use of an<br>
	mproved catalyst, the product was produced via cracking reaction. There was little<br>
	esulfurization or addition of hydrogen.<br>
		In another series of tests the pitch was microwave processed with and without iMeH<br>
	catalyst in a microwave oven to evaluate the effect of the iMeH catalyst component white<br>
15 	using the pitch feedstock. Tests were performed with the following catalyst mixtures: I)<br>
	commercial 13X zeolite. 2) a mixture of connmercially available 13X zeolite and ammonia-Y<br>
	catalyst, and 3) a mixture commercial sodium-Y catalyst with iMeH Cat 100. As before, the<br>
	samples were processed slightly below ambient pressures under a blanket of nitrogen at an<br>
	approximate temperature of 250oC. Lead acetate paper was positioned near the reaction<br>
20 	vessel outlet to derermine the presence hydrogen sulfide (H2S).<br>
		Only the tests Using catalyst with the iMeH Cat 100 pomponent rapidly turned the<br>
	lead acetate paper black, indicating that large quantities of hydrogen sulfide were being<br>
	produced and the product was being desulfurized. No H2S was detected during tests<br>
	conducted with, catalysts without the iMeH Cat 100 component.<br>
25 		The stored monatomic hydrogen within the iMeH catalyst w as the only source of free<br>
	hydrogen. These tests show that the iMeH catalyst component, with the enhancement of the<br>
	microwave energy, assists the catalytic hydrogenation and release of H2S to promote<br>
	desulfurization. These tests show that microwave energy and iMeH catalyst promote<br>
	hydrogenatlon and hydroprocessing at low pressure.<br>

	Example 5<br>
	Description of microwave enhanced hydrogenation with respect to iMeH catalyst<br>
		Fig. 13 depicts measurements obtained in a batch reactor test. In this test, 3D cc of<br>
5 	iMeH catalyst (50% Cat 300/50% USY (1 %Pd) was placed in a reactor with 30 cc of coker-<br>
	kero feed. This feedstock has both sulfur and aromatic components. The reactor pressure,<br>
	microwave power at 2.45 GHz, and the iMeH catalyst bulk temperature were monitored<br>
	along with the H2 flow rate into the reactor. The initial pressure was set at 50 psig. Upon<br>
	heating to 200Â°C the pressure increased to 60 psig where it was Maintained throughout the<br>
10 	test.<br>
		Fig, 13 shows that, when the microwaves are applied into the reactor, the flow of<br>
	gaseous molecular hydrogen (H2) into the reactor is zero. For this example of feedstock,<br>
	catalyst, temperature, and low pressure, hydrogenation occurs only when monatomic<br>
	hydrogen (H+) is reacted into the coker-kero feedstock through the effects of both the iMeH<br>
15 	catalyst and the micrawaves. The data shows that the pressure remains eithet constant ar is<br>
	slightly reduced during the time when the microwaves are on. Hydrogenation occurs when<br>
	the microwave field simultaneously stimulates the iMeH and causes the direct reaction of the<br>
	monatormic hydrogen (H+), from within the interstitial lattice of the iMeH, to catalyze and<br>
	combine ivith the coker-kero hydrocarbons and sulfur compounds comprising the feedstock.<br>
20 	This direct catalytic reaction however temporarily depletes the monatomic hydrogen (H+)<br>
	from within the interstitial lattice of the iMeH.<br>
		When the microwaves are not being applied into the reactor, the gaseous hydrogen<br>
	(H2) flows into the reactor to replenish the hydrogen consumed by the monatomic (H+)<br>
	hydnogenation reactions. When die gaseous hydrogen contacts the surface of the iMeH, it is<br>
25 	dissociated inio monatomic hydrogen (H+) by the fundamental nature of the iMeH and is<br>
	absorbed into the interstitial structure of the iMeH. There is a useful, but reduced catalytic<br>
	effect when using iMeH without the benefit of microwaves. In the case without microwaves,<br>
	an equilibrium exchange is reached whereby the rate of gaseous hydrogen (H2) into the iMeH<br>
	is in balance with the rate of monatomic hydrogen (H+) reacted into the feedstock. However<br>
30 	the equilibrium rate of monatomic hydrogen (H+) reacted into the feedstock is typically lower<br>
	without microwaves. Using the hydrogenation of naphthalene as an example,microwaves<br>

5 	Quantilative Hydrogenation Test Results for Naphthajene<br>
		A sequence of tests was conducted on naphthalene (C10H8) as a model compound to<br>
	demonstrate the hydrogenation capability of the iMeH catalysts and the effect of microwave<br>
	enhancement of the hydrogenation reactions catalyzed by iMeH, Shown in this example are<br>
10 	tests conducted under identical temperature and pressure (200oC and 50 psi H2) and the same<br>
	liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) setting of 0.5, The microwave frequency was 2.45 GHz,<br>
		The feed naphthalene solution was prepared with n-dodecane (n-C12H26) as solvent,<br>
	and n-nonarue (n-C9H20) as an internal standard. Major hydrogenation products include<br>
	tetralin(C10H12) and cis- and trans-decalin (C10H18). The formation of tetralin requires the<br>
15 	addition of four hydrogen atoms per molecule, while the formation of decalin needs the<br>
	addition of 10 hydrogen atoms. Decalin is the fully-saturated reaction product for the<br>
	hydrogenation of naphthalene. The yield of tetralin and decalin is a measure of the extent of<br>
	naphthalene hydrogenation, as shown through the following reactions:<br>
			C10H8 + 2H2 -&gt; C10H12(tetralin)<br>
20 			C10H8 + 5H2 -&gt; C10H18 (cis- and trans-decalin)<br>
		After a test, the product gas phase and liquid phase were analyzed with gas<br>
	chromatographs (GC) to determine their chemical makeup. The GC results allowed for<br>
	quantitative determination of the concentration of naphthalene remaining in the product and<br>
	the amaunts of tetralin and cis and trans decalin produced. A mass balance was performed<br>
25 	for each test. Ihe change in hydrogpn content was calculated by subtracting the hydrogen in<br>
	feed from the hydrogen in product.<br>
		The following test results show that the iMeH catalyst has a large hydrogenation<br>
	capacity, even at significantly lower pressure (200oC, 50 psi). Such capacity is significantly<br>
	enhanced with the application of microwave energy.<br>
30 		Test results provide evidence of the advantages of using interstitial metal hydrides<br>
	(iMeH) with and without microwave energy. Data for three distinct classes of iMeH catalysts<br>
	are presented, Cat 100, Cat 200, and Cat 300. The iMeH component is mixed with a<br>

		Three tests art presented in Table 3. They compare three catalyst compositions used<br>
	for naphthalene hydrogenation tests. These tests were processed using conventional beat at<br>
15 	the process conditions of 200oC, 50psig, 0.5 LHSV. The first catalyst, 100% USY is a<br>
	zeolite support is shown to be ineffective at hydrogenating naphthalene at these process<br>
	conditions. The second catalyst was made by the addition themically dispersed palladium,<br>

	yielding a hydrogen uptake of 1 .6%. The last catalyst was made by mixing 30wt% of iMeH<br>
	Cat 100 power together with USY powder. This catalyst resulted in a hydrogen uptake of<br>
	1.9% demonstrating that the iMeH Cat 100 is an effective hydragenation substitute for<br>
	palladium.<br>
25 		Naphthalene Hydrogenation Tests Comparing Catalyst with iMeH Cat 100 Processed<br>
	with Conventional or Microwave Energy<br>
		Table 4 presents the test results of catalyst containing iMeH Cat 100 At two<br>
	concentrations, 30wt% and 50wt%. These tests were processed using either conventional<br>
	heat or microwave energy at the process conditions of 200oC, 50 psig, 0.5 LHSV. The USY<br>
30 	powder was coated with 1 wt% palladium and mixed together with iMeH Cat 100 powder.<br>
	All catalyst combination provided for higher hydrogen uptake and the production of the more<br>
	fully saturated decalin. Conclusions drawn from this data include:<br>

WO 2004/033205 							PCT/US2003/032587<br>
			Â· 	Hydrogen uptake is enhanced by combining the Pd coated USY with Cat<br>
				100<br>
			Â· 	Hydrogen uptake increases with increased Cat 100 content<br>
			Â· 	Hydrogen uptake is enhanced with microwaves<br>
5 		Table 5 presents the test results of catalyst containing iMeH Cat 200 at two<br>
	concentrations, 30wt% and 50wt%, and iMeH Cat 300 at the 50wt% concentration. These<br>
	tests were processed using either conventional heat or microwave energy at the process<br>
	conditions of 200oC, 50 psig, 0.5 LHSV. The USY powder was coated with lwt% palladium<br>
	and mixed together with iMeH powder. Conclusions drawn from this data include:<br>
10 			Â· 	Cat 100 hydrogenates naphthalene batter than Cat 200.<br>
			Â· 	Hydrogen uptake/decalin production, for Cat 200, is significantly<br>
				enhanced with microwaves<br>
			Â· 	Hydrogen uptake increases slightly with increased Cat 200 content<br>
			Â· 	Cat 300 hydregenates better than Cat 200 but less than Cat 100<br>
15 		The hydrogenation performance of each iMeH material can be explained by the level<br>
	of monatomic hydrogen produced at the operating conditions of 200oC and 50 psig. It should<br>
	be noted that multiple test runs, under identical conditions, indicate a standard deviation of<br>
	less than 3% of value for the increase in hydrogen content and for dccalin production. Test<br>
	results for the present invention now allow for a method to determine the proper pressure and<br>
20 	temperature to maximize hydraprossing given the input feedstock and the desired product.<br>
		Table 6 compares the performance of prior art or commercial catalysts. These tests<br>
	were processed using either conventional heat or microwave energy at the process conditions<br>
	of 200Â°C, 50 psig, 0.5 LHSV.<br>
		Commercial H-Oil catalyst was processed using microwave energy, as it is well<br>
25 	known that it does not work well at low pressures. The lack of hydrogenation of current best<br>
	practice catalysts demonstrates the effectiveness of iMeH catalysts of the present invention.<br>
		The second catalyst was a metal hydride prepared by conventional methods and tested<br>
	using conventional heat. The lack of hydrogenation demonstrates that it does not function as<br>
	art iMeH catalyst of the present invention.<br>
30 		Table 7 compares iMeH Cat 100 at two microwave energy power levels and in a<br>
	partially oxidized state- These tests were processed using microwave energy at the process<br>
	conditions of 200oC, 50 psig, 0.5 LHSV. Att previous tests were contacted at a set<br>
	microwave power level I estimated to be one watt/cm3. A secend microwave pawer level,<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2004/033205 							PCT/US2003/032587<br>
	power level 2, was selected for comparison and is estimated to be 1.9 watts/cm3. For both<br>
	microwave power levels, the microwave energy provides both the preheat energy and the<br>
	reaction enhancement energy,<br>
		The test results show that significant increase in hydrogen uptake, 47% increase, and<br>
5 	an increase in decalin production, 128%, was realized by adjusting the microwave to power<br>
	level 2. It is thought that the higher microwave power setting provided more microwave<br>
	energy to the reaction as the bulk temperatures were held to the same levels. The third<br>
	catalyst, of the same composition, was prepared without the precautions taken according to<br>
	the present invention to minimized the formation if an oxide layer on the iMeH. The resulting<br>
10 	reduction of 58% hydrogen uptake and reduction of 99.8% of decalin production<br>
	demonstrates the effectiveness of iMeH catalysts of the present invention.<br>
	Example 7<br>
	Benzothiophene Ring Opening<br>
15<br>
		Tests ware done with the model compound benzothiophene to show desulfurization<br>
	via ring opening. Benzothiophene is an aromatic, heterocyclic sulfur compound, with a side<br>
	benzene ring, commonly found in petroleum (C8H6S). Tests were performed using a<br>
	benzothiophene solution prepared with dodecane as a solvent and nonane as an internal<br>
20 	standard.<br>
		The benzothiophene solution was processed using an iMeH Cat 300, 50% Cat300-<br>
	50% USY (1% Pd), with microwave energy at 2.45 GHz, power level 2 at the processing<br>
	conditions of 200Â°C, 50 psigh and 0,5 LHSY. 93% of benzothiophene was converted, and<br>
	H2S gas was detected, demonstrating a hydrodesulfurization process via carbon-sulfur bond<br>
25 	cleavage and ring opening.<br>
	Example 8<br>
	Quantitative Hydrogenation Test Results for Commercial Test Feeds<br>
30 		The following tests were performed with commercial test feeds. These tests include<br>
	light gas oil (LGO), coker-kero oil, and heavy vacumm gas oil (HVGG).<br>
		The present invention works at much lower pressures than existing hydroprocessing<br>
	reactions. This provides additional flexibility in selecting process variables. For example,<br>
31<br><br>
WO 2004/033205 							PCT/US2003/032587<br>
	for any given feedstock, the process temperature and pressure determine the fraction of<br>
	organic compounds in the vapor phase and the fraction in the liquid phase. Depending on the<br>
	hydroprprossing reaction, controlling the vapor to liquid fraction ratio can improve the<br>
	process efficiency- This is true at temperatures below 550Â°C at pressures below 600 psig and<br>
5 	especially for pressures below 300 psig.<br>
		The following test results provide one skilled in the art examples to determine the<br>
	proper catalyst composition and reaction conditions (i,e. temperature, pressure LHSV,<br>
	microwave energy level) to maximize hydroprocessing for a given feedstock and desired<br>
	product.<br>
10<br>
	Light Gas Oil Hydrogenation Tests<br>
		Light Gas Oil (LGO) is petroleum fraction containing a complex mixture of<br>
	hydrocarbons with a boiling point range from 140 to 450oC at one atmosphere, 90% of the<br>
	hydrocarbon compounds boil between 160-370Â°C at ambient pressure. The level of<br>
15 	aromatics in the LGO is estimated to be about 30 wt%. The feed was placed in a batch<br>
	microwave reactor in quantities and time to treat the feed at 0.5 LHSV, An HCNS analyzer<br>
	was used to measure the feed and product hydrogen to carbon (H/C) molar ratio. The higher<br>
	the H/C ratio, the more hydrogen tn the product. Test results are presented to show the<br>
	increase in hydrogen content (wt%) added to the product.<br>
20 		LGO was processed using an iMeH Cat 300 catalyst, 50% Cat 300- 50% USY<br>
	(1 %Pd). Two tests were performed using microwave energy at 2,45 GHz, power level 2, at<br>
	two different operating pressures, 50 psig or 150 psig at the same test conditions of 200Â°C,<br>
	and 0.5 LHSY. at 50 psig, the LGO was hydrogenated increasing the hydrogen content in<br>
	the product by 0.2 wt%. At 150 psig, the amount of hydnogenation increased by a factor of<br>
25 	two to 0.4 wt%.<br>
	Coker-Kero Hydrogenation Tests<br>
		Table 8 shows test results with coker-kera feed, Coker-kero feed is a low-value<br>
	product fraction from the coking process, It contains a complex mixture of organic<br>
30 	compounds with a boiling point range from 160 to 400Â°C. 90% of the organic compounds<br>
	boil between 200-360oC. It has a high-level of aromatic content, and a sulfur content of over<br>
	1.5 wt%<br>
		Table 9 presents the coker-kero hydrogenation test results for an iMeH Cat 3.00, 50%<br>
	Cat 300- 50% USY (1%Pd). Three tests were performed using microwave energy at 2,45<br>
32<br><br>
WO 2004/033205 							PCT/US2003/032587<br>
	GHz, power level 2, and 0.5 LHSV, The tests compare the effects of increasing either the<br>
	operating temperature or operating, pressure from the process conditions of 200Â°C, 50 psig,<br>
	0.5 LHSV,<br>
		The test results from Table 8 show that the iMeH Cat 300 catalyst was able to<br>
5 	hydrogenate and to hydrodesulfurize the coker-kero. The level of hydrogenation doubled and<br>
	the level of desulfurization increased by 8 fold when the operating pressure was changed<br>
	from 50 psig to 150 psig. This same increase in hydrogenation and desulfurization was<br>
	observed when the operating temperature was increased to 250oC. For this example a<br>
	process pressure increase from 50 to 150 psig at 200Â°C was approximately equal in<br>
10 	hydrogenation performance to a change in process temperature from 200 to 250oC at 50psig.<br>
		These results are significant because this sulfur reduction, performed at low pressure,<br>
	is due to hydrogenation of the sulfur-bearing compounds without the use of standard<br>
	desulfurization catalysts such as Ni/Mo and Co/Mo. The palladium metal component of this<br>
	catalyst is not generally used in industry for desulfurization because it is readily poisoned by<br>
15 	sulfur.<br>
		Additional tests were carried out with a catalyst using 50% iMeH Cat 300 with a 50-<br>
	50 mixture of USY(1%Pd) and a sulfided Ni/Mo supported alumina. The coker-kero Was<br>
	processed witti a combination of conventional preheat and microwave energy. The process<br>
	conditions were feed preheat to 40OÂ°C, reaction temperature405Â°C, 150 psig, 0.5 LHSV.<br>
20 	The average microwave power density at 2.45 GHz was estimated to be 0.12 watts/cm3.<br>
		The analysis of the feed and product showed an increase in product hydrogen content<br>
	of 0.51wt% and the level of hydrodesulfurization was 57.3% (i.e. sulfur content reduced from<br>
	3.61 wt% sulfur to 1.54 wt% sulfur). It is believed the higher level of desulfurization is<br>
	attributable to the addition of the sulfided Ni/Mo alumins to catalyst pellet. Table #9 shows<br>
25 	the improvement of other physical properties including a 65% increase in the cetane index,<br>
	Heavy Vacuum Gas Oil Hydrogenation Teats<br>
		Heavy vacuum gas oil is obtained from the residue of atmospherie distillation using<br>
	reduced pressures (25-100 mm Hg) to avoid thermal cracking. The boiling range is<br>
30 	approximately 260 to 600Â°C at one atmosphere pressure. The density is approximately 0.97<br>
	g/ml. The aromatic content is greater than 50% and the sulfur content is about 35 wt%.<br>
		Tests were carried out with a catalyst using 50% iMeH Cat 300 with a 50-50 mixture<br>
	of USY(1%Pd) and a sulfided Mi/Mo supported, on alumina. The HVGO feedstock was<br>
	processed wife a combination of conventional preheat and microwave energy. The process<br>
33<br><br>
WO 2004/033205 							PCT/US2003/032587<br>
	conditions were feed preheat w 400Â°C, reaction temperature 405oC, 150 psig, 0.5 LHSV.<br>
	The averiga microwave power density at 2.45 GHz was estimated to be 0.12 watts/cm3.<br>
		The analysis of the feed and product showed a slight increase in product hydrogen<br>
	content of 0.08 Wt% but the level of hydrodesulfurization was 68 .8%. It is believed the higher<br>
5 	level of desulfurization is attributable to the addition of the sulfided Ni/Mo alumma to<br>
	catalyst pellet. also, during the test ammonia was delected in the gas phase providing<br>
	evidence of hydrodenitrogenation, Table #10 shows the improvement of other physical<br>
	properties including a reduction in viscosity from174 cst to less than 7 cSt amd a 55%<br>
	increase in the API gravity.<br>
