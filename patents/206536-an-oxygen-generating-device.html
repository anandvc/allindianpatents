PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF AN ORAL CONTROLLED RELEASE<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION FOR ONCE-A-DAY THERAPY FOR<br>
TREATMENT AND PROPHYLAXIS OF CARDIAC AND CICULATORY<br>
DISEASES<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of an oral controlled release pharmaceutical composition for once-a-day therapy for the treatment and prophylaxis of cardiac and circulatory diseases in humans.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of an oral controlled release pharmaceutical composition that releases carvedilol in a controlled manner so as to provide control over carvedilol plasma levels, such that the ratio of peak plasma levels to the plasma levels at 24 hours after administration, and the mean residence time of carvedilol, are within a desirable range for said once-a-day therapy for the treatment and prophylaxis of cardiac and circulatory diseases.<br>
The term cardiac and circulatory diseases as herein described includes hypertension, congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, left ventricular hypertrophy, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, reflex tachycardia, ischaemic heart disease, atheromatosis, hypertension associated with diabetes mellitus, stroke and renal failure.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Carvedilol, l-(9H-carbazol-4-yloxy)-3-[[2-(2-methoxyphenoxy)ethyl]amino]-2-propanol, described in United States Patent No. 4,503,067, is a competitive non-selective P-adrenergic blocking agent with ai-blocking activity. The p-adrenergic blocking activity prevents reflex tachycardia in hypertension and the ai-blocking activity causes vasodilation. The P-adrenergic blocking activity resides in the S(-) enantiomer, while the R(+) enantiomer possesses cti -blocking activity. The drug is used as its racemic mixture so that both the enantiomers act together to exert the pharmacological effect of carvedilol.<br><br>
Carvedilol is a novel multiple action drug useful in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension and congestive heart failure. The drug is also known to act as a calcium channel blocker at high doses. The antihypertensive effect of carvedilol is mediated primarily by decreasing total peripheral vascular resistance without causing the concomitant reflex changes in heart rate commonly associated with other antihypertensive agents. Carvedilol also markedly reduces infarct size, possibly as a consequence of its antioxidant action in attenuating oxygen free radical-initiated lipid peroxidation, thereby leading to cardioprotection. For hypertension, the recommended starting dose for carvedilol is 6.25mg given twice daily, which is increased after 7-14 days, if tolerated, to 12.5mg twice daily, this dose being further increased to 25mg twice daily, if tolerated and needed. The total daily dose should not exceed 50mg. For congestive cardiac failure, the recommended starting dose is 3.125mg given twice daily, which is increased to 6.25mg twice daily after two weeks, if tolerated. The maximum recommended dose is 25mg twice daily in patients weighing less than 85kg and 50mg twice daily in patients weighing more than 85kg.<br>
Carvedilol undergoes considerable first pass metabolism after oral administration and as a result has a low absolute bioavailability of 25%. Carvedilol is metabolized primarily by aromatic ring oxidation and glucuronidation. The oxidative metabolites are further metabolized by conjugation via glucuronidation and sulfation. Demethylation and hydroxylation at the phenol ring produce three active metabolites with J3-blocking activity. Plasma concentrations of the active metabolites are about one-tenth of that for carvedilol and the pharmacokinetics is similar to carvedilol. Controlled release and delayed release formulations of carvedilol can give rise to once daily formulations which are able to extend the duration of action of carvedilol and thus improve the bioavailability of the drug. Hence, it would be advantageous to formulate a modified release composition for carvedilol, wherein the modified release may be delayed release, sustained release or controlled release.<br>
Several adverse effects encountered in medical therapy are related to a peak in plasma concentration, often occurring a few hours after administration of a dose. Very rapid<br><br><br>
initial rate of release of carvedilol results in higher peak plasma levels and therefore, more adverse effects. On the other hand, if the carvedilol is released too slowly from the tablets, then incomplete absorption occurs. In the present invention, the ratio of the peak plasma levels to the plasma levels at 24 hours after administration is within a desirable range. A higher ratio of maximum plasma concentration of carvedilol to the plasma concentration at 24 hours after oral administration indicates a poorer control and faster release, while a smaller ratio indicates a control on the release rate over a prolonged duration. A higher ratio for a smaller dose of 12.5 mg daily may also mean that effective plasma levels of carvedilol may not be available at 24 hours after administration, whereas if the ratio is too small then the effective plasma levels of carvedilol may not be reached at all. On the other hand an optimum design of an oral controlled release composition for once-a-day therapy for the treatment and prophylaxis of cardiac and circulatory diseases requires that the composition provide a control on the plasma levels such that the mean residence time (i.e. the mean time that a drug spends in the body) is within a desirable range for said once-a-day therapy for the treatment and prophylaxis of cardiac and circulatory diseases.<br>
PCT application WO 9924017 ('017) claims a matrix formulation comprising carvedilol in an oral dosage unit form. The systems exemplified include three different types : the first is a matrix tablet containing hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and Carbomer 934P, which is a grade of polyacrylic acid as rate controlling excipients; the second is an immediate release core coated with an enteric polymer or a controlled release polymer; and the third is beads that are coated with glycerylmonostearate and glyceryldistearate. The application does not provide the data and the best mode by which the invention could be worked so as to provide control over carvedilol plasma levels, such that the ratio of peak plasma levels to the plasma levels at 24 hours after administration, as well as the mean residence time of carvedilol, are within a desirable range for once-a-day therapy for the treatment and prophylaxis of cardiac and circulatory diseases.<br>
An oral controlled release pharmaceutical composition for carvedilol that releases the carvedilol in a controlled manner so as to provide control over carvedilol plasma levels,<br><br><br>
such that the ratio of peak plasma levels to the plasma levels at 24 hours after administration, and the mean residence time of carvedilol, are within a desirable range for once-a-day therapy for the treatment and prophylaxis of cardiac and circulatory diseases, is thus required. Consequently, a method of providing control over carvedilol plasma levels in humans, said method consisting of orally administering to human subjects said oral controlled release pharmaceutical composition for once-a-day therapy for the treatment and prophylaxis of cardiac and circulatory diseases, would be possible. It has been found that the desired control over plasma levels for once-a-day therapy for the treatment and prophylaxis of cardiac and circulatory diseases is achieved by providing an oral controlled release pharmaceutical composition that provides a dissolution profile such that -<br>
(a)	Not more than 50% of the carvedilol is released after 2 hours;<br>
(b)	Not more than 70%, preferably between 25% and 70%, more preferably between 30%o and 60% of the carvedilol is released after 4 hours;<br>
(c)	Not more than 90%, preferably between 50% and 90%, more preferably between 60% and 80% of the carvedilol is released after 8 hours; and<br>
(d)	Not less than 60%, preferably not less than 70% of the carvedilol is released after 12 hours;<br>
when tested in United States Pharmacopoeia Type I apparatus using 0.1N HC1 for 0-2 hours, and simulated intestinal fluid, pH 6.8, for 2-12 hours at rpm of 100.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows the plasma concentration vs time profile obtained upon administration of one embodiment of the oral controlled release pharmaceutical composition prepared by the process of the present invention having 12.5 mg carvedilol, in comparison to that obtained for an equivalent dose of an immediate release composition.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The carvedilol or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester may be used in the preparation of the oral controlled release pharmaceutical composition of the present invention in the range of amounts equivalent to 5mg to lOOmg of carvedilol. In particular, an oral controlled release pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may have carvedilol or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester in an amount equivalent to 12.5mg, 25mg or 50mg of carvedilol.<br>
The oral controlled release pharmaceutical composition prepared by the process of the present invention releases the carvedilol in a controlled manner so as to provide a control over carvedilol plasma levels, such that the ratio of the peak plasma levels of carvedilol to the plasma levels at 24 hours after administration is in the range from 25:1 to 1:1 and is designed to increase the mean residence time of carvedilol in the body, preferably the ratio of the peak plasma levels of carvedilol to the plasma levels at 24 hours after administration is in the range from 10:1 to 3:1 and the mean residence time of carvedilol is in the range from about 10 hours to about 24 hours, more preferably the ratio of the peak plasma levels of carvedilol to the plasma levels at 24 hours after administration is in the range from 7:1 to 4:1 and the mean residence time of carvedilol is in the range from about 15 hours to about 20 hours. The oral administration as referred to herein may be<br><br><br>
administration of the composition in the absence or presence of food, i.e. in the fasted mode or in the fed mode.<br>
The mean residence time is increased from about 3 to 4 times as compared to an immediate release composition. The effective half-life of carvedilol on oral administration of the pharmaceutical composition prepared by the process of the present invention is increased by about 2 to 4 times as compared to an immediate release composition.<br>
The process for the preparation of an oral controlled release pharmaceutical composition for once-a-day therapy for the treatment and prophylaxis of cardiac and circulatory diseases comprises mixing carvedilol or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester with at least one release rate controlling excipient and converting the mixture into a capsule or tablet dosage form by conventional means whereby the dosage form releases the carvedilol in a controlled manner so as to provide control over carvedilol plasma levels such that the ratio of peak plasma levels to plasma levels at 24 hours after administration, and the mean residence time of carvedilol are within a desirable range for said once-a-day therapy for the treatment and prophylaxis of cardiac and circulatory diseases.<br>
The rate controlling excipient is any material that slows the rate of release of the drug from the dosage form. Usually, the rate controlling excipient is a polymer or a fatty compound or a mixture thereof. It may also comprise an ion-exchange resin. Ion exchange resins are water insoluble crosslinked polymers containing salt forming groups in repeating positions on the polymer chain. Drug is bound to the resin by prolonged contact of resin with the drug solution. Drug molecules attached to the resin are released by exchanging with appropriate charged ions in the gastrointestinal tract, followed by diffusion of the free drug molecule out of the resin. This release rate is governed by the properties of the resin and by the environment of use, the ion exchange resins thus facilitating a controlled rate of drug release. Examples of rate controlling polymers that may be used in the present invention include, but are not limited to:<br><br><br>
•	cellulose ethers such as methylcellulose (MC), ethylcellulose (EC), hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), hydroxypropyl ethylcellulose (HPEC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), crosslinked carboxymethyl cellulose (croscarmellose) and its alkali salts, ethylhydroxyethylcellulose (EHEC), hydroxyethyl methylcellulose (HEMC), hydrophobically modified hydroxyethyl cellulose (HMHEC), hydrophobically modified ethylhydroxyethylcellulose (HMEHEC), carboxymethyl	hydroxyethylcellulose	(CMHEC),	carboxymethyl hydrophobically modified hydroxyethyl cellulose (CMHMHEC), and the like;<br>

Examples of fatty compounds that may be used as the rate controlling excipients in the present invention include various waxes such as digestible, long chain (C8 -C50, especially C12 -C40), substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as fatty acids, fatty alcohols, glyceryl esters of fatty acids, mineral and vegetable oils and waxes. Hydrocarbons having a melting point of between 25° and 90° C are preferred. Of these long chain hydrocarbon materials, fatty (aliphatic) alcohols are preferred.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the release rate controlling excipient is a hydrophilic swellable polymer. In a preferred embodiment the hydrophilic swellable polymer is polyethylene oxide. Polyethylene oxide is a nonionic homopolymer of ethylene oxide, containing 2000 to over 100,000 repeating oxyethylene groups. The molecular weight of polyethylene oxide ranges between 100,000 Daltons and 7,000,000 Daltons. It is commercially available as Polyox® from Union Carbide. The higher molecular weight polyethylene oxide grades (molecular weight 3,000,000 to 7,000,000 Daltons), such as Polyox® WSR coagulant with an approximate molecular weight of 5,000,000 Daltons, are used in more preferred embodiments of the present invention to provide delayed, sustained or controlled drug release. The polymer swells upon contact with aqueous fluid from the environment of use to form a hydrophilic gel matrix. This matrix expands with time and causes diffusion of the drug at a predetermined rate, depending upon the concentration and grade of the polymer used. In a more preferred embodiment, Polyox WSR coagulant is used as the swelling agent in a concentration from about 20% to about 60% by weight of the tablet.<br>

(d)    Not less than 70% of carvedilol is released after 12 hours; when tested in United States Pharmacopoeia Type I apparatus using 0.1N HC1 for 0-2 hours, and simulated intestinal fluid, pH 6.8, for 2-12 hours at rpm of 100.<br>
One embodiment of the process for the preparation of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention comprises the steps of mixing carvedilol or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester with the release rate controlling and other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and forming a pharmaceutical dosage form by conventional means. In an alternative embodiment, a core may be formed from the mixture of carvedilol or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester and the pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, which may or may not include a rate controlling excipient; and then the core may be coated by conventional methods with a coating composition comprising the rate controlling excipient. The pharmaceutical dosage form may be formed by any of the various methods known in the art. It may be formed into capsules by filling the mixture of carvedilol or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients into capsules. Alternatively, the mixture may be formed into granules or pellets by conventional means such as dry granulation, wet granulation, extrusion, spheronisation and the like. The granules or pellets may be filled into capsules or may be compressed into tablets.<br>
In one specific embodiment, the oral controlled release pharmaceutical composition is in the form of an oral osmotic drug delivery system. The oral osmotic controlled drug delivery system for carvedilol is obtained by mixing carvedilol or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester, with the polymeric swelling agent and the water-soluble osmosis inducing agent(s), and the mixture is granulated using a solution of a binder. The granules are dried and mixed with lubricants, followed by compression of the lubricated mass to obtain the core, using conventional procedures known to a person skilled in the art. A solution of cellulose acetate and a plasticiser in a suitable solvent is then used to form the semi-permeable membrane. The solution of the cellulose acetate is loaded on the core to a desirable weight gain using conventional coating techniques known to a person skilled<br><br><br>
in the art. A passageway is then introduced in the semi-permeable membrane using mechanical or laser drilling.<br>
In another embodiment, the oral controlled release pharmaceutical composition for carvedilol is obtained by mixing carvedilol with ethyl cellulose to obtain a dry powder blend. This blend is mixed with isopropanol and the wet mass is passed through a #20 sieve to obtain granules. The granules are dried in a fluid bed drier at 50°C and again passed through a suitable sieve to remove the fines. These granules are then coated with a solution comprising ethyl cellulose, HPMC, dibutyl phthalate and talc, using a suitable solvent system, in a fluid bed coater. The granules are coated to a weight gain of about 15% to about 20% of their weight. The dry granules are either encapsulated, or compressed on a rotary compression machine to obtain tablets.<br>
The oral controlled release pharmaceutical composition as herein described is orally administered to humans to provide desired control over carvedilol plasma levels in humans for once-a-day therapy for the treatment and prophylaxis of cardiac and circulatory diseases. The oral controlled release pharmaceutical composition may be administered to the patient on an empty stomach or with meals.<br>
The examples that follow do not limit the scope of the invention and are presented as illustrations.<br>
Example 1 This example illustrates one embodiment of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention and a process for its preparation. Tablets were prepared according to the formula given in Table 1 below.<br>
15<br>
Table 1<br><br><br><br>
Carvedilol, microcrystalline cellulose and starch were dry blended in the amounts mentioned in Table 1 above, after passing the individual ingredients through a #60 sieve (as defined by American Society for Testing and Materials, ASTM). Polyethylene oxide, passed through a #20 sieve (as defined by American Society for Testing and Materials, ASTM), was then added to this dry powder blend. PVP K-30 dissolved in a sufficient quantity of isopropanol was used to granulate the dry powder blend. The wet mass was passed through a #20 sieve to obtain granules of the formulation. The granules were dried in a fluid bed drier and the dried granules were passed through a #20 sieve again to remove fines. A mixture of talc, magnesium stearate and Aerosil® 200, passed through a #60 sieve, was then used to lubricate the dry granules. This lubricated mass was then compressed using 7mm standard concave punches to obtain the final tablets.<br>
The tablets so obtained were subjected to dissolution testing using United States Pharmacopoeia Type I dissolution apparatus at 100 rpm. The dissolution medium used was 900ml of 0.1N HC1 for 0-2 hours, and 900ml of simulated intestinal fluid, pH 6.8, for 2-12 hours. The results of the dissolution test are mentioned in Table 2 below.<br><br><br>
Table 2.<br>
Example 2<br>
This example illustrates another embodiment of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention and a process for its preparation. A controlled release formulation was made as per the formula given in Table 3 below.<br><br><br><br>
Table 3<br>
Carvedilol was mixed with a part of the ethyl cellulose and granulated with isopropanol. The wet mass was passed through a #20 sieve to obtain the granules, which were dried in a fluid bed drier at 50°C, and again sifted on drying to remove the fines. These granules were then coated in a fluid bed coater with a solution of the remaining amount of ethyl cellulose, HPMC, dibutyl phthalate and talc, in a suitable solvent system, to a defined weight gain.<br>
Example 3<br>
This example illustrates the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention in the form of oral osmotic controlled release tablets and a process for its preparation. Oral osmotic controlled release tablets of carvedilol were prepared according to the formula given in Table 4 below.<br>
Table 4<br><br><br><br>
Carvedilol, sodium chloride, mannitol, xanthan gum, Ac-Di-Sol, yellow oxide of iron anc red oxide of iron were mixed and passed through a #60 sieve (as defined by ASTM), and granulated using a solution of PVP K-30 in isopropyl alcohol. The granules so obtained were passed through a # 20 sieve (as defined by ASTM) and dried. Talc, magnesium stearate and colloidal silicon dioxide were mixed and passed through a # 60 sieve. This mixture was then mixed with the dried granules. The lubricated mixture was then compressed to obtain the cores. A solution of cellulose acetate and polyethylene glycol (PEG 3350) in acetone was used to coat the cores to a weight gain of 5%. An orifice was then drilled in the coated tablets using laser drilling.<br>
The tablets so obtained were subjected to dissolution testing using United States Pharmacopoeia Type I dissolution apparatus at 100 rpm. The dissolution medium used was 900ml of 0.1N HC1 for 0-2 hours, and 900ml of simulated intestinal fluid, pH 6.8, for 2-12 hours. The results of the dissolution test are mentioned in Table 5 below.<br><br>
Table 5<br><br>
Example 4<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, oral osmotic controlled release pharmaceutical tablets for carvedilol were obtained according to the formula given in Table 6 below.<br><br><br><br>
Table 6<br><br>
The tablets were prepared according to the procedure given in Example 3 above. The tablets so obtained were subjected to dissolution testing using United States Pharmacopoeia Type I dissolution apparatus at 100 rpm. The dissolution medium used was 900ml of 0.1N HC1 for 0-2 hours, and 900ml of simulated intestinal fluid, pH 6.8, for 2-12 hours. The results of the dissolution test are mentioned in Table 7 below.<br>
Table 7<br><br>
Example 5<br>
The bioavailability of the controlled release carvedilol formulation (12.5mg tablet, Example 1) of the present invention and that of conventional immediate release carvedilol formulation (2 x 6.25mg) were studied. A single-dose, open label, randomized, comparative and two-way crossover study, with a seven day washout period, was undertaken for the same. Cardivas (Sun Pharma, Lot no. JK10381, Exp. Date : March<br><br><br>
2003) 12.5mg (2 x 6.25mg tablets) was used as the immediate release carvedilol formulation.<br>
The pharmacokinetic assessment was based on the plasma levels of carvedilol measured by blood sampling. Blood samples were obtained before dosing and at the following times after administration of both the reference and test medications - 0.5, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 28 and 32 hours.<br>
Six healthy male volunteers were enrolled for the study and all of them completed the two-way crossover study. The subjects were fasted overnight before dosing and for 4 hours thereafter. Drinking water was prohibited 2 hours before dosing and 2 hours thereafter, but was allowed ad lib at all other times. Standard meals were provided at 4 hours and 8 hours after dosing and at appropriate times thereafter. Meal plans were identical for both the periods.<br>
Subjects received a single controlled release tablet of carvedilol (12.5mg, Example 1) with 240ml of water at ambient temperature after the overnight fast, as the test medication, while the reference medication was administered as two tablets of Cardivas (Sun Pharma), each of 6.25mg.<br>
The plasma concentration of carvedilol was determined for samples collected at different time points and averaged over the six volunteers. The data is given in Table 8 below. The plasma concentration versus time profile is illustrated in Figure 1.<br>
Table 8<br><br><br><br>
For the controlled release tablets, the ratio of peak plasma level to the plasma level at 24 hours after administration, when calculated from the above averaged plasma concentration, was about 5.2. The ratio could not be determined for the immediate release formulation but it would be obvious that the ratio would be comparatively very large, perhaps 10 to 20 times in magnitude, as compared to the controlled release tablets.<br>
The ratios of peak plasma level to the plasma level at 24 hours after administration were also calculated from the subjects' individual plasma data. These ratios were 9.0, 4.0, 5.6, 9.2 and 5.26 for five of the subjects; the sixth subject showed comparatively low bioavailability and carvedilol concentrations below the sensitivity limits of the assay. The mean ± standard deviation obtained for the five values of the ratios was 6.6 ± 2.36.<br>
Half-life was determined from the individual subject plasma data and the values obtained are given in Table 9 below.<br>
Table 9<br><br>
The other pharmacokinetic parameters calculated include area under the curve (AUCa) and area under the moment curve (AUMCa). The AUC is calculated using the formula :<br><br><br><br>
The AUCa and AUMCa values obtained were used to calculate the mean residence time for the controlled release formulation of Example 1, and the immediate release formulation used as the reference. The mean residence time (MRT) was calculated using the formula:<br><br>
The mean residence time for the controlled release formulation of Example 1 was found to be 16.02 ± 6.73 hours, as compared to 5.50 ± 2.76 hours for the immediate release formulation.<br>
While the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments, this was done for purposes of illustration only and should not be considered to limit the spirit or the scope of the invention.<br><br><br>
