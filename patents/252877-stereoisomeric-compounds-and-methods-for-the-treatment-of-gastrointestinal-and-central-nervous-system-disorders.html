				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application number<br>
60/534,892, filed January 7, 2004, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application number<br>
60/560,938, filed April 9,2004.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
Cisapride is one of a class of compounds known as benzamide derivatives, the parent<br>
compound of which is metoclopramide. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,962,115 and 5,057,525<br>
(collectively "Van Daele" and incorporated by reference in their entireties) disclose N-(3-<br>
hydroxy-4-piperidenyI) benzamides of cisapride. Van Daele discloses that these compounds,<br>
the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof and the stereochemically isomeric<br>
forms thereof, stimulate the motility of the gastrointestinal system.<br>
As a class, these benzamide derivatives have several prominent pharmacological<br>
actions. The prominent pharmacological activities of the benzamide derivatives are due to<br>
their effects on the neuronal systems which are modulated by the neurotransmitter serotonin.<br>
The role of serotonin, and thus the pharmacology of the benzamide derivatives, has been<br>
broadly implicated in a variety of conditions for many years. Thus, research has focused on<br>
locating the production and storage sites of serotonin as well as the location of serotonin<br>
receptors in the human body in order to determine the connection between these sites and<br>
various disease states or conditions.<br>
In this regard, it was discovered that a major site of production and storage of<br>
serotonin is the enterochromaffin cell of the gastrointestinal mucosa. It was also discovered<br>
that serotonin has a powerful stimulating action on intestinal motility by stimulating intestinal<br>
smooth muscle, speeding intestinal transit, and decreasing absorption time, as in diarrhea.<br>
This stimulating action is also associated with nausea and vomiting.<br>
Because of their modulation of the serotonin neuronal system in the gastrointestinal<br>
tract, many of the benzamide derivatives are effective anti-emetic agents and are commonly<br>
used to control vomiting during cancer chemotherapy or radiotherapy, especially when highly<br>
emetogenic compounds such as cisplatin are used. This action is almost certainly the result<br>
of the ability of the compounds to block the actions of serotonin (5HT) at specific sites of<br><br>
action, called the 5HT3-receptor, which was classically designated in the scientific literature<br>
as the serotonin M-receptor. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy may induce nausea and<br>
vomiting by the release of serotonin from damaged enterochromaffin cells in the<br>
gastrointestinal tract. Release of the neurotransmitter serotonin stimulates both afferent vagal<br>
nerve fibers (thus initiating the vomiting reflex) and serotonin receptors in the chemoreceptor<br>
trigger zone of the area postrema region of the brain. The anatomical site for this action of<br>
the benzamide derivatives, and whether such action is central (CNS), peripheral, or a<br>
combination thereof, remains unresolved (Barnes et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 40: 586-588,<br>
1988). Cisapride, like the other benzamide derivatives would appear to be an effective anti-<br>
emetic agent based on its ability to modulate the activity of serotonin at the 5HT3 receptor.<br>
A second prominent action of the benzamide derivatives is in augmenting<br>
gastrointestinal smooth muscle activity from the esophagus through the proximal small<br>
bowel, thus accelerating esophageal and small intestinal transit as well as facilitating gastric<br>
emptying and increasing lower esophageal sphincter tone (Decktor et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol.<br>
147: 313-316, 1988). Although the benzamide derivatives are not cholinergic receptor<br>
agonists per se, the aforementioned smooth muscle effects may be blocked by muscarinic<br>
receptor blocking agents such as atropine or neuronal transmission inhibitors of the<br>
tetrodotoxin type which affect sodium channels. Similar blocking activity has been reported<br>
for the contractile effects of serotonin in the small intestine. It is currently- believed that the<br>
primary smooth muscle effects of the benzamide derivatives are the result of an agonist<br>
action upon a new class of serotonin receptors referred to as 5HT4 receptors which are<br>
located on interneurons in the myenteric plexus of the gut wall. Activation of these receptors<br>
subsequently enhances the release of acetylcholine from parasympathetic nerve terminals<br>
located near surrounding smooth muscle fibers, and it is the combination of acetylcholine<br>
with its receptors on smooth muscle membranes which is the actual trigger for muscle<br>
contraction.<br>
A discussion of various 5HT receptors, including the 5HT4 receptor can be found in,<br>
for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 6, 331,401 and 6,632,827, which are incorporated by reference<br>
herein in their entirety.<br>
Cisapride has been used primarily to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).<br>
This disease is characterized as the backward flow of the stomach contents into the<br>
esophagus. One of the most important factors in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux<br><br>
disease is a reduction in the pressure barrier due to the failure of the lower esophageal<br>
sphincter. Failure of the lower esophageal sphincter can arise due to a low basal pressure,<br>
sphincter relaxation, or to a non-compensated increase in intragastric pressure. Other factors<br>
in the pathogenesis of the disease are delayed gastric emptying, insufficient esophageal<br>
clearing due to impaired peristalsis and the corrosive nature of the reflux material which can<br>
damage esophageal mucosa. Cisapride is thought to strengthen the anti-reflux barrier and<br>
improve esophageal clearance by increasing the lower esophageal sphincter pressure and<br>
enhancing peristaltic contractions.<br>
Because of its activity as a prokinetic agent, cisapride would also appear to be useful<br>
to treat dyspepsia, gastroparesis, constipation, post-operative ileus, and intestinal pseudo-<br>
obstruction. Dyspepsia is a condition characterized by an impairment of the power or<br>
function of digestion that can arise as a symptom of a primary gastrointestinal dysfunction or<br>
as a complication due to other disorders such as appendicitis, gallbladder disturbances, or<br>
malnutrition. Gastroparesis is a paralysis of the stomach brought about by a motor<br>
abnormality in the stomach or as a complication of diseases such as diabetes, progressive<br>
systemic sclerosis, anorexia nervosa or myotonic dystrophy. Constipation is a condition<br>
characterized by infrequent or difficult evacuation of feces resulting from conditions such as<br>
lack of intestinal muscle tone or intestinal spasticity. Post-operative ileus is an obstruction in<br>
the intestine due to a disruption in muscle tone following surgery. Intestinal pseudo-<br>
obstruction is a condition characterized by constipation, colicky pain, and vomiting, but<br>
without evidence of physical obstruction.<br>
Drug toxicity is an important consideration in the treatment of humans and animals.<br>
Toxic side effects (adverse effects) resulting from the administration of drugs include a<br>
variety of conditions which range from low grade fever to death. Drug therapy is justified<br>
only when the benefits of the treatment protocol outweigh the potential risks associated with<br>
the treatment. The factors balanced by the practitioner include the qualitative and<br>
quantitative impact of the drug to be used as well as the resulting outcome if the drug is not<br>
provided to the individual. Other factors considered include the physical condition of the<br>
patient, the disease stage and its history of progression, and any known adverse effects<br>
associated with a drug.<br>
Drug elimination is typically the result of metabolic activity upon the drug and the<br>
subsequent excretion of the drug from the body. Metabolic activity can take place within the<br><br>
vascular supply and/or within cellular compartments or organs. The liver is a principal site of<br>
drug metabolism. The metabolic process can be categorized into synthetic and nonsynthetic<br>
reactions. In nonsynthetic reactions, the drug is chemically altered by oxidation, reduction,<br>
hydrolysis, or any combination of the aforementioned processes. These processes are<br>
collectively referred to as Phase I reactions.<br>
In Phase II reactions, also known as synthetic reactions or conjugations, the parent<br>
drug, or intermediate metabolites thereof, are combined with endogenous substrates to yield<br>
an addition or conjugation product. Metabolites formed in synthetic reactions are, typically,<br>
more polar and biologically inactive. As a result, these metabolites are more easily excreted<br>
via the kidneys (in urine) or the liver (in bile). Synthetic reactions include glucuronidation,<br>
amino acid conjugation, acetylation, sulfoconjugation, and methylation.<br>
More than 90% of a dose of cisapride is metabolized by oxidative N-dealkylation at<br>
the piperidine nitrogen or by aromatic hydroxylation occurring on either the 4-fluorophenoxy<br>
or benzamide rings.<br>
The administration of cisapride to a human has been found to cause serious adverse<br>
effects including CNS disorders, increased systolic pressure, interactions with other drugs,<br>
diarrhea, and abdominal cramping. Further, it has been reported that intravenous<br>
administration of cisapride demonstrates the occurrence of additional adverse effects not<br>
experienced after oral administration of cisapride (Stacher et al. [1987] Digestive Diseases<br>
and Sciences 32(11):1223-1230). It is believed that these adverse effects are caused by the<br>
metabolites that result from the oxidative dealkylation or aromatic hydroxylation of the<br>
compound which occurs in the cytochrome P450 detoxification system. Cisapride is also<br>
subject to a number of undesirable drug/drug interactions that are also a result of metabolism<br>
by the cytochrome P450 system.<br>
Between July 1993 and December 1999, cisapride (PROPULSID, Janssen<br>
Pharmaceutica Products, L.P.) was reportedly associated with at least 341 serious cardiac<br>
arrhythmias. These arrhythmias include ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation,<br>
torsades de pointes, and QT prolongation. Eighty (80) deaths have been reported. As a result<br>
of these adverse effects, the product was voluntarily withdrawn from the open market in the<br>
United States; however, the drug is available through an investigational limited access<br>
program.<br><br>
The safety of 5HT4 receptor agonists with gastrointestinal (GI) prokinetic activity has<br>
been limited due to cardiac effects (prolongation of QTc intervals, tachycardia, torsades de<br>
pointes) and adverse drug interactions due to hepatic cytochrome P-450 metabolism. A GI<br>
prokinetic agent of this class that lacks these liabilities would be very valuable in several<br>
therapeutic areas including GERD and gastric emptying disorders. Certain cisapride<br>
derivatives have been described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,552,046 and WO 01/093849 (incorporated<br>
by reference herein in their entireties), however further compounds with even more<br>
advantageous properties would be desirable.<br>
It has now been discovered that certain stereoisomers of one such esterified structural<br>
and/or functional analog of cisapride have distinct and particularly advantageous properties.<br>

by serum and/or cytosolic esterases than cisapride, thus avoiding the adverse effects<br>
associated with metabolism by cytochrome P450.<br>
Advantageously, the therapeutic compounds of the subject invention are stable in<br>
storage but have a relatively short half-life in the physiological environment; therefore, the<br>
compounds of the subject invention can be used with a lower incidence of side effects and<br>
toxicity.<br>
In a preferred aspect of the subject invention, therapeutic stereoisomeric compounds<br>
are provided that are useful in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and that<br>
contain an ester group, which is susceptible to degradation by esterases, thereby breaking<br>
down the compound and facilitating its efficient removal from the treated individual. In a<br>

drug detoxification system.<br>
A further aspect of the subject invention pertains to the breakdown products<br>
(preferably metabolic breakdown products, i.e., metabolites, generally acids of parent esters)<br><br>
that are produced when the therapeutic compounds of the subject invention are acted upon by<br>
an esterase. The presence of these breakdown products in the urine or serum can be used to<br>
monitor the rate of clearance of the therapeutic compound from a patient.<br>
Degradation of the compounds of the subject invention by esterases is particularly<br>
advantageous for drug metabolism because these enzymes are ubiquitously distributed and<br>
their activity is not dependent on age, gender, or disease state to the same extent as oxidative<br>
hepatic drug metabolism.<br>
The subject invention further provides methods of treating disorders, such as<br>
gastroesophageal reflux disease comprising the administration of a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of at least one stereoisomeric structural and/or functional analog of cisapride to an<br>

stereoisomeric structural and/or functional analogs of cisapride and pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of these esterified compounds.<br>
The subject invention further provides materials and methods for the treatment of<br>
emesis and such other conditions, including but not limited to dyspepsia, gastroparesis,<br>
constipation, and intestinal pseudo-obstruction, while substantially reducing adverse effects<br>
associated with the administration of cisapride.<br>
In a preferred aspect of the subject invention, therapeutic stereoisomeric compounds<br>
are provided which are useful in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux, dyspepsia,<br>
gastroparesis, constipation, post-operative ileus, and intestinal pseudo-obstruction and which<br>

and facilitating its efficient removal from the treated individual.<br>
The subject invention further provides methods of synthesizing the unique and<br>
advantageous compounds of the subject invention. Particularly, methods of producing and<br>
purifying such stereoisomeric compounds are taught. Methods of adding such ester moieties<br>
and of producing and purifying stereoisomers, are well known to the skilled artisan and can<br>
be readily carried out utilizing the guidance provided herein.<br>

In a preferred aspect, the subject invention pertains to stereoisomerically isolated<br>
compounds, and compositions comprising the compounds. The isolated stereoisomeric forms<br>
of the compounds of the invention are substantially free from one another (i.e., in<br>
stereoisomeric excess). In other words, the "R" forms of the compounds are substantially<br>
free from the "S" forms of the compounds and are, thus, in stereoisomeric excess of the "S"<br>
forms. Conversely, "S" forms of the compounds are substantially free of "R" forms of the<br>
compounds and are, thus, in stereoisomeric excess of the "R" forms. In one aspect of the<br>
invention, the isolated stereoisomeric compounds are in at least about 80% stereoisomeric<br>
excess.. In a preferred aspect, the compounds are in at least about 90% stereoisomeric excess.<br>
In a more preferred aspect, the compounds are in at least about 95% stereoisomeric excess.<br>
In an even more preferred aspect, the compounds are in at least about 97.5% stereoisomeric<br>
excess. In a most preferred aspect, the compounds are in at least about 99% stereoisomeric<br>
excess. Similarly, the "(+)" and "(-)" forms of the compounds are also provided in<br>
stereoisomeric excess.<br>
As described herein, the various stereoisomers have particular unexpected properties<br>
that, advantageously, can be used to customize treatment for a particular set of circumstances.<br>
Thus, for example, compounds containing the (3'R)-isomer in the quinuclidinyl ester moiety,<br>
i.e., compounds III and IV, are rapidly metabolized by esterases in human plasma, whereas<br><br>
compounds containing the (3'S)-isomer of quinuclidinol, i.e., compounds V and VI, undergo<br>
a much slower metabolism.<br>
Thus, the (3'R)-isomers of compound I can be used when a short-duration of action is<br>
preferred, for example stimulation of gastric motility in an acute episode, such as pulsatile<br>
administration to patients with acute gastroparesis, or in acute gastroesophageal reflux.<br>
Another advantage of rapid metabolism by esterases to an substantially less active<br>
metabolites, i.e., compound II, is the very low probability of drug-drug interactions and<br>
toxicity. Therefore these short-acting (R)-isomers can be advantageously used as an<br>
intravenous formulation for treating gastroesophageal reflux in premature newborn who<br>
notoriously are not able to metabolize drugs as well as adults because their CYP450 system is<br>
not fully developed. In these newborn, a drug having rapid metabolism by a system other<br>
than CYP450, e.g., esterases, is a great advantage. On the other hand, the (3'S)-isomers of<br>
compound I are best used in chronic situations of the same ailments, for example<br>
gastroparesis in diabetic patients or cancer patients under opiates, or in chronic<br>
gastroesophageal reflux in patients who need 24-hour coverage.<br>
In addition to their differences in metabolic fate, these separate isomers also have<br>
different binding affinities for the 5-HT4 receptor, thus suggesting different activities as well,<br>
and therefore different therapeutic uses. Thus, in a decreasing order of affinity for the 5-HT4<br>
receptor, the isomers can be ranked as follows (in parentheses are the binding constant Ki<br>
values); compound IV (1.4nM), compound VI (3.4nM), compound III (28nM), and<br>
compound V (72nM). These binding experiments were performed using the radiolabel<br>
displacement method described in standard textbooks and easily reproducible by persons<br>
skilled in the art of molecular biology.<br>
As a conclusion to these considerations: when the 3 and 4 positions are cis relative to<br>
each other, compound I is a mixture of 4 isomers, consisting of 2 pairs of enantiomers. The<br>
first pair of enantiomers is (+)(R)-compound I and (-)(S)-compound I (compounds IV and V,<br>
respectively), the second pair of enantiomers is (-)(R)-compound I and (+)(S)-compound I<br>
(compounds III and VI, respectively). Within each enantiomeric pair, each separate<br>
enantiomer has different properties regarding both their rate of hydrolysis by esterases and<br>
regarding their affinity at the 5-HT4 receptor. These different properties give them separately<br>
advantageous therapeutic uses which are not interchangeable, i.e., which are specific to each<br>
isomer, and which are not applicable to the racemic mixture. These differences of affinity at<br><br>
the receptor and these differences in metabolic rates are not predictable and neither is it<br>
possible to dissect these properties when testing the racemic mixture.<br>

The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" or "a pharmaceutically acceptable salt<br>
theregf' refer to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids or bases<br>
 including inorganic acids and bases and organic acids and bases. Since the compound of the<br>
 present invention is basic, salts may be prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic<br>
acids. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts for the compound of the<br>
present invention include acetic, benzenesulfonic (besylate), benzoic, camphorsulfonic, citric,<br>
ethenesulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glutamic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic,<br>
maleic, malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, mucic, nitric, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric,<br>
succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, p-toluenesulfonic, and the like. Preferred acid addition salts are the<br>
chloride and sulfate salts. In the most preferred aspect, structural and/or functional analogs of<br>
cisapride are administered as the free base or as the mono or dihydrochloride salt. <br><br>
As used herein, the terms "treatment" and "treating" encompass prophylactic<br>
administration of the compound or a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound<br>
("prophylaxis") as well as remedial therapy to reduce or eliminate a disease or disorder<br>
mentioned herein. Prophylactic administration is intended for prevention of disorders and<br>
may be used to treat a subject that is at risk of having or suffering from one or more disorders<br>
mentioned herein. Thus, as used herein, the term "treatment", or a derivative thereof,<br>
contemplates partial or complete inhibition of the stated disease state, when an active<br>
ingredient of the invention is administered prophylactically or following the onset of the<br>
disease state for which such active ingredient of the is administered. "Prophylaxis" refers to<br>
administration of the active ingredient(s) to a mammal to protect the mammal from any of the<br>
disorders set forth herein, as well as others.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount necessary to achieve<br>
a derived therapeutic effect such as: 1) an amount sufficient to alleviate reflux disease, 2) an<br>
amount sufficient to alleviate nausea and vomiting, or 3) an amount sufficient to alleviate a<br>
condition caused by gastrointestinal motility dysfunction. Therapeutically effective amounts<br>
of structural and/or functional analogs of cisapride are encompassed by the above-described<br>
dosage amounts and dose frequency schedule.<br>

The term "esterified cisapride" means therapeutic compounds of the subject invention<br>
that are structural and/or functional analogs of cisapride, which contain a hydrolysable group,<br>
generally an ester, that does not detract from the ability of these compounds to provide a<br>
therapeutic benefit, but which makes these compounds more susceptible to degradation by<br>
hydrolases, particularly serum and/or cytosolic esterases, and which reduces the interaction of<br>
the cytochrome P-450 drug detoxification system with the cisapride compounds. Esterase-<br>
mediated metabolism of esterified cisapride compounds reduces the role of the cytochrome P-<br>
450 drug detoxification system in cisapride metabolism and reduces or eliminates adverse<br>
effects caused by cisapride.<br><br>
The term "structural analog" as used herein means that a described compound shares<br>
structural characteristics with a parent compound. For example, a structural analog of<br>
cisapride may share one or more structural characteristics with the parent cisapride<br>
compound, such as a substituted aryl ring connected to a piperdine ring through an amide<br>
linker, but differ structurally in other ways, such as the inclusion or deletion of one or more<br>
other chemical moieties.<br>
The term "functional analog" as used herein means that a described compound shares a<br>
functional characteristic with a parent compound. For example, a functional analog of<br>
cisapride may share few, if any, structural characteristics with cisapride, but affect a similar<br>
function, for example, 5-HT4 agonism.<br>
The term "adverse effects" includes, but is not limited to, gastrointestinal disorders<br>
such as diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and abdominal grumbling; tiredness; headache;<br>
increased systolic pressure; death; ventricular tachycardia; ventricular fibrillation; torsades de<br>
pointes; QT prolongation; increased heart rate; neurological and CNS disorders; and<br>
interaction of cisapride with other drugs given concurrently such as but not limited to<br>
digoxin, diazepam, ethanol, acenocoumarol, cimetidine, ranitidine, paracetamol, and<br>
propranolol.<br>
The term "gastroesophageal reflux disease" as used herein means the incidence of,<br>
and the symptoms of, those conditions causing the backward flow of the stomach contents<br>
into the esophagus.<br>

mean providing relief from or preventing the symptoms of nausea and vomiting induced<br>
spontaneously or associated with emetogenic cancer chemotherapy or irradiation therapy.<br>
The term "treating a condition caused by gastrointestinal motility dysfunction" as used<br>
herein means treating the symptoms and conditions associated with this disorder which<br>
include, but are not limited to, gastroesophageal reflux disease, dyspepsia, gastroparesis,<br>
constipation, post-operative ileus, and intestinal pseudo-obstruction.<br>
The term "prokinetic" as used herein means the enhancement of peristalsis in, and<br>
thus the movement through the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
The term "dyspepsia" as used herein means a condition characterized by an<br>
impairment of the power or function of digestion that can arise as a symptom of a primary<br><br>
gastrointestinal dysfunction or as a complication due to other disorders such as appendicitis,<br>
gallbladder disturbances, or malnutrition.<br>
The term "gastroparesis" as used herein means a paralysis of the stomach brought<br>
about by a motor abnormality in the stomach or as a complication of diseases such as<br>
diabetes, progressive systemic sclerosis, anorexia nervosa, or myotonic dystrophy.<br>

due to a disruption in muscle tone following surgery.<br>
The term "intestinal pseudo-obstruction" as used herein means a condition<br>
characterized by constipation, colicky pain, and vomiting, but without evidence of physical<br>
obstruction.<br>
Preparation of Compounds<br>
The chemical synthesis of various analogs of cisapride can be performed by the<br>
methods described in European Patent Application No. 0,076,530 A2 published Apr. 13,<br>
1983, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,962,115 and 5,057,525 and in Van Daele et al., Drug Development<br>
Res. 8: 225-232 (1986), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their<br>
entireties, and modified by the incorporation of an ester group at a point convenient in the<br>
synthesis of the disclosed compounds. Exemplary, non-limiting synthesis schemes for<br>
certain esterified cisapride analogs of the subject invention are provided in WO 01/093849.<br>
The invention is illustrated further by the following examples, which are not to be<br>
construed as limiting the invention in scope or spirit to the specific procedures described in<br>
them. Those having skill in the art will recognize that the starting materials may be varied<br>
and additional steps employed to produce compounds encompassed by the invention, as<br>
demonstrated by the following examples. Those skilled in the art will also recognize that it<br>
may be necessary to utilize different solvents or reagents to achieve some of the above<br>
transformations. In some cases, protection of reactive functionalities may be necessary to<br>
achieve the above transformations. In general, such need for protecting groups, as well as the<br>
conditions necessary to attach and remove such groups, will be apparent to those skilled in<br>
the art of organic synthesis. When a protecting group is employed, deprotection step may be<br>
required. Suitable protecting groups and methodology for protection and deprotection such<br><br>
as those described in Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis by T. Greene are well known<br>
and appreciated in the art.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, all reagents and solvents are of standard commercial<br>
grade and are used without further purification. The appropriate atmosphere to run the<br>
reaction under, for example, air, nitrogen, hydrogen, argon and the like, will be apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of 6-[4R-(4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxy-benzoylamino)-3S-methoxy-<br>
piperidin-l-yl]-hexanoic acid l-aza-bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3'R-yl ester, dihydrochloride salt (ATI-<br>
7505 Dihydrochloride Salt)<br><br><br>
Step 1: Resolution of Racemic Norcisapride<br>
(-)-Dibenzoyl-L-tartaric acid ((-)-DBT, about 1 part by weight) was dissolved in<br>
ethanol and filtered to remove residual particulates. Separately, racemic norcisapride (about<br>
0.8 part by weight) was dissolved in a mixture of ethanol and water and then filtered. The<br>
filtrate was heated to about 75°C before adding the (-)-DBT solution. After stirring at this<br>
temperature for about 30 minutes, the mixture was slowly cooled for several hours to about 5<br>
°C and the product salt was collected under vacuum filtration and washed with EtOH/H2O<br>
mixture. The wetcake was recrystallized from EtOH/H2O by heating to about 79 °C and slow<br><br>
cooling to about 5 °C as before. The product was collected on a vacuum filter and washed<br>
with EtOH/H2O to give a wetcake.<br>
The wetcake was suspended in water and the pH was adjusted to about 12 using 7%<br>
(WAV) aq. NaOH. The resulting suspension was stirred for about 3 hours at room<br>
temperature before filtering under vacuum and washing the solid material with water and<br>
drying under vacuum. The product was then retreated with (-)-DBT to form the salt by the<br>
same general procedure described above. The isolated salt was then neutralized with aq.<br>
NaOH as described above. The product was isolated on a filter and dried as before to provide<br>
(+)-norcisapride base (about 0.25 parts by weight). The e.e. by chiral HPLC analysis was<br>
about 100% (+)-norcisapride. The optical rotation was about +5° (methanol; 25°C and<br>
589 nm), confirming the positive isomer of norcisapride.<br>
Step 2: Coupling with Ethyl 6-bromobexanoate<br>
(+)-Norcisapride (about 1 part by weight), potassium carbonate (about 0.48 part by<br>
weight) and potassium iodide (about 0.063 part by weight) were suspended in anhydrous USP<br>
ethanol. Ethyl 6-bromohexanoate (about 0.76 part by weight) was added slowly to the<br>
suspension at room temperature. The mixture was heated to reflux until completion of the<br>
reaction. Subsequent cooling to room temperature the reaction mixture was filtered to<br>
remove, e.g., inorganic solids, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to<br>
about one-half the volume. The product was precipitated by slowly adding the crude material<br>
to cold water (about 13 parts by weight) with rapid stirring. The precipitate was filtered<br>
under vacuum and washed with water and then reprecipitated twice more by dissolution in<br>
anhydrous ethanol and slow addition into cold water as before. The resulting wetcake was<br>
washed with n-heptane and resuspended in ethyl acetate and n-heptane (1:9; v/v) and stirred<br>
for about 1 hour and before filtering and drying under vacuum to yield 0.73 parts by weight<br>
of the coupled product as a white solid.<br>
Step 3: Coupling with (R)-3-Quinuclidinol and Dihydrochloride Salt Formation<br>
The ester (1 part by weight) and (R)-3-Quinuclidinol (about 1.12 part by weight)<br>
were suspended in toluene before slowly adding titanium (IV) ethoxide (about 0.5 part by<br>
weight) to the stirred suspension. The mixture was heated to about 91 °C under a stream of<br>
nitrogen, and partial vacuum was applied to the flask through a distillation apparatus in order<br>
to azeotropically remove the ethanol. Additional toluene was added as needed to maintain a<br><br>
minimum solvent volume in the flask. The reaction was considered complete after about 33<br>
hours.<br>
The mixture was cooled to about room temperature and extracted five times with<br>
water. The organic layer was concentrated under reduced pressure and the resulting residue<br>
was redissolved in EtOH/iPrOH (about 1:1 v/v) and then filtered through a 0.45 micron<br>
membrane filter to remove any particulates. Concentrated hydrochloric acid was added<br>
slowly to the stirred filtrate to precipitate out the desired product as the dihydrochloride salt.<br>
The resulting suspension was stirred for several hours at room temperature and collected<br>
under vacuum filtration and rinsed with EtOH/iPrOH (1:1; v/v) to provide 0.53 part by<br>
weight of the crude product salt.<br>
Crude dihydrochloride salt was resuspended in ethanol and heated to reflux before<br>
cooling to room temperature over about 1 hour. The product was collected under vacuum<br>
filtration and rinsed with ethanol and then air-dried.- The solids were resuspended in ethanol<br>
and warmed to about 55 °C to give a clear solution before adding warm isopropanol and the<br>
product was allowed to precipitate by slow cooling to room temperature. The resulting<br>
suspension was stirred for several hours before vacuum filtering and rinsing with, e.g.,<br>
isopropanol. The product was vacuum dried, initially at room temperature for several hours<br>
and then at about 55 °C until a constant weight was achieved.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of (R)-quinuclidin-3-yl 6-((3 S,4R)-4-(4-amino-2-chloro-6-<br>
methoxybenzamido)-3-methoxypiperidin-1-yl)hexanoate<br>
Step 1: Synthesis of ethyl 4-(dibenzylamino)-3-methoxypiperidine-l-carboxylate (1):<br><br>
To a solution of racemic ethyl 4-amino-3-methoxypiperidine-l-carboxylate (1 part by<br>
mole) in DMF were added benzyl bromide (about 2.2 part by mole), potassium carbonate<br>
(about 2.4 part by mole) and potassium iodide (about 0.2 part by mole) respectively. The<br>
reaction was heated to about 80 °C. After about 6 hours, the reaction was slowly diluted with<br><br>
water (about 12 parts by volume) and extracted with, for example, ethyl acetate. The organic<br>
layer was washed with brine and then dried over anhyh. Na2SO4. Subsequent filtration and<br>
concentration of the solvent provided the 1 as the yellow-orange oil (1 part by mole).<br>
Step 2. Synthesis of N,N-dibenzyl-3-methoxypiperidin-4-amine (2):<br><br>
To a solution of 1 was added NaOH (about 10 part by mole) in isopropanol and the<br>
mixture was stirred and heated to reflux. After about 3 to about 5 hours, the reaction was<br>
cooled to room temperature and the alcoholic solvent was removed via rotary evaporation.<br>
The mixture was diluted with water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was<br>
brined washed before drying over anhyh. Na2SO4. Subsequent filtration and concentration<br>
of the solvent provided a crude oil which was purified over SiO2 (CH2Cl2 : MeOH: NH4OH;<br>
(about) 15:1:0.01) to furnish 2.<br>
Step 3. Synthesis of (3S,4R)-N,N-dibenzyl-3-methoxypiperidin-4-amine (3):<br><br>
(-)-Dibenzoyl-L-tartaric acid (about 1.2 part by weight) is dissolved in ethanol before<br>
slowly adding to a solution of 2 (about 1 part by weight). The solution is gently warmed and<br>
then allowed to cool to room temperature to crystallize the salt product. The salt is filtered<br>
and washed with EtOH/H2O before suspending in water and basifying by adding aq. NaOH<br>
(7%, wt/wt) until the pH reaches about 12. The suspension is stirred vigorously at rt and the<br>
solid is filtered away, washed with water and vacuum dried to furnish the cis-isomer 3.<br>
Step 4. Synthesis of ethyl 6-((3S,4R)-4-(dibenzylamino)-3-methoxypiperidin-1-yl)hexanoate<br>
(4):<br><br><br>
To a solution of 3 (1 part by mole) in DMF are added ethyl bromohexanoate (about<br>
1.2 part by mole), potassium carbonate (about 1.4 part by mole) and potassium iodide (about<br>
0.2 part by mole) respectively. The reaction is then heated to 80 °C. After about 8 h, the<br>
reaction is slowly diluted with water (about .12 part by volume) and extracted with ethyl<br>
acetate. The organic layer is washed with brine and then dried over anhyd. Na2SO4.<br>
Subsequent filtration and concentration of the solvent furnishes the crude material.<br>
Purification over SiO2 and gives the alkylated material 4.<br>
Step 5. Synthesis of (R)-quinuclidin-3-yl 6-((3S,4R)-4-(dibenzylamino)-3-methoxypiperidin-<br>
l-yl)hexanoate (5):<br><br>
Titanium tetraethoxide is added to a mixture of 4 (1 part by mole) and (R)-(-)-3-<br>
quinuclidinol (1 part by mole) in toluene. The reaction mixture is equipped with a dean-stark<br>
apparatus before heating to about 90 oC and partial vacuum is then applied (additional toluene<br>
is added as needed to main the requisite solvent level). The mixture is then cooled to rt and<br>
the reaction is diluted with ethyl acetate and then water is added to the resulting mixture. The<br>
organic layer is separated, brine washed, dried over anhyd. Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated.<br>
Purification over SiO2 gives the enantiomerically enriched 5.<br>
Step 6. Synthesis of (R)-quinuclidin-3-yl 6-((3S,4R)-4-amino-3-methoxypiperidin-1-<br>
yl)hexanoate (6):<br><br><br>
A solution of 5 (1 part by mole) in EtOH is added to a reaction flask containing<br>
palladium on carbon (about 0.2 part by mole). The mixture is then evacuated of air before<br>
subjecting to hydrogenolysis condition by using atmospheric H2. Upon completion of the<br>
reaction, the palladium is filtered off under a pad of celite followed by EtOH washes. The<br>
filtrated is concentrated via rotary evaporation to furnish 6.<br>
Step 7. Synthesis of (R)-quinuclidin-3-yl 6-((3S,4R)-4-(4-amino-2-chloro-6-<br>
methoxybenzamido)-3-methoxypiperidin-l-yl)hexanoate(7):<br><br>
To a solution of, for example, ethyl chloroformate (1 part by mole) in THF at about 0<br>
°C is added the benzoic acid (1 part by mole) in portions. The mixture is warmed to rt for<br>
about 1 h before cooling to about 0 °C and adding dropwise a solution of 6 (1 part by mole).<br>
The reaction is then warmed to rt. Upon completion of the reaction, reaction is quenched by<br>
addition of a sat'd solution of NaHCO3 and extracting over EA. The organic layer is brine<br>
washed, dried over anhyd. Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated to furnish the desired product 7.<br>
Example 3<br>
Alternate synthesis of ATI-7505:<br><br>
Under acidic conditions, l-benzylpiperidin-4-one (1) and hydrobromic acid are<br>
reacted in the presence of acetic acid to generate N-benzyl-3-bromopiperidin-4-one (2).<br>
Treatment of 2 with a sodium methoxide and methanol solution provides 1-benzyl-4,4-<br>
dimethoxypiperidin-3-ol (3). [The presence of the beta-amino group negates the possibility<br>
of a Favorskii-type reaction.] Methylation of the hydroxyl group is done using a hydride base<br>
followed by treatment with iodomethane in the presence of DMF as the solvent to furnish<br>
compound 4.<br><br><br>
Subsequent acetal hydrolysis using 1% sulfuric acid in the presence of heat yields a<br>
piperidine 5, which can then undergo a reductive amination using, for example, sodium<br>
cyanoborohydride and ammonium acetate in methanol to yield l-benzyl-3-methoxypiperidin-<br>
4-amine (6). At this stage, 6 can undergo a chiral resolution technique. This can be<br>
accomplished, for example, using (-)-DBT or other variant of tartaric acid in the presence of<br>
the suitable solvent to afford exclusively asymmetrically pure compound 7. Boc group<br>
protection of the primary amine in 7 can be accomplished using Boc anhydride in the<br>
presence of THF solvent to obtain 8. A debenzylation reaction by hydrogenolysis using Pd/C<br>
in methanol in the presence of atmospheric hydrogen gas set the stage for the alkylation step.<br>
Treatment of 6-bromohexanenitrile in the presence of mild base and DMF generates<br>
compound 10. A nitrile to ester conversion using (R)-quinuclidinol in the presence of dilute<br>
acid generates 11. Subsequent removal of the Boc group using TFA furnishes the free amine,<br><br>
which can undergo a coupling reaction with requisite benzoic acid in the presence of a<br>
coupling reagent such as ethyl chloroformate to afford ATI-7505 as an enantiomerically pure<br>
material.<br><br>
Alternatively, compound 9 can be alkylated using ethyl 6-bromohexanoate in the presence of<br>
mild base. Subsequent removal of the Boc group yields compound 13. Titanium mediated<br>
transesterification of 13 using (R)-quinuclidinol and titanium tetraethoxide in toluene solvent<br>
generates ATI-7505. Carlsburg esterase hydrolyzes esters that are of the S-configuration,<br>
therefore leaving intact esters that are of the R configuration. Therefore treatment of<br>
diasteriomeric mixtures of 14 with the Carlsburg esterase may also yield ATI-7505.<br>
Example 4<br>
(+) and (-)-norcisapride can be made from its racemic mixture by resolution of the<br>
enantiomers using conventional means such as optically resolving acids, according to the<br>
method described in US Patent 6,147,093, or in "Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions",<br>
by J. Jacques, A. Collet, and S.H. Wilen (Wiley-Interscience, New York, NY), or in S.H.<br>
Wilen et al., Tetrahedron (1977) 33:2725.<br>
The 4 isomers were obtained in low-mg amounts by using preparative column<br>
chromatography followed by evaporation of the solvent. This method is useful for preparing<br>
small amounts for analytical and characterization purposes. This is a standard separation<br>
method used routinely in analytical labs in order to isolate and characterize metabolites.<br>
Possible synthetic routes to Compound IV, Compound VI and (+)-Compound II are<br>
described below using (+)-norcisapride as a starting material. The routes to Compound III,<br><br>
Compound V and (-)-Compound II are identical except that they use (-)-norcisapride as a<br>
starting material.<br>
Example 5<br>
Production of (+)-Compound II, ethyl ester<br>
A equimolar mixture of (+)-norcisapride and ethyl 6-bromohexanoate (1 equivalent<br>
each), a catalytic amount of KI, and K2CO3 (2 equivalents) in DMF is heated at about 60 C<br>
for several hours or until TLC analysis indicates that the reaction is over. After cooling to<br>
room temperature, water is added and the mixture is extracted with EtOAc. The combined<br>
organic extracts are washed successively with water, 10% LiCl(aq) solution and brine, then<br>
dried over Na2SO4. Concentration gives (+)-compound II, ethyl ester.<br>
Production of (+)-Compound II<br>
A mixture of crude (+)-compound II, ethyl ester, from above (1 eq.), KOH (2M, 5 eq.)<br>
in MeOH and THF (enough to dissolve) is stirred at room temperature for approximately 1 to<br>
2 hours. The MeOH and THF are removed under vacuum, and the residue is diluted with<br>
water. Wash with an organic solvent such as EtOAc. The aqueous layer is acidified to pH ~5<br>
using HC1. The precipitate is filtered off and dried to give (+)-Compound II.<br>
Production of Compound IV and Compound VI<br>
A mixture of (+)-Compound II (I eq.), (R)-(-)-3-quinuclidinol HC1 salt (1 eq.), EDAC<br>
(1 eq.) and DMAP (1 eq.) in DMF iss heated at around 50C overnight. After cooling and<br>
diluting with water, the mixture is purified by chromatography or by crystallization to<br>
provide Compound IV. Similarly, using (S)-(+)-quinuclidinol, Compound VI is obtained.<br>
The following compounds are prepared essentially according to methods and<br>
procedures described above. The compound names were generated using either ChemDraw<br>
Ultra version 8.03, which is available from Cambridgesoft Corporation or ACD Namepro<br>
software, version 6.0.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Dosage rates and routes of administration of the disclosed compounds are similar to<br>
those already used in the art and known to the skilled artisan (see, for example, Physicians'<br>
Desk Reference, 54th Ed., Medical Economics Company, Montvale, NJ, 2000).<br>
The magnitude of a prophylactic or therapeutic dose of structural and/or functional<br>
analog of cisapride in the acute or chronic management of diseases and/or disorders described<br>
herein will vary with the severity of the condition to be treated, and the route of<br>
administration. The dose, and perhaps the dose frequency, will also vary according to the age,<br>
body weight, and response of the individual patient. In general, the total daily dose range for<br>
structural and/or functional analogs of cisapride, for the conditions described herein, is from<br>
about 1 mg to about 200 mg, in single or divided doses. Preferably, a daily dose range should<br>
be between about 5 mg to about 100 mg, in single or divided doses, while most preferably, a<br>
daily dose range should be between about 5 mg to about 75 mg, in single or divided doses. It<br>
is preferred that the doses are administered from 1 to 4 times a day. In managing the patient,<br>
the therapy should be initiated at a lower dose, perhaps about 5 mg to about 10 mg, and<br>
increased up to about 50 mg or higher depending on the patient's global response. It is further<br>
recommended that children, and patients over 65 years, and those with impaired renal or<br>
hepatic function, initially receive low doses, and that they be titrated based on individual<br>
response(s) and blood level(s). It may be necessary to use dosages outside these ranges in<br><br>
some cases as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Further, it is noted that the clinician<br>
or treating physician will know how and when to interrupt, adjust, or terminate therapy in<br>
conjunction with individual patient response.<br>
The compounds of the subject invention can be formulated according to known<br>
methods for preparing pharmaceutically useful compositions. Formulations are described in<br>
detail in a number of sources which are well known and readily available to those skilled in<br>
the art. For example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Science by E.W. Martin describes<br>
formulations which can be used in connection with the subject invention. In general, the<br>
compositions of the subject invention are formulated such that an effective amount of the<br>
bioactive compound(s) is combined with a suitable carrier in order to facilitate effective<br>
administration of the composition.<br>
The compositions of the subject invention include compositions such as suspensions,<br>
solutions and elixirs; aerosols; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose,<br>
diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents, and the like, in the case<br>
of oral solid preparations (such as powders, capsules, and tablets) with the oral solid<br>
preparations being preferred over the oral liquid preparations. A preferred oral solid<br>
preparation is capsules.. The most preferred oral solid preparation is tablets. Preferred<br>
amounts of active ingredient (i.e., an structural and/or functional analog of cisapride) in a<br>
solid dosage form are about 5 mg, 10 mg, and 25 mg.<br>
Further, acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations<br>
include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories and dispersible granules. A<br>
solid carrier can be one or more substances which may act as diluents, flavoring agents,<br>
solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents<br>
or encapsulating materials.<br>
The disclosed pharmaceutical compositions may be subdivided into unit doses<br>
containing appropriate quantities of the active_component. The unit dosage form can be a<br>
packaged preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in paper or plastic<br>
containers or in vials or ampules. Also, the unit dosage can be a liquid based preparation or<br>
formulated to be incorporated into solid food products, chewing gum, or lozenge.<br>
In addition to the common dosage forms set out above, the compounds of the present<br>
invention may also be administered by controlled release means and/or delivery devices such<br><br>
as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos.: 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; and<br>
4,008,719, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing the patient with<br>
an effective dosage of a structural and/or functional analog of cisapride. For example, oral,<br>
rectal, parenteral (subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous), transdermal, and like forms of<br>
administration may be employed. Dosage forms include tablets, troches, dispersions,<br>
suspensions, solutions, capsules, patches, and the like.<br>
One aspect of the invention provides a method of treating gastroesophageal reflux<br>
disease in a mammal, while substantially reducing the concomitant adverse effects associated<br>
with the administration of cisapride, which comprises administering to a human in need of<br>
such treatment, a therapeutically effective amount of a structural and/or functional analog of<br>
cisapride, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. A preferred aspect is the treatment of<br>
gastroesophageal reflux disease in humans.<br>
Another aspect of the invention provides a composition for the treatment of a human<br>
suffering from gastroesophageal reflux disease, which comprises a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of a structural and/or functional analog of cisapride, or a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salt thereof.<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention provides a method of eliciting an anti-<br>
emetic effect in a mammal, while substantially reducing the adverse effects associated with<br>
the administration of cisapride, which comprises administering to a mammal in need of such<br>
anti-emetic therapy, a therapeutically effective amount of structural and/or functional analogs<br>
of cisapride, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Preferably, the mammal is a<br>

In an additional aspect, the present invention encompasses an anti-emetic composition<br>
for the treatment of a mammal in need of anti-emetic therapy, which comprises a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a structural and/or functional analog of cisapride, or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention includes a method of treating a condition<br>
caused by gastrointestinal motility dysfunction in a mammal which comprises administering<br>
to a mammal in need of treatment for gastrointestinal motility dysfunction, a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of a structural and/or functional analog of cisapride, or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt thereof. Conditions caused by gastrointestinal motility dysfunction include,<br><br>
but are not limited to, dyspepsia, gastroparesis, constipation, post-operative ileus, and<br>
intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Preferably, the mammal is a human.<br>
The observation that cisapride enters the central nervous system and binds to 5HT4<br>
receptors indicates that cisapride may have centrally-mediated effects. Cisapride is a potent<br>
ligand at 5HT4 receptors, and these receptors are located in several areas of the central<br>
nervous system. Modulation of serotonergic systems has a variety of behavioral effects.<br>
Accordingly, the compounds of the subject invention can be used in the treatment of: 1)<br>
cognitive disorders, including but not limited to Alzheimer's disease; 2) behavioral disorders,<br>
including but not limited to schizophrenia, mania, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and<br>
psychoactive substance use disorders; 3) mood disorders, including but not limited to<br>
depression and anxiety; and 4) disorders of control of autonomic function, including but not<br>
limited to essential hypertension and sleep disorders.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides methods of treating cognitive,<br>
behavioral, mood, or autonomic function control disorders in a mammal comprising the<br>
administration of a therapeutically effective amount of structural and/or functional analog of<br>
cisapride, or a.pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Preferably, the mammal is a human.<br>
A TI-7S05 Binds with High Affinity to 5-HT4 Receptors<br>
The 5-HT4 receptor is known to be the major receptor subtype involved in the<br>
prokinetic activity of cisapride in the gut. ATI-7505 has a high binding affinity for 5-HT4<br>
receptor, with a low nanomolar IC50. As shown in Table 1, the affinity of ATI-7505 for the<br>
5-HT4 receptor was 18-fold greater than cisapride and at least 360-fold greater than the<br>
ATI-7505 major metabolite, ATI-7500.<br><br><br>
A TI- 7505 is a Highly Potent Partial Agonist at Human 5-HT4 Receptor<br>
ARYx performed in vitro assays based on adenylyl cyclase stimulation in cells<br>
engineered to stably express human 5-HT4 receptor. ATI-7505 proved to be a highly potent<br>
5-HT4 receptor agonist, whereas its major metabolite, ATI-7500 was relatively weak (Figure<br>
1 and Table 2). The estimated EC50 of ATI-7505 (4 nM) was approximately 10-fold lower<br>
than that of cisapride (49 nM), and approximately 100-fold lower than that of ATI-7500 (395<br>
nM). Based on its estimated Emax value, ATI-7505 had 85% of the efficacy of 5-HT<br>
(serotonin) (Table 2), demonstrating that ATI-7505 is a partial agonist of HT4 receptors.<br><br>
ATI-7505 Accelerates Gastric Emptying in Fed Dogs To characterize the effects of ATI-<br>
7505 on gastric emptying, experiments were performed in a post-prandial model involving<br>
conscious dogs instrumented with sets of strain gauge transducers placed on the stomach and<br>
small bowel. The objective of the experiments was to measure the time required for<br>
migrating motor contractions (MMCs) to return to baseline following ingestion of a solid<br>
meal. A drug-induced shortening of MMC return time indicated an early end of the digestive<br>
period due to accelerated gastric emptying. Immediately after completion of an MMC in the<br>
mid-small intestine, various doses of test drugs (vehicle, ATI-7505, or cisapride) were<br>
infused intravenously (IV) over 20 minutes. At the end of the drug infusion, the dogs were<br>
fed a meal. Gut contractions were recorded for a minimum of 60 minutes prior to the start of<br>
the drug infusion to establish the fasting state and to identify the onset of MMC in the<br>
duodenum, and at least 30 minutes after the return of MMC in the duodenum. Quantitative<br>
comparisons of the treatments were based on the time of MMC return as an index of gastric<br>
emptying following ingestion of a solid meal. As summarized in Figure 2, ATI-7505<br>
significantly shortened the time of MMC return, indicating an acceleration of gastric<br>
emptying in normal fed dogs. Cisapride showed a similar pattern of action.<br><br>
A TJ- 7505 Increases Gastric and Small Intestinal Motor Activity with Negligible Effect on<br>
Colonic Activity<br>
Experiments were performed in fasted, conscious dogs to evaluate the gastric, small<br>
intestinal and colonic motor activity of ATI-7505 compared to cisapride. A specific goal was<br>
to determine the dose sizes of ATI-7505 (IV and PO) that most closely mimic the pattern and<br>
magnitude of contractile activity caused by cisapride at typical therapeutic doses in dogs (0.5<br>
mg/kg IV; lmg/kgPO).<br>
When given IV and PO, both ATI-7505 and cisapride caused prokinetic effects in the<br>
dog gut. The onset of action typically occurred within 1 to 2 minutes and 25 to 30 minutes<br>
following IV and PO administration, respectively. The effect of ATI-7505 on gastric and<br>
small intestinal motor activity mimicked cisapride. Like cisapride, ATI-7505 appeared to<br>
cause dose-dependent stimulation of antral and small bowel contractility with relatively little<br>
effect on colonic motor activity. The prokinetic effects caused by ATI-7505 in the upper GI<br>
tract occurred along with a small but significant (p 
migrating contractions (GMC).<br>
ATI-7505 was not associated with the development of retrograde giant migrating<br>
contractions (RGC). Like cisapride, ATI-7505 had a minimal effect on migrating motor<br>
complex (MMC) characteristics in the antrum as well as proximal, mid and distal small<br>
intestine. With regard to MMC frequency and phase III duration, only one significant<br>
difference was noted: PO ATI-7505 increased MMC frequency in the proximal small<br>
intestine relative to the controls. The dogs tolerated the IV and PO doses of ATI-7505 well<br>
and exhibited no side effects such as diarrhea, anorexia, or weight loss.<br>
Overall, the results showed that on a mg/kg-basis, ATI-7505 was approximately twice<br>
as potent as cisapride. In addition, the actions of ATI-7505, like those of cisapride, were<br>
consistent with a mechanism involving the facilitation of acetylcholine release from enteric<br>
neurons rather than a direct smooth muscle action. In conclusion, ATI-7505 increases gastric<br>
and small intestinal motor activity in a cisapride-like manner with minimal-to-no effect on<br>
colonic activity.<br>
The Metabolism of ATI-7505 is CYP450-Independent<br>
Based on data from pooled human microsomes, ATI-7505 undergoes<br>
biotransformation to a single metabolite, ATI-7500, which does not appear to be subject to<br>
further metabolism. The conversion of ATI-7505 to ATI-7500 was not dependent on the<br><br>
presence of NADPH. Thus the major biotransformation pathway for ATI-7505 occurs<br>
independently of CYP450 enzymes.<br>
ATI-7505 Does Not Inhibit CYP450 Enzymes<br>
To test the potential for ATI-7505 and/or its main metabolite, ATI-7500 to act as<br>
CYP450 inhibitors, these two molecules were screened using Gentest Supersomes™.<br>
Consistent with published reports, cisapride had significant inhibitory activity against<br>
CYP450 enzyme isoforms, CYP3A4,2D6 and to a lesser extent 2C9. Neither ATI-7505 nor<br>
its primary metabolite, ATI-7500 displayed significant inhibitory activity against these three<br>
CYP450 isoforms, nor against a panel of other isoforms known to play a role in drug<br>
metabolism.<br>
ATI-7505 Has Negligible Affinity for the Cardiac Channel, IKr<br>
The rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium (K+) current in humans (human Ikr)<br>
is a K+ channel that is encoded by the human-ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG). Cisapride<br>
is known to produce QT interval prolongations via a blockade of Ikr, and it was therefore of<br>
interest to determine if ATI-7505 and ATI-7500 have important inhibitory effects on human<br>
IKr. The test system was mammalian HEK-293 cells expressing the hERG K+ channels, in<br>
which the potassium current was measured by whole cell patch-clamp technique. The ranking<br>
of the IC50 values was: cisapride (9.5 nM) &gt; ATI-7505 (24,521 nM) &gt; ATI-7500 (204,080<br>
nM) (Table 3). Overall, the findings indicate that ATI-7505 has a significantly lower pro-<br>
arrhythmic potential than cisapride and suggest that both ATI-7505 and ATI-7500 have<br>
negligible affinity for human Ikr channels.<br><br><br>
ATI-7505 Does not Induce Important Electrophysiological Changes in Guinea Pig<br>
Hearts<br>
The cardiac electrophysiological effects of ATI-7505 were examined in isolated,<br>
perfused guinea pig hearts. The study examined ATI-7505, ATI-7500 and cisapride, all of<br>
which were each tested at concentrations up to 10,000 nM. The no observed effect level<br>
(NOEL) was defined as the highest concentration of test compound not showing a response<br>
that was significantly different from baseline (p 
were tested: (1) QT interval; (2) MAPD90; (3) SA interval; (4) QRS interval; (5) AH interval;<br>
and (6) HV. While ATI-7505 was a very weak modulator of cardiac electrophysiologic<br>
parameters, its metabolite, ATI-7500 entirely lacked electrophysiological activity (Table 4).<br>
The NOEL for ATI-7500 was &gt; 10,000 nM for the entire set of 6 cardiovascular parameters.<br>
Since cisapride had a NOEL of 10 nM for the combined set of 6 cardiac parameters tested,<br>
while ATI-7505 had a combined NOEL of 1,000 nM, ATI-7505 appears to lack the potency<br>
of cisapride in modulating cardiac electrophysiologic parameters. Overall, the findings<br>
demonstrate that ATI-7505 is significantly safer than cisapride with regard to the potential to<br>
induce important cardiac electrophysiologic fluctuations.<br><br>
Metabolism in human microsomal preparations<br>
The metabolism of these compounds was studied in pooled human microsomes in the<br>
presence and absence of the Cytochrome P-450 cofactor NADPH and both the disappearance<br>
of parent and the appearance of the corresponding acid metabolite, i.e., the corresponding<br>
compound-II isomer, monitored with time.<br><br>
As shown in Table 5, Compounds III and IV were rapidly hydrolyzed by esterase to<br>
their respective metabolites (+) and (-)-Compound II The metabolism was not dependent on<br>
CYP450 since the rate of hydrolysis was independent on NADPH presence, which is a<br>
necessary cofactor for CYP450 to function. In contrast, (±)-S Compounds V and VI<br>
appeared to be quite stable with time under the same conditions. In this experiment, the<br>
amount of substrate (compounds III, IV, V, and VI) remaining in the reaction after 5, 60, and<br>
90 minutes were evaluated by a tandem HPLC-MS method. This remaining amount was<br>
correlated with the appearance of the metabolite compound II. The sum of remaining<br>
substrate and compound II was constant over time and equal to the amount of starting<br>
material at time zero, therefore indicating that hydrolysis was the only metabolic reaction<br>
taking place.<br><br>
Metabolism in fresh human blood.<br>
Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO to make 12.5 mM stock solution and<br>
diluted with water to a final concentration of 2.5mM (DMSO/H20 =20/80). Fresh blood was<br>
collected into heparinized tubes from 3 human donors and blood was stored on ice until<br>
incubation. Separate aliquots of blood from each donor were pipetted into 1.5 mL centrifuge<br>
tubes and the tubes were pre-incubated in a shaking water bath at 37°C for 5 minutes. The<br>
reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 µL of the appropriate test compound stock to each<br>
tube (final concentration = 100 µM). Incubations were quenched after 0, 5, 15, 30 and 60<br>
minutes, by the addition of acetonitrile (750 mL), centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 2 minutes<br>
and the supernatant analyzed on an Agilent 1100 HPLC system. Separations were<br>
accomplished on a Keystone Intersil ODS2, 250X4.6mm, 5 m column. The aqueous mobile<br>
phase consisted of 20 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.7) and the organic phase<br>
acetonitrile. A gradient was used: initial condition consisted of 20% acetonitrile for 1<br><br>
minute. The acetonitrile concentration was increased linearly to 90% over the next 8 minutes<br>
and held there for 1 minute. The system was then recycled to initial conditions over the<br>
course of 1 minute and held there for 4 minutes before the next injection. The peak area for<br>
