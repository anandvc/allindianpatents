THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(Section 10)<br>
"A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARA TION OF THIENO[3,2-CJ PYRIDINE COMPOUNDS'"<br>
Cadila Healthcare Limited, a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, of Zydus Tower, Satellite Road, Ahmedabad 308 015, Gujarat, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of the invention and manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
A PROCESS TO PREPARE CLOPIDOGREL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of thieno[3,2-c]pyridine derivatives of general formula (I), in either racemic or optically active (+) or (-) forms and their salts, wherein X, the substituent on benzene ring represents either a hydrogen or halogen atom such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br><br><br><br>
(I)(±)or(+)or(-)<br>
Preferably, X represents 2-chloro.<br><br>
The present invention also describes a process for preparing the compounds of general formula (II), in either racemic or optically active (+) or (-) forms and their salts, where X, the substituent on benzene ring represents either a hydrogen or halogen atom such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>
CONH,<br>
(II)(±)or(+)or(-)<br>
Preferably X represents 2-chloro. These compounds are useful intermediates to prepare compounds of general formula (I).<br>
The compounds represented by formulae (I) and (II) have one asymmetric carbon and hence, to obtain optically active compounds of formula (I) or of formula (II), option available is either to resolve the racemic intermediate/final product or use an optically active intermediate. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thieno[3,2-c]pyridine derivatives disclosed in FR 2,215,948, FR 2,530,247 and FR 2,612,929, are pharmacologically active and have significant anti-aggregating and anti-thrombotic properties. One such example is 'Clopidogrel', (tS)-(+)-(2-chlorophenyl)-(67-dih\dro-4 Hthieno[3,2-c]pyridin-5-yl) acetic acid methyl ester and its pharmaceutical!} acceptable salts. Later, it was found that the biological activity resides only with (5)-(+)-stereoisomer (US 4,847,265). As 'Clopidogrel base  is an oily liquid, in order to prepare a convenient formulation, the base is converted into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Suitable salts of 'Clopidogrel base' can be formed with taurocholate, hydrobromide and sulfuric acid. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
The reported methods to synthesize the compounds of general formula (I) (US 4529596, GB 0420706 and GB 0466569), use a-halophenylacetic acid derivatives, which are lacrimatory and irritant in nature. The processes to synthesize such compounds involve multiple steps, and have other<br><br>
drawbacks due to the chemicals/reagents used, which usually are difficult to handle, scale-up and unfavorable from human health as well as environmental point of view. Moreover, overall yields of these processes range from poor to average. Various other synthetic approaches found in literature, involve expensive or hazardous chemicals, which do not significantly improve the yield of the desired product.<br>
Recently, radiolabelled (bezene-U-13C) racemic(±)-Clopidogrel has been prepared as a standard for metabolic studies in an overall yield of 7 % using orthometalation/chlorination of benzoic acid derivative (Chem. Abst., 133:281711, 2000). Various other strategies are disclosed in: WO 98/51681, WO 98/51682, WO 98/51689, WO 99/18110, US 4,876,362, US 5,036,156, US 5,132,435, US 5,139,170, US 5,204,469 and US 6,080,875.<br>
Recently, a new polymorph of Clopidogrcl bisulfate (named as formII) has been disclosed in patent application (WO 99/65915), which has a melting point of 176 ± 3 °C. It also mentions that the compound disclosed in the earlier US patent (US 4,847,265), had a different melting point of about 184 ± 3 °C (now referred as, form I). It has been shown that both the polymorphs have distinct and characteristic XRD and IR spectrum.<br>
Consequently, the present invention aims to provide an inexpensive and commercially viable process to prepare compounds of formula (f) in good yields. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>

AnotJier aspect of die present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a novel intermediate of formula (IV) and its salts.<br><br><br><br>
Yet another aspect of the process of invention includes preparation of intermediate described by general formula (IV) and as depicted in the Scheme 2, by Strecker reaction, using a secondary amine (Organic Synthesis Collective Volume HI. page no. 275)<br><br>
(IV) (±)<br>
SCHEME2<br>
The process to prepare compounds of formula (IV) includes, reacting amine of formula (V) or its salt, with a cyanide derivative of the general formula (VII), wherein M represents either alkali metals such as Na, K, Li, or H, trimethylsilyl (TMS) and the like; with 2-chlorobenzaldehyde of formula (VI). The synthesis of amine or its salt having formula (V) is described in FR 2608607.<br>
The above reaction can be carried out in various ways. A few such methods are outlined in Scheme 2 shown above. Initially, amine of formula (V), or its salt, is reacted with cyanide (VII), wherein M is as defined earlier, followed by addition of 2-chlorobenzaldehyde (VI). Alternatively, 2-chlorobenzaldehyde (VI) is treated with cyanide of formula (VII), wherein M is as defined earlier, and the intermediate cyanohydrin is further reacted with amine of formula (V) or its salt. In en alternative method, 2-chlorobenzaldehyde of formula (VI) is added to hydrogen sulfite derivative of formula (VIII) wherein M' represents Na, K, Li and the like; followed by reaction with cyanide of formula (VII), wherein M is as defined earlier, and finally amine of formula (V) or its salt in an in situ reaction. Irrespective of the variations in the reaction methodology, the yield of resultant intermediate (IV) obtained is comparable.<br>
The preferred method involves, addition of 2-chlorobenzaldehyde of formula (VI) to hydrogen sulfite derivative of formula (VIII). The salt formed is treated with cyanide of formula (VII), and finally with an amine of formula (V) or its salt in presence of suitable reagent and solvents.<br>

However, when HCN (g) (Scheme 2, Intermediate VII, M = H) is used the required temperature is in the range of about -30 °C to -10 °C.<br>
This reaction may be carried out in the absence or presence of an inert atmosphere such as N2, He or Ar. The duration of the reaction may vary from 1 hrs to 3 days, more specifically 2 hrs to 2 days.<br>
It is preferable to react a compound of formula (V), hydrogen sulfite derivative (VIII), and cyanide derivative (VII) with respect to 2-chloro benzaldehyde (VI) in the ratio preferably between I to 1.2 equivalents.

acctonitrilc, propionitrile, THF, dioxane and the like, the solvent used optionally may contain water up to 5 %, but presence of water or its amount is not critical. Suitable temperature range for the resolution includes temperature from 0 °C to reflux temperature of the solvent used, preferably 0 °C to 80 °C. The acid chiral reagents, which can be used to form a diastereomeric salt, include tartaric acid, man del ic acid, lactic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, lactic acid, maleic acid, amino acids and the like.<br>
By repeated crystallization from a suitable solvent, the precipitated salt is enriched in the salt of dextrorotatory isomer of the desired diastereomer to yield a product of constant optical rotation.<br>
Suitable base reagent for the hydrolysis of diastereomeric salt includes sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate and potassium hydrogen carbonate in aqueous media at temperatures varying between 5 °C to 25 °C.<br>
Finally, the desired salt of compound of formula (II), (III), or (IV); or pharmaceutically acceptable salt of compound of formula (I) can be formed from the corresponding stereoisomer and a suitable acid. The optically pure (5)-(+) compound of formula (I), is converted into its bisulfate salt using sulfuric acid 70 % to 98 %, in an appropriate solvent at suitable temperature to afford (+)- Clopidogrel bisufate, polymorph I as desired.<br>
Alternatively, the diastereomers formed may be separated by conventional methods of purification such as fractional crystallization, column chromatography and the like followed by cleavage of salt to give product of desired stereochemistry. It is preferable to use, such a chiral agent, which can selectively form diastereoisomer with either R or S stereoisomer of intermediate I, II, III or IV. The chiral reagent used may be in 0.5 to 1.1 molar ratio.<br>
Determination of the enantiomeric purity of the (+)-dextrorotatory and (-)-laevorotatory enantiomers may be carried through proton NMR spectroscopy with the addition of a chiral rare earth reagents (shift reagents) or by HPLC using a chiral stationary phase as well as through measurement of optical rotation.<br>
The absolute stereochemistry of the diastereomeric salt of H, III or IV compounds may be determined using conventional methods, such as X-ray crystallography The absolute stereochemistry of chiral compounds can also be determined by comparing it with the reference standards known in literature.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable mineral and organic acid salts of optically active enantiomers of Clopidogrel are prepared using various acidic salts, which forms a part of this invention but are not limited to hydrogen sulfates, hydrohalides, taurocholates and the like.<br>
More specifically the present process of invention results in Clopidogrel bisulfate of melting point 184 ±3 °C, which is characteristic of Clopidogrel bisulfate form I. Alternatively, Clopidogrel bisulfate form II can also be prepared by known method (WO 99/65915, FR 98 07464).<br>
The process of this invention also includes the process to recycle the unwanted stereoisomer through racemization. The conditions for raccmization of all the intermediates of general formula II, III or IV as well as final product I, involves the similar solvent and catalyst in equimolar ']uantities.<br><br>
Suitable catalyst i? generally a base such as LDA(Lithium diisopropylamide), KOH, NaOH, lC-/-BuO", NaOMe, "NaH, KH and the like. Suitable solvent used during the resolution can include solvents or mixtures thereof such as (C1-C4) alcohol, (C1-C4)ketone, ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, THF, dioxane and the like; the solvent used optionally may contain water up to 5 %. Suitable temperature range for the resolution includes temperature from 0 °C to reflux temperature of the solvent used, preferably 0 ° to 80 °C.<br>
