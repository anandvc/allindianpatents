				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to highly antiseptic<br>
ophthalmic solutions containing an intraocular pressure<br>
reducing agent as well as to ophthalmic solutions in which an<br>
intraocular pressure reducing agent is dispersed in a molecular<br>
state in a vehicle for ophthalmic solutions.<br>
Background Art<br>
It has so far been known that angiotensin II antagonists<br>
decrease intraocular pressure on local administration<br>
(EP-A795326; EP-A631780; WO 95/21609; WO 91/15206 ; and so on).<br>
The following compounds are known as typical examples of the<br>
antagonists<br>
JP-A 2001-55329 discloses a locally administerable<br>
composition decreasing intraocular pressure in which boric<br>
acids and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acids in combination are<br>
formulated in an ophthalmic solution containing angiotensin<br>
II antagonist in order to enhance the intraocular pressure<br>
reducing effect of the antagonist.<br>
On the other hand, selection of formulation components<br>
should be made carefully particularly in ophthalmic solutions<br>
because they are directly administered to eyes, highly sensitive<br>
organs of the human body. Antiseptic agents for use in<br>
ophthalmic solutions cannot be considered similarly as those<br>
(preservatives) used in foods, drinks, preservatives for<br>
contact lens, and the like. For example, it is necessary to<br>
consider the irritant properties of the ophthalmic solutions<br>
to eyes, various side effects occurring after administration<br>
to eyes, and the time-depending stability of the ophthalmic<br>
solutions permitting long-term preservation.<br>
The antiseptic agents so far employed in ophthalmic<br>
solutions Include benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride,<br>
parahyroxybenzoic acid esters, chlorobutanol, chlorhexidine,<br>
sorbic acid salts, and the like. In particular, among those<br>
antiseptics, cationic one such as benzalkonium chloride or<br>
chlorhexidine has widely been used since they are chemically<br>
stable and have a good antiseptic effect. However, even if<br>
a cationic antiseptic agent is formulated in the ophthalmic<br>
solutions containing a compound which has the chemical structure<br>
of the following general formula (I), it would give no desired<br>
preservative effect and sometimes make the ophthalmic solutions<br>
turbid.<br>
The compound having the chemical structure of the<br>
following general formula (I) has the properties of forming<br>
such an associated molecule (micell) as tetramer to octamer<br>
in an aqueous solution depending on the concentration, and<br>
sometimes forms a heterogeneous solution microscopically.<br>
[wherein R1 represents a group of the following structural<br>
formula (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), (Id), (Ie) or (If)]<br>
In this situation, when a cationic antiseptic agent is<br>
formulated in ophthalmic solutions containing a compound of<br>
the general formula (I), additives to enhance the antiseptic<br>
effect of the cationic agent with no turbidity in the ophthalmic<br>
solutions have been required. It has also been required that<br>
the compound which has the chemical structure of the general<br>
formula (I) causes no molecular association in the ophthalmic<br>
solutions to yield highly microscopically homogeneous<br>
ophthalmic solutions.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the<br>
present inventors worked intensively to study additives to<br>
ophthalmic solutions and found that when a basic amine compound<br>
such as trometamol [tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane],<br>
lidocaine, or nicotinamide is formulated in the ophthalmic<br>
solutions containing a compound of the general formula (I) and<br>
a cationic antiseptice agent , such a basic amine compound<br>
markedly enhances the antiseptic effect of the ophthalmic<br>
solutions and yield no turbidity in the ophthalmic solutions.<br>
Thus, the invention was completed.<br>
That is, the present invention provides (1) a highly<br>
antiseptic ophthalmic solution which comprises a compound<br>
having the chemical structure of the general formula (I) or<br>
its  pharmaceutically  acceptable  salt  or  derivative<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "the present compound" ), a cationic<br>
antiseptic agent and a basic amine compound.<br>
[wherein R1 represents a group of the following structural<br>
formula (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), (Id), (Ie) or (If)]<br>
In the above-mentioned ophthalmic solutions, the present<br>
invention preferably provides:<br>
(2)  the ophthalmic solution wherein R1 is a group of the<br>
above-mentioned structural formula (Ia), (Ib) or (Ic);<br>
(3)  the ophthalmic solution wherein the present compound<br>
is selected from:<br>
4-(l-hydroxy-l-methylethyl)-2-propyl-l-{4-[2-(tetraz<br>
ol-5-yl)phenyl]phenyl}methylimidazole-5-carboxylic acid and<br>
2-ethoxy-l-[2"-(lH-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]methy<br>
1]-lH-benzimidazole-7-carboxylic acid;<br>
(4)   the ophthalmic solution wherein the cationic<br>
antiseptic agent is a quaternary ammonium salt;<br>
(5)   the ophthalmic solution wherein the quaternary<br>
ammonium salt is benzalkonium chloride or cetrimide;<br>
(6)  the ophthalmic solution wherein the basic amine<br>
compound is at least one selected from trometamol, lidocaine<br>
and nicotinamide;<br>
(7)  the ophthalmic solution additionally containing<br>
boric acids;<br>
(8)   the ophthalmic solution additionally containing<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acids; and<br>
(9)  the ophthalmic solution additionally containing<br>
boric acids and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acids.<br>
Subsequently, the ophthalmic solution of the present<br>
invention was analyzed by means of NMR to determine the chemical<br>
shift of each proton in the present compound, and found that<br>
the chemical shift of each proton in the ophthalmic solution<br>
of the present invention appears at a higher magnetic field<br>
(upfield) compared with that in an aqueous solution of the<br>
present compound. The shift of the chemical shift to the higher<br>
magnetic field indicates that the electron density of each proton<br>
of the present compound is changed and that the molecular<br>
association of the present compound is dissociated in the<br>
ophthalmic solution resulting in dispersion almost in a state<br>
of the molecule. In addition, the measured particle size of<br>
the associated molecule (micell) of the present compound was<br>
found to be reduced to 1/2 or less. That is, in another aspect,<br>
the present invention provides an ophthalmic solution<br>
containing the present compound as an active ingredient wherein<br>
the active ingredient is dispersed in a molecular state in a<br>
vehicle for ophthalmic solutions.<br>

The term "dispersion in a state of molecule" indicates<br>
that in the case where the present compound is formulated in<br>
an ophthalmic solution, the chemical shift of each proton appears<br>
at a higher magnetic field (upfield) compared with the shift<br>
in an aqueous solution of the present compound. More<br>
specifically, it indicates a state in which the protons on the<br>
phenyl ring of the present compounds are shifted by O.Olppm<br>
or more, preferably 0.02ppm or more, to the higher upfield<br>
position. Details will be described in Examples below. The<br>
state of molecular dispersion can be confirmed by the fact that<br>
the particle size of the present compound prepared in an<br>
ophthalmic solution becomes about 1/2 or less of that in an<br>
aqueous solution, indicating it being clearly dispersed almost<br>
in a state of the molecular form in the solution.<br>
The ophthalmic solutions of the present invention may<br>
optionally be prepared in combination with additives, for<br>
example, buffer, stabilizer, isotonic agent, pH adjustor,<br>
solubilizing agent, thickener, dispersant, and so on.<br>
The buffer is exemplified by the above-mentioned boric<br>
acids , as well as phosphoric acids, acetic acids, carbonic acids,<br>
citric acids, and the like. The phosphoric acids, acetic acids,<br>
carbonic acids, and citric acids include phosphoric acid. acetic<br>
acid, carbonic acid, citric acid, per se, and their equivalent<br>
substances.  The equivalent substances to phosphoric acid.<br>
acetic acid, carbonic acid, and citric acid mean compounds which<br>
generate phosphate ion, acetate ion, carbonate ion, and citrate<br>
ion on dissolution in water. Preferred ones are boric acids,<br>
particularly, boric acid, boric anhydride, borax and sodium<br>
borate decahydrate.<br>
The stabilizer is exemplified by the above-mentioned<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acids, as well as<br>
dibutylhydroxytoluene, sodium hydrogen sulfite, and the like.<br>
Preferred are ethylenediaminetetraacetic acids, and<br>
particularly preferred are ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid,<br>
disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate dihydrate, trisodium<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetate trihydrate, and tetrasodium<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetate tetrahydrate.<br>
Since the combined use of boric acids and<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acids enhances the intraocular<br>
pressure reducing effect of the ophthalmic solutions, when a<br>
buffer and a stabilizer are added, it is appropriate to add<br>
boric acids as a buffer and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acids<br>
as a stabilizer in combination.<br>
The isotonic agent includes, for example, glycerin,<br>
propylene glycol, sodium chloride, potassium chloride,<br>
sorbitol, mannitol, and the like.<br>
The pH adjustor includes, for example, hydrochloric acid,<br>
citric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, sodium hydroxide,<br>
potassium hydroxide, boric acid, borax, sodium carbonate.<br>
sodium bicarbonate, and the like.<br>
The solubilizing agent includes, for example, polysorbate<br>
80, polyoxyethylene hardened castor oil 60, macrogol 4000,<br>
polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and the like.<br>
The thickener and dispersant include, for example,<br>
macromolecules of cellulose type such as<br>
hydroxypropylinethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, etc.,<br>
sodium alginate, polyvinyl alcohol, carboxyvinylpolymer,<br>
polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and the like.<br>
The ophthalmic solutions of the present invention may<br>
preferably be adjusted at pH 5.0 to 9.0 and at approximately<br>
1.0 of osmotic pressure ratio. The dose of the ophthalmic<br>
solution may be selected depending on the condition, age, and<br>
the formulation, and practically may be administered to eyes<br>
in a concentration of 0.01 to 15%(w/v) of the present compound<br>
one to several times a day.<br>

(2) Preservation effectiveness test<br>
In order to examine the antiseptic effect of the ophthalmic<br>
solutions of the present invention, the following preservation<br>
effectiveness test was conducted.<br>
[Preparation of ophthalmic solutions]<br>
Example 1<br>
In 75ml of purified water was dissolved 2 g of trometamol,<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (proper amount) and borax<br>
(proper amount) . To this solution was added 4 g of Compound<br>
A and then, after dissolution, 0.004 g of benzalkonium chloride.<br>
The solution was adjusted at pH 7.0 with 1 mol/L sodium hydroxide<br>
solution, and then made up to 100 ml in total with addition<br>
of purified water. The solution was then filtered through a<br>
membrane filter (manufactured by MILLIPORE)[hydrophilic<br>
Durapore (material: hydrophilic polyvinylidene difluoride),<br>
0. 22\xia] in a sterilized condition to give an ophthalmic solution.<br>
Example 2<br>
An ophthalmic solution was prepared in the same manner<br>
as in Example 1, except that cetrimide was used in place of<br>
benzalkonium chloride.<br>
Example 3<br>
An ophthalmic solution was prepared in the same manner<br>
as in Example 1, except that lidocaine was used in place of<br>
trometamol.<br>
Example 4<br>
An ophthalmic solution was prepared in the same manner<br>
as in Example 1, except that nicotinamide was used in place<br>
of trometamol.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
An ophthalmic solution was prepared in the same manner<br>
as in Example 1, except that no trometamol was added thereto.<br>
[Test Method]<br>
The preservation effectiveness test was carried out<br>
according to the Japanese Pharmacopoeia XIV. E. coli, P.<br>
aeruginosa, S. aureus, and A. niger were used as test<br>
microorganisms. Viable microbe cell number was measured 6 hours<br>
(for bacteria), 24 hours (for bacteria), and 7 days (for fungus)<br>
after incubation, and the survival rate of the microorganisms<br>
was calculated according to the following equation. Tables<br>
1 and 2 show the results.<br>
Survival rate (%) = Viable microbe cell number /Initial<br>
number x 100<br>
*EDTA: Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid<br>
[Stability Test]<br>
The ophthalmic solutions of Examples 1 to 4 were preserved<br>
at 20°C under a humidity of 40% for a period of 4 months; there<br>
was no change in appearance, pH, and the residual rate of Compound<br>
A and no occurrence of degradation products in the solutions.<br>
Though the ophthalmic solution containing a low concentration<br>
(approximately 0.5%) of Compound A and a cationic antiseptic<br>
agent became turbid, the turbidity was improved by adding a<br>
basic amine compound.<br>
(3) Measurement of the chemical shift by NMR<br>
[Preparation of a sample for use in NMR measurement]<br>
Example 5<br>
To 80 mL of heavy water was added 1 g of Compound A and<br>
2 g of trometamol. In this solution was dissolved 1 mol/L<br>
sodium hydroxide solution (NaOD), which was then adjusted to<br>
pH 7.0 with 1 mol/L hydrochloric acid (DC1) and made up to 100<br>
mL in total with addition of heavy water. The solution was<br>
then filtered through a membrane filter (MILLIPORE) in a sterile<br>
condition to give a sample solution.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
A sample solution for comparison was prepared in the same<br>
manner as in Example 5, except that no trometamol was added.<br>
Example 6<br>
In 80 mL of heavy water was dissolved 4 g of Compound<br>
A and 2 g of trometamol. The solution was adjusted to pH 7.0<br>
with 1 mol/L sodium hydroxide solution (NaOD), which was made<br>
up to 100 mL in total with addition of heavy water. The solution<br>
was then filtered through a membrane filter (MILLIPORE) in a<br>
sterile condition to give a sample solution.<br>
Comparative Example 3<br>
A sample solution for comparison was prepared in the same<br>
manner as in Example 6, except that no trometamol was added.<br>
Example 7<br>
In 80 mL of heavy water was dissolved 4 g of Compound<br>
A, 2 g of trometamol, 0.004 g of benzalkonium chloride,<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (proper amount) and borax<br>
(proper amount). The solution was adjusted to pH 7.0 with 1<br>
mol/L sodium hydroxide solution (NaOD), which was made up to<br>
100 mL in total with addition of heavy water. The solution<br>
was then filtered through a membrane filter (MILLIPORE) in a<br>
sterile condition to give a sample solution.<br>
Comparative Example 4<br>
A sample solution for comparison was prepared in the same<br>
manner as in Example 7, except that no trometamol was added.<br>
[Test Method]<br>
1H-NMR spectra were measured using an NMR apparatus (JEOL<br>
ECP-500) (measured at 35°C; internal standard HDO; solvent D2O).<br>
The variables of the chemical shift (unit: ppm) of Compound<br>
A in Example 5 versus that (standard) in Comparative Example<br>
2 are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 1. The variables of the chemical<br>
shift of Compound A in Examples 6, 7 and Comparative Example<br>
4 versus that (standard) in Comparative Example 3 are shown<br>
in Table 4 and Fig.2. In this connection, the symbols a to<br>
k in Tables and Figs correspond to the variables of the chemical<br>
shift of the hydrogen atoms attached to the carbons a to k as<br>
shown in the following structural formula.<br>
*EDTA: Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid<br>
(4) Measurement of the particle size<br>
[Method of Measurement]<br>
The particle size of Compound A in Example 6 and Comparative<br>
Example 3 (wherein water was used in place of heavy water, and<br>
NaOH in place of NaOD) was measured using a particle size<br>
measurement apparatus [NICOMP: Submicron Particle Sizer Model<br>
370] at a wavelength of 514.5 nm and a temperature of 23°C<br>
(measuring time: 10 min).<br>
[Result of Measurement]<br>
The mean particle size of Compound A in Example 6 was<br>
reduced to 1/2 or less in comparison with that of Comparative<br>
Example 3.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As apparent from Tables 1 and 2, the antimicrobial effect<br>
of the ophthalmic solutions containing Compound A and a cationic<br>
antiseptic agent (e.g., benzalkonium chloride, cetrimide) to<br>
bacteria and fungi is markedly increased bv adding a basic<br>
amine compound to the solutions. Therefore, an ophthalmic<br>
solution comprising a compound having the chemical structure<br>
of the general formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salt or derivative thereof, a cationic antiseptic agent and<br>
a basic amine compound exhibits a highly potent preservative<br>
effect against a variety of microorganisms such as bacteria<br>
and fungi. From the results as shown in Tables 3 and 4 and<br>
Figs. 1 and 2, it is found that in the ophthalmic solutions<br>
of the present invention the chemical shift of each proton of<br>
Compound A is shifted to the higher magnetic field and the mean<br>
particle size of micell is reduced to 1/2 or less.<br>
