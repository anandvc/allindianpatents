Magnetic field applicator to heat magnetic or magnetizable substances or solids in biological tissue<br>
The invention relates to a magnetic Field applicator to heat magnetic or magnetizable substances or solids in biological tissue according to the introductory clause of claim 1.<br>
Cancer diseases are treated in a generally known manner through surgical removal, chemotherapy, radiation therapy or a combination of these methods. Each of these methods is subject to certain limitations: Especially at advanced stages, following metastasis, when the tumor is located close to critical body areas or in case of diffused tumor growth with uncertain localization, surgical removal of the tumor is not possible or only offers minimal chances for a cure. For this reason surgical intervention is generally combined with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The former can only be as precise as the localization of the tumor by means of image-producing processes and with utmost avoidance or care of healthy tissue. Chemotherapeutic means on the other hand act systemically, i.e. on the entire body. In this case bone marrow toxicity or lack of specificity of the therapy is limiting. Undesirable side effects are therefore unavoidable with all of these therapy methods at the present state of the art and as a rule also cause damage to healthy tissue.<br>
Hyperthermia as another modality has gained in significance over the last few years, consisting in heating the tumor tissue to temperatures above 41   C so that the success of treatment, i.e. local control and to some extent even survival can be improved in combination with surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. In the temperature range between 41 and 46./C and with the assistance of the body, a controlled and rather slow reduction of the tumor tissue takes place. This process is called hyperthermia, while acute destruction of cells takes place at higher temperatures starting at 47 "C, depending on temperature in form of necrosis, coagulation or carbonization, and the process is then called thermo-ablation. Hyperthermia systems according to the state of the art are suitable only for the above-mentioned hyperthermia or only for thermo-ablation.<br><br>
2<br><br><br><br>
One general problem with hyperthermia is that no precisely localizable and most of all homogenous heating of target region of the body is as a rule possible according to the state of the art. Under certain physiological conditions (e.g. oxygen deprivation, low pH) in the tumor cancerous cells are sensitive to hyperthermia, but this only applies to few instances. Hyperthermia in itself is not any more effective on tumor cells than on normal tissue. For this reason, the limitation of heating to the area indicated by medicine (and which need not necessarily be confined to the tumor) is especially important, and not realized according to the state of the art.<br>
According to the state of the art, systems dominated by electrical fields are used which radiate the electromagnetic waves as a rulein the megahertz range from antennae or other antenna-shaped objects or arrays of antennae, which are used for regional or local hyperthermia. For this either the electrical field of individual electrical-field applicators is used for the so-called interstitial hyperthermia, or the interference of antenna arrays is used for the deep hyperthermia. It is a difficulty common to all of these electrical-field-dominated systems that the power consumption can only be achieved by means of expensive controls of the electrical field and that the heating depends on the electrical conductivity of the applicable target tissue, which is by nature very heterogeneous, so that an uneven heating of the electrical field results, even with homogenous radiation. Especially at the transition points of body regions with very different electrical conductivity, excessive power, or so-called "hot spots" occur for that reason, and these may result in pain and burns inflicted on the patient. The consequence is a reduction of the total emitted power usually demanded by the patient, so that as a result the temperature required to damage the tumor tissue irreversibly (41 -42 _C) is not reached in the target region, so that the therapy is not successful. Furthermore, due to the interference of dipole arrays, only the production of a second electrical field maximum is possible in areas further inside the body. For physical reasons, the greatest power consumption always takes place at the surface of the body, i.e. at the maximum radius. Added to this is the fact that the blood flow through the tumor as well as the normal tissue often changes under hyperthermia, and that this change cannot be compensated for<br>
3<br><br>
by means of systems dominated by electrical fields from the outside because of the rather low control possibilities of the field.<br>
Other processes according to the state of the art are ultrasound, preferably for thermo-ablation. and interstitial microwave applicators. The latter possess low penetration depth because of the frequency and can therefore only be used in form of interstitial antennae. In addition, infrared for whole-body hyperthermia is used, as well as extra-corporeal systems to heat body fluids.<br>
Furthermore, a hyperthermia process for the therapy of prostate cancer is known (US patent 5,197.940) in which 'Thermoseeds" are implanted in the area of the tumor, consisting of magnetic, in particular ferromagnetic or magnetizable material or containing such material. These thermoseeds are typically several centimeters long, with a diameter in the millimeter range. It is obviously necessary to implant such thermoseeds surgically at great cost. These thermoseeds are subjected for treatment to an alternating magnetic field produced outside a patient, whereby heat in the thermoseeds is produced by known hysteresis effects in form of hyperthermia.<br>
These seeds are heated according to the "hot source" principle, i.e. that while the seeds are heated, the temperatures in the surroundings of the seed drop exponentially, so that the distance between the seeds may not be more than 1 cm in clinical application. In case of greater or uneven distances thermal under-dosing occurs which can also prevent the success of the therapy. Especially with larger tumors a very narrow implantation of the seed becomes necessary, so that the method becomes surgically expensive and stressful to the patient. Aside from the small distance, the seeds must be oriented parallel to the magnetic alternating field foroptimal power consumption. The Curie temperature in so-called self-regulating thermoseeds prevents overheating in that the ferrite passes into a non-magnetizable state when the Curie temperature has been reached and no further power consumption takes place.<br>
4 <br>
A magnetic coil of an oscillatory circuit is used here as the magnetic field applicator for the magnetic alternating field, and a patient's body region with the implanted thermoseeds can be placed in the axis of this oscillatory circuit. In practice air coils are used in the central area of which a patient is sitting on a non-magnetizable supporting plate during treatment.<br>
In hyperthermia with thermoseeds the high cost of surgery and the severe inva sion of the<br>
method, the risk of an imprecise orientation or a change in position of the seeds and the<br>
ensuing risk of thermal under-dosing as well as a limitation of the method to tumors of<br>
smaller size are disadvantages.<br>
In another known hyperthermia process (WO 97 43005) for tumor therapy, magnetizable microcapsules are proposed which reach the area of the tumor through the blood stream. In this way surgical implantation of magnetizable elements should be avoided among other things, since with implantations, the danger exists in addition to the stress to which a patient is subjected, that malignant tumor cells ma\ be dispersed into healthy tissue when a cut is made into the tumor. A linear magnetic alternating field is used with a frequency in the range of 10 kHz to 500 kHz. The microcapsules are to be used in conjunction with a highly magnetizable material, so that the force of the magnetic alternating field which is required for the exposure to a magnetic field can be manageable with respect to the instrumentation structure of the required cooling system as well as to the electrical energy supply. A practical instrumentation structure is however not indicated.<br>
In a very much similar, known hyperthermia process (EP 0 913 167 A2) rotating magnetic fields with a frequency in the range greater than 10 kHz are used as fields. To produce the rotating magnetic alternating field used here, a magnetic field applicator of this type is indicated only sketchily and schematically. The magnetic field applicator comprises a magnetic yoke with two pairs of pole shoes across from each other and separated each other'by a gap in the exposure volume and two pairs of magnetic coils assigned to these pole shoes. In reality a rectangular magnetic yoke is shown whereby a<br>
5<br><br><br>
pole shoe is aligned on the center of the rectangle, starting from the center of each yoke branch, so that a space of exposure to a magnetic field is formed there. Cylinder coils are mounted on the pole shoes and face each other while being connected to an associated capacitor arrangement to form an oscillatory circuit.<br>
The schematic representation of a magnetic field applicator to carry out the above-mentioned hyperthermia process does not yet lead beyond the experimentation stage to a practical industrial solution as is required for the sake of favorable production and operating costs, minimal space requirement and low leakage field and optimal therapeutic effect for utilization under hospital conditions.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to create a magnetic field applicator to heat magnetic or magnetizable substances or solids in biological tissue which would meet the above requirements with respect to industrial production for utilization under hospital conditions or other possibly industrial application.<br>
This object is attained through the characteristics of claim 1.<br>
According to claim 1. the.magnetic yoke and the pole shoes consist of assembled ferrite building blocks mounted together. In addition, the magnetic yoke is made in form of an M. with three legs and with two parallel vertical yoke elements of identical geometry at a distance from each other and with two transversal yoke elements connected between them in the center of which the pole shoes with magnetic coils across from each other are located. A transversal yoke element with appertaining magnetic coil is made so that it can be displaced relative to the other transversal yoke element for the adjustment of the width of the gap in the exposure volume. The closure of magnetic flux is advantageously subdivided here on both sides into two paths of equal length having the same geometry. The mechanics of the relative position of at least one transversal yoke element are simpler than for a G-shaped magnetic yoke because the vertical yoke elements are usable as bilateral supports.    <br>
6<br><br><br>
For hyperthermia, in particular with magnetic fluids, alternative field forces of approximately 15 to 20 kA/m at approx. 50 to 100 kHz are necessary. With a volume exposed by a magnetic field of 8 to 30 1 capacities of approximately 18 kW to 80 kW must be produced by a hyperthermia installation. This energy must be produced as high frequency and must then be removed again in form of heat, since only a few watts are produced in the magnetic fluid for the hyperthermia in the body of a patient.<br>
With the arrangement claimed in claim 1 it is possible that to keep the volume exposed by a magnetic Field as well as leakage fields advantageously low and to limit them to an area in the patient's body which is to undergo therapy, so that the required energy expenditure and the expenditure necessary for heat transport can be reduced. To this a magnetic yoke and pole shoes made of ferrite building blocks as well as the form of the magnetic yoke contribute in particular, so that undesirable excesses in flow density-together with resulting large losses can be reduced considerably.<br>
The utilization of ferrite building blocks in combination with the high alternating frequency of approx. 50 to 100 kHz makes possible an advantageous limitation of the volume exposed by a magnetic field, whereby only about 1/2000 of the energy which would have an equivalent air volume is moved in the ferrite volume. This considerable advantage is accompanied by the fact that t/he ferrite building blocks are prone to losses, whereby e.g. a doubling of the flow density in the work area can already result in 5 to 6 times greater losses. For this reason appropriate measures are indicated below in order to keep the flow density low, and in particular to avoid undesirable flow density increases or to at least reduce them considerably.<br>
Ferrites are ceramic-like building blocks that can be produced in any desired form at reasonable cost, in particular not in the overall form of the magnetic yoke used here. For this reason the invention proposes that the magnetic yoke be composed of ferrite building "blocks, whereby disturbances in a flow that should be as even as possible may occur at transition points. Advantageous solutions for the management of thesje problems are indicated further below.<br>
7<br><br>
The magnetic field applicator according to the invention is equally well suited to carry out hyperthermia treatments as thermo-ablation procedures. In addition the magnetic field applicator according to the invention is suitable to warm other substances or solids for medical applications other than in cancer therapy. Among the latter are all the heat-related medical applications.such as heat-induced implant or stent regeneration, implant or stent surface activation, heating of inflamed body areas not affected by cancer for therapeutic purposes, facilitating contrast media distribution or improvement through magnetic alternating field excitation of super-paramagnetic contrast media, the mobilization of molecular-biological, cell-biological and development-physiological processes through excitation of magnet-carrier-assisted gene transfer systems, ligands, receptors, transmitters, other signal molecules as well as the triggering of material metabolism processes and endocrinal processes.<br>
For this purpose, and according to claim 2, a component consisting of a lower transversal yoke element and the appertaining pole shoe with magnetic coil are installed fixedly. It is then ossible for example to install a patient carriage with patient support and carriage position display made of plastic on this fixed pole shoe, whereby the patient need no longer be moved during an adjustment of the width of the gap in the exposure volume. Relative to this fixed component, a portal consisting of the two vertical yoke elements and the upper transversal yoke element with appertaining pole shoe with magnetic coil can then be adjusted by means of a Vertical adjustment device in order to establish the width of the gap in the exposure volume.<br>
A vertical adjustment device can be made in form of a simple linear drive according to claim 3, which moves preferably a vertical magnetic yoke element. For example, a self-inhibiting spindle drive can be used, so that the overall arrangement can be made very securely without any danger that heavy magnetic yoke elements may endanger the patient as a result of an error in the adjustment device.<br>
8<br><br>
In an advantageous further development according to claim 4, the magnetic yoke may be held in a supporting structure into which cooling air can furthermore be cause guided and caused to flow, flowing through the cooling-air gap of the ferrite building blocks to the heat removal.<br>
Depending on conditions and special requirements, the gap in the exposure volume and thereby the volume exposed by a magnetic field can be delimited laterally according to claim 5, by means of field delimitation coils and or by bulkheads.<br>
In principle the magnetic field applicator according to the invention can be used for suitable purposes for a precisely localized and contact-free hyperthermia on all possible tissues, bodies, objects and masses to be exposed to magnetic fields by using introduced magnetic and/or magnetizable substances. However a preferred application of the magnetic field applicator is in the area of medicine according to claim 6, in'particular in the field of cancer therapy, whereby a fluid with magnetizable nano-particles is used preferably as the magnetic substance. It should then b possible to heat a tumor area locally to temperature values above approximately 41 _C .<br>
According to claim 7, alternating magnetic field with magnetic field forces of approximately 10 to 15 ki.A/m and frequencies of approximately 50 to 100 kHz are used. The temperatures required for a tumor therapy are then reached by using the magnetic field applicator claimed above. Merely 1 to 2 kA/m are sufficient for a thermoseed application of the magnetic field applicator. Depending on existing conditions, frequencies in a-wider frequency range from 20 to 500 kHz can also be suitable.<br>
With an arrangement which is in principle possible, with cylinder coils around the pole shoes, inductive heating causes temperature rises to increase in their last winding to the air gap between two magnets, with measures being necessary in heat removal. The disk-shaped coil design with at least one magnetic-coil/pole shoe gap according to claim 8 on the other hand, results in considerably lower flow densities on the surrounding edge of the assigned pole shoes. Undesirable increases in flow density can be reduced.<br>
9<br><br><br>
In a practical embodiment according to claim 9. the magnetic coils are to be provided with one or several windings which extend helicoidally and are made of stranded copper wires in order to keep eddy current losses as low as possible.<br>
In an especially advantageous embodiment according to claim 10. the pole shoes are<br>
cylindrical or, as seen from above, circular, whereby they face each other with opposing<br>
parallel circular pole shoe surfaces across the distance of the gap in the exposure volume.<br>
The magnetic coils are then accordingly made in form of circular rings. This results in<br>
evening out the magnetic flow with a reduction of the heating effect that would otherwise<br>
be increased at corners and edges.	.<br>
Especially favorable conditions with respect to energy and flow occur according to claim 11 if the disk-shaped magnetic coil is located as close as possible to the gap in the exposure volume, in particular in a flat-flush arrangement with respect to the assigned pole shoe surfaces. Further optimization is achieved if at the same time the magnetic coil/pole shoe gap is sized to approximately 110 of the pole shoe diameter (0.07 toO. 1 times) and if t he surrounding edge of the respective pole shoe end surface is rounded off. In this manner damaging flow density increases are much reduced.<br>
According to claim 12 the pole shoe diameter should be greater than the width of the gap in the exposure volume. As a result leakage fields are reduced outside the bole shoe or leakage fields of the volume exposed by a magnetic field are reduced, so that the flow density in the ferrite building blocks and thereby the losses in the ferrite material can be kept relatively low. In case of pole shoes with relatively small diameter, these losses in the ferrite building blocks would increase excessively.<br>
According to claim 13 the magnetic yoke is composed of cut-stone-shaped ferrite building blocks with surfaces ground plane-parallel in order to create uniform transitions, whereby outer sintering layers may be removed in some cases. The round pole shoes are<br>
10<br><br>
accordingly composed of wedge-shaped ferrite building blocks like the wedges of a cake, whereby here too adjoining surfaces are ground to be plane-parallel.<br>
In order to lower eddy current losses, claim 14 proposes to make the cut-stone-shaped ferrite building blocks from ferrite plates placed in a row and to separate them from each other by insulation/cooling gaps. In their assembled state these ferrite plates are oriented in the direction of the magnetic flow. To produce one-piece ferrite building blocks from ferrite plate, these are separated from each other by means of plastic separators according to claim 15. and are bonded to each other via the separators.<br>
According to claim 16 the wedge-shaped ferrite building blocks are produced similarly in order to form the pole shoes, whereby a tubular central opening through which cooling air can be introduced is left open. In order to bond the ferrite plates, a temperature-resistant two-component adhesive is preferably used.<br>
The gaps between the ferrite plates are used for electrical insulation as well as for cooling in that cooling air is blown through the gap. Cooling is necessary because relativeh great eddy currents occur in spit of the low conductivity of ferrite. and the heat thus reduced must be removed. A liquid cooling would be more effective but cannot be used because of the insulation requirements. Oil cooling involves danger because of the combustibility of oil and comparable non-combustible liquids usually contain toxins. In general, the sealing problem with a liquid cooling system could be solved only at high cost, in particular with a movable yoke element and all the other technical difficulties involved.<br>
On the one hand the magnetic flow at transition points is controlled, as indicated e4arlier, in that on the one hand magnetically inactive sintering layers of approximately 0.1 to 0.2 mm produced in manufacture are removed, and in that furthermore magnetically conductive surfaces are ground so as to be plane-parallel. Due to the great permeability of ferrite, the smallest irregularities have an effect, so that a flow control with forced-air gaps according to claim 17 is advantageous. This is especially advantageous with forced-air gaps of 2 to 3 mm at the transition points between the movable transversal yoke<br>
11<br><br>
elements and.adjoining vertical yoke elements and/or at transition points between transversal yoke elements and the pole shoes. In proximity of such relatively wide forced-air gaps a sintering layer may remain, depending on conditions, in order to reduce the manufacturing costs of a ferrite building block.<br>
The invention is explained in further detail through a drawing.<br>

Fig. 8   schematically shows a side view of a magnetic coil flat and flush with a pole shoe surface.<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows a magnetic field applicator 1 for hyperthermia, into which a body to be exposed to a magnetic field and into which a magnetic or magnetizable substance or solids can be introduced can be placed and can be irradiated. A tumor zone in a human body into which a liquid with e.g. magnetic nano-particles are incorporated is<br>
12<br><br>
especially well suited as a body to be exposed o a magnetic field, whereby the tumor zone can be heated to temperature values preferably above approx. 41   C.<br>
The magnetic field applicator 1 comprises a magnetic yoke 2 designed in an M shape in form of a three-legged arrangement and is provided with two parallel vertical yoke elements 3,4 at a distance from each other as well as with two transversal yoke elements 5, 6 connected between them.<br>
A component consisting of the lower transversal yoke element 6 and its associated lower pole shoe 8 with lower magnetic coil is installed fixedly. Relative to it, a portal consisting of the two vertical yoke elements 3, 4, the connected upper transversal yoke element 5 and its associated upper pole shoe 7 with upper magnetic coil 9 can be displaced by means of a self-inhibiting spindle drive 11 shown only schematically here, in order to adjust the width of the gap in the exposure volume of the gap in the exposure volume 12.<br>
It can furthermore be seen in Fig. 1 that the gap in the exposure volume 12 is delimited by bulkheads 14, 15 that delimit a slip-in space 13. The bulkheads 14, 15 can in this instance be adjusted vertically relative to each other.<br>
As can be seen especially also in Fig. 8. the upper magnetic coil 9 and the lower magnetic coil 10 are made in form of disk coils with one or several windings that extend helicoidally and are made of stranded copper wires.<br>
Fig. 8 furthermore-shows that the magnetic coils 9, 10 comprise the pole shoeiends with an intercalated and surrounding magnetic coil/pole shoe gap (a). As can be seen especially in Fig. 4, which shows a top view of one of the pole shoes 7, 8, the pole shoes 7. 8 are designed in a circular form. The magnetic coil/pole shoe gap (a) is of a magnitude range of 0.07 to 0.1 times the pole shoe diameter (d), whereby the magnetic coil has surfaces that are approximately flush with the pole shoe end surface, and the surrounding edge is rounded off at the surface of the pole shoe end.<br>
13<br><br>
Furthermore the size of the gap in the exposure volume 12 is also designed in function of the pole shoe diameter (d) in order to reduce the leakage fields. Thus the pole shoe diameter (d) is greater than the gap in the exposure volume 12 in a preferred embodiment in order to avoid leakage fields.<br>
As can be seen in Figs. 2 and 3. respectively showing a lateral view and a top view of the magnetic yoke 2. the magnetic yoke 2 is composed of cut-stone-shaped ferrite building blocks 16, the surfaces of which are freed of sintering layers and are ground plane-parallel. These cut-stone-shaped ferrite building blocks 16 are in turn placed in a row, as shown in Fig. 6. and are made up of ferrite plates 18 aligned in the magnetic yoke 2 in the sense of direction of flow 17.<br>
These ferrite plates 18 are separated from each other transversally to the direction of flow 17 by insulation/cooling gap 19. In lateral areas plastic separators 20 are inserted in this insulation/cooling gap 19, whereby the ferrite plates 18 are bonded via these plastic separators 20 to the cut-stone-shaped ferrite building blocks 16 as yoke elements. Cooling air can be conveyed through the insulation/cooling gap 19 to cool the magnetic yoke 2 as shown schematically in Fig. 6 by means of arrow 21.<br>
In Figs. 4 and 5 it can be seen that the round pole shoes 7, 8 are composed of ferrite building blocks 22 which are wedge shaped as seen from the top the surfaces of which are also freed of sintering layers and are ground plane-parallel. Separators are also inserted between the wedge-shaped ferrite building blocks 22 to form insulation/cooling gaps 23 shown merely schematically, and adjoining ferrite building blocks are bonded to each other via these separators. The separators are not shown in the schematic representations of Figs. 4 and 5.<br>
It can furthermore be seen in Figs. 4 and 5 that the pole shoes 7, 8 have an axial, tubular opening 24 through which the cooling air can be introduced into the magnetic field applicator 1, as can especially be also seen in Fig. 1.<br>
14<br><br>
Fig. 7 shows    that the cut-stone-shaped ferrite building blocks 16 adjoin each other along the magnetic flow direction 17 over only a very narrow contact gap (S2). As can also be seen in Fig. 7, forced-air gaps (S1) are provided in particular at the transition points between the vertical yoke elements 3, 4 which are adjustable relative to the lower transversal yoke element 6 as well as at the transition points between the transversal yoke elements 5. 6 and the pole shoes 7, 9 for advantageous control of the magnetic flow. These forced-air gaps (S1) has a gap width of e.g. 2 to 3 mm and are very large by comparison to the contact gaps (S2).<br>
The magnetic field is produced by the magnetic coils 9, 10 that are connected to a capacitor, not shown here, into an oscillatory circuit in which the energy then oscillates as an idle power at the resonance frequency of the circuit. The magnetic yy forces are preferably in a range of 1 to 20 kA/m while the frequencies are preferably in a range of 20 to 500 kHz. For a thermoseed application of the magnetic field applicator. 1 to 2 kA/m are sufficient, while higher field forces are necessary with application with magnetic fluids.<br>
