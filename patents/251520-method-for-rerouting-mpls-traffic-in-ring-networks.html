Method for rerouting MPLS traffic in ring networks<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of communications, more<br>
particularly to the field of rerouting/protecting of so-called MPLS (multi-<br>
protocol label switching) traffic in networks comprising rings.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The problem of rerouting/protecting traffic in communication networks<br>
is one of the main topics, which is being permanently discussed and developed<br>
to improve efficacy of networks operation.<br>
Ring networks have largely evolved in local area computer networks<br>
(LANs). Their main benefits are: ability to add/drop local data to/from the ring<br>
at any local station while passively forwarding traffic which doesn't belong to a<br>
particular local station; efficient use of cables, for example in comparison With<br>
mesh networks; fault recovery of traffic, since two-way links between stations<br>
can be used for redirecting the traffic in case of a cable break. SDH/SONET<br>
networks have adopted these advantages to implement multi point-to-point<br>
connections within the ring. Yet, SONET/SDH ring protection is inefficient<br>
compared to packet-based protection and often creates bandwidth bottlenecks<br>
at a metro level.<br>
Protection of traffic in ring networks is ensured by the intrinsic features<br>
of ring networks. According to the most schematic principle concept, a ring-<br>
like network is composed of two "concentric" sub-rings (a 1st ring and a 2nd<br>
ring) formed by network nodes interconnected via communication links and<br>
respectively enabling traffic in the ring-like network to flow in two opposite<br>
directions. In case of failure of a particular link belonging to a 1st ring,<br>
protection of the traffic which was transmitted via the 1st ring is performed by<br>
redirecting it, at two nodes surrounding the faulty link, so as to utilize the 2nd<br>
ring and thus reach the required nodes "from the other side". The 2nd ring3(as<br><br>
well as the 1st ring) usually reserves bandwidth for such cases and provides a<br>
so-called protection path instead of a main path section failed in the 1st ring.<br>
As MPLS technology becomes more and more practically demanded, it<br>
is often deployed over existing ring networks and is therefore to be protected in<br>
such networks. Fast reroute (FRR) has gained substantial traction in the vender<br>
community and interest from service providers. It offers high speed recovery<br>
following network failures, and thereby can shorten disturbance to traffic and<br>
improve the service reliability. Fast reroute in packet-based networks brings<br>
service providers closer to the point where they can provide reliability<br>
comparable to that of TDM services like SDH/SONET or voice.	<br>
The prior art comprises some solutions for protecting MPLS traffic in<br>
various networks, and also in ring networks.<br>
US 20030108029A1 describes a method and a system for providing<br>
failure protection in a ring network that utilizes label switching. A working<br>
label switched path (LSP, also called tunnel) between neighbor label switched<br>
routers (LSRs) in a ring network that utilizes label switching is protected by an<br>
LSP that connects the neighbor LSRs of the working LSP in an opposite<br>
direction to the working LSP. If the working LSP fails, then packets are<br>
switched to the protection LSP. Switched packets traverse the protection LSP<br>
until they reach the neighbor LSR that they would have reached had2he<br>
packets traversed the working LSP. Time-to-live (TTL) values of packets that<br>
traverse the protection LSP are adjusted to account for the number of hops on<br>
the protection LSP so that the TTL values of the packets are the same after<br>
traversing the protection LSP as they would have been had they traversed the<br>
working LSP. After traversing the protection LSP packets can be switched hack<br>
to the working LSP or switched to a next hop LSP. However, in case of a<br>
failure in the ring, the solution makes the traffic to pass so-called excessive<br>
portions over the main and the protection paths (as the ring networks dictate),<br>
to reach the required termination (egress) node. As a result, the solution suffers<br>
from a traffic delay, is critical to multiple faults in the ring and is inefficient<br><br>
from the point of bandwidth reserved for ensuring protection in the excessive<br>
portions of the ring.<br>
US20020093954A1 describes a technique for failure protection in<br>
communication networks. A communications packet network comprises a<br>
plurality of nodes interconnected by communication links and in which tunnels<br>
are defined for the transport of high quality of service MPLS traffic. The<br>
network has a set of primary traffic paths for carrying traffic and a set of pre-<br>
positioned recovery (protection) traffic paths for carrying traffic in the event of<br>
a fault affecting one or more of the primary paths. The network incorporates a<br>
fault recovery mechanism. In the event of a fault, traffic is switched<br>
temporarily to a recovery path. The network then determines a new set of<br>
primary and recovery paths taking account of the fault. The traffic is then<br>
switched to the new primary paths. The new recovery paths provide protection<br>
paths in the event of a further fault. The network nodes at the two ends of a<br>
recovery path exchange information over that path so that packets returning to<br>
the main path present their original labels that are recognizable for further<br>
routing of those packets.<br>
US20020060985A1 discloses a method for high speed rerouting in a<br>
multi protocol label switching (MPLS) network which can minimize a packet<br>
loss and enable a fast rerouting of traffic so as to protect and recover a multi<br>
point to point LSP occupying most LSPs in the MPLS network. The method for<br>
high speed rerouting in a multi protocol label switching (MPLS) network<br>
comprises the steps of controlling a traffic stream to flow in a reverse direction<br>
in a point where a node or link failure occurs by using a backup Label<br>
Switched Path (LSP) comprising an Explicitly Routed (ER) LSP having a<br>
reverse tree of a protected multi point to point LSP and an ingress LSR through<br>
an egress LSR. The method suffers from the drawbacks mentioned before,<br>
since it enforces the backup path to return the traffic into the ingress point of<br>
the ring where the LSP has started.<br><br>
US 2003012129 describes a failure protection system between interconnected<br>
adjacent Resilient Packet Rings (RPRS) in a multiple RPR network. Two paths, a<br>
regular message path and a protection path, are provided between two adjacent<br>
RPRs. The regular path is used for routing inter-ring messages when no failure<br>
has occurred on the path. Messages are rerouted through the protection path<br>
when a failure occurs on the regular path. Each of these paths has two RPR<br>
interface nodes (one for each RPR) that are connected to an interconnection<br>
device (a layer 2 bridge or a layer-3 router) through interconnection links.<br>
Procedures for detecting failures and generating notifications for message<br>
rerouting and fault reports are executed at the interconnection devices. The<br>
procedures are periodic keep alive messages for diagnosing network segment<br>
and interconnection device failures. The fault detection and message rerouting<br>
are accomplished in less than 50 ms.<br><br>
Object of the invention<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for<br>
protecting MPLS traffic in networks comprising ring-like portions and enabling<br>
fast rerouting of the traffic in case of one or more failures in the network.<br>
Further objects and features of the invention will become apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art from the following description and the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The above object can be achieved by providing a method for protecting<br>
packets of MPLS traffic in networks comprising traffic nodes arranged in a<br>
ring-like configuration (a ring), wherein the MPLS traffic comprises one or<br>
more Label Switched Paths (LSPs) entitled to protection, and wherein each of<br>
said packets carries a label corresponding to a particular LSP. The method<br>
comprises providing the following steps in case a section extending between<br>
two nodes (edge nodes) in said ring becomes faulty:<br>
at one edge node bordering the faulty section, redirecting the MPLS traffic in<br>
the opposite direction in the ring, via a protection path,<br>
at each particular node along said protection path, checking each specific<br>
packet belonging to the redirected MPLS traffic to determine whether2 he<br>
particular node is its egress point in the ring;<br>
if in the affirmative, allowing egress of the specific packet of the<br>
redirected MPLS traffic from the protection path at said particular node,<br>
if in the negative, forwarding the specific packet of the redirected MPLS<br>
traffic to a node following said particular node in the ring.	<br>
The nodes of the ring, and in particular -the nodes of the protection path<br>
- should be understood as MPLS-switching-enabled network elements allowing<br>
ingress and/or egress of MPLS traffic into/out of the ring.<br>
The faulty section may consist of one or more faulty nodes and/or links<br>
interconnecting the nodes.	<br><br>
The edge nodes may also be called redirecting nodes.<br>
In the frame of this application, the term MPLS traffic should be<br>
understood as MPLS-like packet traffic where packets are provided with<br>
headers/ labels similar to those utilized in the MPLS technology. The nodes<br>
should be understood as supporting the MPLS technology. Likewise, the<br>
protection path in the ring should be understood as MPLS-based or MPLS-<br>
enabling.<br>
As has been mentioned, the MPLS traffic comprises a number (one or<br>
more) of LSPs (tunnels) carrying data packets. Any of the LSPs (tunnels) has<br>
its own ingress point to the ring and its own egress point from the ring. Bach<br>
MPLS packet belonging to a particular LSP, is associated with a label which<br>
shall be referred to herein as "inner label". The inner label indicates the next<br>
node to which the packet is presently sent along its way to the termination point<br>
of this particular LSP. It should be noted that the termination point is not<br>
necessarily located at the ring, but may be located beyond the ring. The point<br>
(node) in the ring from which an LSP enters the ring is referred to in the<br>
specification as the LSP's ring ingress point or simply ingress point (ingress<br>
node). Likewise, the node at which the LSP leaves the ring is referred to as the<br>
LSP's ring egress point or simply egress point (egress node). The ingress<br>
points and the egress points of different LSPs usually do not coincide. <br>
The protection path is provided in the ring network to protect LSPs<br>
in case section/s of the ring fails. It is usually pre-established for a number of<br>
LSPs in a so-called spare (protection) capacity of the ring.<br>
It should be mentioned that in a ring comprising "n" nodes, the<br>
protection path may be formed, for example, in three different manners. one<br>
manner is to form it as a series of "n" adjacent point-to point LSPs (a ptp<br>
protection path); a second manner - to form the protection path by "n"<br>
multipoint-to point ("mptp") LSPs, each capable of collecting - but not<br>
dropping - traffic from all nodes except the one where it is terminated (an mptp<br>
protection path), and a third manner - to form the protection path by a single<br><br>
"circular" multipoint-to-multipoint ("mptmp") LSP that may drop/add traffic at<br>
each node (an mptmp protection path). Thus, as will be appreciated by those<br>
skilled in the art, the shape and the arrangement of the MPLS-based protection<br>
path may vary from case to case, and these various shapes and arrangements<br>
should be understood to be encompassed by the present invention.	<br>
Capacity of the protection path should be sufficient for carrying at least<br>
a part of the LSPs entitled to protection. The step of rerouting (re-directing) to<br>
the protection path can be arranged according to priorities assigned to different<br>
LSPs.<br>
Owing to the fact that the method allows outputting the rerouted traffic<br>
from the protection path at egress node(s) of corresponding LSPs (contrary to<br>
the conventional concept of traffic protection in ring networks where the<br>
rerouted traffic can only be output from the main path at the egress node, after<br>
completing the whole way along the protection path and coming back to the<br>
main path at the node adjacent to the faulty section), the rerouted traffic will<br>
travel shorter distances in the network.<br>
To this end, the method proposes marking the packets of each of the<br>
LSPs, when being redirected to the protection path at the first edge node, with<br>
an additional label indicating the fact that the packet is carried by the<br>
protection path in said ring. The method then comprises detecting, at each<br>
particular node of the protection path, presence of said additional label in each<br>
specific packet and, if it is present (and thus indicates that the current node may<br>
be an egress point for the packet), further comprises determining whether this<br>
node is the egress point for the LSP to which this specific packet belongs. If the<br>
node is indeed the egress point for this specific packet, the method allways<br>
egress of the specific packet from the ring. If not, the specific packet is<br>
forwarded to the next node along the protection path.<br>
It should be noted that the method, while being started at the first edge<br>
(redirecting) node of the protection path by applying the additional label and<br>
continued at intermediate nodes of the protection path by checking3he<br><br>
additional label, is not obligatory for performing after the second edge node of<br>
the protection path. In other words, the additional label is removed (popped) by<br>
the second edge node, and the following nodes will do the regular label check.<br>
The different rerouted LSPs (if there are some) could tell apart by their<br>
inner labels, while the additional label indicates the fact that they are forwarded<br>
via the protection path. A number of protection paths can be known in the ring<br>
though only two (clockwise and counter clockwise) are mandatory to fully<br>
protect the traffic against a single point of failure within the ring.<br>
The additional label is placed as an outer label in the MPLS packet<br>
label stack.	<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the method provided<br>
can be formulated differently, based on the characteristic feature of checking<br>
the additional label:<br>
A method for fast rerouting packets of MPLS traffic in case of a fault in<br>
networks comprising a ring-like portion (ring), the method comprises providing<br>
the MPLS packets rerouted to a protection path with additional labels to their<br>
respective label stacks, and further comprises detecting said additional labels at<br>
nodes included in the protection path, (with or without checking an inner label,<br>
as will be explained below) to allow determining egress nodes of the rerouted<br>
MPLS packets and thereby outputting said rerouted MPLS packets at their<br>
corresponding egress nodes from the protection path.<br>
As has been mentioned above, the MPLS traffic comprises one or more<br>
LSPs (tunnels) each being characterized by its ingress point (node) and its<br>
egress point (node) in the ring.<br>
It should be noted that each MPLS packet carries an inner label<br>
corresponding to its LSP, and inner labels of the packets can also be checked at<br>
the nodes included in the protection path if required according to the<br>
arrangement of the protection path.<br>
For example, in case the protection path is either of the above-<br>
mentioned ptp protection path or mptmp protection path, the method comprises<br><br>
performing a double lookup of labels - one lookup for the additional label that<br>
indicates that the packet is on a protection path, and the other lookup of the<br>
inner label to check whether the present node is the egress point of the LSP (or<br>
the packet is to be forwarded to the next node in the ring).<br>
If the protection path is arranged as the mptp protection path, the<br>
method comprises checking only the additional label at intermediate nodes of<br>
the protection path to forward the rerouted packets along the ring, while doing<br>
a double lookup (checking both the additional label and the inner label) at the<br>
egress node.<br>
Preferably, only the LSPs having higher priority (for example, those<br>
which are paid according to a higher tariff) are rerouted in case of a failure in<br>
the ring. The lower priority LSPs (tunnels) may be not rerouted at all and<br>
packets belonging to them could be dropped in case of a fault.<br>
Further, the method is also applicable, and provides rerouting of the<br>
MPLS traffic in case the network comprises more than one ring. For example,<br>
the network may comprise a first ring network and a second ring network<br>
interconnected there-between by at least one connecting link. In this case, each<br>
LSP may span more than one ring, and should be entitled to independent<br>
protection at each of the rings it spans.<br>
If a fault occurs in such a second ring, the MPLS traffic is redirected) in<br>
the manner similar to that in the first ring, with marking the traffic by<br>
additional labels characterizing the rerouted MPLS traffic of the second ring.<br>
The above-described method is therefore applicable for a multi-ring<br>
network, and acquires an increased effect of fast rerouting.<br>
In order to achieve fast rerouting (FRR) in a network with multiple<br>
rings, the Inventors further propose providing redundancy to the ring<br>
interconnection, namely providing one or more additional (protection)<br>
connecting links between the rings and using these connecting links as follows.<br>
In addition to the protection path, any LSP entitled to protection in a particular<br>
ring can be assigned a protection (backup) egress node ensuring egress from<br><br>
said particular ring to the protection (additional) connecting link and then to<br>
another ring.<br>
In case of a fault in a first ring (especially when the original egress point<br>
fails or is inaccessible), packets of the LSP that have been redirected to the<br>
protection path leave the first ring through the protection (backup) egress point.<br>
The packets have their additional labels of the first ring popped and are passed<br>
via the additional connecting link with their inner labels. Reaching a first node<br>
at a second ring, the packets are preferably switched to a protection path of the<br>
next ring and acquire additional labels of the second ring, through which they<br>
eventually join the main path of the LSP in this next ring.	<br>
In general, nodes of a ring network adapted for fast rerouting of MPLS<br>
packets should be capable of applying additional labels and of performing<br>
lookup on the additional labels.<br>
For example, nodes along the protection paths being established as<br>
either the above-mentioned ptp protection path or mptmp protection path, must<br>
provide the double lookup of labels - one lookup for the additional label that<br>
indicates that the packet is on a protection path, and the other lookup uses the<br>
inner label to check whether the present node is the egress point of the LSP (or<br>
the packet is to be forwarded to the next node in the ring). If the path is<br>
established as the mptp protection path, the double lookup must be performed<br>
at the egress node in the ring, while intermediate nodes belonging to such a<br>
path only check presence of the additional label and forward the packets<br>
towards the egress point.<br>
Based on the above, and according to a second aspect of the invention,<br>
there is provided a network node belonging to a ring network, the node being<br>
capable of redirecting packets of MPLS-type traffic to a protection path in the<br>
ring in case a fault occurs in an adjacent link, and capable of providing said<br>
packets with an additional label indicating the redirected traffic packets in said<br>
ring, the node also being capable of processing the redirected traffic packets in<br>
the ring network upon detecting said additional label, to ensure outputting said<br><br>
redirected traffic packets from the ring at nodes being suitable egress nodes for<br>
said packets.<br>
More preferably, the node should be capable of analyzing an inner label<br>
of a particular redirected traffic packet to determine its egress point. In case the<br>
egress point of the redirected traffic packet coincides with said node, the node<br>
being capable of outputting said packet from the ring (removing the additional<br>
label and pulling the packet out of the ring), while in case the egress point of<br>
the redirected traffic packet is not the current node, forwarding said packet to a<br>
next node in the ring.<br>
Since the MPLS-type traffic may comprise one or more LSP tunnels,he<br>
node is capable of handling packets of different LSPs. To this end, the node is<br>
preferably operative to provide redirecting of LSPs to the protection path<br>
according to priorities, wherein the priorities can be set by relative importance<br>
and/or cost of different LSPs.<br>
The invention will now be described in more details as the description<br>
proceeds.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic route of redirected MPLS traffic in a ring<br>
network, as known from the prior art and in particular from US 2003/0108029<br>
Al. As can be seen from the drawing, Host X associated with node A (LSR A)<br>
of a ring network 10 was in communication (the dotted line) with Host 5Z<br>
associated with node C (LSR C) of the ring 10 before occurrence of a fault<br>
(such as a fiber cut, marked as a lightning) between the nodes LSR A and LSR<br>
B. The main (working) path of a particular traffic flow (LSP) between the<br>
nodes A -B -C was allocated in the inner ring, a portion of which is shown by<br>
the dotted line and indicates the working LSP. After the fault, the LSP is<br>
redirected at the node A (LSR A) to a protection LSP A-E-D-C-B allocated in<br>
the outer (protection) ring and shown with the solid line. The protection path,<br>
according to the manner accepted for ring networks, is defined as having a<br>
termination point at node B, so the traffic follows till node B without checking<br>
it at intermediate nodes. At the node B (LSR B) the protection LSP terminates,<br>
the traffic is again redirected to the main (working) ring and is transmitted as a<br>
working LSP to the LSR C and then outputted to the Host Z. It can be noticed<br>
that the ring topology and the accepted definition of the protection path results<br>
in the extra distance the redirected traffic runs from the node LSR C to LSR B<br>
and back to LSR C, before it leaves the ring at the egress point LSR C, to2 the<br>
Host Z.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates a ring network 20 similar to the topology 10 in Fig. 1,<br>
but differing in that the nodes of the network are provided with an additional<br>
functionality to perform the method of fast rerouting of MPLS-type traffic,<br>
according to the invention. All the nodes are indicated a,b,c,d,e similar to those<br>
shown in Fig. 1. The node equipment is preferably adapted to redirect MPLS<br>
traffic based on Layer 1 alarms.<br>
Suppose, in network 20 host X is associated with node a, host Z is<br>
associated with node c, and the main path for transmitting MPLS-type traffic is<br>
a-b-c in the clockwise direction, as shown by the dotted line. Now suppose 3hat<br><br>
a similar fault situation occurs in ring network 20, namely the link a-b goes<br>
down. Node a will redirect the traffic to a protection path (indicated by a solid<br>
line), which extends between node a and node b in the counter-clockwise<br>
direction. However, the redirected traffic which is addressed to the host Z will<br>
be able to leave the ring already at the node c, without being passed up to node<br>
b and returned back to node c via the main path.<br>
In more details, the method is explained as follows:<br>
detecting the faulty ring section (which is between a to b in this<br>
example),<br>
at the node bordering the faulty section, applying an additional label to<br>
the MPLS packets, and redirecting them to a protection path flowing in an<br>
opposite direction to that of the original LSP,<br>
at each of the nodes participating in the protection path and traversed by<br>
the redirected traffic, making a decision whether a packet of the redirected<br>
traffic is to be forwarded further, or to be immediately outputted from the ring<br>
at the current node.<br>
The decision is based on presence of the additional label and on the type<br>
of the protection path.<br>
Various arrangements (types) of the protection path will be illustrated<br>
and explained with the aid of Figs 4a, 4b, 4c. However, it should be understood<br>
that for fast rerouting of MPLS traffic in a ring network, the protection path<br>
should preferably be established so as to allow recognizing both the protection<br>
path and the redirected traffic carried along at each node included in the<br>
protection path.<br>
It should be kept in mind that the MPLS traffic may comprise ones or<br>
more LSPs (Label Switched Paths) having different ingress and egress points<br>
and thus having different inner labels. It should also be mentioned that the<br>
protection path or tunnel is pre-selected to serve (ensure protection for) one or<br>
more LSPs entitled to protection. The decision can be made according to<br>
priorities which, for example, are stated in relation to costs of transmitting data<br><br>
via different LSPs. The way of performing the proposed method of fast<br>
rerouting will be further explained and illustrated with the aid of Figs. 3, 4 and<br>
5.<br>
Fig. 3 is a simplified flow chart of the proposed algorithm for fast<br>
rerouting, according to the proposed method.	<br>
Node N checks the outer MPLS label of each data packet passing<br>
through the node in both directions - block 30. If the node detects, at any<br>
packet, presence of an outer (additional) label marking a protection path (block<br>
32), it is to be checked whether the node N is the egress node for the particular<br>
redirected LSP for which this packet belongs (block 34). If the protection path<br>
is arranged according to the multipoint-to-point "mptp" principle (see Fig. 4b),<br>
the protection path has one egress point, thus a node automatically forwards the<br>
re-directed traffic if it is not the egress point (block 38), without checking the<br>
inner label, or outputs the re-directed traffic based on the inner label if it is the<br>
egress point (block 36).	<br>
In other cases (see for example Figs. 4a and 4c for arrangement of the<br>
protection path) node N performs more complex operations in the frame of<br>
block 34, namely double MPLS label lookups at each node along the protection<br>
path. Upon detecting the additional label, a further check up of the label stack<br>
must be performed. The second look-up scans the inner LSP identification label<br>
from the packet (say, LSP 100) and checks whether it is the egress point of the<br>
LSP 100. If yes, (block 36), the packet should be directly outputted from the<br>
node N. If not, the packet will be forwarded to the next node in the ring (block<br>
38).<br>
Fig. 4a schematically shows a protection path in an 8-node ring formed<br>
by 8 point-to-point (ptp) LSPs each of which spans only two nodes. To find the<br>
egress node of a packet traversing in a protection path, a double lookup is<br>
performed at each node in the ring: the first lookup for detecting an additional<br>
label representing the protection path, and the second lookup is done on the<br>
inner label for determining whether the current node is the egress node of the<br><br>
protected LSP. In any arrangement, when this answer is positive, it should also<br>
be known what's the specific interface to which the packet should be sent.<br>
Fig. 4b schematically shows a protection path in an 8-node ring formed<br>
by 8 multipoint to point (mptp) LSPs (only one such LSP is shown). Each of<br>
the LSPs can collect MPLS traffic from 7 nodes (say, in the clockwise<br>
direction) and drop it at the 8 node where it is terminated. To find the egress<br>
node of a packet traversing in a protection path, a double lookup is performed<br>
only at the termination point of the mptp LSP: the first lookup for detecting an<br>
additional label representing the protection path, and the second lookup is done<br>
on the inner label for determining the specific interface to which the packet<br>
should be sent.<br>
Fig. 4c schematically shows a protection path in an 8-node ring formed<br>
by a single multipoint to multipoint (mptmp) LSP that can collect and drop<br>
MPLS traffic from each node. To find the egress node of a packet traversing in<br>
a protection path, a double lookup is performed at each node: the first lookup<br>
for detecting an additional label representing the protection path, and the<br>
second lookup is done on the inner label for determining whether the current<br>
node is the egress node of the protected LSP, and if so - what's the specific<br>
interface to which the packet should be sent.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates how the method can be applied to ring(s) carrying a<br>
number of LSPs, and to a network comprising more than one ring formed by<br>
nodes provided with the proposed inventive functionality.<br>
A network 60 comprises a first ring 62 (having nodes A to H and a<br>
second ring 64 (having nodes I to O), interconnected there-between with two<br>
connecting links D-I and F-O. Each of the rings, as usual, has a clockwise sab-<br>
ring and a counter-clockwise sub-ring; the sub-rings are shown by dotted links<br>
with arrows interconnecting the nodes. Suppose, that two LSPs span the<br>
network 60: LSP 100 and LSP 101. The main (original) tunnels of the two LSPs<br>
are shown by thick solid lines; the LSPs 100 and 101 have different ingress<br>
points in the ring 62, the same egress point in the ring 62, one ingress point) in<br><br>
the ring 64 and different egress points in the ring 64. The main tunnels of LSPs<br>
100 and 101 only partially coincide; they both are arranged in the counter-<br>
clockwise sub-rings in rings 62 and 64.<br>
Suppose, that node F goes down. The LSPs 100 and 101 are to be<br>
rerouted so as to reach the ring 64. Let us assume that a protection path in the<br>
clockwise sub-ring of the ring 62 is pre-assigned. First, the conventional step of<br>
redirecting at the node G is performed, i.e., both of the LSPs are redirected in<br>
the clockwise direction (they are shown with the wavy lines). An additional<br>
label is applied to the redirected traffic at the edge node G. A backup egress<br>
point is predetermined, and has priority over the original egress node F for the<br>
rerouted traffic. In this example, the backup egress point is the node D. The<br>
redirected LSPs will then be outputted from the ring 62 through node D instead<br>
of their original egress node F.<br>
In the connecting link DI, the redirected traffic packets (redirected LSPs<br>
100 and 101) have their additional labels removed. Node I in ring 645 is<br>
configured to redirect packets of LSPs 100 and 101 to the protection path of<br>
ring 64 and provide them with an additional label (preferably, representing the<br>
counter-clockwise protection path of ring 64). These packets will thus travel in<br>
counter-clockwise direction from node I to node O, where they will have their<br>
additional labels removed, and join the main paths of LSPs 100 and 2b01<br>
accordingly.<br>
It should be appreciated that though the invention has been described<br>
with reference to the presented examples, other arrangements can be proposed<br>
in the frame of the inventive concept. The concept will be defined below in the<br>
