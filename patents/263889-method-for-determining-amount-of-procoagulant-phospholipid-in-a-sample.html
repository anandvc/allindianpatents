Method for Detecting Procoagulant Phospholipid<br>
Technical Field<br>
		This invention relates to blood coagulation tests and more particularly relates to an<br>
5	improved method for a marker of thrombosis and platelet activation and a potential<br>
	thrombotic risk factor.<br>
Background Art<br>
		Procoagulant phospholipids, including, for example, anionic phospholipids such as<br>
	phosphatidyl serine, have an important role in the blood coagulation mechamism.<br>
10	Procoagulant phosphotipids are required in the intritisic coagulation pathway for<br>
	conversion of factor X to Xa by factors Villa and IXa and also in the common pathway<br>
	for cleavage of prothrombin to thrombin by factor Xa. They form part of the tissue factor<br>
	activater complex. In antithrombotic mechanisms they are involved in the activation of<br>
	protein C by the thrombin / thrombomodulin complex and in the destruction of factor Va<br>
15	by activated protein C.<br>
		Low levels of procoagulant pnosphsolipids are typically present in the blood of<br>
	healthy individuals, probably as microparticles derived from a variety of cells, principally<br>
	platelets, but these levels increases when plateles become activated, for example, in<br>
	response to injury and activation of the bold clorting, complement or immunologic<br>
	mechanisms. In vito platelets express maximal procoagulant activity after freeze thawing<br>
	or activation by collagen/thrombin or membrane disputing agents such as ionophores<br>
	Abnormal activation of platelets in vino occurs during thrombotic episodes, embolism,<br>
	sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation and infarection. Conversely inadequate<br>
	action of platelets occurs in certain bleeding such as von Willebrands<br>
25	discase and with various platelet abnormalities.<br>
	Procoagulant phospholipids may be traditionally detected in a patient’s<br>
	blood plasma by a coagulation assay, for example, the Russell's Viper Venom Test<br>
	(hereinafter "RVVT"), although such assays are more conventionally used for diagnosing<br>
	lupus anticoagulant. The venom used in the RVVT contains meralloproleases that<br>
30	specifieally activate factors V and X. After the addition of venom and calcium ions,<br>
	coagulation proceeds with a near absolute dependence on procoagulant phospholipid in<br>
	the patient's sample. The amount of procoagulant phospholipid in the patient's sample is<br>
	determined according to the time required for the test mixture to form fibrin and<br><br><br>
	WO2005/29093							PCT/2004/001291<br>
2<br>
	coagulate and thereby cease to flow in a tube or increase in optical turbidity or block a<br>
	hole or aperture. The clotting time or time required for a fibrin clot to form may be<br>
	replaced as an endpoint indicator in this and subsequent descriptions by a chromogenic<br>
	substrate which yields a readily-detectable coloured product when acted on by the main<br>
5	cotting enzyme, thrombin.<br>
		Where a patient is suspecied of having a factor deficiency such as insufficient<br>
	factor X, V, II or fibrinogen, or is recerving anticoagulant, The patient's sample is<br>
	typically mixed with a sample of normal human platelet free plasma for the purpose of<br>
	supplying those factors which are deficient in the sample. This normal human platelet<br>
10	free plasma is typically known as 'substrate plasma'. The substrate plasma used in these<br>
	assays is ideally platelet free otherwise coagulation will not be absolutely dependent on<br>
	procoagutant phospholipid contained in the patient's sample.<br>
		In RWT and other coagulation assays, substrate plasma is usually prepared by high<br>
	speed centrifugation and/or filtration. A principal disadvantage of this procedure is that it<br>
15	is difficult to control the depletion of procoagulant phospholipid from the substrate<br>
	plasma Fresh plasma is essential and this is often inconvement to obtain One plasma<br>
	has been frozen, platelets contained therein are activated and release proeoagulant<br>
	phospholipid. Accordingly, the sensitivity provided by RVVT and other coaguiation<br>
	assays for detection of procoagulant phospholipid in the patient's sample, and the<br>
20	capcity to regulate the specificity of these assays is limited. A further disadvantage is<br>
	that these processes do not remove some cellular microparticles which may have neutral<br>
	buoyancy or may be too small to be filtered out.<br>
	Another disadvantage of current methods for procoacoagulant pirospholipid<br>
	determination is their sensitivity to coagulation inhituitors, such as antibodies. These<br>
25	antibodies occur frequently in autoimmune disease, eg. "antiphospholipid syndrome", and <br>
	cause prolongation of most clotting tests which employ phospholipid-containing reagents<br>
	and thus give false negative results in current tests for procoagulant phospholipids.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
30		In view of the role of procoagulant phospholipids in the pathogenesis of thrombotic<br>
	episodes and their potential as markers of platelet or cellular activation, there is a need for<br>
	an improved method for detecting the presence of and the amount of procoagulant<br>
	phospholipid in a sample.<br><br>
	WO2005/29093							PCT/2004/001291<br>
3<br>
		Therefore, according to a first aspect of this invention there is provided a method of<br>
	determining the amount of procoagulant phospholipid in a sample, the method comprising<br>
	steps (i) to (iii) performed in the following order: (i) forming an admixture of the sample<br>
	and a substrate plasma which has been rendered free or substantially free of procoagulant<br>
5	phospholipid sufficient to at least reduce the capacity of the substrate plasma to coagulate,<br>
	wherein said substrate plasma has been rendered free or substantially free of procoagulant<br>
	phospholipid by treatment with a phospholipase; (ii) contacting the admixture with a<br>
	reagent for activating coagulation of plasma in. conditions where procoagulant<br>
	phospholipid is the rate limiting component of the mixture; and (iii) determining the<br>
10	clotting time of the adrmixhere.<br>
		According to a second aspect of this invention there is provided a method of<br>
	determining the amount of activated platelets and cell derived microparticles in a sample,<br>
	the method comprising steps (i) to (iii) performed in the following order: (i) forming an<br>
	admixture of the sample and a substrate plasma which has been rendered free or<br>
15	substantially free of procoagulant phophohpid sufficiem to at least "reduce the capacity of<br>
	the substrate plasma to coagulate; (ii) contacting the admixture with a reagent for<br>
	activating coagulatation of plasma in conditions for permitting procoagulant phospholapid<br>
	to coagulate the admixture; and (iii) determining the clothing time of the admixture.<br>
		According to a thid aspect of this invention there is provided a method of assessing<br>
20	whether a patient has had a recent thrombetic episode, the method comprising steps (i) to<br>
	(iii) performed in the following order: (i) forming an admixture of the sample and a<br>
	substrate plasma which has been rendered free or substantially free of procoagulant<br>
	phospholipid sufficient to at least reduce the capacity of the substrate plasma to coagulate;<br>
	(ii) contacting the admixture with a reagent for activating coagulation of plasma in<br>
25	conditions for permitting procoagulant phospholipid to coagulate the admixture; and (iii)<br>
	determining the clotting tjme of the admixture.<br>
		A thrombotic episode for example may be deep vein thrombosis, embolism or<br>
	infarction By "recent" is meant within the time limit that procoagulant phospholipid<br>
	derived from the thrombotic event may be detected in the circulation. An estimate would<br>
30	be up to 12 hours ftom such an event if no further platelet activation occurs.<br>
		According to a fourth aspect of this invention there is provided a method of<br>
	producing a substrate plasma for use in determining the level of procoagulant<br>
	phospholipid in a sample, said method comprising treating substrate plasma with a<br>

	WO2005/29093							PCT/2004/001291<br>
4<br>
		According to a fifth aspect of this invention there is provided a substrate plasma<br>
	produced by the method of the fourth aspect. This includes the concept of incubating 3<br>
	test plasma conraining an unknown amount of procoagulant phospholipid alone with<br>
	phospholipase and comparing the result of a phospholipid-sensitive test before and after<br>
5	such an incubation. A significant prolongation of the test confirms that procoagulant<br>
	phospholipid had been present without any need for addition of phosphofipid free<br>
	substrate plasma.<br>
		According to a sixth aspect of this inversion there is provided a kin for determining<br>
	the level of procoagulant phospboiipid in a sample, said kit comprising: (i) a suhstrate<br>
10	plasma which has been treated with a phospholipase for degrading phospholipid sufficient<br>
	in at least reduce the capacity of the substrate plasma to coagulate; (ii) a reagent for<br>
	activating coagulation of plasma in a phospholipid-dependent manner; and (iii) reference<br>
	preparations containing known levels of procoagulant phospholipid.<br>
		The cefereace preparations containing known levels of procoagulant phaspholipid<br>
15	may be used as calibrating agents to construct a reference graph.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
		The invention seeks to address the disadvantages identified above and in one<br>
	embodiment provides a method for determining whether a sample contains detectable<br>
20	procoagulant phospholipzd above the lower sensitivity limit of the method and in a second<br>
	embodiment, how much. The method comprises forming an admixture of the sample and<br>
	a subsuate plasma which has been rendered free or substantially free of procoagulant<br>
	phospholipid sufficient to at least reduce the capacity of the substrate plasma to coagulate<br>
	in a phospholipid-dependent clotting test. The substrate plasma may be rendered free or<br>
25	substantially free of procoagulant phospholipid by treatment with a phospholipase.<br>
		The phospholipid-depeudent clotting test may be one that is initiated by Russells<br>
	viger venom or the factor X activator from that venom of the phospholipids dependent<br>
	prothiombin activator from Pseudonaja Texlilis venom or more preferably factor Xa of<br>
	human, animal or recombinant origin.<br>
30		The plasma may be human plasma or non-human plasma and is preferably non-<br>
	human plasma and more preferably animal plasma.<br>
		The plasma may be rendered free or substantially free of prottagulant phospholipid<br>
	by for example, treating with, an enzyme which degrades phospholipid in the plasma.<br><br>
	WO2005/29093							PCT/2004/001291<br>
5<br>
		For example to prolong the factor Xa activated clotting time of horse plasma from<br>
	50-120 sec requires 1 hour incubstion 37 C with 2 x 10-5 % naja nigricollis venom.<br>
	Datails of various plasma pre-treatment protocols are shown in Example 1 below. The<br>
	admixture is then contacted with a reagent for activating coagulation of plasma in<br>
5	condititions where the concentration of proeoagulanl phospholipid influences the dotting<br>
	time. A determination as to whether the sample comprises procoagulant phospholipid is<br>
	made by determining when coagulation of the admixture has occurred.<br>
		As described herein, the inventor has found that the sensitivity of a clotting test for<br>
	detecting procoagulant phospholipid in a sample, such as preferably with a factor Xa-<br>
10	lased test, is improved by using as a substrate plasma, a composition in which<br>
	procoagulant phospholipid has been degraded by treatment with phospholipase. More<br>
	spseificalty. an admixture comprising a substrate plasma treated with, phospholipase was<br>
	observed to have an increased clotting time, relative to the clotting time of an admixture<br>
	comprising untreated platelet poor plasma or normally-treated centrifuged plasma.<br>
15	(Example 2) As the same antounts of test plasma and therefore, the same amounts of<br>
	added procoagulant phospholipid were provided in all admixtures, it follows that the<br>
	decreased clotting time in the admixture comprising non-treated and centrifuged substrate<br>
	plasmas was caused by detection of procoagulant phospholipid from both the substrate<br>
	plasma and the sample. The admixture comprising the treated substrate plasma, in having<br>
20	an increased clotting time, has improved sensitivity because the only procoagulant<br>
	phospholipid contributed to the admixture and therefore, which is detected in the assay, is<br>
	derived from the sample.<br>
		The results are surprising because many enzymes typically are not capable of<br>
	activity when added to plasma. This is because plasma is a complex mixture of<br>
25	heterogenous molecules which can prevent enzyme activity. For example, plasma<br>
	contains proteins which strongly bind to phospholipids such as apolipolipoteins, annexies<br>
	and beta-2-glycoprotein 1 and these may interfere with the availability of substrate for a<br>
	phospholipase Further, phospholipases usually require calcium for their enzymatic<br>
	activity and this is greatly reduced by the citrate anticoagulant normally used in plasma<br>
30	collected for blood clotting tests. Further, plasma also comprises inhibitor molecules<br>
	capable of inhibiting the activity of specific anzymes. For example, antitypsin which<br>
	binds to and inhibits trypsin, antithrombin which inhibits thrombin and antiplasmins<br>
	which inhibit plasmin activity. Probably the main inhibitor of most phospholipases in<br>
	human plasma is annexin V.<br><br>
	WO2005/29093							PCT/2004/001291<br>
6<br>
		Typically the substrate plasma is one which has been treated with a phospholipase.<br>
	An example of such a phospholipase is a basic phospholipase A2- The phospholipase<br>
	may be produced synthetically, for example by recombimant DNA technology, or may be<br>
	derived from an organism. For example, the phospholipase may be derived from snake<br>
5	venom. As exemplified herein, phospholipases derived from the venom of Naja<br>
	mossambica and N nigricollis are particularly useful for treating the substrate plasma.<br>
	Other types of venom which are useful are derived from Agkistrodon hulys, Vipera<br>
	species, especially Berus and Russelli, Crotalus durissus, Enhydring schistosa,<br>
	Oxyuranus scutellotus and Apis melifera. The main characteristic of venom<br>
10	phospholipases whith makes them effective in plasmas is probably then basic character<br>
	as shown by a high isoelectric pH. Most of the effective venom-derived phospholipases<br>
	share structural homology.<br>
		Other organisms which may provide a phospholipase for use in treating the<br>
	substrate plasma include Streptomyces violaceoruber. Vibrio species, Clostridium<br>
15	perfrfringens. Bacillus cereus.<br>
		It follows that as anionic phospholipids, such as phosphatidyl serine are important<br>
	in thrombosis, typically the enzyme for degrading the procoagulant phospholipid in the<br>
	plasma should be one capable of degrading phosphatidyl serine in plasma. As<br>
20	detection of phosphatidyl serine in a coagulation assay for detection of procoagulant<br>
	phospholipid, such as RVVT or factor Xa-based test.<br>
		It is io be understood that the substrate plasma for use in the method of the<br>
	invention does not need to be treated to degrade all phospholipid in it. However the<br>
	substrate plasma is typically treated so that its capacity to coagulate, when activated by a<br>
25	pocoagulant phospholipid-dependent activator of coagution, for example Russell's<br>
	Viper Venom, is at least reduced by the degradation of procnagnlant phospholipid in the<br>
	substrale plasma by the enzyme. Typically, the capacity of the substrate plasma to<br>
	coagulale when activated by such a reagent is reduced when substantially all of the<br>
	procoagulant phospholipid, mainly phosphatidyl serine component of the phospholipid in<br>
30	the substrate plasma, has been degraded by the enzyme. The treatment of the substrate<br>
	plasma with 1 x 10-5 % of a whole N nigricollis venom (containing substantially less of<br>
	the purified enzyme) for about 1 hour at about 37°C is typically sufficient for degrading<br>
	substantrally all of the procoagulant phospholipid in platelet poor substrate plasma by the<br>
	enzyme. The actual conditions for depleting individual plasmas depends strongly on their<br>
35	initial content of free procoagulant phospholipid and this depends in rum on the degree of<br><br><br>
	WO2005/29093							PCT/2004/001291<br>
7<br>
	eontamination by platelets or other cellular debris (eg see Example 1). Thus plasmas<br>
	containing high levels of platelets require a longer incubation time or a higher<br>
	concentration of phospholipase than those which are already low in phosphulipid. It is<br>
	preferable to begin with, plasmas which are already low in phospholipid. This<br>
5	phospholipase treatment degrades only about 0,001% of the total 0.1% phospholipid in<br>
	most platelet poor plasmas. Typically, the proportion of free phosphatidyl scrine: total<br>
	phospholipid is aboul 1:100,000. A phospholipid-sensitive test such as the factor Xa-<br>
	activated clotting lime (hereinafter "XACT") routinely detects 100-1000ng/mL in patient<br>
	plasmas. It will be understood that a shorter incubation time could be used with a higher<br>
10	consentration of phospholipase and a longer incubation time would be needed with a<br>
	lower conentration of phospholipase, Thus, 400ng/mL of N nigricollis venom (NNV) in<br>
	normal porcine plasma requires 40 minutes at 37 oC to prolong a factor X activated<br>
	clotting time from 48 sec to 100 sec whereas 200 ng/mL NNV requires 90 minutes to<br>
	achieve a similar 100 see optimal XACT result (See example 1 for more details). It will<br>
15	also be understood that the method of the invention will be most sensitive for<br>
	procoagulant phospholipid when all procoaguilarn phaspholipid in the substrate plasma<br>
	has been degraded by treatment with the enzyme.<br>
	Because the activity of venoms useful in this invention is progressive in nature it is<br>
	desirable to stop their interaction with plasma once the phospholipid level has been<br>
20	deplered adequately. This may be done with dituteantisera and antibodies directed against<br>
	the venom being used. Commercially available activenoms against the paiticular class of<br>
	venom, eg cobra, being used are effective at concentrations from 0.01 to 1%.<br>
		The substrate plasma can be any composition which corrects for a factor or factors<br>
	that the patient's sample is deficient in. For example, where the panent's sample is<br>
25	deficient in Factor V, the substrate plasma would contain excess Factor V so as to be<br>
	expable of effecting coagulaion of the parent's sample of plasma. Another example of a<br>
	substrate plasma is one which contains all factors selected from the group consisting of:<br>
	factor XII, prekallikrein, high molecular weight kininogen, factor XI, factor VIII, factor<br>
	IX, faclor X, factor V, prothrombin, and fibrinogen at functional levels sufficient to<br>
30	compensare for any defects in the admixed sample. Such a substrate plasma would be<br>
	used in a keolin or surface-activated clotting time test. "When a test empleying tissue<br>
	factor is used as an activator the substrate plasma must contain factors VII, X, V, II and I<br>
	(fibrinogen) for the same purpose.<br>
		When a test such as the Russell's Viper Venom Test is to be used, this requires only<br>
35	coagulation factors X and below in the coagulation cascade to be present, ie factors X,<br><br><br>
	WO2005/29093							PCT/2004/001291<br>
8<br>
	factor V, factor II and fibrinogen. Factors above factor X need not be present for a normal<br>
	result. If a factor Xa-based test is to be used, even factor X is not necessary in the system<br>
	for a normal result, only factors V, II and I (fibrirtogen) are then required. The<br>
	phosphotipid-dependent prothrombin activators from elapidae venoms require no factors<br>
5	above factor "II (prothronibin) to induce clotting. Thus, if a Taipan venom-based test were<br>
	to be used only prothrombin and fibrinogen need be provided for a normal result.<br>
	fibrinogen or factor I is necessary only to provide a marker for a clotting endpoint. The<br>
	maximum. rate of thrombin generation can be alternatively detected using chromogenic<br>
	tripaptide substrates which are converted by thrombin to colored end-products which can<br>
10	be delected spectrophotomeirically.<br>
		Typically the substrate plasma is derived from citrated blood. Suitable plasmas are<br>
	those which are known to be effective in promoting coagulation of a human plasma<br>
	sample, because they provide a factor variably present in the test sample. Examples of<br>
	such plasmas include most mammalian plasmas. Those which are exemplified herein to<br>
15	be useful in the method of the invention include plasma derived from pig, horse, cow,<br>
	sheep, goat, camel, monkey, dog, cat, fox, elephant, llama, rabbit, mink, racoon,<br>
	kangaroo, human and mixtures thereof.<br>
		The plasma for providing the substrate plasma may be derived from the individual<br>
	who is being tested for presence and/or amount of procoaguiant phospholipid. In this case<br>
20	the plasma specimen, can be lested with a fector Xa activated elotting time before and<br>
	after incubation "With a known amount of phosphohpase (eg 100 ng/mL of N nigricollis<br>
	venom). The difference between the first and second results is proportional to how much<br>
	procoagulant phospholipid was destroyed by the phospholipase treatment.<br>
		However, as antibodies are generated in some humans which have serological<br>
25	activity against human proteinswhich bind to procagulant phospholipids, such as beta 2<br>
	glycoprotein 1 and profrombin, (for example lupus inhibitor antibodies), the use of<br>
	human plasma as a substrate plasma in the method of the invention carries with it some<br>
	unwanted sensitivity to such inhibitors. Consequently such specimens should be assayed<br>
	for the presence of these antibodies. Where animal plasma is used to provide the<br>
30	substrate plasma, an advantage of the invention is that the method, is much, less sensitive<br>
	to antibodies directed against human clotting factors or lupus cofactors than a method<br>
	based on human plasma. Such antibodies can occur unexpectedly among patients causing<br>
	confusion and unreliability from existing clotting test methods<br>
		It will be understood that when a test specimen has altered coagulability,<br>
35	particularly where the individual to be tested has been. adininistered with an anti-<br><br><br>
	WO2005/29093							PCT/2004/001291<br>
9<br>
	coagulant, it may be necessary for the substrate plasma to further comprise at least one<br>
	agent for controlling the capacity of the anti-coagulant to inhibit coagulation. Those<br>
	agents which are most likely to be useful are ones capable of controlling the capacity of<br>
	heparin to inhibit coagulation, because, heparin is widely used as an anti-coagulant. These<br>
5	agents include protamine sulphate and polybrcne or protamine sulphate. However, other<br>
	agents include antibodies against huirudin and its analogues or other anticoagolant<br>
	antagonists.<br>
		The substrate plasma would normally be used in a liquid or reconstituted form.<br>
	However for use in a 'point of care'1 device it could be present as part of a dry<br>
10	composition reconstituted by the applied specimen of blood or plasma itself.<br>
		The reagent for activating' coagulation of the admixture in the test must activate<br>
	coagulation to proceed subsequently in a procoagulant phospholipid-dependent manner.<br>
	Examples of such reagents are those capable of converting factor X to factor Xa, or<br>
	capable of converting prothrombin to thrombin. Accordingly, the reagent for use in the<br>
15	method of the invention, may be RusseII 's Viper Venom or factav X activator from a<br>
	related venom of the viperidae family or factor Xa or other phospholipid-dependent<br>
	prothrombin activator derived from elapid venoms such as the Australian cobra<br>
	Pseudonaja or Oxyuranus scutellatus femily. Reagents derived from mammals other than<br>
	human are particularly useful, for example factor Xa of bovine origin (see "Example 4).<br>
20	Reagents acting higher up the coaguiation mechanism such as contact activators tissue<br>
	factor, factor IXa, factor XIa and factor VIIa can be used, but these make the system less<br>
	specific for phospholipid and more vulnerable to interference by parient plasma variables.<br>
		Clotting activators may also be enaymes from recombinant precursors based on<br>
	novel DNA sequences. Such procoagulants could be rendered insensitive to inhibiling<br>
25	anitibodies by deletion of common, epitopes recognised by such antibodies. These reagents<br>
	would normally be used in liquid form but could also be provided in a dried form for<br>
	application in a "point of care" device. in which case they would be reconstituted by an<br>
	a plied specimen of plasma or blood specimen.<br>
		While it is anticipated that the method of the invention would be most widely<br>
30	applied in relation to a plasma or blood sample derived from a human patient, it is to be<br>
	undersiood that the method can be used to detect procoagulant phospholipid in a range of<br>
	animals. This embodiment would be useful in animal experimental studies for in vivo or<br>
	in vitro assessment of the biocompalability of materials' surfaces with animal blood and<br>
	the effect of experimental drugs. The sample to be tested for procoagulant phospholipids<br>
35	can be blood plasma, scrum or any other fluid. If anticogulated by calcium-binding<br><br><br>
	WO2005/29093							PCT/2004/001291<br>
10<br>
	agents such as citrate or EDTA, the levels of such agents should be similar to those used<br>
	in other clotting tests.<br>
		In the first aspect of the invention mentioned above, there is provided a method of<br>
	determining the amount of procoagulant phospholipid in a sample.<br>
5		The measurement is made in comparison with reference plasmas containing known<br>
	amounts of procoagulast phospholipid and unknown, values may be interpolated from an<br>
	appropriately constnicted calibration curve.<br>
		As procoagulant phospliolipids are typically locafed on activated platelets and<br>
	piatelet mieroparticles, it follows that measuring the amount of procoagulant phospholipid<br>
10	in platelet rich plasma according to the first aspect of the invention would enable one to<br>
	quantitate the amount of activated platelets and platelet microparticles in the sample.<br>
		Thus in the second aspect mentioned above, the invention provides a method of<br>
	delernming the amount of activaled piateiets and cell-derived microparticles in a sample,<br>
	the method according to the first aspect of the invention.<br>
15		As noted above, abnormal platelet or cellular activation may result from thrombotic<br>
	episodes, erabolism, tissue trauma, immune processes (including complament activation),<br>
	sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation or infarction. In extreme cases, or when<br>
	due to immunologic processes il can result in thrombocytopenia. It would be<br>
	advantageous to be able to determine whether an individual has a clinical condition<br>
20	involving platelet activation, for example, thrombosis, stroke or myocardial infarction.<br>
	The inventor recognises that a method for determining the amount of activated ptatelets or<br>
	platelel microparticles, by determining the amount of procoagulant phospholipid would<br>
	a low diagnosis of those individuals with those conditions.<br>
		Thus in the third aspect mentioned above, the invention provides a method of<br>
25	asessing whether a patient has recently had a thrombotic episode such as a deep vein<br>
	thrombosis, embolism, infarction, the method according to the second aspect of the<br>
	invention.<br>
		In the fourth aspect mentioned above, the invention provides a method for<br>
	producing a substrate plasma for use in determining whether an individual romprises<br>
30	procoagulant phospholipid. The method comprises treating substrate plasma with an<br>
	enzyme for degrading procoagulant phospholipid sufficient to at least reduce the capacity<br>
	of the substrate plasma to coagulate.<br>
		Using an enzyme in the method of the fourth aspect of the invention, one is abe to<br>
	provide a panel of substrate plasmas comprising defined amounts of procoagulant<br>
35	phospholipid, This allows one to control the sensitivity of the methods of the first and<br><br><br>
	WO2005/29093							PCT/2004/001291<br>
11<br>
	second aspect of the invention, by selecting for use from the panel, a substrate plasma<br>
	comprising the desired amount of procoagulant phospholipid. This option provides a<br>
	easonable or optimised baseline clotting time for a particular instrument. Snake venoms<br>
	are particularly useful to provide an enzyme for use in the fourth aspect of the invention<br>
5	because they can be used at very low cancentrations and their activity can be controlled<br>
	subsequently for example, by the use of antisera and antibodies effective against<br>
	phospholipases. However, it will be understood that agents capable of controlling<br>
	phospholipase enzymes derived from recombinant DNA technology, or from other<br>
	orgamsms or inhibitory compounds could be used. Thus, a further step of the method of<br>
10	the fourth aspect of the invention comprises contacting the substrate plasma with at least<br>
	one agent for controlling the capacity of the enzyme to degrade pracoagulant<br>
	phaspholipid.<br>
		Also, in another embodiment, the method of the fourth aspect comprises the further<br>
	step of mixing the substrate plasma with at least one agent such as Polybrene or<br>
15	protamine sulphate for controlling the capacity of a therapeutic anticoagulant such as<br>
	heparin to inhibit coagulation.<br>
		In the fifth aspect mentioned above, the invention provides a substrate plasma<br>
	peduced by the method of the fourth aspect.<br>
		In the sixth aspect mentioned above, the invention provides a kit for determining<br>
20	whether an individual comprises procoagulant phospholipid, the kit comprising: (i) a<br>
	substrate plasma which has been treated with an enzyme for degrading phospholipid<br>
	sufficient to at least reduce the capacity of the substrate plasma to coagulate; and (ii) a<br>
	reagent for activating coagulation of plasma in a phesphalipid-dependent manner (iii)<br>

Best Modes and other modes tor carrying out the invention<br>
		The present invention will now be described with reference to the following<br>
	examples which should not be construed as limiting on the scope thereof<br>
5					Example 1<br>
Progressive effect of N nigricollis venom an crude animal plasmas<br>
	Aim:	To demonstrate the progressive and selective effect of a typical venom<br>
	phospholipase in reducing the procoagulant phospholipid from platelet-containing<br>
	plasmas from various species, thereby improving the sensitivity of those substrate<br>
10	plasmas in clotting tests for procoagulant phospholipid.<br>
	Method: Blood samles were collected into one lenth its final volume of 3.2% trisodisrn<br>
	citrate anticoagulant by clean venipuncture from a human volunteer, by cardiac puncture<br>
	from a freshly shot horse (equine), by an arterial bleed from a pig at an abattoir and<br>
	similarly from an ox (bovine). The samples were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 20 minutes<br>
15	and the supernatant platele: poor plasmas with quite variable platelet counts<br>
	(approximately 5 x 109 /L for the human sample, but not measned for the animal<br>
	plasmas) were frozen at -30°C.<br>
		Subsequently thawed platelet poor samples were incubated at 37oC without<br>
	treaunent or after mixing with N nigricollis venom (NNV) at the concentrations shown in<br>
20	Fig 1 Spcimeas were removed at 1 or 2 houe intervals and tested with a factor<br>
	Xa/calclum reagent for the XACT test.<br>
	Resuits: These are shown in Fig 1 XACT results on all plasmas without NNV additions<br>
	were reasonably stable. With NNV present however XACT results prolonged over the<br>
	incbation period.<br>
25	Bevine and porcine plasmas gave the shortest initial results, probably due to excess free<br>
	prrocoagulant phoapholipid, but these both doubled after incubation for 2 hours with 4 x<br>
	10-5% and 8 x 10-5 % NNV. The XACT on horse plasma prolonged from 50 to 120 sec<br>
	affer 1 hour with 2 x 10-5 % NNV.<br>
30	Comments: These inereases in XACT results due to incubation with NNV were not<br>
	accompanied by significant changes in activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT),<br>
	prothrombin time (PT) or other clotting tests. This confirms that the major effect of the<br><br><br>
	WO2005/29093							PCT/2004/001291<br>
13<br>
	NNV was not due to degradation of coagualion factors involved in these clotting rests,<br>
	but rather to loss of phospholipid for which these tests are not sensitive.<br>
Example 2<br>
5			Preireatment of human plasma with N nlgricoliis venom.<br>
	Aim: To show that treatment of a normal human plasma with a trace of N nigricollis<br>
	venom gives a product (subsraye plasma) with better sensitivity to platelets in a Factor<br>
	Xa-based dotting test than centrifugation.<br>
	Method: Test plasmas containing varying levels of freeze-thawed normal platelet rich<br>
10	plasms (PRP initially with 250 x 109 platelets/L) in platelet "free" normal human plasma<br>
	were prepared. The platelet tree plasma (PFP) was obtained by high speed centrifugarion<br>
	and futration through a 0.22 micron syringe filter.<br>
		These rest plasmas were mixed with an equal volume of 3 different substrate<br>
	plasmas before being tested in a factor Xa-based clotting test. The 3 different substrate<br>
15	plasmas were:<br>
		1. Normal platelet "poor" human plasma (PPP).<br>
		2. The same PPP centrifuged at 15,000g for 10 min.<br>
		3. The same PPP treated with 1 x 10-5 % N nigricollis venom for 20 minutes at 37<br>
	oC (hereinafter the "NNV treatment").<br>
20	The factor Xa reagent contained 0.001 U/mL bovine Factor Xa in 0.015 M calcium<br>
	chioride, 0.1M sodium chloride, 0.02M HEPES pH 7.0 bufffer and was used in a<br>
	poportion of 0.05mL plasma mix with 0.1 mL of reagent in a ST4 (Diagnostica Stago,<br>
	Paris, France) elotting machine at 37oC.<br>
	Results: Table 1 shows Factor Xa clotting time results in seconds on 1:1 mixes of test<br>
25	plasmas containing various plateler counts and substrate pooled normal plasma (PNP)<br>
	prerteated by the two different methods.<br><br><br>
	WO2005/29093							PCT/2004/001291<br>
14<br><br>
	(Comment: These experiments show that NNV treatment achieved a gteater increase in<br>
	clotting time results over those obtained with high speed centrifugation. This resulted in<br>
	an improvement in sensitivity to platelets.<br>
5<br>
Example 3<br>
Effect of a fire-treatment with N nlgricollis venom on platelet sensitivity.<br>
	Aim: To demonstrate the effect of N nigricollis venom in enhancing the sensitivity of a<br>
	Russelis viper venom clotting test system based on bovine plasma.<br>
10	Method: A series of dilutions of a frozen-thawed, though otberwise normal human<br>
	platelel rich plasma (with initial platelet count of 250 x 109/L) were made in normal<br>
	bovine plasma and also in bovine plasma pretreated for 50 min at 20oC with 5 K l0-19 N<br>
	nigricollis venom. These plasma samples were mixed with an equal volume of various<br>
	Russellis viper venom and calcium-containing reagents and timed to a clotting eudpoint at<br>
15	37oC in throsmbin time mode (TT mode uses equal volumes of plasma and reagent) in a<br>
	ACL300 clot-timing instrument (Instrimenianon Laboratory SpAf Milan, Italy). The<br>
	Russellis vipsr venom concentration in the reagent with 0.025M calcium chloride was<br>
	varied from 10-5% to 10-6 % and the former reagent was also tested after the addition of 2<br>
	X 10-4% N nigricollis venom.<br>
20	Results: The results oblained are summarised in Fig 2. It is apparent that the sensitivity of<br>
	a test system using 1 x 10-5 % RVV to platelets was quite low, plateauing out at platelet<br>
	levels below 1 x 109/L. RVV clotting times were prolonged by reducing the RVV<br>
	concentration tenfold to 10-6 %, but sensitivity to platelets as shown by the gradient of the<br>
	responsiveoess curve was not improved. Including 20 x 10-5 % NNV in the RVV reagent<br>
25	(RVV= 10-5 %) increased the sensitivity slightly.<br>
		The highest sensitivity to platelets was observed when the bovine plasma had been<br>
	preincubsted with 5 x 10-5 % NNV before being used to dilute out the platelet<br>
	concentrate. In this case platelet counts between 0.1 and 1.0 could still be quantitated<br>
	accurately.<br><br>

Example 4<br>
Comparison of various clotting activators<br>
	Aim: To compare the sensitivities of 4 different phospholipid-depettdent clotting<br>
	ctivatorsin a test system for assaying procoagulant pbospholipid.<br>
5	Method: Dilutions of a platelet rich plasma were prepared in platelet free normal human<br>
	plasma as shown below. These samples were tested with 4 different clotting test systems.<br>
	All tesis we tarried out at 37oC in a ST4. The reagents and methods were as follows.<br>
		1. Kaolin clotting tests (KCT) were canied out using 0.05 mL plasma samples<br>
	preincubated with 0.05 mL of 1% kaolin suspension in water for 3 min and then<br>
10	recalcified with 0.05 mL of 0.025 M calcium chloride. The time from addition of calcium<br>
	chloride till dotting occurred was detemnined in a ST4 (Stago) clotting machine.<br>
		2. Russell's Viper Venom Tests (R.VV) were carried out by mixing 0.05 mL<br>
	samples with 0.05 mL of a reagent containing 2 x 10-6 % RVV in 0.025M calcium<br>
	chloride and timing till a dotting Midpoint.<br>
15		3. Factor Xa-based cloning tests (FXa-CT) were camed out by mixing 0.05 mL<br>
	samples with 0.05 mL of a reagent containing 0.001 U/mL bovine factor Xa in 0.025 M<br>
	calclum chloride and timing to a clotting endpoint<br>
		4. Textarin (TM-Pontapharm, Basel, Switzerland) dotting tests (TX-CT) were<br>
	carried out by mixing 0.05 mL samples with 0.05 mL of a reagent containing 2 U/mL of<br>
20	delipidated commercial Textarin reagent in 0.025 M calcium chloride and timing to a<br>
	clotting endpoint.<br>
	Results: Results obtained are shown in Fig 3. The RVVT and KCT tests showed similar<br>
	sensitivities to platelets. The clotting test based on activated factor X (XACT) showed the<br>
	fighest sensitivity to platelets. The test with the lowest sensitivity to platelets was that<br>
25	based on delipidated Textarin, However it is possible that this may have been due to<br>
	insdequate remeval of phospholipid from this commerocial reagent intended for an<br>
	altemative purpose, ie. detection of lupus inhibitors.<br>
	Comments: The Textarin reagent is a typical phospholipid-dependent prothrombin<br>
	activator as derived from the venom of Pseudonoja textilis. One of several Australian<br>
30	elapids known to contain such procoagulants.<br><br>
	WO2005/29093							PCT/2004/001291<br>
16<br>
Example 5<br>
Typical use of the method and specificity study<br>
	Aim: To illustrate that the method is insensitive to defects in all known clotting factors.<br>
	Also to detect free procoagulant phospholipid in various commercially-available plasma<br>
5	deficfent in indiridual clotting factors.<br>
	Method: Various freeze-dried individual clotting factor deficient plasmas marketed for<br>
	use in specifie factor assays were tested using the new test for procoagulant phospholipid.<br>
	Thus the vials from various suppliers (Dada/Behring, IL/Beckman-Coulter and<br>
	Disgnostica Stage) were each freshly reconstituted with 1 mL of water The tests used 25<br>
10	y1 of NNV-treated substrate plasma. (lot 3004) with 25 y1of each fector dericient plasma<br>
	and 50 y1 offector Xa reagent in a Sago ST4 dotting machine.<br>
	Results: These are shown in Table 2.<br><br>
15	Comment: The pooled frozen platetct-poor plasma gave a relatively short FXa clotuing<br>
	time compared with the platelet free normal plasma because it contained approximately<br>
	5 % of a normal platelet count (approximately 10 x 109 platelets/L).<br>
		These results show that the total deficieucy of any individual plasma clotting factor<br>
	in a test sample does not prolong the FXa test. It also shows that the factor VIII, IX and X<br>
10	defient plasma used here contain opprecible amounts of procoagulant phospholipid<br>
	deteble with this test.<br><br>
