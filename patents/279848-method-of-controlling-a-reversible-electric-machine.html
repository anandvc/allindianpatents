				<td>METHOD OF CONTROLLING A REVERSIBLE ELECTRICAL MACHINE<br>
Object of the invention<br>
The present invention concerns a method of preparing a reversible electrical<br>
machine with a phase for starting a thermal engine of a vehicle.<br>
The invention finds a particularly advantageous application in the field of the<br>
automobile industry, and more especially in that of vehicles equipped with an<br>
automatic starting/stopping system, such as the system known by the English<br>
term "Stop and Go".<br>
Prior art<br>
Vehicles able to function according to the "Stop and Go" mode are equipped<br>
with a reversible electrical machine, or alternator/starter, coupled to the<br>
thermal engine, by means of a belt for example. In general terms, a reversible<br>
electrical machine of a vehicle combines two distinct functions, namely on the<br>
one hand the conventional function of alternator when the shaft of the thermal<br>
engine drives the rotor of the machine so as to produce an electric current at<br>
the stator, and on the other hand the starter function when conversely a<br>
current applied to the stator of the machine causes the rotor to rotate, which<br>
then drives the shaft of the thermal engine in a similar manner to a<br>
conventional starter.<br>
The application of an alternator/starter to the "Stop and Go" operating mode<br>
consists, under certain conditions, of causing the complete stoppage of the<br>
thermal engine when the vehicle is itself at rest, and then restarting the<br>
thermal engine following, for example, an action by the driver interpreted as a<br>
restart request. A typical situation of "Stop and Go" is that of stopping at a red<br>
light. When the vehicle stops at the light, the thermal engine is automatically<br>
stopped and then, when the light goes green, the engine is restarted in<br>
particular by means of the alternator/starter following the detection by the<br>
vehicle starting control system of the pressing of clutch pedal by the driver or<br>
any other action that may be interpreted as the intention of the driver to restart<br>
his vehicle. The advantage of "Stop and Go" mode in terms of energy saving<br>
and pollution reduction, especially in an urban environment, will be<br>
understood.<br>
When it is wished to start a thermal engine initially at rest by means of an<br>
alternator/starter, the first phase to be implemented is magnetising the rotor<br>
by sending it a maximum excitation current. This magnetisation, necessary<br>
for obtaining the required torque for starting the thermal engine, must last for a<br>
certain amount of time, around 150 ms, before the inverter is started up in<br>
order to make the rotor turn by applying an electric current to the stator of the<br>
machine.<br>
This rotor preparation phase is executed on a start instruction sent by a<br>
control module responsible for managing the "Stop and Go" system, the<br>
starting being made effective by the excitation of the stator only after expiry of<br>
the magnetisation period of approximately 150 ms.<br>
This magnetisation period therefore causes a routine delay in the starting of<br>
the thermal engine, prejudicial to the enjoyment and efficacy of driving when<br>
the automatic starting/stopping system of the vehicle is activated.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
It is precisely an object of the present invention to define the ways in which an<br>
instruction to start the thermal engine of the vehicle could be executed in the<br>
context of a "Stop and Go" system without suffering the negative effect of the<br>
delay necessary for preparing the alternator/starter to execute a start<br>
instruction by magnetisation of the rotor.<br>
This object is achieved, in accordance with the present invention, by the<br>
implementation of a method of preparing a reversible electrical machine with a<br>
phase for starting a thermal engine of a vehicle equipped with an automatic<br>
starting/stopping system, the said reversible electrical machine comprising a<br>
rotor coupled to the said thermal engine, characterised in that the said method<br>
comprises steps consisting of detecting an action prior to an instruction to<br>
start the thermal engine, and applying an electrical magnetisation current to<br>
the said machine as soon as the said prior action is detected.<br>
Thus, by applying the magnetisation electric current at the very moment when<br>
a prior action is detected, and therefore before an actual start instruction has<br>
been given, the method according to the invention makes it possible to<br>
magnetise the rotor by anticipation. The result is a reduction in the interval of<br>
time elapsing between the start instruction and a moment when the thermal<br>
engine actually starts, because at least part of the rotor magnetisation phase<br>
is masked in the time separating the action prior to starting and the sending of<br>
the start instruction.<br>
Naturally it may happen that the anticipated preparation of the rotor has been<br>
carried out without being followed by an actual start instruction. In this case,<br>
the invention provides for the application of the magnetisation electric current<br>
to be interrupted if a start instruction is not triggered after a given time after<br>
detection of the said prior action. This time may for example be three<br>
seconds.<br>
In addition, the invention proposes that, after an interruption in the application<br>
of the magnetisation electric current, a new attempt at preparing the reversible<br>
electrical machine is made only after cancellation of the said prior action. It is<br>
thus ensured that the method according to the invention is indeed reset before<br>
a new starting attempt.<br>
So as to avoid any overheating of the alternator/starter, the invention<br>
recommends that a new attempt at preparing the reversible electrical machine<br>
is prevented after a given maximum number of interrupted attempts. This<br>
maximum number of attempts may be equal to five.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, the said prior action is<br>
a pressing of a control pedal for driving the thermal engine.<br>
More precisely, the said pedal is a clutch pedal and/or an accelerator pedal.<br>
These actions performed on the clutch or accelerator pedals constitute socalled<br>
conditions prior to a restarting of the thermal engine by the "Stop and<br>
Go" system. The particular choice of these actions of pressing the clutch or<br>
accelerator pedals is in no way limiting, the invention being able to apply in<br>
the same way to other actions relating to other prior conditions.<br>
In this particular context of the invention, the said pressing is detected by at<br>
least one sensor for the pressing of the said pedal, the detection of a first<br>
pressing level triggering the application of the said magnetisation electric<br>
current to the rotor of the reversible electrical machine, and the detection of a<br>
second pressing level triggering the said start instruction.<br>
Likewise, the said prior action cancellation consists of a zero pressing of the<br>
said pedal. In other words, the driver must completely release the pedal<br>
concerned in order to enable a new preparation phase.<br>
Two practical embodiments can be envisaged.<br>
According to a first embodiment, the said first and second pressing levels are<br>
detected by two successive binary sensors.<br>
According to a second embodiment, the said first and second pressing levels<br>
are detected by a continuous sensor.<br>
This second embodiment has the advantage that the said continuous sensor<br>
is also able to supply a pressing speed.<br>
It is then possible to take this speed parameter into account in order to refine<br>
the determination of the first pressing level and to decide for example that,<br>
according to the invention, the value of the first pressing level increases when<br>
the said pressing speed decreases up to a given minimum value.<br>
It is also possible to provide, according to the invention, at pressing speeds<br>
lower than the said minimum value, for no magnetisation electric current to be<br>
applied to the rotor of the reversible electrical machine.<br>
The description that follows with regard to the accompanying drawings, given<br>
by way of non-limiting examples, will give a clear understanding of what the<br>
invention consists and how it can be implemented.<br>
Brief description of the figures<br>
Figure 1 is a diagram of an automatic starting/stopping system for a thermal<br>
engine of a vehicle.<br>
Figure 2 is a timing diagram illustrating an example of magnetisation of the<br>
rotor of the alternator/starter shown in figure 1.<br>
Detailed description of preferential embodiments of the invention<br>
Figure 1 depicts a system for the automatic starting/stopping of a thermal<br>
engine of a vehicle, in particular the "Stop and Go" system mentioned above.<br>
In the remainder of the description, reference will be made to a vehicle<br>
equipped with a reversible electrical machine, such as an alternator/starter,<br>
controlled according to the methods of the "Stop and Go" system. Naturally<br>
any other electrical machine, reversible or not, could be used in the context of<br>
the invention.<br>
The system in figure 1 comprises:<br>
- a separate alternator/starter 1 comprising a shaft terminating in a pulley 2<br>
that is connected to a pulley 3 of the crankshaft of the thermal engine by<br>
means of a belt 4. This alternator/starter is mounted in the place that the<br>
alternator normally takes;<br>
- optionally, an additional conventional starter 5 whose pinion is able to mesh<br>
with the teeth on a ring 6 for driving the shaft of the thermal engine;<br>
- control electronics 7.<br>
The control electronics 7 comprise:<br>
- a transistor bridge 8 that constitutes a reversible power converter and that<br>
provides control in starter mode and synchronous rectification in alternator<br>
mode;<br>
- a control module 9 that controls the various transistors of the converter 8 and<br>
in particular manages the following various functions:<br>
- power in starter and alternator modes<br>
- regulation in alternator mode<br>
- transition from starter to alternator mode<br>
- operating strategy.<br>
The control module 9 is for this purpose supplied with the voltage of the<br>
battery, referenced B, to which it is connected by means of an ignition switch<br>
10 of the vehicle.<br>
It receives as an input information enabling it to determine the angular position<br>
of the rotor of the alternator/starter 1, for example information supplied by<br>
sensors 11, such as Hall effect sensors.<br>
As an output, it supplies the field winding of the alternator/starter 1 and the<br>
starter 5 and generates the voltages injected on the gates (A, B, C; A', B', C')<br>
of the transistors of the bridge 8.<br>
Moreover, the control module 9 receives information coming from<br>
measurement and detection sensors distributed in the vehicle, such as<br>
sensors for detecting the position of various components, such as clutch<br>
pedal, accelerator pedal, etc, this information constituting in particular<br>
conditions prior to the sending of a start instruction.<br>
In an automatic starting/stopping system, such as the "Stop and Go" system,<br>
an instruction to start the thermal engine of the vehicle can be given following<br>
a prior action, for example by pressing the clutch pedal or accelerator pedal.<br>
In order to obtain actual starting of the engine as quickly as possible after<br>
detection of a prior action, the invention proposes to magnetise the rotor of the<br>
alternator/starter by early application of an electric current as soon as the said<br>
prior action is detected, that is to say by anticipation, without awaiting the<br>
sending of the start instruction.<br>
This method of preparing the rotor can be implemented by:<br>
- at least two two-state sensors, namely a pedal start-of-travel sensor (which<br>
is for example at 0 if the pedal is released and at 1 if it is pressed by more<br>
than 10%) and an end-of-travel sensor (which is for example at 0 if the pedal<br>
is pressed by less than 90% and at 1 if it is pressed by more than 90%),<br>
- or a continuous sensor on the pedal that supplies a continuous value<br>
between 0 if the pedal is released and 100% if the pedal is completely<br>
pressed. •<br>
In the case of two two-state sensors, the start-of-travel sensor detects a first<br>
pedal pressing level (more than 10% for example) and the end-of-travel<br>
sensor detects a second pressing level (more than 90% for example).<br>
The magnetisation of the rotor is initiated if the stop travel sensor is activated<br>
whilst the actual starting instruction is sent only if the end-of-travel sensor is<br>
activated in its turn.<br>
In all cases the application interrupts the magnetisation of the rotor by cutting<br>
off the magnetisation electric current if an actual start instruction is not sent<br>
after a given time, 3 seconds for example. A new magnetisation is possible<br>
only when the driver has cancelled the prior action, that is to say here by<br>
releasing the pedal.<br>
A maximum of five interrupted attempts at magnetisation not followed by an<br>
actual start instruction are enabled, in order to avoid risks of overheating of<br>
the alternator/starter.<br>
The timing diagram in figure 2 gives an example of magnetisation of the rotor<br>
with two two-state sensors.<br>
On this timing diagram, it can be seen that a first magnetisation has been<br>
interrupted because the pedals have been released before having reached<br>
the second pressing level. The second magnetisation has been followed by<br>
an actual starting of the engine, the end of travel sensor having been<br>
activated.<br>
In the case of a continuous sensor, two parameters can be taken into account:<br>
firstly the pressing level of the pedal and secondly the speed of pressing, that<br>
is to say the speed at which the driver presses the pedal. This speed can be<br>
evaluated directly from a percentage pressing per unit of time.<br>
If the driver presses the pedal by more than 1% in less than 1 millisecond, the<br>
application considers that the pressing speed is very rapid and that the driver<br>
will very probably start. The application then begins to magnetise the rotor<br>
when a pressing percentage of 30% is reached, the actual starting instruction<br>
being initiated at 90% pressing.<br>
If the driver presses the pedal by 1% in a time of between 1 and 3<br>
milliseconds, the application considers that the pressing speed is rapid and<br>
that the driver will probably start. The application then begins to magnetise<br>
the rotor when a pressing percentage of 60% is reached, the actual starting<br>
instruction still being initiated at 90% pressing.<br>
It is of course possible to imagine a pressing percentage for starting the<br>
magnetisation of the rotor that increases, proportionally for example, when the<br>
pressing speed decreases.<br>
Below a certain pedal pressing speed (less than 1% in 1 ms for example), the<br>
application considers that the driver does not wish to start and the rotor is not<br>
magnetised. The start instruction will nevertheless be given if the pedal is<br>
pressed by more than 90% without however benefiting from the advantage of<br>
anticipated magnetisation.<br>
There too, the application stops the magnetisation of the rotor if an actual<br>
starting instruction has not occurred after three seconds. A new<br>
magnetisation is possible only when the driver has released the pedal. To<br>
avoid risks of overheating, a maximum of five successive magnetisations<br>
without actual start instruction are enabled.<br>
