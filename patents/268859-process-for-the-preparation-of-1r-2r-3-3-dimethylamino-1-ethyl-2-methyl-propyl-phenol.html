				<td>Process for the preparation of (1R,2R)-3-(3-dimethylamino-1-ethyl-2-methyl-<br>
propyl)-phenol<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of (1 R,2R)-3-(3-<br>
dimethylamino-1-ethyl-2-methyl-propyl)-phenol.<br>
A class of active ingredients having excellent analgesic effectiveness and very good<br>
tolerability are the substituted dimethyl-(3-aryl-butyl)-amine compounds, which are<br>
known inter alia from EP 0 693 475. In particular, (1R, 2R)-3-(3-dimethylamino-1-<br>
ethyl-2-methyl-propyl)-phenol has proven to be a very promising candidate for the<br>
development of an analgesic in clinical trials.<br>
An object of the present invention was, therefore, to provide a process which allows<br>
for the preparation of (1R, 2R)-3-(3-dimethylamino-1-ethyl-2-methyl-propyl)-phenol<br>
via a short route with good overall yield under environmentally acceptable conditions.<br>
In particular, in the process of the present invention all stereocenters can be<br>
established via substrate control with almost exclusive formation of only a single<br>
diastereomer thus sparing elaborate purification steps to separate stereoisomers and<br>
costly chiral reagents, catalysts or ligands. As there are not any undesired side<br>
products formed in the process of the present invention, each batch can work at its<br>
optimal capacity.<br>
The object of the present invention is met by providing a process for preparing<br>
(1R,2R)-3-(3-dimethylamino-1-ethyl-2-methyl-propyl)-phenol, or an acid addition salt<br>

Yet more preferably R in general formula (I) represents methyl. Thus, very preferably<br>

The term catalyst within the context of the present invention includes both<br>

They are suitable for the dehydration in particular those ion-exchange resins that<br>
carry sulfonic acid groups are used.<br>
Preference is given to ion-exchange resins based on tetrafluoroethylene/<br>
perfluorovinyl ether copolymers, optionally in the form of their silica nanocomposites,<br>
as are described, for example, in the literature publications of Olah et al. Synthesis,<br>
1996, 513-531 and Harmer et al. Green Chemistry, 2000, 7-14, the corresponding<br>

from 1 to 300 bar. It is particularly preferred to carry out the reactions under pressure<br>
in a range from 2 to 10 bar, in particular from 4 to 10 bar.<br>
The reaction time can vary in dependence on various parameters, such as, for<br>
example, temperature, pressure, nature of the compound to be reacted or the<br>
properties of the catalyst, and can be determined for the process in question by the<br>
person skilled in the art using preliminary tests.<br><br>
The continuous removal of samples in order to monitor the reaction, for example by<br>
means of gas chromatography methods, is also possible, optionally in combination<br>
with regulation of the corresponding process parameters.<br>
The total amount of the catalyst(s) used depends on various factors, such as, for<br>
example, the ratio of the catalytically active component to any inert material present,<br>
or the nature of the surface of the catalyst(s). The optimal amount of catalyst(s) for a<br>
particular reaction can be determined by the person skilled in the art using<br>
preliminary tests.<br>
