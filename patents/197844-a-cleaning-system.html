THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 (39 of 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br><br><br><br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The  following  specification   particularly  describes  the   nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br>
Technical field:<br>
The present invention relates to detergent compositions in the form of bars/shaped tablets, compacts, liquid, pastes or powders or granules for superior cleaning of hard surface or fabric.<br>
Background and Prior art :<br>
Cleaning of soil from fabric or hard surfaces is achieved either manually or by the use of machines. Commercial hard surface cleaning compositions typically comprise, one or more surfactants and a plurality of abrasives dispersed therein. Combinations of these together with electrolytes are generally used to form a structuring system as is well known in the art.<br>
Hard surfaces within household are kitchenware, kitchen floors and platforms, floors, bathrooms etc. and one encounters different types of soil on these surfaces. The soil generally encountered on kitchenware is of two types i.e. the mobile or greasy soU and the tough or difficult to remove soil consisting of dried-on or cooked-on food. The problem becomes more pronounced when the soil builds on over a period of time and this requires considerable effort to clean.<br>
The conventional cleaning compositions for hard surface cleaning are formulated in the form of solids such as powders, granules, pastes and bars, and in the form of non-solid compositions such as liquids and gels.<br>
Cleaning compositions in the solid form are  much  cheaper than liquids<br>
because of low cost packaging and these are very popular forms for developing<br>
countries. Amongst the solid form bars are gaining popularity and growing<br>
rapidly in the market of developing countries because of better value delivery.<br>
The product dosage in the solid form is easier, it avoids spillage and the<br>
product application can be better controlled. Cleaning compositions in the bar<br>
form are economically superior to other product forms and the dosage per<br>
swipe from the bar is highly controlled. The bars/tablets also do not get easily<br>
sogged in the presence of water and the active ingredients are not lost. The<br><br><br>
 bars/tablets require low packaging material and because of the ease of application it is highly preferred over the other forms of the same composition and it is especially important for low cost markets of the developing and emerging countries.<br>
Solvents are well known components of detergent compositions to improve the cleaning performance of the composition significantly with respect the mobile or greasy soil and the tough or difflcult to remove soil consisting of dried-on or cooked-on food. Typical solvents used in cleaning compositions include, alcohols (such as ethanol), ethers (such as Butyl Cellosolve [TM]], paraffins (such as Isopar L [TM], esters and terpenes (such as d-limonene). Another known class of solvents are the alkanolamtnes. EP503219A (P&amp;G) relates to a cleaning composition containing 0.1-10% of an alkanolamine.<br>
Our copending applications 535/Bom/98 and 536/Bom/98 also disclose abrasive cleaning compositions comprising C2-C6 alkanolamine to obtain superior cleaning of both oily soil and stuck on tough sofi.<br>
Fabric washing compositions contain, as an essential ingredient, a surfactant system whose role is to assist in removal of sofi from the fabric and its suspension in the wash fiquor. Solvents have also been used in compositions for fabric washing in order to enhance detergency, lather and to give a softening effect to the fabric. It is also common to employ alkanolamines in fabric washing compositions.<br>
Incorporation of amines in general and particularly the commonly used alkanolamine in detergent compositions poses a problem as alkanolamine is corrosive, has the potential to generate nitrosamlnes and also has the typical amine odour which is difficult to mask. Use of alkanolamines in bar compositions also poses a problem in extrusion of the dough and in pastes it poses a stability problem as the product tends to phase separate. These compositions containing the amines are also difficult to package in simple<br><br>
packaging materials as they dtSiise through resulting in staining, de-inking and de-lamination and stress fracture of the packaging material.<br>
Attempts to solve the problem of amine mal odour that interferes with the perfume have been reported. One such approach has been to use excess perfume to over power the odour or use perfume with specific components that neutralise the amine. WO0055288 (P&amp;G), discloses detergent compositions, particularly for manual dishwashing which, by incorporating a combination of anionic surfactants, solvents and certain selected perfume compositions that do not have the maladors associated with certain nitrogenous ingredients such as amines. It is proposed that reacting part of the amine with aldehyde component of the perfume result in the formation of the Schlffs base that is odourless.<br>
JP51130411 discloses a dewaxing/degreasing agent for removing oil and fat comprising a water soluble solvent, a surfactant and an alkanolamlne salt. This composition does not teach the release of free alkanolamlne and hence is limited to cleaning of specific soils such as grease/mobile soil.<br>
US4175051 and US4140647 (Kao) disclose detergent composition comprising an organic phosphoric acid ester of alkanolamlne and a surface active agent, with excellent detergency and ability to remove viscous or solid soils and stains formed by polymerisation of oils or fat. These do not alleviate the problems encountered during processing or packaging of sofid detergent compositions or teach the need for alkaline trigger to release the amine.<br>
It has now been found that these problems can be solved by using one or more amines in its salt form and segregated fi'om an alkaline trigger, however, ensuring that the amine salt and the alkali come in contact with each other during use to release the free amine. This helps providing superior cleaning and superior sensory attributes such as perfume impact and low ammonlcal odour.<br><br>

It is particularly preferred that the amine is an alkanolamine and it is a salt of orthophosphoric acid. For solid compositions it is preferred that the alkanolamine salt of phosphoric acid is in the form of an adjunct with silica, a particulate material having a high water absorptive capacity.<br>
Detailed description:<br>
The Invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to compositions for cleaning kitchen ware and kitchen surfaces but is not restricted to cleaning of these and can be applied to other hard surfaces or fabric. The invention essentially relates to a cleaning composition comprising of optionally a detergent active, a salt of an amine as such or as an adjunct with a particulate having a high water absorptive capacity such as silica and an inorgjanic alkaline material.

The product may be formulated as a powder, granule, bar, tablet, liquid, paste mousse, aerosol, gel or a compact. It is preferred that there is no free amine in the composition until the product is in use and to achieve this in the solid forms of the product the water in the composition is maintained below 15%.<br><br>
In non-solid form of the product the salt of the amine is physically separated from the alkaline agent.<br>
Solid compositions can be prepared by conventional manufacturing processes such as spray dr5nng, mixing, extrusion and compaction or other known processes. It is particularly preferred that the adjunct of silica and salt of alkanolamine is added at the end of the process.<br>
When the composition is in the non-solid form the components (ii) £ind (ili) are separated from each other by providing the components in containers having separate compartments for the same, such that the said components come into contact only during the use of the composition. The compositions of the two compartments can be prepared by conventional means through mixing of ingredients at required concentrations to be able to deliver the amounts as indicated.<br>
The present invention can also be provided as a cleansing kit comprising<br>

The invention wiU now be illustrated with respect to the following non-limiting examples.<br>
Examples:<br>
Composition of solid detergents according to the invention and comparative examples:<br>
Detergent bars were processed as a batch of 20 kg by conventional bar<br>
processing technology and the composition details are presented in Table 1.<br>
3.5 kg of sodium carbonate and was mixed with 3.3 kg of linear aU^l benzene<br>
sulphonic acid in a sigma mixer. This was followed by additions 3.6 kg of<br>
dolomite and other minor ingredients and mixed and followed by extrusion,<br>
billeting and stamping (Example 1). Other ingredients were added after the<br>
addition of dolomite and minor ingredients. 0.76 kg monoethanolamine (MEA)<br>
in Example 2 and 1.4 kg of phosphoric acid Scilt of monoethanolamine (MEA<br>
phosphate) in Example 4 and 5 were added such that the level of MEA in the<br>
composition is maintained same. In Example 4 the Inorganic alkaline material<br>
was withheld. A mixture of MEA and silica was added in Example 3, and a<br>
mixture of MEA phosphate and silica in Example 6 whereas an adjunct of<br>
phosphoric   acid   salt  of monoethanolamine  with   precipitated   silica  was<br>
13<br><br>
prepared separately by mixing 1.4 Kg of MEA phosphate and 0.4 Kg of the silica and 1.8 kg of the adjunct was added in Example 7. The different ingredients were added and mixed well before the steps of extrusion, billeting and stamping. The composition details and the properties of the bar are presented in Table 1.<br>
Composition of liquid detergents according to the invention and compairative<br>
examples:<br>
The composition comprises of two units with<br>
a.	Component 1: Comprising the MEA salt of phosphoric acid with or without<br>
the de;tergent<br>
b.	Component 2: Comprising the alkaline trigger.<br>
a.	Composition of Component 1:<br>
300g of water was taken in the main mixing vessel followed by the addition of 50g of hydrotropes and viscosity modifiers, 5g of colour, perfume and preservatives were added and mixed well in Example 8. In Examples 9 and 10 llOg of MEA phosphate was added prior to the addition of colour, perfume and preservatives. In Examples 11 and 12, 300g of water was taken in the main mixing vessel followed by the addition 31 g of sodium hydroxide (48% solution) and mixed for 2 minutes. 135 g of linear alkyl benzene sulphonlc (LAS) acid was added to this and mixed for 10 minutes. The temperature of the mix was brought down to 40oC. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 6-7 using either NaOH or the LAS acid. This was followed by mixing 220 g of MEA phosphate in case of Example 11 and 120g of MEA in case of Example 12. The minor components (such as electrofyte, viscosity modifier, hydrotrope, perfume, colour etc) were then added and mixed for 10 minutes. The final weight is made upto IKg with water.<br>
b.	Composition of Component 2:<br>
A solution of sodium carbonate having a pH of 11.2 was prepared by dissolving<br>
150g of sodium carbonate in 750 g of water. 50g of other Ingredients such as<br>
buffers and viscosity modifiers were added in the case of Examples 8, 10, 11<br><br><br>
and 12. In Example 9 the weight of sodium carbonate was replaced with water. The final weight is made upto IKg with water,<br>
The two solutions, components 1 and 2 were placed in a container with two compartments that are physically segregated. The product compositions presented in Table 2 were analysed for different sensory and cleaning performance.<br>
The compositions were analysed by different trained panellists for different sensory properties by the foffowing procedure.<br>
Ammonical Odour and perfume impact:<br>
The ammonical odour of the composition was rated on a 0-5 scale by an expert<br>
panel of perfumers where 0 refers to none and 5 to very strong odour.<br>
Nitrosamine:<br>
The apparent total nitrosamine content (ATNC) was estimated by chemical de-<br>
nitrosation of any N-nitroso moiety present by refluxing the sample in a<br>
mixture of hydrobromic acid &amp; acetic acid. The liberated nitric oxide is reacted<br>
with ozone, and the chemffuminescence is measured and the detection limit is<br>
20ppb.<br><br><br>

The data presented in Table 2 show that the liquids prepared with phosphoric acid salt of monoethanolamine did not exhibit the ammonlcal odour or generate nltrosamines as did the liquids with free monoethanolamine.<br>
The Tough soil cleaning efficlencv<br>
The oil that has been polymerised by heating at high temperature is known as tough soil. Vegetable oU is smeared uniformly on a stainless steel plate and heated to get a polymerised oU film on the plate.<br>
The product described in Table 1 was uniformly rubbed on the soUed plate and then   rinsed   with   water.   The   performance   was   assessed   to   determine<br><br>
percentage  cleaning visually  by  trained  personnel.   The   experiment  was conducted with replicates and analysed statistically and presented in Table 3.<br>
Table 3<br><br>
Data presented in Table 3 show that the performance of the bar composition is not sacrificed when the alkanolamine is used In its salt form in combination with an inorganic alkaline material and it is released during in use through alkaline hydrolysis as the % tough soU cleaning values match those obtained when the free alkanolamine is used. However, in the absence of the Inorganic alkaline material the salt of alkanolamine will not have any effect in tough soil cleaning.<br>
The components 1 and 2 of the respective examples described in Table 2 was taken in equal quantities and was uniformly spread on the soiled plate and then rinsed with water. The performance was assessed to determine percentage cleaning visually by trained personnel. The experiment was conducted with replicates and analysed statistically and presented in Table 4.<br>
Table 4<br><br>
Data presented in Table 4 show that in a liquid composition where there is a com^bination of MEA phosphate and an alkaline inorganic salt either in presence or absence of the detergent active the cleaning performance is<br><br>
^    significantly superior to the other controls. The amine odour generated by MEA (Example 12) is also prevented.<br>
Comparative Example 13-14. Example 15 Calcimn Hydroxide as inorganic alkaline material<br>
The solid detergent compositions of Examples 13-15 were made as explained for Examples 1-12. In Example 15, calcium hydroxide is used as an alkaline trigger. A small amount of sodium carbonate is incorporated in Example 15 to the extent required only as a builder. Ammoniacal odour and perfume impact was determined as explained earlier. The compositions of Examples 13-15 and their properties are shown in Table 5.<br>

COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br><br><br><br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The  following  specification   particularly  describes  the   nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br>
Technical field:<br>
The present invention relates to detergent compositions in the form of bars/shaped tablets, compacts, liquid, pastes or powders or granules for superior cleaning of hard surface or fabric.<br>
Background and Prior art :<br>
Cleaning of soil from fabric or hard surfaces is achieved either manually or by the use of machines. Commercial hard surface cleaning compositions typically comprise, one or more surfactants and a plurality of abrasives dispersed therein. Combinations of these together with electrolytes are generally used to form a structuring system as is well known in the art.<br>
Hard surfaces within household are kitchenware, kitchen floors and platforms, floors, bathrooms etc. and one encounters different types of soil on these surfaces. The soil generally encountered on kitchenware is of two types i.e. the mobile or greasy soU and the tough or difficult to remove soil consisting of dried-on or cooked-on food. The problem becomes more pronounced when the soil builds on over a period of time and this requires considerable effort to clean.<br>
The conventional cleaning compositions for hard surface cleaning are formulated in the form of solids such as powders, granules, pastes and bars, and in the form of non-solid compositions such as liquids and gels.<br>
Cleaning compositions in the solid form are  much  cheaper than liquids<br>
because of low cost packaging and these are very popular forms for developing<br>
countries. Amongst the solid form bars are gaining popularity and growing<br>
rapidly in the market of developing countries because of better value delivery.<br>
The product dosage in the solid form is easier, it avoids spillage and the<br>
product application can be better controlled. Cleaning compositions in the bar<br>
form are economically superior to other product forms and the dosage per<br>
swipe from the bar is highly controlled. The bars/tablets also do not get easily<br>
sogged in the presence of water and the active ingredients are not lost. The<br><br><br>
 bars/tablets require low packaging material and because of the ease of application it is highly preferred over the other forms of the same composition and it is especially important for low cost markets of the developing and emerging countries.<br>
Solvents are well known components of detergent compositions to improve the cleaning performance of the composition significantly with respect the mobile or greasy soil and the tough or difflcult to remove soil consisting of dried-on or cooked-on food. Typical solvents used in cleaning compositions include, alcohols (such as ethanol), ethers (such as Butyl Cellosolve [TM]], paraffins (such as Isopar L [TM], esters and terpenes (such as d-limonene). Another known class of solvents are the alkanolamtnes. EP503219A (P&amp;G) relates to a cleaning composition containing 0.1-10% of an alkanolamine.<br>
Our copending applications 535/Bom/98 and 536/Bom/98 also disclose abrasive cleaning compositions comprising C2-C6 alkanolamine to obtain superior cleaning of both oily soil and stuck on tough sofi.<br>
Fabric washing compositions contain, as an essential ingredient, a surfactant system whose role is to assist in removal of sofi from the fabric and its suspension in the wash fiquor. Solvents have also been used in compositions for fabric washing in order to enhance detergency, lather and to give a softening effect to the fabric. It is also common to employ alkanolamines in fabric washing compositions.<br>
Incorporation of amines in general and particularly the commonly used alkanolamine in detergent compositions poses a problem as alkanolamine is corrosive, has the potential to generate nitrosamlnes and also has the typical amine odour which is difficult to mask. Use of alkanolamines in bar compositions also poses a problem in extrusion of the dough and in pastes it poses a stability problem as the product tends to phase separate. These compositions containing the amines are also difficult to package in simple<br><br>
packaging materials as they dtSiise through resulting in staining, de-inking and de-lamination and stress fracture of the packaging material.<br>
Attempts to solve the problem of amine mal odour that interferes with the perfume have been reported. One such approach has been to use excess perfume to over power the odour or use perfume with specific components that neutralise the amine. WO0055288 (P&amp;G), discloses detergent compositions, particularly for manual dishwashing which, by incorporating a combination of anionic surfactants, solvents and certain selected perfume compositions that do not have the maladors associated with certain nitrogenous ingredients such as amines. It is proposed that reacting part of the amine with aldehyde component of the perfume result in the formation of the Schlffs base that is odourless.<br>
JP51130411 discloses a dewaxing/degreasing agent for removing oil and fat comprising a water soluble solvent, a surfactant and an alkanolamlne salt. This composition does not teach the release of free alkanolamlne and hence is limited to cleaning of specific soils such as grease/mobile soil.<br>
US4175051 and US4140647 (Kao) disclose detergent composition comprising an organic phosphoric acid ester of alkanolamlne and a surface active agent, with excellent detergency and ability to remove viscous or solid soils and stains formed by polymerisation of oils or fat. These do not alleviate the problems encountered during processing or packaging of sofid detergent compositions or teach the need for alkaline trigger to release the amine.<br>
It has now been found that these problems can be solved by using one or more amines in its salt form and segregated fi'om an alkaline trigger, however, ensuring that the amine salt and the alkali come in contact with each other during use to release the free amine. This helps providing superior cleaning and superior sensory attributes such as perfume impact and low ammonlcal odour.<br><br>

Detailed description:<br>
The Invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to compositions for cleaning kitchen ware and kitchen surfaces but is not restricted to cleaning of these and can be applied to other hard surfaces or fabric. The invention essentially relates to a cleaning composition comprising of optionally a detergent active, a salt of an amine as such or as an adjunct with a particulate having a high water absorptive capacity such as silica and an inorgjanic alkaline material.

The invention wiU now be illustrated with respect to the following non-limiting examples.<br>
Examples:<br>
Composition of solid detergents according to the invention and comparative examples:<br>
Detergent bars were processed as a batch of 20 kg by conventional bar<br>
processing technology and the composition details are presented in Table 1.<br>
3.5 kg of sodium carbonate and was mixed with 3.3 kg of linear aU^l benzene<br>
sulphonic acid in a sigma mixer. This was followed by additions 3.6 kg of<br>
dolomite and other minor ingredients and mixed and followed by extrusion,<br>
billeting and stamping (Example 1). Other ingredients were added after the<br>
addition of dolomite and minor ingredients. 0.76 kg monoethanolamine (MEA)<br>
in Example 2 and 1.4 kg of phosphoric acid Scilt of monoethanolamine (MEA<br>
phosphate) in Example 4 and 5 were added such that the level of MEA in the<br>
composition is maintained same. In Example 4 the Inorganic alkaline material<br>
was withheld. A mixture of MEA and silica was added in Example 3, and a<br>
mixture of MEA phosphate and silica in Example 6 whereas an adjunct of<br>
phosphoric   acid   salt  of monoethanolamine  with   precipitated   silica  was<br>
13<br><br>
prepared separately by mixing 1.4 Kg of MEA phosphate and 0.4 Kg of the silica and 1.8 kg of the adjunct was added in Example 7. The different ingredients were added and mixed well before the steps of extrusion, billeting and stamping. The composition details and the properties of the bar are presented in Table 1.<br>
Composition of liquid detergents according to the invention and compairative<br>
examples:<br>
The composition comprises of two units with<br>
a.	Component 1: Comprising the MEA salt of phosphoric acid with or without<br>
the de;tergent<br>
b.	Component 2: Comprising the alkaline trigger.<br>
a.	Composition of Component 1:<br>
300g of water was taken in the main mixing vessel followed by the addition of 50g of hydrotropes and viscosity modifiers, 5g of colour, perfume and preservatives were added and mixed well in Example 8. In Examples 9 and 10 llOg of MEA phosphate was added prior to the addition of colour, perfume and preservatives. In Examples 11 and 12, 300g of water was taken in the main mixing vessel followed by the addition 31 g of sodium hydroxide (48% solution) and mixed for 2 minutes. 135 g of linear alkyl benzene sulphonlc (LAS) acid was added to this and mixed for 10 minutes. The temperature of the mix was brought down to 40oC. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 6-7 using either NaOH or the LAS acid. This was followed by mixing 220 g of MEA phosphate in case of Example 11 and 120g of MEA in case of Example 12. The minor components (such as electrofyte, viscosity modifier, hydrotrope, perfume, colour etc) were then added and mixed for 10 minutes. The final weight is made upto IKg with water.<br>
b.	Composition of Component 2:<br>
A solution of sodium carbonate having a pH of 11.2 was prepared by dissolving<br>
150g of sodium carbonate in 750 g of water. 50g of other Ingredients such as<br>
buffers and viscosity modifiers were added in the case of Examples 8, 10, 11<br><br><br>
and 12. In Example 9 the weight of sodium carbonate was replaced with water. The final weight is made upto IKg with water,<br>
The two solutions, components 1 and 2 were placed in a container with two compartments that are physically segregated. The product compositions presented in Table 2 were analysed for different sensory and cleaning performance.<br>
The compositions were analysed by different trained panellists for different sensory properties by the foffowing procedure.<br>
Ammonical Odour and perfume impact:<br>
The ammonical odour of the composition was rated on a 0-5 scale by an expert<br>
panel of perfumers where 0 refers to none and 5 to very strong odour.<br>
Nitrosamine:<br>
The apparent total nitrosamine content (ATNC) was estimated by chemical de-<br>
nitrosation of any N-nitroso moiety present by refluxing the sample in a<br>
mixture of hydrobromic acid &amp; acetic acid. The liberated nitric oxide is reacted<br>
with ozone, and the chemffuminescence is measured and the detection limit is<br>
20ppb.<br><br><br>
Table 1: Analysis of solid compositions.<br>
The data presented In Table 1 show that the bars prepared with phosphoric acid salt of monoethanolamine did not exhibit the pronounced anmionical odour or staining, delnking or delamination of the packaging material as did the bars with free monoethanolamine in presence of the alkaUne tagredient or not. Also, the perfume is able to cover the trace ammonical note generated in the case of bars with phosphoric acid salt of monoethanolamine and the alkaline Ingredient whUe its impact is lost when free alkanolamine is used.<br><br>
Table 2: Analysis of liquid compositions.<br><br>
The data presented in Table 2 show that the liquids prepared with phosphoric acid salt of monoethanolamine did not exhibit the ammonlcal odour or generate nltrosamines as did the liquids with free monoethanolamine.<br>
The Tough soil cleaning efficlencv<br>
The oil that has been polymerised by heating at high temperature is known as tough soil. Vegetable oU is smeared uniformly on a stainless steel plate and heated to get a polymerised oU film on the plate.<br>
The product described in Table 1 was uniformly rubbed on the soUed plate and then   rinsed   with   water.   The   performance   was   assessed   to   determine<br><br>
percentage  cleaning visually  by  trained  personnel.   The   experiment  was conducted with replicates and analysed statistically and presented in Table 3.<br>
Table 3<br><br>
Data presented in Table 3 show that the performance of the bar composition is not sacrificed when the alkanolamine is used In its salt form in combination with an inorganic alkaline material and it is released during in use through alkaline hydrolysis as the % tough soU cleaning values match those obtained when the free alkanolamine is used. However, in the absence of the Inorganic alkaline material the salt of alkanolamine will not have any effect in tough soil cleaning.<br>
The components 1 and 2 of the respective examples described in Table 2 was taken in equal quantities and was uniformly spread on the soiled plate and then rinsed with water. The performance was assessed to determine percentage cleaning visually by trained personnel. The experiment was conducted with replicates and analysed statistically and presented in Table 4.<br>
Table 4<br><br>
Data presented in Table 4 show that in a liquid composition where there is a com^bination of MEA phosphate and an alkaline inorganic salt either in presence or absence of the detergent active the cleaning performance is<br><br>
^    significantly superior to the other controls. The amine odour generated by MEA (Example 12) is also prevented.<br>
Comparative Example 13-14. Example 15 Calcimn Hydroxide as inorganic alkaline material<br>
The solid detergent compositions of Examples 13-15 were made as explained for Examples 1-12. In Example 15, calcium hydroxide is used as an alkaline trigger. A small amount of sodium carbonate is incorporated in Example 15 to the extent required only as a builder. Ammoniacal odour and perfume impact was determined as explained earlier. The compositions of Examples 13-15 and their properties are shown in Table 5.<br>
Table 5<br><br><br>
The data presented in Table 5 show that the bars prepared with phosphoric acid salt of monoethanolamine and Inorganic alkaline ingredient (Example 14 &amp; 15) did not exhibit the pronounced ammonical odour or staining, deinking or delamination of the packaging material. Also, the perfume is able to cover the trace ammonical note generated in the case of bars with phosphoric acid salt of monoethanolamine and the alkaline ingredient. The control bar (Example 13) that did not contain the salt and did not have any problems with either ammonical odour, perfume impact or packaging.<br>
The Tough soil cleaning efficiency<br>
The oil that has been polymerised by heating at high temperature is known as tough soil. Vegetable oil is smeared uniformly on a stainless steel plate and heated to get a pol5mierised oU film on the plate.<br>
The product was uniformly rubbed on the soiled plate and then rinsed with water. The performance was assessed to determine percentage cleaning visually by trained personnel. The experiment was conducted with replicates and analysed statistically and presented in Table 6.<br>
