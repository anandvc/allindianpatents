Substituted benzimidazoles and their preparation and use<br>
The present invention relates to novel benzimidazoles, their preparation and their use as inhibitors of the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase or PARP (EC 2.4.2.30) for the preparation of drugs.<br>
Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) or, as it is also known, poly(ADP-ribose)synthase (PARS) is a regulatory enzyme which is found in cell nuclei (K. Ikai et al., J. Histochem.  Cytochem.  ii. (1983), 1261-1264). It is assumed that PARP plays a role in repairing DNA breaks (M.S. Satoh et al.. Nature 356  (1992), 356-358). Damage to or breaks in the DNA strands activate the enzyme PARP which, if it has been activated, catalyses the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD (S. Shaw, Adv.  Radiat.Biol.  li (1984), 1-69). Nicotinamide is liberated from NAD. Nicotinamide is converted back into NAD with consumption of the energy carrier ATP by other enzymes. Overactivation of PARP would accordingly result in an unphysiologically high consumption of ATP, and this leads to cell damage and cell death in extreme cases.<br>
It is known that radicals such as the superoxide anion, NO and hydrogen peroxide can lead to DNA damage in cells and hence activate PARP. The formation of large amounts of radicals is observed in a number of pathophysiological conditions, and it is assumed that this accumulation of radicals leads or contributes to the observed cell or organ damage. These include, for example, ischemic conditions of organs, as in stroke, myocardial infarct (C. Thiemermann et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.   Sci.   USA 9Â±  (1997), 679-683) or ischemia of the kidneys, as well as reperfusion damage as occurs, for example, following the lysis of myocardial infarct (see above: C. Thiemermann et al.). The inhibition of the enzyme PARP might accordingly be a means for preventing or reducing this damage at least in part. PARP inhibitors might therefore constitute a new therapeutic principle for treating a number of disorders.<br>
The enzyme PARP influences the repair of DNA dcimage and could thus also play a role in therapy of cancer diseases, since the higher action potential against tumor tissue was observed in combination with cytostatic substances (G. Chen et al. Cancer Chemo.   Phairmacol.   22_  (1988), 303).<br><br>
Nonlimiting examples of tumors are leukemia, glioblastomas, lymphomas, melanomas, carcinoinas of the breast and cervical carcinomas.<br>
It was also found that PARP inhibitors can have an immunosuppressive effect (D, Weltin et al. Int. J. Iimunopharmacol. IZ  (1995), 265-271).<br>
It was also discovered that PARP is involved in immunological diseases or disorders in which the immune system plays an important role, for example rheumatoid arthritis and septic shock, and that PARP inhibitors can have an advantageous effect on the course of the disorder (H. Kroger et al. Inflammation 2O, (1996), 203-215; W. Ehrlich et al. Rheumatol.  Int.   15  (1995), 171-172; C. Szabo et al., Proc.  Natl. Acad.  Sci.   USA  95. (1998), 3867-3872; S. Cuzzocrea et al. Eur.  J.  Pharmacol.  342   (1998), 67-76).<br>
For the purposes of this invention, PARP is also understood as meaning isoenzymes of the PARP enzyme described above.<br>
Furthermore, the PARP inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide exhibited protective effects in a model for circulatory shock (S. Cuzzocrea et al., Br.  J.  Pharmacol.  221  (1997), 1065-1074).<br>
PARP is also involved in diabetes mellitus (V. Burkhart et al.. Nature Medicine (1999), 5314-19).<br>
Benzimidazoles have been widely described.<br>
The synthesis of 2-phenylbenzimidaz-4-ylcunides which also carry a substituted alkyl chain on the amide radical and which are said to have a cytotoxic effect is mentioned in J. Med. Chem. 23L (1990), 814-819. WO 97/04771 mentions 4-benzimidazolamides which inhibit PARS. In particular, derivatives which carry a phenyl ring in the 2-position, where the phenyl ring may furthermore be substituted by simple substituents such as nitro, methoxy or CF3, are described there as being effective. Although some of these substances exhibit good inhibition of the enzyme PARP, the derivatives described there have the disadvantage that they have little or no solubility in aqueous solutions and hence cannot be applied as an aqueous solution.<br>
Benzimidazoles which carry a piperidine ring in the 2-position have also been described. Thus, in J. Het. Chem. 24 (1987), 31, derivatives have been prepared as antihistamine drugs. In J. Het. Chem. 12 (1995), 707 and J. Het. Chem. li (1989), 541, analogous<br><br>
compounds having the same use have been described. 2-Piperidinylbenzimidazoles are mentioned in EP 818454 as antihistamine drugs and in WO 9736554 as agents against hepatitis. Derivatives are likewise mentioned in CA 80, 146143, Fr. 2103639 and in Khim. Geterotsikl. Soedin 1 (1974), 104.<br>
However, the importance of substituents on the phenylaromatics in the benzimidazole fragment has not been investigated. Furthermore, those benzimidazoles which carry a 4- to 8-membered heterocycle, in particular a piperidine ring, in the 2-position have not been described to date as being PAR? inhibitors.<br>
The present application describes the surprising finding that the introduction of a carboxamide radical on the benzimidazole aromatic gives benzimidazoles which constitute novel and hi^ghly effective PARP inhibitors, provided that they are substituted in the 2-position by a saturated heterocycle.<br>
In a number of treatments, such as for stroke, the active compounds are applied intravenously as an infusion solution. For this purpose, it is necessary to have substances, in this case PARP inhibitors, which have sufficient water solubility at or about physiological pH (i.e. pH of 5-8), so that an infusion solution can be prepared. However, many of the PARP inhibitors described, in particular the more effective PARP inhibitors, have the disadvantage that they exhibit only little or no water solubility at the pH values and are therefore not suitable for intravenous application. Such active compounds can be applied only with excipients which are intended to impart water solubility (cf. WO 97/04771). These excipients, for example polyethylene glycol and dimethyl sulfoxide, frequently cause side effects or are even not tolerated. No highly effective PARP inhibitors having sufficient water solubility have been described to date.<br>
It was surprisingly found that benzimidazoles which carry a piperidine ring on the imidazole ring are highly effective inhibitors and, owing to the incorporation of the aliphatic eunine radical, permit salt formation with acids, resulting in substantially improved water solubility and hence permitting the preparation of an infusion solution.<br>
The present invention describes novel benzimidazole derivatives of the formula I which have advantages over the compounds described above and constitute potent PARP inhibitors and at the<br><br>
saline time have sufficient water solubility. When compounds of the formula I are referred to, they are understood as meaning the compounds of the formulae la and lb.<br>

The preferred meaning of A is piperidine, pyrrolidine, piperazine, morpholine or homopiperazine.<br>
The compounds of the formula I where A is piperazine or piperidine are particularly preferred.<br>
The compounds of the formula I may be used in the form of racemates, enantiomerically pure compounds or diastereomers. If enantiomerically pure compounds are desired, these can be obtained, for exeunple, by carrying out a classical resolution of<br><br>
the racemate with the compounds of the formula I or their intermediates used in a suitable optically active base or acid.<br>
The saturated or monounsaturated cyclic structures A may be present as cis-isomers, trans-isomers or mixtures thereof.<br>
The present invention also relates to compounds which are mesomers or tautomers of compounds of the formula I.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to the physiologically tolerated salts of the compound I, which can be obtained by reacting compounds I with a suitable acid or base. Suitable acids and bases are listed, for excunple, in Fortschritte der Arzneimittelforschung, 1966, Birkhauser Verlag, Vol. 10, pages 224-285. These include, for example, hydrochloric acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, acetic acid, formic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, etc., and sodium hydroxide, lithiiim hydroxide, potassixom hydroxide and Tris.<br>
Prodrugs are understood as meaning those compounds which are metabolized in vivo  to give compounds of the formula I. Typical prodrugs are phosphates, carbeunates of cunino acids, esters and others.<br>
The preparation of the novel benzimidazoles I can be carried out by various routes which are shown in synthesis scheme 1.<br><br><br>
The benzimidazole I or VII is obtained by condensation of the aldehyde V with phenylenediamines VI, the procedure preferably being carried out in polar solvents, such as ethanol or dimethyIformamide, and with the addition of acids, such as acetic acid, at elevated temperatures, as a rule from 80 to 120Â°C. It is advantageous for the reaction to add weak oxidizing agents, such as copper(II) salts, which are added as aqueous solution.<br><br><br>
If, in the benzimidazole VII, R is NH2 novel compounds I are formed directly in the condensation. Otherwise, if R is 0-alkyl, these esters can be reacted with ammonia, if required at elevated temperatures and superatmospheric pressure, to give the amide I. Alternatively, the esters VII can be reacted with hydrazine in polar solvents, such as the alcohols butanol and ethanol or dimethylformamide, at elevated temperatures, preferably from 80 to 130OC, the result being hydrazide VII (R = NHNH2) which can then be reduced under reductive conditions, for example with Raney nickel in alcohols under reflux, to give the amide I.<br>
The radical R1 on the benzimidazole radical in I (R1 = H) is introduced under conventional alkylating conditions. Benzimidazoles I are alkylated with R1 â L, where L is a leaving group, using a base at from 25 to 150OC, but mainly at elevated temperatures such as from 60 to 130Oc, the novel product I where R1  hydrogen being obtained. The procedure is carried out in solvents, for example dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, alcohols, e.g. ethanol, ketones, e.g. methyl ethyl ketone or acetone, aliphatic ethers, e.g. tetrahydrofuran, and hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, it also being possible to use mixtures. Suitable bases are, for example, alcoholates, e.g. sodium ethanolate and potassium tert-butanolate, carbonates, e.g. potassium carbonate, hydrides, e.g. sodium hydride, and hydroxides, e.g. sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide.<br><br>
Various crown ethers, such as 18-crown-6, may also be added in catalytic amounts. Phase transfer conditions may also be employed (for methods, cf. R.C. Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, 1989, page 445 et seq.)Â« The leaving group L used may be a halide, e.g. bromide, chloride or iodide, or, for excimple, a tolysate or mesylate.<br><br>
Alternatively to the aldehydes V shown in Scheme 1 it is also possible to use benzoic acids, such as IX (cf. Scheme 2), or benzonitriles, such as XIII (cf. Scheme 3), instead of the benzaldehyde. The preparation of these derivatives is carried out analogously to the preparation of the substituted benzaldehydes V. Starting from IX, the condensation to give VII is carried out in two stages. First, the benzoic acid XI is reacted with the aniline VI with a peptide-like coupling to give the amide XII. The conditions used here are the conventional ones which are listed, for example, in Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, 4th Edition, E5, Chapter V, or C.R. Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publisher, 1989, page 972 et seq. Cyclization to the benzimidazole is then effected at elevated temperatures, for example from 60 to 180Â°C, with or without solvents, such as dimethylformamide, with the addition of acids, such as acetic acid, or directly in acetic acid itself.<br>
The reaction of the phenylenediamine VI with a benzonitrile XIII is likewise effected under conventional conditions. It is possible to employ solvents, such as dimethylformamide with the<br><br>
addition of acids at elevated temperatures, such as from 60 to 200OC. However, it is also possible to use the conventional methods for the preparation of amides from benzonitriles, as described in J. Amer. Chem. Soc. (1957), 427 and J, Org. Chem. (1987), 1017.<br>
The substituted benzimidazoles I contained in the present invention are inhibitors of the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase or PARP (EC 2.4.2.30).<br>
The inhibitory effect of the substituted benzimidazoles I was determined by an enzyme test already known in the literature, the Ki value being determined as a measure of activity. The benzimidazoles I were measured in this way for an inhibitory effect of the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase or PARP (EC 2.4.2.30).<br>
The substituted benzimidazoles of the formula I are inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) or, as it is also referred to, poly(ADP-ribose)synthase (PARS) and can therefore be used for the treatment and prophylaxis of disorders which are associated with increased activity of these enzymes.<br>
The compounds of the formula I can be used for preparing drugs for the treatment of damage following ischemias and for prophylaxis where ischemias of various organs are expected.<br>
The present benzimidazoles of the formula I can then be used for the treatment and prophylaxis of neurodegenerative disorders which occur after ischemia, trauma (craniocerebral trauma), massive bleeding, subarachnoid hemorrhages and stroke, and of neurodegenerative disorders such as multi-infarct dementia, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease and of epilepsies, in particular of generalized epileptic attacks, for example petit mal and tonoclonic attacks and partial epileptic attacks such as temporal lobe, and complex partial attacks, and furthermore for the treatment and prophylaxis of cardiac damage following myocardial ischemias and damage to the kidneys following renal ischemias, for example acute renal insufficiency, acute renal failure, damage which is caused by drug therapy such as, for example, during ciclosporin therapy or damage which occurs during or after a kidney transplantation. Furthermore, the compounds of the formula I can be used for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction and damage which occurs during and after its lysis under treatment with drugs (for example with TPA, reteplase or streptokinase or mechanically with a laser or Rotablator) and of microinfarcts such as, for example, during and after replacement<br><br>
of the heart valve, aneurysm resections and heart transplantations. The present benzimidazoles I can also be used for the treatment of a revascularization of critically narrowed coronary arteries, for example in PCTA and bypass operations, and critically narrowed peripheral arteries, for example arteries of the leg. Moreover, the benzimidazoles I may be useful in the chemotherapy of tumors and their metastasis and for the treatment of inflammations and rheumatic disorders, for example rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, the compounds of the formula I can be used to treat diabetes mellitus or to treat sepsis and multiorgan failure such as, for exeimple, during septic shock and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, shock lung).<br>
The novel drug formulations contain a therapeutically effective amount of the compounds I in addition to the conventional drug<br>
excipients.<br>
For local external application, for example in the form of powders, ointments or sprays, the active compounds may be present in the conventional concentrations. As a rule, the active compounds are present in an amount of from 0.001 to 1, preferably from 0.001 to 0.1, % by weight.<br>
In the case of internal use, the preparations are administered in single doses. From 0.1 to 100 mg per kg of body weight are administered in a single dose. The formulation can be administered daily in one or more doses, depending on the type and severity of the disorders.<br>
Depending on the desired method of application, the novel drug formulations contain the conventional carriers and diluents in addition to the active compound. For local external application, pharmaceutical excipients such as ethanol, isopropanol, oxethylated castor oil, oxethylated hydrogenated castor oil, polyacrylic acid, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol stearate, ethoxylated fatty alcohols, liquid paraffin, vaseline and lanolin, may be used. For internal use, for example, lactose, propylene glycol, ethanol, starch, talc and polyvinylpyrrolidone are suitable.<br>
Antioxidants, such as tocopherol and butylated hydroxyanisole, and butylated hydroxytoluene, flavor-improving additives, stabilizers, emulsifiers and lubricants may furthermore be present.<br><br>
The substances contained in the formulation in addition to the active compound, and the substances used in the preparation of pharmaceutical formulations, are toxicologically safe and are compatible with the respective active compound. The preparation of the drug formulations is carried out in a conventional manner, for exanple by mixing the active compound with other conventional carriers and diluents.<br>
The drug formulations can be administered by various methods of application, for example perorally, parenterally, such as intravenously by infusion, subcutaneously, intraperitoneally and topically. Thus, the formulations such as tablets, emulsions, infusion and injection solutions, pastes, ointments, gels, creams, lotions, powders and sprays are possible.<br>

Example A:  Inhibition of the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase<br>
or PARP (EC 2.4.2.30)<br>
A 96-well microtiter plate (Falcon) was coated with histones (type II-AS; SIGMA H7755). In addition, histones were dissolved in carbonate buffer (0.05 M NaHC03; pH 9.4) to a concentration of<br><br>
50 ug/inl. The individual wells of the microtiter plate were incubated overnight, each with 100 \il  of the histone solution. Thereafter, the histone solution was removed and the individual wells were incubated with 200 u1 of a 1% strength BSA (bovine serum albumin) solution in carbonate buffer for 2 hours at room temperature. Washing was then carried out three times with wash buffer (0.05% TweenlO in PBS). For the enzyme reaction, 50 u1 of the enzyme reaction solution per well (5 ^1 of reaction buffer (IM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT), 0.5 \il  of PARP (c = 0.22 \iq/\xl),   4 Rl activated DNA (SIGMA D-4522, 1 mg/ml in water), 40.5 p.1 of H2O) were preincubated with 10 \il  of an inhibitor solution for 10 minutes. The enzyme reaction was started by adding 40 ul of a substrate solution (4 ul of reaction buffer (see above), 8 ul of NAD solution (100 ^un in H2O), 28 ul of H2O). The reaction time was 20 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by washing three times with wash buffer (see above). This was followed by incubation for one hour at room temperature with a specific anti-poly~ADP-ribose antibody. The antibodies used were monoclonal anti-poly-(ADP-ribose) antibodies "lOH" (Biomol SA-276).<br>
The antibodies were used in a 1:5000 dilution in antibody buffer (1% BSA and PBS; 0.05% Tween20). Washing three times with wash buffer was followed by incubation for an hour at room temperature with the secondary antibody. Here, an anti-mouse-IgG coupled with peroxidase (Boehringer Mannheim) was used for the monoclonal antibody and an anti-rabbit-IgG coupled with peroxidase (SIGMA A-6154) was used for the rabbit antibody, each in a 1:10,000 dilution in an antibody buffer. After washing three times with wash buffer, the color reaction was carried out using a 100 fil/well of color reagent (SIGMA, TMB ready-mix, T8540) for about 15 minutes at room temperature. The color reaction was stopped by a 100 ul of 2M H2SO4. Measurement was then carried out immediately (450 against 620 nm; ELISA "Easy Reader" EAR340AT plate reader, SLT-Lab instruments, Austria). The Ki can be determined in a conventional manner from the inhibition curves at various substrate concentrations.<br>
Example B:  Determination of the water solubility<br>
A compound to be measured was dissolved directly in a specified volume of water and the resulting solution was brought to a pH of from 5 to 6 with a sodium acetate solution so that the concentration of the active compound to be tested was reached. If the test substance was not present as a water-soluble salt, it was dissolved in a very small amount of dimethyl sulfoxide and then diluted with water (final concentration of dimethyl<br><br>
sulfoxide s 1%), after which the pH was adjusted here too. Here, Example 1 according to the invention gave a solubility of &gt; 0.5%.<br><br><br><br>
