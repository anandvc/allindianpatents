				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a motor vehicle. In principle, in extreme cases, motor vehicles can be made up completely of individual parts or put together from prefabricated parts. The conventional modern method of manufacturing motor vehicles is a mixed system.<br>
Components and sub-assemblies prefabricated to a varying extent are inserted into opened, ready-painted bodies. The disadvantage of this is that sensitive ready-painted bodies may be damaged by the wide variety of far-reaching assembly work. Damage to the outer skin during assembly will involve expensive after-treatment post final assembly. The supply and assembly of large parts is complicated and, since it is often difficult to automate, has to be performed by hand under adverse physiological conditions. Assembly of smaller parts increases the number of assembly operations on site, causes the staff to get in one another's way and lengthens the assembly time. Standardisation and model flexibility are difficult to combine.<br>
As is known, economic advantages can be obtained if the minimum number of pre-fitted sub-assemblies are used in the manufacture of complex engineering<br>
products. Recent manufacturing concepts, therefore, are based on prefabricating a vehicle in individual modules of maximum size. The individual modules can be completed separately. After being manufactured, optionally at different workplaces, they are brought on the conveyor belt for final assembly of the vehicle.<br>
The manual by Horst Pippert "Karosserietechnik", 2nd edition, Wurzburg: Vogel Buchverlag 1 993, discloses various modular construction methods for rationalising the assembly of motor vehicles.<br>
In the sub-frame method of construction, the sub-frames receive both the chassis and the drive. They are pre- assembled with these units and screwed to the self-supporting body via Silentblock-type rubber-metal connections.<br>
It is also known, for example, to insert the entire dashboard, including the cockpit and pedals in one module, into the front part of the semifinished body and stick or screw it to the floor group.<br>
In another embodiment the floor element has a module with ready-mounted cockpit, pedal supports and seats, can be inserted from beneath and stuck in the body bearing structure.<br>
It is also known to separate the front region from the roof and the floor group.  By<br>

It is also known, for example, to insert the entire dashboard, including the cockpit and pedals in one module, into the front part of the semifinished body and stick or screw it to the floor group.<br>
In another embodiment the floor element has a module with ready-mounted cockpit, pedal supports and seats, can be inserted from beneath and stuck in the body bearing structure.<br>
It is also known to separate the front region from the roof and the floor group.   By<br><br>
means of this horizontal division of the vehicle, the floor group can easily be equipped and, more especially, the drive block can easily be fitted before final assembly.<br>
A division into a front and a rear part results in a vertically divided body. In this case a closed, rigid passenger compartment in the middle of the vehicle is connected to separately-prepared front and rear parts in steel frame construction.<br>
All the different methods are based on the problem of prefabricating maximum-sized units. To a varying extent, however, they all have the disadvantage that they mostly optimise only one requirement, e.g. ease of assembly, but require compensating far-reaching structural changes or design changes.<br>
Frequently it is necessary to abandon the economic method of constructing the self-supporting body from pressed parts, or new materials have to be used without a convincing amount of advantage.<br>
WO 92/07749 discloses a method of assembling a motor vehicle wherein a front<br>
structure after completion is connected to a completed rear structure. The dividing<br>
line of the body extends centrally via the roof region.    A disadvantage of the<br>
known method is that owing to the required stability it is very complicated to<br>
connect the two main parts of the body.  In the case of a self- supporting body the<br>
in the other main body part (rear structure), and after the main body parts (front and rear structure) have been at least substantially completed, they are put together and rigidly joined.<br>
This is a means of prefabrication from only two main parts or main groups. Existing manufacturing equipment and assembly methods can largely be retained when manufacturing and completing the front and rear structure. The traditional materials can continue to be used and no design changes are necessary. The front structure and rear structure can be assembled at different places. At the final stage, they are simply brought together at the same place and riveted, stuck, screwed or welded together.   The body is self- supporting as before.<br>
The cost of having various models on offer is considerably reduced, because usually the engineering variants are basically restricted to different motorisation whereas there are much wider variations in the decoration, interior and other accessories. Further flexibility is obtained since there is wide freedom to combine the individual variants up to the final stage.<br>
Especially advantageously, the mudguard, the bonnet, the doors and other external covering parts such as the bumper, radiator grille and the like are secured to the front structure only after the main body parts have been joined together. By this means, all the sensitive- surface parts are absent when the front part is assembled. They therefore cannot be damaged during assembly of the drive and transmission<br>
in the other main body part (rear structure), and after the main body parts (front and rear structure) have been at least substantially completed, they are put together and rigidly joined.<br>

By this means, all the sensitive- surface parts are absent when the front part is assembled. They therefore cannot be damaged during assembly of the drive and transmission<br>
block with the main auxiliary groups and when the cockpit and pedals are incorporated in the front part.<br>
Also, in all model variants, the front part can be coated with a uniform paint, which is covered and therefore made invisible after the outer skin parts have been assembled. In view of the streamlining requirements on a modern motor vehicle, this modification has a further advantage because the bonnet must substantially cover the lower frame of the windscreen, e.g. so as to recess and streamline the windscreen wiper, and the A-column is covered by the windscreen or door frame, which is flush when stuck in. This provides hitherto unknown advantages in the choice of production sites, market flexibility, logistics and repairs.<br>
To this end also it is advantageous if the components for subsequently securing to the front structure and painting in the colour of the vehicle can be painted together with the rear structure, simultaneously if necessary. This ensures that no differences in colour shade are observable in the finished vehicle.<br>
In principle the main body parts can be joined at the level of the A-column, the connecting-places being provided on the windscreen frame and on the floor group approximately at the level of the top end of the A- column. The frame for the windscreen can be disposed either on the front structure, so that the A-column becomes part of the front structure, or on the rear structure, so that it becomes part of the rear structure.   The advantage of disposing the windscreen frame on<br>
the front structure is that the rear structure has a larger opening for fitting the interior.<br>
When the main body parts are separated underneath the windscreen there is greater freedom to design the body segment. For example a limousine or a coupe version can both be equipped with the same front structure.<br>
In another embodiment the front structure can comprise the entire floor group, i.e. the car floor and the running gear, by which means the advantages of the invention can also be applied to standard-drive vehicles (front or rear drive).<br>
The invention can be used to obtain new forms of standardisation, thus improving the logistics of manufacture, use, disposal, repair and recycling. The combination of the individual advantages has an additional, decisive synergic effect compared with traditional methods. Left-hand and right-hand steering versions of vehicles can easily be constructed.<br>
Owing to the wide opening near the middle of the hollow body member, parts can be supplied and fitted easily and simultaneously in both segments (main body parts) before final assembly.<br>
Examples of the invention will now be explained in detail with reference to drawings, in which:<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to method of manufacturing a vehicle, wherein the semi-finished body is pre-assembled in two main parts, front structure (1) and rear structure(2); the main body parts, front structure (1) and rear structure(2) are independently equipped with the associated components and the main body parts, front structure (1) and rear structure(2) are brought together and rigidly connected after being substantially completed,<br>
characterized in that<br>
the engineering components, engine, transmission, subsidiary units and the similar components are incorporated in one main body part, front structure (1) and the mainly decorative components as seats, coverings, carpet and the similar decorative components are incorporated in the other main body part, rear structure (2);<br>
the parting line between the two main body parts, front structure (1) and rear structure(2); extends at the level of the A-column (9), the upper connecting place being provided on the frame (10) of the windscreen (18) and the lower connection being provided between the A-column and the B-column, and<br>
after the main body parts, front structure (1) and rear structure(2) have been connected together, the mudguard (3), the engine bonnet (4), the doors (5) and other outer covering parts (bumper (6), radiator grille (7) and the similar components are secured to one main body part, front structure (1).<br>
The invention also relates to semifinished body for use in the method as aforementioned, having a front structure (1) and a rear structure, wherein the said front structure (1) is being bounded by the body nose (8) and the frame (10) , the windscreen (18), the A-column (9) and the rear structure (2) being bounded by the body tail (11) and the roof attachment 15) to the A-column (9) and front structure (1) and rear structure (2) being separate units.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Examples of the invention will now be explained in detail with reference to drawings, in which:<br>
After the front part 1 and rear part 2 have been fitted together, in the final stage, the standard-painted front structure 1, now the front part of the vehicle, is connected to the attached parts, i.e. the mudguard 3, the bonnet 4, the front doors 5, the bumper 6 and the radiator grille 7, which form the finish and are painted in parallel with the rear structure and are delivered in the same colour as the vehicle. The connection as before can be by riveting, screwing or sticking. Parts of the vehicle not covered by attached parts and still visible in the uniform basic paint, particularly inside the vehicle, can be concealed by soft cover parts.<br>
Either the wheels 16 are fitted last on to the finished vehicle or they are attached during assembly of the two main body parts. Of course the vehicle must be completed by other components such as fuel and brake lines and electric connections and the like.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a modification of the front structure 1 and rear structure 2. The frame 10 of the windscreen 20 and consequently the A-column 9 is associated with the rear structure 2. The front structure 1 therefore ends at the bottom end 9a of the A-column 9. The front structure 1 and rear structure 2 are subsequently connected via the aforementioned end 9a and the A- column 9. This embodiment has the advantage that the variability of the body is increased without affecting the front structure 1.<br>
In   another  embodiment  (not  shown)  the  floor  group   12  can  be  associated<br>
completely with the front structure 1. If however the rear structure 2 needs to be provided with a floor plate and the floor group 12 forms only one running-gear frame, the advantages of the invention can also be obtained in the case of vehicles with a front engine and rear drive.<br>
As Fig. 5 shows, in streamlined vehicles the A-column 9 is completely covered by the frame of the front door 5 and the windscreen 20 which is stuck in flush. The bonnet 4, which extends far beyond the bottom end of the windscreen 20, covers the bottom region of the window-frame.<br>
After the front part 1 and rear part 2 have been fitted together, in the final stage, the standard-painted front structure 1, now the front part of the vehicle, is connected to the attached parts, i.e. the mudguard 3, the bonnet 4, the front doors 5, the bumper 6 and the radiator grille 7, which form the finish and are painted in parallel with the rear structure and are delivered in the same colour as the vehicle. The connection as before can be by riveting, screwing or sticking. Parts of the vehicle not covered by attached parts and still visible in the uniform basic paint, particularly inside the vehicle, can be concealed by soft cover parts.<br>
Either the wheels 1 6 are fitted last on to the finished vehicle or they are attached during assembly of the two main body parts. Of course the vehicle must be completed by other components such as fuel and brake lines and electric connections and the like.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a modification of the front structure 1 and rear structure 2. The frame 10 of the windscreen 20 and consequently the A-column 9 is associated with the rear structure 2. The front structure 1 therefore ends at the bottom end 9a of the A-column 9. The front structure 1 and rear structure 2 are subsequently connected via the aforementioned end 9a and the A- column 9. This embodiment has the advantage that the variability of the body is increased without affecting the front structure 1.<br>
In   another   embodiment   (not  shown)   the   floor  group   12   can   be   associated<br>
completely with the front structure 1. If however the rear structure 2 needs to be provided with a floor plate and the floor group 12 forms only one running-gear frame, the advantages of the invention can also be obtained in the case of vehicles with a front engine and rear drive.<br>
As Fig. 5 shows, in streamlined vehicles the A-column 9 is completely covered by the frame of the front door 5 and the windscreen 20 which is stuck in flush. The bonnet 4, which extends far beyond the bottom end of the windscreen 20, covers the bottom region of the window-frame.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
