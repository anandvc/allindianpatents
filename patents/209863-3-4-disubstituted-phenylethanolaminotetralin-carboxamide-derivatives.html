For example, 2-[(2S)-2-[[(2RS)-2-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxy-3-hydroxymethylpheny1)ethyl]amino]-1,2,3,4-<br>
tetrahydronaphthalen-7-yloxy]-N,N-dimethylacetamide showed the EC50 value at a mol concentration of 5.3 x 10-9, and 2-[(2S)-2-[[(2R)-2-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxy-3-hydroxymethylphenyl)ethyl]amino ]-l,2,3,4-<br>
tetrahydronaphthalen-7-yloxy]-N,N-dimethylacetamide at a mol concentration of 2.6 x 10-9.  Thus, the compounds of the present invention have markedly potent ß2-adrenergic receptor stimulating activity and therefore are remarkably useful as a ß2-adrenergic receptor stimulation agent.<br>
When the in vitro test for measuring ß1-adrenergic receptor stimulating activity was carried out in the usual way using isolated rat atrium, the compounds of the present invention represented by the general formula (I) above showed an activity to increase 20 beats per minute of rat heart rate (EC2o value) at an approximate mol concentration of 5.0 x 10-7 or more.  For example, 2-[(2S)-2-[[(2RS)-2-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxy-3-hydroxymethylphenyl)ethyl]amino]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-7-yloxy]-N,N-dimethylacetamide showed the EC2o value at a mol concentration of 2.5 x 10-6, and 2-[(2S)-2-[[(2R)-2-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxy-3-hydroxymethylphenyl)ethyl]amino]-l,2,3,4-<br>
tetrahydronaphthalen-7-yloxy]-N,N-dimethylacetamide at a mol concentration of 9.4 x 10-7.  Thus, the compounds of the present invention have markedly weak ß1-adrenergic receptor stimulating activity in comparison with the aforementioned ß2-adrenergic receptor stimulating activity.<br>
In consequence, the compounds of the present invention have markedly potent ß1-adrenergic receptor stimulating activity with markedly high selectivity in comparison with ß1-adrenergic receptor stimulating activity, so that it is a extremely useful highly selective ß2-adrenergic receptor stimulating agent of in which burdens on cardiovascular systems are reduced due to suppression of side effects upon the heart (e.g., tachycardia) caused by ß1-adrenergic receptor stimulating activity.<br>
The present invention is a selective ß2-adrenergic receptor stimulating agent which is extremely useful as, for example, an agent for the prevention of threatened abortion, premature labor, as an agent for the treatment or prevention of diseases associated with bronchiostenosis and airway obstruction (bronchodilator) and as an agent for pain remission or stone removal in urolithiasis.<br>
Also, the compounds of the present invention<br>
represented by the general formula (I) above are an extremely stable compound and therefore have excellent storage stability.<br>
When the 3,4-disubstituted phenylethanolamino-tetralincarboxamide derivatives of the present invention represented by the general formula (I) above and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are used in the practical treatment, they are administered orally or parenterally in the form of appropriate pharmaceutical<br>
compositions such as tablets, powders, fine granules, granules, capsules, injections, and the like.  These pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated in accordance with conventional methods using conventional pharmaceutical carriers and excipients and other additives.<br>
The dose is appropriately decided depending on the sex, age, body weight, degree of symptoms and the like of each patient to be treated, which is approximately within the range of from 1 to 1,000 mg per day per adult in the case of oral administration and approximately within the range of from 0.01 to 100 mg per day per adult in the case of parenteral administration, and the daily dose is divided into one to several doses per day.<br>

Test Example 1<br>
Action of the agent on the spontaneous contractions of<br>
isolated rat myometrium<br>
The uterus of a pregnant SD rat (21 days of<br>
pregnancy) was isolated.  A uterine muscle strip (15 mm long, 5 mm wide) was longitudinally dissected and suspended vertically in a 10 ml chamber and prepared for recording of isometric contractions.  The endometrium and placenta-attached part were carefully removed from the uterus with a fine forceps, and the test was carried out in accordance with the Magnus method.  The sample was set in Locke-Ringer solution at 37°C aerated with a mixed gas containing 95% of oxygen and 5% of carbon dioxide, and 1 g of load was applied. Spontaneous contractions of isolated rat myometrium were induced isometrically via a pressure transducer and recorded on a rectigram.  The efficacy was evaluated by comparing the total degree of uterine contraction during 5 minutes before the addition of the agent with the total degree of uterine contraction during 5 minutes after the addition of the agent and calculating the 50% inhibitory concentration as EC50. Test Example 2 Action of the agent on the heart rate of isolated rat atrium<br>
The atrium of an SD male rat (350 to 400 g in body weight) was isolated and the test was carried out in accordance with the Magnus method.  The sample was set in a Krebs-Henselite solution at 37°C aerated with a mixture gas<br>
containing 95% of oxygen and 5% of carbon dioxide, and 1 g of load was applied.  The atrial contraction was induced isometrically via a pressure transducer and recorded on a rectigram.  After addition of the agent, its efficacy was evaluated by calculating EC20 value which is the agent concentration which increases 20 beats per minute of heart rate.<br>
Test Example 3 Acute Toxicity<br>
To 5 male ICR mice of 4 weeks age was administered intravenously 2-[(2S)-2-[[(2R)-2-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxy-3-hydroxymethyIphenyl)ethyl]amino]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-7-yloxy]-N,N-dimethylacetamide 0.5 sulfate in saline at dose of 20 mg/kg.  No death of animals was observed during 24 hours after the administration.<br><br><br><br><br>
