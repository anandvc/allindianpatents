This invention relates to a cross 1inkable and non-aromatic polyurethane potting compound.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Cross 1inkable polyurethanes have wider applications in general as well as biomedical applications, such as adhesive and potting compounds. Potting compounds are generally used to encapsulate a component in a module. Such potting compounds are essentially used for encapsulating hollow fibers for fabrication of hollow fiber haemodialyzer for biomedical application.<br>
Polyurethanes are generally produced using a diisocyanate, polyol and hardener or chain exten^der. Aromatic polyurethanes based on toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and diphenyl methane dilsocyanate (MDI) are susceptible to degrade if processed in the presence of moisture and if autoclaved in an aqueous solution. In this connection, reference is made to M Szycher, V C Poirier, D J Demsey, J Elasto Plast. 15 (1963) pg. 81 and to A Mazzu, C P Smith, J Biomed. Hat. Res., 18 (1984) pg. 961. Gamma radiation and autoclaving are used to sterilise devices which are fabricated using polyurethane polymers. Excessive and repeated sterilisation are prone to cause chain scission of polyurethane and formation of low molecular weight components. Reference is also made to A Mazzu, C P Smith, J Biomed. Mat. Res. 18 (1984) pg. 961. It has been reported that a potential carcinogenic chemical  4,4'-methy1ene  dianiline (MDA) is  formed  in  thermo-<br><br>
plastic  MDI based polyurethane during  autoclave  sterilisation.<br>
Reference is made to A Mazzu, C P Smith, J Biomed. Mat. Res.,  18<br>
(2) <i964 pg. similarly and toluene diamine></i964>
has  been  found as hydrolytic products of  toluene  diisocyanate<br>
based polyurethane foam (Microthane) when it reacts with water at<br>
elevated  temperature.  Reference  is  invited  to  C  Batich,  J<br>
Williams,  R King, J Biomed. Mat. Res., 23, (1983), pg. 311.  TDA<br>
has been detected in clinical samples of urine and breast  tissue<br>
of  patients with 7 months old polyurethane (Polyester-TDI)  foam<br>
(R) covered covered Meme breast implants (M/s Surgitek    &gt;. In  this<br>
connection,  reference is invited to S C Chan, D C Birdsell, C  Y<br>
Gradeen,  Clin.  Chem.  37 (1991) pg. 2143.  The  degradation  of<br>
(R)	(R)<br>
Microthane     foam cover in Meme    breast implant has  resulted<br>
in  court  litigation  and the implant  was  withdrawn  from  the market. PRIOR ART<br>
Apart from the risks associated with the use of aromatic poly-urethanes as implants in biomedical applications, aromatic poly¬urethane (MDI based) potting compounds which were used in the fabrication of haemodialyzers were found to leach MDA in serum after gamma irradiation sterilisation with increased dose of radiation. In this connection, reference is invited to HShintani and A Nakamura, J Biomed. Mat. Res., 25 (1991) pg. 1275. Some investigators  have  reported  carcinogenic response  of  MDA  in<br><br>
rodents.  In this connection, reference is made to J Autian, A  R Singh, J E Turner Cancer. Res., 35 (975) pg. 1591. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus an object of this invention to develop a biocompatible cross 1inkable and non-aromatic potting compound for fabrication of hollow fiber haemodialyzer.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a process for  the production of cross 1inkable potting compound with minimum setting time for fabrication of hollow fiber haemodialyzer. Further  objects  and advantages of this invention will  be  more apparent from the ensuing description. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention, there is provided a cross Iinkable and non-aromatic polyurethane potting compound comprising a blend of component I of isocyanate terminated prepolymer of poly¬urethane and component II of aliphatic, non-aromatic di isocyanate.<br>
Reference is hereinafter made to the various steps with the numeral values of the parameters. However, such a reference to the numerical values is only by way of an example and without Intending to imply any limitation on the scope of the invention.<br><br>
Preparation  of  isocyanate  terminated  polyurethane  prepolymer<br>
(component  I)  is  carried out  with  a  difunctional  aliphatic<br>
diisocyanate compound such as hexamethyIene diisocyanate and<br>
dicyclohexyl  methane  diisocyanate and a  polyfunctional  polyol<br>
which  is generally a multifunctional water-inso]uble polyol such<br>
o as castor oil, at a temperature of 40-150 C for 10-60 mins. under<br>
inert atmosphere. The prepolymer is cooled and stored under cold conditions. The component II is prepared by blending a difunc¬tional  hydroxyl terminated polymer of molecular  weight  ranging<br>
400-3000  with a diester based activator at a temperature  of  4-<br>
o 100 C for 1-24 hrs.. The difunctional hydroxyl terminated water-insoluble polymer is such a^ poly propylene glycol and the diester based activator is such as dibutyl tin dilaurate. The component II is cooled and stored under cold condition. The potting compound is then prepared by blending component 1 and component 11 at the mixing ratio of 20:80 to 80:20 totalling 100.<br>
The blended components I and II is heated at a temperature of 25-<br>
o 100 C  for 1-100 mins.. The heated potting compound is  dispensed<br>
to  the  hollow  fiber  module using  a  dispenser.  The  potting<br>
compound  sets to a solid mass after 90-120 mins.  under  centri-<br>
o fugal  rotation with 700-900 rpm and temperature of 30-60 C.  The<br>
demolding is carried out after a duration of 100-180 mins..<br>
The  cross 1inkabie and non-aromatic polyurethane prepared by  the<br>
process  (i)-(iii)  of the present inventiion  is  evaluated  for<br>
various properties as shown in Table 1.<br><br>

The basic charateristics of cross 1inkable and non-aromatic potting compound components shown in Table 1 clearly reveals that the viscosity of the mixture is moderate enough to dispense to the hollow fiber module. The setting time and deroold time is also reasonably low. The recommended processing temperature for mixing<br><br>
the components as well as for setting is also low. These charac¬teristics enable fast setting to rigid crosslinked mass. The potting compound being pseudoplas tic, flows through the inter¬stices of the hollow fiber bundle easily under centrifugal rota¬tion without wicking. Therefore, a well defined circular encap¬sulation of fiber bundle inside the module is formed. The encap¬sulation results into a glassy, transparent mass in which the fibers are visibly seen. The crosslinked potted compound has appreciable shore A hardness. The stability of the crosslinked potted compound is also good as there is no weight loss of auto-claved sample in heptane even upto 5 days. The marginal weight loss in prolonged duration with increased cycles of autoclaving is due to the denaturation of fibers in the potted composite. Generally in hospitals, the haemodialyzers are not exposed to such drastic conditions. The haemodia1yzers are generally cleaned with clean water after deproteinization and stored in formalin for removal of micro-organisms. Therefore the present potting compound setting to a crosslinked material is stable enough to meet the hospital requirments.<br>
Thus, the cross 1inkable and non-aromatic potting compound prepared by the process of the present invention has the following advantages.<br>
1. The potting compound is prepared from aliphatic diisocyanate instead of aromatic diisocyanate. Thus, the risk of formation of potential carcinogenic chemical is avoided.<br><br>
2.	All the reactants in components I and li are compatible. The components I and 11 react stoichioraetricaIly. Therefore, the final crosslinked potting compound is glassy and transparent.<br>
3.	Potting compound is pseudoplastic which enables easy dispen¬sing using conventional dispenser.<br>
4.	Potting compound is able to set in short duration without evolving large amount of heat exothermical1y. Therefore, the setting reaction will not affect the hollow fiber bundle.<br>
5.	The penetration of potting compound in to the hollow fiber is<br>
minimal because of fast viscosity build-up. Therefore clogging of<br>
pore at the end of the module is not extensive.<br>
6.	The adhesive bonding of hollow fiber bundle and dialyzer<br>
module of polymethyl methacrylate is good which ensures no<br>
1eakage.<br>
7.	The stability of the crosslinked potting compound is good. It<br>
does not produce any amine compounds during routine sterilisation<br>
and immersion in formalin.<br>
The invention discloses a novel method for the preparation of a new product fo biocomptaible, crosslinkable and non-aromatic potting compound.<br>
After a number of detailed experimental studies as discussed above and inference given therein, we have found that the product of the invention has ensured that the objectives of the invention can be easily achieved.
