				<td>Spinning frame with central drive<br>
The invention relates to a spinning frame according to the preamble of the independent claim.<br>
From the German patent application DE 2 6 41 4 34 a spinning frame of the stated type is known, in which approximately in the middle of the spinning frame or at the ends of the spinning frames electric motors are arranged with or without a gear connection to the single rollers of a drawing unit. In said German application one electric motor is arranged for three rollers of a drawing unit, whereby gear wheels are arranged next to each other for the various rollers of the drawing unit. According to   the      said patent application an electric motor drives approximately in the middle of the spinning frame at first a shaft via a pair of gear wheels, to which drawing unit rollers are arranged, then it drives via the first shaft a second shaft and a third shaft, each of which are connected with rollers. It is to be assumed that in such an arrangement relatively large distances are to be maintained between the single shafts, the rollers respectively, which do not comply with the technological requirements of a modern drawing unit.<br>
It is therefore the object of the invention to provide a drive concept, which makes it possible to have small distances between the shafts, the rollers respectively. This task is solved with a spinning frame according to the characteristic features of the independent claim. The depending claims relate to further advantageous embodiments.<br>
A spinning frame according to the invention requires only little space within the range of the drawing unit drive and offers the advantage of adjustment for the rollers of the drawing unit.<br>
By centrally arranging only three electric motors in the middle of the machine and by grouping gears around these three motors<br><br>
to the various rollers of the drawing unit an operator-friendly and economical drive concept is being furnished.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a spinning frame with a drawing unit drive and a spindle drive in which at least one motor is connected through gears with rollers and/or spindles characterized in that a gear module for rollers is arranged at the longitudinal extension of drive shafts which are coupled coaxially with rollers of a drafting unit, said gear transmission comprising a drive shaft while leaving space for neighbouring drive shafts and/or rollers.<br>
In the following the invention is disclosed in detail according to the figures, wherein shows:<br>
fig. 1   a schematical partial view of a drawing unit drive in longitudinal direction of the spinning frame<br>
fig. 2  a plan view of the arrangement in figure 1,<br>
fig. 3  a schematical illustration of a spinning frame with a central drawing unit drive in a side view vertically to its longitudinal extension,<br>
fig. 4 the outline of two sub-frames arranged in line, provided with one central drawing unit drive each<br>
fig. 5  a schematic illustration of a drawing unit drive with the driven rollers in plan view,<br><br>
fig. 6  a schematic illustration of a drawing unit drive in longitudinal direction of the spinning frame in a further embodiment,<br>
fig. 7a an alternative embodiment with relation to the one shown in figure 1 with one single motor for all spinning frame drives and<br>
fig. 7b a schematic layout of a part of the spindle drive.<br>
In a vertical central plane E of the spinning frame motors 60a, b, c are arranged above each other with vertically directed axis. According to the double arrow at 60b each motor is adjustable with relation to the structure 20 of the spinning frame, this in case that the shafts 40a, 40b, 40c on the drive side of the gear 62a, 62b, 62c have to be adjusted towards eachâ€”<br><br>
other. It is also sufficient, however, if only two of the gears 62a to 62c are adjustable. The adjustability of the shafts 40a,b,c is a textile-technological requirement and is applied with the adjustment of the rollers 3Qa,b,c according to figure 2, which for instance are used in a ring spinning frame for the transport of roving while drawing said roving at the same time. To adjust a gear 61b together with the gear 62b which is flanged to the first, a carriage 68b according to the double arrow at 68b can be shifted in relation to the structure 20, whereby fastening means between the structure 20 and the carriage 68b and between the gear 61b and the carriage secure the position. For an adjustability within a certain limit it can, however, also be sufficient, to, for instance, revolve the gear 62a in relation to the gear 61a around the centre of the gear wheel 620a, so that it is not necessary to provide an expensive carriage construction. At its driving side the first gear 61a is driven by a toothed belt 65a and a gear wheel 66a. A worm 610a is supported coaxially with the gear wheel 66a and meshes with a worm wheel 612a, which is positioned coaxially to the mentioned gear wheel 620a. The latter gear wheel in turn drives a gear wheel 622a in a second gear 62a. The gears 62a,b,c mainly serve the purpose to establish distance between the first gears 61a,b,c and the driving shafts 40a,b,c, since, according to figure 2, the latter shafts are coupled to the rollers 30a,b,c extending over the entire length of the spinning frame. However, in each of the gears 62a,b,c a gear reduction could also be provided. For gear reduction furthermore a third gear 63a,b,c is provided which transfers the driving power of the motor 60a,b,c to the first gear 61a,b,c. The motor shafts 64a,b,c with two gear wheels each are enclosed by the toothed belts 65a, 67a etc., each of which leads to the first gear wheel 66a,b,c, of the first gears. In figure 1 only three first and two second gears 61a,b,c and 62a,b,c, respectively are shown. For a double sided spinning frame, however, these gears are arranged on both sides of the vertical centre plane E of the spinning frame, preferably in point-symmetric arrangement. The positions of the<br><br>
driving side gear wheels 66a,b,c and the belts 65a and 67a,b,c respectively are on the different horizontal planes.<br>
From figure 2 can be seen that the second gears 62a, b,c each are flanged laterally to the first gears 61a,b,c. The driving shafts 40a,b,c of each second gear 62a,b,c are preferably provided as hollow shafts, into which the rollers 30a,b,c are being inserted, preferably in continuous manner. In a drawing unit of ring spinning frames these rollers are called front roller, intermediate roller, back roller respectively. For the reason that during shifting of the gears 61a,b,c and 62a,b,c, the position of the gear wheels 66a,b,c on the driving side of the gears 61a,b,c changes in relation to the respective motors 60a,b,c, the motor 60a,b,c has to be shiftable in longitudinal direction, in the direction of the axis of the rollers 30a,b,c, respectively, so that the tension, the horizontal position respectively of the belts 65a,b,c is being maintained. For clarity of the figures, reference marks for some belts and other gear elements respectively are left out; it is however, understood that for instance analogous to belt 65a on the first gear 61a, the toothed belt at the first gear 61b should be marked with 65b. To ensure adjustability of the motors 60a,b,c, it is of advantage to arrange the motors on carriages 69a,b,c, which allow horizontal shifting according to double arrow 69b and at the same time a vertical shifting with relation to the structure 20.<br>
Figure 5 shows an overall illustration in plan view of two first gears 61a on each longitudinal side of the spinning frame in line with one motor 60a. This unit, with the further related gear elements can be referred to as gear module A, which is provided for driving the outer rollers 30a,d on one side of the spinning frame and 30i, k on the other side of the spinning frame. Besides the first module A there are further modules B, C with the gears 61b, 62b; 61, 62c, etc. respectively, which are arranged to the intermediate rollers 30b,e,h etc.. The<br><br>
three modules A, B, C together make up the drawing unit drive 6.<br>
According to figures 3 and 4 showing a spinning frame in a side view and in a plan view respectively, the drawing unit drives 6a,b each are arranged approximately in the middle of a spinning frame 2 in figure 3, in a sub-frame 2a or 2b respectively according to figure 4. To the right and to the left of the drawing unit drive 6 a larger number of spinning units 22a,b are located, whereby at each spinning unit at least one small tube 81a is mounted to suck off fibres. These tubes 81 lead into a channel 82 which, according to figure 3, runs between the left end of the spinning frame and the drawing unit drive 6a. Between a further channel 84 and the first channel 82 there are two tube bends which ensure that the exhaust air from the area of the drawing unit drive 6 and from the area thereafter is conveyed to the zone near the floor of the spinning mill hall. Between the drawing unit drive 6a and the head part 4 of the spinning frame a further second channel runs parallel in line to the first channel 82, into which also small tubes 81 are being led. Before entering a ventilator 85 in the head part 4, the second channel 83 and the third channel 84 merge into a common channel. The air flows in the direction as indicated by the arrow shown in one of the channels. A central control unit 5 within, at the head part 4 respectively, is interconnected with a further control unit 7a, 7b respectively, through control lines 50a,b, whereby said control units 7a,7b for instance comprise one or several frequency converters for the motors 60a,b,c. Therefore, with one single control unit 5 in the spinning frame 2, several drawing unit drives can be controlled, which operate in different spinning frames or sub-frames 2a,b, according to figure 4 which are operated together or individually. Two sub-frames 2a,b arranged in tandem in longitudinal direction, in line respectively, can thus form a production unit, in which a uniform textile material is being produced. As is indicated in figure 4, for both sub-frames 2a and 2b common sub-systems can be applied:<br><br>
a handling device 10 can patrol along a guide 11 on one longitudinal side of the sub-frame 2a, 2b.<br>
a moving blower 9 according to figure 3 on the left end of the spinning frame 2 can also be arranged to a further spinning frame with the drawing unit drive 6b.<br>
a bobbin conveyor 12 with an endless drive means 13, which is led around both sub-frames, can be provided for the removal of cops and for the delivery of tubes by means of bobbin carrier 14, using only one single transfer station 17 together with a neighbouring second bobbin carrier. In the same way also a single tube loader 15, a bobbin unloader 16 respectively can be arranged at the end of one sub-frame, whereby both devices can serve both sub-frames 2a and 2b in connection with the first bobbin conveyor 12.<br>
Two sub-frames 2a, 2b together can also be called double-spinning frames. In the case of a ring spinning frame on each side of the drawing unit drive 6 for instance 2x three hundred spindles can be driven, so that in a double-spinning frame 3 according to figure 4 approximately 2400 spindles, spinning units respectively can be arranged. With the central arrangement of the drawing unit drive 6 the torsion of the rollers 30a,b,c and 30d,e,f respectively remains within an allowable limit. At standstill of the spinning frame the first gear 63a,b,c prevents a reverse turning of the rollers 30a,b,c being under tension of the drawn roving.<br>
For a larger number of spinning units 22a,b the rollers 30a,b,c are normally subdivided into several sections. They can extend up to a driven shaft 40a,b,c of a second gear 62a,b,c and being coupled to it or even lead through these shafts, if these are furnished hollow shafts. The rollers 30a,b,c are part of a so called drawing unit 45 as indicated in figure 3, which, in particular in a ring spinning frame, is arranged above the<br><br>
. spindles, with spinning rings arranged around them. The rollers 30a,b,c rotate at different speeds, whereby, however, at a double-sided spinning frame with one roller group at each longitudinal side of the spinning frame one roller each of a longitudinal side rotates at the same speed as the corresponding other roller. One motor 60a is being connected via the first, second and third drives 61,62a,63a only with those rollers 30a,d,g,k that rotate at the same speed.<br>
The suction device 8, can be subdivided into a first channel 82 and a second channel 83 in such a way, that in each of the channels 82 and 83 the same pressure conditions are being maintained. The arrangement has the advantage that with a larger number of spinning units 22a,b lower pressure differences occur at the tubes 81, instead of having only one single channel arranged over the whole length of a spinning frame 2.<br>
According to figure 6, a gear unit, which carries at least one motor 60a, can be provided with distribution gears 50a, 50b which correspond with the first gear described above as well as with a further distribution gear 51a, whereby the latter corresponds with the third gear described above. In case that the distribution gear 51a provides a connection between the motor 60a and the distribution gear 50b, as is being illustrated according to figure 6, then the motor 60b is not needed. The distribution gears 50a,b and 51a are shown as belt drives; however they can also be provided as multistep reduction gears. On the gear unit 57 projecting gear components 55a,b,c are fastened, which serve as relocating gears from the distribution gears 50a, 50b, 51a to the driving shafts 40'a, 40'b, 40'c. These shafts correspond with those shafts 40a, 40b, 40c which are coupled to the rollers 30a,b,c etc. as described above. Each relocating gear 55a,b,c comprises, i.e. carries a driving shaft 40'a,b,c, but leaves space for the respective other neighbouring driving shafts 40'b,c,a. In place of the other driving shafts 40'b,c,a, rollers 30b,c,a can also be led<br><br>
. past the relocating gears 55a,b,c, whereby two rollers or shafts each are placed next to the relocating gear 55a,b,c, while one shaft 40'a is being positioned within the relocating gear and whereby the rollers 30a,k connected to it may be led next to the relocating gear 55a.<br>
For the respective first gear 61a,b,c preferably a self-locking gear is provided, in particular a worm gear. Since in a double-sided spinning frame the rollers 30a,b,c on the two sides have to turn in opposite direction, change of the rotating direction on one side is to be furnished; in the worm gear this can for instance be achieved by matching left-hand and right-hand gear wheel pairs, or by revolving one of the gears 61a by 180Â° over a horizontal turning axis at right angle to the longitudinal extension of the spinning frame. In the latter case it is of advantage to provide the shaft of a motor 60a,b,c at both front ends each with a third gear 63a,b,c.<br>
Figure 7a shows a concept with a single drive motor 60a, which drives all rollers 30a,b,c of the drawing unit, and which also furnishes the energy for the spindles 28. A continuous shaft 24 connects all those third gears 63a,b,c for which the ratio of transmission is to be selected together with the ratio of transmission of the first and second gears 61a, 62a in such a way, so that the driven shafts 40a,b,c rotate with the required speed. According to figure 7a a spindle drive 26 is also connected with the motor 60a, according to the exemplified embodiment via a belt 26a. By means of the spindle drive 26, at least one belt 32 is driven, which delivers driving power to the spindles 28. Preferably the belt 32 is a tangential belt, which runs parallel to a larger number of spindles 28 as is illustrated according to figure 7b. The vertical shaft 24 is preferably located exactly in the centre of the spinning frame, that means between the spindle rows 28 on each side of the spinning frame, and with relation to the longitudinal direction of the spinning frame, approximately between the two front ends of the machine.<br><br>
ne shaft 24 does not need to be one continuous part; several otors as illustrated in figure 1 can also be provided for the rawing unit drive 6 and the spindle drive 26. Additionally it s also possible to connect further auxiliary drives via the entral drive in the middle of the spinning frame, for instance he schematically indicated drive 38 for a ring-traveller-ombination 34 according to figure 7a.<br><br><br>
