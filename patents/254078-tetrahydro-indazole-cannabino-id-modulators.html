CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This present application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application<br>
Serial No. 60/55589O, filed March 24, 2004, which is incorporated herein by reference in<br>
its entirety and for all purposes.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is directed to tetrahydro-indazole cannabinoid (CB) modulator<br>
compounds and a method for use in treating, ameliorating or preventing a cannabinoid<br>
receptor mediated syndrome, disorder or disease.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Before the discovery of the cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors, the term<br>
cannabinoid was used to describe the biologically active components of cannabis sativa,<br>
the most abundant of which are delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol.<br><br>
THC is a moderately potent partial agonist of the CB1 and CB2 receptors and is<br>
considered the "classical cannabinoid," a term now used to refer to other analogues and<br>
derivatives that are structurally related to the tricyclic dibenzopyran THC core. The term<br>
"nonclassical cannabinoid" refers to cannabinoid agonists structurally related to<br>
cannabidiol.<br>
Pharmacological investigations have concentrated on selective CB receptor<br>
modulators of the pyrazole structural class, which include SR 141716A (the<br>
monohydrochloride salt of SR 141716) and SR 144528. SR 141716A was the first potent<br>
and selective CB1 receptor antagonist.<br><br><br>
Pyrazole cannabinoid modulators are one among the many different structural<br>
classes which have aided the development of CB pharmacology, have helped to determine<br>
the biological effects mediated by the cannabinoid receptors, will lead to further<br>
refinement of current compounds and will be a source of new chemical classes in the<br>
future.<br>
Certain compounds (including SR 141716, SR 144528 and the like) that were<br>
originally classified as selective antagonists are now considered to act as "inverse<br>
agonists" rather than pure antagonists. Inverse agonists have the ability to decrease the<br>
constitutive level of receptor activation in the absence of an agonist instead of only<br>
blocking the activation induced by agonist binding at the receptor. The constitutive<br>
activity of CB receptors has important implications since there is a level of continuous<br>
signaling by both CB1 and CB2 even in the absence of an agonist. For example, SR<br>
141716A increases CB1 protein levels and sensitizes cells toward agonist action, thus<br>
indicating that inverse agonists may be another class of ligands used to modulate the<br>
endocannabinoid system and the downstream signaling pathways activated by CB<br>
receptors.<br>
Advances in the synthesis of CB and cannabimimetic ligands have furthered the<br>
development of receptor pharmacology and provided evidence for the existence of<br>
additional cannabinoid receptor sub-types. However, there remains an ongoing need for<br>
the identification and development of CB1 or CB2 receptor cannabinoid modulators for<br>
the treatment of a variety of CB receptor modulated syndromes, disorders and diseases.<br><br>

The present invention includes within its scope prodrugs and metabolites of the<br>
compounds of this invention. In general, such prodrugs and metabolites will be<br>
functional derivatives of the compounds that are readily convertible in vivo into an<br>
active compound.<br>
Thus, in the methods of treatment of the present invention, the term<br>
"administering" shall encompass the means for treating, ameliorating or preventing a<br>
syndrome, disorder or disease described herein with a compound specifically disclosed<br>
or a compound, or prodrug or metabolite thereof, which would obviously be included<br>
within the scope of the invention albeit not specifically disclosed for certain of the<br>
instant compounds.<br>
The term "prodrug" means a pharmaceutically acceptable form of a functional<br>
derivative of a compound of the invention (or a salt thereof), wherein the prodrug may<br>
be: 1) a relatively active precursor which converts in vivo to an active prodrug<br>
component; 2) a relatively inactive precursor which converts in vivo to an active<br>
prodrug component; or 3) a relatively less active component of the compound that<br>
contributes to therapeutic biological activity after becoming available in vivo (i.e., as a<br>
metabolite). Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable<br>
prodrug derivatives are described in, for example, "Design of Prodrugs", ed. H.<br>
Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985.<br>
The term "metabolite" means a pharmaceutically acceptable form of a<br>
metabolic derivative of a compound of the invention(or a salt thereof), wherein the<br>
derivative is a relatively less active component of the compound that contributes to<br>
therapeutic biological activity after becoming available in vivo.<br>
The present invention contemplates compounds of various isomers and mixtures<br>
thereof. The term "isomer" refers to compounds that have the same composition and<br>
molecular weight but differ in physical and/or chemical properties. Such substances<br>
have the same number and kind of atoms but differ in structure. The structural<br>
difference may be in constitution (geometric isomers) or in an ability to rotate the plane<br><br><br>
The term "stereoisomer" refers to isomers of identical constitution that differ in<br>
the arrangement of their atoms in space. Enantiomers and diastereomers are<br>
stereoisomers wherein an asymmetrically substituted carbon atom acts as a chiral<br>
center. The term "chiral" refers to a molecule that is not superposable on its mirror<br>
image, implying the absence of an axis and a plane or center of symmetry. The term<br>
"enantiomer" refers to one of a pair of molecular species that are mirror images of each<br>
other and are not superposable. The term "diastereomer" refers to stereoisomers that<br>
are not related as mirror images. The symbols "R" and "S" represent the configuration<br>
of substituents around a chiral carbon atom(s). The symbols "R*" and "S*" denote the<br>
relative configurations of substituents around a chiral carbon atom(s). .<br>
The term "racemate" or "racemic mixture" refers to a compound of equimolar<br>
quantities of two enantiomeric species, wherein the compound is devoid of optical<br>
activity. The term "optical activity" refers to the degree to which a chiral molecule or<br>
nonracemic mixture of chiral molecules rotates the plane of polarized light.<br>
The term "geometric isomer" refers to isomers that differ in the orientation of<br>
substituent atoms in relationship to a carbon-carbon double bond, to a cycloalkyl ring<br>
or to a bridged bicyclic system. Substituent atoms (other than H) on each side of a<br>
carbon-carbon double bond may be in an E or Z configuration. In the "E" (opposite<br>
sided) or "chair" configuration, the substituents are on opposite sides in relationship to<br>
the carbon- carbon double bond; in the "Z" (same sided) or "boat" configuration, the<br>
substituents are oriented on the same side in relationship to the carbon-carbon double<br>
bond. Substituent atoms (other than H) attached to a carbocyclic ring may be in a cis or<br>
trans configuration. In the "cis" configuration, the substituents are on the same side in<br>
relationship to the plane of the ring; in the "trans" configuration, the substituents are on<br>
opposite sides in relationship to the plane of the ring. Compounds having a mixture of<br>
"cis" and "trans" species are designated "cis/trans". Substituent atoms (other than H)<br>
attached to a bridged bicyclic system may be in an "endo" or "exo" configuration. In<br>
the "endo" configuration, the substituents attached to a bridge (not a bridgehead) point<br>
toward the larger of the two remaining bridges; in the "exo" configuration, the<br>
substituents attached to a bridge point toward the smaller of the two remaining bridges.<br>
It is to be understood that the various substituent stereoisomers, geometric<br>
isomers and mixtures thereof used to prepare compounds of the present invention are<br><br>
 can be prepared synthetically from commercially<br>
available starting materials or can be prepared as isomeric mixtures and then obtained<br>
as resolyed isomers using techniques well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The isomeric descriptors "R," "S," "S*," "R*," "E," "Z," "cis," "trans," "exo"<br>
and "endo" are used as described herein for indicating atom configuration(s) relative to<br>
a core molecule and are intended to be used as defined in the literature (IUPAC<br>
Recommendations for Fundamental Stereochemistry (Section E), PureAppl. Chem.,<br>
1976,45:13-30).<br>
The compounds of the present invention R10 prepared as individual isomers<br>
by either isomer-specific synthesis or resolyed from an isomeric mixture. Conventional<br>
resolution techniques include forming the free base of each isomer of an isomeric pair<br>
using an optically active salt (followed by fractional crystallization and regeneration of<br>
the free base), forming an ester or amide of each of the isomers of an isomeric pair<br>
(followed by chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary) or<br>
resolying an isomeric mixture of either a starting material or a final product using<br>
preparative TLC (thin layer chromatography) or a chiral HPLC column.<br>
Furthermore, compounds of the present invention may have one or more<br>
polymorph or amorphous crystalline forms and as such are intended to be included in<br>
the scope of the invention. In addition, some of the compounds may form solyates with<br>
water (i.e., hydrates) or common organic solyents, and such are also intended to be<br>
encompassed within the scope of this invention.<br>
During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the present<br>
invention, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups<br>
on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by means of conventional<br>
protecting groups, such as those described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry.<br>
ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, Protective<br>
Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991. The protecting groups may be<br>
removed at a convenient subsequent stage using methods known in the art.<br>
Therapeutic Use<br>
CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor<br>
(GCPR) family, a receptor super-family with a distinctive pattern of seven<br>
transmembrane domains, which inhibits N-type calcium channels and /or adenylate<br>
cyclase to inhibit Q-type calcium channels. CB1 receptors are present in the CNS,<br><br>
:" lJpftd6AMatliy»'fei)re®sMln iram regions associated with memory and movement such<br>
as the hippocampus (memory storage), cerebellum (coordination of motor function,<br>
posture and balance), basal ganglia (movement control), hypothalamus (thermal<br>
regulation, neuroendocrine release, appetite), spinal cord (nociception), cerebral cortex<br>
(emesis) and periphery regions such as lymphoid organs (cell mediated and innate<br>
immunity), vascular smooth muscle cells (blood pressure), gastrointestinal tract<br>
(duodenum, ileum and myenteric plexus for emesis control), lung smooth muscle cells<br>
(bronchodilation), eye ciliary body (intraocular pressure). CB2 receptors appear to be<br>
primarily expressed peripherally in lymphoid tissue (cell mediated and innate<br>
immunity), peripheral nerve terminals (peripheral nervous system), spleen immune<br>
cells (immune system modulation) and retina (intraocular pressure) and in the CNS in<br>
cerebellar granule cell mRNA (coordination of motor function). Pharmacological and<br>
physiological evidence also suggests that there may be other cannabinoid receptor<br>
subtypes that have yet to be cloned and characterized.<br>
Where activation or inhibition of a CB receptor appears to mediate various<br>
syndromes, disorders or diseases, potential areas of clinical application include, but are<br>
not limited to, controlling appetite, regulating metabolism, diabetes, reducing<br>
glaucoma-associated intraocular pressure, treating social and mood disorders, treating<br>
seizure-related disorfders, treating substance abuse disorders, enhancing learning,<br>
cognition and memory, controlling organ contraction and muscle spasm, treating<br>
respiratory disorders, treating locomotor activity or movement disorders, treating<br>
immune and inflammation disorders, regulating cell growth, use in pain management,<br>
use as a neuroprotective agent and the like.<br>
Thus, cannabinoid receptor modulators, including the compounds of the<br>
formula (I), (Ia), (Ib) or (Ic) of the present invention, are useful for treating,<br>
ameliorating or preventing a cannabinoid receptor mediated syndrome, disorder or<br>
disease including, but not limited to, controlling appetite, regulating metabolism,<br>
diabetes, glaucoma-associated intraocular pressure, pain, social and mood disorders,<br>
seizure-related disorders, substance abuse disorders, learning, cognition and/or memory<br>
disorders, respiratory disorders, locomotor activity disorders, movement disorders,<br>
immune disorders or inflammation disorders, controlling organ contraction and muscle<br>
spasm, enhancing learning, cognition and/or memory, regulating cell growth, providing<br>
neuroprotection and the like.<br><br>

The term "cannabinoid receptor" refers to any one of the known or heretofore<br><br>
class of cannabinoid receptors that may be bound by a<br>
cannabinoid modulator compound of the present invention; in particular, a cannabinoid<br>
receptor selected from the group consisting of a CB1 receptor and a CB2 receptor. The<br>
term "modulator" further refers to the use of a compound of the invention as a CB<br>
receptor agonist, antagonist or inverse-agonist.<br>
The present invention includes a method for treating, ameliorating or preventing<br>
a CB receptor mediated syndrome, disorder or disease in a subject in need thereof<br>
comprising the step of administering to the subject an effective amount of a compound<br>
of the present invention or composition thereof, wherein the cannabinoid receptor is a<br>
CB 1 or CB2 receptor; and, the compound is an agonist, antagonist or inverse-agonist of<br>
the receptor.<br>
The present invention includes a method for treating, ameliorating or preventing<br>
a CB receptor mediated syndrome, disorder or disease in a subject in need thereof<br>
comprising the step of administering to the subject an effective amount of a compound<br>
of the present invention in a combination product and/or therapy with a therapeutic<br>
agent such as an anticonvulsant or contraceptive agent or composition thereof, wherein<br>
the cannabinoid receptor is a CB1 or CB2 receptor; and, the compound is an agonist,<br>
antagonist or inverse-agonist of the receptor.<br>
It should be understood that contraceptive agents suitable for use in a<br>
combination product and/or therapy are not limited to oral contraceptives, but also<br>
include other commonly available contraceptives such as those that are administered<br>
transdermally, by injection or via implant.<br>
Except as further specified, "combination product and/or therapy" means a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formulae (I), (Ia), (Ib) or (Ic) in<br>
combination with one or more therapeutic agents. The dosages of the compound of<br>
formula (I) and the one or more therapeutic agents are adjusted when combined to<br>
achieve an effective amount.<br>
The term "subject" as used herein, refers to a patient, which may.be an animal,<br>
preferably a mammal, most preferably a human, which has been the object of treatment,<br>
observation or experiment and is at risk of (or susceptible to) developing a CB receptor<br>
mediated syndrome, disorder or disease.<br>
The term "administering" is to be interpreted in accordance with the methods of<br>
the present invention. Such methods include therapeutically or prophylactically<br><br>
"intellective' amount of a composition or medicament of the present<br>
invention at different times during the course of a therapy or concurrently as a product<br>
in a combination form.<br>
Prophylactic administration can occur prior to the manifestation of symptoms<br>
characteristic of a CB receptor mediated syndrome, disorder or disease such that the<br>
syndrome, disorder or disease is treated, ameliorated, prevented or otherwise delayed in<br>
its progression. The methods of the present invention are further to be understood as<br>
embracing all therapeutic or prophylactic treatment regimens used by those skilled in<br>
the art.<br>
The term "effective amount" refers to that amount of active compound or<br>
pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue system,<br>
animal or human, that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor, or<br>
other clinician, which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the syndrome, disorder<br>
or disease being treated. The effective amount of a compound of the invention is from<br>
about 0.001 mg/kg/day to about 300 mg/kg/day.<br>
Wherein the present invention is directed to the administration of a combination<br>
of a compound of formula (I) and an anticonvulsant or contraceptive agent, the term<br>
"effective amount" means that amount of the combination of agents taken together so<br>
that the combined effect elicits the desired biological or medicinal response.<br>
As those skilled in the art will appreciate, the effective amounts of the<br>
components comprising the combination product may be independently optimized and<br>
combined to achieve a synergistic result whereby the pathology is reduced more than it<br>
would be if the components of the combination product were used alone.<br>
For example, the effective amount of a combination product and/or therapy<br>
comprising administration of a compound of formula (I) and topiramate would be the<br>
amount of the compound of formula (I) and the amount of topiramate that when taken<br>
together or sequentially have a combined effect that is effective. Further, it will be<br>
recognized by one skilled in the art that in the case of combination product and/or<br>
therapy with an effective amount, as in the example above, the amount of the<br>
compound of formula (I) and/or the amount of the anticonvulsant (e.g., topiramate)<br>
individually may or may not be effective.<br>
Wherein the present invention is directed to the administration of a combination<br>
product and/or therapy, the instant compound and the anticonvulsant or contraceptive<br><br>
Caferft WapS cB^inMlre'a Sy any suitable means, simultaneously, sequentially or in<br>
a single pharmaceutical composition. Where the instant compound(s) and the<br>
anticonvulsant or contraceptive agent components are administered separately, the<br>
number of dosages of each compound(s) given per day, may not necessarily be the<br>
same, e.g. where one compound may have a greater duration of activity, and will<br>
therefore, be administered less frequently.<br>
The compound(s) of formula (I) and the anticonvulsant(s) or contraceptive<br>
agent(s) may be administered via the same or different routes of administration. The<br>
compound(s) of formula (I) and the anticonvulsant(s) or contraceptive agent(s) may be<br>
administered via the. same or different routes of administration.<br>
Suitable examples of methods of administration are orally, intravenous (iv),<br>
intramuscular (im), and subcutaneous (sc). Compounds may also be administrated<br>
directly to the nervous system including, but not limited to the intracerebral,<br>
intraventricular, intracerebroventricular, intrathecal, intracisternal, intraspinal and/or<br>
peri-spinal routes of administration by delivery via intracranial or intravertebral needles<br>
and/or catheters with or without pump devices.<br>
The compound(s) of formula (I) and the anticonvulsant(s) or contraceptive<br>
agent(s) may be administered according to simultaneous or alternating regimens, at the<br>
same or different times during the course of the therapy, concurrently in divided or<br>
single forms.<br>
Optimal dosages to be administered may be readily determined by those skilled<br>
in the art, and will vary with the particular compound used, the mode of administration,<br>
the strength of the preparation and the advancement of the disease condition. In<br>
addition, factors associated with the particular patient being treated, including patient's<br>
sex, age, weight, diet, time of administration and concomitant diseases, will result in<br>
the need to adjust dosages.<br>
The term "CB receptor mediated syndrome, disorder, or disease" refers to<br>
syndromes, disorders or diseases associated with a biological response mediated by a<br>
CB receptor such that there is discomfort or decreased life expectancy to the organism.<br>
CB receptor mediated syndromes, disorders or diseases can occur in both<br>
animals and humans and include appetite, metabolism, diabetes, obesity, glaucoma-<br>

or limb amputation and the like. Glucose dysregulation includes the inability to make<br>
sufficient insulin (abnormal insulin secretion) and the inability to effectively use insulin<br>
(resistance to insulin action in target organs and tissues). Individuals, suffering from<br>
Type II diabetes mellitus have a relative insulin deficiency. That is, in such<br>
individuals, plasma insulin levels are normal to high in absolute terms, although they<br>
are lower than predicted for the level of plasma glucose that is present.<br>
Type II diabetes mellitus is characterized by the following clinical signs or<br>
symptoms: persistently elevated plasma glucose concentration or hyperglycemia;<br>
polyuria; polydipsia and / or polyphagia; chronic microvascular complications such as<br>
retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy; and macrovascular complications such as<br>
hyperlipidemia and hypertension. These micro-and macro-vascular complications can<br>
lead to blindness, end-stage renal disease, limb amputation and myocardial infarction.<br><br>

The term "composition" refers to a product comprising the specified ingredients<br>
in the specified amounts, as well as any product that results, directly or indirectly, from<br>
combinations of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. The invention<br>
further comprises mixing one or more of the compounds of the invention and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier; and, includes those compositions resulting from<br>
such a process. Contemplated processes include both traditional and modern<br>
pharmaceutical techniques.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may, alternatively or in addition<br>
to a compound of formula (I), (Ia), (Ib) or (Ic), comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salt of a compound of formula (I), (Ia), (Ib) or (Ic) or a prodrug or pharmaceutically<br>
active metabolite of such a compound or salt in admixture with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier.<br>
The term "medicament" refers to a product for use in treating, ameliorating or<br>
preventing a cannabinoid receptor mediated syndrome, disorder or disease.<br>
"Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" means molecular entities and<br>
compositions that are of sufficient purity and quality for use in the formulation of a<br>
composition of the invention and that, when appropriately administered to an animal or<br>
a human, do not produce an adverse, allergic, or other untoward reaction.<br>
Since both clinical and veterinary uses are equally included within me scope of<br><br>
the present invention, a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation would include a<br>
composition or medicament formulation for either clinical or veterinary use.<br>
The present invention includes a process for making the composition or<br>
medicament comprising mixing any of the instant compounds and a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier and include those compositions or medicaments resulting from such<br>
a process. Contemplated processes include both conventional and unconventional<br>
pharmaceutical techniques. Other examples include a composition or medicament<br>
comprising a mixture of at least two of the instant compounds in association with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The composition or medicament may be administered in a wide variety of<br>
dosage unit forms depending on the method of administration; wherein such methods<br>
include (without limitation) oral, sublingual, nasal (inhaled or insufflated), transdermal,<br>
rectal, vaginal, topical (with or without occlusion), intravenous (bolus or infusion) or<br>
for injection (intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intratumorally or<br>
parenterally) using a suitable dosage form well known to those of ordinary skill in the<br>
area of pharmaceutical administration. Accordingly, the term "dosage unit" or "dosage<br>
form" is alternatively used to refer to (without limitation) a tablet, pill, capsule,<br>
solution, syrup, elixir, emulsion, suspension, suppository, powder, granule or sterile<br>
solution, emulsion or suspension (for injection from an ampoule or using a device such<br>
as an auto-injector or for use as an aerosol, spray or drop). Furthermore, the<br>
composition may be provided in a form suitable for weekly or monthly administration<br>
(e.g. as an insoluble salt of the active compound (such as the decanoate salt) adapted to<br>
provide a depot preparation for intramuscular injection).<br>
In preparing a dosage form, the principal active ingredient (such as a compound<br>
of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, racemate, enantiomer, or<br>
diastereomer thereof) is optionally mixed with one or more pharmaceutical carriers<br>
(such as a starch, sugar, diluent, granulating agent, lubricant, glidant, binder,<br>
disintegrating agent and the like), one or more inert pharmaceutical excipients (such as<br>
water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, syrup and<br>
the like), one or more conventional tableting ingredient (such as corn starch, lactose,<br>
sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate, any of a<br>
variety of gums and the like) and a diluent (such as water and the like) to form a<br>
homogeneous composition (whereby the active ingredient is dispersed or suspended<br><br>
evenly throughout the mixture) which may be readily subdivided into dosage units<br>
containing equal amounts of a compound of the present invention.<br>
Binders include, without limitation, starch, gelatin, natural sugars (such as glucose,<br>
beta-lactose and the like), corn sweeteners and natural and synthetic gums (such as acacia,<br>
tragacanth, sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium<br>
acetate, sodium chloride and the like). Disintegrating agents include, without limitation,<br>
starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the like.<br>
Because of the ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent an<br>
advantageous oral dosage unit form, wherein solid pharmaceutical carriers are<br>
employed. If desired, tablets may be sugar or film coated or enteric-coated by standard<br>
techniques. Tablets may also be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a<br>
prolonged therapeutic effect. For example, the dosage form may comprise an inner<br>
dosage and an outer dosage component, whereby the outer component is in the form of<br>
an envelope over the inner component The two components may further be separated<br>
by a layer, which resists disintegration in the stomach (such as an enteric layer) and<br>
permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or a layer which delays<br>
or sustains release. A variety of enteric and nonenteric layer or coating materials may<br>
be used (such as polymeric acids, shellacs, acetyl alcohol, cellulose acetate and the like)<br>
or combinations thereof.<br>
The liquid forms in which a compound of the present invention may be<br>
incorporated for oral administration include (without limitation), aqueous solutions,<br>
suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions (using a suitable synthetic or<br>
natural gum dispersing or suspending agent such as tragacanth, acacia, alginate,<br>
dextran, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone,<br>
gelatin and the like), flavored emulsions (using a suitable edible oil such as cottonseed<br>
oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, peanut oil and the like), elixirs and other similar liquid<br>
forms with a variety of pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles.<br>
As is also known in the art, the compounds may alternatively be administered<br>
parenterally via injection. For parenteral administration, sterile solutions or injectable<br>
suspensions may be parenteral vehicles wherein appropriate liquid carriers, suspending<br>
agents and the like are employed. Sterile solutions are a preferred parenteral vehicle.<br>
Isotonic preparations that generally contain suitable preservatives are employed when<br>
intravenous administration is desired. A parenteral formulation may consist of the active<br><br>
ingredient dissolyed m or mixed with an appropriate inert liquid carrier. Acceptable<br>
liquid carriers comprise aqueous solyents and the like and other optional ingredients for<br>
aiding solubility or preservation. Such aqueous solyents include sterile water, Ringer's<br>
solution or an isotonic aqueous saline solution. Alternatively, a sterile non-volatile oil<br>
may be employed as a solyent agent. Other optional ingredients include vegetable oils<br>
(such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil and the like), organic solyents (such as<br>
solketal, glycerol, formyl and the like), preservatives, isotonizers, solubilizers,<br>
stabilizers, pain-soothing agents and the like. A parenteral formulation is prepared by<br>
. dissolying or suspending the active ingredient in the liquid carrier whereby the final<br>
dosage unit contains from 0.005 to 10% by weight of the active ingredient.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be administered intranasally using a<br>
suitable intranasal vehicle. Compounds of the present invention may be administered<br>
topically using a suitable topical transdermal vehicle or a transdermal patch.<br>
Administration via a transdermal delivery system requires a continuous rather than<br>
intermittent dosage regimen.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may also be administered via a rapid<br>
dissolying or a slow release composition, wherein the composition includes a<br>
biodegradable rapid dissolying or slow release carrier (such as a polymer carrier and<br>
the like) and a compound of the invention. Rapid dissolying or slow release carriers are<br>
well known in the art and are used to form complexes that capture therein an active<br>
compound(s) and either rapidly or slowly degrade/dissolye in a suitable environment<br>
(e.g., aqueous, acidic, basic, etc). Such particles are useful because they<br>
degrade/dissolye in body fluids and release the active compound(s) therein. The<br>
particle size of a compound of the present invention, carrier or any excipient used in<br>

Scheme A<br>
Synthesis of Tetrahydro-Indazole Compounds<br><br>
An optionally substituted cyclohexanone Compound Al in solution (with one or<br>
more of Et2O, THF and the like) is rapidly added to a reagent solution (containing a<br>
mixture of LHMDS and the like in one or more of Et2O or THF and the like) at a<br>
temperature of about -78 °C under an inert atmosphere (using nitrogen and the like)<br>
and stirred at about -78 °C for about 40 mins. An optionally substituted oxalic acid dit-<br>
ethyl ester Compound A2 in solution (with Et2O and the like) is then added to the<br>
Compound Al mixture.<br>
The reaction mixture is stirred at about -78 °C for about 1 hr, then allowed to<br>
warm to r.t. over an additional 2 hr period of time. The reaction is quenched (using<br>
saturated NH4C1, lN HC1 and the like) and the organic layer is extracted (with one or<br>
more of EtOAc, Et2O and the like) and washed (with brine and the like), then separated<br>
and dried (with anhydrous sodium sulfate and the like). The extract is filtered and<br>
concentrated in vacuo to yield an optionally substituted oxo-(2-oxo-cyclohexyl)-acetic<br>
acid alkyl ester Compound A3 as a crude product used without further purification in<br>
the next step.<br><br><br>
A substituted hydrazine hydrochloride Compound A4 and K2CO3 (potassium<br>
carbonate) are added to Compound A3 in solution (with one or more of MeOH, EtOH,<br>
CH2Cl2 and the like) at room temperature under an inert atmosphere. The reaction<br>
mixture is stirred overnight, then concentrated and diluted (with one or more of water,<br>
EtOAc (ethyl acetate) and the like). The organic layer is washed, separated and dried,<br>
then filtered and concentrated in vacuo to yield a crude product Compound A5 as a<br>
mixture of isomers, wherein a mixture of X1R1 and X2R2 isomers are present. The<br>
XaRa substituent moiety on Compound A4 represents the possibility that, after<br>
separation, the substituted amine group may be found either on the N1 position as X1R1<br>
or on the N2 position as X2R2.<br>
The hydrazine hydrochloride or dihydrochloride Compound A4 may be<br>
converted to the free base by methods known to those skilled in the art. In the<br>
examples of the present invention, the free base is prepared either in situ (as shown for<br>
illustrative purposes in this Scheme) or separately (then added to the reaction mixture)<br>
by reaction with K2CO3.<br>
As illustrated in this Scheme, Compound A4 may also be further substituted<br>
with a variety of XaRa substituents (as previously defined herein). In many instances,<br>
the substituted hydrazine Compound A4 is commercially available. When not<br>
commercially available, a particularly substituted Compound A4 may be prepared by<br>
methods known to those skilled in the art. More specifically, a halogenated XaRa<br>
substituent moiety is reacted with a hydrazine hydrate solution at reflux and used<br>
without further purification as Compound A4 (as described more completely in<br>
Example 3).<br><br><br>
The Compound A5 isomeric mixture is separated via flash chromatography<br>
(eluted with a suitable solyent mixture such as 20% or 30% EtOAc:hexane and the like)<br>
to provide a purified major isomer Compound A6 and a minor isomer Compound A7.<br>
The major isomer Compound A6 is substituted on the N1 position with X[R| (X2R2 is<br>
necessarily absent). The minor isomer Compound A7 is substituted on the N2 position<br>
with X2R2 (wherein XiR[ is absent).<br><br>
The separated major isomer Compound A6 is treated with a reagent solution<br>
(such as a mixture of NaOH in a solyent such as THF or water and the like) and stirred<br>
overnight. The reaction is quenched and extracted with a solyent (such as CH2Cl2,<br>
EtOAc and the like). The organic layer is dried, filtered and concentrated in vacuo to<br>
yield Compound A8.<br><br>
A reagent (such as SOCl2 (thionyl chloride) and the like) in a solyent (such as<br>
CH2Cl2 and the like) is added to Compound A8 at ambient temperature under an inert<br>
nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture is stirred at reflux temperature for about 15<br>
min, then concentrated in vacuo to afford the corresponding acid chloride intermediate<br>
Compound A9.<br><br>
Compound A9 (optionally in solution with TEA (triethylamine) and the like) is<br>
added to a solution of a substituted amine Compound A10 (in a solyent such as CH2Cl2<br>
and the like) at ambient temperature under an inert nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
In general, Compound A10 is a commercially available substituted amine.<br><br>
When not commercially available, a particularly substituted amine Compound A10 .<br>
may be prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The Compound A9/A10 mixture is stirred at about r.t. for a period of time, then<br>
diluted (with a mixture of water and CH2Cl2 and the like). The organic layer is<br>
separated and dried, then filtered and concentrated in vacuo to yield a crude product.<br>
The product is purified via flash chromatography (eluted with a solyent mixture such as<br>
20% or 30% EtOAc in hexane) to provide a target Compound All.<br>
For purposes of illustration in this Scheme, the Compound All X3R3<br>
substituent moiety incorporates the C(O) portion of the C3 substituent from Compound<br>
A9 and the -NH- portion from Compound A1O, wherein X3 is absent and R3 is either<br>
-(R6)C(O)Z1R7 or -(R6)C(O)N(R9a)Z2R9, and wherein R6 is absent.<br><br>
A catalytic amount of tetrabutylammonium bromide ((«-Bu)4NBr) is added to a<br>
solution of Compound A9 (in a solyent such as DCE (dichloroethane) and the like) at<br>
0°C. A saturated solution of NaN3 (sodium azide) (in water) is added dropwise at 0°C.<br>
The reaction mixture is stirred for about 0.5 hrs, then diluted (with one or more of cold<br>
water, CH2Cl2 and the like). The organic layer is washed (with one or more of water,<br>
brine and the like) and dried (using sodium sulfate), then filtered and concentrated to<br>
give an azide Compound Bl.<br><br>
f-BuOH (tert-butmol) is added to a solution of Compound Bl (in a solyent such<br>
as CH2Cl2 and the like) and the mixture is refluxed for about 48 hrs. The reaction<br>
product is concentrated and purified via silica gel column (eluted with a solyent<br>
mixture such as 10% EtOAc in hexane) to give a Boc-protected amine Compound B2.<br><br><br>
TFA is added to a solution of Compound B2 (in a solyent such as CH2Cl2 and<br>
the like) and the mixture is stirred overnight. The reaction product is concentrated and<br>
the residue is dissolyed (in a solyent such as CH7Cl2 and the like) and washed (with one<br>
or more of IN NaOH, water and the like) and dried (using sodium sulfate), then filtered<br>
and concentrated to give an amine Compound B3.<br><br>
Compound B3 (optionally in solution with TEA and the like) is added to a<br>
solution of a substituted amine Compound B4 (in a solyent such as CH2Q2 and the<br>
like) at ambient temperature under an inert nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture is stirred<br>
at r.t. for about 4 hrs, then concentrated and purified via silica gel column (eluted with a ■<br>
solyent mixture such as 15%, 20% or 30% EtOAc in hexane) to provide the target<br>
Compound All.<br>
For purposes of illustration in this Scheme, the Compound All X3R3<br>
substituent moiety incorporates the NH portion of the C3 substituent from Compound<br>
B3 and the RYC(O)- portion from Compound B4, wherein X3 is a -NH- and R3 is either<br>
-(R6)C(O)Z,R7, -SO2N(R8)R8a, or -(R6)C(O)N(R9a)Z2R9, and wherein R6 is absent.<br>

Biological Examples<br>
The following examples illustrate that the compounds of the present invention<br>
are CB receptor modulators useful for treating, ameliorating or preventing a<br>
cannabinoid receptor mediated syndrome, disorder or disease in a subject in need<br>
thereof.<br>
Example 1<br>
Binding Assay for CB1 or CB2 Agonists or Inverse Agonists<br>
The human CB1 and CB2 receptors were stably expressed in SK-N-MC cells<br>
transfected with pcDNA3 CB-1 (human) or pcDNA3 CB-2 (human). The cells were<br>
grown in T-180 cell culture flasks under standard cell culture conditions at 37 °C in a 5%<br>
CO2 atmosphere. The cells were harvested by trysinization and homogenized in a<br>
homogenization buffer (10 mM Tris, 0.2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM KC1, with protease inhibitors<br>
aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A and bacitracin) and centrifuged (2000 g). The supernatant<br>
was then centrifuged in 2M sucrose (31,300 g) to produce a semi-purified membrane<br>
pellet. The pellet was resuspended in homogenization and store at -80 °C.<br>
• On the day of the assay, the pellet was thawed on ice and diluted in assay buffer<br>
(50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mg/mL fatty acid free bovine<br>
serum albumin, pH 7.5). The diluted membrane was added with buffer, test compound<br>
or standard and the radioligand [H]3+-CP-55,940_(0.2 nM) to the wells of a 96-well<br>
polypropylene plate. Non-specific binding was measured in wells containing 10 uM<br>
WIN 55,212. The plate was covered and incubated for 90 minutes at 30 °C. The<br>
contents were then aspirated onto a Packard Unifilter GF/C filter bottom plate prewet<br>
with 0.5% polyethyleneimine. The wells of the polypropylene plate were rinsed and<br>
aspirated seven times with a 0.9% saline-0.5% Tween 20 solution. The Unifilter plate<br>
was dried, a scintillation cocktail was added to each well and the counts representing<br>
binding were quantitated in a TopCount scintillation counter.<br><br>
The IC50 binding values for compounds tested were calculated by linear regression<br>
and were obtained from studies in which varying compound concentrations were used.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 2<br>
Functional Cell-Based Assay for CB1 or CB2 Agonist and Inverse Agonist Effects on<br>
Intra-Cellular Adenylate Cyclase Activity<br>
The CB1 and CB2 receptors are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) which<br>
influence cell function via the Gi-protein. These receptors modulate the activity of<br>
intracellular adenylate cyclase which in turn produces the intracellular signal messenger<br>
cyclic-AMP (cAMP).<br>
At baseline, or during non-ligand bound conditions, these receptors are<br>
constitutively active and tonically suppress adenylate cyclase activity. The binding of<br>
an agonist causes further receptor activation and produces additional suppression of<br><br>
 adenylate cyclase activity.The binding of an inverse agonist inhibits the constitutive<br>
activity of the receptors and results in an increase in adenylate cyclase activity.<br>
By monitoring intracellular adenylate cyclase activity, the ability of compounds<br>
to act as agonists or inverse agonists can be determined.<br>
ASSAY<br>
Test compounds were evaluated in SK-N-MC cells which, using standard<br>
transfection procedures, were stably transfected with human cDNA for pcDNA3-CRE β-<br>
gal and pcDNA3 CB1 receptor (human) or pcDNA3 CB2 receptor (human). By<br>
expressing CRE P-gal, the cells produced P-galactosidase in response to CRE promoter<br>
activation by cAMP. Cells expressing CRE P-gal and either the human CB1 or CB2<br>
receptor will produce less β-galactosidase when treated with a CB1/CB2 agonist and will<br>
produce more P-galactosidase when treated with a CB1/CB2 inverse agonist.<br>
CELL GROWTH<br>
The cells were grown in 96-well plates under standard cell culture conditions at 37<br>
°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 3 days, the media was removed and a test compound in<br>
media (wherein the media was supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 1M sodium<br>
pyruvate, 0.1% low fatty acid FBS (fetal bovine serum) and antibiotics) was added to the<br>
cell. The plates were incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C and the plate cells were then<br>
treated with forskolin over a 4-6 hour period, then washed and lysed. The P-galactosidase<br>
activity was quantitated using commercially available kit reagents (Promega Corp.<br>
Madison, WI) and a Vmax Plate R6ader (Molecular Devices, Inc).<br>
CB1 RECEPTOR MEDIATED CHANGE IN CRE P-GAL EXPRESSION (TABLE 2A &amp; 2B)<br>
For cells expressing CRE P-gal and the CB1 receptor, CB1 agonists reduced β-<br>
galactosidase activity in a dose-dependent manner and CB1 inverse agonists increased<br>
p-galactosidase activity in a dose-dependent manner.<br>
The change in P-galactosidase activity was determined by setting a vehicle<br>
treated cell's activity value at 100% and expressing the P-galactosidase activity<br>
measured in a corresponding compound treated cell as a percent of the vehicle treated<br>
cell activity.<br>
CB 1 Receptor Results<br>
The EC50 values for compounds tested were calculated by linear regression and<br>
were obtained from studies in which varying compound concentrations were used.<br><br><br>
CB2 RECEPTOR MEDIATED CHANGE IN CRE Β-GAL EXPRESSION (TABLE 2C &amp; 2D)<br>
For cells expressing CRE |3-gal and the CB2 receptor, CB2 agonists reduced |3-<br>
galactosidase activity in a dose-dependent manner and CB2 inverse agonists increased<br>
P-galactosidase activity in a dose-dependent manner.<br>
The change in P-galactosidase activity was determined by setting a vehicle<br>
treated cell's activity value at 100% and expressing the β-galactosidase activity<br>
measured in a corresponding compound treated cell as a percent of the vehicle treated<br>
cell activity.<br>
CB2 Receptor Binding Results<br>
The EC50 values for compounds tested were calculated by linear regression and<br>
were obtained from studies in which varying compound concentrations were used.<br><br><br><br>
