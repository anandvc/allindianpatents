The Patent Act, 1970 (39 of 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION <br>
(Section   10;   Rule   13)<br>
"STEAM HEATED MAWA MAKING<br>
MACHINE <br>
MR. UDAY NARAYAN KHARE (Indian National) having address at B-3, Harish Industrial Compound, Next To Atmaram Nagar, Penkar Pada, Near Dashisar Checknaka, Mira Road (East), Thane - 401 104, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention &amp; the manner in which it is performed:<br><br>
- .2 MAY 2005<br><br>
The present invention relates to a product which is a 'Steam Heated Mawa Making Machine-for commercial scale manufacturing of milk sweets mawa / khoa (concentrated milk solids) making machine Which saves fuel and manpower as compared to existing traditional kadai-bhatti method of manufacturing and also gives better hygienic and consistency of finished product.<br>
Description of prior arts:<br>
The traditional method of making milk sweets is direct heating method in which Kadai - bhatti is used. In which milk is allow to heat in low flame for very long time until the liquid changes into semi solid form i.e. (milk-sweet). However the conventional method have many disadvantages. Some of them are mentioned below:-<br>
The conventional method consumes high fuel due to dissipate of heat to atmospheric air.<br>
In conventional method, stirring of milk is done manually which revert into nonÂ¬uniform stirring.<br>
Conventional method gives excessive strain and fatigue to the operator.<br>
Low productivity and high power consumption of the set up.<br>
Operation of conventional method is unsanitary. Uncontrolled manual heating affects quality of finished product adversely.<br>
2 MAY 2005<br><br>
Objects of the invention:-<br>
The present invention "Steam heated tilting type bottom driven Mawa / Khoa making machine" is developed with a goal to overcome the disadvantages of the traditional method of similar method having non tilting vessel with top driven stirrer and provide better alternative.<br>
The first objective of the present invention is to provide easy removal of the finished product by tilting the vessel using turning union.<br>
The other objective of the present invention is to provide quick, fine and early controlled heating of milk.<br>
The present invention provide 40 to 50% of fuel saving.<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide choice of stirrer speed by using two speed motor for stirrer. The present invention should be hygienic for health<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION:<br>
 The machine is a triple-wall construction machine having innermost vessel made out of  stainless steel, a torispherical-dished 5 mm thick welded to conical shell 3mm which is made up stainless steel plate. In which milk will be evaporated in open to atmosphere condition by means of bottom driven stirrer. Intermediate shell is made out of stainless steel plate 5mm thick and steam is supplied within the cavity of this heating jacket and inner shell. The heating jacket is covered with ceramic blanket and glass wool insulation material and cladded with magnetic stainless steel thin sheet of 1.2 mm thickness.<br><br>
 The present invention "steam heated tilting type bottom driven mawa / khoa (concentrated milk solid) making machine" will now be explained in detail with the     help of figure 1 of accompanying drawing.<br>
Spring Lock Nut: - Its purpose is for locking and adjusting the spring pressure on stirrer (1).<br>
Spring and spring cup: - It's for spring action stirrer (2).<br>
Stirrer support pipe: - This pipe is for spring stirring and it provides support to stirrer (3).<br>
Shell: - In shell milk will be evaporated in open to atmosphere condition by means of a bottom driven stirrer. Due to conical shell enhance evaporation rate (4).<br>
Inner dish: it is handling milk for process (5).<br>
Steam inlet nozzle: it is fitted in the steam pipe line on the right hand side of the machine for supplying steam for evaporation of milk (6).<br>
Turning union: it is for tilting the kettle to remove the finish product (7).<br><br>
High pressure flexible hose pipe: it is for condensate line, the condensate goes to<br>
strainer through hose pipe (8).<br>
Steam trap: it is for trapping steam and releasing condensate from jacket (9). Top pipe cap with oil seal: to keep away water from taper roller bearing (10). Taper roller bearing: It provides support to shaft (11).<br><br><br>
4<br><br>
 Center pipe: it provide support to stirrer shaft and taper roller bearing (12).<br>
Center shaft: it is for holding and rotating stirrer (13).<br>
Jacket : it is heating inner vessel, which cover the milk contain in vessel (14).<br>
Stand : it is for supporting and holding kettle (15).<br>
Gear box: it is for driving stirrer (16).<br>
Electric Motor: this motor is 3-phase dual speed motor having rating. 1HP/440V RPM 910-1440, it is driving stirrer assembly through gearbox (17)<br>
Insulation cladding: - for covering insulation material (18).<br>
The machine is designed to handle maximum 20 lits of fresh / chilled raw milk is to be added in the machine, after locking, the turning mechanism. Using the on/off selector switch power to be supplied to the^ 3 phase geared motor, which will rotate the stirrer. By openingjhe steam-supply valve fitted in the steam pipeline on the right hand^side "of machiife steam is to be supplied in such a way that the pressure gauge fitted on the machine shows max. 4.0 kg/ cm2. Now by opening an air release valve on left hand side of the machine air in the pipeline and jacket is to be removed and this valve to be closed boiling once steam starts coming out of this valve. After sometime say 10 min from starts, milk gets converted to thick pasty material similar to condensed milk. Heating is continued further and changing the selector switch from position 1 to position 2 reduces speed of the stirrer.<br>
After laps of 30 min. of start up the whole milk is reduced to granular, thick, semisolid, consistency, which is called as Mawa (Khoa).<br><br>
Now the supply of steam is stopped, steam in the heating jacket is vented off and stirrer is stopped. The lock of fitting device is open and machine is tilted toward the operator slowly in such way that the mawa inside machine is slowly unloaded thought the spout of the machine in the stainless steel container / tray.<br>
On complete removal of the contains the machine is turned back to its, original vertical alignment, turning union is put on, steam is supplied and next batch is manufactured following the process out lined above.<br>
Advantages of the invention :-<br>
Advantages of present invention over traditional method. Low fuel consumption. High heat transfer co-efficient. Motorized stirring.<br>
High productivity and low power consumption of the set up. Sanitary operation.<br>
Better heat control over entire process gives quality product. User friendly machine.<br>
ADVANTAGES:<br>
However  the  present  invention  have  many  advantages   over  conventional method. Some of which are mentioned below :<br>
The present invention consume low fuel. It has high heat transfer co-efficient. It has motorized stirring.<br>
High productively and low power consumption of the set up. It is hygienic for health.<br>
It gives better heat control over entire process gives quality product.<br><br><br><br>
