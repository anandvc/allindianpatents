				<td>Field 'of Industrial Utilization<br>
The present invention relates to a bicycle auxiliary shift control device that can be mounted on a bicycle handlebar; Co a bicycle main shift control device that can be mounted on a handlebar separately from an auxiliary shift control device, that can be linked to an auxiliary shift control device via two control cables, and that can be linked to a gear shifter via a shift cable  and to a bicycle shift control system comprising these.<br><br>
A bicycle handlebar comprises a main bar and extension bars that are installed in order to afford a different handle position from that of the main bar. Brake levers or shift levers are mounted at the ends of the main bar.  In particular, with mountain bikes used in cross country races, extension bars called bar ends are mounted integrally or   on the ends of the straight main bar in order to afford a plurality of handle positions. With road bikes, which are used in triathlons and time trial races, extension bars called DH bars are mounted in the center of the main bar so that the rider can maintain a posture with less atr resistance.<br>
 	Bar ends are rod-shaped members mounted integrally or separately,<br>
facing forward and slightly upward, at the ends of the main bar such that they intersect the main bar. Bar ends such as these are often used in order to vary the handle position when climbing a hill or cruising over a flat stretch, for example. DH bars, meanwhile, are rod-shaped members mounted in the center of a drop-type main bar so that they face forward and slightly upward and have a space between them.         However, when extension bars mounted in this manner are used, the hands are away from the shift levers located at the ends.  Therefore, every time a shift is to be made, the hand must be returned to one of the shift levers at the ends of the main bar, and it is difficult to make a quick shift while gripping the extension bars.<br>
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Applications 8-183491 and 8-183492 disclose shift control systems that allow the shift levers to be operated from two grip positions in order to allow shift operations to be carried out in two handle positions.    With the shift control system disclosed in the former application, a main shift control device and an auxiliary shift control device are arranged in series with a derailleur or other such gear shifter, and a shift cable from the auxiliary shift control device is linked in the middle of a shift cable connected from the main shift control device to the gear shifter.  Each of the two shift control devices comprises a winder that winds the shift cable, a positioning mechanism for positioning the winder, and a shift lever for operating the winder.<br>
 	The shift control system disclosed in the latter application is designed<br>
such that the auxiliary shift lever and the main shift lever of the main shift control<br>
device are linked by a push-pull control cable and thereby work in conjunction.  The<br>
main shift control device comprises a winder that winds the shift cable, a positioning<br>
mechanism for positioning the winder, and a main shift lever for operating the winder.<br>
 	With the shift control system disclosed in the former application, one of<br>
the shift control devices is installed on the extension bar, and the other shift control device is installed on the main handlebar, which allows shift control to be carried out<br><br>
from two handle positions. With the shift control system disclosed in the latter application, one of the shift levers is installed on the extension bar, and the other shift lever is installed on the main handlebar, which again allows shift control to be carried out from two handle positions.<br>
Problems Which the Invention is Intended to Solve<br>
With the conventional shift control system disclosed in the former application,<br>
since two shift cables that are linked in the middle are connected to the gear shifter, it<br>
is impossible to make a shift with one of the shift levers in a state in which the other<br>
shift lever has been operated and the shift cable wound.  Consequently, when a shift is<br>
made with one, the shift cable of the other shift control device always has to be played<br>
out first, which makes the shifting operation troublesome.<br>
 	With the conventional shift control system disclosed in the latter<br>
application, the above problem is not encountered because there is one winder for the shift cable, and the two shift levers work in conjunction. However, there is one shift Jever fon each bar] with Che above-mentioned conventional shift control system, and furthermore the control position of the shift lever varies with the position setting of the winder. Accordingly, one of the shift levers has to be operated at a different position according to the shift step, making it difficult for shifts to be made easily and reliably in two handle positions.<br>
        An object of the present invention is to allow shift control to be carried out easily and reliably from two handle positions.<br><br>
Means Used to Solve the Above-Mentioned Problems<br>
The bicycle auxiliary shift control device pertaining to invention 1 is a device which can be mounted on a bicycle handlebar, which can be linked via two control cables to a main shift control device capable of two shift operations that each actuate the gear shifter in a different shift direction according to the operation from the starting position, and which can be mounted to the handlebar separately from the main shift control device, comprising an auxiliary control bracket, a rotary controller, and a return means.  The auxiliary control bracket can be mounted to the handlebar.  The rotary controller is rotatably provided to the auxiliary control bracket, is linked to the main shift control device via the two control cables, and selectively actuates one of the<br><br>
two control cables by rotation. The return means returas the rotary controller to a specific rotational position.<br>
 	One of the control cables is actuated when the rotary controller is rotated<br>
by a specific amount in a state in which, for example, this auxiliary shift control device<br>
has been mounted to the extension bars of the handlebar, and the main shift control<br>
device has been mounted to the main bar of the handlebar. The main shift control<br>
device linked to the actuated control cable is then actuated in one of the shift directions,<br>
and a gear shift is made. Since this main shift control device actuates the gear shifter<br>
in one of the shift directions by operation from the respective starting position,<br>
regardless of the shift direction, shift control by the rotary controller may always be<br>
performed from the specific rotational position, irrespective of the shift step.  Once the<br>
shift control is finished, the rotary controller is returned to the specific rotational<br>
position by the return means.  A shift control by this auxiliary shift control device can<br>
therefore be executed easily and reliably. A shift control can also be executed easily<br>
and reliably when the main shift control device is operated, since the operation will<br>
similarly be from the starting position, irrespective of the shift step.  Therefore, shift<br>
control can be executed easily and reliably from two handle positions.<br>
 	The bicycle auxiliary shift control device pertaining to invention 2 is the<br>
device defined in invention 1, wherein the rotary controller has a first control lever member that can be rotated from a first position and that includes a first cable stopping component for stopping one of the control cables linked to the main shift controi device, and a second control lever member that can be rotated from a second position and that includes a second cable stopping component for stopping the other of the control cables linked to the main shift control device; and wherein the return means has a first energization means for returning the first control lever member to the first position, and a second energization means for returning the second control lever member to the second position.  In this case, when the first control lever member is rotated from the first position, control in one shift direction will be performed by the main shift control device linked to one of the control cables.  When this control is complete, the first control lever member is returned to the first posiuon by the first energization means.  The main shift control device also returns to its starting position. When the second control lever member is rotated from the second position, control in the other shift direction is performed by the main shift control device linked to the other control cable.   When this control is complete, the second control lever member is returned to the second position by the second energization means.  The main shift control device also returns to its starting position.  Here, the shift control is easier since<br><br>
it is performed in one shift direction or the other from each position by the two control levers, just as with the main shift control device.<br>
 	The bicycle auxiliary shift control device pertaining to invention 3 is the<br>
device defined in invention 1, wherein the two control lever members are able to rotate in the same direction from two positions. In this case, since the two control levers rotate in the same direction, shift control can be executed in two shift directions by the same actuation with one finger in a state in which the extension bars are gripped, for example.<br>
The bicycle auxiliary shift control device pertaining to invention 4 is the device defined in invention 1, wherein the rotary controller has a third control lever member that can be rotated in both directions from a specific position and that has a third cable stopping component that is used to stop one of the control cables linked to the main shift control device, and a rotational member that has a fourth cable stopping component that is used to stop the other of the control cables linked to the main shift control device, and that only rotates in conjunction with the rotation of the third control lever member in one direction; and wherein the return means has a third energization means for returning the rotational member, after it has rotated in the one direction, to the specific position along with the third control lever member, and a fourth energization means for returning the third control lever member, after it has rotated in the other direction, to the specific position.  In this case, the shift control is easier because it can be executed by the rotary controller through actuation of a single control lever member one way and the other.<br>
 	The bicycle auxiliary shift control device pertaining to invention 5 is the<br>
device defined in invention 1, wherein the rotational member has a fourth control lever member that can be rotated in both directions from a specific position, a first rotational member that has a fifth cable stopping component for stopping one of the control cables linked to the main shift control device, and that only rotates in conjunction with the rotation of the fourth control lever member in one direction, and a second rotational member that has a sixth cable stopping component for stopping the other of the control cables linked to the main shift control device, and that only rotates in conjunction with the rotation of the fourth control lever member in the other direction; and wherein the return means has a fifth energization means for returning the first rotational member, after it has rotated in the one direction, to the specific position along with the fourth control lever member, and a sixth energization means for returning the second rotational member, after it has rotated in the other direction, to the specific position along with the fourth control lever member.  Here again, the shift control is easier<br><br>
because it can be executed by the rotary controller through actuation of a single control lever member one way and the other.<br>
 	The bicycle auxiliary shift control'device pertaining to invention 6 is the<br>
device defined in any of inventions 2 to 5, wherein the two control cables each comprise an inner cable and an outer casing that guides the inner cable; the two cable stopping components each stop one of the inner cables; and the auxiliary control bracket has a first stopping component that stops the two outer casings. In this case, when the lever member is rotated, the inner cable moves through the inside of the outer casing, which is stopped at both ends, and a gear shift is made by the main shift control device in conjunction with this movement. Here, since the gear shift is made by the movement of the inner cable through the outer casing that is stopped at both ends, the length of the control cable can be set freely, and the routing of the control cable is easier.<br>
 	The bicycle auxiliary shift control device pertaining to invention 7 is the<br>
device defined in invention 2, wherein the two control lever components are capable of rotating in respectively different directions from two positions.  In this case, the rotational direction and finger usage can be made the same in the control lever member and the main shift control device, so shift control is easier.<br>
The bicycle auxiliary shift control device pertaining to invention 8 is the device defined in invention 7, wherein the two control cables each comprise an inner cable and an outer casing that guides the inner cable, the first cable stopping component stops the inner cable of one of the control cables, the second cable stopping component stops the outer casing of the other of the control cables, and the auxiliary control bracket has a second stopping component that stops the outer casing of one of the control cables and the inner cable of the other of the control cables.  In this case, when the first control lever member is rotated, the inner cable moves through the inside of the control cable outer casing, which is stopped at both ends, and a gear shift is made by the main shift control device linked thereto.  Also, when the second control lever member is rotated in a different direction from that of the first control lever member, the outer casing stopped by the second control lever member is pressed, the inner cable moves through the inside, and a gear shift is made by the main shift control device linked thereto. Here, the routing of the control cables is easier because the direction of rotation of the main shift control device and the two control lever members can be made the same when the main shift control device and the control lever members are rotated in different directions.<br><br>
 	The bicycle main shift control device pertaining to invention 9 is a<br>
device which can be mounted on a bicycle handlebar separately from an auxiliary shift control device that can be mounted on the handlebar, and which can be linked via two control cables to the auxiliary shift control device and can be linked via a shift cable to a gear shifter, comprising a main control bracket and a shift control means.  The main control bracket can be mounted to the handlebar.  The shift control means is provided to the main control bracket, is capable of two shift operations which each actuate the gear shifter in a different shift direction according to the operation from the starting position, and is able to stop the two control cables.<br>
 	With this main shift control device, because the two control cables can<br>
be stopped by the shift control means, if the auxiliary shift control device is linked via the control cables, then shift control can be executed by operation from the respective starting positions, and shift control can be executed easily and reliably from two handle positions.<br>
The bicycle main shift control device pertaining to invention 10 is the device defined in invention 9, wherein the shift control means comprises a winder that is rotatably supported by the main control bracket, and that winds the shift cable, a positioning means for setting the rotational position of the winder in stages according to the winding length of the shift cable, a first shift control component that is rotatably supported by the main control bracket, that stops one of the control cables, and that controls the winder such that it rotates in the winding direction, a release means for releasing the setting of the rotational position of the winder by the positioning means, a second shift control component that is rotatably supported by the main control bracket, that stops the other of the control cables, and that controls the release means, and an energization means for energizing the winder in the opposite direction from the winding direction.<br>
 	In this case, when the first shift control component is rotated, the winder<br>
rotates in the winding direction and takes up the shift cable.  This rotational position is set in stages by the positioning means.  As a result, the gear shifter executes shift control in one shift direction. When the second shift control component is rotated, the positioning is released by the release means, and the winder rotates in the direction in which it is energized by the energization means, which is the opposite direction from the winding direction.   As a result, the shift cable is played out from the winder, and shift control in the other shift direction is executed by the gear shifter.  When the auxiliary shift control device is operated, one of the control cables is actuated, and shift control is executed by the shift control means at which this control cable is stopped.<br><br>
 	Here, because of the provision of a stopping component that stops one of<br>
the two control cables to the two shift control components provided in order to execute shift control easily and reliably in both shift directions, remote control of the shift control components can be performed by the auxiliary shift control device, allowing shift control to be executed easily and reliably from two handle positions.<br>
The bicycle main shift control device pertaining to invention 11 is the device<br>
defined in invention 10, wherein the first shift control component and the second shift<br>
control component are supported on the main control bracket such that they rotate in<br>
different directions and rotate at nearby positions. In this case, since the rotational<br>
direction varies with the shift direction, there are fewer instances of accidental<br>
operation, and shift control can be executed more reliably and easily.<br>
 	The bicycle main shift control device pertaining to invention 12 is the<br>
device defined in invention 10 or 11, wherein the two control cables each comprise an inner cable and an outer casing that guides the inner cable, the two shift control components each have a cable stopping corhponent that stops one of the inner cables, and the main control bracket has two outer stopping components that stop the two outer casings.  In this case, when the auxiliary shift control device is actuated, the inner cable moves through the inside of the outer casing, which is stopped at both ends, and a gear shift is made by the shift control means linked thereto.  Here, since the shift control is executed by the movement of the inner cable through the outer casing that is stopped at both ends, the length of the control cable can be set freely, and the routing of the control cable is easier.<br>
 	The bicycle shift control system pertaining to invention 13 comprises a<br>
main shift control device, an auxiliary shift control device, and two control cables. The main shift control device is capable of two shift operations for actuating the gear shifter in respectively different shift directions, and can be mounted to a bicycle handlebar.  The auxiliary shift control device has a rotary controller for controlling the main shift control device, and can be mounted on the handlebar separately from the main shift control device.   The two control cables link the rotary controller with the main shift control device.  With this shift control system, when one of the control cables is actuated by the rotational operation of the rotary controller, a gear shift is made in one direction by the main shift control device linked thereto.  When the other control cable is actuated, a gear shift is made in the other direction by the main shift control device linked thereto.  Further, when the main shift control device is operated, a gear shift is made in one direction or the other.  Here, since shift control c^ be executed in one direction at a time from either the rotary controller or the main shift<br><br>
control device, shift control can be executed easily and reliably from two handle<br>
positions.<br>
 	The bicycle shift control system pertaining to invention 14 is the system<br>
defined in invention 15 [sic], wherein the main shift control device is the device<br>
defined in any of inventions 9 to 12.<br>
The bicycle shift control system pertaining to invention 15 is the system defined in invention 13 or 14, wherein the auxiliary shift control device is the device defined in any of inventions 1 to 8.<br>
Embodiments of the invention<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
In Figure 1, main shift control devices lOf and lOr pertaining to an embodiment of the present invention are mounted on both ends of a main bar 12 that extends to the left and right of a handlebar 11. In addition to the main shift control devices lOf and lOr, grips 13 are mounted to the outside thereof on the main bar 12.   Bar ends 14 that make up part of the handlebar 11 are mounted to the outside of the grips 13. The bar ends 14 are mounted facing forward and upward on the ends of the main bar 12. The main bar 12 is attached to the distal end of a stem 18. The base end of the stem 18 is mounted to the upper end of a suspension fork 15 such that it sandwiches the head component 17 at the distal end of a bicycle frame 16.<br>
 	Auxiliary shift control devices 20f and 20r that are used for the remote<br>
operation of the front and rear main shift control devices lOf and lOr are mounted to the distal ends of the bar ends 14. These auxiliary shift control devices 20f and 20r are linked to the main shift control devices lOf and lOr by two control cables 21a and 2Ib, respectively.<br>
As shown in Figures 2 through 4, the main shift control devices lOf and lOr are<br>
brake iever-integrated types, and are mounted underneath the main bar 12 via brake<br>
brackets 22 that swingably support the brake levers 12. The main shift control<br>
device lOr, which used for rear shifts, will be described below.<br>
 	As shown in Figures 5 and 6, the main shift control device lOr<br>
comprises a main control bracket 30 that is formed integrally with a brake bracket 22; a winder 31 that is positioned in the interior of the main control bracket 30 and is rotatably supported by the main control bracket 30; a positioning mechanism 32 for setting the rotational position of the winder 31 in stages; a first shift lever 33 that is<br><br>
used to operate the winder 31 rotationally; a release mechanism 43 for releasing the setting of the rotational position of the winder 31; and a torsion coil spring 35 for energizing the winder 31 in the opposite direction from the winding direction. The main shift control device lOr also has a display 30 for displaying the rotational position.<br>
 	The winder 31 has a shift cable stopping component 41 that is used to<br>
stop the inner cable 40a of a shift cable (Figure 2) connected to a rear derailleur (not<br>
shown).  The winder 31 also has around its periphery a cable guide 42 that guides the<br>
wound inner cable 40a.  The winder 31 is fixed to a rotating shaft 36 rotatably<br>
supported by a bearing on the main control bracket 30. Also fixed to the winder 31 is<br>
a shift gear 37 that constitutes the positioning mechanism 32 and on the peripheral<br>
surface of which are formed serrated feed teeth and positioning teeth.<br>
 	The first shift lever 33 is rotatably mounted to the rotating shaft 36.  The<br>
first shift lever 33 is energized in the opposite direction from the operation direction by a torsion coil spring 52.  A control component 45 is formed at the distal end of the fust shift lever 33.  A feed pawl 46 is rotatably mounted at a point where the first shift lever 33 is positioned inside the main control bracket 30.  The feed pawl 46 is energized such that its distal end can come into contact with the feed teeth of the shift gear 37.  When this first shift lever 33 is rotated in the direction of arrow A in Figure 5, the feed pawl 46 engages with the feed teeth, the shift gear 37 is engaged, and the winder 31 is rotated in the winding direction.<br>
 	The second shift lever 34 has a control component 47 on its distal end.<br>
The second shift lever 34 is energized in the opposite direction from the operation direction by a spring 53.  The second shift lever 34 is rotatably supported on a rotating shaft 38 embedded in the main control bracket 30.  A release pawl 50 and a positioning pawl 51, which are actuated in conjunction with the second shift lever 34, and which constitute the release mechanism 43, are provided at the rotational center of the second shift lever 34.  The release pawl 50 and positioning pawl 51 position the winder 31 by seJeclively" stopping the posidoning teeth formed on the peripheral surface of the shift gear 37.*' The release pawl 50 is energized in the direction of the shift gear 37 by a spring 54, the state of stoppage to the shift gear 37 is released by rotational actuation of the second shift lever 34, and the positioning paw! 51 is stopped to the shift gear 37 simultaneously with this release.  When the second shift lever 34 returns to its original position as a result of its energization by the spring 52, the release pawl 50 is stopped<br>
• Translaior'i noifi:   Lilstjily "altirnalively" in ihe original. •' Translator's nole:  "3S" in ihe original; probable lypo.<br><br>
to the positioning teeth of the shift gear 37, and the winder 31 is positioned Jn a state in which the inner cable has been played out by one tooth of the positioning teeth.  The positioning pawl 51 comes out at this point.<br>
 	A feed pawl release mechanism 55 that works in conjunction with the<br>
second shift lever 34 is provided at the rotational center of the second shift lever 34.' The feed pawl release mechanism 55 rotates a feed pawl release gear 56, which is rotatably supported on the rotating shaft 36, according to the rotation of the second shift lever 34, and rotates the feed pawl 46 to the position where it disengages from the shift gear 37.<br>
A display 39 has an indicator needle 57 mounted at the distal end of the rotating shaft 36.  The indicator needle 57 is Jinked to one end of the rotating shaft 36, and rotates to display the shift position.<br>
  	The first shift lever 33 and second shift lever 34 rotate in opposite<br>
directions from one another.  Specifically, in Figure 4, the first shift lever 33 rotates in the direction of arrow B, while the second shift lever 34 rotates in the direction of arrow C.  The positions after this rotation are close to each other.  Inner cable stopping components 45a and 47a that stop the inner cables 23a and 23b of the control cables 21a and 21b are provided to the control component 45 of the first shift lever 33 and the control component 47 of the second shift lever 34, respectively.  The inner cable stopping components 45a and 47a are designed to stop drums 24a and 24b fixed to the distal ends of the inner cables 23a and 23b.   Outer stopping components 30a and 30b, which are used to stop the outer casings 25a and 25b of the control cables 21a and 21b, are provided to the main control bracket 30. The outer stopping component 30a is provided to the lower portion of the main control bracket 30 in Figure 4, and the outer stopping component 30b is formed at the boundary between the brake bracket 22 and the main control bracket 30,<br>
 	The auxiliary shift control devices 20f and 20r will now be described.<br>
The following description will be for the auxiliary shift control device 20r linked to the main shift control device lOr for rear shifting.<br>
As shown in Figures 7 to 9, the auxiliary shift control device 20r comprises an auxiliary control bracket 60 mounted to the distal end of the bar end 14 that makes up part of the handlebar 11, a first auxiliary shift lever 61 rotatably supported by the auxiliary control bracket 60, a second auxiliary shift lever 62 rotatably supported by the auxiliary control bracket 60 next to the first auxiliary shift lever 61, and a torsion coil<br><br>
spring 63 that is used to return these auxiliary shift levers 61 and 62 to specific positions.<br>
 	The auxiliary control bracket 60 has a ring-shaped fastening<br>
component 65 that has a groove formed in its radial direction, and a tube 66 that is fixed to the bar end 14 by the fastening component 65. A bearing 67 is installed around the outer periphery of the tube 66, and the first auxiliary shift lever 61 is rotatably supported via this bearing 67. A bushing 68 is installed around the outer periphery of the tube 66 at a distance from the bearing 67 in the axial direction, and the second auxiliary shift lever 62 is rotatably supported by the bushing 68.  A return-use torsion coil spring 63 is installed in a twisted state between the bearing 67 and the bushing 68.   One end of the torsion coil spring 30 is stopped by the first auxiliary shift lever 61, and the other end is stopped by the second auxiliary shift lever 62. As a result, the first auxiliary shift lever 61 and the second auxlHary shift lever 62 are energized in opposite directions from one another (the play-out directions of the inner cables 23a and 23b). Here, since the two auxiliary shift levers 61 and 62 rotate in opposite directions, a single torsion coil spring 63 can serve as the two energization means for energizing the two levers 61 and 62.<br>
 	As shown in Figure 8, an outer stopping component 70 and an inner<br>
stopping component 71 that extend in the axial direction of the bar end 14 are formed in the fastening component 65.  The outer stopping component 70 stops the distal end of the outer casing 25a of the control cable 2ia.   The inner cable 23a of this control cable 21a is stopped by an inner stopping component 72 formed on the peripheral surface of the first auxiliary shift lever 61. The inner stopping component 71 stops the drum 26b at the distal end of the inner cable 23b of the control cable 21b.  The outer casing 25b of this control cable 21b is stopped by an outer stopping component 73 provided to the second auxiliary shift lever 62.  The fastening component 65 is fastened to the bar end 14 by a fastening bolt 75.<br>
 	The first auxiliary shift lever 61 has a ring component 80 and an<br>
auxiliary control component 81 that extends outward from the ring component 80 in the<br>
radial direction.   A stopper 82 that strikes the fastening component 65 is provided to<br>
the outer peripheral surface of this ring component 80 such that it protrudes outward,<br>
and the inner stopping component 72 is formed at this stopper 82.  This first auxiliary<br>
shift lever 61 is energized by the torsion coil spring 63 and is always disposed at the<br>
location where the stopper 82 strikes the fastening component 65.<br>
 	The second auxiliary shift lever 62 has a ring component 85 and an<br>
auxiliary control component 86 that extends outward from the ring component 85 in the<br><br>
approximate radial direction,   The  control component 86 is formed on the<br>
opposite side from the auxiliary control component 81 with respect to the axial center.<br>
A stopper 87 is formed at the base of the auxiliary control component 86.  The<br>
stopper 87 strikes the fastening component 65.  The outer slapping component 73 is<br>
formed in this stopper 87. This second auxiliary shift lever 62 is energized by the<br>
torsion coil spring 63 and is always disposed at the location where the stopper 87<br>
strikes the fastening component 65.<br>
 	The actuation during a shift will now be described.<br>
When the first shift lever 33 of the main shift control devices lOr and lOf is rolationally operated in the direction of arrow B in Figure 4 (downward) by the thumb, for example, the winder 31 is rotated in the winding direction (the direction of arrow A in Figure 5) by the feed pawl 46. As a result, the inner cable 40a of the shift cable 40 is pulled, and the front derailleur or rear moves upward, for example.  In the case of a front deraitleur, the chain guide of the front derailleur moves from a smaller diameter gear toward a larger diameter gear and from the inner [cable] toward the outer [casing]. In the case of a rear derailleur, chain guide of the rear derailleur moves from a smaller diameter gear toward a larger diameter gear and from the outer [casing] toward the inner [cable]. When the feed pawl 46 moves the winder 31, the release pawl 50 restricts the rotation of the winder 31 in the line play-out direction at the point when the rotation comes to a halt, whiie stopping Che positioning teeth of the shift gear 37 by one tooth at a time. The winder 31 is positioned rotationally by one stage at a time by this release pawl 50.<br>
 	Meanwhile, when the first auxiliary shift lever 61 of the auxiliary shift<br>
control devices 20f and 20r is rotationally operated in the direction of arrow D in Figure 7 by the thumb, for example, the inner cable 23a of the control cable 21a is pulled and moves in the direction of arrow B in Figure 4, just as when the first shift lever 33 was operated by the thumb.  As a result, the inner cable 40a of the shift cable 40 is pulled in the same manner as that described above.,<br>
 	When the second shift lever 34 is rotationally operated in the direction of<br>
arrow C by the index finger,* for example, the release pawl 50 retracts from the shift gear 37, and at the same time the positioning pawl 51 strikes the shift gear 37.  As a result, the winder 31 is halted in a state in which it has rotated slightly in the line play-out direction.   At this point, the feed pawl 46 is also retracted from the shift gear 37 by the feed pawl release mechanism 54.  When the second shift lever 34 is returned to its<br><br>
home position by the spring 52 in this state, the positioning pawl 51' retracts from the shift gear 37, the release pawl 50*" is stopped by the tooth on the upstream side in the line play-out direction of the shift gear 37, and the winder 3! rotates by one tooth in the line play-out direction.  As a result, the inner cable 40a of the control cable 40 is played out by one shift step, and the derailleur moves downward. In the case of a front derailleur, for instance, the chain guide moves from a larger gear to a smaller gear and from the outer [casing] to the inner [cable], and in the case of a rear derailleur, the chain  moves from a larger gear to a smaller gear and from the inner [cable] to the outer [casing].<br>
 	Meanwhile, when the second auxiliary shift lever 62 of the auxiliary<br>
shift control devices 20f and 20r is operated in the direction of arrow E in Figure 7 by<br>
the index finger, for example, the outer casing 25b of the control cable 2Ib is pushed,<br>
and the inner cable 23b is relatively pulled.  As a result, the second shift lever 34<br>
rotates in the direction of arrow C in Figure 4, the inner cable 40a of the shift cable 40<br>
is played out by the above actuation, and a downshift is made.<br>
 	Here, the shift control can be performed by either of the main shift<br>
control devices lOf and lOr and auxiliary shift control devices 20f and 20r. Furthermore, either of the shift control devices can be used to make a shift by repeating the same actuation from a given position, regardless of the shift step.  Therefore, shift control can be performed easily and reliably from two handle positions.<br>
Embodiment 2<br>
In the above embodiment, the auxiliary shift levers of the auxiliary shift control device were rotated in a different directions, but they may also be rotated in the same direction, as shown in Figures 10 and 11.  The routing of the control cables 21a and 21b is easier in this case.<br>
Here, the auxiliary shift control device 20r has an auxiliary control bracket 60, a first auxiliary shift lever 61, a second auxiliary shift lever 62, a first torsion coil spring 63a that is used to return the first auxiliary shift lever 61 to a specific rotational position, and a second torsion coil spring 63b that is used to return the second auxiliary shift lever 62 to a specific rotational position.  The auxiliary control bracket 60 has a fastening component 65 and a tube 66 that is fastened by the fastening component 65. A bearing is disposed at a distance on the outer peripheral side of the tube 66, and the<br>
' Translaior'i noie:   "52" in the original; probable l&gt;po. •" Translator's note:   "52" in [hs original; probabli lypo.<br><br>
first auxiliary shift lever 61 is rotatably supported on the tube 66 by this bearing 67.  A bushing 68 is disposed at a distance from the bearing 67 on the outer peripheral side of the tube 66, and the second auxiliary shift lever 62 is rotatably supported on the tube 66 by this bushing 68.<br>
 	With this structure, the first auxiliary shift lever 61 and the second<br>
auxiliary shift lever 62 are provided with stoppers 82 and 87, respectively, that each strike the fastening component 65, and these stoppers 82 and 87 are provided with the inner stopping components 71 and 72 that stop the inner cables 23a and 23b of the control cables 21a and 21b.  The fastening component 65 is provided with two outer [casing] stopping components 70 and 73 that stop the outer casings 25a and 25b, respectively,<br>
 	With a structure such as this, when the first auxiliary shift lever 61 is<br>
rotationally operated downward, the first shift lever 33 rotates via the control cable 21a, and an upshift is made. Conversely, when the second auxiliary shift lever 62 is rotationally operated downward, the control cable 21b is operated, the second shift lever 34 is operated, and a downshift is made.<br>
Embodiment 3<br>
With the above embodiment, a shift was made in the auxiliary shift control device by means of two auxiliary shift levers, but in this embodiment, the shift control is performed with a single auxiliary shift lever.<br>
 	As shown in Figures 12 to 14, this auxiliary shift control device 20r has<br>
a main control bracket 90, an auxiliary shift lever 91 that is rotatably supported on the main control bracket 90, a rotary member 92 that only rotates in conjunction with the rotadon of the auxiliary shift lever 91 in one direction, a first torsion coil spring 93a that returns the auxiliary shift lever 91 to a specific position, and a second torsion coil spring 93b that returns the rotary member 92 to a specific position.   The main control bracket 90 has a fastening component 95 and a tube 96 that is fastened by the fastening component 95.  The lower end of the tube 96 in Figure 13 is formed so as to cover the rotary member 92. The fastening component 95 has outer [casing] stopping components 9ia and 91b that stop the outer casings of the two control cables 21a [and 21b].  The auxiliary shift lever 91 has an inner [cable] stopping component 92a that stops the distal end of the inner cable 23a of the control cable 2la.  This inner [cable] stopping component 92a also functions as a stopper that strikes the fastening<br><br>
component 95.* The rotary member 92 has an inner [cable] stopping component 92b that stops the distal end of the inner cable 23b of the control cable 23b.  This inner [cable] stopping component 92b also functions as a stopper that strikes the fastening component 95."<br>
 	The auxiliary shift lever 91 has a ring component 98 that is rotatably<br>
supported on the tube 96, and a control component 99 that extends from the ring component 98 in the radial direction.   An engagement component 100 that is sunken lower than the other portions during a specific angle in the peripheral direction is formed on the rotary member 92 side of the ring component 98. An engagement protrusion 101 is formed around the outer periphery of the rotary member 92 toward this engagement component 100.   As a result of the engagement of the engagement protrusion 101 and the engagement component 100, the range of rotation of the rotary member 92 is restricted, the rotary member 92 is energized at a specific position by the second torsion coil spring 93b, and further rotation is prohibited by the stopper, so the rotary member 92 only rotates in conjunction with the counterclockwise rotation (in Figure 14) of the auxiliary shift lever 91, and does not rotate in conjunction with clockwise rotation.<br>
 	With a structure such as this, when the auxiliary shift lever 91 is rotated<br>
clockwise from the specific position indicated by the solid lines in the figure, the rotary member 92 does not rotate, and only the auxiliary shift lever 91 rotates clockwise.  As a result, the inner cable 23a of the control cable 21a is pulled and the first shift lever 33 is actuated. Conversely, when the auxiliary shift lever 91 is rotated counterclockwise from the specific position indicated by the solid lines, the inner cable 23a just goes slack and is not pulled, and the rotary member 92 rotates counterclockwise in conjunction with the rotation of the auxiliary shift lever 91.  As a result, the inner cable 23b of the control cable 21b is pulled and the second shift lever 34 is actuated.        With a structure such as this, an upshift or downshift can be made according to the rotational direction of the single control lever, so a shift can be made easily and reliably.<br>
Embodiment 4<br>
In the above Embodiment 3, the design was such that the control cable 21a was stopped by the auxiliary shift lever 91, but as shown in Figure 15, two rotary members 92a and 92b may be provided, one on either side of the auxiliary shift<br><br>
lever 91, and the control cables 21a and 21b may be stopped by the rotary members 92a and 92b, respectively.  In this case, the auxiliary shift lever 91 rotates in both directions, but the rotary member 92a only follows this rotation in one direction of the auxiliary shift lever 91, and the rotary member 92b only follows the rotation in the other direction of the auxiliary shift lever 91. The two rotary members 92a and 92b are energized in opposite directions by the torsion coil spring 93a and 93b.  Again in this embodiment, a shift can be made easily and reliably since an upshift or downshift can be made according to the rotational direction of the single control lever.<br>
Embodiment 5<br>
In the above Embodiment 4, the brake lever 21 was only provided to the main bar 12, so shift control could not be performed on the bar end 14 side, but as shown in Figure 16, the main shift control device lOr may be separate from the brake lever 122, and the brake lever 122 may be mounted at the distal end of the bar end 14. Also, the auxiliary shift controi device 20r may be mounted directly at the distal end of the bar end 14.<br>
 	In Figure 16, the main shift control device 10b comprises a main control<br>
bracket 30c and a first shift lever 33 and second shift lever 34 that are rotatably supported inside the main control bracket 30c.  The main control bracket 30c is provided with outer [casing] stopping components 30a and 30b that stop the outer casings of the two control cables 21a and 21b. The rest of the structure is the same as that in the main shift control device described above, and as such will not be described here.<br>
[•^©5^]	The auxiliary shift control device 20 has a rotary bracket 110 fixed to the<br>
distal end of the bar end 14, and a first auxiliary shift lever 111 and second auxiliary shift lever 112 that are rotatably supported by the rotary bracket 110.  The first auxiliary shift lever 111 and second auxiliary shift lever 112 each can be returned to a specific position by a spring (not shown), and the rotational operation thereof begins from this specific position.  The first auxiliary shift lever 111 and second auxiliary shift lever 112 are provided with inner [cable] stopping components 11 la and 112a, respectively.  The auxiliary control bracket 110 is provided with outer [casing] stopping components 110a and 110b.<br>
['6053 ]	Meanwhile, a brake bracket 120 and the bar end 14 are mounted<br>
integrally or separately to the distal end of the bar end 14.   A first brake lever 121 that extends to the grip 13 side, and a second brake lever 122 that extends along the bar<br><br>
end 14, are integrally and rotatably supported by the brake bracket 120. With a structure such as this, shift control and braking control can both be performed with the bar end 14, so shift control and braking control can both be performed easily and reliably from two handle positions.<br>
Other embodiments<br>
(a)In the above embodiments, the auxiliary shift devices 20f and 20r were mounted to the bar end 14 of a mountain bike, but the present invention is not limited to this, and the auxiliary shift control devices may instead be mounted to the DH bar of a road bike.<br>
(b)In the above embodiments, the auxiliary shift control devices 20f and 20r were mounted to the bar end 14, and the main shift control devices lOf and lOr were mounted to the main bar end 12, but the present invention is not limited to this and the main shift control devices 1 Of and I Or may instead be mounted to the bar end 14, and the auxiliary shift control devices 20f and 20r to the main bar 12.<br>
Merits of the inventions.<br>
With the present invention, shift control may be performed by the rotational operation of either the main shift control device or the auxiliary shift control device fi-om a specific position, regardless of the shift step, so shift control can be performed easily and reliably from two handle positions.<br>
