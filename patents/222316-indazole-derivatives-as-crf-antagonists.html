Indazole derivatives as CRF antagonists<br>
This invention relates indazole derivatives of formula I and II with CRF activity, and associated pharmaceutical compositions, and methods for use as therapeutic agents.<br><br>
Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) or hormone (CRH) is one of several neurohormones synthesized by specific hypothalamic nuclei in the brain where it activates the transcription of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene resulting in release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and beta-endorphin from anterior pituitary cells (Vale etal, Science 213, 1394-1397 (1981)). The fundamental role of CRF is to prepare the organism for an appropriate response to various stressors such as physical trauma, insults of the immune system and social interactions. CRF also has CNS effects by acting at higher centers in the brain, particularly cortical regions where there is a widespread distribution of CRF neurons. CRF is believed to be a key intermediary in communication between the immune, central nervous, endocrine and cardiovascular systems (Sapolsky et al, Science 238, 522-524 (1987)). The role played by CRF in integrating the response of the immune system to physiological, psychological and immunological stressors has been described in the art, e.g. J.E. Blalock, Physiological Reviews 69,1 (1989) and J.E. Morley, Life Sci. 41, 527 (1987).<br>
CRF antagonists are effective in the treatment of a wide range of stress-related illnesses, mood disorders such as depression, major depressive disorder, single episode depression, recurrent depression, child abuse induced depression, postpartum depression, dysthemia, bipolar disorder and cyclothymia; chronic fatigue syndrome; eating disorders such as obesity, anorexia and bulimia nervosa; generalized anxiety disorder; panic disorder; phobias; obsessive-compulsive disorder; post-traumatic stress disorder; pain perception such as fibromyalgia; headache; stress-induced gastrointestinal dysfunction such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), colonic hypersensitivity or spastic colon; hemorrhagic stress; ulcers; stress-induced psychotic episodes; inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis; asthma; psoriasis; allergies; premature birth; hypertension;<br><br>
congestive heart failure; sleep disorders; neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's :ase, senile dementia, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease; head or spinal cord ima; ischemic neuronal damage; excitotoxic neuronal damage; epilepsy; stroke; psycho-[al dwarfism; chemical dependencies and addictions; drug and alcohol withdrawal sym-ms; stress-induced immune dysfunctions; immune suppression and stress-induced in-ions; cardiovascular or heart related diseases; fertility problems; and /or human im-riodeficiency virus infections. Accordingly clinical data suggests that CRF receptor ant-nists may represent novel antidepressants and/or anxiolytic drugs that may be useful in<br>
	treatment of the neuropsychiatry disorders manifesting hypersecretion of CRR<br>
In view of the above, efficacious and specific antagonists of CRF are desired as potentially valuable therapeutic agents for the treatment of psychiatric disorders and neurological diseases. It is thus desirable to discover new CRF antagonists.<br>
WO 02/16348 describes indazole derivatives which are inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor. WO 01/58869 discloses indazole derivatives which are cannabinoid receptor modulators.<br>

Compound Preparation<br>

In particular, certain compounds of Formulae I and II maybe prepared utilizing as an intermediate 7-bromoindazole (3)&gt; the preparation of which is illustrated in Scheme 1.

The R3 (optionally substituted aryl or heteroaryl) substituent can be introduced by standard aryl coupling procedures which are well known in the art. The<br><br>
resulting 7-aryl (or heteroaryl) indazoles, e.g., 4, are readily transformed into the com-. pounds of the present invention as outlined in Schemes 1-3. Similar transformations can be used to convert 18 into the compounds of formula II.<br>

Nitration of 4a produces a mixture of regioisomeric nitroindazoles from which the 3-nitroindazole 7a is readily isolated. The nitro substituent can be reduced to the corresponding amine 8a under standard conditions. An alternate route to 8a involves treatment of 4a with n-butyffitium to produce the 3-lithiated heterocycle 11 which is quenched with<br><br>
carbon dioxide to produce carboxylic acid 10a. The amine can be prepared from carboxylic acid 10a utilizing the Curtius rearrangement or a variant thereof (J. March Advanced Organic Chemistry 4th Ed J Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1991; pp 1090-1095).<br><br>
Conversion of amine 8a into amide 12a can be achieved by a variety of methodologies well known in the art (J. March Advanced Organic Chemistry 4   Ed J Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1991; pp 417-424). Reduction of the amide with borane-THF complex, or other reducing agents, (J. March supra&gt; pp 445-446) affords the secondary amine 13a that can be further transformed to the tertiary amine 15a by reductive animation or via a second acylation and reduction sequence. Alternatively tertiary amines 14a can be prepared directly from 8a by reductive animation. (Scheme 2) The stepwise procedure permits the preparation of tertiary amines with different substituents on the nitrogen atom.<br>
The lithiated heteroq^cle 11 (Scheme 3) can be quenched with carbonyl compounds to produce carbinols 5 which, in turn, can be dehydrated to olefins 6 described herein. The dehydration produces a mixture of geometrical isomers. The present invention includes both the pure E and Z isomers and mixtures thereof. The olefins optionally can be further converted to the corresponding alkane 17.<br>
