				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
The present invention concerns a condenser for domestic refrigerator cabinets, of the type comprising channelling for the passage of the refrigerant associated with a substantially flat metal surface in order to increase the heat exchange between the refrigerant and the air. The term refrigerator cabinet refers to any type of domestic refrigerator or freezer.<br>
The static condensers used today in domestic refrigeration are essentially of two types: plate—type and wire—type. The first type is that referred to at the start of the description. Both types have the drawback of having a primary surface (tube) and a secondary surface (plate or wires) that are joined to the primary one by stapling or welding (therefore contact is made at only a few points, with a consequent loss of temperature and hence efficiency)<br>
Neither US 2471960 nor US 2595472 discloses a condenser with grooves having horizontal rectilinear lengths connected together, in the manner of a coil, by curvilinear lengths. US 2471960 discloses rectilinear vertical grooves connected in parallel. Therefore the only horizontal portions of the grooves are a sort of manifolds connecting the vertical grooves.<br>
US 2595472 does not disclose a condenser of the type disclosed in the present application. On the contrary, US 2595472 discloses an evaporator, particularly for a chest freezer or the like, in which a semi-circular conduit of the refrigerant is wound about a container.<br>
2<br><br>
Furthermore, recent experiments made by the applicant on condensers have surprisingly demonstrated the great importance of mass in this type of heat exchanger.<br>
The aim of the present invention is therefore that of providing a condenser that does not have the aforementioned drawbacks, for which a substantial energy saving can be guaranteed, while remaining simple and economic to produce.<br>
According to the invention, this aim is achieved by the fact that the condenser comprises two metal plates facing each other and joined together by welding or brazing, at least one of said plates being provided with a shaped groove capable of constituting said channelling for the passage of the refrigerant.<br>
Because of these characteristics it is possible to guarantee<br>
optimal heat exchange between the hot refrigerant and the<br>
material constituting the plate. Furthermore, with the<br>
solution according to the invention	<br><br>
it is possible to use a plate of greater thickness, and there is no need to ensure good shaping of the plate in the area of the tubes (as required by current plate-type condensers). In fact, the plate condensers used nowadays have a thickness of 0.3-0.4 mm, whereas in the solution according to the invention the condenser is formed by two plates of a thickness preferably comprised between 0.2 and 0.5mm, more preferably between 0.3 and 0.4 mm, brazed or welded together, for which the total thickness is preferably comprised between 0.6 and 0.8 mm. The main advantages of the solution according to the invention over traditional condensers are:<br>
a.	high efficiency through better contact. The primary<br>
surface (tube) and the secondary surface (plate) of<br>
traditional plate condensers are all the same in that<br>
they are two plates, a smooth flat one and a flat one<br>
with funnelled channelling in the form of grooves<br>
brazed or welded together, with contact over the whole<br>
surface except in the area of the shaped groove;<br>
b.	high efficiency because of the closeness of the<br>
channels. Current condensers have an inter-tube pitch<br>
of 50-60 mm. This distance was once considered to be<br>
optimal, as a fair compromise between cost and<br>
performance. In the solution according to the invention<br>
(the channelling being produced by pressing, the number of channellings does not alter the cost of the component by which it can be produced so as to optimise performance. An inter-channel pitch of between 2 0 and 50 mm, preferably between 30 and 40 mm, has proved optimal in terms of efficiency of exchange, particularly with a horizontal lying position of the parallel rectilinear portions of the conduits (connected by curvilinear portions for the production of the coil), with reference to the usage configuration<br><br>
of the condenser arranged on an outer wall of the refrigerator cabinet;<br>
c.	high efficiency through greater mass of the condenser.<br>
As stated above, current plate-type condensers have a<br>
thickness of 0.3-0.4 mm, which is a limit for this type<br>
of technology. With the solution according to the<br>
invention it is possible also to have thicknesses of<br>
0.8 mm and therefore double the weight (for the same<br>
surface area). On the basis of tests carried out, a<br>
thickness of 0.6-0.8 mm proves to be optimal;<br>
d.	possibility of providing L-shaped side folds in the<br>
plate, in order to obtain the desired dimension of the<br>
"chimney", and of having prepositioning, for fixing to<br>
the product without using other components (as is<br>
necessary in some plate-type solutions and for the<br>
wire-type version). The term "chimney" refers here to<br>
the portion of space comprised between the condenser<br>
and the rear wall of the refrigerator cabinet, suitable<br>
for directing the hot air upwards by convective motion.<br>
On the basis of the tests carried out, the applicant has found that, in order to improve efficiency further, the solution according to the invention requires a section of the channelling preferably comprised between 6 and 14 mm2, more preferably comprised between 8 and 12 mm2. According to another characteristic of the invention, the condenser can advantageously be provided with finning between the channelling, which permits better circulation of air between the two sides of the condenser. The optimal height of the fins is comprised between 3 and 12 mm, preferably between 5 and 10 mm.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention it is possible to braze in a furnace, together with the two plates, also the two tubes for connection to the remainder of the circuit  (compressor  and  filter).  This  will  make  it<br><br>
possible  to have better quality  (elimination  of  two<br>
welds) and lower cost of the condenser.<br>
Further advantages and characteristics  of a condenser<br>
according to the present invention will become apparent<br>
from the following detailed description, provided purely<br>
by way of non-exhaustive example, with reference to the<br>
attached drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a view of the condenser in one configuration<br>
thereof installed on a domestic refrigerator,<br>
Figure 2 is a side view of the condenser in Figure 1,<br>
Figure 3 is a detail from Figure 1, which illustrates the<br>
finning of the condenser,<br>
Figure 4 is a view in section along the line IV-IV in<br>
Figure 3, on a larger scale, and<br>
Figure 5 is a view in section, along the line V-V, in<br>
Figure 3.<br>
With reference to the drawings, the reference numeral 10<br>
illustrates a domestic refrigerator provided, on a rear<br>
wall  thereof  10a,  with  a  condenser  12  capable  of<br>
receiving hot refrigerant coming from a compressor C, of<br>
liquefying it gradually and of sending it, cooled, to an<br>
evaporator (not illustrated) of the refrigerant circuit.<br>
The condenser 12 is constituted by two metal plates 12a<br>
and 12b made of iron or steel (Figures 4 and 5) brazed<br>
together in a furnace (for example, using a copper-based<br>
brazing alloy) and each having a thickness of 0.4mm. One<br>
of the two plates,  in the example illustrated in the<br>
drawing the plate 12b, has a shaped groove 14 made for<br>
example by pressing, which covers substantially the whole<br>
flat surface of the condenser along a coiled path.  In<br>
particular,   downstream  from  the  compressor  C  the<br>
refrigerant enters the bottom of the channelling defined<br>
by the groove 14 and flows, horizontally and back and<br>
forth, over the flat surface of the condenser until it<br><br>
reaches the top.' From there, through a vertical groove 14' , it is directed towards the lower portion of the condenser, from where it is then sent subsequently to the evaporator.<br>
The vertical distance H between two parallel lengths of the groove is, in the example illustrated, comprised between 30 and 40 mm. The condenser 12 has at the side two L-shaped folded edges 12c that are capable of defining both the portions for joining (for example by screwing) to the rear wall 10a of the refrigerator 10 and, together with said wall, a channel F generally known as a "chimney" suitably inclined and suitable for favouring the circulation of air by convective motion in relation to the condenser 12.<br>
In order to increase heat exchange, the surfaces of the condenser comprised between the parallel rectilinear lengths of the groove 14 are provided with fins 16 made by partial cutting of the plates 12a and 12b and subsequent bending (Figures 3 and 4). Tests carried out by the applicant have demonstrated that the optimal height H' of the fins is comprised between 5 and 10 mm, with a length of between 20 and 40 mm, although this latter characteristic is not particularly critical and is dictated by the exigencies of practical production of the fins.<br>
The groove 14 of the condenser 12 has an optimal section of passage of 8 - 12mm2, with a depth of 2.1 - 3.2 mm, a main radius R (Figure 5) of 1.5 - 2 mm and a secondary radius R' (for connection to the flat plate 12a of the condenser) of 0.5 - 1 mm.<br>
In relation to the connections to the compressor C and to the remainder of the refrigerant circuit, the condenser 12 is provided with small connecting tubes 18 joined to<br><br>
the condenser itself during the process of brazing or welding the two plates 12a and 12b. EXAMPLE<br>
Tests have been carried out on a prototype condenser as described and illustrated, with a 10 mm2 section of channelling and a pitch between the horizontal lengths of channelling equal to 35 mm. The condenser was installed on the Whirlpool RE 160 AUT model refrigerator produced by the applicant, from which the traditional type of plate condenser was removed for preventive reasons. Said tests were repeated, in identical conditions, on a commercial Whirlpool refrigerator of the same model. The tests gave the following results:<br><br>
refrigerator, there was a 3.4% lower consumption, thanks to a lowering of the condensation temperature by 3.2DC obtained with the condenser according to the invention. Naturally, variants of the condenser according to the invention are possible. For example, the groove can be produced on both the plates so that the channelling is made in the space between the grooves facing each other; in this configuration the channelling has a substantially circular cross-section. Furthermore, the material of the plates can also vary, although the choice of iron or steel is the only one that guarantees the advantageous effects both in terms of energy efficiency and of reduced costs.<br><br><br>
