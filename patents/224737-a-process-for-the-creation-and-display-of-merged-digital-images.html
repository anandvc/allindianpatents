				<td>A PROCESS FOR CREATION AND DISPLAY OF MERGED DIGITAL IMAGES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to software processes and in particular to a<br>
process for the creation of an image by merging multiple independent image files and<br>
output of the created image.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Methods for the creation and display of multiple independent images from a<br>
mosaic of pixels which are interwoven in a predetermined arrangement such that each of<br>
the images can be selected by precise positioning of a screen in different positions<br>
relative to a grid mask which masks out all but pixels of a selected image are known,<br>
particularly in the field of advertising.<br>
With the advent of modern display advertising, limitations on advertising<br>
budgets and limited locations for display to high densities of consumers, a great demand<br>
has arisen for displaying multiple advertisements at individual popular display locations<br>
thereby enabling a number of advertisers to benefit from a single location. Numerous<br>
different methods and devices have been proposed for preparing and displaying such<br>
advertisements. Many such devices involve relatively unwieldy mechanical elements<br>
driven by complex drive mechanisms which require a certain degree of mechanical<br>
precision. Thus, in addition to the expense of original manufacture, the user is often faced<br>
with expensive maintenance.<br>
In addition, operation of these current drive mechanisms tend to produce an<br>
undesirable amount of noise. Typically, these devices are used in public retail outlets or<br>
other public locations. The noise level of the drive mechanism frequently predominates<br>
over the background music being played at such locations. This noise detracts from the<br>
overall environment sought by the retailers at the location where the advertising display is<br>
positioned.<br>
One such apparatus used in the advertising field has a transparent image<br>
screen which contains a mosaic of four discrete images formed from pixels which are<br>
interwoven in a predetermined arrangement such that each of the images are selected by<br>
precise positioning of the screen in four different positions relative to a grid mask which<br>
masks out all but pixels of a selected image. A platen comprising a platen surface which<br>
is supported by a rib structure mounts the image screen and is moveable through a precise<br>
pattern for selecting the pixels, and thereby the image, to be projected. A pair of arms are<br><br>
coupled to the platen and an eccentric drive and are driven by the eccentric drive to<br>
advance the platen positively through the pattern.<br>
The majority of devices accomplishing this transition of images are<br>
mechanical in nature and are used on billboards and the like. It is desirable to have a<br>
system that displays multiple images wherein the exchange from one image to another is<br>
nearly instantaneous thereby enabling sequential display of different images which gives<br>
the impression of animation. Such a sequential display would draw and hold a viewer's<br>
attention on what would appear to be an animated advertisement.<br>
Display devices including templates with patterns of apertures which define<br>
numbers, letters or figures when they are illuminated by back lighting have also been<br>
described. There have also been display devices described including transparency sheets<br>
which have images thereon and which are illuminated by back lighting and an overlay<br>
mask which blocks the back lighting from illuminating certain areas of the transparency<br>
sheets.<br>
In addition, devices have been proposed which include a translucent image<br>
screen made up of a mosaic of discrete images formed by relatively small interlaced<br>
translucent pixels or window segments which are arranged in uniform groups. The pixels<br>
corresponding to a discrete image occupy the same relative position in each group and<br>
bear corresponding magnitudes of translucency. The image screen may then be covered<br>
with an opaque screen having a uniform pattern of transparent display apertures. The<br>
opaque screen blocks back lighting from shining through the image screen except through<br>
the display apertures. The uniformly patterned display apertures arc then aligned with<br>
pixels which correspond to a discrete image and the discrete image is thereby displayed<br>
due to the back lighting shining through the image screen and display apertures. The<br>
opaque screen may then be selectively shifted on the image screen such that the display<br>
apertures align with the pixels of a different discrete image. Thus, each discrete image<br>
may be sequentially displayed.<br>
Systems which are similar in concept to those described above are used to<br>
create images for film. One such system is an exposure system for creating a single<br>
frame transparency which has an enlarger rack with a transparency fixture including a<br>
light obscuring exposure mask and a multi axial table for relative movement there<br>
between during an exposure process which results in a single transparency having four<br>
independent images. Each of the images have spaced apart groups of pixels interlaced<br><br>
with the groups of pixels from each of the other images, and each of the images are<br>
selectable for projection by a movable grid mask. The transparency is formed by<br>
sequentially exposing portions of a sheet of film overlayed by a grid-like mask, and<br>
correspondingly repositioning the film after each exposure such that a new interlaced area<br>
of film is exposed.<br>
A variety of exposure fixtures and methods have been disclosed for making<br>
single sheet transparencies containing multiple images for subsequent individual display<br>
in a selected sequence. Commonly referred to as "step and repeat" registration systems,<br>
some of these devices provide a positioning fixture for multiple image exposures onto a<br>
single sheet of film. One such device discloses a stage upon which photosensitive film is<br>
mounted. The stage is moveable along a horizontal plane defined by two perpendicular<br>
drives, and enclosed within a glass-covered housing. Elevated above the stage are two<br>
parallel spaced tape lengths securing an image bearing negative. A light source<br>
positioned above the secured negative provides a light beam capable of projecting the<br>
image onto a particular section of the film, with the remainder of the film obscured from<br>
the light. Incrementally re-positioning the film after each successive exposure is<br>
performed by a stepping motor and a control circuit, resulting in an exposed sheet of film<br>
containing separated multiple images.<br>
Step and repeat exposure methods associated with the type of fixture<br>
described above generally begin by exposing a particular negative onto an unmasked<br>
portion of film. Next, the "step and repeat" fixture is utilised in an effort to precisely<br>
move either the film or a mask to the corresponding location for the next image to be<br>
exposed. The process repeats as desired until the film is completely exposed.<br>
Attempts to overcome a problem known as "interlacing" have been made by<br>
providing a specially masked fixture. The fixture is part of an exposure system,<br>
comprising a camera and a framework for mounting a projector. A mirrored, folded light<br>
path is provided through the framework for columnating the light to obtain full size<br>
pixels. This mirrored path is necessary to minimise divergence of the projected light from<br>
the light source, often causing shadowing and ovcrsizing of exposed pixels clue to the<br>
relatively small sizing of the mask apertures through which the projected light passes.<br>
The system further includes a mask capable of obscuring and passing preselected<br>
segments of light, and a moveable vacuum mount with film mounted thereon.<br>
The corresponding method of fabrication used with the fixture begins by<br><br>
supplying an image bearing negative along with a full size sheet of film. The fixture mask<br>
allows "segments" of the overall image to be exposed onto the film, while still preserving<br>
the overall image likeness. Projecting the image onto the masked film initiates the<br>
exposure process thus exposing a portion of the transparency with the image. Next, a new<br>
negative is supplied and the process repeated. After four such exposures, the resulting<br>
transparency forms a mosaic having groups of interlaced pixels corresponding to the four<br>
discrete images. Although offering some benefits in that the fixture and method offers a<br>
movable mount and a light obscuring mask to interlace the images, due to the fact that the<br>
device is large and relatively complex because of the mirrored path, it has not gained<br>
general commercial acceptance.<br>
A further limitation often affecting prior art mosaic fixtures and methods<br>
involves a phenomena commonly referred to as "white flash", which often compromises<br>
the quality of the finished product. Representing bright border streaks adjacent to opaque<br>
pixel boundary lines, "white flash" detracts from the quality of the image presentation<br>
during an image transition, causing attention to the bright aberrations momentarily<br>
observable on the display viewing surface. Careful exposure techniques may result in a<br>
transparency free from "white flash". However, such techniques often require exact<br>
alignment between the exposure mask and film to prevent exposure voids between pixels.<br>
Such time consuming care creates a more costly finished product and renders the quality<br>
of such product highly dependent on the care and skill exercised by the operator.<br>
As discussed above, the methods for creating multiple images is generally<br>
used in large scale applications such as on billboards or films. There have been rapid<br>
advances in the production and display of digital images, and most of these images are<br>
stored in a file containing information about the image. There are numerous file formats<br>
which store image data in different ways for example, from top to bottom and pixels in<br>
red/green/blue order. Different formats also support different image compression rates.<br>
Summary of the Disclosure<br>
We have now created a process for the creation of merged images that allows<br>
improved control of the interlacing or merging of sections of the base images. We have<br>
found that by directing the output of merged digital images we may at least partially<br>
overcome the abovementioned disadvantages or provide the consumer with a useful or<br>
commercial choice.<br>
In one form the invention resides in a process for the creation of a merged<br><br>
image comprising the steps of:<br>
(a) preparing at least two base images in digital format;<br>
(b) selecting a pattern wherein said pattern comprises a multiplicity of<br>
cells, each cell having n regions wherein n is the number of<br>
prepared base images and each region has different, distinct two-<br>
dimensioned coordinates and the regions in each cell are arranged<br>
in a non-linear pattern;<br>
(c) applying the pattern to each base image to divide each base image<br>
into a plurality of cells each having n regions;<br>
(d) providing a merged image template wherein said template<br>
comprises a multiplicity of cells, each cell having n regions where<br>
n is the number of prepared base images and wherein each region<br>
of a cell is assigned to a different prepared base image and the<br>
template is divided in the same pattern applied to the base images<br>
and the regions in each cell are arranged in the non-linear pattern;<br>
(e) selecting a mergable portion of each respective base image<br>
wherein the mergable portion corresponds to each region of each<br>
cell assigned to the respective base image;<br>
(f) consecutively merging only the selected mergable portions of each<br>
respective base image into the merged image template in a non-<br>
overlapping manner to provide a single layer merged image; and<br>
(g) outputting the merged image in at least one of a computer<br>
readable and/or a physical form.<br><br>
The invention particularly relates to a software process for the adaptation of<br>
each of the base images into a mergable form and following this, the<br>
merging/interlacing of multiple independent image files into a single image for<br>
output. The invention also relates to the creation and output of the single file<br>
using a computer network based system. The resulting single merged image<br>
may be adapted for printing, outputting to film or colour separation.<br>
The images of each base image once adapted according to the method may<br>
suitably be merged digitally to form a single layer image. Other additional layers<br>
may be added.<br>
Preferably, at least one additional layer may be added to the merged image.<br>
Typically, an additional layer can be added, the entire additional layer being<br>
digitally transparent except for advertising material such as trade marks and<br>
other digital information, for example, venier scales, image borders, alignment<br>
grids or the like. The additional layer may comprise a grid of opaque lines<br>
separating the individual regions. The addition of this layer may prevent white<br>
flash and/or increase the alignment error margin which is not possible with<br>
current output systems.<br>
The pattern to be applied to each of the base images may be a grid pattern.<br>
Suitably each base image may have a grid applied to it, to notionally adapt the<br>
base image into a plurality of cells, each cell may be further notionally adapted<br>
into a multiplicity of regions. The grid of the pattern maybe of any dimension,<br>
but will preferably be sized according to the dimensions of either the base image<br>
or the dimensions of the merged image which is required by a user. The cells<br>
and regions into............<br><br>
which the grid notionally adapts each base image will preferably be sized according to<br>
the dimensions of either the base image or the dimensions of the merged image which is<br>
required by a user.<br>
The cells and/or regions into which each base image is notionally adapted<br>
may preferably be square, but alternatively may be of any other shape. For example, the<br>
cells and/or regions may be rectangular, round or circular, hexagonal, waveform or any<br>
shape. The shape of the cells and/or regions may be chosen for reasons of efficiency or<br>
appearance, or alternatively to create a particular watermark on the merged image.<br>
The shape of cells and/or regions may also be chosen to achieve or maintain<br>
high tolerance with regard to pixel or cells and/or region spacing. An opaque border<br>
surrounding each pixel may be incorporated into the merged image to reduce the<br>
problem of "white flash". It is typically important that high tolerances be maintained<br>
with regards to pixel spacing to maximise the effectiveness of the process.<br>
Different base images may be divided into differently shaped cells and/or<br>
regions. Preferably the cells would be of the same shape but they may be differently<br>
shaped.<br>
The size of the cells and/or regions into which each base image is divided<br>
may be similarly chosen on the basis of efficiency and maintenance of the required<br>
tolerance with regard to pixel spacing. For example, the digital nature of the current<br>
process may allow the regions to approximate individual pixel sizes. However, the actual<br>
size chosen for the cells and/or regions may be governed to a large extent by the<br>
dimensions of the screen used in the display of the merged image. The screen 01<br>
merged image may be moveablc between different positions relative to a grid mask<br>
which masks out all but the cells and/or regions of a selected base image.<br>
The creation of the cells and/or regions for each of the base images may<br>
suitably be such that when they are combined to form the merged image, the cells and/or<br>
regions of each adapted image may be interlaced closely or at any required spacing. In<br>
this manner, the tolerances of the screen used in the display of the merged image may be<br>
taken into account. For example, a screen which is manufactured poorly or with a lower<br>
than expected tolerance, may still be usable if the separation of the sections of the merged<br>
image are spaced accordingly. Due to the digital nature of the creation of the merged<br>
image according to the present invention, control over the spacings of the cells and/or<br>
regions may allow for the continued use of otherwise unusable screens.<br><br>
There may be any number of base images merged into the merged image.<br>
Preferably, four images may be used as this allows the sections to be efficiently<br>
located when applying the pattern to the image and also may render the<br>
overlaying of the adapted images simpler and allow higher tolerances.<br>
A further advantage of the present invention is that the merged vile can be<br>
dimensionally distorted to allow for inaccuracies in the output equipment. If, for<br>
opposite example, the outputted merged mosaic is skewed, then the file may be<br>
skewed in the opposite direction prior to output in order that the finished output<br>
mosaic is dimensionally accurate. A similar correction may be made if the image<br>
is longer, shorter or distorted in any other way.<br>
In another form the invention resides in a computer network based process<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
(a) at least one end user supplying at least two base images to an<br>
image interrogation means;<br>
(b)the image interrogation means checking the base images for<br>
suitability and size;<br>
(c ) preparing at least two base images in digital format;<br>
(d) selecting a pattern wherein said pattern comprises a multiplicity of<br>
cells, each cell having n regions wherein n is the number of<br>
prepared base images and wherein each region of a cell is<br><br>
assigned to a different prepared base image, the regions in each cell<br>
arranged in a non-linear pattern;<br>
(e) applying the pattern to each base image;<br>
(f) selecting a mergable portion of each respective base image<br>
wherein the mergable portion corresponds to each region of each<br>
cell assigned to the respective base image;<br>
(g) consecutively merging only the selected mergable portions of each<br>
respective base image into the merged template in a non-<br>
overlapping manner to provide a single layer merged image; and<br>
one of a computer readable and/or a physical form;<br>
(h) forwarding the merged image to the end user for output in at least<br>
one of a computer readable and/or a physical form.<br>
According to this embodiment of the invention, the base images may preferably<br>
be forwarded to an image interrogation means or operator who may similarly<br>
forward the base images to a third party of the application of the process for the<br>
creation of the merged digital image. The image interrogation means may<br>
simply be a system or intermediary who may undertake extraneous actions such<br>
as checking the base images for suitability and size, but preferably the image<br>
interrogation means or intermediary does not apply the process for the creation<br>
of the merged digital image. At this stage, one or.................<br><br>
more image adjustment processes may be applied to any or all of the base images. For<br>
example, the images may have properties such as contrast, colour, brightness, or any<br>
other image property may be adjusted. For example, it is preferred that all base images<br>
are or the same size and resolution.<br>
The third party may suitably be a licensor of the technology and/or process<br>
and may selectively control access and use of the process through license agreements<br>
with at least one licensee. According to the license agreement, the third party/licensor<br>
may collect income in the form of licence or royalty payments from the licensees, based<br>
on parameters of the base images or merged image. For example, records may be<br>
maintained by the licensor of various parameters of the images produced by the process<br>
or those to which the process is applied. The parameters may include the type of image<br>
forwarded, the size of the base images and/or the merged image or input data. The<br>
dimensions of the images according to these parameters may be the basis for the<br>
calculation of the royalty or license fees.<br>
Various modes of transfer of both the base images and the merged image are<br>
anticipated. For example, usually after the application of the process to the base images,<br>
the third party may forward the merged image to the operator and the operator may<br>
forward the merged image on to the end user. However, the base images may be<br>
processed partly by the operator and partly by the third party, or entirely by the third<br>
party.<br>
The output of the merged image may also be selectively controllable. As<br>
stated earlier, the merged image may be adapted for printing, outputting to film or colour<br>
separations. The merged image may be maintained and transferred in digital format for<br>
example as a computer file. The image may be adapted to be transferred from the digital<br>
image form at the end of the process creating it into any other form which may be useable<br>
by the end user, operator and/or third party. The image may be reproduced in any hard or<br>
soft copy format.<br>
The operator may suitably create the output of the merged image or<br>
alternatively, the third party may create the output of the merged image and forward it to<br>
the operator.<br>
A major advantage of the present invention is that the merged images may be<br>
created from digital image files and processed into a final merged image output. In this<br>
may circumvent the need for an initial output in the form of photographic negatives or<br><br>
film and subsequent use of other expensive or complex devices to output and merged<br>
image into a predetermined size. With the above described process, single merged image<br>
output may be efficiently and economically created in a variety of sizes.<br>
Accordingly, if the above described process is used via a computer network<br>
based, a third party/licensor may be able to accurately track individual merged images<br>
and their designs and the quantity of base images and/or merged images output for a<br>
particular operator/licensee. This may allow the imposition of a royalty or license fee<br>
arrangement between the third party/licensor and the operator/licensee based on the<br>
dimensions of the base images and/or the single merged image produced.<br>
According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
each adapted image may be created by deleting or rendering digitally transparent, a<br>
number of cells and/or regions. The number of cells and/or regions deleted or rendered<br>
digitally transparent from each base image after the digital grid or pattern has been<br>
applied may be related to the number of base images to be merged. For example, if the<br>
number of base images to be merged is n, then the number of cells and/or regions deleted<br>
or rendered digitally transparent from each base image to create each respective adapted<br>
image is n-1. The deleted or digitally transparent cells and/or regions may be replaced<br>
with a transparent portion and the unaltered cells and/or regions of each base image<br>
remain as they were in the base image. The position of the cells and/or regions of the<br>
base image which arc to be deleted or rendered digitally transparent may depend at least<br>
upon the number oi'base images and the configuration of the merged image.<br>

Description Of The Preferred Embodiments<br>
With reference to Figure 1, a process for the creation of a merged digital<br>
image is there illustrated which exemplifies the present invention. The process illustrated<br>
in Figure 1 uses four base images and the pattern applied is a square grid illustrated in<br>
Figure la. It is to be understood that "pattern" as used throughout this specification is<br>
intended to mean anything fashioned or designed to serve as a model or guide for<br>
something to be made.<br>
The merged digital image 10 created according to the process illustrates<br>
that the adapted base images have been merged/flattened into a final image. The merged<br>
image is divided into cells and/or regions which are viewable to form the respective base<br>
images when the cells and/or regions of the other base images are obscured or otherwise<br>
prevented from exposure using a screen or grid. According to this example, the cells<br>
and/or regions of each of the base images are square as this is generally the most efficient<br>
shape for a 4 base image display system.<br>
The initial steps of the process are applied to each of four base images.<br>
The process may be applied to each base image consecutively or simultaneously. Once<br><br>
an end user has identified of at least two base images, the base images are prepared in a<br>
digital format. Preparation of the base images in digital format mainly comprises<br>
scanning the images into a computer file in one of the picture file formats if they are not<br>
already in this form. The base images all should be the same size and resolution.<br>
Each of the base images (not shown) are divided into a multiplicity of cells<br>
and/or regions illustrated in Figure 1 and identified using matrix coordinates. An adapted<br>
image is created corresponding to each base image wherein the cells and/or regions of the<br>
base image are deleted, rendered transparent, or otherwise selected, the position and<br>
number of the cells and/or regions deleted or rendered transparent being relative to the<br>
number of base images to be merged, and the cells and/or regions of each adapted image<br>
being offset from the cells and/or regions of each other respective base image.<br>
With particular reference to a first base image illustrated in Figure 1b, each<br>
adapted image of the respective base images 11, 12, 13 and 14 is created by deleting or<br>
rendering transparent a number of cells and/or regions simulating spacings which relate<br>
to the positions of cells and/or regions of the respective other base images in the merged<br>
image. Each base image has a horizontal aspect and vertical aspect. The deletion or<br>
rendering transparent of each of the cells and/or regions provides a transparent portion of<br>
the adapted image wherein every second column horizontally is transparent starting with<br>
the second column, as is every second row in a vertical aspect of the image starting with<br>
the second row. As can be seen from Figure 1b, the cells and/or regions of the first base<br>
image corresponding to cells and/or regions located in every second column starting with<br>
the second column have been deleted or rendered transparent so that after creating the<br>
adapted image of the first base image 11, these cells and/or regions appear as transparent.<br>
Similarly, the cells and/or regions of the first base image corresponding to<br>
cells and/or regions located at every second row starting with the second row have been<br>
deleted or rendered transparent so that after creating the adapted image of the first base<br>
image 11, these cells and/or regions appear as transparent. Similar transformations are<br>
performed on each of the other alternate rows of the first base image to form the adapted<br>
image of the first base image 11. The transformations are applied on a grid basis by<br>
retaining all of the cells and/or regions which the digital grid has numbered "1" and<br>
deleting all of the other cells and/or regions of the first base image.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 1c, the cells and/or regions of the second base<br>
image corresponding to cells and/or regions located in every second column starting with<br><br>
the first column have been deleted or rendered transparent so that after creating the<br>
adapted image of the second base image 12, these cells and/or regions appear as<br>
transparent.<br>
Similarly, the cells and/or regions of the second base image corresponding to<br>
cells and/or regions located in every second row starting with the second row have been<br>
deleted or rendered transparent so that after creating the adapted image of the second<br>
base image 12, these cells and/or regions appear as transparent. Similar transformations<br>
are performed on each of the other alternate rows and columns of the second base image<br>
to form the adapted image of the second base image 12. The deletion or rendering<br>
transparent of each cells and/or regions provides a transparent portion of the adapted<br>
image wherein every second column starting with the first column is transparent as is<br>
every second row of the image starting with the second row. The transformations arc<br>
applied on a grid basis by retaining all of the cells and/or regions which the digital grid<br>
has numbered "2" and deleting or rendering transparent all of the other cells and/or<br>
regions of the second base image.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 1d, the cells and/or regions of the third base<br>
image corresponding to cells and/or regions located in every second column starting with<br>
the first column have been deleted or rendered transparent so that after creating the<br>
adapted image of the third base image 13, these cells and/or regions appear as<br>
transparent.<br>
Similarly, the cells and/or regions of the third base image corresponding to<br>
cells and/or regions located in every second row starting with the first row have been<br>
deleted or rendered transparent so that after creating the adapted image of the third base<br>
image 13, these cells and/or regions appear as transparent. Similar transformations arc<br>
performed on each of the other alternate rows and columns of the third base image to<br>
form the adapted image of the third base image 13. The deletion or rendering transparent<br>
of each cells and/or regions provides a transparent portion of the adapted image wherein<br>
every second column starting with the first column is transparent as is every second row<br>
of the image starting with the first row. The transformations are applied on a grid basis by<br>
retaining all of the cells and/or regions which the digital grid has numbered "3" and<br>
deleting all of the other cells and/or regions of the third base image.<br>
The cells and/or regions of the fourth base image corresponding to cells<br>
and/or regions located in every second column starting with the second column have been<br><br>
deleted or rendered transparent so that after creating the adapted image of the fourth base<br>
image 14, these cells and/or regions appear as transparent.<br>
Similarly, the cells and/or regions of the fourth base image corresponding to<br>
cells and/or regions located in every second row starting with the first row have been<br>
deleted or rendered transparent so that after creating the adapted image of the fourth base<br>
image 14, these cells and/or regions appear as transparent. Similar transformations are<br>
performed on each of the other alternate rows and columns of the fourth base image to<br>
form the adapted image of the fourth base image 14. The deletion or rendering<br>
transparent of each cells and/or region provides a transparent portion of the adapted<br>
image wherein every second column starting with the second column is transparent as is<br>
every second row of the image starting with the first row. The transformations arc applied<br>
on a grid basis by retaining all of the cells and/or regions which the digital grid has<br>
numbered "4" and deleting all of the other cells and/or regions of the fourth base image.<br>
It is important to the working of the invention that a person skilled in the<br>
art will recognize that the transformations outlined above are representative<br>
transformations only for the particular embodiment. The transformations given above<br>
arc only applicable to the merging of four base images and the particular<br>
transformation of any one the four adapted images may be interchanged with the<br>
transformation of any of the remaining three adapted images. Different<br>
transformations are to be applied when dealing with different numbers of base images<br>
and the mathematical formulations of such transformations are identifiable by a<br>
person skilled in the art.<br>
Once the deletion of the sections has been accomplished or they have been<br>
rendered transparent, a transparent portion is then interposed between the cells and/or<br>
regions of each respective adapted image. The provision of a transparent portion in ail<br>
adapted images 11, 12, 13 and 14 allows the adapted images to be layered or laid one on<br>
top of the other without the overlap or obfuscation of any of the cells and/or regions of<br>
the respective adapted images. The layered images are then flattened or merged into the<br>
single merged image 10 as seen in Figure If, to be used in the display using a screen or<br>
grid as described above and in the prior art.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the process as described above to four base images but<br>
the pattern selected is on a circular grid basis.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the process as described above to four base images but<br><br>
the pattern selected is on a hexagonal grid basis.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the process as described above to three base images<br>
and the pattern selected is on a hexagonal grid basis. A different transformation of the<br>
base images during the process of creating the adapted images is applicable when three<br>
base images are used. A person skilled in the art can identify the transformations to be<br>
applied in these cases.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the process as described above to three base images<br>
but the division is performed on a rectangular bar grid basis. Again, a different<br>
transformation of the base images during the process of creating the partially deleted<br>
images is applicable when three base images are used. A person skilled in the art can<br>
identify the transformations to be applied in these cases.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates the process as described above to three base images<br>
but the pattern selected is on a waveform grid basis. Once again, a different<br>
transformation of the base images during the process of creating the adapted images is<br>
applicable when three base images are used. A person skilled in the art can identify the<br>
transformations to be applied in these cases.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates the process as described above to four base images but<br>
the pattern selected for each base image is a differently shaped grid. In this instance the<br>
positional deletions or transparencies used during the creation of the respective adapted<br>
images are similar to those used in the creation of any adapted image based on the<br>
merging of four base images. The significance of using base images divided into<br>
differently shaped cells and/or regions is mat the tolerance of the final merged image is<br>
not as tight as it would be with for example square cells and/or regions but would not be<br>
as loose as using circular cells and/or regions.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates a schematic view of a process according to a second<br>
aspect of the present invention wherein the process is adapted to be used over a computer<br>
network. The process comprises the steps of:<br>
a. at least one end user supplying at least two base images to an operator;<br>
b. the operator checking the base images for suitability and size;<br>
c. applying a process for the creation of a merged image; and<br>
d. forwarding the merged image to the end user.<br>
In this form, it is preferred that the process for the creation of the merged<br>
digital image in step (c) in the above computer network based process comprises the<br><br>
steps of:<br>
a. at least one end user supplying at least two base images to an operator;<br>
b. the operator checking the base images for suitability and size;<br>
c. preparing at least two base images in digital format;<br>
d. selecting a pattern wherein said pattern comprises a multiplicity of cells, each cell<br>
having n regions wherein n is the number of prepared base images and wherein each<br>
region of a cell is assigned to a different prepared base image;<br>
e. applying the pattern to each base image;<br>
f. selecting a mergable portion of each respective base image wherein the mergable<br>
portion includes a tile corresponding to the region of each cell assigned to the<br>
respective base image;<br>
g. merging of the mergable portions of each respective base image to provide a merged<br>
image; and<br>
h. forwarding the merged image to the end user.<br>
The computer network will generally be the Internet or other geographic<br>
or virtual computer network such as an intranet or the world wide web. The network will<br>
mainly be used for the convenience of transfer of files or images in digital formal.<br>
The process has the following general order of events. An end user<br>
uploads or otherwise forwards the required quantity of images to a licensed mosaic or<br>
merged image manufacturer. The licensed manufacturer then checks the images or<br>
digital files for suitability and size. The licensed manufacturer then forwards the<br>
approved images or files to a head office/server. The head office/server performs the<br>
merging process which is generally a fully automated process, wherein the files or images<br>
are merged into a single image ready for output. This single image or file is then sent<br>
back to the licensed manufacturer. The file is then forwarded through a hardware<br>
controller or dongle to the output device. Following output of the merged image the<br>
finished mosaic image is sent, generally with an invoice, to the end user. At<br>
predetermined times, the hardware controller will provide the head office with the<br>
quantity of images or files which have been output for a period. This may allow the head<br>
office to prepare and forward to the licensed manufacturer, an invoice for any royalty or<br>
licensees involved in the application of the process.<br>
The number of cells and/or regions deleted or rendered transparent from<br>
each base image after the digital grid has been applied may be related to the number of<br><br>
base images to be merged. For example, if the number of base images to be merged is n,<br>
then the number of regions deleted from or rendered transparent in each cell of each base<br>
image to create each respective adapted image is n-1. The deleted or transparent cells<br>
and/or regions may be replaced with a transparent portion and the unaffected cells and/or<br>
regions remain as they were in the base image. The position of the cells and/or regions of<br>
the base image which arc to be deleted or rendered transparent may depend at least upon<br>
the number of base images and the configuration of the merged image.<br>
Figure 9 illustrates the application of the distortion correction technique<br>
to the merged image. Figures 9a (parallelogram), 9c (radial) and 9e (waveform)<br>
shows example situations which may occur if an output device such as a printer or the<br>
like has an innate error which results in distortion of the merged mage when output.<br>
As may be appreciated, the distortion of a complex merged image may result in the<br>
image being unusable in a system for displaying the merged image. The present<br>
invention allows the application of a correction algorithm to the merged image or the<br>
file containing the merged image so that when output, the merged image is distortion<br>
free as illustrated in Figures 9b, 9d and 9f. The correction algorithm generally distorts<br>
the merged image digitally to account for the distortion which takes place during<br>
output of the image.<br>
The invention has been described in language more or less specific to<br>
structural or methodical features. It is to be understood that the invention is not limited<br>
to specific features shown or described since the means herein described comprises<br>
preferred forms of putting the invention into effect. The invention is, therefore, claimed<br>
