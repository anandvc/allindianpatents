				<td>Use of nanodispersions in cosmetic and formulations<br>
The present invention relates to the use of specific nanodispersions in cosmetic end formulations, to cosmetic end formulations comprising said nanodispersions and to the different cosmetic uses of these end formulations.<br>
Cosmetic preparations comprising, in addition to the basic substances responsible for forming the cosmetic formulations, other functional active agents. These are added to the cosmetic base formulations and are used, for example, for treatment, protection, colouring, cleansing, disinfection, for moisturising skin and for regenerating and activating skin or hair.<br>
In order for these substances to have an effect at the desired site, they must be transported to the respective site, for example to the skin surface, mucosae, nails, dental enamel or hair, but also to the epidermal and dermal areas of the skin, by means of so-called carrier and transport vehicles (carrier systems). To this purpose, many cosmetic active agents, for example water-soluble vitamins, the amino acid group or the water-soluble melanines, are encapsulated in liposomes. Owing to the properties of the liposomes, lipophilic substances can be encapsulated only in minor amounts in the lipophilic areas of the liposome membrane. For this reason, so-called nanoemulsions, also called nanoparticles, are used for such compounds, e.g, fat-soluble vitamins.<br>
Owing to the physical and chemical properties of the membranes and the membrane-forming molecules, the use of said carrier systems in conventional cosmetic formulations is severely limited.<br>
Conventionally structured membranes are highly susceptible to amphiphilic substances, such as ionogenic or non-ionogenic emulsifiers. fatty amines, amphoteric emulsifiers, detergent surfactants, thickeners or preservatives which form the basis for many cosmetic preparations or which are preserit as so-called active agents or excipients in cosmetic end formulations. The structure of the membranes changes in the presence of such substances, which may result in the destruction of the added carrier system during preparation.<br>
Customary membranes are also exposed to the attack of acids and bases. Thus, it is required, for example, that carrier systems containing phospholipids can only be used in the<br><br>
range of the so-called pH optimum of about pH 6.5. Lowering or raising of the pH results in<br><br>
the hydrolysis of the membrane-forming molecules.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that nanodispersions of suitable composition can. in the presence of amphiphilic substances, be incorporated into cosmetic end formulations over a wide pH range in very simple manner while retaining their morphological and physicochemi-cal properties.<br>
Accordingly, this invention relates to the use of a nanodispersion, which comprises<br>
(a)	a membrane-forming molecule,<br>
(b)	a coemulsifier and<br>
(c)	a lipophilic component,<br>
in cosmetic end formulations, the nanodispersion being obtainable by (a) mixing the components (a), (b) and (c) until a homogeneous clear liquid is obtained (so-called nanodispersion prephase), and<br>
(p) adding the liquid obtained in step (a) to the water phase of the cosmetic end formulations, wherein steps (a) and (P)are carried out without any additional supply of energy.<br>
Step (a) is usually carried out at room temperature, where necessary with heating and under normal pressure conditions. Mixing is carried out using standard stirring apparatus, for example propeller, angled paddle or magnetic agitators, and without using any special mechanical stirring aids.<br>
Components (a), (b) and (c) (= step (a)) are mixed in anhydrous medium, i.e. it is not necessary to add any water.<br>
Step (p) is carried out by adding the liquid obtained in step (a), the nanodispersion prephase, to the wafer phase of the cosmetic end formulations. The particular choice of components (a), (b) and (c) results directly in ultrafine, monodisperse nanodispersions. In this case it is possible to forego homogenisation via nozzle, rotor-stator or,ultrasound homogenisers, which is usually carried out to convert coarsely disperse or at least heterodisperse systems to fine monodisperse systems. Step (p) is thus characterised by the absence of high shear or cavitation forces.<br><br><br>
step (P) is usually carried out at room temperature, which is the range of the respective oil/water phase inversion temperature (PIT).<br>
The nanodispersions characterised by the process steps (a) and (P) contain particles having<br>
an average diameter of 
According to this invention, it is preferred to use a nanodispersion v\/hich contains.<br>

Component (c) is present in the nanodispersions used according to this invention in a concentration of preferably 0.1 to 80 % by weight, based on the total weight of components (a), (b) and (c).<br>
Components (a), (b) and (c) can be present in the nanodispersions used according to this invention as individual compounds or as mixtures of several different individual components.<br>
At least one component (a), (b) or (c) in the nanodispersion composition is usually a functional active agent used in cosmetics for treating or protecting the skin, mucosae and hair.<br>
The nanodispersion used according to this invention optionally comprises as facultative component (d) a solubilising agent, preferably a C2-C8alcohol. such as ethanol or propylene glycol.<br>
A nanodispersion containing the components (a), (b), (c) and optionally (d) is distinguished by favourable phase properties of the solubilised functional cosmetic agent. Thus if there is opalescence and transparency in incident light, only a very slight turbidity shows that the dispersion is physically still different from the ideal state of a genuine molecular solution. Electron microscopic images show that a population of more than 98 % is present in a Gaussian distribution as a suspension of particles (nanoparticles) having a particle size of less than about 50 nm, typically of less than about 30 nm. However, these distinctions from a genuine solution can be tolerated because of the particularly good homogeneity properties of the dispersion which can be evidenced, for example, by a surprisingly high storage stability, e.g. no separation after storing for several months at temperatures of up to room temperature (stability to be expected by extrapolation: more than two years).<br><br>
Laser light scattering measurements and electron microscopic analysis (Cryo-TEM) confirm the very small size and excellent homogeneity of the nanoparticles present in the nanodispersion.<br>
Another advantage of the nanodispersions used according to this invention is that they are easy to prepare.<br>
The nanodispersions pharacterised by claim 1 are used according to this invention for cosmetic end formulations.<br>
This invention also relates to the so-called nanodispersion prephase characterised in step (a), which is obtainable by mixing the components<br>
(a)	membrane-forming molecules.<br>
(b)	coemulsifier.<br>
(c)	lipophilic component and. optionally,<br>
(d)	a C2-C8alcohol, preferably propylene glycol and, more preferably, ethanol<br>
until a homogeneous clear liquid is obtained, mixing being carried out in anhydrbus medium.<br>
These nanodispersion prephases can likewise be directly used in accordance with this invention for cosmetic end formulations.<br>
Cosmetic end formulations include a very wide range of cosmetic products. Suitable products are, for example, especially the following:<br>
skin-care products, for example skin washing and cleansing products in the form of bars<br>
of soap or liquid soaps, syndets or washing pastes,<br>
bath products, for example liquid (foam baths, milks, shower products) or solid bath<br>
products, such as bath pearls and bath salts;<br>
skin-care products, such as skin emulsions, multiple emulsions or skin oils;<br>
decorative body-care products, for example face make-ups in the form of day or powder<br>
creams, face powders (lose and compressed), rouge or cream make-ups, eye-care<br>
products, for example eye shadow products, mascara, eyeliners, eye creams or eye-fix<br>
creams; lip-care products, for example lipstick, lip gloss, lip liner, nail-care products,<br>
such as nail varnish, nail varnish remover, nail hardeners or cuticle removers;<br>
feminine hygiene products, such as feminine hygiene washing lotions or sprays;<br><br>
foot-care products, for example foot baths, foot powders, food creams or foot balms, special deodorants and antiperspirants or products for scrubbing off callouses; sunscreens, such as sun milks, lotions, creams, oils, sunblockers or tropicals, pre-sun products or after-sun products; suntanning products, for example self-tanning creams; depigmenting products, for example products for bleaching or lightening skin; insect repellents, for example insect oils, lotions, sprays or sticks; deodorants, for example deodorant sprays, non-aerosol sprays, deodorant gels, sticks or roll-ons;<br>
antiperspirants, for example antiperspirant sticks, creams or roll-ons; products for cleansing and treating impure skin, for example syndets (solid or liquid), peeling or scrubbing products or peeling masks;<br>
chemical depilatory products, for example depilatory powders, liquid depilatory products, creamy or pasty depilatory products, depilatory gels or aerosol foams; shaving products, for example shaving soap, foaming shaving creams, non-foaming shaving creams, shaving foams and gels, preshaving products for dry shaving, aftershaves or aftershave lotions;<br>
scents, for example perfumes (Eau de Cologne, Eau de Toilette, Eau de Parfum, Parfum de Toilette, perfume), perfume oils or perfume creams; products for oral and dental hygiene as well as for dentures, for example toothpastes, tooth gels, tooth powders, mouth-wash concentrates, anti-plaque mouth-washes, denture cleaning products or denture adhesion products;<br>
cosmetic formulations for hair treatment, for example hair washes in the form of shampoos, hair conditioners, hair-care products, for example pretreatment products, hair tonics, hair styling creams and gels, pomades, hair rinses, deep conditioning treatments, intensive hair care treatments, hair setting products, for exarhple waving agents for perms (hot wav6, mild wave, cold wave), hair straightening products, liquid hair fixatives, hair foams, hair sprays, bleaching agents, for example hydrogen peroxide solutions, bleaching shampoos, bleaching creams, bleaching powders, bleaching pastes or oils, temporary, semitemporary or permanent hair dyes, products containing self-oxidising dyes, or natural hair dyes, such as henna or camomile.<br>
The end formulations listed above can be in a very wide range of forms of presentation, for example<br><br>
-	in the form of liquid formulations as an OA/V emulsion,<br>
-	in the form of a gel,<br>
-	in the form of an oil. cream, milk or lotion,<br>
-	in the form of a powder, lacquer, pellets or make-up,<br>
-	in the form of a stick,<br>
-	in the form of a spray (spray with propellant or non-aerosol spray) or an aerosol,<br>
-	in the form of a foam, or<br>
-	in the form of a paste.<br>
The liquid and semisolid forms of presentation in this case contain the nanodispersion with the components (a), (b) and (c) in the aqueous phase, and one or several of the above functional cosmetic active agent(s). Solid forms of presentation contain the nanodispersion in the dehydrated form, the dehydration of the nanodispersion usually being carried out by freeze-drying or spray-drying in the presence of customary auxiliaries. For some end formulations it is advantageous to replace the nanodispersion with the corresponding nano-dispersions prephase.<br>
Emulsions are heterogeneous systems consisting of two liquids (phases) which are not, or only partly, miscibte with each other. One phase is present in the form of droplets (dispersed or inner phase), whereas the other forms a continuous phase as a liquid. In the case of an OA/V emulsion, which is basically characterised by water, oil droplets are finely dispersed in water.<br>
Creams are usually spreadable in the temperature range from room to skin temperature, whereas lotions or milks tend to be pourable.<br>
Gels are semisolid, more or less transparent systems in which the so-called gel former forms a three-dimensional network in which a liquid is immobilised. The clear to opaque hydrogels consist primarily of water, water-soluble substances and thickeners or get formers. If lipids are additionally incorporated, the slightly creamy-looking hydrodispersion gels are obtained. In contrast, the oleogels are free of water and contain lipids as liquid components.<br>
The cosmetic end formulation containing one or several of the above ingredients which may be in the form of the above-mentioned forms of presentation, contains the nanodispersion<br><br>
used according to this invention preferably in a concentration of 0.01 to 100. preferably of 0,01 to 20.0, more preferably of 0.05 to 5 % by weight.<br>
These end formulations are another subject matter of this invention.<br>
The end formulations in this case contain the nanodispersion in their aqueous phase in a concentration of 0.01 to 20.0, preferably of 0.05 to 10 and, more preferably of 0.1 to 5 % by weight.<br>
The end formulation used according to this invention can also contain other components, for example emollients, emulsion stabilisers, skin moisturisers. suntanning accelerators, thickeners, such as xanthane. moisture retention agents, such as glycerol, preservatives, such as parabene, antioxidants, as well as fragrances and colourants.<br>
The basic formulations for the cosmetic end formulations according to Examples 14 to 21 are prepared in accordance with the instructions in "Kosmetik; Entwicklung. Herstellung und Anwendung kosmetischer Mittel" (Ed.: W. Umbach, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, New York) and with the documentations from "DGK Fortbildungskurs 1998, Entwicklung moder-ner Hautpflegemittel".<br>
The end formulations are prepared by the customary known methods, some of which are described in the above literature. In the case of liquid and semisolid end formulations, the nanodispersions are always incorporated into the aqueous phase of the end formulations. To this purpose, they are taken up in a small proportion of the aqueous phase and are added, as active agent phase, as last phase during the preparation of a formulation at about 20 to 30°C. It is also possible to add instead of the nanodispersion the correspondirig nanodispersion prophase to the water phase of the end formulation. He nanodispersion prophase is added to the water phase with stirring and preferably at a temperature in the range of the respective oil/water phase inversion temperature (PIT).<br>
In the case of solid end formulations it is advantageous to admix the dehydrated form of the nanodispersion to the solid substance mixture.<br><br>
The cosmetic end formulation is preferably used for the treatment and protection of skin, mucosae or hair and, very particularly, as sunscreen or as an after-sun preparation.<br>
The nanodispersions used according to this invention can also be used as transport vehicles for oil-soluble dyes.<br>
In another of its aspects, this invention thus relates to the use of the nanodispersion defined in claim 1 as carrier system for oil-soluble dyes.<br>
Suitable dyes are of synthetic or also of natural origin and are composed from all known<br>
chromophores, for example azo, azoic, anthraquinone. caratenoid, quinoline, xanthene,<br>
diarylmethane, triarylfnethane. stilbene. indigoid, phtalocyanine, nitro dyes as well as all<br>
j other known chromophores, such as are also listed in Colour Index under C111000 to<br>
CI 77999.<br>
Of these dyes, those are particularly interesting which are at least partially soluble in organic media such as oils. This includes, for example, those dyes which are called solvent dyes or disperse dyes, the disperse dyes also including the group of the unloaded, directly absorbing hair dyes, for example derivatives of nitrobenzene or of nitrodiphenylamine.<br>
Examples of solvent dyes which may be used in accordance with this inventiort are: Solvent Black 3 (Cas-No.: 4197-25-5); Solvent Black 5 (Cas-No.: 11099-03-9); Solvent Blue 35 (Cas-No.: 12769-17-4); Solvent Green 3; Solvent Green 7 (Cas-No.: 6358-69-6); Solvent Orange 1 (Cas-No.: 2051-85-6); Solvent Red 24 (Cas-No.: 85-83-6); Solvent Red 43 (Cas-No.: 15086-94-9); Solvent Red 48 (Cas-No.: 13473-26-2); Solvent Red 49:1 (Cas-No.: 6373-07-5); Solvent Red 72 (Cas-No.: 596-03-2); Solvent Yellow 44 (CAS No.: 2478-20-8); Solvent Yellow 18 (CAS No.: 6407-76-9).<br>
Examples of disperse dyes which may be used in accordance with this invention are: Disperse Black 9 (CAS No.: 12222-60-4); Disperse Blue 1 (CAS Nos.: 2475-45-8); Disperse Blue 3 (CAS No.: 2475-46-9); Disperse Brown 1 (CAS No.: 23355-64-8); Disperse Orange 3 (CAS No.: 730-40-5); the compound of formula<br><br><br><br><br>
i<br>
The nanodispersions used according to this invention can have the following functions:<br>
-	being carriers for allowing dyes to penetrate through certain potential walls into media such<br>
as skin, hair or nails;<br>
-	protecting the dyes from other ingredients of a formulation (or vice versa, protecting the<br>
formulation from another dyes), for example in order to eliminate incompatibilities between<br>
formulation and solid. The dye is then separated in the core of the nanodispersion from the<br><br>
remainder of the formulation. Thus it is possible to prevent chain reactions with other ingredients which reactions are photo-initiated by the dye;<br>
- introducing dyes which are only soluble in oil phases into aqueous systems and stabilising them. The dye is then dissolved in the core of the nanodispersion (oil phase) and the nanodispersion particle is in turn dispersed in the aqueous phase.<br>
In the following Examples, percentages are by weight. Unless otherwise stated, amounts of compounds used are based on the pure substance.<br><br>
