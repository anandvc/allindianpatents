GROWTH FACTOR-BINDING COMPOUNDS AND METHODS OF USE<br>
Cross-Reference to Related Application<br>
The present application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No.<br>
60/539,613, filed January 27, 2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in<br>
its entirety, including any figures, tables, nucleic acid sequences, amino acid sequences,<br>
and drawings.<br>
The subject invention was made with government support under a research project<br>
supported by National Institute of Health/National Cancer Institute Grant No. CA78038.<br>
The federal government may have certain rights in this invention.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The ability of tumors to grow beyond a few cubic millimeters in volume depends<br>
on the formation of new blood vessels within the microenvironment of the tumors<br>
(Ferrara, N. Nat Rev Cancer, 2002, 2:795-803; Kerbel, R.S. Carcinogenesis, 2000,<br>
21:505-15; Carmeliet, P. and Jain, R.K. Nature, 2000, 407:249-57; Yancopoulos, G.D. et<br>
al. Nature, 2000, 407:242-8). This angiogenic process is triggered by several key growth<br>
factors that are secreted by the tumor. The growth factors not only bind their receptors on<br>
endothelial cells and stimulate their proliferation initiating new blood vessel formation,<br>
but also bind receptors on accessory cells such as pericytes that maintain vessel integrity<br>
(Ferrara, N. Nat Rev Cancer, 2002, 2:795-803; Kerbel, R.S. Carcinogenesis, 2000,<br>
21:505-15; Carmeliet, P. and Jain, R.K. Nature, 2000, 407:249-57; Yancopoulos, G.D. et<br>
al. Nature, 2000, 407:242-8; Helmlinger, G., et al. NatMed, 1997, 3:177-82; Holash, J. et<br>
al. Science, 1999, 284:1994-8). Among the most studied growth factors are vascular<br>
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Several<br>
studies have demonstrated the participation of these two growth factors in the angiogenic<br>
process with VEGF playing a key role mainly in the initiation of the formation of new<br>
blood vessels and PDGF being involved in the maintenance of these vessels (Bergers, G.<br>
et al. J Clin Invest, 2003, 111:1287-95; Dvorak, H.F. J Clin Oncol, 2002, 20:4368-80;<br>
Ferrara, N. Curr Top Microbiol Immunol, 1999, 237:1-30; Dvorak, H.F. et al. Curr Top<br>
Microbiol Immunol, 1999, 237:97-132; Eriksson, U. and Alitalo, K. Curr Top Microbiol<br>
Immunol, 1999, 237:41-57).<br>
This observation prompted an interest in designing strategies to suppress the<br>
functions of VEGF and PDGF, with the ultimate goal of inhibiting angiogenesis and<br>
starving tumors. The approaches that have been taken were based on targeting the<br>
biochemical steps involved in the mechanism of action of these growth factors. These<br>
include inhibiting the binding of VEGF and PDGF to their respective receptors by using<br>
antibodies against the growth factors. One of these, AVASTIN, which targets VEGF, has<br>
recently been approved for clinical use in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer<br>
(Zhang, W. et al, Angiogenesis, 2002, 5:35-44; Ferrara, N. Semin Oncol, 2002, 29:10-4).<br>
Another approach has involved the development of inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase<br>
activities of the PDGF and VEGF receptors, resulting in suppression of the downstream<br>
signal transduction pathways triggered by these growth factors (Kerbel, R.S.<br>
Carcinogenesis, 2000, 21:505-15; Jain, R.K. Semin Oncol, 2002, 29:3-9; Morin, M.J.<br>
Oncogene, 2000, 19:6574-83; Miao, R.Q. et al. Blood, 2002, 100:3245-52; Laird, A.D. et<br>
al. Cancer Res, 2000, 60:4152-60; Wedge, S.R. et al. Cancer Res, 2000, 60:970-5). Most<br>
of these agents mimic the structure of ATP and some are potent antitumor agents that are<br>
presently in clinical trials. However, none have been approved yet by the FDA.<br>
The approval by the FDA of AVASTIN (bevacizumab), which increases by 5<br>
months the median survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, further validates<br>
targeting angiogenic processes as a strategy to treat cancer (Ferrara, N. Semin Oncol,<br>
2002, 29:10-4). However, much more needs to be done to fully exploit this approach.<br>
For example, in other clinical trials, AVASTIN failed to prolong the lives of patients with<br>
metastatic breast cancer. One possible explanation for this inconsistent activity is that<br>
advanced metastatic breast cancer may circumvent anti-VEGF angiogenesis therapy by<br>
means of other growth factors. Indeed support for this suggestion comes from preclinical<br>
studies showing that early breast cancer secretes mainly VEGF whereas advanced breast<br>
cancer secretes additional growth factors (Relf, M. et al. Cancer Res, 1997, 57:963-9).<br>
Furthermore, in an animal pancreatic cancer model, SU5416, a VEGF receptor tyrosine<br>
kinase inhibitor suppresses early, but not late, development of pancreatic tumors. More<br>
importantly in the same model, treatment with SU6668 (which inhibits both VEGF and<br>
PDGF receptor tyrosine kinases) induced regression of advanced pancreatic tumor at late<br>
stage of development (Bergers, G. et al. J Clin Invest, 2003, 111:1287-95) suggesting that<br>
the failure of anti-VEGF therapy may be due to its ability to inhibit only initiation but not<br>
maintenance of blood vessels. Further support for this suggestion comes from a very<br>
recent study where AVASTIN inhibited the formation of new blood vessels but was<br>
ineffective at inhibiting already established ones in an animal model where<br>
neuroblastoma cells were transplanted onto mouse kidneys (Huang, J. et al. Proc Natl<br>
Acad Sci USA, 2003, 100:7785-90). Taken together, the present understanding of the<br>
angiogenesis process suggests that simultaneously targeting of growth factors that initiate<br>
(i.e., VEGF) as well as those that maintain (i.e., PDGF) blood vessels may be a more<br>
effective approach to cancer therapy than targeting only one growth factor.<br>
Brief Summary of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the subject invention to design a family of compounds that bind<br>
VEGF and/or PDGF and inhibit the binding of these growth factors to their respective cell<br>
surface receptors. For example, the compound GFB204, was found to be a potent and<br>
selective inhibitor of VEGF- and PDGF-stimulation of their receptor tyrosine kinase<br>
phosphorylation and signaling (Erkl/2, Akt and STATS). This pharmacological agent<br>
also potently inhibited endothelial cell migration and capillary network formation in vitro<br>
as well as in vivo blood vessel formation and human tumor growth in nude mouse<br>
xenografts.<br>
It is a further object of the subject invention to provide pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of the above-referenced family of compounds and methods of administering<br>
the same.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Figure 1 shows structures of GFB204 of the present invention, which have<br>
acyclic isophthalic acid groups attached to a non-peptide organic scaffold as well as GFB-<br>
111.<br>
Figures 2A-2C show that GFB204 inhibits 125I-VEGF and'25I-PDGF but not 125IEGF<br>
binding to their receptors in mouse fibroblasts. Flk-1/NIH 3T3, NIH 3T3 and<br>
EGFR/NIH 3T3 cells were incubated with 125I-VEGF, 125I-PDGF and 125I-EGF (50,000<br>
cpm/well) respectively, along with increasing concentrations of GFB204. Cells were<br>
incubated at 4°C for 0.5 hours, then washed three times with PBS and three times with<br>
lysis buffer prior to determining 125I counts as described under Materials and Methods.<br>
An excess of cold VEGF, PDGF, and EGF was used to obtain non-specific binding<br>
levels. Figures 2A-2C show specific binding (% control) for PDGFR, Flk-1, and EGFR,<br>
respectively.<br>
Figures 2D and 2E illustrate that GFB-204 binds PDGF and VEGF as indicated<br>
by growth factor tryptophan when increased amounts of GFB204 were added to PDGF<br>
and VEGF, respectively. The fluorescence was monitored by excitation at 295 nm and<br>
228 nm, respectively, and emission at 334 nm.<br>
Figures 3A and 3B show the effect of GFB204 on growth factor stimulated Erkl,<br>
Erk2, Akt, and STAT3 phosphorylation. GFB204 inhibits VEGF and PDGF stimulation<br>
of Flk-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and Erkl/Erk2 phosphorylation (Figure 3A). NIH 3T3<br>
cells or Flk-1/NIH 3T3 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of GFB204 for 5<br>
minutes prior to stimulation with PDGFBB (lOng/ml) or VEGF (50ng/ml), respectively,<br>
for 10 minutes. The cells were then lysed and processed for SDS-PAGE Western blotting<br>
with an antibody specific for phosphotyrosine-Flk-1 or anti-phosphotyrosine for PDGFR<br>
tyrosine phosphorylation or phospho-Erkl/2. GFB204 effects on growth factorstimulated<br>
Erkl, Erk2, Akt and STATS phosphorylation (Figure 3B). NIH 3T3, Flk-<br>
1/NIH 3T3, IGF-IR/NIH 3T3 or EGFR/NIH 3T3 cells were treated with GFB204 (lO^M)<br>
prior to stimulation with PDGF (NIH 3T3) VEGF (Flk-1/NIH 3T3), EGF (EGFR/NIH<br>
3T3), bFGF (NIH 3T3) or IGF-1 (IGF-IR/NIH 3T3). The cells were then harvested and<br>
processed for SDS-PAGE Western blotting with antibodies specific for phospho-Erkl/2,<br>
phospho-Akt and phospho-STAT3.<br>
Figures 4A-4C show the effects of GFB204 on angiogenesis in vitro. GFB204<br>
inhibits capillary network formation in a dose-response manner (Figure 4C). Human<br>
middle cerebral artery endothelial cells (5xl04) were seeded onto Matrigel and the cells<br>
were incubated with VEGF in the presence (Figure 4B) or absence (Figure 4A) of<br>
GFB204 as described under Materials and Methods.<br>
Figures 5A-5C illustrates that GFB204 potently inhibits VEGF-dependent human<br>
brain endothelial cell migration in vitro. Migration of adult human brain endothelial cells<br>
was evaluated using a modified Boyden chamber assay as described in Materials and<br>
Methods. Vehicle control (Figure 5A) or GFB204 (Figure 5B) was added to 2% FBScontaining<br>
medium in the outer chamber, and the number of migrated cells to the VEGFcontaining<br>
lower chamber was determined after an 18-hour incubation (Figure 5C).<br>
Figure 6 illustrates that GFB204 inhibits A-549 xenografts growth in nude mice<br>
(Figure 6). A-549 cells were implanted into the flanks of nude mice and when the tumors<br>
reached an average size of about 100 mm3, the mice were randomized and treated either<br>
with vehicle or GFB204 at Img/kg  and 5mg/kg, and tumor sizes measured as<br>
described under Materials and Methods. Tumors were processed two hours after the last<br>
i.p. injection for CD31 IHC staining as described under Materials and Methods.<br>
Figures 7A-7B illustrates CD31 IHC staining as described under Materials and<br>
Methods for tumors processed two hours after the last i.p. injection for a control (Figure<br>
7A) and GFB204 (Figure 7B). Quantification of microvessels density (400X) was<br>
determined as described under Materials and Methods. SE, standard error. Figures 7A<br>
and 7B Microvessel Count; Fig. 7A = 11.3 ± 1.9; Fig. 7B = 2.6 ± 0.9.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Inhibition of growth factor-dependent receptor tyrosine phosphorvlation by GFBs.<br>
Starved Flk-1/KDR-overexpressing NIH 3T3 cells (Flk-1/NIH 3T3) or NIH 3T3 cells<br>
were pretreated with GFBs for 5 min before stimulation with VEGF (50ng/ml) or PDGFBB<br>
(10 ng/ml) for 10 min, respectively. The cells were then harvested and lysed, and<br>
proteins from the lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose.<br>
Membranes then were either immunoblotted with anti-phospho-VEGFR2 antibody (Cell<br>
Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA) for activated Flk-1 or anti-phospho-tyrosine<br>
antibody (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) for activated PDGFR.<br>
Phosphotyrosine Flk-1 and PDGFR were quantified using a Bio-Rad Model GS-700<br>
Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc, Hercules, CA) (Blaskovich, M.A. et<br>
al. Nat Biotechnol, 2000, 18:1065-70).<br>
Growth factor-mediated stimulation of phosphorvlation of Erkl/2. Akt and<br>
STAT3. Starved NIH 3T3 cells (PDGF-BB, bFGF), NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing EGFR<br>
(EGFR/NIH 3T3, EGF), Flk-1 (Flk-1/NIH 3T3, VEGF), and IGF-1R NIH 3T3 (IGF-<br>
1R/NIH 3T3, IGF-1) were pretreated with the indicated concentration of GFB204 for 5<br>
minutes before 10 minute stimulation with PDGF-BB (lOng/ml), EGF (lOOng/ml), bFGF<br>
(50ng/ml), VEGF (50ng/ml) and IGF-1 (50ng/ml). Cell lysates were run on SDS-PAGE<br>
gels, then transferred to nitrocellulose and Western blotted with anti-phosphorylated<br>
Erkl/Erk2 (Cell Signaling Technologies) anti-phosphorylated Akt or anti-phosphorylated<br>
STATS as described previously by us (Blaskovich, M.A. et al. Cancer Res, 2003,<br>
63:1270-9).<br>
Binding of I25l-growth factors to their receptors. The binding assay of 125I-VEGF,<br>
125I-PDGF and I25I-EGF to their respective receptors was carried out as described<br>
previously (Blaskovich, M.A. etal. Nat Biotechnol, 2000, 18:1065-70. Briefly, Flk-1/NIH<br>
3T3 cells, NIH 3T3 cells and EGFR/NIH 3T3 cells were incubated with I25I-VEGF, I25IPDGF<br>
and 125I-EGF (50,000 cpm/well), respectively, and increasing concentrations of<br>
GFB204. Cells were incubated at 4°C for 0.5 hours, then washed three times with PBS<br>
and three times with 25mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Triton-X-100, 10% glycerol, and 1% SDS<br>
prior to determining I25I counts on a gamma counter (Beckmann Inc.). An excess of cold<br>
growth factors were used to obtain nonspecific binding levels.<br>
Capillary network formation. 200 ul of Matrigel was placed into each well of a<br>
24-well culture plate at 4°C and allowed to polymerize by incubation at 37°C as described<br>
previously (Papadimitriou, E. et al. Biochem Biophys Res Commun, 2001, 282:306-13).<br>
Human middle cerebral artery endothelial cells (5xl04) were seeded on the Matrigel in 1<br>
ml of EBM containing VEGF (20ng/ml). The cells were incubated in the presence or<br>
absence of GFB204 at the concentrations indicated in the figure legend. Each sample was<br>
photographed using a 10X objective lens, and quantified the total length of tube structures<br>
in each photograph using the Image Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetic, Inc., MD).<br>
Human brain endothelial cell migration assay. Migration of adult human brain<br>
endothelial cells was evaluated using a modified Boyden chamber assay (BD BioCoat<br>
Matrigel Invasion Chamber) (Papadimitriou, E. et al. Biochem Biophys Res Commun,<br>
2001, 282:306-13). The cells were plated at 4xl04/ml onto an 8 \an pore size membrane<br>
coated with a thin layer of Matrigel basement membrane matrix. GFB204 was added to<br>
the medium in the outer chamber and the cells were cultured for 18 hours under VEGFdependent<br>
condition in the lower chamber (VEGF 20ng/ml). Non-invading cells were<br>
removed from the upper surface with a cotton swab. Membrane inserts were then fixed<br>
with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with Crystal-Violet dye. The number of cells that<br>
migrated to the undersurface of the filters, was quantified by counting the cells migrated<br>
in randomly selected microscopic fields (10X). Samples were analyzed for significant<br>
differences using a Student's t-test for independent samples.<br>
Antitumor activity in the nude mouse tumor xenograft model. Nude mice (Charles<br>
River, Wilmington, MA) were maintained in accordance with the Institutional Animal<br>
Care and Use Committee (IACUC) procedures and guidelines. A-549 cells were<br>
harvested and resuspended in PBS, then injected s.c. into the right and left flanks (10 x<br>
106 cells per flank) of 8 week old female nude mice as reported previously (Sun, J. et al.<br>
Cancer Res, 1999, 59:4919-26). When tumors reached about 100 mm3, animals were<br>
dosed i.p. with 0.2 ml solution once daily. Control animals received a vehicle whereas<br>
treated animals were injected with GFB204 (1 or 5 mg/kg/day). The tumor volumes were<br>
determined by measuring the length (1) and the width (w) and calculating the volume<br>
(V=lw2/2) as described previously (Sun, J. et al. Cancer Res, 1999, 59:4919-26).<br>
Statistical significance between control and treated animals were evaluated using<br>
Student's Mest.<br>
IHC study. On the termination day of antitumor experiments, the tumors were<br>
extracted and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 6 hours. After fixation, the<br>
tissue samples were processed into paraffin blocks. Tissue sections (4(jm thick) were<br>
obtained from the parablocks and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) using<br>
standard histological techniques. Tissue sections were also subjected to immunostaining<br>
for CD31 (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) using the avidin biotin peroxidase complex<br>
technique (Blaskovich, M.A. et al. Nat Biotechnol, 2000, 18:1065-70). Mouse<br>
monoclonal antibody was used at 1:50 dilution, following microwave antigen retrieval<br>
(four cycles of 5 minutes each on high in 0.1M citrate buffer).<br>

peptides, growth factors, antibiotics, bacteriostatic agents, immunosuppressives,<br>
anticoagulants, buffering agents, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-pyretics, time-release<br>
binders, anesthetics, steroids and corticosteroids.<br>
Preferably, the administering is carried out orally, parenterally, subcutaneously,<br>
intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, intraarterially, transdermally or via a<br>
mucus membrane.<br>
The term "cancer" is intended to mean any cellular malignancy whose unique trait<br>
is the loss of normal controls which results in unregulated growth, lack of differentiation<br>
and ability to invade local tissues and metastasize. Cancer can develop in any tissue of<br>
any organ. More specifically, cancer is intended to include, without limitation, prostate<br>
cancer, leukemia, hormone dependent cancers, breast cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer,<br>
epidermal cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, cancer of the brain,<br>
and cancer of the kidney.<br>
The terms "treatment", "treating" and the like are intended to mean obtaining a<br>
desired pharmacologic and/or physiologic effect, e.g., inhibition of cancer cell growth or<br>
induction of apoptosis of a cancer cell. The effect may be prophylactic in terms of<br>
completely or partially preventing a disease or symptom thereof and/or may be<br>
therapeutic in terms of a partial or complete cure for a disease and/or adverse effect<br>
attributable to the disease. "Treatment" as used herein covers any treatment of a disease<br>
in a mammal, particularly a human, and includes: (a) preventing a disease or condition<br>
(e.g., preventing cancer) from occurring in an individual who may be predisposed to the<br>
disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (b) inhibiting the disease, (e.g.,<br>
arresting its development); or (c) relieving the disease (e.g., reducing symptoms<br>
associated with the disease).<br>
The term "anti-cancer activity" is intended to mean an activity which is able to<br>
substantially inhibit, slow, interfere, suppress, prevent, delay and/or arrest a cancer and/or<br>
a metastasis thereof (such as initiation, growth, spread, and/or progression thereof of such<br>
cancer and/or metastasis).<br>
The terms "administering", "administration", and "contacting" are intended to<br>
mean a mode of delivery including, without limitation, oral, rectal, parenteral,<br>
subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intraarterial, transdermally or<br>
via a mucus membrane. The preferred one being orally. Administration may be carried<br>
out locally, at a target site(s), or systemically. One skilled in the art recognizes that<br>
suitable forms of oral formulation include, but are not limited to, a tablet, a pill, a capsule,<br>
a lozenge, a powder, a sustained release tablet, a liquid, a liquid suspension, a gel, a<br>
syrup, a slurry, a suspension, and the like. For example, a daily dosage can be divided<br>

times throughout a time period.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective" is intended to mean an amount of a<br>
compound of the invention sufficient to substantially improve some symptom associated<br>
with a disease or a medical condition. For example, in the treatment of cancer, a<br>
compound which decreases, prevents, delays, suppresses, or arrests any symptom of the<br>
disease would be therapeutically effective. A therapeutically effective amount of a<br>
compound is not required to cure a disease but will provide a treatment for a disease such<br>
that the onset of the disease is delayed, hindered, or prevented, or the disease symptoms<br>
are ameliorated, or the term of the disease is changed or, for example, is less severe or<br>
recovery is accelerated in an individual.<br>
The term "independently" is intended to mean that each of the four Rl<br>
substituents and each of the four R2 substiruents of the growth factor binding compounds<br>
of the present invention may each be the same substituent or may each be a different<br>
substituent.<br>
When the compounds of this invention are administered in combination therapies<br>
with other agents, they may be administered sequentially or concurrently to an individual.<br>
Alternatively, pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention may be<br>
comprised of a combination of a compound of the present invention, as described herein,<br>
and another therapeutic or prophylactic agent known in the art.<br>

the active ingredient, its use in therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary<br>
active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions. The pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of the subject invention can be formulated according to known methods for<br>
preparing pharmaceutically useful compositions. Formulations are described in a number<br>

Example 1—Identification of GFB204. a calixarene derivative that potently inhibits<br>
VEGF and PDGF-stimulation of Flk-1 and PDGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation.<br>
The initial approach to disrupt biologically significant protein-protein interactions<br>
such as those involving growth factors with their receptors, consisted of designing<br>
molecules that contained four synthetic peptide loops attached to a calix[4]arene scaffold<br>
(Figure 1, reaction (a)) (Blaskovich, M.A. et al. Nat Biotechnol, 2000, 18:1065-70). The<br>
peptide loop components were based on a cyclic hexapeptide in which two residues are<br>
replaced by the dipeptide mimetic 3-aminomethylbenzoate modified with a 5-amino<br>
group to provide linkage to the calixarene cavity. This design allowed the synthesis of a<br>
library of calixarene derivatives having different peptide sequences in the loops and large<br>
surface areas capable of binding protein surfaces. One of the library members, GFB111,<br>
bound PDGF and blocked its binding to PDGFR at subfiM concentrations and selectively<br>
relative to other growth factors (Blaskovich, M.A. et al. Nat Biotechnol, 2000, 18:1065-<br>
70). The four peptide loops in GFB111 contained negative and hydrophobic residues in<br>
the sequence GDGY (Figure 1, reaction (a)), which match well with the positive and<br>
hydrophobic amino acids in loops I, II and III of the homodimeric PDGF, which are<br>
critical for binding to PDGFR (Oefner, C. et al. Embo J, 1992, 11:3921-6; Andersson, M.<br>
et al. Growth Factors, 1995, 12:159-64). GFB111 and similar compounds are described<br>
in U.S. Published Application No. US 2003/0118589, filed March 21, 2001, and<br>
International Published Application No. WO 01/70930, filed March 21, 2001, which are<br>
incorporated by reference in their entirety, including all figures and tables. To improve<br>
this design, a second-generation library has been designed in which in place of the<br>
peptide loops simple, acyclic isophthalic acid groups functionalized with a wide range of<br>
acidic and hydrophobic groups (Ri and R2j Figure 1, reaction (b); and Table 1) are<br>
attached to the calix[4] arene scaffold.<br>
To evaluate this library for molecules capable of preventing PDGF and VEGF<br>
binding to their receptors, their ability to disrupt PDGF- and VEGF-stimulated receptor<br>
tyrosine phosphorylation as described under Materials and Methods was first determined.<br>
From the 19 compounds in the library GFB204 was identified (where RI is a carboxylic<br>
acid and Ra a benzyl ester) as a potent inhibitor of both VEGFR and PDGFR tyrosine<br>
phosphorylation (Table 1) with IC50 values of 190nM (PDGF) and 480nM (VEGF). All<br>
the library members having at least four carboxylic groups inhibited PDGF signaling at<br>
low (aM concentrations (ICso  6 M), while the only compound lacking acidic groups<br>
(GFB217) did not have a significant activity. Analysis of the data in Table 1 revealed<br>
that all the potent inhibitors (having ICso ^ 0.6 ^M) contain RI = COOH and R2 =<br>
hydrophobic ester or amide. GFB211, where R2 = benzylamide, has an activity only<br>
slightly lower (IC50 = 1.34 ± 0.32 jiM) than GFB204, while GFB209, (R2 = methyl<br>
ester)is less potent (ICso = 2.9 ± 2.05 |aM). These data suggest that the structure of the<br>
hydrophobic substituents is not crucial for PDGF signaling inhibition, as long as they are<br>
larger than a methyl group. Compounds having aromatic and aliphatic groups are equally<br>
active and the more stable amides have similar activity to their ester analogs.<br>
In contrast, the calixarene derivatives containing amino acid substituents (i.e.<br>
GFB202, GFB203, GFB205, GFB206, GFB207 and GFB208) show in general lower<br>
activity (ICso in the range 1-6 joM). This may be due either to a change in the ratio of<br>
ionic to hydrophobic groups on the scaffold (these derivatives have 8-16 carboxylic acids<br>
and only 0-4 hydrophobic substituents) or to a non-optimal distance between them.<br>
Moreover, the presence of acidic groups on the isophthalic spacer seems to be more<br>
important than the presence of hydrophobic substituents: GFB201, GFB202, GFB203,<br>
and GFB206 lack hydrophobic groups in the RI and R2 positions but are more potent than<br>
GFB217, which has no carboxylate groups. Possibly, the isophthalic acid groups<br>
themselves provide a hydrophobic area that interacts with the hydrophobic regions of the<br>
receptors binding domain of PDGF.<br>
Finally, it is important to note that the most active compounds in the study have<br>
exactly one carboxylic acid and one hydrophobic group on the four isophthalic<br>
components within the scaffold consistent with previous studies which led to the<br>
identification of GFB111 (Blaskovich, M.A. et al. Nat Biotechnol, 2000, 18:1065-70).<br>
SAR studies also revealed that the characteristics necessary in this series for inhibition of<br>
VEGF-stimulated Flk-1 tyrosine phosphorylation are much more stringent. Indeed,<br>
besides GFB204 (ICso = 0.48 ± 0.31 |aM), only one other potent compound, GFB213,<br>
inhibited Flk-1 tyrosine phosphorylation with an ICso value of 0.85 ± 0.44 [iM (Table 1).<br>
The factors that determine the inhibition activity towards VEGF signaling are difficult to<br>
infer from the data in Table 1.<br>
GFB204 binds both PDGF and VEGF. The ability of GFB204 to bind both VEGF<br>
and PDGF was demonstrated by fluorescence titration curves. Both VEGF and PDGF<br>
contain tryptophans that fluoresce at 334nM when excited at 294nM. Figures 2D and 2E<br>
show that increasing concentrations of GFB-204 decreased the ability of PDGF and<br>
VEGF to fluoresce in a concentration dependent manner.<br>
Example 2—GFB204 inhibits VEGF and PDGF but not EOF binding to their respective<br>
receptors.<br>
The ability of GFB204 to inhibit PDGF and VEGF-stimulated receptor tyrosine<br>
phosphorylation suggested that GFB204 either disrupts ligand/receptor binding, receptor<br>
dimerization or receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Therefore, it was determined whether<br>
GFB204 inhibits the interaction between PDGF and VEGF and their respective receptors<br>
but not other growth factors. To this end, the present inventors evaluated the ability of<br>
GFB204 to block [I-125]-PDGF, [I-125]-VEGF and [I-125]EGF binding to their receptor<br>
on NIH 3T3 cells (PDGF), NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing human Flk-1 (VEGF) and<br>
human EGFR (EGF) as described under Materials and Methods. GFB204 effectively<br>
inhibited the binding of [I-125]PDGF and [I-125]-VEGF to their receptors with IC50<br>
values of 154 +/- 1.0 nM and 469 +/- 94nM, respectively (Figures 2A-2C). In contrast,<br>
[I-125]EGF binding to its receptor was not affected by GFB204 with concentrations as<br>
high as lOO^M. Thus, GFB204 is more selective for PDGF and VEGF over EGF.<br>
Example 3—GFB204 disrupts PDGF- and VEGF- but not EGF-. bFGF- or IGF-1<br>
stimulation of Erkl. Erk2. Akt and STAT3 phosphorylation.<br>
To further document the selectivity of GFB204 for PDGF and VEGF over other<br>
growth factors, the present inventors determined the ability of GFB204 to block growth<br>
factor stimulation of the kinases Erkl, Erk2 and Akt as well as the signal transducer and<br>
activator of transcription STAT3. To this end, NIH 3T3 cells (PDGF and bFGF) or NIH<br>
3T3 cells that overexpress Flk-1 (VEGF), EGFR (EGF) or IGF-IR (IGF-1) were starved<br>
and stimulated with the corresponding growth factor in the presence or absence of<br>
GFB204, and the cells were processed for anti-phosphotyrosine (PDGF and VEGF) and<br>
for anti-phospho-Erkl/2, Akt and STAT3 (PDGF, VEGF, EGF, bFGF and IGF-1)<br>
Western immunoblotting as described under Materials and Methods. Figure 3A shows<br>
that, as described in Table 1, treatment of starved cells with PDGF or VEGF resulted in<br>
potent stimulation of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and that treatment with GFB204<br>
inhibited this stimulation with ICso values of 190nM and 480nM, respectively. Similarly,<br>
PDGF- and VEGF-stimulation of Erkl and Erk2 was also inhibited with similar IC5o<br>
values. Furthermore, this inhibition was selective in that GFB204 blocked PDGF- and<br>
VEGF- but had little effect on EGF-, bFGF- and IGF-1-stimulation of the<br>
phosphorylation of Erkl, Erk2, Akt and STAT3 (Figure 3B).<br>
Example 4—GFB204 inhibits angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo and suppresses the growth<br>
of human tumors in nude mice.<br>
The ability of GFB204 to inhibit potently and selectively PDGF and VEGF/ligand<br>
receptor binding and subsequent signaling prompted the present inventors to determine<br>
whether this agent could inhibit angiogenesis, in vitro and in vivo and subsequently<br>
inhibit tumor growth. First, it was determined if GFB204 could inhibit angiogenesis in<br>
vitro by evaluating its ability to suppress VEGF-induced human brain endothelial<br>
capillary network formation as described under Materials and Methods. GFB204 was<br>
highly efficient at inhibiting VEGF-induced capillary network formation with an ICso<br>
value of 700nM (Figure 4C). The ability of GFB204 to inhibit human brain endothelial<br>
cell migration as described under Materials and Methods was determined next. GFB204<br>
inhibited VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration through matrigel pores into the lower<br>
chamber with an ICso value of 600nM (Figure 4B).<br>
The ability of GFB204 to inhibit VEGF and PDGF binding to their receptors and<br>
subsequent signaling coupled with its ability to inhibit VEGF-induced endothelial cell<br>
migration and capillary network formation suggested that GFB204 might inhibit<br>
angiogenesis and tumorigenesis in whole animals. Therefore, it was next evaluated<br>
whether GFB204 is able to suppress tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo by implanting<br>
human lung cancer A-549 cells s.c. in nude mice. When tumors reached an average size<br>
of 100mm3, the mice were treated with either vehicle or GFB204 and 3 weeks later the<br>
rumors were removed and processed for CD31 immunostaining to determine GFB204<br>
anti-angiogenic effects as described under Materials and Methods. Tumors from control<br>
animals grew to an average size of 749 ±111 mm3 (Figure 6). In contrast, tumors from<br>
GFB204-treated animals grew to an average size of only 650 ± 114 mm3 (GFB204;<br>
Img/kg), and 284 ± 108 mm3 (GFB204; 5mg/kg), respectively. Thus, treatment with<br>
GFB204 resulted in a statistically significant (p
(73%), but not at 1 mg/kg (15%). Tumor sections from GFB204 treated animals show a<br>
significant inhibition of CD31 staining (Figures 5A-5C). Quantification of microvessels<br>
at field magnification (400X) indicated that tumors from vehicle-treated mice contained<br>
11.3 ± 1.9 microvessels whereas those from mice treated with GFB204 (5mg/Kg) had<br>
only 2.6 ± 0.9 microvessels. Taken together, the results clearly demonstrated that<br>
GFB204 inhibits A-549 xenografts tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo.<br>
The strict requirement and stringent dependence of tumor growth on angiogenesis<br>
has prompted many investigators to design strategies for cancer therapy by disrupting<br>
angiogenesis resulting in deprivation of cancer cells of nutrients and essentially tumor<br>
starvation (Zhang, W. et al. Angiogenesis, 2002, 5:35-44; Ferrara, N. Semin Oncol, 2002,<br>
29:10-4; Jain, R.K. Semin Oncol, 2002, 29:3-9; Morin, M.J. Oncogene, 2000, 19:6574-<br>
83; Miao, R.Q. et al. Blood, 2002, 100:3245-52; Laird, A.D. et al. Cancer Res, 2000,<br>
60:4152-60; Wedge, S.R. et al. Cancer Res, 2000, 60:970-5; Relf, M. et al. Cancer Res,<br>
1997, 57:963-9; Huang, J. et al. Proc NatlAcadSci USA, 2003, 100:7785-90; Blaskovich,<br>
M.A. et al. Nat Biotechnol, 2000, 18:1065-70). Although targeting angiogenesis as an<br>
approach to cancer therapy was suggested decades ago, it is only very recently that the<br>
first drug designed to target a step in the complex process of angiogenesis has been<br>
approved by the FDA (Ferrara, N. Semin Oncol, 2002, 29:10-4). Indeed, AVASTIN, a<br>
humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody has shown activity against metastatic colon<br>
cancer. Though pivotal for providing proof of concept for targeting angiogenesis in<br>
humans, this approach has not been fully exploited. One improvement that is sought after<br>
is to design strategies that simultaneously target different steps in the angiogenic process<br>
(Bergers, G. et al. J Clin Invest, 2003, 111:1287-95; Relf, M. et al. Cancer Res, 1997,<br>
57:963-9; Huang, J. et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 2003, 100:7785-90). The present<br>
inventors have developed a novel synthetic pharmacological agent that inhibits the<br>
function of both VEGF and PDGF, growth factors that have been shown to mediate<br>
initiation and maintenance of new blood vessels, respectively (Bergers, G. et al. J Clin<br>
Invest, 2003, 111:1287-95; Dvorak, H.F. J Clin Oncol, 2002, 20:4368-80; Ferrara, N.<br>
Curr Top Microbiol Immunol, 1999, 237:1-30; Dvorak, H.F. et al. Curr Top Microbiol<br>
Immunol, 1999, 237:97-132; Eriksson, U. and Alitalo, K. Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,<br>
1999, 237:41-57). This is the first report of an agent that inhibits the binding of both<br>
VEGF and PDGF to their receptors and subsequently suppresses tyrosine phosphorylation<br>
and downstream signaling pathways (Erk, Akt and STAT3). GFB204 also blocked<br>
potently the ability of endothelial cells to migrate (ICso = 600nM) as well as their ability<br>
to form capillaries in vitro (ICso = 700nM). In vivo, treatment of mice bearing human<br>
tumors s.c. led to inhibition of blood vessel formation around the tumor mass as well as<br>
inhibition of tumor growth. Although GFB204 potently inhibited both VEGF and PDGF<br>
binding to their receptors (200-500nM) it was not a non-specific disrupter of all of<br>
ligand/receptor binding since EGF binding to its receptor was not affected at doses as<br>
high as lOO^M. Further support for selectivity was provided by demonstrating that<br>
GFB204 inhibited the activation of Erkl, Erk2, Akt and STATS by PDGF and VEGF but<br>
not by EOF, bFGF or IGF-1.<br>
Identification of calix[4]arene derivatives capable of blocking binding of both<br>
VEGF and PDGF to their receptors is an entirely novel approach to targeting receptor<br>
tyrosine kinase signaling. Although the anti-VEGF antibody AVASTIN also blocks<br>
VEGF binding to its receptor (Zhang, W. et al. Angiogenesis, 2002, 5:35-44; Ferrara, N.<br>
Semin Oncol, 2002, 29:10-4), there are apparently no other agents that block binding of<br>
both PDGF and VEGF to their receptors. Furthermore, the advantage of GFB204 over<br>
AVASTIN is that GFB204 is a much smaller molecule that can be easily synthesized at<br>
low cost, unlike the laborious and expensive methods involved in generating antibodies<br>
for therapeutic purposes. Although prior to this report there were no dual inhibitors of<br>
VEGF and PDGF binding to their receptors, dual inhibitors of VEGF and PDGF receptor<br>
tyrosine kinases have been made and some are in clinical trials (Kerbel, R.S.<br>
Carcinogenesis, 2000, 21:505-15; Jain, R.K. Semin Oncol, 2002, 29:3-9; Morin, M.J.<br>
Oncogene, 2000, 19:6574-83; Miao, R.Q. et al. Blood, 2002, 100:3245-52; Laird, A.D. et<br>
al. Cancer Res, 2000, 60:4152-60; Wedge, S.R. etal. Cancer Res, 2000, 60:970-5).<br>
There are distinct differences between these ATP mimics and GFB204. While the<br>
target for GFB204 is the ligand/receptor interaction that occurs extracellularly on the<br>
outer cell surface, ATP mimics target the tyrosine kinase domains of the receptors that are<br>
intracellular. Therefore, unlike GFB204, kinase inhibitors must enter cells to reach their<br>
target. Furthermore, most tyrosine kinase inhibitors target the ATP binding site,<br>
variations of which are ubiquitous in cells. Therefore, the outcome of treating patients<br>
with GFB204 may be very different from that of treating patients with an ATP mimic that<br>
targets both PDGF and VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases. Advanced preclinical studies are<br>
underway in preparation for an IND application for phase I testing of GFB204 in humans.<br>
