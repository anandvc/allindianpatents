				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]     The invention pertains to compositions comprising organic peroxide which cross-link latex films. The invention further pertains to latex compounds comprising the compositions. The Related Art<br>
[0002]      Latex compounds are conventionally cured by adding sulfur, a metal oxide activator, such as zinc oxide, and a combination of accelerators. The most common accelerators used in industry are thiurams, thiazoles and dithiocarbamates. An increased number of human beings have developed skin sensitivities to the accelerators commonly found in latex goods. Thus, use of latex products cured with conventional systems has led to an increase in delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity, also known as Type IV allergy. Type IV allergy occurs when the body perceives residual chemicals in the latex products as an antigen which interacts with specific T lymphocytes that release inflammatory and toxic substances leading to a skin reaction. Persons who experience Type IV allergy generally have an increased risk of developing Type I latex allergies.<br>
[0003]      Because of the increased risk of Type IV reactions, alternative means for curing latex articles are sought in the art. Latex compounds which can be cured without conventional accelerators, such as thiurams, thiazoles and dithiocarbamates, are particularly desired. Organic peroxide is discussed in the art as a curing agent in conjunction with metal oxides. Organic peroxide curing systems in the art, however, may require special processing conditions, such as use of molten salt bath, or other liquid bath or the use of high energy radiation. Conventional organic peroxide<br>
systems do not function satisfactorily in open air systems, that is systems where the latex compounds are cured while being exposed to an external environment such as the inside of a heating chamber (oven) or ambient conditions. <br>
[0004]     Unless otherwise specified, all parts and percentages are on a weight by weight basis. Also, all parts and percentages set forth on a basis of parts per hundred rubber ("phr").are on a dry weight basis, unless otherwise specified.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]     The invention is a system for curing latex compounds that comprises organic peroxide, and, optionally, surfactant and/or antioxidant. The cure system can be combined with natural rubber and synthetic latex compositions, in other words a rubber material, to make latex compounds that can be cured (i.e. cross-linked) without the use of other accelerators, such as accelerators and activators used with conventional curing systems.<br>
[0006]     Latex compounds comprising the cure system can be cured in an open air environment or in closed systems. During the open air curing, the latex compounds will not become tacky, or will not obtain a level of tackiness that precludes effective open air curing. Thus, latex compounds comprising the cure system described herein require no special curing conditions, such as molten salt baths, or other liquid baths, or do not need to be cured by special curing systems like the application of radiation.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]     The invention concerns a cure system for latex compounds. The cure system comprises organic peroxide, preferably an organic peroxide emulsion or dispersion, and, optionally, surfactant and antioxidant. In addition, the cure system may comprise coagents, and also processing aids, such as chemicals to control pH,<br><br>
thickeners and other materials, such as materials to reduce tackiness. Curing systems comprising, consisting essentially of or consisting of one or more of organic peroxide, surfactant and antioxidant are within the scope of the invention. <br>
[0008]     Organic peroxide is a molecule containing at least two oxygen atoms connected by a single bond to organic chemical groups. An example of organic peroxide is depicted below:<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Depending on the groups attached, the oxygen-oxygen bond is designed to break when heated, leaving one unpaired electron or free radical on each oxygen. These free radicals are able to promote certain chemical reactions, such as polymerization, the curing of thermosetting resins, and the crosslinking of elastomers. As organic peroxides decompose, they generate the free radicals that in turn create an active site on the polymer backbone. When organic peroxides are used for curing latex compounds, the reaction between the active sites produces a strong carbon-carbon bond between the polymer chains in the latex, which in turn leads to a polymer network with desirable mechanical properties, in particular excellent resistance to heat.<br>
[0009]     One or a combination of organic peroxides may be used in the invention Organic peroxides such as dialkyl peroxides and peroxyketals may be used. Examples of dialkyl peroxides include those selected from the group consisting of dicumyl peroxide (such as that available from Hercules Incorporated, Wilmington, Delaware, USA under the trade name DICUP R), 2,5-dimethyl-di-(t-butylperoxy)hexane, di-t-butylperoxide, t-butylcumyl-peroxide, bis(t-<br><br>
butylperoxyisopropyl)benzene, butyl4,4-bis(t-butylperoxy)valerate, 2,5-bis(t-butylperoxy)-2,5-dimethylhexane, 2,5-bis(t-butylperoxy)-2,5-dimethyl-3-hexyne, t-butyl 3-isopropenylcumyl peroxide, bis(3-isopropenylcumyl) peroxide, 1,1-bis(t-butylperoxy)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, t-butylperoxybenzoate, and bis(2,4-dichlorobenzoyl) peroxide. Examples of organic peroxides that may be used in the invention include VAROX速 231, VAROX速 DBPH, VAROX速 130 and VAROX速 DCP, all available from R.T. Vanderbilt Co. Inc., Norwalk, Connecticut, USA ("Vanderbilt").<br>
[0010]     The organic peroxide may be in an emulsion (for liquid organic peroxides) or a dispersion (for solid organic peroxides) with water. The organic peroxide emulsion or dispersion comprises organic peroxide and water, and may consist essentially of or consist of organic peroxide and water. Generally, the emulsion or dispersion may comprise from about 10% to about 90% organic peroxide and about 10% to about 90% water, such as about 25% to about 75% organic peroxide and   . about 25% to about 75% water. The organic peroxide emulsion or dispersion may comprise, for example, from about 40% to about 60% organic peroxide and about 40% to about 60% water.<br>
[0011]     Surfactants useful in the invention include sodium lauryl sulfate (DARVAN速 WAQ from Vanderbilt), t-Octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol (TRITON速 X-100 from the Union Carbide Corporation, Danbury, Connecticut, USA) and sulfated methyl oleate (DARVAN速 SMO from Vanderbilt). Ammonium salts of alkyl phosphates, such as DARVAN速 L from Vanderbilt, may also be used as a surfactant. Combinations of surfactants can be used. The surfactant also assists in decreasing the surface tack during open air curing of a latex compound comprising the curing system described herein.<br><br>
[0012]     The cure system optionally comprises antioxidants, such as amine, dithiocarbamate, hydroquinone, phenol, ortoluimidazole antioxidant. Antioxidants useful in the invention include those available from Vanderbilt under the trade names AGERITE速 STALITE速, AGERITE速 STALITE速 S, AGERITE速 SUPERFLEX速 Liquid, VANOX速 AM Powder, VANOX速 HT, VANOX速 12, VANOX速 CDPA, VANOX速 1001, BUTYL ZIMATE速 Powder, AGERITE速 MA Pastilles, AGERITE速 RESIN D速 Pastilles, AGERITE SUPERLITE速, VANOX GT Powder, VANOX速 L Powder, VANOX速 MBPC, VANOX速 13, VANOX速 1290, VANOX速 MTI, VANOX速 ZMTI and VANOX速 SPL slurry. Combinations of antioxidants can be used. [0013]      The cure system may comprise one or more coagents for cross-linking the latex compounds. For example, the cure system may further comprise triallylisocyanurate ("TAIC"), such as DIAK速 7 and/or m-phenylenedimaleimide, like VANAX速 MBM (1H-Pyrrole~2-5-dione, 1, 1' (1, 3 phenylene) bis-), both available from Vanderbilt, or Triallyl Cyanurate (SR 507 (TAG) from Sartomer, Exton, Pennsylvania, USA), Other coagents useful in the invention include Difunctional Liquid Methacrylate (SR 297 (BGDMA)), Trifunctional Liquid Methacrylate (SR 350 (TMPTMA), Scorch-Retarded Liquid Dimethacrylate (SARET速 SR 516), Scorch-Retarded Liquid Trimethacrylate (SARET速 SR), Scorch-Retarded Liquid Triacrylate (SARET速 SR 519), Scorch-Retarded Liquid Dimethacrylate (SARET速 SR 521), Scorch-Retarded Solid Diacrylate (SARET速 SR 522), Scorch-Retarded Metallic Diacrylate (SARET速 75 EPM 2A (75% active dispersion), SARET速 SR 633) and Scorch-Retarded Metallic Dimethacrylate (SARET速 SR 634 or SARET速 75 EPM 2M (75% active dispersion)) all available from Sartomer. Combinations of coagents may be used.<br><br>
[0014]     The cure system may further comprise other materials. Hydroxides, such as potassium hydroxide, can be included to control pH, such as the pH of a latex compound comprising the cure system. Thickeners, such as sodium polyacrylates like Paragum-231 from Para-Chem, Simpsonville, South Carolina, USA, may be used in the cure system. Also, zinc 2-mercaptotoluimidazole ("ZMTI"), for example VANOX速 ZMTI from Vanderbilt, may be included in the composition for tack reduction, as well as additional antioxidant protection.<br>
[0015]     The invention encompasses latex compounds comprising the cure system. In this embodiment of the invention, the latex compounds comprise, at least, organic peroxide and heat curable natural or synthetic rubber type materials, in other words a rubber material, and optionally, surfactant and/or antioxidant. The latex compounds may comprise one or more of the materials (heat curable natural or synthetic rubber) selected from the group consisting of natural rubber, polyisoprene, polychloroprene, acrylonitrile, styrene-butadiene, sulfur cured butyl, and the like, and combinations thereof. In an aspect of the invention, the rubber material is a synthetic material such as those selected from the group consisting of polychloroprene, acrylonitrile, styrene butadiene and sulfur cured butyl, and particularly chosen from the group of polychloroprene and acrylonitrile. Useful polyisoprene materials include KRATON速 polymers, such as KRATON速 IR-401, from the KRATON速 Polymers Group of Companies having offices in Houston, Texas, USA. Neoprene Liquid Dispersion, a polychloroprene from DuPont Performance Elastomers, Wilmington, Delaware, USA may be used. Useful acrylonitriles include carboxylated butadiene-acrylonitrile latexes such as TYLAC速 68073 from Dow-Reichhold Specialty Latex, LLC, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA. HYCAR速 acrylic emulsions available from NOVEON速, Inc.,<br><br>
Cleveland, Ohio, USA may also be used in the latex compounds. Natural rubber latex is available from Getahindus (M) Sdn Bdh, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia, and also from Firestone Polymers, Akron, Ohio, USA.<br>
[0016]     In an embodiment of the invention, the latex compounds comprise from about 0.1 to about 5.0 phr organic peroxide, up to about 5.0 phr, such as about 0.1 phrto about 5 phr surfactant and up to about 5.0 phr, such as about 0.1 phr to about 5 phr antioxidant. Additionally, the latex compounds may comprise up to about 5.0 phr, such as about 0.1 phr to about 5 phr ZMTI. The latex compounds may comprise from about 0.1 to about 3 phr, preferably about 0.5 phrto 2 phr, organic peroxide. The organic peroxide may be added to the latex compound in an emulsion or dispersion with water. Coagents, such as TAIC and m-phenylenediamaleimide, may be used in amounts of up to about 5 phr, for example, from about 0.75 phr to about 3.75 phr. In an aspect of the invention, the latex compound is formulated and cured without the use of metal oxide, such as zinc oxide,<br>
[0017]     A small amount of sulfur in the latex compounds may be used in or with the cure system, such as from about 0.05 phr to about 1 phr, preferably about 0.1 phr to about 0.5 phr sulfur.   The sulfur is found to provide further assistance with tack reduction.<br>
[0018]     The invention also concerns a method of curing a latex film from the latex compounds of the invention comprising the steps of forming a film from a latex compound comprising the cure system, i.e., at least the organic peroxide, and, optionally, surfactant and/or antioxidant, and heating the film for a period of time. The films should be cured according to the peroxide half-life time and temperature. The half-life time of the peroxide refers to the time or temperature at which 50% of the peroxide has decomposed. In the invention, the films of the latex compounds<br><br>
may be cured for about 6 peroxide half-lifes to about 10 peroxide half-lifes to effectively cure or cross-link the latex compound, such that, in the curing cycle about 97% to about 100%, such as about 98.4% to about 99.9%, of the peroxide has decomposed. For example, the latex compound may be cured for about 5 minutes to about 50 minutes at about 90属C to about 180属C, such as about 10 minutes to about 40 minutes at about 100属C to about 175属C. In an embodiment of the invention, the film is cured for about 10 minutes to about 30 minutes at about 130属 C to about 160属 C, preferably at about 140属 to about 150属C.<br>
[0019]     The latex is preferably cured in an open air system, that is the curing may occur such that the latex is exposed to air when it is cured. The organic peroxide, with the surfactant, particularly the sodium lauryl sulfate and sulfated methyl oleate, combined with the ZMTI, were found as beneficial to minimize tackiness during the open air curing cycle, although other combinations of compounds within the scope of the invention also minimize tackiness in the open air cycle.<br>
[0020]     In the curing process, the organic peroxides form carbon to carbon bonds between individual polymer chains in the latex compound. The carbon to carbon bond is stronger and more thermally stable than the sulfur to sulfur bonds formed by elemental sulfur vulcanization. The use of a sulfur donor system to cure latex compounds will primarily form carbon to sulfur type bonds, the thermal stability of which falls between that of sulfur to sulfur and carbon to carbon bonds. The higher strength of the covalent carbon to carbon bond network obtained through curing with the organic peroxide results in optimum thermal stability in the cured latex compound which is beneficial to cured latex products made from latex compounds cured with organic peroxides in accordance with the invention. One aspect of the invention is a<br><br>
curing system which creates carbon-carbon cross link bonds without establishing any carbon-sulfur or sulfur-sulfur cross links in the cured latex compound. <br>
[0021]     The latex compounds can be used to make a wide variety of cured latex products.  Examples of products that may be made with the latex compounds of the invention are gloves, condoms, carpet backing, threads and adhesives.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
In the examples the degree of surface tack (i.e. tackiness) of films made from the various latex compounds was determined. The test involved a person touching the cured films and then evaluating the degree of surface tack based on a sliding scale of 1 to 5. The criteria for the sliding scale was as follows:  1 indicating no tack or a degree of surface tack generally found with articles subjected to conventional sulfur cure, 3 indicating a degree of surface tack that was sticky but did not render the file unusable, and 5 indicating a degree of surface tack rendering the films unusable. The degree of surface tack is set forth below in each example.<br>
