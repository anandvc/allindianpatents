				<td>A PROCESS FOR PREPARING ACTIVATED CARBON FEOM<br>
URBAN WASTE<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for preparing<br>
activated carbon from urban waste, and to activated carbon prepared<br>
thereby.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The increasing amount of urban waste produced daily has brought forth<br>
the need to find improved solutions to the conventional waste disposal<br>
methods of landfilling and incineration.<br>
A large scale improved solution currently applied is the recycling for<br>
re-use of certain components of the waste, such as metals, glass and<br>
plastics. However, this typo of recycling does not provide a solution for a<br>
major component of the waste, viz., waste from botanical sources (wood<br>
scrap, fruits, vegetables, food, vegetation etc.) and paper product waste,<br>
which together with plastic waste constitute the organic fraction of urban<br>
waste. An effective solution for the. recycling of the organic fraction of<br>
urban waste is the use of said fraction as raw material in conversion<br>
processes which convert organic waste into economically valuable<br>
products. Such a process is a pyrolysis which thermally converts organic<br>
waste to charcoal, as a primary product, and to other by-products known<br>
as pyrolytic gases and liquids, which have a low commercial value.<br>
U.S patent 4,077,847 discloses a solid waste disposal system which sorts<br>
urban waste and produces via flash pyrolysis char and pyrolytic oils from<br>
the organic fraction of the waste. EP 69,159 discloses a pyrolysis process<br>
for organic waste which produces charcoal and pyrolytic products, which<br>
are recycled for use in the pyrolytic process. The charcoal produced in<br>
pyrolytic processes can be used as raw material for preparing active<br><br>
carbon. The charcoal produced in the aforementioned processes, however,<br>
has a high ash content and therefore the active carbon produced from<br>
such charcoal is characteristically soft and brittle and of poor quality.<br>
Among the characteristics which determine the quality of active carbon<br>
are the ash content, the pore volume and the hardness. Active carbon<br>
which is hard, contains a low percentage of ash and has high pore volume<br>
is considered to be of high quality. The ash content of the charcoal<br>
produced by pyrolysis directly influences the quality of the active carbon<br>
prepared from the charcoa. Charcoal containing 10-20% ash is considered<br>
to be excellent quality charcoal. Thus, the active carbon prepared from<br>
this charcoal is also of prima quality.<br>
It is a purpose of the present invention to provide an improved pyrolytic<br>
process of urban waste.<br>
It is a further purpose of this invention to introduce an improved process<br>
for the preparation of charcoal of low ash content, from urban waste.<br>
It is a further purpose of this invention to provide an improved process for<br>
the preparation of active carbon.<br>
It is still a further purpose of this invention to provide an improved<br>
process for the preparation of granulated active carbon of low ash content,<br>
from urban waste.<br>
It is yet another purpose of this invention to provide an improved process<br>
for the preparation of granulated active carbon of high quality from urban<br>
waste.<br><br>
Other objects of the invention -will become apparent as the description<br>
proceeds.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention the organic fraction of urban waste is<br>
converted to active carbon via an improved pyrolytic process. The active<br>
carbon produced has a low ash content, high pore volume and hardness.<br>
Hence, the active carbon of the present invention possesses superior<br>
characteristics.<br>
In one aspect, the invention is directed to a process for the preparation of<br>
active carbon from urban vaste comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	Sorting the waste-, to remove foreign materials;<br>
b)	Reducing the size of the waste particles;<br>
c)	Drying the waste  under anaerobic conditions at a temperature<br>
comprised between about 100°C - 150°C;<br><br>
d)	Pyrolysing the w aste of step (c) at a temperature of about 140°C<br>
-and-above,- to  500°C;<br>
e)	Granulating the product obtained in step (d) above;<br><br>
f)	Carbonizing the  granules obtained in  step  (e)  above  under<br>
anaerobic conditions at a temperature of about 110°C-and-abover  to 600°C;<br>
g)	Activating the   carbonized granules of step (f)  above in the<br>
presence of steam and combustion gases at about 750°C-900°C; and<br><br>
h) Purifying the activated granules of step (g) above by rinsing in an<br>
aqueous acidic solution, and subsequently drying the activated carbon<br>
until the water content of the particles is in the range of 4%-8%.<br>
Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all percentages given herein are<br>
by weight, and all ratios between various process components are also by<br>
weight.<br>
The urban waste referred to herein includes various types of waste<br>
produced in the urban environment. For the purpose of this invention<br>
urban waste is defined as waste which includes domestic waste and<br>
commercial waste but does not include industrial waste. In this context,<br>
domestic waste includes waste produced in an average normal household<br>
which comprises food waste, paper products and packaging, plastic<br>
products, wood, glass and metal, Commercial waste is the waste produced<br>
by the commercial sector. Much of the commercial waste is generated by<br>
food establishments, markets, grocery stores and the like.<br>
By "foreign materials" :.t is meant to indicate non-pyrolyzable materials,<br>
such as metal and glass that may interfere with the process.<br><br>
The invention provides a process for the preparation of activated<br>
carbon from urban waste comprsing:<br>
a)	Sorting the waste to remove foreign materials;<br>
b)	Reducing the size of the waste particles;<br><br>
c)	Drying the waste under anaerobic conditions at a temperature<br>
between 100°C-150°C;<br>
d)	Pyrolysing the waste state of step { c ) at a temperature of 140°C to<br>
500°C;<br>
e)	Granulating the product obtained in step(d) above;<br>

conditions at a temperature of-110°C to 600°C;<br>
g)	Activating the carbonized granules of step (f) above in the presence<br>
of steam and combustion gases  at 750°G-900°C; and<br>
h) Purifying the activated granules of step (g) and above by rinsing in<br>
an aqueous acidic solution, anc subsequently drying the activated carbon.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The above and other characteristics and advantages of the invention<br>
will be better understood through the following illustrative and non-limitative<br>
detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, with reference to the<br>
appended drawings, wherein:<br>
Fig. is a block diagram of the process for preparing activated carbon<br>
from urban waste.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
A process according to our preferred embodiment of the invention will now<br>
be described in general terms, it being understood that the various<br>
conditions described are provided only for the purpose of illustration and<br>
are not intended to be limitative.<br>
In the initial stage the waste is sorted for the removal of foreign materials.<br>
The waste is then shredded to particle size of about 2cm x 2cm x 2cm, and<br>
then dried at a temperature of about 110°C. The dried particulate waste is<br>
then transferred to the pyrolysis vessel wherein the pyrolysis is a two<br>
stage process conducted at a temperature, preferably, in the range of<br>
140°C to 500°C, in which primary pyrolysis takes place at about 160°C and<br>
in the second stage the te:nperature reaches 390°C. The pyrolysis stage<br>
takes about 2 hours. Optionally, matter made of polymeric materials,<br>
typically, plastics and rubbers, are removed prior to and/or subsequent to<br>
any one of the pyrolysis stages. The charcoal produced in the pyrolysis is<br>
crushed to a mean particle size up to about 0.01mm. This charcoal<br>
produced in the pyrolysis stage has an ash content of 9-20%. This charcoal<br>
is granulated in an extruder with a charcoal:water:oil ratio of about<br>
1:0.7:0.15. The subsequent carbonization is carried out at a temperature,<br>
preferably, in the range of L10°C to 600°C. The granulated carbon is then<br>
carbonized at about 180°C under anaerobic conditions. The subsequent<br>
activation is carried out at about 790°C in the presence of steam and<br>
combustion gases. The combustion gases used in this stage are mixed with<br>
gases from the drying process.<br>
The final purifying of the activated carbon is done by rinsing with an<br>
aqueous acidic solution, preferably, 5%-20% HCl solution, until the ash<br>
content is 2%-5% followed by washing in water until the water extracts<br>
have a pH of 3.5-5. The rinsed activated carbon is finally dried at about<br>
100°C to a final water content in the range of 4%-8%.<br><br>
The activated carbon obtained by the process of the present invention has<br>
an ash content of 2%-5%, a mean pore volume in the range of 0.95-1.2 ml/g<br>
as determined according to Kuleshkin, D. A. and Michaelova, C.C.,<br>
"Activated Carbon", Leningrad Chem., 1972, and a hardness in the range<br>
85-95 as determined according to the method of Russian standard GOST<br>
16188-70<br>
Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments of The Invention<br>
The following example is illustrative of a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, with reference to Fig. 1, which is a block diagram of the process.<br>
The following example is not to be construed as limiting, it being<br>
understood that the skilled person may carry out many obvious variations<br>
to the process.<br>
Example 1<br>
1100 Kg of urban waste were sorted to remove foreign material (Fig. 1,<br>
stage 1) . The remaining waste was then shredded to pieces approximately<br>
2cm x 2cm x 2cm (Fig. 1, stage 2). The shredded waste was then<br>
introduced into a rotating drum which was heated to 110°C through an<br>
external heating jacket under anaerobic conditions for 90 minutes (Fig. 1,<br>
stage 3). The partially dried waste was pyrolized initially at about 160°C<br>
and then at about 390°C for about 2 hours (Fig. 1, stage 4). The pyrolysis<br>
product, charcoal, weighed 100 Kg and was loaded into an extruder<br>
(model: LUK 2.5 K, manufactured by WERNER &amp; PFLEIDERER,<br>
Germany) together with 70 Kg of oil and 14 liters of water (Fig. 1, stage<br>
5). 184 Kg of granulated carbon having a mean particle diameter of 1.2<br>
mm were obtained. These granules were then carbonized at about 180°C<br>
for about 50-75 minutes, under anaerobic conditions to yield 110 Kg of<br>
dried particles (Fig. 1, stage 6). The activation was conducted at about<br>
790°C in the presence of steam and combustion gases for about 80-110<br><br>
minutes. The combustion gases were mixed with gases emitted during the<br>
initial drying stage (Fig. :., stage 7). All heating stages were carried out in<br>
the same rotating drum. 70 Kg of activated particles were obtained. The<br>
activated carbon granules were then washed in an aqueous 10% HCl<br>
solution until the ash content was 2.1%-4.5% (Fig. 1, stage 8). The<br>
granules were then rinsed with water until the water extract had a pH of<br>
3.5-5 (Fig. 1, stage 8). Finally the activated carbon was dried at about<br>
100°C until the water content of the particles was 4%-8% (Fig. 1, stage 9).<br>
55 Kg of activated carbon were produced possessing the following<br>
characteristics:<br><br><br>
