				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention concerns a brush, in particular a tooth brush, comprising a brush body and a brush support supporting a plurality of bristles and being preferably removably retained on the brush body.<br>
The invention is described below, by way of example, as a tooth brush, however, it can be used in the same fashion with other cleaning and application devices having bristles, in particular, washing brushes, scrubbing brushes, cleaning brushes, toilet brushes, brooms, paint brushes, application brushes for creams, powder, cosmetics, medication, spices or paint or even floor treatment brushes, wherein these applications are explicitly included in the invention.<br>
A manual tooth brush of conventional construction comprises a longitudinal brush body made in general of plastic material, whose rear section serves as a handle, and the front head end of which comprises a bristle field having a plurality of bristles fixed to the bristle body. An electrically driven tooth brush has essentially similar construction, wherein the brush body is subdivided into a base part accommodating the driving motor and serving as handle, and an attachment part supporting, at its front head, the bristle field and<br><br>
2<br>
comprising a transmission for converting the motion of an output shaft of the driving motor into an oscillating or back and forth rotating motion of the bristle field.<br>
The bristle field of a tooth brush experiences the largest amount of wear through use. Since worn or bent bristles insufficiently clean the teeth and damage the gums, it is recommended to replace tooth brushes every three months. With conventional tooth brushes of this type, with the bristle field being rigidly connected to the brush body, the bristle body of manual tooth brushes must be entirely replaced when the bristles are worn and the attachment part of electric tooth brushes, including transmission, must be replaced. It has been realized for some time that this procedure is both uneconomical and ecologically questionable.<br>
To prevent these problems, so-called removable head tooth brushes have been developed, wherein the bristle field seats on a removable bristle support, in particular in the form of a stable plastic plate which engages in a depression in the head of the brush body, limited by a projecting edge. Since the dimensions of the tooth brush head are limited for handling and application reasons, the edge of the depression reduces the bristle field size.   This limitation is acceptable with manual tooth brushes. However, with electric tooth brushes whose bristle field is in any event smaller than that of manual tooth brushes for structural reasons, the bristle field becomes very small which consequently reduces the cleaning effect of the tooth brush.<br><br>
3<br>
Moreover, it has been shown that dirt and bacteria can accumulate in the depression and in the gaps between the bristle body and the brush support which are difficult to remove such that use of some tooth brushes with removable head is questionable with respect to hygiene.<br>
To securely retain the removable bristle head on the brush body, same has to be sufficiently stable and thus hard which creates the problem that the sensitive raucous membranes come in contact with relatively hard structural parts when using the tooth brush. This could cause injuries.<br>
In conventional tooth brushes, the bristles are usually rigidly held in the bristle support. This has the disadvantage that the bristles cannot deflect in the axial direction during cleaning and can deflect in a transverse direction only due to their intrinsic flexibility. When applying large cleaning forces, these forces transferred to the teeth and gums essentially without resilient absorption thereby possibly causing injuries. It has been attempted to dispose the bristle bundles in a resilient fashion on the brush support. However, the construction required therefor is very demanding and requires very expensive production methods.<br>
It is the underlying purpose of the invention to produce a brush of the mentioned type which avoids the above-mentioned problems and which is of simple construction.<br><br>
4<br>
This object is achieved in accordance with the invention in a brush of the mentioned type in that the bristle support, consisting of soft-elastic plastic material, is formed like a cap and can be drawn over a projection of the bristle body.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the bristle support bearing the bristle field is formed as a flexible cap e.g. of an elastomeric plastic material which can be drawn, like a cover, onto a projection, in particular, on the brush body head such that it surrounds and covers the projection and is securely held on the projection by tensioning forces resulting in particular from the elastic deformation of the cap, however, can be removed from same when required. The tensioning or retaining forces of the cap-like bristle support are thereby determined by its ability to deform which depends on its geometric design, its wall thickness and the elastic properties of its material.<br>
The inventive cap-like bristle support is drawn over the projection and in particular the head of the bristle support and is not inserted therein, which has the essential advantage that the surface of the bristle support is larger than the surface of the projection overlapping it, such that the bristle field can be relatively large.<br>
The soft-elastic and thus very flexible plastic material of the cap-like bristle support can be easily deformed in all directions such that the bristles can resiliently deflect in<br><br>
5<br>
their axial direction and also perpendicular thereto when cleaning forces are applied.<br>
The cap-like bristle support is held on the projection of the brush support by tensioning forces resulting from its elastic deformation thereby preventing formation of gaps between the bristle support and the brush body and accumulation of dirt and resulting formation of bacteria.<br>
The cap-like bristle support covering the projection of the brush body serves at the same time as mucous membrane protection due to its soft-elastic material and has the further advantage that the constructional height of the brush is small.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention provides that the brush support comprises an upper, preferably diaphragm-like covering part having bristles on its upper side and supporting, on its lower side facing away from the bristles a preferably continuous and peripheral flexible projecting edge or bridge mounted onto the covering part or formed in one piece therewith. The height of the bridge may be constant or also vary along the circumference. In the mounted state of the cap-like bristle support, the projection of the brush body is disposed below the covering part and between the peripheral bridge which is tensioned on the projection from the outside. Alternatively or additionally, a bridge may be provided which abuts from the inside on a recess wall in the brush body.<br><br>
6<br>
The bristles are disposed at least in partial areas of the upper side of the covering part whose whole surface is preferably provided with bristles. Additionally or alternatively, the bristles may be disposed at least in partial areas of the outer side of the bridge tensioned against the projection from the outside.<br>
In a possible embodiment, the covering part of the cap-like bristle support may extend essentially level. The covering part may also have a spatial structure, at least in the mounted state. This can be achieved by providing the upper side of the projection of the brush body with a structured surface and disposing the flexible covering part of the bristle support onto the structured upper side of the projection such that it abuts and follows said structure. Therein, the spatial course of the covering part in the mounted state is determined by the surface structure of the projection of the brush body. Alternatively, it is also possible to provide the covering part itself with a structured surface which can be effected either during the production process, e.g. during injection-molding or injection of the bristles or by subsequent deformation, in particular compressing or deep-drawing of the initially flat covering part.<br>
All embodiments may additionally be provided with bristles having differing bristle lengths and/or bristle orientations forming a topographic structure with different heights.<br><br>
7<br>
A further preferred design of the inventive brush provides at least one cavity below and/or within the cap-like bristle support. This cavity can provide the covering part supporting the bristles with elastic resilience, wherein the resilience is determined by the shape of the cavity and can be adjusted as desired by a damping fluid to be filled into the cavity. Alternatively, the cavity can  be used to accommodate a medium to be applied during use of the brush. The medium may either be fluid or powdery cosmetics, tooth care products etc. Supply and application of the medium can be effected e.g. through openings in the flexible cap-like bristle support, hollow bristles or bristle bundles or through the capillary effect of bristle bundles.<br>
In a simple embodiment of the cavity, the cap-like bristle support can be disposed onto the projection in such a fashion that an intermediate space forming said cavity is generated between the lower side of the covering part of the bristle support and the upper side of the projection such that the cavity is limited by the bristle support and the brush body.<br>
A preferred further development of the invention provides that a dividing wall divides the cavity into separate chambers which preferably contain media having different characteristics which are mixed and react with one another, optionally, not before leaving the respective chamber. Moreover, the cavity may contain an agent which reacts with<br><br>
8<br>
an externally applied tooth paste or cleaning cream thereby forming an optimized agent for the intended purpose.<br>
The amount of the medium leaving the cavity or the chambers depends on the deformation of the cavity and in particular of the covering part limiting same.<br>
The cavity or the chambers may be provided with a foamed insert which is inserted either as separate pre-fabricated part or injection-molded in a multiple-component injection-molding process during production of the cap-like bristle support or introduced by foam mold. The foamed insert serves as a damping member for deformation of the covering part supporting the bristles. Moreover, the insert may also be soaked with a medium to be applied. The use of hydrophilic foam allows storage of liquid or gaseous media, contained by said foam, in the cavity. Such enriched foams are easy to handle and, in particular, can be exchanged.<br>
The cavity can be associated with a storage region connected therewith containing a medium to be applied which is supplied, through a passage, to the cavity containing a foamed or sponge insert for throttled and uniformly dosed supply of the medium to the bristle field.<br>
The design of a cavity can also be effected or improved when at least sections of the brush body are formed as cups and the cap-like bristle support traverses the cup-like area like a cover. If the brush body as a whole is formed like a cup<br><br>
9<br>
and is traversed and covered by the cap-like bristle support, formation of a very flat brush with an inner cavity is possible which can be filled with a medium to be applied or also charged with cartridges, tablets, filled foamed or sponge inserts.<br>
The resilience of the bristle field is determined essentially by the thickness of the diaphragm-like covering part. The deformation possibilities increase with reduced thickness of the covering part. With electrically operated tooth brushes, a covering part thickness in the range between 0.5 and 3.0 mm has been shown to be reasonable. This has the essential advantage that the overall height of the brush is very low. Deformation of the cap-like bristle support and in particular of the covering part can be further adjusted by forming projections and/or recesses on the inner side of the bristle support and in particular of the covering part. The projections form reinforcements which impair deformation whereas the recesses define areas which are particularly soft for deformation.<br>
To prevent excessive deformation of the bristle support during use and also guarantee that the bristle support returns into its initial position without load, the inner side of the bristle support may be provided with at least one spring element supported on the brush body. During use, the covering part is deformed against the resilient force of the spring element which, when unloaded, returns the covering part into its initial position. The spring element may<br><br>
10<br>
preferably be formed by a shackle or bridge fashioned on the lower side of the covering part.<br>
In order to be able to also properly clean inclined surfaces, tilting of the bristle field relative to the brush body is advantageously possible. This can be easily achieved when the bridge is flexible in an axial direction i.e. essentially perpendicular to the covering part and the bristle field. Since the specific elasticity of the bridge is limited, the axial flexibility of the bridge can be assisted when at least sections thereof are formed as bellows.<br>
The bridge, extending on the outside of the projection of the brush body, moreover serves as a protective coating and in particular as mucous membrane protection for the user. Elements may be additionally integrated in the bridge which provide impact protection and which resiliently yield with contact. This can be achieved e.g. in that the bridge comprises elastically deformable projections on its outer peripheral surface which may have the shape of a ring, a loop or a punched tape.<br>
A possible embodiment may provide that the bridge extends in the edge area of the covering part. In an alternative, the covering part may project laterally i.e. radially beyond the bridge thereby forming a freely protruding edge projection. These freely protruding edge sections may be particularly flexible and thus contribute to protective mucous membrane massage. If, during use, a correspondingly equipped brush<br><br>
11<br>
meets an inclined surface area, the edge section bends relative to the covering part such that the inclined surface area is cleaned simultaneously on both abutting surfaces.<br>
Normally, the tensioning and frictional forces resulting from elastic deformation of the cap-like bristle support are sufficient for retaining same securely on the projection of the brush body. It is possible to provide special engagement means for fixing the bristle support on the brush body in a non-rotatable fashion.  Special engagement means may also be provided to which the bristle support is fixed on the brush body in a non-rotatable fashion in the form of e.g. sealing projections provided on the inside of the bridge which engage in corresponding recesses of the brush body thereby providing fixation in a non-rotatable and/or non-lifting fashion. Alternatively, the sealing projections may also be formed on the brush body and the recesses may be formed on the bridge.<br>
The dimensions of the cap-like bristle support are adjusted to the respective application. A relatively flat cap may be provided having a covering part with short bridges. However, it is also possible to design the cap-like bristle support like a stocking, i.e. for forming a longitudinal cylinder with relatively long bridges as is e.g. required for forming an interdental brush or individual rotating bristle bundles.<br>
The bristles may be pre-fabricated and mounted to the bristle support in a conventional fashion. Alternatively, it is also possible to form the bristles in one piece with the bristle<br><br>
12<br>
support and in particular to injection-mold them together using a one-component or two-component method. It is possible to form bristles of different shape, different materials and different orientation on the bristle support.<br>
When the cap-like bristle support has a cavity, the pressure increase occurring during deformation of the flexible bristle support in the cavity can be utilized for actuating an indicator element. The indicator element can e.g. be a displaceably disposed piston which is pushed outwardly when the cavity increases and is retracted into its initial position when the deformed bristle support is returned, thereby producing an indication of the pressing force which the user applies to the bristles. Alternatively or additionally, the medium contained in the cavity could change color under pressure to thereby also represent a pressure indication.<br>
The pressure increase in the cavity may also open an outlet valve for a medium to be applied which is contained in the cavity, thereby ensuring that the medium can exit the cavity only upon application of a corresponding pressure by the user.<br>
Deformation of the flexible bristle support can be used directly for adjusting an actuating element in that the displacement of partial areas of the wall of the cap-like bristle support occurring during deformation is converted directly into adjustment of a mechanical indicator.<br><br>

Fig. 1 shows the front part of a tooth brush 10 with a brush body 11 serving as handle comprising, at its front end, a block-like projection 11a serving as support. A flexible cap-<br><br>
18<br>
like bristle support 13 is drawn over the projection 11a and supports a plurality of bristles 12 on its upper side. Fig. 2 shows that the bristle support 13 comprises a flat diaphragmlike covering part 13a which supports the bristles 12 on its upper side and comprises, in the edge area on its lower side facing away from the bristles 12, a peripheral bridge 13 projecting downwardly. The inner dimensions of the bristle support 13 are somewhat smaller than the outer dimensions of the projection 11a such that it can be attached to the projection 11a under elastic deformation without play. Due to the elastic deformation, the peripheral bridge 13b of the bristle support 13 stretches over the projection 11a from the outside and is securely held thereon.<br>
The bristles 12 may extend parallel or at an angle to one another, wherein in the latter case, they project laterally over the bristle support thereby increasing the work surface. Alternatively, it is also possible to bend the bristles individually and/or orient them in different directions or crosswise.<br>
While the projection 11a represented in Fig. 1 comprises an essentially horizontal surface on which the covering part 13a of the bristle support 13 is level, in Fig. 3 the surface of the projection 11a is convex which gives the covering part 13a of the drawn-over bristle support 13 a likewise convex shape.<br><br>
19<br>
In accordance with the embodiment of figure 4, the covering part 13a also follows the surface structure of the projection 11a which is wavy in the present case.<br>
In accordance with figure 5, the covering part 13a of the bristle support 13 has a convex shape and is disposed at a separation from the surface of the projection 11a thereby forming a cavity 14 between the bristle support 13 and the projection 11. Upon exertion of external pressure onto the bristles 12, the bristle support 13 may resiliently yield towards the inside, whereby the fluid contained in the cavity 14, e.g. air, damps deformation of the bristle support 13. In a further development in accordance with figure 6, a foamed body 15 can be introduced into the cavity 14 whose specific elasticity damps deformation of the bristle support 13. The foamed body 15 may be filled with a liquid or gaseous medium to be applied, wherein the medium may exit through passages 16 (figure 7) formed in the covering part 13a of the bristle support 13.<br>
In the previous embodiments, the bristle support 13 is provided with bristles on the upper side of the covering part 13a only. Figure 8 shows an embodiment wherein the outer surface of the bridge 13b has also bristles 12. Therein, the bridge 13b for forming a longitudinal stocking-shaped hollow body may be relatively long (figure 9).<br>
The bristles 12 may be disposed over the entire surface of the outer side of the bristle support 13 or only on partial<br><br>
20<br>
areas thereof. Moreover, the bristles may have identical or different lengths and form, with their tip sections, a covering surface of any topographic shape.<br>
In the embodiment of the bristle support 13 shown in figure 10, a projection 18 serving as reinforcement is formed on the lower side of the covering part 13a by means of which the deformation characteristics of the covering part 13a change with external load and can be adjusted to the desired application. While the projection 18 increases the rigidity of the covering part 13a, the covering part 13a may also alternatively comprise recesses 19 which reduce the rigidity of the covering part (Fig. 11).<br>
In accordance with figures 12 and 13, spring elements 20 are provided or formed on the lower side of the covering part 13a which are supported on the upper side of the projection 11a. The spring elements 20 are compressed during external loading of the covering part 13a and guarantee that the covering part is forced back into its initial position after de-loading. In accordance with figure 12, the spring element 20 is formed by a strap-like shackle held at both ends on the covering part 13a. In figure 13, a double S-shaped support is provided as spring element which is mounted on its upper end to the covering part 13 and is supported with its lower end on the projection 11a.<br>
In accordance with figure 14, the bridge 13b of the bristle support 13 is formed sectionally as bellows 21 thereby<br><br>
21<br>
enabling tilting of the covering part 13a, having the bristles 12, relative to the projection 11a during use without the danger that the bristle support 13 slides off from the projection 11a. This provides good, resilient support of the bristles, even on an inclined cleaning surface.<br>
The bridge 13b abutting the side surface of the projection 11 in the mounted state also serves as a protective coating and, in particular in a tooth brush, as mucous membrane protection. Figures 15 and 16 additionally provide that the bridge 13b comprises, on its outer peripheral surface, elastically deformable projections 22 which are formed by sectionally wavy configuration of the bridge 13b in accordance with figure 16.<br>
Figures 17 and 18 show two embodiments wherein the covering part 13a projects laterally or radially outwardly over the bridge 13b thereby forming a freely protruding edge section 13c. In this fashion, the work surface provided with bristles 12 is increased and, due to the flexibility of the freely protruding edge section 13c, they can easily abut on and clean a curved or angled surface. Fig. 18 shows a further development, wherein the outer sections of the freely protruding edge sections 13c are bent downwardly thereby forming an outwardly curved, convex section.<br>
The deformability of the bristle support 13 is determined i.a. by its geometric design. To provide the peripheral<br><br>

bridge 13b, which essentially has a holding function, with sufficient stability and to simultaneously allow easy deformation of the covering part 13a, these two sections may have different wall thicknesses, as shown in Fig. 19. Therein, the slightly stronger bridge 13b continuously passes over into the relatively thin covering part 13a. To prevent excessive deformation in the central region of the covering part 13a, this area may have a larger wall thickness, e.g. a reinforcement 18 as represented in figure 20.<br>
To retain the bristle support 13 on the projection 11a in a non-rotatable fashion, the inner side of the bridge 13b is provided with a single recess 30 (shown in figure 21), which can engage with a correspondingly formed nose (not shown) of the projection 11a, Alternatively and in accordance with figure 22, the inner peripheral surface of the bridge 13b may be polygonal and, in particular, in accordance with the figure, octagonal and disposed on a corresponding polygonal projection.<br>
Fig. 23 shows the bristle support 13 as a longitudinal stocking-shaped cylinder with a relatively small covering part 13b supporting bristles on its upper side configured in the shape of a triangle. Such a bristle support may be used as a bristled cap for interdental brushes or as a removable cap for electric tooth brushes having individual rotating bristle bundles.<br><br>
23<br>
To secure the cap-shaped bristle support 13 on the projection 11a, the inner side of the bridge 13b, in the embodiment in accordance with figure 24, comprises a peripheral inward facing engagement nose 23 which can engage in a correspondingly formed recess of the projection 11a. In accordance with figure 25, the upper section Hal of the projection 11a is bulged to the outside and is undercut by the bridge 13b of the flexible bristle support 13. In a further embodiment in accordance with figure 26, the projection 11a is formed as a plate and is undercut by the bridge 13b of the attached cap-like bristle support 13.<br>
The bristle support 13 can be made from, one single material. However, figures 27 and 28 show that the covering part 13a and the bridge 13b can be produced from different flexible plastic materials, in particular via a two-component injection-molding process. In this fashion, the material properties of the individual areas can be well adapted to their required function during use. Alternatively (fig. 28), the covering part 13a and the bridge 13b may be prefabricated and connected to one another later by welding, gluing, clamping or in any other manner.<br>
As mentioned above, a cavity 14 may be formed between the projection 11a of the brush body 11 and the cap-like bristle support 13. Formation, of the cavity 14 is facilitated when sections of the projection 11a of the brush body 11 are cap-shaped or when it is entirely formed like a cap, as shown in<br><br>
24<br>
figure 29. A foamed insert is thereby inserted in the cavity 14.<br>
Fig. 30 shows an embodiment wherein a further dividing wall 13d extends between the inner wall of the bridge 13b of the bristle support 13 below the covering part 13a such that the cavity 14 is formed within the bristle support 13 between the upper covering part 13a and the lower dividing wall 13d. The further development shown in figure 31 is provided with a storage region 25 for a medium to be applied which is located below the cavity 14 in which a foamed insert 24 is disposed. The cavity 14 is separated from the storage region 25 by a dividing wall 31 provided with passages 26. The medium may flow from the storage region 25 through the passages 26 into the foamed insert 24 of the cavity 14 and is delivered therefrom to the bristles 12 via passages 16 in the upper covering part 13a.<br>
As shown in figure 32, the cavity 14 may be subdivided by inner dividing walls 32 into several separate chambers 14a, 14b, 14c which can accommodate various media which flow together and react following exit.<br>
Fig. 33 shows an embodiment. The bristles are not prefabricated by a spinning method and then mounted to the bristle support, rather are produced in one piece therewith using a one-or two-component injection-molding process.<br><br>
25<br>
Figures 34 to 39b show various embodiments wherein the load-related pressure increase in the cavity 14 occurring during deformation of the bristle support 13 is indicated by an indicator. In accordance with figure 34 a displaceable piston 27 is disposed in a connection piece-shaped section 13e of the bridge 13b of the bristle support 13. When the user presses from the outside on the bristles 12 or the covering part 13a (arrow D) , the volume of the cavity 14 is reduced and the inner pressure increases thereby pushing the piston 27 outwardly as indicated by arrow S in figure 34. The user can observe the pushed-out piston. The degree of displacement of the piston 27 indicates the inner pressure of the cavity 14 and thus the external pressure applied by the user. The displacement of the piston 27 can also serve for triggering further mechanical, acoustical and/or electrical signals.<br>
In accordance with figure 35, a support acting as spring 20 is formed on the lower side of the covering part 13a and is supported on the upper side of the projection 11a. Also in this case, a piston 27 is displaceably disposed in a passage of the bridge 13b which abuts with its inner end on the spring 20. If the user presses from the outside onto the bristles 12 or the covering part 13a (arrow D), the spring 20 is laterally deflected thereby outwardly displacing the piston 27, as shown by arrow S.<br>
In accordance with figure 36a, a thin-walled closing diaphragm 28 is formed on the outer side of a pipe socket-shaped passage 36 formed in the bridge 13b which, with<br><br>
26<br>
increasing inner pressure, can be blown up like a balloon, as indicated in figure 36b, thereby providing an indication of the pressure applied by the user onto the bristles (arrow D).<br>
In accordance with figures 37a and 37b, a passage 37 is directly formed in the wall of the bridge 13b and sealed by a closing diaphragm 28 which can be expanded and - as shown in figure 38b - bulges outwardly with increased inner pressure in the cavity 14. Therein, the closing diaphragm 28 may be pre-fabricated as a separate structural part and then mounted in the passage 37. It is, however, also possible to injection-mold the closing diaphragm 28 on the bridge 13b, in one piece.<br>
A similar closing diaphragm 28 may be formed in a passage 34 of a lid 33 closing the lower side of the bristle support 13 (figure 38a) which curves downwardly with increased inner pressure (figure 38b).<br>
In accordance with the embodiment of figures 39a and 39b, an indicator bar 29 is displaceably guided in the lid 33 and is formed, at its upper end, on the covering part 13a. When the covering part 13a is downwardly deformed by application of external pressure, the indictor bar 29 is pushed downwardly out of the lid 33 (Fig. 39b) and can be directly used as a pressure indicator or, as described above, for triggering a corresponding signal.<br><br>
27<br>
Fig. 40 shows an embodiment with which one cap-like bristle support 13 is disposed on each of two different sides of a projection 11a of a brush body 11. If the inner space of the projection 11a in accordance with figure 41 is divided by a dividing wall lla2 into two separate chambers, different media can be disposed therein to each be associated with one specific bristle support 13, such that the user can select the one or other medium depending on the orientation of the brush.<br>
In accordance with the embodiment shown in figures 42a and 42b, a passage 16 is provided in the covering part 13a which can be closed or opened by means of an adjustable valve element 35. The valve element 35 is disposed on the lower side of the covering part 13a via a strap formed thereon as a single piece and can be adjusted between the closing and opening position under elastic deformation of the strap 34.<br><br>
