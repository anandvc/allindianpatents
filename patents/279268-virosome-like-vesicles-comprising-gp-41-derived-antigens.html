				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a novel virosome-like vesicle suitable for<br>
inducing an immune response against a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),<br>
pharmaceutical compositions comprising said virosome-like vesicles, method of treatment<br>
and kit for inducing an immune response against a human immunodeficiency virus.<br>
The HIV is a retrovirus that gradually destroys the immune system and<br>
ultimately leads to the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).<br>
HIV exists under many different versions like members of a large family.<br>
By sequencing the viral genomes, researchers have been able to map out the<br>
family tree of HIV. At the root of the tree, there are three groups called M, N and O, group<br>
M being responsible for the current AIDS pandemic.<br>
Group M is split into nine genetic subtypes, also called nine clades (designated<br>
A through K, with no E or I). The original definition of clades was based on short genomic<br>
sequences, mostly within the HIV envelope protein (Env: gpl60).<br>
These nine clades have uneven geographic distribution patterns. Clade C<br>
circulates in South Afiica, India and parts of China. Clade A and D are common in East<br>
Afiica and clade B is common in North &amp; South America and Western Europe. According<br>
to the statistics, the four clades A, B, C and D account for over 90% of all infection<br>
worldwide, and clade C represents the world dominant HIV by itself (&gt;60%).<br>
Until recently, vaccine development was focusing on clade B strains, which<br>
dominate the epidemic in industrialized countries but cause only about 12% of infections<br>
globally.<br>
Most of the vaccine approaches against HIV-1 have targeted the viral envelope<br>
(Env) glycoproteins because they are the major surface antigens expressed on virions and<br>
by HIV-1 infected cells. The native HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein is an heterotrimer<br>
containing three gpl20 proteins non-covalently associated with three gp41 glycoproteins.<br>
The three most potent HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies yet identified, bl2, 2G12<br>
and 2F5, have a high affinity for the native trimer.<br>
There is increasing effort to develop recombinant proteins as candidate<br>
vaccines that are better antigenic mimics than the native envelope glycoprotein complex<br>
such as the gpl20/gp41.<br>
 <br>
However, due to numerous (at least fifteen) molecular homologies between the<br>
gpl20/gp41 and molecules of the immune system, many potential cross-reactivities events<br>
may occur leading to possible harmful autoimmune phenomena.<br>
Various strategies have been described in order to dampen those cross-<br>
reactivities for obtaining anti-HIV vaccines with no or less cross reactivities with human<br>
proteins as the introduction of mutations and/or deletions in various part of the gp41<br>
proteins as described in US 6,455,265 and WO 2005/010033.<br>
However there is still a need for a vaccine that allows for inducing a versatile<br>
immune response against HIV infection, and in particular- HIV-type 1 infection.<br>
There is also a need for the development of non-clade B vaccines, such as, for<br>
example, clade C strains.<br>
There is also a need for the development of a vaccine with broad inhibitory<br>
spectrum allowing for cross-clade inhibition.<br>
There is a need for a vaccine allowing to induce a humoral and/or cellular<br>
immime response against HIV infection.<br>
There is a need for a vaccine allowing to induce an immune response against<br>
HIV infection at the mucosal surface level and at the blood level.<br>
There is a need for a vaccine suitable for inducing mucosal sIgA antibodies<br>
and systemic IgG antibodies capable of interfering with HIV entry across the mucosa and<br>
early cell infection under the mucosa.<br>
There is a need for a vaccine suitable for inhibiting or reducing HIV entry<br>
across mucosal tissues through various mechanisms such as transcytosis.<br>
It is an object of the invention to satisfy to all those above-mentioned needs.<br>
Therefore, according to one of its first aspect, the instant invention is related to<br>
a virosome-like vesicle comprising at least a gp41-derived antigen or an analogue thereof,<br>
said gp41-derived antigen being located to the external surface of and/or encapsulated<br>
inside said vesicle and being in a convenient configuration for conferring said virosome-<br>
like vesicle with an ability to induce an immune response against a gp41 protein of a<br>
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).<br>
In particular, the HIV may be of type 1.<br>
The inventors have surprisingly observed that it was possible to induce an<br>
immime response at the mucosal surface level as well as a systemic immune response by<br>
 <br>
immunizing rabbits either intra-muscularly or intra-nasally with virosome like vesicles<br>
comprising a gp41 derived antigen attached at the external surface.<br>
More particularly, the inventors have observed the presence of specific<br>
antibodies anti-gp41 protein (mucosal IgA and IgG) in cervico-vaginal and intestinal<br>
secretions from rabbits following intra-muscularly or intra-nasally immunization.<br>
Specific IgG anti-HIV antibodies were also identified in the sera of those<br>
rabbits.<br>
Additionally, those specific antibodies were able to inhibit transcytosis of HIV<br>
in different experiments.<br>
The inventors have also observed that antibodies anti-gp41 (mucosal IgA, and<br>
IgG) may be obtained in vaginal secretions and rectal washes of female macaques<br>
immunized with a vaccine of the invention administered intramuscularly and/or<br>
intranasally.<br>
Those secretions and washes were demonstrated as significantly inhibiting<br>
HIV transcytosis of various primary clades (B and C) on a human epithelium model.<br>
Therefore, a HIV vaccine according to the invention exhibits, as a property, an<br>
ability of eliciting immune responses (CTL and/or antibodies) in the blood as well as at the<br>
primary entry site which are the reproductive-genital tracts and intestine/rectal mucosal<br>
tissues.<br>
This property is particularly advantageous, because HIV infection may<br>
comprise a viral transcytosis step on mucosal surface that facilitates virus translocation<br>
and spreading into the body.<br>
Semen and cervico-vaginal secretions may potentially transmit HIV to the<br>
gastrointestinal, anorectal and genito-urinary tracts because they contain cell-free HIV<br>
particles and numerous HIV-infected mononuclear cells.<br>
It is also believed that the major site of early viral replication in HIV-infected<br>
subjects is the intestine and other mucosal sites. This is mainly because the vast majority<br>
of susceptible cells (intestinal CD4+ T cells) reside in mucosal tissues and within the first<br>
few weeks post-HIV exposure, these cells are destroyed.<br>
Within the meaning of the invention, the expression "virosome-like vesicle" is<br>
intended to mean a vesicle comprising at least in part virosomal lipids and fusion proteins<br>
or fragments thereof, said fragments having the fusion activity and characteristics of the<br>
 <br>
complete fusion protein, at least in an extent serving for the fusion with a biological<br>
membrane of the target cell.<br>
WO 2004/07800 has proposed virosome-like vesicles as vectors for malaria<br>
antigens cross-linked to the external surface of said vesicles.<br>
Within the meaning of the invention, the expression "gp41-derived antigen" is<br>
intended to refer to any part or fragment, as well as the whole protein, of a gp41 protein<br>
naturally occurring in any strain of HIV or comprising any modification (aminoacid<br>
mutation or chemical modification) which does not substantially affect its antigenic<br>
properties.<br>
The antigenic properties of the virosome-like vesicles of the invention follow<br>
from the convenient configuration of the gp41-antigen encapsulated inside and/or located<br>
to the surface of said vesicles.<br>
WO 2004/045582 describes the preparation of virosome-like vesicles that may<br>
comprise gp41/gpl20 protein, but which are not concerned with antigenic properties of<br>
this protein but only with its fusogenic property.<br>
According to another of its aspects, the instant invention is directed to a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising virosome-like vesicles according to the invention.<br>
According to another of its aspects, the instant invention is also related to a use<br>
of at least one virosome-like vesicle in accordance with the instant invention for the<br>
manufacture of a pharmaceutical composition intending to induce an adaptative immune<br>
response and/or an innate inunune response directed against a gp41 protein of a human<br>
immunodeficiency virus.<br>
According to an embodiment, an object of the invention is to induce an IgG<br>
and mucosal IgA. Mucosal IgA may be a mixed between IgA and secretory IgA response.<br>
According to another embodiment, an object of the invention is to inhibit or<br>
reduce HIV transcytosis, in particular at musosal level.<br>
Within the meaning of the invention, the expression "adaptative immune<br>
response" is intended to refer to an immune response relying upon the activation of the<br>
immune system component implying specificity and memory with respect to an antigen or<br>
a pathogen.<br>
Such a response may be highly specific toward an antigen or a pathogen and is<br>
more effective on second and subsequent encounter, with the antigen or pathogen.<br>
 <br>
Such adaptative immune response may rely on the activation of lymphocytes,<br>
such as T-cells or B-cells.<br>
Within the meaning of the invention, the expression "innate immune response"<br>
is intended to refer to a response relying upon non-specific recognition system and does<br>
not alter upon subsequent encounter with the antigen or pathogen.<br>
Such system may rely upon immune cells such as, for example, monocytes<br>
macrophages or natural killer (NK) cells.<br>
According to another of its aspects, the instant invention is also directed to a<br>
method of treatment and/or prophylaxis of a HIV infection comprising at least a step of<br>
administration to an individual in need thereof an effective amount of virosome-like<br>
vesicles in accordance with the invention.<br>
According to another of its aspects, the instant invention is also directed to a<br>
kit for inducing an immune response against a gp41 protein of a human immunodeficiency<br>
virus comprising:<br>
at least a first virosome-like vesicle according to the invention comprising<br>
at least a first gp41-derived antigen, and<br>
at least a second virosome-like vesicle according to the invention<br>
comprising at least a second gp41-derived antigen,<br>
said first and second gp41-derived antigens being different one fi-om each other.<br>
VIROSOME-LIKE VESICLE<br>
A virosome-like vesicle suitable for the instant invention comprises at least<br>
virosomal lipids and exhibits fiasion membrane properties.<br>
According to an embodiment, a virosome-like vesicle of the invention may<br>
comprise an unilamellar lipid bilayer.<br>
According to an embodiment, a virosome-like vesicle of the invention may be<br>
a bi- or a multilamellar vesicle.<br>
According to an embodiment, a virosome-like vesicle may have a diameter<br>
generally in the range of 100 to 600 nm, and in particular a diameter from 100 nm to 300<br>
nm, and in particular from 200 nm to 400 nm.<br>
Virosome-like vesicles of the invention may be spherical unilamellar vesicles<br>
with a mean diameter with approximately 150 nm.<br>
 <br>
Virosome-like vesicles comprise incorporated into the lipid bilayer fusion<br>
proteins or fragments thereof.<br>
The expression "fusion proteins or fragments thereof is intended to refer to<br>
proteins or fragments thereof capable of inducing and/or promoting a fusion reaction<br>
between a virosome-like vesicle membrane and a biological membrane of the target cell.<br>
For example, fusion proteins may be influenza membrane glycoproteins such<br>
as hemagglutinin (HA).<br>
According to an embodiment, at least two different fusion proteins or<br>
fragments thereof may be used, that may display distinct fusion characteristic.<br>
According to another embodiment, distinct fusion characteristics may be, for<br>
example, different sensitivity to temperature, to ion concentration, to acidity, to cell type<br>
and to tissue type specificity.<br>
According to an embodiment, a virosome-like vesicle may contain fusion<br>
proteins that mediate fusion at two distinct temperatures.<br>
According to another embodiment, different viral hemagglutinin (HA) fusion<br>
proteins may be used to construct a virosome-like vesicle.<br>
As an example, HA molecules from both X-31 and PR8/34 virions may be<br>
capable of catalyzing two distinct fusion reactions at distinct temperatures.<br>
Fusion proteins with different fusion characteristics may be derived from<br>
different influenza strains, as other viruses, such as the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) El<br>
protein, the Seliki forest virus (SFV) El protein, or the Sendai virus F protein.<br>
The specific fusion mechanism of the virosome-like vesicles allows targeting<br>
of the Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC I) or class II (MHC II).<br>
An antigen located to the external surface of a virosome-like vesicle may be<br>
degraded upon the endosomal fusion within the endosome and may be presented to the<br>
immune system by MHC class II receptors.<br>
An antigen encapsulated inside a virosome-like vesicle may be delivered to the<br>
cytosol during the fusion event and may enter the MHC class I pathway.<br>
Therefore, a virosome-like vesicle may be able to induce a humoral and/or a<br>
cellular immune response.<br>
In particular, a virosome-like vesicle may be able to induce IgA, such as<br>
secretory IgA, as well as IgG.<br>
 <br>
Protocols of preparation are well-known by the skilled person in the art.<br>
Suitable protocols for the invention are described, for example, in WO 2004/045582 or EP<br>
0 538 437, which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
According to an embodiment, a virosome-like vesicle according to the<br>
invention may be obtained either from a virosome vesicle as such, or from a vesicle<br>
resulting from the fusion of a virosome vesicle with a liposome vesicle.<br>
Preparation of virosome vesicles may be made by any known method of the<br>
skilled person in the art such as described by Bron et al., Methods Enzymol. 22 0: 313-<br>
331, 30 19 93, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Virosome vesicles, for example, may be reconstituted from original viral<br>
membrane lipids and spike glycoproteins after solubilization of, for example, intact<br>
influenza virus with octaethyleneglycol monododecyl ether, sedimentation of the<br>
nucleocapsid (the viral glycoproteins and lipids will remain in the supernatant), and<br>
removal of the detergent in the supernatant with a hydrophobic resin (Big-Beads SM2)<br>
(Stegmann et al., Traffic 1: 598-604,1987).<br>
Preparation of virosome vesicles containing HAs from different strains of<br>
viruses, may be performed with, equal amounts of proteins of those viruses solubilized<br>
with the non-ionic detergent octaethyleneglycol monododecyl ether.<br>
After removal of the detergent with Bio-Beads SM2, virosome-like vesicles<br>
containing different types of fusion proteins may be formed.<br>
According to one embodiment, a virosome-like vesicle according to the<br>
invention may be obtained from a fiision of a virosome vesicle with a liposome vesicle.<br>
Therefore, according to one embodiment, a virosome-like vesicle of the<br>
invention may comprise virosomal and liposomal lipids.<br>
According to one embodiment, a virosome-like vesicle of the invention may<br>
comprise a lipid bilayer comprising lipids chosen from cationic lipids, synthetic lipids,<br>
glycolipids, phospholipids, glycerophospholipids, glycosphingolipids like<br>
galactosylceramid, sphingolipids, cholesterol and derivatives thereof<br>
Such lipids may be used to better mimic the viral membrane and raft<br>
microdomain in order to favour optimal gp41 oligomers such as di-, tri- or tetramers.<br>
According to another embodiment, virosome-like vesicles according to the<br>
invention may comprise lipids favouring the folding of a gp41-derived antigen in order to<br>
more effectively mimic the natural folding of said antigen.<br>
 <br>
Phospholipids may comprise in particular phosphatidylcholine,<br>
sphingomyelin, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol,<br>
phosphatidic acid, cardiolipin and phosphatidylinositol with varying fatty acyl<br>
compositions.<br>
Cationic lipids may be chosen from DOTMA (N-[l-(2,3-dioleylaxy)propyl]-<br>
N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride), DOTAP (N-[l-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-<br>
trimethylammonium chloride, DODAC (N,N-dioleyl-N,N,- dimethylammonium chloride),<br>
DDAB (didodecyldimethylammonium bromide) and stearylamine or other aliphatic<br>
amines and the like.<br>
The lipids used in the invention may be formulated as small unilamellar<br>
liposomes in a mixture with DOPE (dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine) that is widely<br>
used as helper lipid to facilitate disruption of the endosomal membrane.<br>
According to an embodiment, the liposomal lipids of the liposomes may<br>
comprise POPC/DDAB.<br>
According to another embodiment, co-emulsifying agent may be also used in<br>
order to improve the rigidity and/or the sealing of the vesicles.<br>
As example of co-emulsifying agent, mention may be made of cholesterol and<br>
derivatives, as for example cholesterol ester charged or neutral as cholesterol sulphate;<br>
derivative with sterol backbone, as for example derivative from vegetal origin as<br>
phytosterol (sitosterol, sigmasterol,...); ceramides; and mixtures thereof<br>
A gp41-derived antigen may be incorporated inside liposomes vesicles before<br>
fusion with virosomes.<br>
Encapsulation of at least one antigen and/or adjuvant as indicated below into<br>
liposomes may be performed by any method known in the art, including the procedures<br>
described in Monnard et al., Biochim. Biophys.; Acta 1329: 39-50; 1997, in Wagner et al.,<br>
J. Liposome Res., 12(3) 271-283, 2002, or in Oberholzer et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta<br>
1416: 57-68i 1999, among many other well-known methods.<br>
In a particular embodiment, high liposomal encapsulation efficiencies may be<br>
achieved by the freeze/thaw technique used to prepare pure lipid vesicles.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the reaction products of a<br>
virosome-liposome fusion reaction may be subjected to a nucleopore extrusion step in<br>
order to reduce its size.<br>
 <br>
As for example extrusion through 200 nm pores may yield vesicles of<br>
approximately half of the original size.<br>
Most particles may range from 100 to 300 nm.<br>
After resizing, the products of the liposome-virosome fusion may be virosome-<br>
like vesicles that may comprise a gp41-derived antigen in their internal cavity and may be<br>
still capable of undergoing a second fusion step, under different conditions, with<br>
biological membranes in order to deliver said antigen.<br>
A gp41-derived antigen may be located to the external surface of and/or<br>
encapsulated inside a vesicle of the invention as described below.<br>
According to one embodiment, a virosome-like vesicle of the invention may<br>
further comprise a targeting moiety that target said vesicle to a specific cell or tissue.<br>
A suitable targeting moiety may be chosen from a cell-surface receptor, a<br>
chemokine, a cytokine, a growth-factor, an antibody or an antibody fragment, a peptide<br>
sequence with specificity or specific charge complementary to an adhesion molecule such<br>
as an integrin.<br>
A targeting moiety may be incorporated into, or attached to the lipid bilayer of<br>
said vesicle, by any known techniques of the skilled person in the art.<br>
According to another embodiment, a virosome-like vesicle in accordance with<br>
the invention may further comprise an additional antigen.<br>
According to one embodiment, a virosome-like vesicle in accordance with the<br>
invention may fiirther comprise from one to ten additional antigen(s), and in particular<br>
from 2 to 4 additional antigen(s).<br>
Additional antigens may be chosen from HIV-derived peptides, and in<br>
particular peptides derived from structural proteins as encoded by env (gpl20, gp41), gag<br>
(p9, pi7, p24) and pol (p66, p32) genes and from regulatory proteins as encoded by nef,<br>
rev or tat genes, and mixtures thereof<br>
GP41-DERIVED ANTIGEN<br>
A gp41-derived antigen suitable for the instant invention may be any part of<br>
the gp41 protein, as well as the gp41 protein in its whole, and analogues thereof<br>
 <br>
Within the meaning of the invention, the expression "analogue thereof with<br>
respect to a gp41-derived antigen intends to refer to a peptide having substantial (at least<br>
85%, in particular at least 90 % and more particularly at least 95 %) amino acid sequence<br>
identity or homology (i.e. aminoacid residue replaced with an aminoacid residue of the<br>
same family, of similar polarity or charge, for example) with the amino-acid sequence of<br>
said gp41-derived antigen, and which has similar or conserved biological properties, in<br>
particular with respect to binding antigen portion of immunoglobulin directed to the gp41<br>
protein.<br>
According to an embodiment, a gp41-derived antigen suitable for the invention<br>
may be devoid of fusogenic property with respect to cell membrane.<br>
According to one embodiment, a gp41-derived peptide located to the external<br>
surface of virosome-like vesicle of the invention may be :<br>
-	covalently linked with a lipid of said virosome-like vesicle, or<br>
-	intercalated into a lipid bilayer of said virosome-like vesicle by a peptide<br>
transmembrane domain distinct of a wild-type peptide transmembrane domain of a wild-<br>
type gp41 protein.<br>
Accordingly, a covalently linked gp41-derived antigen may comprise any<br>
modification required to located said gp41-derived antigen to the external surface of a<br>
virosome-like vesicle according to the invention.<br>
Modifications of a gp41-antigen suitable for the invention and methods for<br>
cross-linking said modified gp41-antigen to the external surface of a virosome-like vesicle<br>
may be as those described in WO 2004/078099.<br>
According to one embodiment, a gp41-derived antigen may be covalently<br>
linked to the external surface of a virosome-like vesicle by crosslinking with a lipid or a<br>
phospholipid.<br>
According to another embodiment, a gp41-derived antigen may be covalently<br>
linked to the external surface of a virosome-like vesicle by cross-linking with a<br>
carbohydrate.<br>
According to an embodiment, a covalently linked gp41-derived antigen may<br>
comprise at least one N- or C-terminally positioned cross-linking residue.<br>
For example, cross-linking residue mat be chosen from cysteine (Cys) or<br>
lysine (Lys).<br>
 <br>
According to another embodiment a covalently linked gp41-derived antigen<br>
may further comprise at least one spacer residue between said N- or C-terminally<br>
positioned cross-linking residues and a corresponding N- or C-terminal gp41-derived<br>
antigen extremity.<br>
A suitable spacer residue may be chosen, for example, from Gly (glycine), Ala<br>
(alanine), Ser (serine), Asp (aspartate), Lys (lysine). Gin (glutamine). His (histidine), lie<br>
(isoleucine) and Leu (leucine) residues.<br>
From 2 to 12, in particular from 3 to 10, and more particularly from 4 to 8,<br>
spacer residues may be linked to form spacer sequences.<br>
Suitable spacer sequences may be chosen, for example, from Gly-Gly or Lys-<br>
Gly.<br>
Crosslinking of a gp41-derived antigen to the surface of a virosome-like<br>
vesicle may be, for example, performed by the use of amphiphilic PEG derivatives, a<br>
phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), a phosphatidylcholine (PC), a phosphatidylserine, a<br>
cholesterol, or a mixture thereof, readily incorporated into lipids bilayer.<br>
Cross-linking of a gp41-derived antigen to a lipid of a virosome-like vesicle of<br>
the invention may be performed by any method known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The cross-linking may be operated in a lipid solution and the lipid-peptide<br>
conjugate may be subsequently incorporated into a virosome-like vesicle.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, a gp41-derived antigen may be<br>
linked to a lipid of a vesicle of the invention, for example, by a bifunctionnal succinate<br>
linker, in particular a γ-maleinidobutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester or a N-γ-<br>
maleimidobutyryloxy-succinimide-ester.<br>
According to an embodiment, a gp41-derived antigen, and more particularly<br>
an intercalated gp41-derived antigen, may be devoid of its peptide transmembrane domain.<br>
A suitable intercalated gp41-derived antigen may have its peptide<br>
transmembrane domain replaced with a distinct peptide transmembrane domain.<br>
Such modified gp41-derived antigen may be a chimeric protein.<br>
Within the meaning of the invention, the expression "chimeric protein" refers<br>
to a protein that may contain one or more region from a protein and one or more region<br>
from one or more other, distinct, proteins.<br>
 <br>
For the purpose of the invention, any transmembrane domain of any protein<br>
may be suitable to intercalate a gp41-derived antigen into the lipid bilayer of a virosome-<br>
like vesicle of the invention.<br>
According to one embodiment, one may use transmembrane domains that may<br>
favour oligomerization (as to obtain dimers, trimers or tetramers) such as transmembrane<br>
of growth factors receptors or envelope proteins from viruses.<br>
As example of transmembrane domain that may convene to the instant<br>
invention, mention may be made of transmembrane domain obtained from cell surface<br>
receptor like CD4 receptor (for example as set forth as SEQ ID NO 5), cytokine receptor,<br>
as for example IL-1 receptor, EGF receptor, VEGF receptor, any G-protein coupled<br>
receptors, any tyrosine kinase receptors, viral transmembrane domain derived from<br>
envelop proteins of viruses such as viruses of the rhabdovirus family or the poxvirus<br>
family. Suitable virus protein for the invention may be for example the vesicular stomatis<br>
virus protein G (VSV-G).<br>
Such transmembrane domains are well known in the art, and may be easily<br>
identified by a skilled person in the art.<br>
A chimeric protein suitable for the instant invention may be obtained by any<br>
genetic engineering techniques known by the skilled person in the art, such as described in<br>
"Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual" (2ND Ed.) Sanbrook et al., 1990, Coldspring<br>
Harbor Laboratory, Coldspring Harbor Press N.Y. (Sanbrook).<br>
According to another embodiment, a gp41-derived antigen may be provided to<br>
the external surface of a virosome-like vesicle under a mono-, di-, tri- and more<br>
particularly under a tetrameric form, and mixtures thereof<br>
Therefore, the amount of gp41-derived antigen to be used to prepare a<br>
virosome-like vesicle in accordance with the invention may be adjusted by any routine<br>
protocol known by the skilled person in the art to obtain the desired mono- or multimeric<br>
form.<br>
According to an embodiment, a gp41-derived antigen may be located to the<br>
external surface by its N- or C-terminal extremity.<br>
According to one embodiment, a gp41-derived antigen may be located to the<br>
external surface by its C-terminal extremity.<br>
 <br>
According to one embodiment, a gp41-derived antigen may be located to the<br>
external surface by its N-terminal extremity.<br>
According to an embodiment, a gp41-derived antigen may be encapsulated<br>
inside a virosome-like vesicle of the invention.<br>
A gp41-derived antigen may be encapsulated by a virosome, by methods well<br>
known in the art.<br>
For example, a solution of purified influenza A/Singapore hemagglutinin<br>
obtained as described previously by J.J. Skehe and G.C. Schild (The polypeptide<br>
composition of influenza A viruses. Virology 44 (1971) 396-408) may be prepared by<br>
dissolution of a pellet of hemagglutinin centrifuged into a solution of PBS-OEG<br>
(phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) dissolved in PBS containing<br>
octanethyleneglycolmonodecylether (OEG).<br>
Gp41-derived antigens and phospholipids may be added to the hemagglutinin-<br>
solution, mixed, sonicated then centrifuged. Virosomes may be then formed, as previously<br>
described, by detergent removal for example using BioRad SM Bio-Beads.<br>
According to another example, a gp41-derived antigen may be encapsulated<br>
into liposomes using methods such as previously described or as described in<br>
Christodoulides et al.. Microbiology 144:3027-3037 (1998), before the fusion of said<br>
liposomes vesicles with virosomes vesicles.<br>
According to another embodiment, when encapsulated into a virosome-like<br>
vesicle of the invention, a gp41-derived antigen may also be provided under a mono- or<br>
multimeric form as previously indicated.<br>
According to an embodiment, a gp41-derived antigen that may be used in the<br>
instant invention may be chosen from any HIV clades.<br>
Suitable HIV clades for the invention may be for example HIV from A, B, C<br>
or D clades.<br>
More particularly, a gp41-derived antigen may be from HIV type C clades.<br>
A suitable gp41-derived antigen may comprise in part any conservative amino-<br>
acid substitution (and/or insertion and/or deletion) and/or chemical modification (such as<br>
cyclization) with respect to the naturally occurring of the gp41-derived antigen, the<br>
implementation of which may rely upon the routine skill of a skilled person in the art.<br>
 <br>
According to one embodiment, a gp41-derived antigen that may convene to<br>
implement the instant invention may be a peptide of amino acids sequence represented in<br>
all or part by a sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO 1, obtained from the HIV-1 strain HxB2,<br>
or an analogue thereof<br>
In one embodiment, a gp41-derived antigen may be a gp41 engineered loop<br>
proteins derived from the wild-type amino acids sequences of the gp41 glycoproteins of<br>
HIV.<br>
As example of gp41-derived antigens that may be useful to carry out the<br>
instant invention mention may be made of gp41-derived antigens obtained by introducing<br>
in the immunodominant regions some mutations (deletion, substitution and/or insertion) in<br>
order to reduce the homology with the human interleukine-2 (IL-2) as to avoid or reduce<br>
the risk of triggering an autoimmune reaction. Such gp41-derived antigens are in particular<br>
described in WO 2005/010033, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In the present application, "mutation" refers to any modification of a region<br>
(optionally reduced to a single amino acid residue) of a polypeptide, by physical means,<br>
chemical means (covalent or non-covalent modification) and/or biological means<br>
(mutations by substitution, deletion and/or insertion of one or more amino acids), leading<br>
to the modification of the fimctional potentials of the constituent amino acid(s) of said<br>
region, termed "mutated region". By way of example, it is possible to carry out mutations<br>
leading to the modification of an aminoacid of L series into D series, the abolition,<br>
acquisition and/or modulation of the properties of disulfide bridges, hydrogen bonds,<br>
electrostatic interactions and/or hydrophobic interactions, the modification of the capacity<br>
of a protein to form a heterocomplex, or alternatively, in the case of an oligomeric protein,<br>
the modification of the state of oligomerization or of the stability of the oligomer.<br>
The modification of the immunodominant regions may result in the<br>
introduction in, or replacement of part of, the loop with a hydrophilic and non or weakly<br>
immunogenic, flexible linker and optionally with the introduction of mutation(s).<br>
Gp41-derived antigen may include furthermore at least one mutation in its<br>
immunodominant region, which give in vitro a cross-reaction, of the B type and/or the T<br>
type, with a host protein and in particular with IL-2.<br>
Some of the mutations decisive to impact this change in the antigenicity are<br>
disclosed in US 6,455,265 and WO 2005/010033 which teachings are incorporated by<br>
reference herein in their entirety.<br>
 <br>
According to an embodiment, a gp41-derived antigen suitable for the instant<br>
invention may be a peptide called PI and may be a peptide of amino acid sequence<br>
represented in all or part by a sequence chosen from SEQ ID NO 2, SEQ ID NO 3 or an<br>
analogue thereof<br>
The peptide PI corresponds to an amino acid sequence present in the HIV<br>
envelope protein ectodomain gp41 that is located at the surface of the viral particles before<br>
the viruses interact with target cells. As example, in the HIV-1 HxB2 strain, this sequence<br>
is comprised from amino acid 649 to amino acid 683 of the wild-type gp41 protein.<br>
A gp41-derived antigen useful for the invention may also include<br>
modifications such as truncation of a part of the amino acids sequence at the N- or C-<br>
terminal extremities or addition of peptide sequence to produce chimeric protein, as<br>
described in WO 2005/010033, or as previously described.<br>
As example of a gp41-derived antigen suitable for the invention, it may be<br>
envisioned the peptide P1 sequence comprising an addition of a Lys-Gly-Cys spacer at the<br>
C-terminal position, as, for example, set forth as SEQ ID NO 4.<br>
ADJUVANTS<br>
According to an embodiment, the immunostimulatory effect of virosome-like<br>
vesicles of the invention may be further increased by associating those virosome-like<br>
vesicles with at least one adjuvant.<br>
Said adjuvant may be encapsulated inside and/or incorporated in the lipid<br>
bilayer of, and/or freely combined with said vesicle.<br>
According to one embodiment, a virosome-like vesicle may additionally<br>
comprise at least one adjuvant enhancing and/or mediating an immune response chosen<br>
from an innate immune response and/or an adaptative immune response.<br>
An adaptative immune response may be chosen from a TH1 and/or TH2<br>
immune response.<br>
Usable adjuvants may enhance the immunological response by activating<br>
antigen presenting cells (APC), macrophages and/or stimulating specific sets of<br>
lymphocytes.<br>
An adjuvant that may convene to the instant invention may be any ligand<br>
suitable for the activation of a pathogen recognition receptor (PRR) expressed in and on<br>
dentritic cells (DCs) or other antigen presenting cells.<br>
 <br>
Ligands activating the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) may also convene for the<br>
purpose of the invention. Those receptors are member of the PRR family and are widely<br>
expressed on a variety of innate immune cells, including DCs, macrophages, mast cells<br>
and neutrophils.<br>
As example of ligands activating TLR, mention may be made, with respect of<br>
TLR4 of LPS from E. coli, taxol, RSV fusion protein, and host heat shock proteins 60 and<br>
70, with respect of TLR2 of peptidoglycan of Staphylococcus aureus, lipoproteins from M.<br>
tuberculosis, and Sacharomyces cerevisiae zymosan, and highly purified P. gingivalis<br>
LPS, with respect of TLR3 of dsRNA, with respect of TLRS of flagellin, with respect<br>
TLR7 of synthetic compounds imidazoquinolines and with respect of TLR9 of certain<br>
types of CpG-rich DNA.<br>
Other useful adjuvants for the invention may be T helper epitopes.<br>
A T helper epitope is a peptide usually derived from exogenous proteins that<br>
have undergone proteolytic degradation and processing within the endocytic pathway of<br>
antigen presenting cells (APCs). In those cells the Major Histocompatibility Complex of<br>
class II (MHC II) transported to endosomes of the endocytic pathway associate with those<br>
peptides. This complex transported to the surface of the APCs may interact with a specific<br>
T cell receptor of T lymphocytes CD4+ leading to their activation.<br>
According to the helper epitope, the T cell response may be of TH1 and/or TH2<br>
type.<br>
TH1 epitopes favouring a CTL response and TH2 epitopes favouring a humoral<br>
response are known in the art.<br>
As example of TH1-oriented response epitope mention may be made of the<br>
mellitin derived peptides identified in WO 2005/049647.<br>
As example of other TH2-oriented response epitope one may mention pan DR<br>
helper T cell epitope (PADRE). This epitope is engineered to bind most common HLA-<br>
DR molecules with high affinity and to act as a powerful immunogen. The PADRE HTL<br>
epitope has been shown to augment the potency of vaccines designed to stimulate a<br>
cellular immune response (Alexander J. et al, Immunol Res. 1998;18(2):79-92).<br>
According to an embodiment, an adjuvant that may be used with the virosome-<br>
like vesicles of the present invention may be chosen from aluminum salts, aluminum<br>
phosphate gels, mycobacteria such as BCG, M. Vaccae, or corynebacterium parvum,<br>
peptides, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, muramyl dipeptides and tripeptide derivatives.<br>
 <br>
monophosphoryl Lipid A, interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-12, GM-CSF, ligands from tlie<br>
chemokine family, such as RANTES (Regulated upon Activation Normal T cell Expressed<br>
and Secreted), a lipoprotein of Gram+ bacteria, a yeast cell wall component, a double-<br>
stranded RNA, a lipopolysaccharide of Gram" bacteria, flagellin, a U-rich single-stranded<br>
viral RNA, a CpG containing DNA, a Suppressor 6f Cytokine Signalling small interfering<br>
RNA (SOCS siRNA), mellitin derived peptides, a pan DR epitope (PADRE) and mixtures<br>
thereof<br>

separate or sequential use in immunotherapy.<br>
Said distinct antigen may be as previously described.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition of the invention may comprise virosome-like<br>
vesicles of the invention in an effective amount.<br>
An effective amount is that amount of virosome-like vesicles that alone, or<br>
together with further doses may stimulate the desired response. An effective amount may<br>
depend upon a variety of factors, such as the route for administration, whether the<br>
administration is in single or multiple doses, and individual patient parameters including<br>
age, physical condition, size, weight, and the stage of the disease. These factors are well<br>
known to those of ordinary skill in the art and can be addressed with no more than routine<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1;<br>
Preparation of virosome-like vesicles comprising a gp-41 derived antigen<br>
located to the external surface<br>
Virosome-like vesicles were prepared as described in WO 2004/045582.<br>
Briefly, 32 mg egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) and 8 mg of<br>
phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were dissolved in 2 ml of PBS containing 100 mM of<br>
octaethyleneglycolmonodecylether (OEG) (PBS/OEG).<br>
Influenza A/Singapore hemagglutinine (HA) was purified as described (Skehel<br>
and Schild, Virology 44:396-408, 1971) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 4 mg<br>
hemagglutinine (HA) was centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 30 min and the pellet was<br>
dissolved in 1,33 ml of PBS containing 100 mM of OEG.<br>
A modified gp41-derived antigen (P1) with a spacer Gly-Lys-Cys at the C-<br>
terminal position (SEQ ID NO 4) was conjugated through a succinate linker at N-terminus<br>
to a regioisomer of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) as follows.<br>
Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) was dissolved in methanol and 0.1% (v/v)<br>
triethylamine was added. The solution was then mixed with. the heterobifunctional cross-<br>
linker N-y-maleimidobutyryloxy-succinimide-ester (GMBS), (Pierce Chemical Company,<br>
 <br>
Rockford, IL) (ratio PE: GMBS = 5:1) which was previously dissolved in<br>
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (20 μl). After incubation during 30 minutes at room<br>
temperature, the solvents were evaporated for 1 h under vacuum in a speedvac centrifuge.<br>
The GMBS-PE was then dissolved in 1 ml of PBS containing 100 me octaethyleneglycol<br>
(OEG) (Fluke Chemicals, Switzerland), (PBS-OEG) and the modified gp41-derived<br>
antigen P1 (SEQ ID NO 4) was added (ration PE-GMBS:peptide = 5:1). In this step, the<br>
phosphatidylethanolamine-GMBS react with a free C-terminal cystein of the modified<br>
peptide P1. After in incubation time of 30 minutes, free cystein was added, in order to<br>
inactivate free GMBS (ratio Cystein:GMBS = 10:1).<br>
Peptide P1-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugates (4 mg), phosphatidylcholine<br>
(32 mg ; Lipoid, Ludwigshafen, Germany) ans phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (6 mg) were<br>
dissolved in a total volume of 2.66 ml of PBS-OEG. The phospholipids and the<br>
hemagglutinine solutions were mixed and sonicated for 1 min.<br>
This solution was centrifuged for 1 hour at 100 000 g and the supernatant was<br>
sterilized by filtration. Virosomes were formed by detergent removal (SM BioBeads,<br>
BioRad, Glattbrugg, Switzerland).<br>
Example 2;<br>
Immunization of rabbits with a vaccine composition comprising virosome-like<br>
vesicle with gp-41 derived antigen peptide P1 located at the external surface<br>
Three groups of New-Zealand white female rabbits were prepared to receive<br>
virosome-like vesicles manufactured as set forth in example 1.<br>
The virosome-like vesicle were either without any adjuvant intra-muscularly<br>
administered (rabbits 36 and 37), or intra-nasally administered with hRANTES (rabbits 61<br>
and 63), or intra-nasally administered with Heat labile toxin (HLT) (rabbits 64 and 65).<br>
The following regimen of administration was applied.<br>
Four weeks before the first administration of preparations, rabbits received<br>
intra-muscular injections of inactivated influenza A (100 μl of inactivated influenza A,<br>
0,01 mg/ml).<br>
Thereafter, rabbits received administration of virosome-like vesicles (20 μg,<br>
100 μl) at week 0, 4 and 12, and received an intra-muscular boost (10 μg) at week 16 and<br>
22.<br>
 <br>
Animals were sacrificed at week 28 and various samples were harvested for<br>
studying antibodies response-functions.<br>
Pre-immune samples (taken before week 0) were used as controls.<br>
Blood and vaginal secretions samples were taken at week 14, 18, 23 and 28.<br>
HLT virosome-like vesicles vaccinated rabbits were used as control with<br>
respect to hRANTES virosome-like vesicles vaccinated rabbits.<br>
Level of total antibodies, IgG and IgA were measured according to the<br>
following ELISA protocol.<br>
Peptide P1 (100 ng/100 μl/wells, SEQ ID NO 3) in a bicarbonate buffer 50<br>
mM, pH 9.6 was used to coat Nunc plates over night at 4°C.<br>
Plates were saturated with BSA 3% or milk 5% for 2 hours/37°C, then washed<br>
with PBS-Tween 0,5% buffer.<br>
Samples of sera diluted 1/1000 with BSA 3% or cervico-vaginal secretion<br>
diluted 1/50 with BSA 3% were incubated for 2 hours at 37°C.<br>
Plates were thereafter rinsed with PBS-Tween 0.5% buffer, and incubated with<br>
primary antibodies.<br>
For detection of total antibodies, an anti-rabbit total Ig goat antibody labelled<br>
with horseradish peroxydase (HRP) (1/4000) was used.<br>
For detection of rabbit IgA, an anti-rabbit IgG goat antibody (Vector, France)<br>
(1/20 000) was used followed with an incubation with streptavidine-HRP (Immunotech)<br>
diluted 1/50 000.<br>
For the detection of IgG rabbit antibody, an anti-rabbit IgA goat antibody<br>
(Sigma) (1/20 000) was used followed with an incubation with an anti-goat antibody<br>
biotin-labelled (Vector) (1/1000), and revealed with streptavidine-HRP (1/50 000).<br>
A 2F5-IgG monoclonal antibody was used as positive control, followed with<br>
an incubation with an anti-human IgA biotin-labelled goat Fab'2, (1/5000) (Caltag) and<br>
revealed with streptavidine-HRP (1/50 000).<br>
A 2F5-IgA monoclonal antibody was used as positive control, followed with<br>
an anti-human IgG goat Fab'2 (1/20 000) and revealed with streptavidine-HRP (1/50 000).<br>
The antibodies were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C.<br>
Colorimetric reaction was triggered by addition of the substrate TMB, and<br>
stopped by addition of H2PO4 1M.<br>
The optical density (OD) was read at 450 nm.<br>
 <br>
The obtained results are illustrated on Figure 3 (cervico-vaginal secretion) and<br>
Figure 4 (sera).<br>
Presence of antibodies was observed in cervico-vaginal secretion and sera<br>
from immunized rabbits with a peak at week 14 or 18 according to the immunization<br>
conditions.<br>
Example 3:<br>
Inhibition of HIV transcytosis with cervico-vaginal secretion obtained from<br>
immunized rabbits from example 2<br>
HIV-1 transcytosis across epithelial cells and neutralisation of transcytosis by<br>
antibodies were performed on epithelial cell line HT-29 grown as a tight, polarized<br>
monolayer for 7 days on a permeable filter support (0.45 micron pore size) forming the<br>
interface between two independent chambers, the upper one bathing the apical (luminal)<br>
surface of the epithelial monolayer and the lower one bathing the basolateral (serosal)<br>
surface.<br>
Primary, PBMC were obtained and prepared as described in Lagaye et al., (J.<br>
Virol, 2001, 75:4780). Then PBMCs were activated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) for<br>
48h and inoculated with primary HIV-1 clade C and used at day 7 post infection.<br>
Cervico-vaginal secretions (dilution 1/50) obtained as described in example 2<br>
(weeks 14, 18 and 23, virosome-like vesicles-P1 without adjuvant 36 &amp; 37 i.m., with<br>
hRANTES 61 &amp; 63 i.n. or with heat labile toxin 64 &amp;65 i.n.) containing antibodies were<br>
incubated at 18°C for 1 hour with 1.106 HIV-1+ PBMC.<br>
To initiate virus transcytosis, 2.106 HIV-1+ PBMC with antibodies were<br>
added to the apical chamber. Contact between HIV-1+ PBMC and the epithelial cell<br>
monolayer resulted in rapid budding of the HIV-1 virions, followed by their transcytosis<br>
from the apical to the basolateral pole of the epithelial cells.<br>
After 2 hours, inhibition of transcytosis by antibody was determined by<br>
detection of the protein p24 of HIV in the basolateral medium by ELIS A (Coulter, France<br>
or PASTEUR SANOFI, FRANCE). The level of p24 in the absence of vaginal secretion or<br>
in presence of a P1 non specific Fab or in the presence of the control IgA 2F5 was<br>
measured as negative and positive control respectively. The value of the negative control<br>
was taken as 100% of transcytosis and used to express the results.<br>
The experiments were performed at least twice.<br>
 <br>
The obtained results shown on Figure 5.<br>
The results indicated that the cervico-vaginal secretions from rabbits<br>
immunized with virosomes-like vesicles-Pl without adjuvant (36 and 37), or with human<br>
RANTES (61 and 63), or with the heat labile toxin (HLT) (64 and 65) obtained as<br>
described in example 2 were able to restrain the transcytosis HIV-1 of clades C across HT-<br>
29 cells.<br>
Without adjuvant and with HLT, an inhibition from 70 to 90% was observed<br>
with cervico-vaginal secretion from week 18.<br>
With hRANTES an inhibition from 85 to more than 90% was observed with<br>
cervico-vaginal secretion from week 23.<br>
Example 4:<br>
Immunization of macaques with a vaccine composition comprising virosome-<br>
like vesicle with gp-41 derived antigen peptide P1 located at the external surface.<br>
Three groups of 5 to 6 female macaques aged of about 5 years were prepared<br>
to receive virosome-like vesicles manufactured as set forth in example 1.<br>
The virosome-like vesicle were either intra-muscularly administered<br>
(macaques Gl.l to G1.5), or intra-nasally administered (macaques G2.1 to 02.5), or<br>
intramuscularly and intra-nasally administered (macaques G3.1 to G3.6).<br>
The following regimen of administration was applied.<br>
Four weeks before the first administration of preparations, macaques received<br>
intra-muscular injections of inactivated influenza A (100 μl of inactivated influenza A,<br>
0,01 mg/ml).<br>
Thereafter, macaques received administration of virosome-like vesicles (40<br>
μg, 100 μl) at week 0, 4, 12 and 24.<br>
Rectal lavages and vaginal secretions samples were taken at week 25 and 26.<br>
Level of total antibodies, IgG and IgA were measured according to the<br>
following ELISA protocol.<br>
Peptide P1 (100 ng/100 μl/wells, SEQ ID NO 3) in a bicarbonate buffer 50<br>
mM, pH 9.6 was used to coat Nunc plates over night at 4°C.<br>
Plates were saturated with BSA 2%/PBST 0.1% for 1 hour 30/37°C, then<br>
washed with PBS-Tween 0,1% buffer.<br>
 <br>
Samples of rectal washes undiluted or vaginal secretions diluted 1/2 with<br>
PBST 0.1% were incubated overnight at 4°C.<br>
Plates were thereafter rinsed with PBS-Tween 0.1% buffer, and incubated with<br>
primary antibodies diluted in BSA 2%/PBST 0.1%.<br>
For detection of macaques IgG, an anti-macaque IgG goat antibody<br>
(Rockland) (1/15 000) was used followed with an incubation with streptavidine-HRP<br>
(Immunotech) diluted 1/50 000.<br>
For the detection of IgA macaques antibody, an anti-macaque IgA goat<br>
antibody (Rockland) 1/15 000) was used followed with an incubation with streptavidine-<br>
HRP (Immunotech) diluted 1/50 000.<br>
A 2F5-IgA monoclonal antibody was used as positive control, followed with<br>
an incubation with an anti-human IgA biotin-labelled goat Fab'2, (0.14 μg/ml final)<br>
(Caltag H 14015) and revealed with streptavidine-HRP (1/50 000).<br>
A 2F5-IgG monoclonal antibody was used as positive control, followed with<br>
an anti-human IgG goat Fab'2 (0.1 μg/ml final) (Rockland 609106123) and revealed with<br>
streptavidine-HRP (1/50 000).<br>
The antibodies were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C.<br>
Colorimetric reaction was triggered by addition of the substrate TMB, and<br>
stopped by addition of H2PO4 1M.<br>
The optical density (OD) was read at 450 nm.<br>
The obtained results are illustrated on Figure 6 and 7 (IgG and IgA vaginal<br>
secretions) and Figure 8 (rectal washes).<br>
Resuhs show that 90 to 95% of female macaques have good levels of levels of<br>
specific IgG and IgA antibodies anti-gp41 into their genital secretion, and that more than<br>
95% have specific IgA antibodies anti-gp41 into their rectal washes.<br>
In conclusion, presence of IgG as well as IgA antibodies was observed in<br>
vaginal secretions and rectal lavages from immunized females macaques.<br>
The results revealed that an immune response with mucosal antibodies may be<br>
obtained with a vaccine of the invention.<br>
Additionally, it is observed that the IgA and IgG antibodies may be<br>
redistributed into the genital and intestinal compartiments even after vaccination by<br>
intramuscular injection in the absence of mucosal adjuvant.<br>
 <br>
Example 5;<br>
Inhibition of HIV transcytosis with vaginal secretions and rectal lavages<br>
obtained from immunized macaques from example 4<br>
R5 HIV-1 strains (V29 of primary HIV clade B from NIH and V25 of primary<br>
HIV clade C from NIH) transcytosis across epithelial cells and neutralisation of<br>
transcytosis by antibodies were performed on epithelial cell line HT-29 grown as a tight,<br>
polarized monolayer for 7 days on a permeable filter support (0.45 μm pore size) forming<br>
the interface between two independent chambers, the upper one bathing the apical<br>
(luminal) surface of the epithelial monolayer and the lower one bathing the basolateral<br>
(serosal) surface.<br>
Primary, PBMC were obtained and prepared as described in Lagaye et al., (J.<br>
Virol, 2001, 75:4780). Then PBMCs were activated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) for<br>
48h and inoculated with primary HIV-1 clade B (V29) or primary HIV-1 clade C (V25)<br>
and used at day 7 post infection.<br>
Vaginal secretions (dilution 1/25) or rectal lavages (dilution 1/25) obtained as<br>
described in example 4, from week 25 containing antibodies were incubated at 18°C for<br>
1 hour with 1.106 HIV-1+ PBMC.<br>
To initiate virus transcytosis, 2.106 HIV-1+ PBMC (V29 or V25) with<br>
antibodies were added to the apical chamber. Contact between HIV-1+ PBMC and the<br>
epithelial cell monolayer resulted in rapid budding of the HIV-1 virions, followed by their<br>
transcytosis from the apical to the basolateral pole of the epithelial cells.<br>
After 2 hours, inhibition of transcytosis by antibody was determined by<br>
detection of the protein p24 of HIV in the basolateral medium by ELIS A (Coulter, France<br>
or PASTEUR SANOFI, FRANCE). The level of p24 in the absence of vaginal secretion or<br>
in presence of a P1 non specific Fab or in the presence of the control IgA 2F5 was<br>
measured as negative and positive control respectively. The value of the negative control<br>
was taken as 100% of transcytosis and used to express the results.<br>
The experiments were performed at least twice.<br>
The obtained results shown on Figure 9 (vaginal secretions) and on Figure 10<br>
(rectal lavages).<br>
The results indicated that the antibodies were capable of preventing at least<br>
60% of HIV entry across an in vitro human mucosal epithelium model, and up to 98% in<br>
two out of sixteen animals.<br>
 <br>
Therefore, a vaccine of the invention is able to trigger an IgG as well as a<br>
mucosal IgA immime response. The mucosal immune response is able to significantly<br>
reduce HIV mucosal transcytosis, from different HIV clades.<br>
