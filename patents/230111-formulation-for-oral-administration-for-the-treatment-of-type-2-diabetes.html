				<td>METHOD FOR ADMINISTERING GLP-1 MOLECULES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a formulation useful for the oral administration<br>
comprising a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) compound and a specified delivery agent.<br>
Oral administration of the formulations can be used to treat type 2 diabetes as well as a<br>
variety of other conditions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Over the past several decades, continuous strides have been made to improve the<br>
treatment of diabetes mellitus. Approximately 90% of people with diabetes have type 2<br>
diabetes, also known as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NDDDM). Type 2<br>
diabetics generally still make insulin, but the insulin cannot be used effectively by the<br>
body's cells. This is primarily because the amount of insulin produced in response to<br>
rising blood sugar levels is not sufficient to allow cells to efficiently take up glucose and<br>
thus, reduce blood sugar levels.<br>
A large body of pre-clinical and clinical research data suggests that glucagon-like<br>
peptide-1 (GLP-1) compounds show great promise as a treatment for type 2 diabetes and<br>
other conditions. GLP-1 induces numerous biological effects such as stimulating insulin<br>
secretion, inhibiting glucagon secretion, inhibiting gastric emptying, enhancing glucose<br>
utilization, and inducing weight loss. Further, pre-clinical studies suggest that GLP-1<br>
may also act to prevent the 6 cell deterioration that occurs as the disease progresses.<br>
Perhaps the most salient characteristic of GLP-1 is its ability to stimulate insulin secretion<br>
without the associated risk of hypoglycemia that is seen when using insulin therapy or<br>
some types of oral therapies that act by increasing insulin expression.<br>
However, development of a GLP-1 therapeutic has been extremely difficult. This<br>
is primarily due to the instability of the peptide during manufacturing processes, in<br>
solution formulations, and in vivo. The only published clinical studies employing GLP-1<br>
compounds to treat hyperglycemia or other conditions involve formulating GLP-1<br>
compounds such that they can be delivered by subcutaneous injection or through<br>
continuous subcutaneous infusion or continuous intravenous administration. Many type 2<br><br>
diabetics or obese patients desiring to lose weight will not be willing to undertake a<br>
treatment regimen that may involve several injections per day. Thus, there is a need to<br>
develop GLP-1 compound therapeutics that can be delivered by an alternative non-<br>
invasive means such as by oral delivery.<br>
Unfortunately, there are numerous barriers to effective oral delivery of peptides.<br>
The high acid content and ubiquitous digestive enzymes of the digestive tract will often<br>
degrade proteins and peptides before they reach the site of absorption. Further, many<br>
peptides cannot effectively traverse the cells of the epithelial membrane in the small<br>
intestine to reach the bloodstream. Finally, many drugs become insoluble at the low pH<br>
levels encountered in the digestive tract and, thus, are not absorbed effectively.<br>
The fact that GLP-1 compounds are relatively unstable in solution formulations,<br>
only remain in solution under a fairly narrow set of conditions, and have a relatively short<br>
in vivo half-life when administered as a solution formulation, suggested that these<br>
compounds could not be effectively delivered through the oral route. Thus, it was<br>
surprising that GLP-1 compounds could be formulated such that biologically active<br>
molecules were absorbed into the blood stream after oral administration.<br>
The present invention involves the use of specific delivery agent molecules that<br>
interact with GLP-1 compounds in a non-covalent fashion to allow the compounds to<br>
cross gut membranes and yet remain therapeutically active. Although the delivery agents<br>
employed in the present invention have been disclosed in a series of U.S. Patents (see<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,541,155; 5,693,338; 5,976,569; 5,643,957; 5,955,503; 6,100,298;<br>
5,650,386; 5,866,536; 5,965,121; 5,989,539; 6,001,347; 6,071,510; 5,820,881; and<br>
6,242,495; see also WO 02/02509; WO 01/51454; WO 01/44199; WO 01/32130;<br>
WO 00/59863; WO 00/50386; WO 00/47188; and WO 00/40203), oral administration of<br>
formulations comprising GLP-1 compounds with these delivery agents has not been<br>
disclosed or suggested. Further, numerous parameters impact whether a particular class<br>
of compounds can be effectively delivered in combination with one or more classes of<br>
delivery agents. For example, the conformation of the peptide, the surface charges on the<br>
molecule under certain formulation conditions, the solubility profile, the stability as a<br>
formulated component, as well as susceptibility to protease digestion and in vivo stability<br>
all influence the ability to deliver a compound orally.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention encompasses the development of novel formulations<br>
comprising GLP-1 compounds and delivery agents that can be administered orally. The<br>
present invention provides a formulation which can be administered orally comprising a<br>
GLP-1 compound and a specified delivery agent. The GLP-1 compound can be native<br>
GLP-1; GLP-1 fragments; GLP-1 analogs; GLP-1 derivatives of native, fragments, or<br>
analogs of GLP-1; and Exendin-3 and Exendin-4. The delivery agent is selected from<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The three-letter abbreviation code for amino acids used in this specification<br>
conforms with the list contained in Table 3 of Annex C, Appendix 2 of the PCT<br>
Administrative Instructions and with 37 C.F.R. § 1.822(d)(l)(2000).<br>
For purposes of the present invention as disclosed and described herein, the<br>
following terms and abbreviations are defined as follows.<br>
The term "formulation" as used herein refers to a GLP-1 compound and a<br>
specified delivery agent combined together which can be administered orally such that<br>
GLP-1 compound passes through the gut into the systemic circulation and has the ability<br>
to bind to the GLP-1 receptor and initiate a signal transduction pathway resulting in<br>
insulinotropic activity. The formulation can optionally comprise other agents so long as<br>
the GLP-1 retains the ability to bind the GLP-1 receptor.<br>
The term "oral" as used herein refers to delivery of a compound by mouth such<br>
that the compound passes through the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine into the<br>
systemic circulation.<br>
The term "GLP-1 compound" as used herein refers to polypeptides that include<br>
naturally occurring GLP-1 polypeptides (GLP-1 (7-3 7)OH and GLP-1 (7-3 6)NH2), GLP-1<br>
fragments, GLP-1 analogs, GLP-1 derivatives of naturally occurring GLP-1 polypeptides,<br>
GLP-1 fragments, or GLP-1 analogs, and Exendin-3 and Exendin-4 that have the ability<br>
to bind to the GLP-1 receptor and initiate a signal transduction pathway resulting in<br>
insulinotropic activity.<br>
The term "insulinotropic activity" refers to the ability to stimulate insulin secretion<br>
in response to elevated glucose levels, thereby causing glucose uptake by cells and<br>
decreased plasma glucose levels. For example, insulinotropic activity can be determined<br>
using the method described in Example 1. A GLP-1 molecule has insulinotropic activity<br>
if islet cells secrete insulin levels in the presence of the GLP-1 molecule above<br>
background levels.<br>
The term "DPP IV resistant" refers to GLP-1 molecules that have extended<br>
metabolic stability and improved biological activity. For example, DPP IV resistance can<br>
be determined using the method described in Example 2. A GLP-1 molecule is DPP IV<br>
resistant if in the presence of DPP IV the GLP-1 molecule has extended metabolic<br><br>
stability above that of native GLP-1. DPP IV resistant GLP-1 molecules can have an<br>
amino acid change at the DPP IV recognition site (position 8), or DPP IV resistant<br>
peptides can have an attached group that restricts the accessibility of the DPP IV to the<br>
recognition site, or both.<br>
A "GLP-1 fragment" is a polypeptide obtained after truncation of one or more<br>
amino acids from the TV-terminus and/or C-terminus of GLP-1 (7-3 7)OH or an analog or<br>
derivative thereof. The nomenclature used to describe GLP-1 (7-37)OH is also applicable<br>
to GLP-1 fragments. For example, GLP-l(9-36)OH denotes a GLP-1 fragment obtained<br>
by truncating two amino acids from the TV-terminus and one amino acid from the C-<br>
terminus. The amino acids in the fragment are denoted by the same number as the<br>
corresponding.amino acid in GLP-1 (7-37)OH. For example, the N-terminal glutamic acid<br>
in GLP-1 (9-36)OH is at position 9; position 12 is occupied by phenylalanine; and position<br>
22 is occupied by glycine, as in GLP-1 (7-3 7)OH. For GLP-1 (7-36)OH, the glycine at<br>
position 37 of GLP-1 (7-37)OH is deleted.<br>
A "GLP-1 analog" has sufficient homology to GLP-1 (7-37)OH or a fragment of<br>
GLP-1 (7-3 7)OH such that the analog has insulinotropic activity. Preferably, a GLP-1<br>
analog has the amino acid sequence of GLP-1 (7-37)OH or a fragment thereof, modified<br>
so that from one, two, three, four or five amino acids differ from the amino acid in<br>
corresponding position of GLP-1 (7-37)OH or a fragment of GLP-l(7-37)OH. In the<br>
nomenclature used herein to designate GLP-1 compounds, the substituting amino acid and<br>
its position is indicated prior to the parent structure. For example, Glu22-GLP-l(7-37)OH<br>
designates a GLP-1 compound in which the glycine normally found at position 22 of<br>
GLP-1 (7-37)OH has been replaced with glutamic acid; Val8-Glu22-GLP-l(7-37)OH<br>
designates a GLP-1 compound in which alanine normally found at position 8 and glycine<br>
normally found at position 22 of GLP-1 (7-37)OH have been replaced with valine and<br>
glutamic acid, respectively.<br>
GLP-1 molecules also include polypeptides in which one or more amino acids<br>
have been added to the N-terminus and/or C-terminus of GLP-1 (7-37)OH, or fragments or<br>
analogs thereof. It is preferred that GLP-1 molecules of this type have up to about thirty-<br>
nine amino acids. The amino acids in the "extended" GLP-1 molecule are denoted by the<br>
same number as the corresponding amino acid in GLP-1 (7-37)OH. For example, for a<br><br>
GLP-1 molecule obtained by adding two amino acids to the TV-terminus of<br>
GLP-1 (7-3 7)OH, the N-terminal amino acid is located at position 5; and for a GLP-1<br>
molecule obtained by adding one amino acid to the C-terminus of GLP-1 (7-37)OH, the C-<br>
terminal amino acid is located at position 38. Thus, position 12 is occupied by<br>
phenylalanine and position 22 is occupied by glycine in both of these "extended" GLP-1<br>
compounds, as in GLP-1 (7-37)OH. Amino acids 1-6 of an extended GLP-1 molecule are<br>
preferably the same as or a conservative substitution of the amino acid at the<br>
corresponding position of GLP-l(l-37)OH. Amino acids 38-45 of an extended GLP-1<br>
molecule are preferably the same as or a conservative substitution of the amino acid at the<br>
corresponding position of glucagon or Exendin-4.<br>
A "GLP-1 derivative" refers to a molecule having the amino acid sequence of<br>
GLP-1, a GLP-1 fragment, or a GLP-1 analog, but additionally having chemical<br>
modification of one or more of its amino acid side groups, a-carbon atoms, terminal<br>
amino group, or terminal carboxylic acid group. A chemical modification includes, but is<br>
not limited to, adding chemical moieties, creating new bonds, and removing chemical<br>
moieties. Modifications at amino acid side groups include, without limitation, acylation<br>
of lysine e-amino groups, N-alkylation of arginine, histidine, or lysine, alkylation of<br>
glutamic or aspartic carboxylic acid groups, and deamidation of glutamine or asparagine.<br>
Modifications of the terminal amino group include, without limitation, the des-amino,<br>
N-lower alkyl, N-di-lower alkyl, and N-acyl modifications. Modifications of the terminal<br>
carboxy group include, without limitation, the amide, lower alkyl amide, dialkyl amide,<br>
and lower alkyl ester modifications. Lower alkyl is C1-C4 alkyl. Furthermore, one or<br>
more side groups, or terminal groups, may be protected by protective groups known to the<br>
ordinarily-skilled protein chemist. The a-carbon of an amino acid may be mono- or<br>
dimethylated.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, an in vitro GLP-1 receptor-signaling<br>
assay is used to determine whether a particular extended GLP-1 peptide will exhibit<br>
insulinotropic activity in vivo. Extended GLP-1 peptides encompassed by the present<br>
invention have an in vitro potency that is not less than one-tenth the in vitro potency of<br>
the DPP IV resistant GLP-1 analog known as Valδ-GLP-l(7-37)OH. More preferably, the<br><br>
extended GLP-1 peptides of the present invention are as potent or more potent than<br>
Valδ-GLP-l(7-37)OH.<br>
"In vitro potency" as used herein is the measure of the ability of a peptide to<br>
activate the GLP-1 receptor in a cell-based assay. In vitro potency is expressed as the<br>
"EC50" which is the effective concentration of compound that results in 50% activity in a<br>
single dose-response experiment. For the purposes of the present invention, in vitro<br>
potency is determined using a fluorescence assay that employs HEK-293 Aurora CRE-<br>
BLAM cells that stably express the human GLP-1 receptor. These HEK-293 cells have<br>
stably integrated a DNA vector having a cAMP response element (CRE) driving<br>
expression of the β-lactamase (BLAM) gene. The interaction of a GLP-1 agonist with the<br>
receptor initiates a signal that results in activation of the cAMP response element and<br>
subsequent expression of β-lactamase. The β-lactamase CCF2/AM substrate that emits<br>
fluorescence when it is cleaved by β-lactamase (Aurora Biosciences Corp.) can then be<br>
added to cells that have been exposed to a specific amount of GLP-1 agonist to provide a<br>
measure of GLP-1 agonist potency. The assay is further described in Zlokarnik, et al.<br>
(1998) Science 279:84-88 (See also Example 1). The EC50 values for the compounds<br>
listed in example 1 were determined using the BLAM assay described above by<br>
generating a dose response curve using dilutions ranging from 0.00003 nanomolar to 30<br>
nanomolar. Relative in vitro potency values are established by running<br>
Valδ-GLP-l(7-37)OH as a control and assigning the control a reference value of 1.<br>
The term "delivery agent" refers to molecules in U.S. Patents 5,541,155;<br>
5,693,338; 5,976,569; 5,643,957; 5,955,503; 6,100,298; 5,650,386; 5,866,536;<br>
5,965,121; 5,989,539; 6,001,347; 6,071,510; 5,820,881; and 6,242,495; and<br>
WO 02/02509; WO 01/51454; WO 01/44199; WO 01/32130; WO 00/59863;<br>
WO 00/50386; WO 00/47188; and WO 00/40203. The delivery agents are generally<br>
derived from amino acids and are useful in the oral formulations of the present invention.<br>
The derived amino acids can also be in the form of poly amino acids, and peptides. An<br>
amino acid is any carboxylic acid having at least one free amine group and includes<br>
naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids. Poly amino acids are either peptides or<br>
two or more amino acids linked by a bond formed by other groups which can be linked,<br>
e.g., an ester, anhydride, or an anhydride linkage. Peptides are two or more amino acids<br><br>
joined by a peptide bond. Peptides can vary in length from dipeptides with two amino<br>
acids to polypeptides with several hundred amino acids. Preferred peptides include di-<br>
peptides, tri-peptides, tetra-peptides, and penta-peptides.<br>
Furthermore, the delivery agents of the present invention are optionally in a salt<br>
form. Examples of salts include sodium, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric<br>
acid, citric acid, acetic acid, sulfate, phosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, acetate,<br>
propionate, hydrobromic acid, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium<br>
hydroxide, and potassium carbonate.<br>
The various oral formulations of the present invention may optionally encompass<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable buffers<br>
include phosphate buffers such as dibasic sodium phosphate, TRIS, glycylglycine,<br>
maleate, sodium acetate, sodium citrate, sodium tartrate, or an amino acid such as glycine,<br>
histidine, lysine or arginine. Other pharmaceutically acceptable buffers are known in the<br>
art. Preferably, the buffer is selected from the group consisting of phosphate, TRIS,<br>
maleate, and glycine. Even more preferably the buffer is TRIS.<br>
Preferably, the TRIS concentration is between about 1 raM and 100 mM. Even<br>
more preferably, the concentration is between about 10 mM and about 50 mM, most<br>
preferably the buffer is about 20 mM.<br>
The pH of the oral formulations is adjusted to provide stability and to be<br>
acceptable for oral administration. Preferably, the pH is adjusted to between about 7.0<br>
and about 9.0, more preferably the pH is between about 7.4 and 8.4. Even more<br>
preferably the pH is between about 7.8 and 8.4. Most preferably, the pH is between about<br>
7.8 and 8.1.<br>
The various oral formulations of the present invention may optionally encompass<br>
a suspending agent. Some delivery agents require a suspending agent due to their<br>
solubility characteristics. An example of a suspending agent is hydroxypropyl-<br>
methylcellulose. Preferably, the final concentration of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose is<br>
between about 2% and about 10% (weight/volume). Even more preferably, the<br>
concentration is between about 2% and about 5% (w/v). Most preferably the<br>
concentration is about 3.9% (w/v).<br><br>
The oral formulations of the present invention may optionally comprise a<br>
cosolvent. Some delivery agents require cosolvents due to their solubility characteristics.<br>
Examples of cosolvents include ethanol, N-methylpyrrolidone, N,N-dimethylacetamide,<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide, glycofurol, ethoxydiol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol<br>
300 and polyvinylpyrrolidone. Preferably, the final concentration of the cosolvents is<br>
between about 5% and about 30% (volume/volume). Even more preferably, the<br>
concentration is between about 10% and about 25% (v/v). Most preferably the<br>
concentration is about 20% (v/v).<br>
The oral formulations of the present invention may optionally comprise a<br>
preservative. Preservative refers to a compound that is added to the formulation to act as<br>
an antimicrobial agent. Among preservatives known in the art as being effective and<br>
acceptable in parenteral formulations are phenolic preservatives, alkylparabens, benzyl<br>
alcohol, chlorobutanol, resorcinol, and other similar preservatives, and various mixtures<br>
thereof. Examples of phenolic derivatives include cresols and phenol or a mixture of<br>
cresols and phenol. Examples of cresols include meta-cresol, ortho-cresol, para-cresol,<br>
chlorocresol, or mixtures thereof. Alkylparaben refers to a C1 to C4 alkylparaben, or<br>
mixtures thereof. Examples of alkylparabens include methylparaben, ethylparaben,<br>
propylparaben, or butylparaben. The concentrations must be sufficient to maintain<br>
preservative effectiveness by retarding microbial growth. Preferably, the preservative is a<br>

and impart a suitable tonicity to the formulation to prevent the net flow of water across<br>
cell membranes. Examples of such compounds include glycerin, salts, e.g., NaCl, and<br>
sugars, e.g., dextrose, mannitol, and sucrose. These compounds are commonly used for<br><br>
such purposes at known concentrations. One or more isotonicity agents may be added to<br>
adjust the ionic strength or tonicity. The preferred isotonicity agent is NaCl. The<br>
concentration of the NaCl is preferably between about 10 mM and 200 mM, more<br>
preferred is between about 50 mM and 150 mM, and most preferred is about 100 mM.<br>
The administration compositions may alternatively be in the form of a solid, such<br>
as a tablet, capsule or particle, such as a powder. Solid dosage forms may be prepared by<br>
mixing the solid form of the compound with the solid form of the active agent.<br>
Alternatively, a solid may be obtained from a solution of compound and active agent by<br>
methods known in the art, such as freeze drying, precipitation, crystallization ad solid<br>
dispersion.<br>

The GLP-1 compounds of the present invention also encompass Exendin<br>
compounds. Exendin-3 and Exendin-4 are biologically active peptides first isolated from<br>
Helodermatidae lizard venoms and have been shown to bind the GLP-1 receptor and<br>
stimulate cAMP-depcndent H production in mammalian parietal cells. Exendin-3 and<br>
Exendin-4 are both 39 amino acid peptides which are approximately 53% homologous to<br>
GLP-1. They act as potent agonists of GLP-1 activity. Notably, an N-terminally<br>
truncated derivative of Exendin, known as Exendin(9-39 amino acids), is an inhibitor of<br>
Exendin-3, Exendin-4 and GLP-1.<br>
An Exendin compound typically comprises a polypeptide having the amino acid<br>
sequence of Exendin-3, Exendin-4, or an analog or fragment thereof. Exendin-3 and<br>
Exendin-4 are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,424,286.<br><br><br>
GLP-1 compounds also include Exendin fragments which are polypeptides<br>
obtained after truncation of one or more amino acids from the N-terminus and/or C-<br>
terminus of Exendin or an Exendin analog. Furthermore, GLP-1 compounds include<br>
Exendin polypeptides in which one or more amino acids have been added to the TV-<br>
terminus and/or C-terminus of Exendin or fragments thereof. Exendin compounds of this<br>
type have up to about forty-five amino acids.<br>
GLP-1 compounds also include "Exendin analogs." An Exendin analog has<br>
sufficient homology to Exendin-4, Exendin-3, or a fragment thereof such that the analog<br>
has insulinotropic activity. The activity of Exendin fragments and/or analogs can be<br>
assessed using in vitro assays such as those described in Example 1.<br>
Preferably, an Exendin analog has the amino acid sequence of Exendin-4 or a<br>
fragment thereof, modified so that from one, two, three, four or five amino acids differ<br>
from the amino acid in corresponding position of Exendin-4 or the fragment of<br>
Exendin-4. In the nomenclature used herein to designate Exendin compounds, the<br>
substituting amino acid and its position is indicated prior to the parent structure. For<br>
example, Val8-Exendin-4 designates an Exendin compound in which the glycine normally<br>
found at position 8 of Exendin-4 has been replaced with valine.<br>
Another preferred group of GLP-1 compounds is composed of GLP-l/Exendin-4<br>
analogs of formula DC (SEQ ID NO: 12).<br><br><br><br><br>

The delivery agents of the present invention can be made by organic chemistry<br>
methods known in the art and as described in WO 90/36480; WO 96/30036; U.S. Pat.<br><br>
No. 5,643,957; U.S. Pat. No. 6,242,495; all of which are herein incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
Many of the delivery agents of the present invention can be readily prepared from<br>
amino acids including, but not limited to, aminocaprylic acid, butyrylhydroxaminic acid,<br>
aminophenylbutyric acid, aminophenylhexanoic acid, aminophenylpropionic acid,<br>
aminosalicylic acid, aminophenylsuccinic acid, aminononanic acid, aminonicotinic acid,<br>
aminovalenic acid, aminophenylacetic acid, aminocaproic acid, aminoundecanoic acid,<br>

For example, these delivery agents may be prepared by reacting the single acid<br>
with the appropriate agent which reacts with free amino moiety present in the amino acids<br>
to form amides. Protecting groups may be used to avoid unwanted side reactions as<br>
would be known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The delivery agents may be purified by rccrystallization or by fractionation on<br>
solid column supports. Suitable rccrystallization solvent systems include acetonitrile,<br>
methanol and tetrahydrofuran. Fractionation may be performed on a suitable solid<br>
column supports such as alumina, using mcthanol/n-propanol mixtures as the mobile<br>
phase; reverse phase column supports using trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile mixtures as<br>
the mobile phase; and ion exchange chromatography using water as the mobile phase.<br>
When anion exchange chromatography is performed, preferably a subsequent 0-500 mM<br>
sodium chloride gradient is employed.<br>

The oral formulations comprising a GLP-1 compound and a delivery agent can be<br>
used to treat a wide variety of diseases and conditions. The GLP-1 compounds primarily<br>
exert their biological effects by acting at a GLP-1 receptor. Subjects with diseases and/or<br>
conditions that respond favorably to GLP-1 receptor stimulation or to the administration<br>
of GLP-1 compounds can therefore be treated with the oral formulations of the present<br>
invention. These subjects are said to "be in need of treatment with GLP-1 compounds" or<br>
"in need of GLP-1 receptor stimulation". Included are subjects with non-insulin<br>
dependent diabetes, insulin dependent diabetes, stroke (see WO 00/16797), myocardial<br>
infarction (see WO 98/08531), obesity (see WO 98/19698), catabolic changes after<br>
surgery (see U.S. Patent No. 6,006,753), functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel<br>
syndrome (see WO 99/64060). Also included are subjects requiring prophylactic<br>
treatment with a GLP-1 compound, e.g., subjects at risk for developing non-insulin<br>
dependent diabetes (see WO 00/07617). Subjects with impaired glucose tolerance or<br>
impaired fasting glucose, subjects whose body weight is about 25% above normal body<br>
weight for the subject's height and body build, subjects with a partial pancreatectomy,<br>
subjects having one or more parents with non-insulin dependent diabetes, subjects who<br>
have had gestational diabetes and subjects who have had acute or chronic pancreatitis are<br>
at risk for developing non-insulin dependent diabetes.<br><br>
The present invention may be better understood with reference to the following<br>
examples. These examples are intended to be representative of specific embodiments of<br>
the invention, and are not intended as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
Insulinotropic activity determination<br>
A collagenase digest of pancreatic tissue is separated on a Ficoll gradient (27%,<br>
23%, 20.5%, and 11% in Hank's balanced salt solution, pH 7.4). The islets arc collected<br>
from the 20.5%/l 1% interface, washed and handpicked free of exocrine and other tissue<br>
under a stereomicroscope. The islets are incubated overnight in RPMI 1640 medium<br>
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine plasma and containing 11 mM glucose at 37°C and<br>
95% air/5% CO:. The GLP-1 compound to be studied is prepared at a range of<br>
concentrations, preferably 3 nanomolar to 30 nanomolar in RPMI medium containing<br>
10% fetal bovine plasma and 16.7 mM glucose. About 8 to 10 isolated islets are then<br>
transferred by pipette to a total volume of 250 μl. of the GLP-1 compound containing<br>
medium in 96-well microtitcr dishes. The islets arc incubated in the presence of the<br>
GLP-1 compound at 37°C, 95% air, 5% CO2 for 90 minutes. Then aliquots of islet-free<br>
medium are collected and 100 μl thereof are assayed for the amount of insulin present by<br>
radioimmunoassay using an Equate Insulin RIA Kit (Binax, Inc., Portland, ME).<br>
Example 2<br>
GLP-1 stability in the presence of DPP IV<br>
The stability of each GLP-1 molecule can be determined by incubation of the<br>
GLP-1 molecule in human plasma. Plasma (800 μL), obtainable from healthy human<br>
volunteers, is incubated at 37°C with 300 pmol/L of a GLP-1 molecule for up to six<br>
hours. This is followed by reversed phase HPLC and RIA according to Deacon, et al, in<br>
J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 80:952-957 (1995).<br><br>
Example 3<br>
Formulation of delivery agent number 15<br>
Approximately 600 mg of delivery agent number 15 was weighed into Type I glass<br>
vials to which 3 mL of base (0.1 N NaOH, pH 12.7) was added to achieve a final<br>
concentration of 200 mg/mL. The pH was adjusted to 7.1 and the concentration was<br>
estimated to be 171 mg/mL. Delivery agent number 15 was then diluted to 150 mg/mL<br>
with Milli-Q® water.<br>
Example 4<br>
Formulation of delivery agent number 40<br>
Delivery agents number 40 and 9 were insoluble at the desired concentration of<br>
150 mg/mL when followed example 1. Further dilution with base to pH 11.5 also did not<br>
achieve the desired concentration of 150 mg/mL. Addition of cosolvents also failed to<br>
solubilize either delivery agent to the desired concentration of 150 mg/mL. Cosolvents<br>
tested included ethanol, N-methylpyrrolidone, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-<br>
dimethylformamide, glycofurol, ethoxydiol, propylene glycol, polyethyleneglycol 300,<br>
and polyvinylpyrrolidone.<br>
However, for delivery agent number 40, 150 mg was weighed into a Type I vial, to<br>
which 1 mL of Milli-Q® water was added, and the pH adjusted with 10 N NaOH. Using<br>
this approach, a 150 mg/mL solution was achieved for delivery agent number 40<br>
(pH 8.22).<br>
Example 5<br>
Formulation of delivery agent number 9<br>
Due to the aqueous insolubility of delivery agent number 9, a suspension<br>
formulation was prepared in 4% weight/volume (aqueous) of suspending agent<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (Klucel®). Approximately 1.7 mL of suspending agent<br>
was added to a Type I glass vial containing 300 mg of delivery agent number 9. The<br>
preparation was cooled on ice for 3 minutes, followed by probe sonication on ice for<br>
30 minutes using a Misonix Sonicator® Ultrasonic Processor XL (3/16th inch microtip).<br>
Sonication resulted in a reduction of the mean particle size of delivery agent number 9<br><br>
from 48 μm to 8 μm (Coulter® LS Particle Size Analyzer) at pH 7.98. The formulation<br>
was then diluted to 150 mg/mL with the suspending agent.<br>
Example 6<br>
Other delivery agents:<br>
All other delivery agents were prepared as described in examples 3 and 4 above,<br>
except delivery agent numbers 10, 11, 12, 16, 18, 22, 25, 27, 33, and 52, which were<br>
prepared as described in example 5 above. Delivery agents 46 and 54 were prepared in<br>
two separate formulations: one according to either example 3 or 4 and another according<br>
to example 5.<br>
Example 7<br>
Stability studies:<br>
Stability studies were conducted for delivery agent numbers 9, 15, and 40. The<br>
delivery agents were freshly prepared as described above respectively to achieve the<br>
desired concentration of 150 mg/mL. The samples were divided into three 2 raL aliquots<br>
and stored at -20°C, 4°C, and ambient for three days. HPLC assay development and<br>
analyses were performed at the end of the storage period. The results are shown in Table<br>
2.<br><br>
Example 8<br>
Formulation of the GLP-1 compound:<br>
A solution of Val8-Glu22-GLP-1 was prepared by dissolving the GLP-1 compound<br>
in distilled water to yield a concentration of 7 mg/mL. The pH was slowly raised to 10.5<br><br>
with 2 N NaOH, followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 minutes. A volume<br>
of 1 M Tris buffer, pH 8.0 was added to give a final buffer concentration 20 mM Tris, and<br>
the pH adjusted to pH 7.8 with 1 N or 5 N HC1. The solution was then filtered through a<br>
low protein binding 0.22 uM syringe filter (Millex GV, Millipore) and the concentration<br>
of the GLP-1 compound was determined by UV spectroscopy. The solution was diluted to<br>
a final concentration of 5.5 mg/mL using 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.8. The peptide<br>
solution was then stored in 1 0 mL aliquots at -70°C until used.<br>
Example9<br>
Final formulations:<br>
Final formulations were freshly prepared approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour prior<br>
to in vivo dosing by combining 4.5 mL of the delivery agent with 0.5 mL of the GLP-1<br>
compound. The final formulations were dosed by oral gavage at 2 mL/kg (1.1 mg/kg<br>
GLP-1 compound, 300 mg/kg delivery agent) with to Male Sprague Dawley rats that were<br>
fasted for 12 hours prior to dosing. A subcutaneous dose of the GLP-1 compound alone<br>
was used as a control (0.011 mg/kg). The mean pharmacokinetic parameters are shown in<br>
the following table.<br>
