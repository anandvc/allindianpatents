SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR TESTING PACKAGED DIES<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0001] 	Microprocessing devices often need access to external memory to store data and program instructions. In some devices, the memory device is external to the package and communicates with the microprocessor through an external interface. As memory requirements continues to increase, additional memory devices are often required to meet speed and bandwidth requirements. Interfacing to the external memory devices requires more pins on the package, as well as additional space within the equipment in which the microprocessor and memory devices are being used. The additional memory device may therefore result in a relatively significant increase in cost. A more cost efficient alternative would be to stack the additional memory device inside the package with the microprocessor.<br>
[0002]       Microprocessor and memory devices are typically configured on a silicon<br>
wafer referred to as a die. Several dies may be stacked in a single package and sold as<br>
an integrated circuit   Pins are located outside the package to allow the devices in the<br>
package to be electrically coupled with other devices. While some of the pins may be<br>
allocated for external interfaces to test the dies in the package, it is typically desirable to<br>
allocate as many of the pins as possible to other types of signals, such as control, data,<br>
power, and ground signals.<br>
[0003]	 As integrated circuit technology scales down, the supply voltage must be reduced to prevent breakdown of gate insulators in electronic components. Voltage reduction has the added benefit of reducing, the dynamic power consumption in an integrated circuit. Voltage downscaling also results, however, in a linear increase in the propagation delay of the logic gates. Therefore, the threshold voltage of the transistors must be lowered to maintain the circuit speed. This reduction in threshold voltage results in a significant increase in the leakage current, which increases the static power consumption in the circuit.<br><br>
WO 2005/109021	PCT/US2005/010780<br>
3<br>
[0004]	Each of the dies in the stack is typically tested comprehensively before<br>
packaging.  The dies can potentially be damaged during assembly, however, and<br>
additional testing must be performed once the dies are packaged together. Most failures<br>
are due to mechanical stress and/or electrostatic discharge, which can cause additional<br>
leakage current at one or more of the pins. Leakage current can drain power supplies in<br>
battery powered devices more rapidly than necessary.   It is therefore desirable to test<br>
packaged devices under expected operating conditions at the package level to insure the<br>
devices are performing within allowable parameters.<br>
[0005] 	Most suppliers of integrated circuit devices stack memory dies to eliminate the external memory devices altogether. Such configurations leave the external interface pins unused. Accordingly, the unused pins can be tied to the stacked memory interface, allowing full access to the stacked device at package level for comprehensive testing.<br>
[0006] 	In some Configurations, however, an external memory system can be supplemented with a stacked memory die. As a result, there are no spare pins available on the package to access the memory signals of the stacked die. Since there are no dedicated pins, some pins on the package are shared between the stacked die signals along with signals on the main die.<br>
[0007] 	FIG. 1 shows one known configuration of an electronic component package 100 that allows testing of a main die 102 and a stacked die 104. Special test pads 106 are added to the stacked die 104 and are bonded to external pins 108 on the package 100 along with other functional pads 110 of the main die 102. The stacked die test pads 106 are disabled during normal functional mode, while the functional pads 110 on the main die 102 are disabled in test mode. One drawback of this configuration of package 100 is the addition of extra test pads 106 on the stacked die 104, which adds extra cost.<br>
[0008] FIG. 2 shows another electronic component package 200 that allows testing of main die 202 and stacked die 204 without requiring the special test pads 106. Instead, analog multiplexers 206 are coupled to combine the signals output to the functional pads.210, 212 of the main die 202 with signals from die-to-die functional pads 208 of the stacked die 204.   The multiplexed signals 210, 212 are coupled to<br><br>
WO 2005/109021<br><br>
PCT/US2005/010780<br><br>
4<br><br>
respective pins 214, 216 of the package 200. Package 200 allows the stacked die 204 to be tested, but the analog multiplexers 206 must be very large in order to support high speed operation. This not only significantly impacts the speed at which the dies 202, 204 can be tested, but also adds a huge load on the test die-to-die pads 208. The load impacts the speed of operation during normal mode. In summary, while the package 200 allows full test of the stacked die 204 for functionality as well as pin leakage, the testing speed as well as speed during normal operation would be severely restricted by the large analog multiplexers 206.<br>
[0009]	 It is therefore desirable to provide electronic component packages with stacked dies that can be comprehensively tested while alleviating the drawbacks associated with known solutions.<br>
SUMMARY<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[00016] Referring now to FIG. 3, an embodiment of an electronics component package 300 is shown that allows a main die 302 and a stacked die 304 to be tested functionally, as well as for current leakage. In some embodiments, the package 300 supports normal operating modes, high-speed testing of the main die 302 and the stacked die 304, and leakage current testing of the connections between the main die 302 and the stacked die 304. The unique configuration of components in the package 300 allows signal strength and operating speed to be retained during high-speed tests and normal operating modes, even at high frequencies.  The configuration of<br><br>
WO 2005/109021<br><br>
PCT/US2005/010780<br><br><br>
7 <br>
components in the package 300 can also alleviate the need for additional test pads, such as test pads 106 in FIG. 1, on the stacked die 304, which can lower the relative cost of manufacturing the stacked die 304.<br>
[00017]    	 In some embodiments, the main die 302 is configured with input buffers 306,  308 that are paired with corresponding output buffers 310, 312 for bi-directional the stacked die 304 via respective bonding pads 314, 316 and connections 318, 320. The output buffers 310, 312 are also configured to receive a control input that can be used to tri-state (i.e., place in a non-conducting state) the output buffers 310, 312 during leakage testing.<br>
[00018]	 The stacked die 304 includes bonding pads 322, 324 coupled to the wire connections 318, 320 and to respective pairs 'of input/output buffer pairs 326, 328. Connectivity problems between the bonding pads 314, 316 on the main die 302 and the bonding pads 322, 324 on the stacked die 304 can be discovered during-leakage tests, as further described herein.<br><br>
[00019] 	The main die 302 also includes a number of bonding pads 330,332, 334 that are coupled via wire connections 336, 338, 340 to corresponding bonding pads 342, 344, 346 on the package 300. The package bonding pads 342, 344, 346 are typically connected to pins (not shown) that are accessible external to the package 300. Input buffers 348, 350, 352 are coupled to receive signals via corresponding bonding pads 330,332,334. Output buffers 354,356 are coupled to transmit signals to corresponding bonding pads 330, 332.<br>
[00020] 	A direction signal can be applied at the bonding pad 346 to indicate whether signals are being input or output at the package bonding pads 342, 344. The direction<br><br>
signal can be a high<br><br>
impedance signal that is applied to a control input of the output<br><br>
buffers 310, 312, 354, 356 to prevent the output buffers 310, 312, 354, 356 from<br><br>
conducting when test<br><br>
signals are input at the package bonding pads 342,344.<br><br>
[00021] 	The main die 302 can also include multiplexers 358, 360, 362, 364 coupled to provide input to corresponding output buffers 310, 312, 354, 356. Multiplexers 358, 360 are each coupled to receive input signals including:   (a) input signals from other<br><br>
WO 2005/109021	PCT/US2005/010780<br><br>
8<br>
components on the main die 302, such as device controller 366, during normal operating modes; and (b) input signals from the corresponding input buffers 350, 348, which are used during high-speed testing. Device controller 366 can be any suitable control device. For example, the device controller 366 can be a memory controller when the main die 302 incorporates a memory device. The multiplexers 362, 364 are coupled to receive input signals including: (a) input signals from other components on the main die 302, such as general purpose input/output controller 368 or other suitable device, during normal operating modes; and (b) input signals from the corresponding input buffers 308, 306 during high-speed testing.  Test signal inputs can also be coupled to<br>
control operation of  the multiplexers 358, 360, 362, 364 during various test modes, as<br>
further described herein.<br>
[00022] 	Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, FIG. 4 shows further detail of an embodiment of a subgroup 374 of components that can be included in the package 300. The output buffers 310, 312, 354, 356 are typically tri-stated during leakage testing to avoid interference with the- leakage current signals, as further described herein. FIG. 4 also shows control input TEST2 that can be coupled to provide different inputs to the multiplexers 360,358,362,364 for normal operation or high-speed testing. The control signals can be accessed within and/or external to the package 300.<br>
[00023]	 A multiplexer 400 can be coupled to enable or disable the output buffer 312. The multiplexer 400 can be coupled to receive inputs from the device controller 366 and the TEST 1 signal. The TEST_2 signal cart be used to select between the inputs to the multiplexer 400, as well as to enable or disable the multiplexer 360. Other multiplexers (not shown) can be similarly coupled to enable/disable respective multiplexer 358, 362, 364, and to select between input signals to respective output buffers 310,354, 356.<br><br>
[00024]	The main die 302 can also include a transmission  gate 370 coupled between bonding pad 314 and the connection to bonding pad 332. Another transmission gate 372 can be coupled between the connection to bonding pad 316 and the connection to bonding pad 330. The transmission gates 370, 372 are enabled during leakage testing to allow any leakage current between bonding pads 314, 322, and/or bonding pads 316, 324 to be detected at the package bonding pads 344, 342, respectively.<br><br>
WO  2005/109021<br><br>
PCT/US2005/010780<br><br>
9<br>
[00025] 	Note that the main die 302 and the stacked die 304 are shown with a limited number of die-to-die connections, transmission gates, buffers, multiplexers, and package bond pads for purposes of illustration, and that additional components can be included in other embodiments<br>
[00026]     In the embodiment shown in FIG. 4, transmission gate 370 comprises an n-channel circuit 402 coupled to a p-channel circuit 404, and an inverter 406 coupled between the gates of the  <br>
the p-channel circuit 404 and the n-channel circuit 402. The conducts when a high level is applied to the gate of the n-channel circuit 402 and a low level is applied to the gate of the p-channel circuit 404. The digital inverter 406 inverts a HIGH input to a LOW output, and vice versa. Thus, when (labeled TEST3) to the inverter 406 is HIGH, the transmission an analog switch for signals on connection 408 at levels between the supply voltage (Vdd) for the p-channel circuit 404 and ground. The transmission gate 372 functions similar to the transmission gate 370, and any of a variety of suitable transmission gates can be utilized as the transmission gates 370,372. The control signal inputs can be configured to be accessed within and/or external to package 300.<br>
[00027] 	The transmission gates 370, 372 allow the leakage current at pads 314, 322, and 316, 324, respectively, to be measured. The transmission gates 370, 372 can be configured to conduct any amount of leakage current, however, the leakage current is ideally within range of a few micro-amperes. Accordingly, the n-channel circuit 402 and the p-channel circuit 404 can include relatively small transistor components, which cause minimal impact on loading or speed during normal operation.<br>
[00028] 	Referring again to FIG. 3, each of the main die 302 and the stacked die 304 may be individually tested (e.g., at the wafer level) to ensure proper functionality of the circuits fabricated on the dies 302, 304. After the dies 302, 304 have been stacked, interconnected, and encapsulated within the package 300, additional testing may be performed to ensure that the main die 302 and the stacked die 304 were not damaged during the assembly of the package 300, and that the connections 318, 320 are functional.<br><br>
WO 2005/109021<br><br>
PCT/US2005/010780<br><br><br>
10<br><br>
[00029]	Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, the connections to the TEST_1, TEST_2, and  TEST_3 signals can be brought to pins on the package 300 to enable control of the test modes. The configuration of the main die 302  and the stacked die 304 in the package 300 supports normal operation as well as high frequency, high-speed test using the digital multiplexers 358, 360, 362, 364,  and the leakage current test using the transmission gates 370,372.<br><br>
[00030]     	In the embodiment shown, the TEST1, TEST_2, and TEST_3 signals can be configured to control the state of respective transmission gates 370, 372; buffers 306, 308; and multiplexers 358, 360, 362, 364.   Alternatively, multiple TEST_1, TEST-2, and TEST_3 signals can be implemented to control one or more of the respective components independently of the others.    Such a configuration would allow, for example, the connection 318 to be tested independently of the connection 320. In some embodiments, the settings shown in Table 1 can be used to configure the test modes and normal operation for the main die 302.   In Table 1, High indicates that a signal is asserted, and Low indicates that a signal is not asserted on the corresponding pins.<br>

[00031] Referring to FIGS. 3, 4, and 5, FIG. 5 shows the signal paths on the main die 302 that are used during normal operation. The value of the TEST_1 control signal can be HIGH or LOW, and the TEST_2 control signal is set LOW to disable the multiplexers 358, 36,0, and to enable or disable operation of the output buffers 310, 312<br><br>

11<br><br>
based on whether data is being sent or received by the main die 302.   The TEST_3 control signal is also set LOW during normal operation to disable the transmission gates 370, 372.<br>
[00032] 	Referring to FIGS. 3 and 6, FIG. 6 shows the signal paths on the main die 302 that are used during high-speed test modes, which include test signals being input to and output from the main die 302.   In the embodiment of the package 300 shown, signals can be input and output at the package bonding pads 342, 344 during high-speed testing.<br>
[00033] 	When test signals are output from the main die 302 to the stacked die 304 during high-speed write test, test input signals can be applied at pads 344, 342. The TEST_1 control signal is HIGH to enable the multiplexers 358, 360, 362, 364.

ABSTRACT<br>
A main die and a stacked die are included in the same component package. A transmission gate (370) is implemented on the main die, and can be enabled to receive leakage current in a connection (318) between the main die and the stacked die, and to conduct the leakage current to a bonding pad (344) that is accessible external to the package. Thus, the connectivity between the main die and the stacked die can be tested after the dies are packaged. The transmission gate is disabled during high-speed testing and normal Operation. The package can also include a multiplexer (364) that is enabled during high-speed testing to input and output test signals at the package level. A direction signal is used to indicate whether test signals are being input to or output from the main die.<br></td>
