'AUTOMATED BANKING MACHINE APPARATUS AND METHOD OF<br>
ENCLOSING THE SAME'<br>
DIEBOLD INCORPORATED, of 5995 Mayfair Road, North Canton, Ohio 44720, United States of America, an Ohio corporation,<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to automated banking machine<br>
apparatus and method of enclosing the same. [<br>
This invention relates to automated banking machines. Specifically<br>
this invention relates to an enclosure structure for an automated banking machine.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Automated banking machines are known in the prior art.  A common type of automated banking machine is an automated teller machine (ATM). Users operate ATMs to conduct banking transactions. Transactions commonly conducted at ATMs include dispensing cash, making deposits, making account balance inquiries, making transfers between accounts, paying bills, cashing checks and other types of automated transactions. Other types of automated banking machines perform different or additional functions such as dispensing tickets, dispensing or receiving gaming materials, or providing payment for goods or services. For purposes of this disclosure any machine that is capable of accomplishing transactions involving transfers of value shall be considered an automated banking machine.<br>
Automated banking machines include enclosures that house components used to cany out transactions. ATM enclosures are usually comprised of metal. The enclosure commonly includes a chest portion. The chest portion often houses currency, deposits and the mechanisms that handle these items. The chest portion also generally houses critical electronic components that must be protected from tampering. The chest portion also commonly has an access door which is controlled by a suitable lock.  The lock pi events access to the interior of the chest by unauthorized personnel. The type of chest used often varies with the type of ATM and the location where the machine is to be installed. Machines which operate in environments where they may be unattended for substantial periods of time commonly have higher<br><br><br>
security chests and enclosures than machines which are installed in lobbies of buildings, stores or other places where guards or other people are usually present.<br>
Banking machine enclosures also often include less secure portions in addition to the chest portion. These less secure enclosure portions house items such as printers, screen displays, card readers and other items that are less valuable and/or less susceptible to tampering than those items within the chest. While the less secure portions of ATM enclosures do not provide as high a degree of security as the chest portion, access to less secure portions is also generally controlled through locking mechanisms. This is done to discourage access and tampering by unauthorized personnel. The locking mechanisms generally enable authorized personnel to obtain quick access for purposes of routine maintenance such as changing paper rolls and printer ribbons.<br>
Automated banking machine enclosures presently are generally constructed in a manner suitable for either a lobby installation environment or a through-the-wall installation environment. In a lobby installation environment the machine is generally freestanding within an interior area of a building. The machine is usually exposed on all sides except the bottom. As persons are generally present in close proximity to the machine in a lobby environment, an extremely high degree of security is generally not required. This is because persons are generally present to report or stop any improper activity that is occurring to try to open the machine. Because the machine is in view in a lobby installation, efforts are generally made to make the enclosure look as attractive as possible. This is often done by forming the enclosure so that it includes rounded shapes, surface coatings, attractive color schemes and the like. This adds to the cost of the machine.<br>
Another common type of ATM configuration is a through-the-wall configuration. In a through-the-wall installation, the machine is mounted so that the enclosure of the machine is positioned on a first side of an interior or exterior building wall. The customer interface of the machine is positioned to<br><br><br>
be accessible through an opening in the wall. A customer positioned on the opposite side of the wall from the enclosure is enabled to operate the machine. Through the wall machines are designed to be operated by users who either walk up or drive up to the interface. In such installations, the enclosure for the ATM is not required to be as attractive as a lobby unit because the enclosure is generally not visible to users of the machine.<br>
When an ATM is mounted through an exterior wall of a building, steps generally must be taken to prevent damage to machine components due to the infiltration of rain and snow into the interior of the machine. As the machine interface is exposed to the elements, generally only the interface needs to be weatherproofed. The other portions of the enclosure are positioned inside a building structure which minimizes the exposure of components not adjacent to the interface to outside elements.<br>
Sometimes it is desired to provide an automated banking machine in a location where there is no building wall through which a through-the-wall mounting may be made. In these situations it is common to construct a vestibule or similar enclosure for housing the ATM. The machine may then be mounted in the enclosure in a through-the-wall type configuration.  In such circumstances, the vestibule serves as a small building for housing the ATM enclosure.<br>
There are sometimes locations external to building lobbies where it would be desirable to position an ATM, but there is insufficient room to construct a vestibule or similar enclosure. For these locations there is no satisfactory banking machine which can be installed. While a machine designed for installation in a lobby may be placed in the location, such machines are generally not resistant to the elements and damage would soon occur due to exposure. Such damage may commonly occur due to infiltration of moisture and dirt into the machine and extremes of heat and cold,  m addition, exterior locations are often unattended. This results in a greater risk of damage and break-in to the machine. Lobby units generally are not built to<br><br><br>
withstand lengthy attacks by machine tools that could more readily be attempted in an unattended external environment.<br>
Thus there exists a need for an automated banking machine enclosure that can be installed in an external environment without requiring a surrounding vestibule or similar structure. There further exists a need for an automated banking machine enclosure that is durable and resistant to attack to a sufficient degree to be installed in an unattended outdoor environment.<br>
There further exists a need for an automated banking machine enclosure that can be made more attractive at a relatively lower cost than existing enclosures. There further exists a need for an automated banking machine enclosure that is simpler in construction and which can be produced at a lower cost.<br>

The chest portion 14 may serve to support the input and output devices and the polymer body 28.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the automated banking machine 10 of the first embodiment is suitable for installation in an outdoor environment, such as on a curb as shown. As later explained, automated banking machine 10 is particularly well-suited for an outdoor environment because of useful characteristics associated with its enclosure construction. The machine 10 of this exemplary embodiment also occupies relatively less space than an automated banking machine positioned in a vestibule or similar structure.<br>
As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the enclosure 12 of machine 10 includes body 28. In this exemplary embodiment, body 28 is comprised of a generally<br><br><br><br><br><br>
owned by the Assignee of the present invention, the teachings of which patents<br>
A    j     are incorporated herein by reference. In other embodiments other suitable cast or fabricated structures may be used. Additionally, the chest portion may comprise an insertable, removable, replaceable or reusable filler material. Such material may include sand, water, or other suitable granular or fiuidic material which serves as a filler for cavities in the chest structure. The use of a filler material which can be inserted at the installation site provides for easier transport of the chest portion. The filler material may also be removable and<br><br><br><br><br>
recycled. Alternatively the filler material may be of the type that undergoes a<br>
change from a generally fluid to a generally solid stale after it is added to the filler cavities in the chest portion. Securing structures such as anchors or other members may be attached to the chest body 42. Furthermore, the chest body may be integral with an adjacent walking surface, such as a concrete sidewalk. The entire enclosure, or parts thereof, may be produced to include specific figures and shapes, for example cartoon characters for use at amusement parks. The enclosure may also be produced in the shape and colors of specific football helmets, baseball caps, soccer balls, and other ornamental shapes and colors.<br>
In the described embodiment the body 28 conforms closely in texture and appearance to the exterior of the chest body 42 such that both appear to a user to be made of the same material. Chest body portion 42 includes a top surface 54. Top surface 54 includes a plurality of openings 56 therethrough. Openings 56 provide access for electrical and other connections between items in the interior of the chest portion 14 and items in the upper portion 16 of the enclosure. Top surface 54 also includes a plurality of fastener accepting openings therein as shown.<br>
A cover 58 is mounted in supporting connection with the top surface of the chest body. The cover is adapted to house input and output devices. Cover 58 includes a top 60, a first side 62 and a second side 64. The top and sides of the cover define a front opening, generally indicated 66, and a rear opening, generally indicated 68. The sides 62 and 64 include flange areas 70 through which fasteners may extend and secure the cover 58 to the chest. The chest body and the cover comprise a frame for supporting transaction function devices.<br>
In this exemplary embodiment, a pair of opposed slides 72 are mounted in supporting connection with sides 62 and 64 of the cover. A roll¬out tray 74 is movably mounted in supporting connection with the slides 72. This configuration enables the tray 74 to be selectively moved outward<br><br><br><br>
through the front opening 66 in the cover and the opening in the surrounding<br>
body 28. In the described embodiment, the tray 74 is in supporting connection with the display screen as well as with the card reader, receipt printer, keypad and function buttons. Tray 74 is also in supporting connection with the fascia 32. As will be appreciated in Figure 1, this construction enables an authorized service person to unlock locking mechanism 34 and to move tray 74 outward for purposes of accessing the components thereon for service activities.<br>
Body 28 further includes flange areas 16 which extend in a lower interior area thereof. Flange areas 76, through which fasteners may extend, are used to attach body 28 to the top surface of chest body 42. Hence, the body may be mounted in supported connection with the chest portion. This construction serves to prevent unauthorized persons from obtaining access to the fasteners holding body 28 in position. The flange areas may be connected to corresponding flange areas 43 on the chest portion, or they may be directly secured to the chest portion by fasteners, such as screws 45. Figures 4A and 4B show suitable exemplary fastening arrangements. Other fastening arrangements may be used to reduce the number of fasteners. For example, flange area 76 may be extended to align with flange area 70, or vice versa.<br>
As can be appreciated from Figures 4 and 5, body 28 generally surrounds cover 58 on all sides except in the area of body opening 30 and the bottom opening 29. Cover 58 may be adapted to fit through body opening 30 or body bottom opening 29. An interior surface bounding body 28 is also disposed outward from the outer surface of cover 58 in the described embodiment so as to define an air space generally indicated 78 between the body and the cover. The air space 78 in the described embodiment is operative to provide enhanced thermal insulation between the cover 58 and the exterior of the machine. The air space 78 also serves to isolate the body 28 from the components which are supported in connection with cover 58. As a result, the force of impacts to the body 28 are less likely to be transmitted to such components and cause damage thereto. In alternative forms of the<br><br><br><br>
enclosure, the space between the body and the cover may be filled with foam,<br>
fiber or other shock or thermal resistance material.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, in the exemplary embodiment body 28 houses an inlet blower 80 and an outlet blower 82. Inlet blower 80 is in operative fluid connection with an opening 84 on the rear of body 28 shown in Figure 5. Outlet blower 82 is in fluid connection with an opening 86 on the rear of body 28. The blowers 82 and 80 may be selectively operated to facilitate the transfer of air into and out of the air space 78 for heating and cooling purposes. As schematically represented in Figure 4, a heater element 88 and a cooling element 90 are provided within the cover 58 of the exemplary embodiment to maintain temperatures therein within a range desirable for operation of the components of the banking machine within the cover and/or within the chest. An air passage 92, shown in Figures 2 and 3, facilitates the passage of air between the interior of the cover 58 and the air space 78. Of course, suitable thermostats and other temperature control devices may be provided for sensing and maintaining the desired temperatures within the interior of the enclosure 12.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, body 28 of enclosure 12 may be provided with a light fixture 94. Light fixture 94 of the described embodiment is supported on and attached to top surface 52 of the body 28.  hi the described form of the invention, light fixture 94 is a generally translucent enclosure housing a light source therein. A light fixture 94 preferably provides a light source which generates light outward therefrom generally parallel to the top surface 52 of the ATM.  In the exemplary light fixture 94, light is generated in generally all directions parallel to the top surface 52. This provides lighting to the front, sides and back of the enclosure. This may be desirable when the machine is essentially freestanding. If, however, the machine is positioned in a comer area, for example, generating light through an angle of about 90 degrees may be sufficient to provide adequate lighting for operation of the machine.<br><br><br><br>
As will be appreciated, the light fixture 94 may be readily attached to<br>
the body 28 in numerous ways. In addition, the presence of the air space underlying the surface of the body 28 in the exemplary embodiment facilitates the mounting and electrical connection of a light fixture. The components in the cover are generally isolated by the air space from heat produced by the light source in the light fixture.<br>
As will be appreciated, the enclosure 12 of the exemplary automated banking machine 10 provides a durable, high-strength and weather-resistant enclosure for the components of the machine. The construction is well-suited to resist elements such as rain and snow encountered in outdoor environments. In addition, the space which is occupied by the machine 10 is smaller than space that would be needed for machines installed in vestibules or similar structures. Machine 10 further provides an attractive appearance due to its stylized enclosure and also provides the appearance of a unit that is entirely comprised of cast material. Machines of the invention may be made in numerous shapes. Of course, while the described form of the invention is particularly well-suited to an outdoor, unattended environment, the exemplary embodiment is also suitable for use in interior environments as well.<br>
As will be appreciated, the embodiments of the invention provide substantial advantages over conventional automated banking machine enclosures. In the exemplary embodiment of the enclosure, the generally one piece polymer body extends in surrounding relation of the display screen, input devices and most other transaction function devices of the machine. The body also provides an attractive enclosure of the machine. The body may be molded in many attractive shapes. The body further provides an external protective structure that is highly resistant to various forms of attack. The enclosure also provides ease of assembly and improved access to the machine components for servicing the automated banking machine. The embodiments discussed herein are only a few examples of automated banking machine enclosures that may be achieved by employing the principles of the invention.<br><br><br><br>
Numerous other embodiments of the invention may be produced that are<br>
within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Thus the automated banking machine enclosure of the present invention achieves the above-stated objectives, eliminates difficulties encountered in the use of prior devices and systems and attains the desirable results described herein.<br>
