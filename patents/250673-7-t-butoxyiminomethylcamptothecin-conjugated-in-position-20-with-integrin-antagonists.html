7-t-Butoxyiminomethylcamptothecin conjugated in position 20 with in-tegrin antagonists<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to compounds with cytotoxic activity consisting of cyclopeptides containing the RGD sequence and derivatives of camptothecin, methods for the preparation thereof, their use as medicaments and compositions containing them.<br>
In particular, the compounds described in the present invention are endowed with both high affinity for integrins aV63 and av65 and selective cytotoxic activity on human cell lines at micromolar concentrations.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
Chemotherapeutic anticancer agents are the drugs with the most restrictive therapeutic window. In fact, since their cytotoxic activity is non-selective they may indiscriminately damage all the cells of the body with which they come into contact.<br>
There currently exists the problem of directing the cytotoxic agent selectively against the tumour cells, allowing the agent to exert its activity without damaging the cells of the healthy surrounding tissues, or at least limiting the damage as much as possible.<br>
It has been reported in the literature that blocking the integrins av83 and av65 by means of the use of selective cyclopeptides, the reference compound for which is regarded as cyclopentapeptide c(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Val) (JACS 1997, 119, 1328-35; international patent application WO 97/06791), or by means of the use of monoclonal antibodies (Cell, 1994, 79, 1157-64) leads to the blocking of angiogenesis and to a reduction of tumour growth. In addition, antimetastatic effects have also been observed (J. Clin. Invest, 1995, 96, 1815). Brooks et al. {Science,<br><br>
WO 2005/110486	PCT/IT2005/000245<br>
2<br>
1994, 264, 569-71) reported that the endo-thelial cells of the tumour vasculature and the tumour cells themselves preferentially express in-tegrin avB3 compared to the quiescent cells of normal tissue. Among the compounds at an advanced stage of clinical development, we may mention c(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-MeVal), or EMD121974 or cilengitide.<br>
Ruoslati and co-workers {Current Opinion in Oncology, 1998, 10, 560-5) showed that RGD analogues that bind to the tumour endothelium, once conjugated to the cytotoxic agent doxorubicin, form compounds that are more efficient and less toxic than doxorubicin alone. These authors also demonstrated, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the effect is attributable to the conjugation to RGD, inasmuch as the binding is antagonised by the free peptide itself (Arap, Pasqualini and Ruoslati, Science, 1998, 279, 377-380). Later, the same authors carried out other experiments consisting in chemically binding a pro-apoptotic peptide sequence to an RGD analogue, demonstrating that the new compounds were selectively toxic for angiogenic endothelial cells and had antican-cer activity in mice (Ruoslati, Nature Medicine, 1999, 5, 1032-8).<br>
Marcus et al, in international patent application WO 01/17563, describe specific anticancer activity for cytotoxic agents, such as campto-thecin, conjugated by means of a spacer, consisting of one or more amino acids, to a non-peptidic inhibitor antagonist of integrins av63 and CLvB5.<br>
Aoki et al., Cancer Gene Therapy, 2001, 8, 783-787 describe the specific anticancer activity of a histidylated oligolysine conjugated to an RGD sequence, revealing a homing effect for tumours in mice.<br>
The concept of binding at the cell surface mediated by integrins has been proposed for gene transport (Hart, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1994, 269, 12468-12474).<br><br>

7-tert-butoxyiminomethylcamptothecin (or CPT184 or ST 1481 or Gi-matecan) is a derivative of camptothecin which is active orally and is described in European Patent EP 1 044 977.<br>
It has now been found that 7-t-butoxyiminomethylcamptothecin conjugated in position 20, possibly by means of suitable spacers, to cyclopep-tide derivatives containing the RGD sequence yields compounds endowed with high, selective anticancer activity which can be advantageously used for the preparation of medicaments for the treatment of tumours.<br>
By virtue of their selective cytotoxic activity on tumour cells, the compounds according to the present invention yield medicaments with fewer and less severe side effects.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
The object of the present invention are derivatives of 7-t-butoxyiminomethylcamptothecin conjugated to cyclopeptide derivatives containing the RGD sequence. The resulting molecules possess unaltered both the cytotoxic properties of the original camptothecins and integrin binding properties with affinity comparable to that observed with the non-conjugated cyclopeptides. The result of this combination is to favour the concentration of the cytotoxic agent in those cells that most express integrins of the av63 and ctvBs type (homing). The cytotoxic agent exerts its intracellular activity in the conjugated and/or free form through enzymatic or hydrolytic action. The main object of the present invention are therefore compounds of Formula (I) <br><br>

The present invention comprises the use of compounds with the above-mentioned compounds of Formula (I) as active ingredients for medicaments useful as topoisomerase I inhibitors. Among the therapeutic applications deriving from topoisomerase I inhibition, we mention parasitic or viral infections.<br>
Given their particular pharmacological characteristics, the compounds of Formula (I) compounds are also useful for the preparation of medicaments for the treatment of tumours and the metastatic forms thereof.<br>
The present invention also comprises pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of Formula (I) as active ingredients, in mixtures with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle and/or excipient.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention are the result of the condensation of 7-t-butoxyiminomethylcamptothecin, functionalised in position 20, with a cyclopeptide containing the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence. This structural combination has the advantage of favouring the concentration of the cytotoxic agent (camptothecin) in the cells that most express integrins of the a 63 and civBs type. The cytotoxic agent exerts its activity in the conjugated and/or free form through enzymatic or hydrolytic action.<br>
The definitions of the various functional groups and residues, as well as the definitions of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts that figure in the above-mentioned formula (I), are common knowledge to any ex-<br><br>
WO 2005/110486	PCT/IT2005/000245<br>

pert chemist and no particular definitions are necessary. However, reference to such groups can be found in the technical and patent literature, e.g. in international patent applications WO 00/53607, WO 03/101995 and WO 03/101996.<br>
One initial group of preferred compounds consists of the compounds of Formula (I) where U and/or X are not absent.<br>
The preferred compounds according to the present invention are the following:<br><br>
Compounds of Formula (I) can be prepared with the process described here below and exemplified for the preferred compounds according to the invention. This process constitutes a further object of the invention.<br>
Fundamentally, the compounds of Formula (I) which are the object of the present invention are prepared by means of the condensation of 7-t-butoxyiminomethylcamptothecin (indicated as "7-t-but-CP"), possibly functionalised via a suitable bridge (indicated as "Ui-Xi") , with a cy-clopeptide derivative (indicated as "Yi").<br><br>
WO 2005/110486	PCT/IT2005/000245<br>
7<br>
The condensation reactions can be carried out according to one of the following reaction schemes:<br>
7-t-but-CP + U1-X1-Y1 or<br>
7-t-but-CP-U1 + X1-Y1 or<br>
7-t-but-CP-U1-X1 + Y1or 7-t-but-CP + U1 + X1 + Y1 or<br>
7-t-but-CP-U1 + X1 + Y1;<br>
where 7-t-but-CP represents 7-t-butoxyiminomethylcamptothecin, Ui, X1 and Y1 represent respectively the groups U, X and Y as defined in Formula I, eventually appropriately functionalised and/or protected so that the conjugated compounds of Formula I are obtained.<br>
These reactions are conducted using conventional methods, such as, for instance, those described Journal of Controlled Release 2003, 91, 61-73; S.S. Dharap et al; Journal of Medicinal Chem. 2003, 46, 190-3, R.Bhatt;<br>
The cyclopeptides Y1 can be prepared according to conventional pep-tide synthesis techniques, as described in examples 1 to 6. The peptide synthesis can be accomplished either in the solid phase or in solution.<br>
Once the desired cyclopeptide has been obtained, it will be used in the condensation reaction in its protected form, and the protector groups will be removed only after obtaining the final compound. The deprotec-tion is done using known methods, e.g. acid conditions by means of the use of pure trifluoroacetic acid or in the presence of chlorinated organic solvents.<br>
The compounds described in the present invention are topoisomerase I inhibitors and are therefore useful as medicaments, particularly for the treatment of diseases that benefit from the inhibition of said topoisomerase. In particular, the compounds according to the present invention exhibit antiproliferative activity, and therefore are used for their therapeutic properties, and possess physicochemical properties<br><br>
WO 2005/110486	PCT/IT2005/000245<br>

which make them suitable for formulation in pharmaceutical compositions..<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions contain at least one formula (I) compound as an active ingredient, in an amount such as to produce a significant therapeutic effect. The compositions covered by the present invention are entirely conventional and are obtained using methods that are common practice in the pharmaceutical industry. According to the administration route opted for, the compositions will be in solid or liquid form and suitable for oral, parenteral or intravenous administration. The compositions according to the present invention contain, along with the active ingredient, at least one pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle or excipient. Formulation adjuvants, such as, for example, solubilising agents, dispersing agents, suspension agents or emulsifying agents may be particularly useful.<br>
The compounds of Formula (I) can also be used in combination with other active ingredients, such as, for example, anticancer agents or other drugs with antiparasitic or antiviral activity, both in separate forms and in a single dosage form.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention are useful as medicaments with anticancer activity, e.g. in non-microcytoma and small-cell lung cancer, or in colorectal or prostate cancer, glioblastoma and neuroblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, gastrointestinal carcinoma, carcinoma of the liver, Kaposi's sarcoma, renal carcinoma, sarcoma and osteosarcoma, testicular carcinoma, carcinoma of the breast, carcinoma of the pancreas, melanoma, carcinoma of the urinary bladder and of the head and neck. One of the advantages afforded by the compounds according to the present invention is the combination of antitopoisomerase activity, proper to the camptothecin portion of the molecule, and the integrin inhibiting activity, provided by the cy-clopeptide portion of the molecule. The result is the possible combined action of the compounds according to the present invention which will be favourably received in the oncological sector by the experts operating in that sector. In fact, the cyclopeptide portion, containing the Arg-<br><br>
WO 2005/110486	PCT/IT2005/000245<br>
9<br>
Gly-Asp sequence, not only directs the molecule against tumours expressing integrins, but, once the target has been reached, is capable of exerting multiple functions, ranging from the internalisation of the cy-totoxic portion of the molecule to integrin inhibiting activity, with the resulting advantages, particularly in terms of the inhibition of tumour angiogenesis. The cyclopeptide portion, once separated from the camp-tothecin portion, is also capable of exerting its action at a distance from the site of the tumour, and therefore the compounds according to the present invention also prove useful in the prevention or treatment of metastatic forms.<br>
The medicaments which are the object of the present invention can also be used in the treatment of parasite diseases.<br>

Synthesis of c(Arg(Pmc)-Gly-Asp(OtBuVD-Phe-Amp) (protected ST2581)<br>
1.587 mmol of Fmoe-Gly-Res (Res = Sasrin Resin®, Bachem) were suspended under stirring in 75 ml of DMF for 30 minutes, after which 18 ml of piperidine were added, continuing the stirring for a further 30 minutes. The resin, filtered and washed with DMF, was suspended in 50 ml of NMP (N-methyl-pyrrolidone) for 15 minutes, after which Fmoc-Arg(Pmc)-OH, HOBT, TBTU and DIEA were added (3.174 mmol of each); after 2 hours of stirring, the suspension was filtered and washed with DMF. After deprotection with piperidine, the coupling was repeated with the other amino acids in succession, operating each time as described above, namely: Fmoc-Amp(Cbz)-OH, Fmoc-D-Phe-OH, and Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH. After the last deprotection of the Fmoc-N-terminal, the linear pentapeptide was released from the resin with 45 ml of 1% TFA in DCM. This was dissolved in approximately 1 1 of CH3CN, and 4.761 mmol of HOBT and TBTU and 10 ml of DIEA were added; the solution was kept under stirring for 30 minutes, the solvent was evaporated to a small volume and the precipitation of the product was completed with water. The filtered crude product was dissolved in 27 ml of a mixture of MeOH and DMF 1:1; 5 mmol of ammonium for-miate and 0.55 g of 10% Pd/C were added and left under stirring at room temperature for 30 minutes. The suspension was filtered on ce-lite and brought to dryness. The residue was purified by preparatory RP-HPLC (column: Alltima® C-18, Alltech; mobile phase 50% CH3CN in water + 0.1% TFA; retention time (Rt) = 9.13 minutes). 483 mg of a white powder were obtained.<br><br>

The linear peptide was synthesized in solid phase as described in example 1, inserting Fmoc-N-Me-Phe-(4-Pht-N-CH2)-COOH as the third amino acid, prepared as described above. In this case the deprotections of N-Fmoc-terminal on resin were carried out with 30% diisopro-pylamine (300 eq) in solution in DMF (owing to the presence of phthalimide). After cyclisation, 500 mg of the peptide were dissolved hot in 10 ml of absolute EtOH, to which 0.9 ml of a solution of NH2-NH2H2O 1 M in ethanol was added. After heating at reflux for 2 hours, the solvent was evaporated and the residue taken up with 10 ml of DCM + 10 ml of Na2CO3 solution under vigorous shaking. The crude final product was recovered from the organic phase after evaporation and purified by preparatory RP-HPLC (mobile phase: 52% CH3CN in water + 0.1% TFA; Rt = 10 minutes).<br>

Cytotoxicitv of the conjugates on different tumor cell lines<br>
To evaluate the effect of the compound on survival cells, the sulphoro-damine B test was used. To test the effects of the compounds on cell growth, PC3 human prostate carcinoma, A498 human renal carcinoma, A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells and NCI-H460 non-small cell lung carcinoma were used. A2780, NCI-H460 and PC3 tumor cells were grown RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO), whereas A498 tumor cells were grown in EMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO).<br>
Tumor cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates (Corning) at approximately 10% confluence and were allowed to attach and recover for at least 24 h. Varying concentrations of the drugs were then added to each well to calculate their IC50 value (the concentration which inhibits the 50% of cell survival). The plates were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C or 2 h followed by 72 h of recovery. At the end of the treatment, the plates were washed by removal of the surnatant and addition of PBS 3 times. 200 PBS and 50 fil of cold 80%TCA were added. The plates were incubated on ice for at least 1 h. TCA was removed, the plates were washed 3 times for immersion in distilled-water and dried on paper and at 40°C for 5 min.<br>
Then 200 pi of 0.4% sulphorodamine B in 1% acetic acid were added. The plates were incubated at room temperature for other 30 min. Sulphorodamine B was removed, the plates were washed for immersion in 1% acetic acid for 3 times, then they were dried on paper and at 40 °C for 5 min.<br>
Then 200 pi Tris 10 ml were added, the plates were kept under stirring for 20 min. The survival cell was determined as optical density by a Multiskan spectrofluorimeter at 540 nm. The amount of cells killed was calculated as the percentage decrease in sulphorodamine B binding compared with control cultures.<br><br>
