The atmosphere air window at rear of the structure, where the air goes in to the cooler consists of at least 5 milli meter thinned water wetted pad (with wire mesh support), slightly becomes wet by the arrangement of water supply through a pipe, under control by a cock. The above said pipe having small holes on its bottom side at equal distances along the pipe length wise, which is positioned at the top of the water wetted pad. The purpose of the thinned water wetted pad is to filter the dust and dirt of the air, which is going in to the cooler and also this air humidified slightly. The excessive supplied water from above said water wetted pad is collected by the small water collection tray, which is positioned at bottom of the water wetted pad, where in said small water collection tray having a drain point and connected with flexible hose. From this drain point the excessive water goes to water tank or its bottom water collection tray of the shelf through a connected flexible hose.<br>
The shelves are in the structure is horizontal and with parallel to each other as integral part of the structure, at before the above said air window. The purpose of the shelves is, to support and position the water collection trays. The said water collection trays are for the purpose of collecting the excessive oozed out water from the sidewalls of water-circulated containers and also facilitate for position of water circulated containers round rod frames. The said water collection tray comprising slight edges, at least one drain point at any one corner and at bottom surface of the tray with connected flexible hose, where the collected water goes to another water collection tray of another shelf. With above explained utility procedure the all water collection trays are collect the excessive oozed out water and supplied through respective drain points and flexible hoses to its bottom shelfs water collection tray, till up to the last shelf"s water collection tray, from this water collection tray drain point, the collected water is supplied to the water tank inlet connection through flexible hose, for recirculation of water to the cooler system. Here the numbering order for the shelves is from top to bottom only.<br>
The said round rod frames are positioned in the above said water collection trays in vertical also parallel to each other with equal distances. Each round rod<br><br>
diameter is at least 2 milli meter. The purpose of the round rod frames are to support the above said water-circulated containers to stand in vertical and parallel to each other with equal distances, when the above said water-circulated containers are filled with water or an empty. The round rod frames comprising vertical and horizontal overlapping round rods, soldered together at overlapping points. Each round rod frame provides facilities by the support of the vertical and longitude round rods with a gap(as a channel or space) in which the water circulated containers are positioned and each round rod frame having the two gaps(as a channel or space) for positioning of two water circulated containers and also the distance between the water circulated containers is at least 05 milli meter and also the distance between the two water circulated containers of two round rod frames{which are placed side by side with parallel to each other in the same water collection tray) also at least 05 milli meter. These frames are having the extended round rods as leg support at bottom only. The above said round rod frames(along with water circulated containers) of all shelves are equally in size, in shape and are positioned equally in all the shelves.<br>

The said water circulated containers comprising a water inlet at bottom and water outlet at the top respectively. The said inlet and outlet are diagonal and at opposite corners(means at apposite external surfaces of the water circulated containers) in opposite direction respectively. These water-circulated container"s side walls are having the very minute pores through which water slowly and continuously ooze out, so that the side walls of water circulated containers and said side wall"s external surfaces becomes slightly wet, when the water circulated containers are filled by water. The wetness contains the water molecules (which are oozed out slowly through the minute pores of side walls of water circulated containers) and its surface area is increased due to its formation as wet on the external surfaces and also in side walls of water circulated containers. The said water molecules increased surface area(wetness) is easy to evaporate by heat energy(which is in the form of heat in air) of the air(which is moving closely to the wetness, when it is sucked by the electrical motor fan). This results in loss of heat energy(which is in the form of heat) of air and also loss of inherent heat of water molecules. The said water circulated containers shapes can be either square or rectangular or roundel or etc, but where in said water circulated containers are rectangular shape only. The above said water circulated containers are positioned in gaps(as a channels or places) of round rod frames. Where in said, round rod frames are positioned, vertical to the respective shelf and also parallel to each other.<br>

The flow of the water in the water circulated containers is opposite to the air, which flows between the water circulated containers in all shelves. Here, series means, the first (here the number can be given to the water circulated containers in any direction i.e. left to right vice<br><br>
versa and top to bottom vice versa, this numbering order should similar for all the water circulated containers of other shelves) water-circulated container (which is in top water collection tray of shelf) outlet is connected to the inlet connection of first water circulated container which is in the water collection tray of second shelf. The second water-circulated container outlet, which is in first self, is to be connected to the second water-circulated container inlet, which is in second shelf. Like this all shelves water-circulated containers outlets and inlets are connected with flexible hoses in series, till up to last (bottom) shelf water circulated containers. In last shelf, the all outlets of the water-circulated containers are connected independently by a flexible hose to the small diameter thinned (at least 7 milli meter diameter), flattened aluminum pipes in series(means each out let connection of the water-circulated container is connected to one aluminum pipe one end).<br>
The above said aluminum pipes are routed in square roundel shape with gap between them, so that the air, which is sucked by the electrical motor fan can pass easily between the said aluminum pipes. The said routed pipes are positioned between the electrical motor fan and water circulated container"s shelves. Another ends of the aluminum pipes are connected to the water collection pipe inlets with flexible hoses independently. The above said water collection pipe, is having number of inlet connections(depending on the number of aluminum pipes used indepen¬dently) on its surface along its length wise and water outlet connection. This water out let connection is connected to the water tank inlet connection with flexible hose.<br>
The above said water tank is thermally insulated, which is positioned at bottom of the structure, for the purpose of storage and maintains the water level and supplies the water to cooler system. It is having a water level indicator for the purpose of indicating the water level in the tank. A water filler neck with filler cap is mounted on water tank for the purpose of filling the filtered water in the tank. Water drain point for the purpose of draining the water from tank. The water over flow drain point for the purpose of draining the over filled water from the tank. The said electrical motor pump is operated by a switch, the purpose of the electrical motor pump is positioned at adjacent to the water tank, the purpose of the electrical motor pump is to suck the water from the water tank and supplied to the cooler system.<br>
The above said water distribution pipe is for the purpose of distributing the water equally to the water-circulated containers, comprising an inlet and outlets on its surface at equal distances with equal diameter pipes. These water distribution pipe outlets are depending on the number of water-circulated containers in the first shelf and one more outlet for supplying the water through flexible hose to above said water wetted pad, which is fitted at the air window of the cooler. The above said outlet connections of water distribution pipe are connected with flexible hoses to the inlet of water-circulated containers, which are in top(first) shelf by flexible hoses independently.<br>
The above said electrical motor fan is positioned at the front side of the cooler structure, for the purpose of the sucking the atmosphere air through the rear air window, through thinned water wetted pad, between the wetted side walls of water-circulated containers, also between the small diameter thinned-flattened aluminum pipes, then the said air blows in to the room. The above said electrical motor fan speed is operated or controlled by an electrical fan regulator. The above said electrical fan blown air humidity is controlled by the air, which is drawn by an<br><br>
electrical motor fan along with above said humidified air from the atmosphere through atmosphere air window, so that the atmosphere dry air will mix with above said humidified air and the humidity of the air decrease and control.<br>
The above said atmosphere air windows comprising with wire mesh, movable shutters are connected to the mechanical linkage, the said mechanical linkage is further connected to the control knob. The purpose of the above said atmosphere air windows is for filtering the atmosphere dry air from dust and dirt and the said windows shutters for controlling the air flow in to the cooler, when the air is sucked by the electrical fan and the said shutters are operated by the control lever with mechanical linkage, the said shutters can positioned at required place(between open and close position). These windows are fitted at left and right (or top and bottom) of the electrical motor fan wing tips, but behind the small diameter flatted thinned aluminum pipes routing area on side panels (or top and bottom panels), which are covering the electrical fan and aluminum pipes routing area.<br>
Working procedure of the Natural Air Cooler is as follows. Checks the water level in the water tank and filled the water in the tank, if water is not up to maximum level. Connect the cooler electrical supply card to electrical power and switch on the electrical motor pump. The said electrical motor pump sucks the water from the water tank and supplies to the cooler system through a flexible hose to the water distribution pipe. The said water distribution pipe distributes the water equally through its outlets and supplies through the series connected flexible hoses to the inlets of top(first) shelf water-circulated containers respectively. When the water is filled in the water circulated containers of first shelf, the water goes through outlets of the said water circulated containers and through the series connected flexible hose to the inlet of water-circulated containers of second shelf respectively. The said water circulated containers of second shelf, are filled by the water and the excessive water is further goes through the said containers outlets and through the series connected flexible hoses to the inlets of water-circulated containers of last shelf respectively. The said water circulated containers of last shelf, are filled by the water and the excessive water is further goes through the said containers outlets and supplied by the connected flexible hoses to the thinned flattened aluminum pipes and further goes to the water collection pipe inlets through series connected flexible hoses respectively. The said water collection pipe collect the water and supplies through its outlet by the connected flexible hose to the water tank for recirculation of the water to the cooler system.<br>
In the above process (the water circulated containers are filled by the water), the water circulated containers external surfaces and side walls of water circulated containers becomes continuous wet and also it is constant due to filled water slowly ooze out continuously through minutes pores of the water circulated containers side walls. The said wetness contains the water molecules (which are oozed out slowly through the minute pores of side walls of water circulated containers) and its surface area is increased due to its (water molecules) formation as wet on the external surfaces of water circulated containers. The excessive oozed out water from the minute pores of side walls is collected by the shelves water collection trays and supplied the water from one shelf to another shelf through respective drain points by connected flexible hoses. At the last shelf, the excessive oozed out water and also the all shelves water collection trays collected water goes to the water tank through the drain point of last shelf by connected flexible hose. At<br><br>
the same time (after electrical motor pump switch on), the water from one more outlet of the water distribution pipe is goes through the connected flexible hose and through the water control cock (which controls the water flow) to the water distribution pipe of water wetted pad. The water is supplied evenly through the small holes of water distribution pipe to the thinned water wetted pad, so that this water wetted pad becomes slightly wet. The excessive water from this water wetted pad is collected by the small water collection tray and collected water goes to one of its downed shelf water collection try or to the water tank through connected flexible hose.<br>
Now switch on the electrical motor fan, it sucks the air from the atmosphere through the air window, through the light wetted thinned water wetted pad, between the wetted external surfaces of the water-circulated containers(which are in all shelves) and between thinned flattened aluminum pipes, then the is blown in to the room. The above said air is having the energy in the form of heat (as its temperature is more comparison to the room temperature and container stored water in the room in summer season, it is dry and contains the dust and dirt), when it is passing through the light wetted thinned water wetted pad, the air is filtered from the dust and dirt and lightly humidified due to wetness of the said pad. Then the above said filtered and lightly humidified air passes between the continuous wetted external surfaces of water circulated containers, the said air losses heat energy, which is evaporate the wetness on external surface of water circulated containers, thus results the air becomes cold and also humidified due to evaporated water molecules mixed in the air. The water molecules are evaporated easily as its surface area is increased due to its formation as expansion (spreading out)wet. This results in, the temperature of the water molecules is decrease (because the water molecules are loses some energy, whidi is in the form of heat(inherent) of the water molecules, when evaporated), this results the lowering the temperature of the continuous wetted side walls of water circulated containers, this results the lowering the temperature of the circulated water (which is inside the water circulated containers). At the same time, the humidified cold air also provides cooling for the outer surface of the water-circulated containers, thus also results the water (which is moving inside the water-circulated container(s)) gets cold. With above process the air and the water become cold by heat transmission and evaporation. At the same time (when the electrical motor fan running), the atmosphere filtered air also sucked from the wire-meshed atmosphere air window, filtered by the wire mesh and mixed with above said humidified cold air, so that the humidity of the air will be reduced. The humidity in the air is depending on the amount of atmosphere dry air mixed with it. It is possible when the wire-meshed air windows shutters opened or closed as per required by operating knob. This humidity-controlled air further gets cold, when this air passes between the cold-water(the water which is coming after getting the cold from the water circulated containers) supplied thinned flattened aluminum pipes. This cold humidified air further blown in to the room by an electrical motor fan. If this cooler works continuously 30 to 40 minutes, the water temperature decreases up to maximum performance of air cooler and provide much more cold air.<br>
