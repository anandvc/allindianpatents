Retrieving data from an information carrier<br>
The invention relates to a method of retrieving content data and instructional data from a storage medium.<br>
The invention further relates to a system of retrieving content data and instructional data from a storage medium.<br>
The invention further relates to a computer program product designed to perform such a method.<br>
The invention further relates to an information carrier comprising such a computer program product.<br>
The invention further relates to an entertainment device comprising such a system.<br>
Currently, when a Consumer Electronics device (CE) device, like a Compact Disk (CD) player, needs to be able to handle a new disk format, the firmware of the CD player needs to be replaced completely or the CD player as such needs to be replaced by a new version that can handle the new disk format. Replacing the firmware can be done automatically, as described in WO 99/42924. Here, a method of updating firmware between an imaging device, i.e. a camera, and a host system, i.e. a personal computer, is described. The host system detects that the firmware on the imaging device is incompatible with a configuration of the host system. In response to detecting the incompatibility, an update for the firmware is transferred from the host system to the imaging device. The firmware allows the imaging device to communicate with software on the host system. The update for the firmware includes instructions for performing various functions. For example, determine the exposure of an image, sense color in a particular manner, compress image data, etc. When the firmware of the imaging device is updated, the imaging device can for example, handle a new file format.<br><br>

An embodiment of the invention is described in claim 6. By using the information about the content data to determine access rights for the content data, the plug-in can be used to control access to the content data.<br>
An embodiment of the invention is described in claim 7. By using the information about the content data that comprises a physical format of the storage medium, the plug-in takes care that the driver code can read this physical format.<br>
An embodiment of the invention is described in claim 8. By using the information about the content data that comprises a logical format of the storage medium, the plug-in takes care that the driver code can read this logical format.<br>
It is a further object of the current invention to provide a system according to the opening paragraph that handles an incompatibility between a device and a storage medium in an improved way. In order to achieve this object, the content data has a format on the storage medium that is known to the instructional data, the instructional data has a format on the storage medium that is known to the system, the system being conceived to retrieve the instructional data fiom a predefined position on the storage medium; the system being further conceived to retrieve, in cooperation with the instructional data, the content data from the storage medium. These and other aspects of the invention will be apparent fiom and elucidated with reference to the embodiments described hereinafter as illustrated by the following Figures:<br>
Figure 1 illustrates an embodiment of the method according to the invention;<br>
Figure 2 illustrates an embodiment of the method according to the invention for a high level physical plug-in;<br>
Figure 3 illustrates an embodiment of the method according to the invention for a logical mount process<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a DVD player in a schematic way.<br>
Currently, the Personal Computer (PC) world is used to rapid successions of encoders/ decoders (codecs) and formats for, for example, audio and/or video stream formats. Within the Consumer Electronics world (CE) world, more and more formats are being defined for optical disks. A Digital Versatile Disk (DVD) player must allow to play for example Compact Disk (CD), Super Audio Compact Disk (SACS), Photo CD, Video CD<br><br>
(VCD), and MP3. However, a CE device, like a DVD player, is less flexible than a PC. In order to update a CE device for a new codec or a new format, either the firmware of the CE device must be updated or a new CE device must be installed. Both options are not very attractive. The first option to update the firmware is not attractive to the CE device manufacture, since the manufacturer is not in control of the CE device, but the user of the CE device is in control. The second option is not attractive to the user of the CE device, because he/she has to install a new CE device each time a firmware update is required.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates an embodiment of the method according to the invention for a low level physical plug-in. A low level physical plug-in could have an effect upon the physical block numbering. Other examples are: redefinition of the sector format, Error Correction Code (ECC) type, replacing Cross Interleave Reed-Solomon Code 4 (CIRC4) with CIRC7 or replacing the Eight to Fourteen Modulation (EFM) table<br>
Within the first step S100, a DVD disk is submitted to a DVD disk reader. The DVD disk reader is attached to a computing device. The computing device is operable to execute computer readable code designed to receive and send operating commands from and to the DVD disk reader. This computer readable code is also referred to as driver code. The computing device can for example be a DVD-player, or a Television Set, a personal digital assistant (pda), etc. The computing device further comprises firmware as computer readable code that is designed to, amongst others, interpret data being read from a DVD disk.<br>
Within the next step S102, the DVD disk is mounted physically by the DVD disk reader. The physical mounting process depends amongst others upon the type of DVD. The type of DVD is also determined during this mounting process.<br>
Next, within step S104, the driver code scans the disk at a predefined geometrical location. For example, scanning at a radius of 10 millimeter from the center of the DVD. If the driver code is able to detect data at the predefined geometrical position, the method continues to step SI 06. If the driver code is not able to detect the data at the predefined geometrical position, the method continues to step S108.<br>
Within step SI06, the detected data is read by the driver code and installed, to enable the firmware to access the driver code. The firmware for the drive that is able to use plug-ins has provisions to handle plug-ins. There may be different types of plug-ins and the firmware may have different ways of handling different types of plug-ins. The plug-in itself (or a plug-in pointer) identifies the plug-in type. Based on the type indicator the firmware knows how to handle the plug-in. The plug-in is loaded into a separate portion of volatile memory; preferably without overwriting the firmware. It is also possible, that there are<br><br>
multiple portions (or slots) of memory for multiple plug-ins. The firmware is preferably not stored in read only memory (ROM), but in Flash non-volatile Random Access Memory (RAM). However, the firmware could be stored in ROM. The plug-in is transient and only valid for the disc currently being mounted. The firmware does not change but the plug-in provides for new subroutines or procedures that the firmware uses instead of the standard ones. For example, suppose that during"normal operation of the firmware code at a certain stage a physical block number needs to be calculated. Instead of a direct call to the internal firmware procedure performing this calculation it is first checked whether a plug-in has been loaded and whether this plug-in specifies a different procedure for calculating the physical block numbering. If there is no temporary replacement procedure loaded in a plug-in slot the standard (internal) code is executed. If a there is plug-in code loaded for physical block number calculations it supersedes the firmware code and is executed instead of the internal code.<br>
Other examples include inserted code. The firmware includes conditional procedure calls to procedures that may or may not be present based on the plug-in loaded. If a parameter is specified in the firmware, the firmware may check for a replacement value before using the parameter.<br>
Standard firmware code could look like:<br>
callx catty call z (p)<br>
The plug-in enabled firmware code conditionally re-routes procedure calls. For example:<br>
ifplug-in loaded call k<br>
callx<br>
ifplug-in loaded catty * else catty<br>
ifplug-in loaded callz (p') else callz (p)<br>
Then, in this case where the plug-in is not a single replacement procedure or the plug-in starts with a definition table of the content, the plug-in contains for example the following:<br><br>
parameterp' = 12 parameterq* ~ ...<br>
Procedure x' 33 located at address adr#l Procedurey' is located.,.<br>
The addresses is relative to the start of the plug-in code, making the address independent from the location of the plug-in in memory Further, the plug-in enabled firmware code keeps flags for the presence of replacement or inserted code or parameters. For example:<br>
Alternativejc_present = true<br>
The value of this flag is evaluated before the execution of procedure x.<br>
After step S106, the method continues with step S108, within which the DVD disk is further mounted physically by starting with scanning the lead-in area of the DVD disk. During this mounting step, the information comprised within the newly installed data is used as previously described. For example, in the case that the newly installed data comprises a specification of calculating the physical block numbering (PBN) for the DVD, the PBN is now calculated using this specification.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates an embodiment of the method according to the invention for a high level physical plug-in. A high level physical plug-in has for example an effect upon the logical block numbering<br>
Within the first step S200, the DVD disk is mounted physically.<br>
Within the next step S202, the driver code scans the Table of Contents (TOC) in the lead-in area of the disk for a POINT value. The POINT value identifies where the following address points to. For instance, for DVD, the "Content Provider information" area in the "Control data block" located in the "Control data zone" of the Lead-in can be used This POINT value indicates if a plug-in is present by pointing to the PBN of the start of the plug-in data. To indicate that a plug-in is present also other mechanisms can be used like using the value of the PBN, etc. If the POINT value is found in the TOC, the method continues with step S204. If the POINT value is not found in the TOC, the method continues with step S206.<br><br>
Within step S204, the driver codejumps to the PBN read from the TOC and reads the plug-in data. Further, the plug-in data is loaded into memory<br>
Within the next step S206, the disk is further mounted logically. During this mounting process the information comprised within the newly installed plug-in is used. For example, in the case that the newly installed plug-in comprises a specification of translating the physical address into the logical address for the DVD, the logical address is now calculated using this specification.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates an embodiment of the method according to the invention for a logical mount process. Within the first step S300, a DVD disk is first mounted physically.<br>
Within the next step S302, the logical mount process is started. The driver code checks for the presence of a value indicating a plug-in. The value can for example be a pointer to the position of the plug-in on the disk. If the plug-in is found, the method continues with step S304. If the plug-in is not found, the method continues with step S306.<br>
Within step S304, the plug-in is installed as previously described and the method continues with step S306.<br>
Within step S306, digital rights management and defect management, if applicable, is applied before mounting the file system of the disk.<br>
Now, for example, if the plug-in contains a programmable hardware specification for a video decoder required for the video content on the disk, the plug-in with the programmable hardware specification is used to read the video content on the disk A programmable hardware specification refers to hardware, for example a Field Programmable Gate Array, that can be programmed by providing the hardware a specification of how the hardware should be configured.<br>
In this case, control is not handed over to the plug-in. The plug-in describes how the programmable hardware that is responsible for the decoding process is configured. The rest of the system does not have to know that the decoder hardware has been optimized for the content on disc. During the mount procedure there is an instance where the firmware determines that a programmable hardware specification is present on disc and it uses this to program the hardware. Within the previous examples, other media disks like a Portable Blue (PB), CD, etc. can be used too.<br>
The plug-in travels with the disc. One of the advantages is that the user does not have to get the plug-in from somewhere else. The plug-in is delivered in an area of the disc that is not directly accessible to the host, i.e. not in the user data area. This has the<br><br>
advantage that you do not need to mount the disc completely before you can load the plug-in. As a result, the functionality delivered by the plug-in can be on a low level. For instance, if the plug-in is located in a geometrically fixed location, as previously described, the drive can load the plug-in before the format of the disc is interpreted. The installation of the plug-in occurs early in the mount process of the disc, transparent to the user. The plug-in is applied to the drive not the host. The plug-in takes care that the driver code knows how to interpret the disc and how the driver code should act given the format on the disc. The result of standard read/write commands from the host can thus be altered thereby changing the functionality of the host. The thus delivered plug-in is preferably only active while the disc carrying the plug-in is mounted. This has the advantage that a limited amount of memory can be used to support the plug-in.<br>
The plug-in could also be located in a Chip in Disk (CiD). In this case, before the disc itself is mounted the CiD is read and any plug-in found is loaded. The plug-in may specify the physical format and thus determine the physical mount process. It may specify the logical format and thus determine the logical mount process. It may determine application specific parameters. Or any combination of the three. Examples include location lead-in, lead-out, defect management type, sector lay-out, Digital Rights Management (DRM) hooks, hard links, codecs, transcoding parameters, etc...<br>
The plug-in can contain for example a specification of the application format on the disk. In this case, the plug-in contains computer readable program code to generate a user interface. The plug-in further, specifies the location of the user interface and the computer readable program code to interpret this information.<br>
As an other example, the plug-in can contain the requirement to enter an unlock code on the disk using a specific button sequence on the keypad of, for example, a mobile phone or a remote control. In this case, the plug-in specifies that some pre-processing, i.e. entering a code, is required before the disk may be played.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a DVD player in a schematic way. The DVD player 424 comprises random access memory (RAM)420, read only memory (ROM) 406 comprising the firmware, central processing unit (CPU) 402, software bus 408, driver 422, and system 410. The RAM 420, ROM 406, CPU 402, driver 422 and system 410 communicate with each other through software bus 408. The system 410 comprises a memory 412 that contains the computer readable code, so called driver code, to read and write data to and from driver 422, The driver 422 is designed to receive a DVD 414. The DVD comprises computer readable code 416 designed as a plug-in as previously described. The DVD also comprises computer<br><br>
readable code 418 designed as the content that should be read in by the driver code making use of the computer readable code 416 as previously described.<br>
The order in the described embodiments of the method of the current invention is not mandatory, a person skilled in the art may change the order of steps or perform steps concurrently using threading models, multi-processor systems or multiple processes without departing from the concept as intended by the current invention.<br>
It should be noted that the above-mentioned embodiments illustrate rather than limit the invention, and that those skilled in the art will be able to design many alternative embodiments without departing from the scope of the appended claims. In the claims, any reference signs placed between parentheses shall not be construed as limiting the claim. The word "comprising" does not exclude the presence of elements or steps other than those listed in a claim.
