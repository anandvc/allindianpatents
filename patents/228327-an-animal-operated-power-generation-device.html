				<td>The subject invention relates to an animal operated power generation device.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a device capable of converting the animal power into mechanical energy. The mechanical power thus generated can then be employed for various purposes including the agricultural purpose. Machines and devices are known to run at a speed not possible by animals or humans to match. The speed with which an animal moves depends on the animal power. This animal power can be translated into mechanical energy. The present invention provides a device for the conversion of the animal power to mechanical energy. The device of the present invention is capable of generating electricity at a voltage amenable for storage of energy in a battery. Accordingly present invention aims to provide a renewable source of energy, improve environment by preventing pollution and also provide an assured source of power supply even to small and marginal farmers.<br>
Energy and most of its forms finding use in the present day world are mainly non-renewable sources of energy. One such source is hydrocarbon fuel. Hydrocarbon fuels are of two types, solid type and liquid/gaseous type. Solid type fuels include coal, wood, briquettes and the like while the liquid/gaseous type fuels include petroleum and natural gases. While latter has limited availability, the former, though available in larger quantity, is not inexhaustible. Both are known to cause air pollution and affect environment adversely. It is therefore natural to explore renewable and non-polluting sources of energy. Animal power is one such source which is renewable and non-polluting and has been traditionally used.<br>
Land for cultivation is being progressively fragmented for obvious reasons. Farmers have small holdings which are not conducive to mechanized farming. Traditionally animals such as camels and bullocks were utilized for tilling the<br><br>
land for draft purposes and for performing other jobs. However, with the modern techniques, such as tractors and other means, being adapted by the farmers for tilling the land has resulted in the avoidance of use of animals for tilling purposes. Animals are accordingly not put to their maximum use. Farmers are therefore experiencing extra burden not only of the new machines, but also of feeding the animal without being able to put them to their optimum use. The present invention aims to provide a device which shall enable maximum utilization of animal power hence, to bring down the cost and to utilize the animal power, the device of the subject invention have been invented.<br>
Conventionally efforts have been made for such conversion of animal power to mechanical energy, however, the attempts have been unsuccessful. Generation of energy at 220Volts has been attempted in the past where bevel gear and pinion arrangements were used. Further more, to ensure steady voltage, use of heavy fly wheel has also been tried. The main drawback found in these arrangements is that in the absence of any means to store the energy, the power is available only for the period for which animal is moving. Heavy fly-wheel is more likely to cause injury to the animals if they stop abruptly. Moreover, the unit so designed is quite heavy and is very difficult to move the same when there is any need. Hence, to avoid the drawbacks as aforementioned, the subject power generation unit has been formulated.<br>
Moreover, the speed of the animals depend on the strength of the animal, which depends on the type of the animal and its age and agility. The subject machine is accordingly designed to have load adjustment mechanism to suit the strength and power of the animal. The use of flywheel have been avoided and use of a battery was envisioned which absorbs the effect of voltage fluctuations if any. Battery acts as a storage medium for storing energy and the device so designed is safe as the voltage stored is less than 30 volts.<br>
The subject power generation device comprises gear assembly and pinipns fixed on the base plate made up of steel having thickness of from 18-22mm. The gear assembly is placed on shafts. There are preferably 5 shafts and 8 gear assemblies.<br>
The shafts used in the subject device are of various dimensions and specifications depending upon the gears. One shaft is fixed on its one end with the holding means which in turn is fixed to the rotating means and on the other end with the base plate having length of about 440-470mm. The main gear assembly is fixed on this shaft having the diameter of from 325-335 mm.<br>
Accordingly, the subject invention relates to an animal operated power generation device comprising a base plate and a plurality of gear assemblies, comprising gears mounted on shafts, wherein one end of the first shaft of the first gear assembly is connected to a lever by connecting means, wherein<br>
1st gear assembly comprises a gear mounted on freely rotatable shaft having its one end rigidly fixed to the lever mechanism and the other end of the said shaft is housed in a housing having bearings provided in the said base plate<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
An animal operated power generation device of the subject invention comprises a base plate and at least five gear assemblies, comprising gears and shafts, wherein one end of the first shaft of the first gear assembly is connected to a lever to enable the animal such as bullock, camel and the like animals, to move rotatably and the other end of the said first shaft is fixed in the housing having bearings of the said base plate.<br>
The first gear assembly having a gear (1) of diameter of from 330-335mm, rigidly fixed on first shaft(2), is fitted in the bearing placed in the housing of the said base plate (3). Similarly a second gear assembly is also having a shaft (4) and a gear (5) of diameter of from 80-82mm, where the teeth of the said gear (5) conform with the teeth of the said gear (1) enabling the gear (5) to move at a speed 4-5 times greater then the speed of the gear (1). A gear<br>
(6)	having a diameter of 300-305 mm is rigidly fixed on the lower end of the<br>
shaft (4) of said second gear assembly, below the said base plate.<br>
Third gear assembly is also having a shaft (7) and a gear (8) of diameter of from 61-64mm on the lower end of the said shaft (7), where the teeth of the said gear (8) conform to the teeth of the gear (6) enabling the gear (8) to move at a speed 5-6 times greater then the speed of the gear (6). A gear (9) having a diameter of 225-230 mm is rigidly fixed on the upper end of the shaft<br>
(7)	of said third gear assembly.<br>
A fourth gear assembly is also having a shaft (10) and a gear (11) of diameter of from 65-70, where the teeth of the gear (11) conform with the teeth of the gear (9) enabling the gear (11) to move at a speed 3.5-4.5 times greater then the speed of the gear (9). The gear (12) having diameter of from 180-200mm is rigidly fixed on the lower end of the shaft (10) of said 4th gear assembly.<br>
The fifth gear assembly also having a shaft (13) and a gear (14) on the lower end of the shaft (13), where the teeth of the gear (14) conform with the teeth of the gear (12) enabling the gear (14) to move at a speed 3-4 times greater then the speed of the gear (12). The diameter of the gear (14) is from 50-70mm. A power generation device (15) is mounted on the upper end of the shaft (13) of the fifth gear assembly.<br>
The rotational speed of the said power generation device is 700- 950 RPM. When the animal takes the rotational movement, the shaft (2) which' is connected on its one end with a lever and on its other end in the hosing of the base plate also moves rotationally, causing the gear (1) to rotate. The teeth of the gear (1) conform with the teeth of gear (5), thus enabling the gear (5) to rotate 4-5 times greater then the speed of the gear (1) along with moving the shaft (4) resulting in the rotation of the gear (6), which is fixed on the lower end of the said shaft (4). Similar arrangement causes the rotational movement of gears 8, 9 11, 12 and 14 wherein the gear ratio of the said device is as disclosed in the table 1.(Table Removed) The rotational speed of the said power generation device is from 700-950 RPM whereas the first gear starts rotating at the speed of 3-4 RPM. Thus the animal power is converted to mechanical energy where the conversion is more than 80%.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
