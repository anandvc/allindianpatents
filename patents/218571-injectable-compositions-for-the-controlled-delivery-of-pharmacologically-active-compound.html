				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>(0001] The present invention relates to methods and compositions for extending<br>
the release times and decreasing the toxicity of pharmacologically active compounds.<br>
[0002] The following discussion of the background of the invention is merely<br>
provided to aid the reader in understanding the invention and is not admitted to describe<br>
or constitute prior art to the present invention.<br>
[0003] It is often desirable to extend the release time of an injected drug to<br>
increase its duration of action, or to reduce its toxic effects. Formulations that are readily<br>
soluble in the body are usually absorbed rapidly and provide a sudden burst of available<br>
drug as opposed to a more desirable and gradual release of the pharmacologically active<br>
product. A variety of attempts have been made to provide controlled and extended<br>
release pharmaceutical compounds, but have not succeeded in overcoming all of the<br>
problems associated the technology, such as achieving an extended release time,<br>
maximum stability and efficacy, reduced toxicity, maximum reproducibility in<br>
preparation, and the elimination of unwanted physical, biochemical, or toxicological<br>
effects introduced by undesirable matrix materials.<br>
[0004] Oxytetracycline is a widely used and useful antibiotic for treating various<br>
infections in mammals. In particular it is used for treating and preventing respiratory<br>
infections in domestic animals. There are significant costs associated with repeated<br>
administrations through conventional means.<br>
[0005J Tilmicosin is a macrolide antibiotic with two tertiary amines. It has a<br>
long tissue half-life and is effective against a broad range of bacteria and is used to treat<br>
respiratory diseases in cattle. At elevated levels tilmicosin is cardiotoxic and its use in<br>
sensitive species such as cats, goats, pigs and horses has been avoided almost entirely<br>
due to safety reasons. The commercial product, MicotilÂ® (Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Indianapolis,<br>
IN), is a solution of the di-phosphate salt and is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,574,020.<br>
This formulation is effective in cattle, but the antibiotic is released rapidly and results in<br>
toxicity in many species, including dogs and cats.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0006] Application Serial No. 60/343,625, filed October 19,2001 is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety, including all charts and drawings.<br>
[0007] The present invention provides compositions and methods for extending<br>
the release times and lowering the toxicity of pharmacologically active compounds. The<br>
compounds comprise a salt of the pharmacologically active compound with a iipophilic<br>
counterfoil and a pharmaceutically acceptable water soluble solvent combined together to<br>
form an injectable composition. The lipophilic counterion may be a saturated or<br>
unsaturated C8-C22 fatty acid, and preferably may be a saturated or unsaturated C10-C18<br>
fatty acid. When injected into a mammal, at least a portion of the composition<br>
precipitates and releases the active compound over time. Thus, the composition forms a<br>
slowly releasing drug depot of the active compound in the mammal. Therefore, the<br>
present invention enables one to provide a controlled dose administration of the active<br>
compound for a periods of up to 15 days or even longer. In preferred embodiments, the<br>
pharmacologically active compound may be tilmicosin, an antibiotic such as<br>
oxytetracyclinc or doxycycline, or fluoxetine, roxithromycin, turbinafine, or metoprolol,<br>
and the lipophilic counterion may be decanoic acid, lauric acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid,<br>
or myristic acid. In preferred embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable solvent is<br>
N-mcthyl pyrrolidone (NMP). In another embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
solvent is propylene glycol (e.g., at about 10%) in glycerol formal, with or without<br>
stabilizers.<br>
[0008] The present invention also provides novel methods of administering<br>
compositions and formulations of the present invention to mammals. The methods<br>
provide compositions of active compounds that, if presented in presently available forms,<br>
may result in toxicity to the treated mammal. Thus, the formulations and methods of the<br>
present invention enable one to administer compounds that previously have not been able<br>
to be widely used in particular species due to safety considerations. The methods also<br>
enable one to extend the release times of compounds and provide a controlled dose of<br>
active compound to the treated patient. The methods of the present invention enable one<br>
to administer the pharmacologically active compound to the treated mammal in a<br>
pharmaceutically effective amount for 4-15 days, including any specific number of days<br>
up to and including 15 days, or even more. The precise time will depend on several<br>
variables that may be manipulated to optimize the present invention for a particular<br>
pharmacologically active compound or application. Preferably the compound is present<br>
in the treated tissue 4-5 days after injection; and more preferably the compound is<br>
present in the treated tissue in a pharmaceutically effective amount 6 days, or even 7<br>
days after injection. In other embodiments, it may also be desirable to manipulate<br>
variables so as to extend release times even further than 15 days.<br>
[0009] In one aspect, the present invention provides compositions for<br>
administration of pharmacologically active compounds. The compositions may<br>
comprise a salt of the pharmacologically active compound with a lipophilic counterion<br>
and a pharmaceutically acceptable water soluble solvent, combined together under<br>
conditions to form an injectable composition. The composition may precipitate and<br>
release the pharmacologically active compound over time when injected into the<br>
mammal. In various embodiments, the composition of the present invention may<br>
comprise a wide variety of pharmacologically active compounds such as lilmicosin,<br>
oxytetracycline, doxycycline, metoprolol, sulfamethazine, trimethoprim, neomycin,<br>
streptomycin, gentamycin, dibucaine, bupivacaine, benzocaine, tetracaine, acepromazine,<br>
itraconazole, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, aminoglycosides, or any pharmacologically<br>
active compound with appropriate solubility and chemical functionalities. The lipophilic<br>
counterion may be a saturated or unsaturated fatty acid of any specific number of carbons<br>
between 8 and 22, preferably a C8-C18 fatty acid, and more preferably a C10-C18 fatty<br>
acid, such as lauric acid, linoleic acid, decanoic acid, and myristic acid. Other lipophilic<br>
counterions may also be used, for example dicarboxylic acids, such as sebacic acid,<br>
polymeric acids, such as lipophilic poly-carboxylic acids, and aromatic acids, such as<br>
benzoic acid. The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier may be an organic solvent. In<br>
preferred embodiments, the solvent may be pyrrolidone, N-methyl pyrrolidone,<br>
polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol formal, isosorbid dimethyl ether, ethanol,<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, triacetin, or any combination of these, or<br>
another solvent found to have similar acceptable properties such as being non-toxic and<br>
soluble in water.<br>
[0010] In another embodiment the compositions of the invention are a salt of a<br>
pharmacologically active compound with a polycarboxylic acid counterion and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable water soluble solvent, combined together under conditions<br>
to form an injectable composition that precipitates when injected into water at room<br>
temperature or precipitates in physiological ("in vivo") environments. The composition<br>
releases the active compound over time when injected into a mammal. By<br>
"polycarboxylic acid" is meant a molecule containing at least two carboxyl groups. In<br>
preferred embodiments the polycarboxylic acid is polyaspartic acid, polyacrylic acid,<br>
sebacic acid, polysebacic acid, polybenzoic acid, or combinations thereof. By "poly" is<br>
meant two or more.<br>
[0011] In one embodiment, the pharmacologically active compound may be<br>
oxytetracycline, the lipophilic counterion may be lauric acid, and the pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable solvent may be propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, glycerol formal, or an<br>
appropriate combination of these. In another embodiment the pharmacologically active<br>
compound may be tilmicosin, the lipophilic counterion may be lauric acid, and the<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable solvent may be propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol,<br>
glycerol formal, or an appropriate combination of these. In still another embodiment, the<br>
compositions may precipitate and release the active compound over time when<br>
introduced or injected into an aqueous environment. The compositions may also form a<br>
drug depot in the mammal when injected, which releases the compound over time.<br>
[0012] In another aspect, the present invention provides methods of<br>
administering a pharmacologically active compound to a mammal. The methods may<br>
comprise preparing a composition of a salt of the pharmacologically active compound<br>
with a lipophilic counterion, and a pharmaceutically acceptable water soluble solvent,<br>
combined together under conditions to form an injectable formulation, and injecting the<br>
composition into the mammal. At least a portion of the composition precipitates and<br>
releases the pharmacologically active compound over time when injected into the<br>
mammal.<br>
[0013] In another aspect, the present invention provides methods of extending the<br>
release time of a pharmacologically active compound administered to a mammal. The<br>
methods may comprise preparing a formulation of a salt of the pharmacologically active<br>
compound with a lipophilic counterion, and a pharmaceutically acceptable water soluble<br>
solvent, combined together under conditions to form an injectable formulation, and<br>
injecting the composition into the mammal, at least a portion of the composition<br>
precipitating and releasing the pharmacologically active compound over time after<br>
injection into the mammal, thereby extending the release time of the compound. The<br>
invention may therefore provide a controlled dosage of active compound to the treated<br>
mammal.<br>
[0014] In yet another aspect, the present invention provides methods of<br>
manufacturing an injectable formulation for the administration of a pharmacologically<br>
active compound to a mammal. The methods may comprise forming a salt of the<br>
pharmacologically active compound with a lipophilic counterion, providing water<br>
soluble pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, combining the salt and the solvent under<br>
conditions to form an injectable formulation, wherein at least a portion of the<br>
formulation precipitates and releases the pharmacologically active compound over time<br>
when injected into the mammal.<br>
[0015] In another aspect the present invention provides compositions for the<br>
administration of a pharmacologically active compound to a mammal. The compositions<br>
contain a salt of the pharmacologically active compound with a lipophilic counterion and<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, combined together to form an injectable<br>
composition. At least a portion of the pharmaceutically active compound with lipophilic<br>
counterion dissolved in the solvent precipitates in vivo and releases the active compound<br>
over time when injected into the mammal.<br>
[0016] The present invention therefore offers important advantages over<br>
formulations previously available. The present invention allows for the controlled<br>
release of pharmacologically active compounds to reduce toxicity, particularly in small<br>
animals such as dogs and cats. It also offers the advantage of being able to administer<br>
compounds to domestic animals in an efficient manner, thereby requiring a smaller<br>
investment in time and resources than is available with previous modes of drug<br>
administration. The pharmacologically active compound is available in a stable,<br>
injectable, formulation that precipitates when injected and slowly releases the active<br>
compound over an extended period of time.<br>
[0017] The summary of the invention described above is not limiting and other<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0018] The compositions of the present invention may be prepared using salts of<br>
pharmacologically active compounds with basic functionalities. These can be made<br>
using a variety of lipophilic acids, saturated or unsaturated fatty acids, cholic acids,<br>
phosphatidic acids, dicarboxylic acids such as sebacic acid or any acid that, when<br>
combined with the pharmacologically active compound, renders the resulting salt<br>
insoluble in water, but soluble in a water soluble solvent. By "salt" is meant two<br>
compounds that are not covalently linked but are chemically bound through ionic<br>
attractions. By "water miscible" is meant that the solvent is capable of mixing in any<br>
ratio in water without separation of two phases. By "water soluble" is meant that the<br>
solvent has some significant level of solubility in aqueous solutions, e.g., triacetin is<br>
considered a water soluble solvent since it is soluble in water at a ratio of about 1:14. By<br>
a "lipophilic counterion" is meant an ionic form of a fat soluble molecule. The lipophilic<br>
counterion may preferably be a fatty acid, but may also be another fat soluble molecule.<br>
The counterion has at least one charge opposite to that of a chemical group on an<br>
opposing salt member, thereby causing an ionic attraction between the two molecules.<br>
By "injectable formulation" or "injectable composition" is meant a formulation or<br>
composition that can be drawin into a syringe and injected subcutaneously,<br>
intraperitoneally, or intra-muscularly into a mammal without causing adverse effects due<br>
to the presence of solid materials in the composition. Solid materials include, but are not<br>
limited to, crystals, a gummy mass, and a gel. By "pharmacologically active compound"<br>
is meant a chemical compound that causes a pharmacological effect in the treated<br>
mammal. For example, the effect may be to destroy or prevent growth of bacteria or<br>
parasites, reduce inflammation, or another pharmaceutical and measurable effect in the<br>
treated mammal.<br>
[0019] By the verb "precipitate" is meant that the compound forms a precipitate,<br>
or solid. A precipitate is an insoluble solid formed in solution at room temperature in<br>
vitro or in a physiological (in vivo) environment. The precipitate can take many forms<br>
such as, for example, a solid, a crystal, a gummy mass, or a gel. By "pharmaceutically<br>
effective amount" is meant an amount that exerts a measurable and medically significant<br>
effect on the treated mammal, resulting in progress towards curing or preventing the<br>
subject disease, or alleviating or preventing the condition that was the reason for<br>
treatment. A "pharmaceutically acceptable solvent" is a liquid that dissolves a salt of the<br>
pharmacologically active compound and a lipophilic counterion, and that is suitable for<br>
use with humans and/or animals without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity,<br>
irritation, and allergic response) commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.<br>
[0020] The compositions of the present invention offer several advantages. The<br>
compositions are injectable compositions that contain high concentrations of the active<br>
compound. In preferred embodiments, the pharmacologically active compound may be<br>
loaded into the composition in the range of 10%-60% (w/v). But the person of ordinary<br>
skill in the art will realize this range may be varied widely, depending on the solubility or<br>
insolubility of the pharmacologically active compound, the lipophilic counterion<br>
selected, the solvent selected, the injectability of the final product, and any other relevant<br>
needs of the particular application. Active compound may also be loaded as low as 10%,<br>
or 5%, or even 1% and still provide a useful effect. Similarly, active compound may be<br>
loaded at 70%, or even higher as needs require. No exotic excipients or carriers are<br>
required. The compositions are easily filtered, thereby simplifying the manufacturing<br>
process. It is believed that the exclusion of water from the formulation should impart<br>
greater stability to the formulations, and inhibit the growth of microorganisms. The<br>
processes for preparing the compositions, as described herein, are simple, and<br>
administration according to the present invention should result in milder reactions at the<br>
injection site due to the neutralization of the pharmacologically active compound.<br>
[0021] The present invention provides the ability to modulate the release rate and<br>
release time of the pharmacologically active compound. The release rate may be<br>
modulated by varying the lipophilicity and molecular weight of the counter-ion used to<br>
make the salt. For example, lauric acid salts of tilmicosin are usually released more<br>
slowly than decanoate salts. In addition, higher concentrations of the salt in the<br>
formulation usually yield slower release rates. The decanoate salt of tilmicosin is<br>
released more slowly from a 60% tilmicosin-fatty acid salt formulation that from a 30%<br>
tilmicosin-fatty acid salt formulation. Similarly, as explained herein, other variables<br>
such as selection of lipophilic counterion, solvent selection, salt concentration, and<br>
others may be manipulated to lengthen or shorten the release time of the active<br>
compound to the desired point. Generally, it may be desirable for salts to be based on<br>
the molar ratio of charged groups. But one may also successfully create insoluble salts<br>
by utilizing a hemi-salt or by otherwise varying from a 1:1 ratio. The pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable solvent may be a water miscible or water soluble solvent, and preferably may<br>
be a water miscible solvent. Mixtures of water soluble and/or water miscible solvents<br>
may also be utilized. The person of ordinary skill in the art will realize that various<br>
water soluble solvents may be mixed to optimize the result for a particular application.<br>
For example, a mixture of polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and glycerol formal<br>
may be mixed in various ratios to provide an optimal solvent. In some embodiments,<br>
mixing in approximately even amounts may provide a suitable solvent.<br>
[0022] In other embodiments, formulations of the invention containing a salt of<br>
the pharmacologically active compound with a lipophilic counterion can be combined<br>
with the unsalted form of the active, in order to provide a greater initial dose of active<br>
compound.<br>
[0023] Without wanting to be bound by any particular theory, injectable<br>
compositions may be obtained when a salt is formed of a pharmacologically active agent<br>
with a lipophilic counterion, and combined with a parenteral organic solvent. It is<br>
believed that when this formulation is injected into a mammal, the solvent may diffuse<br>
away from the injection site as aqueous body fluids diffuse towards the site, resulting in<br>
the precipitation of the pharmacologically active compound in the treated mammal. The<br>
precipitate may take many forms, for example, a solid, crystals, a gummy mass, or a gel.<br>
There will thus exist a concentration of the active compound that is released in a<br>
pharmaceutically effective amount over a desired period of time. The precipitate may act<br>
as a drug depot in the mammal resulting in the release of the compound over a period of<br>
time. Release times may be obtained of at least 3 days, at least 4 days, at least 5 days, at<br>
least 6 days at least 7 days, or any specific number of days up to and including at least 15<br>
days, or even longer, as desired. By "drug depot" is meant a concentration or<br>
precipitation of pharmacologically active compound within the body of the treated<br>
mammal that releases a pharmaceutically effective amount of the active compound over<br>
time.<br>
[0024] It was shown that the fatty acid chain length, the particular combinations<br>
of fatty acids, the percent pharmacologically active compound:lipophilic counterion salt<br>
in the formulation, and the pharmaceutically acceptable solvent selected all influence the<br>
release kinetics of the pharmacologically active compound. Thus, the release kinetics of<br>
the pharmacologically active compound may be conveniently and easily managed by<br>
manipulating these and other variables. It was also found that the formulations were<br>
stable to being sterilized by autoclave. The person of ordinary skill in the art will realize<br>
that the present invention may be applied to many pharmacologically active compounds<br>
that have an appropriate solubility and chemical functionality. Thus, it is contemplated<br>
that the present invention may be applicable to a wide variety of pharmacologically<br>
active compounds, such as drugs, medications, nutrients, or other desirable compounds<br>
for administration to a mammal.<br>
[0025] The person of ordinary skill in the art will realize that some modifications<br>
to the methods presented herein may be desirable based on the particular characteristics<br>
of the pharmacologically active compound involved. The following non-limiting<br>
examples present further applications of the present invention and are provided by way<br>
of example only.<br>
[0026] Oxytetracycline has one tertiary amine group, and the hydrochloride salt<br>
of oxytetracycline is readily soluble in water. We have found that adding one mole of<br>
fatty acids to one mole of oxytetracycline creates a salt that has lower solubility in water<br>
but is more soluble than the starting oxytetracycline in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP).<br>
When water is added to the NMP formulation, the salt precipitates.<br>
[0027] The in vitro rate of release of oxytetracycline may be determined by<br>
sealing the formulation in a dialysis bag (Pierce, Rockford, IL), placing it in a reservoir<br>
of saline solution, and measuring the amount of drug in the saline as a function of time.<br>
The formulation of the present invention was compared with existing oxytetracycline<br>
formulations. Fig. 1 shows that the oxytetracycline formulation of the present invention<br>
is released into the saline at a rate substantially slower than that of the free drug.<br>
[0028] An oxytetracycline composition according to the present invention was<br>
prepared by adding 0.464 grams of oxytetracycline and 0.203 grams of lauric acid to 3<br>
ml of NMP. The mixture was stirred for 60 minutes, resulting in a clear solution. 1 ml<br>
of this solution was sealed in a dialysis bag, and the bag was suspended in 150 ml of<br>
phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Aliquots were removed at various intervals and<br>
oxytetracycline concentration was determined by spectrophotometry. The results in<br>
Figure 1 show that oxytetracycline continued to diffuse out of the bag for wore than 120<br>
hours, at which point only about 50% of the oxytetracycline present had been released.<br>
Example 2: Metoprolol<br>
(0029] Metoprolol is an antihypertensive, antianginal and antiarrhythmic drug, of<br>
the following structure:<br>
[0030] Its succinate and tartarate salts are available commercially under several<br>
trade names. Both these salts as well as the base form of the drug are highly soluble in<br>
water. The base form of the metoprolol was prepared from commercially available<br>
tartarate salt by standard procedure. When the amine group of metoprolol is neutralized<br>
with lauric acid, the resulting salt is poorly soluble in water, but readily soluble in<br>
pharmaceutically-acceptablc non-aqueous solvents. A metoprolol composition<br>
according to the present invention were prepared by adding 0.3224 grams of metoprolol<br>
base and 0.2661 grams of lauric acid to 2.415 ml of NMP. The mixture was stirred for<br>
30 minutes, resulting in a clear solution. One ml of this solution was sealed in a dialysis<br>
bag, and the bag was suspended in 150 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4.<br>
Aliquots were removed at various intervals and metoprolol concentration was<br>
determined by spectrophotometry. The results in Figure 2 show that metoprolol<br>
continued to diffuse out of the bag for more than 48 hours while the control solution of<br>
metoprolol base (prepared by dissolving 150 mg in 1.124 ml of NMP) is diffused off<br>
rapidly.<br>
Example 2A: Tilmicosin<br>
[0031] Tilmicosin is an antibiotic in the macrolide class with the following<br>
structure:<br>
[0032] It is effective against a broad range of bacteria, and is used for the<br>
treatment of respiratory diseases in cattle. The basic form is moderately soluble in<br>
aqueous solutions, while the chloride and phosphate salts are highly soluble. At elevated<br>
levels, tilmicosin is cardiotoxic, and therefore is not administered intravenously. For<br>
safety reasons, its use has been avoided almost entirely in sensitive species such as cats,<br>
goats, pigs, and horses.<br>
[0033] When the two amine groups of tilmicosin are neutralized with any of<br>
several fatty acids (such as, for example, decanoic C10, lauric C12, myristic C14, palmitic<br>
C16, stearic C18, Oleic C10, elaidic C18, linoleic C18, and erucic C22), the resulting salt is<br>
poorly soluble in water, but readily soluble in pharmaceutically-acceptable non-aqueous<br>
solvents. When the formulation of the salt is sealed in a dialysis cassette and place in<br>
saline, the tilmicosin salt precipitates, and tilmicosin is slowly released from the bag.<br>
The rate of release is a function of the chain length of the fatty acid (Fig. 3), the solvent<br>
(Fig. 4) and the tilmicosin-fatty acid salt concentration (Fig. 5).<br>
Example 3 - Tilmicosin salts in vitro<br>
[0034] 10 grams (0.0115 moles) of tilmicosin and 0.0253 moles of various<br>
carboxylic acids (such as, for example, decanoic, lauric, linoleic, or myristic acids, in<br>
individual assays) were taken in a flask and made up to a final volume of 100 ml with N-<br>
methyl-pyrrolidone and stirred for 60 minutes to obtain a clear solution. One ml aliquots<br>
of these solutions were sealed in dialysis bags, and the bags were suspended in flasks<br>
containing 150 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The salt was observed to<br>
precipitate in the bag within about 1 hour. Aliquots of saline were removed at various<br>
intervals and tilmicosin was determined by HPLC. The results with decanoic acid (C-<br>
10) and lauric acid (C-12) salts in Figure 3 show that tilmicosin continued to diffuse out<br>
of the bag for more than 120 hours. Longer chain length acids caused a slower release of<br>
tilmicosin. MicotilÂ® (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN), a phosphate salt of tilmicosin, is<br>
readily soluble and rapidly diffuses from the bag.<br>
Example 4 - Tilmicosin-di(decanoic acid) in various solvents<br>
[0035] Solutions of tilmicosin di(decanoic acid) salt were prepared in several<br>
water-miscible solvents, combining 10 grams (0.0115 moles) of tilmicosin and 0.0253<br>
moles of decanoic acid in various solvents to a final volume of 100 ml. The in vitro<br>
release rates were measured using the dialysis method of Example 1. The results in<br>
Figure 4 show that the release rate varies with the solvent, but that all of the solvents<br>
yield a slower release rate than that observed with the phosphate salt (Micotil (R)) shown<br>
in Figure 3.<br>
" Example 5 - Tiimicosin release concentration effect<br>
[0036] Solutions of tiimicosin di(decanoic acid) salt were prepared by combining<br>
30 grams (0.0345 moles) or 60 grams (0.0690 moles) of tiimicosin with 2 equivalents of<br>
decanoic acid in NMP to a final volume of 100 ml. The in vitro release rates were<br>
measured using the dialysis method of Example 1, and the data in Figure 5 show that<br>
higher starting concentrations result in a slower release rate.<br>
Example 6 - Tiimicosin in vivo<br>
[0037] Formulations of tiimicosin didecanoate, dilaurate, and dimynstate were<br>
formulated at 100 mg/ml in N-methyl pyrrolidone and subcutaneously injected into cats<br>
in the back of the neck at a dosage of 45 or 75 mg/kg of body weight. Previous data<br>
indicates that a dosage of 25 mg/kg of the phosphate salt of tiimicosin is fatal to cats.<br>
The cats showed hypothermia and lethargy after injection, indicative of the<br>
bioavailability of the drug. The toxicity was found to be substantially less in<br>
formulations with fatty acid chain lengths greater than C10, consistent with the slower<br>
release of drug from these formulations. All of the cats survived and were behaving<br>
normally 3 days after the injection. The results are summarized in the following Table 1.<br>
Table 1: Blood levels of Tiimicosin at Specific Time Intervals<br>
(0038) 100 mg/ml of a formulation of a salt of tiimicosin with decanoic acid,<br>
lauric acid, or myristic acid in N-methyl pyrrolidone were injected into 9 healthy adult<br>
cats at the dosages indicated. The resulting concentrations in blood cells and plasma for<br>
each individual cat at 6 hours and 2 days are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0039] Tilmicosin salts were also studied in tissue. A tilmicosin:dilauric fatty<br>
acid salt in 10% propylene glycol in glycerol formal at 100 mg/ml was administered<br>
subcutaneously at 10 mg/kg dose and the biodistribution in cats was determined.<br>
[0040] The methods described here were developed for the determination and<br>
quantification of tilmicosin in various animal tissues and serum, particularly feline liver,<br>
kidney and lung tissue and serum. The person of ordinary skill in the art will realize that<br>
many variations of the methods described here are possible without departing from the<br>
invention.<br>
[0041] The kidney, liver and lung tissue samples were collected 2, 3, 4, 7, 14,<br>
and 21 days after injecting the animals with tilmicosin formulation at 10 mg/kg of body<br>
weight. The results are presented in Figures 8, 9 &amp; 10. It was found that kidney is the<br>
marker tissue in cats while the liver is the marker in cows and pigs. The levels in kidney<br>
were consistently higher than in liver with Crnax (kidney: 13.8 meg/gm; Liver: 7.3<br>
mcg/gm) reached around 48 hours in both tissues. The Cmax for lung was found to be<br>
7.5 mcg/gm and was observed around 48 hours after injecting the dose. Detectable<br>
levels of tilmicosin persisted in tissues through day 21 of the study.<br>
[0042] A drug extraction efficiency of-98% was obtained at a concentration of 1<br>
mcg/gm of tissue. The limit of detection for tilmicosin in various feline tissues was<br>
determined to be 0.032 mcg/gm. For feline serum, a drug extraction efficiency of 95%<br>
was obtained over a concentration range of 0.15 to 6 mcg/ml after fortification. The<br>
limit of detection was determined to be 0.16 mcg/ml with linearity extending from 0.15<br>
to 6 mcg/ml.<br>
Preparation of Tissue Samples<br>
[0043] Tissue samples were prepared by mincing with scissors or a scalpel on a<br>
paper towel. 10 ml of methanol was added to each tube and the samples homogenized<br>
separately for 10 to 15 minutes. Samples were sonicated on ice for one minute and<br>
centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4 C. The methanol extract was decanted into<br>
fresh centrifuge tubes and the tissue samples resuspend in the tubes with 10 mL of<br>
methanol and 5.0 mL of 100 mM phosphate. The tubes were vortexed and centrifuged at<br>
10,000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4 C. The extract was decanted into fresh centrifuge tubes<br>
and centrifuged at 5000 rpms for 10 minute at 4 C. The methanol extract was added to<br>
70 mL of water in a flask and swirled in the flask to mix.<br>
[0044] Each pool of extracts was loaded to a solid phase extraction C18 Sep-Pak<br>
PlusÂ® (SPE) cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA) using a vacuum manifold or hydrostatic<br>
pump to draw the pools through the cartridges. Once sample were completely loaded,<br>
each SPE cartridge was washed with 10 mL of water, and then with 10 mL of 25%<br>
acetonitrile / water at a flow rate of less than 5 mL / minute. The SPE cartridges were<br>
disconnected from the apparatus and dried completely under high vacuum (26 in. Hg) in<br>
a vacuum desiccation jar for 10 minutes.<br>
[0045] Analyte was eluted from the SPE cartridges with 5% acetic<br>
acid/methanol. Only the first 2.0 mL of eluate was collected. The volumetric flasks<br>
were inverted and mixed, and stored overnight at 4 C.<br>
[0046] The sample eluates were filtered through a 0.22 urn PVDF filter, and<br>
analyzed by HPLC on a SphereCloneÂ® 5 um phenyl column (Phenomenex, Torrance,<br>
CA).<br>
[0047] Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and is extensively<br>
used to treat psychological disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder in humans.<br>
It is shown that fluoxetine is effective for treating aggressive behavior and separation<br>
anxiety in dogs and urine spraying behavior in cats. Fluoxetine is formulated at 100 and<br>
150 mg/ml as a lauric acid salt in 10% propylene glycol in glycerol formal in 1:1 drug to<br>
fatty acid ratio. In vitro release kinetics were studied for both formulations at 100<br>
mg/mL concentration using the dialysis technique described in Example 1, and the<br>
results presented in Fig 6. Fluoxetine base in 10% propylene glycol in glycerol formal<br>
at 100 mg/ml is used as a control in the experiment. While the fluoxetine base<br>
formulation is released for about 160 hrs, the 1:1 (drug:LA) lauric acid salt formulation<br>
was released for 700 hrs.<br>
[0048] The fatty acid salt formulation with 1:1.1 fluoxetine to lauric acid ratio at<br>
150 mg/mL concentration was injected sub cutaneous into cats at 20 and 30 mg/kg. At<br>
the same time two cats were dosed at 1 mg/kg/day orally for 28 days. Serum samples<br>
were collected through day 42 and analyzed for fluoxetine by HPLC using 35%<br>
acetonitrile in phosphate buffer, pH 2.7 on a C18 column. The results suggest that a<br>
single sub cutaneous injection of fatty acid salt formulation provide drug concentrations<br>
comparable to daily oral dose through 42 days (Fig. 7).<br>
[0049] The fluoxetine was also formulated as linoleic acid salt in 10% propylene<br>
glycol in glycerol formal, yielding a clear solution. This formulation was also found to<br>
precipitate in water.<br>
Example 8 - Roxithromycin:<br>
[0050] Roxithromycin is an antibiotic in the macrolide class with the following<br>
structure:<br>
[0051] It is effective against a broad range of bacteria, and is used for the<br>
treatment of respiratory diseases in cattle. The amine group of roxithromycin was<br>
neutralized with linoleic acid in 10% propylene in glycerol formal, resulting in a clear<br>
solution at 200 mg/ml. As in the case of tilmicosin, the salt precipitated when the<br>
solution was spiked in water.<br>
Example 9 - Turbinafine<br>
[0052] Turbinafine is an antifungal and the structure is as shown below:<br>
[0053] Turbinafine is a specific inhibitor of squaline epoxidase, ? key enzyme in<br>
fungal ergosterol biosynthesis. The amine group of turbinafine was neutralized with<br>
linoleic acid in 10% propylene glycol in glycerol formal, resulting in a clear solution at<br>
150 mg/ml. The resulting salt was highly insoluble in water, and precipitated when<br>
spiked into water.<br>

fatty acid, and preferably may be a saturated or unsaturated<br>
C10 - C18 fatty acid. When injected into a mammal, at least a<br>
portion of the composition precipitates and releases the active<br>
compound over time. Thus, the composition forms a slowly releasing<br>
drug depot of the active compound in the mammal. Therefore, the<br>
present invention enables one to provide a controlled dose<br>
administration of the active compound for a periods of up to 15<br>
days or even longer. Many compounds can be administered according<br>
to the present invention including, but not limited to,<br>
tilmicosin, oxytetracycline, metoprolol, fluoxetine,<br>
roxithromycin, and turbinafine.</td>
