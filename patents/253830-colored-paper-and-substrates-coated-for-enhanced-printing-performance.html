DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0010]	The use of the terms "a" and "an" and "the" and similar referents in the<br>
context of describing the invention (especially in the context of the following claims) are<br>
to be construed to cover both the singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein<br>
or clearly contradicted by context. The terms "comprising," "having," "including," and<br>
"containing" are to be construed as open-ended terms (i.e., meaning "including, but not<br>
limited to,") unless otherwise noted. Recitation of ranges of values herein are merely<br>
intended to serve as a shorthand method of referring individually to each separate value<br>
falling within the range, unless otherwise indicated herein, and each separate value is<br>
incorporated into the specification as if it were individually recited herein. All methods<br>
described herein can be performed in any suitable order unless otherwise indicated herein<br>
or otherwise clearly contradicted by context. The use of any and all examples, or<br><br><br>
exemplary language (e.g., "such as") provided herein, is intended merely to better<br>
illuminate the invention and does not pose a limitation on the scope of the invention unless<br>
otherwise claimed. No language in the specification should be construed as indicating any<br>
nonclaimed element as essential to the practice of the invention.<br>
[0011]	Preferred embodiments of this invention are described herein, including the<br>
best mode known to the inventors for carrying out the invention. Variations of those<br>
preferred embodiments may become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon<br>
reading the foregoing description. The inventors expect skilled artisans to employ such<br>
variations as appropriate, and the inventors intend for the invention to be practiced<br>
otherwise than as specifically described herein. Accordingly, this invention includes all<br>
modifications and equivalents of the subject matter recited in the claims appended hereto<br>
as permitted by applicable law. Moreover, any combination of the above-described<br>
elements in all possible variations thereof is encompassed by the invention unless<br>
otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context.<br>
[0012]	In one aspect, the invention provides a substrate coated with a coating<br>
composition comprising silica. The silica may comprise at least one of fumed silica<br>
particles, precipitated silica particles, gel silica particles, and combinations thereof. The<br>
composition may further comprise a dispersing medium for the particles, such as water, a<br>
binder or a combination thereof. The composition may be used to coat a substrate to<br>
enhance the printing, such as ink jet printing, characteristics of the substrate.<br><br>
[0013]	Fumed silica particles, can be produced by pyrogenic processes and have<br>
the chemical composition SiO2. Fumed silica particles, typically, are aggregate particles of<br>
smaller primary particles, which are held together by relatively strong cohesive forces,<br>
such that the aggregate particles are not broken down into primary particles when<br>
dispersed in a liquid medium. Aggregate fumed silica particles may also form larger<br>
agglomerate particles, which are held together by relatively weak cohesive forces.<br>
Agglomerate particles may be broken down into aggregate particles when dispersed in a<br>
liquid medium. Suitable fumed silica particles for use in the present invention have an<br>
aggregate particle size of at least about 50, and more particularly, at least about 60, at least<br>
about 70, at least about 75, at least about 80, at least about 90 or at least about 95 nm. The<br>
aggregate particle size is generally less than about 400, and more particularly, less than<br>
about 350, less than about 300, less than about 275, less than about 250, less than about<br>
225, less than about 200, or less than about 190 nm.<br>
[0014]	The coating compositions may comprise fumed metal oxides, silica or<br>
dispersions comprising the same. Commercially available fumed silicas suitable for use in<br>
the invention include, but are not limited to, those sold under the trademark AERODISP®<br>
(Degussa). Suitably, the fumed metal oxide in the dispersion may be doped with a<br>
different fumed metal oxide, for example fumed silica doped with fumed alumina.<br>

1501-50, KLEBOSOL® 1508-50, KLEBOSOL® 1498-50. The coating compositions<br>
may comprise any of these metal oxides, dispersions comprising metal oxides or<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
[0017]	The surface area of most metal oxide particles can be determined by the<br>
method of S. Brunauer, P. H. Emmet, and I. Teller, J. Am. Chemical Society, 60, 309<br>
(1938), which is commonly referred to as the BET method. The fumed silica or fumed<br>
metal oxide particles suitable for use in the invention have a BET surface area of at least<br>
about 50, or at least about 70 m2/g, and less than about 400, less than about 350 or less<br>
than about 325 m2/g. In some embodiments, the fumed silica particles have a BET surface<br>
area of about 90 m2/g, about 200 m2/g or about 300 m2/g.<br>
[0018]	Gel silica and precipitated silica are formed by "wet chemistry" processes.<br>
Like fumed silica, both gel silica and precipitated silica form a three-dimensional network<br>
of particles or aggregates. The increased surface area provided by this three-dimensional<br>
network permits gel silica and precipitated silica, when used to coat a surface, to<br>
immobilize liquid in inks printed onto the surface, allowing for sharper images and a faster<br>
ink drying time. Gel and precipitated silicas are therefore suitable for use in the coating<br>
compositions.<br><br><br>
[0019]	Colloidal silica particles are generally produced by "wet chemistry"<br>
processes and also have the chemical composition SiO2. Typically, colloidal silica is<br>
produced by the addition of an acid to an alkaline metal silicate solution (e.g., sodium<br>
silicate solution), thereby causing the silicate to polymerize and form discrete particles of<br>
amorphous silica. Colloidal silica particles, typically, are discrete, substantially spherical<br>
silica particles having no internal surface area. Commercially available colloidal silicas<br>
include, but are not limited to, those sold under the trademarks LUDOX® (Grace Davison),<br>
BINDZIL® (Akzo Nobel), and NYACOL™ (Akzo Nobel).<br>
[0020]	In one embodiment, the silica or fumed metal oxide is present in an aqueous<br>
dispersion before being combined with a binder to form a composition and/or applied to<br>
the substrate. The aqueous dispersion may comprise distilled or deionized water. The<br>
composition also may comprise any number of suitable water-miscible liquids, such as one<br>
or more water-miscible alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, etc.) or ketones (e.g., acetone) in<br>
addition to or instead of water.<br>
[0021]	As used herein, the term "binder" refers to a compound that helps facilitate<br>
adherence of the silica or fumed metal oxide particles to the substrate. Any suitable<br>
binder(s) can be used in the compositions including water swellable polymers having a<br>
hydrophilic functional group such as a hydroxyl and/or amine. Suitably, the binder<br>
comprises at least one of cellulose derivatives (e.g. hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose, cellulose esters, cellulose ethers), casein, gelatin, protein, starch (e.g. oxidized,<br>
esterified, or other modified types of starch), vinyl polymers (e.g. polyvinyl alcohol,<br><br><br>
polyvinyl pyrrolidine, polyvinyl acetate, styrene butadiene and derivatives), acrylic<br>
polymers (e.g. polymethyl methacrylate, lattices of acrylic polymers, such as acrylate<br>
esters, styrene-acrylic esters), polyesters, polycarbonate polymers, polyamides, polyimides,<br>
epoxy polymers, phenolic polymers, polyolefins, polyurethanes copolymers thereof, and<br>
mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the binder is polyvinyl alcohol.<br>
[0022]	A suitable amount of binder in the composition depends on the particular<br>
binder and upon the type of silica or fumed metal oxide used. For example, the optimum<br>
amount of polyvinyl alcohol in the composition for a particular application may be<br>
different from the optimum amount of polyvinyl pyrrolidine in the composition for that<br>
application.<br>
[0023]	The ratio of silica or fumed metal oxide to binder in the composition may<br>
also be varied depending upon the application and the desired result. Suitably, the ratio of<br>
silica or fumed metal oxide to binder is at least about 0.25:1, at least about 1:1, at least<br>
about 3:1, at least about 5:1, at least about 5.5:1, or at least about 6:1 and less than about<br>
100:1, less than about 50:1, less than about 25:1, less than about 15:1, less than about 12:1,<br>
less than about 10:1, less than about 7.5:1, or less than about 7:1.<br>
[0024]	Generally, the compositions may have a viscosity ranging from very low to<br>
very high, so long as they are capable of being deposited on to the surface of the substrate<br>
using techniques known in the art. Any suitable technique known in the art may be used to<br>
measure the viscosity of the compositions. For example, viscosity may be measured using<br><br>
a Brookfield LVT viscometer. Suitably, the viscosity may be at least about 1, at least<br>
about 5, at least about 10, at least about 25, at least about 50, or at least about 100<br>
centipoise and less than about 1,000, less than about 1,500, less than about 2,000, less than<br>
about 2,500 or less than about 3,000 centipoise.<br>
[0025]	The composition can be prepared, using a variety of methods. In one<br>
embodiment, the composition is prepared by combining an aqueous dispersion of silica or<br>
a fumed metal oxide (e.g., an aqueous dispersion comprising fumed silica particles and<br>
water) with at least one binder to produce the coating composition. The dispersion and the<br>
binder may be combined, for example, by mixing with a high shear mixer. The pH of the<br>
coating composition can be adjusted at any stage during its preparation to a desired pH.<br>
However, in some embodiments no adjustment of the pH is required. In one embodiment,<br>
the pH is directly adjusted on the dispersion when accompanied by high shear mixing. The<br>
pH also may be adjusted after the dispersion is mixed with the binder (i.e., after forming<br>
the coating composition). An adjustment in pH will usually be accompanied by a rise in<br>
viscosity as the dispersion approaches the neutral pH range (6.5 - 7.5). The pH can be<br>
adjusted using any suitable method, such as via the addition of an acid (e.g., mineral acid,<br>
acidic cation exchange resin, etc.) or a base (e.g., an alkali metal hydroxide, basic anion<br>
exchange resin, etc.). The coating compositions may be acidic or alkaline. Suitably, the pH<br>
of the coating compositions may fall within a pH range of about 2.5 to about 10.5; for<br>
example a pH range of about 2.5 to about 5 or about 8 to about 10.5.<br><br>
[0026]	The composition also can further comprise one or more other additives,<br>
such as surfactants (e.g., cationic surfactants, anionic surfactants such as long-chain<br>
alkylbenzene sulfonate salts and long-chain, suitably branched-chain, alkylsulfosuccinate<br>
esters, nonionic surfactants such as polyalkylene oxide ethers of long-chain, preferably<br>
branched-chain alkyl group-containing phenols and polyalkylene oxide ethers of long-<br>
chain alkyl alcohols, and fluorinated surfactants), hardeners (e.g., active halogen<br>
compounds, vinylsulfone compounds, aziridine compounds, epoxy compounds, acryloyl<br>
compounds, isocyanate compounds, etc.), thickeners (e.g., carboxymethyl cellulose<br>
(CMC)), flowability improvers, antifoamers (e.g., octyl alcohol, silicone-based<br>
antifoamers, etc.), foam inhibitors, releasing agents, foaming agents, penetrants, colorants<br>
(e.g. dyes or pigments), pigment dispersants, optical brighteners, whiteners (e.g.,<br>
fluorescent whiteners), preservatives (e.g., p-hydroxybenzoate ester compounds,<br>
benzisothiazolone compounds, isothiazolone compounds, etc.), biocides, antifungal agents,<br>
yellowing inhibitors (e.g., sodium hydroxymethanesulfonate, sodium p-toluenesulfinate,<br>
etc.), ultraviolet absorbers (e.g., benzotriazole compounds having an hydroxy-<br>
dialkylphenyl group at the 2-position), antioxidants (e.g., sterically hindered phenol<br>
compounds), antistatic agents, pH regulators (e.g., sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate,<br>
sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, etc.), cross-linking agents,<br>
water-resisting agents, wet strengthening agents, dry strengthening agents and lubricants<br>
(polyethylene waxes, natural waxes such as carnauba wax, calcium stearate, fatty acids and<br>
salts of fatty acids, paraffin).<br><br>
[0027]	In addition to these additives, the coating composition also can comprise a<br>
mordant, such as a cationic polymer, which may enhance the water-fastness of the<br>
composition. The cationic quaternary (NH4+) functionality of many polymers and salts may<br>
facilitate the binding of anionic dyes commonly used in ink jet inks. Suitable mordants<br>
include, but are not limited to, poly(vinylbenzyl trimethylamrnonium chloride),<br>
polyamines, poly DADMAC (diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride), polyethyleneimine<br>
(PEI) and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0028]	Additionally, colorants such as pigments or dyes may be added that may<br>
enhance the whiteness of the compositions when applied to a substrate. Suitable pigments<br>
include clay (standard grades, calcined grades, delaminated grades, chemically structured<br>
grades, composites/specialty grades), titanium dioxide (rutile, anatase), calcium carbonate<br>
(ground, precipitated), alumina tri-hydrate and sodium silicates. Calcium carbonate,<br>
alumina tri-hydrate and sodium silicates may also enhance the ink jet performance of the<br>
composition when coated onto a substrate and enhance anti-slip properties. The presence<br>
of silica or fumed metal oxide in the composition, such as fumed silica, may<br>
advantageously reduce the amount of agglomeration of these additional pigments.<br>
[0029]	The invention further provides a recording medium comprising a substrate<br>
coated with the composition as described herein (e.g., a composition comprising a binder<br>
and an aqueous dispersion comprising fumed silica particles and water) applied to at least a<br>
portion of the substrate. The substrate is suitably a paper that can be used as a packaging<br>
material, such as colored paper. As used herein, the term "paper" includes, but is not<br><br><br>
limited to paper, paperboard and cardboard. As used herein, the term "colored paper"<br>
means paper that is made from unbleached cellulose fibers, or paper that is made from<br>
bleached cellulose fibers, but has had color added such as by incorporating a colorant, such<br>
as a dye or pigment, into or onto the paper. "Bleached cellulose fibers" are cellulose fibers<br>
that have been treated by contacting the fibers with a bleaching agent, such as chorine-<br>
based bleaches (chlorine dioxide, perchlorate) and/or peroxides. In one embodiment, the<br>
paper may be made from unbleached cellulose fibers. In another embodiment, the paper is<br>
made from bleached cellulose fibers and comprises a colorant, such as a dye or pigment.<br>
Suitably, the substrate may be paper used in packaging materials such as boxes, sacks,<br>
bags and the like. In one embodiment, the substrate is brown kraft liner paper. Suitable<br>
papers include those having a GE brightness of less than about 90%, less than about 88%,<br>
less than about 86%, less than about 84%, less than about 82% less than about 80%, less<br>
than about 75%, less than about 70%, less than about 65% or less than about 60%, and<br>
those having a GE brightness of at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 15%,<br>
at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least<br>
about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, or at least about 55%.<br>
[0030]	The inventor surprisingly and unexpectedly discovered that, in contrast to<br>
the transparent or translucent layers formed when silica coatings are applied to photo<br>
papers, the application of coating compositions disclosed herein to colored paper caused<br>
the paper to have a whiter, brighter surface. Moreover, the compositions produced a<br>
uniform opaque layer when applied to the surface of the substrate.<br><br>
[0031]	Whiteness of a substrate such as paper can be estimated using an L* value,<br>
which is a measure of the total amount of light reflected off the surface of the substrate. A<br>
higher L* value correlates with increased whiteness. Suitably, the coating compositions<br><br>
may improve the L* whiteness value of a substrate by at least about 2, at least about 3, at<br>
least about 4, at least about 5, at least about 6, at least about 7, at least about 8, at least<br>
about 9, or at least about 10. The blue-yellow hue of paper is estimated using b* values.<br>
A lower b* value indicates that the substrate has a less yellow and more blue hue. Blue is<br>
perceived by the eye as being closer to white, and lower b* values are desirable. The<br>
coating compositions may reduce the b* value of the surface. Suitably, the coating<br>
compositions reduce the b* value of the substrate by at least about 2, at least about 3, at<br>
least about 4, at least about 5, at least about 6, at least about 7, at least about 8, at least<br>
about 9, at least about 10, at least about 11 or at least about 12.<br>
[0032]	The recording medium described herein can be prepared by a method<br>
comprising (a) providing a substrate; (b) coating at least a portion of the substrate with the<br>
composition described herein (e.g., a composition comprising at least one binder and an<br>
aqueous dispersion comprising fumed silica or fumed metal oxide particles) to provide a<br>
coated substrate; and (c) optionally drying the composition on the substrate. Furthermore,<br>
the composition may be repeatedly applied to the substrate to provide a recording medium<br>
having a coating with a desired thickness.<br>
[0033]	Any suitable method can be used to coat a portion of the substrate, directly<br>
or indirectly, with the composition. Suitable methods include, but are not limited to, roll<br><br>
coating, blade coating, air knife coating, rod coating (e.g., using a Meyer rod or the like),<br>
bar coating, cast coating, gate roll coating, wire bar coating, short-dowel coating, slide<br>
hopper coating, curtain coating, flexographic coating, gravure coating, Komma coating,<br>
size press coating in the manner of on- or off-machine, and die coating. Rapid,<br>
inexpensive methods such as rod coating and blade coating may be particularly suitable.<br>
The coating applied to the substrate can be of any suitable thickness. The coating is<br>
suitably applied to provide at least about 0.S, at least about 1, at least about 2, at least about<br>
3, at least about 4, at least about 5, at least about 6, or at least about 7 g silica or fumed<br>
metal oxide per m2 of substrate, and less than about 30, less than about 25, less than about<br>
20, less than about 15, less than about 14, less than about 13, less than about 12, less than<br>
about 11, less than about 10, less than about 9, or less than about 8 g silica or fumed metal<br>
oxide per m2 of substrate. The amount of silica or fumed metal oxide per m2 of substrate,<br>
is referred to herein as the "coat weight."<br>
[0034]	After application of the coating composition to the substrate, the coated<br>
substrate can be dried using any suitable method or combination of methods to provide the<br>
recording medium. Suitable drying methods include, but are not limited to, air or<br>
convection drying (e.g., linear tunnel drying, arch drying, air-loop drying, sine curve air<br>
float drying, etc.), contact or conduction drying, and radiant-energy drying (e.g., infrared<br>
drying and microwave drying).<br>
[0035]	An image may be printed, directly or indirectly, onto the recording medium<br>
using one or more of a variety of printing techniques, including gravure (flexo, roto), offset<br><br>
litho, electrophotographic, and high speed digital (for example, using XEIKON™ printers<br>
or INDIGO™ printers) techniques. The recording medium is particularly suited to receive<br>
an image from an ink jet printer. Images made using an ink jet printer on a recording<br>
medium comprising the coating compositions are brighter, sharper and have a higher<br>
resolution compared with a comparable substrate that has not been coated with the coating<br>
compositions. For example, inks ink-jet printed on a substrate coated with a coating<br>
composition described herein, compared with inks printed onto a comparable uncoated<br>
substrate, may show a reduction in bleeding and wicking of the ink of at least about 5<br>
microns, at least about 10 microns, at least about 15 microns, at least about 20 microns, at<br>
least about 25 microns, or about at least 30 microns. Inks ink-jet printed on a substrate<br>
coated with a coating composition, compared with inks printed onto a comparable<br>
uncoated substrate, may show an improvement in the raggedness of a line ink-jet printed<br>
onto the coated surface, such that the amount of line raggedness is reduced by at least<br>
about 2 microns, at least about 5 microns, at least about 10 microns, at least about 15<br>
microns, at least about 20 microns, or at least about 25 microns. The brightness of images<br>
printed on a substrate coated with the coating compositions described herein may also be<br>
improved over a comparable uncoated substrate. For example, the optical density of inks<br>
printed onto a substrate coated with a coating composition, compared with inks printed in a<br>
comparable manner onto a comparable uncoated substrate, may be raised by at least about<br>
0.05, at least about 0.1, at least about 0.15, at least about 0.2 or at least about 0.25.<br>
[0036]	The coating compositions may also improve the color gamut of the<br>
substrate. The color gamut of a substrate is the number of colors that can be accurately<br><br>
represented under a certain set of conditions. The compositions may improve the color<br>
gamut of a substrate by at least about 50%, at least about 75%, at least about 100%, at least<br>
about 150%, at least about 200%, at least about 300%, or at least about 400%.<br>
[0037]	Coating compositions comprising one or more fumed metal oxides or<br>
silicas, for example fumed silica, may also improve or enhance the anti-slip properties of<br>
the substrate by increasing the coefficient of friction of the substrate. As used herein, the<br>
coefficient of friction means the static coefficient of friction. The coefficient of friction<br>
can be suitably measured by any technique known in the art. For example, a technique<br>
known in the art to measure the static coefficient of friction is a TAPPI method T815 om-<br>
01. Suitably, the coating compositions increase the coefficient of friction of the substrate<br>
by at least about 0.2, at least about 0.25, at least about 0.3, at least about 0.35, at least<br>
about 0.4, at least about 0.45, or at least about 0.5. Suitably, the silica or fumed metal<br>
oxide in the coating increases the coefficient of friction of the substrate by at least about<br>
0.2, at least about 0.25, at least about 0.3, at least about 0.35, or at least about 0.4<br>
compared with the same substrate coated with a similar coating not comprising silica or<br>
fumed metal oxide.<br>
[0038]	The following examples further illustrate the invention but should not be<br>
construed as in any way limiting its scope.<br>

ratio of precipitated silica to polyvinyl alcohol in the composition was 6.67:1.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Application of the Composition of Example 1 to Brown Kraft Liner Paper<br>
[0044]	The composition of Example 1 was used to coat brown kraft liner paper<br>
(75#) using a #5 or #15 wire rod, such that the amount of fumed silica dispersed over the<br>
surface of the paper was 8.6 g/m2 or 13.3 g/m2. L*, a* and b* values for the coated paper<br>
compared with the uncoated paper are presented in Table 1. At 13.3 g/m2, the paper coated<br>
with silica had a b* value of 2.05 and an L*value of 68.71, compared with a b* value of<br>
10.55 and an L* value of 61.94 for uncoated paper, and a b* value of 12.23 and an L*<br>
value of 56.68 for paper coated with CELVOL® 523 (polyvinyl alcohol) but no silica. The<br>
L* and b* values for paper for uncoated paper, paper coated with polyvinyl alcohol but no<br>
silica (CELVOL® 523), and the paper coated with 13.3 g/m2 of the composition of<br>
Example 1 (W7622) are also represented graphically in Figure 1 (A and B).<br>
[0045]	The lower b* value of the paper coated with fumed silica indicated that the<br>
silica coating had imparted a less yellow and more blue hue to the kraft paper. The coated<br>
paper was also visually significantly whiter than the uncoated paper. The results for the<br>
L*, a* and b* values (measured in triplicate) of the coated paper are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>

compared with the uncoated paper are presented in Table 2. At 11.7 g/m2, the coated paper<br>
had a b* value of 2.22 and an L* value of 69.45, compared with a b* value of 10.55 and an<br>
L* value of 61.94 for uncoated paper, and a b* value of 12.23 and an L* value of 56.68 for<br>
paper coated with CELVOL® 523 (polyvinyl alcohol) but no silica. The L* and b* values<br>

silica coating had imparted a less yellow and more blue hue to the kraft paper. The coated<br>
paper was also visually significantly whiter than the uncoated paper. The results for the<br>
L*, a* and b* values (measured in triplicate) of the coated paper are shown in Table 2.<br><br><br>

of the paper was 8.5 g/m2 or 10.7 g/m2. The L*, a* and b* values for the coated paper<br>
compared with the uncoated paper are presented in Table 3. At 10.7 g/m2, the coated paper<br>
had a b* value of 2.05 and an L* value of 68.71, compared with a b* value of 10.55 and an<br>
L* value of 61.94 for uncoated paper, and a b* value of 12.23 and an L* value of 56.68 for<br>
paper coated with CELVOL® 523 (polyvinyl alcohol) but no silica. The L* and b* values<br>

523), and the paper coated with 10.7 g/m2 of the composition of Example 3 (W7215 S) are<br>
also represented graphically in Figure 1 (A and B).<br>
[0049]	The lower b* value of the paper coated with fumed silica indicated that the<br>

L*, a* and b* values (measured in triplicate) of the coated paper are shown in Table 3.<br><br><br>
Application of Compositions of Example 4 to Brown Kraft Liner Paper<br>
[0050]	The compositions of Example 4 were used to coat brown kraft liner paper<br>
using a #5 or #15 wire rod. Values were averaged from paper coated with LUDOX®<br>
HS40, LUDOX® SM30 or NYACOL® 1450. The average coat weight of these three<br>
coatings was 9.4 g/m2, with an average b* value of 11.23 and an average L* value of<br>
61.36, compared with a b* value of 12.23 and an L* value of 56.68 for paper coated with<br>
CELVOL® 523 (polyvinyl alcohol) but no silica, and a b* value of 10.55 and an L* value<br>
of 61.94 for uncoated paper.<br>
[0051]	The colloidal silica compositions did not significantly lower the b* value of<br>
the coated paper. The paper coated with colloidal silica also was not visually significantly<br>
whiter than the uncoated paper or paper coated with CELVOL® 523 (polyvinyl alcohol)<br>
but no silica.<br>

paper was 11.1 g/m2. The L*, a* and b* values for the coated paper compared with the<br>
uncoated paper are presented in Table 8. At 11.1 g/m2, the coated paper had a b* value of-<br>
0.95 and an L* value of 71.02, compared with a b* value of 10.55 and an L* value of<br>

[0055]	The lower b* value of the paper coated with precipitated silica indicated<br>
that the silica coating had imparted a less yellow and more blue hue to the kraft paper. The<br>
coated paper was also visually significantly whiter than the uncoated paper. The results for<br>
the L*, a* and b* values (measured in triplicate) of the coated paper are shown in Table 8.<br><br><br>

[0075]	The color gamut was measured for uncoated kraft liners, kraft liners coated<br>
only with polyvinyl alcohol and kraft liners coated with the compositions of Examples 1-5,<br>
as described in Examples 6-10. Values for the color gamut are shown in Tables 9-22. The<br>
results are shown in Figure 4 (A and B). Each of the coating compositions comprising<br>
fumed silica or precipitated silica substantially increased the color gamut of the kraft liner<br>
paper by approximately four-fold when compared with uncoated kraft liner paper, or kraft<br><br>
liner paper coated with polyvinyl alcohol (Figure 4 A). In contrast, the coating<br>
compositions comprising colloidal silica did not increase the color gamut of the kraft liner<br>
paper, or increased the color gamut only slightly when compared with uncoated kraft liner<br>
paper, or kraft liner paper coated with polyvinyl alcohol. (Figure 4 B).<br>
EXAMPLE 19<br>
Coefficient of Friction of Kraft Paper Coated with Polyvinyl Alcohol and Silica<br>
[0076]	The pick up (the amount of coating dried onto the paper over a defined area)<br>
and coefficient of friction for brown kraft paper coated with compositions comprising<br>
silica was measured. Kraft liner paper (75#) (obtained from Uline) was coated using a #5<br>
wire wound rod. The sheet was first blow dried, then dried under restraint. The pick-up<br>
was calculated gravimetrically when the paper was completely dry. The samples were<br>
mounted on the Coefficient of Friction Tester (TMI model 32-25) and tested per TAPPI<br>
method T815 om-01 with a 200g sled with an area of 2.5 x 2.5".<br>
[0077]	The pick-up and coefficient of friction for paper coated with one of three<br>
different types of polyvinyl alcohol (CELVOL® 523, CELVOL® 603 or CELVOL® 08-<br>
125) are shown in Table 23. The pick-up and coefficient of friction for paper coated with<br>
CELVOL® 523 and one of the following fumed silicas: W7330, W7520, W7622, W7215S,<br>
W1226; precipitated silica SIPERNAT® 22 S (22 S); or one of the following colloidal<br>
silicas: IJ935, N1430, BZ 30/60, HS40, SM30 are shown in Table 24. The numbers in<br>
parentheses in Table 23 reflect the ratio of silica to polyvinyl alcohol in each composition.<br>
The average for three separate samples, each measured five times is provided in Tables 23<br><br>
liner paper coated with polyvinyl alcohol (Figure 4 A). In contrast, the coating<br>
compositions comprising colloidal silica did not increase the color gamut of the kraft liner<br>
paper, or increased the color gamut only slightly when compared with uncoated kraft liner<br>
paper, or kraft liner paper coated with polyvinyl alcohol. (Figure 4 B).<br>

parentheses in Table 23 reflect the ratio of silica to polyvinyl alcohol in each composition.<br>
The average for three separate samples, each measured five times is provided in Tables 23<br><br>
and 24. For each coating, the standard deviation of the measurements fell between 0.02<br>
and 0.04 (2 d.p.) for the coefficient of friction and between 0.06 and 2.98 (2 d.p.) for the<br>
pick up.<br>
[0078]	Visual inspection of paper coated with the compositions recited in Table 24<br>
revealed that each fumed silica or precipitated silica composition coated the paper with an<br>
opaque and uniform layer, making the paper appear whiter and brighter. In contrast,<br>
papers coated with each of the colloidal silicas essentially remained translucent and were<br>
comparable to the paper coated only with polyvinyl alcohol.<br><br><br><br>

Title:	COLORED PAPER AND SUBSTRATES COATED<br>
FOR ENHANCED PRINTING PERFORMANCE<br>
Coated substrates are made from colored paper coated with a coating comprising<br>
silica or fumed metal oxide, such as precipitated silica, colloidal silica, fumed<br>
silica or fumed metal oxide. An opaque coating is formed which improves the<br>
L* and b* values of the colored paper. Images printed onto the paper show<br>
improved characteristics, such as a reduction in wick or bleed, or an improved<br>
color gamut.</td>
