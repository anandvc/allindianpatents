				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparation of beverage from the rinds of Garcinia.<br>
In the recent times, more attention has been given to the formulation of natural beverages, which include health and nutritional attributes. One of the most important consumer trends in the food industry today is the demand for "all natural" food products that are free of chemical additives.<br>
Garcinia (Family: Guttiferae) is a large genus of polygamous trees or shrubs, distrtbuledin the tropical Asia, Africa and Polynesia. It consists of 180 species, out of which about 30 species are.indigenous to India. G. cowa and G. pedunculata are grown in Northeastern parts of India and Andaman Islands. In Assam, both the species of Garcinia are often cultivated in homesteads for their acid fruits and the sun-dried slices of the fruits are used for culinary purposes (The Wealth of India (Raw Materials). 1956. CSIR, New Delhi, India). The fruits of Garcinia are acidic. The fruit rinds of certain species of Garcinia have been reported to contain substantial amount of (-)-hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which include G. cambogia, G. indica, G.atroviridis, G. cowa, and G. pedunculata. The physiological and biochemical effects of (HCA) have been studied extensively for its unique regulatory effect on fatty acid synthesis, lipogenesis, appetite, and weight loss. The derivatives of (HCA) have been incorporated into a wide range of pharmaceutical preparations in combination with other ingredients for the claimed purpose of enhancing weight loss, cardioprotection, correcting conditions of lipid abnormalities, and endurance in exercise (as reviewed by Jena, B.S.; Jayaprakasha, O.K.; Singh, R.P.; Sakariah, K.K. Chemistry and biochemistry of (-)-hydroxycitric acid from Garcinia. J. Agric. Food Chenri. 2002 50, 10-22). Moreover, Garcinia is a rich source of secondary metabolites including xanthones and their derivatives   (Bennet,   G.J.,   &amp;   Lee,    H.H.   (1989).   Xanthones   from   Guttiferae.<br><br>
Phytochemlstry, 28, 967- 1998). Since most xanthones have phenolic functional groups on a linear tricyclic ring they often exhibit a wide range of biological and pharmacological activities (Minami, H.; Takahashi, E.; Fukuyama, Y.; Kodama, M.; Yoshizawa, T.; Nakagawa, K. Novel xanthones with superoxide scavenging activity from Garcinia subelliptica. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1995,43, 347-349; Minami, H.; Kuwayama, A.; Yoshizawa, T.; Fukuyama, Y. Novel prenylated xanthones with antioxidant property from the wood of Garcinia subelliptica. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1996, 44, 2103-2106).<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a synergistic formulation of beverage from the rinds of Garcinia, wherein nnds of Garcinia cowa I Garcinia pedunculata are used in the preparation of beverage.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to utilize the fruit rinds of Garcinia to prepare a beverage.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to prepare a shelf stable natural beverage.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to prepare a beverage with acceptable sensory attributes.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides for a process for preparation of beverage from the rinds of Garcinia, which comprises,<br>
i)        selection of fruit rinds from the group of fruits comprising of   Garcinia<br>
cowa / Garcinia peduncuiata ii)       cutting the fruit rinds of to a size ranging from 1.5x9 mm to 5 x 15 mm iii)       extracting the pieces of fruit rinds as obtained in (ii) with water by<br>
autoclaving for a period ranging 20-30 min at a temperature ranging 115-<br>
120° C and at a pressure of 15-20 psi iv)      filtenng the extract obtained in (iii)<br>
v)       diluting the filtrate obtained from (iv) in the ratio of 1:5 to 1:9 with water vi)      preparing a sensorily acceptable beverage by mixing sugar at a level<br>
ranging from 15 to 25% and salt at a level ranging from 0.3 to 0.5% vii)      boiling the beverage obtained in (vi) at a temperature ranging 95°C-100°C<br>
for 15-20 minutes viii)     hot filling of the beverage in to presterilized bottles and capping In an embodiment of the present invention, the sensory acceptability of the prepared beverage may be effected by addition of sugar at a level ranging from 15-25% and salt at a level ranging from 0.3- 0.5%.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the microbiological stability of prepared beverage may be effected for a period of five to eight months at 25 to 30°C.<br>
The synergistic formulation of beverage from the rinds of Garcinia was done according to following flow diagram:<br>

The beverage obtained from the above method is light brown in colour with sweetish sour taste containing 0.3- 0.5% of salt, 15-25% of sugar and with the pH 2.5-3.0 and acidity of 0.5-0.7%. The novelty of the formulation is:<br>
	No synthetic acidulants are required for this formulation.<br>
	No synthetic (chemical) preservatives are used.<br>
	The formulation base is a potent antioxidant.<br>
	The formulation contains (-)-hydroxycitric acid,  which has antiobese properties.<br>
The advantages of the formulation is<br>
	The formulation is simple to obtain natural beverage.<br>
	This formulation is done from the dried hnds of the Garcinia so that it can be processed all round the year unlike fresh fruit juice, which is seasonal.<br>
	A beverage with potential health benefits.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be constructed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
250 g of dried rinds of G. cowa were cut into small pieces to a size of 1.5x9 mm manually. The rinds were extracted with 2.0 liters of water in autoclave at 115°C for 20 min at 15 psi. The aqueous extract was filtered with muslin cloth and the filtrate was diluted to a ratio of 1: 5 with water. The diluted sample was mixed with 60 g table salt and 3.0 kg of sugar and boiled for 15 minutes. The formulation was hot filled to the presterilized bottles and caped. The bottles were cooled to room temperature and carbonated. For initial microbial load the sample was plated in nutrient agar medium and incubated at 37°C for 20-24 h and it was found that there was zero count of bacterial colony per ml of formulation. Intermittent evaluation of bacterial counting was done and there was no detectable count of bacterial colony. The formulation was kept for 3 month at ambient temperature and the microbial load was found to be zero. As per the sensory evaluation, the product is acceptable.<br>
Example -2<br>
125 g of dried rinds of G. pedunculata were cut into small pieces to a size of 5x15 mm manually. The rinds were extracted with 1.0 liter of water in autoclave at 120°C for 30 min at 20 psi. The aqueous extract was filtered with muslin cloth and the<br>
filtrate was diluted to a ratio of 1: 9 with water. The diluted sample was mixed with 30 g table salt and 1.5 kg of sugar and boiled for 20 minutes. The formulation was hot filled to the presterilized bottles and caped. The bottles were cooled to room temperature and carbonated. For initial microbial load the sample was plated in nutrient agar medium and incubated at 37°C for 20-24 h and it was found that there was zero count of bacterial colony per ml of formulation. Intermittent evaluation of bacterial counting was done and there was no detectable count of bacterial colony. The formulation was kept for 3 month at ambient temperature and the microbial load was found to be zero. As per the sensory evaluation, the product is acceptable.<br>
Example -3<br>
100 g of dried rinds of G. cowa were cut into small pieces to a size of 3x9 mm manually. The rinds were extracted with 800 ml of water in autoclave at 115°C for 20 min at 15 psi. The aqueous extract was filtered with muslin cloth and the filtrate was diluted to a ratio of 1: 5 with water. The diluted sample was mixed with 20 gm table salt and 1kg of sugar and boiled for 15 minutes. The formulation was hot filled to the presterilized bottles and caped. The bottles were cooled to room temperature and carbonated. For initial microbial load the sample was plated in nutrient agar medium and incubated at 37°C for 20-24 h and it was found that there was zero count of bacterial colony per ml of formulation. Intermittent evaluation of bacterial counting was done and there was no detectable count of bacterial colony. The formulation was kept for 3 month at ambient temperature and the microbial load was found to be zero. As per the sensory evaluation, the product is acceptable.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
