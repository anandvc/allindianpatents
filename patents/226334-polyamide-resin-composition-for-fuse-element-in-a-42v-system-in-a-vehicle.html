DESCRIPTION<br>
Polyamide resin composition for fuse element<br>
and fuse element<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a polyamide resin composition which is excellent in arc resistance property, transparency, heat deforming resistance property and productivity and can be suitably used, for example, as the fuse elements available to electric circuit of automobiles and a fuse element made of said composition.<br>
Background Art<br>
Generally, the wiring of every kind of electrical equipment in an automobile is assembled to a fuse box, and the every kind of electrical equipment is connected to battery via a fuse element having a value of rated current<br>
available to the maanitude of electric current runninc to<br>
«»	•*&gt;<br>
it and the frequency in use. Such a fuse element 1 (Fig. 1) has a housing 2 and a pair of terminals 3 and 4 which is projecting out of the defined plane of the housing and standing in a row, and it has a structure containing a fuse-element 5 connected between both terminals in the housing 2. At the time when electrical current beyond the rated current is produced due to any cause and short circuit happens, the continuity between input terminal and output terminal is intercepted by.fusing of the fuse-element 5 of this fuse element and excess current is<br><br>
prevented to continue running into each electrical equipment. For the housing 2 of fuse element 1, a transparent resin such as polysulfone, polyethersulfone and the like excellent in heat resistance and insulating property is used so that it can be easily distinguished from outside whether the fuse-element is fused or not.<br>
Up to now, many battery systems for 14V generator (12V storage) have been mounted on automobiles and above-mentioned fuse element has been designed as 32V rated<br>
current, 32V x 1000A interception property (rated current x rated interception capacity) in order to adapt these battery system. However, these days, as the result of the increase of the amount of electrical equipment and electronics control apparatus mounted on automobiles and their change to larger size, the consumption of electricity is becoming more and more in whole vehicle. As the result, the increase of car weight due to the change to larger size of battery alternator and the change to heavier line of wire harness is coming into trouble, and as the drastic plan the change to higher value in automobile voltage (to 42V system) has been considered.<br>
When the automobile voltage is raised to 42V system, the arc due to larger voltage is produced over long time in fusing of fuse-element installed in fuse element than in conventional 14V system. But, anti-tracking property of polysulfone and polyethersulfone and the like constituting the conventional housing is not high enough to be available to 42V system. This is due to carbonization of polymer<br><br>
containing aromatic ring in main chain and is the essential phenomenon coming from resin itself. Namely, even if the fuse-element fuses, a leak current runs along the inner surface of the housing due to carbonization of the surface and the continuity condition between both terminals is maintained, and as the result, there is a possibility that housing and terminals melt and break. Therefore, in 42V system, the development of the fuse element made of the resin having the structure not to produce the carbonization of the inside of the housing at fusing of fuse-element is urgently demanded.<br>
Under such background a fuse element made of aliphatic polyamide resin (for example, nylon 6/nylon 66 polymer alloy) has been examined to maintain the arc resistance property required as a fuse. But such polyamide homopolymers are so high in crystallinity that its moldings are poor in transparency. Accordingly, when it is melded as fuse element, thene is a problem that the condition of rhe inside of the housing cannot be checked.<br>
And the fuse housing is distinguished by the color classified based on the magnitude of the rated current in consideration of safety and convenience at exchange. Therefore, it is desirable that the materials for fuse element has a depressed color change by the heat in engine room.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
The subject of the present invention is to provide a resin composition which can suppress the generation of leak<br><br>
current owing to carbonization of inside of housing when the fuse-element in fuse element mounted on battery system for automobiles having raised voltage fuses down, which has functions essential to fuse housing, for example transparency and heat resistance, and also which has anticoloring property against heat, and to provide a fuse element made of said resin composition.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have researched to solve the above subjects, and have found that above-mentioned subjects are solved and excellent housing for fuse element can be obtained by using a resin composition consisting of polyamide copolymer and polyamide resin.<br>
That is, the summary of the present invention is as follows:<br>
(1)	Polyamide resin composition for fuse element consisting of 95 to 5% by mass of polyamide copolymer(A) and 5 to 95% by mass of polyamide homopolymer(B).<br>
(2)	Polyamide resin composition for fuse element described in above (1), wherein silicate layer(C) of sweliable lamellar silicate is dispersed on molecular order level and the content of silicate layer(C) is 0.1 to 20% by mass.<br>
(3)	Polyamide resin composition for fuse element, wherein 0.1 to 4 parts by mass of a heat-resistant modifier(D) is further compounded based on 100 parts by mass of the polyamide resin composition for fuse element according to above (1) and (2).<br>
(4)	Polyamide resin composition for fuse element, wherein 0.01 to 0.5 parts by mass of a mold-releasing modifier(E)<br><br>
is further compounded based on 100 parts by mass of the polyamide resin composition for fuse element according to above (1) and (2) .<br>
(5)	Polyamide resin composition for fuse element, wherein 3 to 10 parts by mass of an inorganic fibrous reinforcement modifier(F) is further compounded based on 100 parts by mass of the polyamide resin composition for fuse element according to above (1) and (2) .<br>
(6)	Polyamide resin composition for fuse element according to above (1) and (2) wherein polyamide copolymer(A) is any one selected from nylon 6/66, nylon 6/12 and nylon 6/11.<br>
(7)	Polyamide resin composition for fuse element according to above (1) and (2) wherein polyamide homopolymer (B) is any one selected from nylon 6, nylon 66, nylon 11 and nylon 12.<br>
(8)	The fuse element which has a housing and a pair of terminals projecting out of the defined plane of the housing and standing in a row, and contains a fuse-element 5 connected between both terminals in said housing, wherein said housing is formed from the polyamide resin composition for fuse element according to any one of above (1) to (7).<br>
The present invention is explained in detail as follows.<br>
The resin composition for fuse element of the present invention needs to be a polyamide resin composition comprising a polyamide resin consisting of 95 to 5% by mass of polyamide copolymer (A) and 5 to 95% by mass of polyamide homopolymer(B) . Though the mixing ratio of polyamide<br><br>
copolymer(A) and polyamide homopolymer (B) in such polyamide resin composition depends on balance between transparency and the other physical property (mechanical property and heat resistant property and the like), in the present invention the ratio (A)/(B) needs to be 95/5 to 5/95 (mass ratio), and preferably 80/20 to 20/80. When the content of polyamide copolymer(A) exceeds 95% by mass, the rigidity and heat resistance of molded housing decreases and it is not preferable. On the other hand, when the content of polyamide copolymer is less than 5% by mass, the transparency of molded housing decreases and it is not preferable, again.<br>
In the present invention,. polyamide resin is meant by polymers haying amide bonds formed from aminocarboxylic acids, lactams or diamines and dicarboxylic acids (containing a couple of their salts) as the main ingredients in the main chain. As the concrete examoles of these ingredients/ aminocarboxylic acids contain 6-aminocaproic acid, 11-aminoundecanoic acid, 12-aminododecanoic acid, p-aminomethylbenzoic acid, and the like. Lactams contain e-caprolactam, o-undecanolactam, co-laurolactam, and the like. Diamines contain tetramethylenediamine, hexamethylenediamine, undecamethylenediamine, dodecamethylenediamine, 2,2,4-/2,4,4-trimethylhexamethylenediamine, 5-methylnonamethylenediamine, 2,4-dimethyloctamethylenediamine, 1,3-bis (aminomethyl)cyclohexane, bis(4-aminocyclohexyl) methane,<br><br>
bis (3-methyl-4-aminocyclohexyl)methane, 2,2,-bis(4-aminocyclohexyl)propane, and the like. And dicarboxylic acids contain adipic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, dodecanedioic acid, hexahydroterephthalic acid, hexahydroisophthalic acid, and the like. These diamines and dicarboxylic acids can also be used in the form of a pair of salts thereof.<br>
The examples of polyamide copolymer(A) of the present invention contain poly(caproamide/undecamide) copolymer (nylon 6/11), poly(caproamide/dodecamide) copolymer(nylon 6/12), poly(caproamide/hexamethylene adipamide) copolymer (nylon 6/66), poly(caproamide/bis(4-aminocyclohexyl) methane dodecamide) copolymer,, poly(caproamide/bis(3-methyl-4-aminocyclohexyl)methane dodecamide) copolymer, and the like or the mixture thereof. Among them nylon 6/li, nylon 6/12 and nylon 6/66 are preferable.<br>
The copolymer composition of said polyamide copolymer cannot be uniformly decided, because it also depends on the mixing ratio with polyamide hcmopolymer (3) so as to balance among arc resistant property, transparency and heat resistance of the fuse housing. But taking nylon 6/11 and nylon 6/12 as an example, a preferable ratio of (the component of nylon 6)/(the component of nylon 11 or nylon 12) is 50/50 to 95/5(based on mole %), and particularly preferably 70/30 to 90/10. When the component of nylon 6 is less than 50% by mole, polyamide copolymer is inferior in heat resistance as fuse housing in some case, and when the component of nylon 6 exceeds 95% by mole, polyamide<br><br>
copolymer cannot retain the transparency in some case. In<br>
■ti<br>
the case of nylon 6/66, a preferable ratio of (the component of nylon 6)/(the component of nylon 66) is 50/50 to 98/2(based on mole %), more preferably 70/30 to 95/5,and particularly preferably 80/20 to 90/10. When the component of nylon 6 is less than 50% by mole, polyamide copolymer is inferior in heat resistance in some case, and when the component of nylon 6 exceeds 98% by mole, polyamide copolymer cannot retain the transparency in some case.<br>
The examples of polyamide homopolymer(B) of the present invention contain polycaproamide (nylon 6), poly(tetramethylene adipamide) (nylon 46), poly (hexamethylene adipamide) /.(nylon 66) , polyundecamide (nylon 11), poly-dodecamide (nylon 12), poly(hexamethylene sebacamide) (nylon 610) , poly(hexamethylene dodecamide) (nylon 612), poly(undecamethylene adipamide) (nylon 116), poly[ bis (4-aminocyclohexyl) methane dodecamide] (nylon PACM12), polyf bis e3-methyl-4-aminocyclohexyl)methane dodecamide] (nylon dimethyl PACM12), and the mixture theirof. Among them, nylon 6 and nylon 66 are particularly preferable.<br>
As described above, on the viewpoint of arc resistance, it is preferable that both of polyamide copolymer(A) and polyamide homopolymer(B) do not contain any aromatic ring in their molecular structure, but they may contain the aromatic rings within the range not spoiling their arc resistant property in order to maintain the other property as fuse housing, such as heat resistance and transparency,<br><br>
and the like. In such case, polyamides containing monomer components such as m-xylylenediamine, p-xylylenediamine, terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, 2-chloroterephthalic acid, 2-methylterephthalic acid, 5-methylisophthalic acid, 5-sodiumsulfoisophthalic acid can be used. As pclyamide copolymer containing aromatic ring, poly(caproamide /hexamethylene terephthalamide)copolymer (nylon6/6T), poly(caproamide/hexamethylene isophthalamide)copolymer (nylon 6/61), poly(caproamide/m-xylylene terephthalamide) copolymer, poly(caproamide/m-xylylene isophthalamide) copolymer, poly[ caproamide/bis(3-methyl-4-aminocyclohexyl) methane terephthalamide] copolymer, poly[ caproamide/bis(3-methyl-4-aminocyclohexyl)methane isophthalamide] copolymer, poly[ caproamide/bis(4-aminocyclohexyl)methane terephthal amide] copolymer, poly[ caproamide/bis(4-aminocyclohexyi; methane isophthalamide] copolymer, poly(hexamethylene tere-phthalamide/hexamezhylene isophthalamide) copolymer (nylon6T/6I), poly(hexamethylene adipamide/hexamethylene terephthalamide) copolymer (nylon66/6T), poly(hexamethylene adipamide/hexamethylene isophthalamide) copolymer (nylon66 /6I), and the like are exemplified. As pclyamide homopolymer containing aromatic ring, poly(hexamethylene isophthalamide) (nylon 61), poly(hexamethylene terephthalamide) (nylon 6T), poly(trimethylhexamethylene terephthalamide) (nylon TMDT), poly(undecamethylene terephthalamide (nylon 11T), poly(m-xylylene adipamide) (nylon MXD6), and the like are exemplified.<br>
The molecular weight (relative viscosity) of above-<br><br>
described polyamicle resin is not particularly limited, but it is preferable that relative viscosity measured under the condition that concentrated sulfuric acid having i&gt;6% concentration by mass is used as solvent, ■measuring temperature is 25°C and the concentration of polyamide is ig/dl, is in the range of 1.5 to 5.0, particularly 2.0 to 4.0. When the relative viscosity is less than 1.5, the mechanical property of moldings tend to be low, and on the other hand when it exceeds  5.0, the moldability tends to notably decrease.<br>
The polyamide resin compound of the present invention may contain swellable lamellar silicates dispersed as fine filler, if necessary. The content of the swellable lamellar silicates is preferably 0.1 to 20% by mass, more preferable 0.5 to 10% by mass, and most preferably 1 to 5% by mass. When the content is less than 0.11 by mass, the effect reinforcing the resin matrix bv silicate layer of lamellar silicate is poor,.and the rigidity and heat resistance of the polyamide resin composition for fuse element decrease. On the other hand, when the content exceeds 20% by mass, the toughness and transparency of polyamide resin composition decrease.<br>
In order that silicate layer exists in polyamide resin composition as the fine filler, it is preferable to use the lamellar silicate-containing polyamide resin where silicate layer is dispersed in pclyamide copolymer(A) and/cr polyamide homopolymer(B) as the fine filler.<br>
In the present invention, "lamellar silicate-<br><br>
containing polyamide resin" means polyamide resin in which matrix silicate layer cf swellable lamellar silicate is dispersed in molecular order level. And the silicate layer is a basic unit constructing swellable lamellar silicate and is an inorganic lamellar crystal obtained by collapsing (hereinafter, refer to as cleavage) the lamellar structure of swellable lamellar silicate. In the present invention, "silicate layer" means the each sheet of this silicate layer or the laminated state having five or less layers in average. "Dispersed in molecular order level" means the state where each of silicate layer of swellable lamellar silicate exists in dispersed in resin matrix without forming any mass, keeping an interlayer distance of not less than 2 nm in average. "Interlayer distance" is the distance between the centers cf gravity cf above  silicate layer. Such state can be confirmed by observing the soecimen of a lamellar silicate-ccntaininc coivamide resin, for example by observing the transmission electron microscope photograph.<br>
Such swellable lamellar silicates can be natural products or can be artificially synthesized or modified, and their examples contain smectite group (montmcrillonice, beidellite, hectorite, sauconite, and the like), vermiculite group (vermiculire and the like) , mica group (fluoromica, muscovite, pallagonite, phiogopite, lepidolite, and the like), brittle mica group (margarite, clintonite, anandite, and the like), chlorite group (donbassite, sudoite, cookeite, clinochlore, chamosite, nimite, and the<br><br>
like). In the present invention, Na-type or Li-type of swellable fluoromica-based minerals or montmorillonite are particularly suitable.<br>
Swellable fluoromica-based minerals used in :he present invention are ones generally shown by the following structure:<br>
Naa(MgxLia)Si40YF2 (in this formula, O^a^l, 0^B^0.5, 2.5^X^3, lC^Y^ll, 1^Z^2)<br>
An example of the process for preparation of above-described swellable fluoromica-based minerals is the melting method where silicon oxide, magnesium oxide and each kind of fluorides are mixed and the mixture obtained is completely melted at the temperature range cf 1400 -15CC°C in electric furnace or gas furnace, ar.d  during the coding process the crystal of swellable fiucrcmica-basec minerals is grown in reaction vessel-<br>
Also, a preparation method or sweilacie rlucrcmica-based minerals where a talc as the starting substance is intercalated with alkali metal ion tc be given the swelling property, can be used (Japan Provisional publication No.149415/1990) . In this process, swellable fluoromica-based minerals can be obtained by heat-treating the prescribed ratio mixture of talc with fluoroaikalisiiicate or alkali fluoride at 700 - 1200°C in porcelain crucible. The formation of the swellable fluoromica-based minerals is confirmed by subjecting the swellable fluoromica-based minerals purified by elutriation treatment to the<br><br>
measurement of cation exchange capacity described below. This measurement is possible only when swellable flucromica-based minerals are produced, because ion exchangeable cations exist among the layers, then.<br>
Mcntmcrillonites used in the present invention are ones shown by the following formula:<br>
MaSi (Al2.aMg)01G (OH) :-nH:0 (in this formula, M represents a cation such as sodium, and<br>
0.25=a=0.6. The number of water molecule binding with interlayer ion-exchangeable cations is shown by nH20, because it can fluctuate variously depending on the condition such as the kind of cation and moisture, and the like.)<br>
Ion substitution products of montmorillonite having the same type, such as magnesian montmorillonite, iron montmoriilonite, iron magnesian montmorillonite, are known and these may be also used-<br>
In the present invention, there is no restriction on the initial particle size of swellable lamellar silicate. "Initial particle size" means the particle size of swellable lamellar silicate as the starting material used in preparing swellable lamellar silicate-containing pclyamide resins and differs from the size of silicate layer in composite material. But this particle size gives an effect not a little on mechanical properties of lamellar silicate-containing pclyamide resins, and therefore it is preferable to control the particle size by crushing the swellable lamellar silicate using jet-mill etc. in order to<br><br>
control the physical property. In the case that swellable fluoromica-based minerals are synthesized using the intercalation method, initial particle size can be changed by suitably selecting the particle size cf original talc. This is a preferable method in the respect that the particle size can be controlled in a wide range by using together with pulverization.<br>
Swellable lamellar silicates of the present invention have the structure consisting of negatively charged lamellar crystal which mainly contains silicates and ion exchangeable cations lying between said layers. There is particularly no restriction on cation exchange capacity(CEC) measured by the method described below, but it must be considered in the following case and preferably its range is 50 - 200 milii-equivaient/lOCg. When CEC is less than 50 milii-equivaient/lOOg, the swelling ability is so  low that sufficient cleavage cannot be attained at polymerization of lamellar silicate-containing polyamide resins, and as the result, the effect improving the mechanical property and heat resistance of the lamellar silicate-containing polyamide resins obtained would be peer. On the other hand, when CEC exceeds 2C0 milliequivalent/lOOg, the toughness cf the lamellar silicate-containing polyamide resins obtained becomes lower by a large extent and becomes brittle, and it is not preferable. Namely, there is a probability that a breakage coming from the shortage of the weld strength of the housing emerging in dependence on the design of injection<br><br>
molding die occurs in the process constructing a fuse element using fuse housing consisting of the present resin composition. In order to avoid this phenomenon which produces a problem in che aspect of productivity, it is preferable to use lamellar silicates having smaller CEC within the desirable range of CEC of the above-mentioned lamellar silicates. In this case, it is more effective to use a lamellar silicate CEC of which is, for example, at 50 - 100 milliquivalent/lOOg, and more preferably at 50 - 70 milliquivalent/lOOg. If any lamellar silicate like this is used, the rigidity and heat resistance of polyamide resin compound do not largely fluctuate, and it can be used as a fuse housing without problem.<br>
Next, the process for preparation of the present polyamide resin composition is explained.<br>
The process for preparation of polyamide copolymer(A) ana  polyamide homopoiymer(3) according to the present invention do not particularly limited, and these polyamides are obtained by melt polymerization under the condition of temperature of 240 - 300°C, pressure of C.2 - 3M?a, and time of 1 - 15Hrs, after putting the fixed amount of said monomers into autoclave. Polyamide copolymer(A) and polyamide homopoiymer(3) thus obtained are blended as pellet or kneaded as melt at fixed mixing ratio within the range described above to obtain polyamide resin composition of the present invetion.<br>
As described above, polyamide copolymer(A) and/or polyamide homopoiymer according to the present invention<br><br>
are preferably prepared as the lamellar silicate-containing polyamide resin where swellable lamellar silicate is disperced on molecular order level by polymerization under existence of swellable lamellar silicate. The condition where swellable lamellar silicate is dispersed in polyamide resin on molecular order level, is obtained by polymerizing the prescribed amount of above-described monomers in the presence of swellable lamellar silicate and cleaving the lamellar silicate. On this occasion, the polymerization may be suitably conducted at the condition of the range of temperature of 240 - 300°C, pressure of 0.2 - 3M?a, and time of 1 - 15Hrs using an ordinary method of melt polymerization.<br>
In the polymerization of this lamellar silicate-containing polyamide resin, ic is preferable tc add any acid. The addition of acid promotes the cleavage of swellable lamellar silicate and the dispersion of silicate layer into resin matrix proceed further. Resultantly, lamellar silicate-containing polyamide resin having high rigidity and heat resistance is obtained.<br>
Said acid may be either organic or inorganic acid as long as it is the one having pKs (at 25°C, in water) of C -6 or negative. Concrete examples of them contain benzoic acid, sebacic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, chloroaceric acid, trichloroacetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, nitrous acid, phosphoric acid, phosphorous acid, hydrochloric acid, ivdrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, perchloric acid, and the like.<br><br>
The amount of acid to be added is preferably treble moles or less based on total cation exchange capacity of swellable lamellar silicates used, more preferably 1-1.5 times. When this amount exceeds treble moles, the degree ct" polymerization of lamellar silicate-containing pclyamide resin becomes difficult to increase and the productivity decreases, and it is not preferable.<br>
And there is another method where before the polymerization of said lamellar silicate-containing polyamide resin, all of the said swellable lamellar silicate the amount of which is within above-mentioned ranges and water as the catalyst are mixed into a part of the monomers which form polyamide copolymer(A) and/or polyamide homopoiymer(3) and then residue of the monomers are mixed, and after that, these monomers are polymerized. In this case, in above mixing of ingredients in advance of colymerization, it is oreferable to use a stirring apparatus to make (high revolution and high shear possible or a ultra-sonic irradiating apparatus, or to treat over heating. In this method, it is preferable to add the said acids when the ingredients to be charged are mixed, and the adding amount is preferable to be within said range.<br>
Polyamide resin composition for fuse element of the present invention contains preferably 0.1-4 parts, more preferably 0,3-3 parts by mass of heat resistant modifier based on 100 parts by mass of polyamide resin consisiting of polyamide copolymer(A) and polyamide homopoiymer(B). This ingredient gives heat discoloring resistance important<br><br>
for fuse element. When the content cf this heat resistant modifier is less than 0.1 parts by mass, the effect to prevent heat discoloring is poor, and when the content is more than 4 parts by mass, there is a possibility that the mcldability becomes worse while the better effect of heat discclorating resistance is recognized. As such heat resisntant modifier, phosphorous esters cf pentaerythritol and hydroxyl group-containing compound are exemplified, and as concrete examples PEP-4, PEP-8, PEP-24G and PEP-36 manufactured by Asahidenka kogyo Inc., and the like are listed.<br>
Polyamide resin composition for fuse element of the present invention contains preferably 0.01 - 0.5 parts, more preferably 0.01- 0.3 parts by mass of mold releasing modifier based on ICC parts by mass of polyamide resin consisiting of polyamide copolymer(A) and polyamide homooolymer(B) in order to improving the mold release property at molding. When the content of this meld releasing agent is less than 0.01 parts by mass, the effect for mold release is poor, and when the content is more than 0.5 parts by mass, the bad influence cf the lowering cf weld strength etc. become notable. As such preferable meld releasing agent, metallic soap such as metal salts of stearic acid series and montanic acid series are exemplified, and as concrete examples "Ricomont NaVlOl", "Ricomont CaVi02" and "Ricomont L1V103" manufactured by Clariant Company, and the like are listed.<br>

(1)	Relative Viscosity of polyamide<br>
Dried pellet of polyamide copolymer (A) or polyamide homoplymer(B) is dissolved at the concentration of 1 g/til in sulfuric acid of 96% by mass, and the solution was served to viscosity measurement after inorganic component is filtrated off through Nc.G-3 glass filter. The measurement was conducted at 25°C.<br>
(2)	Copolymer composition of polyamide copolymer(A)<br>
200mg of pellet of purified and dried polyamide copolymer(A) was dissolved in 3ml of trifluoroacetic acid deuteride, and the solution was allowed to :5C~NMR<br><br>
measurement (Nihon Denshi Corporation, "Lambda 300WB" type) at 25°C. Copolymer composition was determined from the intensity ratio of carbonyl carbon.<br>
(3)	Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC)<br>
CEC was determined based on the method of cation exchange capacity measurement (JBAS-106-77) for bentonite (powder) provided by the standard testing method of Japan Bentonite Industrial Society.<br>
That is, using the apparatus where a vessel for decoction, an infusion tube and a receiver are vertically united, the lamellar silicate was, at first, treated by IN-aq.ammonium acetate adjusted to pH=7 and all of the ion-exchangeable cation existing between layers were exchanged to NK.~. And after sufficient washing with water and ethyl alcohol, above NK/ -type lamellar silicate was dipped in 10% by mass aqueous potassium chloride solution and NH-* in sample was exchanged to K*. Continuing to this, NK/ exuded by above ion-exchange reaction was allowed to neutralization titration using C.iN-sodium hydroxide aqueous solution and the cation exchange capacity (milliequivalent/lOOg) of sweilabie lamellar silicate as ingredient was measured.<br>
(4)	Inorganic ash content of lamellar silicate-containing<br>
polyamide resin<br>
The pellet of dried lamellar silicate-containing polyamide resin was precisely measured into a porcelain crucible and was burnt for 15 hrs in a electric furnace keeping temperature at 500°C. The residue after burning is<br><br>
inorganic ash and the inorganic ash content was calculated by following formula:<br>
Inorganic ash content (mass%) = [{weight of inorganic ash (g)} ]/[{ total weight cf sample before burning(g)}] *100<br>
(5)	The dispersion state of silicate layer in lamellar<br>
silicate-containing polyamide resin<br>
A small sample cut out from a test piece for measuring the bending modulus described below was included in epoxy resin, and then an ultrathin slice sectioned with diamond knife was photographed using transmission type electron microscope (JEM-200CX type, accelerating voltage is lOOkV, manufactured by Nihondenshi Inc.). The degree of dispersity of siliate layer was estimated by roughly measuring the magnitude and the interiayer distance of silicate layer in this photograph.<br>
(6)	Arc resistance of polyamide resin composition<br>
This was measured in conformity to ASTM D-4 95.<br>
(7)	Bending moduli's of the test piece<br>
This was measured in conformity to ASTM D-7 90.<br>
(8)	Deflection temperature by load of the zest piece<br>
This was measured in conformity to ASTM D-64 5 using the load of 0.45M?a.<br>
(9)	Transparency of the fuse housing<br>
A blade-type fuse element shown by Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 was manufactured and whether undermentioned each polyamide resin composition is proper as the housing 2 of fuse element 1 in the respect of the transparency or not was judged. Namely, the transparency was estimated as three<br><br>
grade of "O", "A" or "X" based on the following criteria, according to how the fuse-element 5 inside housing 2 looks when it was observed at the distance cf 33cm far from the fuse element 1. Generally, the color of the housing 2 cf a fuse element 1 is pink, purple, gray, light brown, dark brown, red, blue, yellow, green, transparent and the like according to rated current. Therefore, the housings 2 having different color were molded from many kinds of polyamide resin samples and the transparency was ranked by the following criteria:<br>
O : the fuse-elements 5 are detectable about all color of the housing,<br>
A : the fuse-elements 5 are detectable about a part cf color cf the housing,<br>
X : the fuse-elements 5 are net detectable exceot the transparent housing. In Fig. 1, the thickness of the housing 2 was 0.5 mm.<br>
(10)	Insulation resistance arter me breaking or ruse<br>
element<br>
Whether underdescribed each sample is adequate as housing 2 of fuse element 1 in respect to insulation resintance after breaking or not was judged based on whether the insulation resistance after breaking (after fusing of fuse-element) is more than 1MQ or not.<br>
(11)	Heat discoloration<br>
The test piece of 50 X 90 X 1mm was molded under the condition of molding temperature of 270CC and mold temperature of 40°C. This test piece was evaluated about<br><br>
color change AE after the heat treatment cf lOOOhrs in hot air dryer maintained at 125°C. The measurement was conducted using a color-difference meter SZ-Z90 ~ype manufactured by Nihondensyoku Kcgyo Inc. The smaller this value is, the smaller rhe amount cf discoloration is.<br>
(12)	Mold release property<br>
100,000 shots of the platy moldings of lOXioXi(mm) having a side-gate of 2 . 0WX 0 . 5HX 3.0L(mm) were injection-molded under the condition of molding temperature of 27C°C and mold temperature of 40°C. The percent defective (%) in total shots was calculated and evaluated. The smaller this value is, the more excellent the mold release property is and the higher the productivity is.<br>
(13)	Abrasion of mold<br>
100,000 shots of the platy moldings of IOXICXK^; having a side-gate of 2.0WXC.5HX3.0L(mm) were injeccion-molded using a mold made of steel ?X5 (manufactured bv Daido Tokusyukou inc.) under the condition of molding temperature cf 27C°C and moid temperature of 30°C. The heights of the gate parts cf the moldings obtained at the first stage and the final stage cf the injection molding were compared. Abrasion cf molding die was estimated by the increasing rate(%) of height of the gate part. The smaller this value is, the smaller the amount of abrasion is and the higher the productivity is.
