A CLEANING SOLUTION PUMP FITTING FOR A CHEMICAL SPRAYER<br>
PARK JEONG-TAE<br>
a Korean National <br>
of 3-7, Galsan-dong Dalsu-Gu, Daegu 704-170, Republic of Korea<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a chemical sprayers and for a cleaning pump fitted thereto.<br>
Background and prior art<br>
Various liquid chemical applicators or sprayers have been available in the prior art. Such sprayers generally incorporate a large tank connected by suitable lines and pumps to nozzles or spray heads mounted along a tool bar. Various chemicals are being used in these sprayers like fertilizers, pesticides, or insecticides which are in either liquid or granular form. These chemicals are relatively expensive and must be applied at the proper rate to achieve the intended purposes without undue waste of the chemical and/or lost productivity and yield.<br>
Pumps for cold cleaning and removing clogging of the liquid tube coil of a chemical sprayer for prevention of epidemics are disclosed in Korean Utility Registration No. 0182452 registered on March 7, 2000 by the applicant of the present application. The typical prior art sprayer and the pump therefor is shown in FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings. A liquid tube coil 30 is wound on a burner net which is heated by a butane gas container 70 and a gas adjusting knob 71 is disposed at the rear end near the butane gas container 70. The burner emits heat for heating up the liquid tube coil 30, while a lever 50 disposed at an operative upper end is operated to direct disinfectant fluid stored in a disinfectant fluid tank 20 at a lower end through a direction change valve 200. The liquid tube coil 30 when heated vaporizes<br><br><br>
the fuel therein and the disinfectant fluid vapors are emitted through the nozzle 40 at the front end of the sprayer in the form of a smoke.<br>
Oily impurities solidify around the nozzle 40 at the outlet due to the interaction and oxidation between the disinfectant fluid and air having a large temperature difference there between, when the disinfectant fluid is sprayed/smoked through the liquid tube coil 30 and the nozzle 40, causing clogging of the nozzle 40. These impurities increase due to accumulation of oily impurities and also due to the oxidation of the disinfectant fluid remaining in the heated liquid tube coil 30 and stacking of these oxidants therein. Therefore a device and method of removal of these impurities is required. For this purpose a cleaning solution tank 10 is separately installed at one side of the disinfectant fluid tank 20 having a pumping cylinder 240 and a piston knob 80 joined by a union 230 at a leading end at the other upper side. The cleaning solution tank 10 and a suction hose are connected to the union 230 of the cylinder 240 to discharge the cleaning solution of the cleaning solution tank 10, and the discharged cleaning solution passes through the valve 200 and the liquid tube coil 30 via the hose 220 connected to the direction change valve 200 of the disinfectant fluid operating in conjunction with the piston operating in the cylinder 240. The pumping of the cleaning fluid by the piston knob 80 of the pumping cylinder causes cleaning solution to be forced through the orifice of the nozzle 40, so that remaining disinfectant fluid and foreign substances such as carbonaceous substances which may remain in the liquid tube coil 30 and the nozzle 40 can be removed by cleaning.<br><br><br>
In the conventional cleaning solution pumping device, a pumping cylinder 240 made of soft rubber material, a union fittings 230, a rubber fitting hose 220 made of soft material, a fittings 210, and a direction change valve 200 are coupled to each other in a complicated and fragile way as shown in FIG. 1, so that the cost of manufacture and assembly is higher. During use, there is a greater probability of breakdown, and corrosion and leakage occurring due to fragility of the many fitting portions.<br>
Another significant fact is that in the conventional apparatus for spraying chemicals for prevention of epidemics, the fitting portions between components are highly apt to be detached or are fragile to cause a leakage. The disinfectant fluid used in the apparatus is very poisonous ingredients which can be easily corrode the soft rubber material if it is in contact for a long time, and the cleaning solution used for cleaning the clogged nozzle and liquid fluid coil is also a very poisonous chemical. So that parts such as pumping cylinder 240, union 230, fitting 210, other valve 23 must be replaced after they are used for a predetermined time. However, if the replacement period is delayed, the poisonous disinfectant fluid or the cleaning solution may leak or may be sprayed in an unexpected direction in use to cause great damage to a person in the vicinity therefore care must be taken in this regard.<br>
Thus there is a need for an improved pump means which has an improved fitting structure over the conventional pumping device as described above.<br><br><br>
Objects of the invention<br>
One of the objects of the present invention is to provide a novel pump means for the cleaning solution of a chemical sprayer.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a cleaning pump means for a chemical sprayer which has less number of parts.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a cleaning pump means which are coupled in such a fashion that the possibility of corrosion as well as leakage and failure is minimized.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a cleaning pump means which is significantly lower in cost and maintenance.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a cleaning pump means which has good material characteristics such as heat-resisting property, chemical resisting property and corrosion-resisting property.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a pump means which is not accident prone.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
According to this invention there is provided a cleaning solution pump fitting of a chemical sprayer for prevention of epidemics in which a cleaning solution contained in a cleaning solution tank is sprayed outside through a<br><br><br>

b.	a tube having a constant diameter and length and fitted to the cleaning<br>
solution inlet of the direction change valve ; said tube having a cleaning<br>
solution inlet into which the cleaning solution of the cleaning solution<br>
tank can flow and having one end of the tube closed; and<br>
c.	a cleaning solution pumping cylinder provided at an obtuse angle with<br>
the tube and disposed at one side of the tube right before the cleaning<br>
solution inlet tube between the cleaning solution valve inlet and which<br>

Therefore one of the aspect of the present invention is to provide a cleaning pump fitted means to a disinfectant fluid smoke sprayer, having a single injection-molded body defining a cleaning solution pumping cylinder, and a tube and a cleaning solution inlet said body fitted between a direction change valve and a cleaning fluid tank and which eliminates joints or defects such as leakage, corrosion and disengagement of the components.<br>
Unlike the cleaning solution pump fitted to a chemical sprayer of the prior art and a method of manufacturing the same, where the components are separately manufactured and individually coupled/assembled, the body and components in accordance with this invention are molded as one body, so that general processes such as manufacture process, assembly process can be simplified, and manufacturing cost can be significantly reduced. Further the possibility of corrosion, leakage, disengagement of the component due to a contact with a poisonous chemical fluid can be significantly reduced, and its lifetime can be lengthened.<br><br><br>

FIG. 3 is an enlarged view illustrating an essential part of the present invention;<br>
Non-limiting and non-exhaustive embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the figures, wherein like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout the various figures unless otherwise specified.<br>
Detailed description of the drawings<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described below in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The present invention may, however, be embodied in different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the present invention to those skilled in the art. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout the accompanying figures.<br>
FIG. 1 of the drawings has already been described hereinabove.<br><br><br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the present invention provides a cleaning solution pump device of a chemical sprayer for prevention of epidemics. The pump sprays cleaning solution (11) contained in the cleaning solution tank (10) outwardly through the disinfectant fluid coil (30) connected to the disinfectant fluid tank (20) and through the nozzle (40) to clean foreign substances such as disinfectant fluids and carbonaceous matter remaining in the disinfectant fluid coil (30) and the nozzle (40). The sprayer includes a direction change valve (110) having three sides in three different directions. In one direction a fitting (112) is connected providing a passage to the disinfectant fluid coil (30) where as on another side a disinfectant fluid discharge orifice inlet (111) is connected to the lower disinfectant fluid tank (20) . The valve (110) has a cleaning solution inlet (113) at its operative rear end side into which the cleaning solution (11) flows. The direction valve can be alternatively operated to connect the fitting (112) to either the disinfectant fluid inlet (111) or the cleaning solution inlet (113). A body generally indicated by the reference numeral (A) is provided with a tube (120) having a constant diameter which is fitted to the direction valve (110) at the cleaning solution inlet (113) of the direction change valve (110). The back end of the tube (120) is closed and a cleaning solution inlet (121) is provided in the tube allowing the cleaning solution (11) of the cleaning solution tank (10) to flow inside. A pumping cylinder (130) extends from the tube (120) at an obtuse angle with the tube (120) and is disposed at one side of the tube (120) right before the cleaning solution inlet (121) which allows the cleaning solution (11) of the cleaning solution tank (10) to be drawn through the cleaning<br><br><br>
solution inlet (121) by means of a constant suction pressure applied to the cleaning solution inlet (121) at the time of pumping operation.<br>
The component (A) is an injection-molded strong one piece structure where joints or defects such as leakage, corrosion, detachment between the direction change valve (110), tube (120), cleaning solution inlet (121) and cleaning solution pumping cylinder (130) are not present.<br>
A reinforced polymer, such as a glass reinforced polymer such as nylon may be used for making the body (A). The material has good heat-resisting property, chemical resisting property and corrosion-resisting property. This material is subjected to molding as a one piece body, so that a stronger structure can be obtained in addition to the quality enhancement resulting from the one body molding.<br>
However, the present invention is not limited to the disclosed nylon glass material but also may properly use other various synthesized resin/polymeric materials. That is, selection of the material following the one body molding is not the gist of the present invention but the gist lies in the one body molding of the several components, thereby obtaining structural solidity and a significant reduction in prime cost.<br>
Therefore, accordingly the cleaning solution pump fitted to the chemical sprayer for prevention of epidemics of the present invention, has an injection-molded   one   body   where joints   or   defects   such   as   leakage,<br><br><br>
corrosion, detachment between the direction change valve (110), tube (120), cleaning solution inlet (121), and cleaning solution pumping cylinder (130), are not present as described above, which results in a significant reduction in manufacture processes. This is achieved by means of the one piece injection molded structure (A) which results in a simpler and faster assembly and a significant reduction in the manufacture cost.<br>
In particular, the pump fitting of the present invention manufactured as one body ensures a good quality capable of significantly reducing the possibility of having leakage, corrosion, detachment or the like compared to the device assembled with conventional several components regardless of materials of the components.<br>
Further, the pump fitting of the present invention has the direction change valve (110) injection-molded simply as one body and having a good manipulation and a low rate of failure disposed in a location where the disinfectant fluid (21) and the cleaning solution (11) pass through compared to the conventional fitting seen in FIG. 1. The conventional direction change valve is costly and has a high failure rate.<br>
In addition, the pumping cylinder (130) extending from the tube (120) at the end provided with the inlet (121) is disposed at an obtuse angle with the fitting tube (120) while the cleaning solution inlet (121) is disposed at operatively behind and along a different path from the cylinder (130) so that the cleaning solution (11) is easily and automatically discharged by the<br><br><br>
pressure of up and down reciprocation of the piston (80) in the cylinder (130), thereby spraying the cleaning solution (11) through the liquid tube coil (30) and the nozzle (40).<br>
The above-disclosed subject matter is to be considered illustrative, and not restrictive, and the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications, enhancements, and other embodiments, which fall within the true spirit and scope of the present invention. Thus, to the maximum extent allowed by law, the scope of the present invention is to be determined by the broadest permissible interpretation of the following claims and their equivalents, and shall not be restricted or limited by the foregoing detailed description.<br><br><br>
