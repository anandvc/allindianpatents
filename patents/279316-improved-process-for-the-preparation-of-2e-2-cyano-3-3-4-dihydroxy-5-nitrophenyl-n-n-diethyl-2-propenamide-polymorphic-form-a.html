AN IMPROVED PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF (2E)-2-CYANO-3-(3,4-DIHYDROXY-5-NITROPHENYL)-N,N-DIETHYL-2-PROPENAMIDE<br>
POLYMORPHIC FORM A<br>
Technical field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved, cost effective, eco-friendly and easy to handle process to manufacture substantially pure form of (2E)-2-Cyano-3-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)-N,N-diethyl-2-propenamide or (E)- N,N-diethyl-2-cyano-3-(3,4-dihyroxy-5-riitrophenyl)-acrylamide polymorphic form A commonly known as (E)-Entacapone represented by Formula I, using ammonium acetate as a base.<br>
 <br>
Background of the Invention<br>
(2E)-2-Cyano-3-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)-N,N-diethyl-2-propenamide	or<br>
Entacapone is a potent and specific peripheral catechol-0-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor and is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. This compound exists in two isomeric forms E &amp; Z form out of which E form being more pharmaceutically active. E form of entacapone exists in five different polymorphic forms A, B, C, D and E.<br>
The synthesis of entacapone was first time described by Orion pharmaceutical in US5963590 which conversion of 5-nitrovanillin to 3, 4-dihyroxy-5-nitrobenzaldehyde and condensation with N, N-diethyl-2-cyano acetamide in presence of piperdine acetate and dry ethanol to give racemic entacapone with 73% yield wherein the ration of E:Z isomer is 70%: 30%.<br>
 <br>
The '590 patent discloses racemic entacapone without describing the stereochemistry and polymorphic forms. Piperdine used as a base in this reaction, forms unwanted side products.<br>
 <br>
US5135950 discloses the process for preparation of E-isomer polymorphic form-A of entacapone by purification of the racemic form of entacapone obtained from '590 patent by treating with lower aliphatic carboxylic acid as acetic acid in presence of catalytic amount of hydrobromic acid which yield to E isomer polymorphic form A of Entacapone with less than 0.1% of Z isomer.<br>
The process of condensation disclosed in this invention is time consuming moreover the reported yield are very low 73% and the final E isomer is contaminated with the Z isomer is to 3%. The purification steps involved increases the process time and make this process' commercially unviable for industrial production of entacapone.<br>
WO2005063693 discloses the preparation of entacapone fi'om 3-alkoxy-4-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzaldehyde described as alkoxy benzaldehyde with the acetamide derivative followed by dealkylation to give Entacapone.<br>
 <br>
The process for the preparation of Entacapone, neither the isomerism nor the polymorphism have been discussed in this patent application, and also requires extra step of dealkylation of the 3-alkoxy entacapone which may also lead to lower yield and purity.<br>
WO2005054950 discloses the preparation of Entacapone which process comprises condensing hydroxy nitrobenzaldehyde with acetamide derivative followed by extraction and purification with acid, different halogenated and alcoholic solvents like dichloromethane and methanol to give E-entacapone with less than 0.02 % of Z isomer.<br>
 <br>
The process involves lengthy workup and extra steps of acid and solvent purification making this process less attractive. Also this process is time consuming and the yield is also very low.<br>
 <br>
WO2005070881 (U20070004935) discloses the preparation of (E)-Entacapone by condensing 3, 4-dihyroxy-5-nitro-benzaldehyde with N, N-diethyl-2-cyano acetamide in presence of piperidine in an alcoholic solvent after which the reaction mixture is quenched in cold water and ethyl acetate followed by pH adjustment to 3.5-4.0 and the layers are separated .The organic layer was evaporated to get pure E isomer of entacapone as illustrated in Scheme rV below<br>
 <br>
The process is one pot synthesis of pure E isomer of entacapone, which involves lengthy work up and the product was isolated after evaporation of solvent which is not advisable on higher manufacturing scale. More over the compound is contaminated with Z isomer being at least 0.1%.<br>
US200625877 (WO2007113845) discloses the preparation E-entacapone which involves condensation 3, 4-dihyroxy-5-nitro-benzaldehyde with N, N-diethyl-2-cyano acetamide in pyridine, acetic acid followed by treatment with halogen such as iodine added in presence of a phase transfer catalyst to give E-entacapone as illustrated below<br>
 <br>
WO2007094007 discloses the preparation E-entacapone which comprises condensation of 3-alkoxy-4-hyroxy-5-nitro-benzaldehyde with N,N-diethyl-2-cyano acetamide in the presence of glycine acetate and a solvent to form alkoxy Entacapone which is fiirther dealkylated with aluminium chloride and pyridine to get crude entacapone which is fiirther treated with acetic acid and catalytic amount of hydrobromic acid to form E-entacapone.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The invention uses glycine acetate which is expensive and commercially not viable at manufacturing scale, the invention also involves the extra step of dealkylation which causes extra time consumption and the yield is low and so the purity.<br>
WO2007090923 discloses the preparation E-entacapone which comprises condensing 3,4-dihyroxy-5-nitro-benzaldehyde with N,N-diethyl-2-cyano acetamide in presence of C4-8 alcohol and in presence of base selected from methylamine hydrochloride, piperdine, N-methyl morpholine, pyridine and piperazine at a reduced pressure and at 70Â°C, cooling and seeding the reaction with entacapone with 60% of E isomer further cooling and again seeding with Entacapone with 30% Z isomer further cooling to 5Â°C during which time the product crystallises as racemic entacapone which is converted to pure E entacapone by known prior art methods. This method has significant drawback of cumbersome method of seeding the reaction mixture which is not possible for higher scale production, the base used in condensation forms unwanted impurities making the yields lower.<br>
WO2007077572 discloses the preparation E-entacapone which comprises condensing 3,4-dihyroxy-5-nitro-benzaldehyde with N,N-diethyl-2-cyano acetamide in presence of piperdine, pyrolidine, diisopropyl amine and like and mixture of solvent selected from ether and hydrocarbon to give crude entacapone which is further purified in halogenated and further crystallised using suitable solvent. This process requires consequent purification and crystallisation which is time consuming and yields are also low, the base used in condensation forms unwanted impurities making the yields lower.<br>
WO2005066117 discloses the preparation of different polymorphic forms C and D of E-Entacapone by condensing 3, 4-dihyroxy-5-nitro-benzaldehyde with N, N-diethyl-2-cyano acetamide in presence of piperdine, N-methyl morpholine, pyridine and piperazine in an<br>
 <br>
alcoholic solvent and further treating with proper acid or mixture of solvent to get the desired forms.<br>
WO2005063696 by Cilag discloses the preparation of Entacapone by heating 3,4-dihyroxy-5-nitrobenzaldehyde with raw N,N-diethyl-2-cyano acetamide in presence of acetic acid and diethylamine and toluene and by removing the water formed during reaction through azetrotpic distillation. A significant drawback is large amount of solvent has to be used which is not feasible for a large scale production.<br>
Most of the above disclosed invention utilizes piperdine as a base for the condensation which yields to unwanted impurity (2E)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-(piperidin-l-ylcarbonyl)prop-2-enenitrile of Formula II and high cost of production<br>
 <br>
so there is a continuing need for making a process which avoids the use of hazardous and expensive base as piperidine and a process that is easy to handle, eco-friendly, economical and yield better purity and good yield of the product.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Therefore the objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of (2E)-2-Cyano-3-(3, 4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)-N, N-diethyl-2-propenamide or (E) Entacapone polymorphic form A of formula I which is totally free from the (2E)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-(piperidin-l-ylcarbonyl)prop-2-enenitrile of formula II.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to the synthesis of E-entacapone which is simple, cost effective easy to handle and feasible at commercial or production scale with high purity and good yield.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention relates to a process comprising<br>
a)	reacting 3,4-dihyroxy-5-nitro-benzaIdehyde with N,N-diethyl-2-cyano acetamide in the presence of ammonium acetate and a suitable solvent to form racemic entacapone<br>
