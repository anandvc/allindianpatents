Process for the batchwise preparation of silicone<br>
emulsions<br>
The invention relates to the batchwise preparation of aqueous emulsions which comprise organosilicon compound, emulsifier and water.<br>
Silicone emulsions are commercially available as milky white macroemulsions in the form of water-in-oil (w/o) or oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions and as opaque to transparent microemulsions. They are mixtures of at least one water-insoluble silane, silicone oil, silicone resin or silicone elastomer or mixtures thereof, at least one emulsifier and water. For the preparation of the emulsion, these components are mixed with one another and dispersed with the use of, for example, heat and cold, mechanical shearing, which can be produced by means of narrow gaps in rotor-stator systems, colloid mills, microchannels, membranes, high-pressure homogenizers, jet nozzles and the like or by means of ultrasound. Homogenizing apparatuses and processes are described, for example, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, CD-ROM edition 2003, Wiley-VCH Verlag, under the keyword "Emulsions".<br>
The silicone component of the emulsion can be prepared in an upstream reaction outside the emulsification unit and then dispersed in the emulsif ication unit. Alternatively, the silicone component of the emulsion can be produced in the emulsif ication unit itself (in situ preparation) . Characteristic of the in situ preparation is that a chemical reaction takes place shortly before, during or shortly after the preparation of the emulsion.<br>
All reactions customary in silicone chemistry, in particular those which lead to an increase in molecular weight,  can be used for the in situ preparation or<br><br>
polymerization of the silicone component, for example chain extension or equilibration, polymerization, condensation or polyaddition reactions.<br>
The emulsion polymerization of polysiloxanes having terminal OH groups using acidic catalysts, for example an acidic surfactant, is described in US 6 140 414, US 5 726 270 or US 5 629 388. In US 5 504 150, a phosphazene is used as the acidic catalyst. The base-catalyzed emulsion polymerization of cyclic polysiloxanes or polysiloxanes having terminal OH groups is described, for example, in US 6 201 063.<br>
Polyadditions or hydrosilylation reactions in emulsion are described, for example, in DE 198 56 075, US 6 057 386, EP 1 135 429 or EP 780 422.<br>
Polymerization reactions in emulsion which lead to branched liquid polysiloxanes are described, for example, in DE 199 60 291, and those which lead to branched elastomeric polysiloxanes are described, for example, in WO 00/34359.<br>
In the preparation of silicone emulsions with the use of shearing, for example, the silicone or a silicone mixture is first mixed with at least one emulsifier and a small amount of water and exposed to high shearing, for example in a rotor-stator mixer having narrow gaps, A w/o emulsion having a very high viscosity forms as a so-called "stiff phase". The viscosity of this stiff phase is very greatly dependent on the shearing. This stiff phase is then slowly diluted with water to the inversion point. At the inversion point, the w/o emulsion becomes an o/w emulsion. The formation of the stiff phase and the method of dilution with water to the desired final concentration of the emulsion determine the quality of the emulsion. Quality of the emulsion is to be understood in particular as meaning<br><br>
the particle size, the distribution of the particle size, the storage stability and the tolerance of the emulsion to heating and/or cooling, vibrations, change of pH, change of salt content, etc.<br>
The abovementioned preparation of silicone emulsions by means  of  shearing  can  be  effected  batchwise  or continuously. The batchwise preparation is described, for example, in EP 579 458 A.<br>
The invention relates to a batchwise process for the preparation of aqueous emulsions (E) which comprise organosilicon compound (A) , emulsifier (B) and water, in which a preemulsion (V) of high viscosity is prepared from the organosilicon compound (A), the emulsifier (B) and water, and the preemulsion (V) is then diluted with further water, the pressures and temperatures being regulated during the process.<br>
It was found that the regulation of the pressures and temperatures in the individual process steps, in particular in the preparation of the preemulsion (V) , is determinative for the quality of the emulsions (E) and can be substantially improved by regulating the quality of the emulsions (E) prepared. The regulation leads to clearer products having smaller particle sizes in the case of microemulsions. In the case of macroemulsions, substantially smaller particle sizes and improved storage and dilution stabilities are achieved. With the temperature control, control of the particle sizes is possible. This effect is supported by the pressure regulation.<br>
The process is explained by way of example with reference to figure 1. Emulsifier (B) and a part of the water are introduced into the vessel (1) and mixed. For mixing, the vessel (1) preferably contains at least one stirrer. The shearing mixer (4) , for example a rotor-<br><br>
stator homogeniser, and the positively conveying pump (5) , which may be, for example, a gear pump, a rotary piston pump or a rotary spindle pump, are started and the emulsifier/water mixture (EW) is circulated and passed through pipe (8) back into the vessel. The organosilicon compound (A) is metered into the vessel (1) through pipe (2) or (3) . Preferably, the organosilicon compound (A) is slowly forced through pipe (3) directly into the shearing mixer (4) and mixed there with the emulsifier/water mixture (EW) and the mixture is recycled through pipe (8) into the vessel (1) . During this process, the preemulsion with high viscosity (V) is produced. The dilution of the preemulsion (V) is effected with shearing and further addition of water in the shearing mixer (4) . The addition of water is preferably effected through pipe (3), the mixture being circulated constantly through pipe (8) by pumping. Additives (Z) may be added through pipe (2) or (3) , and the emulsion (E) can be adjusted to the desired final concentration and removed through pipe (6) k Furthermore, it is possible to dilute the emulsion (E) further with water during removal through pipe (6) , for example by means of an in-line mixer or in a downstream mixing tank, before the final product is filled into a transport or sales container.<br>
It is particularly advantageous to use an additional pump (5) which is installed after the shearing mixer (4) in the direction of flow in order to control the circulation rate of the mixture and the pressure before and after the pump (5) and to regulate them in the desired range. Since the preemulsion (V) is exposed to shearing for longer at a low circulation rate in the shearing mixer (4) and hence energy is introduced for longer, the temperature of the preemulsion (V) increases at low circulation rate. Through the interplay of circulation rate, pressure regulation and temperature, the droplet size of the preemulsion (V)<br><br>
and emulsion (E) and the drop size distribution can be effectively controlled. This is very advantageous for the quality of the emulsion since a finely divided character and a narrow distribution of the drop sizes lead to increased stability of the emulsion (E) .<br>
The adjustment of the pressure in the range from 0.5 to 10 bar and of the temperature from 5 to 120 °C can be effected, for example, via the circulation rate of the pump (5) and can be determined at the measuring point (7). Pressures of 1.0 to 8 bar and temperatures of from 8 to 100°C are preferred. Pressures of from 1.5 to 6 bar and temperatures of from 10 to 8 0°C are particularly preferred.<br>
Different  values  result  for  the  pressures   and temperatures before/after the pump  (5) ,  depending on preemulsion (V) and the viscosity thereof. Typically, the higher the viscosity of the preemulsion (V) , the higher the pressure and the temperature.<br>
During the entire process, the total system pressure in the apparatus is preferably from 0 to 6 bar absolute, preferably from 0.05 to 2 bar absolute and in particular from 0.1 to 1.5 bar.<br>
In a preferred embodiment,<br>
in a first step, the emulsifier (B) is mixed with water<br>
to give an emulsifier/water mixture (EW) and,<br>
in a second step, the organosilicon compound (A)  is<br>
added to the emulsif ier/water mixture  (EW)  and the<br>
preemulsion  (V)  of  high viscosity  is  prepared  by<br>
shearing. Thereafter, in a third step, the preemulsion<br>
(V) is diluted with water.<br>
In the preparation of the preemulsion (V) , in particular in the above step 1, preferably not more than 50%, particularly preferably not more than 2 5%, in<br><br>
particular not more than 10%, of the total water introduced into the emulsion (E) is used. The viscosity of the preemulsion (V) at 25°C is preferably from 40 000 to 5 000 000 mPa-s, in particular from 50 000 to 1 000 000 mPa-s.<br>
In  the  second   step,   optionally  one   or  more organosilicon compounds or mixtures thereof are added as organosilicon compound (A) and energy is introduced, in particular by shearing, for breaking up the drops. The shearing in the second step is effected by means of a shearing mixer,  for example by means of a rotor-stator homogenizer. If desired, the added organosilicon compounds (A) can be reacted with themselves or with further substances.  For this purpose,  all reactions customary in silicone chemistry,  in particular those which lead to an increase in the molecular weight, can be  used,  e.g.  chain  extension  or  equilibration, polymerization, condensation or polyaddition reactions. By means this process step of the in situ preparation, in  particular  emulsions  of  high  molecular  weight liquid,  elastomeric,  gel-like or solid organosilicon compounds (A) are obtainable.<br>
In the process, the pressures are preferably regulated by the speed of the shearing mixer and the circulation rate of the pump. The regulation of the temperatures is preferably effected by means of the temperatures of the raw materials, the speed of the shearing mixer and the circulation rate of the pump.<br>
The addition of the ingredients of the emulsion to the emulsification container is preferably effected directly in the region in which high shearing is produced by means of the shearing mixer.<br>
In the third step, first water is added very slowly to the high-viscosity preemulsion (V) , for example at a<br><br>
rate of addition of from 0.0 04%/sec to 0.1%/sec, in particular from 0.008%/sec to 0.05%/sec, based on the total amount of the final emulsion, thereafter, for example, at 0.015%/sec, preferably with shearing. If the water is better taken up by the emulsion, the rate of addition can be further increased.<br>
In the third step or thereafter, other additives (Z) , such as emulsifiers, thickeners, biocides and water-soluble or dispersible silicones, polysiloxanes or silanes and acid or alkalis for pH adjustment, can also be mixed in, and the solids content is adjusted to the desired value.<br>
Preferably, water and an emulsifier (B) are initially introduced into an emulsification container, for example into a mixing vessel. The thorough mixing is preferably effected by means of conventional mixing tools, in particular wall-channeling stirrers, or by circulating the content of the emulsification container by pumping.<br>
The emulsions (E) preferably have a content of organosilicon compound (A) of at least 1 to 99% by weight, particularly preferably from 1 to 75% by weight, in particular from 9 to 8 0% by weight. The mean particle size measured by means of light scattering is in the range of from 0.001 to 100 (im, preferably from 0.002 to 1 |im. The pH can be varied from 1 to 14, preferably from 2 to 10, particularly preferably from 3 to 9.<br>
All silicones, siloxanes, polysiloxanes or silanes and mixtures, solutions or dispersions thereof can be used as organosilicon compound (A) in the process. Examples of (A) are linear organopolysiloxanes and silicone resins. Silicone resins are understood as meaning products which not only contain mono- and difunctional<br><br>
silicon units but also have tri- and tetrafunctional silicon units.<br>
Organosilicon compound (A) is preferably liquid at 25°C and  preferably  has  viscosities  of  from  0.5  to 100 000 000 mPa-s, preferably from 0.5 to 500 000 mPa-s, in particular from 2 to 80 000 mPa-s.<br>
An organosilicon compound (A) can be reacted in the process to give another organosilicon compound (A) (in situ preparation). The organosilicon compound (A) thus prepared may be a liquid, an elastomer or a solid at 25°C.<br>

If the organosilicon compound (A)  itself acts as an emulsifier, organosilicon compound (A) and emulsifier (B) can be identical. It is then possible to dispense with the addition of separate emulsifier (B).<br>
The constituent (B) of the emulsions preferably comprises commercially available and currently investigated emulsifiers, such as, for example, sorbitan esters of fatty acids having 10 to 22 carbon atoms; polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters of fatty acids having 10 to 22 carbon atoms and an ethylene oxide content of up to 35 percent; polyoxyethylene sorbitol<br><br>
esters of fatty acids having 10 to 22 carbon atoms; polyoxyethylene derivatives of phenols having 6 to 2 0 carbon atoms on the aromatic and an ethylene oxide content  of  up  to  95 percent;  fatty  amino-  and amidobetaines  having   10   to  22   carbon   atoms; polyoxyethylene condensates of fatty acids or fatty alcohols having 8 to 22 carbon atoms with an ethylene oxide content of up to 95 percent; ionic emulsifiers, such as alkylaryl sulfonates having 6 to 2 0 carbon atoms in the alkyl group; fatty acid soaps having 8 to 22 carbon atoms; fatty sulfates having 8 to 22 carbon atoms; alkyl sulfonates having 10 to 22 carbon atoms; alkali  metal  salts  of  dialkylsulfosuccinates;  fatty amine  oxides  having  10  to  22  carbon atoms;  fatty imidazolines  having  6  to  2 0  carbon  atoms;  fatty amidosulfobetaines  having  10  to  22  carbon  atoms; quaternary  emulsifiers,   such  as   fatty  ammonium compounds  having  10  to  22  carbon  atoms;  fatty morpholine oxides having 10 to 22 carbon atoms; alkali metal  salts  of  carboxylated,  ethoxylated  alcohols having 10 to 22 carbon atoms and up to 95 percent of ethylene oxide;  ethylene oxide condensates of fatty acid monoesters of glycerol having 10 to 22 carbon atoms and up to 95 percent of ethylene oxide; mono- or diethanolamides of fatty acids having 10 to 22 carbon atoms;  phosphate esters;  organosilicon compounds  (A) which have units of the general formula I, in which X is a radical of the general formula II and c is at least 1.<br>
As is well known in the area of emulsif iers, the opposite ions in the case of anionic emulsifiers can be alkali metals, ammonia or substituted amines, such as trimethylamine or triethanolamine. Usually, ammonium, sodium and potassium ions are preferred. In the case of cationic emulsifiers, the opposite ion is a halide, sulfate or methylsulfate. Chlorides are the most industrially available compounds.<br><br>
The abovementioned fatty structures are usually the<br>
lipophilic half of the emulsifiers. A customary fatty<br>
group is an alkyl group of natural or synthetic origin.<br>
Known unsaturated groups are the oleyl, linoleyl,<br>
decenyl, hexadecenyl and dodecenyl radicals. Alkyl<br>
groups may be cyclic, linear or branched. Other<br>
possible emulsifiers are sorbitol monolaurate/ethylene<br>
oxide condensates; sorbitol monomyristate/ethylene<br>
oxide condensates; sorbitol monostearate/ethylene oxide<br>
condensates; dodecylphenol/ethylene oxide condensates;<br>
myristylphenol/ethylene oxide condensates; octyl-<br>
phenyl/ethylene oxide condensates; stearyl-<br>
phenol/ethylene oxide condensates; lauryl<br>
alcohol/ethylene oxide condensates; stearyl<br>
alcohol/ethylene oxide condensates; decylaminobetaine;<br>
cocoamidosulfobetaine; olylamidobetaine; cocoimid-<br>
azoline; cocosulfoimidazoline; cetylimidazoline; 1-<br>
hydroxyethyl-2-heptadecenylimidazoline;	n-coco-<br>

It is also known that it is possible to use inorganic solids as emulsif iers (B) . These are, for example, silicas or bentonites, as described in EP 1017745 A or DE 19742759 A.<br>
The nonionic emulsifiers are preferred. The constituent<br>
(B) may consist of an abovementioned emulsifier or of a<br>
mixture of two or more abovementioned emulsifiers and<br><br>
can be used in pure form or as solutions of one or more emulsifiers in water or organic solvents.<br>
Emulsifiers  (B)  are used in amounts of,  preferably, from 0.1 to 60% by weight, particularly preferably from 1 to 30% by weight, based in each case on the total weight of organosilicon compounds (A).<br>
Examples of silanes are vinyltris (methoxyethoxy)silane, tetraethoxysilane, anhydrolyzed tetraethoxysilane, methyltriethoxysilane, anhydrolyzed methyltriethoxy-s i1ane, aminoethylaminopropy11 rimethoxys i1ane, amino-ethylaminopropyl(methyl)dimethoxysilane.<br>
All above symbols of the above formulae have their meanings in each case independently of one another. In all formulae, the silicon atom is tetravalent.<br>
In the following examples, all quantity and percentage data are based on weight, unless stated otherwise, all temperatures are 2 0°C and all pressures are 1,013 bar (abs.). All viscosities are determined at 25°C.<br>
Examples<br>
Example la (according to the invention) : preparation of a clear emulsion of an aminofunctional polysiloxane<br>
1.60% of isotridecyl alcohol ethoxylate having on average 8 EO (Arylpon IT 8), 4.14% of isotridecyl alcohol ethoxylate having on average 5 EO (Lutenso lw TO 5), 0,2% of acetic acid (80% strength) and 3.93% of demineralized water (temperature 12°C, the temperature is regulated to +/- 2 K) are initially introduced into a vessel. The mixing vessel is thermostated at 40°C and the homogenizer at 2000 rpm, and the stirrer and the circulation pump are switched on. Thereafter, 16.25% of aminofunctional silicone oil (Wacker Finish WR 13 00) at a temperature of 2 0°C are fed through pipe (3) at a<br><br>
rate of 1%/min, based on the end amount of emulsion. A thick phase forms. The pressure in the circulation pipe is about 4 bar and the temperature 45°C. Thereafter, 70.5% of demineralized water (12°C) are metered in, beginning at 0.02%/sec, based on the end amount of emulsion. Finally, 0.08% of preservative (Kathon LXE) and 3.5% of glycerol are metered.<br>
This leads to a clear silicone emulsion having a particle size of 2 0 nm and a turbidity of 10 ppm. The emulsion remains stable for several months at a storage temperature of 50°C.<br>
Comparative example 1 b (not according to the invention):<br>
If the analogous process conditions as stated under example 1 are chosen but the process is not carried out according to the invention but the aminofunctional silicone oil is metered at room temperature (20°C) and the mixer is not thermostated, this leads to a substantial temperature drop to about 3 0°C, but the pressure remains substantially unchanged since a stiff phase having a high viscosity as in example 1 did not form. The product prepared has a substantially larger particle size of 42 nm and a turbidity of 23 ppm. On storage at 50°C, phase separation is found after 3 weeks.<br>
Example 2a (according to the invention): preparation of a silicone resin emulsion stabilized with polyvinyl alcohol<br>
35.3% of polyvinyl alcohol solution (10% strength) (25°C, the temperature is kept constant at +/- 2 K) are initially introduced into a container. The stirrer and circulation pump are switched on and the homogenizer is set at 2000 rpm. The container temperature is regulated to 15°C. Thereafter, 48.4% of a mixture of silicone resin (80 mol% of T units, 20 mol% of D units, 20°C) and  an  OH-terminated  polydimethylsiloxane  having  a<br><br>
viscosity of 30 mPa-s are fed through pipe (3) at a rate of addition of 1%/min, based on the end amount of emulsion. The pressure in the circulation pipe is 2 bar and the temperature not more than 37°C. This is followed by addition of 16.06% of demineralized water (12°C), beginning at 0.02%/sec, based on the end amount of emulsion, and 0.24% of preservative (Rocima 523), and the mixture is homogenized for 5 minutes. Using the specified process parameters, an emulsion which has a storage stability of 1 year at room temperature without phase separation is produced.<br>
Comparative example 2b (not according to the invention)<br>
If the process parameters from example 2 are otherwise unchanged and the temperature of the polyvinyl alcohol solution is not monitored and is not increased according to the invention to 50°C, and the container is not cooled, the temperature in the circulation pipe increases to about 45°C. The product obtained shows substantial deposition of silicone resin after storage for only 2 weeks at room temperature.<br>
Example 3a (according to the invention): hydro-silylation in emulsion<br>
1.7% of water (12°C) and 3.2% of an isotridecyl alcohol ethoxylate of the average formula C13H27O (C2H40) i0H are introduced into a container. The stirrer and the circulation pump are switched on and the homogenizer is set at 2 0 00 rpm. The container temperature is regulated to 15°C. 4 5% of a mixture of trivinylcyclohexane and HMe2Si- (OSiMe2)x-H, where the molar ratio of C=C to SiH is 1.75, are metered in via pipe (3) at a temperature of 13°C in the course of 3 0 minutes. The components are mixed until a very highly viscous phase forms. The circulation speed in the case of the highly viscous phase is set to high by means of pump (5) , the temperature at the measuring point (7) is 2 9°C and the pressure in the circulation pipe is 2.7 bar.<br><br>
Thereafter, 10 ppm of platinum in the form of a Karstedt catalyst solution having a Pt content of 1.1% by weight (platinum-1,3-divinyl-l,1,3,3-tetramethyl-disiloxane complex according to US 3,775,452) are incorporated as reaction catalyst for the hydrosilylation reaction and the highly viscous phase is then immediately diluted with 50.1% of distilled water, which is metered in through pipe (3), beginning at a rate of addition of 0.01%/sec, based on the end amount of emulsion, to give a milky white, smooth emulsion. The resulting homogeneous emulsion has a mean particle size of 2 02 nm and a storage stability of more than 9 months.<br>
The silicone polymer isolated from the emulsion by addition of acetone has a viscosity of 14 550 mPa-s at 25°C.<br>
Comparative examples 3b (not according to the invention):<br>
The experiment is carried out as described under example 3a, but the raw materials for the emulsion are metered in at 25°C. The emulsification is carried out without pump (5) . The temperature at the measuring point (7) is 17°C higher than in 3a. The resulting emulsion is inhomogeneous and has coarse, rubber-like particles which accumulate at the top within a day. The emulsion therefore does not have sufficient storage stability. The particle size is 274 nm. The particle size distribution has several maxima.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
