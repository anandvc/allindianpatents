FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an improved apparatus with a single wire feeder for<br>
Tandem Submerged arc welding of steel plates.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In submerged arc welding (SAW), the arc is hidden by a blanket of granular flux.<br>
Normally a single wire is used as filler material. It is also possible to use two or<br>
more wires to increase productivity. When two wires are used (Tandem<br>
Submerged Arc Welding), one wire is connected to a DC power supply and the<br>
other wire is connected to AC power supply. Alternatively, both wires are<br>
connected to AC power source. Hence, there will be two power supplies, two<br>
wire feeders and two torches employed in tandem Submerged arc welding<br>
process. In this case two wire feeders independently controlled through separate<br>
controls have to be employed. Conventional tandem submerged arc welding<br>
requires welding current (wire feed speed) and arc voltage to be pre-set<br>
independently to achieve the desired bead geometry. However, the prior art<br>
systems are not capable to operate with one feeder and associated controls with<br>
a synchronized single point control for the wire feeders. Thus, automatic<br>
selection of welding current from the second power source is not feasible in the<br>
prior art system.<br>
US patent US patent US 7166818 discloses a Process development for making<br>
Tandem submerged arc welding.<br>
 <br>
3<br>
According to the cited invention, an electric arc welding apparatus comprising at<br>
least a first consumable electrode and a second consumable electrode movable<br>
in unison along a welding path between the edges of two adjacent, mutually<br>
grounded plates, a first power supply for passing a first welding current at a first<br>
low frequency between the first electrode and the two plates, a second power<br>
supply for passing a second welding current at a second low frequency between<br>
the second electrode and the two plates, where each of the power supplies<br>
includes a three phase voltage input operated at line frequency, a rectifier to<br>
convert the input voltage to a DC voltage link and a high frequency switching<br>
type inverter converting the DC voltage link to a high frequency AC current, an<br>
output rectifier circuit to provide a positive voltage terminal and a negative<br>
voltage terminal, and an output switching network operated at a given low<br>
frequency for directing a pulsating welding current at the given low frequency<br>
from the two terminals across one of the electrodes and the plates, and a circuit<br>
for independently adjusting the given low frequency so the value of the first low<br>
frequency of the first power supply is different from the second low frequency of<br>
the second power supply.<br>
Further, US patent US 7220940 discloses a Process development for system for<br>
welding with multiple arcs.<br>
This invention describes a system for welding with a first and second arc<br>
between a first and second electrode respectively and a common work piece ,<br>
when each of the electrodes is driven by a power lead from a single power<br>
 <br>
4<br>
source. The system comprises an inductor with a core, a center tap, a first end, a<br>
second end, a first coil section between the tap and the first end and a second<br>
coil section between the tap and the second end where the power lead is<br>
connected to the tap. A first circuit connecting the first arc in series with the first<br>
coil section and a second circuit connecting the second arc in series with the<br>
second coil section, a first separate auxiliary inductor in the first circuit between<br>
the first coil section and the first arc and a second separate auxiliary inductor in<br>
the second circuit between the second coil section and the second arc.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to propose an improved apparatus with a<br>
single wire feeder, for tandem submerged arc welding of steel plates, which can<br>
drive two separate filler wires at the same speed.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose an improved apparatus with a<br>
single wire feeder, for tandem submerged arc welding of steel plates, which<br>
enables reduction in the number of parameters required to be set.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to propose an improved apparatus with a<br>
single wire feeder, for tandem submerged arc welding of steel plates, which both<br>
power sources is capable of delivering same level of current.<br>
A still another object of the invention is to propose an improved apparatus with a<br>
single wire feeder, for tandem submerged arc welding of steel plates, which can<br>
achieve the same filler metal deposition rate from both wires.<br>
 <br>
5<br>
These and other objects of the invention are accomplished in accordance with<br>
the principles of the invention. Further features of the invention, its nature and<br>
various advantages will be more apparent from the accompanying drawings and<br>
the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 - shows the Tandem submerged arc welding set up with one wire feeder<br>
according to the invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, there is provided an improved apparatus for performing tandem<br>
submerged arc welding, comprising a single wire feeder capable simultaneously<br>
feeding two wires; at least two spools feeding the wires into two torches, the<br>

and 3B. The wires come out of contact tips (4) to create an arc (5) under flux<br>
blanket (6) to form single weld pool (7). The wire feeder (2) is driven by a motor<br>
(8) which is controlled by a control box (9). with the power drawn from power<br>
source (10). One of the torches 3A is connected to a Direct Current power source<br>
(10), while the other torch, 3B is connected to an AC power source, (11).<br>
Alternately, both the welding power sources can be AC type. The other terminal<br>
of the power source is connected to the job (12). The torches are isolated from<br>
