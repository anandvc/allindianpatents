Background of the Invention<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an optical head of an optical disc recording/reproducing apparatus, and more particularly to an optical head capable of recording/reproducing information on/from an optica! disc and performing the focusing servo and the tracking servo by means of a single light-receiving element, thereby simplifying the construction and reducing the energy loss of an optical disc recording/reproducing apparatus.<br>
2.	Prior Arts<br>
An optical disc recording/reproducing apparatus records and reproduces information on and from an optical disc by converging optical beams on the optical disc. Among information recording/reproducing media by the optical disc recording/reproducing apparams, a magneto-optical disc is a high-density memcr. zieans which has a large capacity and on which information can be erasably recorded.<br>
When the optical disc recording/reproducing apparatus records informatirr_ :- m optical disc, an optical beam radiated from a semiconductor laser is focused on ar. information recording surface of the optical disc as a shape of beam spots and elevates the temperature of the information recording surface up to the Curie point.   Then, the information recording surface loses coercive force and is magnetized corresponding to the given external magnetic field.   Thereafter, the radiation of the optical beam is stopped and the external magnetic field is maintained as it is, and the temperature of the<br><br>
information recording surface is lowered.  When the temperature comes down under the Curie point, the recording of the information is completed, and the magnetized information recording surface is maintained as it is even though the externa] magnetic field is changed.<br>
When the optical disc recording/reproducing apparatus reproduces information from an optical disc, a semiconductor laser radiates an optical beam at a temperature below the Curie point onto the information recording surface of the optical disc.   Then, the information recording surface has a Kerr effect, or magneto-optical effect, on the focused optical beam, so that the polarizing plane of the optical beam is rotaied with such an angle depending upon the magnetized state of the information recording surface.   The optica! disc recording/reproducing apparatus reproduces the information on :he optical disc bv deiectina the magnetized state of the information recording surface b^^^d on the rotated angle of the polarizing plane.<br>
An optical disc has an infonnation track and a guide track formed thereon in concentric or spiral shape at an interval of about 1,6 micrometer apart.   The rpiical disc recording/reproducing apparatus records/reproduces data on/from a predeienn:::ed position of the information track by means of the guide track.   Therefore, the optical disc recording/reproducing apparams performs focusing servo and tracking senc j: :rder TO exactly record and reproduce data on and from the optica! disc.   That is, the optical disc recording/reproducing apparatus controls the optical beam to be exactfy fociisc-:! on the information track and to exactly follow the guide track.<br>
In the optical disc recording/reproducing apparams. an optica! head detects servo error signals including focusing error signal and tracking error signal, and an objective lens actuator adjusts an objective lens along the focusing and tracking direction based c?n<br><br>
the detected servo error signals.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic constructional view of a conventional optical head 10 for an optical disc recording/reproducing apparatus as described above.   In optica] head 10, a linearly polarized optiea beam radiated from semiconductor laser 11 is transformed into a parallel optical beam through a collimator lens 12 and then is transmitted through a beam splitter 13.   Then, the optical beam is focused on the information recording surface of an optical disc 15 through an objective lens 14 with a shape of beam spots.   The optica! beam is reflected by the information recording surface, and the polarizing plane of the optical beam is diffracted at an angle that depends on the magnetized state of the focused region of the information recording surface, so that the reflected optical beam has information therein.   The informational cpti^ai beam is again transmitted through objective lens 14 and is incident into bea~ FZ'.-."SI 13.   The incident informational optical beam is reflected by the first reflecting surface 13a and then is transmitted in a direction al.<br>
The informational optical beam is c:--.ded into two components by the second reflecting surface 13b.   One component of ie informational optica! beam is transmitted in a direction bl toward a servo error signal deieciing optical system which includes-a condenser 16, a cylindrical lens 17, and a lizri-receiving element 18.   The servo error signal detecting optical system detects focusing error signal and tracking error signal from the informational optica! beam by means of —.e asiigmaiism method and the push-pull method.<br>
Meanwhife, the other component of the informational optical beam is transmitted in a direction b2 toward a data signal detecting optical system which includes a half-wave plate 19, a condenser 20, a beam splitter 21, and a pair of light-receiving elements 22 and<br><br>
23, and it is decoded by the data signal detecting optical system.   Because it has double light-receiving elements 22 and 23. the data signal detecting optical system can remove even noise having the same phase as that of the informational optical beam therefrom, so that it can reproduce information of high quality.<br>
However, since the above described optica! head 10 has a plurality of optical elements such as the servo error signal detecting optical system, a data signal detecting optical system, and a pair of lighi-receiving elements 22 and 23. the construction of optical head 10 is complicated and the size of optical head 10 is increased.   Further, the energy loss of the optical beam is increased and the optical efficiency of the optica! disc recording/reproducing apparatus is lowered because the optical beam is transmitted through various optical elements.<br>
To solve the above described problems, various effcr.:- :'cr simplifying the construction and reducing the size of the optical disc recording reproducing apparatus have been tried.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,331.622 issued to Ernst ei al. discizses an optical head in which the elements are reduced and the optical energy loss is mirj.T.ized.   Ernst's optical head includes an objective lens, a laser diode/photodetector package, and a half cube beamsplitter.   In Ernst's optical head, transmitting path of 'sjt :-:i:cil beam is shortened and the optica! energy loss is reduced, thereby [he optical efficiency of the optical head is considerably elevated.   However, Ernst's optical head has a '.in^iiaiicn in that ii requires a conjugate objective lens because the laser diode and the phct^ieiectcr are constructed as one assembly in Ernst's optical head.   Further, it is not easy to perform focusing servo with respect to the conjugate objective lens.<br><br>
The present invention has been made to overcome the above described problems of the prior arts, and accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide an optical bead which has reduced elements and a simplified construction, thereby reducing the size of the optical head, shortening the transmitting path of the optical beam, and reducing the energy loss of the optical head.<br>

A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 2 schematically illustrates an optical head 30 of an optical disc recording/reproducing apparams according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.   Reference numeral 50 designates an optical disc, an information recording medium.   As shown, optical head 30 includes a laser diode 35, a diffraction plate 31, a polygonal prism 32. a first light-receiving element 38, a second light-receiving element 36. and an objective lens 34.<br>
Laser diode 35 radiates a laser beam to record or reproduce information on or from optica! disc 50.   Diffraction plate 31 divides the laser beam radiated from laser diode 35 into three beams including one main beam and two sub beams.<br>
Polygonal prism 32 forms the first beam path for orienting the three divided laser<br><br>
beams toward optical disc 50 and the second beam path for the laser beam reflected from optical disc 50 through objective lens 34.<br>
Polygonal prism 32 includes a half-cube prism 32a and a parallelepiped prism 32b.<br>
In the meantime, referring to FIG. 3, parallelepiped prism 32b has a first and a second longer-side legs 41 and 42. and a lower and an upper shorter-side legs 43 and 44. Half-cube prism 32a has a hypotenuse 45, a rear leg 46, and a lower leg 47.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 2. first longer-side leg 41 of parallelepiped prism 32b is arranged to face objective lens 34 and laser diode 35.   A normal line through laser diode 35 has the same incident angle as that of a normal line through objective lens 34 with respect to first longer-side leg 41, so that the laser beam radiated from laser diode 35 and reflected by first longer-side leg 41 is transmiued through objective lens 34 to optical disc 50.<br>
Second longer-side leg 42 of parallelepiped prism 32b is attached lo hypotenuse 45 of half-cube prism 32a by means of adhesive or coating. Therefore, lower leg 47 of half-cube prism 32a and lower shorter-side leg 43 of parallelepiped prism 32b are connected to each other and form one integrated surface.<br>
Meanwhile, second longer-side leg 42 forms a first reflecting surface 33 of polygonal prism 32, and the attached second longer-side leg 42 and hypotenuse 45 forms a second reflecting surface 37.   Preferably, the first reflecting surface 33 is a modified polarizing beam splitting surface and the second reflecting surface 37 is a polarizing beam splitting surface.<br>
Between laser diode 35 and first reflecting surface 33 of polygonal prism 32 is disposed diffraction plate 31.<br>
The second light-receiving element 36 is attached to rear leg 46 of half-cube prism<br><br>
32a, and the first light-receiving element 38 is attached to the connected lower leg 47 of half-cube prism 32a and lower shorter-side leg 43 of parallelepiped prism 32b,<br>
Optical head 30 controls the intensity of the laser beam radiated from laser diode 35 based on the laser beam signal received by second light-receiving element 36,   Optical head 30 detects focusing error and tracking error and records/reproduces information on/from optical disc 50 based on the laser beam signal received by first light-receiving element 38.<br>
The first light-receiving element 38 includes a first light-receiving region 39 and a second light-receiving region 40.   The first light-receiving region 39 is attached to lower leg 47 of half-cube prism 32a and the second light-receiving region 40 is attached to lower shorter-side leg 43 of parallelepiped prism 32b.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 4A through 4C. the first light-receiving region 39 has a first, a second, a third, and a fourth light-receiving partions 39a. 39b, 39c, and 39d adjacent to each other, and the second light-receiving region 40 has a fifth, a sixth, and a seventh light-receiving partitions 40a. 40b, and 40c arranged in series.<br>
Hereinafter, the transmitting path of the laser beam in optical head 30 of the optical disc recording/reproducing apparams according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described.<br>
First, laser diode 35 generates and radiates a laser beam toward first reflecting surface 33 of polygonal prism 32.   The laser beam radiated from laser diode 35 is divided into three beams including one main beam and two sub beams by diffraction plate 31 disposed between laser diode 35 and polygoal prism 32.  The divided three beams proceed toward first reflecting surface 33.<br>
A part of the three laser beams arriving at first reflecting surface 33 is reflected by<br><br>
first reflecting surface 33 and then oriented toward objective lens 34, the other part of the three beams is transmitted straight through first reflecting surface 33 and detected by second light-receiving element 36.<br>
The second light-receiving element 36 estimates the detected laser beams and provides the estimated data for a driving means (not shown) for driving laser diode 35, and the driving means regulates the laser-radiating intensity of laser diode 35.<br>
Meanwhile, the three laser beams reflected by first reflecting surface 33 are incident through objective lens 34 on an information recording surface formed on optical disc 50.   The incident laser beams are reflected by the information reccrding surface and modulated to information beams corresponding to the shapes of pits recorded on the information recording surface.   The modulated information beams are L-ansmitied again through objective lens 34 into polygonal prism 32.<br>
The reflected information beams are transmitted through first rejecting surface 33 and arrive at second reflecting surface 37.   A part of the reflected informauon beams arriving at second reflecting surface 37, such as P wave, is transmited information through second reflecting surface 37 due to the polarizing characteristics of second retlecting surface 37.   The first light-receiving region 39 of first light-receiving element 38 anached to lower leg 47 of half-cube prism 32a detects the part of the reflected information beams.<br>
On the other hand, the other part of the reflected information beams arrising at second reflecting surface 37, such as S wave, is reflected by second reflected surface 37 and oriented toward first reflecting surface 33.   Then, this other pan of  retlected information beams is reflected again by first reflecting surface 33 and detected by second light-receiving region. 40 of first light-receiving element 38.<br>
Optical head 30 estimates the focusing error and the tracking error by means of<br><br>
second lighl-receiving region 40 of first light-receiving element 38 as described above, and then performs focusing servo and tracking servo based on the estimated result.<br>
Hereinbelow will be described the process of performing focusing servo and tracking servo and the process of recording/reproducing information on/from optical disc 50 by optical head 30 of the optical disc recording/reproducing apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention as described above, while referring to FIGs 4A through 4C.<br>
If the intensities of the laser beams detected by the first, the second, the third, and the fourth light-receiving partitions 39a, 39b, 39c, and 39d of the first light-receiving region 39 and the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh light-receiving partitions 40a, 40b, and 40c of the second light-receiving vegion 40 are put as INa. INb, INc, INd, INe, [Nf, and INg. then the focusing error FE is obtained by an equation.<br>
FE = {INa -I- INc) - (INb + INd).<br>
In this case, if FE is equal to zero, it means that the focusing servo is being normally performed, as shown in FIG. 4B.   If FE is less than zero, it means thai objective lens 34 is too close to optical disc 50, as shown in FIG. 4A.   If FE is larger :han zero, it means that objective lens 34 is too far from optical disc 50, as shown in FIG. 4C.<br>
Therefore, when FE is not equal to zero, optical head 30 makes a focusing servo actuator (not shown) adjust the interval between optical disc 50 and objective lens 34.<br>
The tracking error is estimated based on the difference between the laser beam intensities respectively detected by fifth light-receiving partition 40a and seventh light-receiving partition 40c by means of the three beam method.   The estimated tracking error<br><br>
is transferred to the tracking servo actuator (not shown), and the tracking servo actuator drives objective lens 34 so that the focus of objective lens 34 may exactly follow the guide track on optical disc 50.<br>
Meanwhile, the intensities of the laser beams INa, INb, INc. INd, INe, INf, and INg detected by the first, the second, the third, and the fourth light-receiving partitions 39a, 39b, 39c, and 39d of the first light-receiving region 39 and the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh light-receiving partitions 40a, 40b, and 40c of the second light-receiving region 40 are also utilized when optical head 30 records/reproduces information on/from optical disc 50.<br>
When optical head 30 records information on optica! disc 50. the difference Sdif between the intensities INa, INb, INc. INd, and INf of the laser beams detected by the firs;. 'the second, the third, and the fourth light-receiving partitions 39a, 39b, 39c, and 39d, and the sixth light-receiving partition 40b is utilized, in which<br>
Sdif - (INa + INb + INc + INd) - INf ,<br>
"When optical head 30 reproduces information from optical disc 50. the sum Ssum of ihe intensities INa. INb, INc, INd. and INf of the laser beams detected by the first, the second, the third, the fourth, and the sixth light-receiving partitions 39a, 39b, 39c, 39d, and -'.T is utilized, in which<br>
Ssum = (INa + INb +■ INc -I- INd) -I- INf .<br>
As described above, optical head 30 of the optical disc recordingyreproducing apparams according to the present invention performs the focusing servo and the tracking ser\o and records/reproduces information on/from optical disc 50 by means of just a single light-receiving element, that is first light-receiving element 38.   Therefore, optical head 30 does not require separate servo error signal detecting optical system and data<br><br>
signal detecting optical system, and thereby the number of elements of optical head 30 is •educed and the construction of optical head 30 is simplified.  In addition, the ransmitting path of the laser beam is shortened, and thereby loss of optical energy is educed.<br>
While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with eference to the particular embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be effected therein without departing ram the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br><br><br>

is a modified polarizing beam splitting surface, the laser beam being<br>
divided into a first and a second components by the first reflecting<br>
surface, so that the first component of the laser beam reached at the first<br>
reflecting surface and then oriented toward the objective lens, and that the<br>
second component of the laser beam reached at the first reflecting surface<br>
is transmitted straight through the first reflecting surface toward the rear<br>
leg of the half-cube prism.<br>
5.	An optical head as claimed in claim 1, wherein the detecting means<br>
comprises a second light-receiving element attached to the rear leg of the<br>
half-cube prism, the second light-receiving element detecting the second<br>
component of the laser beam so as to control the intensity of the laser<br>
beam.<br>
