DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present application discloses a number of improvements relating to the arrangement shown in the above US applications and particularly US application 08/762,668,   filed   December   9,1996.   That   application   discloses   in   detail   the<br><br>
construction of various  components of the present system and reference to that apphcation may be necessary to complete some details of the present application.<br>
The general system is shown in three similar but slightly different arrangements in Figures 1,2 and 3. Each of the systems of Figures 1,2 and 3 includes a main control valve 10 of the type described in detail in the above applications. This controls the flow of water to various elements of the system and will not be described in detail herein.<br>
The systems further include a source 11 of raw water to be treated. At the source is provided a flow metre 12, a pressure gauge 13 and a conductivity meter 14. The flow is controlled by a check valve 15 and by control valves 16 and 17 as required. The raw water is fed to the input line 18 of a main pump 19. A venturi 20 is provided which is arranged to inject air into the system. In figures 1 and 2, the venturi is arranged downstream of the main pump so as to inject air into the raw water supply under the pressure of the main pump. In figure 3, the air injector venturi is located before the main pump and immediately prior to the concentration chamber. The injector can be located at any suitable point in the system so that the water when under pressure and entering the concentration chamber contains pressurized air bubbles.<br>
Each system further includes a membrane system generally indicated at 21 which of the type described in the above application.<br>
In general the membrane system comprises one or more membrane elements each having a first port 22, a second port 23 and a third port 24.<br>
Inside the membrane element is provided a membrane which is configured so that the water to be treated passes across one surface of the membrane allowing water to pass through the membrane to be collected and carried by a water conducting layer. The water conducting layer carries the product water which has passed through the<br><br>
membrane  and  is therefore  substantially free from  contaminants  and carries the product water to a carrier duct communicating with the outlet port 24.<br>
The membrane is arranged so that water can be fed to the port 22 and discharged from the port 23 or vice versa. The arrangement thus takes raw water at one port and discharges water with a higher proportion of contaminants than the raw water at the discharge port due to the extraction of the product water through the membrane.<br>
The product at the port 24 is carried through a discharge line 25 to a product storage system 26. The hne 25 may include a pressure gauge 27, a flow metre 28 and a conductivity metre 29. Suitable valve controls 30 are also provided.<br>
The systems further include a concentration chamber 31 and recirculation pump 32 which may be the same pump as the main pump and this arrangement is shown in figure 3. The concentration chamber is arranged to receive the contaminated stream from the discharge of the membrane system, In the concentration chamber a pressure and velocity drop is caused together with a swirling action is created so as to allow contaminants to be dispelled from the flow for collection within the concentration chamber while the water extracted from the concentration chamber has a reduced concentration of contaminants. The water extracted from the concentration chamber is pumped back up to the pressure of the main supply pump by the recirculation pump 32 and is returned to the main stream for re-supply to the membrane system.<br>
Each of the systems further includes two separate filter elements 33 and 34 each arranged adjacent to a respective one of the ports 22,23. Thus, when the water is flowing through the membrane system in one direction, that is from the port 22 to the port 23, the filter 33 is provided just upstream of the membrane system and the filter 34 is just downstream of the discharge from the membrane system. When the direction is reversed by the valve 10 and the port 23 constitutes the feed side and the<br><br>
port 22 constitutes the discharge side, the filter 34 is just upstream of the membrane system and the filter 33 is downstream of the discharge port 22. The system is thus symmetrical and allows filtration to occur on the input side of the membrane system for each direction of flow of water through the membrane system.<br>
The symmetry of the arrangement ensures that one of the filters acts as a filter in advance of the membrane system in one direction of operation while the other filter is being cleaned and vice versa. The reversal of the flow through the membrane therefore acts automatically to effect cleaning of the filter screens. In addition the buildup of particles on the filter screen aids in cleaning when the fiow is reversed due to the increase in size of the particles as they build up on the screen.<br>
Turning now to Figure 6, there is shown one example of the concentration chamber 31 which is of the type shown in Figure 2 which is separate from the recirculation pump 32. This embodiment is substantially shown in the above mentioned application and includes a cylindrical tank 33 with a central axis 34 of the tank horizontal and defining two circular end walls 35 and 36. The tank can also be generally vertical (not shown). The contaminated water stream from the membrane system is injected into the tank 33 by an injection pipe 37 which is arranged reduce the pressure and velocity in the flow and to swirl the injected water around the interior of the tank and particularly around the axis 34 so that the contaminants tend to drop from suspension and collect around the peripheral wall and particularly at the bottom of the peripheral wall. Some contaminants can also float. The contaminants when expelled from the water flow can collect therefore at any suitable location in the chamber depending upon the shape and operation of the chamber. An outlet pipe 38 has a mouth 39 on the axis 34 and extends upwardly to an outlet 40 at the wall for supply through a line 41. An air cap 42 is maintained at a top of the tank near the water level 43 by a duct 44 and valve 45. The valve 45 can be of various different types and one simple example is a float valve which prevents the escape of water but allows the escape of air so that any air reaching a bottom mouth of the pipe 44 can<br><br>
escape through the valve thus ensuring that the air cap does not extend downwardly in the tank below the water level 43 at the bottom mouth of the pipe 44.<br>
In Figure 7 is shown a version of the concentration chamber which is used in the arrangement of Figures 1 or 3. Thus in this embodiment the pump 32 is mounted within the chamber 31. In this arrangement the chamber comprises a tank 36 with its axis 47 vertical so that the tank stands upon one end wall base 49. In this embodiment raw water from the pump 19 and the venturi 20 is fed through a line 48 into the interior of the tank adjacent a top wall 50. Contaminant water stream from the membrane system is fed along a line 51 and is injected into the concentration chamber again in a manner causing the water stream to swirl around the chamber and thus tend to deposit solid contaminants around the peripheral wall for collection at the base 49. The pump 32 comprises a submersible pump with an outer intake wall 52 mounted within the tank 46 within a support cylinder 53. The pump draws water into the top of the cylinder 53 after it has swirled around the outside surface of the cylinder from a position at the central axis 47 and pumps that water through an outlet pipe 54 passing through the cap 50 for supply to the membrane system.<br>
This chamber also has an air cap 55 defining a water surface 56 which is controlled by a pipe 57 and a valve 58 as previously described. The water level is below the feed from the pipe 48 and from an additional feed pipe 48A which receives water from a flush cycle (not described herein). The pipe 57 and the valve 58 control the height of the air cap by preventing the escape of water while allowing the escape of air. Thus the air cap water level 56 cannot drop below the bottom of the pipe 57. The amount of air in the air cap is maintained due to the relatively high level of air injected into the system. The air can gradually bleed through a hole 57A in the pipe 57 but the size of the hole is arranged relative to the amount of air injected so that the air builds up in the air cap at a faster rate than it escapes through the hole 57A. However the hole 57A is provided to allow the air cap to be discharged gradually in a situation where non-aerated water is added during a cleaning cycle for the tank.<br><br>
Turning to Figures 8, 9 and 10, three different arrangements of venturi are shown for injection of air into the raw water supply downstream of the pump 19.<br>
Basically, each venturi comprises a venturi nozzle 60 having a duct 61 extending through the nozzle, the duct having a first portion 62 which is of smaller diameter than a second portion 63. The portions 61 and 62 meet at a shoulder 64. At the shoulder a transverse bore 65 communicates from the shoulder at the portion 63 outwardly away from the bore to an outside surface 66 allowing air to be drawn through the bore 65 to mix with the water flowing through the duct 61.<br>
In Figure 9, the venturi is formed by machining a cylindrical block 67 of plastics material which is cut at ends 68 of the block to form threaded bores 69 each for receiving a pipe inserted into the block. A further threaded bore 70 is formed inside of the block to communicate with the air injection bore 65. The bore 70 receives a check valve to allow the entry of air but to prevent inadvertent escape of water should pressure and flow rates change.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figures 8 and 10, the venturi nozzle is formed as a separate insert piece 71 having a cylindrical body 72 and an end cap 73. The cylindrical body 72 can slide into an existing plumbing fixture and the end cap 73 provides a shoulder 74 which abuts against a shoulder of the plumbing fixture.<br>
Thus in Figure 10 a conventional T-fitting 75 includes three end pieces each for receiving a pipe. The first end piece 76 and a second end piece 77 are arranged along a same axis 78 facing in opposite directions. The third end piece 79 is arranged at right angles. The end pieces each have a shoulder 80 against which the pipe received with in a bore 81 of the end piece abuts. In this embodiment the end cap 73 and particularly the shoulder 74 thereof abuts against the shoulder 80 of a selected one of the end pieces and then slides toward the opposite end piece. The third end piece acts to supply air to the bore 65. An annular recess 65B extends around the insert piece 71<br><br>
and communicates fluid to the bore 65 allowing the bore 65 to be oriented in any direction around its axis.<br>
In Figure 8 an existing pipe portion 83 is modified to include two collars 84 and 85 each welded inside the pipe 83. In this embodiment the collar 84 defines an end face which co-operates with the end cap 73 of the insert. A sealing ring 86 is provided between the collar 84 and the end cap 73. In this embodiment the outside surface 66 of the insert is machined to form a stepped down section 87 which cooperates with the collar 85. The collar 85 thus has a smaller internal bore dimensioned to fit onto the outside surface of the turned down section 87. A second sealing ring 88 is provided between a shoulder 89 at the end of the turned down piece 87 and the adjacent surface of the collar 85.<br>
A stub pipe portion 90 is welded onto the outside surface of the pipe at a hole 91 in the pipe so as to communicate air into the hollow interior inside the pipe and outside the surface 66 for communication through the bore 65 into the venturi duct 61.<br>
Turning now to Figures 4,5 A and 5B, there is shown a first construction of one of the filters 33 and 34. The filter comprises a tube 92 having a first closed end cap 93 and second end cap 94 which has a connection nipple 95 for connection to a supply line using a conventional coupling arrangement. On the outside of the tube adjacent the closed end cap 93 is provided a second nipple 96 which communicates with the hollow interior of the tube. Inside the lube is mounted a filter element 97 which is cylindrical and spaced inwardly from the inside surface of the tube 92 so that water can pass through the cylindrical surface of the filter element from the nipple 96 to the nipple 95 or vice versa.<br>
The filter element 97 is formed in one or more element portions. In the embodiment as shown, the element includes a first portion 98 extending from the end cap 93 to a central support cottar 99 and a second portion 100 extending from the central collar 99 to the end cap 94.<br><br>
Each portion 98,100 is formed from a tubular rigid body 101 in the form of a conventional well screen which has a peripheral wall having a plurality of slots so as to allow the passage of water while restricting the passage of particulates. The tubular body 101 has a collar 102 welded at one end and the central cottar 99 welded at the opposed end. Thus the collars 99 and 102 define and end face which abuts with the end face of the tubular body 101 and is welded thereto. The collar 102 has a pair of O-ring seals 103 suiTounding the outside surface.<br>
Around the tubular body is wrapped a first flexible fitter screen 104 which extends around the peripheral surface and defines an overlapping strip along the tubular body 101. A second screen 105 is wrapped around the first screen 104 and again defines an overlapping strip along the tubular body. As shown in Figure 5C, the first inside band 106 extends along the outside surface of the tubular member 101 and is located at the overlapping section 107 of the inner flexible screen 104. A second band 108 is applied overlying the band 106 and the strip 107 and is covered by a strip 109 of the overlapping section of the outer flexible screen 105. The strip 107 is spot-welded to the band 106. The strip 109 is spot-welded to the band 108, Thus the flexible screens 104 and 105 are formed into cylindrical closed bodies surrounding the tubular member 101.<br>
The ends of the tubular flexible screen portions 104 and 105 coincide with the ends of the tubular body 101. These are wrapped by further bands 110 and 111 which surround the tubular body and clamp the screen portions 104 and 105 to the tubular body. The bands 110 and 111 can also be spot-welded to the screens to close the screens at the ends. Additional bands 112 are provided at spaces along the length of the tubular member 101 thus clamping the screens onto the tubular member and preventing billowing of the screens and the pressure from water exiting from the interior outwardly.<br>
Thus the inner rigid tubular member 101 provides a support for the thin flexible<br><br>
screen. The inner tubular member can have a filter screen mesh of the order of 25. The flexible layer 104 has a filter mesh of the order of 1000. The outside flexible layer 105 is a fitter mesh of the order of 25 and thus provides a support for the fine filter contained between the two outer layers.<br>
The end collar 102 slides into an end sleeve portion 113 of the end cap 94. Thus the nipple 95 communicates with the hollow interior of the fitter element through the sleeve 113 and through a hole 114 in the end plate 115 of the end cap 94.<br>
The collar 99 includes a first cottar portion 116 which has an end face 117 abutting the end of the tubular member 101. The collar 99 further includes a second collar portion 118 which is welded to and partly surrounds the cottar portion 116. Thus the inside surface of the collar portion 118 has a diameter equal to the outside surface of the collar portion 116. The collar portion 118 has an end surface 119 spaced longitudinally away from the end face of the collar portion 116.<br>
On the outside surface of the cottar portion 118 is provided a plurality of angularly spaced spacer members 120 arranged at spaced positions around the peripheral surface. These spacer members are arranged to contact the inside surface of the tube 92 and hold the cottar 99 centrally of the tube 92.<br>
The second fitter element portion 98 as shown partly in Figure 5A and partly in Figure 5B includes and end collar 122 identical to the collar 102. This cottar buts with the end of the tubular member 101 of the portion 98 and therefore can slide inside the collar portion 118 and can be seated relative thereto by the 0-rings 123 corresponding to the 0-rings 103 of the cottar 102.<br>
At the opposite end of the portion 98 is a collar 124 which corresponds to the collar 122 and has similar 0-ring seats 125. The cottar 124 slides inside a sleeve portion 126 corresponding to the sleeve portion 123 of the end cap 94. The sleeve portion 126 is carried on an end plate 127 attached to a cylindrical support block 128<br><br>
which extends axially away from the filter element. An end face 129 of the support block 128 abuts an inside face 130 of the end cap 93. The end caps 93 and 94 each have a recessed section 131 onto which the tube 92 is received and clamped in place by a surrounding conventional groove lock member 132.<br>
Turning now to Figures 11 and 12 there is shown a modified fitter construction similar to that of Figures 3 and 4. Thus the fitter of Figures 11 and 12 comprises an outer tube 133 closed by end caps 134 and 135. The end cap 134 includes a nipple 136 communicating with an opening 137. A nipple 138 is provided on the peripheral wall defined by the tube 133 and communicating with an opening 139. In this embodiment a fitter screen material 140 is supported on a plurality of rods 141 and 142. The rods are carried on the end plates 134 and 135 so as to extend longitudinally of the tube 133. The rods include a set of outer rods 141 and a set of inner rods 142. The outer rods 141 tie on an outer circle surrounding the axis 143 of the tube 133. The inner rods 142 tie on a second circle smaller than that of the outer circle. The filter screen material 140 is wrapped inwardly of the inner rods and outwardly of the outer rods so as to form a star shape as best shown in Figure 12. The filter screen material can be of the same construction as that previously described including an inner coarser layer, an central fine filter layer and an outer coarser layer.<br>
Each end cap 134,135 includes an inner metal plate 142 which is embedded within an insulating material 143. Thus the plate 142 is electrically separated from the tube 133, The plates 142 are electrically connected to the rods 141 so that voltage can be applied between the rods and the screen at one voltage and the tube at a second voltage. Wire connectors 144 and 145 allow the connection of a suitable voltage across these elements.<br>
The use of mechanical filter screens in series with the membrane elements reduces the potential for feed spacer plugging. The screens prevent larger particulate from passing through the membrane element in one of two ways:  stopping the<br><br>
particles at the screen, or breaking the particles into smaller pieces that will not cause feed spacer plugging.<br>
The reversal of flow through the screens allows the particles to be flushed off of the screen surface to the concentration chamber where they may be contained until removed from the system entirety. Reversal of flow through mechanical fitter elements is not performed in other systems as part of regular operation. Any flow reversal that might occur in other mechanical filters is done for the sole purpose of cleaning the element and is usually a waste wasteful manual operation.<br>
The placement of the in-tine screens in the system is unique. Other systems may incorporate raw water pre-filler devices, but placing the in-line screens in series with the membrane element in the concentration loop allows the screens to remove particles that precipitate out of solution when their solubility limits are exceeded, or when they are oxidised; these materials may not be present in the raw water as particulate, and therefore could not be removed with mechanical filtration equipment at that point.<br>
The mesh size is chosen so that the minimum filtration ability is not sacrificed, while the maximum open area is achieved; a preferred size being 25um. This mesh size may vary from less than 1 um to more than 200um depending on the contaminants present in the solution to be treated and membrane element feed spacer design.<br>
In this embodiment and the embodiment of the screen previously described, a DC or slowly alternating voltage may be supplied to the screens to assist in thecatatyzation and/or the crystallisation of metallic salts and charged organic materials. The DC voltage or slowly alternating AC voltage may be applied across each individual screen with periodic polarity reversals to minimize ion migration and degradation of the screen material and to aid in removal of particles attached due to electrostatic forces. The voltage may also be applied between the two  screens  at each side of the<br><br>
membrane element, or between the screens and the product collector core, or between the screens and the membrane housing material. Periodic polarity reversal may be used to minimize ion migration between whichever two materials are charged.<br>
A preferred material for the construction of in-line screens is stainless steel. Stainless steel may be used because of its resistance to corrosive materials. Stainless steel is not as easily mechanically damaged as other, softer metals or plastics. Stainless steel has an inherent electron deficiency which catalyzes thecrystallisation process as mentioned above without the application of DC voltage. Stainless steel is not a normal choice in other systems due to its cost and tendency to clog with crystal formations due to the electron deficiency. The system uses this property of stainless steel advantageously with the implementation of the reverse flow to flush the contaminants off of the screen. The term "fabric" as used herein is intended therefore to include woven steel wire or other forms of steel mesh as well as other flexible sheet material which are pervious to water but provide interstices for collection of particulates thereon.<br>
Materials other than stainless steel may be used in the in-line screens, each chosen for electron deficient properties, conductivity, resistance to corrosive materials, cost, ease of manufacture, mechanical strength characteristics, or any other combination of the above factors.<br>
The geometrical configuration of the screens and the mechanical tension applied to the materiat is chosen so that it promotes mechanical resonance in the screen when a solution is flowing through it in the reverse direction for the purpose of breaking solids off of the surface of the screen for removal by the concentration chamber.<br>
The gas injected is preferably air but other gases can be used including those added to air such as ozone or other oxidizing agents, or as a replacement for air.<br><br>
Air injection into the concentrate or feed stream accomplishes the following main goals :<br>
Creating and/or maintaining an air cap in the concentration chamber. The compressed air in the concentration chamber may be used to emptyor "blow down" the concentration chamber. This method is preferred to displacing the contents of the concentration chamber using large volumes of water or solution from the other sources. This decreases the amount of waste solution discharged, and thus increases the overall water recovery of the system. Using compressed air to purge the concentration chamber ensures that the concentration chamber is completely emptied.<br>
Oxygen gas at higher pressures is more reactive than oxygen gas at tower pressures. By injecting air into the system, the oxygen has a higher oxidizing potential than oxygen gas outside (is 1 atm) of the system. This allows the oxygen to oxidize a wider spectrum of metallic salts and organic materials than would otherwise be possible. These materials are removed from concentrate stream in the concentration chamber and in the inline filters and are therefore not present in the feed water to the membrane elements.<br>
The solution that is saturated with air will act as a scrubbing agent to keep the piping and membrane open areas clean. Air injection will displace less soluble or more volatile gases such as methane, hydrogen sulfide and allow for their easy removal from the solution in the air cap of the concentration chamber before the feed water reaches the membrane elements.<br>
Saturation of the solution with air also assists in the flocculation of organic constituents, metallic salts, and other contaminants in the concentration chamber thus enhancing their removal.<br>
The oxygen is mostly consumed during the above reactions, so the solution<br><br>
saturated is predominantly comprised with gases exhibiting low reactivity (such as nitrogen) is fed to the membrane elements.<br>
The saturation gases fed to the membrane elements is mostly comprised of less reactive gases (nitrogen) which will assist in maintaining the open areas of the water permeable layer in a thin film membrane, and/or pore structures in ultra-filtration or other porous membranes or thin-films or any other cross flow, or dead end filtration process as a consequence of the gases transference across the membranes and/or thin films and/or cross flow filtration and/or dead end filtration application.<br>
Since various modifications can be made in my invention as herein above described, and many apparently widely different embodiments of same made within the spirit and scope of the claims without departing from such spirit and scope, it is intended that all matter contained in the accompanying specification shall be interpreted as illustrative only and not in a limiting sense.<br><br><br><br><br>
