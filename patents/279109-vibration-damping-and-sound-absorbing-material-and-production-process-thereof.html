				<td>VIBRATION DAMPING AND SOUND ABSORBING MATERIAL AND PRODUCTION PROCESS THEREOF TECHNICAL FIELD <br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a vibration damping and sound absorbing material containing a plant-derived polyol, and a production process thereof.  Specifically, it relates to a vibration damping and sound absorbing material containing a plant component, which material can reduce environmental load and is suitable for vibration damping and sound absorbing materials used for cars and wallboards. TECHNICAL BACKGROUND <br>
[0002]Recently, plant-derived resins obtainable from plant resources have been noticed as an alternative for petroleum derived resins obtainable from petroleum resources as a raw material in viewpoint of decreasing environmental load. The plant-derived resins comprise raw materials obtainable from plants that are grown by photosynthesis while taking in CO2 in the air. Therefore, even if CO2 is exhausted by combustion treatment after use into the air, the amount of CO2 in the air is not increased in consequence.  The plant-derived resins are so-called materials which correspond to carbon neutral and contribute a decrease of environmental load.<br>
 [0003]Soft polyurethane foams have been widely used as a cushioning material, and recently, they are used as a sound absorbing material used in the fields of cars and the like. However, as conventional polyurethane foams are formed from components derived from petroleum all, the development for the polyurethane foams taking into consideration the environment, for example depression of exhaustion of petroleum resources and decrease of CO2 exhausted, has been demanded.<br>
[0004]<br>
As typical examples of polyol components used as a raw material for polyurethane foams, polyether polyol and polyester polyol derived from petroleum are known.  Furthermore, it is known to use plant-derived castor oil, castor oil type polyols which are castor oil derivatives, or soybean oil type polyols which are soybean oil derivatives.  For example, Patent document 1 discloses that aromatic diisocyanate is allowed to react with castor oil to form a prepolymer, and the prepolymer is allowed to react with water to form a polyurethane foam, and Patent document 2 discloses a process for producing a polyurethane foam by using a castor oil derivative such as hydrogenated castor oil or the like as an additive. Meanwhile, Patent document 3 discloses that an ester group-containing condensate (average molecular weight: 900 to 4500) prepared from recinoleic acid which<br>
is a main component of castor oil aliphatic acid, and mono- or more-hydric alcohol is used as an internal mold release agent in producing finely porous soft polyurethane molded articles, and Patent Document 4 discloses that a polyester polyol is used as a component of a urethane coating composition wherein the polyester polyol comprises a carboxylic acid unit (A) containing at least a part of dimer or more oxy carboxylic acid oligomer unit (a) prepared by condensation of carboxylic acids of castor oil aliphatic acid or the like, and a polyhydric alcohol unit (B). Moreover, Patent Document 5 discloses that a polyurethane foam for automobile seats is prepared by adding at least one molecule of alkylene oxide to a plant fat and oil such as castor oil or its derivative, and allowing a polyol having a hydroxyethyl group at the molecule chain end to react with an isocyanate compound. Patent Document 6 discloses that a soft polyurethane foam prepared from a polyisocyanate compound and a polyol obtainable by adding ethylene oxide/ propylene oxide to an epoxidized soybean oil which is ring opened by alcohol is used as a cushioning material for automobile seats. Patent Document 7 discloses that a polyurethane foam is produced by using a polyester polyol having a specific polyol component structure as a composition for preparing a polyurethane foam having proper hardness and impact resilience as a cushioning material and also by determining the NCO index to a specific value, and further discloses that a plant<br>
fat and oil such as castor oil aliphatic acid or the like is preferably used as a raw material for a polyester polyol.  Patent Document 8 discloses that, as a cushioning material for car seat cushioning or the like, a plat derived polyurethane foam composition is preferably used for preparing a polyurethane foam having good balance between proper hardness, impact resilience and durability.  Patent Document 9 discloses that a plant-derived polyurethane foam having excellent low impact properties, which is suitable for impact absorbing materials, sound absorbing materials and vibration damping materials, is obtainable from a polyurethane foam composition. <br>
[0005]However, the polyurethane foam described in Patent Document 1 is a hard polyurethane foam, and therefore a soft polyurethane foam having proper characteristics as a vibration damping and sound absorbing material is not obtained.  In the process of Patent Document 2, a castor oil type polyol is used as an additive and the addition amount thereof is from 0.1 to 15 % by weight based on the polyhydroxy compound. Particularly, in the example, castor oil type polyol is used in a slight amount of 5% based on all polyol components, and the effect merely shows on curing properties and low compression permanent set.  Furthermore, in Patent Documents 3 and 4, polyols having a higher molecular weight as compared with the castor oil type polyol used in Patent Document<br>
1 or 2 are used.  In Patent Document 3, this polyol is merely used as an internal mold release agent.  In Patent Document 4, the coating composition is merely disclosed.  Patent Documents 5, 6, 7 and 8 each disclose the polyurethane foam for automobile seats as the use with general expression, and do not disclose sound absorbing properties.  In Patent Document 9, the use includes cushioning materials and mattresses having excellent low impact properties, therefore vibration damping and sound absorbing materials formed from polyurethane foams having vibration damping and sound absorbing properties cannot be obtained. <br>
[0006]That is to say, vibration damping and sound absorbing materials containing a plant-derived polyol and having excellent vibration damping and sound absorbing properties cannot be obtained by the processes disclosed in these patent documents. Patent Document 1: Specification in USP 2787601 Patent Document 2: JP-A-H5-59144 Patent Document 3: JP-A-S61-91216 Patent Document 4: JP-A-H11-166155 Patent Document 5: JP-A-2005-320437 Patent Document 6: JP-A-2005-320431 Patent Document 7: JP-A-2006-2145 Patent Document 8: WO-2007/020904 Al Patent Document 9: WO-2007/020905 Al<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION OBJECT OF THE INVENTION [0007]<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a vibration damping and sound absorbing material containing a plant-derived polyol which material largely contributes a decrease of environmental load and has excellent vibration damping and sound absorbing properties, and it is another object of the invention to provide a production process of the material.<br>

[Vibration damping and sound absorbing material]<br>

[0023]<br>
Since the vibration damping and sound absorbing material of the present invention can have excellent properties for cars and wallboards, particularly cars and also is prepared using a plant-derived material, it can greatly contribute a decrease of environmental load corresponding to the social order of the day toward global environmental preservation. Examples of the use for cars may include car dash silencers, and car interior materials such as, floor mats, ceiling materials and the like.<br>
 [0024]The vibration damping and sound absorbing material of the present invention can be used in a two-layer structure or a multi-layer structure by combining with a high specific gravity surface material (vinyl chloride resin, olefin resin or the like) . Examples of the two-layer structure may include vibration damping and sound absorbing material/surface material, or surface material/ vibration damping and sound absorbing material. Examples of the multi-layer structure may include surface material/ vibration damping and sound absorbing material/ surface material, and the like.<br>

[0026]<br>
<br>
The plant-derived polyol (A) used in the present invention is a polyol prepared by using a raw material prepared from a plant. Examples of the plant-derived polyol may include castor oil, a<br>
derivative thereof and a soybean derivative. These plant-derived polyols may be used singly, or two or more of them may be combined for use.<br>
[0027]<br>
Examples of castor oil and a derivative thereof may include castor oil, hydrogenated castor oil, a polyester polyol prepared from castor oil aliphatic acid condensate, a polyester polyol prepared from a hydrogenated castor oil aliphatic acid condensate, and a mixture thereof.<br>
[0028]<br>
Examples of the soybean derivative may include hydroxylated soybean oil, and a polyester polyol prepared from a hydroxylated soybean oil and fat condensate.<br>
[0029]<br>
Preferable examples of the plant-derived polyol (A) may include the following plant-derived polyester polyols (Al) to<br>
(A6) .<br>
[0030]<br>
(Plant-derived polyester polyol (Al))<br>
The plant-derived polyester polyol (Al) is a polyester polyol having a structure such that a hydroxy carboxylic acid having 15 or more carbon atoms obtainable from a plant oil such as castor oil, soybean oil and the like is condensed in an amount of preferably 1 to 15 mol, more preferably 1 to 10 mol based on<br>
 <br>
1 mol of a polyhydric alcohol having 2 to 6 hydroxyl groups in one molecule.<br>
[0031](Plant-derived polyester polyol (A2))<br>
The plant-derived polyester polyol  (A2)  is a polyol obtainable by adding lactone to the plant-derived polyester polyol<br>
(Al) .<br>
[0032]<br>
(Plant-derived polyester polyol (A3))<br>
The plant-derived polyester polyol (A3) is a polyol obtainable by adding a hydroxycarboxylic acid having a primary hydroxyl group to the plant-derived polyester polyol (Al).<br>
[0033]<br>
(Plant-derived polyester polyol (A4))<br>
The plant-derived polyester polyol (A4) is a polyester polyol having a structure such that a castor oil aliphatic acid containing, as a main component, a ricinoleic acid obtainable from castor oil and/or a hydroxycarboxylic acid containing hydrogenated castor oil aliphatic acid containing, as a main component, 12-hydroxystearic acid obtainable by saturating a carbon-carbon double bond in the castor oil aliphatic acid are condensed in amounts of preferably 1 to 15 mol, more preferably 1 to 10 mol, per 1 mol of polyhydric alcohol having 2 to 6 hydroxyl groups in one molecule.  It is unfavorable that the amounts of<br>
the castor oil aliphatic acid and/or the hydroxycarboxylic acid<br>
are over 15 mol, because the expanding action of a urethane foam<br>
obtained is apt to be unstable.<br>
[0034]<br>
(Plant-derived polyester polyol (A5))<br>
The plant-derived polyester polyol  (A5)  is a polyol obtainable by adding lactone to the plant-derived polyester polyol (A4) . [0035] (Plant-derived polyester polyol (A6))<br>
The plant-derived polyester polyol (A4) is a polyol obtainable by adding a hydroxycarboxylic acid having a primary hydroxyl group to the plant-derived polyester polyol (A4). [0036]<br>
These plant-derived polyester polyols may be used singly, or two or more of them may be combined for use. <br>
[0037]Using the plant-derived polyester polyol having the condensed proportion of a hydroxycarboxylic acid having 15 or more carbon atoms in the above range per polyhydric alcohol, a vibration damping and sound absorbing material formed from a polyurethane foam having excellent sound absorbing properties can be formed.<br>
 [0038]<br>
Furthermore, it is possible to also use a polyol having a structure such that a hydroxycarboxylic acid having 15 or more carbon atoms is condensed to an oil and fat having a hydroxyl group such as castor oil and the like. <br>
[0039]Among the above polyhydric alcohols, examples of the polyhydric alcohol having 2 to 6 hydroxyl groups in one molecule are dihydric alcohols having 2 to 10 carbon atoms such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, 1,3-propane diol, 1,3-butane diol, 1,4-butane diol, 1,6-hexane diol and 1,4-cyclohexane diol; trihydric alcohols having 2 to 10 carbon atoms such as trimethylol propane and glycerin; tetrahydric alcohols such as diglycerin, pentaerythritol and a-methyl glucoside; hexahydric alcohols such as dipentaerythritol and the like; sugars such as glucose, sorbitol and fructose, and derivatives thereof; and phenols having 2 to 6 hydroxyl groups such as bisphenol A. Examples of the polyhydric alcohols having 7 or more hydroxyl groups in one molecule are sugars such as sucrose and the like, and derivatives thereof; and phenols having 7 or more hydroxyl groups . Furthermore, it is possible to use alkylene oxide adducts of polyhydric alcohols obtainable by adding ethylene oxide or propylene oxide to these polyhydric alcohols.  These<br>
polyhydric alcohols can be used singly, or two or more of them<br>
can be mixed for use.<br>
[0040]Since in the case of using the polyhydric alcohols having 2 to 10 hydroxyl groups in one molecule, a vibration damping and sound absorbing material having a minute cell structure can be prepared, the maximum sound absorbing coefficient determined by sound absorbing coefficient measurement described later becomes a high value and a vibration damping and sound absorbing material having excellent sound absorbing properties can be prepared. On this account, it can be favorably used to vibration damping and sound absorbing materials for cars and wallboards, particularly, car dash silencers, and car interior materials such as floor mats, ceiling materials and the like. [0041]<br>
As the hydroxyl carboxylic acid having 15 or more carbon atoms obtainable from the above plant oils, saturated or unsaturated aliphatic acids having a hydroxyl group or hydrogenation products of the unsaturated aliphatic acid are preferably used, and among them, aliphatic acids having 15 to 20 carbon atoms are preferably used.  Moreover, of these, saturated or unsaturated aliphatic acid having a hydroxyl group taken from natural oils and fats such as castor oil, Dimorphotheca oil, Lesquerella oil and Lesquerella densipila seed oil, and<br>
hydrogenation products of the unsaturated aliphatic acids are preferable, and particularly, aliphatic acids containing, as a main component, ricinolic acid and 12-hydroxystearic acid are preferable. Furthermore, it is also possible to use aliphatic acid obtainable by hydroxylating an unsaturated aliphatic acid having no hydroxyl group such as oleic acid and linolenic acid, taken from soybean oil, olive oil, rice bran oil and palm oil, and a hydroxylated plant oil aliphatic acid such as hydroxylated soybean oil aliphatic acid and the like, taken after hydroxylation of soybean oil.<br>
[0042]<br>
In the case that the above hydroxycarboxylic acid is condensed with the above polyhydric alcohol, after condensing the hydroxy carboxylic acid, the resulting polycondensed product may be condensed with the polyhydric alcohol, or after condensing the polyhydric alcohol with the hydroxycarboxylic acid, the hydroxycarboxylic acid may be condensed.<br>
[0043]<br>
Examples of the lactones are ß-lactones such as ß-propiolactone and the like; -lactones such as -butyrolactone and the like; δ-lactones such as δ-valerolactone and the like; and ε-lactones such as ε-caprolactone and the like. ß-propiolactone and ε-caprolactone are preferable.<br>
 [0044]<br>
Examples of the hydroxycarboxylic acid having a primary hydroxyl group are ring opened products of the above lactones such as 3-hydroxypropionic acid and the like. <br>
[0045]In addition to the above-described raw materials, raw materials obtainable from plants can be widely used for the plant-derived polyol (A) . Examples thereof are glucoses obtainable from starches, and derivative thereof such as lactic acid, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, succinic acid, 1,4-butane diol, and their mixtures and derivatives.  Further examples thereof are cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and their derivatives, obtainable from wood, or sebacic acid that is a derivative of castor oil aliphatic acid, and its derivatives. [0046]<br>
Moreover, as the plant-derived polyols (A), polyols obtainable by adding propylene oxide and/or ethylene oxide to the plant-derived polyester polyols (Al) to (A6) can be also used. [0047]<br>
Additionally, as the plant-derived polyols (A), plant-derived prepolymers having a hydroxyl group at the end obtainable by reacting the plant-derived polyester polyols (Al) to (A6) with polyisocyanates can be also used.  The polyisocyanates used in the prepolymers are not limited<br>
particularly.  It is possible to preferably use conventionally known tolylenediisocyanates (the proportion of isomers such as 2,4-form to 2,6-form is not particularly limited, and further it is preferred to use tolylenediisocyanate having a proportion of 2,4-form and 2,6-form of 80/20), diphenylmethane diisocyanate, polymethylene polyphenyl polyisocyanate, and a mixture of tolylenediisocyanate and polymethylene polyphenyl polyisocyanate.  It is further possible to preferably use urethane modified products and carbodiimide modified products of these polyisocyanates, and mixtures of these products and tolylenediisocyanate.<br>
[0048]<br>
In the present invention, the plant-derived polyol (A) has an acid value of preferably less than 10 mgKOH/g, more preferably less than 8 mgKOH/g, especially less than 5 mg KOH/g. It is not favorable that the acid value is too high, because the reaction rate in urethane expanding is lowered significantly and thereby the productivity is also lowered.<br>
[0049]<br>
The plant-derived polyol (A) has a hydroxyl group value of preferably from 30 to 200 mgKOH/g, more preferably 65 to 170 mgKOH/g.<br>
When the hydroxyl group value is 65 to 170 mgKOH/g, the expanding action can be more stabilized and thus cells constituting a<br>
urethane foam can be densified.  Therefore, a vibration damping and sound absorbing material having sufficiently low gas permeability can be prepared, and thereby the maximum sound absorbing coefficient as determined by measurement of the sound absorbing coefficient described later becomes a high value.  Thus, a vibration damping and sound absorbing material having excellent sound absorbing properties can be prepared. Accordingly, it can be favorably used to vibration damping and sound absorbing materials for cars and wallboards, particularly, for car dash silencers, and car interior materials such as floor mats and ceiling materials.<br>

The process for producing the vibration damping and sound absorbing material by the cold cure mold foam method via the resin premix preparation step is a process such that a resin premix and polyisocyanate are mixed in a certain proportion using the high pressure foaming machine or the low pressure foaming machine to prepare a mixed solution, the mixed solution is injected into a mold previously heated at a temperature of 30 to 80°C, reacted and foamed, and then cured and mold released, and consequently an aimed product having a definite form (vibration damping and sound absorbing material) can be prepared. The resin premix is a previously mixed one obtainable by mixing the polyol and/or the polymer dispersed polyol wherein the polyol is at least a<br>
plant-derived polyol prepared using a raw material prepared from plants, with water, the catalyst, and optionally the foaming agent, the crosslinking agent and the foam stabilizer. To the resin premix, it is possible to further add a flame retardant, a pigment, a ultraviolet absorber and an oxidation inhibitor as other assistants.<br>

size tube (inner diameter 100 mm), and the sound absorbing coefficient at 2000 to 6000 Hz was measured by a small size tube (inner diameter 29 mm) . Concerning the sound absorbing coefficients determined by these measurements, the sound absorbing properties are more excellent with increasing the sound absorbing coefficient. In the case that the sound is absorbed completely, the coefficient is 1.0. The vibration damping and sound absorbing material of the present invention desirably has the maximum sound absorbing coefficient of not less than 0.70, preferably not less than 0.80, more preferably not less than 0.90.
