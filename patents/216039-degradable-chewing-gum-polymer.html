				<td>DEGRADABLE CHEWING GUM POLYMER<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a degradable chewing gum polymer and chewing<br>
gum incorporating the same.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
US patent 5,672,367 discloses a biodegradable elastomer for chewing gum. The<br>
elastomers are generally defined as biodegradable polyester polymers obtained by<br>
the polymerization of one or more cyclic esters. Two specific examples are<br>
described.<br>
Example 1 describes an amorphous, non-crystallizable copolymer of a polymer of 80<br>
mol % L-lactide and 20 mol % D-lactide that was prepared by ring-opening<br>
polymerization in the melt, in the presence of 0,1% by weight tin octoate as a<br>
catalyst. To this polymer was added an amount of 20% by weight of epsilon-<br>
caprolactone, and subsequently the mixture was heated to 150°C. To the<br>
homogeneous mixture, again 0,1% by weight tin octoate as catalyst was added and<br>
then the polymerization was completed. The obtained polymer had a glass transition<br>
temperature (DSC, heating rate 10°C/min) of 15°C.<br>
Example 3 describes an amorphous, non-crystallizable copolymer of 25 mol % L-<br>
lactide, 25 mol % D-lactide and 50 mol % epsilon-caprolactone that was prepared by<br>
ring-opening polymerization in the melt, in the presence of 0,1% by weight tin<br>
octoate as catalyst. The obtained polymer has a glass transition temperature (DSC,<br>
heating rate 10°C/min) of -10°C<br>
Both exemplified polymers is stated to feature a chew feel strongly resembling that<br>
of conventional chewing gum.<br><br>
However, a disadvantage of the above mentioned polymers is that the properties of<br>
the provided polymers differ from conventional chewing gum elastomers for<br>
example with respect to the texture of the polymers itself and especially when<br>
incorporated in conventional chewing gum formulations.<br>
WO 01/47368 discloses a chewing gum comprising a degradable copolymer obtained<br>
by polymerization of two different monomers, one first monomer which is<br>
polymerizable by condensation polymerization and one monomer functional to<br>
suppress the crystallinity of the copolymer. A problem of the disclosed copolymer is<br>
however for example that the elastomeric properties of the resulting copolymer differ<br>
when compared to properties of conventional chewing gum. Consequently, it appears<br>
very difficult to obtain a completely biodegradable chewing gum based on the<br>
disclosed copolymer illustrated by the fact that the examples only disclose partly<br>
biodegradable chewing gum.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a chewing gum polymer having properties<br>
comparable to those of conventional chewing gum elastomers both with respect to<br>
the polymer itself and with respect to the interaction with the chewing gum<br>
ingredients when incorporated in a chewing gum formulation.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a degradable chewing gum polymer, wherein said<br>
degradable polymer being a polymer polymerized from<br>
at least two different monomers such as herein described forming the backbone of<br>
the polymer and<br>
at least one monomer selected from the group of carbonate monomers, in the<br>
presence of at least one trifunctional or higher functional initiator, such as herein<br>
described.<br><br>
According to the invention, the obtained polymer has elastomeric properties suitable<br>
for chewing gum.<br>
According to the invention, a polymer structure being very suitable as chewing<br>
polymer/elastomer has been obtained.<br>
According to the invention it has been realized that a certain degree of branching of<br>
the backbone is needed to obtain a final improved performance, when the polymer,<br>
preferably the elastomer, is incorporated in a chewing gum. It has moreover been<br>
realized that the obtained branching needs to be carefully controlled in order to avoid<br>
too much branching-induced crosslinking.<br>
According to the invention, it has surprisingly been realized that this balance<br>
between branching/cross-linking may be controlled by a suitable pairing of initiator<br>
and carbonate monomer. Such pairing includes among the most significant "control<br>
knobs" the mutual concentration of the initiator versus the carbonate monomer.<br>
Moreover, the mutual concentration may be modified under consideration of the<br>
structure of the initiator. The higher functional initiator, the lower concentration of<br>
the carbonate monomer.<br>
According to the invention, the term hyperbranched preferably indicates that the<br>
branching structure is dendritic rather than comb-like. That is, branches extend from<br>
other branches, like a tree, rather than many simple branches extending from a well-<br>
defined backbone segment (comb-like branching). Hence, hyperbranching may be<br>
understood as "branching of a dendritic nature." Branching in this system is an<br>
intermediate stage leading to crossslinking. The molecules first become branched,<br>
and then when a branch from one molecule reacts with a branch of another molecule,<br>
a crosslink is formed. At intermediate stages within this process, branched and<br>
crosslinked molecules coexist. The man of ordinary skill in the art will understand<br>
branching and crosslinking and the difference between dendritic and comb-like<br>
branching. A good description of dendritic branching compared to other types of<br><br>
branching can be found in the following textbook:<br>
Odian, G. "Principles of Polymerization," 3rd Ed., Wiley-Interscience,<br>
New York, NY (1991); p. 17.<br>
Preferably said at least two different monomers are cyclic.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the at least two different monomers forming the<br>
backbone of the polymer comprise at least one backbone monomer and a at least one<br>
backbone comonomer.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the at least one backbone comonomer imparts<br>
disorder in the backbone monomer chain.<br>
According to the invention, it has been realized that the backbone chain comprises at<br>
least two different monomers.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the at least one backbone comonomer is effective<br>
to introduce amorpheus regions in the backbone monomer chain.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the at least two different monomers forming the<br>
backbone of the polymer are selected from the group of lactone monomers.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the lactone monomers are chosen from the group<br>
of ?-caprolactone, ?-valerolactone, ?-butyrolactone, and ?-propiolactone. It also<br>
includes ?-caprolactones, ?-valerolactones, ?-butyrolactones, or ?-propiolactones that<br>
have been substituted with one or more alkyl or aryl substituents at any non-carbonyl<br>
carbon atoms along the ring, including compounds in which two substituents are<br>
contained on the same carbon atom.<br>
Examples of the lactones described above are, but not limited to, -caprolactone, t-<br>
butyl caprolactone, zeta-enantholactone, deltavalerolactones, the monoalkyl-delta-<br><br>
valerolactones, e. g. the monomethyl-, monoethyl-, monohexyl-deltavalerolactones,<br>
and the like; the nonalkyl, dialkyl, and trialkyl-epsilon-caprolactones, e. g. the<br>
monomethyl-, monoethyl-, monohexyl-, dimethyl-, di-n-propyl-, di-nhexyl-,<br>
trimethyl-, triethyl-, tri-n-epsilon-caprolactones, 5-nonyloxepan-2-one, 4, 4, 6- or 4,<br>
6, 6-trimethyl-oxepan-2-one, 5-hydroxymethyloxepan-2-one, and the like; beta-<br>
lactones, e. g., beta-propiolactone, beta-butyrolactone gamma-lactones, e. g.,<br>
gammabutyrolactone or pivalolactone, dilactones, e. g. lactide, dilactides, glycolides,<br>
e. g., tetramethyl glycolides, and the like, ketodioxanones, e. g. 1, 4-dioxan-2one, 1,<br>
5-dioxepan-2-one, and the like. The lactones can consist of the optically pure isomers<br>
or two or more optically different isomers or can consist of mixtures of isomers.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the at least one backbone monomer comprises s-<br>
caprolactone<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention s-caprolactone is chosen as<br>
the main monomer of the backbone, thereby ensuring that the main component of the<br>
backbone features a sufficiently low Tg.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the at least one backbone monomer has a Tg<br>
below -40°C, preferably less than -50°C.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the at least one backbone comonomer comprises<br>
?-valerolactone.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention 8-valerolactone forms a<br>
suitable backbone comonomer. Moreover, it has been realized that the requirements<br>
with respect to a low Tg may be somewhat relaxed, when compared to the<br>
constraints on the main backbone monomer.<br>
Evidently, it should be noted that the Tg of the comonomer or comonomers becomes<br>
more significant with increasing concentration.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention said degradable polymer is polymerized by metal<br>
catalyzed ring-opening.<br>
Preferably the carbonate monomer is selected from the group of trimethylene<br>
carbonate, 5-alkyl-l,3-dioxan-2-one, 5,5-dialkyl-l,3-dioxan-2-one, or 5-alkyl-5-<br>
alkyloxycarbonyl-l,3-dioxan-2-one.<br>
Examples of suitable cyclic carbonates are ethylene carbonate, 3-ethyl-3-<br>
hydroxymethyl trimethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, trimethylene carbonate,<br>
trimethylolpropane monocarbonate, 4,6dimethyl-l, 3-propylene carbonate, 2, 2-<br>
dimethyl trimethylene carbonate, and 1, 3-dioxepan-2-one and mixtures thereof.<br>
According to the invention several different carboner monomers may be applied. The<br>
preferred carbonate monomer is trimethylene carbonate (TMC).<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the at least one monomer selected from the group<br>
of carbonate monomers provides a means for introducing additional branching and/or<br>
crosslinking to the elastomeric polymer during ring-opening polymerization.<br>
According to the invention cyclic carbonate in the monomer mixture yields precise<br>
control over the degree of branching and crosslinking in the final polymer. The<br>
mechanism by which the cyclic carbonate monomer imparts crosslinking is based<br>
upon the known tendency for metal catalysts, of which stannous octoate is a non-<br>
limiting example, to promote transesterification and transcarbonation reactions<br>
(intermolecular chain transfer to polymer) during polymerization.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said at least one polyol comprises a trifunctional<br>
or higher functional initiator.<br>
According to the invention, the interaction between the polyol initiator and the<br>
carbonate monomer provides the desired branching of the resulting biodegradable<br>
polymer.<br><br>
Another aspect of the present invention is directed to the production of star polymers.<br>
Examples of advantageous multifunctional initiators are, but not limited to glycerol,<br>
trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, ethoxylated or propoxylated<br>
polyamines and other molecules with multiple hydroxyl or other reactive groups and<br>
other molecules with multiple hydroxyl or other reactive groups and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the preferred initiators arc<br>
trimethylolpropane and pentaerythritol.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the degradable chewing gum polymer is<br>
polymerized from:<br>
about 20 to 80 wt % of the at least one backbone monomer,<br>
about 19.5 to 79.5 wt % of the at least one backbone comonomer,<br>
about 0.5 to 25 wt % of the at least one monomer selected from the group of<br>
carbonate monomers.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the degradable chewing gum polymer is moreover<br>
polymerized from:<br>
About 0.01 to 1.0 wt % of the at least one initiator<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the chewing gum properties of the polymer are<br>
adjusted by selection of a suitable order of the multifunctional initiator.<br>
The more functional initiator, the less carbonate for the purpose of generating the<br>
desired amount of hyperbranching and crosslinking.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention the Theological properties of the degradable<br>
polymer are controlled by adjusting the functional number of initiators.<br>
Moreover, it has been realized that an increase in the functionality of the initiator<br>
results in an improved texture and/or improved release of chewing gum ingredients<br>
when the polymer is incorporated in a chewing gum.<br>
The molecular weight of lactone monomerer must be within the range of 50-16000<br>
g/mol preferably within the range of 100-3000 g/mol<br>

Detailed description<br>
The following examples of the invention are non-limiting and only provided for the<br>
purpose of explaining the invention.<br>
Unless otherwise indicated, as used herein, the term "molecular weight" means<br>
number average molecular weight (Mn).<br>
It has surprisingly been found that biodegradable elastomers, suitable for the<br>
formulation of chewing gum base, can be made by metal-catalyzed ring-opening<br>
polymerization using a combination of an initiator comprising a trifunctional or<br>
higher polyol and a mixture of cyclic monomers including lactones and at least one<br>
cyclic carbonate monomer. These polymers derive their excellent elastomeric<br>
properties from the fact that they are non-crystallizable polymers with a glass<br>
transition temperature below room temperature, and they are hyperbranched or<br>
lightly crosslinked materials, which characteristic imparts excellent elasticity and<br>
recovery.<br>
The various monomers are strategically selected to impart specific properties to the<br>
polymers of the invention. The requirement of non-crystallizability is achieved<br>
through the use of two or more monomers that can enter the polymer chain in an<br>
approximately random sequence, thus imparting disorder along the backbone.<br>
Crystallization is also hindered by the branch point introduced by the trifunctional or<br>
higher polyol initiator. The monomer representing the major component of the<br>
backbone, which should also possess a very low homopolymer glass transition<br>
temperature, is selected from the family of aliphatic lactones, with s-caprolactone<br>
being a non-limiting example. The comonomer or comonomers used to impart<br>
disorder should also be selected from the family of aliphatic lactones, but must be<br>
different from the major-component monomer. A representative but non-limiting<br>
example of a monomer suitable for use with the major-component monomer is 8-<br>
valerolactone.<br><br>
The critical, and perhaps most surprising discovery of the invention is that the<br>
addition of a small proportion of a carbonate monomer, of which l,3-dioxan-2-one<br>
(trimethylene carbonate) is a non-limiting example, provides a means for introducing<br>
additional branching and/or crosslinking to the elastomeric polymer during ring-<br>
opening polymerization. In fact, the level of cyclic carbonate in the monomer<br>
mixture yields precise control over the degree of branching and crosslinking in the<br>
final polymer. The mechanism by which the cyclic carbonate monomer imparts<br>
crosslinking is based upon the known tendency for metal catalysts, of which stannous<br>
octoate is a non-limiting example, to promote transesterification and<br>
transcarbonation reactions (intermolecular chain transfer to polymer) during<br>
polymerization.<br>
A transcarbonation reaction during stannous octoate-catalyzed ring-opening<br>
polymerization of lactone and carbonate monomers is illustrated in the fig. 1.<br>
This mechanism is shown in the figures. Fig. 1 illustrate three-arm star polymer<br>
molecules produced from a trifunctional polyol initiator (I) such as<br>
trimethylolpropane. The backbone of these polymers is composed of randomly<br>
incorporated s-caprolactone and trimethylene carbonate mer units, and the ends of<br>
each arm carry either a polymerization-active stannyl ether group as illustrated in (1)<br>
or a polymerization-inactive hydroxyl group as illustrated in (2). Tranesterification<br>
(transcarbonation) involves reaction of the stannyl ether group of one chain with an<br>
internal ester (carbonate) linkage of another chain. In (3) a transcarbonation reaction<br>
between species illustrated (1) and (2) has been obtained, thereby creating the<br>
intermediate (3). The latter can decompose to yield two different products because<br>
the carbonate linkage has two different acyl-oxygen bonds that may be broken. The<br>
decomposition pathway pictured in the figure illustrated scheme is the one of interest<br>
because it yields a new species (4) in which two initiator branch points have become<br>
connected. This species represents the very early stages of hyperbranching. As<br>
similar reactions take place, more and more branching occurs and the system<br>
eventually becomes crosslinked. The degree of crosslinking depends upon the<br><br>
fractional loading of the cyclic carbonate monomer and the polymerization<br>
conversion. The alternate decomposition pathway not pictured does not lead to<br>
branching and crosslinking. Also, in the absence of a carbonate monomer, branching<br>
and crosslinking do not take place.<br>
(5) represents the remaining not-branched copolymer<br>
The trifunctional or higher polyol initiators useful in the present invention include<br>
glycerol, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol and ethoxylated or<br>
propoxylated polyamines. The preferred initiators are trimethylolpropane and<br>
pentaerythritol.<br>
The monomer representing the major component of the backbone, and the<br>
comonomer or comonomers used to impart disorder may be chosen from the same<br>
group. This group includes ?-caprolactone, ?-valerolactone, ?-butyrolactone, and ?-<br>
propiolactone. It also includes ?-caprolactones, ?-valerolactones, ?-butyrolactones,<br>
or ?-propiolactones that have been substituted with one or more alkyl or aryl<br>
substituents at any non-carbonyl carbon atoms along the ring, including compounds<br>
in which two substituents are contained on the same carbon atom. The preferred<br>
major component monomer is ?-caprolactone. The preferred comonomer is ?-<br>
valerolactone.<br>
The carbonate monomers useful in the present invention include trimethylene<br>
carbonate, 5-alkyl-l,3-dioxan-2-one, 5,5-dialkyl-l,3-dioxan-2-one, or 5-alkyl-5-<br>
alkyloxycarbonyl-l,3-dioxan-2-one. The preferred carbonate monomer is<br>
trimethylene carbonate.<br>
In general, the level of crosslinking and the level of hyperbranching would scale<br>
approximately the same, that is, if one were high or low, so would the other one be.<br>
In general the larger is the ratio carbonate monomer/initiator, the higher the level of<br>
hyperbranching and crosslinking.<br><br>
During polymerization at high temperature, a small fraction of the polymer chains<br>
contains catalyst as a part of their structure. The catalyst is transferred from chain to<br>
chain in a rapid chemical equilibrium. After polymerization, upon cooling and after<br>
polymer workup, the catalyst is believed to not be part of the polymer structure.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preparation of resin<br>
A resin sample was produced using a cylindrical glass, jacketed 10 L pilot reactor<br>
equipped with glass stir shaft and Teflon stir blades and bottom outlet. Heating of<br>
the reactor contents was accomplished by circulation of silicone oil, thermostated to<br>
130°C, through the outer jacket. D,L-lactide (4.877 kg, 33.84 mol) was charged to<br>
the reactor and melted by heating to 140°C for 6 h. After the D,L-lactide was<br>
completely molten, the temperature was reduced to 130°C, and stannous octoate<br>
(1.79 g, 4.42 x 10-3 mol), 1,2-propylene glycol (79.87 g, 1.050 mol), and ?-<br>
caprolactone (290.76 g, 2.547 mol) were charged to the reactor. After the mixture<br>
became homogeneous, stirring was continued for 24 h at 130°C. At the end of this<br>
time, the bottom outlet was opened, and molten polymer was allowed to drain into a<br>
Teflon-lined paint can.<br>
Characterization of the product indicated Mn = 5,700 g/mol and Mw = 7,100 g/mol<br>

% (w/v) solution of in MeCh) were charged under dry N2 gas purge. The MeCl2 was<br>
allowed to evaporate under the N2 purge for 15 min. Then ?-caprolactone (274 g,<br>
2.40 mol), TMC (49g, 0.48 mol), and ?-valerolactone (192 g, 1.92 mol) were added.<br>
The resin kettle was submerged in a 130°C constant-temperature oil bath and stirred<br>
for 14 h. Subsequently the kettle was removed from the oil bath and allowed to cool<br>
to room temperature. The solid, elastic product was removed in small pieces using a<br>
knife, and placed into a plastic container.<br><br>
Characterization of the product indicated Mn = 72,400 g/mol and Mw = 103,300<br>
g/mol (gel permeation chromatography with online MALLS detector) and Tg = -<br>
66°C (DSC, heating rate 10°C/min).<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Preparation of HMWE made with 4-arms starshaped initiator<br>
A HMWE sample according to the invention was synthesized in a dry N2 glove box,<br>
as follows. Into a 500 mL resin kettle equipped with overhead mechanical stirrer<br>
was charged 0.037 g Sn(Oct)2 (3.4 ml of a 1.10% (w/v) solution in methylene<br>

temperature oil bath and stirred for 14 h. Subsequently the kettle was removed from<br>
the oil bath and allowed to cool at room temperature. The solid, elastic product was<br>
removed in small pieces using a knife, and placed into a plastic container.<br>
Characterization of the product indicated Mn = 64,600 g/mol and Mw = 165,200<br>
g/mol (gel permeation chromatography with online MALLS detector) and Tg = -<br>
66°C (DSC, heating rate 10°C/min).<br>

Ingredients Percent by weight<br><br><br><br>
Table 1: Gumbase preparation<br>
The gumbases are prepared as follows:<br>
HMWE elastomer is added to a mixing kettle provided with mixing means like e.g.<br>
horizontally placed Z-shaped arms. The kettle had been preheated for 15 minuttes to<br>
a tempearture of about 60-80°C. The rubber is broken into small pieces and softened<br>
with mechanical action on the kettle.<br>
The resin is slowly added to the elastomer until the mixture becomes homogeneous.<br>
The remaining resin is then added to the ketttle and mized for 10-20 minutes. The<br>
LMWE elastomer is added and mixed for 20-40 minutes until the whole mixture<br>
becomes homogeneous.<br>
The mixture is then discharged into the pan and allowed to cool to room temperature<br>
from the discharged temperature of 60-80°C, or the gumbase mixture is used directly<br>
for chewing gum by adding all chewing gum components in an appropriate order<br>
under continuous mixing.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br><br>
Preparation of Chewing gum<br>

Table 2: Peppermint chewing gum preparation<br><br><br><br><br>
Table 3: Strawberry chewing gum preparation<br>
The chewing gum products are prepared as follows:<br>
The gumbase is added to a mixing kettle provided with mixing means like e.g.<br>
horizontally placed Z-shaped arms. The kettle had been preheated for 15 minutes to a<br>
temperature of about 60-80°C. Or the chewing gum is one step, immediately after<br>
preparation of gumbase in the same mixer where the gum base and kettle have a<br>
temperature of about 60-80°C.<br>
Mint formulation:<br>
One third portion of the sorbitol is added together with the gum base and mixed for<br>
1-2 minutes. Another one third portion of the sorbitol and lycasin is then added to the<br>
kettle and mixed for 2 minutes. The remaining one third portion of sorbitol,<br>
peppermint and menthol are added and mixed for 2 minutes. Then aspartame and<br>
acesulfame are added to the kettle and mixed for 3 minutes. Xylitol is added and<br>
mixed for 3 minutes. The resulting gum mixture is then discharged and e.g.<br>
transfered to a pan at temperature of 40-48°C. The gum is then rolled and scored into<br>
cores, sticks, balls, cubes, and nay other desired shape, optionally followed by<br>
coating and polishing processes prior to packaging.<br><br>
Strawberry formulation:<br>
One third portion of the sorbitol is added together with the gum base and mixed for<br>

added to the kettle and mixed for 2 minutes. The remaining one third portion of<br>
sorbitol, strawberry and acids are added and mixed for 2 minutes. Then aspartame<br>
and acesulfame are added to the kettle and mixed for 3 minutes. Xylitol is added and<br>
mixed for 3 minutes. The resulting gum mixture is then discharged and e.g.<br>
transffered to a pan at temperature of 40-48°C. The gum is then rolled and scored<br>
into cores, sticks, balls, cubes, and any other desired shape, optionally followed by<br>
coating and polishing processes prior to packaging.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
An experiment was set up in order to test if the 4-arms starshaped HMWE elastomer<br>
has a closer reological match, to conventional HMWE elastomer e.g. polyisobutylene<br>
or butylrubber, compared with a HMWE elastomer made with a difunctional<br>
initiator.<br>
Accordingly, the following rheological parameters were measured using a<br>
rheometer, type AR1000 from TA Instruments. The oscillation measurement is<br>
performed at a stress within the linear viscoelastic region and a temperature of 130°C<br>
with a parallel plate system (d=2.0 cm, hatched). G", and tan delta vs. shear rate.<br>
The results are summarised in fig.2, 3 and as it appears, the elasticity of the<br>
elastomer made with 4-arms star shaped initiator was much closer to the<br>
conventional elastomer than the elastomer with a difunctional initiator. The same<br>
appears when looking at storage modulus G".<br><br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
An experiment was set up in order to test gumbases, prepared according to<br>
EXAMPLE 5, containing the same elastomers decribed in EXAMPLE 7.<br>
Thus, a standard gum base containing 20% HMWE PIB (sample 101, table 1) was<br>
compared with a gum base containing 20 % HMWE elastomer made with<br>
difiinctional initiator (sample 102, table 1) and a gum base containing 20 % HMWE<br>
elastomer made with 4-arms star shaped initiator (sample 103, table 1). Accordingly,<br>
the following rheological parameters G" and tan delta vs. shear rate at 130°C were<br>
measured using the method and rheometer described in the previous example.<br>
The results are summarised in fig.4 and 5 and as it appears, the gumbase containing<br>
the star-shaped elastomer (103) gives a closer rheological match to the gumbase<br>
containing conventional elastomers (101) compared to gumbase containing elastomer<br>
made with a diol initiator (102).<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
Chewing profile<br>
An experiment was set up in order to test the corresponding chewing gum samples to<br>
the gum bases described in EXAMPLE 8. Prepared as described in EXAMPLE 6.<br>
In order to test the chewing profile of the chewing gum samples containing the gum<br>
bases with star shaped biodegradable elastomer, difunctional elastomer and std<br>
(samples 1003, 1002 and 1001, respectively). The gum centres were chewed in a<br>
chewing machine (CF Jansson). The chewing frequency was set to 1 Hz, a pH buffer<br>
was used as saliva and the temperature was set at 37°C. The chewing time was set to<br>
15 seconds, 30 seconds, 60 seconds and 120 seconds. After chewing, the chewed cud<br><br>
was measured on a rheometer, described in EXAMPLE 7 as oscillation<br>
measurements at a temperature of 37°C.<br>
The results from these measurements can be seen on fig. 6,7, 8 and 9 wherein the<br>
storage modulus (G") versus oscillation torque is depicted at different chewing times<br>
illustrating the texture changes during chewing.<br>
From fig. 6 it can be seen that while the two chewing gum formulations containing<br>
elastomers made from difunctional star shaped initiator (1002) and from multi star<br>
shaped initiator (1003) are somewhat softer in the initial phase, after 30 seconds, see<br>
fig. 7, the standard (1001) is getting closer to the two others and the sample 1003 is<br>
now closer to standard compared with 1002.<br>
As illustrated in fig 8 the difference between the three samples is similar to the<br>
difference illustrated in fig. 7 after 60 seconds. After 120 seconds, see fig. 9, the<br>
difference is smaller, and the values measured on sample 1003 are still closest to the<br>
standard formulation 1003.<br>
The above rheological results are confirming the fact that the elastomer made with 4-<br>
arms star shaped initiator has texture properties closer to conventional elastomers as<br>
compared to elastomer made with difunctional initiator, also as a function of time.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
Sensory texture profile analyses of test chewing gum<br>
The three chewing gum samples were tested by serving them to the sensory panellists<br>
in tasting booths made in accordance with ISO 8598 standards at room temperature<br>
in 40 ml tasteless plastic cups with randomised 3-figure codes. Test samples were<br>
evaluated after chewing for 0-1/2 minutes (initial phase 1), 1/2-1 minutes (initial phase<br>
2), 1-1 1/2 minutes (intermediate l), l 1/2-2 minutes (intermediate 2), 2-2 1/2 minutes<br><br>
(intermediate 3), 2 1/2-3 minutes (intermediate 4),4-4 1/2 minutes (end phase 1), 4 1/2-5<br>
minutes (end phase 2), respectively. Between each sample tested, the<br>
panellist were allowed a break of 3 minutes. Every test is repeated.<br>
The following texture parameters were assessed: softness, toughness and elasticity.<br>
For each of these parameters, the panellists were required to provide their<br>
assessments according to an arbitrary scale of 0-15. The data obtained were<br>
processed using a FIZZ computer program (French Bio System) and the results were<br>
transformed to sensory profile diagrams as shown in figure 10-12. The major<br>
differences between test chewing gums in all phases were the<br>
following:<br>
The chewing gum containing initiator made elastomers (1002, 1003) showed a<br>
higher softness compared with standard (confirming the rheological results in the<br>
above EXAMPLE 9). When comparing the chewing gum containing initiator made<br>
polymers 1002 and 1003, the softness of 1003 (star-shaped) is closer to standard<br>
excect for the initial phases.<br>
Fig 11 showed a higher toughness of the chewing gum containing elastomer made<br>
with 4-arms star shaped initiator (1003) compared with difunctional initiator made<br>
elastomer (1002) excect for the initials phases. The toughness of 1003 is closer to<br>
standard compared with 1002.<br>
The elastisity of 4-arms star shaped elastomer is expected to be higher due to the<br>
branching, which is confirmed by fig. 12. Where 1003 was found higher in elasticity<br>
and closer to the standard compared with 1002 (made with difunctional initiator) in<br>
about 70 % of the time tested.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
Sensory flavour profile analyses of test chewing gum<br><br>
The three chewing gum samples were tested using the sensory method described in<br>
the above EXAMPLE 10.<br>
Test samples were evaluated after chewing for 0-1 minutes (initial phase 1), 1-2<br>
minutes (intermediate phase 1), 2-3 minutes (intermediate phase 2), 3-4 minutes<br>
(intermediate 3), 4-5 minutes (end phase 1), respectively.<br>
The following flavour parameters were assessed: sweetness, flavour intensity and<br>
cooling. For each of these parameters, the panellists were required to provide their<br>
assessments according to an arbitrary scale of 0-15. The data obtained were<br>
processed using a FIZZ computer program (French Bio System) and the results were<br>
transformed to sensory profile diagrams as shown in figure 13-15.<br>
The major differences between the chewing gums in all phases were the<br>
following:<br>
The chewing gum containing elastomer made with 4-arrns star shaped initiator 1003<br>
showed higher sweetness release for the inital phase (fig. 13). Cooling and overall<br>
flavour intensity were found higher in release compared to the chewing gum<br>
formulation containing HMWE elastomer made with a difunctional initiator 1002<br>
(fig. 14 and 15).<br>
It can therefore be concluded that the use of a 4-arms star shaped initiator is superior<br>
with regard to essential flavour characteristics.<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
Sensory time intensity analysis of test chewing gum<br><br>
Two strawberry chewing gum samples were tested by serving them to the sensory<br>
panellists in tasting booths made in accordance with ISO 8598 standards at room<br>
temperature in 40 ml tasteless plastic cups with randomised 3-figure codes.<br>
Samples were tested during 3 minutes and evaluated every 10 seconds. Between each<br>
sample tested, the panellist were allowed a break of 3 minutes. Every test is repeated.<br>
The FIZZ (French Bio System) is used to collect and calculate data and the resutls<br>
were transformed to sensory time intensity diagram as shown in figure 17.<br>
The flavour intensity of strawberry flavoured chewing gum containing elastomer<br>
made with 4-arms star shaped initiator 1005 has an higher overall flavours intensity<br>
compared with chewing gum formulation containing HMWE elastomer made with a<br>
difunctional initiator 1004 (fig. 16).<br><br>
