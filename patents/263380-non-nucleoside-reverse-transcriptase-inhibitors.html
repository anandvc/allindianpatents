				<td>Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors<br>
The invention relates to the field of antiviral therapy and, in particular, to non-nucleoside compounds that inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase and are useful for treating Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) mediated diseases. The invention provides novel N-phenyl phenylacetamide compounds according to formula I, for treatment or prophylaxis of HIV mediated diseases, AIDS or ARC, employing said compounds in monotherapy or in combination therapy.<br>
The human immunodeficiency virus HIV is the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a disease characterized by the destruction of the immune system, particularly of the CD4+ T-cell, with attendant susceptibility to opportunistic infections. HIV infection is also associated with a precursor AIDs-related complex (ARC), a syndrome characterized by symptoms such as persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, fever and weight loss.<br>
In common with other retroviruses, the HIV genome encodes protein precursors known as gag and gag-pol which are processed by the viral protease to afford the protease, reverse transcriptase (RT), endonuclease/integrase and mature structural proteins of the virus core. Interruption of this processing prevents the production of normally infectious virus. Considerable efforts have been directed towards the control of HIV by inhibition of vixally encoded enzymes.<br>
Currently available chemotherapy targets two crucial viral enzymes: HIV protease and HIV reverse transcriptase. (J. S. G. Montaner et at Antiretroviral therapy: 'the state of the art\ Biomed &amp; Pharmacother. 1999 53:63- 72; R. W. Shafer and D. A. Vuitton, Highly active retroviral therapy (HAART) for the treatment of infection with human immunodeficiency virus typey Biomed. &amp; Pharmacother. 1999 53 :73-86; E. De Clercq, New Developments in Anti-HIV Chemotherap. Curr. Med. Chem. 2001 8:1543-1572). Two general classes of RTI inhibitors have been identified: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.<br>
NRTIs typically are 2,,3,-dideoxynucleoside (ddN) analogs which must be phosphorylated prior to interacting with viral RT. The corresponding triphosphates function as competitive inhibitors or alternative substrates for viral RT. After incorporation into nucleic acids the nucleoside analogs terminate the chain elongation<br><br>
process. HIV reverse transcriptase has DNA editing capabilities which enable resistant strains to overcome the blockade by cleaving the nucleoside analog and continuing the elongation. Currently clinically used NRTls include zidovudine (AZT), didanosine (ddl), zalcitabine (ddC), stavudine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC) and tenofovir (PMPA).<br>
NNRTIs were first discovered in 1989. NNRTI are allosteric inhibitors which bind reversibly at a nonsubstrate-binding site on the HIV reverse transcriptase thereby altering the shape of the active site or blocking polymerase activity (R. W. Buckheit, Jr., Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: perspectives for novel therapeutic compounds and strategies for treatment of HIV infection. Expert Opin. Investig Drugs 200110(8): 1423-1442; E. De Clercq The role of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) in the therapy of HIV infection, Antiviral Res. 1998 38:153-179; E. De Clercq New Developments in Anti-HIV Chemotherapy, Current Medicinal Chem. 2001 8(13):1543-1572; G. Moyle, The Emerging Roles ofNon-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors in Antiviral Therapy, Drugs 2001 61 (l):19-26). Although over thirty structural classes of NNRTIs have been identified in the laboratory, only three compounds have been approved for HTV therapy: efavirenz, nevirapine and delavirdine.<br>
Initially viewed as a promising class of compounds, in vitro and in vivo studies quickly revealed the NNRTIs presented a low barrier to the emergence of drug resistant HIV strains and class-specific toxicity. Drug resistance frequently develops with only a single point mutation in the RT. While combination therapy with NRTIs, Pis and NNRTIs has, in many cases, dramatically lowered viral loads and slowed disease progression, significant therapeutic problems remain. (R. M. Gulick, Eur. Soc. Clin. Microbiol, and Inf. Dis. 2003 9(3):186-193) The cocktails are not effective in all patients, potentially severe adverse reactions often occur and the rapidly reproducing HIV virus has proven adroit at creating mutant drug-resistant variants of wild type protease and reverse transcriptase. There remains a need for safer drugs with activity against wild type and commonly occurring resistant strains of HTV.<br>
Certain N-phenyl phenylacetamide compounds have been found to have a variety of pharmacological properties.<br>
US 20030187068 (H. Miyachi etal) discloses N-phenyl phenylacetamide compounds which are peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (PPARa) ligands.<br>
US 20030220241 (D. Defoe-Jones et al) disclose N-phenyl phenylacetamide compounds use to prepare protein conjugates with a prenyl protein transferase which are cleaved by prostate-specific antigen and are useful for treating cancer. W09917777 (J. S.<br><br>
Desolms et al) teach prenyl protein transferase compounds which include N-phenyl phenylacetamides.<br>
N-(substituted)phenyI 3-phenoxy-phenyiacetamide compounds have been disclosed in WO01/21596 (A. A. Mortlock et al)a$ inhibitors of aurora 2 kinase which are potentially useful in the treatment of proliferative diseases.<br>
N-phenyl 3-(substituted)phenoxy-phenylacetamide compounds have be disclosed in WO2000059930 as inhibitors of prenyl protein transferase.<br>
N-(substituted)phenyl3-phenoxy-phenylacetamide compounds have been disclosed in US2003011435 (K. Tani etal.) as EP4 receptor antagonists which are potentially useful in the suppression of TNF-a production and induction of IL-10 production.<br>
Benzanilide compounds have been disclosed in W09965874 (Y. Ohtake et al.) as vasopressin antagonists.<br>
N-phenyl phenylacetamide compounds 1 wherein R can be substituted aryl, X can be O, n can be 0, R4 and R5 can be hydrogen have been disclosed in W09315043 (T. Oe et al) as acetyl CoA cholesterol O-acyltransferase inhibitors useful for reducing blood lipid levels and for treating arteriosclerosis.<br><br>
N-Phenyl phenylacetamides have also been used as synthetic intermediates for the preparation of pharmacologically active compounds. N-(2-carboalkoxy-5-chloro-phenyl) phenylacetamides (A. Krexmeyer etal, J. Med, Chem. 1999 42:4394-4404; J. J. Kulagowski et at, I Med. Chem. 1994 37:1402-1405 K. Ackermann etaU WO 97/26244), N-(2-cyano-5-chloro-phenyl) phenylacetamides (M. Rowley etal&gt; J. Med. Chem. 1997 40:4053-4068; R. W. Carling et aU I Med. Chem., 1997 40:754-765 and N-(2-nitrophenyl) phenylacetamides ( J. F. W. Keana et al, WO 96/22990) have been disclosed and utilized as intermediates for the synthesis of ligands for the glycine site on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. NMDA ligands have been investigated for treating CNS disorders thought to be related neuronal death caused by over-stimulation of the post synaptic receptor sensitive to N-methyl-D-aspartic acid. Such disorders include Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy and cerebral ischemia. These compounds and indications are unrelated to the present invention.<br><br>
2-Benzoyl phenyl-N-[phenyl] -acetamide compounds 2a and 2b have been shown to inhibit HTV-1 reverse transcriptase (P. G. Wyatt et al, J. Med. Chem. 1995 38(10):1657-1665). Further screening identified related compounds, eg. 2-benzoyl phenyloxy-N-[phenyl]-acetamide, 3a, and a sulfonamide derivative 3b which also inhibited reverse transcriptase (J. H. Chan et al, J. Med Chem. 2004 47(5):1175-1182; C. L. Webster et at, WO01/17982).<br><br>

Unless specified to the contrary, the reactions described herein preferably are conducted under an inert atmosphere at atmospheric pressure at a reaction temperature range of from about -78 °C to about 150 °C, more preferably from about 0°C to about 125 °C, and most preferably and conveniently at about room (or ambient) temperature, e.g., about 20 °C<br>
Some compounds in following schemes are depicted with generalized substituents; however, one skilled in the art will immediately appreciate that the nature of the R groups can varied to afford the various compounds contemplated in this invention. Moreover, the reaction conditions are exemplary and alternative conditions are well known. The reaction sequences in the following examples are not meant to limit the scope of the invention as set forth in the claims.<br>
N-Phenyl 3-phenoxy-phenylacetamide compounds are prepared from phenyl acetic acid derivatives 4 (X1 = O, R5 = optionally substituted phenyl) as depicted in Scheme 1. The preparation of phenylacetic acids related to the present compounds have been described in US Serial Nos. 10/807,993 and 10/807,766 entitled Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors filed March 23,2004 These applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br><br><br>
4-AJkyl-3-aryloxy-phenylacetic add compounds are useful precursors to some embodiments of the present invention and can be prepared from 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl acetate by Pd catalyzed coupling of a dialkyl zinc species and ethyl 3-methoxy-4-trifluorosulfonyloxy-phenylacetate (4b) to produce the corresponding 4-alkyl compound (SCHEME 1). The Negishi coupling of organozinc halides or dialkylzinc with haloarenes and aryl triflates is an effective means for attachment of an alkyl group to an arene (E.-I. Negishi, Ace. Chem. Res. 1982 15:340-348). The reaction is catalyzed by palladium Pd(0) and palladium is preferably ligated to a bidentate ligand including Pd(dppf)Cl2 and Pd(dppe)Cl2. (J- M. Herbert Tetrahedron Lett. 2004 45:817-819) Typically the reaction is run in an inert aprotic solvent and common ethereal solvents include dioxane, DME and THF are suitable. The reaction is commonly run at elevated temperature.<br>
Alternatively Friedel-Crafts acylation of ethyl 3-methoxy-phenylacetate affords 4-acetyl-3-methoxy-phenylacetate 8. Reduction of the ketone to afford the 4-ethyl derivative 12a can be accomplished under a variety of conditions including triethylsilylhydride/TFA, catalytic hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, Clemmenson and Wolf-Kischner procedures. Alternatively the side chain can be further elaborated by subjecting the ketone to a Wittig condensation and reduction of the resulting olefin. In the present invention triphenylphosphonium methylide is condensed with 8 affording ethyl 4-isopropenyl-3-mefhoxy-phenylacetate (14) which was reduced to the corresponding ethyl 4-iso-propyl-3-methoxy-phenylacetate (16). One skilled in the art will recognize many closely related alternative procedures are available that afford other 4-alkyl substituents. Demethylation of the methyl ether affords the corresponding ethyl 4-alkyl-3-hydroxyphenylacetate 18a which are useful synthetic intermediates for introduction of the 3-aryloxy moiety.<br>
SCHEME 1<br><br><br>
3,4-Dimethyl-5-aryloxy-phenylacetic acid compounds were also prepared using a dialkylzinc mediated coupling; however, prior to that coupling the activating effect of the hydroxyl was exploited to formylate the aromatic ring and afford 22a. Reduction of the formyl substituent provides the methyl compound 22c, (SCHEME 2) The formyl moiety provides a versatile intermediate that can be further modified to incorporate a variety of substitution into the 3-position. Demethylation of the methyl ether affords the phenol 24c which can be used to introduce the biaryl ether linkage.<br><br>
The preparation of diaryl ethers has been reviewed (J. S. Sawyer, Recent Advances in Diaryl Ether Synthesis, Tetrahedron 2000 56:5045-5065). Introduction of the (hetero)aryloxy ether can often be accomplished by direct SnAr displacement reaction on a aromatic ring bearing a leaving group and electronegative substituents. Fluoroaromatic compounds with electronegative substituents are known to be sensitive to nucleophilic attack by soft nucleophiles. Fluorine substituents are generally significantly more labile than other halogen substituents. While hard nucleophiles like water and hydroxide fail to<br><br>
displace fluoride, soft nucleophiles like phenols, imidazoles, amines, thiols and some amides undergo facile displacement reactions even at room temperature (D. Boger et ah, Biorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2000 10:1471-75; F. Terrier Nucleophilic Aromatic Displacement: The Influence of the Nitro Group VCH Publishers, New York, NY 1991). Phenols typified by 6b and 12a can be treated with appropriately substituted aryl fluorine compounds to produce diaryl ethers(m/ra}.<br>
Aryl ethers also can be efficiently prepared by Cu(OAc)2 catalyzed condensation of substituted benzene boronic acids and phenols (D. A. Evans et al, Tetrahedron Lett., 1998 39:2937-2940 and D. M. T. Chan et al, Tetrahedron Lett. 1998 39:2933-2936). This protocol can also be adapted to phenols such as 6b and 12a. Substituted benzene boronic acids with a variety of other substituents are widely available.<br>
Alternatively, variations of the Ullmann diaryl ether synthesis with Cu(I) salts (J.-F. Marcoux et al.y /. Am. Chem. Soc 1997 119:10539-540; E. Buck et al Org. Lett. 2002 4(9):1623-1626) or palladium-catalyzed coupling procedures also has been reported (G. Mann et al, I Am. Chem. Soc, 1999 121:3224-3225) have been described. One skilled in the art will appreciate that optimal procedure will vary depending on the nature and position of substituents on the aryl rings to be coupled and useful conditions for the coupling can by identified without undue experimentation.<br><br>
5-Methyl- and 5-ethyl-3-hydroxy-phenylacetic derivatives were prepared by monomethylation of 3,5-dihydxoxy-phenylacetic acid to afford 26a followed sequentially by treatment with triflic anhydride and dialkylzinc/Pd[P(Ph)3]4 mediated coupling to<br><br>
afford 28a and 28b. While the reactions are illustrated with methyl and ethyl groups, one skilled in the art will appreciate that a variety of substitutents can be introduced depending on the reagent selected. Demethylation of the methyl ether was accomplished as previously described to afford phenols that can be used to introduce the diaryl ethers. 3-Aiyloxy-5-methoxy-phenylacetic acids compounds can be prepared by mono-arylation of alkyl 3,5-dihydroxy-phenylacetates and subsequent methylation to afford 34b (SCHEME 3). Other alkoxy compounds are readily prepared by replacing methyl iodide with other alkylating agents.<br><br>
While useful substituted phenylacetic acid precursors are sometimes available, an alternative route utilizing methyl substituents to elaborate the acetic acid side chain has been used. Ethyl 4-chloro-3-hydroxy-phenylacetate (40) was prepared from l-chloro-2-methoxy-4-methyl-benzene by benzylic bromination (step 1) and displacement of the bromine atom with sodium cyanide (step 2). Hydrolysis of the nitrile (steps 3 and 4) and demethylation of the ether under standard conditions afforded 40. Demethylations with BBr3 or Lil/syn collidine are effective techniques for conversion of methyl ethers to the corresponding phenols. Incorporation of the aryl or heteroaryl ether is achieved by one of the methods described previously.<br>
4-Chloro-2-fluoro-3-phenoxy-phenylacetic acid compounds (SCHEME 5) can prepared by starting from l-chloro-3-fluoro-2-methoxy-4-methylbenzene which is subjected to benzylic bromination with NBS and AIBN, cyanide displacement, hydrolysis of the nitrile and esterification of the carboxylic acid utilizing a sequence analogous to that described in SCHEME 4<br>
SCHEME 5<br><br><br>
Alternatively, the synthesis of 2-fluoro substituted compounds can be accomplished by exploiting the facile displacement of fluoroaromatic compounds. Thus, treatment of l,2,3-triflouro-4-nitro-benzene (46) with an alkali metal phenolate resulted in displacement of the 3-fluoro group with good regioselectivity to afford 48a (SCHEME 6). Treatment of 48a with carbanion formed by deprotonation of ferf-butyl ethyl malonate results in the regioselective introduction of a malonic ester (48b) which is subjected to acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the tert-butyl ester and decarboxylation to afford 48c. After introduction of the phenoxy and acetic acid moieties, the nitro group is readily converted to other substituents at the 4-position. Reduction of the nitro substituent to the corresponding amine 50a which can be subjected to Sandmeyer reactions. In the present case, the Sandmeyer reaction was used to introduce a bromo 50a or chloro 50e substituent The bromo substituent could be further reacted with a dialkyi zinc (the Negishi Reaction) to afford 4-alkyl-3-aryloxy-2-fluoro-phenylacetic acid compounds exemplified by 50c and 50d.<br><br><br>
52b which also is an effective substrate for introduction of an aryl ether and Sandmeyer-type chemistry<br>
4-Alkoxy-2-fiuoro-3-phenoxy^henylacetic acid compounds are prepared by a alternate route. A mixture ortfzo-difluorobenzene (54a) and trimethylsilyichloride was treated with butyl lithium which afforded 2,3-difluoro-l54-&amp;f5-trimethylsilanyl-benzene (54b) which was brominated to afford 54c. Selective monometallation of 54c with iso-propylmagnesium chloride-lithium chloride complex and quenching the organomagnesium compound with DMF afforded 54d. Reaction of 54d with a phenol in the presence of K2CO3 resulted in displacement of the fluorine atom adjacent to the aldehyde to afford 56a. The aldehyde was subjected to a Baeyer-VUliger oxidation with trifluoroperacetic acid which underwent concomitant hydrolysis to the phenol 56b which was alkylated with CS2CO3 and methyl iodide to afford the methoxy substituted analog 56c. Metallation of the remaining bromine substituent with iso-PrMgCl/Lil/THF and alkylation of the resulting Grignard reagent afforded 58a which was oxidatively cleaved with NaI04/Ru(III)Cl3 to produce the phenylacetic acid 58b and converted to the corresponding amides by procedures described previously.<br><br>
The substituted phenylacetic acid esters thus obtained were converted to the corresponding amides through a three-step sequence including hydrolysis of the ester, conversion of the resulting acid to an acid chloride and condensation of the acid chloride with an aryl amine or heteroarylamine.<br>
Fluorine-substituted aromatic compounds which are useful intermediates for formation of the biaryl ether are commercially available or readily prepared from<br><br>
commercially available precursors. 3-Chloro-5-fluoro-benzonitrile (59a), l-bromo-3-chloro-5-fluorobenzene, l-bromo-2-fluoro-4-chloro~benzene, 4-chloro-3-fluorobenzonitrile, 3-fluoro«5-trifluoromethyl-benzonitrile (59b), 3,5-dibromo-fluoro-benzene, l,3-dichloro-2-fiuorobenzene (59c), l,4-dichloro-2-fluoro-6-bromo-benzene (59d), l-chloro-2-fluoro-4,6-dibromo-benzene (59e)and l-chloro-2,6-difluoro-4-bromo-benzene (59f) were purchased. Cyanide substituents can be introduced into a aromatic ring by Zn(CN)2/palladium-catalyzed displacement of a halogen by cyanide which can be carried out either after after formation of the biaryl ether or on a halogenated precursor (SCHEME 8 - reaction B).<br><br>
Fluoroalkyl substituted compounds are useful embodiments of the invention and 66 and 72c were prepared by fluorination of a carbonyl compound with a fluorinating agent such as (diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride (DAST) or [bis(2-methoxyethylamino)sulfur difluoride (Deoxo-Fluor*). Thus l,3-dibromo-5-<br><br>
fluorobenzene (64a) was mono-metallated and formylated to afford 64b. Fluorination of 64b with DAST afforded 64c which was optionally treated with Zn(CN)2 and Pd[P(Ph)3]4 to introduce a nitrile prior to formation of the fczs-aryl ether 68 by condensation of 66 and 52b. The 1,1,-difluoroethyl substituent was introduced utilizing an analogous strategy whereby an acetyl derivative was fluorinated with Deoxo-Fluor . The acetyl compound 72b was obtained by mono-metallation of 70 and quenching with N-methyl-N-(methoxy)acetamide. The fully elaborated phenylacetic acid 74 was obtained by condensation of 72c and 52b followed Sandmeyer reaction in the presence of Cu(I)Cl and HC1. Optional introduction of a cyanide into the aryl ring (step 7) was carried out as described previously.<br>
Di-cyano substitution is another feature in some embodiments of the present invention and dicyano aromatic compounds, e.g.t 80 are readily available by kzVcyanation of a dihalo precursor 78. One skilled in the art will appreciate this transformation can be carried out on a variety of dihalogenated<br><br>
substrates. Considerable flexibility in the sequence of the transformations is possible and fcis-cyanation can be carried out either prior to or after formation of the biaryl ether, e.g., transformation of 82a to 82b.<br><br>
In some examples of the present invention the biaryl ether is introduced by reacting a suitably substituted phenol and a fluoro-substituted phenylacetic acid or precursor thereof, (see SCHEME 6) Many useful phenols are commercially available. 3-Chloro-5-hydroxy-benzonitrile (81c) was a useful intermediate in the synthesis of some embodiments of the present invention. 81c was conveniently prepared from 3,5-dichlorobenzonitrile (81a) by displacement of one chlorine substituent with sodium methoxide and Lil/collidine mediated demethylation of the resulting arylmethyl ether 81b. The phenol was reacted with 46 to afford 83a which was further transformed to 83c as described previously.<br>
Introduction of haloalkoxy substituents were readily accomplished by addition of a dihalocarbene to a phenol. 3,5-Dihydroxy-benzonitrile (84a) is transformed into the base-stable mono SEM-ether 84c which is reacted with difluorocarbene generated by decarboxylative elimination of<br><br>
difluorochloroacetic acid (SCHEME 10). Deprotection and condensation of the resulting phenol 86b with ethyl 2,3-difluoro-4-nitro-phenylacetate 52b affords 88 which can be further converted to compounds of the present invention.<br>
SCHEME 11<br><br><br>
Other embodiments of the invention include N-acylsulfonamides (SCHEME 11) which can be prepared by acylation of the corresponding sulfonamide. The acylation can be achieved by reacting the sulfonamide with acyl halides or anhydrides, e.g. propionyl anhydride, or, in the case of acylation with N-protected amino acids, by transient activation of the carboxylic acid followed by condensation with 90a and deprotection. Protocols for activation, coupling and deprotection of amino acids are well known in the art Although the acyl sulfonamides in SCHEME 11 are depicted as neutral molecules, the acidic proton on the acyl sulfonamide nitrogen can be readily deprotonated to form salts. Acyl sulfonamides formed from amino acids can be deprotected by well established procedures and the free amine group can be converted into an acid addition salt<br>
Other N-substituted sulfonamides were prepared by amidation with a 4-amino-benzensulfonyl fluoride (95) to afford an intermediate sulfonyl fluoride 114 which is further reacted with a (di)alkylamine to afford the desired sulfonamide derivatives.<br><br>
4-Amino-benzene-sulfones are useful intermediates for the synthesis of some embodiments of the present invention (SCHEME 13). The requisite anilines were prepared from 4-fluoro-2-methylnitrobenzene. Displacement of the fluoride with sodium sulfide and alkylation of the resulting thiol with ethyl bromoacetamide and<br><br>
oxidation of the thiol to the corresponding sulfone with MCPBA affords 98d. Reduction of the nitro substituent and condensation of the resulting amine 100 with an aroyl chloride affords 122. Subsequent modification of the function groups, e.g„ hydrolysis of the carboxylic acid ester is possible using previously described methodology. Other alkylating agents useful to prepare compounds of the present invention include haloalkanols, e.g. bromoethanol and brompropanol, N-protected halo amines, e.g,&gt; (2-bromo-ethyl)-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester and bromoacetonitrile. The corresponding ether analogs were available by alkylation of the analogous phenols, (see, e.£, P. G. Wyatt etal I Med, Chem. 1995 38(10):1657-1665).<br><br>
(7-Aryloxy-benzofuran-5-yl)-acetic acid derivatives were prepared from (2,3-dihydro-benzofuran-5-yl)-acetic acid ethyl ester (101a). Introduction of the oxygen substituent was achieved by Friedel-Craft acetylation and subsequent Baeyer-Villiger rearrangement and hydrolysis of the acetate to afford lOld. Introduction of the aryloxy moiety is accomplished by S^Ar displacement of an aryl halide or by Cu(OAc)2 catalyzed condensation of substituted benzene boronic acids and phenols as described previously. Oxidation of the dihydrofuran by allylic bromination which spontaneously underwent dehydrobromination afforded 105a.<br>

The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein means an amount required to reduce symptoms of the disease in an individual. The dose will be adjusted to the individual requirements in each particular case. That dosage can vary within wide limits depending upon numerous factors such as the severity of the disease to be treated, the age and general health condition of the patient, other medicaments with which the patient is being treated, the route and form of administration and the preferences and experience of the medical practitioner involved. For oral administration, a daily dosage of between about 0.01 and about 100 mg/kg body weight per day should be appropriate in monotherapy and/or in combination therapy. A preferred daily dosage is between about 0.1 and about 500 mg/kg body weight, more preferred 0.1 and about 100 mg/kg body weight and most preferred 1.0 and about 10 mg/kg body weight per day. Thus, for administration to a 70 kg person, the dosage range would be about 7 mg to 0.7 g per day. The daily dosage can be administered as a single dosage or in divided dosages, typically<br><br>
between 1 and 5 dosages per day. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages -which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect for the individual patient is reached. One of ordinary skill in treating diseases described herein "will be able, without undue experimentation and in reliance on personal knowledge, experience and the disclosures of this application, to ascertain a therapeutically effective amount of the compounds of the present invention for a given disease and patient.<br>
In embodiments of the invention, the active compound or a salt can be administered in combination with another antiviral agent, such as a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, another nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or HIV protease inhibitor. When the active compound or its derivative or salt are administered in combination with another antiviral agent the activity may be increased over the parent compound. When the treatment is combination therapy, such administration may be concurrent or sequential with respect to that of the nucleoside derivatives. "Concurrent administration" as used herein thus includes administration of the agents at the same time or at different times. Administration of two or more agents at the same time can be achieved by a single formulation containing two or more active ingredients or by substantially simultaneous administration of two or more dosage forms with a single active agent<br>
