				<td>Electric machine<br>
An electric machine with a rotor which is rotatably mounted in a housing with a rotor shaft<br>
which extends beyond the housing, a plurality of electromagnet components which are<br>
statically disposed in the housing at uniform angular spacings and spaced from the axis of<br>
rotation of the rotor, each with a coil core bearing a coil winding consisting of one or more<br>
conductors and with permanent magnets which are disposed at uniform angular spacings and<br>
are non-rotatably retained in or on the rotor, these permanent magnets each having a pole<br>
face aligned opposite the end faces of the coil cores and. each having a polarity which is<br>
successively reversed in the peripheral direction, wherein the coil cores of the electromagnet<br>
components are disposed parallel to the axis of rotation of the rotor shaft in the interior of the<br>
housing in such a way that their opposing end faces each lie in two planes which are spaced<br>
from one another and extend at right angles to the axis of rotation of the rotor shaft and the<br>
ends of the electric conductors which form the coil winding of the individual electromagnet<br>
components are interconnected via an electric or electronic control device to form at least<br>
two pairs of electrical connections and the rotor has at least two outer armature discs which<br>
extend radially to before the end faces of the coil cores and in which the permanent magnets<br>
are retained with their pole faces aligned with the respective associated end faces of the coil<br>
cores, the radially inner region of the said armature discs being provided with holes.<br>
Such machines which can be connected to electric current sources are used for example as<br>
wheel hub motors for vehicle drives because of the favourable power-weight ratio. Th this<br>
case these motors are designed so that the permanent magnets are retained in a disc, which is<br>
made from non-magnetic material and is non-rotatably connected to the rotor shaft, in such a<br>
way that their pole faces open freely on both sides into the flat sides of the disc-shaped rotor<br>
armature, the magnets being disposed so that in the peripheral direction successive pole faces<br>
on the same side of the armature have alternating polarities. The electromagnet components<br>
in the form of coils wound on metal cores are disposed on the inner faces of the housing<br>
cover or radial housing walls facing the disc-shaped rotor armature at a distance<br>
corresponding to the average radial distance of the permanent magnets from the axis of<br>
rotation of the rotor shaft. The control of these coils is achieved preferably by an electronic<br><br><br>
control device which generates a magnetic rotating field, so that the control of contacts<br>
sliding on a commutator, which is basically also conceivable but is susceptible to wear, is<br>
omitted. Such electronically controlled machines are also designated as brushless disc<br>
armature machines (GB 2 275 371 A). Furthermore, brushless disc armature machines are<br>
also known in which the rotor has two outer armature discs which extend radially to in front<br>
of the end faces of the coil cores which are fixed on the housing, the permanent magnets<br>
being retained in these armature discs with their pole faces aligned with the respective<br>
associated end faces of the coil cores (e.g. DE 197 01 797 A, Figure 18; DE 42 14 483).<br>
The object of the invention is to improve the efficiency of the known electric machines and<br>
to minimise any decline in the power due to reduction of the magnetisation of the permanent<br>
magnets over the course of time. At the same time the machines should be economical and<br>
simple to produce and should have a favourable unit weight.<br>
Starting from an electric machine of the type mentioned in the introduction, this object is<br>
achieved according to the invention in that in each case pairs of legs, which succeed one<br>
another in the peripheral direction and are each provided with a pole face of different polarity<br>
on the free end facing the coil, of the permanent magnets provided in the two opposing outer<br>
armature discs are connected to one another in the end regions remote from the pole faces by<br>
a respective yoke which encloses the magnetic field and is made from soft or hard magnetic<br>
material, that the armature discs are connected to one another by radially extending walls<br>
which form the cavity between the armature discs into a plurality of chambers which are<br>
offset with respect to one another in the peripheral direction and are open towards the<br>
electromagnet components, and that the radially inner holes provided in the armature discs<br>
each open into the chambers of the rotor. The permanent magnets which are associated with<br>
the electromagnet components disposed centrally between both armature discs and thus are<br>
rigidly fixed on the peripheral wall of the housing of the machine are constructed in the<br>
manner of horseshoe magnets by means of the yokes which in each case connect two single<br>
magnets which succeed one another in the peripheral direction, resulting in a construction of<br>
the motor in which the magnetic field of the permanent magnets is kept contained as far as<br>
possible within the magnetic material of the permanent magnets, connected by the yoke, of<br><br>
the coil core, so that a low magnetic leakage field can be produced only in the narrow air gap<br>
between the end faces of the coil cores of the electromagnet components and the pole faces<br>
of the electromagnets. Losses of the magnetic rotating field generated in the electromagnetic<br>
components when the machine is switched on as motor are therefore minimised. This also<br>
applies when the machine is used as generator, which suggests itself for example for wind<br>
generators in which a direct coupling of the axis of rotation of the rotor to the output shaft of<br>
the wind wheel is possible without connection of a reduction gear between them. In addition<br>
to the favourable electric efficiency of the generator, the mechanical losses in the<br>
transmission gear are also avoided. In this case the radially extending walls which connect<br>
the armature discs act like the blades of a fan, i.e. via the radially inner holes in the armature<br>
discs air is drawn out of the housing and is blown radially outwards between the<br>
electromagnet components as a cooling air stream.<br>
In the simplest case a row of electromagnet components is provided in the interior of the<br>
housing of the machine, and then the rotor has two outer armature discs guided on opposing<br>
sides in front of the coil core end faces of the electromagnet components.<br>
The power of the machine can be increased without increasing the diameter in that two or<br>
more rows of electromagnet components spaced from one another in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the rotor shaft are disposed in the interior of the housing, wherein in addition to<br>
the two outer armature discs which are guided in front of the outer end faces of the coil cores,<br>
pointing in opposite directions, of the outermost rows the rotor has an additional armature<br>
disc with permanent magnets guided into each space between adjacent rows of electromagnet<br>
components in front of the end surfaces thereof which face one another, and the pole faces of<br>
differing polarity of the permanent magnets which are each exposed on opposing sides of the<br>
respective additional armature disc are aligned in the radial direction with the end faces of<br>
the coil cores of the rows of electromagnet components. Thus the permanent magnets<br>
disposed in the additional armature discs are - unlike the permanent magnets in the outer<br>
armature discs - constructed not as horseshoe magnets but as bar magnets of short length in<br>
order thus to keep the air gaps small between the pole faces of these magnets and the facing<br><br>
end surfaces of the coil cores of the electromagnet components and thus to avoid losses due<br>
to magnetic leakage fields.<br>
In this case the interior of the housing is advantageously closed off and sealed against the<br>
external atmosphere, this sealing being achieved in the region of the shaft of the machine<br>
extending beyond the housing by a corresponding seal. The air drawn in from the housing<br>
through the radially inner holes in the armature discs and blown through between the<br>
electromagnet components takes up heat from the coils of the electromagnet components.<br>
Over the outer periphery of the armature discs the circulated air then passes into the space<br>
between the rotor and the end walls of the housing and is drawn back to the radially inner<br>
holes. In this way a self-contained air flow is produced in the interior of the housing and<br>
acts upon not only the electromagnet components but all other exposed surfaces in the<br>
interior of the housing and prevents the occurrence of locally higher temperatures (hot spots).<br>
For removal of the heat produced in the machine and given off into the circulated air it is<br>
recommended that the outer and/or inner face of the housing be provided with ribs in order<br>
enlarge the surface of the housing which gives off or takes up heat. In this special case it<br>
may be advantageous if radially extending ribs are provided on the inner faces of the housing<br>
end walls facing the rotor and between these ribs radial channels are formed for the return of<br>
the gaseous atmosphere circulated in the interior of the housing.<br>
Moreover the radial channels can be closed off on the armature disc side by a metal plate so<br>
that between the radial ribs channels are produced which are open only on the radially inner<br>
and radially outer end and are connected to the interior of the housing and through which the<br>
circulated air is returned.<br>
The cooling of the electric machine according to the invention can also be carried out by<br>
through flows of ambient air, in that air inlet openings are provided in regions of the housing<br>
lying opposite the holes in the armature discs and air outlet openings which are offset radially<br>
outwards are provided in the housing.<br>
In this case the electromagnet components are disposed at uniform spacings in the peripheral<br>
direction and protrude from the inner face of the peripheral housing wall into the space<br>
formed between the armature discs.<br>
An embodiment in particular of the machine of the type mentioned in the introduction may<br>
be advantageous in which each pole face of the permanent magnets has in the peripheral<br>
direction an extent which covers two pole faces of the coils of two electromagnet<br>
components which succeed one another in the peripheral direction, and that the control<br>
means is designed so that in order to drive the rotor this control switches over the polarity of<br>
every second one of the electromagnet components which succeed one another in the<br>
peripheral direction with each rotation of the rotor about an angular spacing which<br>
corresponds to the angular spacing between two electromagnet components which succeed<br>
one another in the peripheral direction. This results in a 2-phase machine.<br>
Alternatively three pole faces of the coils of three electromagnet components which succeed<br>
one another in the peripheral direction can be associated with each pole face of the<br>
permanent magnets, in which case the control means is designed so that in order to drive the<br>
rotor, after the rotor has rotated by an angular spacing corresponding to the angular spacing<br>
between electromagnet components which succeed one another in the peripheral direction,<br>
the control means switches over the polarity of every third one of the electromagnet<br>
components which succeed one another in the peripheral direction and thus a 3-phase<br>
machine is produced.<br>
Basically more than three pole faces of the coils of electromagnet components which succeed<br>
one another in the peripheral direction can be associated with each pole face of the<br>
permanent magnets, in which the case the control means is designed so that in order to drive<br>
the rotor, after the rotor has rotated by an angular spacing corresponding to the angular<br>
spacing between electromagnet components which succeed one another in the peripheral<br>
direction, the control means successively switches over the polarity of every one of the<br>
electromagnet components, which succeed one another in the peripheral direction, of the<br>
group of electromagnet components associated with a permanent magnet.<br><br>
By interconnection in each case of the coils of groups, which succeed one another in the<br>
peripheral direction, of electromagnet components which are associated in each case with a<br>
permanent magnet, the construction costs of the power electronics controlling the polarity of<br>
the coils relative to individual control of each individual coil are markedly reduced. Thus the<br>
electric control circuit in a 2-phase machine is also reduced to a 2-phase inverter control with<br>
variable amplitude and frequency. 'The four coils of four electromagnet components are<br>
located between two opposing horseshoe-shaped magnet segments. The first and the third<br>
coils are switched over simultaneously and in the next step the second and the fourth coils are<br>
switched over. The polarity of the first and third as well as of the second and fourth coil are<br>
opposed. The first and third as well as the second and fourth coil can therefore be firmly<br>
wired to one another, since the third and fourth coil are each controlled in mirror image to<br>
the first and second coil. Thus it is possible in practice to produce a 4-phase control with a 2-<br>
phase control.<br>
The direction of rotation and the speed of the motor can be determined in that the switch-<br>
over point for the coils for switching over from one polarity to the other is controlled by way<br>
of a position pick-up which senses the relative rotational position of the rotor in the housing.<br>
Therefore the switch-over point for the control of the coil is determined by the sensor which<br>
predetermines the frequency. In this case the switch-over frequency is not identical to the<br>
motor speed, but it applies for one magnet segment. If the motor consists of ten segments<br>
with two switch pulses per phase and segment, then the switching frequency is 20 times the<br>
motor speed.<br>
In this case a contactless sensor, particularly an optical sensor, which senses the relative<br>
rotational position of the motor with respect to the housing is provided as position pick-up.<br>
The electromagnet components can each be advantageously held on separate support<br>
elements which can each be installed in an associated opening the in the peripheral wall of<br>
the housing in such a way that the pole faces of the coils of the electromagnet components<br>
are in the prescribed assembly position in alignment with the pole faces of the permanent<br><br>
magnets between the armature discs. In the event of damage to or failure of the coil of<br>
individual electromagnet components, these electromagnet components can then be removed<br>
individually and repaired or replaced by new electromagnet components which are capable of<br>
functioning.<br>
Alternatively the pre-installed arrangement of the electromagnet components in an annular<br>
mounting, which in turn is held in the interior of the housing, is also conceivable. However,<br>
this construction presupposes the possibility of separate installation of at least one of the<br>
armature discs of the rotor.<br>
The electromagnet components can each also have two separate coils with opposed<br>
directions of winding, i.e. reversed-polarity differential windings, which can then be<br>
selectively controlled by an electric or electronic control device. In this way the polarity of<br>
the respective electromagnet components is reversible - depending upon the control of the<br>
respective coil winding.<br>
If the machine according to the invention is to be used as a generator, the ends of the<br>
electrical conductors of each electromagnet component which form the coil winding are<br>
advantageously connected to the input connections of a separate rectifying circuit, and the<br>
rectifying circuits are then interconnected on the output side to a pair of electric bus lines.<br>
The direct current made up of the sum of the direct currents generated in the individual coils<br>
via the respective associated rectifying circuit can then be tapped from the bus line. This<br>
embodiment is recommended particularly when the generator is driven at alternating speeds,<br>
such as may be the case for example with electric current generation using wind power in<br>
wind generators with rotor blades without blade adjustment due to differing wind speeds and<br>
wind strengths.<br>
Then in an electronic inverter circuit which is connected downstream the direct current<br>
generated by such a generator can be converted into an alternating or three-phase current<br>
which is synchronised with the power supply.<br>
Die Drehrichtung und die Drehzahl des Motors kann dadurch<br>
bestimmt werden, dass der Umschaltpunkt fiir die Spulen fiir<br>
die Umschaltung von einer auf die andere Polaritat iiber ei-<br>
nen Positionsgeber angesteuert wird, welcher die relative<br>
Drehstellung des Rotors im Gehause abtastet. Der Umschalt-<br>
punkt fiir die Ansteuerung der Spule wird also durch den<br>
Sensor bestimmt, der die Frequenz vorgibt. Dabei ist die<br>
Umschaltfrequenz nicht mit der Motordrehzahl identisch,<br>
sondern sie gilt fiir ein Magnet segment. Besteht der Motor<br>
aus zehn Segmenten mit zwei Schaltimpulsen pro Phase und<br>
Segment, so ergibt sich also eine 20-fache Schaltfrequenz<br>
gegenuber der xMotordrehzahl .<br>
Als Positionsgeber wird dabei zweckmäβig ein die relative<br>

Sensor, vorgesehen.<br>
Die Elektromagnet-Bauelemente können mit Vorteil jeweils<br>
auf gesonderten Trägerelementen gehaltert sein, welche in<br>
jeweils einer zugeordneten öffnung in der Umfangswand des<br>
Gehauses derart montierbar sind, dass die Polflachen der<br>

Alternativ ist auch die vormontierte Anordnung der Elektro-<br>
magnet-Bauelemente in einer ringformigen Halterung denkbar,<br>
die ihrerseits im Gehauseinnern gehaltert ist. Diese Ausge-<br>

wall 16 which is practically shaped into a cylindrical ring of relatively short length. The<br>
housing end walls 14a, 14b and the penpheral housing wall 16 are connected to one another<br>
by screws or other fixing means - not shown - so as to be capable of being dismantled, and<br>
in order to simplify assembly and dismantling of the machine 10 the peripheral housing wall<br>
16 can also be divided in a parting plane running through the longitudinal central axis of the<br>
housing into two peripheral wall halves which can be screwed to one another or can be<br>
connected to one another in some other way.<br>
A bearing receptacle 20 for a radial bearing 22 is formed in each of the end walls 14a, 14b<br>
and a shaft 24 passing through the housing end wall 14a is rotatably mounted in these<br>
bearings.<br>
In the radially outer regions of the armature discs 26a, 26b permanent magnets 27 are<br>
retained so that they succeed one another in the peripheral direction at uniform angular<br>
spacings, and the pole faces of these permanent magnets which face inwards, i.e. towards the<br>
respective opposing armature disc 26b, 26a, have a polarity'which is successively reversed in<br>
the peripheral direction. Also the pole faces, which lie opposite one another in the axial<br>
direction, of the permanent magnets 27 of the two armature discs have different polarities.<br>
The permanent magnets 27 are retained in recesses in the armature discs 26a, 26b, whereby<br>
permanent magnets 27 which succeed one another in the peripheral direction are interlocked<br>
to form a horseshoe magnet in each case by connection of their end faces remote from the<br>
coil by means of a yoke made from hard or soft magnetic material largely enclosing a<br>
magnetic field.<br>
Electromagnet components 28, each having a coil core 32' bearing a coil winding 30<br>
consisting of one or more conductors, are disposed on the inner wall of the peripheral<br>
housing wall 16 - likewise at uniform angular spacings. The ends of the conductors of the<br>
coil winding 30 are connected to an electronic control device by which the electric current<br>
delivered to the control device from an electric current source is fed into the coils 30 in a<br>
controlled manner in such a way that in the electromagnet components 28 a magnetic<br>
rotating field is generated which in interaction with the permanent magnets 27 disposed in the<br><br>
armature discs 26a, 26b results in a relative rotation of the rotor and thus of the shaft 24 with<br>
respect to the housing 12. Thus in conjunction with the aforementioned electronic control -<br>
not shown — the electric machine according to Figure 1 constitutes a brushless electric axial<br>
field motor which can be driven by a direct current source. When conversely the shaft 24 is<br>
driven, an electric rotating field is generated by the permanent magnets 27 in the<br>
electromagnet components 28 rotating with the armature discs (26a, 26b), and this field can<br>
be tapped at the ends of the coils 30 of the electromagnet components 28 and used as direct<br>
current by a suitable rectifying circuit. The electric rotating field can alternatively be<br>
converted into rotating or alternating current by corresponding electronic control means<br>
52, such as shown in FIG. 6. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 6, in a preferred embodiment, a<br>
position pick-up 50, as is well known in the art and which senses the relative rotational<br>
position of the rotor in the housing 12, is associated with the control means 52 for<br>
initiating the switching over of the polarity of the electromagnet components 28.<br>
Figure 2 shows an embodiment of an electric machine according to the invention which is<br>
designated as a whole by 10' in which the power is increased without increasing the diameter<br>
in that two rows of electromagnet components 28 which are spaced from one another are<br>
disposed in the interior of the housing 12 in the longitudinal direction of the rotor shaft. In<br>
addition to the two outer armature discs 26a, 26b which are guided in front of the outer end<br>
faces of the coil cores, pointing in opposite directions, of the electromagnet components 28<br>
the rotor has a third armature disc 26c additionally guided into the space between the two<br>
rows of electromagnet components 28. Permanent magnets 27 are set in this central armature<br>
disc 26. In this way the air gaps between the pole faces of the permanent magnets 27 and the<br>
end surfaces of the coil cores 32 of the electromagnet components 28 in the central armature<br>
disc 26c can be kept small and thus losses due to magnetic leakage fields are avoided. Here<br>
too the peripheral housing wall 16 is again divided along a central plane for assembly<br>
reasons.<br><br>
Apart from the second row of electromagnet components 28 disposed offset in the axial<br>
direction and the arrangement of the additional central armature disc 26c, the machine<br>
corresponds functionally to the aforementioned electric machine described in connection<br>
with Figure 1, so that with regard to the construction of the electric machine 10' it is<br>
otherwise sufficient to refer to the preceding description of the machine 10, since<br>
components of the two machines which are functionally the same are assigned the same<br>
reference numerals in the drawings.<br><br><br>
lt can be seen that a further increase in power without an increase in diameter is possible by<br>
arrangement of one or more further axially offset rows of electromagnet components between<br>
each of which an additional armature disc with permanent magnets is disposed.<br>
From the sectional view shown diagrammatically in Figure 3 of the electric machine shown<br>
in Figure 1 it can be seen that from the peripheral wall 16 of the housing 12 electromagnet<br>
components 28 - twenty-four in all in the illustrated case - are disposed in uniform<br>
distribution and offset with respect to one another in the peripheral direction.<br>
The shaft 24 bears - as mentioned - the rotor which is retained non-rotatably on it and is also<br>
shown separately in Figures 4 and 5, this rotor having the two armature discs 26a, 26b made<br>
from non-magnetic material which are spaced from one another and extend radially into the<br>
vicinity of the peripheral housing wall 16 and in which are disposed the permanent magnets<br>
27 which succeed one another in the peripheral direction and are held at uniform angular<br>
spacings, and in fact in the present case there are twelve permanent magnets in all, of which<br>
the pole faces which face inwards, i.e. towards the respective opposing armature disc 26b,<br>
26a) have polarities which are successively reversed in the peripheral direction. Also the<br>
pole faces, which lie opposite in the axial direction, of the permanent magnets 27 of the two<br>
armature discs 26a, 26b have different polarities. In the illustrated embodiment each pole<br>
face of a permanent magnet extends in the peripheral direction over two pole faces of the coil<br>
cores 32 of electromagnet components which succeed one another in the peripheral direction.<br>
The ends (not shown) of the conductors of the coil winding 30 of the electromagnet<br>
components extend beyond the housing and are then connected in a suitable manner to the<br>
electronic control device already mentioned by which the electric current delivered from an<br>
electric current source is fed into the coils of the electromagnet components in a controlled<br>
manner in such a way that the electromagnet components 28 generate the magnetic rotating<br>
field which in interaction with the permanent magnets disposed on the armature discs 26a,<br>
26b results in the rotation of the rotor and thus of the shaft 24.<br><br>
The armature discs 26a, 26b are each disposed on the outer end surfaces of a hub body 36<br>
(Figures 4 and 5) from which radial walls 38 protrude into the space between the armature<br>
discs 26a, 26b, the radial extent thereof being chosen such that the electromagnet<br>
components 28 protruding radially inwards from the peripheral housing wall 16 can still<br>
enter radially into the space between the armature discs 26a, 26b without butting against the<br>
radially outer ends of the radial walls 38 projecting from the hub body 36. Between each pair<br>
of radial walls 38 of the hub body 36 which succeed one another in the peripheral direction<br>
there are additionally provided radial walls 38' which are fixed on the inner faces of the<br>
armature discs 26a, 26b which face one another, so that a row of chambers 40 is formed<br>
which succeed one another in the peripheral direction, these chambers being closed off<br>
internally by the hub body 36 and laterally by the armature discs 26a, 26b respectively.<br>
Immediately above the hub body 36 inner holes 46 which lead into the chambers 40 are<br>
provided in both armature discs 26a and 26b. Thus with the rotor rotating air can pass via the<br>
holes 46 out of the interior of the housing and into the chamber 40 and is accelerated radially<br>
outwards there by the centrifugal force of the rotating rotor. This air flowing radially<br>
outwards then leaves the chambers 40 and encounters the electromagnet components<br>
projecting from the peripheral wall 16 of the housing 12 into the space between the armature<br>
discs 26a, 26b and passes through the spaces between these components, flows around them<br>
and can then pass beyond the peripheral surface of the armature discs again and into the<br>
space between armature discs 26a, 26b and the housing end walls 14a, 14b. Thus the rotor<br>
formed by the hub body, the radial walls 38 and 38' and the armature discs 26a, 26b<br>
simultaneously constitute the impeller of a fan which effects a forced circulating floWof the<br>
air enclosed in the housing or - in special cases - of a gas filling introduced there. As soon<br>
as the temperature in the forced circulating flow rises above the ambient temperature, heat is<br>
removed via the housing, i.e. the peripheral housing wall 16 and the housing end walls 14a<br>
and 14b, to the external atmosphere. The provision of ribs on the surfaces of the housing<br>
promotes not only the transfer of heat from the forced circulating flow in the interior of the<br>
housing to the housing but also the emission of heat from the housing to the surrounding<br>
atmosphere. Instead of the forced circulating flow in the interior of the housing, cooling with<br>
external air can also take place if air inlets are provided in the housing end walls 14a and 14b<br>
approximately in alignment with the holes 46 in the armature discs 26a, 26b and outlet<br><br>
openings are provided in the peripheral housing wall 16 in the region between the<br>
electromagnet components 28.<br>
Figure 6 shows schematically the circuit of an electromagnetic component 28 of a special<br>
construction of the electromagnet components in which the coil core bears two coil windings<br>
30a and 30b which are wound in opposing winding directions one above the other. It can be<br>
seen that the ends of the two coil windings 30a, 30b are connected to the same current<br>
conductor, whilst the other ends of the two coil windings are each connected to separate<br><br>
conductors leading to an electronic control unit by means of which the second current<br>
conductor can be selectively switched to the first coil winding 30a or the second coil winding<br>
30b.<br>
With regard to the illustration of the coil winding in Figure 6 it should also be pointed out<br>
that only half of the coil winding 30a is shown here in order to be able to show the upper part<br>
of the coil winding 30b lying below it. In practice the winding 30a extends over the entire<br>
length of the coil core 32. In such a case this is also referred to as a reversed-polarity<br>
differential winding.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 6, in a preferred embodiment, the ends of the electrical<br>
conductors of each electromagnet component 28 which form the coil winding 30 are<br>
connected to the input connections of a separate rectifying circuit 54, which is integrated<br>
in the EC 52 as known in the art and is connected on the output side to a pair of electric<br>
bus lines. In a still further preferred embodiment, an electronic inverter circuit 56, which<br>
is integrated in the EC 52 also as known in the art, is connected downstream of the<br>
generator in order to convert the generated direct current into an alternating or three-<br>
phase current which is synchronized with the power supply.<br><br>
It can be seen that within the scope of the inventive idea modifications and variants of the<br>
described embodiments of the electric machine 10 or 10' are possible.<br>
When the electric machine 10 is driven as an electric motor, instead of the rotary power take-<br>
off via the shaft 24 assumed in the description, as an alternative the shaft 24 can also be fixed<br>
via a suitable flange to a rigid component. When the motor is supplied with current the<br>
housing 12 is then set in rotation. In this embodiment the electric machine can be used as a<br>
wheel hub motor for driving vehicles directly on the wheels. In order that the electromagnet<br>
components 28, which in this case would rotate with the housing 12, do not have to be<br>
controlled via sliding contacts or brushes with electric current, the arrangement of the<br>
permanent magnets 27 and the electromagnet components 28 is advantageously exchanged,<br>
i.e. the electromagnet components are disposed in the rotor which is now held non-rotatably<br>
on the fixed shaft, whilst the permanent magnets 27 are disposed on the inner faces of the<br><br><br>
housing, i.e. the inner faces of the housing end walls 14a, 14b. In practice this is then a<br>
kinematic reversal of the electric machine 10. The current supply to the electromagnet<br>
components then takes place via supply lines which are laid firmly in the shaft.<br><br><br>
