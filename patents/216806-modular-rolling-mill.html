This invention relates to single strand modular rolling mills for rolling long products such as bars, rods and the like.<br>
2. Description of the Prior Art<br>
With reference initially to Figure 1, a known modular rolling mill of the type described in the commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 5,595,083 is shown comprising at least three, and in this case, five rolling units RU] - RU5 arranged in succession on a mill pass line PL. Each rolling unit has multiple pairs of work rolls lOa, lOb. The work rolls may be sized and grooved to provide a typical oval-round pass sequence, with successive roll pairs being offset by 90° to effect a twist-free rolling sequence on a product being directed along the mill pass line.<br>
Except for the size and/or groove configuration of the work rolls, the rolling units are identical and interchangeable one for the other at any location along the mill pass line. With reference to Figure 2, which is a diagrammatic illustration of the mternal drive components of a typical rolling unit, it will be seen that the work rolls lOa are mounted in cantilever fashion on the ends of roll shafts 12 rotatably supported by bearings 14. Gears 16 on the roll shafts mesh with intermeshed intermediate drive gears 18, the latter being carried on intermediate drive shafts 20 journalled for rotation between bearings 22. The work rolls lOb are mounted and driven by mirror image components identified by the same reference numerals. One of<br>
each pair of intermediate drive shafts 20 is additionally provided with a bevel gear 24 meshing with a bevel gear 26 on an input shaft 28. The input shafts 28 protrude from a "drive side" of the rolling unit where they terminate in coupling halves 30a.<br>
The two input shafts are additionally provided with gears 32 which mesh with a larger diameter intermediate gear 34. It will thus be seen that the work roll pairs lOa, lOb of each rolling unit are mechanically interconnected as a result of the interengagment between the gears 32 on the input shafts 28 and the intermediate gear 34.<br>
Returning to Figure 1, it will be seen that drive units DU, - DU4 are arranged in succession alongside the mill pass line PL. Each drive unit includes a gear box 36 driven by a drive motor 38. The gear boxes have gear connected output shafts 40 terminating in coupling halves 30b. It will be understood that the coupling halves 30a on the input shafts 28 of the rolling units are designed to mate with the coupling halves 30b on the output shafts 40 of the gear boxes 36 to provide readily separable drive connections, thereby accommodating ready engagement and disengagement of the rolling units from the drive units. The input shafts 28 of each of the rolling units RU2, RU3, RU4, i.e., all but the first and last rolling units, are coupled to the output shafts 40 of two successive drive units DU[ - DU4. The first and last rolling units RU,, RUj are coupled respectively and exclusively to the first and last drive units DU,, DU5.<br>
It will thus be seen that the drive units DU, - DU4 are coupled one to the other via the internal drive components of the rolling units RU, - RU5 to thereby provide a continuous drive train from one end to the other of the modular mill. With this arrangement, as the front end of a product enters each successive roll pass, the resulting momentary speed decrease is transmitted throughout all of the rolling units, thereby making it possible to maintain<br>
substantially constant interstand product tension in a self regulating manner without resort to external controls. This continuous drive train drives the successive work roll pairs at progressively higher speeds as depicted graphically in Figure 3.<br>
Modular rolling mills of the above described type are widely used to roll low, medium, high carbon and low alloy steel products, where the heat build-up between roll pairs is relatively modest. For example, when rolling a 16.8mm process section into a 5.5mm rod at delivery speeds of lOOm/sec, heat build-up between the first and last roll pairs of the modular mill is likely to be on the order of 100 to 150°C. However, more exotic products, e.g., nickel based alloys, high speed steels, waspalloys, etc. cannot tolerate such temperature increases. Since there is insufficient space between the rolling units to accommodate sufficient water cooling, up to now one option has been to substitute water boxes for selected rolling units. While this provides added cooling, it does so by sacrificing the continuity of the drive train.<br>
Another option has been to reduce the rolling speed of the mill in order to reduce energy build up in the product being rolled. This too is unsatisfactory because it results in a reduction in the output of the mill. Lower temperature thermomechanical rolling has also been difficult to achieve, again due to the inability to introduce adequate cooling between the successive rolling units.<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide a gap in the rolling sequence of the modular mill in order to accommodate the introduction of additional cooling, without interrupting the continuity of the drive train.<br>
NUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, gear units are installed between selected rolling units in place of other rolling units which have been "dummied", i.e., removed from the mill pass line to thereby provide a gap in the rolling sequence. Each gear unit is coupled to the drive units previously coupled to the respective dummied rolling unit, and is configured to provide a continuation of the mill drive train end to accommodate operation of the next subsequent rolling unit at the speed of the respective dummied rolling unit. The gear units carry water boxes or other equivalent cooling devices which serve to lower the temperature of the product between successive.roll passes.<br>
The present invention relates to a modular rolling mill having at least<br>
three rolling units (RU1 -RU5) arranged in succession on a mill pass line<br>
(PL)   said   rolling   units   having   work   roll   pairs   (10a,10b)   arranged<br>
successively to effect a rolling sequence on a product directed along said<br>
mill   pass   line,   with   a   plurality   of  drive   units   (DU1-DU4)   arranged<br>
successively alongside said mill pass line, and with coupling means for<br>
providing a continuous drive train by connecting all but the first and last<br>
of said rolling units to two successive drive units and for connecting the<br>
first and last of said rolling units to the first and last of said drive units,<br>
said drive train being operative to drive the successive work roll pairs at<br>
progressively higher speeds, characterized by the provision of apparatus<br>
for providing a gap in said rolling sequence without interrupting the<br>
continuity of said drive train, said apparatus comprising a gear unit (GUi<br>
-GU2 constructed to be installed between two rolling units in a space<br>
created by the removal of another of said rolling units from said mill pass<br>
line, said gear unit being coupled to the drive units previously coupled to<br>
the removed rolling unit and being configured to accommodate operation<br>
of the next subsequent rolling unit at the speed of said removed rolling<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
In accordance with the present invention, as shown in Figures 4-6, gear units GUi, GU2 are installed along the mill pass line PL in place of dummied rolling units RUa, RLLj, the latter having been displaced laterally from the mill pass line PL to the "work side" of the mill. As can best be seen in Figure 5, each gear unit includes input shafts 42 rotatably supported by bearings 44. The input shafts 42 carry gears 46 which mesh with a central gear 48 carried on an intermediate shaft 50 also rotatably supported by bearings 52. The shafts have protruding ends terminating in coupling halves 30c.<br>
The coupling halves 30c are adapted to mate with the coupling halves 3 Ob of the drive units that were previously coupled to the dummied rolling units. The gear trains 46, 48, 46 of the gear units replace the gear trains of the dummied rolling units, thereby accommodating gaps in the rolling sequence without interrupting the overall drive train of the mill.<br>
The gear train of each gear unit is designed to accommodate operation of the next subsequent rolling unit at the speed of the dummied rolling unit. Thus, it will be seen by a comparison of Figures 3 and 6 that by introducing gear unit GUi in place of rolling unit RUi, with an appropriate adjustment of the speeds of the drive motors 38, the rolling unit RUs can be<br>
operated at the speed of the dummied rolling unit RU2. Likewise, the introduction of gear unit GU2 enables the rolling unit RUs to be operated at the speed of the dummied rolling unit RU4.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, the gear units GU1 and GU2 are advantageously provided with water nozzles 54 and associated equalizing guide pipes 56 for cooling the product. The resulting temperature reduction between successive rolling units enables the more exotic products mentioned above to be rolled at higher speeds than would otherwise be possible with the continuous rolling sequence of the mill configuration depicted in Figure 1. This result is achieved without interrupting the continuity of the mill drive train.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
