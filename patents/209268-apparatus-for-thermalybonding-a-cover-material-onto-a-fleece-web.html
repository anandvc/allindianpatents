Field   of   the   Invention<br>
The invention relates  to  a  sealing roller, particularly for a device  for producing a  tampon for feminine  hygiene  as  well   as   a method   for producing  a tampon.<br>
Background  of  the  Invention<br>
Friese,   US  Pat.   No.   4,616,100   discloses   a  method and a  device  for producing a  tampon  for the  feminine hygiene.     The method includes  sectioning a  fluid<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
permeable and at lease partially thermoplastic material and heat sealing it cntc an absorbent nenwoven fiber material or fleece web.  Individual sections of the absorbent are severed from the fleece web supply and are wound onto themselves to form a tampan blank having a withdrawal cord.  Thereby the fluid permeable cover material is positioned on the circumference of the tampon blank and surrounds it essentially completely. Finally, the tampon blank is pressed radially into the final shape of the tampon.  Friese also employs a sealing roller to heat sealing the ccver material onto the fleece web cr the fleece web section.  The sealing roller of Friese comprises beatable sealing elements that are spaced apart around the circumference of the sealing roller.  Insulating means are arranged between these sealing elements.  Thus, the sealing roller sealing elements and insulating elements alternate about the surface of the sealing roller in the direction of rotation.<br>
Wilkes et al., US Pat. No. 5,634,914, discloses multilimbed regenerated cellulose fibers which patentee claims provide high absorbency and a cotton-like handle.<br>
These tampons are described as having good stability and absorbency.  Longitudinally-expanding tampons having these fibers are described as having less expansion than conventional longitudinally-expanding tampons.<br>
Finally, Nguyen et al., WO97/23185 discloses tampons that can expand in the presence of hign. huimdity<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
after insertion into a user's body to pravar.t early bypass leakage from occurring.  This campcn is a substantially cylindrical mass cf compressed fibers enclosed within a fluid-permeable cover.  The tairmen has a stability of at least about 15 N, and is capable cf radially expanding upcr. exposure co a humid environment.<br>
The radius increases by at least about 10% after 15 minutes tc 90% relative humidity at 40°C.  Particularly useful in this tampon are multilimbed fibes such as those in Wilkes et al.  These fibers are relatively stiff to help the early expansion of the tampons.<br>
Unfortunately processing these fibers causes difficulty, especially when a fibrous web having stiff fibers, such as the multilimbed fibers of Wiikes, are exposed to unexpected or undesired delays during manufacture.  Such delays can allow previously calendered or compressed fibrous webs to bloom or expand, possibly due to humidity, as described in Nguyen et al.  This expansion can cause jams or other undesirable process interruption.<br>
Therefore, what is needed is a device and process to produce a high-quality tampon that secures a sufficient calendering of the fibrous fleece web for fibers that are otherwise hard to maintain in a compressed condition at a low cost.<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
An apparatus for thermally bending a cover material onto an absorbent:, fibrous web has a substantially cylindrical, rotacable sealing roller and a rotatable anvil roller disposed adjacent the sealing roller to provide a nip therebetween.  The cover material and fibrous web can be sealed and calendered in the nip cf this apparatus.  The sealing roller includes a sealing element and an ironing element, and both of these elements have thermally conductive material and a leading and a trailing end in the direction o£ rotation. The sealing roller has at least one pair of sealing and ironing elements positioned sequentially on the circumferential surface of the sealing roller in the direction cf rotation.  At least one end of the ironing element is thermally insulated from an adjacent end of an adjacent sealing element.<br>
The process for producing a tampon includes the following steps: a) applying a cover sheet to a fibrous web; b) passing the fibrous web and cover sheet combination through the nip cf a sealing roller and an anvil roller; c) applying heat to a first portion of the combination at a first temperature range sufficient to bond the cover sheet to the absorbent web; and d) applying heat to a second portion of the combination at a second temperature range insufficient to bond the cover sheet to the absorbent web and sufficient to calendar the fibrous web.  The sealing roller provides<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
heat at both tha firs- and second temperature ranges to the cover sheec and fibrous web combination.<br>
Again, it is an object cf the invention to provide a device and a process to produce a high-quality tampon that secures a sufficient calendering of the fibrous fleece web far fibers that are otherwise hard to maintain in a compressed condition at a low coat device for producing a high-quality tampon which secures a sufficient calendering cf the fleece web for fibers which are hard to calender at low cost.  This object is solved by the apparatus including the sealing roller and the process of the present invention.<br>
Brief Description.of the Invention<br>
Pig. 1 shows diagrammatically in cross-section an embodiment of the inventive sealing roller.<br>
Fig. 2 shows in an perspective view another embodiment: of an inventive sealing roller and a fleece web section with cover material sealed onto it.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
In order to form the fleece web into the desired fleece thickness and fleece intensity, the fleece web usually is calendared, i.e., pressure and temperature are applied to it.  Depending from the kind of fibers used for the fleece web, it turned out to be problematic that the fleece web is not sufficiently treated by standard calendering so that only a "subcaiendering"<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
takes place.  IT. order tc achieve the desired fleece thickness and intensity cf the fleece web, some fibers especially the fibers which are preferred because cf their higher absorptive capacity, require several calendering steps which in the production process is complicated and, thus, expensive.<br>
According to the invention, the sealing roller having at least one sealing element located at the circumference cf the sealing roller comprises at least one beatable ironing element consisting of thermally conducting material that is thermally separated at at least one end from at least one adj.acent sealing element.  "Thermally separated" in this case means that there is essentially no, or in comparison with the relevant heating energies or energy differences, no considerable haat transport between the elements, so that the elements are at least largely insulated against<br>
each other.<br>
Thus, it is achieved that pressure and temperature are applied to the fleece web at its entire length by the sealing roller.  In addition to the original object of the sealing roller, namely the sealing of cover material onto the fleece web, the fleece web is ironed and calendered without requiring a further process step or an additional device for the already complex and expensive processes or process machines, respectively. Even hard to calendar fibers are reliably and durably<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
formed into the desired shape by the repeated ironing cr calendering respectively.<br>
The fleece web may include any absorbent materials that are capable of absorbing and/cr retaining liquids (e.g., menses).  The absorbent structure can be manufactured in a wide variety of sizes and shapes and from a wide variety of liquid-absorbing materials.  A representative, non-limiting list of useful materials includes celluiosic materials, such as rayon, cotton, wood pulp, creped cellulose wadding, tissue wraps and laminates, peat moss, and chemically stiffened, modified, cr cross-linked cellulosic fibers; polymeric materials, such as polyester fibers, polyolefin fibers, absorbent foams, absorbent sponges, superabsorbent polymers, absorbent gelling materials ; formed fibers, such as capillary channel fibers and multilimbed fibers; combinations of materials, such as synthetic fibers and wood pulp including coformed fibrous structures (e.g., those materials described in Anderson et al. , U.S. Patent No. 4,100,224); cr any equivalent material cr combinations of materials, or mixtures of these. However, che present invention is particularly useful for processing fleece webs containing multilimbed fibers, such as those disclosed in Wilkes, US Pat. No. 5,634,914, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Useful cover materials used in conjunction with the present invention will be recognized by ths ordinarily<br><br>
- s -<br>
skilled practitioner.  Known cover materials include woven, knit, and nonwoven fabrics; two-dimensional and three-dimensional apertured films; polymeric nets; and the like.  Preferably, the cover material is a ncnwcven fabric or a three-dimensional apertured film.  Such nonwoven materials are disclosed in Friese, US Pat. No. 4,816,100, the disclosure cf which is herein incorporated by reference.  In addition, the apertured film cover of the present invention can be manufactured by standard processes known to those of ordinary skill in tha art.  Fcr exassple, the base film that is to be apertured can be extruded, cast, or blown to form the film.  The base film can be a single formulated polymeric material or blend, cr it can be a laminated or multi-layered material such as described in commonly assigned, co-pending applications to Johnson et al. , US Ser. No., 09/345,030, and Gell et al., US Ser. No., 09/345,085, the.disclosures cf which are herein incorporated by reference.  Useful technology to form these films will be easily recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art.  The base film can then be apertured by any useful process-  Several examples include hot air aperturing, and water jet aperturing-Examples of these processes are disclosed in Curro, US Pat. NO. 4,655,422; Turi. US Pat. No. 5,567,376; and Mullane, US Fat. No. 4,741,877; the disclosures of each of these patents are hereby incorporated by reference. The resulting apertured film can be coated, for example<br><br>
- s -<br>
as described ir. commonly assigned, co-pending application US Ser. No., 09/345,085, filed June 30, 1539, entitled "Tampcn with Cover and Nonicnic Surfactant" (Attorney Docket ??C-708) , and/or slit to a desired width for use in manufacturing a tampon.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the rear end of the at least one ircning element, as seen from the rotating direction of the sealing roller, is in thermal contact with the sealing element positioned behind the ircning element in the rotating direction and the front end ir. the rotating direction of the at least one ironing element is separated from the heatable sealing element which is located in front of the ironing element when seen from the direction of rotation.  Thus, the ircning element is heated indirectly via the thermal contact cf the sealing element.  An additional heating device for the ironing element is not required.  Moreover, the temperature of the ironing element is automatically adaoted to the desired temperature predetermined or required for the heat sealing.  The temperature applied to the fleece web slowly decreases from the highest temperature at the sealing element adjacent an insulating element or space to the front end of the ironing element and finally to the rear end of the ironing element to constantly calender the fleece web.<br>
It is additionally guaranteed that a maximum temperature of the ironing element is not exceeded in the area in which a heat sealing of the cover material<br><br>
-   10    -<br>
is  to be prevented.     An undesirable  heat  sealing cf  the cover material onto the  fleecs web  is prevented and at the same  time the  fleece web material  is   ironed and calendered whereby a  remarkably  improved  fiber  structure cf  the   fleece  web  is  achieved.<br>
The material  of  the   ironing  element  may be chosen from numerous  thermally  conducting materials.     In general,   metals,   in particular  aluminum,   are  the preferred materials.     Depending on the  choice cf material   and  the  corresponding  heat  conductivity,   the course  of   temperature  cr  the   temperature  gradient respectively may be determined  in case  of   an above-mentioned partial  thermal  contact  and optimally adapesd to  the  material  in use  cf  either  the   flesce  web and the cover material.<br>
The  thermally separated ends  of   the  ironing element and the  sealinc element  are  preferably spaced apart   in a predetermined distance  so that  an. insulating air aperture  is  formed.     it   is  also possible  to place an insulating  element between the  thermally separated elements.      Preferably,   the sealing  element and the ironing element  are not  completely thermally separated. However,   the desired level  of   insulation may be determined   in relation to  the   chosen  spaces  between the elements  or  the  applied insulating elements.     The heat conductivity cr  the heat  contact  respectively of  the ends  of  the   ironing element  and the  sealing  element being  in  thermal  contact may  considerably be  improved if<br><br>
-lithe ironing element and the sealing element at lease partially overlap and/cr are ac least partially interlocked.  The overlapping may be realized wherein the end portion cf the sealing element is graded or inclined and is located below or above a correspondingly formed end portion of the ironing element and is engaged with it.  This overlapping may also be regarded and designated as a "radial interlocking".  A second possibility is an at least partial interlocking of both elements a- the cuter surface, in general in a coaxial rotating direction cf the sealing roller.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the sealing roller comprises two diametrically opposed sealing elements and two diametrically opposed ironing elements.  This results for usual lengths of the cover material, which is applied in the form of strips of the fleece web section, respectively, in a simple and easy-to-realize geometry and dimension of the sealing roller.  Thus, the desired geometrical arrangement of the ironing elements and the sealing elements is secured without requiring a great curvature cf the surfaces of the elements resulting from a sealing roller having a small diameter.<br>
Naturally, it is possible to arrange only one sealing element and one ironing element or more than two sealing elements and two ironing elements alternately.  The dimension of the sealing roller increases with the number of sealing and ironing elements provided for, since the circumferential length of the single elements<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
depend from the ceonetry cf the materials tc be treated the cover material and the fleece web section, as explained above.<br>
Preferably, the; temperature of the sealing elements is adjustable by a control to allow adjustment cf the sealing element temperature tc maintain it at a desired target temperature.  Appropriate thermal sensors may be used to monitor the temperature.  The adjustable temperature centre! allows the device to be adapted to the materials to be processed, so that a variety of fibers and cover materials such as those materials described above may be processed in a high quality manner.<br>
In another embodiment, in addition tc the sealing elements, the ironing elements are directly heatable. Thus, further possibilities for the temperature control of the ironing elements exist, the ironing elements especially have a constant temperature without any temperature gradient alone their entire area in care this is desired for the final product to be processed. In such an embodiment, it is likely that both ends cf each ironing element are thermally separated from adjacent sealing elements.<br>
The invention further relates to a method for producing a tampon for feminine hygiene.  In particular, it relates co a method involving thermally sealing an at least partially thermoplastic cover material to a fleece web at a desired sealing temperature.  The method<br><br>
according cc the invention, also provides for ironing the fleecs web at an ironing temperature at a location between the areas of the cover material that are sealed whereby the maximum, ironing temperature does not exceed the sealing temperature.  In the areas in which the ironinc element works on the cover material, the ironing temperature should net be high enough to cause unintentional sealing or damage tc the cover material. As described above in connection with the device according tc che invention, by such method, the fleece web is at the same time calendered over its surface by the required sealing process, i.e., pressure and temperature are applied.  The desired fleece web structure and fleece web thickness is secured without the requirement of a new process station and additional devices.<br>
The preferred sealing temperature is 140°C for the preferred fleece web containing cotton and rayon or rayon blends and a cover material containing polyethylene.  This provides a reliable heat sealing of the materials in use.  The cover material is reliably bonded with the fleece web section in the desired bond region while the rest of the cover material attains a temperature that does not cause it to bond cr otherwise be damaged.<br>
In another embodiment of the method according to the invention, the ironing temperature is essentially constant which is preferably realized by a separate<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
heating of the ironing element.  With this method, cue end cf the ironing element may be in thermal contact with the sealing element leading at least in a partial area cf the ironing element to a temperature gradient or the sealing element may be thermally completely separatee, the latter being the preferred variation.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an embodiment of an inventive sealing roller 1 having two sealing elements 10 arranged diametrically facing each other and two ironing elements 20 arranged between the sealing elements 10, said ironing elements 20 diametrically facing each other. The circumferential length of the sealing elements 10 corresponds exactly to the length of a range of a fleece web 100 to be sealed onto the cover material 200.<br>
The sealing elements 10 as well as the ironing elements 20 are made of a thermally conductive material.<br>
A representative, non- limiting list of materials includes metals such'as steel, including stainless steel, mild stsei, tool steel, and the like; and aluminum.  Useful stainless steels include the 300 series including 303, 304, and 316; the 400 series, and the 300 series.  Useful mild steels include 1018 and 1020.  Useful aluminum alloys include the 2000 series including 2024; the 3000 series including 3003; the 5000 series including 50£2 and 5080; the 6000 series including 6061, 6063, and 6082; and the 7000 series including 7075.  These materials can be coated with appropriate coatings to protect the sealing element from<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
corrosion and wear and to reduce the likelihood cf the sealed material from adhering to the tooling surfaces. Such materials will be recognized by these of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Keating elements are associated with the sealing elements 10 in a manner to prcvide well-controlled heat to the sealing bars 16.  Preferably, the heating elements controllable to provide a heat accuracy of +/-5° C, more preferably, about +/- 2° C.  This can be achieved by placing, e.g., two heating elements symmetric to a middle plane of the sealing element 10, or three or more elements in appropriate locations on the sealing element.  Alternatively, it is possible to employ a single plate heating element or to incorporate conduits within the sealing element 10 to accommodate a circulated heating fluid.  In addition, a temperature control element, such as a thermocouple, can be provided close to the sealing surfaces, e.g., at the middle plane of the sealing element 10.<br>
The ends 22 of the ironing elements 20 which, in the direction of rotation of sealing roller 1, marked by arrow x, are positioned at the rear end, are in thermal contact with each sealing element 10 positioned back of it.  The ends of the ironing elements 20 being the front ends 21 in the direction of rotation are thermally separated from each sealing element 10 positioned in front of it.  The thermal separation can be simply realized by an air gap.  In the current embodiment,<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
however, the use of a high hear insulating plastic element 15 is intended.<br>
In operation the sealing elements 10 are heated up to a temperature of l40°C.  Via a thermal contact 3 0 heat energy is transferred from the sealing element 10 to the ironing element 20 so that each ironing element 20 has also a temperature of 140° C at its rear end in close proximity to the thermal contact 30.  The ironing elements 2 0 show a temperature gradient because of the existing cooling so that in the current embodiment there is a temperature of about S0° C at a front end 21 of each of the ironing elements 20 being separated from the sealing element 10 next to it by the insulating elements 15.<br>
A crsasure roller 50 presses the fleece web 100 against the sealing roller so that the cover material 200 is securely sealed onto the fleece web by sealing elements 10.  Furthermore, it is provided for another transport and/or driving roller 60 that drives the fleece web 100 and/or holds it in the desired position.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a perspective view of a further embodiment of an inventive sealing roller as well as a fleece web auction 105 with a strip of cover material 200 sealed onto it.  The sealing elements 10 comprise sealing bars 16 arranged in transverse rows and at distances from one another with said sealing bars projecting about 0-3 cm from a base 17 of the sealing elements 10.<br><br>
The   ironing  elements   20   are  no:   shown  in Fig.   2, they  merely   consist  cf  circle   segments  with  a substantially  smooth but   curved  surface  which  can be inserted  into  the  sealing  roller   1.     By  a passible exchange   cf   the  ironing  elements   20   the  temperature  and especially  the temperature  gradient  cf  the  ironing elements   can  be  adapted  to   the   desired object   and  the used materials,   respectively  in  dependence  on the material   and  its  thermal  conductivity.     As  shown in the embodiment   of  Fig.  1,   the  thermal   contact  is provided for between  the  ends being   the   rear  ends  of  the  ironing elements   2 0   in  the  direction  cf   rotation x  and  the respective   sealing  elements   10   positioned back cf  it whereas   the   ends  being  the   front   ends  21  of  the  ironing elements   20   in the direction  of   rotation x  are  separated from  the   respective  sealing   elements  10  positioned  in front   of   it   after the   ironing  elements  having boon inserted  into  the sealing roller  1.<br>
It   is   again to be  stated that  in the  scope of  the invention  further variations  of   the  sealinq bars  are possible   and applicable.      In  addition to  sealing the cover to  the  fleece web,   the  sealing bars  16  of  the sealing  element  10  can extend beyond the cover material to  additional  compress or  calender the fleece web.     This provides   further beneficial  calendering to stiff  fibers that  may  be   included  in  the   fleece  web.<br><br>
