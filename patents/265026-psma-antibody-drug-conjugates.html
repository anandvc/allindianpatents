PSMA ANTIBODY-DRUG CONJUGATES<br>
Related Applications<br>
This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 119 of United States provisional<br>
application 60/692,399, filed June 20,2005 and United States provisional application<br>
60/792,360, filed April 14,2006, the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference in their entirety.<br>
Government Support<br>
Aspects of the invention may have been made using funding from National Institutes<br>
of Health Grants CA107653 (DM) and CA96075 (GPD). Accordingly, the government may<br>
have rights to the invention.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates generally to antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). In particular,<br>
the invention relates to ADCs which comprise an antibody or antigen-binding fragment<br>
thereof which binds to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and is conjugated to<br>
monomethylauristatin norephedrine (MMAE) or monomethylauristatin phenylalanine<br>
(MMAF). The antibody-drug conjugate has a PC-3™ cell to C4-2 or LNCaP™ cell<br>
selectivity of at least 250. The invention also relates, in part, to compositions of and methods<br>
of using the ADCs. The methods provided include, for example, methods for treating a<br>
PSMA-mediated disease.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy and the second leading cause of<br>
cancer death in men in the United States (Jemal A, et al., CA Cancer J Clin 2005;55:10-30).<br>
Localized prostate cancer typically is treated with surgery or radiation, and recurrent disease<br>
can be controlled temporarily with androgen ablation. (Klein EA, et al., Urol Clin North Am<br>
2003 ;30:315-30). However, almost all prostate carcinomas eventually become hormone<br>
refractory and then rapidly progress (Denmeade SR, et al., Nat Rev Cancer 2002;2:389-96).<br>
Hormone-refractory or androgen-independent prostate cancer has proven to be largely<br>
resistant to conventional chemotherapy. With the exception of palliative care, the only<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-2-<br>
approved chemotherapy is docetaxel in combination with prednisone, which offers a modest<br>
(2.4 month) survival benefit (Gulley J, et al., Am J Ther. 2004;351:1513-20; Petrylak DP, et<br>
al., New Engl J Med 2004;351:1513-20). New molecularly targeted therapies are needed.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention provided herein relates to ADCs that exhibit particularly high<br>
selectivity. In one aspect of the invention an antibody-drug conjugate is provided that<br>
comprises an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof which binds to PSMA and is<br>
conjugated to monomethylauristatin norephedrine or monomethylauristatin phenylalanine,<br>
wherein the antibody-drug conjugate has a PC-3™ cell to C4-2 or LNCaP™ cell selectivity<br>
of at least 250. In one embodiment, the selectivity is at least 500,1000, 2500, 6000 or<br>
13,000. In another embodiment, the selectivity is 1567, 6286 or 13,636. In some<br>
embodiments, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof is conjugated to at least 3, 4<br>
or 5 monomethylauristatin norephedrine or monomethylauristatin phenylalanine molecules.<br>
Examples of antibodies that can be used in the compositions and methods of the<br>

Brief Description of the Figures<br>
Fig. 1 is a graph that shows the percent internalization and total binding of 111in-<br>
labeled PSMA mAb on C4-2 cells. C4-2 cells were incubated with 111In-labeled mAb at<br>
37°C, 5% CO2. At the designated times, cells were washed to remove unbound mAb, and<br>
surface bound mAb was stripped using low pH buffer. The radioactivity (counts per minute<br>
(CPM)) of the low pH eluate and cell pellet was counted separately using a gamma counter.<br>
Percent internalization (Fig. 1A) was calculated as the CPM cell pellet/(CPM cell pellet +<br>
CPM low pH eluate) x 100. Total binding (Fig. 1B) represents the CPM of the cell pellet<br>
plus the CPM of the low pH eluate.<br>
Fig. 2 is a graph showing the binding of PSMA mAb and ADC to 3T3™-PSMA cells.<br>
3T3™-PSMA cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of the PSMA mAb (filled<br>

incubated on ice for 1h and washed to remove unbound mAb or ADC. The cells were then<br>
incubated with goat anti-human IgG-FITC, washed again and examined by flow cytometry.<br>
The mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs) are plotted as a function of mAb or ADC<br>
concentration.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates, in part, to the surprising discovery that ADCs<br>
comprising a PSMA-binding antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof conjugated to<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-13-<br>
MMAE (also referred to herein as monomethylauristatin E and monomethylauristatin<br>
norephedrine) or MMAF (also referred to herein as monomethylauristatin F and<br>
monomethylauristatin phenylalanine) are particularly useful for killing PSMA-expressing<br>
cells. The ADCs can have a PC-3™ cell to C4-2 or LNCaP™ cell selectivity of at least 250.<br>
In some embodiments, the ADCs exhibit certain levels of cell killing (of PSMA-expressing<br>
cells), e.g., IC50 values that are at or near picomolar concentrations. In other embodiments,<br>
the ADCs effect a cure rate of at least 20%, 30%, 40% or 50% in mice treated with the ADC<br>
with a regimen of q4d x 6 at a dose of 6 mg/kg. Compositions of and methods of using these<br>
ADCs are, therefore, provided. In some embodiments, the mice are those as provided in the<br>
Examples. In one embodiment, the mice are those that are a model of androgen-independent<br>
human prostate cancer. In another embodiment, the mice are nude mice engrafted with C4-2<br>
cells intramuscularly in the left hind-leg.<br>
The antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof of the ADCs are any antibody or<br>
antigen-binding fragment thereof that binds PSMA. In one embodiment the antibody or an<br>
antigen-binding fragment thereof specifically binds PSMA (e.g., specifically binds an<br>
extracellular domain of PSMA, specifically binds a conformational epitope of PSMA, etc.)<br>
and can competitively inhibit the specific binding of a second antibody to its target epitope on<br>
PSMA, wherein the second antibody is selected from the group consisting of PSMA 3.7,<br>
PSMA 3.8, PSMA 3.9, PSMA 3.11, PSMA 5.4, PSMA 7.1, PSMA 7.3, PSMA 10.3, PSMA<br>
1.8.3, PSMA A3.1.3, PSMA A3.3.1, Abgenix 4.248.2, Abgenix 4.360.3, Abgenix 4.7.1,<br>

heavy chain encoded by a nucleic acid molecule comprising a coding region or regions of a<br>
nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of nucleotide sequences set forth as<br>
SEQ ID NOs: 2-7, and (b) a light chain encoded by a nucleic acid molecule comprising a<br>
coding region or regions of a nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of<br>
nucleotide sequences set forth as SEQ ID NOs: 8-13. The second antibody, therefore,<br>
include any of the antibodies produced by the hybridomas or encoded by the plasmids shown<br>
below in Table 1. These hybridomas and plasmids were deposited pursuant to, and in<br>
satisfaction of, the requirements of the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of<br><br>

To determine competitive inhibition, a variety of assays known to one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art can be employed. For example, cross-competition assays can be used to .<br>
determine if an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof competitively inhibits binding<br>
to PSMA by another antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof. These include cell-based<br>
methods employing flow cytometry or solid phase binding analysis. Other assays that<br>
evaluate the ability of antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof to cross-compete for<br>
PSMA molecules that are not expressed on the surface of cells, in solid phase or in solution<br>
phase, also can be used.<br>
In some embodiments, the antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof<br>
competitively inhibit the specific binding of a second antibody to its target epitope on PSMA<br>
by at least about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 99%. -<br>
Inhibition can be assessed at various molar ratios or mass ratios; for example competitive<br>
binding experiments can be conducted with a 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, 7-fold, 10-fold or<br>
more molar excess of a first antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof over a second<br>
antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof.<br>
In another embodiment the antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof<br>
specifically binds to an epitope on PSMA defined by an antibody selected from the group<br>
consisting of PSMA 3.7, PSMA 3.8, PSMA 3.9, PSMA 3.11, PSMA 5.4, PSMA 7.1, PSMA<br>

4.54.1,4.153.1,4.232.3,4.292.3,4.304.1,4.78.1, and 4.152.1. PSMA 3.7, PSMA 3.8, PSMA<br>

4.304.1, Abgenix 4.78.1, Abgenix 4.152.1 and antibodies comprising (a) a heavy chain<br>
encoded by a nucleic acid molecule comprising a coding region or regions of a nucleotide<br>
sequence selected from the group consisting of nucleotide sequences set forth as SEQ ID<br>
NOs: 2-7, and (b) a light chain encoded by a nucleic acid molecule comprising a coding<br>
region or regions of a nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of nucleotide<br>
sequences set forth as SEQ ID NOs: 8-13. The antibodies or antigen-binding fragments of<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-17-<br>
the ADCs, therefore, include those that specifically bind to an epitope on PSMA defined by<br>
the antibodies produced by the hybridomas or encoded by the plasmids provided above in<br>
Table 1.<br>
To determine the epitope, one can use standard epitope mapping methods known in<br>
the art. For example, fragments (peptides) of PSMA antigen (e.g., synthetic peptides) that<br>
bind the antibody can be used to determine whether a candidate antibody or antigen-binding<br>
fragment thereof binds the same epitope. For linear epitopes, overlapping peptides of a<br>
defined length (e.g., 8 or more amino acids) are synthesized. The peptides can be offset by 1<br>
amino acid, such that a series of peptides covering every 8 amino acid fragment of the PSMA<br>
protein sequence are prepared. Fewer peptides can be prepared by using larger offsets, e.g., 2<br>
or 3 amino acids. In addition, longer peptides (e.g., 9-, 10- or 11-mers) can be synthesized.<br>
Binding of peptides to antibodies or antigen-binding fragments can be determined using<br>
standard methodologies including surface plasmon resonance (BIACORE) and ELISA<br>
assays. For examination of conformational epitopes, larger PSMA fragments can be used.<br>
Other methods that use mass spectrometry to define conformational epitopes have been<br>
described and can be used (see, e.g., Baerga-Ortiz et al., Protein Science 11:1300-1308, 2002<br>
and references cited therein). Still other methods for epitope determination are provided in<br>
standard laboratory reference works, such as Unit 6.8 ("Phage Display Selection and Analysis<br>
of B-cell Epitopes") and Unit 9.8 ("Identification of Antigenic Determinants Using Synthetic<br>
Peptide Combinatorial Libraries") of Current Protocols in Immunology, Coligan et al., eds.,<br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons. Epitopes can be confirmed by introducing point mutations or deletions<br>
into a known epitope, and then testing binding with one or more antibodies or antigen-<br>
binding fragments to determine which mutations reduce binding of the antibodies or antigen-<br>
binding fragments.<br>
In particular embodiments, the antibodies of the ADCs, or from which the antigen-<br>
binding fragments of the ADCs are derived, are those produced by hybridomas referred to<br>
herein as PSMA 3.7, PSMA 3.8, PSMA 3.9, PSMA 3.11, PSMA 5.4, PSMA 7.1, PSMA 7.3,<br>
PSMA 10.3, PSMA 1.8.3, PSMA A3.1.3, PSMA A3.3.1, Abgenix 4.248.2, Abgenix 4.360.3,<br>
Abgenix 4.7.1, Abgenix 4.4.1, Abgenix 4.177.3, Abgenix 4.16.1, Abgenix 4.22.3, Abgenix<br>
4.28.3, Abgenix 4.40.2, Abgenix 4.48.3, Abgenix 4.49.1, Abgenix 4.209.3, Abgenix 4.219.3,<br>

other embodiments, the antibodies are those encoded by the plasmids shown in Table 1. In<br>
still other particular embodiments, the antibodies are those that comprise a heavy chain<br>
encoded by a nucleic acid molecule comprising the heavy chain coding region or regions of a<br>

interchangeably with the names of the antibodies. It would be clear to one of ordinary skill in<br>
the art when the name is intended to refer to the antibody or when it refers to the plasmids or<br>
hybridomas that encode or produce the antibodies, respectively. Additionally, the antibody<br>
names may be an abbreviated form of the name shown in Table 1. For instance, antibody<br>

encodes a polypeptide sequence. Its use herein is consistent with the recognized meaning<br>
known in the art.<br>
In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the ADCs, or from which the antigen-<br>
binding fragments of the ADCs are derived, are those that are encoded by nucleic acid<br>
molecules that are highly homologous to the foregoing nucleic acids. The homologous<br>

the nucleotide sequence is at least about 95% identical, at least about 97% identical, at least<br>
about 98% identical, or at least about 99% identical to a nucleotide sequence provided herein.<br>
The homology can be calculated using various, publicly available software tools well known<br>
to one of ordinary skill in the art. Exemplary tools include the BLAST system available from<br>
the website of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National<br>

One method of identifying highly homologous nucleotide sequences is via nucleic<br>
acid hybridization. Thus, the invention also includes antibodies having the PSMA-binding<br>
properties and other functional properties described herein, which are encoded by nucleic<br>
acid molecules that hybridize under high stringency conditions to the foregoing nucleic acid<br>
molecules. Identification of related sequences can also be achieved using polymerase chain<br>
reaction (PCR) and other amplification techniques suitable for cloning related nucleic acid<br>
sequences. PCR primers can be selected to amplify portions of a nucleic acid sequence of<br>
interest, such as a CDR.<br>
The term "high stringency conditions", as used herein, refers to parameters with<br>
which the art is familiar. Nucleic acid hybridization parameters may be found in references<br>
that compile such methods, e.g. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, J. Sambrook, et<br>
al., eds., Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New<br>
York, 1989, or Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, F.M. Ausubel, et al., eds., John<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York. One example of high-stringency conditions is hybridization<br>
at 65°C in hybridization buffer (3.5X SSC, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinyl pyrrolidone,<br>
0.02% Bovine Serum Albumin, 2.5mM NaH2PO4(pH7), 0.5% SDS, 2mM EDTA). SSC is<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-21-<br>
0.15M sodium chloride/0.015M sodium citrate, pH7; SDS is sodium dodecyl sulphate; and<br>
EDTA is ethylenediaminetetracetic acid. After hybridization, a membrane upon which the<br>
nucleic acid is transferred is washed, for example, in 2X SSC at room temperature and then at<br>
0.1 - 0.5X SSC/0.1X SDS at temperatures up to 68°C.<br>
As used herein, the term "antibody" refers to a glycoprotein comprising at least two<br>
heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds. Each heavy<br>
chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as HCVR or VH) and<br>
a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three<br>
domains, CH1 , CH2 and CH3. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region<br>
(abbreviated herein as LCVR or VL) and a light chain constant region. The light chain<br>
constant region is comprised of one domain, CL. The VH and VL regions can be further<br>
subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions<br>
(CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR).<br>
Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to<br>
carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The<br>
variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an<br>
antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies may mediate the binding of the<br>
immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g.,<br>
effector cells) and the first component (C1q) of the classical complement system.<br>
The term "antigen-binding fragment" of an antibody as used herein, refers to one or<br>
more portions of an antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to an antigen (i.e.,<br>
PSMA). It has been shown that the antigen-binding function of an antibody can be<br>
performed by fragments of a full-length antibody. Examples of binding fragments<br>
encompassed within the term "antigen-binding fragment" of an antibody include (i) a Fab<br>
fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) a<br>
F(ab')2 fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide<br>
bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (iv) a<br>
Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb<br>
fragment (Ward et al, (1989) Nature 341:544-546) which consists of a VH domain; and (vi)<br>
an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR). The CDRs, and in particular the<br>
CDR3 regions, and more particularly the heavy chain CDR3 contribute to antibody<br>
specificity. Because these CDR regions and in particular the CDR3 region confer antigen<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-22-<br>
speciflcity on the antibody these regions may be incorporated into other antibodies or<br>
antigen-binding fragments to confer the identical antigen specificity onto that antibody or<br>
peptide. Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, V and VH, are coded for<br>
by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that<br>
enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to<br>
form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv); see e.g., Bird et al. (1988)<br>
Science 242:423-426; and Huston et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 85:5879-5883).<br>
Such single chain antibodies are also intended to be encompassed within the term "antigen-<br>
binding fragment" of an antibody. These antibody fragments are obtained using conventional<br>
procedures, such as proteolytic fragmentation procedures, as described in J. Goding,<br>
Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, pp 98-118 (N.Y. Academic Press 1983),<br>
which is hereby incorporated by reference as well as by. other techniques known to those with<br>
skill in the art. The fragments are screened for utility in the same manner as are intact<br>
antibodies.<br>
The antibodies, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, of the ADCs are, in some<br>
embodiments, isolated. "Isolated", as used herein, is intended to refer to an antibody (or<br>
antigen-binding fragment thereof), which is substantially free of other antibodies (or antigen-<br>
binding fragments) having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody that<br>
specifically binds to PSMA is substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens<br>
other than PSMA). An isolated antibody that specifically binds to an epitope, isoform or<br>
variant of PSMA may, however, have cross-reactivity to other related antigens, e.g., from<br>
other species (e.g., PSMA species homologs). Moreover, an isolated antibody (or antigen-<br>
binding fragment thereof) may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or<br>
chemicals. As used herein, "specific binding" refers to antibody binding to a predetermined<br>
antigen, in this case PSMA. Typically, the antibody binds with an affinity that is at least two-<br>
fold greater than its affinity for binding to a non-specific antigen (e.g., BSA, casein), which is<br>
an antigen other than PSMA, an isoform or variant of PSMA, or a closely-related antigen.<br>
The antibodies encompass various antibody isotypes, such as IgG1, IgG2, IgG3,<br>
IgG4, IgM, IgA1, IgA2, IgAsec, IgD, IgE. As used herein, "isotype" refers to the antibody<br>
class (e.g., IgM or IgGl) that is encoded by heavy chain constant region genes. The<br>
antibodies can be full length or can include only an antigen-binding fragment such as the<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-23-<br>
antibody constant and/or variable domain of IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgM, IgA1, IgA2,<br>
IgAsec, IgD or IgE or could consist of a Fab fragment, a F(ab')2 fragment and a Fv fragment.<br>
The antibodies of the ADCs, or from which the antigen-binding fragments of the<br>
ADCs are derived, are, in some embodiments monoclonal. The antibodies can be produced<br>
by a variety of techniques well known in the art. Monoclonal antibody production may be<br>
effected by techniques which are well known in the art. The term "monoclonal antibody", as<br>
used herein, refers to a preparation of antibody molecules of single molecular composition.<br>
A monoclonal antibody displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular<br>
epitope. The process of monoclonal antibody production involves obtaining immune somatic<br>
cells with the potential for producing antibody, in particular B lymphocytes, which have been<br>
previously immunized with the antigen of interest either in vivo or in vitro and that are<br>
suitable for fusion with a B-cell myeloma line.<br>
Mammalian lymphocytes typically are immunized by in vivo immunization of the<br>
animal (e.g., a mouse) with the desired protein or polypeptide. Such immunizations are<br>
repeated as necessary at intervals of up to several weeks to obtain a sufficient titer of<br>
antibodies. Once immunized, animals can be used as a source of antibody-producing<br>
lymphocytes. Following the last antigen boost, the animals are sacrificed and spleen cells<br>
removed. Mouse lymphocytes give a higher percentage of stable fusions with the mouse<br>
myeloma lines described herein. For example, of the BALB/c mouse. However, other mouse<br>
strains, rabbit, hamster, sheep and frog may also be used as hosts for preparing antibody-<br>
producing cells. See; Goding (in Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, 2d ed., pp.<br>
60-61, Orlando, Fla., Academic Press, 1986). In particular, mouse strains that have human<br>
immunoglobulin genes inserted in the genome (and which cannot produce mouse<br>
immunoglobulins) can be used. Examples include the HuMAb mouse strains produced by<br>
Medarex/GenPharm International, and the XenoMouse strains produced by Abgenix. Such<br>
mice produce fully human immunoglobulin molecules in response to immunization. In some<br>
embodiments, therefore, the ADCs comprise a fully human monoclonal antibody or an<br>
antigen-binding fragment thereof that binds PSMA.<br>
Those antibody-producing cells that are in the dividing plasmablast stage fuse<br>
preferentially. Somatic cells may be obtained from the lymph nodes, spleens and peripheral<br>
blood of antigen-primed animals, and the lymphatic cells of choice depend to a large extent<br>
on their empirical usefulness in the particular fusion system. The antibody-secreting<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-24-<br>
lymphocytes are then fused with (mouse) B cell myeloma cells or transformed cells, which<br>
are capable of replicating indefinitely in cell culture, thereby producing an immortal,<br>
immunoglobulin-secreting cell line. The resulting fused cells, or hybridomas, are cultured,<br>
and the resulting colonies screened for the production of the desired monoclonal antibodies.<br>
Colonies producing such antibodies are cloned, and grown either in vivo or in vitro to<br>
produce large quantities of antibody. A description of the theoretical basis and practical<br>
methodology of fusing such cells is set forth in Kohler and Milstein, Nature 256:495 (1975),<br>
which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Alternatively, human somatic cells capable of producing antibody, specifically B<br>
lymphocytes, are suitable for fusion with myeloma cell lines. While B lymphocytes from<br>
biopsied spleens, tonsils or lymph nodes of an individual may be used, the more easily<br>
accessible peripheral blood B lymphocytes can also be used. The lymphocytes may be<br>
derived from patients with diagnosed prostate carcinomas or another PSMA-expressing<br>
cancer. In addition, human B cells may be directly immortalized by the Epstein-Barr virus<br>
(Cole et al., 1995, Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-<br>
96). Although somatic cell hybridization procedures can be used, in principle, other<br>
techniques for producing monoclonal antibodies can be employed such as viral or oncogenic<br>
transformation of B lymphocytes.<br>
Myeloma cell lines suited for use in hybridoma-producing fusion procedures can be<br>
non-antibody-producing, have high fusion efficiency, and enzyme deficiencies that render<br>
them incapable of growing in certain selective media which support the growth of the desired<br>
hybridomas. Examples of such myeloma cell lines that may be used for the production of<br>
fused cell lines include P3-X63/Ag8, X63-Ag8.653, NS1/1.Ag 4.1, Sp2/0-Agl4, FO, NSO/U,<br>
MPC-11, MPC11-X45-GTG 1.7, S194/5XX0 Bui, all derived from mice; R210.RCY3, Y3-<br>
Ag 1.2.3, IR983F and 4B210 derived from rats and U-266, GM1500-GRG2, LICR-LON-<br>
HMy2, UC729-6, all derived from humans (Goding, in Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles<br>
and Practice, 2d ed., pp. 65-66, Orlando, Fla., Academic Press, 1986; Campbell, in<br>
Monoclonal Antibody Technology, Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular<br>
Biology Vol. 13, Burden and Von Knippenberg, eds. pp. 75-83, Amsterdam, Elseview,<br>
1984).<br>
Fusion with mammalian myeloma cells or other fusion partners capable of replicating<br>
indefinitely in cell culture is effected by standard and well-known techniques, for example,<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-25-<br>
by using polyethylene glycol ("PEG") or other fusing agents (See Milstein and Kohler, Eur.<br>
J. Immunol. 6:511 (1976), which is hereby incorporated by reference).<br>
In other embodiments, the antibodies of the ADCs, or from which the antigen-binding<br>
fragments of the ADCs are derived, are recombinant antibodies. The term "recombinant<br>
antibody", as used herein, is intended to include antibodies that are prepared, expressed,<br>
created or isolated by recombinant means, such as antibodies isolated from an animal (e.g., a<br>
mouse) that is transgenic for another species' immunoglobulin genes, antibodies expressed<br>
using a recombinant expression vector transfected into a host cell, antibodies isolated from a<br>
recombinant, combinatorial antibody library, or antibodies prepared, expressed, created or<br>
isolated by any other means that involves splicing of immunoglobulin gene sequences to<br>
other DNA sequences.<br>
In yet other embodiments, the antibodies are chimeric or humanized antibodies. As<br>
used herein, the term "chimeric antibody" refers to an antibody, that combines the murine<br>
variable or hypervariable regions with the human constant region or constant and variable<br>
framework regions. As used herein, the term "humanized antibody" refers to an antibody that<br>
retains only the antigen-binding CDRs from the parent antibody in association with human<br>
framework regions (see, Waldmann, 1991, Science 252:1657). Such chimeric or humanized<br>
antibodies retaining binding specificity of the murine antibody are expected to have reduced<br>
immunogenicity when administered in vivo for applications according to the invention.<br>
According to an alternative embodiment, the monoclonal antibodies of the present<br>
invention can be modified to be in the form of a bispecific antibody, or a multispecific<br>
antibody. The term "bispecific antibody" is intended to include any agent, e.g., a protein,<br>
peptide, or protein or peptide complex, which has two different binding specificities which<br>
bind to, or interact with (a) a cell surface antigen and (b) an Fc receptor on the surface of an<br>
effector cell. The term "multispecific antibody" is intended to include any agent, e.g., a<br>
protein, peptide, or protein or peptide complex, which has more than two different binding<br>
specificities which bind to, or interact with (a) a cell surface antigen, (b) an Fc receptor on the<br>
surface of an effector cell, and (c) at least one other component. Accordingly, the antibodies<br>
include, but are not limited to, bispecific, trispecific, tetraspecific, and other multispecific<br>
antibodies which are directed to PSMA and to Fc receptors on effector cells. The term<br>
"bispecific antibodies" further includes diabodies. Diabodies are bivalent, bispecific<br>
antibodies in which the VH and VL domains are expressed on a single polypeptide chain, but<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-26-<br>
using a linker that is too short to allow for pairing between the two domains on the same<br>
chain, thereby forcing the domains to pair with complementary domains of another chain and<br>
creating two antigen-binding sites (see e.g., Holliger, P., et ah (1993) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci.<br>
USA 90:6444-6448; Poijak, R.J., et al (1994) Structure 2:1121-1123).<br>
A bispeciflc antibody can be formed of an antigen-binding region specific for PSMA<br>
and an antigen-binding region specific for an effector cell which has rumoricidal or tumor<br>
inhibitory activity. The two antigen-binding regions of the bispecific antibody are either<br>
chemically linked or can be expressed by a cell genetically engineered to produce the<br>
bispecific antibody. (See generally, Fanger et al., 1995 Drug News &amp; Perspec. 8(3):133-137).<br>
Suitable effector cells having rumoricidal activity include but are not limited to cytotoxic T-<br>
cells (primarily CD8+cells), natural killer cells, etc. An effective amount of a bispecific<br>
antibody according to the invention can be administered to a subject with cancer and the<br>
bispecific antibody kills and/or inhibits proliferation of the cancer cells after localization at<br>
sites of primary or metastatic tumors bearing PSMA.<br>
In certain embodiments, the antibodies of the ADCs, or from which the antigen-<br>
binding fragments of the ADCs are derived, are human antibodies. The term "human<br>
antibody", as used herein, is intended to include antibodies having variable and constant<br>
regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. The human antibodies of<br>
the invention can include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline<br>
immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific<br>
mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo). However, the term "human antibody",<br>
as used herein, is not intended to include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from<br>
the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse have been grafted onto human<br>
framework sequences (referred to herein as "humanized antibodies"). Human antibodies<br>
directed against PSMA can be generated using transgenic mice carrying parts of the human<br>
immune system rather than the mouse system. Some examples of which were described<br>
above.<br>
Fully human monoclonal antibodies also can be prepared by immunizing mice<br>
transgenic for large portions of human immunoglobulin heavy and light chain loci. See, e.g.,<br>
U.S. patents 5,591,669, 5,598,369, 5,545,806, 5,545,807, 6,150,584, and references cited<br>
therein, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. These animals have been<br>
genetically modified such that there is a functional deletion in the production of endogenous<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
- 27 -<br>
(e.g., murine) antibodies. The animals are further modified to contain all or a portion of the<br>
human germ-line immunoglobulin gene locus such that immunization of these animals results<br>
in the production of fully human antibodies to the antigen of interest. Following<br>
immunization of these mice (e.g., XenoMouse (Abgenix), HuMAb mice<br>
(Medarex/GenPharm)), monoclonal antibodies are prepared according to standard hybridoma<br>
technology. These monoclonal antibodies have human immunoglobulin amino acid<br>
sequences and therefore will not provoke human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) responses<br>
when administered to humans. In general, but not intended to be limiting, the mice are 6-16<br>
weeks of age upon the first immunization. For example, a purified or enriched preparation of<br>
PSMA antigen (e.g., recombinant PSMA or PSMA-expressing cells) is used to immunize the<br>
mice intraperitoneally (IP), although other routes of immunization known to one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art are also possible. PSMA antigen is injected in combination with an adjuvant,<br>
such as complete Freund's adjuvant, and, in some embodiments, the initial injection is<br>
followed by booster immunizations with antigen in an adjuvant, such as incomplete Freund's<br>
adjuvant. The immune response is monitored over the course of the immunization protocol<br>
with plasma samples obtained by, for example, retroorbital bleeds. The plasma is screened<br>
by ELISA, and mice with sufficient titers of anti-PSMA human immunoglobulin are used for<br>
fusions. Mice are boosted intravenously with antigen 3 days before sacrifice and removal of<br>
the spleen.<br>
The antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the ADCs can, in some<br>
embodiments, be selected for the ability to bind live PSMA-expressing cells. In order to<br>
demonstrate binding to live PSMA-expressing cells, flow cytometry can be used. For<br>
example, PSMA-expressing cells lines (grown under standard growth conditions) or prostate<br>
cancer cells that express PSMA are mixed with various concentrations of monoclonal<br>
antibodies in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 80 and 20% mouse serum, and incubated at 37°C<br>
for 1 hour. After washing, the cells are reacted with fluorescein-Iabeled anti-human IgG<br>
secondary antibody (if human anti-PSMA antibodies were used) under the same conditions as<br>
the primary antibody staining. The samples can be analyzed by a fluorescence activated cell<br>
sorter (FACS) instrument using light and side scatter properties to gate on single cells. An<br>
alternative assay using fluorescence microscopy can be used (in addition to or instead of) the<br>
flow cytometry assay. Cells can be stained and examined by fluorescence microscopy. This<br>
method allows visualization of individual cells, but may have diminished sensitivity<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-28-<br>
depending on the density of the antigen. It follows, that the ADCs, in some embodiments,<br>
bind live cells. The ADCs, in some embodiments, therefore, do not require cell lysis to bind<br>
PSMA.<br>
The antibodies can, in some embodiments, promote cytolysis of PSMA-expressing<br>
cells. Cytolysis can be complement-mediated or can be mediated by effector cells. In one<br>
embodiment, the cytolysis is carried out in a living organism, such as a mammal, and the live<br>
cell is a tumor cell. Examples of tumors which can be targeted with the antibodies or<br>
antigen-binding fragments thereof include, any tumor that expresses PSMA (this includes<br>
tumors with neovascualture expressing PSMA), such as, prostate, bladder, pancreas, lung,<br>
colon, kidney, melanomas and sarcomas. In one embodiment, the tumor cell is a prostate<br>
cancer cell.<br>
The testing of cytolytic activity in vitro by chromium release assay can provide an<br>
initial screening prior to testing in vivo models. This testing can be carried out using standard<br>
chromium release assays. Briefly, polymorphonuclear cells (PMN), or other effector cells,<br>
from healthy donors can be purified by Ficoll Hypaque density centrifugation, followed by<br>
lysis of contaminating erythrocytes. Washed PMNs can be suspended in RPMI<br>
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and mixed with 51Cr labeled cells<br>
expressing PSMA, at various ratios of effector cells to tumor cells (effector cellsrtumor cells).<br>
Purified anti-PSMA IgGs can then be added at various concentrations. Irrelevant IgG can be<br>
• used as a negative control. Assays can be carried out for 0-120 minutes at 37°C. Samples<br>
can be assayed for cytolysis by measuring 51Cr release into the culture supernatant. Anti-<br>
PSMA monoclonal antibodies and/or ADCs can also be tested in combinations with each<br>
other to determine whether cytolysis is enhanced with multiple monoclonal antibodies and/or<br>
ADCs. Antibodies that bind to PSMA and/or ADCs also can be tested in an in vivo model<br>
(e.g., in mice) to determine their efficacy in mediating cytolysis and killing of cells<br>
expressing PSMA, e.g., tumor cells.<br>
The antibodies of the ADCs, or from which the antigen-binding fragments of the<br>
ADCs are derived, can be selected, for example, based on the following criteria, which are<br>
not intended to be exclusive:<br>
1)	binding to live cells expressing PSMA;<br>
2)	high affinity of binding to PSMA;<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-29-<br>
3)	binding to a unique epitope on PSMA (i.e., an epitope not recognized<br>
by a previously produced antibody);<br>
4)	opsonization of cells expressing PSMA;<br>
5)	mediation of growth inhibition, phagocytosis and/or killing of cells<br>
expressing PSMA in the presence of effector cells;<br>
6)	modulation (inhibition or enhancement) of NAALADase, folate<br>
hydrolase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV and/or γ-glutamyl hydrolase<br>
activities;<br>
7)	growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and/or cytotoxicity in the absence of<br>
effector cells;<br>
8)	internalization of PSMA;<br>
9)	binding to a conformational epitope on PSMA;<br>
10)	minimal cross-reactivity with cells or tissues that do not express<br>
PSMA; and<br>
11)	preferential binding to dimeric forms of PSMA rather than monomeric<br>
forms of PSMA.<br>
The antibodies can meet one or more, and possibly all, of these criteria.<br>
In one embodiment, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof binds to a<br>
conformational epitope, such as a conformational epitope within the extracellular domain of<br>
PSMA. To determine if an anti-PSMA antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof binds to<br>
conformational epitopes, each antibody can be tested in assays using native protein (e.g., non-<br>
denaturing immunoprecipitation, flow cytometric analysis of cell surface binding) and<br>
denatured protein (e.g., Western blot, immunoprecipitation of denatured proteins). A<br>
comparison of the results will indicate whether the antibody or antigen-binding fragment<br>
thereof binds a conformational epitope. Antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof that<br>
bind to native protein but not denatured protein are, in some embodiments, those that bind<br>
conformational epitopes. It follows, that the ADCs, in some embodiments, bind<br>
comforrnational epitopes of PSMA.<br>
In another embodiment, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof binds to a<br>
dimer-specific epitope on PSMA. Generally, antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof<br>
which bind to a dimer-specific epitope preferentially bind the PSMA dimer rather than the<br>
PSMA monomer. To determine if an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof binds<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-30-<br>
preferentially (i.e., selectively and/or specifically) to a PSMA dimer, the antibody or antigen-<br>
binding fragment thereof can be tested in assays (e.g., immunoprecipitation followed by<br>
Western blotting) using native dimeric PSMA protein and dissociated monomeric PSMA<br>
protein. A comparison of the results will indicate whether the antibody or antigen-binding<br>
fragment thereof binds preferentially to the dimer. In some embodiments, the antibodies or<br>
antigen-binding fragments thereof bind to the PSMA dimer but not to the monomeric PSMA<br>
protein. It follows, that the ADCs, in some embodiments, bind to a dimer-specific epitope on<br>
PSMA.<br>
The invention, therefore, also includes ADCs that selectively bind PSMA multimers.<br>
As used herein, particularly with respect to the binding of PSMA multimers by the ADCs,<br>
"selectively binds" means that an antibody preferentially binds to a PSMA protein multimer<br>
(e.g., with greater avidity, greater binding affinity) rather than to a PSMA protein monomer.<br>
In some embodiments, the ADCs of the invention bind to a PSMA protein multimer with an<br>
avidity and/or binding affinity that is 1.1-fold, 1.2-fold, 1.3-fold, 1.4-fold, 1.5-fold, 1.6-fold,<br>
1.7-fold, 1.8-fold, 1.9-fold, 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, 7-fold, 10-fold, 20-fold, 30-fold, 40-<br>
fold, 50-fold, 70-fold, 100-fold, 200-fold, 300-fold, 500-fold, 1000-fold or more than that<br>
exhibited by the ADC for a PSMA protein monomer. The ADC can, in some embodiments,<br>
selectively bind a PSMA protein multimer, and not a PSMA protein monomer, i.e.,<br>
exclusively binds to a PSMA protein multimer. In some embodiments, the ADC selectively<br>
binds a PSMA protein dimer.<br>
A PSMA protein multimer, as used herein, is a protein complex of at least two PSMA<br>
proteins or fragments thereof. The PSMA protein multimers can be composed of various<br>
combinations of full-length PSMA proteins (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1), recombinant soluble<br>
PSMA (rsPSMA, e.g., amino acids 44-750 of SEQ ID NO: 1) and fragments of the foregoing<br>
that form multimers (i.e., that retain the protein domain required for forming dimers and/or<br>
higher order multimers of PSMA). In some embodiments, at least one of the PSMA proteins<br>
forming the multimer is a recombinant, soluble PSMA (rsPSMA) polypeptide. The PSMA<br>
protein multimers can be dimers, such as those formed from recombinant soluble PSMA<br>
protein. In one embodiment, the dimer is a rsPSMA homodimer. The PSMA protein<br>
multimers referred to herein are believed to assume a native conformation and can have such<br>
a conformation. The PSMA proteins in certain embodiments are noncovalently bound<br>
together to form the PSMA protein multimer. For example, it has been discovered that<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-31-<br>
PSMA protein noncovalently associates to form dimers under non-denaturing conditions.<br>
The PSMA protein multimers can retain the activities of PSMA. The PSMA activity may be<br>
an enzymatic activity, such as folate hydrolase activity, NAALADase activity, dipeptidyl<br>
peptidase IV activity or y-glutamyl hydrolase activity. Methods for testing the PSMA<br>
activity of multimers are well known in the art (reviewed by O'Keefe et al. in: Prostate<br>
Cancer: Biology, Genetics, and the New Therapeutics, L.W.K. Chung, W.B. Isaacs and J.W.<br>
Simons (eds.) Humana Press, Totowa, NJ, 2000, pp. 307-326).<br>
The antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the ADCs can bind to and is<br>
internalized with PSMA expressed on cells. The mechanism by which the antibody or<br>
antigen-binding fragment thereof is internalized with PSMA is not critical to the practice of<br>
the present invention. For example, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof can<br>
induce internalization of PSMA. Alternatively, internalization of the antibody or antigen-<br>
binding fragment thereof can be the result of routine internalization of PSMA. It follows that<br>
the ADC can be internalized with PSMA expressed on cells.<br>
The antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof, and therefore the ADCs of the<br>
invention, can specifically bind cell-surface PSMA and/or rsPSMA with sub-nanomolar<br>
affinity. The binding affinities can be about 1 X 10-9M or less, about 1 X 10-10M or less, or<br>
about 1 X 10-11M or less. In a particular embodiment the binding affinity is less than about 5<br>
X 10-10M.<br>
The antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof can, in some embodiments,<br>
modulate at least one enzymatic activity of PSMA. The activity can be selected from the<br>
group consisting of N-acetylated α-linked acidic dipeptidase (NAALADase), folate<br>
hydrolase, dipeptidyl dipeptidase IV, γ-glutamyl hydrolase activity and combinations thereof<br>
in vitro or in vivo. The modulation may be enhancement or inhibition of at least one<br>
enzymatic activity of PSMA.<br>
Tissue levels of NAALADase can be determined by detergent solubilizing<br>
homogenizing tissues, pelleting the insoluble material by centrifugation and measuring the<br>
NAALADase activity in the remaining supernatant. Likewise, the NAALADase activity in<br>
bodily fluids can also be measured by first pelleting the cellular material by centrifugation<br>
and performing a typical enzyme assay for NAALADase activity on the supernatant.<br>
NAALADase enzyme assays have been described by Frieden, 1959, J. Biol, Chem.,<br>
234:2891. In this assay, the reaction product of the NAALADase enzyme is glutamic acid.<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-32-<br>
This is derived from the enzyme catalyzed cleavage of N-acetylaspartylglutamate to yield N-<br>
acetylaspartic acid and glutamic acid. Glutamic acid, in a NAD(P)+ requiring step, yields 2-<br>
oxoglutarate plus NAD(P)H in a reaction catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase. Progress of<br>
the reaction can easily and conveniently be measured by the change in absorbance at 340 nm<br>
due to the conversion of NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H.<br>
Folate hydrolase activity of PSMA can be measured by performing enzyme assays as<br>
described by Heston and others (e.g., Clin. Cancer Res. 2(9): 1445-51,1996; Urology 49(3 A<br>
Suppl):104-12,1997). Folate hydrolases such as PSMA remove the gamma-linked glutamates<br>
from polyglutamated folates. Folate hydrolase activity can be measured using substrates such<br>
as methotrexate tri-gamma glutamate (MTXGlu3), methotrexate di-gamma glutamate<br>
(MTXGlu2) or pteroylpentaglutamate (PteGlu5), for example using capillary electrophoresis<br>
(see Clin. Cancer Res. 2(9):1445-51,1996). Timed incubations of PSMA with<br>
polyglutamated substrates is followed by separation and detection of hydrolysis products.<br>

The ADCs of the invention have been found to have particularly high levels of<br>
selectivity when killing of non-PSMA-expressing cells is compared to killing of PSMA-<br>
expressing cells. Therefore, in some embodiments, the ADCs have a PC-3™ cell to C4-2 cell<br>
or LNCaP™ cell selectivity of at least 250. In other embodiments, the selectivity is at least<br>
300, 350, 400,450, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000,1100,1200,1300, 1400, 1500,1600,<br>
1700,1800,1900, 2000, 2250, 2500,2750, 3000, 3500,4000, 4500, 5000, 5500, 6000, 6500,<br>
7000, 7500, 8000, 8500, 9000, 9500, 10000, 11000,12000, 13000, 14000, 15000, 17500,<br>
20000 or more. In some embodiments, the selectivity is between 250-500, 500-750, 750-<br>
1000,1000-2000, 2000-5000, 5000-10000, 10000-15000 or 15000-20000. "Selectivity", as<br>
defined herein, refers to the ratio of IC50 values of an ADC on PC-3™ cells (non-PSMA-<br>
expressing cells) to C4-2 cells or LNCaP™ cells (PSMA-expressing cells).<br>
It has also been found that the ADCs of the invention mediate, in some embodiments,<br>
PSMA-expressing specific cell killing at very low concentrations, such as at or near<br>
picomolar concentrations. The ADCs, in some embodiments, exhibit IC50S at concentrations<br>
of less than about 1 X 10-10M, less than about 1 X 10-11M, or less than about 1 X 10-12M. In a<br>
particular embodiment, an IC50 is achieved at a concentration of less than about 1.5 X 10-11M.<br>
In another embodiment, the ADCs provided exhibit IC50s of between 10-210, 40-210, 60-210<br>
or 65-210 pM. In yet another embodiment, the ADCs provided exhibit IC50S of about 10, 40,<br>
60 or 80 pM. In still another embodiment, the ADCs provided exhibit IC50S of about 11,42,<br>
60 or 83 pM.<br><br>

It has also been found that the ADCs, in some embodiments, effect a cure rate in mice<br>
of at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 95%. In other embodiments, the<br>
cure rate in mice is about 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 95%. In still other<br>
embodiments, the cure rate is 20-40%, 40-60% or 60-80%. As used herein, "cure rate" refers<br>
to the number of mice still alive after about 500 days from the start of a study period, with no<br>
evidence of a tumor and no measurable PSA levels, divided by the number of mice at the<br>
beginning of the study period. To assess the cure rate, mice are administered 6 mg/kg ADC<br>
with a regimen of q4d x 6. In some embodiments, the number of mice at the beginning of the<br>
study is at least 5,6,7, 8, 9,10,12,15,17,20,25,30 or more mice. Further details regarding<br>
an example of such a study are provided herein below in the Examples. In one embodiment,<br>
the mice are those that are a model of androgen-independent human prostate cancer. In<br>
another embodiment, the mice are nude mice engrafted with C4-2 cells intramuscularly in the<br>
left hind-leg. Techniques for determining the presence of a tumor and for measuring PSA<br>
levels are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Binding of the ADCs of the invention to live PSMA-expressing cells can inhibit the<br>
growth of PSMA-expressing cells, result in cell-cycle arrest (e.g., G2/M arrest), promote<br>
apoptosis of PSMA-expressing cells, etc. As used herein, "result in cell-cycle arrest" refers<br>
to an increase in the number of cells in the G2/M phase due to the administration of an ADC.<br>
In some embodiments, the ADCs can effect apoptosis. In other embodiments, the ADCs<br>
result in both cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis. The ADCs of the invention,<br>
therefore, can be used in various in vitro and in vivo methods for effecting these possible<br>
endpoints. In particular, the ADCs of the invention can be used in methods for treating<br>
PSMA-mediated disease.<br>
As used herein, a "PSMA-mediated disease" is any disease in which PSMA is<br>
causative or a symptom of the disease. PSMA-mediated diseases also include diseases or<br>
disorders in which there is aberrant (e.g., overexpression) of PSMA. PSMA is a 100 kD<br>
Type II membrane glycoprotein expressed in prostate tissues (Horoszewicz et al., 1987,<br>
Anticancer Res. 7:927-935; U.S. Pat. No. 5,162,504). PSMA was characterized as a type II<br>
transmembrane protein having sequence identity with the transferrin receptor (Israeli et al.,<br>
1994, Cancer Res. 54:1807-1811) and with NAALADase activity (Carter et al., 1996, Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 93:749-753). More importantly, PSMA is expressed in increased<br>
amounts in prostate cancer, and elevated levels of PSMA are also detectable in the sera of<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-37-<br>
these patients (Horoszewicz et al., 1987; Rochon et al., 1994, Prostate 25:219-223; Murphy<br>
etal., 1995, Prostate 26:164-168; and Murphy etal., 1995, Anticancer Res. 15:1473-1479).<br>
Therefore, a PSMA-mediated disorder is, for example, prostate cancer. PSMA expression<br>
increases with disease progression, becoming highest in metastatic, hormone-refractory<br>
disease for which there is no present therapy. In addition, provocative data indicates that<br>
PSMA is also abundantly expressed on the neovasculature of a variety of other important<br>
tumors, including bladder, pancreas, sarcoma, melanoma, lung, and kidney tumor cells, but<br>
not on normal vasculature. PSMA-mediated diseases, therefore, include cancers in which<br>
PSMA is expressed on the cells of the tumor or of the tumor neovasculature.<br>
Compositions and methods are, therefore, provided that can be used to treat any<br>
PSMA-mediated disorder. For example, ADCs can be used to inhibit the neovascularization<br>
of a tumor. In another example, PSMA ADCs can be used to kill tumor cells. In some<br>
embodiments, two or more different ADCs are used in combination. In another embodiment,<br>
one or more unconjugated anti-PSMA antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof can be<br>
combined with one or more ADCs in a single therapy to achieve a desired therapeutic effect.<br>
As an illustration, an unconjugated anti-PSMA antibody that mediates highly effective killing<br>
of target cells in the presence of effector cells and/or that inhibits the growth of cells<br>
expressing PSMA can be used with one or more ADCs. In yet another embodiment, the<br>
ADCs can be combined with one or more additional therapeutic agents. Such therapeutic<br>
agents include antitumor agents, such as docetaxel; corticosteroids, such as prednisone or<br>
hydrocortisone; immunostimulatory agents; immunomodulators; or some combination<br>
thereof.<br>
Antitumor agents include cytotoxic agents, chemotherapeutic agents and agents that<br>
act on tumor neovasculature. Cytotoxic agents include cytotoxic radionuclides, chemical<br>
toxins and protein toxins. The cytotoxic radionuclide or radiotherapeutic isotope can be an<br>
alpha-emitting isotope such as 225Ac, 2I1At, 212Bi, 213Bi, 212Pb, mRa or 223Ra. Alternatively,<br>
the cytotoxic radionuclide can be a beta-emitting isotope such as ls6Rh, 188Rh, 177Lu, 90Y, I31I,<br>
67Cu, 64Cu, 153Sm or 166Ho. Further, the cytotoxic radionuclide can emit Auger and low<br>
energy electrons and include the isotopes 125I, 123I or 77Br.<br>
Suitable chemical toxins or chemotherapeutic agents include members of the enediyne<br>
family of molecules, such as calicheamicin and esperamicin. Chemical toxins can also be<br>
taken from the group consisting of methotrexate, doxorubicin, melphalan, chlorambucil,<br><br>

ARA-C, vindesine, mitomycin C, cis-platinum, etoposide, bleomycin and 5-fluorouracil.<br>
Other antineoplastic agents include dolastatins (U.S. Patent Nos. 6,034,065 and 6,239,104)<br>
and derivatives thereof. Dolastatins and derivatives thereof include dolastatin 10 (dolavaline-<br>
valine-dolaisoleuine-dolaproine-dolaphenine) and the derivatives auristatin PHE (dolavaline-<br>
valine-dolaisoleuine-dolaproine-phenylalanine-methyl ester) (Pettit, G.R. et al., Anticancer<br>
Drug Des. 13(4):243-277,1998; Woyke, T. et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.<br>
45(12):3580-3584,2001), and aurastatin E and the like. Toxins also include poisonous<br>
lectins, plant toxins such as ricin, abrin, modeccin, botulina and diphtheria toxins. Other<br>
chemotherapeutic agents are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Agents that act on the tumor vasculature include tubulin-biriding agents such as<br>
combrestatin A4 (Griggs et al., Lancet Oncol. 2:82, 2001), angiostatin and endostatin<br>
(reviewed in Rosen, Oncologist 5:20,2000, incorporated by reference herein) and interferon<br>
inducible protein 10 (U.S. Patent No. 5,994,292). A number of other antiangiogenic agents<br>
are also contemplated and include: 2ME2, Angiostatin, Angiozyme, Anti-VEGF RhuMAb,<br>

Suradista (FCE 26644), Suramin (Metaret), Tetrathiomolybdate, Thalidomide, TNP-470 and<br>
Vitaxin. Additional antiangiogenic agents are described by Kerbel, J. Clin. Oncol.<br>
19(18s);45s-51s, 2001, which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The ADCs can be administered with one or more immunostimulatory agents to induce<br>
or enhance an immune response, such as IL-2 and immunostimulatory oligonucleotides (e.g.,<br>
those containing CpG motifs). Immunostimulatory agents can, in some embodiments,<br>
stimulate specific arms of the immune system, such as natural killer (NK) cells that mediate<br>
antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC). Immunostimulatory agents include<br>
interleukin-2, α-interferon, y-interferon, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα),<br>
immunostimulatory oligonucleotides or a combination thereof. Immunornodulators include<br>
cytokines, chemokines, adjuvants or a combination thereof. Chemokines useful in increasing<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-39-<br>
immune responses include but are not limited to SLC, ELC, MIP3a, MIP3β, IP-10, MIG, and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
The other therapeutic agent can also be a vaccine. In some embodiments, the vaccine<br>
immunizes a subject against PSMA. Such vaccines, in some embodiments, include antigens,<br>
such as PSMA dimers, with, optionally, one or more adjuvants to induce or enhance an<br>
immune response. An adjuvant is a substance which potentiates the immune response.<br>
Adjuvants of many kinds are well known in the art. Specific examples of adjuvants include<br>
monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL, SmithKline Beecham); saponins including QS21<br>
(SmithKline Beecham); immunostimulatory oligonucleotides (e.g., CpG oligonucleotides<br>
described by Kreig et al., Nature 374:546-9,1995);incomplete Freund's adjuvant; complete<br>
Freund's adjuvant; montanide; vitamin E and various water-in-oil emulsions prepared from<br>
biodegradable oils such as squalene and/or tocopherol, Quil A, Ribi Detox, CRL-1005, L-<br>
121, and combinations thereof. Formulations, such as those described in U.S. Application<br>
Serial No. 10/976352, are also contemplated for use as vaccines in the methods provided<br>
herein. The disclosure of such formulations are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The vaccines can, in some embodiments, include one or more of the isolated PSMA<br>
protein multimers described herein, such as the PSMA protein dimer. In some embodiments,<br>
a PSMA protein multimer composition contains at least about 10% PSMA protein multimer<br>
(of the total amount of PSMA protein in the composition). In other embodiments, the PSMA<br>
protein multimer composition contains at least about 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%,<br>
80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 99% or 99.5% PSMA protein multimer. In one embodiment, the<br>
PSMA protein multimer composition contains substantially pure PSMA protein multimer,<br>
with substantially no PSMA protein monomer. It is understood that the list of specific<br>
percentages includes by inference all of the unnamed percentages between the recited<br>
percentages.<br>
Cytokines can also be used in vaccination protocols as a result of their lymphocyte<br>
regulatory properties. Many cytokines useful for such purposes will be known to one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art, including interleukin-2 (IL-2); IL-4; IL-5; IL-12, which has been<br>
shown to enhance the protective effects of vaccines {see, e.g., Science 268: 1432-1434,<br>
1995); GM-CSF; IL-15; IL-18; combinations thereof, and the like. Thus cytokines can be<br>
administered in conjunction with antigen, chemokines and/or adjuvants to increase an<br>
immune response.<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-40-<br>
The other therapeutic agents can be present in the compositions of the invention or<br>
used in the methods of the invention in unconjugated form or in conjugated form, such as<br>
conjugated to an anti-PSMA antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof. Coupling of one<br>
or more toxin molecules to the anti-PSMA antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof can<br>
include many chemical mechanisms, for instance covalent binding, affinity binding,<br>
intercalation, coordinate binding and complexation.<br>
The covalent binding can be achieved either by direct condensation of existing side<br>
chains or by the incorporation of external bridging molecules. Many bivalent or polyvalent<br>
agents are useful in coupling protein molecules to other proteins, peptides or amine functions,<br>
etc. For example, the literature is replete with coupling agents such as carbodiimides,<br>
diisocyanates, glutaraldehyde, diazobenzenes, and hexamethylene diamines: This list is not<br>
intended to be exhaustive of the various coupling agents known in the art but, rather, is<br>
exemplary of the more common coupling agents.<br>
In some embodiments, it is contemplated that one may wish to first derivatize the<br>
antibody, and then attach the therapeutic agent to the derivatized product. Suitable cross-<br>
linking agents for use in this manner include, for example, SPDP (N-succinimidyl-3-(2-<br>
pyridyldithio)propionate), and SMPT, 4-succinimidyl-oxycarbonyl-methyl-(2-<br>
pyridyldithio)toluene.<br>
In addition, protein toxins can be fused to the anti-PSMA antibody or antigen-binding<br>
fragment thereof by genetic methods to form a hybrid immunotoxin fusion protein. The<br>
fusion proteins can include additional peptide sequences, such as peptide spacers which<br>
operatively attach, for example, the anti-PSMA antibody and toxin, as long as such additional<br>
sequences do not appreciably affect the targeting or toxin activities of the fusion protein. The<br>
proteins can be attached by a peptide linker or spacer, such as a glycine-serine spacer peptide,<br>
or a peptide hinge, as is well known in the art. Thus, for example, the C-terminus of an anti-<br>
PSMA antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof can be fused to the N-terminus of the<br>
protein toxin molecule to form an immunotoxin that retains the binding properties of the anti-<br>
PSMA antibody. Other fusion arrangements will be known to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
To express the fusion immunotoxin, the nucleic acid encoding the fusion protein is inserted<br>
into an expression vector in accordance with standard methods, for stable expression of the<br>
fusion protein, such as in mammalian cells, such as CHO cells. The fusion protein can be<br><br>

isolated and purified from the cells or culture supernatant using standard methodology, such<br>
as a PSMA affinity column.<br>
Radionuclides typically are coupled to an antibody or antigen-binding fragment<br>
thereof by chelation. For example, in the case of metallic radionuclides, a bifunctional<br>
chelator is commonly used to link the isotope to the antibody or other protein of interest.<br>
Typically, the chelator is first attached to the antibody, and the chelator-antibody conjugate is<br>
contacted with the metallic radioisotope. A number of bifunctional chelators have been<br>
developed for this purpose, including the diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) series<br>
of amino acids described in U.S. patents 5,124,471, 5,286,850 and 5,434,287, which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference. As another example, hydroxamic acid-based bifunctional<br>
chelating agents are described in U.S. patent 5,756,825, the contents of which are<br>
incorporated herein. Another example is the chelating agent termed p-SCN-Bz-HEHA<br>
(1,4,7,10,13,16-hexaazacyclo-octadecane-N,N',N",N'",N"",N'""-hexaacetic acid) (Deal et al,<br>
J. Med. Chem. 42:2988, 1999), which is an effective chelator of radiometals such as 225Ac.<br>
Yet another example is DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane N,N',N",N"'-tetraacetic<br>
acid), which is a bifunctional chelating agent (see McDevitt et al., Science 294:1537-1540,<br>
2001) that can be used in a two-step method for labeling followed by conjugation.<br>
Other therapeutic agents also include replication-selective viruses. Replication-<br>
competent virus such as the p53 pathway targeting adenovirus mutant d11520, ONYX-015,<br>
kills tumor cells selectively (Biederer, C. et al., J. Mol. Med. 80(3):163-175,2002). The<br>
virus can, in some embodiments, be conjugated to PSMA antibodies or antigen-binding<br>
fragments thereof.<br>
The compositions provided of the present invention can be used in conjunction with<br>
other therapeutic treatment modalities. Such other treatments include surgery, radiation,<br>
cryosurgery, thermotherapy, hormone treatment, chemotherapy, vaccines and other<br>
immunotherapies.<br>
The ADCs of the invention, such as through their antibody or antigen-binding<br>
fragment thereof, can be linked to a label. Labels include, for example, fluorescent labels,<br>
enzyme labels, radioactive labels, nuclear magnetic resonance active labels, luminescent<br>
labels or chromophore labels.<br>
The compositions provided can include a physiologically or pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier, excipient or stabilizer mixed with the ADC. In some embodiments, when<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-42-<br>
a composition comprises two or more different ADCs, each of the antibodies or antigen-<br>
binding fragments thereof of the ADCs binds to a distinct conformational epitope of PSMA.<br>
As used herein, "target cell" shall mean any undesirable cell in a subject (e.g., a<br>
human or animal) that can be targeted by an ADC of the invention. In some embodiments,<br>
the target cell is a cell expressing or overexpressing PSMA. Cells expressing PSMA or<br>
PSMA-expressing cells, typically include tumor cells, such as prostate, bladder, pancreas,<br>
lung, kidney, colon tumor cells, as well as melanoma and sarcoma cells.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be administered in<br>
combination therapy, i.e., combined with other agents. For example, the combination therapy<br>
can include a composition of the present invention with at least one anti-tumor agent,<br>
immunomodulator, immunostimulatory agent or other conventional therapy. The other agent<br>
can be conjugated to or formed as a recombinant fusion molecule with a PSMA antibody or<br>
antigen-binding fragment thereof for directed targeting of the agent to PSMA-expressing<br>
cells. In another embodiment the other therapeutic agent can be unconjugated. Additional<br>
therapeutic agents can be administered or contacted with the PSMA-expressing cells through<br>
co-administration. "Co-administering," as used herein, refers to administering two or more<br>
therapeutic agents simultaneously as an admixture in a single composition, or sequentially,<br>
and close enough in time so that the compounds may exert an additive or even synergistic<br>
effect. In still other embodiments, an additional therapeutic agent can be administered<br>
before, during or after the administration of one or more ADCs or compositions thereof.<br>
As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" or "physiologically acceptable<br>
carrier" includes any and all salts, solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and<br>
antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like that are<br>
physiologically compatible. In some embodiments, the carrier is suitable for intravenous,<br>
intramuscular, subcutaneous, parenteral, spinal or epidermal administration (e.g., by injection<br>
or infusion). Depending on the route of administration, the active compound, can be coated<br>
in a material to protect the compound from the action of acids and other natural conditions<br>
that may inactivate the compound.<br>
When administered, the pharmaceutical preparations of the invention are applied in<br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable amounts and in pharmaceutically-acceptable compositions. The<br>
term "pharmaceutically acceptable" means a non-toxic material that does not interfere with<br>
the effectiveness of the hiological activity of the active ingredients. Such preparations may<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-43-<br>
routinely contain salts, buffering agents, preservatives, compatible carriers, and optionally<br>
other therapeutic agents, such as supplementary immune potentiating agents including<br>
adjuvants, chemokines and oytokines. When used in medicine, the salts should be<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable, but non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts may conveniently be<br>
used to prepare pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof and are not excluded from the<br>
scope of the invention.<br>
A salt retains the desired biological activity of the parent compound and does not<br>
impart any undesired toxicological effects (see e.g., Berge, S.M., et al. (1977) J. Pharm. Sci.<br>
66:1-19). Examples of such salts include acid addition salts and base addition salts. Acid<br>
addition salts include those derived from nontoxic inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric,<br>
nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, phosphorous and the like, as well as<br>
from nontoxic organic acids such as aliphatic mono- and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl<br>
substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic<br>
sulfonic acids and the like. Base addition salts include those derived from alkaline earth<br>
metals, such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and the like, as well as from<br>
nontoxic organic amines, such as N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine,<br>
chioroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, procaine and the like.<br>
An ADC can be combined, if desired, with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier" as used herein means one or more compatible<br>
solid or liquid fillers, diluents or encapsulating substances which are suitable for<br>
administration into a human. The term "carrier" denotes an organic or inorganic ingredient,<br>
natural or synthetic, with which the active ingredient is combined to facilitate the application.<br>
The components of the pharmaceutical compositions also are capable of being co-mingled in<br>
a manner such that there is no interaction which would substantially impair the desired<br>
pharmaceutical efficacy.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may contain suitable buffering agents, including:<br>
acetic acid in a salt; citric acid in a salt; boric acid in a salt; and phosphoric acid in a salt.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions also may contain, optionally, suitable preservatives,<br>
such as: benzalkonium chloride; chlorobutanol; parabens and thimerosal.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form<br>
and may be prepared by any of the methods well-known in the art of pharmacy. All methods<br>
include the step of bringing the active agent into association with a carrier which constitutes<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-44-<br>
one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly<br>
and intimately bringing the active compound into association with a liquid carrier, a finely<br>
divided solid carrier, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.<br>
Compositions suitable for parenteral administration conveniently comprise a sterile<br>
aqueous or non-aqueous preparation of the compounds, which is, in some embodiments,<br>
isotonic with the blood of the recipient. This preparation may be formulated according to<br>
known methods using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The<br>
sterile injectable preparation also may be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-<br>
toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butane diol.<br>
Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's<br>
solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are<br>
conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland<br>
fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono-or di-glycerides. In addition, fatty acids<br>
such as oleic acid may be used in the preparation of injectables. Carrier formulations suitable<br>
for oral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, etc. administration can be found in<br>
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA.<br>
The active compounds can be prepared with carriers that will protect the compound<br>
against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants,<br>
transdermal patches, and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible<br>
polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid,<br>
collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Many methods for the preparation of such<br>
formulations are patented or generally known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Sustained<br>
and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems, J.R. Robinson, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc.,<br>
New York, 1978.<br>
The therapeutics of the invention can be administered by any conventional route,<br>
including injection or by gradual infusion over time. The administration may, for example,<br>
be oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intracavity, intratumor, or transdermal.<br>
When compounds containing antibodies are used therapeutically, routes of administration<br>
include intravenous and by pulmonary aerosol. Techniques for preparing aerosol delivery<br>
systems containing antibodies are well known to those of skill in the art. Generally, such<br>
systems should utilize components which will not significantly impair the biological<br>
properties of the antibodies, such as the paratope binding capacity (see, for example, Sciarra<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-45-<br>
and Cutie, "Aerosols," in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th edition, 1990, pp.<br>
1694-1712; incorporated by reference). Those of skill in the art can readily determine the<br>
various parameters and conditions for producing antibody aerosols without resorting to undue<br>
experimentation.<br>
The compositions of the invention are administered in effective amounts. An<br>
"effective amount" is that amount of any of the ADCs provided herein that alone, or together<br>
with further doses and/or other therapeutic agents, produces the desired response, e.g., treats a<br>
PSMA-mediated disease in a subject This can involve only slowing the progression of the<br>
disease temporarily, although in some embodiments, it involves halting the progression of the<br>
disease permanently. This can be monitored by routine methods. The desired response to<br>
treatment of the disease or condition also can be delaying the onset or even preventing the<br>
onset of the disease or condition. An amount that is effective can be the amount of an ADC<br>
alone which produces the desired therapeutic endpoint. An amount that is effective is also<br>
the amount of an ADC in combination with another agent that produces the desired result.<br>
Such amounts will depend, of course, on the particular PSMA-mediated disease being<br>
treated, the severity of the condition, the individual patient parameters including age, physical<br>
condition, size and weight, the duration of the treatment, the nature of concurrent therapy (if<br>
any), the specific route of administration and like factors within the knowledge and expertise<br>
of the health practitioner. These factors are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art<br>
and can be addressed with no more than routine experimentation. It is generally preferred<br>
that a maximum dose of the individual components or combinations thereof be used, that is,<br>
the highest safe dose according to sound medical judgment. It will be understood by those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art, however, that a patient may insist upon a lower dose or tolerable dose<br>
for medical reasons, psychological reasons or for virtually any other reasons.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions used in the foregoing methods preferably are sterile<br>
and contain an effective amount of an ADC, alone or in combination with another agent, for<br>
producing the desired response in a unit of weight or volume suitable for administration to a<br>
patient. The response can, for example, be measured by determining the physiological effects<br>
of the ADC composition, such as regression of a tumor or decrease of disease symptoms.<br>
Other assays will be known to one of ordinary skill in the art and can be employed for<br>
measuring the level of the response.<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
- 46 -<br>
The doses of ADCs administered to a subject can be chosen in accordance with<br>
different parameters, in particular in accordance with the mode of administration used and the<br>
state of the subject. Other factors include the desired period of treatment. In the event that a<br>
response in a subject is insufficient at the initial doses applied, higher doses (or effectively<br>
higher doses by a different, more localized delivery route) may be employed to the extent that<br>
patient tolerance permits.<br>
In general, doses can range from about 10 μg/kg to about 100,000 μg/kg. In some<br>
embodiments, the doses can range from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg. In still other<br>
embodiments, the doses range from about 0.1 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg or<br>
0.1 mg/kg to 15 mg/kg. In yet other embodiments, the doses range from about 1 mg/kg to 5<br>
mg/kg, 5 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg to 15 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg. In further<br>
embodiments, the dose is about 0.1 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg,<br>
7 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 12 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg, 17 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg. In<br>
another embodiment, the dose is about 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg. Based upon<br>
the composition, the dose can be delivered continuously, such as by continuous pump, or at<br>
periodic intervals. In some embodiments, when the ADC is administered intravenously, the<br>
dose is between 0.1 and 20 mg/kg or any value in between. Desired time intervals of<br>
multiple doses of a particular composition can be determined without undue experimentation<br>
by one skilled in the art. Other protocols for the administration of the compositions provided<br>
will be known to one of ordinary skill in the art, in which the dose amount, schedule of<br>
administration, sites of administration, mode of administration and the like vary from the<br>
foregoing. In some embodiments, subjects are administered the ADC with a dose regimen of<br>
q4d x 3 or q4d x 6. In one embodiment, the dose is administered intravenously. In another<br>
embodiment, the dose regimen is a single intravenous dose.<br>
Administration of ADC compositions to mammals other than humans, e.g. for testing<br>
purposes or veterinary therapeutic purposes, is carried out under substantially the same<br>
conditions as described above.<br>
The compositions of the present invention have in vitro and in vivo diagnostic and<br>
therapeutic utilities. For example, these molecules can be administered to cells in culture,<br>
e.g. in vitro or ex vivo, or in a subject, e.g., in vivo, to treat, prevent or diagnose a variety of<br>
PSMA-mediated diseases. As used herein, the term "subject" is intended to include humans<br>
and non-human animals. Subjects include a human patient having a disorder characterized by<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-47-<br>
expression, typically aberrant expression (e.g., overexpression) of PSMA, such disorders are<br>
included in the definition of "PSMA-mediated disease".<br>
The compositions provided herein can be utilized in in vivo therapy of cancer. The<br>
ADCs can be used to inhibit proliferation of the malignant cells or tissues following<br>
administration and localization of the conjugates. The compositions provided can include<br>
anti-PSMA antibodies, in some embodiments, that may mediate tumor destruction by<br>
complement fixation or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Alternatively, the<br>
compositions can contain an additional therapeutic agent to result in synergistic therapeutic<br>
effects (Baslya and Mendelsohn, 1994 Breast Cancer Res. and Treatment 29:127-138).<br>
The compositions of the invention can also be administered together with, in some<br>
embodiments, complement and/or unconjugated anti-PSMA antibodies. Accordingly, within<br>
the scope of the invention are compositions comprising ADC and serum or complement.<br>
These compositions are advantageous in that the complement is located in close proximity to<br>
the human antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof. Alternatively, the ADCs,<br>
antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof and/or complement or serum can be<br>
administered separately.<br>
Use of the therapy of the present invention has a number of benefits. Since the ADCs<br>
preferentially target PSMA e.g., on prostate cancer cells, other tissue can be spared. As a<br>
result, treatment with such biological agents is safer, particularly for elderly patients.<br>
Treatment according to the present invention is expected to be particularly effective, in some<br>
embodiments, because it can direct high levels of ADCs to the bone marrow and lymph nodes<br>
where cancer metastases, such as prostate cancer metastases, can predominate. Treatment in<br>
accordance with the present invention can be effectively monitored with clinical parameters<br>
such as serum prostate specific antigen and/or pathological features of a patient's cancer,<br>
including stage, Gleason score, extracapsular, seminal, vesicle or perineural invasion,<br>
positive margins, involved lymph nodes, etc. Alternatively, these parameters can be used to<br>
indicate when such treatment should be employed.<br>
Also within the scope of the invention are kits comprising the compositions, e.g., one<br>
or more ADCs, of the invention and instructions for use. The kits can further contain at least<br>
one additional reagent, such as complement, a chemotherapeutic agent, a corticosteroid, or<br>
one or more antibodies that bind PSMA. Other kits can also include PSMA multimers. In<br>
another embodiment, a kit can comprise a carrier being compartmentalized to receive in close<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-48-<br>
confinement therein one or more container means or series of container means such as test<br>
tubes, vials, flasks, bottles, syringes, or the like. A first of said container means or series of<br>
container means may contain one or more antt-PSMA antibodies or antigen-binding<br>
fragments thereof. A second container means or series of container means can, in some<br>
embodiments, contain MMAE or MMAF or the compound of Formula 1 conjugated to<br>
MMAE or MMAF. In some embodiments, a third container means or series of container<br>
means contain a compound of Formula 1. Kits for use in in vivo tumor localization and<br>
therapy method containing the ADCs can be prepared. The components of the kits can be<br>
packaged either in aqueous medium or in lyophilized form. The components of the ADC<br>
conjugates can be supplied either in fully conjugated form, in the form of intermediates or as<br>
separate moieties to be conjugated by the user of the kit.<br>
As used herein with respect to polypeptides, proteins or fragments thereof, "isolated"<br>
means separated from its native environment and present in sufficient quantity to permit its<br>
identification or use. Isolated, when referring to a protein or polypeptide, means, for<br>
example: (i) selectively produced by expression cloning or (ii) purified as by<br>
chromatography or electrophoresis. Isolated proteins or polypeptides may be, but need not<br>
be, substantially pure. The term "substantially pure" means that the proteins or polypeptides<br>
are essentially free of other substances with which they may be found in nature or in vivo<br>
systems to an extent practical and appropriate for their intended use. Substantially pure<br>
polypeptides may be produced by techniques well known in the art. Because an isolated<br>
protein may be admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in a pharmaceutical<br>
preparation, the protein may comprise only a small percentage by weight of the preparation.<br>
The protein is nonetheless isolated in that it has been separated from the substances with<br>
which it may be associated in living systems, i.e. isolated from other proteins.<br>
The compositions provided herein can be in lyophilized form or provided in an<br>
aqueous medium.<br>

way should be construed as further limiting. The entire contents of all of the references<br>

LNCaP™ (CRL-1740), PC-3™ (CRL-1435), and 3T3™ (CRL-2752) were obtained<br>
from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). C4-2 cell line, a sub-cell line from<br>
LNCaP™, was obtained from The Cleveland Clinic Foundation (Cleveland, OH). A 3T3™-<br>
PSMA cell line was obtained from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (New York,<br>
NY). LNCaP™, C4-2 and PC-3™ were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies,<br>
Gaithersburg, MD), and 3T3™ and 3T3™-PSMA were cultured in DMEM (Life<br>
Technologies). Culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone,<br>
Logan, UT), L-glutamine, penicillin and streptomycin (Life Technologies). C4-2, LNCaP™<br>
and 3T3™-PSMA cells were determined to express PSMA at levels of approximately 2 x 105,<br>
6 x 105 and &gt;1 x 106 copies/cell, respectively, according to published methods (Ma D, et al.,<br>
Leukemia 2002;16:60-6.). C4-2 is an androgen-independent subclone of androgen-dependent<br>
LNCaP™ cells. PC-3™ is a de-differentiated prostate cancer cell line that does not express<br>
PSMA. PSMA mAbs (AB-PG1-XG1-006 (PTA-4403 and PTA-4404) and Abgenix 4.40.2<br>
(PTA-4360)) were produced as described previously in U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 10/395,894 and<br>
Schulke N et al., PNAS USA, 2003; 100:12590-5, each of which is herein incorporated by<br>
reference in its entirety. Abgenix 4.40.2 was used as a control. A fully human PSMA mAb<br>
(IgGl,K) was raised in mice transgenic for the human immunoglobulin gene locus<br>
(XenoMice™, Abgenix, Inc., Fremont, CA) following immunization with recombinant<br>
soluble PSMA and LNCaP cells as previously described (Schulke N et al., PNAS USA, 2003;<br>

-50-<br>
mAbs were modified with bifunctional chelates of cyclohexyl-diethylenetriamine<br>
pentaaoetic acid (CHX-DTPA) obtained from the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD),<br>
and labeled with lnIn (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA) as previously described (Ma D, et al.,<br>
Leukemia 2002;16:60-6; Nikula TK, et al., JNucl.Med 1999;40:166-76). 111In-labeled mAb<br>
was determined to be &gt;90% immunoreactive by incubating the radioconjugate with an excess<br>
of 3T3™-PSMA cells and measuring the bound fraction according to published methods (Ma<br>
D, et al., Leukemia 2002;16:60-6; Nikula TK, et al., JNucl.Med 1999;40:166-76). For<br>
internalization analysis, 111In-labeled mAb was incubated with 2 x 105 C4-2 cells at 37°C in<br>
5% CO2. At sequential time points, unbound mAb was removed by washing in PBS and cell-<br>
surface mAb was eluted using low pH buffer (pH 2.4, glycine/NaCl). The low pH eluate was<br>
counted separately from the cell pellet, and percent internalization was calculated as<br>
previously described (McDevitt MR, et al., Cancer Res 2000;60:6095-100).<br>
Preparation of Antibody-Drug Conjugates<br>
The synthesis and design of the linkers and the conjugation of the linker to the<br>
cytotoxic drug were carried out as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,884,889 and U.S. Pat. No.<br>
6,214,345, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. The conjugation<br>
of mAbs with maleimidocaproyl (mc)-valine (Val)-citrulline (Cit)-monomethyl auristatin E<br>
(MMAE) was performed as described (Doronina SO, et al., Nat. Biotechnology. 2003;21:778-<br>
84). PSMA mAb and isotype-control human IgG1 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) in PBS<br>
containing 50 mM borate, pH 8.0, were treated with dithiothreitol (DTT) (10 mM final) at<br>
37°C for 30 min. The final reaction concentrations were 7.5 mL - 8.0 ml, 1 mL 0.5 M sodium<br>
borate pH 8 and 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mL 100 mM DTT, and 0.5 mL or 0 ml, respectively, of PBS.<br>
This solution was incubated at 40°C for 1hr, and the antibody purified on a gel filtration<br>
column. The column was equilibrated with 10 mM DTP A in PBS at 10 mL/min, loaded with<br>
10.0 mL of the antibody reduction mixture, and eluted at 8 mL/min in PBS/DTPA buffer.<br>
The concentration of antibody-cysteine thiols produced was determined by titrating with 5,5'-<br>
dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL). An equivalent<br>
chemical can be obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO)..<br>
The fully reduced mAb Abgenix 4.40.2 (22.6 mL of 7.8 μM mAb, 75.6 uM cysteine<br>
thiol) was partially reoxidized with 35.43 μL of 10 mM DTNB, and the fully reduced mAb<br>
AB-PG1-XG1-006 (25.1 mL of 11.2 μM mAb, 95.8 μM cysteine thiol) was partially<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-51-<br>
reoxidized with 56,27 μL of 10 mM DTNB. The color of the solution immediately turned<br>
yellow.<br>
The drug mc-Val-Cit-paraaminobenzyl carbamate-MMAE (vcMMAE) was then<br>
conjugated to the partially reoxidized mAbs as follows: the mAbs were first cooled to 0°C.<br>
vcMMAE (5 molar equivalents per antibody: 89.7 and 140.6 uL, respectively, of a 10 mM<br>
stock solution of vcMMAE) was dissolved in 5 mL acetonitrile, then added to the antibody<br>
solution while carefully vortexing. The reaction mixtures were incubated on ice. No<br>
additional color change was observed. The reaction mixtures were quenched with 20 molar<br>
equivalents of cysteine/drug. The conjugate was purified using a gel-filtration column at 4°C<br>
and eluted with PBS at 8.0 mL/min. The ADCs were determined to have &gt; 98% monomeric<br>
mAb containing 3.0-3.5 drugs per mAb using published methods (Doronina SO, et al., Nat<br>
Biotechnol. 2003;21:778-84).<br>
Alternatively, the conjugation of mAbs with maleimidocaproyl (mc)-valine (Val)-<br>
citrulline (Cit)-monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) was performed as described (Doronina SO,<br>
et al., Nat. Biotechnology. 2003;21:778-84). PSMA mAb and isotype-control human IgGl<br>
(Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) in PBS containing 50 mM borate, pH 8.0, were treated with<br>
dithiothreitol (DTT) (10 mM final) at 37°C for 30 min. The mAbs were exchanged into PBS<br>
containing 1 mM DTPA (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI) by passage through a Sephadex G-25<br>
column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The mAb solutions were chilled to 4°C<br>
and combined with the maleimido drug derivative in cold CH3CN. After 1 hour, the<br>
reactions were quenched with excess cysteine, and the conjugates were concentrated and<br>
exchanged into PBS buffer. The ADCs were determined to have &gt; 98% monomeric mAb<br>
containing 3.0-3.5 drugs per mAb using published methods (Doronina SO, et al., Nat<br>
Biotechnol. 2003;21:778-84).<br>
Reactivity of ADCs with Cell-Surface PSMA<br>
Binding of PSMA mAb and ADC to 3T3™-PSMA and parental 3T3™ cells was<br>
analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytorneter (BD Bioscience, San Diego, CA). Briefly, 2 x<br>
105 3T3™-PSMA (or 3T3™) cells were incubated with different concentrations of mAb or<br>
ADC on ice for 1h. After washing, the presence of bound antibody was detected using goat<br><br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-52-<br>
anti-hnman IgG-FITC (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Isotype-control antibody and<br>
ADC were examined in parallel.<br>
In Vitro Cytotoxicity Assay<br>
PSMA-positive cells (C4-2, LNCaP™ or 3T3™-PSMA) and PSMA-negative cells<br>
(PC-3™ or 3T3™) were added to 96-well microplates (Falcon, BD Biosciences, San Jose,<br>
CA) at 2.5 x 103 cells/well and incubated overnight at 37°C and 5% CO2. Cells were then<br>
incubated with serially diluted ADCs for 4 days. The cell culture medium was replaced with<br>
fresh medium containing 10% Alamar Blue (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA), and<br>
cells were incubated for 4h. Plates were then read on a fluorescence plate reader using an<br>
excitation wavelength of 530 run and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. Cell survival was<br>
compared in treated and untreated cultures, and the concentration of ADC required for 50%<br>
cell kill (IC50 value) was determined.<br>
Xenograft Model of Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer<br>
All animal studies were carried out in accordance with Animal Care and Use<br>
Committee guidelines. Athymic male nude mice (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD)<br>
6-8 weeks in age were implanted with an intramuscular injection of 5 x 106 C4-2 cells mixed<br>
with 50% Matrigel (Beckon Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA) into the left hind-leg as<br>
described (McDevitt MR, et al., Cancer Res 2000;60:6095-100). Approximately 1 day prior<br>
to initiation of treatment, animals were randomized according to serum levels of prostate-<br>
specific antigen (PSA) as measured by ELISA (Medicorp, Montreal, Quebec, Canada).<br>
ADC, mAbs and vehicle control were administered via tail vein injection. In the first series<br>
of experiments, mice were treated in groups of 6 with 2 or 10 mg/kg PSMA ADC or with<br>
vehicle control. Treatment was initiated 17 days post-implantation and consisted of 3<br>
injections at 4-day intervals (q4d x 3). The second series of experiments examined dose<br>
levels of 0,3 or 6 mg/kg. Treatment was initiated 14 days post-implantation and consisted of<br>
6 injections at 4-day intervals (q4d x 6). Animals were monitored for their physical<br>
appearance, body weight, PSA level and tumor size. Survival rates were recorded throughout<br>
the studies.<br><br>

Statistical Analyses<br>
Treatment effects were examined for significance via t-tests (for PSA levels) or log-<br>
rank tests (for animal survival) using two-tailed, paired analyses. Data were considered<br>

Results<br>
Internalization of PSMA mAb into Human Prostate Cancer Cells<br>
Internalization was examined using 111In-labeled PSMA mAb and C4-2 cells. Total<br>
binding and percent internalization over time are illustrated in Fig. 1. Over half of the bound<br>
mAb was internalized within 2h (Fig. 1A). Total binding increased over time, presumably<br>
due to PSMA recycling (Fig. 1B). Thus, the PSMA mAb is readily internalized into PSMA-<br>
expressing cells.<br>
Reactivity of the PSMA ADC with PSMA-expressing Cells<br>
Flow cytometry was used to compare the binding of PSMA mAb and ADC. The<br>
unmodified mAb and ADC demonstrated comparable levels of binding to 3T3™-PSMA over<br>
a broad range of dilutions (Fig. 2). Neither the maximal amount of binding nor the<br>
concentration required for half-maximal binding was appreciably affected by conjugation.<br>
No significant binding was observed for the isotype-control ADC or antibody on 3T3™-<br>
PSMA cells or for PSMA mAb or ADC on parental 3T3™ cells.<br>
In vitro Potency and Selectivity of the PSMA ADC<br>
PSMA and control ADCs were tested for cytotoxicity in vitro against human prostate<br>
cancer cells lines and 3T3™-PSMA cells. Fig. 3 illustrates dose-response curves for PSMA-<br>
positive C4-2 cells and PSMA-negative PC-3™ cells in a representative experiment, and IC50<br>
values for the various cell lines are listed in Table 2. The PSMA ADC potently eliminated<br>
all PSMA-positive cell lines examined at IC50 values of 65-210 pM, whereas these<br>
concentrations had no effect on PSMA-negative cells. In contrast, nearly 1000-fold higher<br>
concentrations were required for the control ADC, whose activity was independent of PSMA<br>
expression (Fig. 3 and Table 2).<br><br>

Efficacy of the PSMA ADC in a Xenograft Model of Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer<br>
In vivo efficacy of the PSMA ADC was evaluated in a mouse model of androgen-<br>
independent human prostate cancer. Nude mice were engrafted with C4-2 cells<br>
intramuscularly in the left hind-leg. Approximately 14-17 days later, serum PSA levels were<br>
measured and used to randomly assign animals to treatment groups. Animals were treated<br>
intravenously with the PSMA ADC, and animals were monitored for tumor burden, PSA<br>
levels and other parameters for as long as 500 days.<br>
In the first experiment, animals were treated q4d x 3 with 0,2 or 10 mg/kg PSMA<br>
ADC. Left untreated, tumors grew rapidly and animals had a median survival of 32 days. In<br>
contrast, the groups treated with 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg PSMA ADC had median survivals of<br>
58 days (P = 0.0035) and 94.5 days (P = 0.0012), respectively (Table 3, Fig. 4A). The<br>
PSMA ADC treatment significantly improved median survival up to 4.5-fold in a dose-<br>
dependent fashion. There was no evidence of treatment-related toxicity.<br>
Serum PSA levels were measured over time by ELISA. Fig. 4B depicts the mean<br>
PSA concentration in each group at study days 17, 23 and 30. Treatment at 10 mg/kg<br>
reduced PSA levels &gt;10-fold from 8.8 ±11.7 ng/mL at day 17 to 0.7 ± 0.9 ng/mL at day 30,<br>
whereas PSA levels in the control group increased &gt;60-fold over the same time period. An<br>
intermediate response was observed at 2 mg/kg PSMA ADC. The differences in PSA levels<br>
at day 30 were significant for both the 2 mg/kg (P = 0.0048) and 10 mg/kg (P = 0.0006) dose<br>
groups. Three of six animals in the 10 mg/kg group had undetectable PSA through day 52 of<br>
the study.<br>
To extend these findings, a second PSMA ADC study was conducted that also<br>
included unmodified mAb and isotype-control ADC. After randomization at day 14 with a<br>
mean PSA level of 2.0 ± 1.1 ng/mL in each group (n = 5), animals were treated with a<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-55-<br>
regimen of q4d x 6. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for each group are depicted in Fig. 5.<br>
Animus treated with vehicle control, 6 mg/kg unmodified PSMA mAb and 6 mg/kg control<br>
ADC had similar median survival times of 29, 31 and 31 days, respectively; and these<br>
differences were not significant. However, median survival was extended to 49 days and 148<br>
days for animals treated with 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg PSMA ADC, respectively (Table 3).<br>
Treatment of the PSMA ADC group with 6 mg/kg improved post-randomization survival 7.9-<br>
fold relative to the control ADC group (P = 0.0018). At day 500,2 of 5 animals had no<br>
evidence of tumor, no measurable PSA and were considered to be cured by treatment. As in<br>
the first study, treatment had a significant impact on PSA levels on day 29 (P = 0.0068 for 6<br>
mg/kg PSMA and vehicle groups). Moreover, in the 6 mg/kg PSMA ADC group, serum PSA<br>
decreased to undetectable levels post-treatment and remained undetectable through day 63 in<br>
4 of 5 animals. There was no overt toxicity associated with ADC therapy. Physical<br>
appearance and activity were unaffected by treatment, and body weights of treated and<br>
vehicle-control animals were not significantly different at any time point.<br>

Example 2: Evaluation of PSMA mAb Conjugated to Three Different Drug-linkers<br>
The PSMA mAb when conjugated to vcMMAE and two other drug-linkers, vcMMAF<br>
and mcMMAF, was evaluated. The full chemical structuresof three different drug-linkers<br>
are illustrated in Fig. 6.<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-56-<br>
Preparation of Three Drug-linker Conjugates of PSMA mAb<br>
The three drug-linkers were djrectly conjugated to PSMA mAb via a thioether bond to<br>
prepare approximately four drugs per antibody conjugates. Partial reduction of the mAb<br>
interchain disulfides proceeded with a slight excess of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP)<br>
at pH 7.2 and 37°C and subsequent conjugation of the free thiols with drug-linkers was<br>
quantitative. Briefly, the PSMA mAb (10 mg, 67.5 nmol in PBS) was incubated at 37°C with<br>
1 mM DTP A and 169 nmol of TCEP for 90 min. At three time points during the incubation<br>
(30, 60 and 90 minutes), aliquots of 50 u.g mAb were removed and reacted with an excess of<br>
vcMMAE. Analysis of the resulting ADCs by hydrophobic interaction chromatography<br>
allowed the progress of the reduction to be followed. The results indicated that the mAb was<br>
rapidly reduced under the above conditions, being essentially complete after 1 hour.<br>
Furthermore, the extent of reduction resulted in an average drug loading of 5 drugs/mAb.<br>
To prepare a 4-loaded ADC with drug-linkers from the above partially reduced mAb,<br>
0.5 equivalents of DTNB were added to re-oxidize the mAb population back to the desired<br>
level. Then, 3 mg of this material (20.3 nmol) was reacted with 101 nmol of vcMMAE,<br>
vcMMAF or mcMMAF in a 15% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) reaction solution. This<br>
reaction proceeded for 1 hour at 0°C and was then quenched with a 20-fold excess of N-<br>
acetyl cysteine. The ADCs were separated from unreacted drug and other small molecule<br>
impurities by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a PD-10 column (Amersham<br>
Biosciences/GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) and concentrated with a centrifugal<br>
concentration device (30 kD MWCO) (Amicon Bioseparations, Millipore Corporation,<br>
Bedford, MA).<br>
A summary of the characterization of three drug-linker conjugates is provided in<br>
Tables 4-6 for vcMMAE, vcMMAF and mcMMAF, respectively. For each of the three<br>
drug-linkers, ADC contains approximately 4 drugs per mAb, as determined by H/L-chain<br>
loading distribution and species distribution, and 
phase (RP) HPLC. For all conjugates, no aggregates were detected by SEC-HPLC. In<br>
addition, the overall mAb yields were 70-80%.<br><br><br><br>

Potency and Selectivity of PSMA mAb Conjugates on Human Prostate Cancer Cells<br>
In vitro cytotoxicity studies were conducted with PSMA-positive and PSMA-<br>
negative cell lines. Briefly, PSMA-positive cells (C4-2, LNCaP™ or 3T3™-PSMA) and<br>
PSMA-negative cells (PC-3™ or 3T3™) were added to 96-well microplates at 2.5 x 103<br>
cells/well and incubated overnight at 37°C and 5% CO2. Cells were then incubated with<br>
serially diluted ADCs for 4 days and assayed for percent cell kill compared to untreated<br>
controls using 10% Alamar Blue. The concentration of ADCs required for 50% cell kill (IC50<br>
value) was determined.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates dose-response curves of vcMMAE (Fig. 7A), vcMMAF (Fig. 7B)<br>
and mcMMAF (Fig. 7C) conjugates for PSMA-positive C4-2 cells and PSMA-negative PC-<br>
3™ cells in a representative experiment. A summary of the potency (IC50) and selectivity on<br>
C4-2 and PC-3™ cell lines is listed in Table 7. The IC50s on PSMA-expressing C4-2 cells<br>
were at picomolar concentrations of 11, 42, and 60 for vcMMAF, mcMMAF and vcMMAE<br>
conjugates, respectively. In contrast, the IC50S on PC-3™ PSMA-negative cells were greater<br><br>
WO 2007/002222	PCT/US2006/024182<br>
-59-<br>
than 90 nM ranging from 94 to 264 nM. Based on the potency of each conjugate on PC-3™<br>
and C4-2, the selectivity was calculated to be 13,636; 6,286 and 1,567 for vcMMAF,<br>
mcMMAF and vcMMAE conjugates, respectively. The vcMMAF conjugate was the most<br>
potent on the C4-2 PSMA positive cell line, and the mcMMAF was the least toxic over the<br>
PC-3™ control cell line. Compared to the vcMMAE conjugate, there was a 4-fold and 9-fold<br>
improvement in selectivity for mcMMAF and vcMMAF conjugates, respectively.<br>

Mechanism of Cell Killing by the PSMA mAb Drug Conjugate<br>
Cell-cycle analysis was performed to determine the mechanism of cytotoxicity<br>
mediated by MMAE-conjugated mAb. 3T3™-PSMA or C4-2 cells were cultured in the<br>
presence of 0.2 nM PSMA ADC or 20 nM unmodified PSMA mAb. Untreated cells served<br>
as a control culture. At 12h, 24h and 48h, cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI) to<br>
detect total DNA and analyzed by flow cytometry. As indicated in Fig. 8, cells treated with<br>
PSMA ADC were arrested in G2 phase. By 48h post-treatment, the percent of cells with a<br>
duplicate set of chromosomes was &gt;50% for the PSMA ADC cultures and 2% for untreated<br>
cultures. Cell-cycle arrest required the presence of the toxin, in this case MMAE, as only 3%<br>
of cells treated with unmodified mAb were in G2/M phase at 48h. The data demonstrate that<br>
treatment of prostate cancer cells with MMAE ADCs lead to G2/M arrest and then apoptosis<br>
of target cells.<br>
