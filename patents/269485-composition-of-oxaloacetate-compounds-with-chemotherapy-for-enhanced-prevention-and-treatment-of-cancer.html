				<td>METHOD FOR EXTENDING LIFESPAN AND DELAYING THE ONSET OF AGE-RELATED DISEASE<br>
Background of the Invention Meld of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention pertains to a method of extending life span in organisms and delays the onset and many of the complications associated with age-related diseases, including cancer. More particularly, the invention relates to the administration of a chemical agent to upregulate and downregulate the expression (i.e. gene activation) of the same beneficial genes that are activated in caloric restriction. The genes are activated by mimicking the same intracellular conditions as are seen in caloric restriction, but without the need to reduce caloric intake. Compositions and methods to prolong life and protect an organism from age-related diseases are likewise provided. Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002] Many attempts have been made to extend life span in single cell organisms and multi-cellular animals. These attempts have included various nutritionally-based interventions, vitamin supplements, antioxidant supplements, exercise, hormonal, pharmaceutical and other paradigms (Lane, M. et al. Nutritional Modulation of aging in nonhµMan primates, 1999 The Journal of Nutrition, Health &amp; Aging, Vol. 3, No. 2 pp 69-76). While these attempts sometimes result in better health, in the last 70 years, only activation of beneficial genes has caused an increase in lifespan. Three methods of beneficial gene activation have been proven to extend mean and maximal lifespan: 1) gene activation by calorie restriction (CR); 2) certain types of animals receiving genetic engineering (the artificial addition or deletion of genes); and 3) the use of chemicals that activate the Sir2 gene by lowering the Michaelis constants, Km, of the Sir-2 enzymes for the co-substrate NAD+[24]. CR is the limitation of total calories derived from carbohydrates, fats, or proteins to a level 25% to 60% below that of control animals fed ad libitµM (Koubova et al, How does calorie restriction work? 2003 Genes &amp; Development. Vol. 17 pp 212-221). Success in extending lifespan with gene activation by CR includes a wide range of different organisms including yeast, rotifers, guppies, spiders, fruit flies, hamsters, rats, mice and it is now indicated at extending lifespan in primates (Lane et al.; Koubova et al.; Lane et al, Short-term calorie restriction improves disease-related markers in older male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) 1999 Mechanisms of Ageing and Development Vol. 112 pp 185-196). Success<br><br>
in extending lifespan with genetic engineering has been successful in yeast, worms, fruit flies and mice (Hekimi, S. et al, Genetics and the Specificity of the Aging Process, Science. 2003 Feb 28;299(5611): 1351-4, Review; Guarente, L. SIR2 and aging- the exception that proves the rule, Trends Genet. 2001 Jul;17(7):391-2; TissenbaµM, H et al. Increased dosage of a sir-2 gene extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans, 2001 Nature Vol 410 pp 227-230; Lin, S et al, Requirement of NAD and SIR2 for Life-Span Extension by Calorie Restriction in Saccharomyces cerevisiae 2000 Science Vol. 289 pp 294-297; Lin, S et al, Calorie restriction extends Saccharomyces cerevisiae lifespan by increasing respiration 2002 Nature, Vol. 110 pp 244-248; Guarente, L. Mutant mice live longer, 1999 Nature Vol. 402 pp 243-245). Success in extending lifespan with chemicals that lower the Michaelis constant of the Sir-2 enzymes for NAD has been shown in yeast and worms (Howitz et al., Small molecule activators of sirtuins extend Saccharomyces cerevisiae lifespan, Nature 425: 191-196; Wood et al., Sirtuin activators mimic caloric restriction and delay ageing in metazoans, Nature, VolµMe 430, 5 August 2004. In all cases, expansion of lifespan required the activation of beneficial genes.<br>
[0003] It is significant that CR works on such a wide range of organisms, from the single celled to very complex (including primates). The wide range of success of CR indicates that the process of life extension is based on the effects within the individual cells of the organisms, and that the process allowing life span extension is preserved across species. In rodents, the extension in life span can approach 50% (Koubova et al.). This lifespan comes at a price, however, as the organism needs to be fed at least 25% less calories than it would normally consµMe.<br>
[0004] The benefits of CR are nµMerous, hi addition to lifespan extension, the onsets of aging-related diseases are also delayed, leading to a healthier organism for a longer time, hi mammals, CR delays all kidney disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. CR reduces age associated neuron loss in mouse models of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease (Koubova et al.). It is also noted that even moderate CR lowers cancer risk in mammals (Mai, V. liven Moderate Caloric Restriction Lowers Cancer Risk in Mice, Experimental Biology Conference 2002 April 23 meeting). Additionally, CR mammals have been observed to have less body fat (Picard. et al., Sirtl promotes fat mobilization in white adipocytes by repressing ppar gama, Nature, Vol. 429, 17 June 2004. ). CR has been shown to enhance the repair of DNA in skin and other tissues after exposure to ultraviolet light (Lipman et al, "The influence of dietary<br>
restriction on DNA repair in rodents: a preliminary study", Mech Ageing Dev 1989: 48: 135-43; Weraarchakul et al, "The effect of aging and dietary restriction on DNA repair", Exp Cell Res 1989; 181:197-204; Licastro et al, "Effect of dietary restriction upon the age-associated decline of lymphocyte DNA repair activity in mice", Age 1988: 11: 48-52; Srivastava et al, "Decreased fidelity of DNA polymerases and decreased DNA excision repair in aging mice: Effects of caloric restriction", Biochem Biophys Res Commun 1992: 182: 712-21; Tilley et al, "Enhanced unscheduled DNA synthesis by secondary cultures of lung cells established from calorically restricted aged rats", Mech Ageing Dev 1992: 63" 165-76). DNA repair is critical for skin repair and to prevent skin aging. It also reduces skin cancer incidence. Studies of hµMans undergoing CR for 3 to 15 years have shown reduced risk for atherosclerosis along with reductions in fasting glucose, fasting insulin, Hs-CRP levels, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol as compared to equivalent age-matched controls (Fontana, et al, "Long-term calorie restriction is highly effective in reducing the risk for atherosclerosis in hµMans, PNAS, April 27, 2004, Vol.101, no. 17, pp 6659-6663).<br>
[0005] The benefits of CR are not due to dietary antioxidants, as single agents or combinations of antioxidants do not produce an increase in lifespan or delay tµMorigenesis and other age related disease. Instead, CR works due to signaling changes that activate gene expression that reduce cellular proliferation or increase apoptosis. Multiple genes involved in the electron transport chain, immune response, protein turnover and protein synthesis are changed in CR (Lee, et al., The impact of a-Lipoic Acid, Coenzyme Q10, and Caloric Restriction on Life Span and Gene Expression Patterns in Mice, Free Radical Biology &amp; Medicine, Vol. 36, No. 8, pp. 1043-1057, 2004). Masternak et al shows that genes related to insulin and insulin growth factor 1 (IGF1) are altered including PPARa, a gene suggested to play an important role in metabolic control and the accµMulation and preservation of fat storage cells. (Masternak, et. al., Divergent Effects of Caloric Restriction on Gene Expression in Normal and Long-Lived Mice, Journal of Genontology, 2004, Vol. 59A, No. 8, 784-788). The activity of FOXO genes have also been shown to change under caloric restriction (Daitoku, et al., Silent information regulator 2 potentates Foxol-mediated transcription through its deacetylase activity, PNAS, July 6, 2004).<br>
[0006] Within the last decade, it has been determined that the Silenced Information Regulator 2 (Sir2) gene in yeast and worms (Sir2.1 in worms, SIRT1 in hµMans) is also one of the genes that regulates lifespan and is activated in CR. Mutant worms and yeast with extra<br>
copies of Sir2 or Sir2.1 live longer, while mutations in the Sir2 gene severely reduce lifespan. See, e.g. TissenbaµM et al.. Other animals contain similar genes or homologues to the Sir2 gene, including hµMans (the SIRT1 gene). CR creates a set of conditions in the cell that signals the activation of beneficial genes to lengthen lifespan and delay the onset of age-related disease. The activation of Sir2 by CR is one pathway to increased lifespan. CR also stimulates other genes that increase lifespan independent of Sir2 in a parallel pathway. Kaeberlein et al, "Sir2 -Independent Life Span Extension by Calorie Restriction in Yeast" 2004, PloS Biology: 2: 9: e296: 1381-1387<br>
[0007] It has been shown that activation of Sir2 can activate or silence other genes and proteins, including FOXO type genes. Also, the activation of the Sir2 gene (SIRT1 in hµMans) normally turned on in CR blunted the protein PPAR gamma that activated fat- storage genes, so that fat cells would shed fat and prevented cells from differentiating into fat cells. See, e.g. Picard et al. supra. This would explain the low amounts of fat seen in mammals under CR.<br>
[0008] Lin et al. determined that the internal cellular signaling condition generated by CR to activate beneficial genes is the increase in NAD+/NADH (oxidized and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) ratios within the cell as compared to non-CR conditions. Lin, S. et al, Calorie restriction extends yeast life span by lowering the level of NADH. 2004 Genes &amp; Development Vol. 18 pp 12-16. Lin also noted that NAD+ levels in cells remain constant between CR and non-CR conditions, while the reduced form of NAD+, NADH, is significantly lowered in CR (up to 50%), which allows activation of at least one beneficial gene, the Sir2 type gene. High levels of NADH are an inhibitor of the Sir2 gene.<br>
[0009] Lin's study showed at least one of the intracellular requirements for signaling the activation of beneficial genes resulting in increased longevity and health benefits found during CR. The study used recombinant genetic modifications to achieve the increase the ratio of NAD+/NADH, (without the restriction in calories) and thereby "mimic" caloric restriction results of increased lifespan and general improvement in health. The important characteristic shown was that calories did not have to be reduced, but rather that beneficial genes need to be activated within the individual cells in order to achieve the same benefits of CR.<br>
[0010] In other studies by Horitz, Wood and Lamming, researchers have discovered an alternate pathway for increasing life span that is distinct from CR and genetic engineering to increase the NAD+/NADH ratio to stimulate at least one beneficial gene. Instead of inserting<br>
genes to modify the NAD+/NADH ratio or to add additional copies of a beneficial gene by genetic engineering, they instead used chemical agents to lower the substrate-binding affinity between NAD+ and Sir2 allowing the Sir2 (SIRT1 in hµMans) to activate more readily. Howitz et al., Small molecule activators of sirtuins extend Saccharomyces cerevisiae lifespan, Nature 425: 191-196; Wood et al., Sirtuin activators mimic caloric restriction and delay ageing in metazoans, Nature, VolµMe 430, 5 August 2004; Lamming et al., Small molecules that regulate lifespan: evidence for xenohormesis, Molecular Microbiology, 2004, Vol. 53(4), 1003-1009. The chemical agents discovered are polyphenols and include the compound resveratrol. The polyphenols are found in plants, but are not part of the natural chemical makeup of mammals including hµMans. The polyphenols are very specific in the activation of the Sir2 gene and its homologues. The Sir2 gene extends lifespan, but does not activate all of the beneficial genes activated by CR. As a result of this, the Sir2 activating polyphenols produce a lower increase in lifespan extension than does CR. Kaeberlein et al, "Sir2-Independent Life Span Extension by Calorie Restriction in Yeast" 2004, PloS Biology: 2: 9: e296: 1381-1387.<br>
[0011] Changing the inter-cellular binding potential with chemical agents or using genetic engineering to increase lifespan, reduce fat accµMulation, and delay cancer and age related disease and improve overall health is a marvelous achievement. As a caution, however, genetic engineering is hardly a well-understood field, and is unlikely to help increase the lifespan of hµMans any time in the near future. Using chemical agents to lower the binding affinity of certain enzymes in order to stimulate Sir2 or Sirtl (in hµMans) is also an uncertain path, as there is no long-term determination of risks. Additionally, the Sir2 or Sirtl gene is only one of the genes that can be activated to increase lifespan, and produces a modest increase, whereas activation of more beneficial genes can result in longer increases in in lifespan. Finally, what if the application of the foreign chemicals such as Resveratrol cause harm in some isolated area of the hµMan body?<br>
[0012] The only long-term studies performed to extend lifespan, reduce body fat and delay cancer and other age-related conditions focused on actual caloric restriction. The studies, done since the 1930's, have shown the many benefits of caloric restriction, with the only noted potential disadvantages being that organisms took longer before they were of age to reproduce, and the organisms tended to be smaller than non-calorie restricted organisms.<br>
[0013] We have been taught that the intercellular conditions seen in CR to activate beneficial genes include an increase in the NAD+/NADH ratio, which acts as a switching mechanism for the cell. To lower overall risk, it would be better to stimulate the same set of beneficial genes seen in CR by using the identical signaling method for the genes involved with CR. It would be beneficial to activate other life-extending genes in addition to or besides the Sir2 gene. Moreover, it would be of great benefit to find chemical agents that increase the NAD+/NADH ratio. Chemical agents that increase NAD+/NADH could provide a proven safe pathway (70 years of research) for lifespan expansion and the delay in the onset of age-related diseases. It would also be beneficial if the activation agent to increase the NAD+/NADH ratio was a chemical that is already found in mammals including hµMans, rather than introducing foreign compounds with unknown long-term results.<br>
[0014] Due to the wide variety of chemical reactions available to the cell, each cell reacts in a manner to conserve the NAD+/NADH ratio. It is, in effect, a buffered response. It is especially difficult to increase the ratio. However, ethanol can decrease the NAD+/NADH ratio, which results in higher triglycerides and "fatty liver" disease.<br>
[0015] Finding a compound to increase the NAD+/NADH ratio to activate beneficial genes is not trivial. One reason for this is due to the difficulty in directly measuring the NAD+/NADH ratio with current technology. Instead of measuring NAD+/NADH directly, the ratio is inferred indirectly by the measurement of the pyruvate/ lactate ratio. Typically, when the amount of pyruvate to lactate increases, NAD+/NADH increases.<br>
[0016] Thus, one method of increasing the NAD+/NADH ratio in the cells would be to increase the amount of pyruvate into the cell. In gluconeogenesis, pyruvate can be converted to glucose and converts a NADH to NAD+, which will increase the NAD+/NADH ratio. Also, under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is converted to lactate by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. The conversion of pyruvate to lactate under anaerobic conditions again converts a NADH to NAD+. There are reports of an increase in the NAD+/NADH ratio with the injection of pyruvate into rats. Work done by Ido on the study of blood flow in the retina and visual cortex show that NADH levels in the cytosol can be dropped by 50%, doubling the NAD+/NADH ratio. Ido, et al, NADH augments blood flow in physiologically activated retina and visual cortex, PNAS, January 13, 2004, Vol. 101, no. 2 pp 653-658. Despite this reported temporary change in the ratio, no extension of lifespan occurs with pyruvate because pyruvate also penetrates the<br>
inner mitochondrial membrane and preferentially engages in lowering the NAD+/NADH ratio through the Citric Acid Cycle. The ratio, temporarily raised by pyruvate, is then lowered when the pyruvate is processed through the Citric Acid Cycle. The typical cell buffers against increases in the NAD+/NADH ratio.<br>
[0017] Anderson, et al. also had difficulty in using chemical agents to increase the NAD+/NADH ratio and activate beneficial genes. Anderson used acetaldehyde, known to reduce NADH in cells, but did not see any increase in the activity of beneficial genes. There is also some debate that changing the NAD+/NADH ratio will activate beneficial genes at all. Based on his work, Anderson teaches, "variations in NADH are unlikely to affect the activity of Sir2 or SIRT1" (beneficial genes) Anderson et al., Yeast Life-Span Extension by Calorie Restriction Is Independent of NAD Fluct..., Science 2003 302: 2124-2126.<br>
[0018] There is a current need to create intracellular conditions similar to CR (i.e. increase of the NAD+/NADH ratio) with a Caloric Restriction "mimic" chemical that would allow beneficial genes to be implemented. Thus, the benefits of increased lifespan, lower cancer rates, lower body fat content and the delay in age-related disease without the heavy restrictions of diet imposed by CR or by genetic modification of the individual organism can be realized. The preference would be to have the chemical agents be currently part of hµMan metabolism. The present invention provides such a chemical and method for the novel activation of beneficial genes.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
[0042] The present invention relates to compositions and methods for extending lifespan and treating disorders associated with aging in an individual in need thereof. The present invention is based, in part, on the surprising discovery that the administration of oxaloacetate and chemical precursors, including alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate, results in a dose dependent lifespan increase in average population life span of up to 36% and up to 40% increase in maximal life span over similar populations of multi-cell control organisms including simple animals such as the nematode C. elegans, the more complicated fly D. melanogaster and in complex mammals. Without being bound to a particular theory, it is believed that external cellular contact with an oxaloacetate compound or its precursors, and subsequent transfer of the oxaloacetate into the cell, leads to metabolic signaling changes that activate beneficial genes that increase the lifespan of organisms. As used herein, the term "oxaloacetate" includes oxaloacetate, its salts, and chemical precursors of oxaloacetate including, without limitation, alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate. The phrase "individual in need thereof refers to any multi-cellular organism that would benefit from the life-extending and/or anti-aging effects of<br>
oxaloacetate. An individual includes, without limitation, any vertebrate or invertebrate susceptible to oxaloacetate administration. Exemplary vertebrates include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals such as hµMans, primates, canines, felines, or other animals.<br>
[0043] The present invention is based, in part, on the observation that oxaloacetate introduced into a cell cannot cross the inner membrane of the mitochondria [23]. The additional oxaloacetate introduced into the cytosol is reduced to malate by the enzyme malate dehydrogenase. This reaction also converts NADH into NAD+, increasing the NAD+/NADH ratio. The malate formed by the introduction of additional oxaloacetate to the cytosol can cross the mitochondria membrane through an exchange for a-ketoglutarate. Once in the mitochondria, the malate can be converted back into oxaloacetate by way of the Citric Acid Cycle. Conversion of the malate back into oxaloacetate would generate NADH from NAD+, and lower the NAD+/NADH ratio, as occurs in pyruvate which prevents the increase in lifespan. The lowering of the NAD+/NADH ratio, however, does not occur with the addition of oxaloacetate in the cytosol, because the Gibbs Free Energy, delta G, is highly positive (+29.7) for the reaction of malate to oxaloacetate. Under normal conditions, the only reason the reaction of malate to oxaloacetate proceeds at all in the Citric Acid Cycle is due to the energy gained due to the conversion of oxaloacetate to acetyl CoA in the mitochondria (delta G of -32.2) and the energy of the other intermediates of the Citric Acid Cycle. Because the oxaloacetate added to the cytosol cannot penetrate the mitochondrial membrane, there is no additional oxaloacetate in the mitochondria to power the reaction of maiate to oxaloacetate in the Citric Acid Cycle. Thus, the ratio of NAD+/NADH stays high with the addition of oxaloacetate to the cytosol. In effect, an electron biological diode is created by the addition of oxaloacetate to the cytosol, the inability of oxaloacetate to penetrate the mitochondria, and the high delta G of the reaction of malate back into oxaloacetate in the mitochondria. Figure 1 illustrates the effect of oxaloacetate supplementation on increasing the ratio of NAD+/NADH. As indicated in Figure 1, the supplementation of extra-cellular oxaloacetate acts to penetrate the cell membrane but is precluded from penetrating the inner mitochondrial membrane. The maintained increase in the NAD+/NADH ratio is a signaling effect that starts the increase in the expression of beneficial genes and the increase in associated beneficial proteins along with the decrease in the expression of non-beneficial genes and the decrease in associate non-beneficial proteins. By keeping the NAD+/NADH ratio higher than would normally occur, oxaloacetate effectively mimics the<br>
effect of CR and facilitates the regulation of genes to produce beneficial repairs, reduce the incidence of cancer and other age-related disease, block fat production, reduce apoptosis, and increase the overall lifespan of an organism.<br>
[0044] The increase in NAD+/NADH ratio by oxaloacetate allows the activation of beneficial genes, which results in the same benefits as those seen in CR because the signaling mechanism is similar. The beneficial genes upregulated in CR include the following classes of genes: lipid catabolism and activation of the oxidative stress response; regulation of central metabolic pathways including SAM and urea cycles; regulation of hormonal pathways; DHEA and insulin/Igf signaling; genome instability and apoptosis. Reviews of these gene types can be found in works by Bauer (Bauer, et al, 'Starvation response in mouse liver shows strong correlation with lifespan prolonging processes", Physiologicaly Genomics, February 3, 2004, 10.1152/physiolgenomics. 00203.2003), Cao (Cao, et al, "Genomic profiling of short-and long-term caloric restriction effects in the liver of aging mice", Proc Natl Acad Sci 98: 10630-10635, 2001), and Lee (Lee, et al., The impact of a-Lipoic Acid, Coenzyme Q10, and Caloric Restriction on Life Span and Gene Expression Patterns in Mice, Free Radical Biology &amp; Medicine, Vol. 36, No. 8, pp. 1043-1057, 2004) hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. The inventor shows that mice subjected to calorie restriction results in the change of levels of gene expression in 1,763 genes in liver tissue as compared to a control group fed freely. Mice fed oxaloacetate but allowed to eat freely resulted in a change of expression in 765 genes. Because these are pooled results, many of the changes in gene expression are due to individual variations within the mice. However, when genes that are changed from the control group are commonly expressed by both the calorie restricted mice and the oxaloacetate administered mice, these genes can be considered as the driving reason for similarities in physical changes as compared to the control group fed freely that they are compared against. The physical changes docµMented include the decrease in body weight, an increase in health span and resistance to disease, and an increase in lifespan. 363 genes showed a common change from the control mice. Of these 363 genes, 357 show either an upregulation of the expression of the gene or a down regulation in the expression of the gene in the same direction away from the control group. It is apparent that these 357 genes expressed in similar fashion as compared to the control are responsible for the positive changes in lifespan (98% of all genes changed in common as compared to the control group). Homologues of these genes expressed in other animals will have a similar physical effect. Note<br>
that there may be other genes expressed in other tissues other than the liver that undoubtedly also assist in lifespan extension, however the liver is one of the key organs for the regulation of metabolism, that through calorie restriction has shown to be critical to increases in mammalian lifespan and health span..<br>
[0045]       The beneficial genes activated and non-beneficial genes down-regulated in the liver tissue are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<br><br>

 [0047] Table 1 shows a gene expression directional analysis indicating that 98% of the genes that changed expression from the control group and were commonly expressed also in the oxaloacetate supplemented group and Calorie Restricted group moved in the same direction (up regulated or down regulated). Table 1 further illustrates that both calorie restriction and the supplementation of oxaloacetate in the diet causes changes in gene expression as compared to the expression genes in a control group fed as much food as they desired (fed ad libitµM). It docµMents the 363 genes that change in common expression from the control group, and the directional analysis of the change in gene expression for oxaloacetate and calorie restricted mice as compared to the control group.<br>
[0048] Table 2 shows increases and decreases in gene expression of commonly expressed changed genes of 1.7 fold in either oxaloacetate supplemented mice or calorie restricted mice as compared to a control group. Table 2 demonstrates that genes expressed by either the calorie restricted group of mice or the oxaloacetate supplemented group of mice that resulted in a 1.7 or greater fold increase (or decrease) in expression as compared to the control group. Both average lifespan and maximal lifespan of the individual are substantially increased with the application of excess oxaloacetate to the organism. However, unlike CR, there is no need for reduction in caloric intake. It is interesting to note that in the liver no increase in the the Sirtl gene in the mice was observed, however this does not exclude the increase of Sirtl gene in other tissues. In our C. elegans experiments represented in Figure 3, Sir2 (and their homologues, such as Sirtl in hµMans) was shown to add approximately a 10% increase in lifespan over control animals. Other beneficial genes, turned on in CR, operate in a parallel but independent pathway to the Sir2 type genes are also activated by oxaloacetate and increase lifespan by greater amounts, as much as up to an additional 26%. Between the activation of the Sir2 type genes and the other beneficial genes, a total increase of up to 36% in lifespan over control animals has been shown to be obtainable.<br>
[0049] In one embodiment of the invention, a nutritional supplement comprising an effective dose of oxaloacetate is provided to extend the lifespan of an individual and to reduce the onset of age-related disease. Oxaloacetate acts to reduce NADH levels in the cytosol of the cell, which increases the NAD+/NADH ratio to levels seen during CR, but without a restriction in calories or genetic modification of the individual. External cellular contact with an oxaloacetate compound, and subsequent transfer of the oxaloacetate into the cell, leads to<br>
metabolic changes that increase the NAD/NADH ratio and activate beneficial genes. The oxaloacetate is converted to malate by interaction with cytosolic malate dehydrogenase. In this conversion, NADH is converted to NAD+, which increases the intercellular NAD+/NADH ratio. The present invention is based, in part, on the surprising and novel discovery that the increase in NAD+/NADH ratio signals the activation of the beneficial genes that then act upon the cell to increase lifespan and reduce the onset of age related disease.<br>
[0050] In another embodiment of the current invention, methods for extending lifespan and reducing the onset of age-related disease is provided comprising administering an effective dose of oxaloacetate to an individual in need thereof. As used herein, the phrase "age-related disease" refers to any nµMber of conditions attributable to advance in age. These conditions include, without limitation, osteoporosis, bone loss, arthritis, stiffening joints, cataracts, macular degeneration, and heart disease including atherosclerosis and dyslipidemia. The phrase "age related disease" further encompasses neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer Disease and related disorders, Parkinson's Disease, and cancer. It has been observed that mammals which undergo CR have a reduced incidence of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer disease. The addition of excess oxaloacetate to the cytosol of the cell results in the same signaling mechanism in the cells as CR to turn on the necessary beneficial genes necessary for neurological protection.<br>
[0051] Also included within the meaning of "age-related disease" are cosmetic concerns such as loss of skin firmness and elasticity as well as increase wrinkle depth and pore sizes associated with aging. "Age-related disease" further includes other symptoms associated with aged skin such as wrinkles, rhytids, sun damage, dull appearance of the skin, sagging skin, jowls, keratosis, melasma, and hyperpigmentation.<br>
[0052] Oxaloacetate can be used to protect DNA and enhance DNA repair in skin and other tissues subjected to ultra violet (UV) light. Unlike a sunscreen that blocks UV, oxaloacetate enhances the repairs to DNA in a similar fashion as occurs in CR (Lipman et al.) because addition of excess oxaloacetate mimics the same intercellular signaling conditions as exist in CR. CR has been shown to enhance repairs to DNA in many studies as per mechanisms outlined in references 36, 37, 38, 39 40 and 44. One advantage of using oxaloacetate to mimic CR rather than utilizing CR is that oxaloacetate can be localized on the skin, to create "localized CR" conditions in just the contacted skin, while all other forms of CR take place in the entire<br>
"organism. Thus, oxaloacetate can be combined with a UV sunblock or cosmetic to produce ongoing enhancement of DNA repair to skin cells from UV damage. Reduction in this damage and repair of the damage leads to maintaining younger looking skin for a longer period of time, leads to reduced incidences of skin cancer and may be used as a treatment or assist in the treatment of skin cancer.<br>
[0053] Oxaloacetate can act in another pathway to extend lifespan and reduce the onset of age related disease by interfering with insulin signaling. Insulin-like signaling has been shown to also control aging, metabolism and development. Mutations in the daf-2 gene and age-1 phosphoinositide 3 -kinase gene of Caenorhabditis elegans have lead to increases in lifespan. The insulin-like signaling pathway may also be affected by caloric restriction to retard aging. Oxaloacetate has been shown to block at least a portion of the insulin signaling pathways by Kahn (Kahn, et al, Insulin Increases NADH/NAD+ Redox State, Which Stimulates Guanylate Cyclase in Vascular Smooth Muscle, American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd. 2002, Vol.15, 273-279). NADH is also important to insulin signaling as shown by MacDonald (MacDonald, et al, Histochemical Evidence for Pathways Insulin Cells Use to Oxidize Glycolysis-Derived NADH, Metabolism, Vol. 51, No. 3 (March), 2002, pp 318-321), and oxaloacetate added to the cytosol reduces the availability of NADH.<br>
[0054] A third pathway to extend lifespan and reduce the onset of age related disease by oxaloacetate may be in the protective effects of oxaloacetate to mitochondrial DNA. Yamamoto, et al (Yamamoto et al, "Effect of alpha-ketoglutarate and Oxaloacetate on brain mitochondrial DNA damage and seizures induced by kainic acid in mice", Toxicology Letters: 2003: 143: 115-122) showed that both Oxaloacetate and its precursor alpha- ketoglutarate protected brain mitochondrial DNA from damage in mice. Yamamoto failed to teach, however, if this protection could increase lifespan or reduce the onset of age related disease, as was discovered in this invention.<br>
[0055] Oxaloacetate can be administered alone to extend lifespan and reduce the onset of age-related disease or in combination with another therapeutic agent. As used herein, the term "therapeutic agent" is a broad term that includes antibacterial agents, antiviral agents, anti-fungals, chemotherapeutics, antihistamines, proteins, enzymes, hormones, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drags, immunostimulatory compounds such as cytokines, and steroids. Suitable antibiotics include, without limitation, amoxicillin, ampicillin, bacampicillin, carbenicillin<br>
indanyl, mezlocillin, peperacillin, ticarcillin, amoxicillin- clavulanic acid, ampicillin-sulbactam, benzylpenicillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, methicillin, oxacillin, penicillin G, penicillin V, piperacillin + tazobactam, ticarcillin + clavulanic acid, nafcillin, cefadroxil, cefazolin, cephalexin, cephalothin, cephapirin, cephradine, cefaclor, cefamandol, cefonicid, cefotetan, cefoxitin, cefprozil, ceftmetazole, cefuroxime, cefuroxime axetil, larcarbef, cefdinir, ceftibuten, cefoperazone, ceftxime, cefotaxime, cefpodoxime proxetil, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone, cefepime, azithromycin, clarithromycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, lincomycin, troleandomycin, cinoxacin, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, gatifloxacin, grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, moxifloxacin, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, ofloxcin, sparfloxacin, trovafloxacin, oxolinic acid, gemifloxacin, perfloxacin, imipenem cilastatin, meropenem, aztreonam, amikacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, netilmicin, streptomycin, tobramycin, paaromomycin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, demeclocycline, doxycycline, methacycline, minocycline, oxytetracycline, tetracycline, chlortetracycline, mafenide, silver sulfadiazine, sulfacetamide, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfasalazine, sulfisoxazole, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethizole, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapentine, linezolid, quinopristin + dalfopristin, chlroamphenico, colistemetate, fosfomycin, isoniazid, methenamine, metronidazol, mupirocin, nitrofurantoin, nitrofurazone, novobiocin, spectinomycin, trimethoprim, colistin, cycloserine, capreomycin, ethionamide, pyrazinamide, para-aminosalicyclic acid, and erythromycin ethylsuccinate + sulfisoxazole. Examples of suitable chemotherapeutic agents include an anticancer agent like cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, melphalan, estramustine, iphosphamide, prednimustin, busulphan, tiottepa, carmustin, lomustine, methotrexate, azathioprine, mercaptopurine, thioguanine, cytarabine, fluorouracil, vinblastine, vincristine, vindesine, etoposide, teniposide, dactinomucin, doxorubin, dunorubicine, epirubicine, bleomycin, nitomycin, cisplatin, carboplatin, procarbazine, amacrine, mitoxantron, tamoxifen, nilutamid, or aminoglutemide. Immunostimulatory compounds include, without limitation, a vaccine adjuvant, a vaccine, a peptide, a cytokine like IL-I, IL-2, IL- 12, IL-15, IFN-a, IFN-p, or IFN-y, or a flavonoid like flavone acetic acids and xanthenone-4-acetic acids.<br>
[0056] When administered in combination with another therapeutic agent, oxaloacetate can be administered separately or as a single formulation with the antibiotic. If administered separately, oxaloacetate should be given in a temporally proximate manner with the antibiotic. In one embodiment, the therapeutic agent and oxaloacetate are given within one week<br>
of each other. In another embodiment, the therapeutic agent and oxaloacetate are given within twenty-four hours of each other. In yet another embodiment, the therapeutic agent and oxaloacetate are given within one hour of each other. The administration can be by oral, local, or by systemic injection or infusion. Other methods of administration may also be suitable as will be appreciated by one of skill in the art.<br>
[0057] Methods and compositions are described herein for the modulation of body weight, reduction of fat, treatment of obesity, reduction in cellulite accµMulation. In addition to the activation of beneficial CR genes, the administration of oxaloacetate results in the reduction of fat, despite the amount of food consµMed, as the differentiation of cells into fat cells is blocked by the activation of Sir2 (Sirtl in hµMans), which also causes current fat cells shed their fat. Activation of the hµMan Sirtl gene that is normally activated in CR blunts the protein PPAR gamma that activates fat storage genes. Sirtl activation also causes formed fat cells to shed their fat. In some embodiments of the invention, a method of treating obesity via the administration of an effective dose of oxaloacetate is provided. Obesity, defined as an excess of body fat relative to lean body mass, also contributes to a host of other diseases including, without limitation, increased incidences of coronary artery disease, stroke, and diabetes. Hence, the administration of oxaloacetate would be beneficial not only for treating obesity but also for treating the diseases associated with obesity. In one embodiment, a method of treating a non-obese individual for the reduction of unwanted body fat is provided comprising administering an effective dose of oxaloacetate.<br>
[0058] In another embodiment of the current invention, oxaloacetate can be used to reduce the incidence of cancer, or to stop the spread of cancer to non-cancerous cells. Mammals that undergo CR have up to a 40% lower cancer rate. CR has been shown to enhance the repair of DNA (Lipman et al, "The influence of dietary restriction on DNA repair in rodents: a preliminary study", Mech Ageing Dev 1989: 48: 135-43; Weraarchakul et al, "The effect of aging and dietary restriction on DNA repair", Exp Cell Res 1989; 181:197- 204; Licastro et al, "Effect of dietary restriction upon the age-associated decline of lymphocyte DNA repair activity in mice", Age 1988: 11: 48-52; Srivastava et al, "Decreased fidelity of DNA polymerases and decreased DNA excision repair in aging mice: Effects of caloric restriction", Biochem Biophys Res Commun 1992: 182: 712-21; Tilley et al, "Enhanced unscheduled DNA synthesis by secondary cultures of lung cells established from calorically restricted aged rats", Mech Ageing<br>
Dev 1992: 63" 165-76), which may be one reason for the reduction in cancer rates. Addition of excess oxaloacetate to the cytosol of the cell results in the same signaling mechanism in the cells as CR to turn on the necessary beneficial genes necessary for cancer protection. Malignancies against which the treatment may be directed include, but are not limited to, primary and metastatic malignant solid tumor disease, and hematological malignancies such as acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute and chronic lymphatic leukemia, multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, hairy cell leukemia, myelodisplastic syndrome, polycytaemia vera, and essential thrombocytosis.<br>
[0059] Methods and compositions for countering the effects of alcohol composition are disclosed herein. The administration of oxaloacetate results in an increase in NAD+/NADH ratio, which can quickly counter the effects of alcohol consµMption and reduce the symptoms associated with over-indulgence of alcohol. These symptoms include, without limitation, headache, poor sense of overall well-being, diarrhea, loss of appetite, shakiness, fatigue, and nausea. Other symptoms include decreased reaction times, less ability to concentrate, lower managerial skills, and increased risk for injury, even after some of the more obvious hangover symptoms are gone and alcohol can no longer be detected in the blood. The method includes identifying an individual who has consµMed amounts of alcohol and administering to that individual an effective amount of oxaloacetate. As used herein, an effective amount of oxaloacetate includes from about 0.5 mg to about 75 mg of oxaloacetate per kg of weight. In a preferred embodiment, an effective amount of oxaloacetate is between about 2 mg to about 40 mg of oxaloacetate per kg of body weight. As will be described in greater detailed below, in a preferred embodiment, oxaloacetate can be administered via injection or ingestion. Pharmaceutical Preparations and Methods of Administration<br>
[0060] Oxaloacetate can be administered to an individual at therapeutically effective doses to prolong lifespan and/or treat or ameliorate age related diseases and body weight disorders. As used herein, "oxaloacetate" includes oxaloacetic acid, the salt of the acid, or oxaloacetate in a buffered solution as well as mixtures thereof. The term similarly includes oxaloacetate precursors such as alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate.<br>
[0059] A therapeutically effective dose refers to that amount of oxaloacetate sufficient to result in the desired effect such as the prolongation of life span, treatment of age-related disorders, and/or amelioration of symptoms of body weight disorders.<br>
'Effective Dose<br>
[0060] Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of oxaloacetate can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50 /ED50. The LD50 of alpha-ketoglutarate for mice is above 5 g/kg of body weight. The LD50 of oxaloacetate is above 5 g/kg of body weight. Oxaloacetate has a very low toxicity, as would be expected from a chemical involved in the Citric Acid Cycle of every cell.<br>
[0061] Toxicity studies of oxaloacetate run in Japan in 1968 on rats indicates that levels of oxaloacetate at 83 mg/kg of body weight caused changes in pancreatic islets. Some islets were decreased in size and hyperemic, alpha cells being atrophic, while beta cells were hypertrophic and stained densely. At lower doses, 41 mg/kg of body weight, the pancreas of the rates only demonstrated proliferation and hyperplasia of the islet cells. The liver, hypophysis, adrenals and gonadal glands showed no particular changes (Yoshikawa, Kiyohiko, "Studies on Anti-diabetic Effect of SodiµM Oxaloacetate", Tohoku Journal of Experimental Medicine, 1968, volµMe 96, pp. 127-141). Further studies by the inventor using oxaloacetate in mice at a dosage 300% to 50,000% greater than proposed in hµMans indicated negative toxicity—the mice live longer than the control group. The safety of this compound in reasonable amounts is assured because the compound is a hµMan metabolite.<br>
[0062] In clinical studies examining the effect of oxaloacetate on diabetes in hµMans, 21 diabetic patients received 100 mg to 1,000 mg (2-10 mg/kg of body weight). There were no negative side effects. Fasting blood glucose levels dropped an average of 24% in the patients and urine glucose levels dropped in 19 out of the 21 patients (Yoshikawa).<br>
[0063] An example of an effective dose of oxaloacetate administered by an intravenous injection is from between about 0.5 mg to about 1 g of oxaloacetate for each kg of body weight, hi a preferred embodiment, the effective dose of oxaloacetate is between about 2.0. mg and about 40 mg for each kg of body weight. The effective dose can be administered in multiple injections over several hours, or continuously. Effective oral dosing would likewise range from about 0.5 mg to about 1 g of oxaloacetate for each kg of body weight with the preferred effective dosage range between about 2 mg to about 40 mg of oxaloacetate for each kg<br>
body weight. For example, an adult male weighing approximately 80 kg would be administered between about 150 mg to about 3.5 g of oxaloacetate orally per day. Dermally, topical formulations comprising concentrations of about 0.5 to 16 niM of oxaloacetate are effective. CR studies indicate that restricting calories every-other-day yields the same beneficial results as daily CR. Similarly, in some embodiments, oxaloacetate can be administered every-other-day, as once the genes are activated, the effect lasts for at least a two-day period of time. In other embodiments, oxaloacetate is administered 3 times per day after each meal. Formulations<br>
[0061] Pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers or excipients. Thus, oxaloacetate and its physiologically acceptable salts and solvates may be formulated for administration by inhalation or insufflation (either through the mouth or the nose) or oral, buccal, topical, transdermal, parenteral, or rectal administration, hi the case of inhalation, the administration of oxaloacetate will provide aging benefits directly to lung tissue, even if the dosage of oxaloacetate administered is less than is needed to benefit the entire organism. Inhalation of oxaloacetate will delay the on-set of age-related diseases of the lungs and will provide protection from lung diseases.<br>
[0062] Oxaloacetate is acidic. The acidity is unlikely to affect organisms that ingest the compound in beneficial amounts as the interior conditions of the stomach are also very acidic. The acidity may affect other tissues, including but not limited to the skin or lungs, that may benefit from the direct application of oxaloacetate. Therefore, in another embodiment, a composition of matter can be created by mixing oxaloacetate with a buffer solution or a base or used as a salt of oxaloacetate so the delivered compound is not caustic. This will enable higher concentrations of oxaloacetate to be delivered safely to the organism, especially if the oxaloacetate is not delivered by oral ingestion.<br>
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for example, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g., pregelatinized maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calciµM hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g., magnesiµM stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g., potato starch or sodium starch glycollate); or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate). The<br>
tablets may be coated by methods well known in the art. Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g., sorbitol syrup, cellulose derivatives or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g., lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g., almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol or fractionated vegetable oils); and preservatives (e.g., methyl or propyl-p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). The preparations may also contain buffer salts, flavoring, coloring and sweetening agents as appropriate.<br>
[0063] While the absorption of oxaloacetate from the digestive tract will increase the entire organism's oxaloacetate levels, the immediate contact of oxaloacetate to the cells in the digestive tract will preferentially be in contact with the digestive tract cells, allowing the reduction in age-related diseases such as colon cancer, even if the ingested amounts of oxaloacetate are insufficient to provide benefit to the entire organism.<br>
[0067] Preparations for oral administration may be suitably formulated to give controlled release of the active compound. For buccal administration the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner. For administration by inhalation, the compounds for use according to the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebuliser, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of e.g. gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br>
[0064] For the protection of DNA from UV exposure and to enhance DNA repair of the UV damage, also for the treatment of rhytids or skin wrinkles, a preferred method of administration of oxaloacetate is by topical application. The topical pharmaceutical and cosmetic compositions of the present invention maybe made into a wide variety of product types. These include, but are not limited to lotions, creams, beach oils, gels, sticks, sprays, ointments, pastes, mousses and cosmetics. These product types may comprise several types of pharmaceutical or cosmetic carrier systems including, but not limited to solutions, emulsions, gels and solids. The<br>
pharmaceutical and cosmetic compositions of the present invention formulated as solutions typically include a pharmaceutically-acceptable aqueous or organic solvent. The terms "pharmaceutically-acceptable aqueous solvent" and "pharmaceutically-acceptable organic solvent" refer to a solvent which is capable of having dissolved therein the anti-wrinkle oxaloacetate, and possesses acceptable safety properties (e.g., irritation and sensitization characteristics). One example of a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous solvent is distilled water. Examples of a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable organic solvent include, for example, monohydric alcohols, such as ethanol, and polyhydric alcohols, such as glycols. If the topical pharmaceutical and cosmetic compositions of the present disclosure are formulated as an aerosol and applied to the skin as a spray-on, a propellant is added to a solution composition.<br>
[0065] In one embodiment, topical pharmaceutical and cosmetic compositions of the present invention further comprise a suitable amount of a topical pharmaceutical and cosmetically-acceptable emollient. As used herein, "emollients" refer to materials used for the prevention or relief of dryness, as well as for the protection of the skin. Wide varieties of suitable emollients are known and may be used herein. Sagarin, Cosmetics, Science and Technology, 2nd Edition, Vol. 1, pp. 32-43 (1972), contains nµMerous examples of suitable materials.

Particularly useful emollients which provide skin conditioning are glycerol, hexanetriol, butanetriol, lactic acid and its salts, urea, pyrrolidone carboxylic acid and its salts, amino acids, guanidine, diglycerol and triglycerol.<br>
[0066] Alternatively, the composition can be formulated as a lotion. A lotion can be made from a solution carrier system. In some embodiments, the lotion includes from about 1% to about 20%, for example, from about 5% to about 10%, of an emollient; and from about 50% to about 90%, for example, from about 60% to about 80% of water.<br>
[0067] Another type of product that may be formulated from a solution carrier system is a cream or ointment. An ointment can comprise a simple base of animal or vegetable oils or semi-solid hydrocarbons (oleaginous). Ointments can also include absorption ointment bases which absorb water to form emulsions. Optionally, the ointment carriers is water soluble. An ointment can include from about 2% to about 10% of an emollient plus from about 0.1% to about 2% of a thickening agent. Examples of suitable thickening agents include: cellulose derivatives (e.g., methyl cellulose and hydroxy propylmethylcellulose), synthetic high molecular weight polymers (e.g., carboxyvinyl polymer and polyvinyl alcohol), plant hydrocolloids (e.g., karaya gµM and tragacanth gµM), clay thickeners (e.g., colloidal magnesiµM alµMinµM silicate and bentonite), and carboxyvinyl polymers (CARBOPOLS®; sold by B. F. Goodrich Company, such polymers are described in detail in Brown, U.S. Pat. No. 2,798,053, issued Jul. 2, 1975). A more complete disclosure of thickening agents useful herein can be found in Sagarin, Cosmetics, Science and Technology, 2nd Edition, Vol. 1, pp.72-73 (1972). If the carrier is formulated as an emulsion, from about 1% to about 10%, for instance, from about 2% to about 5%, of the carrier system comprises an emulsifier. Suitable emulsifiers include nonionic, anionic or cationic emulsifiers. Exemplary emulsifiers are disclosed in, for example, McCutcheon's Detergents and Emulsifiers, North American Edition, pages 317-324 (1986). Preferred emulsifiers are anionic or nonionic, although other types can also be employed.<br>
[0068] Single emulsion skin care preparations, such as lotions and creams, of the oil-in-water type and water-in-oil type are well known in the cosmetic arts and are useful in the present embodiments. Multiphase emulsion compositions, such as the water-in-oil-in water type are also useful in the present embodiments. In general, such single or multiphase emulsions contain water, emollients and emulsifiers as essential ingredients. Triple emulsion carrier systems comprising an oil-in-water-in-silicone fluid emulsion composition are also useful in the present embodiments.<br>
[0069] Another emulsion carrier system useful in the topical pharmaceutical and cosmetic compositions of the present disclosure is a microemulsion carrier system. Such a<br>
system preferably comprises from about 9% to about 15% squalane; from about 25% to about 40% silicone oil; from about 8% to about 20% of a fatty alcohol; from about 15% to about 30% of polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono-fatty acid (commercially available under the trade name Tweens) or other nonionics; and from about 7% to about 20% water. This carrier system is combined with the therapeutic agents described above.<br>
[0070] If the topical pharmaceutical and cosmetic compositions of the present disclosure are formulated as a gel or a cosmetic stick, a suitable amount of a thickening agent, as disclosed supra, is added to a cream or lotion formulation. The topical pharmaceutical and cosmetic compositions of the present disclosure may also be formulated as makeup products such as foundations, blush, and lipstick and can contain conventional cosmetic adjuvants, such as dyes, opacifiers, pigments and perfµMes. Foundations are solution or lotion-based with appropriate amounts of thickeners such as algin, xanthan gµM, cellulose gµM, cocamide DBA, guar gµM lanolin alcohol, paraffin, and propylene glycol, pigments including ultramarine blue, titaniµM dioxide, and carmine, colorants such as FD&amp;C Red No. 40 and FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5, moisturizers, and fragrance. Optionally, the foundation can include a sunscreen agent. The topical pharmaceutical and cosmetic compositions of the present disclosure may contain, in addition to the aforementioned components, a wide variety of additional oil-soluble materials and/or water-soluble materials conventionally used in topical compositions, at their established levels. Various water-soluble materials may also be present in the compositions of this invention. These include hµMectants, such as glycerol, sorbitol, propylene glycol, alkoxylated glucose and hexanetriol, ethyl cellulose, polyvinylalcohol, carboxymethyl cellulose, vegetable gµMs and clays such as VEEGµM® (magnesiµM alµMinµM silicate, R. T. Vanderbilt, Inc.); proteins and polypeptides, preservatives such as the methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl esters of hydroxybenzoic acid (Parabens®~Mallinckrodt Chemical Corporation), EDTA, methylisothiazolinone and imidazolidinyl ureas (Germall 115®-Sutton Laboratories); and an alkaline agent such as sodiµM hydroxide or potassiµM hydroxide to neutralize, if desired, part of the fatty acids or thickener which may be present.<br>
[0071] In some embodiments, oxaloacetate can be formulated as a hair product such as a shampoo or conditioner. Use of these products would then have a dual benefit to the user including a reduction in skin aging and delay in the onset of age-related skin disease including<br>
cancer. Oxaloacetate, when applied topically to the hair, can also prevent or reduce hair loss and hair graying.<br>
[0072] The topical pharmaceutical and cosmetic compositions of the present disclosure can also include a safe and effective amount of a penetration enhancing agent. Other conventional skin care product additives may also be included in the compositions of the present invention. For example, collagen, elastin, hydrolysates, primrose oil, jojoba oil, epidermal growth factor, soybean saponins, mucopolysaccharides, and mixtures thereof may be used. Various vitamins can also be included in the compositions of the present invention. For example, Vitamin A, and derivatives thereof, Vitamin B2, biotin, pantothenic, Vitamin D, and mixtures thereof can be used.<br>
[0073] In some embodiments, the composition comprising oxaloacetate is incorporated into anti-wrinkle skin cleaning compositions. The skin cleaning compositions comprise a cosmetically acceptable surfactant in addition to oxaloacetate. The term "cosmetically-acceptable surfactant" refers to a surfactant that is not only an effective skin cleanser, but also can be used without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like. Furthermore, the surfactant should be capable of being commingled with the anti- wrinkle components in a manner such that there is no interaction that would substantially reduce the efficacy of the composition for treating wrinkles in mammalian skin. In addition to the cosmetically effective amounts of the active ingredients, the skin cleaning compositions of the present disclosure contain from about 1% to about 90%, preferably from about 5% to about 10%, of a cosmetically-acceptable surfactant. The physical form of the skin cleansing compositions is not critical. The compositions can be, for example, formulated as toilet bars, liquids, pastes, or mousses. Toilet bars are most preferred since this is the form of cleansing agent most commonly used to wash the skin. The surfactant component of the disclosed compositions is selected from the group consisting of anionic, nonionic, zwitterionic, amphoteric and ampho lytic surfactants, as well as mixtures of these surfactants. Such surfactants are well known to those skilled in the detergency art. The cleaning compositions of the present disclosure can optionally contain, at their art-established levels, materials which are conventionally used in skin cleansing compositions.<br>
[0074] Other skin care products for the treatment of skin wrinkles may contain combinations of additional active ingredients. Such combinations include, for example,<br>
sunscreens and sunblocks. OptimµM regulation of skin wrinkling resulting from exposure to U.V. light can be obtained by using a combination of oxaloacetate together with sunscreens or sunblocks. Useful sunblocks include, for example, zinc oxide and titaniµM dioxide. Photo damage is a predominant cause of skin wrinkling. Thus, for purposes of wrinkle prevention, the combination of the disclosed compositions with a UVA and/or UVB sunscreen would be most desirable. The inclusion of sunscreens in compositions of the present invention will provide immediate protection against acute UV damage. Thus, the sunscreen will prevent further wrinkle formation caused by UV radiation, while the anti-wrinkle agents treat existing wrinkles and skin atrophy, and enhances DNA repair in the cells of the skin.<br>
[0075] A wide variety of conventional sunscreening agents are suitable for use in combination with the anti-wrinkle formulations. Sagarin, et al., at Chapter VII, pages 189 et seq., of Cosmetics Science and Technology, disclose nµMerous suitable agents. Specific suitable sunscreening agents include, for example: p-aminobenzoic acid, its salts and its derivatives (ethyl, iso-butyl, glyceryl esters; p-dimethylaminobenzoic acid); anthranilates (i.e., o-aminobenzoates; methyl, menthyl, phenyl, benzyl, phenylethyl, linalyl, terpinyl, and cyclohexenyl esters); salicylates (amyl, phenyl, benzyl, menthyl, glyceryl, and dipropylene glycol esters); cinnamic acid derivatives (methyl and benzyl esters, alpha.-phenyl cinnamonitrile; butyl cinnamoyl pyruvate); dihydroxycinnamic acid derivatives (µMbelliferone, methyl µMbelliferone, methylacetoµMbelliferone); trihydroxycinnamic acid derivatives (esculetin, methylesculetin, daphnetin, and the glucosides, esculin and daphnin); hydrocarbons (diphenylbutadiene, stilbene); dibenzalacetone and benzalacetophenone; naphtholsulfonates (sodiµM salts of 2-naphthol-3,6-disulfonic and of 2-naphthol-6,8- disulfonic acids); dihydroxynaphmoic acid and its salts; o- and p- hydroxybiphenyidisulfonates; (7-hydroxy, 7-methyl, 3-phenyl); diazoles (2-acetyl-3-bromoindazole, phenyl benzoxazole, methyl naphthoxazole, various aryl benzothiazoles); quinine salts (bisulfate, sulfate, chloride, oleate, and tannate); quinoline derivatives (8- hydroxyquinoline salts, 2-phenylquinoIine); hydroxy- or methoxy-substituted benzophenones; uric and vilouric acids; tannic acid and its derivatives (e.g., hexaethyl ether); (butyl carbotol)(6-propyl piperonyl) ether; hydiOquinone; benzophenones (oxybenzene, sulisobenzone, dioxybenzone, benzoresorcinol, 2,2',4,4'tetrahydroxy-benzophenone, 2,2'- dihydroxy-4,4'-dimethoxybenzophenone, octabenzone; 4-isopropyidibenzoyl-methane; butylmethoxy dibenzoylmethane; etocrylene; and 4-isopropyl-<br>
dibenzoylmethane). Mixtures of sunscreen compounds may be used to optimize the desired sunscreen properties of the formulation. A safe and effective amount of sunscreen may be used in the compositions of the present invention. The sun-screening agent must be compatible with the anti-wrinkle agents. Generally the composition may comprise from about 1% to about 20%, preferably from about 2% to about 10%, of a sunscreening agent. Exact amounts will vary depending upon the sunscreen chosen and the desired Sun Protection Factor (SPF). An agent may also be added to any of the compositions of the present invention to improve the skin substantivity of those compositions, particularly to enhance their resistance to being washed off by water, or rubbed off.<br>
[0076] In yet a further embodiment of the current invention, the oxaloacetate delivered topically can be mixed with a penetration enhancing agent such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), combinations of sucrose fatty acid esters with a sulfoxide or phosphoric oxide, or eugenol, that allows faster migration of the oxaloacetate into the dermal tissues and then further into deeper cellular tissues, including cellulite tissues where stimulation of the Sirtl gene will cause a reduction of fat tissues.<br>
[0077] In one embodiment, the disclosed compounds are administered through a topical delivery system, Implantable or injectable polymer matrices, and transdermal formulations, from which active ingredients are slowly released are also well known and can be used in the disclosed methods. The controlled release components described above can be used as the means to delivery the disclosed compounds. The compositions can further include components adapted to improve the stability or effectiveness of the applied formulation, such as preservatives, antioxidants, skin penetration enhancers and sustained release materials. Examples of such components are described in the following reference works hereby incorporated by reference: Martindale — The Extra Pharmacopoeia (Pharmaceutical Press, London 1993) and Martin (ed.), Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences.<br>
[0078] Controlled release preparations can be achieved by the use of polymers to complex or absorb oxaloacetate. The controlled delivery can be exercised by selecting appropriate macromolecule such as polyesters, polyamino acids, polyvinylpyrrolidone, ethylenevinyl acetate, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, and protamine sulfate, and the concentration of these macromolecule as well as the methods of incorporation are selected in order to control release of active compound.<br>
[0079] Hydrogels, wherein the oxaloacetate is dissolved in an aqueous constituent to gradually release over time, can be prepared by copolymerization of hydrophilic mono- olefmic monomers such as ethylene glycol methacrylate. Matrix devices, wherein the oxaloacetate is dispersed in a matrix of carrier material, can be used. The carrier can be porous, non-porous, solid, semi-solid, permeable or impermeable. Alternatively, a device comprising a central reservoir of the oxaloacetate compound surrounded by a rate controlling membrane can be used to control the release of oxaloacetate. Rate controlling membranes include ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer or butylene terephthalate/polytetrarnethylene ether terephthalate. Use of silicon rubber depots are also contemplated.<br>
[0080] In another embodiment, transdermal patches, steady state reservoirs sandwiched between an impervious backing and a membrane face, and transdermal formulations, can also be used to deliver oxaloacetate. Transdermal administration systems are well known in the art. Occlusive transdermal patches for the administration of an active agent to the skin or mucosa are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,573,996, 4,597,961 and 4,839,174, which are hereby incorporated by reference. One type of transdermal patch is a polymer matrix in which the active agent is dissolved in a polymer matrix through which the active ingredient diffuses to the skin. Such transdermal patches are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,839,174, 4,908,213 and 4,943,435, which are hereby incorporated by reference, hi one embodiment, the steady state reservoir carries doses of oxaloacetate in doses from about 2 mg to 40 mg per day.<br>
[0081] Present transdermal patch systems are designed to deliver smaller doses over longer periods of time, up to days and weeks. A rate-controlling outer microporous membrane, or micropockets of the disclosed oxaloacetate dispersed throughout a silicone polymer matrix, can be used to control the release rate. Such rate-controlling means are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,676,969, which is hereby incorporated by reference, hi another embodiment, the oxaloacetate is released from the patch into the skin of the patient in about 20-30 minutes or less.<br>
[0082] These transdermal patches and formulations can be used with or without use of a penetration enhancer such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), combinations of sucrose fatty acid esters with a sulfoxide or phosphoric oxide, or eugenol. The use of electrolytic transdermal patches is also within the scope of the methods disclosed herein. Electrolytic transdermal patches are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,474,527, 5,336,168, and 5,328,454, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
[0083] Oxaloacetate may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. The injected oxaloacetate can be mixed with other beneficial agents prior to injection including but not limited to antibiotics and other medications, saline solutions, blood plasma, and other fluids. Immediate contact of elevated levels of oxaloacetate with the vascular system cells will result in the reduction in age-related diseases such as hardening of the arteries, even if the amounts of oxaloacetate are insufficient to provide age-related benefits to the entire organism. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
[0088] Oxaloacetate may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
[0089] In addition to the formulations described previously, oxaloacetate may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.<br>
[0090] The compositions may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device which may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. The pack may for example comprise metal' or plastic foil, such as a blister pack. The pack or dispenser device may be accompanied by instructions for administration.<br>
[0084] In yet still another embodiment, oxaloacetate can be mixed with animal foods to increase the life span and general health of pets and other animals. Oxaloacetate can either be formulated as part of the animal food or administered separately as a supplement to the animal's food. As those skilled in the art know, dry pet foods, typically dry dog foods, normally contain protein, fat, fiber, non-fiber carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins and moisture components. For example, as major ingredients, there are typically one or two cereal grains, generally corn, wheat<br>
• and/or rice, hi addition, for a protein source they may contain poultry meal, by-product meat, meat and bone meal, or other animal or fish meal by-products. At times as well, grain protein supplements such as com gluten, soybean meal or other oil seed meals can be added, hi addition to an effective amount of oxaloacetate of between about 0.01% to 0.1% by weight of the chow, animal chow of the present invention additionally includes the following: typical nutrient content in the food dry matter includes crude protein from 14% to 50%, usually 20% to 25%; crude fat from 5% to 25%; and crude fiber usually is present in the range of from about 3% to 14%, usually about 5% to 7%, with the total mineral or ash content being within the range of 3% to 10%, usually 4% to 7%. The important point is not the precise formulation of the pet food, since many conventional and satisfactory ones for use in conjunction with the present invention are available on the market. Rather, the key to success is that a sufficient amount of oxaloacetate component be added to pet food rations, whichever formulation is used, to provide the oxaloacetate activity level at the ranges necessary to increase life span, reduce body weight, and treat age-related disorders.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0085] Particular aspects herein can be more readily understood by reference to the following examples, which are intended to exemplify the teachings herein, without limiting their scope to the particular exemplified embodiments.<br>
Example 1<br>
[0086] The Caenorhabditis elegans nematode worm is commonly used as a test animal because its genetics are well understood and the basic cellular energy pathways are well conserved throughout all animal species, including hµMans. A test with these well- understood worms on metabolic energy pathways is a test on the animal kingdom. The conservation of the energy pathways is a reason that CR has worked in all animal species tested.<br>
[0087] C. elegans (N2 wild type, from Carolina Biological Supply) was used as a test organism to assess the addition of oxaloacetate therapy (from Sigma Aldrich Company) applied to the cells to extend lifespan and to act as a caloric restriction "mimic". The oxaloacetate was mixed in a concentration of 16 mM into the nematode growth agar (from Carolina Biological Supply Company) on eight experimental plates on which the C. elegans resides. A similar set of eight control plates with the same nematode growth agar was also prepared. Both the eight<br>
oxaloacetate plates and eight control plates included 80 µM of 5'flurodeoxyuridine (from Sigma Aldrich Company) to eliminate the development of eggs into live progeny, hi addition, five "starter plates" were made using nematode growth agar and no 5'flurodeoxyuridine.<br>
[0088] All plates were streaked with 0.5 ml bacteria Luria broth containing E. coli as a food source for the nematodes. The bacteria were allowed to grow on the plates for several days at 37 °C prior to adding C elegans.<br>
[0089] Ten C. elegans nematodes were transferred to each of five "starter plates" and were left on the plates for 12 hours to lay eggs. The C. elegans were then removed and the eggs were allowed to grow into young adults for two days. Ten nematodes were then transferred to each control plate and oxaloacetate plate by "picking" worms with a microprobe from the starter plate and moving it onto the target test plates.<br>
[0090] The day after the starter plates have been started with the 10 C. elegans was designated "day 0", and was the estimated time of birth. The C. elegans were kept out of direct sunlight and were raised at a temperature of 21 °C. The plates with the C. elegans were counted every day to determine the nµMber of dead nematodes. Nematodes were scored as dead when they no longer respond to a gentle prodding with a probe. Lifespan is defined as the time elapsed from when the nematodes are hatched (lifespan = 0) to when they are scored as dead. Nematodes that crawl off the plates or are otherwise lost during the assay have been excluded from calculations. The dead nematodes were removed from the plates each day with microprobe. The total population is the sµM of all found dead worms. The counting of the nematodes was continued until all nematodes were dead. The data was then charted and is represented in Figure 2.<br>
[0091] Data indicated an increase in average lifespan of 23.6% in the nematodes that lived on the oxaloacetate plates as opposed to the control group. Maximal life span was also increased in the oxaloacetate containing plates by 40%.<br>
Example 2<br>
[0092] The experiment in Example 1 was repeated for a range of oxaloacetate concentrations in the nematode growth agar. An increase in lifespan for C. elegans was seen at 2 mM oxaloacetate in the agar, and increased with 4 mM, 6 mM, 8 mM, 10 mM, 12 mM, 14 mM<br>
and 16 mM concentrations. The highest increase in lifespan was at 16 mM (approximate 25%) for the concentrations tested, and the lowest increase was a 2 mM (approximately 10%).<br>
Example 3<br>
[0093] The experiment in Example 1 was repeated but additional plates containing splitomycin alone with the agar and splitomycin with oxaloacetate and the agar were also used. Splitomycin is a selective inhibitor for the Sir2 gene (Sir2a in yeast, Sirtl in humans). The nematodes on plates with inhibited Sir2 function but no oxaloacetate lived for shorter periods than the control group as reflected in Figure 3. Figure 3 illustrates that similar to CR, oxaloacetate upregulates the Silent Information Regulator gene (Sir2) to increase lifespan. It also shows that other beneficial CR activated genes are upregulated and downregulated by oxaloacetate to increase lifespan without Sir2 activation. Nematodes on plates with oxaloacetate lived approximately 36% longer than the control group. Nematodes on plates with inhibited Sir2 function but also included oxaloacetate had an increased lifespan above the control group of 15%. This demonstrates that Sir2 makes up approximately 1/3 of the lifespan increase in CR, while the other CR beneficial genes contribute to as much as 2/3 of the lifespan increase. It also demonstrates that one of the genes activated by oxaloacetate addition is Sir2 (Sir2a in yeast, Sirtl in humans).<br>
Example 4<br>
[0095] The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (Vestigal type, from Carolina Biological Supply) was used as a test organism to assess the addition of oxaloacetate therapy (from Sigma Aldrich Company) applied to the cells to extend lifespan and to act as a caloric restriction "mimic". The fruit fly is more complex than C. elegans, but the metabolic pathways that involve calorie restriction are a basic building block of life, and are conserved throughout the animal kingdom. In the test group of 53 flies in four vials (2 virgin male, 2 virgin female), oxaloacetate was mixed in a concentration of 16 mM into the 15 ml of distilled water used to wet the 15 ml of dry fly food (from Carolina Biological Supply Company). A small amount of yeast was added on top of the fly food. A similar control group of 56 flies in 4 vials (2 virgin male, 2 virgin female) were also prepared, except that no Oxaloacetate was added.<br>
[0096] The flies were kept in a room receiving reflected natural sunlight at a temperature of 21 °C. Each of the flies used emerged from the pupae state within 8 hours of each other.<br>
[0097] The day the flies were moved to the test vials was designated "day 0", reflecting the emergence of the fly into adulthood. The flies were kept out of direct sunlight and were raised at a temperature of 21 °C. The food vials were prepared every 3 to 4 days and the flies transferred to prevent infestation of mites and other pathogenic microbial organisms. The vials with the flies were counted every day to determine the number of dead vs. living. Flies were scored as dead when they no longer respond to a gentle prodding with a probe. Lifespan is defined as the time elapsed from when the flies enter into adulthood (lifespan = 0) to when they are scored as dead. Flies that were lost due to transfer between food vials or were otherwise lost during the assay have been excluded from calculations. The dead flies were removed from the vials each day with microprobe. The total population is the sum of all found dead flies. The counting of the flies was continued until all flies were dead. The data was then charted and is represented in Figure 4.<br>
[0098] Data indicated an increase in average lifespan of 20% in the flies that lived on the oxaloacetate supplemented vials as opposed to the control group.<br>
Example 5<br>
[0099] The experiment in Example 4 was repeated, except that the food vials were not changed out every 3 to 4 days and 71 flies were supplemented with oxaloacetate and 70 flies were not. This resulted in infestations of microbial pathogens that attacked the flies, placing the flies under "stress". It is well known in the literature that calorie restricted animals survive stress better than the control animals fed an ad libitum diet. The data from the experiment were charted and are represented in Figure 5.<br>
[0100] Data indicated an increase of both average lifespan under stress, and a maximal increase in lifespan of 30%. The oxaloacetate supplemented group lived significantly longer, indicating an improved resistance to stress (also found in calorie restricted animals).<br>
Example 6<br>
[0102] C57B1/6 type male mice approximately 9 months of age were obtained from Harlan, San Diego, CA as retired breeders. These mice were all born on the same day. The C57B1/6 type mouse is inbred to reduce the genetic variation between individuals. The mice were housed in individual cages and were provided with ad libitum amounts of fortified food pellets (Kadee). The amount of food consumed was weighed daily, while the mice were weighed weekly. After two weeks, a baseline of the average food consumed by the mice was established at 7.1 grams per mouse per day. In addition, after an overnight fast, blood glucose readings for each mouse were recorded for each mouse. At the two-week point the mice were grouped into three equivalent groups (based on initial weight and fasting blood glucose measurements) of I) eight "Control Mice" fed ad libitum; II) eight "Calorie Restricted" mice, initially fed 20% less than the control group for two weeks, then increased to being fed 40% less than the control group, and 111) nine "oxaloacetate" supplemented mice that were fed an increasing dose of oxaloacetate in their food, but were allowed to eat freely.<br>
[0103] Male C57B1/6 type mice, when allowed to eat freely, gain weight with age in a linear fashion. The mice were weighed weekly for 21 weeks, and the individual weights were recorded and averaged to form a "group average" for each of the three groups. The incremental increase in weight between the "Control" group and the "Oxaloacetate" supplemented group was charted as represented by Fig. 6. The data indicates that control mice increase in weight in a linear fashion, whereas oxaloacetate supplementation decreases the amount of body weight that mice will gain when eating freely. The larger the amount of supplementation of oxaloacetate, the larger the reduction in weight gain in a dose dependent fashion. At 0.4% oxaloacetate in the food, the oxaloacetate mice gained 20% less weight than the control group, even though both groups were allowed to eat freely.<br>
[0104] The results of this experiment indicate that oxaloacetate supplementation can be used to reduce body weight in mammals.<br>
Example 7<br>
[0106] The experiment in Example 6 was repeated with one month old male mice (as compared to the nine month old mice used in Example 6). As in the previous Example 6, young C57B1/6 type mice grouped by weight into three groups, I) Control; II) Calorie Restricted; and<br>
Ill) Oxaloacetate supplemented. Instead of slowly increasing the dose of oxaloacetate, however, the mice were subjected to a concentration of 0.4% oxaloacetate from the start of the experiment, and calorie restricted mice were immediately placed on a 40% restricted diet. The mice were weighed weekly, and the results were plotted as represented by Fig. 7.<br>
[0107] Figure 7 shows that young mice also respond to oxaloacetate supplementation for reduced weight gain. Note that it took about three weeks for the effect of the oxaloacetate to fully be seen, after which point the weight differential remained constant due to the non-varying dosage.<br>
Example 8<br>
[0109] Three mice of each of the three groups of the C57B1/6 mice of Example 6 were sacrificed after 21 weeks. The liver of each animal was extracted and each set of three mice was pooled and analyzed for gene activity as described by Cao et al. The gene expression of the pooled mice group was shown to change in response to supplementation with oxaloacetate and in a similar fashion to mice under CR, as compared to the control group of mice. The CR mice showed a measurable change in the expression of 1,763 genes, while the oxaloacetate mice showed a measurable change in 765. Because each group was a pooling of three mice, there are a variety of individual responses. Changes in the physical results of the group (such as weight loss, increase in health span, and increase in life span) are due to genes expressed in common by the group, not in individual variation. Thus it is important to look at the genes that changed in expression from the control group, but are commonly expressed between the calorie restricted group and the oxaloacetate supplemented group. There were 363 genes expressed in common between the oxaloacetate group and the calorie restricted group that changed in genomic expression when compared to the control group. A directional analysis of these 363 common genes indicated that 98% of the changed genes expressed in common between the oxaloacetate group of mice and the calorie restricted group of mice moved in the same direction (upregulated or down-regulated) as compared to the control group of mice. Thus, the supplementation of oxaloacetate mimicked the same genomic change in mice as did mice under calorie restriction, for 98% of the genes in common that changed expression from the control group. The oxaloacetate mice, however, did not have to restrict their diets, but ate freely. The 98% similarity in change between the oxaloacetate fed mice and the calorie restricted mice also ties to the fact<br>
that the oxaloacetate supplemented mice did not gain as much weight as the control mice (Example 6 and 7 above) and also live longer and are healthier (Example 9 below). Oxaloacetate supplementation mimics the same critical genomic response as calorie restriction (See Fig. 8). Effective doses of oxaloacetate fed to C. elegans and D. melanogaster increase lifespan by 20 to 36%, and minimum increase in lifespan of mice by 10%.<br>
Example 9<br>
[0111] The C57B1/6 mice of Example 6 that were not sacrificed in Example 8 were continued to be fed as three separate groups, 1) Control, 2) Calorie Restricted and 3) Oxaloacetate supplemented (at a continuing dose of 0.4% in food by weight). It was noted that the Calorie Restricted group and the Oxaloacetate group was the healthiest group during the experiment, with a portion of the Control group being affected by inflammation characterized by intermittent bouts of itching and redness of the skin. The experiment is in continuation as this application for patent is filed, but initial indications are that the oxaloacetate group is living longer than the control group, and at least equal to the calorie restricted group.<br>
[0112] Lifespan data is represented by Fig 9, which at the 21st month in their lives, oxaloacetate supplementation increased lifespan of the group by a minimum of 10% (and still continuing) over the control group, and at least equal to (or better) than the calorie restricted group.<br>
Example 10<br>
[0113] An obese individual weighing approximately 200 kg is identified. 1,000 nig of oxaloacetate is administered orally for a period of 30 days, taken every other day. The individual does not restrict calories. A reduction of body fat and body weight is observed following treatment.<br>
Example 11<br>
[0114] Individuals presenting with age related disorders including heart disease and osteoporosis are identified. Half of the individuals are administered an effective dose of approximately 7 mg of oxaloacetate per kg of body weight, taken every other day over a period of 30 days or more. The other half of the individuals are administered a placebo. Individuals<br><br>
receiving oxaloacetate demonstrate a reduction in symptoms associated with aging including a decrease in fasting glucose levels, fasting insulin levels, triglycerides, Hs-CRP levels, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Additionally, a reduction in the risk for atherosclerosis is also observed as compared with the untreated individuals.<br>
Example 12<br>
[0115] Two groups of individuals are exposed to UV radiation from the sun. One group applies an 8mM concentration of oxaloacetate to the skin, while the control group does not. Both groups have their skin measured for unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS), to measure the relative rate of DNA repair. The group with oxaloacetate has a significant increase in UDS over the control group.<br>
Example 13<br>
[0116] Two groups of individuals are diagnosed with similar types of cancer tumors. One group ingests a dose of 2,000 mg of oxaloacetate per day, whereas the control group does not. The oxaloacetate reduces the amount of glucose available to the tumor, which limits the growth of the tumor in a fashion similar to that seen in calorie restriction. The control group sees no limitation in tumor growth.<br>
