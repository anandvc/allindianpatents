				<td>Preparation of Delmopinol<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of delmopinol, as well as<br>
to new intermediates useful in such a preparation process.<br>
Background Art<br>
Delmopinol is the International Non-proprietary Name (INN) of 3-(4-propylheptyl)-4-morpholinethanol with CAS No. 79874-76-3. Delmopinol hydrochloride salt (CAS No 98092-92-3) is intended to be used in the treatment of gingivitis.The structure of delmopinol hydrochloride corresponds to the formula:<br>
(Formula removed)<br>
Different processes for the preparation of delmopinol and its salts are known in the art. EP 038785-A describes several preparation processes of this compound. According to EP038785-A, delmopinol can be prepared by alkylation of a 3-substituted morpholine, by dialkylation of a primary amine with a substituted bis(haloethyl)ether or a substituted diethyleneglycol disulfonate, by reduction of a morpholone, or by transformation of the N-substituent of the morpholine into a hydroxyethyl group. EP 0426826-A describes a process for the preparation of delmopinol which comprises a cycloaddition of a morpholine nitrone to obtain a morpholine-isoxazolidine or morpholine-isoxazoline, a reductive ring opening followed by transformation of functional groups present in the side chain, and finally alkylation of the nitrogen to yield delmopinol.<br>
Despite the teaching of this prior art, research into new preparation processes of delmopinol is still an active field since the known processes are long and require the use of harsh hydrogenation conditions, some very toxic and/or flammable reagents or solvents which make their industrial exploitation difficult and expensive. Therefore, the provision of a new preparation process of delmopinol is highly desirable.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The inventors have found an efficient process forthe preparation of delmopinol, as well as its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or solvates, which avoids the use of harsh hydrogenation conditions and extremely toxic and flammable reagents and solvents.<br>
Thus, according to an aspect of the present invention, there is a process for the preparation of delmopinol of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or a solvate thereof, including a hydrate,<br>
(Formula removed)<br>
which comprises treating the compound of formula (II) either with a base in an appropriate solvent system, effecting both a deprotection of the amino ethanol and a cyclisation to yield the compound of formula (I) or, alternatively, treating the compound of formula (II) first with an acid in an appropriate solvent system at room temperature performing the deprotection of the amino ethanol, and then with a base effecting the cyclisation of the compound thus obtained to yield the compound of formula (I).<br>
(Formula removed)<br>
In the previous formula (II), R1 and R2 are a radical, same or different, independently selected from the group consisting of H, (C1-C6) alkyl or, alternatively, R1 and R2 form, together with the carbon atom to which they are attached, a (C5-C6) cycloalkyl radical; and R3 is a radical selected from the group consisting of CF3, (C1-C4) alkyl, phenyl, and phenyl mono- or disubstituted by a radical selected from the group consisting of (C1 C4)-alkyl, halogen, and nitro.<br><br>
The compound of formula (II) as defined above is previously prepared by reaction of a compound of formula (III) with a sulphonyl chloride of formula CI-S02-R3, where R1, R2, and R3 have the same meaning defined above for the compound of formula (II).<br>
(Formula removed)<br>
The compound of formula (III) is previously prepared by a process which comprises reacting a compound of formula (IV) where R1 and R2 have the meaning defined above, with a compound of formula (V) in the presence of a base, and recovering the compound of formula (III) obtained by treating the reaction mixture with a mixture of water and at least one water-immiscible solvent at approximately 0-5 Â°C, followed by separating the organic phase, which contains the product, from the aqueous phase. The compound of formula (III), where R1 is H and R2 is a radical selected from the group consisting of H and (C1-C6) alkyl, can also be recovered in two steps through the formation of the compound of formula (VI) by treating the reaction mixture with an acid in the presence of water, followed by basification to isolate a compound of formula (VI) in neutral form. Subsequently, compound (VI) is subjected to a protection reaction characterised in that said compound (VI) is reacted with an aldehyde of formula R4CHO wherein R4 is selected from the group consisting of H and (C1-C6) alkyl to yield a compound of formula (III) wherein R1 is H and R2 is a radical selected from the group consisting of H and (C1-C6) alkyl.<br>
(Formula removed)<br><br>
The compound of formula (V) is previously prepared by a process which comprises subjecting the compound of formula (VII) to an epoxidation reaction with an appropriate epoxidising agent.<br>
(Formula removed)<br><br>
The compound of formula (VII) is previously prepared by subjecting the compound of formula (VIII) to an elimination reaction in the presence of an alkali metal alkoxide.<br>
(Formula removed)<br>
Among the advantageous features of the processes of the present invention, the following can be mentioned: the process uses cheap and non-toxic starting materials, the reagents and solvents used are also of low toxicity, the process is carried out under mild reaction conditions, yields of every reaction step are high, several steps of the process can be carried out in one pot, and delmopinol is obtained with high purity.<br>
Compounds of formula (II), (III), (V), (VI), (VII) and (VIII) are new. Thus, another aspect of the present invention is the provision of said new intermediate compounds as defined above.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
As described above, delmopinol can be obtained by subjecting a compound of formula (II) as defined above to a deprotection and to a cyclisation reaction in an appropriate solvent system. In a preferred embodiment, the compound of formula (II) is that where R3 is methyl. Preferably, the solvent system is a mixture of a (C6-C8)-aromatic hydrocarbon and water. Examples of suitable hydrocarbons are toluene and xylene.<br>
The transformation can be carried out by treating the compound of formula (II) with a base preferably at a temperature between 50 Â°C and reflux temperature of the biphasic solvent system employed. Alternatively, the process can be accelerated by treatment of the compound of formula (II) with a dilute acid such as hydrochloric acid at room temperature, thereby effecting the deprotection of the amino ethanol, followed by reaction with a base at a temperature preferably between 50 Â°C and reflux temperature of the solvent system employed, thereby effecting the cyclisation. The base in both cases can be either an inorganic base or an organic base, for example sodium hydroxide or triethylamine.<br>
The most adequate conditions for carrying out said processes vary depending on the parameters considered by an expert in the art, such as, for example, the concentration of the reaction mixture, temperature, the solvent used, and the like. These can be readily determined by said skilled person in the art with routine tests and with the help of the teachings of the examples given in this description.<br>
Delmopinol obtained by the process of the present invention may be converted into pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and salts may be converted into the neutral form, by standard procedures described in the art. For instance, delmopinol can be converted into its hydrochloride salt by treating delmopinol with hydrochloric acid in an appropriate solvent. Suitable solvents to carry out the crystallisation of the salt obtained are, for instance, (C2 C10)-ethers such as methyl tert-butyl ether or di-n-butyl ether, (C6-C8)-aliphatic hydrocarbons such as heptane or hexane, aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene or xylene, and (C2 C10)-esters such as ethyl acetate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The compound of formula (II) can be previously prepared from the corresponding alcohol by reaction with a sulphonyl chloride of formula CI-S02-R3, where R3 has the<br>
same meaning as defined above. In a preferred embodiment, the sulfonyl chloride is that where R3 is -CH3, C6H4CH3, -C6H5 and -CF3. In a more preferred embodiment, R3 is methyl.<br>
Generally, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a tertiary amine in an appropriate inert solvent such as a (C6-C8)-aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene or xylene, or a chlorine-containing solvent such as methylene chloride or 1,2 dichloroethane, at a temperature between approximately 0 Â°C and room temperature. Preferably, the reaction is carried out at low temperatures.<br>
The preparation of the alcohol of formula (111) can be carried out by reacting a compound of formula (IV) as defined above with a compound of formula (V) in the presence of a base.<br>
(Formula removed)<br>
Preferably, the base is selected from the group consisting of an alkali metal alkoxide such as potassium tert-butoxide and an alkali metal hydride such as lithium hydride or sodium hydride. Generally, the reaction is carried out at a temperature between approximately 50 Â°C and 90 Â°C.<br>
Best results are obtained when the reaction is carried out using an excess of the compound of formula (IV). Preferably the molar ratio between (IV) and (V) is at least 4:1. More preferably, the molar ratio is at least 5:1 resulting in a yield of at least 90%.<br>
The compound of formula (III) obtained can be isolated by treating the reaction mixture with a mixture of water and at least one water-immiscible solvent such as toluene at 0-5 Â°C, followed by separating the organic phase containing the product from the aqueous phase.<br>
The compound of formula (III) where R1 is H and R2 is a radical selected from H and (C1-C6) alkyl can also be isolated from the compound of formula (VI). After the reaction between compound (IV) and (V), the reaction mixture is treated with an acid in the presence of water, followed by addition of a base, yielding a compound of formula (VI) which is isolated in neutral form.<br>
(Formula removed)<br>
After isolation, for instance by elimination of the solvent, compound (VI) is subjected to a protection reaction characterised in that said compound (VI) is reacted with an aldehyde of formula R4CHO where R4 is selected from H and (C1-C6)-alkyl. Preferably, the aldehyde is selected from formaldehyde and propionaldehyde.<br>
It is possible to carry out two or more of the steps of the process in one pot, as is illustrated in the Examples. Thus, the reaction between the compounds of formula (IV) and (V) to give the compound of formula (III), followed by the work-up based on the treatment of the reaction mixture with a mixture of water and at least one water-immiscible solvent at 0-5 Â°C, the subsequent conversion into the compound of formula (II) and the final formation of the compound of formula (I), can be carried out in one pot without isolation of any intermediate. Likewise, the conversion of the compound of formula (VI) into the compound of formula (III), the subsequent conversion into the compound of formula (II) and the final formation of the compound of formula (I) can also be performed in one pot, without isolation of any intermediate.<br>
The compound of formula (IV) can be prepared from diethanolamine by means of a protection reaction. The process comprises the reaction of diethanolamine with an aldehyde or a ketone. Examples of suitable aldehydes are formaldehyde and propionaldehyde. Exampes of suitable ketones are acetone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, methyl isobutylketone, and methyl ethylketone.<br>
The compound of formula (V) can be prepared by epoxidation of 6-propylnon-1-ene (Vll) with an epoxidising agent such as 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid or peroxyacetic acid. The compound of formula (Vll) is previously prepared by submitting the corresponding alky I bromide (VIII) to an elimination reaction in the presence of an alkali metal alkoxide, preferably potassium tert-butoxide. Said compound (VIII) is previously obtained by bromination of the corresponding alcohol (IX).<br>
(Formula removed)<br>
The bromination can be carried out with a brominating agent in the presence of a suitable solvent. It can also be carried out, for instance, with hydrobromic acid and sulfuric acid without any solvent, preferably at reflux temperature. The 6-propylnonan-1-ol (IX) is known and can be prepared as described in Examples from methods known in the art.<br>
