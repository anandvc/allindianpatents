This invention relates to a ring spinning machine which particularly relates to computer controlled ring spinning machines.<br>
The object of this invention is in developing an automatically controlled ring spinning machine for the production of uniform and better quality yarn. Computer controlling of ring spinning machines are known in the art. The improvement that constitutes the subject invention is in the field of computer controlled drafting drive system in combination with three dedicated AC servo motors for driving the front, middle and rear drafting rollers individually through a gear box. The middle and rear drafting rollers are connected to the fourth gear through constant velocity joints and the front drafting rollers are directly connected to the output shaft of the said fourth gear. Ring rail, anti baloon ring and thread grinder are driven by another AC servo meter and a gear box and the spindles of the system are driven by an inverter driven AC motor. All these motors are driven synchronously as desired by the respective drive systems through an interface circuit, intelligent display system (IDS) and PLC. Yarn count and spinning parameters are to be fed through the IDS which calculates the data and transforms it into a speed data matrix. This data matrix is used by the respective drive systems to set, control and monitor the performance of the respective motors.<br><br>
It is also possible to store spinning parameters in conventional disks to feed or key-in the desired count and feed count which makes the new system very user friendly. The servo motors also enable this system to be stopped in a controlled manner in the event of power failure, the four quadrant operation of the drives aided by the gear boxes preventing the reverse rotation of the delivery rollers after stopping. This is due to the residual forces in the drafting zone and helps in avoiding end breakage during stopping and restarting of spinning operations. The rear drafting roller has a conventional electromechanical means fixed thereto which may be activated to stop the drive to feed roving to the drafting zone. This helps in piecing of the ends of roving sidewise after periodic maintenance and cleaning operation.<br>
Constructional features of the machine will now be described in detail:<br>
Drafting drive system: This consists of three AC servo drives, three AC servo motors, gear boxes and an electromechanical means to stop the drive. There are four separate gear boxes, the first, the second and the third driving the front, the middle and the rear roller respectively. The fourth gear box transmits power to the right and left hand drafting rollers as well as to the roving condenser transverse mechanism.   The first three gear<br><br>
boxes are mounted on the fourth gear box. AC servo motors are mounted respectively on the first three gear boxes. All the four gear boxes are of the closed type. The first three gear boxes are grease lubricated while the fourth gear box is filled with oil to render maintenance free, reliable service. Since these gear boxes are modular in construction, servicing, maintenance and replacement are made easy, thereby reducing the machine down time considerably.<br>
Ring rail traverse motion is effected by a servo motor and a servo drive connected thereto. The servo motor transmits power to the ring rail drive through a power train consisting of a toothed belt arrangement. The output shaft of the servo motor has a conventional electromechanical means to keep the rail in position during power failure. Alternatively, the servo motor may be mounted on a gear box to transmit power to the ring rail drive through conventional toothed belt arrangement.<br>
Spindle drive system of this invention consists of an AC inverter drive, one AC motor and DC Tacho generator. The AC motor is preferably mounted on a base which is pivotably mounted on the frame in the end stock. The DC tacho generator and its drive system is mounted on the rear side of the AC motor. A flat belt driving system is provided for power transmission to the main drive shaft which in turn drives the four spindle belt drive system or the sectional tangential spindle drive system.  The<br><br>
/<br>
speed of the motor is controlled through infinite number of steps thus enabling higher productivity with lesser end breaks.<br>
The machine also has conventional intelligent display system IDS which is a computer and programmable logic circuits, power fail control system, inverters and the like, electrical and electronic components to control the AC motor. PLCs, IDS and the like accessories are also provided which are mounted in the panel near the end stock.<br>
Advantages of this invention are improved automation and centralised control, smooth and efficient operation resulting in higher productivity, controlling yarn quality and improved fault detection and control.<br>
The ring spinning machine according to this invention comprises a plurality of ring spinning stations associated with drafting and delivery rollers wherein the drafting drive of the said drafting rollers consists of at least three AC servo motors and servo drives, to drive the drafting rollers independently, a spindle drive of at least one AC motor and inverter drive, a drive for the ring rail, anti baloon ring and thread guide consisting of at least one AC servo motor associated with AC drive, the said drives being connected by means of interface circuits to intelligent display system and programmable logic circuits.<br><br>
The spinning system acording to this invention and its operation will now be described with reference to the single figure in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Before commencement of the operation, the intelligent display system must be fed with the necessary input like the yarn count to be produced, spinning parameters like twist, break draft, spindle speeds, feed count and winding lengths. The output data thus generated is used by the system to operate the ring spinning machine for the production of yarn spindle drive system consisting of AC motor 11 and inverter drive 10 on energisation drive the spindles as per the programme. AC servo drives 6, 7 and 8 command the respective AC servo motors 3, 4 and 5 to start driving the drafting rollers Rl, R2 and R3. Individual speeds of the front drafting roller Rl, middle drafting roller R2 and the rear drafting roller R3 are set and controlled by the drive system through the analog reference synchronisation signal 20 of the DC tacho generator which is shown by reference numeral 16. The speed of the drafting rollers, which decides the total draft and break draft is set electronically by the IDS represented by reference numeral 2.<br>
The figure shows the four intermediate circuits connecting the drive systems 6, 7, 8, 9, &amp; 10. The first connection is shown by 18 which establishes a serial communication.  The second<br><br>
circuit synchronises the analog signals 20 generated by the DC tacho generator 16 or from the spindle drive 10 and its drive motor 11. The third circuit is the DC bus connection 16 of all the drives 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 during power failure, intentional or unintentional power switching off. The fourth circuit 17 controls the drive systems 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 IDS and PLC through a rechargeable battery 13. The electro mechanical device or means for activating the disengagement of the drive to the drafting roller R3 is indicated by reference numeral 21.<br>
The drive system for ring rail, anti baloon ring and thread gauge are indicated by 9 and 12 and the respective gear box is shown by 15. Reference numerals 1 and 16a indicate PLCs which take care of the machine logics and controls the shape of the cop build up respectively. Mimic display system shown by reference letter M enables easier fault diagnosis.<br>
Though this invention has been described and illustrated with reference to a specific embodiment, it is not limited thereto and may be altered or modified in many ways known to persons skilled in the art without departing from the underlying concept of the invention described hereinabove and claimed in the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br>
