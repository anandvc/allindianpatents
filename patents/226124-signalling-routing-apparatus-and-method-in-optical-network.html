				<td>SIGNALING ROUTING APPARATUS AND METHOD IN OPTICAL NETWORK<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
	The present invention relates to the field of optical communication, in particular, to the<br>
apparatus and method of transmitting signaling in an optical network by using packet<br>
switched technology.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
	In the modern optical network (e.g. G.8080 standard), the transport network is divided into<br>
three independent planes, that is, transport plane, control plane and management plane. Also,<br>
there is a relatively independent signaling network in the network to provide signaling<br>
communication support, the signaling network defines a signaling transmission protocol for<br>
interworking, and is responsible for passing signaling information among the control planes<br>
of respective node devices in the optical network.<br>
	Typically, in the Optical Transport Network (OTN) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy/<br>
Synchronous Optical Network (SDH/SONET), an ECC channel is used to transport the<br>
signaling information between control planes and the network management information<br>
between network management planes.<br>
	In a Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) system, generally, an Optical<br>
Supervisory Channel (OSC) is used to transfer the communication control signaling. Each<br>
OSC channel uses one primary group, and each primary group is divided into 32 time slots.<br>
Within the 32 time slots of the primary group, several fixed time slots are assigned as Data<br>
Communication Channel (DCC), the communication control signaling is multiplexed to the<br>
Data Communication Channel (DCC) through time division multiplex, and the DWDM<br>
devices of other nodes in the DWDM network de-multiplex the communication control<br>
signaling information from the DCC, As the network structure and network element<br>
structure of the optical network becomes increasingly complex and the traffic carried on the<br>
1<br><br>
network increases rapidly, the capacity of the primary gronp is insufficient to meet the<br>
requirement, currently, there is provided a solution that the OSC channel will use<br>
SDH/SONET signal (for example, STM 1 signal).<br>
	In the DWDM system, the solution of transferring communication control signaling<br>
through OSC channel using the SDH/SONET signal also has an obvious shortcoming, which<br>
is as follows: a signating network matte up of SHH/SOKEX signal belongs to a synchronous<br>
network, while the DWDM network itself does not require the transmission of signaling to be<br>
synchronous, which will obviously increase the complexity of the network technology and the<br>
probability to failure; moreover, while a signaling network made up of SDH/SONET signal<br>
itself has relatively perfect protection mechanism, it needs to be provided a large amount of<br>
additional resource, which increase the complexity and cost of networking.<br>
	On the other hand, there is a variety of hardware environment that can. be used by a.<br>
signaling network, if the network underlying technology is defined very strictly, it is<br>
disadvantage for the interconnection and interworking of the signaling network. Therefore,<br>
ITU-T has suggested in G.7712 that the signaling network link support various interface<br>
implementations, including WAN interface, LAN interface and ECC interface, and support<br>
interworking of IP/OST network layer protocol at network layer.<br>
	This connectionless-orientated network has following features; a host can send a packet at<br>
anytime, and an intermediate node (or router) can forward the packet immediately. When<br>
sending the packet, the host does not know whether the network can forward that packet or<br>
whether the destination host can receive that packet. Each packet is independent of other<br>
packets, even if the destinations of these packets are the same, When a failure occurs at the<br>
intermediate node or link, it is possible to find an alternate path at the point of failure and<br>
correspondingly update the forwarding table.<br>
	The process to forward a data packet is as follows: the data packet is sent from a source<br>
host to a target host and may pass several routers on the way. Any node, whether it is a host<br>
or a router, first verifies if it is within a same physical network with the target host, Typically,<br>
2<br><br>
the network portion of the target address is compared with that of each local interface, if<br>
match, the data packet is transmitted directly. Otherwise, a router that is best or considered<br>
as nearest to the target is selected, then the selected next hop router queries the forwarding<br>
table with <network number next hop> and performs hop-by-hop forwarding. Generally, a<br>
default router can also beset, which can be used when all the records on the forwarding table<br>
do not match. This kind of IP route forwarding is a local route table based forwarding<br>
mechanism, the hop-by-hop forwarding can only form one route between a source terminal<br>
and a target terminal, and this kind of connectionless-orientated signaling transmission<br>
manner is not so reliable.<br>
	During the above-described packet forwarding, any one of the intermediate nodes can<br>
cause the data packet to be lost due to network's underlying failure or the overflow of process<br>
buffer etc., while this kind of lost event can only be found -ntan detection mechanism is added<br>
on higher network layer, this will take a relatively long time. Generally, a node relies on the<br>
'hello' shake-hands mechanism of the mite protocol to find the route failure, if confirmation<br>
time is added, it will take time in second level or even more time, Therefore, although this<br>
connectionless-orientated route/switch technology is flexible and easy to implement, it is hard<br>
to meet the reliability requirement of the transport network for signaling transmission,<br>
especially under the failure condition, the requirement to transport signaling fast and<br>
steadily.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
	The technical problem to be solved by the present inventioon is to provide an apparatus and<br>
method for routing signaling in an optical network, which can form a uniform optical<br>
network signaling control platform in the optical network, transmit the signaling more<br>
reliably and implement concurrent priority receiving of the signaling, improve the<br>
invulnerability of communication between network element devices of the network.<br>
	The main idea of the present invention is: building a uniform optical network signaling<br>
3<br><br>
control platform based on packet switched technology; generating an explicit route table in<br>
any control nodes, the signaling between respective control nodes in the network is<br>
transported in the form of packet switched data packet at network layer according to the<br>
explicit route table; producing a concurrent signaling data packet at source control node; and<br>
selecting a signaling data packet at destination control node.<br>
	The apparatus for routing signaling in an optical network of the invention comprises a<br>
signaling route maintaining unit, a sign a (ing packet switching unit and a control node<br>
interface; said signaling route maintaining unit is responsible for maintaining link state of the<br>
network monitoring the link, spreading network topology information and updating the<br>
network topology information, calculating explicit route to form an explicit route table, and<br>

unit is responsible for resolving the signaling data packet, looking up mapping relationship of<br>
the route port according to the explicit route, packet switching and forwarding the signaling<br>
data packet; said control node interface is responsible for producing concurrent data packets<br>
at source control node, sending them to said signaling route maintaining unit, priority<br>
selecting a data packet at destination control node and handing if over to the destination<br>
control node for processing.<br>
	An optical network comprises a transport plant, a control plant and a management plane,<br>
said transport plane comprises a plurality of network element devices and is used to provide<br>
unidirectional or bi-directional transportation of end-to-end user information; said control<br>
plane comprises a plurality of control nodes, said control nodes are configured to control<br>
signaling and routing of corresponding transport plane, perform operations of establishing<br>
and deleting connection, therein, said control node further comprises a signaling routing<br>
means therein, which provides transport channel of signaling for the control node and is<br>
configured to calculate explicit route and perform packet forwarding for the com munication<br>
signaling; the signaling routing means in said plurality of control nodes form a signaling<br>
control platform, the signaling between said control nodes is transported in the form of packet<br>
4<br><br>
switched data packet<br>
	in the method for routing signaling in an optical network of the invention, each control<br>
node of said optical network is provided with a signaling routing means which forms an<br>
independent signaling network, said method comprises the steps of;<br>
	step 1, obtaining state information of the link between control nodes and spreading it to<br>
each control node;<br>
	step 2, calculating at source control node at least two explicit routes with, minimum link<br>
dependency between any two of the control nodes;<br>
	step 3, packing the signaling information to be transported into at least two data packets<br>
simultaneously based on the explicit routes by the source control node and sending them out<br>
according to different routes;<br>

signaling control platform standard (G.7712 signaling communication network standard) of<br>
the current transport network, which facilitates in terror king of signaling network with<br>
different manufacture's devices at network layer; also, diversity route explicit route (source<br>
route) packet switching is employed to replace the former route table switching, which<br>
improves the invalnerability of network transportation. The present invention utilizes the<br>
technology of concurrent priority receiving of the data packets, improves the invalnerability<br>
5<br><br>
of the signaling to single point or limited multipoint (haven't influenced all the routes<br>
simultaneously) failure, saves the protection switching time of the signaling and ensures the<br>
performance of Mesh netwark protection and restoration switching. When the topology of the<br>
signaling network has changed, the backup route can still ensure that the signling packet be<br>
transmitted steadily, which has prevented from relying on real-time dynamical routing<br>
algorithm (for example, OSPF,BGP, 1S-IS) to solve backup route, thereby solves the problem<br>
that the convergence is slow. The improved diversity route selecting algorithm employed by<br>
the invention can rapidly obtain multiple explicit routes with minimam link dependency,<br>
which conveniently realizes the obtaing of the explicit route.When a connection failure is<br>
found, after self-healing the topatogy, the sigualing network, can re-select a route at<br>
background to replace the corrupted route, which dynamically realizes the backup of the<br>
route. The apparatus for routing signaling or the invention only needs to add features of<br>
source calculation, multiple explicit routes and explicit route forwarding that conforms to IP<br>
routing standard on the original router protocol, which dose not affect forwarding feature of<br>
the traditional router. The traditional router only needs to support explicit route forwarding<br>
according to the IP routing standard specification, it is easy to connect the apparatus for<br>
routing signaling of the invention to an IP/OSI signaling network that is formed by<br>
conventional routers, the source and destination control nodes only need to function as a<br>
border node and the node of conventional routers just perform transparent forwarding<br>
directly. The present invention is also applicable to other data communication network that<br>
has highly reliable requirement to signaling transmission.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
	Next, the technical solution of the invention will be described in further detail in<br>
conjunction with accompany drawings and embodiments.<br>
	The core idea of the invention is to transmit signaling in the form of packet switched data<br>
packet (may include, but not limited to, an IP packet) between network element devices in an<br>
optical network system, a signaling routing means is set in the control node of each network<br>
element device as a control platform for communication signaling, the signaling routing<br>
means calculates explicit route of the communication signaling and performs packet<br>
forwarding. unlike typical router's route table forwarding, the route forwarding realized by<br>
the invention determines the forwarding port by relying on source node calculation and the<br>
explicit route carried in the data packet.<br>
	The signaling routing means of the invention is shown in Fig 1, it includes a signaling route<br>
maintaining unit a signaling packet switching unit and a control node interface. The<br>
signating route maintaining unit includes a link state monitoring and spreading module, a<br>
network topology repository, an explicit route calculating module and an explicit route table.<br>
Wherein the link state monitoring and spreading module is responsible for maintaining the<br>
link state of the network, monitoring network link, spreading network topology information,<br>
updating network topology and writing the network topology iota the network topology<br>
repository; the explicit route calculating module calculates explicit route and writes the<br>
calculated route result into the explicit route table, the module can utilize various link state<br>
protocols, OSPF link state- protocol is used in the present embodiment. The signaling packet<br>
switching unit includes an explicit route forwarding module and a route port mapping table,<br>
7<br><br>
the explicit route forwarding module is responsible for resolving route of a signaling data<br>
packet, looking up route port mapping table and forwarding the signaling deta packet. The<br>
control node interface, as an interface to the cintrol nodes, is responsible for producing a set<br>
of concurrent signaling data packets at source control node, selecting a signaling data packet<br>
based an the receiving condition aat the destination end and handing it in the control node<br>
service side for processing<br>
	When a control node needs to send a signaling, it generates signaling data and request via<br>
the control node interface and sends them to the signaling route maintaining unit, the<br>
signaling route maintaining unit takes out destination explicit route that needs, to be<br>
transmitted from the explicit route table, packs the signaling data as an IP data packet and<br>
hands it to the signaling packet switching unit to perform forwarding. The signaling packet<br>
switching unit extracts a local next hop address from the explicit route table, then queries the<br>
corresponding output port and sends out the data packet. When the signaling packet<br>
switching unit of the next hop receives the data packet, it continues in extract next hop<br>
address, then queries the corresponding output part and sends out the data packet, until the<br>
signaling packet switching unit of a subsequent next hop finds that the destination address in<br>
a local address, then the data packet is handed over to the local control node interface to<br>
perform priority receiving and is handed to the control node for processing.<br>
	The signaling routing means are set in the control node of each network element device in<br>
be optical network system and form a uniform signaling control platform to calculate explicit<br>
oute for the communication signaling and perform packet forwarding.<br>
	Fig 2 is a diagram of an optical network that is formed by using the means showa in Fig 1,<br>
(wherein the transport plane (transport network) is separated from the control plane<br>
(signaling network), the transport plane consists 3 network element devices, and the control<br>
plane includes control nodes A, B, C, B, E, F, I, J and Z, the network element device 1<br>
corresponds to control node A, the network element device 2 corresponds to control node C,<br>
and the network dement device 3 corresponds to control node Z. The transport plane of the<br>
8<br><br>
network element device can be various Optical Transport Network (OTN) or SDH transport<br>
device. Each control node contains therein the signaling routing means shown in Fig 1 to<br>
realize the signaling routing function of the control plane; other fuactionsl; modales will<br>
process signaling functions at control plane service level. The signaling routing means of each<br>
control node form the signaling transmitting portion of the control node of the optical<br>
network. The signaling data packets between control nodes are forwarded between control<br>
nodes of the network element devices via the signaling routing means.<br>
	The flowchart of realizing transportation of signaling in the form of data packet in the<br>
optical network shown in Fig 2 is shown in Fig 3. Firstly, route topology information needs to<br>
be obtained. Each control node is provided with a. signaling routing means therein, and is<br>
configured with a unique communication address of the signaling network, thus, an<br>
independent packet switched signaling network is built in the entire optical network. The list<br>
of control node and adjacent control node (including link overhead between nodes) is<br>
configured through an interface (may include, but not limited to, a command line interface, a<br>
simple graphical interface), or can be configured by using the auto-discovering feature. Then,<br>
the above link state information is spread to each control node in the network; by using the<br>
link state protocol so that each control node can built a full signaling network image, i.e.,<br>
network topology.<br>
	Then, the source control node calculates the explicit route between itself any one of the<br>
control nodes and saves it in the source control node, such that each control node can function<br>
is a potential source control node to calculate and preserve the explicit route. In order to<br>
improve the invalnerability of the network it is needed in the indention to calculate at least<br>
wo routes with minimum link dependency between any two of the control nodes, and there<br>
should be as least as possible overlapping intermediate nodes and links between each route,<br>
The obtained explicit route is calculated to form an explicit route table and saves it in the<br>
source control mode; the explicit route table records at least two routes with minimum link<br>
dependency between any node and each other node in the network. The format of an ordinary<br>
9<br><br>
route table generally is <destination overhead next hop point> and the table is recorded in<br>
each forwarding node; while the format of an explicit route table generally is <source next></source>
hop point, next hop point, ..., destination, overheads&gt; and the table only needs to be recorded<br>
in the source control node. For an explicit route table between same source and destination<br>
nodes, the next hop point therein should, to the extent possible, not overlap, so as to ensure<br>
that the link dependency of the route is the lowest,<br>
	A diversity route algorithm or a route algorithm with constraint can be employed to<br>
calculate explicit route. The present invention has presented an improved Dijkstra algorithm,<br>
as shown in Fig 4. Each source control node that has signaling to send uses a search forward<br>
Dikstra algorithm or other constrained route algorithms, and calculate explicit route from<br>
the network topology collected from the Link State Packet (LSP) gathered by that control<br>
node, two tables are involved in the calculation: a probation table and a verification table. the<br>
former records the candidate paths and overheads during, calculating the shortest path, the<br>
latter records the verified shortest path and overhead from the current source to one next bop<br>
node. Each table has a plurality of route records therein, the format of which is next hop<br>
point, ...destination, overhead&gt;, two explicit routes are obtained by performing search and<br>
calctitatios twice, when local node is a source control node, the final verification table just<br>
records therein the routiag addresses of all the control nodes that have been passed between<br>
the source and the potential destination control node, Specifically, the steps are: a source<br>
control node initializes the verification table, wherein the link overhead is 0. The node that<br>
has been newly added into the verification table is called a Next node, the Link State Packet<br>
(LSP) of the source control node is examined. The total overhead from the source cantrol<br>
node to the Next node and from the Next node to the adjacent nodes is calculated. Then, it is<br>
determined whether the adjacent node are in the probation table, if so, then it is further<br>
determined whether the above overhead is lower than the current record in the probation<br>
table, if Yes, then the current record is replaced by the record <next hop point... adjacent></next>
nodes, overhead&gt;, if the overhead is not less than the current record, then the current record<br>
10<br><br>
is preserved and the new record is discarded. If the adjacent nodes are not in the probation<br>
table, then the record <next hop point... adjacent nodes overhead> is add£d into the<br>
probation table, note that at this time, every record contains all the nodes that have been<br>
passed. At this time, it is determined whether the probation table is empty, if not, then the<br>
record with least overhead in the probation table is selected and moved into the verification<br>
table, then returns (loops) to continue to examine the Link State Packet (LSP); if the<br>
probation table is empty, then the full route from the source control node to tbe destination<br>
control node is outpuputed. As this time, it is determined whether all the routes have been<br>
calculated, if so, the process to calculate explicit route is ended, if not, the overhead of link<br>
between the control nodes that have been selected is increased, then tbe source control node<br>
re-initializes the verification table, calculates the corresponding second route until all the<br>
second routes have been obtained. It should be pointed out that if the intermediate control<br>
node just performs forwarding, it will not be taken as a potential soure node, so the<br>
caculation of the above two routes may not be performed.<br>
	After obtaining the explicit route table the source control node performs concurrens<br>
sending of signaling data packets. The signaling routing means in the source control node<br>
packs the signaling information to be transferred into data packet, generates two data packets<br>
that have same signaling content but have different header content, the header contains<br>
therein different explicit routes, the data field of which has different identifier (ID), the<br>
identifier (ID) is denoted as (X, YI) and (X, Y2), wherein X represents the sequence number<br>
of the data packet, in may be a serial number; Yl, Y2 represents the first and second portion<br>
of a same data packet X. The packed signaling information is sent out according to different<br>
explicit routes.<br>
	After the signaling routing means in the intermediate control node receives the signaling<br>
data packet, it performs switching and forwarding based on the explicit route carried by the<br>
header of the data packet. Each output port of each control node has a number, the explicit<br>
route and the output port of the device are mapped to each other, XXX, the corresponding<br>
11<br><br>
output port can be looked up according to the explicit route carried by the data packet, then<br>
the data packet is forwarded to the corresponding output port.<br>
	Specifically, the process to forward the data packet is: the header address field of the<br>
signaling data packet carries therewith the explicit route calculated by the source control<br>
node, begin from the source control node, the signaling routing means or each control node<br>
that: has received a data packet queries the explicit route of the header of the data packet. If<br>
what is indicated by the current address is not a destination address, i.e., the current control<br>
node is not a destination control node, then it is mapped to a corresponding output port based<br>
on the address of the next hop point indicated in the explicit route and sends the data packet<br>
out, at the same time, the address of the next hop point that indicates the current control node<br>
is moved by one pointer position, the pointer is set in one field of the header. Since there may<br>
be several hops of control nodes to perform forwarding in the path from the source control<br>
node to the destination control node, the header of the data packet needs to contain sufficient<br>
explicit route information, so that each control node in the path can determine output port for<br>
for-warding based on the explicit route information.<br>
	After forwarded by the intermediate control nodes, the signaling data packet arrives the<br>
destination control node. When the signaling routing means of the destination control node<br>
receives the data packet, it selects a data packet in accordance with a predefined policy based<br>
on the identifier (ID) carried by that data packet, the policy can be a policy which selects data<br>
packet with good quality, for example, do not have error code, or can be a policy which selects<br>
data packet that arrives first based on the sequence of arrival, then discards the duplicated<br>
data packet Thus, even if a failure occurs on the node or link that has been passed by any one<br>
of (he two routes, or the data packet is lost due to buffer overflow, the transmission of<br>
signaling will Dot be affected.<br>
	Next, the network shown in Fig 2 is taken as an embodiment to describe the present<br>
invention in detail, the data packet of the signaling data takes the form of an IP packet. The<br>
signaling routing means in respective control nodes of the network spreads the state of the<br>
12<br><br>
links between respective nodes into all the signalmg routing means in the network by using<br>
the OSPF routing protocol based on the neighbor relationship between point-to-point<br>
configured by the network administrator, and automatically generates the topolegy diagram<br>
of the signaling network of the control plane. When a physical connection needs to be<br>
established between network element device 1 and network dement device 3, first a<br>
cannection needs to be established between network element device 1 and network element<br>
divece 2. As shown, network element device 1 corresponds to control node A, and network<br>
element device 2 corresponds to control node C, Before transmission of signaling is performed<br>
between control node A and cantrol node C for the first time, two explicit routes with<br>
minimum link dependency from control node A to control node C need to be calculated first.<br>
A diversity route selecting algorithm or a constraint routing algorithm may be employed to<br>
calculate two link independent source routes: A-B-C and A-D-E-C, and they will be recorded.<br>
	Currently, there are many diversity route algorithms and constraint routing algorithms<br>
and they cap be selected according to optimization purposes. An improved Dijkstra algorithm<br>
as shown in Fig 4 can also be employed to calculate the esiplicit rente. As shown in Fig 5, first,<br>
the connection overhead of all the control nodes are set to 1, then a path A-E-C with least<br>
number of hops can be easily obtained by using the improved Dijkstra algorithm. Then the<br>
connection overhead of the nodes that have been selected is set to a larger number (such as 5)<br>
and the improved Dijkstra algorithm is performed again to obtain another path A-D-E-C that<br>
has minimum link dependency with the foregoing path. Essentially, to select path A-F-I-C is<br>
the same as to select path A-D-E-C, here only the case in which path A-D-E-C is selected will<br>
be discussed. In the invention, the connecticm overhead of the nodes that have been used is set<br>
o a larger value (rather than deleting them), the advantage is that in case a path that is fully<br>
link independent could not be found, partial route overlap is permitted. This case is shown in<br>
Fig 6, under certain special network topology conditions, such as the BC' segment is<br>
overlapping, to avoid a failure occurs when search, is performed by tbe algorithm, A-F-I-B-C<br>
can be selected as another route based on link overhead change instead of deleting the<br>
13<br><br>
segment, of course this is a tradeoff made due to the signaling network topology is limited.<br>
	After obtaining the explicit route, source control node A generates two IP data packets that<br>
have same signaling content, and adds two related identifiers (X, Y1) and (X, Y2) into the data<br>
field of the header respectively, wherein X represents the sequence number of the data packet,<br>
it may take the form of a serial number; number 1, 2 represents the first and second portion<br>
of a same data packet X. The explicit routes carried by the IP header are A-B-C and A-D-E-C,<br>
respectively. The signaling routing means of control node A finds the corresponding output<br>
port based on the explicit routes and sends the IP data packet to control node B and control<br>
node D, respectively. In order to facilitate the next node to obtain correct information, control<br>
node A shifts the pointer indication of the explicit routes and obtains explicit routes B-C-A<br>
and D-E-C-A respectively and they are sent along with the IP data packet to control node B<br>
end control node D, respectively. When control node B and control node D have received the<br>
data packet, alter looking up the corresponding output port based on the explicit routes, they<br>
shift the explicit routes again to obtain C-A-B and E-C-A-D respectively, which in turn are<br>
forwarded with the IP data packet to the next control node C and control node E respectively,<br>
until each arrives destination control node C, now the Explicit routes have completed a full<br>
loop shift.<br>
	Under normal condition, after passing different explicit routes the two IP signaling packets<br>
sent by control node A will each arrives destination control node C normally. The destination<br>
control node C performs priority selecting on the IP signaling packets, in the present<br>
imbodiment, the priority selecting policy is to select the IP signaling packet that cones first,<br>
the signaling routing means in the destination control node C resolves the received IP<br>
nignaling packet, forwards the signaling to other service processing modules to be processed<br>
by them, and preserves the identifier (ID) of the IP data packet or a copy of it . When the<br>
lecond portion if signaling data packt with same conteat asrives,after cofirming that the <br>
rignaling content is the same (by comparing the identifier or the copy), that signaling data<br>
 packet and the preserved identifier (ID) of tbe IP data packet or the copy are discarded.<br>
14<br><br>
	According to the shove method, it a failure occurs on route A-B-C, the signaling data<br>
packet transferred on route A-D-E-C will not be affected, Similarly, A failure on route A-B-E-<br>
C will not affect the transmission of signaling data on route A-B-C. For the explicit route<br>
between control node A and control node C, two explicit routes are calculated in the present<br>
embodiment, in practice, based on actual needs, more than two signaling routes with<br>
minimum link dependency can be used to perform forwarding, the processing mechanism of<br>
which is the same as that of the above two explicit routes.<br>
	The OSPF routing protocol has certain network self-healing feature, and can re-modify the<br>
transmission reliability of signaling between control nodes based on real time state of the<br>
network. If a failure occurs at control node B on route A-B-C, and the failure is not<br>
eliminated in certain time (for example, the network self-healing time of the OSPF protocol<br>
typically is 60 seconds), then the source control node calculates the explicit route again by<br>
using diversity route algorithm based on the refreshed, network topology, at this time, route<br>
A-F-I-C can be reselected is another new second route.<br>
	The process to establish a connection between network eltmtnt device 2 and network<br>
element device 3 is simitar to the above process of establishing a eonneting bttween network<br>
element device 1 and network element device 2, two explicit routes C-Z and C-J-X are<br>
obtained between control node C and control node Z corresponded to network element device<br>
2 and network element device 3 to perform transmission and forwarding of signaling.<br>
	Finally, it should be noted that the above embodiments are merely to illustrate the technical<br>
solution of the present invention and are not intended to limit the invention. Although the<br>
present invention has been described the detail with reference to preferred embodiments, those<br>
ordinary skilled in the art should appreciate that modification or equivalent substitution can<br>
