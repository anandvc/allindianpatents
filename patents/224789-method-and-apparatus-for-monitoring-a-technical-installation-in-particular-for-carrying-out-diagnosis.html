				<td>Description<br>
The invention relates to a method respectively apparatus for<br>
monitoring a technical installation.<br>
In industrial plants, especially in power plants, condition<br>
monitoring of main systems (e.g. turbines and/or generators)<br>
sub-systems (e.g. water-steam-cycle) and components (e.g.<br>
pumps, motors, drives, valves, pipes, bearings etc.) of the<br>
plants is essential to guarantee reliable operation. Condi-<br>
tion monitoring often includes a quasi non-stop acquisition<br>
and storing of data relevant for the operation of the plant.<br>
In order to adjust operation parameters during operation of<br>
the plant, schedule maintenance and repair work, and to mini-<br>
mize safety risks, accurate data about the condition of nu-<br>
merous plant assets must be gathered and analyzed. The nature<br>
of a.m. data needed is manifold and the impact of said data<br>
on actual plant failures is often hard to determine.<br>
Typical examples of condition monitoring data are vibration<br>
data (e.g. of turbines or pumps, often acquired by vibration<br>
sensors and analyzed by a specialized evaluation device using<br>
spectrum analysis or the like), temperature and/or pressure<br>
data (e.g. of boilers, acquired inside the boiler via sensors<br>
or calculated indirectly using related data), volume data<br>
(e.g. throughput of a pipeline) and so on.<br>
There are technical means, e.g. sensors, to collect most of<br>
the desired data. However, for a complete and reliable pic-<br>
ture of a plant's actual condition, the amount of data needed<br>
is enormous.<br>
This is a problem both in terms of installation costs of sen-<br>
sors, and in terms of efforts to analyze the resulting sensor<br>
data.<br>
As a consequence, the majority of plant owners cannot afford<br>
an all-embracing monitoring of all plant assets.<br>
Therefore, unscheduled drop outs of production are inevita-<br>
ble, often resulting in a loss of income and/or high penal-<br>
ties.<br>
Known methods of monitoring the condition of industrial<br>
plants may include:<br>
• Collecting data and reporting related values, e.g. on-line<br>
or off-line statuses, using sensors attached to the compo-<br>
nents to be monitored; said sensors may include vibration<br>
sensors for rotating machinery (e.g. generators, turbines)<br>
and/or thermography (e.g. temperature) sensors for boil-<br>
ers.<br>
If a component is being monitored on-line, sensors are usu-<br>
ally connected to an evaluation system, which analyzes the<br>
data and prompts appropriate messages related to its condi-<br>
tion to the operator, e.g. on a computer screen or large<br>
screen display.<br>
Off-line sensors do not necessarily need to be connected to<br>
an evaluation system; data can be collected on demand, e.g.<br>
using a portable computer.<br>
Any kind of known methods of sensor based monitoring are usu-<br>
ally extremely costly.<br>
Not only the actual technical equipment needed, but also the<br>
appropriate commissioning and adjusting of the sensors to the<br>
specific needs and environmental conditions, take more ef-<br>
forts and financial investments than typical plant owners are<br>
able or willing to spend.<br>
And/or<br>
• Inspecting machinery by frequent walks across the plant.<br>
Specialist engineers may inspect machinery by a.m. frequent<br>
"walk downs".<br>
The main "sensor" used for inspection here is human percep-<br>
tion.<br>
Due to their knowledge and experience, these engineers ar.e<br>
able to detect a broad range of failures.<br>
However, symptoms of many failures simply cannot be sensed<br>
without technical aids.<br>
For example, bearings, which start becoming faulty, can<br>
only rarely by detected solely by human perception, or the<br>
unwanted change of magnetic flux in a pump cannot at all be<br>
noticed by man.<br>
Furthermore, long term changes of a machine's characteris-<br>
tic occurring in the course of time are very hard to real-<br>
ize since there no direct comparison available with a regu-<br>
lar operation mode.<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to provide an im-<br>
proved and affordable method respectively apparatus for moni-<br>
toring a technical installation, especially for carrying out<br>
diagnosis.<br>
A method according to the invention comprises acquiring at<br>
least one acoustical and/or optical signal assigned to at<br>
least one specific failure of at least one component of the<br>
technical installation, whereby said acoustical and/or opti-<br>
cal signal is being produced by a device assigned to said<br>
component and said device is being activated mechanically in<br>
case of occurrence of said failure.<br>
An apparatus according to the invention comprises at least<br>
one device assigned to at least one component of the techni-<br>
cal installation for producing an acoustical and/or optical<br>
signal characteristic for at least one specific failure of<br>
said component, whereby said device is activated mechanically<br>
in case of occurrence of said failure.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention are laid down in sev-<br>
eral dependant claims.<br>
Any embodiment of the invention may include, but will not be<br>
limited to, one or more of the following features.<br>
Sub-systems / machinery components are designed in such a way<br>
that they indicate faults acoustically and/or optically.<br>
Instead of attaching sensors to machinery which display meas-<br>
ured data on a screen or on legacy computer systems, machin-<br>
ery or components thereof are designed in such a way that<br>
faults can clearly be identified by characteristic sounds<br>
(acoustical signal) and/or that a machine's components are<br>
designed in such a way that they change their outer appear-<br>
ance (optical signal), e.g. with regard to their coating<br>
color, when a fault occurs.<br>
Especially the acoustical and/or optical signal is directly<br>
activated by the respective failure; e.g. any type of fault<br>
may cause a unique sound ("groan"), i.e. the sound's fre-<br>
quency and/or its volume allow identifying the kind of fault<br>
without ambiguity ("groaning machinery").<br>
The sounds should be identifiable by personnel without tech-<br>
nical aids such as vibration monitoring devices or sound<br>
analysis systems.<br>
Alternatively or in combination therewith each type of fault<br>
may cause an optical signal assigned to said failure.<br>
This enables a person carrying out a walk across the plant to<br>
detect also faults which normally would be not be sensible by<br>
human perception.<br>
A monitoring method and/or apparatus according to the inven-<br>
tion does not require costly additional sensors since machin-<br>
ery or components thereof by mechanical design make faults<br>
obvious for plant personnel by producing characteristic<br>
sounds and/or optical signals perceivable by human senses.<br>
Therefore, walks across the plant are much more effective and<br>
give a more comprehensive image of a plant's condition with-<br>
out a need for extensive technical diagnosis equipment; with-<br>
out plant-wide sensor installations, plant operators may re-<br>
ceive all information for making operational and maintenance<br>
decisions.<br>
Examples of plant components designed to be used according to<br>
the invention:<br>
• Rotating machinery, such as pumps or fans, are designed in<br>
such a way that faults in their bearings lead to charac-<br>
teristic noises.<br>
This can be achieved by designing the casing in such a way<br>
that faulty bearings result in resonance effects.<br>
Faults in different bearings may result in different reso-<br>
nance frequencies easily detectable and distinguishable by<br>
human ears.<br>
Such resonance effects can be made perceivable for example<br>
by attaching plates to the casing which vibrate according<br>
to body resonance of the casing.<br>
• Supports of pipelines are often designed to adjust flexibly<br>
when the pipeline expands due to a change of its tempera-<br>
ture.<br>
Abnormal temperature changes lead to abnormal adjustment of<br>
the support. A characteristic squeaking of the support<br>
would make such abnormal temperature changes audible to<br>
plant personnel.<br>
• Electrical machinery produce well defined electric-<br>
magnetic flux.<br>
A flux sensitive coating may change color when the flux<br>
differs from the expected flux. Such discrepancies indi-<br>
cate the type of fault inside the machine, i.e. faulty ro-<br>
tors in electrical engines.<br>
• Temperature sensitive coatings may change their color and<br>
thus reflect discrepancies from normal temperatures of ma-<br>
chinery.<br>
An abnormal local temperature in a specific area on a ma-<br>
chine's surface may thus give hints to the type and loca-<br>
tion of a fault.<br>
For example, local temperature discrepancies in a rotating<br>
machine can indicate a faulty bearing.<br>
• Vessels containing a liquid of noticeable color can be at-<br>
tached to components of a technical installation.<br>
A vessel, its location and way of attachment are designed<br>
in such a way that the vessel breaks when the machinery or<br>
a particular component thereof suffer excessive strain,<br>
for example due to vibration or excessive pressure.<br>
The liquid leaking from the vessel and spilling over at<br>
least part of the machine is an optical indication for the<br>
(excessive) strain the respective component is or was ex-<br>
posed to.<br>
The advantages of the invention compared to sensor based con-<br>
dition monitoring include cost saving and data reduction.<br>
Machinery designed to indicate faults acoustically and/or op-<br>
tically do not require additional sensors to monitor their<br>
status.<br>
Since only faults are reported, e.g. by personnel walking<br>
across the plant, and no data are reported on machinery com-<br>
ponents which works faultlessly, the amount of data to be .<br>
processed in evaluation and analysis systems is reduced.<br>
The following figures show preferred embodiments of the in-<br>
vention .<br>
FIG 1 shows an apparatus according to the invention.<br>
A pump 5 is designed to indicate a faulty pump bearing 7<br>
acoustically.<br>
Therefore, a plate 9 is fixed at a casing 11 of the pump 5 in<br>
such a way, that it can vibrate when activated at its reso-<br>
nance frequency, and cause a characteristic noise by hitting<br>
e.g. a metal stub 13 on the casing 11.<br>
The plate 9 is designed in such a way that it has the same<br>
body resonance frequency as the vibration frequency caused by<br>
the bearing 7 getting faulty.<br>
Hence, the faulty bearing 7 causes the plate 9 to vibrate and.<br>
thus produce a noise characteristic for the faulty bearing 7.<br>
The plate 9 may also be designed to produce a musical note in<br>
a special tune when being activated at its resonance fre-<br>
quency by the faulty bearing 7. Concerning that embodiment,<br>
the stub 13 may be omitted as the characteristic noise is the<br>
vibration of the plate 9 itself.<br>
If there are a number of bearings in a plant, the respective<br>
plates may be designed to produce different musical notes so<br>
that the plant's personnel can tell by the frequency of the<br>
note which bearing is faulty.<br>
FIG 2 and 3 show a vessel 15, filled with liquid 17, which is<br>
fixed on a steel construction 19 by three fixations 21 (see<br>
FIG 2) .<br>
 When the steel construction 19 suffers excessive stress, e.g.<br>
by putting a weight 23 on top, the vessel 15 breaks and the<br>
liquid 17 inside the vessel 15 spills and thus gives indica-<br>
tion for the excessive stress the steel construction 19 has<br>
suffered (see FIG 3).<br>
Using vessels 15 filled with liquids 17 of different colors,<br>
which are be designed to break at different stress limits,<br>
may give the operating and maintenance personnel of the plant<br>
a quick and comprehensive overview which component of the<br>
plant has suffered excessive stress and/or the strength of<br>
the respective stress burden.<br>
The invention in general may be summarized as follows:<br>
