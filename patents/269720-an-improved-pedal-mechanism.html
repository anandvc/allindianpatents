				<td>Specification<br>
“Easy pedaling of bicycle”<br><br>
	The prevailing pedaling system of a bicycle comprises of two pedals, two cranks and one centre axle. In this system two cranks are fixed to both sides of a centre axle. These cranks are fixed at angle 1800 to each other i.e. these  are mutually fixed in the opposite direction. To other side of each of these two cranks a pedal is fixed. For cycling, a cyclist applies his force upon these pedals to rotate the centre axle around centre 0. With the help of chain and free wheel,the rotating centre axle further rotates the rear wheel of a bicycle. This rotating rear wheel completes the process of cycling and the bicycle moves forward.<br>
	In the figure-1 the revolution path of the pedals is shown as “path ABCDEFGH”. This revolution path can further be divided into two parts-<br>
(i)	Main part” ABC, in which a cyclist applies his power for cycling mostly from point ‘A’ to the point ‘C’.<br>
(ii)	Remaining part’ CDEFGHA, in which a cyclist can apply a slight force at the time of cycling.<br>
At the time of cycling, a cyclist consumer most of his energy for pedaling in the ‘main part’ ABC. For pedaling, the ‘remaining part’ demands very slight energy from the cyclist. So the energy need for pedaling in the ‘main part’ is much bigger than the same in the in the ‘remaining part’ of the revolution path. In the prevailing bicycly the difference of energy need for pedaling between both the above parth of revolution path ABCDEFGH is very great.<br>
	The abstract of this invention to save the energy of a cyclist by minimizing the difference of energy need in both the above parts of the revolution path of pedals.<br>
Suppose ‘energy need’ for moving the pedal (any of the pedal) from point ‘A’ to ‘C’ us E unit and the value of ‘energy need’ for moving this pedal in the ‘remaining part’ (C to A) is E units. This means the energy consumption of a cyclist from A to C is E and from C to A is E in the revolution path ‘ABCDEFGH’.<br>
	After making necessary change in the prevailing pedaling system of bicycle if the energy consumption for moving the pedal from A to C is decreased in the quantity ‘P’ than a cyclist will consumer his (E-P) energy in  part ‘ABC’ (main part) and the will consume (E’+P) energy in the ‘remaining part’ CDEFGH for a full revolution of any pedal. As compared to E the value of E is very small so (E’+P) will also be a very small quantity. “The energy consumption for pedaling in  the ‘main part’ ABC is inversely proportional to the value of mutual angle between the cranks.”<br>
	As the cranks are fixed on both sides of the centre axle so this change of angle between the cranks can be done by changing the shape of a centre axle of bicycle at the time of manufacturing  in the factory.<br>
Change in the shape of centre axle :	In the figure-8 U, and U2 are the U shaped part of a cylindrical centre axle of a bicycle. Both the cranks are fixed on these U shaped part U, and U2 are in opposite directions, so the cranks fixed on these parts are also in   opposite direction to each other. The angle between the crankes can be changed by changing the angle between the plain surfaces of U, and U2  parts [8(a) and 8(b)].<br><br><br><br><br><br>
CLAIM-I claim that,<br>
If the shape of the center axle is changed by manufacturing process in such a way that the angle between the plain surfaces of Ul AND U2 parts (figure-8) becomes 135° in stead of 180° ,this angle is the best angle for the purpose of easy pedalling.If the angle between Ul AND U2 is 135° the cranks fixed on this center axle will also have the same angle.Although ,the smaller the angle between both the cranks,the easier the pedalling of a bicycle but the most convenient angle for a cyclist is!35° at the time of pedalling.A cyclist can not apply his force after point E and up to the point H[figure-l].At the time of cycling just as one of the pedal crosses the point E by inertial force,the other pedal will cross the pedal point H and comes in the force applying part [H to A],if the angle between both the cranks is 135°.So in 135° angled crank system of pedals there will be no such time when both the pedals are found in non-force applying part[E to H] together.<br>
So at the time of manufacturing center axle of a bicycle the angle between the plains of Ul and U2 parts should be made 135°.This change in the shape of center axle makes the pedalling of a bicycle easier in such extent the a cyclist feels the pedals almost automatically moving at the time of cycling.So the 135° is the best angle between the plains of Ul and U2 parts of a center axle [figure-8] and also between the both cranks.</td>
