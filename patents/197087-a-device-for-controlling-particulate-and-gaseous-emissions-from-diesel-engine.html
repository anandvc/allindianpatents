				<td>This invention relates to a device for controlling particulate and gaseous emissions from diesel engine.<br>
Diesel engines emit a lot of particulate matters and hazardous gases as the exhaust of the vehicle. The main disadvantages of vehicle emissions having particulate matter are as follows:<br>
1.	It contains carcinogenics;<br>
2.	It causes lung congestions;<br>
3.	It causes reduction in visibility; and<br>
4.	It affects nervous system.<br>
There are various techniques for controlling the particulate matter in the exhaust from diesel engines like modifications in the engine, use of alternative fuels etc. However, these techniques are expensive to be useful practically for Indian low cost diesel engines.<br>
Therefore, the main object of the present invention is to provide a device to control particulate and hazardous gaseous emissions from diesel engines.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a device which is of low weight and is small in size and which does not affect the diesel engine at all.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a device which is of low cost and maintenance thereof is very easy.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a device which can be used as the silencer and reduces the noise from the engine.<br>
A further object of this invention is to propose a device which reduces gaseous oxides of sulpher and nitrogen from exhaust of the engine.<br>
According to this invention, there is provided a device for controlling particulate and gaseous emissions from diesel engine comprising: a container (1) for containing a scrubbing liquid selected from water or a mixture of water and lime, an inlet pipe (2) connected to the said container adapted to be connected with the exhaust pipe of the engine, a sparger (3) secured to the bottom end of a body (4) lower end of which is contained within the said container such that the said sparger is submerged in the said scrubbing liquid, a plurality of chevron plates (5) comprising zig-zag plates disposed spacedly within the said compartment, a .baffle plate (9) provided at the top end of the said compartment, an outlet chamber (6) secured at the top end of the said compartment, a cover (7) with an outlet (8) mounted on the top of the said outlet chamber to facilitate the exit of exhaust gases from the said container body, and water make up means provided to maintain level of scrubbing liquid in the said container.<br>
In accordance with this invention the device •for controlling particulate matters and hazardous gases present in the emissions -from diesel engines comprises a container for containing the scrubbing liquid such as water or water with additive -for example lime therein. An inlet pipe adapted to be connected with the silencer o-f the engine connected to the container of the device. A sparger is secured at the bottom end of the body disposed in the said container. A plurality of chevron plates are disposed within the top end of the body to produce artificial rain therein. An outlet chamber is mounted at the top end of the body for facilitating the exit of the exhaust gases from the container of the device and to stop the scrubbing liquid coming out from the container. Water make-up means comprising an electrical device with a magnetic switch being provided to maintain the water level in the container.<br>
The device for controlling particulate matter and hazardous gases present in the emissions from diesel engine according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein;<br>
Fig.1 shows the  sectional  view of the device, and Fig.2  shows the sectional view of the device  according to an option.<br>
Referring to the accompanying drawings the device for controlling the particulate<br>
matter and hazardous gases present in the vehicle emissions has a container (1) for containing a<br>
scrubbing liquid such as water therein. An inlet pipe (2) adapted to be connected to the exhaust<br>
pipe/silencer of the vehicle (not shown) is connected to the container (1) for conveying the<br>
emissions of the engine into the container (1) of the device. A sparger (3) is secured at the<br>
bottom end of a body (4) such that to be submerged in the scrubbing liquid contained in the<br>
container (1). A plurality of chevron plates (5) are disposed spacedly within the top end of the<br>
body (4) to remove the water particles from the exhaust gases and also to stop the flow of water<br>
from the container and to create artificial rain therein in order to entrap the carbon particles and<br>
other hazardous gases from the exhaust. An outlet chamber (6) is secured to the top end of the<br>
body (4). A cover (7) having an outlet (8) is secured to the top end of the chamber (6) for the exit<br>
of purified exhaust gases from the container (1). A baffle plate (9) is provided near the top end of<br>
the body (4) such that to stop scrubbing liquid coming out from the container. A pipe (10) is<br>
connected to the opening (11) in the bottom of the<br><br>
outlet chamber (6) to convey the water to the container (1) from the chamber (6). Water make-up means comprising electrical device (12) having magnetic switch assembly 
According to an option and as shown in Fig.2 the water make up means comprising a fj-oat (14) having a valve (15) provided therewith being provided to supply the water to the container (1) from the make—up water tank (16) having a water inlet (17) provided therewith. A gases conveying pipe (IB) is connected between the container (1) and make-up water tank (16) to keep similar pressure therein.<br><br><br><br><br>
