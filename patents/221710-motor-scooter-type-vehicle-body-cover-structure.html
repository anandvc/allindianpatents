"MOTOR SCOOTER TYPE VEHICLE BODY COVER STRUCTURE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA,  a corporation of Japan,   1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
GRANTED<br>

  ORIGINAL<br>
89/MUMNP/2002<br><br>
The present invention relates to a motor scooter type vehicle body cover structure.<br>
[DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION] [Technical Field of the Invention] .   .<br>
The present invention relates to structure for fitting a body cover for covering the front of a body in a motor-scooter type vehicle, particularly relates to a motor-scooter type vehicle provided with tampering preventing structure advantageous in the cost in a part of a front cover out of the front cover and a leg shield respectively forming a body cover. [Prior Art]<br>
Cover structure in the front of the body of a motor-scooter<br><br><br>
type vehicle is formed by covering with a front cover from the front and with a leg shield from the back which are opposite with a head pipe supporting a front fork and a steering stem inside and integrating the front cover and the leg shield by screwing (refer to Japanese published examined patent application No. Hei 1-33391 for example) . Such a front cover is made of resin or metal and the whole is integrated as a single part. [Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
However, as such a front cover is relatively large-sized and solid, a large-scale metallic mold having complex structure is required to mold the front cover as a single part and the cost is increased. Also, as the form of the front cover is required to be simplified so that the front cover can be easily molded to simplify the metallic mold and reduce the cost, the form is limited. Particularly, in case the front cover is made of metal, the adoption of relatively low-priced press molding is desired, however, in this case, the cost is increased by the large sizing of a press die and constraint in molding technique such as deep drawing is increased. Therefore, the structure of a front cover in which the cost of a metallic mold can be inhibited and technical constraint is reduced and which can be formed in a free shape is desired. In addition, in case a front cover molded as a single part is damaged, the whole is required to be replaced even if a part is damaged, however, as damage due to a fall, and others is often caused in only a part of either of the right or the left, replacement in such a case is wasteful and economical replacement is also desired.<br><br><br>
Then, the object of the invention is to realize such a demand.<br>
In a conventional type motor-scooter type vehicle, each upper part of a front cover and a leg shield is fastened by a screw and others, however, this screw and others can be easily detached with a general tool such as a driver. As a result, a body cover itself may be tampered or a body cover is detached and a part housed inside may be tampered. Then, the object of the invention is to provide the connecting structure of a body cover that can prevent such tampering at an advantageous cost. [Means to Solve the Problem]<br>
To solve the former problem, the invention according to Claim 1 related to body cover structure of a motor-scooter type vehicle according to the invention is based upon a motor-scooter type vehicle where the front of a body frame that supports a front fork is covered with a front cover, wherein: the front cover is divided into three parts of a center section and a pair of side sections with the center section in the center; the right and left side sections are connected by a coupling member attached to the front of a body frame that supports a front fork and are supported by the front of the body frame; and a part between the right and left side sections is covered with the center section. In this case, the center section and the right and left side sections may be also made of metal.<br>
The invention according to Claim 3 is based upon the body cover structure of a motor-scooter type vehicle according to Claim 1, and is characterized in that the coupling member is a battery tray and a battery is supported by the battery tray.<br>
To solve the latter problem, the invention according to<br><br>
Claim 4 is based upon the body cover structure of a motor-scooter type vehicle according to Claim 1, and is characterized in that the front of a body provided with a head pipe supporting a steering stem so that the steering stem can be turned is covered with a front cover and a leg shield opposite before and behind, a handlebar continuing from the steering stem above/over the front cover and the leg shield is covered with a handlebar cover and further, a steering lock for preventing the turning of the handlebar in a steered state is provided, an upper part of the front cover is connected to the side of the body from the rear side of the body so that it can be detached; and the connected part is hidden by a lower part of the handlebar cover when the handlebar is steered and is locked.<br>
The invention according to Claim 5 is based upon the body cover structure of the motor-scooter type vehicle according to Claim 4 and is characterized in that when the handlebar is located in a neutral position, the position of the connected tightened part is located in the vicinity of a lower part of the handlebar cover and is not overlapped with the lower part of the handlebar cover.<br>
The invention according to Claim 6 is based upon the body cover structure of the motor-scooter type vehicle according to Claim 4 and is characterized in that the front cover is divided into three parts of a center section and right and left side sections with the center section in the center, the right and left side sections are integrated and are attached to the body and the center section is connected so that the lower part is fitted to the side of the side section and the upper part is<br><br><br>
hidden by a lower part of the handlebar cover when the handlebar is locked.<br>
The invention according to Claim 7 is based upon the body cover structure of the motor-scooter type vehicle according to Claim 4 and is characterized in that a part connected so that the part is hidden by. a lower part of the handlebar cover when the handlebar is locked is a lid provided in a part of the front cover so that the lid can be opened or closed.<br>
The invention according to Claim 8 is based upon the body cover structure of the motor-scooter type vehicle according to Claim 4 and is characterized in that the connecting member is a fastening member such as a screw and the extension of the tightened axis is overlapped with a lower part of the handlebar cover when the handlebar is locked. [Effect of the Invention]<br>
According to the invention, as the front cover is divided into three parts of the center section and the right and left side sections, each divided part is a relatively small part, a small-sized metallic mold having simple structure can be used, the cost can be reduced, in addition, the molding is facilitated and the degree of the freedom of the form is also increased. As the right and left side sections which are divided parts are integrated by connecting them with the coupling member, are supported by the front of the body frame and a part between the right and left side sections is covered with the center section, the front cover can be formed. In addition, as only the damaged side of the right and left side sections can be individually replaced by dividing the right and left side<br><br><br>
sections which are the highest in the possibility of damage, it is economical.<br>
Further, in case the center section and the side sections are made of metal, the front cover the rigidity of which is high can be acquired and can be easily molded. In addition, low-priced press molding is also enabled and in this case, the degree of the freedom of the form can be also increased.<br>
According to the invention, as the coupling member the rigidity of which is relatively high is used for the battery tray to support the front cover, the battery tray connects and supports the front cover, simultaneously can support the battery and parts are made multifunctional.<br>
According to the invention, as at least one of connected parts of the upper part of the front cover is hidden by the lower part of the handlebar cover when the handlebar is steered and is locked in parking, the connected part cannot be operated with except a special tool and a screw and others cannot be removed. As a result, the front cover is difficult to be detached and the body cover itself or a part such as a battery housed inside the body cover can be prevented from being tampered. In addition, as the arrangement of the connected part has only to be related to the position of the lower part of the handlebar cover when the handlebar is locked, tampering preventing structure can be easily realized without newly providing a special dedicated member and special dedicated structure and is advantageous in the cost.<br>
If the position of the connected part for preventing tampering is set so that the position is not overlapped with<br><br><br>
the lower part of the handlebar cover and is open when the handlebar is located in a neutral position, connection can be easily released with a general tool in maintenance. Further, a tightening member such as a screw can be also used for a coupling member and in this case, if the extension of a tightened axis and the lower part of the handlebar cover are overlapped when the handlebar is locked, the tightening member such as a screw cannot be detached with a general tool.<br>
Also, the whole front cover provided with the connected part for preventing tampering may be also single or may be also divided and may be also provided with a lid for a glove box or maintenance in a part so that the lid can be opened or closed. In case the front cover is divided, it is divided into three parts of a center section and right and left side sections, the right and left side sections are integrated and are attached to the body so that they cannot be easily detached and the center section can be also.detached. In this case, the center section is fitted to the side, of the side section in the lower part and in the upper part, the connected part for preventing tampering is provided. Therefore, in such three parts divided structure, tampering preventing structure is also effective to the center section which can be detached.<br>
Further, in case the lid is provided to the center and others of the front cover, is cannot be opened by using an upper part of the lid for a connected part for preventing tampering and a glove box covered with the front cover or a fitting part to the body frame and others can be prevented from being tampered.

The right and left side sections 51 are provided on both right and left sides with the center section 50 in the center and are members for covering the right and left parts of the body when the members are viewed from the front of the body with the head pipe 30, the steering stem 31 and the front wheel between them. As shown in Fig. 8, each upper half of the right and left side sections 51 is separated by the width of the center section 50 and each hem 55 formed inside the body is lowered by one step backward so that the periphery of the center section<br>
50	can be fitted to the front. A lower part of the hem 55 is<br>
wider, is overlapped with a flange 41 of the coupling member<br>
35 and is integrated with the flange by a bolt 42 and a nut<br>
43 as shown in Fig. 12.<br>
Further, a cross plate 56 in the shape of a strip is put between each upper end of the hems 55 and is fixed by a tapping screw 57 shown in Fig. 8, Similarly, a cross plate 58 is put between each lower end and is fixed by a tapping screw 59 shown in Fig. 8. Hereby, the right and left side sections 51 are integrated by the coupling member 35 and the upper and lower cross plates 56 and 58. The inside of each lower part of the right and left side sections 51 under the coupling member 35 is curved convexly outside to avoid the front wheel 1 and the front fender 3.<br>
Also, in a state in which the right and left side sections<br>
51	shown in Fig. 8 are integrated, each edge at both right and<br><br><br>
left ends in the upper part forms an edge 60 joined to the leg shield 5 and a stay 61 is attached at a suitable interval along the joined edge 60. Reference numbers 36a and 38a in Fig. 8 respectively denote insertion holes for bolts 36 and 38.<br>
As shown in Figs. 5, 10, 11 and 13, the leg shield 5 is made of resin and is attached to the head pipe 30 in the center by a bolt 64 from the rear side of the body with the head pipe 30 and the steering stem 31 inside as shown in Fig. 2. Each right and left periphery and the upper periphery form an edge<br>
62	joined to the joined edge 60 of the side section 51, a boss<br>
63	is provided to a position corresponding to the stay 61 and the joined edge 62 is integrated with the joined edge 60 of the side section 51 from the rear side by a bolt (not shown) inserted into the boss 63.<br>
A swollen part 65 curved convexly backward for avoiding the main frame 14, the head pipe 30 and the steering stem 31 is formed vertically in the center in a transverse direction of the leg shield 5. The right and left parts of the swollen part 65 are equivalent to a part curved convexly forward for covering legs of a rider.<br>
A part at the upper end of the leg shield 5 and at the base of the curved part 65 forms a protruded part 66 protruded forward, is overlapped with each upper edge of the center section 50 and the right and left side sections 51 and a boss 67 is formed in a part overlapped with the center section 50. Bosses 68 and 69 are provided right and left in the upper part of the curved part 65 and a key hole 68a that functions as an eye hole for a key insertion part of the steering lock 48 is formed in<br><br><br>
the boss 68.<br>
As shown in Fig. 13, the upper end 50a of the center section 50 is protruded backward and the substantially L-type stay 53 is attached to the right and left parts. The upper part of the stay 53 is substantially horizontal, is integrated with the upper end 50a by welding and others, the lower part is protruded downward and a hole 53a is formed.<br>
The protruded part 66 of the leg shield 5 is overlapped with the upper end 50a and.the boss 67 is touched to the stay 53. Then, if a tapping screw 70 is inserted in the boss 67 from<br>
the rear side, is inserted into the hole 53a of the stay 53<br>
iand is fastened by a clip nut 71, each upper end of the center section 50 and the leg shield 5 is fastened and integrated. A line C in Fig. 13 shows an axis on which the tapping screw 70 is fastened. A reference number 72 in Fig. 13 denotes a lower part of the handlebar cover 6, the lower part is opposite to the upper end of the leg shield 5 and forms a contour substantially equivalent to the upper end face of the swollen part 65 as shown in Fig. 5.<br>
Next, tampering preventing.structure of the center section 50 will be described. Figs. 14 show positional relation between the tapping screw 70 on the left side of the body forming the tampering preventing structure and the handlebar cover 6 and Figs-. 15 show relation between these when they are viewed from the top of the body. In Figs. 14 and 15, A shows a neutral state of the handlebar 8 and B shows a state in which the handlebar is locked.<br>
As shown in each A. in Figs. 14 and 15, in the neutral<br><br>
state of the handlebar 8, that is, in a state of a direct advance, the tapping screw 7G is provided in a visible position without being overlapped with a lower part 72 of the handlebar cover 6 as shown in Fig. 14A when the tapping screw is viewed from the rear side of the body and an axis C on which the tapping screw 70 is tightened is not overlapped with the lower part 72 of the handlebar cover 6 as shown in Fig. 15A.<br>
For a state in which the handlebar 8 is steered in parking, in this embodiment, when the handlebar 8 is turned left by approximately 45° , a steering lock is operated. In this steering lock state, a part of the lower part 72 of the handlebar cover is overlapped with the tapping screw 70, the tapping screw cannot be viewed from the rear side of the body as shown in Fig. 14B and the extension of the axis C on which the tapping screw 70 is tightened is overlapped with the lower part 72 of the handlebar cover.<br>
As the form at the lower end opposite to the upper end of the leg shield 5 of the lower part 72 of the handlebar cover is substantially in the shape of a trapezoid the front of which is large as shown by a virtual line in Fig. 5 and a broken line in Figs. 15. and the steering stem 31 which is a shaft for turning the handlebar 8 is tilted backward (in a state tilted backward on the upside), a front large part of the lower part 72 of the handlebar cover is turned diagonally downward when the handlebar is locked and the tightened part of the tapping screw 70 is hidden as shown in Figs. 14B and 15B. As shown in Fig. 15B, the form of the lower part 72 of the handlebar cover when the handlebar is locked is distorted by the diagonal turning when<br><br><br>
the lower part is viewed from the top.<br>
Next, the action of this embodiment will be described. As the lower part 72 of the handlebar cover does not hide the tapping screw 70 when the handlebar 8 is located in a neutral position as shown in each A in Figs. 14 and 15, the tapping screw 70 is detached along the tightened axis C from the rear side of the body using a normal tool such as a driver, the center section 50 is opened and the battery 44 and others inside can be maintained.<br>
In the meantime, as the tapping screw 70 is hidden by the lower part 72 of the handlebar cover as shown in each B in Figs. 14 and 15 in a state in which the handlebar 8 is steered and is locked in parking, the tapping screw 70 cannot be detached, being interrupted by the lower part 72 of the handlebar cover even if the tapping screw 70 is tried to be detached from a direction of the tightened axis C using a normal tool. Therefore, the center section 50 is never detached, and the center section 50 itself and a part such as the battery 44 inside the front cover 4 can be prevented from being tampered.<br>
Particularly, as the tightened part of the tapping screw 70 is hidden or is open by a position in which the handlebar 8 is turned utilizing the lower part 72 of the handlebar cover, such tampering preventing structure can be realized only by setting the arrangement of the tapping screw 70 and as a special member and special structure are not required, the body cover structure equivalent to this embodiment is advantageous in terms of the cost.<br>
The invention is not limited to the embodiment, can be<br><br><br>
variously applied or transformed and for example, a target body cover may be also a front cover itself or a leg shield itself. A  front cover is not divided into three parts as in the embodiment, may be also single or and may be also provided with a lid for a glove box or maintenance in a part so that the lid can be opened or closed. As the lid is equivalent to the center section 50 in the embodiment, the upper end has only to be fastened by the tapping screw 70.<br>
In the embodiment, as the tapping screw 70 is provided with a function for connecting the center section 50 to the leg shield 5 so that the center section can be detached, a fastening member such as a screw and a bolt or other well-known various connecting members such as a plastic fastener can be used if only they have such a function. Further, the tapping screw 70 may be also used for fastening component members of the body cover or may be also used for a body frame or other rigid body fitted part.<br>
The protruded part 66 of the leg shield 5 is overlapped with the upper end 50a and the clamping seat 67 is touched to the stay 53. Then, if a tapping screw 70 is inserted in the clamping seat 67 from the rear side, is inserted into the hole 53a of the stay 53 and is fastened by a clip nut 71, each upper end of the center section 50 and the leg shield 5 is fastened and integrated. A line C in Fig. .13 shows an axis on which the tapping screw 70 is fastened. A reference number 72 in Fig. 13 denotes a lower part of the handlebar cover 6, the lower part is opposite to the upper end of the leg shield 5 and forms a contour substantially equivalent to the upper end face of<br><br><br>
the swollen part 65 as shown in Fig. 5.<br>
Next, the action of this embodiment will be described. The rigidity of the front cover'4 according to this embodiment can be enhanced by making the whole of metal and each divided part of the center section 50 and the side sections 51 can be small-sized by dividing into three parts of the center section 50 and the right and left side sections 51. Therefore, the metallicmoldcanbe small-sized, the structure can be simplified and the cost of the metallic mold can be reduced. The molding is also facilitated, the constraint of the form is also reduced and the degree of the freedom of the design can be increased.<br>
Particularly, as the press die can be small-sized and very high-grade technique such as deep drawing is not required according to miniaturization in case a metal plate is press-molded, the front cover can be easily press-molded even if the whole front cover has a complex form that requires deep drawing and the cost can be greatly reduced.<br>
The right and left side sections can be firmly connected and integrated by the coupling member 35 and the cross plates 56 and 58, the front cover integrated as a whole can be formed by covering clearance formed between the right and left side sections in the upper part of the front cover with the center section 50 and fitting the lower part to the coupling member 35 and the integration of the divided parts is facilitated.<br>
In addition, as the battery 44 can be supported by the coupling member 35, the right and left side sections 51 are firmly integrated utilizing the rigid structure required for the battery tray, the rigid and firm front cover 4 can be formed<br><br><br>
and further, the center section 50 can be also fitted to the coupling member when the rigidity of the coupling member 35 is enhanced, the coupling member is supported by the head pipe 30 in the center of the body and also functions as the battery tray, the coupling member 35 can be made multifunctional and . the body structure can be simplified.<br>
In addition, as the lower part of the center section 50 can be fitted only by inserting the hook 52 into the hole 45a of the stay 45 of the coupling member 35 via the grommet 45b, the mounting is facilitated and accelerated and as the center section can be simply detached only by removing the tapping screw 70 at the upper end because the lower part of the center, section 50 has fitting structure, the center section 50 can be easily detached and the maintenance of the battery 44 is facilitated..<br>
The invention is not limited to the embodiment, can be variously transformed and applied in the same principle of the invention. For example, the front cover 4 may be also made of resin and in this case, as in the case that it is made of metal,<br>
each effect that the cost of the metallic mold is reduced, the molding is facilitated and the degree of the freedom of the form is increased can be also expected.<br>
