TASTE POTENTIATOR COMPOSITIONS AND EDIBLE CONFECTIONERY<br>
AND CHEWING GUM PRODUCTS CONTAINING SAME<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/683,634,<br>
filed May 23,2005, U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/760,437, filed January 20, 2006 and<br>
U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/789,667, filed April 6,2006, the contents of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
The present invention includes oral compositions that provide an enhanced perception<br>
of an active substance contained therein. In particular, the compositions may include an<br>
active substance, such as a flavor, and a taste potentiator. The taste potentiator may increase<br>
the perception of the active substance upon consumption. The compositions may be<br>
incorporated into various types of edible orally delivered products, such as confectionery or<br>
chewing gum products.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
There are five primary categories of taste that are sensed by humans: sour, salty,<br>
sweet, bitter and umami (savory or the taste of glutamate). The taste of a substance is sensed<br>
by taste receptor cells located in taste buds primarily on the surface of the tongue and palate<br>
in the oral cavity. Each of the primary taste qualities is sensed by a specific mechanism. It is<br>
believed that sour and salty tastes are detected by the passage of ions, hydrogen and sodium<br>
respectively, through the ion channels in taste bud cells. This triggers a nerve impulse that is<br>
sensed in the brain as sour or salty. In contrast, it is believed that sweet, bitter and umami<br>
tastes are perceived by physical binding to receptors. In general, sweet, bitter and umami<br>
sensing taste cells have G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) on their surface. These<br>
receptors are activated when they bind to tastants, which initiates a series of signaling events<br>
that trigger a nerve impulse that is sensed in the brain as sweet, bitter or savory.<br>
Over the past several years, there have been a number of advances in research on taste<br>
perception. New taste receptor proteins have been identified in mammals, particularly two<br>
families of G-protein coupled receptors (T2Rs and TIRs), which are believed to be involved<br>
in taste perception. Such receptors are discussed in more detail in International Publication<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
Nos. WO 02/064631 and WO 03/001876. These publications disclose that co-expression of<br>
certain T1R receptors results in savory or sweet taste receptors that respond to savory or<br>
sweet taste stimuli, respectively.<br>
Recent advances in the understanding of taste perception have created interest in<br>
identifying new compounds for stimulating these taste receptors. In particular, research<br>
efforts also have been directed to methods of identifying compounds that may enhance the<br>
primary taste perceptions, such as sweet or savory perceptions. The development of<br>
substances that provide flavor enhancement is of particular interest, and such substances are<br>
generally referred to as taste or flavor enhancers, or potentiators. These substances have been<br>
thought to contribute taste, aroma and feeling factors, as well as potentiate and suppress other<br>
flavors. The activity of taste or flavor enhancers is often referred to as synergistic because<br>
they enhance or increase the perception of another substance.<br>
One category of taste potentiators of particular interest are compounds that enhance<br>
sweetness. Although naturally occurring carbohydrate sweeteners, such as sucrose, are the<br>
most widely used sweeteners, they suffer from the disadvantages of high cost and high<br>
caloric content. Artificial sweeteners have been designed that overcome these problems but<br>
they are sometimes rejected by the consumer for not having a sufficiently "sucrose-like"<br>
taste. Artificial sweeteners have different sweetness profiles from that of sucrose and often<br>
suffer from side effects such as delays in the onset of sweetness perception and/or unpleasant<br>
aftertastes.<br>
Compounds are known which, when combined with a sweetener, modify the taste of<br>
the sweetener. Such compounds are usually referred to as sweetness modifiers or<br>
potentiators. They may act to enhance or inhibit the perception of the sweetness of the<br>
sweetener or may affect the sweetness profile in some way. For example, Canadian Patent<br>
No. 1208966 discloses a broad range of aromatic compounds which are claimed as sweetness<br>
modifiers.<br>
European Patent No. 0132444 and U.S. Patent No. 4,627,987 describe 3-<br>
hydroxybenzoic acid (3-HB) as a sweetness potentiator and exemplify its use with sucrose,<br>
aspartame and saccharin to enhance sweetness when employed at pH 2.0 to 5.5.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
2,4-Dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,4-DHB) also is described as a sweetness potentiator, but<br>
the literature is ambiguous as to its effects. In U.S. Patent No. 5,232,735 it is listed as a<br>
"substantially tasteless sweetness inhibitor" whereas in Canadian Patent No. 1208966 the<br>
addition of 0.2% 2,4-DHB to a 5% sucrose solution is said to have resulted in an increase in<br>
sweetness. International Publication No. WO99/15032 describes the use of 2,4-DHB with<br>
aspartame to increase sweetness synergistically and provide a more "sucrose-like" taste and<br>
mouthfeel. The combination is considered peculiar, in that the same effect is not observed<br>
when 2,4-DHB is combined with the alternative artificial sweeteners, alitame, Ace-K<br>
(acesulfame potassium), saccharin or even a mixture of aspartame and Ace-K. U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,461,658 claims that 2,4-DHB improves the sweetness delivery profile of the artificial<br>
sweetener sucralose by significantly reducing the length of time during which sucralose<br>
sweetness is perceived. The same effect is not observed for aspartame even though this might<br>
be expected in light of International Publication No. WO99/15032. Figures 1 and 2 and Tables<br>
1 and 2 of U.S. Patent No. 6,461,658 seem to indicate that 2,4-DHB has a slightly inhibitory<br>
effect on the sweetness intensity of both sucralose and aspartame although this is not discussed<br>
in the text.<br>
International Publication No. WO00/69282 describes the modification of the taste and<br>
physicochemical properties of the sweetener neotame by the addition of at least one taste<br>
modifying hydrophobic acid additive. The taste modifying hydrophobic acid additive is<br>
limited only in that it must positively affect at least one taste characteristic imparted by<br>
neotame. These characteristics appear to be related to the sweetness profile, specifically the<br>
onset and linger period, but the examples do not describe how the characteristics have been<br>
affected. 3-HB and 2,4-DHB are listed among a very large number of such additives.<br>
Additionally, there have been a number of recent developments related to methods of<br>
identifying substances that function as taste potentiators. Various assays have been<br>
developed to identify target compounds that modulate the activity of taste receptors, and thus,<br>
may become successful taste potentiators. For example, International Publication Nos. WO<br>
02/064631 and WO 03/001876, referred to above, disclose assays and high-throughput<br>
screens that measure certain T1R receptor activity in the presence of target compounds.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,955,887 to Adler et al. discloses methods for identifying taste<br>
potentiators using newly identified mammalian taste-cell-specific G-protein coupled<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
receptors. More specifically, U.S. Patent No. 6,955,887 teaches methods for screening target<br>
compounds that may be used to modulate the sweet taste perception.<br>
Various other methods for screening compounds that may be used as taste potentiators<br>
are disclosed in the U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2005/0287517A1, 2005/0084932A1,<br>
2005/0069944A1, 2005/0032158A1, 2004/0229239A1, 2004/0209286A1, 2004/0191805A1,<br>
2004/0185469A1, 2004/0175793A1, 2004/0175792A1, 2004/0171042A1, 2004/0132075A1,<br>
2004/0072254A1, 2003/0232407A1, 2003/0170608Al and 2003/0054448Al.<br>
Despite progress in developing methods for identifying new taste potentiators, there is<br>
still a need for oral, particularly confectionery, compositions that include such taste<br>
potentiators. Further, there is a need for compositions that control the release rate of the taste<br>
potentiator from the composition. In particular, there is a need for chewing gums and other<br>
related confectioneries that control the release profile of taste potentiators, as desired, to<br>
manage the release profile of the chewing gum or confectionery product. Moreover, it would<br>
be desirable to develop a sweetener potentiator composition that allows the quantity of<br>
natural or artificial sweetener in an orally delivered product to be reduced, thereby reducing<br>
the cost of production and the calorie content of the orally delivered product, but which<br>
avoids adverse effects on flavor.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
As used herein the transitional term "comprising," (also "comprises," etc.) which is<br>
synonymous with "including," "containing," or "characterized by," is inclusive or open-<br>
ended and does not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps, regardless of its<br>
use in the preamble or the body of a claim.<br>
As used herein, the terms "bubble gum" and "chewing gum" are used interchangeably<br>
and are both meant to include any gum compositions.<br>
As used herein, the term "confectionery base" includes any ingredient or group of<br>
ingredients that represent form the bulk of the confectionery composition and provide the<br>
confectionery composition with its structural integrity and to which other ingredients are<br>
added.<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
The terra "flavor key" as used herein is a flavor component containing flavoring<br>
agents such as flavored oils, and the like, and is typically used to prepare a flavor essence.<br>
The term "flavor essence" ("flavor blend", "flavor extract") as used herein is a flavor<br>
component generally prepared from a flavor key.<br>
Embodiments described herein provide compositions for oral delivery of an active<br>
substance. Numerous different active substances may be employed, such as, for example,<br>
flavors. The compositions also may include a taste potentiator. The taste potentiator may act<br>
in a synergistic manner when used in conjunction with the active substance to enhance the<br>
perception of the active substance during consumption. Additionally, in some embodiments,<br>
the taste potentiator may be encapsulated to provide a controlled release profile, i.e., delayed<br>
or increased rate of release upon consumption. The taste potentiator accordingly may release<br>
over an extended period of time throughout the consumption of the product into which the<br>
composition is incorporated, such as, for example, chewing gum.<br>
Potentiator Compositions<br>
Embodiments described herein provide compositions that may include at least one<br>
active substance and at least one taste potentiator. The potentiator compositions may have<br>
controlled-release properties. The taste potentiator(s) may work synergistically with the<br>
active substance(s) to enhance the perception of the active(s). For instance, in some<br>
embodiments, the active substance may be a sweetener. Delivery of the sweetener in<br>
combination with at least one taste potentiator may enhance the sweet taste upon<br>
consumption of the composition. In particular, the taste potentiator(s) may function<br>
synergistically with the sweetener to enhance the sweet taste. The incorporation of the<br>
potentiator(s), therefore, allows for reduced amounts of sweetener without compromising the<br>
level of sweetness provided by the composition. Due to the calories contained in many<br>
conventional sweeteners, such as sugar, these results may be highly desirable. Additionally,<br>
there may be significant cost savings associated with the reduction in sweetener amounts<br>
used in the composition.<br>
For purposes of some embodiments described herein, "taste potentiator" refers to<br>
substances that may enhance the perception of an active substance during consumption of the<br>
composition. For purposes of some embodiments described herein, the term "enhance"<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
means to intensify, supplement, modify, modulate or potentiate. Some taste potentiators may<br>
be referred to more specifically by reference to the type of active they enhance. For example,<br>
sweetener (or sweetness) potentiators enhance the perception of a sweetener during<br>
consumption and flavor potentiators enhance the perception of a flavor during consumption.<br>
These more specific examples, however, are merely subsets of taste potentiators and are<br>
encompassed by the general term "taste potentiator" as used herein.<br>
Taste potentiators may have a synergistic effect when used in conjunction with an<br>
active, i.e., by enhancing the taste effects of the active substance such that the total effect is<br>
greater than the sum of the taste effects of the individual substances alone. In addition, some<br>
taste potentiators do not introduce a characteristic taste and/or aroma perception of their own.<br>
In some embodiments, for instance, the taste potentiator(s) may enhance the sour,<br>
sweet, bitter, salty or umami taste of a composition. The taste potentiator(s) also may<br>
function to enhance the effects of a variety of other active substances, as discussed in more<br>
detail below.<br>
Any of a variety of known substances that function as taste potentiators may be<br>
employed in the compositions described herein. For instance, suitable taste potentiators<br>

combinations thereof.<br>
Some other suitable taste potentiators include substances that are slightly soluble in<br>
water, such as, but not limited to, maltol, ethyl maltol, vanillin, slightly water-soluble sugar<br>
acids, slightly water-soluble hydrolyzed vegetable proteins, slightly water-soluble hydrolyzed<br>
animal proteins, slightly water-soluble yeast extracts, slightly water-soluble nucleotides and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
Additional suitable taste potentiators include, but are not limited to, licorice<br>
glycyrrhizinates, compounds that respond to G-protein coupled receptors (T2Rs and TIRs),<br>
G-protein coupled receptors (T2Rs and TIRs) and taste potentiator compositions that impart<br>

its entirety herein by reference. "Kokumi" refers to materials that impart "mouthfulness" and<br>
"good body". Kokumi imparting compositions may be water-soluble, slightly water-soluble<br>
or insoluble in water.<br>
As mentioned above, sweetener potentiators, which are a type of taste potentiator,<br>
enhance the taste of sweetness. Exemplary sweetener potentiators include, but are not limited<br>
to, monoamrnonium glycyrrhizinate, licorice glycyrrhizinates, citrus aurantium, alapyridaine,<br>
alapyridaine (N-(l-carboxyethyl)-6-(hydroxymethyl)pyridinium-3-ol) inner salt, miraculin,<br>

Additional taste potentiators for the enhancement of salt taste include acidic peptides,<br>
such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,974,597, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Acidic peptides include peptides having a larger number of acidic amino acids, such as<br>
aspartic acid and glutamic acid, than basic amino acids, such as lysine, arginine and histidine.<br>
The acidic peptides are obtained by peptide synthesis or by subjecting proteins to hydrolysis<br>
using endopeptidase, and if necessary, to deamidation. Suitable proteins for use in the<br>
production of the acidic peptides or the peptides obtained by subjecting a protein to<br>
hydrolysis and deamidation include plant proteins, (e.g. wheat gluten, corn protein (e.g., zein<br>
and gluten meal), soybean protein isolate), animal proteins (e.g., milk proteins such as milk<br>
casein and milk whey protein, muscle proteins such as meat protein and fish meat protein,<br>
egg white protein and collagen), and microbial proteins (e.g., microbial cell protein and<br>
polypeptides produced by microorganisms).<br>

The sensation of warming or cooling effects may also be prolonged with the use of a<br>
hydrophobic sweetener as described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0072842 Al, which<br>
is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. For example, such hydrophobic sweeteners<br>
include those of the formulae I-XI as set forth below:<br><br><br>

Perillartine may also be added as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,159,509 also<br>
incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.<br>
Any of the above-listed taste potentiators may be used alone or in combination.<br>
Some embodiments, for instance, may include two or more taste potentiators that act<br>
synergistically with one another. For instance, in some embodiments, a sweetener potentiator<br>
composition may be provided, which includes two or more sweetener potentiators that act<br>
synergistically with one another. The sweetener potentiator composition may enhance the<br>
sweetness of products into which it is incorporated by reducing the amount of sucrose needed<br>
to provide a sweetness intensity equivalent to sucrose. The sweetness enhancing effect of the<br>
combination of sweetener potentiators may be greater than the effect of either compound<br>
used individually.<br>
More specifically, according to some embodiments, there is provided a sweetener<br>
potentiator composition comprising 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (3-HB) and 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic<br>
acid (2,4-DHB) or comestible salts thereof.<br>
Comestible salts include acid (i.e. carboxylate) salts and/or hydroxylate salts, especially<br>
sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and ammonium salts and the like. Desirably, in some<br>
embodiments, the sweetener potentiator composition employs 3-HB and/or 2,4-DHB in the<br>
form of the acid, the sodium salt or the potassium salt.<br>
Although 3-HB and 2,4-DHB have been studied individually, they have not been used<br>
in combination. The inventors have discovered that a surprisingly large sweetness enhancing<br>
effect is observed when both compounds are employed in combination with a sweetener.<br>
This effect is greater than would be predicted by the use of either compound individually.<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
In particular, in some embodiments, sufficient amounts of 3-HB and 2,4-DHB axe<br>
employed in the sweetener potentiator compositions to create a sucrose equivalent value of at<br>
least about seven %, more specifically, at least about eight %.<br>
In general, 3-HB and 2,4-DHB may be used in amounts of about 200ppm, 400ppm or<br>
500ppm. 3-HB and 2,4-DHB may be incorporated into sweetener potentiator compositions in<br>
equal or different amounts.<br>
In some embodiments, the sweetener potentiator composition contains 3-HB and 2,4-<br>
DHB in a ratio by weight of from 1:9 to 9:1, more specifically from 2:8 to 8:2, even more<br>
specifically from 4:6 to 6:4 and most specifically 1:1.<br>
The sweetener potentiator composition may contain a further sweetener potentiator.<br>
For instance, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-DHB) or its comestible salt may be employed.<br>
In some embodiments, the sweetener potentiator composition may be provided as a<br>
pre-blended powder or liquid, which may be added to another composition, whereas in other<br>
embodiments, the individual components of the sweetener potentiator composition may be<br>
added to another composition as individual ingredients.<br>
In some embodiments, it may be desirable to control the release rate of the taste<br>
potentiator(s) from the compositions, as well as the overall release profile of the compositions<br>
themselves. Different release rates may be desired depending on the type of final product in<br>
which the composition is being incorporated and the consumption time thereof. For instance,<br>
chewing gum products may have different chew profiles, ranging anywhere from about 15 to<br>
about 120 minutes. Depending upon the chewing gum selected, different release rates will be<br>
desired. Other confectionery formats, such as hard candy, including nougats, caramels,<br>
frappes and taffies, also may have different release rates.<br>
In some embodiments, the release rate may be based on the solubility of the taste<br>
potentiator(s) in water. Selection of a specific solubility may be used to control the release<br>
profile of the taste potentiator(s), as well as the overall composition. More specifically, taste<br>
potentiators have varying solubilities in water. Although some of these components are<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
water-soluble, i.e., capable of being substantially or completely dissolvable in water, others<br>
exhibit poor or no solubility in water. In some embodiments, for instance, it may be desirable<br>
to select one or more taste potentiators that have low water-solubility in combination with an<br>
active known to exhibit poor solubility in water. The highly insoluble taste potentiator<br>
thereby may last throughout consumption of the composition as the active substance also<br>
slowly releases therefrom. Alternatively, a relatively highly water-soluble potentiator may be<br>
paired with a relatively highly water-soluble active substance. In both of these instances, the<br>
taste potentiator and active substance may be selected based on solubilities such that their<br>
release profiles are similar or overlap.<br>
In other embodiments, for example, it may be desirable to select several taste<br>
potentiators that have different solubilities in water such that the potentiators may release<br>
sequentially from the composition. Another example may include multiple sequentially<br>
releasing taste potentiators with multiple active substances also having different solubilities<br>
in water. Numerous other combinations of taste potentiators having different solubilities also<br>
may be used to provide different release profiles for the compositions. In view thereof, the<br>
solubility of the taste potentiator(s), as well as the combination thereof with the active(s),<br>
may be used to control and tailor the release profile of the overall composition.<br>
For purposes of some embodiments described herein, therefore, the term "controlled-<br>
release" means that the duration or manner of release is managed or modified to some degree<br>
to provide a desired release profile. More specifically, for example, controlled-release<br>
includes at least the following release profiles: delayed onset of release; pulsed release;<br>
gradual release; high initial release; sustained release; sequential release; and combinations<br>
thereof.<br>
Taste potentiators and active substances having different solubilities and/or release<br>
profiles may be combined in numerous different embodiments to provide compositions<br>
having many different overall release profiles. For example, one or more taste potentiators<br>
having any of the following release profiles may be combined in any manner with one or<br>
more active substances having any of the following release profiles: delayed onset of release<br>
("DOR"); pulsed release ("PR"); gradual release ("GR"); high initial release ("HIR"); and<br>
sustained release ("SUR"). Moreover, other techniques of imparting these, as well as other<br>
controlled-release profiles to taste potentiators and/or active substances may be employed.<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
For instance, encapsulation techniques, which are discussed in more detail below, may be<br>
used. Additionally, taste potentiator(s) and active substance(s) that are not encapsulated<br>
(sometimes referred to as "free" components) may be combined with other forms of the<br>
components, such as encapsulated forms, to tailor the release profile of the potentiator<br>
compositions. A sampling of hypothetical combinations is provided in Table 1 below,<br>
wherein P1-P3 represent different taste potentiators and A1-A3 represent different active<br>
substances. P1-P3 and A1-A3 may be used in their free and/or encapsulated forms.<br>

Controlled-release properties also may be imparted to the compositions described<br>
herein in other manners, such as, for example, by encapsulation techniques, as mentioned<br>
above. Encapsulation may be used to impart any of the various release profiles discussed<br>
above. In some embodiments, the taste potentiator(s) and/or active substance(s) may be<br>
encapsulated to control the rate of release of the potentiator and/or active from the<br>
composition. For example, in some embodiments, 3-HB and/or 2,4-DHB may be used in<br>
their encapsulated forms.<br>
For instance, some embodiments may include at least one encapsulated taste<br>
potentiator and at least one unencapsulated active, i.e., in its free form. Other embodiments<br>
may include at least one unencapsulated taste potentiator and at least one encapsulated active<br>
substance. Further, in some embodiments, both the taste potentiator(s) and active<br>
substance(s) may be encapsulated. In such embodiments, the taste potentiator(s) and active<br>
substance(s) may be encapsulated together or separately. In embodiments in which the taste<br>
potentiator(s) and active substance(s) are encapsulated separately, the material used to<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
encapsulate the components may be the same or different. Furthermore, in any of these<br>
embodiments, more than one material may be used to encapsulate the taste potentiator(s) or<br>
the active substance(s).<br>
In any of the embodiments mentioned above, the encapsulated form of the taste<br>
potentiator(s) or active substance(s) may be used in combination with an amount of the same<br>
component in its free, i.e., unencapsulated, form. By using both the free component and the<br>
encapsulated component, the enhanced perception of the active may be provided over a<br>
longer period of time and/or perception of the active by a consumer may be improved. For<br>
instance, some embodiments may include a taste potentiator that is encapsulated in<br>
combination with an amount of the same taste potentiator in its unencapsulated form.<br>
Alternatively, the unencapsulated taste potentiator could be a different taste potentiator from<br>
the potentiator that is encapsulated. Thereby, a mixture of two different taste potentiators<br>
may be included in some embodiments, one of which is encapsulated and the other in its free<br>
form. These variations also may be employed with respect to the active substance(s).<br>
Encapsulation may be effected by dispersion of the components, spray drying, spray<br>
coating, fluidized bed drying, absorption, adsorption, coacervation, complexation, or any<br>
other standard technique. In general, the taste potentiator(s) and/or active substances(s) may<br>
be encapsulated by an encapsulant. For purposes of some embodiments described herein, the<br>
term "encapsulant" refers to a material that can fully or partially coat or enrobe another<br>
substance. Encapsulation is also meant to include adsorption of a substance onto another<br>
substance and the formation of agglomerates or conglomerates between two substances.<br>
Any material conventionally used as an encapsulant in edible products may be<br>
employed. In some embodiments, for instance, it may be desirable to use an encapsulant that<br>
delays the release of the taste potentiator(s), such as, for example, a hydrophobic encapsulant.<br>
In contrast, in other embodiments, it may be desirable to increase the rate of release by using<br>
an encapsulant such as, for example, a hydrophilic material. Moreover, more than one<br>
encapsulant may be used. For example, a taste potentiator or an active substance may be<br>
encapsulated by a mixture of two or more encapsulants to tailor the rate of release.<br>
It is believed that taste potentiators can act in conjunction with active substances to<br>
enhance their activity. In some embodiments, therefore, it may be desirable to control the<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
release of the potentiator(s) such that it substantially coincides with that of the active<br>
substance(s) included in the composition. As discussed above, some taste potentiators have<br>
rapid release rates, whereas other taste potentiators have slower release rates. Meanwhile,<br>
some active substances have rapid release rates, whereas others have slower release rates. In<br>
some embodiments, the material used to encapsulate the taste potentiator(s) may be selected<br>
to delay or increase the release rate of the potentiator(s) based on the release profiles of both<br>
the potentiator(s) and active substance(s) selected for use together in the composition.<br>
More specifically, in some embodiments, the active substance(s) contained in the<br>
composition may have a slower release profile than the taste potentiator(s) selected for use in<br>
the same composition. It may be desirable, therefore, to delay the release of the taste<br>
potentiator(s) from the composition such that it releases substantially in conjunction with the<br>
active(s). The corresponding release profile may increase the effectiveness of the taste<br>
potentiator(s) in enhancing the perception of the active(s) throughout consumption.<br>
Suitable encapsulants for use in delayed release embodiments include, but are not<br>
limited to, polyvinyl acetate, polyethylene, crosslinked polyvinyl pyrrolidone,<br>
polymethylmethacrylate, polylactidacid, polyhydroxyalkanoates, ethylcellulose, polyvinyl<br>
acetatephthalate, methacrylicacid-co-methylmethacrylate and combinations thereof.<br>
In some embodiments, as mentioned above, the taste potentiator(s) may be water-<br>
soluble. For example, the following taste potentiators are water-soluble: neohesperidin<br>
dihydrochalcone, chlorogenic acid, alapyridaine, cynarin, miraculin, glupyridaine,<br>
pyridinium-betain compounds, glutamates, such as monosodium glutamate and<br>
monopotassium glutamate, neotame, thaumatin, tagatose, trehalose, salts, such as sodium<br>
chloride, monoammonium glycyrrhizinate, vanilla extract (in ethyl alcohol), water-soluble<br>
sugar acids, potassium chloride, sodium acid sulfate, water-soluble hydrolyzed vegetable<br>
proteins, water-soluble hydrolyzed animal proteins, water-soluble yeast extracts, adenosine<br>
monophosphate (AMP), glutathione, water-soluble nucleotides, such as inosine<br>
monophosphate, disodium inosinate, xanthosine monophosphate, guanylate monophosphate,<br>
alapyridaine (N-(l-carboxyethyl)-6-(hydroxymethyl)pyridinium-3-ol inner salt, sugar beet<br>
extract (alcoholic extract), sugarcane leaf essence (alcoholic extract), curculin, strogin,<br>

acid (2,4-DHB), 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHB), 2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,6-<br>
DHB), 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-DHB), 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,5-DHB), 2,3,4-<br>
trihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3,4-THB), 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzoic acid (2,4,6-THB), 3,4,5-<br>

3-hydroxycinnamic acid, 3-aminobenzoic acid, 4-aminobenzoic acid and combinations<br>
thereof. Due to their water-solubility, such taste potentiators may tend to release rapidly from<br>
the compositions into which they are incorporated. As such, in some embodiments, water-<br>
soluble taste potentiators may be encapsulated by an encapsulant that delays the release of the<br>
potentiator(s), as provided above.<br>
In other embodiments, it may be desirable to increase the release of the taste<br>
potentiator(s) from the composition. For instance, the taste potentiator(s) included in the<br>
composition may have a slower release rate than the active substance(s) selected for use in<br>
combination therewith. This difference in release rates may reduce the effectiveness of the<br>
taste potentiator(s). Accordingly, such taste potentiators may be encapsulated with an<br>
encapsulant that increases the rate of the potentiator's release. Thereby, the release of the<br>
potentiator(s) and the active(s) may substantially coincide during consumption.<br>
Suitable encapsulants for use in increased release embodiments include, but are not<br>
limited to, cyclodextrins, sugar alcohols, starch, gum arabic, polyvinylalcohol, polyacrylic<br>
acid, gelatin, guar gum, fructose and combinations thereof.<br>
In some embodiments, as mentioned above, the taste potentiator(s) may be<br>
substantially or completely insoluble in water. For example, the following taste potentiators<br>
are substantially or completely water-insoluble: citrus aurantium, vanilla oleoresin, water<br>
insoluble sugar acids, water insoluble hydrolyzed vegetable proteins, water insoluble<br>
hydrolyzed animal proteins, water insoluble yeast extracts, insoluble nucleotides, sugarcane<br>
leaf essence and combinations thereof. Due to their poor solubility in water, such taste<br>
potentiators may tend to release slowly from the compositions. As such, in some<br>
embodiments, substantially or completely water-insoluble taste potentiators may be<br>
encapsulated by an encapsulant that increases the release of the potentiator(s), as provided<br>
above.<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
In accordance with the above, the encapsulated taste potentiator may include a taste<br>
potentiator and an encapsulant. The encapsulant may be selected based upon the desired<br>
release profile of the taste potentiator. In some embodiments, the taste potentiator(s) may be<br>
present in amounts of about 0.01% to about 10% by weight of the composition, more<br>
specifically about 0.1% to about 2% by weight of the composition.<br>
In some embodiments, the encapsulant may be present in amounts of about 1% to<br>
about 95% by weight of the composition, more specifically about 5% to about 30% by weight<br>
of the composition.<br>
In some embodiments, the encapsulated substance, i.e. encapsulated taste<br>
potentiator(s) or active(s), may have a high tensile strength, such as at least about 6,500 psi.<br>
More specifically, the tensile strength may be about 6,500 psi to about 200,000 psi. Such<br>
tensile strengths may be suitable for controlling the release of the taste potentiator(s) and/or<br>
active substance(s) in a consistent manner over an extended period of time. Tensile strengths<br>
of encapsulated substances are described in more detail in U.S. Patent Publication No.<br>
2005/0112236 Al, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
In some embodiments, the active substance(s) included in the potentiator<br>
compositions may be present in amounts of about 1% to about 95% by weight of the<br>
composition, more specifically about 5% to about 30% by weight of the composition.<br>
The active substance(s) may be any component for which the perception is enhanced<br>
in some manner by the presence of one or more taste potentiators. Suitable active substances<br>
include, but are not limited to, compounds that provide flavor, sweetness, tartness, umami,<br>

In some embodiments, a mixture of at least one active substance and at least one taste<br>
potentiator is encapsulated, rather than encapsulating the taste potentiator or the active<br>
substance alone. Similar to above, the encapsulant may be selected to delay or increase the<br>
rate of release of the mixture of components. Any of the encapsulants described above may<br>
be employed.<br>
For example, in some embodiments, the active substance(s) may be at least one<br>
intense sweetener. The intense sweetener(s) may be mixed with at least one taste potentiator,<br>
which is selected to increase the sweet taste of the intense sweetener(s). This mixture of<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
components may then be encapsulated. Examples of suitable intense sweeteners include, but<br>
are not limited to, neotame, aspartame, Acesulfame-K, sucralose, saccharin and combinations<br>
thereof.<br>
In embodiments including an encapsulated mixture of active(s) and potentiator(s), the<br>
active substance(s) may be present in amounts of about 1% to about 95% by weight of the<br>
composition, more specifically about 5% to about 30% by weight. The taste potentiator(s)<br>
may be present in amounts of about 0.01% to about 12% by weight of the composition, more •<br>
specifically about 0.1% to about 5% by weight. The encapsulant may be present in amounts<br>
of about 1% to about 95% by weight of the composition, more specifically about 10% to<br>
about 60% by weight.<br>
As mentioned above, some embodiments may include a mixture of at least one<br>
encapsulated taste potentiator and at least one taste potentiator in its free form. The<br>
encapsulated and unencapsulated taste potentiators may be the same or different. The<br>
encapsulated taste potentiator(s) may be encapsulated by any of the materials described<br>
above. The mixture of encapsulated and unencapsulated taste potentiators may be combined<br>
with one or more active substances to provide a potentiator composition.<br>
Some other embodiments provide compositions that modulate the activity of taste<br>
receptor cells in a mammal. Such compositions may include at least one active substance and<br>
at least one taste potentiator, as described above. These components may be encapsulated or<br>
unencapsulated, also as described above. The taste potentiator(s) may modulate the activity<br>
of taste receptor cells upon consumption of the composition. More specifically, taste is<br>
perceived through sensory cells located in the taste buds. Different signaling mechanisms<br>
sense the primary tastes of salty, sour, sweet, bitter and umami. Eventually a nerve impulse<br>
is triggered in the brain that is sensed as one of these primary tastes.<br>
Taste potentiators function by modulating the activity of taste receptor cells at some<br>
point in this taste signaling pathway. For instance, in some cases, taste potentiators may bind<br>
to taste receptors, such as, for example, sweet taste receptors, which thereby enhances the<br>
perception of the sweet taste. In other embodiments, for example, taste potentiators may<br>
block taste receptors, such as, for example bitter receptors, which suppresses the perception<br>
of a bitter taste and thereby enhances the perception of a sweet taste. Taste potentiator(s),<br>
36<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
therefore, modulate the activity of taste receptor cells in mammals, which thereby enhances<br>
the perception of a given taste. This activity may enhance the perception of an active<br>
substance contained in the composition when consumed in conjunction with a taste<br>
potentiator.<br>
Edible Orally Delivered Products<br>
In some embodiments, the potentiator compositions may reside in an orally delivered<br>
product including at least one active substance and at least one taste potentiator.<br>
The orally delivered product may be a foodstuff, pharmaceutical or personal care<br>
product. Preferred foodstuffs include confectionery, especially chocolates, hard boilings and<br>
other sugar-based candies, jellies, soft candies, edible films, lozenges, pressed tablets, cereal<br>
bars, chewing gum, and the like. Pharmaceuticals may be delivered in the form of a tablet,<br>
capsule, solution, tincture, linctus or syrup. Confectionery and solid pharmaceutical delivery<br>
forms optionally can be coated. Exemplary personal products include toothpaste, mouth<br>
spray, and mouth wash.<br>
In some embodiments, the orally delivered product may be a frozen or<br>
refrigerated/perishable product. Such frozen or refrigerated foodstuffs may include, but are<br>
not limited to, frozen desserts, frozen confections, yogurts, puddings, frozen baked goods and<br>
whipped toppings.<br>
In still other embodiments, sweetened orally delivered products may include jams,<br>
jellies, peanut butter, baked goods, syrups, toppings, and sweet and salty snacks, such as<br>
sweetened roasted nuts, kettle corn, barbeque potato snacks, and the like.<br>
In some embodiments, the orally delivered product may include a confectionery base<br>
or gum base and any of the potentiator compositions described herein. In some<br>
embodiments, some or all of the active and/or the taste potentiator may be employed in a free<br>
form (e.g., unencapsulated). Alternatively, the product may include some or all of the active<br>
and/or the taste potentiator in an encapsulated form. As a further alternative, the product may<br>
include some of the active and/or the taste potentiator in a free form and some of the active<br>
and/or the taste potentiator in an encapsulated form. In some embodiments, the product may<br>
include two or more potentiator compositions.<br>
37<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
In some embodiments, the potentiator composition used in the orally delivered<br>
product may be a sweetener potentiator composition including 3-HB and/or 2,4-DHB. As<br>
mentioned above, 3-HB and 2,4-DHB act synergistically with one another to enhance the<br>
sweetness of orally delivered products into which the potentiators are incorporated.<br>
For beverages and confectionery products, the concentration of 3-HB, as calculated in<br>
the form of the free acid, generally may be up to 1500ppm in the orally delivered product, more<br>
specifically in the range from 100 to 1500ppm, even more specifically in the range from 200 to<br>
lOOOppm, yet more specifically in the range from 300 to 800ppm and most specifically in the<br>
range from 400 to 600ppm.<br>
For beverages and confectionery products, the concentration of 2,4-DHB, as<br>
calculated in the form of the free acid, generally may be up to 1500ppm in the product, more<br>
specifically in the range from 100 to 1500ppm, even more specifically in the range from 200<br>
to lOOOppm, yet more specifically in the range from 300 to 800ppm and most specifically in<br>
the range from 400 to 600ppm.<br>
In general, the combined concentration of 3-HB and 2,4-DHB may be no more than<br>
1500ppm in beverages and confectioneries.<br>
For chewing gums, the concentration of 3-HB and/or 2,4-DHB, as calculated in the<br>
form of the free acid, generally may be up to 5000ppm in the product, more specifically in the<br>
range from 100 to 5000ppm, even more specifically in the range from 1000 to 5000ppm, yet<br>
more specifically in the range from 2000 to 5000ppm and most specifically in the range from<br>
3000 to 5000ppm.<br>
Of course, the required concentrations will depend upon the nature of the orally<br>
delivered product to be sweetened, the level of sweetness required, the nature of the<br>
sweetener(s) in the product and the degree of enhancement required.<br>

WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
Confectionery Compositions<br>
When the orally delivery product is a confectionery composition, the product may be<br>
a comestible selected from forms such as, but not limited to, hard candy, soft candy, center-<br>
fill candy, cotton candy, pressed tablets, edible film, lozenges, and the like.<br>
Confectionery compositions may include a confectionery base and any of the<br>
potentiator compositions described above, which may include at least one active substance<br>
and at least one taste potentiator. The confectionery compositions also may include a variety<br>
of optional additives, as provided in more detail below. Upon consumption, the composition<br>
containing the active(s) and the taste potentiator(s) releases from the confection and provides<br>
an enhanced perception of the active(s) contained therein.<br>
For example, in some embodiments, the active substance may be at least one<br>
sweetener, such as, a sugar sweetener, sugarless bulk sweetener, intense sweetener or any<br>
combination thereof. In general, the active substance(s) may be present in amounts of about<br>
0.0001% to about 75% by weight of the confectionery composition. In some embodiments,<br>
which include actives other than intense sweeteners, the active substance(s) may be present in<br>
amounts of about 25% to about 75% by weight of the confectionery composition. The taste<br>
potentiator(s) may be present in amounts of about 0.01% to about 10% by weight of the<br>
confectionery composition.<br>
Some embodiments are directed to a comestible in the form of a lozenge or candy,<br>
also commonly referred to as confectioneries. Such confectionery compositions may include<br>
a confectionery base including bulk sweeteners such as sugars and sugarless bulk sweeteners,<br>
or the like, or mixtures thereof. Bulk sweeteners generally are present in amounts of about<br>
0.05% to about 99% by weight of the composition.<br>
A variety of traditional ingredients also may be included in the confectioneries in<br>
effective amounts such as coloring agents, antioxidants, preservatives, sweeteners, and the<br>
like. Coloring agents may be used in amounts effective to produce the desired color. The<br>
coloring agents may include pigments which may be incorporated in amounts up to about<br>
6%, by weight of the composition. For example, titanium dioxide may be incorporated in<br>
amounts up to about 2%, and preferably less than about 1%, by weight of the composition.<br>
The colorants may also include natural food colors and dyes suitable for food, drug and<br>
39<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
cosmetic applications. These colorants are known as F.D.&amp; C. dyes and lakes. The materials<br>
acceptable for the foregoing uses are preferably water-soluble. Illustrative nonlimiting<br>
examples include the indigoid dye known as F.D.&amp; C. Blue No.2, which is the disodium salt<br>
of 5,5-indigotindisulfonic acid. Similarly, the dye known as F.D.&amp; C. Green No.l comprises<br>
a triphenylmethane dye and is the monosodium salt of 4-[4-(N-ethyl-p-<br>
sulfoniumbenzylamino) diphenylmethylene]-[l-(N-ethyl -N-p-sulfoniumbenzyl)-delta-2,5-<br>
cyclohexadieneimine]. A full recitation of all F.D.&amp; C. colorants and their corresponding<br>
chemical structures may be found in the Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology,<br>
3rd Edition, in volume 5 at pages 857-884, which text is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Lubricants also may be added in some embodiments to improve the smoothness of the<br>
comestible, such as, for example hard candy embodiments. Smoothness also is a<br>
characteristic that leads to an increased perception of hydration upon consumption. Suitable<br>
lubricants include, but are not limited to, fats, oils, aloe vera, pectin and combinations<br>
thereof.<br>
Similarly, in some embodiments, the comestible may have smooth edges. In such<br>
embodiments, the comestible may have any shape, such as square, circular or diamond-<br>
shaped, however, the edges are rounded to provide a smooth comestible. Another manner of<br>
lending smoothness to the comestibles is to deposit the comestible composition into moulds<br>
during the manufacturing process. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the comestible is<br>
deposited, as described in more detail below.<br>
In some embodiments, the confectionery composition may further include a sweetener<br>
selected from Lo han guo, stevia, monatin and combinations thereof.<br>
Other conventional additives known to one having ordinary skill in the art also may<br>
be used in the confectionery compositions.<br>
In some embodiments, confectionery compositions may be produced by batch<br>
processes. Such confections may be prepared using conventional apparatus such as fire<br>
cookers, cooking extruders, and/or vacuum cookers. In some embodiments, the bulk<br>
sweetener (sugar or sugar free) and a solvent (e.g., water), are combined in a mixing vessel to<br>
form a slurry. The slurry is heated to about 70°C to 120°C to dissolve any sweetener crystals<br>
40<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT7US2006/020307<br>
or particles and to form an aqueous solution. Once dissolved, heat and vacuum are applied to<br>
cook the batch and boil off water until a residual moisture of less than about 4% is achieved.<br>
The batch changes from a crystalline to an amorphous, or glassy, phase. The potentiator<br>
composition then may be admixed in the batch by mechanical mixing operations, along with<br>
any other optional additives, such as coloring agents, flavorants, and the like. The batch is<br>
then cooled to about 50°C to 10°C to attain a semi-solid or plastic-like consistency.<br>
The optimum mixing required to uniformly mix the actives, potentiators, and other<br>
additives during manufacturing of hard confectionery is determined by the time needed to<br>
obtain a uniform distribution of the materials. Normally, mixing times of from four to ten<br>
minutes have been found to be acceptable. Once the candy mass has been properly tempered,<br>
it may be cut into workable regions or formed into desired shapes having the correct weight<br>
and dimensions. A variety of forming techniques may be utilized depending upon the shape<br>
and size of the final product desired. Once the desired shapes are formed, cool air is applied<br>
to allow the comestibles to set uniformly, after which they are wrapped and packaged.<br>
Alternatively, various continuous cooking processes utilizing thin film evaporators<br>
and injection ports for incorporation of ingredients including the potentiator compositions are<br>
known in the art and may be used as well.<br>
The apparatus useful in accordance with some embodiments comprise cooking and<br>
mixing apparatus well known in the confectionery manufacturing arts, and selection of<br>
specific apparatus will be apparent to one skilled in the art.<br>
Additionally, in some embodiments, various confectionery configurations with<br>
multiple regions may be employed. These configurations may include, but are not limited to,<br>
liquid center-fill, powder center-fill, hard coated, soft coated, laminated, layered and enrobed.<br>
In some embodiments, the potentiator composition may be included in one region or in<br>
multiple regions of the product.<br>
Soft Confectionery Compositions<br>
In some embodiments, the orally delivered product may be in the form of various soft<br>
confectionery formats. Soft confectionery formats may include, but are not limited to,<br>
nougat, caramel, taffy, gummies and jellies.<br>
41<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
Soft confectionery compositions may include a confectionery base and any of the<br>
potentiator compositions described above, which may include at least one active substance<br>
and at least one taste potentiator. The soft confectionery compositions also may include a<br>
variety of optional additives, such as any of the additives set forth above in the section<br>
describing confectionery compositions. Upon consumption, the composition containing the<br>
active(s) and the taste potentiator(s) releases from the soft confection and provides an<br>
enhanced perception of the active(s) contained therein.<br>
For example, in some embodiments, the active substance may be at least one<br>
sweetener, such as, a sugar sweetener, sugarless bulk sweetener, intense sweetener or any<br>
combination thereof. In general, the active substance(s) may be present in amounts of about<br>
0.0001% to about 75% by weight of the soft confectionery composition. In some<br>
embodiments, which include actives other than intense sweeteners, the active substance(s)<br>
may be present in amounts of about 25% to about 75% by weight of the soft confectionery<br>
composition. The taste potentiator(s) may be present in amounts of about 0.01% to about<br>
10% by weight of the soft confectionery composition.<br>
Some soft confectionery compositions include nougat compositions, which may<br>
include two principal components, a high-boiled candy and a frappe. By way of example,<br>
egg albumen or substitute thereof is combined with water and whisked to form a light foam.<br>
Sugar and glucose are added to water and boiled typically at temperatures of from about<br>
130°C to 140°C and the resulting boiled product is poured into a mixing machine and beaten<br>
until creamy. The beaten albumen and flavoring agent are combined with the creamy product<br>
and the combination is thereafter thoroughly mixed.<br>
In some embodiments, a caramel composition may include sugar (or sugar substitute),<br>
corn syrup (or polyol syrup), partially hydrogenated fat, milk solids, water, butter, flavors,<br>
emulsifiers, and salt. To prepare the caramel, the sugar/sugar substitute, corn syrup/polyol<br>
syrup, and water may be mixed together and dissolved over heat. Then, the milk solids may<br>
be mixed in to the mass to form a homogeneous mixture. Next, the minor ingredients may be<br>
mixed in with low heat. The heat then may be increased to boiling. Once sufficient water is<br>
removed and color/flavor developed, the mass may be cooled somewhat and temperature<br>
42<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
sensitive ingredients (including some potentiators) may be mixed in prior to discharging and<br>
forming/shaping/wrapping the finished product.<br>
In some embodiments, a taffy composition may include sugar (or sugar substitute), corn<br>
syrup (or polyol syrup), partially hydrogenated fat, water, flavors, emulsifiers, and salt. The<br>
process for preparing taffy can be similar to that for caramel and, optionally, the final taffy<br>
mass may be pulled to develop its desired texture.<br>
In some embodiments, a gummi composition may include sugar (or sugar substitute),<br>
corn syrup (or polyol syrup), gelatin (or suitable hydrocolloid), flavor, color, and optionally<br>
acid. The gummi may be prepared by hydrating the gelatin or suitable hydrocolloid, heating<br>
the sugar/corn syrup (sugar substitute/polyol syrup) and combining the two components with<br>
heat. Once the combined mixture reaches its final temperature or suitable sugar solids level,<br>
components such as flavor, color, and the like may be incorporated into the mixture and then<br>
poured into molds prior to cooling, wrapping, and finishing. Various surface treatments such as<br>
applications of wax or fat can be applied to decrease sticking.<br>
In some embodiments, a jelly composition may include a starch-based jelly or a pectin-<br>
based jelly. As with gummis, jelly products may be produced by hydrating the hydrocolloid<br>
and combining the hydrated mixture with a cooked syrup component. The mixture then may<br>
be cooked to a final moisture content and minor components may be incorporated. As with<br>
gummis, jelly candies may be poured into molds such as starch molds. As with gummis,<br>
surface treatments, such as fats or waxes, may be applied. Additionally, jelly candies may have<br>
dry surface treatments, such as applications of sanding sugar, acid, non-pareils, and the like.<br>
Additionally, in some embodiments, various soft confectionery configurations with<br>
multiple regions may be employed. These configurations may include, but are not limited to,<br>
liquid center-fill, powder center-fill, hard coated, soft coated, laminated, layered and enrobed.<br>
In some embodiments, the potentiator composition may be included in one region or in<br>
multiple regions of the product.<br>
Chewing Gum Compositions<br>
Some embodiments provide chewing gum compositions for delivery of the potentiator<br>
compositions described above. Such chewing gum compositions may include a gum base<br>
43<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
and any of the potentiator compositions described above, which may include at least one<br>
active substance and at least one taste potentiator. The chewing gum compositions also may<br>
include a variety of optional additives, as provided in more detail below. Upon consumption,<br>
the composition containing the active(s) and the taste potentiator(s) releases from the<br>
chewing gum and provides an enhanced perception of the active(s) contained therein.<br>
As described in detail above, in some embodiments, the potentiator composition<br>
generally includes at least one active substance and at least one taste potentiator. In some<br>
embodiments, the taste potentiator(s) and/or active(s) may be encapsulated, as described<br>
above, or a mixture of the active(s) and taste potentiator(s) may be encapsulated. These<br>
components may be selected from any of those described above. For example, in some<br>
embodiments, the active substance may be at least one sweetener, such as, a sugar sweetener,<br>
sugarless bulk sweetener, intense sweetener or any combination thereof. In general, the<br>
active substance(s) may be present in amounts of about 0.0001% to about 75% by weight of<br>
the chewing gum composition. In some embodiments, which include actives other than<br>
intense sweeteners, the active substance(s) may be present in amounts of about 25% to about<br>
75% by weight of the chewing gum composition. The taste potentiator(s) may be present in<br>
amounts of about 0.01% to about 10% by weight of the chewing gum composition.<br>
In some embodiments, the chewing gum composition may include multiple taste<br>
potentiators. The taste potentiators may be encapsulated or unencapsulated and may be the<br>
same or different. In some embodiments, the multiple taste potentiators may be different.<br>
Some chewing gum compositions, for instance, may include one or more taste potentiators<br>
that are encapsulated in combination with one or more different taste potentiators that are<br>
unencapsulated. In some embodiments, two different encapsulated taste potentiators may be<br>
used in a chewing gum composition. Alternatively, in some other embodiments, the chewing<br>
gum composition may include a combination of the same taste potentiator in its encapsulated<br>
and free forms.<br>
The chewing gum composition also may include a gum base. The gum base may<br>
include any component known in the chewing gum art. Such components may be water<br>
soluble, water-insoluble or a combination thereof. For example, the gum base may include<br>
elastomers, bulking agents, waxes, elastomer solvents, emulsifiers, plasticizers, fillers and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
44<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
The elastomers (rubbers) employed in the gum base will vary greatly depending upon<br>
various factors such as the type of gum base desired, the consistency of gum composition<br>
desired and the other components used in the composition to make the final chewing gum<br>
product. The elastomer may be any water-insoluble polymer known in the art, and includes<br>
those gum polymers utilized for chewing gums and bubble gums. Illustrative examples of<br>
suitable polymers in gum bases include both natural and synthetic elastomers. For example,<br>
those polymers which are suitable in gum base compositions include, without limitation,<br>
natural substances (of vegetable origin) such as chicle, natural rubber, crown gum, nispero,<br>
rosidinha, jelutong, perillo, niger gutta, tunu, balata, guttapercha, lechi capsi, sorva, gutta kay,<br>
and the like, and mixtures thereof. Examples of synthetic elastomers include, without<br>
limitation, styrene-butadiene copolymers (SBR), polyisobutylene, isobutylene-isoprene<br>
copolymers, polyethylene, polyvinyl acetate and the like, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The amount of elastomer employed in the gum base may vary depending upon<br>
various factors such as the type of gum base used, the consistency of the gum composition<br>
desired and the other components used in the composition to make the final chewing gum<br>
product. In general, the elastomer will be present in the gum base in an amount from about<br>
10% to about 60% by weight, desirably from about 35% to about 40% by weight.<br>
In some embodiments, the gum base may include wax. It softens the polymeric<br>
elastomer mixture and improves the elasticity of the gum base. When present, the waxes<br>
employed will have a melting point below about 60°C, and preferably between about 45°C<br>
and about 55°C. The low melting wax may be a paraffin wax. The wax may be present in<br>
the gum base in an amount from about 6% to about 10%, and preferably from about 7% to<br>
about 9.5%, by weight of the gum base.<br>
In addition to the low melting point waxes, waxes having a higher melting point may<br>
be used in the gum base in amounts up to about 5%, by weight of the gum base. Such high<br>
melting waxes include beeswax, vegetable wax, candelilla wax, carnuba wax, most petroleum<br>
waxes, and the like, and mixtures thereof.<br>
45<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
In addition to the components set out above, the gum base may include a variety of<br>
other ingredients, such as components selected from elastomer solvents, emulsifiers,<br>
plasticizers, fillers, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The gum base may contain elastomer solvents to aid in softening the elastomer<br>
component. Such elastomer solvents may include those elastomer solvents known in the art,<br>
for example, terpinene resins such as polymers of alpha-pinene or beta-pinene, methyl,<br>
glycerol and pentaerythritol esters of rosins and modified rosins and gums such as<br>
hydrogenated, dimerized and polymerized rosins, and mixtures thereof. Examples of<br>
elastomer solvents suitable for use herein may include the pentaerythritol ester of partially<br>
hydrogenated wood and gum rosin, the pentaerythritol ester of wood and gum rosin, the<br>
glycerol ester of wood rosin, the glycerol ester of partially dimerized wood and gum rosin,<br>
the glycerol ester of polymerized wood and gum rosin, the glycerol ester of tall oil rosin, the<br>
glycerol ester of wood and gum rosin and the partially hydrogenated wood and gum rosin and<br>
the partially hydrogenated methyl ester of wood and rosin, and the like, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The elastomer solvent may be employed in the gum base in amounts from about 2% to about<br>
15%, and preferably from about 7% to about 11%, by weight of the gum base.<br>
The gum base may also include emulsifiers which aid in dispersing the immiscible<br>
components into a single stable system. The emulsifiers useful in this invention include<br>
glyceryl monostearate, lecithin, fatty acid monoglycerides, diglycerides, propylene glycol<br>
monostearate, and the like, and mixtures thereof. The emulsifier may be employed in<br>
amounts from about 2% to about 15%, and more specifically, from about 7% to about 11%,<br>
by weight of the gum base.<br>
The gum base may also include plasticizers or softeners to provide a variety of<br>
desirable textures and consistency properties. Because of the low molecular weight of these<br>
ingredients, the plasticizers and softeners are able to penetrate the fundamental structure of<br>
the gum base making it plastic and less viscous. Useful plasticizers and softeners include<br>
lanolin, palmitic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, sodium stearate, potassium stearate, glyceryl<br>
triacetate, glyceryl lecithin, glyceryl monostearate, propylene glycol monostearate, acetylated<br>
monoglyceride, glycerine, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Waxes, for example, natural<br>
and synthetic waxes, hydrogenated vegetable oils, petroleum waxes such as polyurethane<br>
waxes, polyethylene waxes, paraffin waxes, microcrystalline waxes, fatty waxes, sorbitan<br>
46<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
monostearate, tallow, propylene glycol, mixtures thereof, and the like, may also be<br>
incorporated into the gum base. The plasticizers and softeners are generally employed in the<br>
gum base in amounts up to about 20% by weight of the gum base, and more specifically in<br>
amounts from about 9% to about 17%, by weight of the gum base.<br>
Plasticizers also include hydrogenated vegetable oils, such as soybean oil and<br>
cottonseed oils, which may be employed alone or in combination. These plasticizers provide<br>
the gum base with good texture and soft chew characteristics. These plasticizers and<br>
softeners are generally employed in amounts from about 5% to about 14%, and more<br>
specifically in amounts from about 5% to about 13.5%, by weight of the gum base.<br>
Anhydrous glycerin may also be employed as a softening agent, such as the<br>
commercially available United States Pharmacopeia (USP) grade. Glycerin is a syrupy liquid<br>
with a sweet warm taste and has a sweetness of about 60% of that of cane sugar. Because<br>
glycerin is hygroscopic, the anhydrous glycerin may be maintained under anhydrous<br>
conditions throughout the preparation of the chewing gum composition.<br>
In some embodiments, the gum base may also include effective amounts of bulking<br>
agents such as mineral adjuvants which may serve as fillers and textural agents. Useful<br>
mineral adjuvants include calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, alumina, aluminum<br>
hydroxide, aluminum silicate, talc, tricalcium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate, calcium<br>
sulfate and the like, and mixtures thereof. These fillers or adjuvants may be used in the gum<br>
base compositions in various amounts. Preferably the amount of filler, when used, will be<br>
present in an amount from about 15% to about 40%, and desirably from about 20% to about<br>
30%, by weight of the gum base.<br>
A variety of traditional ingredients may be optionally included in the gum base in<br>
effective amounts such as flavor agents and coloring agents, antioxidants, preservatives, and<br>
the like. For example, titanium dioxide and other dyes suitable for food, drug and cosmetic<br>
applications, known as F. D. &amp; C. dyes, may be utilized. An anti-oxidant such as butylated<br>
hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), propyl gallate, vitamin E and<br>
mixtures thereof, may also be included. Other conventional chewing gum additives known to<br>
one having ordinary skill in the chewing gum art may also be used in the gum base.<br>

WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
The chewing gum compositions may include amounts of conventional additives<br>
selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, plasticizers, softeners, emulsifiers,<br>
waxes, fillers, bulking agents (carriers, extenders, bulk sweeteners), mineral adjuvants, flavor<br>
agents and coloring agents, antioxidants, acidulants, thickeners, medicaments, oral care<br>
actives, such as remineralization agents, antimicrobials and tooth whitening agents, as<br>
described in assignee's co-pending U.S. Patent Application No. 10/901,511, filed on July 29,<br>
2004 and entitled "Tooth Whitening Compositions and Delivery Systems Therefor," which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Some of<br>
these additives may serve more than one purpose. For example, in sugarless gum<br>
compositions, a sweetener, such as maltitol or other sugar alcohol, may also function as a<br>
bulking agent.<br>
Bulk sweeteners include sugars, sugarless bulk sweeteners, or the like, or mixtures<br>
thereof. Bulk sweeteners generally are present in amounts of about 5% to about 99% by<br>
weight of the chewing gum composition. Suitable sugar sweeteners and sugarless bulk<br>
sweeteners, as well as intense sweeteners are provided above in the description of the<br>
potentiator compositions.<br>
In general, an effective amount of intense sweetener may be utilized to provide the<br>
level of sweetness desired, and this amount may vary with the sweetener selected. The<br>
intense sweetener may be present in amounts from about 0.001% to about 3%, by weight of<br>
the chewing gum composition, depending upon the sweetener or combination of sweeteners<br>
used. The exact range of amounts for each type of sweetener may be selected by those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
In some embodiments, the chewing gum composition may include a sweetener<br>
selected from Lo han guo, stevia, monatin and combinations thereof.<br>
Any of the flavor agents discussed above as being suitable for use in the potentiator<br>
compositions also may be used in the chewing gum compositions. In chewing gum<br>
compositions, flavor agents generally may be present in amounts from about 0.02% to about<br>
5%, and more specifically from about 0.1% to about 4%, and even more specifically, from<br>
about 0.8% to about 3%, by weight of the composition.<br>
48<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
Coloring agents may be used in amounts effective to produce the desired color. The<br>
coloring agents may include pigments which may be incorporated in amounts up to about<br>
6%, by weight of the composition. For example, titanium dioxide may be incorporated in<br>
amounts up to about 2%, and preferably less than about 1%, by weight of the composition.<br>
The colorants may also include natural food colors and dyes suitable for food, drug and<br>
cosmetic applications. Suitable coloring agents are set forth above in the description of<br>
confectionery compositions.<br>
The plasticizers, softening agents, mineral adjuvants, waxes and antioxidants<br>
discussed above, as being suitable for use in the gum base, may also be used in the chewing<br>
gum composition. Examples of other conventional additives which may be used include<br>
emulsifiers, such as lecithin and glyceryl monostearate, thickeners, used alone or in<br>
combination with other softeners, such as methyl cellulose, alginates, carrageenan, xanthan<br>
gum, gelatin, carob, tragacanth, locust bean, and carboxy methyl cellulose, acidulants such as<br>
malic acid, adipic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, fumaric acid, and mixtures thereof, and<br>
fillers, such as those discussed above under the category of mineral adjuvants.<br>
Other conventional gum additives known to one having ordinary skill in the chewing<br>
gum art also may be used in the chewing gum compositions.<br>
In some embodiments, the potentiator composition included in the chewing gum<br>
composition may include at least one active substance having a first solubility and at least<br>
one taste potentiator having a second solubility. The first and second solubilities may be<br>
substantially similar or different and may be selected to provide a controlled-release profile to<br>
the chewing gum composition. In particular, the selected solubilities may provide one of the<br>
following release profiles: simultaneous release, sequential release or partially overlapping<br>
release.<br>
Some embodiments extend to methods of preparing a chewing gum product. The<br>
products may be prepared using standard techniques and equipment known to those skilled in<br>
the art. The apparatus useful in accordance with the embodiments described herein includes<br>
mixing and heating apparatus well known in the chewing gum manufacturing arts, and<br>
therefore the selection of the specific apparatus will be apparent to the artisan. For general<br>
chewing gum preparation processes see U.S. Patent Nos. 4,271,197 to Hopkins et al,<br>
49<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
4,352,822 to Cherukuri et al and 4,497,832 to Cherukuri et al, each of which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
More specifically, in accordance with some embodiments, at least one encapsulant<br>
and at least one taste potentiator may be mixed to form a dispersion of the components. In<br>
particular, the encapsulant(s) may be melted at elevated temperatures in a high shear mixer.<br>
The potentiator(s) may be added to the molten encapsulant and mixed under high shear to<br>
completely disperse the components. The components may be mixed at elevated<br>
temperatures of about 50-150°C. The resulting mixture of components may be cooled. A<br>
plurality of encapsulated taste potentiator particles subsequently may be formed from the<br>
mixture. The particles may be formed to an appropriate size as desired, generally from an<br>
average particle size range of about 50 µm to about 800 µm. This may be accomplished by<br>
any suitable means such as chopping, pulverizing, milling or grinding the particles.<br>
Alternatively, the encapsulated particles may be prepared by spray drying methods.<br>
More specifically, the encapsulant(s) may be dissolved in water. In some embodiments, this<br>
solution may be prepared in an agitated vessel. The taste potentiator(s) then may be<br>
dispersed in the solution. The solution, or suspension, may be spray dried using a spray dryer<br>
fitted with an air atomized nozzle at elevated temperatures to form the encapsulated particles.<br>
In other embodiments, the encapsulated particles may be prepared by any suitable<br>
spray coating method as known in the art. One suitable process is the Wurster process. This<br>
process provides a method for encapsulating individual particulate materials. First, the<br>
particles to be encapsulated are suspended in a fluidizing air stream, which provides a<br>
generally cyclic flow in front of a spray nozzle. The spray nozzle sprays an atomized flow of<br>
the coating solution, which may include the encapsulant(s) and a suitable solvent. The<br>
atomized coating solution collides with the particles as they are carried away from the nozzle<br>
to provide a particle coating with the coating solution. The temperature of the fluidizing air<br>
stream, which also serves to suspend the particles to be coated, may be adjusted to evaporate<br>
the solvent shortly after the coating solution contacts the particles. This serves to solidify the<br>
coating on the particles, resulting in the desired encapsulated particle.<br>
In some embodiments, at least one active substance may be combined in the first step<br>
of the process along with the encapsulant(s) and the taste potentiator(s) to form a dispersion<br>
50<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
of all the components. The active substance(s) thereby may be encapsulated with the taste<br>
potentiator(s) to form an encapsulated mixture of the components.<br>
Once the encapsulated particles are obtained, they may be added to a chewing gum<br>
composition. Such encapsulated particles also may be added to confectionery compositions<br>
to prepare any of the confectionery products described above. The chewing gum composition<br>
may be prepared using standard techniques and equipment, as described above. The<br>
encapsulated particles may be added to the chewing gum composition to enhance the<br>
perception of at least one active substance contained therein, which may be any of the actives<br>
described above. Once the encapsulated particles are mixed into the chewing gum<br>
composition, individual chewing gum pieces may be formed using standard techniques<br>
known in the chewing gum art. For instance, chewing gum pieces may be prepared in the<br>
form of a slab, pellet, stick, center-fill gum, deposited, compressed chewing gum or any other<br>
suitable format.<br>
For instance, center-fill chewing gum embodiments may include a center-fill region,<br>
which may be a liquid or powder or other solid, and a gum region. Some embodiments also<br>
may include an outer gum coating or shell, which typically provides a cranchiness to the<br>
piece when initially chewed. The outer coating or shell may at least partially surround the<br>
gum region. The potentiator compositions described above may be incorporated into any of<br>
the regions of the center-fill chewing gum, i.e., the center-fill region, gum region and/or outer<br>
coating of the gum. Alternatively, the taste potentiator(s) may be incorporated into one<br>
region while the active substance(s) is incorporated into a different region of the center-fill<br>
gum. Upon consumption, the taste-potentiator(s) and active(s) may release from the different<br>
regions and combine as the gum is chewed. Center-fill chewing gums and methods of<br>
preparing same are more fully described in assignee's co-pending U.S. Patent Application<br>
No. 10/925,822,.filed on August 24, 2004 and assignee's co-pending U.S. Patent Application<br>
No. 11/210,954, filed on August 24, 2005, both entitled "Liquid-Filled Chewing Gum<br>
Composition," the contents both of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Some other chewing gum embodiments may be in a compressed gum format, such as,<br>
for example, a pressed tablet gum. Such embodiments may include a particulate chewing<br>
gum base, which may include a compressible gum base composition and a tableting powder,<br>
and any of the potentiator compositions described above. In such embodiments, the<br>
51<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
potentiator composition may be in a powdered form. Compressed chewing gums are more<br>
fully described in assignee's co-pending U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/734,680, filed<br>
on November 8,2005, and entitled "Compressible Gum System," the contents of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In some embodiments, the chewing gum may have a coating thereon. Such coated<br>
chewing gums are typically referred to as pellet gums. The outer coating may be hard or<br>
crunchy. Any suitable coating materials known to those skilled in the art may be employed.<br>
Typically, the outer coating may include sorbitol, maltitol, xylitol, isomalt, erythritol and<br>
other crystallizable polyols; sucrose may also be used. Furthermore the coating may include<br>
several opaque layers, such that the chewing gum composition is not visible through the<br>
coating itself, which can optionally be covered with a further one or more transparent layers<br>
for aesthetic, textural and protective purposes. The outer coating may also contain small<br>
amounts of water and gum arabic. The coating can be further coated with wax. The coating<br>
may be applied in a conventional manner by successive applications of a coating solution,<br>
with drying in between each coat. As the coating dries it usually becomes opaque and is<br>
usually white, though other colorants may be added. A polyol coating can be further coated<br>
with wax. The coating can further include colored flakes or speckles. If the composition<br>
includes a coating, it is possible that one or more oral care actives can be dispersed<br>
throughout the coating. This is especially preferred if one or more oral care actives is<br>
incompatible in a single phase composition with another of the actives. Flavors may also be<br>
added to yield unique product characteristics.<br>
Other materials may be added to the coating to achieve desired properties. These<br>
materials may include without limitations, cellulosics such as carboxymethyl cellulose,<br>
gelatin, xanthan gum and gum arabic.<br>
The coating composition may be applied by any method known in the art including<br>
the method described above. The coating composition may be present in an amount from<br>
about 2% to about 60%, more specifically from about 25% to about 45% by weight of the<br>
total chewing gum piece.<br>
Similarly, some embodiments extend to methods of preparing a taste potentiator<br>
composition having controlled-release upon consumption. In accordance therewith, at least<br>
52<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
one taste potentiator may first be provided. The taste potentiator(s) may be mixed with an<br>
encapsulant to form a composition having a dispersion of the components. Once the<br>
components are fully dispersed, a plurality of encapsulated taste potentiator particles may be<br>
formed from the composition, as described above. As a consequence of the encapsulation,<br>
the release rate of the potentiator(s) will be modified. The material for use as the encapsulant<br>
may be selected to provide either a delayed or increased release rate of the potentiator(s)<br>
upon consumption of the composition.<br>
The features and advantages of the present invention are more fully shown by the<br>
following examples which are provided for purposes of illustration, and are not to be<br>

formed into individual chewing gum pieces employing conventional techniques and<br>
packaged.<br>
Example 7:<br>
Sucrose Equivalent Value (SEV)<br>
One method of measuring the perceived sweetness of a solution is to match it with a<br>
stock sucrose solution of known concentration. In the present experiments, the compound of<br>
interest is added at a predetermined concentration to a pH 3.2 buffered solution containing<br>
5% sucrose. A number of expert panel members then taste the solution and compare it to a<br>
battery of stock sucrose solutions ranging from 3% to 15% at increments of 1%. Each panel<br>
member decides which sucrose solution is equisweet with the solution containing the<br>
56<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
compound of interest. The mean value is then reported as the SEV. Results are reported to 1<br>
decimal place.<br>
Dose Response Curve for 3-Hydroxybenzoic Acid<br>
In accordance with this methodology, 3-HB was added to a pH 3.2 buffered solution<br>
containing 5% sucrose to produce solutions containing from 0 to 1000ppm 3-HB in100ppm<br>
increments. The SEV for each solution was plotted on a graph to produce a dose response<br>
curve (Figure 1), from which it can be seen that 3-HB enhances the sweetness of the sucrose<br>
solution within this range. From Figure 1 it is apparent that as the dosage of 3-HB increases so<br>
does the sweetness of the resultant solution. However the effect is non-linear with each<br>
incremental addition having a diminishing effect. The maximum sweetness attainable would<br>
appear to be about 7.9% SEV (based on a 5% sucrose solution).<br>
Example 8:<br>
Dose Response Curve for 2,4-Dihydroxybenzoic Acid<br>
The same methodology as described in Example 7 was repeated with 2,4-DHB in place<br>
of 3-HB, to produce the dose response curve for 2,4-DHB (Figure 2). From Figure 2 it can be<br>
seen that 2,4-DHB also enhances the sweetness of the sucrose solution but there is little<br>
difference between the 400ppm solution (SEV 6.5%) and the lOOOppm solution (SEV 6.7%).<br>
The maximum attainable sweetness would appear to be about 6.7% SEV (based on a 5%<br>
sucrose solution).<br>
Example 9;<br>
Sucrose Reduction Method<br>
An alternative method of measuring perceived sweetness is to determine how much<br>
sucrose can be replaced through the use of the compound of interest without any perceived loss<br>
of sweetness. In the present experiments the control was a pH 3.2 buffered solution containing<br>
10% sucrose. The compound of interest is added at a predetermined concentration to a number<br>
of sucrose solutions containing from 5% to 10% sucrose at increments of 0.5%. Each panel<br>
member tastes each of the solutions, compares it to the control sample and decides which<br>
solutions are equisweet. For example, if the 8% sucrose solution containing the compound of<br>
57<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
interest is equisweet with the control, then the sucrose reduction achieved by the compound of<br>
interest is 20%.<br>
Effect of Relative Concentration on Sucrose Reduction for 3-HB, 2,4-DHB mixtures<br>
A series of sucrose solutions were prepared containing 3-HB and 2,4-DHB at a<br>
combined concentration of lOOOppm. Each solution was evaluated using the sucrose<br>
reduction method described above to determine how much sucrose could be replaced without<br>
noticeable loss of sweetness. The results are shown in Figure 3.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, the greatest reduction is observed when equal quantities of 3-<br>
HB and 2,4-DHB are employed. This ratio results in the very significant sucrose reduction of<br>
45%. This figure is highly surprising considering that the use of 1000ppm of 3-HB or 2,4-<br>
DHB individually results in a reduction of just 25% and 15% respectively. The other ratios 3-<br>
HB:2,4-DHB (8:2, 6:4,4:6 and 2:8) are also very effective; each combination results in a<br>
sucrose reduction of at least 35%.<br>
Example 10:<br>
Effect of Concentration on Sucrose Reduction for 1:13-HB:2,4-DHB mixtures<br>
A series of sucrose solutions were prepared containing equal quantities of 3-HB and<br>
2,4-DHB, at a combined concentration of 200,400,600, 800 and 1000ppm. Each solution was<br>
evaluated using the sucrose reduction method described in Example 9 above to determine how<br>
much sucrose could be replaced without noticeable loss of sweetness. The results are shown in<br>
Figure 4.<br>
Increasing the total quantity of 3-HB and 2,4-DHB while retaining a 1:1 ratio increases<br>
the sweetness enhancing effect. As shown above 500ppm 3-HB + 500ppm 2,4-DHB results in<br>
45% of the sucrose being replaced without loss of sweetness. However, the combination of 3-<br>
HB and 2,4-DHB is effective even at very low concentration. The use of just 200ppm of each<br>
of 3-HB and 2,4-DHB allows the sucrose content to be reduced by 22%.<br>

2,4,6-trihydroxybenzoic acid (2,4,6-THB)	5.4<br>
3,4,5-tryhydroxybenzoic acid (3,4,5-THB)	5.1<br>
500ppm of the sweetener potentiator then was added to a 5% sucrose solution<br>
containing 500ppm 3-HB to produce a series of solutions. The SEV for each solution was<br>
determined and the results are shown in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 5, the composition of<br>
one embodiment (hatched) is considerably more effective than any other combination with an<br>
SEV of 8.7%. The use of 500ppm of 3-HB alone results in an SEV of 6.9% whereas in all<br>
cases but two (2,4-DHB and 3,4-DHB) the addition of a second sweetener potentiator results in<br>
a little change or even a decrease in SEV. This is highly surprising considering that all of the<br>
potentiators are shown to have SEVs greater than 5%.<br>
The methodology was repeated to produce a series of solutions containing 500ppm 2,4-<br>
DHB and 500ppm of a second sweetener potentiator. The SEV for each solution was<br>
determined and the results are shown in Figure 6.<br>
Again the combination (hatched) of 3-HB and 2,4-DHB results in by far the greatest<br>
sweetness enhancement. It might be expected that 2-HB or 4-HB could be used in place of 3-<br>
59<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
HB but these combinations result in solutions with SEVs of just 6.3% and 6.2% respectively.<br>
The use of 500ppm 2,4-DHB alone results in a solution with an SEV of 6.5%. The addition of a<br>
second sweetener potentiator appears to inhibit its effect in most cases and only the addition of 3-<br>
HB has a significant positive effect.<br>
500ppm of 3-HB, 500ppm of 2,4-DHB and 500ppm of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-<br>
DHB) were added to a pH 3.2 buffered solution containing 5% sucrose and the SEV<br>
determined. The results are shown in Figure 7 together with other combinations of 3-HB, 2,4-<br>
DHB and 3,4-DHB for comparison. The solution containing the combination of 3-HB and 2,4-<br>
DHB (hatched) has a much higher SEV (8.7%) than the combination of either 3,4-DHB and 3-<br>
HB (7.6%) or the combination of 3,4-DHB and 2,4-DHB (6.8%). The three-way combination<br>
of the embodiment (hatched) is better still with an SEV of 9.8%.<br>
Example 12:<br>
Comparison of Different Forms of 2,4-DHB<br>
pH 3.2 buffered solutions were prepared containing 0%, 3%, 5%, 7% and 9% sucrose.<br>
500ppm of 2,4-DHB acid, 500ppm of the sodium salt of 2,4-DHB and 500ppm of the<br>
potassium salt of 2,4-DHB were added individually to each of the sucrose solutions. The SEV<br>
for each of the solutions was then determined. The results are shown in Figure 8.<br>
As shown in Figure 8, the addition of 2,4-DHB enhances the sweetness of the sucrose<br>
solution in every case regardless of the original sucrose solution or whether the acid, sodium salt<br>
or potassium salt is employed. The results for the acid, sodium salt and potassium salt are<br>
almost identical indicating that the sweetener potentiator composition may be prepared from<br>
the acids and/or from their comestible salts.<br>
Example 13;<br>
Sweetness Enhancing Effect of 3-HB and 2,4-DHB on Non-Sucrose Sweeteners<br>
Solutions were prepared at a pH of 3.2 containing a sufficient quantity of a non-sucrose<br>
sweetener so that the resulting solution had an SEV of about 5%. The SEV of each sweetener<br>
solution was then evaluated after the addition 500ppm of 3-HB, the addition of 500ppm of 2,4-<br>
DHB and the addition of both 500ppm 3-HB and 2,4-DHB. The results are shown in Figures 9<br>
and 10.<br>
60<br><br>
WO 2006/127936	PCT/US2006/020307<br>
Figure 9 shows the results of various intense sweeteners with 3-HB, 2,4-DHB and<br>
combinations thereof. As shown in Figure 9, the combination of 3-HB and 2,4-DHB with<br>
aspartame has a significant effect on SEV, which is greater than the use of either 3-HB or 2,4-<br>
DHB separately. Similarly, the combination of 3-HB and 2,4-DHB enhances the perceived<br>
sweetness of the acesulfame-K, aspartame/acesulfame-K, sucralose, sucralose/acesulfame-K,<br>
saccharin and neotame solutions. With respect to the saccharin solution, however, 3-HB<br>
enhances the sweetness to a greater degree alone than in combination with 2,4-DHB.<br>
Figure 10 shows the results of various bulk sweeteners with 3-HB, 2,4-DHB and<br>
combinations thereof. As seen in Figure 10, the combination of 3-HB and 2,4-DHB increases<br>
the SEV of the resultant solution when used with sucrose, fructose, tagatose, maltitol or glucose<br>
to a greater extent than either 3-HB or 2,4-DHB separately.<br>
Example 14:<br>
Sucrose Equivalent Values for Aminobenzoic Acid Derivatives<br>
500ppm of 3-aminobenzoic acid and 500ppm of 4-aminobenzoic acid were individually<br>
added to separate pH 3.2 buffered solutions containing 5% sucrose and the SEVs of the<br>
resultant solutions were determined. The SEV of 3-aminobenzoic acid was about 7%, i.e.,<br>
increased the sweetness intensity of 5% sucrose to about 7%. The SEV of 4-aminobenzoic acid<br>
was about 5.5-6%, i.e., increased the sweetness intensity of 5% sucrose to about 5.5-6%.<br>
