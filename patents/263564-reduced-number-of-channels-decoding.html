				<td>Reduced Number of Channels Decoding<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to decoding of audio signals<br>
and in particular to decoding of a parametric multi-channel<br>
downmix of an original multi-channel signal into a number<br>
of channels smaller than the number of channels of the<br>
original multi-channel signal.<br>
Background of the invention and prior art<br>
Recent development in audio coding has made available the<br>
ability to recreate a multi-channel representation of an<br>
audio signal based on a stereo (or mono) signal and<br>
corresponding control data. These methods differ<br>
substantially from older matrix based solutions such as<br>
Dolby Prologic, since additional control data is<br>
transmitted to control the re-creation, also referred to as<br>
upmix, of the surround channels based on the transmitted<br>
mono or stereo channels.<br>
Hence, such a parametric multi-channel audio decoder, e.g.<br>
MPEG Surround, reconstructs N channels based on M<br>
transmitted channels, where N &gt; M, and the additional<br>
control data. The additional control data represents a<br>
significant lower data rate than transmitting all N<br>
channels, making the coding very efficient while at the<br>
same time ensuring compatibility with both M channel<br>
devices and N channel devices.<br>
These parametric surround coding methods usually comprise a<br>
parameterization of the surround signal based on IID (Inter<br>
channel Intensity Difference) and ICC (Inter Channel<br>
Coherence). These parameters describe power ratios and<br><br>
correlation between channel pairs in the upmix process.<br>
Further parameters also used in prior art comprise<br>
prediction parameters used to predict intermediate or<br>
output channels during the upmix procedure.<br>
Two famous examples of such multi-channel coding are BCC<br>
coding and MPEG surround. In BCC encoding, a number of<br>
audio input channels are converted to a spectral<br>
representation using a DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform)<br>
based transform with overlapping windows. The resulting<br>
uniform spectrum is then divided into non-overlapping<br>
partitions. Each partition has a bandwidth proportional to<br>
the equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB). Then, spatial<br>
parameters called ICLD (Inter-Channel Level Difference) and<br>
ICTD (Inter-Channel Time Difference) are estimated for each<br>
partition. The ICLD parameter describes a level difference<br>
between two channels and the ICTD parameter describes the<br>
time difference (phase shift) between two signals of<br>
different channels. The level differences and the time<br>
differences are given for each channel with respect to a<br>
common reference channel. After the derivation of these<br>
parameters, the parameters are quantized and encoded for<br>
transmission.<br>
The individual parameters are estimated with respect to one<br>
single reference channel in BCC-coding. In other parametric<br>
surround coding systems, e.g. in MPEG surround, a tree-<br>
structured parameterization is used. This means, that the<br>
parameters are no longer estimated with respect to one<br>
single common reference channel but to different reference<br>
channels that may even be a combination of channels of the<br>
original multi-channel signal. For example, having a 5.1<br>
channel signal, parameters may be estimated between a<br>
combination of the front channels and between a combination<br>
of the back channels.<br>
Of course, backward compatibility to already established<br>
audio-standards is highly desirable also for the parametric<br><br>
coding schemes. For example, having a mono-downmix signal<br>
it is desirable to also provide a possibility to create a<br>
stereo-playback signal with high fidelity. This means that<br>
a monophonic downmix signal has to be upmixed into a stereo<br>
signal, making use of the additionally transmitted<br>
parameters in the best possible way.<br>
One common problem in multi-channel coding is energy<br>
preservation in the upmix, as the human perception of the<br>
spatial position of a sound-source is dominated by the<br>
loudness of the signal, i.e. by the energy contained within<br>
the signal. Therefore, utmost care must be taken in the<br>
reproduction of the signal to attribute the right loudness<br>
to each reconstructed channel such as to avoid the<br>
introduction of artifacts strongly decreasing the<br>
perceptional quality of the reconstructed signal. As during<br>
the downmix amplitudes of signals are commonly summed up,<br>
the possibility of interference arises, being described by<br>
the correlation- or coherence parameter.<br>
When it comes to the reconstruction of a reduced number of<br>
channels (a number of channels smaller than the original<br>
number of channels of the multi-channel signal), schemes<br>
like BCC are simple to handle, since every parameter is<br>
transmitted with respect to the same single reference<br>
channel. Therefore, having knowledge on the reference<br>
channel, the most relevant level information (absolute<br>
energy measure) can easily be derived for every channel<br>
needed for the upmix. Thus, reduced number of channels can<br>
be reconstructed without the need to reconstruct the full<br>
multi-channel signal first. Thus, the energy computations<br>
for the energies of the multichannel signal is easier in<br>
BCC by using single variables rather than products of<br>
variables, but this is only a first step. When it comes to<br>
deriving energies and correlations of a reduced number of<br>
channels which should come as close as possible to partial<br>
downmixes of the original multichannel signals, the level<br>
of difficulty in MPEG Surround and BCC is comparable.<br><br>
In contrast thereto, a tree-based structure as MPEG<br>
surround uses a parameterization in which the relevant<br>
information for each individual channel is not contained in<br>
a single parameter. Therefore, in prior art, reconstructing<br>
reduced numbers of channels requires the reconstruction of<br>
the multi channel signal followed by a downmix into the<br>
reduced numbers of channels to not violate the energy<br>
preservation requirement. This has the obvious disadvantage<br>
of extremely high computational complexity.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a<br>
concept for obtaining a reduced number of channels from a<br>
parametric multichannel signal more efficiently.<br>

signal having associated thereto multi-channel parameters<br>
describing spatial properties of the multi-channel signal,<br>

In accordance with a fifth aspect of the present invention,<br>

less channels than the multi-channel signal, the downmix<br>
signal having associated thereto multi-channel parameters<br>
describing spatial properties of the multi-channel signal,<br>
wherein the multi-channel signal includes channels not<br>

wherein the multi-channel parameters include information on<br>
the channels not included in the intermediate channel<br>
representation, the method comprising: deriving the upmix<br>
parameters from the multi-channel parameters using the<br>
parameters having information on channels not included in<br>
the intermediate channel representation.<br><br>
The present invention is based on the finding that an<br>
intermediate channel representation of a multi-channel<br>
signal can be reconstructed highly efficient and with high<br>
fidelity, when upmix parameters for upmixing a transmitted<br>
downmix signal to the intermediate channel representation<br>
are derived that allow for upmix using the same upmixing<br>
algorithms as within the multi-channel reconstruction. This<br>
can be achieved when a parameter re-calculator is used to<br>
derive the upmix parameters taking also into account<br>
parameters having information on channels not included in<br>
the intermediate channel representation.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, a decoder is<br>
capable of reconstructing a stereo output signal from a<br>
parametric downmix of a 5-channel multi-channel signal, the<br>
parametric downmix comprising a monophonic downmix signal<br>
and associated multi-channel parameters. According to the<br>
invention, the spatial parameters are combined to derive<br>
upmix parameters for the upmix of a stereo signal, wherein<br>
the combination also takes into account multi-channel<br>
parameters not associated to the left-front or the right-<br>
front channel. Hence, absolute powers for the upmixed<br>
stereo-channels can be derived and a coherence measure<br>
between the left and the right channel can be derived<br>
allowing for a high fidelity stereo reconstruction of the<br>
multi-channel signal. Moreover, an ICC parameter and a CLD<br>
parameter are derived allowing for an upmixing using<br>
already existing algorithms and implementations. Using<br>
parameters of channels not associated to the reconstructed<br>
stereo-channels allows for the preservation of the energy<br>
within the signal with higher accuracy. This is of most<br>
importance, as uncontrolled loudness variations are<br>
disturbing the quality of the playback signal most.<br>
Generally, the application of the inventive concept allows<br>
a reconstruction of a stereo upmix from a mono-downmix of a<br>
multi-channel signal without the need of an intermediate<br><br>
full reconstruction of the multi-channel signal, as in<br>
prior art methods. Evidently, the computational complexity<br>
on the decoder side can thus be decreased significantly.<br>
Using also multi-channel parameters associated to channels<br>
not included in the upmix (i.e. the left front and the<br>
right front channel) allows for a reconstruction that does<br>
not introduce any additional artifacts or loudness-<br>
variations but preserves the energy of the signal perfectly<br>
instead. To be more specific, the ratio of the energy<br>
between the left and the right reconstructed channel is<br>
calculated from numerous available multi-channel<br>
parameters, taking also into account multi-channel<br>
parameters not associated to the left front and the right<br>
front channel. Evidently, the loudness ratio between the<br>
left and the right reconstructed (upmixed) channel is<br>
dominant with respect to the listening quality of the<br>
reconstructed stereo signal. Without using the inventive<br>
concept a reconstruction of channels having the precisely<br>
correct energy ratio is not possible in tree-based<br>
structures discussed within this document.<br>
Therefore, implementing the inventive concept allows for a<br>
high-quality stereo-reproduction of a downmix of a multi-<br>
channel signal based on multi-channel parameters, which are<br>
not derived for a precise reproduction of a stereo signal.<br>
It should be noted, that the inventive concept may also be<br>
used when the number of reproduced channels is other than<br>
two, for example when a center-channel shall also be<br>
reconstructed with high fidelity, as it is the case in some<br>
playback environments.<br>
A more detailed review of the prior art multi-channel<br>
encoding schemes (particularly of tree-based structures)<br>
will be given within the following to outline the high<br>
benefit of the inventive concept.<br><br>

Detailed description of preferred embodiments<br>
The inventive concept will in the following be described<br>
mainly with respect to MPEG coding, but is as well<br>
applicable to other schemes based on parametric coding of<br>
multi-channel signals. That is the embodiments described<br>
below are merely illustrative for the principles of the<br>
present invention for reduced number of channels decoding<br>
for tree-structured multi-channel systems. It is<br><br>
understood that modifications and variations of the<br>
arrangements and the details described herein will be<br>
apparent to others skilled in the art. It is the intent,<br>
therefore, to be limited only by the scope of the<br>
impending patent claims and not by the specific details<br>
presented by way of description and explanation of the<br>
embodiments herein.<br>
As mentioned above, in some parametric surround coding<br>
systems, e.g. MPEG Surround, a tree-structured<br>
parameterization is used. Such a parameterization is<br>
sketched in Figs. 1 and Fig. 2.<br>
Fig. 1 shows two ways of parameterizing a standard 5.1<br>
channel audio scenario, having a left front channel 2, a<br>
center channel 3, a right front channel 4, a left surround<br>
channel 5 and a right surround channel 6. Optionally, a<br>
low-frequency enhancement channel 7 (LFE) may also be<br>
present.<br>
Generally, the individual channels or channel pairs are<br>
characterized with respect to each other by multi-channel<br>
parameters, such as for example a correlation parameter ICC<br>
and a level parameter CLD. Possible parameterizations will<br>
be shortly explained in the following paragraph, the<br>
resulting tree-structured decoding schemes are then<br>
illustrated in Fig. 2.<br>
In the example shown in the left side of Fig. 1 (5-1-51<br>
parameterization) , the multi-channel signal is<br>
characterized by CLD and ICC parameters describing the<br>
relation between the left surround channel 5 and the right<br>
surround channel 6, the left front channel 2 and the right<br>
front channel 4 and between the center channel 3 and the<br>
low-frequency enhancement channel 7. However, as the whole<br>
configuration shall be downmixed into one single mono<br>
channel, for a full description of the set of channels,<br>
additional parameters are required. Therefore, additional<br><br>
parameters (CLD1, ICC1) are used, relating a combination of<br>
the LFE-speaker 7 and the center speaker 3 to a combination<br>
of the left front channel 2 and the right front channel 4.<br>
Furthermore, one additional set of parameters (CLD0, ICC0)<br>
is required, those parameters describing a relation between<br>
the combined surround channels 5 and 6 to the rest of the<br>
channels of the multi-channel signal.<br>
In the parameterization on the right side (5-1-52<br>
parameterization) parameters are used, relating the left<br>
front channel 2 and the left surround channel 5, the right<br>
front channel 4 and the right surround channel 6 and the<br>
center channel 3 and the low-frequency enhancement channel<br>
7. Additional parameters (CLD1 and ICC1) describe a<br>
combination of the left channels 2 and 5 with respect to a<br>
combination of the right channels 4 and 6. A further set of<br>
parameters (CLD0 and ICC0) describes the relation of a<br>
combination of the center channel 3 and the LFE-channel 7<br>
with respect to a combination of the remaining channels.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates the coding concepts underlying the<br>
different parameterizations of Fig. 1. At the decoder side<br>
so called OTT (One To Two) modules are used in a tree-like<br>
structure. Every OTT module upmixes a mono-signal into two<br>
output signals. When decoding, the parameters for the OTT<br>
boxes have to be applied in the reverse order as in<br>
encoding. Therefore, in the 5-1-51 tree structure, OTT<br>
module 20, receiving the downmix signal 22 (M) is operative<br>
to use parameters CLD0 and ICC0 to derive two channels, one<br>
being a combination of the left surround channel 5 and the<br>
right surround channel 6 and the other channel being still<br>
a combination of the remaining channels of the multi-<br>
channel signal.<br>
Accordingly, OTT module 24 derives, using CLD1 and ICC1,<br>
first channel being a combined channel of the center<br>
channel 3 and the low-frequency channel 7 and a second<br>
channel being a combination of the left front channel 2 and<br><br>
the right front channel 4. In the same way, OTT module 26<br>
derives the left surround channel 5 and the right surround<br>
channel 6, using CLD2 and ICC2. OTT module 27 derives the<br>
center channel 3 and the low-frequency channel 7, using<br>
CLD4 and OTT module 28 derives the left front channel 2 and<br>
the right front channel 4, using CLD3 and ICC3. Finally, a<br>
reconstruction of the full set of channels 30 is derived<br>
from a single monophonic downmix channel 22. For the 5-1-52<br>
tree structure, the general layout of the OTT module is<br>
equivalent to the 5-1-51 tree structure. However, the<br>
single OTT modules derive different channel combinations,<br>
the channel combinations corresponding to the<br>
parameterization outlined in Fig. 1 for the 5-1-52-case.<br>
It becomes evident from Figs. 1 and 2, that the tree-<br>
structure of the different parameterizations is only a<br>
visualization for the parameterization used. It is<br>
furthermore important to note that the individual<br>
parameters are parameters describing a relation between<br>
different channels in contrast to, for example, the BCC-<br>
coding scheme, wherein similar parameters are derived with<br>
respect to one single reference channel.<br>
Therefore, in the parameterizations shown, individual<br>
channels cannot be simply derived using the parameters<br>
associated to the OTT-boxes in the visualization, but some<br>
or all of the remaining parameters have to be taken into<br>
account additionally.<br>
The tree-structure of the parameterization is only a<br>
visualization for actual signal flow or processing shown in<br>
Fig. 3, illustrating the upmix from a transmitted low<br>
number of channels is achieved by matrix multiplication.<br>
Fig. 3 shows decoding based on a received downmixed channel<br>
40. The downmixed channel 40 is input into an upmix block<br>
42 deriving the reconstructed multi-channel signal 44,<br>
wherein the channel composition differs between the<br>
parameterizations used. The matrix elements of the matrix<br><br>
used by the reconstruction block 42 are, however, directly<br>
derived from the tree-structure. The reconstruction block<br>
42 may, for illustrative purposes only, be further<br>
decomposed into a pre-decorrelator matrix 4 6, deriving<br>
additional decorrelated signals from the transmitted<br>
channel 40. These are then input into a mix matrix 48<br>
deriving multi-channel signals 44 by mixing the individual<br>
input channels.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, a straightforward approach to reduce<br>
the number of reconstructed channels would be to simply<br>
"prune" the tree of the one to two boxes. Fig. 4<br>
illustrates a possible pruning of the trees by dashed<br>
lines, the pruning omitting OTT modules at the right hand<br>
side of the tree during reconstruction, thus reducing the<br>
number of output channels. However, using prior art<br>
parameterizations of shown in Figs. 1 and 2, introduced<br>
because they offer low-bit rate coding at highest possible<br>
quality, simple pruning is not possible to obtain a stereo<br>
output representing a left side downmix and a right side<br>
downmix of the original multichannel signal properly. Fig.<br>
5 shows a prior art approach of creating a stereo output<br>
from the signals described above, using the obvious<br>
approach of first reconstructing the multi-channel signal<br>
completely before subsequently downmixing the signal into<br>
the stereo representation using an additional downmixer 60.<br>
This has evidently several disadvantages, such as high<br>
complexity and inferior sound quality.<br>
A solution to the afore-mentioned problem of obtaining<br>
stereo output from a mono downmix and parametric surround<br>
parameters in a parameterization that does not naturally<br>
support "pruning" down to a stereo output will in the<br>
following be derived for the general case. This is followed<br>
by two specific embodiments showing the use of the<br>
inventive concept in the parameterizations described above.<br>
Thus, solutions are provided to the problem of obtaining<br>
stereo output from a mono downmix and parametric surround<br><br>
parameters in a parameterization that does not support<br>
"pruning" down to a stereo output.<br>
The general approach of the parameter recalculation will be<br>
outlined below. In particular, it applies to the case of<br>
computing stereo output parameters from an arbitrary number<br>
of multi-channel audio channels N. It is furthermore<br>
assumed that the audio signal is described by a subband<br>
representation, derived using a filter bank that could be<br>
real valued or complex modulated.<br>
Let all signals considered be finite vectors of subband<br>
samples corresponding to a time frequency tile defined by<br>
the spatial parameters and let the subband samples of a<br>
reconstructed multi-channel audio signal y be formed from<br>
subband samples of audio channels ml,m2,...,mM and decorrelated<br>
subband samples of audio channels d1,d2,...,dD according to a<br>
matrix upmix operation<br><br>
All signals are regarded as row vectors. The matrix R is<br>
of size Nx(M+D) and represents the combined effect of the<br>
matrices Ml and M2 of Figure 3 and as such the upmix block<br>
42. A general method for achieving suitable power and<br>
correlation parameters of a downmixed version to ND channels<br>
of the original multichannel audio signal subband samples<br>
is to form the covariance matrix of the virtual downmix<br>
defined by a NDxN downmix matrixD,<br><br><br>
This covariance matrix can be computed by multiplication<br>
with complex conjugate transposed to be<br><br>
where the inner covariance matrix xx* is often known from<br>
the properties of decorrelators and the transmitted<br>
parameters.<br>
An important special case where this holds true is for<br>
M=1, and frequently this inner covariance matrix is then<br>
actually equal to the identity matrix of size M + D. As a<br>
consequence, for a stereo output where ND=2, the CLD and<br>
ICC parameters can be read from<br><br>
in the sense that<br><br>
Note that here and in the following, the following<br>
notation is applied. For complex vectors x,y, the complex<br>
inner product and squared norm is defined by<br><br>
where the star denotes complex conjugation.<br><br>
Subsequently, two embodiments of the present invention<br>
shall be derived for the different parameterizations (5-1-<br>
51 and 5-1-52) shown in Figs. 1 and 2. In the embodiments<br>
of the present invention it is taught that in order to<br>
output stereo signals based on a mono downmix and<br>
corresponding MPEG surround parameters (multi-channel<br>
parameters), upmix-parameters need to be recalculated to a<br>
single set of CLD and ICC parameters that can be used for a<br>
direct upmix of a stereo signal from the mono signal.<br>
It is furthermore assumed that the processing of the<br>
individual audio channels is done frame wise, i.e. in<br>
discrete time portions. Thus, when talking about powers or<br>
energies contained within one channel, the term "power" or<br>
"energy" is to be understood as the energy or power<br>
contained within one frame of one specific channel.<br>
Generally, parameters as for example CLD and ICC are also<br>
valid for one single frame. Having a frame with k sample<br>
values αi, the energy E within the frame can for example be<br>
represented by the squared sum of the subband sample values<br>
within the frame:<br><br>
Channel level differences (CLD) transmitted and used for<br>
the calculation of upmix parameters for upmixing the<br>
downmix signal M into an intermediate channel<br>
representation (stereo) of the multi-channel signal are<br>
defined as follows:<br><br><br>
wherein L0 and R0 denote the power of the signals in<br>
question within the frame for which the parameter CLD shall<br>
be derived.<br>
Therefore, for the 5-1-5x case, the four CLD parameters<br>
CLDX, X = 0,1,2,3, can be used to obtain channel powers<br>
normalized by the power of the mono downmix channel m .<br><br>
The channel gains are defined by<br><br>
The final goal is to derive optimal stereo channels l0 and<br>
r0 in the sense that appropriate estimates of the<br>
normalized powers and correlation of the stereo channels<br>
(intermediate channel representation) formed by<br><br>
are found, wherein the center downmix weight is q = 1/√2 .<br>
Computing powers from this assumption gives the result<br><br><br>
It turns out to be most advantageous to assume that both<br>
the combined left channel / and the combined right channel<br>
rare uncorrelated with the center channel c, rather than<br>
attempting to incorporate the correlation information<br>
carried by the parameters ICC1XM, X = 0.1. The normalized<br>
powers of the stereo output channels are therefore<br>
estimated by<br><br>
Having derived the powers of the output channels, the<br>
desired CLD parameter can easily be computed using the<br>
definition of the CLD parameter given above.<br>
According to the inventive concept, an ICC parameter is<br>
derived to allow a stereo upmix. The correlation between<br>
the two output channels is defined by the following<br>
expression:<br><br>
An attractive set of simplifying assumptions is here again<br>
that the combined left channel / and the combined right<br>
channel r are uncorrelated with the center channel c , and<br>
moreover that the surround channels are uncorrelated with<br>
the front channels. These assumptions can be expressed by<br><br>
The resulting estimate for p depends on the two ICC<br>
parameters ICCX, X = 2,3, which describe normalized<br>
left/right correlations<br><br><br>
which can be written out as<br><br>
Thus, the final correlation value depends on numerous<br>
parameters of the multi-channel parameterization, allowing<br>
for the high fidelity reconstruction of the signal. The ICC<br>
parameter is finally derived using the following formula:<br><br>
According to the inventive concept, the power distribution<br>
between the reconstructed channels is reconstructed with<br>
high accuracy. However, a global power scaling applied to<br>
both channels may be additionally necessary, to assure for<br>
overall energy preservation. As the relative energy<br>
distribution between the channels is vital for the spatial<br>
perception of the reconstructed signal, global scaling may<br>
deteriorate the perceptual quality of the reconstructed<br>
signal. It is to be emphasized that the global scaling is<br>
only global inside a parameter defined time-frequency tile.<br>
This means that wrong scalings will affect the signal<br>
locally at the scale of parameter tiles. In other words<br>
both frequency and time depending gains will be applied<br>
which lead to both spectral colorization and time<br>
modulation artifacts. A gain adjustment factor for global<br>
scaling is necessary to assure that the stereo upmix<br>
process is preserving the power of the mono downmix channel<br>
m .<br>
However, this factor is defined by   which<br>
amounts to g=1 for the 5-1-51 configuration, since<br>
Zo + RQ = Lf + Rf +C + Ls + Rs =1.<br><br>
As a further embodiment, the application of the inventive<br>
concept to the 5-1-52 tree-structure will be outlined<br>
within the following paragraphs. For the creation of a<br>
high-fidelity stereo signal, the two first CLD and ICC<br>
parameter sets corresponding to the top branches of the<br>
tree are relevant.<br>
The two CLD parameters CLDX for X = 0,1, are used first to<br>
obtain normalized channel powers of the combined left and<br>
right channels and the center channel<br><br>
where the channel gains are defined by<br><br>
The goal is to derive the powers and correlation of the<br>
downmix channels<br><br>
where the center downmix weight is q = 1/√2 . Computing<br>
powers from this assumption gives the result<br><br>
An advantageous assumption is here that both the ICC<br>
between the channels / and c and between channels r and<br>
c is the same as the given ICC0 between the channels l+r and<br>
c. This assumption leads to the estimates<br><br><br><br><br>
The required gain adjustment factor g is defined by:<br><br>
It may be noted, that the generated CLD and ICC parameters<br>
may further be quantized, to enable the use of lookup<br>
tables in the decoder for upmix matrix creation rather than<br>
performing the complex calculations. This further increases<br>
the efficiency of the upmix process.<br>
Generally, upmix is possible using already existing OTT<br>
modules. This has the advantage that the inventive concept<br>
can be easily implemented in already existing decoding<br>
scenarios.<br>
Generally, the upmix matrix can be described as follows:<br><br>
where<br><br>
and where:<br><br>
Therefore, having inventively derived the parameters CLD<br>
and ICC, stereo upmix of a transmitted downmix can be<br>
performed with high fidelity using standard upmix modules.<br><br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, an<br>
inventive Channel reconstructor comprises a parameter<br>
calculator for deriving upmix parameters and an upmixer for<br>
deriving an intermediate channel representation using the<br>
upmix parameters and a transmitted downmix signal.<br>
The inventive concept is again outlined in Fig. 6, showing<br>
an inventive parameter calculator 502, receiving numerous<br>
ICC parameters 504 and numerous CLD parameters 506.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
inventive parameter calculator 502 derives a single CLD<br>
parameter 508 and a single ICC parameter 510 for the<br>
recreation of a stereo signal, using also multi-channel<br>
parameters (ICC and CLD) having information on channels not<br>
included or related to channels of the stereo-upmix.<br>
It may be noted, that the inventive concept can easily be<br>
adapted to scenarios with an upmix comprising more than two<br>
channels. The upmix is in that sense generally defined as<br>
an intermediate channel representation of the multi-channel<br>
signal, wherein the intermediate channel representation has<br>
more channels than the downmix signal and less channels<br>
than the multi-channel signal. One common scenario is a<br>
configuration in which an additional center channel is<br>
reconstructed.<br>
The application of the inventive concept is again outlined<br>
in Fig. 7, showing an inventive parameter calculator 502<br>
and a 1-to-2 box OTT 520. The OTT box 520 receives as input<br>
the transmitted mono signal 522, as already detailed in<br>
Fig. 6. The inventive parameter calculator 502 receives<br>
several ICC values 504 and several CLD values 506 to derive<br>
a single CLD parameter 508 and a single ICC parameter 510.<br>
The single CLD and ICC parameters 508 and 510 are input in<br>
the OTT module 520 to steer the upmix of the monophonic<br>
downmix signal 522. Thus, at the output of the OTT module<br><br>
520, a stereo signal 524 can be provided as an intermediate<br>
channel representation of the multi-channel signal.<br>
Fig. 8 shows an inventive receiver or audio player 600,<br>
having an inventive audio decoder 601, a bit stream<br>
input 602, and an audio output 604.<br>
A bit stream can be input at the input 602 of the inventive<br>
receiver/audio player 600., The decoder 601 then decodes the<br>
bit stream and the decoded signal is output or played at<br>
the output 604 of the inventive receiver/audio player 600.<br>
Although the inventive concept has been outlined mainly<br>
with respect to MPEG surround coding, it is of course by no<br>
means limited to the application to the specific parametric<br>
coding scenario. Because of the high flexibility of the<br>
inventive concept, it can be easily applied to other coding<br>
schemes as well, such as for example to 7.1 or 7.2 channel<br>
configurations or BCC schemes.<br>
Although the embodiments of the present invention relating<br>
to MPEG-coding introduce some simplifying assumptions for<br>
the generation of the common CLD and ICC parameter, this is<br>
not mandatory. It is of course also possible to not<br>
introduce those simplifications.<br>
Depending on certain implementation requirements of the<br>
inventive methods, the inventive methods can be<br>
implemented in hardware or in software. The implementation<br>
can be performed using a digital storage medium, in<br>
particular a disk, DVD or a CD having electronically<br>
readable control signals stored thereon, which cooperate<br>
with a programmable computer system such that the<br>
inventive methods are performed. Generally, the present<br>
invention is, therefore, a computer program product with a<br>
program code stored on a machine readable carrier, the<br>
program code being operative for performing the inventive<br>
methods when the computer program product runs on a<br><br>
computer. In other words, the inventive methods are,<br>
therefore, a computer program having a program code for<br>
performing at least one of the inventive methods when the<br>
computer program runs on a computer.<br>
While the foregoing has been particularly shown and<br>
described with reference to particular embodiments<br>
thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art<br>
that various other changes in the form and details may be<br>
made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.<br>
It is to be understood that various changes may be made in<br>
adapting to different embodiments without departing from<br>
the broader concepts disclosed herein and comprehended by<br>
the claims that follow.<br><br>

downmix signal to the intermediate channel representation are derived that allow for an upmix using the same upmixing algorithms as within the multi-channel reconstruction. This<br>
can be achieved when a parameter re-calculator is used to derive the upmix parameters that takes into account also parameters having information on channels that are not included in the intermediate channel representation.</td>
