GROOVED METAL TUBES<br>
Field of the invention<br>
. The invention relates to grooved metal tubes in the field of heat exchanger tubes, and more specifically, to the field of heat exchangers operating in evaporation/condensation and in reversible mode.<br>
State of the art<br>
A large number of documents disclosing the geometry of grooved tubes used in heat exchangers are known.<br>
For example, it is possible to mention the patent application EP-A2- 0 148 609 which discloses triangular or trapezoidal grooved tubes comprising the following characteristics :<br>
an H/Di ratio between 0.02 and 0.03, where H refers to the depth of the grooves (or<br>
height of the ribbing), and Di the inner diameter of the grooved tube,<br>
a helical angle {3 with reference to the tube axis between 7 and 30°,<br>
an S/H ratio between 0.15 and 0.40, where S refers to the cross-section of the groove,<br>
an apex angle a of the ribbing between 30 and 60°.<br>
These tube characteristics are suitable for phase transition fluids, the tube performances being analysed clearly when the fluid evaporates or when the fluid condenses.<br><br>
2<br>
The Japanese application No. 57-580088 discloses V-shaped grooved tubes, with H between 0.02 and 0.2 mm and an angle   between 4 and 15°.<br>
Similar tubes are disclosed in the Japanese application No. 57-58094.<br>
The Japanese application No. 52-38663 discloses V or U-shaped grooved tubes, with H between 0.02 and 0.2 mm, a pitch P between 0.1 and 0.5 mm and an angle   between 4 and 15°.<br>
The US patent No. 4,044,797 discloses V or U-shaped grooved tubes similar to the above tubes.<br>
The Japanese certificate for use No. 55-180186 discloses tubes with trapezoidal grooves and triangular ribbing, with a height H of 0.15 to 0.25 mm, a pitch P of 0.56 mm, an apex angle a (angle referred to as 8 in this document) typically equal to 73 °, an angle   of 30°, and a mean thickness of 0.44 mm.<br>
The US patents No. 4, 545,428 and No. 4,480, 684 disclose tubes with V-shaped grooves and triangular ribbing, with a height H between 0.1 and 0.6 mm, a pitch P between 0.2 and 0.6 mm, an apex angle a between 50 and 100°, a helical angle p between 16 and 35°.<br>
The Japanese patent No. 62-25959 discloses tubes with trapezoidal grooves and ribbing, with a groove depth H between 0.2 and 0.5 mm, a pitch P between 0.3 and 1.5 mm, the mean groove width being at least equal to the mean ribbing width. In one example, the pitch P<br>
is 0.70 and the helical angle p is 10°.<br><br>
3<br>
Finally, the European patent EP-B1-701 680, held by the applicant, discloses grooved tubes, with typically flat-bottomed grooves and with ribbing of different  height  H,  a helical  angle  (3  between  5<br>
and 50°, an apex angle a between 30 and 60°, so as to obtain improved performances after the crimping of tubes and assembly in exchangers.<br>
. As a general rule, the technical and economical<br>
performances of the tubes, which are the result of the<br>
choice of the combination of means defining the tubes<br>
(H, P,  ,  , shape of grooves and ribbing, etc.), must<br>
satisfy four requirements relating to:<br>
-	firstly, the characteristics relating to heat<br>
transfer (heat exchange coefficient), a field wherein<br>
grooved tubes are very superior to non-grooved tubes,<br>
such that at an equivalent heat exchange, the length of<br>
grooved tube required will be less than that of a non-<br>
grooved tube,<br>
secondly, the characteristics relating to pressure losses, low pressure losses enabling the use of pumps or compressors of lower power, size and cost,<br>
also, the characteristics relating to the mechanical properties of the tubes, typically in relation to the type of alloys used or the mean tube thickness, which determines the weight of the tube per unit of length, and therefore influences its cost price,<br>
-	finally, the industrial feasibility of the tubes<br>
and production rates which determines the cost price of<br>
the tube for the tube manufacturer.<br><br>
4<br>
Problem statement<br>
Firstly, as they are a result of the prior art, there are a large number and very wide range of disclosures relating to grooved tubes, given that they generally aim to optimise heat exchange and a decrease in pressure loss.<br>
Secondly, each of these disclosures in turn frequently offers a wide range of possibilities, the parameters being generally defined by relatively wide ranges of values.<br>
Finally, these disclosures relate to, when specified, exchanges with coolant, which, typically, evaporates or condenses in the refrigerating circuit, the coolant having different evaporation and condensation behaviour. To date, these disclosures relate to grooved tubes for exchangers operating either in condensation or in evaporation.<br>
Definitively, those skilled in the art already encounter considerable difficulties in extracting the quintessence of the prior art, from such a wide range of sometimes contradictory data.<br>
However, those skilled in the art know that a typical commercially available tube, with triangular ribbing as represented in figure 1, typically comprises the following characteristics: outer diameter De = 12 mm, rib height H - 0.25 mm, tube wall thickness Tf = 0.35 mm, number of ribs N = 65, helical angle   = 15°, apex angle a = 55°.<br>
So as to meet a market demand, the aim of the present invention relates to tubes for exchangers with reversible applications, i.e. tubes or exchangers which<br><br>
5<br>
can be used with phase transition coolants, both in evaporation and in condensation, i.e. either for cooling, for example as air conditioning units, or for heating, for example as heating means, typically of air or a secondary fluid.<br>
More specifically, the present invention relates to tubes which not only offer an excellent compromise between thermal performances in coolant evaporation mode and condensation mode, but which, in addition, intrinsically show high performances both in terms of evaporation and condensation.<br>
Therefore, the applicant researched tubes and exchangers which are economical, with a relatively low weight per metre, and high heat exchange performances, both in terms of evaporation and condensation.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
According to the invention, the grooved metal tubes, of thickness Tf at the bottom of the groove, outer diameter De, typically intended for the manufacture of heat exchangers operating in evaporation or condensation or in reversible mode and using a phase transition coolant, grooved internally with N helical ribs of an apex angle a, height H, base width LN and helical angle  , two consecutive ribs being separated by a typically flat-bottomed groove of width LR, with a pitch P equal to LR + LN, are characterised in that, a) the outer diameter De is between 4 and 20 mm, b} the number N of ribs ranges from 46 to 98, particularly as a function of the diameter De,<br><br>
6<br>
c)	the  rib  height  H  ranges  from  0.18  mm<br>
to 0.40 mm,  particularly  as  a  function  of  the<br>
diameter De,<br>
d)	the apex angle a ranges from 15° to 30°,<br>
e)	the helical angle   ranges from 18° to 35°,<br>
so as to obtain simultaneously a high heat exchange coefficient both in evaporation and condensation, a low pressure loss and the lightest possible tube, without inducing an additional cost in relation to specific tubes for evaporation or condensation.<br>
Following its research work, the applicant succeeded in solving the problems posed by the combination of means and all the above characteristics.<br>
The characteristic defined in a defines the range of outer diameter De of the tubes in the target field of application of the tubes according to the invention.<br>
The characteristic in b, relating to the number N of grooves, and therefore to the corresponding pitch P, specifies that this number must be relatively high. The applicant's tests with finned batteries demonstrated that this number of grooves has a major influence on the thermal performance of the exchangers.<br>
In this way, for example, for a tube diameter De 9.52 mm:<br>
-	when the number N is less than 46,  it was<br>
observed that the performance of the exchanger dropped<br>
considerably,<br>
-	relating to the upper limit of the number N, it<br>
is essentially technological and practical in nature,<br>
and   depends   on   the   technical   manufacturing<br><br>
7<br>
possibilities for grooved tubes; therefore, this upper limit varies and increases with the tube diameter De.<br>
It was observed on a tube of diameter De of 12 mm that a number of ribs N of 98 guarantees a high thermal performance of the exchanger in evaporation and condensation.<br>
Relating to the characteristic in c, relating to the height H of the ribs or depth of the grooves, the limits of H are the result of the following observations:<br>
- for values of H greater than 0.40 mm, a lower technical feasibility was observed, since it is not easy to manufacture very high ribs, and an increase in the pressure loss was also observed,<br>
for values of H less than 0.20 mm, it was observed that the heat exchange performance is excessively diminished and becomes insufficient.<br>
Said height H may vary with the tube diameter, the larger diameter tubes preferentially having higher ribs.<br>
The characteristic in d,  relating to the apex<br>
angle a, specifies that this angle must be selected in a relatively narrow range (15° - 30°) and with relatively low apex angle values a.<br>
Firstly, a low apex angle value a is preferable to improve the heat transfer performance to reduce the pressure loss and reduce the tube weight/m. The lowest angle a is obtained with trapezoidal ribbing.<br>
However, the lower limit is essentially related to the manufacture of grooved tubes according to the invention to retain a high production rate.<br><br>
8<br>
The characteristic in e, relating to the helical angle p, demonstrates that this angle must be at least equal to 18° to solve the problems of the invention, and at most equal to 35° due to the significant increase in pressure losses, particularly with certain coolants, for example the coolant R134a.<br>
Relating to the thickness Tf of the tube at the bottom of the groove, it may vary as a function of the diameter De,  so as to obtain,  at the same  time, sufficient   mechanical    properties,    particularly resistance  to  internal  pressure,  maximum  material preservation, and therefore an optimised material cost, and  the  lowest  possible  weight  per  metre.  This thickness Tf is 0.28 mm for a tube of diameter De of 9.55 mm, and 0.35 mm for a tube of diameter De of 12.7 mm.<br>
All these means make it possible to define a selection of tubes, specific tubes particularly suitable for exchangers with phase transition coolants, so as to obtain simultaneously a high heat exchange coefficient in evaporation and condensation, a low pressure loss and the lightest possible tube.<br>
Description of Accompanying figures<br>

These curves correspond to a tube according to the invention - referred to as E in figure 3, and to tubes according the prior art referred to as "A", "C", "D" and "S", all said tubes being of the same outer diameter De = 9.52 mm. See the examples of embodiments.<br>

The measurements were made with a heat flow of kW/m2 and a mass flow rate of 100 or 200 kg/m2.s of coolant R407C, as shown in the figure, on tubes of diameter De equal to 9.52 mm.<br>
Figure 11 is a view of a portion of internal surface of a grooved tube according to the invention equipped with an axial counter groove 30, with, below, its schematic representation.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention illustrated in figures 2a to 2c, said ribbing may form a succession of ribbing of height H1=H and height H2 = a.H1.   where  a  is  between  0.6  and  0.9,   and<br><br>
12<br>
preferentially between 0.70 and 0.85, the value of a being in the vicinity of 0.75 in figures 2a to 2c,<br>
Typically, and as illustrated in these figures, said succession may be an alternation of ribbing of height H1 and of ribbing of height H2 separated by a typically flat groove bottom.<br>
However, as illustrated in figure 3, the grooved tubes according to the invention do not necessarily comprise such an alternation of ribbing at differentiated heights as in figures 2a to 2c, it being possible for the ribbing to be of roughly the same height.<br>
Typically, in the case of tubes of' diameter De of 9.52 mm, it is possible to have;<br>
-	H ranging from 0.18 to 0.3 mm,<br>
and/or  N  less  than  75,   and  ranging preferentially from 64 to 70.<br>
Similarly, when De is at least equal to 9.55 mm, it is possible to have:<br>
-	H ranging from 0.25 to 0.40 mm,<br>
-	N ranging from 70 to 98.<br>
Relating to the apex angle  , a preferential range of the apex angle a may range from 20° to 28°, a more restricted range from 22° to 25° providing the best compromise between requirements in terms of technical performance and those related to the expansion of the tubes with a view to their attachment to the battery fins.<br>
Relating to the helical angle  , a preferential range of the helical angle   may range from 22° to 30° a more restricted range from 25° to 28° providing the<br><br>
13<br>
best compromise between requirements in terms of technical performance and those related to pressure loss. This angle may vary with the inner diameter Di; it was found to be advantageous to have a p/Di ratio greater than 2.40°/mm, and preferentially greater than 3°/mm,<br>
Preferentially, said ribbing has a "trapeze" type profile with a base of width LN and a top, joined by side edges producing said apex angle a between them, as illustrated in figure 2c, said top comprising a roughly flat central part, typically parallel to said base, but possibly sloping with reference to said base.<br>
In any case, said top of said rib forming a small side of the trapeze may comprise rounded edges or not, i.e. with a very low radius of curvature, said edges forming a join of said top to said side edges.<br>
Said rounded edges may comprise a radius of curvature ranging typically from 40  m to 110  m, and preferentially ranging from 50  m to 80  m, as illustrated in figures 2a to 2c. Said ranges of radius of curvature correspond to a compromise between the thermal performances of the tubes and the feasibility of the tubes, the tools intended to manufacture tubes with smaller radii of curvature tending to become worn.<br>
When the edges are not rounded, as illustrated in figure 3, the radius of curvature may be typically less than 50  m, and even less than 20  m.<br>
According to the invention, the width LR of the flat bottom of said groove and the width LN of the base of said rib may be such that LR = b.LN where b ranges from 1 to 2, and preferentially from 1.1 to 1.8, so as<br><br>
14<br>
to obtain a tube showing a relatively low weight per metre.<br>
Typically, and as illustrated in figures 2a to 2c and 3, said ribbing and said flat bottom of said grooves may be joined with a radius of curvature less than 50  m, and preferentially less than 20  m. In this case, there appears to be a better separation of the coolant liquid film from the inner wall of the tube, which favours heat exchange.<br>
The tubes according to the invention may show, even in the absence of axial grooving, a Cavallini factor at least equal to 3.1. They may advantageously show a Cavallini factor at least equal to 3.5 and preferentially at least equal to 4.0.<br><br>
The Cavallini Factor Patent<br>
The Cavallini factor RxA2 (Rx Rx) which occurs in the models for the evaluation of the exchange coefficient, is a purely geometric factor equal to: {[2.N.H. (1-Sin( /2) / 3.14.Di.Cos ( /2)) +1] / Cos  } A2<br>
So as to further increase the Cavallini factor and as illustrated in figure 12, the tubes according to the invention can include, furthermore, an axial grooved surface (30) creating in the aforementioned ribs some notches, typically with a triangular profile with rounded summit, the aforementioned summit presenting an angle y from 25 to 65°, the aforementioned lower part or summit is at a distance h from the bottom of the aforementioned grooves from 0 to 0.2mm. Such an axial grooved surface can be obtained, once the aforementioned ribs have been formed, by the passage of a groove cutting wheel in the axial direction.<br>
The grooved tubes according to the invention can be in copper and copper alloys; aluminium and aluminium alloys. These tubes can be typically obtained by grooving the surface of the tubes or possibly by grooving the surface of a flat metal strip then joining it together to form a welded tube.<br>
Another object of the invention is constituted by heat exchangers using the tubes according to the invention.<br>
These heat exchangers can include thermal exchange fins in contact with the aforementioned tubes on a fraction of the aforementioned tubes, in which the maximum distance between the aforementioned fins and the aforementioned tube, on the fraction which is not in contact, is less than 0.01mm and preferably iess than 0.005mm.<br>
Another object of the invention is constituted by the use of tubes and exchangers according to the invention, for reversible air conditioners and multi-tubular exchangers as coolers.<br>

IV - Conclusions:<br>
All these results demonstrate that the tubes and exchangers or tube batteries according to the invention offer superior properties with respect to comparable products of the prior art, both in evaporation and condensation.<br>
As a result, surprisingly, the tubes according to the invention not only represent a good compromise of evaporation and condensation performances, but also offer, in absolute terms, excellent performances with respect to the tubes of the prior art used in evaporation and those used in condensation, which is of major interest in practice.<br>
In addition, relating to the weight per metre, the values obtained with the tubes according to the invention correspond to a gain ranging from 3.7 to 6.7% with respect to the tubes according to the prior art,<br><br>
21<br>
taken at the same diameter and same thickness Tf, which is considered as very important.<br>
Finally, the type E tubes according to the invention may be manufactured advantageously by high output grooving of smooth non-grooved copper tubes, typically at a grooving rate similar to that used for type B tubes, i.e. at least 80 m/min.<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
The invention offers great advantages.<br>
Indeed, firstly, the tubes and batteries obtained according to the invention offer high intrinsic performances.<br>
Secondly, these performances are high both in terms of evaporation and condensation, enabling the use of the same tube for both applications.<br>
In addition, the tubes have a relatively low weight per metre, which is very advantageous both from a practical point of view, and economical point of view with a relatively low material cost.<br>
Finally, the tubes according to the invention do not require specific manufacturing means. They can be manufactured with standard equipment, and particularly at standard production rates.<br>
