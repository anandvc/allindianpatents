				<td>The invention relates to a process for preparing discodermolide and analogues thereof, to novel compounds utilized in the process and to novel compounds prepared by the process.<br><br>
(+)-Discodermolide is a novel polyketide natural product that was isolated from extracts of the marine sponge Discodermolide dissoluta by researchers at the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution (HBOI) (Gunasekera SP, Gunasekera M, Longley RE, Schulte GK. Discodermolide: a new bioactive polyhydroxylated lactone from the marine sponge Discodermia dissoluta. [published erratum appears in J. Org. Chem. 1991;56:1346]. J. Org. Chem. 1990;55:4912-15,). Discodermolide lacks obvious structural resemblance to paclitaxel, yet it shares with paclitaxel (the active substance in the drug Taxol) the ability to stabilize microtubules. In mechanism-based assays, discodermolide is more effective than paclitaxel. In fact, of the handful of compounds known to induce polymerization of purified tubulin, discodermolide is the most potent. However, microtubules, a major structural component in cells, are not simple equlibrium polymers of tubulin. They exist as regulated GTP-driven dynamic assemblies of heterodimers of a and p tubulin. Although the dynamics are relatively slow in interphase cells, upon entering mitosis, the rate of growing and shortening increases 20 to 100-fold — the average microtubule turns over half the tubulin subunits every ten seconds. This change in rate allows the cytoskeletal microtubule network to dismantle and a bipolar spindle-shaped array of microtubules to assemble. The spindle attaches to chromosomes and moves them apart. The response to complete suppression of microtubule dynamics in cells is death. However, mitotic cells are more<br><br>
sensitive and the tolerance threshold appears to be cell-type specific. Molecules like paclitaxel that bind with high affinity to microtubules disrupt the dynamics process in tumor cells with lethal results even when the ratio of bound drug to tubulin is very low. Discodennolide binds to tubulin competitively with paclitaxel. Since paclitaxel has proven to b© useful in treating some cancers, other compounds of the same mechanistic class may have utility against hyperproliferative disorders.<br>
Future development of discodermolide or structurally related analogues is hindered by the lack of a reliable natural source of the compound or a feasible synthetic route. Naturally occurring discodermolide is scarce and harvesting the producing organism presents logistical problems. Accordingly, there is an ever-growing need for improved synthe^s which enable the preparation of commercially acceptable quantities of discodemiolide and structurally related analogues.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a more practical synthesis of discodermolide and analogues thereof. In another embodiment, the instant invention relates to novel compounds useful in the preparation of discodermolide and analogues thereof. In a further! embodiment, the instant invention relates to novel compounds which are prepared by the process of the instant invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The essence of the instant invention is the discovery of a more practical synthesis for discodermolide and analogues thereof. More particularly, it has been discovered that discodemnolide and analogues thereof can be prepared by a three-step reaction as follows:<br><br><br><br><br>

As to the individual steps, Step 1 involves the coupling of a ketone compound of formula I with an aldehyde compound of formula II via an aldol reaction to obtain a p-hydroxyketone compound of formula III. The coupling is conveniently carried out with between 1 and 20, preferably between 5 and 15, equivalents of the ketone compound of formula I relative to the aldehyde compound of formula II.

X is O, or CH2; and R3 and R4 are as defined above.<br>
More preferred compounds are those of fomiula lb:<br><br>
where	R3' is (C1-6)alkyl, C(0)(CM2)alkyl, benzyl, C(0)0(C1-12)alkyl, or an acid labile<br>
hydroxyl protecting group; and R1and R2' are as defined above.<br><br>
where	R3" is an acid labile hydroxyl protecting group.<br>
In the above definitions: the term "(C1-6) alkyl" as used herein refers to a straight or branched chain group consisting solely of carbon and hydrogen and having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, whereas the term "(C1-12) alkyP as used herein refers to a straight or<br><br>
branched chain group consisting solely of carbon and hydrogen and having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Examples of "alkyl" groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, 3-methylpentyl, etc.<br>
The term "acid labile hydroxyl protecting groups" as used herein refers to any oxygen bound group that can be removed upon exposure to an acid. Numerous examples of these groups are known by those skilled in the art and can be found in Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2d edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1991. Specific examples include, but are not limited to, t-butyldimethylsilyl, triethylsilyl, t-butyldiphenylsilyl, triisopropylsilyl, methoxymethyl, and tetrahydropyranyl.<br>
In a further embodiment, the instant invention relates to a process for preparing the novel compounds of formula I. More particularly, the compounds of formula I may be prepared as depicted below:<br><br><br>
where R1, R2, R3, R4 and X are as defined above.<br>
As to the individual steps, Step A involves the addition of a methyl or ethyl group to an aldehyde compound of formula VI to obtain an alcohol compound of formula VII, The addition is carried out in the presence of 1) an organometallic reagent, preferably an alkyllithium or alkylmagnesium halide such as methylmagnesium bromide; and 2) a polar organic solvent, preferably an ether such as diethyl ether, at a temperature of between -78°C and 40°C, preferably at -78°C and 0°C., more preferably at about -40°0,, for a period of between 5 minutes and 24 hours, preferably between 30 minutes and 2 hours, more preferably for about 1 hour.<br>
Step B involves the oxidation of an alcohol compound of formula VII to obtain the desired ketone compound of formula I. The oxidation is carried out in the presence of: 1) an oxidant, preferably a combination of dimethylsulfoxide and an activating agent, more preferably a combination of dimethylsulfoxide and sulfur trioxide complex with pyridine; 2) a base, preferably an organic base, more preferably a trialkylamine such as triethylamine; and 3) a polar organic solvent, preferably a chlorinated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane.

In still another embodiment, the instant invention relates to the novel p-hydroxy-ketone compounds of formula III and the novel 1,3-diol compounds of formula IV,<br>
Although the product of each reaction described above may, if desired, be purified by conventional techniques such as chromatography or recrystallization (if a solid), the crude product of one reaction is advantageously employed in the following reaction without purification.<br><br>
As is evident to those skilled in the art, compounds of formulae I and III-V contain asymmetric carbon atoms and, therefore, it should be understood that the individual stereoisomers are contemplated as being included within the scope of this invention.<br>

Accordingly, the present invention also provides a process for preparing a compound of formula I such as herein described which comprises, in a first step, addition of a methyl or ethyl lithium or methyl or ethyl magnesium reagent to an aldehyde of formula VI<br><br><br>
and, in a second step, oxidizing the alcohol compound prepared in the first step by treating it with a combination of dimethyl sulphoxide and sulphur trioxide complex and a trialkylation in a polar organic solvent to obtain the desired compound of formula I, wherein R1, R2, R3, R4 and X are such as herein described.<br><br>

EXAMPLE 4<br>
Preparation of (+)- discodermolide<br>
To a solution of 450 mg (0.452 mmol) of the compound of Example 3 in 56 mL of tetrahydrofuran is added 56 mL of an aqueous solution of 4N hydrochloric acid. The resultant solution is then stirred at room temperature for 24 hours, 10 mL of methanol is then added, and this solution is then stirred for an additional 24 hours at room temperature. To the solution is then added 50 mL of ethyl acetate, followed by the addition of sodium bicarisonate at 0°C to a pH of 8. The organic solution is then washed with brine. The aqueous layer is then extracted three times with 30 mL portions of ethyl acetate, and the<br><br>
combined extracts are dried over sodium sulfate. Filtration and concentration followed by flash chromatography employing an eluent mixture of 50% methylene chloride in ethyl acetate initially and then 100% ethyl acetate yields (+)- discodermolide.<br>
