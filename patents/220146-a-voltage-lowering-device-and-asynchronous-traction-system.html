				<td>According to the present invention there is provided a voltage lowering device and asynchronous traction system.<br>
The present invention concerns asynchronous traction systems supplied from a single-phase mains supply and in particular a voltage lowering device' and an asynchronous traction system supplied from a single-phase mains supply incorporating a device of this kind.<br>
Prior art asynchronous traction systems supplied by a single-phase mains supply essentially employ voltage inverters driving the traction motors and forced commutation single-phase rectifiers providing an intermediate direct current voltage supply to the inverters.<br>
These prior art traction systems enable standardization of the arms of the inverters and the arms of the rectifiers that are rated only to withstand the intermediate direct current voltage.<br>
In some applications the traction systems must operate from a variety of alternating current and direct current mains power supplies, for example a direct current supply at 3 000 V.<br>
In these applications the inverters and the rectifiers cannot be connected directly to the direct current high voltage. A prior art solution to this problem that has previously been used entails reconfiguring the arms of the rectifiers to obtain a series-parallel chopper in order to obtain from the 3 000 V supply the same direct current intermediate voltage fed the traction inverters from a single-phase supply.<br>
One way to implement this solution is to use electromechanical switch means and smoothing inductors.<br>
It is sometimes possible to replace these inductors by. the secondary windings of the single-phase traction<br>
transformer.	<br>
A drawback of these prior art solutions is the need for a plurality of intermediate voltages.<br>
These intermediate voltages are not all referred to the same potential.<br>
For example, one of the intermediate voltages is connected direct to the positive terminal oil the supply voltage. A direct consequence of this is that all of the equipment on the downstream side of that intermediate voltage must be designed to withstand a voltage of 3 000 V referred to ground (the ISC standard specifies 9 500 V (rms) at 50 Hz).<br>
This insulation constraint leads to overrating of the insulators and the routing distances and to increasing the thermal resistance of the semiconductor cooling systems.<br>
Accordingly one object of the invention is a voltage lowering device used in an asynchronous traction system supplied from a single-phase mains power supply that does not have the drawbacks mentioned above.<br>
The basic idea of the voltage lowerir.g device of the invention is to use only one intermediate direct current voltage.<br>
The value of the intermediate direct current voltage is approximately half the input voltage.<br>
The intermediate direct current voltage is isolated galvanically or otherwise from the mains power supply.<br>
In accordance with the invention the voltage lowering device is characterized by at least one pair of forced commutation single-phase rectifiers connected to secondary windings of a main traction transformer, the power drawn from a direct current mains ;?ower supply passing through said main traction transformer and being recovered at a secondary winding by means of a forced commutation single-phase rectifier operating as a voltage<br>
increasing . controlled rectifier, the oiiher forced, commutation single-phase rectifiers operating as synchronous voltage inverters, the primary winding of said main transformer being open circuit.<br>
A first preferred embodiment of the voltage lowering device has at least one of tt.e following features:<br>
-	a first and a second forced commutation single-<br>
phase rectifier respectively supply first and second<br>
secondary windings of a main traction transformer, said<br>
first and second single-phase rectifiers operating as<br>
synchronous voltage inverters and respectively supplying<br>
Sclld £irsL and seuuud »e^uiiUai.y  winUiiiys  u £ aaiU itiaii'i<br>
traction transformer,  and a third forced commutation<br>
single-phase rectifier operates as a voltage increasing<br>
controlled rectifier and is  supplied by said third<br>
secondary winding of said main traction transformer,<br>
-	said first, second and third secondary windings<br>
of the main transaction transformer have the same number<br>
of turns.<br>
.In a second preferred embodiment of the voltage lowering device said first and secondary forced commutation single-phase rectifiers of each of said pairs are connected in series, each of said pairs being supplied by an input voltage, said first single-phase rectifiers operating as synchronous voltage i.nverters and supplying said first secondary winding of the associated main traction transformer and said second forced commutation single-phase rectifiers operating as voltage increasing controlled rectifiers supplied by said second secondary winding of the associated ms.in traction transformer.<br>
in either of the preferred embodiments the voltage lowering device has at least one of the following features:<br>
-said first and second secondary windings of said main traction transformer are supplied by a square wave alternating current voltage at a frequency such that the magnetic circuit of the main traction transformer is not saturated,<br>
-said single-phase rectifiers operate as voltage increasing controlled rectifiers and regulate their output direct current voltage to a value slightly greater than half the value of the input voltage.<br>
Finally, in another aspect the invention consists in an asynchronous traction system supplied by a single-phase mains power supply including a voltage lowering device as previously described.<br>
One advantage of the voltage lowering device of the invention is that series-parallel choppers are no longer used.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a Voltage lowering device characterized in that it comprises at least two forced commutation single-phase rectifiers each connected to a secondary winding of a main traction transformer, the primary winding of said main traction transformer being open circuit, at least one of said rectifiers receiving as its input a direct current voltage and operating as a voltage inverter, the other forced commutation single-phase rectifier(s) operating as voltage increasing controlled rectifiers recovering power passing through the transformer and supplying as output a single direct current voltage.<br>
Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will emerge from a reading of the description of the preferred embodiment of the voltage lowering device given with reference to the drawings, in which:<br>
-figure 1 shows a block schematic of a preferred embodiment of the voltage lowering device of the invention that uses galvanic isolation,<br>
-figure 2 shows a block schematic of a preferred embodiment of the voltage lowering device including six single-phase rectifiers,<br>
-figure 3 shows an extension of the voltage lowering device shown in figure 2 to a voltage lowering device including six single phase rectifiers.<br>
Figure 1 shows a block schematic of a preferred embodiment of the voltage lowering device inn accordance with the invention that uses galvanic isolation.<br>
First and second forced commutation single-phase rectifiers 1 and 2 are connected in series across an input voltage E of, for example, 3000V.<br>
The first and second single-phase rectifiers 1 and<br>
2	respectively feed first and second secondary windings 3<br>
and 4 of a main traction transformer T.<br>
The first and second single-phase rectifiers operate as synchronous voltage inverters.<br>
The first and second single-phase rectifiers respectively feed the first and second secondary windings<br>
3	and  4  of  the  main  traction  transformer with  a<br>
squarewave alternating current voltage of, ::or example,<br>
3 000/2 = 1 500 V at a frequency such that ~he magnetic<br>
circuit  of  the main  traction  transformer  T  is  not<br>
saturated.<br>
A third forced commutation single-phase rectifier 6 is supplied by the third secondary winding 5 of the main traction transformer T.<br>
This third single-phase rectifier 6 operates as a voltage increasing controlled rectifier according to the same principle as when used on a single-phase mains power supply and thus regulates its direct current output voltage S to a value slightly greater than 3 000/2 = 1 500 V.<br>
The rrain transformer T has an open-circuit primary winding 7, i.e. the primary winding is not us«&gt;d.<br>
It is assumed above that the three secondary windings of the main traction transformer have the same number of turns, which is the case in the f:.eld of rail traction, for example.<br>
The intermediate direct current voltage is galvanically isolated and can be referred to ground M as when using a single-phase mains power supply.<br>
A control device (not shown) integrated into the control electronics of the first and second single-phase rectifiers balances the voltages between the single-phase rectifiers and ensures that there is no direct current in the first and second secondary windings.<br>
This device integrated into the control electronics of the first and second single-phase rectifiers is adapted to rectify the voltage differences by operating on the cyclic conduction ratio of the semiconductors of the first and/or second single-phase rectifier:.<br>
The voltage lowering device of the invention, including an open circuit primary winding of the main transformer, has the following advantages:<br>
-	it uses a single direct current output voltage<br>
that can always be referred to ground,<br>
-	it uses a single voltage with or without galvanic<br>
isolation,<br>
-	it avoids the need to isolate equipirent supplied<br>
by the direct current voltage from the input voltage, and<br>
-	it avoids the need to use additional smoothing<br>
inductors &amp;s used in prior art devices.<br>
Figure 2 shows a block schematic of a preferred embodiment of the voltage lowering device of the invention that does not use galvanic isolation.<br>
First and second forced commutation single-phase rectifiers 1 and 6 are connected in series across an input voltage E of, for example, 3 000 V.<br>
The first forced commutation single-phs.se rectifier 1 has the same function as the single-phase rectifier described 8ibove with reference to figure 1,<br>
The first single-phase rectifier 1 supplies a first secondary winding 3 of a main traction transformer T.<br>
The first single-phase rectifier 1 operates as an oscillator and delivers a sguarewave alternating current voltage of, for example, 3 000/2 = 1 500 V to the first secondary winding 3 of the main traction transformer.<br>
The second forced commutation single-phase rectifier 6 is supplied by a second secondary winding 5 of the main traction transformer T.<br>
This second single-phase rectifier 6 operates as a<br>
voltage increasing controlled rectifier in the same way as when using a single-phase mains power supply and produces a regulated output voltage S referred to ground M having a value slightly greater than,  lor example, 3 000/2 = 1 500 V.<br>
The ir.ain transformer T has an open circuit primary winding 7, i.e. the primary winding is not used.<br>
The control device (not shown) of the first single-phase rectifier 1 ensures that there is no direct current in the first secondary winding.<br>
The control device {not shown) of the second single-phase rectifier 6 regulates the output voltage S.<br>
Figure 3 shows an extension of the voltage lowering device shown in figure 2 to a voltage lowering device including six single-phase rectifiers.<br>
Figure 3 includes three pairs of forced commutation single-phasse rectifiers 1, 6, each pair of single-phase rectifiers b*ina supplied by an input voltage E of, for example, 3 000 V.<br>
Each of the first single-phase rectifiers 1 is associated with a first secondary winding 3 and each of the second single-phase rectifiers 6 is associated with a second secondary winding 5 .<br>
The first single-phase rectifiers 1 each supply a first secondary winding 3 of the same main traction transformer T.<br>
The second single-phase rectifier 6 all function as voltage increasing controlled rectifiers and all supply the same regulated output voltage S referred to ground M having a value slightly greater  than,  for  example, 3 000/2 = 1 500 V.<br>
The main transformer T has an open circuit primary winding 7, i.e. the primary winding is not used.<br>
it is clear that in either of the preferred embodiments described hereinabove the voltage lowering<br>
device of the invention includes one pair of forced commutation single-phase rectifiers 1, 2 or 1, 6 connected to secondary windings 3, 4 or 3, 5 of a main traction transformer T, the 'power drawn from a direct current mains power supply passing throuch the main traction transformer T, energy is recovered at a secondary winding 5 by means of a forced commutation single-phase rectifier 6 operating as a voltage increasing controlled rectifier and the other forced commutation single-phase rectifiers 1, 2 operate as synchronous voltage inverters.<br>
The voltage lowering device of the invention finds one particular, but not exclusive, application in the field of rail traction.<br>
