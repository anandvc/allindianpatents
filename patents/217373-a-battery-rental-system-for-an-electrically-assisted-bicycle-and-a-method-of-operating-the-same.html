utilize a fully charged battery at any time as required.<br>
Since the ID card according to claim 3 stores a user and a registered ID<br>
number of an electrically assisted bicycle, the time and date of battery rental and a log of electricity rental, a user can utilize a fully charged banery with an ID card, at any time as required, and without the need for cash disbursement.<br>
Since bidirectional communication is carried out between an unmanned automatic battery rental station and a central processing station, via a communication line, a provider can centralize banery specific processing and user<br>
specific processing.<br>
Accordingly, it is possible to provide a battery rental system that is extremely convenient and economical, and that is always stable.<br>
