water saving device and a gel filling portion in that a latching button for pushing an opening and<br>
closing ball and opening water paths is provided in such a manner that the supply of water is<br>
performed in a state that a shower head is placed horizontally or lower than a hose connection<br>
portion in height and the area of water paths formed at an inside thereof is larger than that of a<br>
waterway hole, whereby firmly opening and closing the waterway hole by means of the ball.<br>
Also, the present invention relates to a shower apparatus having a watering plate, a water<br>
saving device and a gel filling portion, in that a filter is provided so that it can easily remove external<br>
materials such as a rust and so on contained in the water of the shower head, a watering hole is<br>
slightly larger than the external material in size, so that it can previously prevent the watering hole<br>
from being blocked, a watering portion provided with a plurality of first watering holes is formed at the<br>
outside of the central portion of the watering plate, so that the water is equally jetted out the skin of<br>
the human body thereby increasing the shower efficiency, and the water is jetted out in the form of a<br>
triangle through the watering holes of a triangular shape, so that it can obtain the increasing effect of<br>
a negative ion.<br>
Moreover, the present invention relates to a shower apparatus having a watering plate, a<br>
water saving device and a gel filling portion, in that a gel composed of a traditional oriental material, a<br>
spice, a vitamin (an aroma component) and so on is received in the inside of a case of the gel filling<br>
portion inserted into the shower apparatus, so that the gel is dissolved into the water supplied from<br>
the external body, whereby providing a sweet aroma and a beneficial component to the user within a<br>
certain period of time.<br>
Background Art<br>
As a side effect of a rapid growth of the industry, a shortage of fresh water sources has been<br>
realized owing to an environmental pollution, an excessive usage of the water resources and so on.<br>
In order to overcome the phenomenon of the water shortage, a variety of policies and<br>
regulations have been established and various devices for water saving have been developed and<br>
spread.<br>
Generally, the shower divides into a faucet and a shower apparatus. Where the water is not<br>
used during the using of the shower apparatus, the user rotates a lever to block the water. However,<br>
since it is inconvenient for the user to use the lever for blocking the water, the user uses the shower<br>
apparatus in succession without cutting off the water, so that the amount of the water used has been<br>
1<br><br>
increased. Accordingly, a variety of devices for controlling and blocking the water have been recently<br>
proposed. However, there are defect in that the structure thereof is complicated and the cost thereof<br>
is expensive.<br>
Among the conventional devices for water saving mounted on the shower apparatus, if the<br>
user pushes down the grip thereof, the water is supplied, on the contrary, the user unloose it, so that<br>
the water supply is stopped. However, in this water saving device, there is a problem in that the entire<br>
structure of the shower apparatus should be changed.<br>
In order to complement the above defect, Korean patent publication No. 10-0278822<br>
(publication date: January 15, 2001) filed by the applicant of the present invention has been proposed.<br>
In the water saving apparatus for shower apparatus, it can be mounted to any shower apparatus and<br>
the supply of water is stopped in a state that the shower head is placed horizontally.<br>
In the water saving apparatus developed by the applicant of the present invention, where the<br>
shower head is placed horizontally or lower than a hose connection portion in height, the supply of<br>
water is stopped. However, it is inconvenient to continuously use the shower apparatus on account of<br>
an inharmonious supply of water. That is, where the water is continuously supplied through the<br>
shower apparatus, there is in- con veniency in that the shower head should stand upward by<br>
supporting it on another object,<br>
Also, since the area of the water paths formed at an outer circumference is similar to or the<br>
same as that of a waterway hole, there is a problem in that it is inharmonious to open and close the<br>
waterway hole by means of a ball.<br>
In the meantime, recently, a shower head named as a water saving type shower is well<br>
known, which is disclosed in Japanese patent laying-open gazette No. hei 8-266940. That is, in the<br>
shower head of the water saving type, a diameter reduction portion is formed at the inside of the<br>
shower head, while the diameter of the outlet thereof is enlarged, thereby saving the water. However,<br>
since it needs separated parts so as to form the diameter reduction portion, there is a defect in that<br>
the manufacturing cost is increased.<br>
Especially, in order to reduce the amount of the water used, it is necessary to reduce the total<br>
area of the watering holes. In this case, it is necessary to reduce the number of the watering holes or<br>
lessen the diameter of the watering hole. However, where the number of the watering holes is<br>
reduced, the dispersion effect of the water is lowered.<br>
For this reason, when the user takes a shower, it is difficulty for him to take a shower properly.<br>
Also, since the amount of the water contacted with the user's body is comparatively reduced, there is<br>
2<br><br>
a defect in that the washing effect is lowered. Moreover, the shower time becomes longer, thereby it<br>
cannot obtain the aim of water saving.<br>
Also, when each watering hole simply becomes smaller, it can show the effect of water<br>
saving. However, since the spraying pressure becomes higher, there is a defect in that the user feels<br>
a pain during contacting the water with his body.<br>
In the meantime, a positive ion and a negative ion exist in the atmosphere in balance. Here, it<br>
is well known that the negative ion has a good effect on the operation efficiency, the cheerfulness, the<br>
fatigue, the recovering and so on. Especially, the negative ion is largely generated from the peripheral<br>
of the waterfall. That is, the negative ion is generated when the dropping water is pulverized.<br>
As above, the phenomenon of increasing the negative ion in the peripheral air is named as a<br>
lenard effect. The lenard effect can be equally applied to the water for shower apparatus. That is, the<br>
negative ion can be generated during the use of the conventional head.<br>
In the meantime, a shower head having a watering plate for increasing the amount of the<br>
negative ion and obtaining the effect of water saving is disclosed in Korean patent publication No.<br>
2004-0088460.<br>
However, in the conventional shower head having the watering plate, as described above,<br>
the watering hole simply becomes smaller, so that it can show the effect of water saving. However,<br>
since the spraying pressure becomes higher, there is a defect in that the user feels a pain during<br>
contacting the water with his body.<br>
Also, in the conventional shower head having the watering plate, since the watering holes of<br>
the watering plate are intensively arranged on the central portion thereof in the shape of a ring, there<br>
are problems in that the water of the shower apparatus is concentrated on the center of the user's<br>
body and the user frequently moves right and left or the user frequently moves the shower head right<br>
and left on account of the partial injection of the water. Also, because the watering hole of the<br>
watering plate is formed by means of an etching process during the manufacturing thereof, there is a<br>
problem in that it can easily close the watering hole owing to the a rust of the pipe and so on.<br>

press of the main button 240, so that the pressurization slanting collar 221 formed at an end portion<br>
of the inside of the ball pressurization unit 220 pushes the ball 260 out of the waterway hole 211 to<br>
open it, thereby the water is supplied.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the main button 240 includes a stepped portion formed at one side<br>
thereof having guide steps 240a at both edges of the stepped portion and a latching button 241<br>
movable to the stepped portion.<br>
9<br><br>
The latching button 241 serves to maintain the opening status of the waterway hole 211 by<br>
allowing the ball pressurization unit 220 to press the ball 260. As shown in FIG. 3, the latching button<br>
241 includes guide grooves 241b for guiding the guide steps 240a therein and a latching step 241a<br>
formed at one side thereof.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, the latching step 241a formed at the latching button 241 is inserted into<br>
the latching hole 213a formed at one side of the button latching step 213.<br>
In the operation of the latching button 241, firstly, the ball pressurization unit 220 is pressed<br>
into the inside of the body 10 according to the press of the main button 240, so that the ball<br>
pressurization unit 220 presses down the ball 260 and the ball 260 is separated from the waterway<br>
hole 211. At this time, the latching button 241 is pushed in the direction of the latching hole 213a, so<br>
that the latching step 241a formed at the latching button 241 is inserted into the latching hole 213a.<br>
Accordingly, the pressurized main button 240 is fixed to the button latching step 213, so that it can<br>
maintain the separated status between the ball 260 and the waterway hole 211 and the opening<br>
status of the waterway hole 211.<br>
A connecting means 290 is formed at an end portion of the body 10, in which the ball case<br>
270 is inserted, and a head of the shower is connected to another end of the body 10.<br>
The shower is connected to a hose of the shower (not shown).<br>
Preferably, the area ratio of the waterway hole 211 of the body 10 to the water path 271<br>
formed at the outer circumference of the ball case 270 lengthwise is 1 : 1 through 1:10.<br>
That is, since the area of the waterway hole 211 becomes larger than that of the water path 271, it<br>
can sufficiently press on the water moved to the waterway hole 211 through the water path 271.<br>
Accordingly, in case that the ball 260 is adhered close to the waterway hole 211, as though a small<br>
shaking is generated, the ball 260 can allow the waterway hole 211 to be made airtight through the<br>
water pressure.<br>
However, where the area of the waterway hole 211 is extremely widened, since the steps<br>
between the water paths 271 become excessively narrow, the ball case 270 is in bad shape. Also,<br>
because the water pressure applied to the ball 260 is extremely high, as though the shower<br>
apparatus is erected vertically, the ball 260 is not separated from the waterway hole 211 and the<br>
waterway hole 211 is made airtight. Accordingly, it is desirable to have the range of the above<br>
mentioned area ratio.<br>
In the water saving apparatus for the shower apparatus as described above, as shown in FIG.<br>
10<br><br>
6, the diameter of the ball case 270 at the opening end portion of the ball 260 is larger than that of the<br>
ball case 270 at the closing end portion of the ball 260 about 1 mm through 3mm, so that it has a<br>
slope r gradually lowered toward the opening end portion. Here, it is preferred that the slope r is<br>
about 1° through 3°. Accordingly, as though the water saving apparatus is placed horizontally, the ball<br>
260 rolls toward the waterway hole 211 to block it.<br>
Also, the diameter of the ball 260 is smaller than the inner diameter of the ball case 270<br>
about 0.1mm through 1 mm. Accordingly, when the ball 260 is inserted in the inside of the ball case<br>
270, there is not gap between the ball 260 and the inside of the ball case 270.<br>
If the gap between the ball 260 and the inside of the ball case 270 is large, since the water flowing<br>
through the water path 271 is flowed into the inside of the ball case 270, the inflowing water pushes<br>
the ball 260 toward the waterway hole 211 to close it and stop the supply of water, irrelevantly to the<br>
intention of the user. Accordingly, it is preferred that the gap between the ball 260 and the inside of<br>
the ball case 270 is minimized.<br>

FIG. 8 is a schematic exploded view illustrating a shower head having a watering plate<br>
according to a second embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 9 is a perspective view illustrating a<br>
shower head having a filter according to the second embodiment of the present invention, and FIG.<br>
10 is an enlarged perspective view illustrating the watering plate according to the second<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Here, the watering plate 120 having a plurality of watering hole<br>
130a and 130b is fixed to the lower side of the shower head body 110.<br>
The shower head body 110 includes a connector 150 having a thread portion 140 formed at<br>
an inner circumference thereof and a stepped portion 160 formed at the lower portion thereof, and the<br>
watering plate 120 having a watering portion 170 provided with a plurality of first watering holes 130a<br>
of a triangular shape formed at a part of the central portion and a periphery thereof and a plurality of<br>
second watering holes 130b having the same size as the first watering hole 130a formed at the<br>
outside of the watering portion 170.<br>
Also, the shower head body 110 further includes the filter 180 of a minute mesh shape formed at the<br>
back of the watering plate 120 by means of a rubber ring 190 interposed between them in order to<br>
prevent the watering holes to be blocked owing to the external material.<br>
The operation and effect of the shower head having the above-mentioned structure according<br>
to the second embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail below.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8 through FIG. 10, since the watering plate 120 having the plurality of<br>
watering holes 130a and 130b is fixed to the lower side of the shower head body 110, the water<br>
11<br><br>
supplied through the shower hose passes through the inside of the shower head body 110 and<br>
braches off by means of the plurality of watering hole 130a and 130b to be discharged into outside.<br>
Here, as shown in FIG. 8 and FIG. 9, the stepped portion 160 is formed at the lower portion of<br>
the connector 150 having the thread portion 140 formed at an inner circumference thereof and then,<br>
the watering plate 120 is fixed to the stepped portion 160.<br>
The watering plate 120 includes the plurality of first watering holes 130a of a triangular shape<br>
formed at the part of the central portion thereof and the watering portion 170 having the plurality of<br>
first watering holes 130a of a triangular shape separated from each other at the periphery thereof.<br>
Also, the plurality of second watering holes 130b having the same size as the first watering holes<br>
130a is formed at the periphery of the outside of the watering portion 170, so that the discharged<br>
water branching off by means of the plurality of watering holes 130a and 130b is intensively jetted out<br>
the periphery of the central portion, not the very central portion of the user. Also, the discharged water<br>
is effectively jetted out the arm and the waist of the user through the plurality of second watering<br>
holes 130b, so that the water is equally jetted out the skin of the human body, thereby increasing the<br>
shower efficiency.<br>
Especially, since the shape of the watering holes 130a and 130b is a triangle not a circle, the<br>
friction of the water branching off by means of the plurality of watering holes 130a and 130b of the<br>
watering plate 120 is larger than that using the circular watering hole. Also, where the water is jetted<br>
out in the form of a triangle, the waterdrop thereof maintains the triangular state owing to the<br>
cohesion during the falling thereof and a negative ion is brought into from the air, thereby obtain the<br>
increasing effect of the negative ion.<br>
Also, the shape of the watering hole may be a polygon such as a square, a pentagon, a<br>
hexagon and so on.<br>
In the meantime, since the size of the external is maximally 0.2mm through 0.3mmm, it is<br>
preferred that the length of a side of the polygon is about 0.4mm through 1.2mm in order to prevent<br>
the watering hole to be blocked on account of the external material.<br>
Also, the filter 180 of a minute mesh shape for preventing the closing of the watering hole is<br>
fixed to the back of the watering plate 120 by means of a rubber ring 190 interposed between them.<br>
Accordingly, where the rust generated from a water pipe is flowed into the shower head body together<br>
with the shower water, it strains the rust though the filter 180 to be jetted out, so that it can prevent<br>
the watering holes 130a and 130b of the watering plate 120 to be blocked owing to the external<br>
material. Moreover, since the filter 180 is easily separated from the screw type connector 150, the<br>
filter 180 can be easily cleaned.<br>
12<br><br>
The filter 180 for preventing the closing of the watering holes 130a and 130b fixed to the back<br>
of the watering plate 120 may be a non woven fabric in order to improve the filtering function.<br>

As shown in the drawings, the circulating hole 20 passes through one side portion of the case<br>
30 contacted with the water flowing into the inside of the body 10. Here, the size of the circulating<br>
hole 20 becomes gradually narrow toward the inside thereof.<br>
Accordingly, the water supplied from the body 10 flows along the outer circumference of the<br>
upper portion of the case 30 and then, flows into the solution room 50 through the circulating hole 20<br>
of the case 30 by means of a Bernoulli's theorem. Here, a turbulent flow and a swirl flow are<br>
generated in the solution room 50. The water flowing into the solution room 50 passes through the<br>
filter membrane 41 and flows into the contents receiving room 60 to dissolve the water-soluble gel<br>
composed of the traditional oriental material, the spice and the vitamin (an aroma component).<br>
Therefore, the dissolved solution flows out the solution room 50 through the filter membrane 41 again<br>
and is uniformly mixed by means of the turbulent and swirl flow reaction and then, is discharged<br>
through a water outlet 80.	While this invention has been described in connection with what are presently considered to<br>
