Description<br>
The invention pertains to a cheese winder producing textile machine<br>
In such textile machine manufacturing cheese winder, e g automatic cheese winders, it is the practice since long that the textile machines are different with respect to their capacities as well as with respect to their equipment, conforming to the special requirements / specifications of different textile operations The same holds good for the associated plant units Even these could be available in different equipment varients<br>
The automatic cheese winder can, for example, be equipped with an additional cheese storage Such an equipment of a textile machine leads to a spool deposit which is different as compared to the "normal" spool deposit position, which has to be taken into account in the associated operating units by suitable adaption of the control unit of the concerned handling element<br>
Even the operation units could distinguish themselves through additional units The operating unit can, for example, be operated with or without blower unit, or have an additional mechanism which allows providing of the readied cheese with an additional head reserve winding During operation of an operating unit with a blower unit, apart from the changed running gear, one also requires an adaption of motor speed of the running motor of the operating unit Use of a head reserve mechanism makes a changed function process sequence of the handling elements of the operating units necessary<br>
So far it was the practice, to take up the respective required adaptation of the control of these operating units, the so-called construction condition coding on a hardware basis This means that the adaptation of the control unit to the respective construction condition of the operating unit or the textiles machine takes place, for example, by using wiring bridges in the wiring of the operating unit<br><br>
2<br>
 In the context of the construction condition coding of such operating units, however also the use of additional switching elements, so-called preselector switches is known The preselector switches have several manually operatable switching members, which according to the respective construction condition of the operating unit, have to be adjusted individually, which is relatively time-consuming Besides, such preselector switches are really cost-intensive<br>
From DE 42 21 504 Al we know of an automatic cheese winder whose working positions are connected to the service vehicle through a bus line If an operation requirement arises at one of the working stations, the working station sets off an optical signal, which is recognized by the service vehicle patrolling the work stations and is confirmed after positioning on to the concerned work stations by means of a light signal to the work station By means of this light signal, the concerned work station is activated in such a way, that subsequently work orders can be given to the concerned work station by the service vehicle through the bus line<br>
In EP 0 536 540 B1, in the context of textile machines, a unit is described, which allows exchange of data between several operating units and a central unit<br>
The operating unit is thereby guided on a closed rail system which runs along the work stations of the textiles machine The rail system has current conductors and separate data conductors, to which the operating units are connected by a loop contact unit The rail-bound conductor system for data transmission has thereby at least two, maximum three data conductors combined together to form a ring line, to which the sending / receiving devices of the central unit as well as the sending / receiving devices of the operating units are connected The datas are given by the sending devices in the form of impulses with pre-given impulse duration and pre-given distance, whereby each data impulse is simultaneously given on to two data conductors with opposite polarity The receiving devices are designed in such a way that only arriving impulses are evaluated, which are<br><br>
3<br>
 simultaneously received over both data conductors and have a pre-given minimum signal capacity<br>
A further variant of the data transmission between an operating unit of a textile machine and a central control unit of the textile machine is known from DE 42 12 629 Al<br>
In this setup, the communication takes place between the operating unit and the machine-controlling computer of a ring-spinning machine through available current lines Thereby an interface is used between the computer of the operating unit and the current line, as well as between the machine controlling computer of the ring-spinning machine and the current line, which allows utilization of the lines foreseen for current supply also for information transmission<br>
Based on the above-mentioned state-of-art technology, it is the task of this invention to create a textile machine for manufacturing cheese winders, with which the working of a movable operating unit along the work station of this textile machine can be improved, especially the regulation of its control unit to the respective construction condition of the operating unit becomes easier<br>
The task is fulfilled with the help of a cheese winder producing textile machine as per the invention According to the invention the object is attained by a cheese winder producing textile machine which basically comprises a plurality of adjacent work stations, a central control unit of the cheese producing textile machine, a plurality of individual work station computers connected with the central control unit, and an operating unit movable along the work stations The operating unit has a control unit connected with the central control unit in which control unit are stored a plurality of control programmes respectively adapted to different possible structural configuration of the operating unit to be selectively activated by means of a software encoding to correspond to a prevailing structural configuration of the operating unit<br><br>
4<br>
The textile machine as per the invention particularly has the advantage that the associated operating units, independent of their respective construction condition, which refers to the mechanical construction as well as the control - technical electrical hardware of these operating units, is equipped in the same way with respect to the loaded control programmes This means that the control units of these operating units have a standardized software (control programmes tuned to the different construction conditions of the operating unit), which can be activated any point of time with the help of a single software coding<br>
In an advantageous design, the central control unit belonging to the textile machine has an input element so that from the central control unit, through the machine bus, an operator-friendly activation of the corresponding control programme is possible<br>
A further design form foresees that, also or instead of an input element on the central control unit, an input possibly is provided directly on the operating unit for software coding of the control unit In this case, the operating unit has an input agent connected to its control unit Even through a such input agent, an individual and operator-friendly software coding of the control unit of the operating unit conforming to its respective construction condition is possible at any time<br>
In an advantageous development of the invention it is foreseen that through appropriate software coding of the control unit of the operating unit, it is possible to have not only a problem-free adaptation of the control unit to the construction condition of the operating unit, but also a control programme can be activated by an additional software coding which takes into account different operation conditions at the work stations of the textile machine Such a designed unit thus provides a possibility of creating a quick and optimum adaptation of operating condition at the work stations of the textile machines<br><br>
5<br>
 The control programmes stored in the control unit of the operating unit are preferably designed in such a way, that in case of multiple batches engaging the textile machine, different operating conditions can find consideration at the work stations This means that at each of the work stations one always has batch-specific and hence optimum operation conditions Besides, the control unit of the operating unit can be so coded software-wise, that on one portion of the work station of the automatic cheese winder spools, with a head reserve winding can be generated, whereas at the remaining work stations, cheese without such a head reserve winding can be produced In a preferred designed form, it is ensured that even in case of a voltage recovery after a voltage loss on the textile machine there is no handicap in the working method of the textile machine or its associated operating units This means that, in case of a voltage recovery, all the control programmes set in the control unit of the operating unit before the voltage loss is activated afresh in such a way by the central control unit, that it is ensured that given the operation condition of the unit before the voltage loss is also given after restarting of the textile machine<br>
As the central control unit of the textile machine itself is connected to a control unit of the operating unit via a machine bus, as well as to the individual work station computers of the winding station, software coding of the control unit of the operating unit becomes possible through an input element in the region of the central control unit of the machine, as well as through an input agent on the operating unit, this can be done in a very simple way, e g in the form of a menu-controlled software coding With the help of these input possibilities it is not only easy, e g to set the work station computers of the winding stations to definite operating parameters from the central control unit, but one could also undertake with the help of an uncomplicated software coding, a setting of the control unit of the operating unit without problems, conforming to the respective construction condition of this automatic service device<br>
Further details of the invention are described in details below on the basis of a design example shown in the accompanying drawings The following are shown<br><br>
6<br>
Fig 1 A front view of a cheese winder producing textile machine whose central control unit is connected through a machine bus to the work station computers of the individual work stations, as well as to the control unit of an operating unit which can be moved along the work stations,<br>
Fig 2 Aside view on one of the work stations, according to the section II-II of the fig 1<br>
Fig 1 shows in a front view schematically a cheese winder producing textile machine which is overall given the reference sign 1, in the design example of an automatic cheese winder Such cheese textile machine 1 usually have between their out ends 35, 36 several work stations of the stations of the same type, in the present case work stations 2 At these work stations 2 as is already known and hence not described in more details, the spinning cops 9 produced on a (not shown) ring spinning machine are rewound on to large-sized cheese winders 11 The readied cheese winders 11 are rolled out on to a cheese transporting unit 21 with the help of an automatic operating unit, e g with the help of cheese changer 23 and then transported to a spool loading station or something similar arranged (not shown) on the end side of the machine<br>
Besides, such Textile Machine 1 have, as already known, a spool-and sleeve transport system 3, in which the spinning cops 9 or empty sleeves 34 positioned on conveyor plates 8 in vertical alignment rotate In fig 1, in the foreground, only the so-called return stretch 7 of this spool-and sleeve transport system is indicated<br>
The automatic Textile Machine 1 further has a central control unit 37 which is connected through a machine bus 40 to the work station computers 39 of the individual work stations 2 and also to the control unit 38 of the operating unit 23<br><br>
7<br>
In a preferred design form, the central control unit 37 has an input element 41 through which, starting from the central control unit 37, it is possible to select the work station computers 39 of the work stations 2 and also a software-code for the control unit 38 of the operating unit 23 Instead of the input possibly in the region of the central control unit 37 of the machine, in another design form, as indicated by dashed lines in the figures 1 and 2, it can also be foreseen that a suitable input agent 42 is arranged on the operating unit 23 for the software coding of the control unit 38 Of course, there is also the alternative of providing input possibilities of software coding in the region of the central control unit as well as in the region of the operating units<br>
As indicated in fig 1 and as shown in more details in fig 2, the operating unit 23 is supported in a movable manner with running mechanisms 24, 25 on tracks 26, 27 along the length of the machine, which are arranged above the work stations 2 Thereby the operating unit 23 not only takes care of rolling out the cheese winders 11 readied at the work stations 2 on to the cheese transporting unit 21, but it also changes automatically a new empty sleeve 28 into the spool frame 18 of the concerned work station 2 The corresponding empty sleeve 28 relieves the operating unit 23 of an empty sleeve magazine 22 belonging to a work station<br>
Fig 2 shows a side view on a winding station 2 of a textile machine 1 As already indicated above, such textile machines have a spool-and sleeve transport system 3 In fig 2, out of this extensive transport system 3 only the machine-long transport stretch 4, the reversing cop feeding stretch 5 running behind the winding station, a cross-transport 6 leading to the work station 2, as well as the return stretch 7 are shown<br>
In this transport system 3, as already indicated above, spinning cops 9 standing in vertical alignment on conveyor plates 8, which have been produced on a (not shown) ring spinning machine, as well as worn out empty sleeves 34, are transported<br><br>
8<br>
The delivered spinning cops 9 are rewound in an unwindings station 10 of an work station 2 on to large-volumes cheese winders 11 The individual work stations have thereby, as is already known and therefore only indicated, different units which ensure a proper working of these work stations In fig 2, the thread running from the spinning cop 9 to the cheese winder 11 is indicated by 30, a suction nozzle is marked 12, an input agent, is marked 42 a splicing unit is marked 13, a thread tension device is marked 14, a thread cleaner with thread cutting device is marked 15 and a paraffin application system is marked 16<br>
The spool driving drum which drives the cheese 11 during the winding operation via the frictional lock, carries the reference number 17 During the winding operation, the cheese 11 is held in a spool frame, which is swivel-supported around an axis 19 Below the spool frame 18, similarly limitedly rotatable around the swivel plate 20 is arranged Behind the work stations runs a cheese transporting unit 21, on to which the readied cheese winders are carried and then transported to a loading station arranged (not shown) on the machine end side Each winding station additionally has an empty sleeve magazine 22, in which empty sleeves 28 are held ready for winding on a cheese 11<br>
The winding stations 2 are supplied by an operating unit, e g a cheese changer 23 This means that the cheese changer 23, arranged movable along the winding stations with its running mechanism 24, 25 on rails 26, 27, sees to it that cheese winders 11 which have reached a pre-determined diameter, are carried on to the cheese transporting unit 21 and then subsequently that from the empty sleeve magazine 22, a new empty sleeve 28 is changed into the spool frame 18<br><br>
9<br>
Fig 2 also shows the handling elements required by the operating unit during the changing process cheese / empty sleeve, these handling elements are frame opener 29, frame lifter 32, spool guiding fixture 33 and sleeve forwarder 31<br>
On account of better overview, one has done away with an illustration of further handling elements of such type of cheese changers The fixture for creating a head reserve winding, as well as the fixture for spreading of the thread 30 on to the empty sleeve 28 are not shown for example<br>
As indicated in the figures 1 and 2, the central control unit 37 of the textile machine 1 is connected through the machine bus 40 to the work station computers 39 of individual winding stations 2, as well as to the control unit 38 of the operating unit 23<br>
The central control unit 37 thereby has an input element in the form of say an input element 41, through which a construction condition coding of the control unit 38 of the operating unit 23 is possible in a simple manner, e g by selection of one of the controlled programmes A, B, C, D etc stored in the control unit 38 of the operating unit 23 This means that in the control unit 38 of the operating unit 23 there are different stored control programmes A B C D etc tailored in each case to the different construction conditions, these control programmes can be activated from the central control unit with the help of appropriate software coding In addition to that, the control unit 38 can also have various control programmes x, y, z etc which take into account of different working conditions of work stations 2 Even these control programmes X, Y, Z can be selected by means of the input element 41 of the central control unit 37, e g menu-controlled<br><br>
10<br>
From the central control unit 37, consequently by means of simple software coding of the control unit 38 of the operating unit 23, at any time that particular control programme A, B, C, D etc can be selected, which conforms to the given construction condition of the operating unit 23 This means that during the choice of the corresponding control programme, it has to be taken into account whether the operating unit is operated with blower card or whether the operating unit has a device of setting up a head reserve winding<br>
If such a device for setting up a head reserve winding is available, then by activating the corresponding control programme one can also determine, which working station this device should come into use<br>
As various variants are possible with respect to the equipment or the operation of the textile machine, which e g find consideration through control programmes X, Y, Z etc , it is also possible in a very simple manner to achieve an adaptation to the operation condition at the work station 2 by means of appropriate software coding of the control unit 38 of the operating unit 23<br><br>
