PROCESS  FOR  THE  PREPARATION OF   PROTECTED   DIHYDROXYPROPYL   TRIALKYLAMMONIUM  SALTS   AND   DERIVATIVES   THEREOF<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE  TO  RELATED   APPLTCATION<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/087,43 3, filed June   1,   1998.<br>
STATEMENT    REGARDING     FEDERALLY     SPONSORED     RESEARCH    OR DEVELOPMENT<br>
This invention was supported in part by a United States Department of Energy Grant No. DE-FG02-89ER14 029. The U.S. government has certain rights in this   invention.<br>
BACKGROUND  OF THE  INVENTION<br>
(1)	Field  of the  Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for<br>
the preparation of protected trialkylammonium salts,<br>
particularly in chiral form. The trimethylammonium<br>
salts are particularly useful in the preparation of L-<br>
carnitine, a key intermediate for pharmaceutical<br>
compounds. In particular, the present invention relates<br>
to a process for the preparation of (2,2-dimethyl-l, 3-<br>
dioxolan-4-ylmethyl)	trialkylammonium	salts,<br>
particularly  in chiral  form<br>
(2)	Description of  Related Art<br>
L-carnitine is a key intermediate for the preparation of many pharmaceutical compounds. 1,2-dihydroxypropyl trimethylammonium salts 6 (see Scheme 1) have been employed in two routes to L-carnitine. The use of this intermediate is not of industrial significance, however, because of the substantial cost of the key optically pure 3-carbon starting materials, epichlorohydrin and chloro-dihydroxy propane.  In the<br><br>
first synthesis,  (S)-epichlorohydrin is treated with trimethylamine    to    form    (S)-l-chloro-2-hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium sulfate.  This is then converted to a nitrile by displacement of the chloro group with cyanide.  Hydrolysis yields L-carnitine 1 as shown in Scheme 3 (Reimschuessel et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,594,452 (1986); Kimbrell and Russell, U.S. Patent No. 5,077,435  (1991)).   In the other synthesis route, treatment  of  (R)-l-chloro-2,3-dihydroxypropane with trimethylamine    produces    1,2-dihydroxypropyl trimethylammoniura salts which structure is shown by 1 in Scheme 1.  The diol 1 is then converted to (S)-3-chloro" 2-hydroxypropyl trimethylammonium chloride by treatment with thionyl chloride.  This is then hydrolyzed to yield L-carnitine (Katayama et al., U.S. patent No. 4,814,506 (1989)).  There is a need for an economical and reliable process.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 is a graph showing a proton NMR (1HNMR) for (2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxolan-4-ylmethyl) trimethylammonium i (1, 2-dihydroxy-3-trimethylammonium propane isopropylidene acetal) as shown in Scheme 2.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED   EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention relates to a process shown in Scheme 1 for producing in a reaction mixture a protected dihydroxypropyl trialkylammonium salt, having the formula:<br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are protecting groups which can be combined which comprises reacting a protected 3-amino-1,2-dihydroxypropane salt in a reaction mixture, having the formula:<br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are the same protecting groups with a lower alkylating agent in the presence of a base in a solvent for the reaction mixture to produce the protected dihydroxypropyl trialkylammonium salt.<br>
In the process to produce the protected dihydroxypropyl trialkylammonium salt, the alkylating agent is methyl halide which produces a protected dihydroxypropyl trimethylammonium salt. In one embodiment of the process, the methyl halide is methyl iodide which produces the protected dihydroxypropyl trimethylammonium iodide. In another embodiment, the alkylating agent is dimethylsulfate which produces the protected dihydroxypropyl trimethylammonium sulfate. In the preferred process, the base is sodium hydroxide.

Furthermore, in the process, the protecting group is an acetal selected from the group consisting of alkylidene, arylidene, acylidene and combinations thereof. In the preferred process, the protecting group is a geminal dimethoxy-acetal such as 2,2-dimethylsulfate which is 1,2-dihydroxy-3-trialkyammoniumpropane isopropylidene acetal.<br>
In the process to produce the protected dihydroxypropyl trialkylammonium' salt, the inorganic bases are preferably sodium or potassium hydroxide or sodium or potassium carbonate- The alkylating agent is an alkyl halide (Br, I, Cl, F) sulfate, tosylate or sulfonate. The solvent is preferably water or a lower alkanol (1 to 4 carbon atoms), most preferably methanol. The reaction is conducted at 10° to 70oc, optimally 25o to 50oC.<br>
In a preferred process to produce the protected dihydroxypropyl trialkylammonium salt, the protected 3-amino-l, 2-dihydroxypropane is produced in a reaction mixture from a protected butyramide having the formula:<br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are protecting groups which can be combined wherein the reaction mixture is a Hoffman rearrangement reaction which contains a base and a halogen to produce the protected 3-amino-l,2-dihydroxypropane. The protected butyramide is produced from 3,4-dihydroxybutyramide in a reactive mixture comprising an acid and the protecting group in a solvent for the reaction.<br><br>
The present invention further provides a process for preparing a protected dihydroxypropyl trialkylammonium salt from 3-hydroxy-γ-butyrolactone. The process comprises the steps of (1) reacting 3-hydroxy-γ-butyrolactone with ammonia hydroxide to produce 3,4-dihydroxybutyramide; (2) reacting the 3,4-dihydroxybutyramide with a protecting group to produce a protected butyramide; (3) reacting the protected butyramide in a Hoffman rearrangement reaction containing a base and sodium hypochlorite to produce a protected 3-amino-l,2-dihydroxypropane; and (4) reacting the protected 3-amino-l, 2-dihydroxypropane with an alkylating agent in the presence of a base in a solvent for the reaction to produce the protected dihydroxypropyl trialkylammonium salt.<br>
In the process for preparing a protected trialkylammonium salt from 3-hydroxy-Y^butyrolactone, the alkylating agent in step (4) is methyl halide which produces the protected dihydroxypropyl trialkylammonium salt which is a protected dihydroxypropyl trimethylammonium salt. In a/ preferred process to produce the protected dihydroxypropyl trialkylammonium salt, the methyl halide is methyl iodide which results in the production of a protected dihydroxypropyl trimethylammonium iodide. In an alternate process to produce the protected dihydroxypropyl trimethylammonium salt, the alkylating agent is dimethylsulfate which results in the production of a protected dihydroxypropyl trimethylammonium sulfate.<br>
In the process for preparing a protected trialkylammonium salt from 3-hydroxy-γ-butyrolactone, the protecting group added to the 1 and 2 hydroxy groups of 3,4-dihydroxybutyramide to produce the protected butyramide is 2,2-dimethoxypropane.<br>
The present invention preferably relates to a process which comprises reacting in a reactive mixture 3-amino-l,2-dihydroxypropane isopropylidene acetal with<br><br>
a lower alkylating agent in the presence of a base in a solvent for the reaction mixture to produce a (2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxolan-4-ylmethyl) trialkylammonium salt. In particular, the present invention relates to the preparation of (2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxolan-4-ylmethyl) trimethylammonium salt.<br>
In the process to produce the (2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxolan-4-ylmethyl) trialkylammonium salt from 3-amino-1,2-dihydroxypropane isopropylidene acetal, the alkylating agent is methyl halide.  In one embodiment, the methyl halide is methyl iodide which produces the (2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxolan-4-ylmethyl) trialkylammonium salt which is a (2 , 2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxolan-4-ylmethyl) trimethylammonium iodide.  In another embodiment, the alkylating agent is dimethylsulfate which produces the (2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxolan-4-ylmethyl) trialkylammonium salt which is a (2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxolan-4-ylmethyl). trimethylammonium sulfate.  In the preferred process, the base is sodium hydroxide.  In the preferred process, the solvent is aqueous methanol.<br>
In the process to produce the (2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-ylmethyl) trialkylammonium salt from 3-amino-1,2-dihydroxypropane isopropylidene acetal, the inorganic bases are preferably sodium or potassium hydroxide or sodium or potassium carbonate. The alkylating agent is an alkyl halide (Br, I, CI, F) , sulfate, tosylate or sulfonate. The solvent is preferably water or a lower alkanol (1 to 4 carbon atoms), most preferably methanol. The reaction is conducted at 10o to 70oc, optimally 25o to 50oc,<br><br><br>
Scheme 1 shows the synthesis of a protected dihydroxypropyl trimethylammoniuin salt (1) from 3-hydroxy-γ-butyrolactone (1). In Scheme 1, R^ and Rj are any protecting groups which can be different or combined and X is any halogen such as chlorine, bromine, fluorine, or iodine. In the reaction, 1 is converted to 3,4-dihydroxybutyramide (2.) in a reaction with ammonium hydroxide at room temperature. After removal of water, 2 is converted to the protected butyramide (2) in a reaction mixture containing a protecting group and an acid in a solvent. This reaction is quantitative and produces the protected butyramide (1)  which can be<br><br>
crystallized upon concentration to dryness. A Hoffman rearrangement reaction completely converts 1 to a protected 3-amino-l,2-dihydroxypropane (i.) which is then converted to a protected dihydroxypropyl trialkylammonium salt (i) in a reaction consisting of an alkylating agent in the presence of a base. Alkylating agents suitable for the conversion include methyl halides such as methyl iodide or dimethyl sulfate. The reaction essentially converts all of ± to i. The protected dihydroxypropyl trialkylammonium salt (SL) can be converted in the presence of an acid to the 3,2-dihydroxypropyl trialkylammonium salt (£.) by removal of the protecting groups. Alternatively, 5. is converted to carnitine (5.) as shown in Scheme 3.<br>
The important step in obtaining 5. is a 1-carbon chain descension step in which the 4-carbon intermediate (3.) is stereospecifically and guantitatively converted to the pure 3-carbon primary amine (A) via a Hoffman rearrangement reaction on the protected amide (2) - In a Hoffman rearrangement reaction, primary amines react- with CI or Br in the presence of a strong base to form amines with the loss of the carbonyl carbon atom. However, such a reaction on a Y-hydroxyamide normally fails because of participation by the alcohol function to form a lactone.<br>
One important aspect of this invention is that participation of the alcohol functions can be avoided by tying up the interfering alcohol functions with blocking or protecting groups. The 3 and 4 hydroxy 1 groups of the dihydroxybutyramide (2) can be protected with any combination of protecting groups which includes but is not limited to the constituents of the group consisting of alkyloxy, aryloxy, acyloxy, halo, sulfonyloxy, sulfate, phosphate or saccharide. Protected butyraraide (2.) , protected 3-amino-l, 2-dihydroxypropane (4), and protected dihydroxypropyl trialkylammonium salts (5.) are shown wherein R1 and 2R    are protecting groups.  The<br><br>
protecting groups (R1 and R2) form acetals which can be the same or combined when the protecting group is a geminal dimethoxy acetal. Thus, the protecting groups can be any combination of alkylidene, arylidene or acylidene groups which includes such acetals such as propylidene, benzylidene, ethylidene and methylidene. In a preferred embodiment, the protecting group is a geminal dimethoxy-acetal such as 2,2-dimethoxypropane which forms a cyclic acetal with the 3 and 4 hydroxyl groups of the dihydroxybutyramide (2) to form the protected dihydroxybutyramide (3a in Scheme 2) . The use of methyl iodide, chloride, fluoride, or bromide in the conversion of 4 to 5 yields the corresponding halide salts of 5 directly. Alternatively, the use of dimethylsulfate gives the methylsulfate salts of 5. directly. This can be exchanged with an ion exchange resin for hydroxide or halide counter ions.<br>
The use of (S) -3-hydroxy-y-butyrolactone (1) as the starting material for synthesis of 5. is convenient over prior art methods because 1 can be synthesized in high yield and in large quantities from renewable, natural resources. Inexpensive methods for synthesizing 1 have been described in: U.S. Patent No. 5,319,110 to R. Hollingsworth which discloses a process for synthesis of an internal cyclic ester such as a lactone by converting a hexose source, which contains hexose as a substituent and another sugar attached to the hexose substituent in the 4 position via (S)-3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid as an intermediate; U.S. Patent No. 5,374,773 to R. Hollingsworth which discloses a process for the synthesis (S)-3,4-hydroxybutanoic salt by converting a hexose source which contains hexose as a substituent and another sugar attached to the hexose substituent in the 4 position via (S) -3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid as an intermediate; U.S. Patent No. 5,292,939 to R. Hollingsworth which discloses synthesis  of  (S) -3,4-dihydroxybutyric  acid  from<br><br>
substituted D-hexose; and U.S. Patent No. 5,808,107 to R. Hollingsworth which discloses another process for producing chiral lactones. These references are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
In a preferred process to produce the (2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-ylinethyl) trialkylammonium salt from 3-amino-l,2-dihydroxypropane isopropylidene acetal, (S)-3-dihydroxybutanoic acid-γ-lactone (JL) or its free acid is converted to a (S)--(2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxolan-4-ylmethyl) trialkylammoniuia salt (iA) as shown in Scheme 2 • This protected fonn of (S) -1,2-dihydroxypropyl-3--trialkylammonium salts, is an intermediate for which synthetic routes with conversions in good yields to L-carnitine exist. The (S) -(2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxolan-4-ylmethyl) trimethylammonium salt (5a) in scheme 2) can be easily converted into carnitine (9) in a few steps as shown in scheme 3 • The trimethylamino dioxolane (5a) can also be converted to the corresponding diol (6) by acid hydrolysis.<br><br><br><br>
Scheme 2 shows the synthesis of a (2,2-<br>
dimethyl-l,3-dioxolan-4-ylmethyl) trimethylammonium salt<br>
(5a)	(1,2-dihydroxy-3 -tr imethylatniuonium	propane<br>
isopropylidene acetal) from 3-hydroxy--γ-bxityrolactone<br>
(i). In Scheme 2, X is a halogen such as Br, I, F, or<br>
C1,	In    the     reaction,      1     is     converted     to     3,4-<br>
dihydroxybutyramide (2) in a reaction with ammonium<br>
hydroxide at room temperature. After removal of water,<br>
2_ is converted to the protected butyramide (3a) in a<br>
reaction mixture containing a protecting group such as<br>
2,2-dimethoxypropane, and an acid in a solvent such as<br>
acetone. This reaction is quantitative and produces the<br>
protected butyramide (3a) which can be crystallized upon<br>
concentration to dryness. A Hoffman rearrangement<br>
reaction completely converts 3a to 3-amino-l,2-<br>
dihydroxypropane isopropylidene acetal (4a) which is<br>
then converted to (2, 2-dimethyl-l, 3-dioxolan-4-ylmethyl)<br>
trialkylammonium salt (5A) in a reaction consisting of<br>
an alkylating agent in the presence of a base.<br>
Alkylating agents suitable for the conversion include<br>
methyl halides such as methyl iodide or  dimethyl<br>
sulfate. The reaction essentially converts all of la to<br>
5 a .	2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxolan-4-ylmethyl)<br><br>
trialkylammoniuin salt (5a) is converted in the presence of an acid to the 1,2-dihydroxypropyl trialkylammonium salt (6.)   by removal of the protecting groups.<br>
This reaction sequence has several advantages over the prior art.   First, it avoids the use of optically pure epichlorohydrin which is very costly. Second, gaseous trimethylamine is not used.   Third, synthesis starts from (S)-3-hydroxy-γ-butyrolactone (1) which is easily available, in high yield with high optical purity from starch, lactose and a variety of readily available and cheap carbohydrate raw materials. The (S)-1,2-dihydroxypropyl trialkylammonium salt (6) is obtained cleanly and efficiently from the protected amide  (1  or 2A)      which  is,  in  turn,  obtained quantitatively from (S)-B-hydroxy-γ-butyrolactone (i) . This route provides an economically viable path to the commercial production of L-carnitine (3.).<br>
(2 , 2-dimethy1-1,3-dioxolan-4-ylmethyl) trialkylammonium salt 5a is a precursor for the synthesis of compounds such as L-carnitine. For example, in Scheme 3, L-carnitine (5L) is synthesized from la. In a reaction consisting of HOAc and a halide, 5a is converted to l-halo-2-oxyacetyl-propyl trimethylammonium salt (2) • Then, in a nucleophilic substitution reaction, the halogen atom in 2 is replaced by a cyanide ion to make l-nitrile-2-oxyacetyl-propyl trialkylammonium salt (fi) which is then, in the presence of an acid, is converted to L-carnitine (2.)-<br>
(S)-1,2-dihydroxypropyl trialkylammonium salt (6) is also a precursor for other compounds such as L-carnitine (2.) . To make L-carnitine, the primary hydroxyl of  is selectively halogenated to produce the compound, l-halo-2-hydroxypropyl trialkylammonium salt, which is then converted to 3-nitrile-2-hydroxypropane trialkylammonium salt in a nucleophilic reaction with sodium cyanide. Then, the 3-nitrile-2-hydroxypropane trimethylammonium salt is converted to L-carnitine (3_)<br><br>
in    the    presence    of    an    acid.	In        U.S.     Patent    No.<br>
4,814,506 to Katayana et al, the synthesis of L-carnitine, &amp; is an intermediate made from (R)-1-chloro-2, 3-propanediol wherein the (R) -l-chloro-2 , 3-propanediol is recovered from a racemic mixture of the (R) and (S) forms treated with a microorganism which selectively metabolizes the (S) form. In contrast to the prior art, the present invention provides an economical method for preparing 6. from 3-hydroxy-γ-butyrolactone.<br>
The following examples are intended to promote a     further    understanding    of    the    present    invention.<br>
EXAMPLE   1<br>
This Example shows the process for the preparation of (2,2-dimethyl-l, 3-dioxolan-4-ylmethyl) trimethylammonium sulfate (5.) from (S) -3-hydroxy-γ-butyrolactone   (1).<br>
(S)-3-hydroxy-γ-butyrolactone (A) (51 g, 0.5<br>
mol) was converted to the amide (2.) by treatment at room<br>
temperature for 14 hours with 110 ml of 30% ammonium<br>
hydroxide      (0.85      mol) .	The      solution     was      then<br>
concentrated to a syrup at -50oC under reduced pressure<br>
until no more water could be removed. Acetone (500 mL)<br>
and 2,2-dimethoxypropane (104 g, 1 mol) was added.<br>
Sulfuric acid (2 mL) was then added and the mixture<br>
protected from moisture with a calcium chloride drying<br>
tube, heated at 60oC for 30 minutes and stirred at room<br>
temperature for 12 hours. Silver oxide (2 0 g) was added<br>
and the mixture stirred for 1 hour. Methanol (200 ml)<br>
was then added and the mixture filtered and concentrated<br>
to dryness. The protected amide (2.) was crystallized<br>
upon concentrating and was used directly in the next<br>
step. Conversion to- the protected amide (1) was<br>
essentially     guantitative.	A      small      amount     when<br>

The protected amide (2) (0.08 g 0.005 mol) was treated with 10-12% sodium hypochlorite solution (5 ml) and the mixture stirred until all of the solid had dissolved (- 5 mins) . Sodium hydroxide (0.8 grams dissolved in 5 ml water) was added to the mixture and the solution was warmed to 50-60oC and then kept there for 24 hours by which time conversion to 3-amino-l,2-dihydroxypropane isopropylidene acetal (±) was completed. H-NMR spectroscopy indicated 100% conversion of 3. to 1.<br>
In this process, i. was not isolated but was directly converted to the trimethylamino derivative (5.) by adding dimethyl sulfate (6 equivalents), sodium hydroxide (0.85 g, 0.021 moles) and 2 ml of methanol and stirring for a further (12 hours) . Proton NMR spectroscopy (Figure 1) clearly indicated complete convers ion to (2,2 -dimethy 1-1,3 -dioxolan-4 --y Imethy 1) trimethylammonium sulfate (i) . The analysis showed the methine proton signal appeared as a triplet (J= - 8Hz) at 4.12 ppm, the methylene protons adjacent to the trimethylamino group was a doublet (J=~ 8H2) at 3.4 ppm and the signals for the methylene group on the dioxolane ring were partially obscured by the one for the methylsulfate anion at 3.59 ppm.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
This Example shows a process for the preparation of the protected butyramide (2,) from (S)-3-hydroxy-Y-butyrolactone (1) . In this Example, 1 was recovered  from the reaction mixture  .<br>
(S)-3-hydroxy-γ-butyrolactone (51 g, 0.5 mol) was   converted   to   the   amide    (2)    by   treatment   at   room<br><br>
temperature for 14 hours with 110 ml of 30% ammonium hydroxide (0,85 mol). The solution was then concentrated to a syrup at -50°C under reduced pressure until no more water could be removed. Then, 500 ml of acetone and the blocking group 2,2-dimethoxypropane (104 g, 1 mol) was added. Sulfuric acid (2 ml)' was then added and-the mixture, protected from moisture with a calcium chloride drying tube, was heated at 60°C for 30 minutes, and then stirred at room temperature for 12 hours. Afterwards, 20 g of silver oxide was added and the mixture stirred for an additional hour. Then, methanol (200 ml) was added to the mixture, which was then filtered and concentrated to dryness, wherein the protected butyramide (3.) was crystallized.<br>
Preparation of the protected butyramide (3.) was essentially quantitative. A small amount was crystallized from acetone to give white crystals which had a melting point between 106 to 108°C. The protected butyramide (3.) is used to synthesize compounds such as 3-amino-l,2-dihydroxypropane isopropylidene (A) and (2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxolan-4-ylme;thyl) trimethylammonium salts (i) which is used in the synthesis of carnitine (5_) as shown in Scheme 3, 1/2-dihydroxypropyltrimethylammonium salts {§,) which is be also used to synthesize carnitine.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
This Example shows a process for the preparation of the 3-amino-l,2-dihydroxypropane isopropylidene (±) from protected butyramide (i) in a Hoffman rearrangement reaction. In this Example, 1 was recovered from the reaction mixture instead of converted to 5.<br>
The 0.08 g (0.005 mol) of the protected amide (1) was treated with 10-12% sodium hypochlorite solution (5 ml) and the mixture was stirred until all of the solid had dissolved (-5 minutes).  Sodium hydroxide (0.8<br><br>
grams dissolved in 5 ml of water) was added to the mixture and the solution was warmed to 50 to 60°C and kept there for 24 hours by which time conversion to 3-amino-1,2-dihydroxypropane isopropylidene (4) was completed. 1H-NMR spectroscopy indicated 100% conversion<br>
of (1) to (A).<br><br>
3-amino-l,2-dihydroxypropane isopropylidene (A) is used in the synthesis of compounds such as (2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-ylmethyl) trimethylammonium salts (5.) as shown in Example 1, or 1,2-dihydroxypropyltrimethylammonium salts (6) which is also be used to synthesize carnitine.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
This Example shows a process for the preparation of L-carnitine (2.) from (S) - (2, 2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-ylmethyl) trimethylammonium salts (5.) -<br>
S-(2,2-dimethyl-l;3-dioxolan-4-ylmethyl) trimethylammonium salt is reacted with HOAc and the halogenating reagent, hydrogen bromide, to produce (S)-l-bromo-2-oxyacetyl-propane trimethylammonium acetal (2) . Alternatively, the halogenating reagent can be thionyl chloride. The bromine is displaced by reacting 2 with NaCN to produce the nitril intermediate (8) which is then converted in the presence of an acid to L-carnitine (1).<br>
EXAMPLE 5 This Example shows a process for the preparation of L-carnitine (1) from 1,2-dihydroxypropane trimethylammonia salt (6) . (S)-1,2-dihydroxypropane trimethylammonium salt (6) is converted to (S)-3-bromo-2-hydroxypropane trimethylammonium salt by halogenation with hydrogen bromide. The bromine is displaced by reacting (S)-l-bromo-2-hydroxypropane trimethylammonium salt with sodium prussiate (NaCN) to produce the nitrile intermediate which is then converted in the presence of<br><br>
an acid to L-carnitine (5.). Alternatively, halogenation of 6 can be achieved using thionyl chloride-It is intended that the foregoing description be only illustrative of the present invention and that the present invention be limited only by the hereinafter appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br>
