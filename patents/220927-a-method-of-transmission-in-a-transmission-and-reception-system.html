On account of the asymmetical carbon atom(s) present in the compounds of formula I and their salts, the compounds may exist in optically active form or in form of mixtures of optical isomers, e.g. in form of racemic mixtures. All optical isomers and their mixtures including the racemic mixtures are part of the present invention.<br>
Halogen is fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, preferably fluorine or chlorine.<br>
Any alkyl and alkoxy radicals are branched or straight chain radicals. They are preferably methyl or methoxy groups.<br>
In a further aspect the invention provides a process for the production of the compounds of formula I and their salts, whereby a compound of fomnula n<br><br>
  I<br>
wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above, is alkylated and the resulting compound is recovered in free base form or as an acid addition salt.<br>
The alkylation can be effected in accordance to conventional procedures, for example using an appropriate compound of formula Y-CHRo-A, wherein Ro and A are as defined above and Y is iodine, bromine, chlorine, mesyloxy or tosyloxy, in the presence of a base and in an inert solvent, preferably at elevated temperature, e.g. as described in Example 1. Alternatively a compound RQ-CO-A, wherein Ro and A are as defined above, can be used (reductive alkylation), e.g. as described in Example 4. For the preparation of a compound of formula I wherein Ro is hydrogen, the alkylation can also be effected by acylation with an acid A-COOH, wherein A is as defined above, and subsequent reduction, e.g. as described in Example 2.<br>
For the preparation of a compound of formula I wherein A is a group of formula (c) or (e), the substituent R7 or R10 may suitably be introduced after the alkylation or acylation/reduction of the compound of formula n, e.g. as described in Example 3,<br>
Compounds of formula I wherein A is as defined above but free from reduceable functional groups (hereinafter A'), can also be obtained by reduction of a compound of fomnula ill<br>
  m<br>
wherein Ro, R1, R2 and A' are as defined above, obtained by ring closure of a diacid of formula IV<br><br>
  IV<br>
wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above, with an amine H2N-CHR0-A', wherein Ro and A' are as defined above.<br>

Compounds of formula I in optically pure form can be obtained from the corresponding racemates according to well-l<nown procedures or using optically pure starting materials e.g. as described in examples to></nown>
Acid addition salts may be produced in known manner from the free base forms and vice-versa.<br>
The starting compounds of formulae H, IV, Y-CHRo-A and H2N-CHR0-A are known or may be obtained from known compounds, using conventional procedures.<br>
The compounds of fomiula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, hereinafter referred to as agents of the invention, exhibit valuable pharmacological properties when tested in vitro and in animals, and are therefore useful as pharmaceuticals.<br>
In binding assays, the agents of the invention display high affinity at 02 adrenoceptor subtypes, with selectivity to 020, as shown in a radioligand binding assay using ^H-RX821002 as a ligand and membranes from CHO K1 cells expressing the recombinant human 02 adrenoceptor subtypes. In this assay, agents of the invention exhibit pKd values of about 6 to about 10.<br>
in la vitro antagonist experiments using cAMP-based luciferase reporter gene assays based on transfected CHO K1 cells stably expressing the recombinant human 02 receptors, in<br><br>
presence of the α2 agonists UK 14,304 or noradrenaline, agents of the invention act as competitive antagonists at the cfe receptors with pKe values of about 6 to about 9.<br>
In vivo, the agents of the invention inhibit loxapine-induced catalepsy in rats [cf. Kalkman H.O. et a!., Br. J. Pharmacol. 124:1550-1556 (1998)] at doses of about 0.3 to about 30mg/kg s.c.<br>
Furthermore the agents of the invention inhibit amphetamine induced locomotion in rats at doses of about 0.3 to abotit 30mg/Kg s.c. Locomotion (ambulatory activity) Is measured as the number of consecutive infrared interruptions in an appropriate device during a period of 15 min. directly following s.c. injection of amphetamine (Img/kg) or solvent (physiological saline) at t=0. The compound or the solvent are administered at t= -30 min.<br>
in view of the above, the agents of the invention are useful as antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia, in the treatment of depressiort (including bipolar disorders) and more generally in the treatment of any condition associated with a deficiency of noradrenaline in the central or peripheral nervous system which Is compensated by a-antagonists via blockade of presynaptic a2 receptors, such as cognition deficits, Parkinson disease, drug abuse, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, glaucoma, diabetes and erectile dysfunction.<br>
For the above-mentioned indications, the appropriate dosage will of course vary depending upon, for example, the compound employed, the host, the mode of administration and the nature and severity of the condition being treated. However, in general, satisfactory results in animals are indicated to be obtained at a daily dosage of from about 0.1 to about 100, preferably from about 0.5 to about 100 mg/kg animal body weight. In larger mammals, for example humans, an indicated daily dosage is in the range from about 1 to about 500, preferably from about 1 to about 300 mg of an agent of the invention, conveniently administered, for example, in divided doses up to four times a day or in sustained release form.<br><br>
The agent of the invention may be administered by any conventional route, in particular enterally, preferably orally, for example in the form of tablets or capsules, or parenterally, for example in the form of injectable solutions or suspensions.<br>
In accordance with the foregoing, the present invention also provides an agent of the invention, for use as a pharmaceutical, e.g. for the treatment of schizophrenia.<br>
The present invention furthermore provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an agent of the invention in association with at least one pharmaceutical carrier or diluent. Such compositions may be manufactured In conventional manner. Unit dosage forms contain, for example, from about 0.25 to about 150, preferably from 0.25 to about 25 mg of a compound according to the invention.<br>
For all the above indications, the preferred compounds are (R)-1-isopropyl-5-[3-(2-methoxyphenyl)pyrrolidin-1 -ylmethyl]-1 H-pyridin-2-one and (R)-1 -(2,3,-dihydro-benzo-[1,4]dioxin-6-ylmethyl)-3-(2-methoxyphenyl)pyrrolidine. In the above-mentioned loxapine-induced catalepsy test, both compounds show with 0.3-3mg/kg s.c. a long lasting, dose-dependent inhibition of catalepsy. An oral dose of 10mg/kg produces similar inhibition as 3mg/kg s.c. In the above mentioned amphetamine-induced locomotion test, both compounds dose-dependently reduce locomotion at 0.1, 0.3 and Img/kg s.c. (first mentioned compound) and 1, 3 and lOmg/kg s.c, (second compound).<br>
The preferred indications are schizophrenia and depression.<br>
Moreover the present invention provides the use of an agent of the invention, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of any condition mentioned above.<br>
In still a further aspect the present invention provides a method for the treatment of any condition mentioned above, in a subject in need of such treatment, which comprises administering to such subject a therapeutically effective amount of an agent of the invention.<br>
