				<td>Method and device for winding a plurality of threads<br>
The invention relates to a method for winding a plurality of threads into sppols, according to the preamble of claim 1, and to a device for carrying out the method, according to the preamble of claim 11.<br>
In the production of synthetic threads, a tendency increasingly can be observed whereby a multiplicity of threads are spun simultaneously from a polymer melt in parallel and next to one another in a spinning position and are subsequently wound into spools. Thus, it is known to spin ten, twelve, sixteen or more threads in parallel and simultaneously to wind them into spools. The winding of the threads may in this case take place by means of spooling machines in which the spools are held and wound on a spooling spindle. In the case of relatively large spool widths and large numbers of threads, spooling machines of this type require correspondingly long spooling spindles. Novel concepts have therefore been developed in which the threads are wound simultaneously into spools by means of two spooling spindles arranged parallel and next to one another. A method of this type and a device of this type are known from WO 03/068648 Al.<br>
In the known method and the known device, the threads are wound simultaneously into spools on two spooling spindles arranged next to one another. For this purpose, the spooling spindles are driven in each case by means of a spindle drive. Each of the spooling spindle's is assigned a pressure roller which is held radially movably with respect to the spooling spindle via a rocker. During the winding of the threads into spools, the pressure rollers bear against the circumference of the spools. With an increasing spool<br><br>
diameter, in this case, both the pressure roller and the spooling spindle can be varied in their position. As a further degree of freedom, the movably held pressure rollers can additionally be moved radially with respect to the spooling spindles by means of a slide. Owing to the multiplicity of degrees of freedom, however, it is unavoidable that the spools of the two spooling spindles have differences in the spool construction. Owing to the individual movability of the two pressure rollers, it is possible only at an enormous outlay in terms of regulation to maintain, for example, constant bearing forces in both spooling spindles. The winding of different spools on the two spooling spindles is therefore unavoidable.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a method and a device of the generic type, in which essentially uniform spools are wound on the two spooling spindles, during the simultaneous winding of the threads.<br>
The object is achieved, according to the invention,	by<br>
means of a method having the features as claimed	in<br>
claim 1 and by means of a device having the features	as claimed in claim 11.<br>
Advantageous developments of the invention are defined by the features and feature combinations of the respective subclaims.<br>
The invention is distinguished in that, in each spooling station, there are identical geometric assignments between the spooling spindles and the pressure rollers. Moreover, as a result, a bearing force to be applied by the pressure rollers for the winding of the spools on the two spooling spindles can be set by simple means. The bearing force is advantageously in this case obtained from a weight load and/or weight relief of the pressure rollers connected<br><br>
rigidly to one another. For this purpose, the pressure rollers are connected to one another by means of a holder which is held movably on a machine stand and which co-operates with a controllable force generator for weight load and/or weight relief. A particular advantage of the invention is therefore to be seen in that, at each time point in a spooling travel, each of the spools wound on the two spooling spindles has an identical spool diameter. A different spool growth and consequently different spool diameters are advantageously avoided.<br>
The uniform spool construction of the spools on the two spooling spindles can be further improved in that, during winding, the center distances between the spooling spindles and the assigned pressure rollers are kept identical.<br>
Moreover, owing to the preferred method variant as claimed in claim 3, manufacturing tolerances on the device can be compensated. Thus, for example, on account of manufacturing tolerances the position of the spooling spindles within the device could exhibit minor deviations in relation to the pressure rollers. Thus, particularly on commencement of a winding operation, there would be no uniform contact taking place between the pressure rollers and the assigned spooling spindles. To bridge such manufacturing tolerances, in this method variant, first a high contact force is set between the spooling spindles and the pressure rollers. The contact force is in this case dimensioned in such a way that, because of elasticities of the lengthily projecting spooling spindles, the two pressure rollers come into contact with the assigned spooling spindles. For this purpose, the pressure rollers or the spooling spindles preferably have a parallel elasticity, so that flexion phenomena are ruled out. After the threads are wound on the spooling tubes of the spooling spindles,<br><br>
the contact force is changed to a lower bearing force.<br>
For this purpose, the device according to the invention has as a force generator at least one relief cylinder unit which is connected to a control device. The support of the pressure rollers can thus be reduced correspondingly at the commencement of the spooling operation, so that a high fraction of the overall weight is available for exerting the contact force.<br>
In order to allow a uniform winding of the threads on both spooling spindles, the pressure rollers preferably have run-on rings which take over contact with the spooling spindles during the catching and winding of the threads. Only after the winding of a basic layer do the pressure rollers come into contact with the spools. Until then, preferably, the contact force is changed over to the bearing force.<br>
The run-on rings of the two pressure rollers are preferably designed in the same size, so that each of the spools has a uniform basic layer.<br>
It is also possible, however, to design the run-on rings of the two pressure rollers with a different outside diameter, for example so that relatively major differences in positional tolerance can be compensated. There is likewise the possibility of attaching the run-on rings directly to the circumference of the spooling spindles instead of to the pressure rollers.<br>
A changeover of the contact force to the bearing force can thus also advantageously be brought about by a simple variation in the weight relief.<br>
During the winding of the threads, the bearing force acting between the pressure rollers and the spools is kept essentially constant. It is also possible,<br><br>
however, to vary the bearing force according to a predetermined force profile, in order, for example, to influence specific elasticities of the spools and consequently the spool density. The force profile may also contain what is known as wobbling in order to damp oscillations on the spooling spindles.<br>
So that, as far as possible, both spooling spindles can be operated at an identical rotational speed and consequently identical circumferential speeds of the spools, according to an advantageous development of the invention the spooling spindles are driven and controlled synchronously. For this purpose, the spindle drives are preferably formed by two electric motors and a control apparatus, the control apparatus being connected to the control device.<br>
During the winding and depositing of the threads on the circumference of the spools, slip phenomena are possible between the circumferential surface of the spool and the circumferential surface of the pressure roller. In order to avoid such slip phenomena occurring differently on the two pressure rollers, the development of the invention is preferably adopted in which the pressure rollers are coupled to one another mechanically or electrically in such a way that both pressure rollers rotate at the same rotational speed. For coupling, the pressure rollers are connected to one another by a gearing means. The gearing means could be designed mechanically or electrically, in order to achieve the rotational speed adaption of the two pressure rollers.<br>
In this case, the pressure rollers can also be additionally driven in opposite directions by means of an external drive, this being conducive particularly to spool-changing operations. Preferably, however, the external drive of the pressure rollers is suitable for<br><br>
producing specific load conditions between the driven spools and the pressure rollers. Thus, the external drive of the pressure rollers can be designed in such a way that there is always a conveying component or a braking component acting on the circumference of the spools. By a load condition being stipulated, the thread tension of the spooled threads can advantageously be influenced, since defined slip phenomena can be set between the pressure rollers and the spools.<br>
On account of the increase in the spool diameter, a superposed deflecting movement is additionally to be executed between the spooling spindles and the pressure rollers. Deflecting movements of this type can be executed individually or collectively, basically no contact being lost between the pressure roller and the circumference of the spools.<br>
The deflecting movements can be executed in a simple way such that, during winding, the pressure rollers and the holder are guided jointly by means of a slide in a slide guide. Identical settings of the bearing forces in the two spooling stations during the deflecting movement can consequently be ensured.<br>
In principle, however, there is also a possibility that the pressure rollers are held fixedly and the deflecting movements are executed solely by the spooling spindles. For this purpose, the spooling spindles may in each case be guided preferably synchronously by means of two movable spindle carriers. Spindle carriers of this type, which may be formed, for example, by spooling turrets, can also be used in order to make the required contact between the pressure rollers and the spooling spindles on commencement of winding.<br><br>
It is also possible, however, to execute the deflecting movement between the pressure rollers and the spooling spindles for the growth of the spools both by means of a movement of the pressure rollers and by means of a movement of the spooling spindles. Moreover, the use of a movable spindle carrier in the form of a spool turret has the advantages that, in each spooling station, a second spooling spindle can be held, so that the two spooling spindles can alternately be guided into a spooling region and a changing region.<br>
The method according to the invention is explained in more detail below by means of some exemplary embodiments of the device according to the invention, with reference to the accompanying figures in which:<br>
fig. 1 and fig.2 illustrate diagrammatically a<br>

the exemplary embodiment from fig. 1; fig. 4 shows diagrammatically a drive concept<br>
of the exemplary embodiment from fig. 1, and fig. 5 shows diagrammatically a further drive<br>
concept of the exemplary embodiment from fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 1 to fig. 3 illustrate an exemplary embodiment of the device according to the invention for carrying out the method according to the invention. In this case, fig. 1 and fig. 2 show a front view in different operating situations and fig. 3 shows a side view of the exemplary embodiment. In as much as there is no<br><br>
reference made to one of the figures, the following description applies to all the figures.<br>
The exemplary embodiment of the device according to the invention has two spooling stations 29.1 and 29.2 which are formed next to one another in a machine stand 12. In this case, the spooling stations 29.1 and 29.2 are designed mirror-symmetrically with respect to a central plane of symmetry. Thus, the right spooling station 29.1 consists of a spindle carrier 10.1 mounted rotatably in the machine stand 12. A first projecting spooling spindle 7.1 and, offset at 180°, a second proj ecting spooling spindle 11.1 are held on the spindle carrier 10.1. In this case, the first spooling spindle 7.1 is in an operating position for winding a plurality of threads. The second spooling spindle 11.1 is in a changing position for the exchange of full bobbins for empty spooling tubes.<br>
Mirror-symmetrically with respect to the spindle carrier 10.1, a second spindle carrier 10.2 arranged in the same plane is held in the machine stand 12 in the second spooling station 29.2. The spindle carrier 10.2 carries the projecting spooling spindles 7.2 and 11.2. In the operating situation illustrated, the spooling spindle 7.1 is in the operating position and the spooling spindle 11.2 is in a changing position.<br>
In this exemplary embodiment, the spindle carriers 10.1 and 10.2 are designed as spooling turrets which are held so as to be mounted rotatably in the machine stand 12. The two spooling turrets 10.1 and 10.2 are coupled to a common rotary drive 30, the spooling turrets 10.1 and 10.2 being capable of being driven in an opposite direction of rotation. The rotary drive 3 0 is connected to a central control device 21. Each of the spooling spindles 7.1, 7.2, 11.1 and 11.2 held on the spindle carriers 10.1 and 10.2 is assigned a spindle drive,<br><br>
fig. 2 showing the spindle drives 23.2 and 31.2 of the spooling spindles 7.2 and 11.2 of the spooling station 29.2. The spindle drives 23.1, 23.2, 31.1 and 31.2 of the spooling spindles of the two spooling stations 29.1 and 29.2 are connected to the central control device 21.<br>
Each of the spindle carriers 10.1 and 10.2 is preceded in the thread run in each case by a pressure roller 6.1 and 6.2. In the spooling station 29.1, in this case, the pressure roller 6.1 co-operates with the spooling spindle 7.1, in order to wind a thread group 1.1 in each case into a spool 9.1. During the winding of the threads, the pressure roller 6.1 bears against the circumference of the spools 9.1 to be wound.<br>
In the spooling station 29.2, correspondingly, the pressure roller 6.2 co-operates with the spooling spindle, in this case 7.2, located in the operating position, in order to wind a second thread group 1.2 into spools 9.2. In this case, too, the pressure roller 6.2 bears against the circumference of the spools 9.2 to be wound.<br>
The pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 are mounted rotatably on a holder 13 and are connected rigidly to one another by means of the holder 13. The holder 13 carries a traversing device 4 preceding the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2. The traversing device 4 is arranged in a central plane between the spooling stations 29.1 and 29.2 and has for each spooling station 29.1 and 29.2 a plurality of traversing thread guides 5.1 and 5.2 by means of which the inrunning threads of the thread groups 1,1 and 1.2 are shifted to and fro within the traversing strokes. The traversing device 4 can be formed, for example, by a reverse-threaded shaft which has on the circumference one * or more grooves for guiding the traversing thread guides 5.1 and 5.2.<br><br>
A thread guide carrier 3 which carries two groups of thread guides 2.1 and 2.2 is provided on a top side of the holder 13. In this case, the group of thread guides 2.1 is assigned to the spooling station 29.1 and the group of thread guides 2.2 is assigned to the spooling station 29.2.<br>
The holder 13 is held vertically movably on the machine stand 12 by means of a slide 15 and the slide guides 14.1 and 14.2. The slide 15 is in this case held in the slide guides 14.1 and 14.2 by means of a force generator 32, in such a way that the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 bear in each case with a predetermined bearing force against the respective spools 9.1 and 9.2 during the winding of the threads of the thread groups<br>
1.1	and 1.2. The force generator 32 is formed by two relief cylinder units 16.1 and 16.2, by means of which the overall weight of the two pressure rollers 6.1 and<br>
6.1	and of the holder 13 and the components, such as the traversing device 4, which are attached additionally to the holder 13 is supported. The relief cylinder units 16.1 and 16.2, which engage on the slide 15 on both sides of the device, are connected to a control device 21, by means of which the relief cylinder units 16.1 and 16.2 can be controlled in their supporting action. Thus, the bearing force acting between the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 and the spools 9.1 and 9.2 during the winding of the threads is determined by a weight fraction of the overall weight.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment shown in fig. 1 to 3, in each case four threads of the thread groups 1.1 and 1.2 are wound into a spool 9.1 and 9.2 in the spooling stations 29.1 and 29.2. The device is shown at the commencement of the spooling operation in fig. 1 and during the spooling operation in fig. 2 and 3.<br><br>
So that the threads can be wound into bobbins, a plurality of spooling tubes 8.1 and 8,2 plugged on one behind the other are held on the spooling spindles 7,1 and 7.2. In this case, even more than four spooling tubes may be held simultaneously by a spooling spindle 7.1 and the spooling spindle 7.2.<br>
A run-on ring 17.1 and 17.2 is held in each case at the bearing end of the spooling spindles 7.1 and 7.2. The run-on rings 17.1 and 17.2 are designed identically in their outside diameter. In this case, the outside diameter of the run-on rings 17.1 and 17.2 is designed to be somewhat larger than the diameters of the spooling tubes 8.1 and 8.2. Preferably, however, the run-on rings 17.1 and 17.2 are arranged on the circumference of the pressure roller 6.1 and 6.2.<br>
In order to commence a spooling operation on the spooling spindles 7.1 and 7.2, the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 are guided into a lower position by means of the slide 15 and the relief cylinder unit 16.1 and 16.2. By means of the control device 21, in the relief cylinder units 16.1 and 16.2 a relief pressure is set which allows an only slight weight compensation of the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 and of the holder 13. Between the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6,2 and the spooling spindles 7.1 and 7.2, then, a contact force takes effect which causes the pressure roller 6.1 to come up against the circumference of the run-on ring 17.1 and the pressure roller 6.2 to come up against the circumference of the run-on ring 17.2. In this case, it is unimportant whether the threads are guided for first piecing or, in the event of a spool change, by means of auxiliary devices not illustrated in any more detail here. The spooling spindles 7.1 and 7.2 are then ready for receiving the threads of the thread groups 1.1 and 1.2. This situation is shown in fig. 1. For this purpose, the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 and the<br><br>
spooling spindles 7.1 and 7.2 have parallel elasticities, in order to acquire a uniform bearing contact over the entire length.<br>
After the threads of the thread groups 1.1 and 1.2 have been caught and wound on the spooling tubes 8.1 and 8.2, a changeover of the contact force to a bearing force is initiated by the control device. For this purpose, the relief cylinder units 16.1 and 16.2 are activated, so that a higher relief pressure for supporting the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 becomes effective. The pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 bear with the bearing force against the circumference of the spools 9.1 and 9.2 which are being formed. This situation is illustrated in fig. 3.<br>
The bearing force is preferably kept constant during the winding of the threads on the spooling spindles 7.1 and 7.2. For this purpose, for example, the relief pressure in the relief cylinder units 16.1 and 16.2 is set at a predetermined value, sensed and regulated by the control device 21. By means of such pressure regulation, the deflecting movement of the slide 15 can also advantageously be controlled. Such controls or regulating operations for slides in spooling machines are generally known and are described in more detail, for example, in DE 2 5 44 773 Al, so that no further explanation is given here.<br>
Basically, in this exemplary embodiment, the deflecting movement required on account of the growth of the spools 9.1 and 9.2 during the winding of the threads of the thread groups 1.1 and 1.2 can be executed both by means of the movably held holder 13 and by means of the movably held spooling spindles 7.1 and 7.2. Owing to the fixed arrangement of the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 on the holder 13, the growth of the spools 9.1 and 9.2 can take place synchronously as a result of the<br><br>
movement of the slide 15.<br>
To perform a deflecting movement, the rotary drive 3 0 of the spindle carriers 10.1 and 10.2 can be operated preferably in steps or continuously. In this case, the two spindle carriers 10.1 and 10.2 are coupled to one another by means of a gearing means, so that, during winding, an identical center distance between the spooling spindles and the assigned pressure rollers can always be maintained, which then increases in steps or continuously.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates the operating situation in which the spools 9.1 and 9.2 are just prior to completion. The holder 13 with the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 is held on the machine stand 12 just prior to an upper position of the slide 15. The deflecting movement during the winding of the spools 9.1 and 9.2 on the spooling spindles 7.1 and 7.2 has in this case been executed essentially by means of the movement of the slide 15. A predetermined bearing force between the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 of the spools 9.1 and 9.2 is set independently of the deflecting movement of the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2. As soon as the spools 9.1 and 9.2 have reached their prescribed final diameter, a change takes place. For this purpose, the spindle carrier 10.1 is rotated clockwise and the spindle carrier 10.2 is rotated counterclockwise, so the respective spooling spindles 11.1 and 11.2 come into the operating range and can continue the spooling of the threads of the thread groups 1.1 and 1.2. After the spooling spindles 11.1 and 11.2 have come into the operating range, the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 are guided into their lower position by means of the slide 15. A changeover from the bearing force to the contact force simultaneously takes place, so that the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 come up against .the respective run-on rings of the spooling spindles 11.1 and 11.2.<br><br>
After the thread change, a new spooling travel commences.<br>
To explain the drive concept of the above-described exemplary embodiment of the device according to the invention, two possible examples are explained below with reference to figures 4 and 5. For the sake of clarity, only those device parts of the spooling stations 29.1 and 29.2 which are required for the drive are illustrated diagrammatically in a rear view in figures 4 and 5.<br>
In the drive concept according to fig. 4, in the spooling station 29.1, the spooling spindle 7.1 is coupled to a spindle drive 23.1 via a spindle end 22.1. The spindle drive 23.1 is assigned a control apparatus 24.1 which is connected to the overriding control device 21. The spool 9.1 wound on the spooling spindle 7.1 is in this case illustrated by dashes. The freely rotatably mounted pressure roller 6.1, which is likewise illustrated by dashes, bears against the circumference of the spool 9.1. The pressure roller 6.1 has a roller end 18.1. The roller end 18.1 is assigned a rotational speed sensor 20, by means of which the rotational speed of the pressure roller 6.1 can be detected. The rotational speed sensor 20 is connected to the control device 21.<br>
In the second spooling station 29.2, the spooling spindle 7.2 is coupled to the spindle drive 23.2 by means of the spindle end 22.2. The spindle drive 23.2 is assigned a control apparatus 24.2 which is likewise connected to the control device 21. The spool 9.2, likewise illustrated by dashes, which is formed on the circumference of the spooling spindle 7.2 is in contact with the second pressure roller 6.2. The pressure roller 6.2 of the second spooling station 29.2 is likewise held freely rotatably. The pressure roller 6.2<br><br>
is in this case coupled with a roller end 18.2 to the pressure roller 6.1 of the first spooling station 29.1 by a gearing means 19. In this exemplary embodiment, the gearing means 19 is designed mechanically in the form of a belt or chain, so that the two pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 of the two spooling stations rotate at the same rotational speed. For winding the threads 1.1 in the spooling station 29.1, the spooling spindle 7.1 is driven clockwise by the spindle drive 23.1. The pressure roller 6.1 bears against the circumference of the spool 9.1 to be wound and is driven frictionally in the opposite direction.<br>
In the spooling station 29.2, the spooling spindle 7.2 is driven counterclockwise by the spindle drive 23.2, in order to wind the thread 1.2 into the spool 9.2. In this case, the pressure roller 6.2 rotates clockwise on the circumference of the spool 9.2 at the corresponding rotational speed of the pressure roller 6.1. Rotational transmission between the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 takes place by the gearing means 19. The two spooling stations 29.1 and 29.2 are wound synchronously, so that an identical construction of the spools 9.1 and 9.2 takes place on each of the spooling spindles 7.1 and 7.2.<br>
In order to obtain a constant winding speed of the threads 1.1 and 1.2, the rotational speed of the pressure roller 6.1 is detected continuously by the rotational speed sensor 20 and fed to the control device 21. A desired rotational speed of the pressure roller 6.1 is filed in the control device 21. As soon as an inadmissible deviation is detected between the sensed actual rotational speed of the pressure roller 6.1 and the filed desired rotational speed of the pressure roller 6.1, a control signal is generated and fed to the control apparatuses 24.1 and 24.2. ,: The control apparatuses 24.1 and 24.2 vary the drive<br><br>
rotational speeds of the spindle drives 23 . 1 and 23.2 in the desired direction such that a changed actual rotational speed is obtained on the pressure roller 6.1. A constant circumferential speed of the spools 9.1 and 9.2 can consequently be set during the entire winding of the threads 1.1 and 1.2. The spindle drives<br>
23.1	and 23.2 are in this case preferably formed by asynchronous motors.<br>
The exemplary embodiment illustrated in fig. 5 is essentially identical to the exemplary embodiment according to fig. 4. In this case, the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 are driven by an external drive 25 which is formed in this case by two electric motors 28.1 and<br>
28.2	and an assigned control apparatus 27. The electrical coupling of the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 can consequently be combined with an external drive 25.<br>
It is also possible, however, to couple the pressure rollers 6.1 and 6.2 to a gearing means and to drive them by means of only one electric motor.<br>
As compared with the exemplary embodiment according to fig. 4, the spooling spindles 7.1 and 7.2 are driven in each case by the spindle drives 23.1 and 23.2. The spindle drives 23.1 and 23.2 may in this case be designed as an asynchronous motor or as a synchronous motor. The spindle drives 23.1 and 23.2 are assigned a control apparatus 24. The control apparatus 24 is connected to the control device 21 and, together with the rotational speed sensor 20, forms a closed loop in order to keep the circumferential speed of the spools 9.1 and 9.2 constant.<br>
The method according to the invention and the device according to the invention are not restricted to the arrangement of the individual assemblies which is illustrated according to fig. 1 and 3. Thus, for<br><br>
example, the spooling spindles can be held on immovable spindle carriers. Moreover, there is also the possibility of generating the contact force by means of a weight load in the event that higher forces or weights which are too low are available.<br>
The method according to the invention and the device according to the invention are not restricted to the arrangement of the individual assemblies which is illustrated according to fig. 1.<br>
In principle, in particular, the pressure rollers in the spooling stations may be held radially movably with respect to the spooling spindles by means of a rocker 1. The holding of the spooling spindles and of the pressure rollers is critical essentially only for the execution of the deflecting movement. However, the circumferential speed of the spool is always to be set independently of the reflecting movement, in such a way that the threads can be wound at an identical winding speed and therefore essentially with a constant thread tension.<br><br>
