				<td>The present invention relates to the technical field of storing gas including meth¬ane and hydrogen, in particular to the fuel cell technology. In particular, it relates to a method of using a metallo-organic framework material comprising pores and at least one metal ion and at least one at least bidentate organic compound, which is bound, preferably coordinately bound to said metal ion for uptaking, or storing, or releasing, or uptaking and storing, or uptaking and releasing, or storing and releasing or uptaking, storing and releasing at least one gas and an apparatus com¬prising the material defined above.<br>
Fuel cell technology is regarded as one of the core technologies of the 21st cen¬tury, e.g. in relation to stationary applications, such as power plants, mobile appli¬cations such as cars, busses and trucks and portable applications, such as cellular phones and laptops and in so called APUs, such as the power supply in power plants. The reason therefor lies in the increased efficiency of fuel cells compared to normal combustion engines. Furthermore, the fuel cell produces significantly less emissions. An overview of the current developments in fuel cell technology may be found in Hynek et al. "Int. J. Hydrogen Energy", 22, no. 6, pp. 601 - 610 (1997), J.A. Kerres "Journal of Membrane Science", 185- 2001, p. 3 - 27 and a further review article by G. March in "Materials Today", 4, No.2 (2001), p. 20 -24.<br>
The use of metallo-organic complexe for storing gaseous CI to C4 carbohydrates is disclosed in EP-A 0 727 608. However, the complexes disclosed therein are difficult to synthesize. Furthermore, their storing capacity is low, if not too low to be industrially applicable.<br><br>
Another attempt to provide materials useful for storing gases is the use of alkali-doped or undoped carbon nanotubes. An overview of the present status of re¬search regarding this approach may be found in Yang, "Carbon" 38 (2000), pp. 623 - 641 and Cheng et al. "Science" 286, pp. 1127 - 1129.<br>
In view of the above recited prior art, an object of the invention is to be seen in the provision of new materials which are particularly useful for storing and/or retaining and/or releasing gases.<br>
This object is solved by and the present invention relates to a method for uptak-ing, or storing, or releasing, or uptaking and storing, or uptaking and releasing, or storing and releasing or uptaking, storing and releasing at least one gas character¬ized in that the gas is uptaken, or stored, or released, or uptaken and stored, or uptaken and released, or stored and released or uptaken, stored and released by an agent comprising a metallo-organic framework material comprising pores and at least one metal ion and at least one at least bidentate organic compound, which is bound, preferably coordinately bound to said metal ion.<br>
The present invention further relates to a device for uptaking, or storing, or releas¬ing, or uptaking and storing, or uptaking and releasing, or storing and releasing, or uptaking, storing and releasing at least one gas, preferably a fuel cell, accommo¬dating a metallo-organic framework material, as defined herein.<br>

Generally the materials are used in the form of pellets or in film or sheet-like form for the pur¬pose of this invention. However, the above methods allow to prepare various fur¬ther and different geometries and shapes, which are necessary for the widespread application areas of said materials according to the present invention, particularly when used in mobile and mobile portable applications.<br>

Method of using the fuel cell according to claim 10 for supplying power to power plants, cars, trucks, busses, cell phones, laptops.<br>
The invention is now further described by way of the following examples, which are, however, not meant to limit the scope of the present application.<br>
Examples<br>
Figure 1 shows a X-ray powder diffractogramm of the MOF-5 framework mate¬rial as prepared according to Example 1.<br>
Figure 2 shows the sorption isotherm of argon on MOF-5 at 87K.<br>
Figure 3 shows the hydrogen sorption isotherm of hydrogen on MOF-5 at 30 °C.<br>
Example 1 (Preparation of MOF-5)<br><br>
Starting Material	Molar Amount	Calculated	Experimental<br>
terephthalic acid	"12.3 mmol	2.04 g	2.04 g<br>
zinc nitrate-tetra hy¬drate	36.98 mmol	9.67 g	9.68 g<br>
diethylformamide<br>
(Merck)	2568.8 mmol	282.2 g	282.2 g<br><br>
The above-mentioned amounts of the starting materials were dissolved in a beaker in the order diethylformamide, terephthaJic acid and zinc nitrate. The resulting solution was introduced into two autoclaves (250 ml), having respectively inner walls which were covered by teflon.<br>
The crystallization occurred at 105° C within twenty hours. Subsequently, the orange solvent was decanted from the yellow crystals, said crystals were again covered by 20 ml di methylformamide, the latter being again decanted. This pro¬cedure was repeated three times. Subsequently, 20 ml chloroform were poured onto the solid, which was washed and decanted by said solvent two times.<br>
The crystals (14.4 g), which were still moist, were introduced into a vacuum de¬vice and first at room temperature in vacuo (10^* mbar), afterwards dried at 120X.<br>
Subsequently, the resulting product was characterized by X-ray powder diffrac¬tion and an adsorptive determination of micropores. The resulting product shows the X-ray diffractogramm according to Figure 1, which coincides with MOF-5.<br>
The determination of the sorption isotherm, as depicted in Figure 2, with argon (87K; Micromeritics ASAP 2010) shows an isotherm of type I. being typical for microporous materials, and having a specific surface area of 3020 m /g, calculated according to Langmuir, and a micropore volume of 0.97 ml/g (at a relative pres¬sure p/p°= 0,4).<br>
Example 2<br><br>
By using a magnetic suspension balance of the company Rubofherm Prazis-sionsmesstechnik GmbH, Bochum the storing capacity for hydrogen of the sample of Example 1 was determined as follows. The sample was weighed, introduced into the apparatus. After closing and evacuating the same to a pressure of 10s mbar by way of a membrane prepump and a turbo molecular pump the sample was heated under vacuum at 100°C for 16 h.<br>
After thermostabilizing the sample at a temperature of 30°C, hydrogen (purity 99,999 %; company Messer) was added at various pressures according to Fig. 3. The resulting sorption isotherm is shown in Fig. 3. This figure shows that at a hydrogen pressure of about 150 mbar the sample is capable of storing about 1 wt.-% hydrogen relative to the total weight of the activated sample. Under further increased pressure the storing capacity even increases.<br>
Example 3 (comparative)<br>
By using the same experimental setup and the same procedure as in Example 2 the storing capacity for hydrogen of activated carbon (company CECA, AC 40; spe¬cific surface area according to Langmuir 2037 m2/g) was measured. Fig. 3 shows the significantly less capacity of activated carbon compared to MOF-5.<br><br><br>
