This means that the SiO2 / XaG&amp; mo!e ratio can be infinity, i.e., there is no X13Oi3 in the reaction mixture This results in a version of SSZ-75 that is essentially all silica. As used herein, "essentially all silicon oxide" or "essentially ail- silica" means that the molecular sieve's crystal structure is comprised of only silicon oxide or is comprised of silicon oxide and only trace amounts of other oxides, such as aluminum oxide, which may be introduced as impurities in the source of silicon oxide.<br><br>
In practice, SSZ-75 is prepared by a process comprising-<br><br>
(a) preparing an aqueous solution containing (1} a source(s) of silicon oxide. (2) a source(s) of aluminum oxide, gallium oxide, iron oxide, boron oxide, titanium oxide, indium oxide and mixtures thereof. (3) a source of fluoride ion and (4) a tetramethyfene-1 , 4~bis-{N- methylpyrrolidinium) dication having an anionic counterion which is not detrimental to the formation of SSZ-75; (b) maintaining the aqueous solution under conditions sufficient to form crystals of SSZ-75; and (c) recovering the crystals of SSZ-75.<br><br>
The reaction mixture is maintained at an elevated temperature until the crystals of the SSZ-75 are formed. The hydrotherma! crystallization is usually conducted under autogenous pressure, at a temperature between IQO0C and 2000C, preferably between 135"C and 1800C. The crystallization period is typically greater than 1 day an? preferably from about 3 days to about 20 days. The molecular sieve may be prepared ussng mild stirring or agitation.<br><br>
During the hydrothermal crystallization step, the SSZ-75 crystals can be allowed to nucleate spontaneously from the reaction mixture. The use of SSZ-75 crystals as seed material can be advantageous in decreasing the time <br><br>
necessary for complete crystallization to occur, in addition, seeding can iead to an increased purify of the product obtained by promoting the nucleation and/or formation of SSZ-75 over any undesired phases. When used as seeds, SSZ-75 crystals are added in an amount between 0.1 and 10% of the weight of the first tetravalent element oxsde, e.g. siiiea, used in the reaction mixture.<br><br>
Once the molecular sieve crystals have formed, the solid product is separated from the reaction mixture by standard mechanical separation techniques such as filtration, The crystals are water-washed and then dried, e.g., at 900C to 15CPC for from 8 to 24 hours, to obtain the as-synthesized SSZ-75 crystals. The drying step can be performed at atmospheric pressure or under vacuum.<br><br>
SSZ-75 as prepared has the X-ray diffraction lines of Table ! below SSZ-75 has a composition, as synthesized (i.eM prior to removal of the SDA from the SSZ-75) and in the anhydrous state, comprising the following (in terms of mole ratios):<br><br>

Calcination can result in changes in the 6 intensities of the peaks as compared to patterns of the "as-synthesized" 7 material, as well as minor shifts in the diffraction pattern.<br><br>
9 Crystalline SSZ-75 can be used as-synthesized, but preferably will be 0 thermally treated (calcined). Usually, it ss desirable to remove the alkali metal 1 cation (if any) by ion exchange and replace it with hydrogen, ammonium, or 2 any desired metal ion. Calcined SSZ-75 has an n~hexane adsorption capacity 3 of about 0.15 cc/g 4 <br><br>
SSZ-75 can be formed into a wide variety of physical shapes. Generally speaking, the molecular sieve can be in the form of a powder, a granule, or a molded product, such as extrudate having a particle size sufficient to pass through a 2-mesh (Tyler) screen and be retained on a 400-mesh (Tyler) screen. In cases where the catalyst is molded, such as by extrusion with an organic binder, the SSZ-75 can be extruded before drying, or, dried or partially dried and then extruded.<br><br>
SSZ-75 can be composited with other materials resistant to the temperatures and other conditions employed in organic conversion processes. Such matrix materials include active and inactive materials and synthetic or naturally occurring zeolites as well as inorganic materials such as clays, silica and metal oxides. Examples of such materials and the manner in which they can be used are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,910,006, issued May 20, 1880 to Zones et a!., and U.S. Patent No, 5,318,753, issued May 31, 1994 to Nakagawa, both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.<br><br>
Hydrocarbon Conversion Processes<br><br>
SSZ-75 molecular sieves are useful in hydrocarbon conversion reactions. Hydrocarbon conversion reactions are chemical and catalytic processes in which carbon containing compounds are changed to different carbon containing compounds. Examples of hydrocarbon conversion reactions in which SSZ-75 is expected to be useful include hydrocracking. dewaxing, catalytic cracking and olefin and aromatics formation reactions. The cataiysts are also expected to be useful in other petroleum refining and hydrocarbon conversion reactions such as Isornepzing n-parsffins and naphthenes, polymerizing and oiigomerizing oieftnic or acetylenic compounds such as isob?tylene and butene-1 , polymerization of 1 -olefins (e.g., ethylene), reforming, isomerizing poiyaikyl substituted aromatics (e.g., m-xylene), and disproportionating aromatics (e g., toluene) to provide mixtures of benzene, xylenes and higher methylbepzenes and oxidation reactions Also included <br><br>
are rearrangement reactions to make various naphthalene derivatives, and forming higher molecular weight hydrocarbons from lower molecular weight hydrocarbons (e.g., methane upgrading).<br><br>
The SSZ-75 catalysts may haye high selectivity, and under hydrocarbon conversion conditions can provide a high percentage of desired products relative to total products.<br><br>
For high catalytic activity, the SSZ-75 molecular sieve should be predominantly in its hydrogen ion form Generally, the molecular sieve is converted to its hydrogen form by ammonium exchange followed by calcination. !f the molecular sieve is synthesized with a high enough ratio of SDA cation to sodium ion, calcination alone may be sufficient. It is preferred that, after calcination, at least 80% of the cation srtes are occupied by hydrogen ions and/or rare earth ions. As used herein, "predominantly in the hydrogen form" means thai, after calcination, at least 80% of the cation sites are occupied by hydrogen ions and/or rare earth ions.<br><br>
SSZ-75 molecular sieves can be used in processing hydrocarbonaceous feedstocks. Hydrocarbonaceous feedstocks contain carbon compounds and can be from many different sources, such as virgin petroleum fractions, recycle petroleum fractions, shaie oil liquefied coal, tar sand oil, synthetic paraffins from NAO, recycled plastic feedstocks. Other feeds include synthetic feeds, such as those derived from a Fischer Tropseh process. including an oxygenate-confaining Fischer Tropseh process boiling below about 3710C (7000F) in general, the feed can be any carbon containing feedstock susceptible to zeoiitic catalytic reactions. Depending on the type of processing the hydrocarbonaceous feed is to undergo, the feed can contain metal or be free of metals, it can also have high or low nitrogen or suifur impurities it can be appreciated, however, that in general processing will be more efficient (and the catalyst more active) the lower the metal, nitrogen, and sulfur content of the feedstock. <br><br>
The conversion of hydrocarbopaceous feeds can take ptøee in any convenient mode, for example, in fluidszed bed, moving bed, or fixed bed reactors depending on the types of process desired. The formulation of the catalyst particles vviil vary depending on the conversion process and method of operation.<br><br>
Other reactions which can be performed using the catalyst of this invention containing a metal, e.g., a Group VHS metal such platinum, include hytirogenation-dehydrogenation reactions, denitrogenatiors and desulfurizaiiop reactions.<br><br>

9 No. 5,316,753. 0 1 The hydrocracksng catalysts contain an effective amount of at least one 2 hydrøgenatian component of the type commonly employed in hydrocrackipg 3 catalysts. The hydrogenation component is generally selected from the group 4 of hydrogenation catalysts consisting of one or more metals of Group VSB and 5 Group VUi. including the salts, complexes and solutions containing such. The 8 hydrogenation catalyst is preferably selected from the group of metals, salts 7 and complexes thereof of the group consisting of at least one of platinum, 8 palladium, rhodium, iridium, ruthenium and mixtures thereof or the group 9 consisting of at least one of nickel, molybdenum, cobalt, tungsten, titanium, 0 chromium and mixtures thereof. Reference to the catalyticaJly active metal or 1 metals is intended to encompass such metal or metals in the elemental state 2 or in some form such &amp;s an oxide, sulfide, halide, carboxyiate and the like. 3 The hydrogenation catalyst is present in an effective amount to provide the 4 hydrogenation function of the hydrocrackipg catalyst, and preferably in the 5 range of from 0.05 to 25% by weight. 6 7 Dewaxing 8 9 For dewaxing processes, the catalyst comprises a molecular sieve having STi 0 ipology and having a mole ratio of at feast 15 of (1} an oxide of a first 1 teiravaient element to (2) an oxide of a trivalent element, pentavalent element, 2 second tetravalent element which is different from said first tetravaient 3 element or mixture thereof- Thus, the molecular sieve may be SSZ-75 or <br><br>
TNU-1Q, preferably predominantly in the hydrogen form. The catalyst can be used to dewax hydrocarbopaceous feeds by selectively removing straight chain paraffins. Typically, the viscosity index of the dewaxed product is improved (compared to the waxy feed) when the waxy feed is contacted with SSZ-75 or TNU-10 under isomerizatiop dewaxipg conditions,<br><br>
The catalytic dewaxipg conditions are dependent in large measure on the feed used and upon the desired pour point. Hydrogen is preferably present in the reaction zone during the catalytic dewaxipg process. The hydrogen to feed ratio is typically between about 500 and about 30,000 SCF/bbi {standard cubic feet per barrel) (0.089 to 5.34 SCiWliter (standard cubic meters/liter)), preferably about 1000 to about 20,000 SCF/bbl (0,178 to 3.58 SCM/iiter). Generally, hydrogen will be separated from the product and recycled to the reaction zone. Typical feedstocks include light gas oil. heavy gas oils and reduced crudes boiling above about 3500F (1770C)<br><br>
A typical dewaxing process is the catalytic dewaxing of a hydrocarbon oil feedstock boiling above about 3500F (177X) and containing straight chain and slightly branched chasn hydrocarbons by contacting the hydrocarbon oil feedstock in the presence of added hydrogen gas at a hydrogen pressure of about 15-3000 pss (0,103-20.7 Mpa} with a catalyst comprising SSZ-75 and at least one Group VIi i metal<br><br>
The SS2-75 or TNU-10 hydrodewaxing catalyst may optionally contain a hydrogenattop component of the type commonly employed In dewaxing catalysts. See the aforementioned U S. Patent No 4,910,006 and U.S. Patent No 5.316,753 for examples of these hydrogenation components.<br><br>
The hydrogenation component is present in an effective amount to provide an effective hydrodewaxing and hydraisomerizatton catalyst preferably tn the range of from about 0.05 to 5% by weight. The catalyst may be run in such a mode to increase isomerization dewaxing at the expense of cracking reactions. <br><br>
The feed may be hydrocracked, followed by dewaxing. This type of two stage process and typical hydrocracking conditions are described in U.S. Patent No, 4,921 ,594, issued May 1 , 1990 to Miller, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br><br>
SSZ-75 or TNU-10 may also be utilized as a combination of catalysts That is, the catalyst comprises a combination comprising molecular sieve SSZ-75 or TNU-10 and at least one Group VlII metal, and a second catalyst comprising an aiummosificate zeolite which is more shape selective than molecular sieve SSZ-7S or TNlMO. The combination may be comprised of iayers. The use of layered catalysts is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,149.421 , issued September 22, 1992 to Miller, which Js incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The layering may also include a bed of SSZ- 75 or TNU=IO layered with a non zeolitic component designed for either hydrocracking or hydrofinishing.<br><br>
SSZ-75 or ?NU-10 may also be used to dewax raffinaies, including bright stock, under conditions such as those disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 4,181 ,598, issued January 1 , 1980 to Giilespie et at., which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety,<br><br>
it is often desirable to use mild hydrogenation (sometimes referred to as hydrofinishing) to produce more stable dewaxed products. The hydrofinishing step can be performed either before or after the dewaxing step, and preferably after, Hydrofinishing is typically conducted at temperatures ranging from about 1900C to about 3400C at pressures from about 400 pssg to about 3000 psig (2.76 to 20.7 Mpa gauge) at space velocities (LHSV) between about 0.1 and 20 and a hydrogen recycle rate of about 400 to 1500 SCF/bbi {0.071 to 0.27 SCM/liter). The hydrogenation catalyst employed must be active enough not only to hydrogena÷e the olefins, diolefins and color bodies which may be present, but also to reduce the aromatic content. Suitable hydrogenation catalyst are disclosed in U. S. Patent No 4,921 ,594. issued <br><br>
May 1 , 1990 to Miller, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The hydrofinishipg step is beneficial in preparing an acceptably stable product (e.g., a lubricating oil) since dewaxed products prepared from hydrocracked stocks tend to be unstable to air and light and tend to form sludges spontaneously and quickly.<br><br>
Lube oil may be prepared using SSZ-75 or TNU-10. For example, a C2o+ lube oil may be made by isornerizing a C2o+ olefin feed over a catalyst comprising SSZ-75 or TNU-10 in the hydrogen form and at least one Group VH! metal. Alternatively, the lubricating oil may be made by hydrocrackipg in a hydrocracking zone a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock to obtasn an effluent comprising a hydrocracked oil and catalyticalfy dewaxmg the effluent at a temperature of at least about 4000F {204°C} and at a pressure of from about 15 psig to about 3000 psig (0.103-20.7 Mpa gauge) in the presence of added hydrogen gas with a catalyst comprising SSZ-75 or TNU -1 OF in the hydrogen form and at least one Group ViM metal.<br><br>
Aromatics Formation<br><br>
SS2-75 can be used to convert tight straight run naphthas and similar mixtures to highly aromatic mixtures. Thus, normal and slightly branched chained hydrocarbons, preferably having a boiling range above about 40cC and less than about 2000C1 can be converted to products having a substantial higher octane aromatics content by contacting the hydrocarbon feed with a catalyst comprising SSZ-75. it is also possible to convert heavier feeds into BTX or naphthalene derivatives of value using a catalyst comprising SSZ-75.<br><br>
The conversion catalyst preferably contains a Group VIiS metal compound to have sufficient activity for commercial use. By Group VlIi metal compound as used herein is meant the metal itself or a compound thereof. The Group VII! noble metals and their compounds, platinum, palladium, and iridium, or combinations thereof can be used. Rhenium or tin or a mixture thereof may also be used sn conjunction with the Group VHI metal compound and<br><br>
")« <br><br>
preferably a noble metal compound. The most preferred rneta! is platinum. The amount of Group VlII metal present in the conversion catalyst should De within the normal range of use in reforming catalysts, from about 0.05 to 2.0 weight percent preferably 0.2 to 0,8 weight percent,<br><br>
It is critical to the selective production of aromatics in useful quantities that the conversion catalyst be substantially free of acidity, for example, by neutralizing the molecular sieve with a basic metal, e.g., alkali metal, compound. Methods for rendering the catalyst free of acidity are known in the art. See the aforementioned U. S Patent No. 4,910,006 and U.S. Patent No. 5,316,753 for a description of such methods.<br><br>
The preferred alkali metals are sodium, potassium, rubidium and cesium. The molecular sieve Itself can be substantially free of acidity only at very high silsca.al?mina moie ratios.<br><br>
CMiJ?tjc..Crackma<br><br>
Hydrocarbon cracking stocks can be cataiytically cracked in the absence of hydrogen using SSZ-75, preferably predominantly in the hydrogen form.<br><br>
When SSZ-75 is used as a catalytic cracking catalyst in the absence of hydrogen, the catalyst may be employed in conjunction with traditional cracking catalysts, e.g., any al?minosilicate heretofore employed as a component in cracking catalysts. Typically, these are large pore, crystalline aluminosilicaies. Examples of these traditional cracking catalysts are disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 4,910,006 and U.S. Patent Ho 5.316,753. When a traditional cracking catalyst (TC) component is employed, the relative weight ratio of the TC to the SSZ-75 is generally between about 1 :10 and about 500:1 , desirably between about 1 :10 and about 200: 1 , preferably between about 1 :2 and about 50:1 , and most preferably is between about 1.1 and about 20: 1. The novel molecular sieve<br><br>
¦09- <br><br>
and/or the traditional cracking component may be furtSier ion exchanged with rare earth ions to modify selectivity,<br><br>
The cracking catalysts are typically employed with an inorganic oxide matrix component. See the aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 4,910,006 and U,S Patent No. 5,316,753 for examples of such matrix components.<br><br>
Isomejization<br><br>
The present catalyst is highly active and highly selective for isomerizing Cd to C? hydrocarbons, The activity means that the catalyst can operate at relatively low temperature which thermodypamicalSy favors highly branched paraffins, Consequently, the catalyst can produce a high octane product The high selectivity means that a relatively high liquid yield can be achieved when the catalyst is run at a high octane,<br><br>
The present process comprises contacting the isomerization catalyst, i.e.. a catalyst comprising SSZ-75 in the hydrogen form, with a hydrocarbon feed under isomerization conditions. The feed is preferably a light straight run fraction, boiling within the range of 30JF to 2500F 
<br>
it is preferable to carry out the isomerization reaction in the presence of hydrogen. Preferably, hydrogen is added to give a hydrogen to hydrocarbon ratio (Hj/HC) of between 0,5 and 10 Hj/HC, more preferably between 1 and 8 H'JHC See the aforementioned U S. Patent No. 4,810,006 and U.S. Patent No. 5,316,753 for a further discussion of isomerization process conditions.<br><br>
A low sulfur feed is especially preferred in the present process The feed preferably contains less than 10 ppm. more preferably less than 1 ppm, and <br><br>
most preferably less than O 1 ppm sulfur in the case of a feed which is not already low \r) sulfur, acceptable levels can be reached by hydrogenatipg the feed in a presaiurafion zone with a hydrogenating catalyst which is resistant to sulfur poisoning. See the aforementioned U.S. Patent No, 4,910,006 and U.S. Patent No. 5,318.753 for a further discussion of this hydrodes?lfurization process.<br><br>
it is preferable to limit the nitrogen level and the wafer content of the feed Catalysts and processes which are suitable for these purposes are known to those skilled in the art.<br><br>
After a period of operation, the catalyst can become deactivated by sulfur or coke. See the aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 4.910,006 and U.S. Patent No. 5,316,753 for a further discussion of methods of removing this sulfur and coke, and of regenerating the catalyst.<br><br>
The conversion catalyst preferably contains a Group ViH metal compound to have sufficient activity for commercial use. By Group VHi metal compound as used herein is meant the metal itself or a compound thereof. The Group VISI nobie metals and their compounds, platinum, palladium, and iridium, or combinations thereof can be used. Rhenium and tin may also be used in conjunction with the noble metal. The most preferred metal is platinum. The amount of Group VIl! metal present in the conversion catalyst should be within the normal range of use in isomerizing catalysts, from about 0.05 to 2.0 weight percent, preferably 0.2 to 0.8 weight percent.<br><br><br>
SSZ -75 can be used in a process for the aikyiation or transafkylation of an aromatic hydrocarbon. The process comprises contacting the aromatic hydrocarbon with a C2 to Ct6 olefin alkylating agent or a polyalky! aromatic hydrocarbon transalkylating agent, under at least partial liquid phase conditions, and in the presence of a catalyst comprising SSZ-75. <br><br>
SSZ-75 can also be used for removing benzene from gasoline by alkylating the benzene as described above and removing the alkylated product from the gasoline,<br><br>
For high catalytic activity, the SSZ-75 molecular sieve should be predominantly in its hydrogen ion form. It is preferred that, after calcination, at least 80% of the cation sites are occupied by hydrogen ions and/or rare earth ions.<br><br>
Examples of suitable aromatic hydrocarbon feedstocks which may be alkylated or trapsalkylated by the process of the invention include aromatic compounds such as benzene, toluene and xylene. The preferred aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene. There may be occasions where naphthalene or naphthalene derivatives such as dimeihylnaphthaiene may be desirable. Mixtures of aromatic hydrocarbons may also be employed.<br><br>
Suitable olefins for the alkylafion of the aromatic hydrocarbon are those containing 2 to 20. preferably 2 to 4, carbon atoms, such as ethylene, propylene, butene~1. trans-butene-2 and cis-butene-2, or mixtures thereof. There may be instances where pentenes are desirabie. The preferred olefins are ethylene and propylene. Longer chain alpha olefins may be used as well.<br><br>
When transaikyiation is desired, the transalkylating agent is a poiyaikyi aromatic hydrocarbon containing two or more alky! groups that each may have from 2 to about 4 carbon atoms. For example, suitable polya«ky! aromatic hydrocarbons include di-, tri- and ietra-alkyl aromatic hydrocarbons, such as diethylbenzene, triethyibenzene, diethylrnethylbenzene (d?ethyltol?ene), di-isoprapylbenzene. di-isopropyltoluene, dibufyibenzene, and the like. Preferred polyaiky! aromatic hydrocarbons are the diaiky! benzenes. A particularly preferred poiyalkyl aromatic hydrocarbon is dt-isopropylbepzene, <br><br>
When alkytation is the process conducted, reaction conditions are as follows. The aromatic hydrocarbon feed should be present in stoichiometric excess. It is preferred that molar ratio of arotnatics to olefins be greater than four-to-one to prevent rapid catalyst fouling. The reaction temperature may range from 100aF to 6000F (380C to 3150C)1 preferably 2S0T to 45G*F (1210C to 2320C). The reaction pressure should be sufficient to maintain at least a partial liquid phase in order to retard catalyst fouling. This is typically 50 psig to 1000 psig (0.345 to 8.89 Mpa gauge) depending on the feedstock and reaction temperature. Contact time may range from 10 seconds to 10 hours, but is usually from 5 minutes to an hour.

Xylene Isomerization<br><br>
SSZ-75 may also be useful in a process for isomerizing one or more xylene isomers in a C8 aromatic feed to obtain ortho-, meta-, and para-xylepe in a ratio approaching the equilibrium value. In particular, xylene isomerization is used in conjunction with a separate process to manufacture para-xyiene. For example, a portion of the para-xyiene in a mixed C3 aromatics stream may be recovered by crystallization and centrifugation The mother Itquor from the crystalhzer ss then reacted under xylene isomerization conditions to restore orthO", meta- and para-xylenes to a near equilibrium ratio. At the same time, part of the ethylbenzene in the mother liquor is converted to xylenes or to products which are easily separated by filtration. The isomerate is blended with fresh feed and the combined stream ss distilled to remove heavy and light by-products The resultant C8 aromatics stream is then sent to the crystallizer to repeat the cycle.<br><br>
Optionally, isomep'zaiion in the vapor phase is conducted in the presence of 3.0 to 30.0 moles of hydrogen per mote of a?kyibenzene (e.g., ethylbenzene). If hydrogen is used, the catalyst should comprise about 0.1 to 2.0 wt.% of a hydrogepation/dehydrogenatiop component selected from Group VH! (of the Periodic Table) metal component, especially platinum or nickel. By Group VIIi metal component is meant the metals and their compounds such as oxides and sulfides. <br><br>
Optionally, the isomerization feed may contain 10 to 90 wi of a diluent such as toluene, trimethylbenzene. naphthenes or paraffins.<br><br>

It is expected that SSZ-75 can also be used to oiigomerize straight, and branched chain olefins having from about 2 to 21 and preferably 2-5 carbon atoms. The oligomers which are the products of the process are medium to heavy olefins which are useful for both fuels, i.e., gasoline or a gasoline blending stock and chemicals.<br><br>
The oligomerization process comprises contacting the olefin feedstock in the gaseous or hquid phase with a catalyst comprising SSZ-75.<br><br>
The molecular sieve can have the original cations associated therewith replaced by a wide variety of other cations according to techniques well known in the art. Typical cations would include hydrogen, ammonium and metal cations including mixtures of the same. Of the replacing metallic cations, particular preference is given to cations of metais such as rare earth metais, manganese, calcium, as well as metals of Group Il of the Periodic Table, e.g., zinc, and Group VIiI of the Periodic Table, e.g., nickei. One of the prime requisites is that the molecular sieve have a fairly low aromatizatiop activity, i.e., in which the amount of arorpatics produced is not more than about 20% by weight. This is accomplished by using a molecular sieve with controlled acid activity (alpha value] of from about 0.1 to about 12.0, preferably from about 0.1 to about 100, as measured by its ability to crack n-hexane.<br><br>
Alpha values are defined by a standard test known in the art, e.g., as shown in U.S. Patent No 3,980,978 issued on June 1 , 1976 to Givens et ai. which is incorporated totally herein by reference.

Pojyfflei'izatiop of 1 -Olefins<br><br>
The molecular sieve of the present invention may be used in a catalyst for the polymerization of 1 -olefins, e.g., the polymerization of ethylene. To form the olefin polymerization catalyst, the molecular sieve as hereinbefore described is reacted with a particular type of organometailic compound. Grganametaliic compounds useful in forming the polymerization catalyst include trivalent and tetravaient organotilanium and organochromium compounds having alkyi moieties and, optionally, halo moieties. In the context of the present invention the term "ajkyi" includes both straight and branched chain aikyl, cycioalkyl and alkaryl groups such as benzyl.<br><br>

Preferred examples of Y include Ci. s aikyl, 6 especially butyl ? 8 The organotitanium and organochromium materials employed in the catalyst 9 can be prepared by techniques well known in the art. See, for example the 0 aforementioned Chester et ai patents. 1 2 The organotitanium or organochromium compounds can be with the 3 molecular sieve of the present invention, such as by reacting the 4 orgapometailic compound and the molecular sieve, in order to form the olefin 5 polymerization cataSyst. Generally, such a reaction takes place in the same 8 reaction medium used to prepare the organometaiitc compound under 7 conditions which promote formation of such a reaction product. The 8 molecular sieve can simply be added to the reaction mixture after formation of 9 the organometallic compound has been completed. Molecular sieve is added 0 in an amount sufficient to provide from about 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, 1 preferably from about 0.6 to 5 parts by weight, of orgapometailic compound in 2 the reaction medium per 100 parts by weight of molecular sieve. <br><br>
Temperature of the reaction medium during reaction of organometailic compound with molecular sseve is also maintained at a level which is tow enough to ensure the stability of the organometaliic reactant Thus, temperatures in the range of from about -150" C. to 50° C, preferably from about -80° C, to 0° C. can be usefully employed. Reaction times of from about 0.01 to 10 hours, more preferably from about 0.1 to 1 hour, can be employed in reacting the srganotitanium or organochromi?m compound with the molecular sieve.<br><br>
Upon completion of the reaction, the catalyst materia! so formed may be recovered and dried by evaporating the reaction medium solvent under a nitrogen atmosphere. Alternatively, olefin polymerization reactions can be conducted In this same solvent based reaction medium used to form the catalyst.<br><br>
The polymerization cataiyst can be used to catalyze polymerization of 1 - olefins. The polymers produced using the catalysts of this invention are normally solid polymers of at least one mono- 1 -olefin containing from 2 to 8 carbon atoms per moiecuie These polymers are normally solid homopoiymers of ethylene or copolymers of ethylene with another mono~t~ olefin containing 3 to 8 carbon atoms per molecule. Exemplary copolymers include those of ethylene/propylene, ethylene/1 -butene, ethyiene/i-hexane, and ethylene/1 -actene and the like. The major portion of such copolymers is derived from ethylene and generally consists of about 80-99, preferably 95-99 mole percent of ethylene. These polymers are well suited for extrusion, blow molding, injection molding and the like.<br><br>
The polymerization reaction can be conducted by contacting monomer or monomers, e.g., ethylene, alone or with one Of more other olefins, and in the substantial absence of cataiyst poisons such as moisture and air, with a catalytic amount of the supported organometa?lc catalyst at a temperature and at a pressure sufficient to initiate the polymerization reaction. If desired, <br><br>
an inert organic solvent may be used as a diluent and to facilitate materials handling if the polymerization reaction is conducted with the reactants in the Nquid phase, e.g, m a particle form (slurry) or solution process The reaction may aiso be conducted with reactants in the vapor phase, e.g., in a fluicfeed bed arrangement in the absence of a solvent but, if desired, in the presence of an inert gas such as nitrogen.<br><br>
The polymerization reaction is carried out at temperatures of from about 30a C. or less, up to about 200° C. or more, depending to a great extent on the operating pressure, the pressure of the olefin monomers, and the particular catalyst being used and its concentration. Naturally, the selected operating temperature is also dependent upon the desired polymer melt index since temperature is definitely a factor in adjusting the molecular weight of the polymer. Preferably, the temperature used is from about 30" C. to about 100' C. in a conventional slurry or "partscle forming" process or from 100" C to 1SO"3 C. in a "solution forming" process. A temperature of from about 70* C to 110" C. can be employed for fluidized bed processes.<br><br>
The pressure to be used in the polymerization reactions can be any pressure sufficient to initiate the polymerization of the monomer(s) to high molecular weight polymer. The pressure, therefore, can range from subatmospheric pressures, using an inert gas as diluent, to s?peratmospheric pressures of up to about 30,000 psig or more, The preferred pressure ?s from atmospheric (0 psig) up to about 1000 psig. As a general rule, a pressure of 20 to SOO psig is most preferred.<br><br>
The selection of an inert organic solvent medium to be employed in the solution or slurry process embodiments of this invention is not too critical, but the solvent should be inert to the supported orgapometallic catalyst and olefin polymer produced, and be stable at the reaction temperature used. It is not necessary, however, that the inert organic solvent medium aiso serve as a solvent for the polymer to be produced. Among the inert organic solvents applicable for such purposes may be mentioned saturated aliphatic <br><br>
hydrocarbons having from about 3 to 12 carbon atoms per molecule such as hexane, heptane, pentane, isooctape, purified kerosene and the like. saturated cyctoaliphatic hydrocarbons having from about 5 to 12 carbon atoms per molecule such as cyclohexane, cyclopentane, chmethylcyciopentane and methyicyciohexane and the like and aromatic hydrocarbons having from about 6 to 12 carbon atoms per moiecuie such as benzene, toluene, xylene, and the like. Particularly preferred solvent media are cyciohexane. pentane, hexane and heptane<br><br>
Hydrogen can be introduced into the polymerization reaction zone m order to decrease the molecular weight of the polymers produced (? e.. give a much higher Melt index, Ml). Partial pressure of hydrogen when hydrogen is used can be within the range of 5 to 100 psig, preferably 25 to 75 psig. The melt indices of the polymers produced sn accordance with the snstant invention can range from about 0.1 to about 70 or even higher.<br><br>

Hydtoaenation<br><br>
SS2-75 can be used in a catalyst to cataiyze hydrogenation of a hydrocarbon feed containing unsaturated hydrocarbons. The unsaturated hydrocarbons can comprise olefins, dienes, polyenes, aromatic compounds and the like.<br><br>
Hydrogenation is accomplished by contacting the hydrocarbon feed containing unsaturated hydrocarbons with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst comprising SSZ-75. The cataiyst can also contain one or more metals of Group VIB and Group VIIi, including salts, complexes and solutions thereof. Reference to these cataiyticaliy active metals is intended to <br><br>
encompass such metals or metais in the elemental state or in some form such as an oxide, sulfide, halide, carboxylate and the like. Examples of such metals include metals, salts or complexes wherein the metal is selected from the group consisting of platinum, palladium, rhodium, indium or combinations thereof, or the group consisting of nickel, molybdenum, cobalt, tungsten. titanium, chromium, vanadium, rhenium, manganese and combinations thereof.<br><br>
The hydrogenatfon component of the catalyst (i.e., the aforementioned metal) is present in an amount effective to provide the hydrogenation function of the catalyst, preferably in the range of from 0 05 to 25% by weight.<br><br>
Hydrogenation conditions, such as temperature, pressure, space velocities, contact time and the like are well known in the art.<br><br>
SSZ-75 is useful as an adsorbent for gas separations {owing to its high pore volume while maintaining diffusion control and hydrophobic^). SSZ-75 can also be used in a catalyst for converting oxygenates (such as methanol) to olefins, and for making small amines. SSZ-75 can be used to reduce oxides of nitrogen in gas streams (such as automotive exhaust). SSZ-75 can also be used as a cold start hydrocarbon trap in combustion engine pollution control systems. SSZ-75 is particularly useful for trapping C3 fragments.<br><br>
The molecular sieve of the present invention can be used to separate gasses. For example, ? can be used to separate carbon dioxide from natural gas. Typically, the molecular sieve is used as a component in a membrane that is used to separate the gasses. Examples of such membranes are disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 6,508,860, issued January 21 , 2003 to Kulkarni et at, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br><br>
The molecular sieve of the present invention can be used in a catalyst to prepare methyiamine or dimethyiamine. Dimethyiamine is generally prepared in industrial quantities by continuous reaction of methanol (and/or<br><br>
.4V <br><br>
dimethylelher) and ammonia in the presence of a siiica-aiumina catalyst. The rßactants are typically combined in the vapor phase, at temperatures in the range of 3GO0C to SOO0C, and at elevated pressures. Such a process is disclosed in U. S. Patent No 4,737,592, issued April 12, 1988 to Abrams et a!., which is incorporated by reference m its entirety.<br><br>
The catalyst is used in its acid form. Acid forms of molecular sieves can be prepared by a variety of techniques. Preferably, the molecular sieve used to prepare dimethyiamine will be in the hydrogen form, or have an alkali or alkaline earth metal, such as Na, K, Rb1 or Cs, son-exchanged into it.<br><br>
The process of the present invention involves reacting methanol, dimethylether or a mixture thereof and ammonia in amounts sufficient to provide a carbon/nitrogen (CIH) ratio from about 0.2 to about 1.5, preferably about 0.5 to about 1.2. The reaction is conducted at a temperature from about 25O0C to about 45O0C, preferably about 3000C to about 4000C Reaction pressures can vary from about 7-7000 kPa {1-1000 psi). preferably about 70-3000 kPa (10-500 psi}. A methanol and/or dimethylether space time of about 0.01-80 hours, preferably 0.10-1.5 hours, is typically used. This space time is calculated as the mass of catalyst divided by the mass flow rate of methanoi/dimethylether introduced into the reactor.<br><br>
SSZ-75 may be used for the catalytic reduction of the oxides of nitrogen in a gas stream Typically, the gas stream also contains oxygen, often a stoichiometric excess thereof. Also, the molecular sieve may contain a metal or metal ions within or on it which are capable of catalyzing the reduction of the nitrogen oxides. Examples of such metals or metai ions include cobalt. copper, platinum, iron, chromium, manganese, nickel, zinc, lanthanum, palladium, rhodium and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
One example of such a process for the catalytic reduction of oxides of nitrogen in the presence of a zeolite is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,297,328, issued October 27, 1981 to Ritscher et al., whsch is incorporated by reference <br><br>
herein, There, the catalytic process is the combustion of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons and the catalytic reduction of the oxides of nitrogen contained in a gas stream, such as the exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine. The zeolite used is metal ion-exchanged, doped or loaded sufficiently so as to provide an effective amount of catalytic copper metal or copper ions within or on the zeolite, in addition, the process is conducted in an excess of oxidant, e.g , oxygen.<br><br>
Gaseous waste products resulting from the combustion of hydrocarbopaceous fuels, such as gasoline and fuel oils, comprise carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides as products of combustion or incomplete combustion, and pose a serious health problem with respect to pollution of the atmosphere. While exhaust gases from other carbonaceous fuel-burning sources, such as stationary engines, industrial furnaces, etc., contribute substantially to air pollution, the exhaust gases from automotive engines are a principal source of pollution. Because of these health problem concerns, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has promulgated strict controls on the amounts of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides which automobiles can emit. The implementation of these controls has resulted in the use of catalytic converters to reduce the amount of pollutants emitted from automobiles.<br><br>
in order to achieve the simultaneous conversion of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide pollutants, st has become the practice to employ catalysts in conjunction with air-io-fuel ratio control means which functions in response to a feedback signal from an oxygen sensor in the engine exhaust system. Although these three component control catalysts work quite welt after they have reached operating temperature of about 300° C, at lower temperatures they are not abie to convert substantial amounts of the pollutants. What this means is that when an engine and in particular an automobile engine is started up, the three component control catalyst is not able to convert the hydrocarbons and other pollutants to innocuous compounds. <br><br>
Adsorbent beds have been used to adsorb the hydrocarbons during the cold start portion of the engine. Although the process typically will be used with hydrocarbon fuels, the instant invention can also be used to treat exhaust streams from alcohol fueled engines. The adsorbent bed is typically placed immediately before the catalyst. Thus, the exhaust stream is first flowed through the adsorbent bed and then through the catalyst. The adsorbent bed preferentially adsorbs hydrocarbons over water under the conditions present in the exhaust stream. After a certain amount of time, the adsorbent bed has reached a temperature (typically about 150° C.) at which the bed ss no longer able to remove hydrocarbons from the exhaust stream. That is, hydrocarbons are actually desorfaed from the adsorbent bed instead of being adsorbed. This regenerates the adsorbent bed so that it can adsorb hydrocarbons during a subsequent cold start.<br><br>
The prior art reveals several references dealing with the use of adsorbent beds to minimize hydrocarbon emissions during a cold start engine operation, One such reference is U. S Pat No. 3,699,683 in which an adsorbent bed ss placed after both a reducing catalyst, and an oxidizing catalyst. The patentees disclose that when the exhaust gas stream is below 200" C. the gas stream is flowed through the reducing catalyst then through the oxidizing catalyst and finally through the adsorbent bed, thereby adsorbing hydrocarbons on the adsorbent bed When the temperature goes above 200° C. the gas stream which is discharged from the oxidation cataiyst is divided into a major and minor portion, the major portion being discharged directly into the atmosphere and the minor portion passing through the adsorbent bed whereby ?pburned hydrocarbon is desorbed and then flowing the resulting minor portion of this exhaust stream containing the desorbed unb?rned hydrocarbons into the engine where they are burned.<br><br>
Another reference is U. S Pat No 2,942,932 which teaches a process for oxidizing carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons which are contained in exhaust gas streams. The process disclosed in this patent consists of flowing an<br><br>
Ab - <br><br>
exhaust stream which Is below 800° F, into an adsorption zone which adsorbs the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons and then passing the resultant stream from this adsorption zone mto an oxidation zone. When the temperature of the exhaust gas stream reaches about 800" F the exhaust stream is no longer passed through the adsorption zone but is passed directly to the oxidation zone with the addition of excess air.<br><br>
U. S Patent No. 5,078,979, issued January 7, 1992 to Dunne, which is incorporated herein by reference m its entirely, discloses treating an exhaust gas stream from an engine to prevent cold start emissions using a molecular sieve adsorbent bed. Examples of the molecular sieve include fa?jasites. eiinoptilo?tes, mordepites. chabazite, silicalite, zeolite Y, ultrastable zeolite Y. and ZSM-5.<br><br>
Canadian Patent No. 1 ,205.980 discloses a method of reducing exhaust emissions from an alcohoi fueled automotive vehicle This method consists of directing the coo! engine startup exhaust gas through a bed of zeolite particles and then over an oxidation catalyst and then the gas is discharged to the atmosphere. As the exhaust gas stream warms up it is continuously passed over the adsorption bed and then over the oxidation bed.<br><br>
As stated this invention generally relates to a process for treating an engine exhaust stream and in particular to a process for minimizing emissions during the cold start operation of an engine. The engine consists of any internal or external combustion engine which generates an exhaust gas stream containing noxious components or pollutants including upburned or thermally degraded hydrocarbons or similar organics. Other noxious components usually present in the exhaust gas include nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide. The engine may be fueled by a hydrocarbopaceo?s fue! As used in this specification and in the appended claims, the term "hydrocarbonaceo?s fuel" includes hydrocarbons, alcohols and mixtures thereof. Examples of hydrocarbons which can be used to fuel the engine are the mixtures of hydrocarbons which make up gasoline or diesei fuel. The aicohois which may <br><br>
be used to fuel engines include efoanol and methanol. Mixtures of alcohols and mixtures of alcohols and hydrocarbons can also be used. The engine may be a jet engine, gas turbine, internal combustion engine, such as an automobile, truck or bus engine, a dieses engine or the like. The process of this invention is particularly suited for hydrocarbon, alcohol, or hydrocarbon- alcohol mixture, internal combustion engine mounted in an automobile. For convenience the description will use hydrocarbon as the fuel to exemplify the invention. The use of hydrocarbon in the subsequent description is not to be construed as limiting the invention Io hydrocarbon fueled engines.<br><br>
When the engine is started up, it produces a relatively high concentration of hydrocarbons in the engine exhaust gas stream as well as other pollutants. Pollutants will be used herein to collectively refer to any unburned fuel components and combustion byproducts found in the exhaust stream. For example, when the fuel is a hydrocarbon fuel, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and other combustion byproducts will be found in the engine exhaust gas stream. The temperature of this engine exhaust stream is relatively cooi, generally below 500s C. and typically in the range of 200° to 400" C. This engine exhaust stream has the above characteristics dunng the initial period of engine operation, typically for the first 30 to 120 seconds after startup of a cold engine. The engine exhaust stream will typically contain, by volume, about 500 to 1000 ppm hydrocarbons.<br><br>
The engine exhaust gas stream which is to be treated is flowed over a molecular sieve bed comprising molecular sieve SSZ-56 a first exhaust stream. Molecular sieve SSZ-56 is described below. The first exhaust stream which is discharged from the molecular sieve bed is now flowed over a catalyst to convert the pollutants contained in the first exhaust stream to innocuous components and provide a treated exhaust stream which is discharged into the atmosphere, St is understood that prior to discharge into the atmosphere, the treated exhaust stream may be flowed through a muffler or other sound reduction apparatus well known in the art. <br><br>
The catalyst which is used to convert the pollutants to innocuous components is usually referred to in the art as a three-component control catalyst because it can simultaneously oxidize any residual hydrocarbons present in the first exhaust stream to carbon dioxide and water, oxidize any residual carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide and reduce any residual nitric oxide to nitrogen and oxygen, In some cases the catalyst may not be required to convert nitric oxide to nitrogen and oxygen, e.g., when an alcohol is used as the fuel in this case the catalyst is called an oxidation catalyst. Because of the relatively low temperature of the engine exhaust stream and the first, exhaust stream, this catalyst does not function at a very high efficiency, thereby necessitating the molecular sieve bed.<br><br>
When the molecular sieve bed reaches a sufficient temperature, typically about 150-200° C, the poilutants which are adsorbed in the bed begin to desorb and are carried by the first exhaust stream over the catalyst. At this point the catalyst has reached its operating temperature and is therefore capable of fully converting the pollutants to innocuous components.<br><br>
The adsorbent bed used in the instant invention can be conveniently employed in particulate form or the adsorbent can be deposited onto a solid monolithic carrier. When particulate form is desired, the adsorbent can be formed into shapes such as pills, pellets, granules, rings, spheres, etc. in the employment of a monolithic form, it is usually most convenient to employ the adsorbent as a thin film or coating deposited on an inert carrier material which provides the structural support for the adsorbent. The inert carrier materia! can be any refractory materia! such as ceramic or metallic materials, it is desirable that the carrier material be unreactive with the adsorbent and not be degraded by the gas to which it is exposed. Examples of suitable ceramic materials include siiiimanite, petalite, cordierite, muilite, zircon, zircon muilite, spond?mene, alumina-titanate, etc. Additionally, metallic matepais which sre within the scope of this invention include metals and alloys as disclosed in<br><br>
-4Q- <br><br>
U. S Pat No. 3,920,583 which are oxidation resistant and are otherwise capable of withstanding high temperatures.<br><br>
The carrier material can best be utilized in any rigid unitary configuration which provides a plurality of pores or channels extending in the direction of gas flow. St is preferred that the configuration be a honeycomb configuration. The honeycomb structure can be used advantageously in either unitary form, or as an arrangement of multiple modules. The honeycomb structure is usually oriented such that gas flow is generally in the same direction as the cells or channels of the honeycomb structure. For a more detailed discussion of monolithic structures, refer to U.S. Pat Nos. 3,785,998 and 3,767,453.<br><br>
The molecular sieve is deposited onto the carrier by any convenient way well known in the art. A preferred method involves preparing a slurry using the molecular sieve and coating the monolithic honeycomb earner with the slurry. The slurry can be prepared by means known in the art such as combining the appropriate amount of the molecular sieve and a binder with water. This mixture is then blended by using means such as Bonification, milling, etc. This slurry is used to coat a monolithic honeycomb by dipping the honeycomb into the slurry, removing the excess slurry by draining or blowing out the channels, and heating to about 100° C. If the desired loading of molecular sieve is not achieved, the above process may be repeated as many tsmes as required to achieve the desired loading.<br><br>
instead of depositing the molecular sieve onto a monolithic honeycomb structure, one can take the molecular sieve and form it into a monolithic honeycomb structure by means known m the art,<br><br>
The adsorbent may optionally contain one or more catalytic metals dispersed thereon. The metals which can be dispersed on the adsorbent are the noble metals which consist of platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, and mixtures thereof. The desired noble metal may be deposited onto the adsorbent, which acts as a support, in any suitable manner well known in the <br><br>
art- One example of a method of dispersing the noble metal onto the adsorbent support involves impregnating the adsorbent support with an aqueous solution of a decomposable compound of the desired noble metal or metals, drying the adsorbent which has the nobie metal compound dispersed on it and then calcining in air at a temperature of about 400° to about 500" C. for a time of about 1 to about 4 hours. By decomposable compound is meant a compound which upon heating in air gives the metal or metal oxide. Examples of the decomposable compounds which can be used are set forth in U. S, Pat. No. 4,791 ,091 which is incorporated by reference. Preferred decomposable compounds are chSoropSatinic acid, rhodium trichloride. chioropalladic acid, hexachioroiridafe (IV) acid and hexachloror?thenate. St is preferable that the noble metal be present in an amount ranging from about 0.01 to about 4 weight percent of the adsorbent support. Specifically, in the case of platinum and palladium the range is 0.1 to 4 weight percent, while in the case of rhodium and ruthenium the rang© is from about Q.01 to 2 weight percent,<br><br>
These catalytic metals are capable of oxidizing the hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide and reducing the nitric oxide components to innocuous products. Accordingly, the adsorbent bed can act both as an adsorbent and as a catalyst<br><br>
The catalyst which is used in this invention is selected from any three component control or oxidation catalyst well known In the art. Examples oi catalysts are those described in U.S Pat Nos. 4,528,279, 4,791 ,091; 4,760,044; 4.868,148; and 4,868,149, which are ail incorporated by reference. Preferred catalysts well known in the art are those that contain platinum and rhodium and optionally palladium, while oxidation catalysts usually do not contain rhodium. Oxidation catalysts usually contain piatsnum and/or palladium metal These catalysts may also contasn promoters and stabilizers such as barium, cerium, lanthanum, nickel, and iron. The noble metals promoters and stabilizers are usually deposited on a support such as alumina, silica, titania, zirconia, alumino silicates, and mixtures thereof with alumina <br><br>
being preferred. The catalyst can be conveniently employed, in particulate form or the catalytic composite can be deposited on a solid monolithic earner with a monolithic carrier being preferred. The particulate form and monolithic form of the catalyst are prepared as described for the adsorbent above.<br><br>
The molecular sieve used in the adsorbent bed, SSZ-75, comprises a crystalline molecular sieve having ST! topology and having a mole ratio of at least 15 of (1 ) an oxide of a first tetravaient element to (2) an oxide of a trivaient element, pentavalent element, second tetravaient element which ss different from said first tetravaient element or mixture thereof,<br><br>
The present invention comprises a process for catalytic conversion of a feedstock comprising one or more oxygenates comprising alcohois and ethers to a hydrocarbon product containing light olefins, i.e., Ca, Ca and/or C4 olefins. The feedstock is contacted with the molecular sieve of the present invention at effective process conditions to produce light olefins.<br><br>
The term "oxygenate" as used herein designates compounds such as alcohols, ethers and mixtures thereof. Examples of oxygenates include, but are not limited to, methanol and dimethyl ether.<br><br>
The process of the present invention may be conducted in the presence of one or more diluents which may be present in the oxygenate feed in an amount between about 1 and about 99 molar percent, based on the total number of moles of ail feed and diluent components. Diluents include, but are not limited to, helium, argon, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, water, paraffins, hydrocarbons (such as methane and the like), aromatic compounds, or mixtures thereof. U. S. Patents No. 4,861,938 and 4,677,242, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety, emphasize the use of a diluent to maintain catalyst selectivity toward the production of light olefins, particularly ethylene.<br><br>
-S2- <br><br>
The oxygenate conversion is preferably conducted in the vapor phase such that the oxygenate feedstock is contacted in a vapor phase in a reaction zone with the molecular sieve of this invention at effective process conditions to produce hydrocarbons, i.e., an effective temperature, pressure, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) and, optionally, an effective amount of diluent. The process is conducted for a period of time sufficient to produce the desired light olefins. In genera!, the residence time employed to produce the desired product can vary from seconds to a number of hours. It will be readily appreciated that the residence time will be determined to a significant extent by the reaction temperature , the molecular sieve catalyst, the WHSV, the phase (liquid or vapor) and process design characteristics. The oxygenate feedstock flow rate affects olefin production. Increasing the feedstock flow rate increases WHSV and enhances the formation of olefin production relative to paraffin production. However, the enhanced olefin production relative to paraffin production is offset by a diminished conversion of oxygenate to hydrocarbons.<br><br>
The oxygenate conversion process is effectively carried out over a wide range of pressures, including autogenous pressures. At pressures between about 0,01 atmospheres (0.1 kPa) and about 1000 atmospheres (101.3 kPa), the formation of light olefins will be affected although the optimum amount of product will not necessarily be formed at ail pressures The preferred pressure is between about 0.01 atmospheres (0.1 kPa} and about 100 atmospheres (10.13 kPa}. More preferably, the pressure will range from about 1 to about 10 atmospheres (101.3 kPa to 1.013 Mpa). The pressures referred to herein are exclusive of the diluent, if any, that is present and refer to the partial pressure of the feedstock as it rebates to oxygenate compounds.<br><br>
The temperature which may be employed in the oxygenate conversion process may vary over a wide range depending, at least in part, on the molecular sieve catalyst in general, the process can be conducted at an effective temperature between about 2000C and about 70O0C At the lower end of the temperature range, and thus generally at a lower rate of reaction, <br><br>
the formation of the desired light olefins may become low. At the upper end of the range , the process may not form an optimum amount of Sight olefins and catalyst deactivation may be rapid.<br><br>
The molecular sieve catalyst preferably is incorporated into solid particles in which the catalyst is present in an amount effective to promote the desired conversion of oxygenates to light olefins. In one aspect, the solid particles comprise a catalyticaily effective amount of the catalyst and at least one matrix materia! selected from the group consisting of binder materials, fsJlef materials and mixtures thereof to provide a desired property or properties, e.g., desired catalyst dilution, mechanical strength and the like to the solid particles. Such matrix materials are often, to some extent, porous in nature and may or may not be effective to promote the desired reaction. Filler and binder materials include, for example, synthetic and naturally occurring substances such as metal oxides, clays, silicas, aluminas, sslica-aiurninas, silica-magnesias, sslica-zirconias, silica-thopas and the like. Sf matrix materials are included in the catalyst composition, the molecular sieve preferably comprises about 1 to 99%, more preferably about 5 to 90%, and still more preferably about 10 to 80% by weight of the total composition .<br><br>
