Field of the invention:<br>
The present invention relates to an improved seal means for isolation of fluids in a<br>
device by the application of compressive forces. More particularly, the invention<br>
relates to an improved compressive and flexible seal means capable of adequately<br>
sealing the components of a planner SOFC device.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Devices such as solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have huge potential for use in<br>
power generation with much higher efficiency than the conventional devices.<br>
SOFC can work at a high efficiency with variety of fuels such as Hydrogen, natural<br>
gas, coal gas, LPG, bio fuels etc, and cause a minimal environment impact (air<br>
and noise). However the commercial acceptability and wide use of such efficient<br>
device is delimited due to non availability of cheaper and reliable seals which can<br>
withstand repeated thermal cycles typically encountered during its operations. In<br>
addition, performance of the available seals is plagued by very high operational<br>
leak rates in severe (oxidizing, reducing, and humid) environments.<br>
Sealing of planner SOFCs to separate the air and fuel particularly in power plants,<br>
represents a significant technical challenge. In planar SOFCs, a plurality of seals<br>
attach the cell to an interconnect and/or metal frames, including sealing of all<br>
possible leakage points. Such Seals are expected to function properly in harsh<br>
environments at elevated temperatures. The SOFC stacks experience multiple<br>
thermal cycles (perhaps thousands of cycles for some applications) during their<br>
lifetime service in stationary or applications. As a result, thermal cycle stability is<br>
considered a top priority for SOFC sealant development.<br><br>
-3-<br>
Both rigid and compressive seals are developed in the art for SOFCs. The most<br>
common approach is to use rigid glass or glass-ceramic seals, the properties of<br>
which can be tailored specifically for use in SOFCs through variation of the glass<br>
composition. However, these rigid seals are inherently brittle, and they<br>
permanently seal the parts preventing re-use of once dissembled parts and have<br>
more stringent requirements to comply with, for example, cracking and thermal<br>
expansion matching.<br>
On the other hand, the compressive seals are not rigidly fixed to the other SOFC<br>
components, so that an exact match of thermal expansion is not required. The<br>
individual cells are allowed to expand and contract freely while heating/cooling<br>
during thermal cycling and routine operation. The compressive allows a wide range<br>
of interconnect materials to select form.<br>
Although mica-based compressed seals are known, they however exhibit an<br>
increased leak rate due to thermal damages in an environment of continued<br>
thermal cycling at high operating temperatures up to about 850Â°C. The thermal<br>
damages generally result from fragmentation, cleavage, micro-stress fractures<br>
and similar damages to the microstructure of the mica substrate matrix, and<br>
introduces leak paths or void spaces those are continuous in three dimensions.<br>
US patent application Sr. No. 10/134072 filed Apr 27, 2002 demonstrated that by<br>
adding additional compliant interlayers (glass or metal) to mica based seals the<br>
leak rates can be reduced substantially. Further US patent publication No. US<br>
2004/0048137 Al dated March 11, 2004 described a seal composed of compliant<br>
interlayers (glass or metal) and a sealing (gasket) member layer composed of<br>
mica that is infiltrated with a glass forming material, which more effectively<br>
reduces leaks within the seal.<br><br>
-4-<br>
US patent No. US 7197912 Bl dated Apr 3, 2007 entitled "Gas sensor seal and<br>
method of producing same" described the use of talc powder pack, which serves<br>
as a leak resistant seal. One common example of such seal pack is the "sand<br>
seal" typically used for gas sealing of wagons of high temperature tunnel kiln<br>
used widely in ceramic industries. Since these powders are generally about<br>
thousand times bigger than the gas molecules to be sealed, the seals are not so<br>
effective, and misfit for the devices under consideration in this application.<br>
US patent No. US 7210220 B2 dated Mayl, 2007 entitled "Apparatus for and<br>
method of forming seals in fuel cells and fuel stacks" discloses a method of<br>
injection of seal materials into a groove network. However the seal material is<br>
then cured to form the seal, thus will finally act as rigid seal only.<br>
US patent No. US 7198303 B2 dated Apr3, 2007 entitled "Exhaust pipe joint and<br>
seal" described a sealing method by which powder materials are used along with<br>
wire or wire mesh to form a composite and then compressed to form a seal. Since<br>
these powders are substantially bigger than the gas molecules to be sealed, the<br>
seals are not so effective in the context of the devices such as herein described<br>
in this patent application.<br>
Objects of the invention:<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to propose an improved compressive and<br>
flexible seal means capable of adequately sealing the components of a planner<br>
SOFC device with superior thermal cycle stability.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose an improved compressive and flexible<br>
seal means capable of adequately sealing the components of a planner SOFC<br>
device with superior thermal cycle stability, in which nano powder materials are<br>
employed.<br><br>
-5-<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose an improved compressive and<br>
flexible seal means capable of adequately sealing the components of a planner<br>
SOFC device with superior thermal cycle stability, in which varying degree of<br>
adhesion bonding of very fine or nano powder materials coating is employed<br>
between the mating surfaces.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to propose an improved compressive and<br>
flexible seal means capable of adequately sealing the components of a planner<br>
SOFC device with superior thermal cycle stability, in which the scratch lines, pores,<br>
fractures, cleavages, interstices, leak path, voids, on the matting surfaces of the<br>
components are filled with the coated materials.<br>
A further object of the invention is to propose propose an improved compressive<br>
and flexible seal means capable of adequately sealing the components of a planner<br>
SOFC device with superior thermal cycle stability in which means are provided to<br>
allow absorption of stresses generated during the use of the device.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to propose propose an improved<br>
compressive and flexible seal means capable of adequately sealing the<br>
components of a planner SOFC device with superior thermal cycle stability, in<br>
which the nano particles under compressive force of the device get compacted to<br>
produce an adequate sealing to the device.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, there is provided an improved compressive and flexible seal means<br>
adaptable in particular to planner solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) devices, the SOFC<br>
device comprises a top sealing component , and a bottom sealing component<br>
which are intended to be joined so as to isolate the gas present in a first and<br>
second compartments of the device, the seal means comprising at least one first<br>
sealing gasket member disposed in contact with the first compartment, at least<br>
one second sealing gasket member placed in<br><br>
-6-<br>
contact with the second compartment, and a powder pack composed of nano<br>
particles interposed between the at least one first and second sealing gasket<br>
members .<br>
The device may use multiple gases or liquids at varioujs parts, which are required<br>
to be isolated by incorporating adequate sealing between various functional sub-<br>
parts of the device. One of the non-limiting examples of such devices is the solid<br>
oxide fuel cell (SOFC) built for its use in stacks and systems for generating electric<br>
power from controlled supply of fuel gas and air. For SOFC and may other devices<br>
such as synagas generators, membrane reactors, etc., different gaseous streams<br>
internal to the device at the elevated temperatures must be kept separate from<br>
each other.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the seal means may comprise compressive seal<br>
member gaskets such as mica and continuous bulk of nano powder materials<br>
enclosing at least one or more sides of the compressive member gasket. The<br>
internal mating parts of the device at least some of them, are coated with a layer<br>
of very fine or nano materials and subjected to processing conditions such that the<br>
scratch lines, pores, fractures, cleavages, interstices, leak path, voids, on the<br>
mating surfaces of the components are filled with the coated materials. At least<br>
some part of the bulk powder comprising of very fine or nano particles deposited<br>
arc loosely bonded to make use of the flexible and movable nature of the powder<br>
assembly for filling the voids including absorption of the stress generated during<br>
the use of the device. This enhances the healing of voids, crack, flows whenever<br>
created either in the bulk or on the other member of the seal assembly. The bulk<br>
of the powder pack comprising of nano particle exists between the compressive<br>
seal member gaskets and the sealing parts, which under compressive force of the<br>
device gets compacted to deliver adequate sealing to the device.<br><br>
