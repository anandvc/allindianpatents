DESCRIPTION<br>
PICTURE CODING APPARATUS, PICTURE DECODING APPARATUS<br>
AND THE METHODS<br>
5     Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a coding apparatus and a<br>
decoding   apparatus  for  coding   and   decoding   moving   pictures,<br>
especially to a picture coding apparatus and a picture decoding<br>
apparatus   for   performing   motion   estimation   using   weighting<br>
10     factors and the methods thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
Recently, with an arrival of the age of multimedia which handles integrally audio, picture, other contents or the like, it is<br>
15 now possible to obtain or transmit the information conveyed by existing information media, i.e., newspapers, journals, TVs, radios and telephones and other means using a single terminal. Generally speaking, multimedia refers to something that is represented in association not only with characters but also with<br>
20 graphics, audio and especially pictures and the like together. However, in order to include the aforementioned existing information media in the scope of multimedia, it appears as a prerequisite to represent such information in digital form.<br>
However,   when   estimating   the   amount   of   information<br>
25 contained in each of the aforementioned information media as the amount of digital information, the information amount per character requires l'^2 bytes whereas the audio requires more than 64 Kbits (telephone quality) per second and when it comes to the   moving   picture,   it   requires   more   than   100Mbits   (present<br>
30 television reception quality) per second. Therefore, it is not realistic to handle the vast information directly in digital form via the   information   media    mentioned    above.       For   example,   a<br><br>
videophone has already been put into practical use via Integrated<br>
Services Digital Network (ISDN) with a transmission rate of 64<br>
Kbps ~ 1.5 Mbps, however, it is not practical to transmit the<br>
moving picture captured on the TV screen or shot by a TV camera.<br>
5	This therefore requires information compression techniques,<br>
and for instance, moving picture compression techniques compliant with H.261 and H.263 standards internationally standardized by ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union-Telecommunication Standardization Sector) are used in the<br>
10 case of the videophone. According to information compression techniques compliant with the MPEG-1 standard, picture information as well as music information can be stored in an ordinary music CD (Compact Disc).<br>
The MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group) is an international<br>
15 standard for compression of moving picture signals and MPEG-1 is a standard that compresses moving picture signals down to 1.5 Mbps, that is, to compress information of TV signals approximately down to a hundredth. The transmission rate within the scope of the   MPEG-1   standard   is  limited   primarily  to   about   1.5   Mbps,<br>
20 therefore, MPEG-2, which was standardized with the view to meet the requirements of high-quality pictures, allows a data transmission of moving picture signals at a rate of 2'-'15 Mbps. In the present circumstances, a working group (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11)   in  the  charge  of the  standardization   of the<br>
25 MPEG-1 and the MPEG-2 has standardized MPEG-4 that achieves a compression rate which goes beyond the one achieved by the MPEG-1 and the MPEG-2, realizes coding/decoding operations on a per-object basis as well as a new function required by the age of multimedia (see reference, for instance, to the specifications of the<br>
30 MPEG-1, MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 produced by the ISO). The MPEG-4 not only realizes a highly efficient coding method for a low bit rate but also introduces powerful error resistance techniques that can<br><br>
minimize a degrading of a screen quality even when an error is<br>
found  in a transmission  line.    Also, the ISO/IEC and  ITU  work<br>
together on a standardization of MPEG-4 AVC/ITU H. 264 as a next<br>
generation picture coding method.<br>
5	Coding    of    moving    pictures,    in    general,    compresses<br>
information volume by reducing redundancy in both temporal and spatial directions. Therefore, inter-picture prediction coding, which aims at reducing the temporal redundancy, estimates a motion  and  generates a  predictive  picture on  a  block-by-block<br>
10 basis with reference to previous and subsequent pictures vis-a-vis a current picture to be coded, and then codes a differential value between the obtained predictive picture and the current picture. Here, the term "picture" represents a single screen whereas it represents a frame when used in a context of progressive picture<br>
15 as well as a frame or a field in a context of an interlaced picture. The interlaced picture here is a picture in which a single frame consists of two fields having different time. In the process of coding and decoding the interlaced picture, three ways are possible: handling a single frame either as a frame, as two fields or<br>
20 as a frame structure or a field structure depending on a block in the frame.<br>
Fig. 1 is a diagram showing an example of types of pictures and how the pictures refer to each other. The hatched pictures in Fig. 1 are pictures to be stored in a memory since they are referred<br>
25 to by other pictures. As for the arrows used in Fig. 1, the head of the arrow points at a reference picture departing from a picture that refers to the reference picture. Here, the pictures are in display order.<br>
10 (Picture 0) is an intra-coded picture (I-picture) which is<br>
30 coded independently from other pictures (namely without referring to other pictures). P4 (Picture 4) and P7 (Picture 7) are forward prediction coded pictures (P-picture) that are predictively coded<br>
-3-<br><br>
with reference to I-pictures located temporally previous to the current picture or other P-pictures. B1-B3 (Pictures I-' 3), B5 (Picture 5) and B6 (Picture 6) are bi-directional prediction coded pictures (B-picture) that are predictively coded with reference to 5 other pictures both temporally previous and subsequent to the current picture.<br>
Fig. 2 is a diagram showing another example of the types of pictures and how the pictures refer to each other. The difference between Fig. 2 and Fig. 1 is that a temporal position of the pictures<br>
10 referred to by a B-picture is not limited to the pictures that are located temporally previous and subsequent to the B-picture. For example, the B5 can refer to two arbitrary pictures out of 10 (Picture 0), P3 (Picture 3) and P6 (Picture 6). Namely, the 10 and the P3, located temporally previously can be used as reference<br>
15 pictures. Such a reference method is already acknowledged in the specification of the MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 as of September 2001. Thus, a range for selecting an optimal predictive picture is widened and thereby the compression rate can be improved.<br>
Fig. 3 is a diagram showing an example of a stream structure<br>
20 of picture data. As shown in Fig. 3, the stream includes a common information area such as a header or the like and a GOP (Group Of Picture) area. The GOP area includes a common information area such as a header or the like and a plurality of picture areas. The picture area includes a common information area such as a header<br>
25 or the like and a plurality of slice data areas. The slice data area includes a common information area such as a header and a plurality of macroblock data areas.<br>
In the picture common Information area, the weighting factor   necessary   for   performing   weighted    prediction    to    be<br>
30 mentioned later are described respectively according to the reference picture.<br>
When   transmitting    data    not   in   a    bit   stream    having<br><br>
successive streams but in a packet that is a unit consisting of pieces of data, the header part and the data part which excludes the header part can be transmitted separately. In this case, the header part and the data part can not be included in a single bit 5 stream. In the case of using a packet, however, even when the header part and the data part are not transmitted in sequence, the data part and the header part are transmitted respectively in a different packet. Although they are not transmitted in a bit stream, the concept is the same as in the case of using a bit stream 10     as described in Fig. 3.<br>
The   following   describes   weighted   prediction   processing carried out by the conventional picture coding method.<br>
Figs.  4A and 4B are  pattern  diagrams  showing cases of<br>
performing weighted prediction on a frame-by-frame basis.<br>
15	When referring to a single frame, as shown in Fig. 4A, a pixel<br>
value Q in a predictive picture with respect to a current block to be<br>
coded can be calculated using an equation for weighted prediction<br>
as shown  in equation  (1)  below, where a  pixel  value within a<br>
reference block in the i th number of reference frame, Frame i, is<br>
20     represented as PO.    When referring to two frames, as shown in Fig.<br>
4B, the pixel value Q in the predictive picture can be calculated<br>
using an equation for weighted prediction as shown in equation (2)<br>
below, where respective pixel values within the reference blocks in<br>
the i th and j th numbers of reference frames. Frame i and Frame j,<br>
25     are represented as PO and PI.<br>
Q= (P0xW0 + D)/W2	(1)<br>
Q= (P0xW0 + PlxWl + D)/W2	(2)<br>
Here, WO and Wl represent weighting factors whereas W2 represents   a   normalization   factor  and   D   represents   a   biased 30     component (DC component).<br>
Figs.   5A  and   5B  are  pattern  diagrams  showing  cases  of performing   weighted   prediction   processing   on   a   field-by-fleld<br><br>
basis.<br>
When referring to a single frame (namely, two fields) as<br>
shown in Fig. 5A, pixel values Qa and Qb in the predictive pictures<br>
with respect to a current block can be calculated using equations<br>
5     for weighted prediction as shown in equations (3) and (4) below,<br>
where pixel values within respective reference blocks in respective<br>
fields of 2xi + l and 2xi, composing the i th number of frame (Frame<br>
i) which is for reference, are represented as POa and POb.    When<br>
referring to two frames, as shown in Fig. 5B, the pixel values Qa<br>
10     and   Qb   can   be   calculated   by   using   equations   for   weighted<br>
prediction as shown in equations (5) and (6) below, where pixel<br>
values within the respective reference blocks in field 2xi + l, 2xi,<br>
2xj + land 2xj, composing the i th and j th number of frames (Frame<br>
i and Frame j) are represented respectively as POa, POb, Pla and<br>
15     Plb.<br>
Qa= (P0axW0a + Da)/W2a	(3)<br>
Qb= (P0bxW0b+Db)/W2b	(4)<br>
Qa= (P0axW0a + PlaxWla + Da)/W2a	(5)<br>
Qb= (P0bxW0b+PlbxWlb+Db)/W2b	(6)<br>
20	Here, WOa, WOb, Wla and Wlb represent weighting factors<br>
whereas W2  represents a  normalization factor and  Da  and  Db represent biased components.<br>
Fig. 6 is a block diagram showing a functional structure of a conventional picture coding apparatus 100. The picture coding 25 apparatus 100 performs compression coding (for example, variable length coding) for an inputted image signal Vin and outputs a coded image signal Str that is a bit stream converted by the compression coding, and includes a motion estimation unit ME, a motion compensation unit MC, a substraction unit Sub, an 30 orthogonal transformation unit T, a quantization unit Q, an inverse quantization unit IQ, an inverse orthogonal transformation unit IT, an addition unit Add, a picture memory PicMem, a switch SW and a<br><br>
variable length coding unit VLC.<br>
The image signal Vin is inputted to the substractlon unit Sub and the motion estimation unit ME. The substraction unit Sub calculates a differential value between the inputted image signal 5 Vin and the predictive image and outputs the result to the orthogonal transformation unit T. The orthogonal transformation unit T transforms the differential value to a frequent coefficient and then outputs it to the quantization unit Q. The quantization unit Q quantizes   the   inputted   frequency   coefficient   and   outputs   a<br>
10     quantized value to the variable length coding unit VLC.<br>
The inverse quantization unit IQ reconstructs the quantized value as a frequency coefficient by inverse-quantizing it and outputs it to the inverse orthogonal transformation unit IT. The inverse   orthogonal   transformation    unit   IT   performs   inverse<br>
15 frequency conversion to the frequency coefficient in order to obtain a pixel differential value and outputs it to the addition unit Add. The addition unit Add adds the pixel differential value to the predictive image outputted from the motion compensation unit MC and obtains a decoded image.    The switch SW is ON when it is<br>
20 instructed to store the decoded image, and the decoded image is stored in the picture memory PIcMem.<br>
The motion estimation unit ME, to which the image signal Vin is inputted on a macroblock-by-macroblock basis, targets the decoded pictures stored in the picture memory PrcMem for search,<br>
25 and by estimating an image area according to the image signal that is the closest to the inputted image signal, determines a motion vector MV that indicates the area. The estimation of the motion vector is operated using a block that is a unit made by further dividing a macroblock.    Since multiple pictures can be used as<br>
30 reference pictures, identification numbers (picture number index) for identifying the pictures used for reference are required for each block.    It is thus possible to identify the reference pictures by<br><br>
corresponding the picture numbers assigned to each of the pictures In the picture memory PIcMem to the reference pictures with the use of the picture number Index.<br>
The motion compensation unit MC takes out an image area 5 necessary for generating a predictive image from a decoded picture stored in the picture memory PIcMem using the picture number Index. The motion compensation unit MC then determines a final predictive Image obtained by performing, to the pixel values In the obtained image area, pixel value conversion<br>
10 processing such as interpolating processing operated In the weighted prediction using the weighting factors associated with the picture number Index.<br>
Fig. 7 Is a block diagram showing a sketch of a functional structure of the variable length coding unit VLC in the conventional<br>
15 picture coding apparatus 100 shown In Fig. 6. The variable length coding unit VLC Includes an MV coding unit 101, a quantized value coding unit 102, a weighting factor coding unit 103, an Index coding unit 104, an AFF (Adaptive Field Frame) identifying information coding unit 105 and a multiplexing unit 106.<br>
20	The MV coding unit 101 codes a motion vector whereas the<br>
quantized value coding unit 102 codes a quantized value Qcoef. The weighting factor coding unit 103 codes a weighting factor Weight whereas the index coding unit 104 codes a picture number Index.    The AFF Identifying information coding unit 105 codes an<br>
25 AFF identification signal AFF (the AFF identification signal AFF will be mentioned later on). The multiplexing unit 106 multiplexes each of the coded signals outputted from the MV coding unit 101, the quantized value coding unit 102, the weighting factor coding unit   103,   the   index  coding   unit   104  and   the  AFF   identifying<br>
30 Information coding unit 105 and then outputs a coded image signal Str.<br>
Fig. 8 is a block diagram showing a functional structure of a<br><br>
conventional picture decoding apparatus 200.<br>
The picture decoding apparatus 200 for decoding the coded image signal Str coded by the picture coding apparatus 100 described above includes a variable length decoding unit VLD, a 5 motion compensation unit MC, an addition unit Add, a picture memory PicMem, an inverse quantization unit IQ and an inverse orthogonal transformation unit IT.<br>
When the coded image signal Str is inputted, the variable length decoding unit VLD demultiplexes the inputted coded image<br>
10 signal Str into a motion differential vector MV that is coded, an index indicating a picture number and a weighting factor Weight and outputs them to the motion compensation unit MC. The variable length decoding unit VLD then decodes the coded quantized value Qcoef included in the inputted coded image signal<br>
15     Str and outputs it to the inverse quantization unit IQ.<br>
The motion compensation unit MC takes out an image area necessary for generating a predictive image from a decoded picture stored in the picture memory PicMem using the motion vector and the picture number Index which are outputted from the<br>
20 variable length decoding unit VLD. The motion compensation unit MC then generates a predictive image by performing pixel value conversion processing such as interpolating processing in the weighted prediction using the weighting factor Weight for the obtained image.<br>
25	The   inverse   quantization   unit   IQ   inverse-quantizes   the<br>
quantized value and reconstructs it as a frequency coefficient and outputs it to the inverse orthogonal transformation unit IT. The inverse orthogonal transformation unit IT performs inverse frequency conversion to the frequency coefficient in order to obtain<br>
30 a pixel differential value and outputs it to the addition unit Add. The addition unit Add adds the pixel differential value to the predictive image outputted from the motion compensation unit MC<br><br>
and obtains a decoded image.    The decoded picture is stored in the<br>
picture    memory    PicMem   to    be    used    for   reference    in   the<br>
inter-picture prediction.    The decoded picture is outputted as a<br>
decoded picture signal Vout.<br>
5	Fig. 9 is a block diagram showing a sketch of a functional<br>
structure of a variable length decoding unit VLD in the conventional picture decoding apparatus 200 shown in Fig. 8.<br>
The    variable    length    decoding    unit    VLD    includes    a demultiplexing unit 201, an MV decoding unit 202, a quantized<br>
10 value decoding unit 203, a weighting factor decoding unit 204, an index decoding unit 205 and an AFF identification signal decoding unit 206.<br>
When the coded image signal Str is inputted to the variable length    decoding     unit    VLD,    the    demultiplexing     unit    201<br>
15 demultiplexes the inputted coded image signal Str and outputs respectively as follows: the coded motion differential vector MV to the MV decoding unit 202; the coded quantized value Qcoef to the quantized value decoding unit 203; the coded weighting factor Weight to  the  weighting  factor decoding   unit  204;   the  coded<br>
20 picture number to the index decoding unit 205 and the coded AFF identification signal AFF (abbreviated as 'AFF" in the following description) to the AFF identification signal decoding unit 206.<br>
The MV decoding unit 202 decodes the coded differential vector and outputs a motion vector MV.<br>
25	Similarly, the quantized value decoding unit 203 decodes the<br>
quantized value, the weighting factor decoding unit 204 decodes the weighting factor Weight, the index decoding unit 205 decodes the picture number Index and the AFF identification signal decoding unit 206 decodes the AFF respectively and then outputs<br>
30     them.<br>
The conventional coding using weighted prediction, however, is performed on a picture-by-picture basis with an assumption that<br><br>
a block is coded/decoded for the same picture (a frame or one of the two fields). Therefore, only a set of weighting factors can be coded/decoded in the picture.<br>
Therefore, in spite that the conventional picture coding apparatus has the potential to improve efficiency in motion estimation, only a single weighting factor can be transmitted on a blocl
10<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
The present invention has been conceived in view of the aforementioned circumstances and aims to provide a picture coding/decoding    method    that   can    handle   weighting    factors<br>
15 appropriately even when switching of field/frame takes place on a block-by-block basis.<br>
In order to achieve the above object, the picture coding apparatus according to the present invention codes an interlaced picture on a block-by-block basis, and comprises: a storage unit<br>
20 operable to store a picture that is either a frame or a field decoded after being coded, as a reference picture; a predictive picture generation unit operable to read out the reference picture from the storage unit and generate a predictive picture based on pixel values in the reference picture, using one of i) a frame weighting<br>
25 factor for coding the interlaced picture on a frame-by-frame basis and ii) a field weighting factor for coding the interlaced picture on a field-by-field basis; a signal coding unit operable to code, on a block-by-block basis, a differential value between an inputted picture  and  the  predictive  picture  generated  by the  predictive<br>
30 picture generation unit, either on a frame-by-frame basis or on a field-by-field basis; a weighting factor coding unit operable to code the frame weighting factor out of the frame weighting factor and a<br><br>
field weighting factor, when the signal coding unit codes the differential value on a block-by-block basis adaptively either on the frame-by-frame basis or on the field-by-field basis; and a multiplexing unit operable to multiplex the differential value coded 5 by the signal coding unit as well as the frame weighting factor coded by the weighting factor coding unit and output the multiplexed differential value and frame weighting factor, as a coded signal.<br>
Consequently, the picture coding apparatus according to the<br>
10 present invention abbreviates a field weighting factor, codes only a frame weighting factor and transmits it to a picture decoding apparatus, regardless of whether or not the switching of frame/field is performed on a block-by-block basis when performing weighted prediction for a moving picture.    Therefore,<br>
15     the transmission efficiency can be improved.<br>
In order to achieve the above object, the picture decoding apparatus according to the present invention decodes, on a block-by-block basis, a coded signal according to a picture that is either a single frame or a single field, and comprises:  a signal<br>
20 decoding unit operable to decode the coded signal either on a frame-by-frame basis or on a field-by-field basis, when the coded signal is coded by switching adaptively between the frame-by-frame basis and the field-by-field basis; a storage unit operable to store at least one decoded picture; a predictive picture<br>
25 generation unit operable to extract, from the coded signal, a frame weighting factor for decoding the coded signal on the frame-by-frame basis, generate a field weighting factor for decoding the coded signal on the field-by-field basis, based on the frame weighting factor, and generate a predictive picture based on<br>
30 pixel values in the decoded picture stored in the storage unit, using the extracted frame weighting factor and the generated field weighting factor,  when  the coded  signal  is coded  by switching<br><br>
adaptively between the frame-by-frame basis and the field-by-field basis; and an addition unit operable to add the picture obtained in the decoding performed by the signal decoding unit to the predictive picture generated by the predictive picture generation 5 unit, output the added picture as a decoded picture, and store the decoded picture in the storage unit.<br>
Consequently, the picture decoding apparatus according to the present invention generates the field weighting factor based on the frame weighting factor even when the switching of frame/field<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The   following   describes   embodiments   according   to   the present invention in detail with reference to the diagrams. 15<br>
(First Embodiment)<br>
The functional structure of the picture coding apparatus for realizing the picture coding method according to the present embodiment is as same as that of the conventional picture coding 20 apparatus 100 mentioned above, except for the variable length coding unit VLC. Similarly, the functional structure of the picture decoding apparatus for realizing the picture decoding method according to the present embodiment is as same as that of the conventional picture decoding apparatus 200 mentioned above, 25     except for the variable length decoding unit VLD.<br>
Therefore, the following focuses mainly on the descriptions of a variable length coding unit VLC and a variable length decoding unit VLD which are different from the conventional ones.<br>
Fig. 10 is a block diagram showing a sketch of a functional<br>
30     structure   of the  variable   length   coding   unit  according   to   the<br>
present embodiment.    As shown in Fig.  10, the variable length<br>
coding unit VLC includes an MV coding unit 101, a quantized value<br><br>
coding unit 102, a field weighting factor coding unit 11, a frame weighting factor coding unit 12, an index coding unit 104, a weighting factor mode determination unit 13, an AFF identifying information coding unit 105, switches 14, 15 and a multiplexing 5 unit 106. The same referential marks are put for the same functional structures as those of the conventional variable length coding unit VLC, and the explanation is thereby abbreviated.<br>
The switches 14 and 15 control ON/OFF by determining the destination of the inputted weighting factor Weight, either to the<br>
10 field weighting factor coding unit 11 or to the frame weighting factor coding unit 12, based on the result of the determination made by the weighting factor mode determination unit 13.<br>
The field weighting factor coding unit 11 codes the inputted weighting factor Weight as a field weighting factor whereas the<br>
15 frame weighting factor coding unit 12 codes it as a frame weighting factor.<br>
The weighting factor mode determination unit 13 performs the determination of frame/field based on the value of the AFF and that of the weighting factor Weight and then informs the switches<br>
20 14, 15 and the multiplexing unit 106 of the result of the determination.<br>
Fig. 11 is a block diagram showing a sketch of a functional structure of the variable length decoding unit VLD according to the present embodiment.    As shown in Fig.  11, the variable length<br>
25 decoding unit VLD includes a demultiplexing unit 21, an MV decoding unit 202, a quantized value decoding unit 203, a field weighting factor decoding unit 22, a frame weighting factor decoding unit 23, a weighting factor generation unit 24, an index decoding unit 205, an AFF identifying information decoding unit<br>
30 206 and switches 26'^28. The same referential marks are put for the same functional structures as those of the conventional variable length decoding unit VLD, and the explanation is thereby<br><br>
abbreviated.<br>
The demultiplexing unit 21 demultiplexes the inputted coded image signal Str and outputs the demultiplexed signals respectively as follows: the coded motion vector MV to the MV 5 decoding unit 202; the coded quantized value Qcoef to the quantized value decoding unit 203; the coded weighting factor Weight to the field weighting factor decoding unit 22 or the frame weighting factor decoding unit 23, and the weighting factor generation unit 24; the coded picture number Index to the index<br>
10 decoding unit 205 and the coded AFF to the AFF identifying information decoding unit 206.<br>
The field weighting factor decoding unit 22 decodes the inputted weighting factor Weight as a field weighting factor. The frame weighting  factor decoding  unit 23  decodes the  inputted<br>
15     weighting factor Weight as a frame weighting factor.<br>
The weighting factor generation unit 24 generates a field weighting factor based on a frame weighting factor, if necessary. It is a case, for example, in which switching of frame/field on a block-by-block basis takes place and it is necessary to generate a<br>
20 field weighting factor based on a frame weighting factor since a field weighting factor is not coded.<br>
Figs. 12A, 12B and 12C are diagrams showing examples of a data structure of a picture area according to the present embodiment.    Fig 12A is a detailed example of a data structure of<br>
25 a "header" within a common information area in the picture area. In the example of Fig. 12A, the "header" includes "picture frame coding information" which indicates whether the picture is coded on a frame-by-frame basis or on a field- by-field basis. For example, when the "picture frame coding information" indicates<br>
30 "1", the "header" further includes a flag "AFF" indicating whether or not the switching between field and frame on a block-by-block basis takes place.    When the "AFF" indicates "1", for instance, this<br><br>
indicates that the switching between field and frame takes place. As shown in Fig. 12A, when the "AFF" indicates "1", both the "field weighting factor" and the "frame weighting factor" are transmitted. The "field weighting factor" includes a "first field weighting factor" 5     and a "second field weighting factor".<br>
When the "picture frame coding information" indicates "0", the picture is coded on a field-by-field basis, therefore, it is impossible to switch between field and frame on a block-by-block basis.    Consequently, as shown in Fig. 12B, the "header" does not<br>
10 include the "AFF" and only the "field weighting factor" is transmitted as a "picture weighting factor". In the case of Fig. 12C, where the "picture frame coding information" is "1" and the "AFF" indicates "0", it is impossible to switch between field and frame  on  a   block-by-block  basis.     Therefore,   only  the "frame<br>
15     weighting factor" is transmitted as a "picture weighting factor".<br>
Fig. 13 is a flowchart showing a sequence of coding processing with respect to the weighting factors operated by the variable length decoding unit VLD when the "picture frame coding information"   indicates   "1"   and   the   picture    is   coded   on   a<br>
20     frame-by-frame basis, according to the present embodiment.<br>
Firstly, when the value of the "AFF" indicates "1" and the frame/field switching is operated on a block-by-block basis (Yes in SIO), the "AFF" indicating "switching on a block-by-block basis takes place" is coded (S13), and then, the frame weighting factor<br>
25     and the field weighting factor are coded (S14, S15).<br>
When the value of the "AFF" is "0" and no switching of frame/field takes place on a block-by-block basis (No in SIO), the value "0" of the "AFF" indicating "no switching takes place on a block-by-block basis" is coded (Sll) and the "picture weighting<br>
30     factor" is coded (S12).<br><br>
(Variation)<br>
Figs. 14A, 14B and 14C are diagrams showing examples of a data structure of a picture area according to a variation of the present embodiment. Fig 14A is a detailed example of a data 5 structure of a "header" within a common information area in the picture area. In the example of Fig. 14A, the "header" includes "picture frame coding information" which indicates whether the picture is coded on a frame-by-frame basis or on a field- by-field basis.    For example, when the "picture frame coding information"<br>
10 indicates "1" (this means that the picture is coded on a frame-by-frame basis), the "header" further includes a flag "AFF" indicating whether or not the switching between field and frame on a block-by-block basis takes place. When the "AFF" indicates "1", for instance, this indicates that the switching between field and<br>
15     frame takes place on a block-by-block basis.    As shown in Fig. 14A, when  the "AFF"  indicates "1",  the "frame  weighting  factor"  is transmitted,  and   the "field  weighting  factor"  appropriates  the "frame weighting factor" to the coding processing.<br>
When the "picture frame coding information" indicates "0", it<br>
20 indicates that the picture is coded on a field-by-field basis. In this case, the switching of frame/field on a block-by-block basis does not take place. Therefore, it is impossible to switch between field and frame on a block-by-block basis. Consequently, when the "header" does not include the "AFF" as shown in Fig. 14B, it means<br>
25     that only the "field weighting factor" is transmitted as a "picture weighting factor".    In the case of Fig.   14C, where the "picture frame coding Information" Indicates "1" and the "AFF" indicates "0", the switching of frame/field on a block-by-block basis does not take place and thereby the picture is always coded on a frame-by-frame<br>
30 basis. Therefore, only the "frame weighting factor" is transmitted as a "picture weighting factor".<br>
Fig.    15   is   a   flowchart   showing   a   sequence   of   coding<br><br>
processing with respect to the weighting factors operated by the variable length coding unit VLC when the "picture frame coding information" indicates "1" and the picture is coded on a frame-by-frame basis, according to the variation of the present 5     embodiment.<br>
Firstly, when the value of the "AFF" is "1" and the switching of frame/field is operated on a block-by-block basis (Yes in SIO), the "AFF" indicating "switching on a block-by-block basis takes place" is coded  (S13) and the frame weighting factor is coded<br>
10     (S15).<br>
When the value of the "AFF" is "0" and no switching of frame/field takes place on a block-by-block basis (No in SIO), the value "0" of the "AFF" indicating "no switching takes place on a block-by-btock basis" is coded (Sll) and either the "field weighting<br>
15 factor" or the "frame weighting factor" corresponding to a unit of coding a block is coded as a "picture weighting factor" (S12) based on the picture frame coding information.<br>
Fig. 16 is a flowchart showing a sequence of decoding processing with respect to the weighting factors when the "picture<br>
20 frame coding information" indicates "1" and the picture processed by the variable length decoding unit VLD shown in Fig. 11 is coded on a frame-by-frame basis. This flowchart also corresponds to the sequence of coding processing described in Fig. 13.<br>
Firstly, the variable length decoding unit VLD decodes the<br>
25 "AFF" (S20). When the value of "AFF" is "1" indicating that the switching of frame/field is operated on a block-by-block basis (Yes in S21), the variable length decoding unit VLD decodes the frame weighting factor (S23) and generates a field weighting factor based on it (for instance, appropriating a frame weighting factor)<br>
30     (S24).<br>
On the other hand, when the value of the "AFF" is "0" indicating that the switching of frame/field on a  block-by-block<br><br>
basis does not take place (S21: No), the variable length decoding unit VLD decodes either the "field weighting factor" as a "picture weighting factor" or the "field weighting factor" (S22).<br>
Thus, by employing the picture coding/decoding method 5 according to the present embodiment, the switching of frame/field on a block-by-block basis is realized, prediction efficiency is improved, which eventually brings an improvement of the compression rate. Furthermore, even when the "field weighting factor" is not coded, the variable length decoding unit VLD 10 generates the "field weighting factor" based on the "frame weighting factor" so that the switching of field/frame on a block basis takes place without any problems.<br>
(Second Embodiment)<br>
15	The present embodiment describes an example of a case in<br>
which a data structure of a picture area is different from the one illustrated in the first embodiment.<br>
Figs. 17A, 17B and 17C are diagrams showing examples of a data   structure   of   a   picture   area   according   to   the   present<br>
20 embodiment. These diagrams also show a detailed data structure of a "header" included in a common information area in a picture area. The present embodiment illustrates an example of a structure of the "header" from which a field weighting factor can be abbreviated when the "picture frame coding information" indicates<br>
25     "1" and the picture is coded on a frame-by-frame basis.<br>
As shown in Figs. 17A and 17B, the "header" includes "Field factor presence/absence information" as well as the "AFF". The "Field factor presence/absence information" is a flag indicating whether or not the "header" has a field weighting factor.     For<br>
30 example, the flag is set to "1" when the "header" has the field weighting factor and is set to "0" when the field weighting factor is abbreviated.<br><br>
Fig. 17A is a case in which both the "AFF" and "Field factor presence/absence information" are set to "1" and the field weighting factor is transmitted. The "field weighting factor" includes the "first field weighting factor" and the "second field 5 weighting factor" as in the case of the first embodiment described above.<br>
Fig. 17B is a case in which the "AFF" is set to "1" and the "Field factor presence/absence information" is set to "0".<br>
Fig. 17C is a case in which the switching of field/frame on a 10 block-by-block basis does not take place since the "AFF" is set to "0".<br>
Fig. 18 is a flowchart showing a sequence of coding processing with respect to the weighting factors operated by the variable length coding unit VLC according to the present 15     embodiment.<br>
Firstly, when the value of the "AFF" indicates "1" and the<br>
switching of frame/field on a block-by-block basis is operated (Yes<br>
in   SIO),   the  variable  length  coding   unit  VLC  codes  the "AFF"<br>
indicating that the switching on a block-by-block basis takes place<br>
20     (S31).<br>
Moreover, the variable length coding unit VLC determines whether or not a field weighting factor can be generated based on a frame weighting factor (S32), and when this is possible, codes information indicating the generation of the field weighting factor, 25 and the frame weighting factor (S36, S37). When the field weighting factor is not generated based on the frame weighting factor, the variable length coding unit VLC codes information indicating the presence/absence of the field weighting factor as well as the frame weighting factor and the field weighting factor (S 30     33-S35).<br>
On the other hand, when the value of the "AFF" is "0" and the switching of frame/field on a block-by-block basis is not operated<br><br>
(No in SIO), the subsequent processing is the same as in the flowchart illustrated in Fig. 15 (Sll, S12).<br>
Fig.   19   is  a  flowchart  showing   a   sequence  of  decoding<br>
processing with respect to the weighting factors operated by the<br>
5     variable  length  decoding   unit VLD  described   in   Fig.   11.     This<br>
flowchart   also   corresponds   to   the   sequence   of   the   coding<br>
processing described in Fig. 18.<br>
Firstly, when the value of the "AFF" is"l" Indicating that the switching of frame/field on a block-by-block basis is operated (Yes<br>
10 in S21), the variable length decoding unit VLD decodes the "AFF" (S20) and then decodes the information indicating the presence/absence of the field weighting factor (S41).<br>
Then,  the variable  length  decoding  unit VLD  determines whether or not the field weighting factor is found (S42), decodes<br>
15 the frame weighting factor when the field weighting factor is not found (S45) and generates the field weighting factor based on the frame weighting factor (S46). When the field weighting factor is found, the variable length decoding unit VLD decodes both the frame weighting factor and the field weighting factor (S43, S44).<br>
20	On  the  other  hand,  when  the  value  of the "AFF"  is "0"<br>
indicating that the switching of frame/field on a block-by-block basis is not operated (No in S21), the picture weighting factor Is decoded (S22).<br>
Thus,  by employing  the  picture  coding/decoding   method<br>
25 according to the present embodiment, the switching of frame/field on a block-by-block basis is realized. Furthermore, the field weighting factor can be generated based on the frame weighting factor even when the field weighting factor is abbreviated.<br>
30	(Third Embodiment)<br>
The present embodiment describes a case in which the data structure of the picture area Is different from the one illustrated in<br><br>
the first embodiment.<br>
Figs. 20A, 20B and 20C are diagrams showing examples of the data structure of the picture area according to the present embodiment. It shows a detailed data structure of a "header" 5 when the "picture frame coding information" included In a common information area in a picture area indicates "1" and the picture is coded on a frame-by-frame basis. The present embodiment illustrates an example of the structure of the "header" from which the frame weighting factor can be abbreviated.<br>
10	As shown in Figs. 20A and 20B, the "header" includes the<br>
"Frame factor presence/absence information" as well as the "AFF". The "Frame factor presence/absence information" is a flag indicating whether or not the "header" includes the frame weighting factor.    For example, the flag is set to "1" when the<br>
15 frame weighting factor is found and is set to "0" when the frame weighting factor is abbreviated.<br>
Fig. 20A is a case in which both the "AFF" and the "Frame factor presence/absence information" are set to "1" and the frame weighting factor is transmitted.    Fig. 20B is a case in which the<br>
20 "AFF" is set to "1" and the "Frame factor identification information" is set to "0". Fig. 20C is a case in which the switching of field/frame on a block-by-block basis is not operated since the "AFF" is set to "0".<br>
Fig.   21   is   a   flowchart   showing   a   sequence   of   coding<br>
25 processing with respect to the weighting factors operated by the variable length coding unit VLC according to the present embodiment.<br>
Firstly, the variable length coding unit VLC codes the "AFF" indicating that the switching on a block-by-block basis is operated<br>
30 (S51) when the value of the "AFF" is "1" and the switching of frame/field on a block-by-block basis takes place (Yes in SIG).<br>
Furthermore, the variable length coding unit VLC determines<br><br>
whether or not to generate a frame weighting factor based on a field weighting factor (S52). When a frame weighting factor is generated based on a field weighting factor, the variable length coding unit VLC codes information indicating the generation of the 5 frame weighting factor, and the field weighting factor (S56, S57). When the frame weighting factor is not generated based on the field weighting factor (No in S52), the variable length coding unit VLC codes information indicating the presence/absence of the frame weighting factor as well as the field weighting factor and the<br>
10     frame weighting factor (553^^555).<br>
On the other hand, when the value of the "AFF" is "0" and the switching of frame/field on a block-by-block basis does not take place (No in SIO), the same coding processing as described in Fig. 15 is performed (Sll, S12).<br>
15	Fig.   22   is  a   flowchart  showing   a  sequence  of decoding<br>
processing with respect to the weighting factors operated by the variable length decoding unit VLD illustrated in Fig. 11. This diagram also corresponds to the sequence of the coding processing described in Fig. 21.<br>
20	Firstly, when the value of the "AFF" is "1" indicating that the<br>
switching of frame/field on a block-by-block basis is operated (Yes in S21), the variable length decoding unit VLD firstly decodes the "AFF" (S20) and then the information indicating the presence/absence of the frame weighting factor (S61).<br>
25	Then,  the variable  length  decoding   unit VLD  determines<br>
whether or not the frame weighting factor ]s found (S62), decodes the field weighting factor (S65) when the frame weighting factor is not found (Yes in S62) and generates a frame weighting factor based   on  the  field   weighting   factor  (S66).     When   the  frame<br>
30     weighting factor is found  (No in S62), both the field weighting factor and the frame weighting factor are decoded (S63, S64).<br>
On  the  other  hand,  when  the  value  of the  "AFF"  is "0"<br><br>
indicating that the switching of frame/field on a biock-by-block basis is not operated (No in S21), the variable length decoding unit VLD decodes a picture weighting factor (S22).<br>
Thus,  by employing  the  picture coding/decoding  method<br>
5     according to the present embodiment, the switching of field/frame<br>
on  a   block-by-block  basis  is  realized.     In  addition,  the  frame<br>
weighing factor can be generated  based on the field weighting<br>
factor even when the frame weighting factor is abbreviated.<br>
10	(Fourth embodiment)<br>
Furthermore, the processing shown in each of the above embodiments can be carried out easily in an independent computer system by recording the program for realizing the picture coding/decoding    method    described    in    each    of    the    above<br>
15 embodiments onto a storage medium such as a flexible disk or the like.<br>
Fig. 23 is an illustration for carrying out the picture coding/decoding method described in each of the above embodiments in the computer system using the program recorded<br>
20     onto the storage medium such as a flexible disk or the like.<br>
Fig. 23B shows a full appearance of a flexible disk, its structure at cross section and the flexible disk itself whereas Fig. 23A shows an example of a physical format of the flexible disk as a main body of a storage medium.    A flexible disk FD is contained in<br>
25     a case F with a plurality of tracks Tr formed concentrically from the<br>
periphery to the inside on the surface of the disk, and each track is<br>
divided  into  16 sectors Se in the angular direction.    Thus, the<br>
program is stored in an area assigned for it on the flexible disk FD.<br>
Fig. 23C shows a structure for recording and reading out the<br>
30 program on the flexible disk FD. When the program is recorded on the flexible disk FD, the computer system Cs writes in the program via  a flexible disk drive.    When the coding  apparatus and the<br><br>
decoding apparatus are constructed in the computer system using<br>
the program on the flexible disk, the program is read out from the<br>
flexible disk and then transferred to the computer system by the<br>
flexible disk drive.<br>
5	The above explanation  is made on an assumption that a<br>
storage medium is a flexible disk, but the same processing can also be performed using an optical disk. In addition, the storage medium is not limited to a flexible disk and an optical disk, but any other medium such as an IC card and a ROM cassette capable of 10     recording a program can be used.<br>
(Fifth embodiment)<br>
The following is a description for the applications of the picture coding/decoding method illustrated in the 15     above-mentioned embodiments and a system using them.<br>
Fig. 24 is a block diagram showing an overall configuration of<br>
a   content  supply  system   exlOO  for  realizing   content  delivery<br>
service.    The area for providing communication service is divided<br>
into cells of desired size, and cell sites exl07'^exll0, which are<br>
20     fixed wireless stations, are placed in respective cells.<br>
This content supply system ex 100 is connected to apparatuses such as a computer exlll, a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) exll2, a camera exll3, a mobile phone exll4 and a mobile phone with a camera exll5 via, for example, Internet 25 exlOl, an Internet service provider exl02, a telephone network exl04, as well as the cell sites exl07~exll0.<br>
However, the content supply system exlOO is not limited to<br>
the configuration shown in Fig. 24 and  may be connected to a<br>
combination   of  any   of  them.     Also,   each   apparatus   may   be<br>
30     connected directly to the telephone network exl04, not through<br>
the cell sites exloy^^^exllO.<br>
The camera exll3 is an apparatus capable of shooting video<br><br>
such as a digital video camera. The mobile phone exll4 may be a mobile phone of any of the following system: a PDC (Personal Digital Communications) system, a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) system, a W-CDMA (Wideband-Code Division Multiple 5 Access) system or a GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) system, a PHS (Personal Handyphone System) or the like.<br>
A streaming server exl03 is connected to the camera exll3 via the telephone network exl04 and  also the cell  site exl09,<br>
10 which realizes a live distribution or the like using the camera exll3 based on the coded data transmitted from the user. Either of the camera exll3, the server which transmits the data and the like may code the data. The moving picture data shot by a camera 6x116 may be transmitted to the streaming server exl03 via the<br>
15 computer exlll. In this case, either the camera exll6 or the computer exlll may code the moving picture data. An LSI exll7 included in the computer exlll and the camera exll6 performs the coding processing. Software for coding and decoding pictures may be integrated into any type of storage medium (such as a<br>
20 CD-ROM, a flexible disk and a hard disk) that is a recording medium which is readable by the computer exlll or the like. Furthermore, the mobile phone with a camera exll5 may transmit the moving picture data. This moving picture data is the data coded by the LSI included in the mobile phone exllS.<br>
25	The content supply system exlOO codes contents (such as a<br>
music live video) shot by a user using the camera exll3, the camera exll6 or the like in the same way as shown in the above-mentioned embodiments and transmits them to the streaming server exl03, while the streaming server exl03 makes<br>
30 stream delivery of the content data to the clients at their requests. The clients include the computer exlll, the PDA exll2, the camera  exll3,  the  mobile  phone  exll4 and  so  on  capable  of<br><br>
decoding the above-mentioned coded data.    In the content supply<br>
system  exlOO,  the clients can thus receive and  reproduce the<br>
coded data, and can further receive, decode and reproduce the<br>
data in real time so as to realize personal broadcasting.<br>
5	When  each  apparatus  in  this  system  performs coding  or<br>
decoding, the picture coding apparatus or the picture decoding apparatus shown in the above-mentioned embodiments can be used.<br>
A   cell   phone   will   be   explained   as   an   example   of  such<br>
10     apparatus.<br>
Fig. 25 is a diagram showing the mobile phone exll5 using the picture coding/decoding method explained in the above-mentioned embodiments. The mobile phone exll5 has an antenna ex201 for communicating with the cell site exllO via radio<br>
15 waves, a camera unit ex203 such as a CCD camera capable of shooting moving and still pictures, a display unit ex202 such as a liquid crystal display for displaying the data such as decoded pictures and the like shot by the camera unit ex203 or received by the antenna ex201, a body unit including a set of operation keys<br>
20 ex204, an audio output unit ex208 such as a speaker for outputting audio, an audio input unit ex205 such as a microphone for inputting audio, a storage medium ex207 for storing coded or decoded data such as data of moving or still pictures shot by the camera, data of received e-mails and that of moving or still pictures, and a slot unit<br>
25 ex206 for attaching the storage medium ex207 to the mobile phone exll5. The storage medium ex207 stores in itself a flash memory element, a kind of EEPROM (Electrically Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory) that is a nonvolatile memory electrically erasable from and rewritable to a plastic case such as<br>
30     an SD card.<br>
Next, the mobile phone exll5 will be explained with reference to Fig. 26.    In the mobile phone exll5, a main control<br><br>
unit exSll, designed in order to control overall each unit of the main body which contains the display unit ex202 as well as the operation keys ex204, is connected mutually to a power supply circuit unit exSlO, an operation input control unit ex304, a picture 5 coding unit ex312, a camera interface unit ex303, an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) control unit ex302, a picture decoding unit ex309, a multiplexing/demultiplexing unit ex308, a read/write unit ex307, a modem circuit unit ex306 and an audio processing unit ex305 via a synchronous bus ex313.<br>
10	When a call-end key or a power key is turned ON by a user's<br>
operation, the power supply circuit unit ex310 supplies respective units with power from a battery pack so as to activate the digital mobile phone with a camera exll5 as a ready state.<br>
In the mobile phone exll5, the audio processing unit ex305<br>
15 converts the audio signals received by the audio input unit ex205 in conversation mode into digital audio data under the control of the main control unitex311 including a CPU, ROM and RAM, the modem circuit unit ex306 performs spread spectrum processing for the digital   audio  data,   and   the   communication   circuit   unit  ex301<br>
20 performs digital-to-analog conversion and frequency conversion for the data, so as to transmit it via the antenna ex201. Also, in the mobile phone exll5, the communication circuit unit ex301 amplifies the data received by the antenna ex201 in conversation mode and performs frequency conversion and the analog-to-digital<br>
25 conversion to the data, the modem circuit unit ex306 performs inverse spread spectrum processing of the data, and the audio processing unit ex305 converts it into analog audio data, so as to output it via the audio output unit ex208.<br>
Furthermore,    when    transmitting    an    e-mail     in    data<br>
30 communication mode, the text data of the e-mail inputted by operating the operation keys ex204 of the main body is sent out to the main control unit ex311 via the operation input control unit<br><br>
ex304. In the main control unit ex311, after the modem circuit unit ex306 performs spread spectrum processing of the text data and the communication circuit unit ex301 performs the digital-to-analog conversion and the frequency conversion for the 5 text data, the data is transmitted to the cell site exllO via the antenna ex201.<br>
When picture data is transmitted in data communication mode, the picture data shot by the camera unit ex203 is supplied to the picture coding unit ex312 via the camera interface unit ex303.<br>
10 When it is not transmitted, it is also possible to display the picture data shot by the camera unit ex203 directly on the display unit ex202 via the camera interface unit ex303 and the LCD control unit ex302.<br>
The picture coding unit ex312, which includes the picture<br>
15 coding apparatus as explained in the present invention, compresses and codes the picture data supplied from the camera unit ex203 using the coding method employed by the picture coding apparatus as shown in the first embodiment so as to transform   it  into  coded   image  data,   and   sends   it  out  to  the<br>
20 multiplexing/demultiplexing unit ex308. At this time, the mobile phone exll5 sends out the audio received by the audio input unit ex205 during the shooting with the camera unit ex203 to the multiplexing/demultiplexing unit ex308 as digital audio data via the audio processing unit ex305.<br>
25	The multiplexing/demultiplexing unit ex308 multiplexes the<br>
coded image data supplied from the picture coding unit ex312 and the audio data supplied from the audio processing unit ex305, using a predetermined method, then the modem circuit unit ex306 performs  spread   spectrum   processing   of the   multiplexed   data<br>
30 obtained as a result of the multiplexing, and lastly the communication circuit unit ex301 performs digital-to-analog conversion    and    frequency    transform    of    the    data    for    the<br><br>
transmission via the antenna ex201.<br>
As for receiving data of a moving picture file which is linked to a Web page or the like in data communication mode, the modem circuit unit ex306 performs inverse spread spectrum processing for 5 the data received from the cell site exllO via the antenna ex201, and sends out the multiplexed data obtained as a result of the inverse spread spectrum processing.<br>
In order to decode the multiplexed data received via the antenna    ex201,    the    multiplexing/demultiplexing    unit   ex308<br>
10 demultiplexes the multiplexed data into a coded stream of image data and that of audio data, and supplies the coded image data to the picture decoding unit ex309 and the audio data to the audio processing unit ex305, respectively via the synchronous bus ex313.<br>
15	Next, the picture decoding unit ex309, including the picture<br>
decoding apparatus as explained in the above-mentioned invention, decodes the coded stream of the image data using the decoding method  corresponding  to  the  coding   method  as  shown   in  the above-mentioned  embodiments to generate  reproduced  moving<br>
20 picture data, and supplies this data to the display unit ex202 via the LCD control unit ex302, and thus the image data included in the moving picture file linked to a Web page, for instance, is displayed. At the same time, the audio processing unit ex305 converts the audio data into analog audio data, and supplies this data to the<br>
25 audio output unit ex208, and thus the audio data included in the moving picture file linked to a Web page, for instance, is reproduced.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above-mentioned system since ground-based or satellite digital  broadcasting has<br>
30 been in the news lately and at least either the picture coding apparatus or the picture decoding apparatus described in the above-mentioned embodiments can be incorporated into a digital<br><br>
broadcasting system as shown in Fig. 27. More specifically, a coded stream of video information is transmitted from a broadcast station ex409 to or communicated with a broadcast satellite ex410 via radio waves. Upon receipt of it, the broadcast satellite ex410 5 transmits radio waves for broadcasting. Then, a home-use antenna ex406 with a satellite broadcast reception function receives the radio waves, and a television (receiver) ex401 or a set top box (STB) ex407 decodes a coded bit stream for reproduction. The picture  decoding   apparatus  as  shown   in  the  above-mentioned<br>
10 embodiments can be implemented in the reproducing apparatus ex403 for reading out and decoding the coded stream recorded on a storage medium ex402 that is a recording medium such as a CD and a DVD. In this case, the reproduced moving picture signals are  displayed   on  a   monitor  ex404.     It  is  also  conceivable  to<br>
15 implement the picture decoding apparatus in the set top box ex407 connected to a cable ex405 for a cable television or the antenna ex406 for satellite and/or ground-based broadcasting so as to reproduce them on a monitor ex408 of the television ex401. The picture decoding apparatus may be incorporated into the television,<br>
20 not in the set top box. Also, a car ex412 having an antenna ex411 can receive signals from the satellite ex410 or the cell site exl07 for replaying moving pictures on a display device such as a car navigation system ex413 set in the car ex412.<br>
Furthermore, the picture coding apparatus as shown in the<br>
25 above-mentioned embodiments can code picture signals and record them on a storage medium. As a concrete example, a recorder ex420 such as a DVD recorder for recording picture signals on a DVD disk ex421, a disk recorder for recording them on a hard disk can be cited.    They can be recorded on an SD card<br>
30 ex422. When the recorder ex420 includes the picture decoding apparatus as shown in the above-mentioned embodiments, the picture signals recorded on the DVD disk ex421 or the SD card<br><br>
ex422 can be reproduced for display on the monitor ex408.<br>
As for the structure of the car navigation system ex413, the<br>
structure without the camera unit ex203, the camera interface unit<br>
ex303 and the picture coding unit ex312, out of the components<br>
5     shown   in   Fig.   26,   is  conceivable.     The   same   applies  for  the<br>
computer exlll, the television (receiver) ex401 and others.<br>
In    addition,    three   types   of   implementations    can    be<br>
conceived  for a  terminal  such  as  the  mobile   phone  exll4;   a<br>
sending/receiving terminal implemented with both an encoder and<br>
10     a decoder, a sending terminal implemented with an encoder only,<br>
and a receiving terminal implemented with a decoder only.<br>
As described above, it is possible to use the picture coding<br>
method   and   the   picture   decoding   method   described   in   the<br>
above-mentioned embodiments for any of the above-mentioned<br>
15     apparatuses and systems, and by using these methods, the effects<br>
described in the above-mentioned embodiments can be obtained.<br>
From the invention thus described, it will be obvious that the<br>
embodiments of the invention may be varied in many ways.    Such<br>
variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and<br>
20     scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would  be<br>
obvious to one skilled in the art are intended for inclusion within<br>
the scope of the following claims.<br>
Thus, with the picture coding/decoding method according to the present invention,  it is possible to realize the switching of 25     field/frame on a block basis and improve the prediction efficiency and the compression rate.<br>
Moreover, with the picture coding/decoding method according to the present invention, the field weighting factor is generated based on the field weighting factor, therefore, the field 30 weighting factor can be abbreviated from the data to be transmitted and thereby the transmission efficiency can be improved.    Consequently, its practical value is high.<br><br>
