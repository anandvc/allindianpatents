BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a sputtering target and a<br>
manufacturing method thereof, the target being used for forming a film of an<br>
oxide layer which is a constitution layer of a recordable optical recording<br>
medium. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a recordable optical<br>
recording medium manufactured by using the sputtering target, in particular,<br>
a recordable optical recording medium which enables a high density<br>
recording even in a blue laser wavelength area.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
In order to provide a recordable optical recording medium which<br>
enables recording and reproduction using a laser beam with a wavelength the<br>
same or less than that of a blue laser beam, extensive development is<br>
underway for blue laser beams which enable ultra-high density recording,<br>
along with development of recordable optical recording media to which<br>
such blue laser beams can be used.<br>
The present inventors propose the validity of a recording layer<br>
containing as a main component a metal or a half metal oxide, in particular<br>
bismuth oxide (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) Nos.<br>
20O3-48375, 2005-161831, and 2005-108396) as a recordable optical<br>
recording medium which enables high density recording at a wavelength the.<br><br>
same as or less than the wavelength of the blue laser.<br>
The applicant of the present invention discloses in the prior<br>
application (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No.<br>
2006-247897) a recordable optical recording medium which has a recording<br>
layer containing as a main component of the constituent element bismuth<br>
and containing bismuth oxide, the recording layer containing one or more<br>
elements X selected from B, P, Ga, As, Se, Tc, Pd, Ag, Sb, Te, W, Re, Os, Ir,<br>
Pt, Au, Hg, Tl, Po, At, and Cd. The applicant also discloses that the<br>
recordable optical recording medium using a film including Bi, B, and oxide<br>
has excellent characteristics, and that a sputtering method can be also used<br>
as a method for forming this layer.<br>
The sputtering method has been widely known as one of the<br>
vapor-phase deposition techniques for thin film deposition. The method is<br>
also used in an industrial thin film deposition. In the sputtering method, a<br>
target material which has the same component as a film to be deposited is<br>
prepared. Normally, argon gas ion which is generated by means of glow<br>
discharge in the target material is then allowed to collide with this target<br>
material with the result that the constituent atoms of the target material are<br>
hammered out, and atoms are accumulated on the substrate with the result<br>
that a film is formed. Since oxides generally have high melting points in<br>
particular, a method such as vapor deposition is not favorable and thus a<br>
radio frequency sputtering that involves application of a high frequency is<br><br>
often used.<br>
Sputtering has produced many results in the manufacturing process<br>
and is favorable in a point of through-put. However, in the case where a<br>
film made of material containing two or more elements is to be deposited,<br>
the resultant film often has a different composition than its sputtering target,<br>
thus requiring a consideration for determining the composition of the target.<br>
Furthermore, the structure and the quality of the film often differ depending<br>
on the form in which the compound constituting the target is contained; thus,<br>
it is also required to consider this point.<br>
Furthermore, it is also required to further improve the film<br>
deposition rate from the viewpoint of the production cost. For increased<br>
film deposition rate, it is required to introduce a large power. In this case as<br>
well, it is required to improve the target strength so as to avoid destruction of<br>
the target.<br>
As a known technology, for example, Japanese Patent Application<br>
Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 11-92922 discloses a Bi-based oxide target as a<br>
sputtering target for the formation of a dielectric film. However, this<br>
document does not describe a target containing B. If the kinds of<br>
constituent elements are different, so is the relationship between the<br>
composition and constituent compounds of the aforementioned target and<br>
the structure and composition of the deposited film. Consequently, it is<br>
required to change the composition of the target. The information<br><br>
disclosed in this document does not constitute a reference of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Furthermore, the Publication of the Japanese Patent Application<br>
Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 2005-264206 discloses a description of a Bi2O3-based<br>
glass-like target containing B2O3. However, the invention in this document<br>
inevitably contains SiO2 and is associated with the glass-like target with the<br>
result that the invention in the document is different from the present<br>
invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to realize a recordable optical recording medium which<br>
enables high density recording, a film which contains Bi ,B and oxygen and<br>
which has a stable composition and structure is required. For this purpose,<br>
an appropriate sputtering target is required. However, the form and the<br>
structure of a compound constituting the target, impurities, etc., affect the<br>
composition and the crystallinity of the film to be formed. For this reason,<br>
it is required that the compound constituting a target be one which is suitable<br>
for the characteristics of the required film. Consequently, an object of the<br>
present invention is to provide a sputtering target and a manufacturing<br>
method thereof, the sputtering target being suitable for the realization of the<br>
recordable optical recording medium which enables high density recording<br>
having such favorable recording characteristics as low jitter, a high density<br><br>
recordable optical recording medium using the sputtering target.<br>
Furthermore, another object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
sputtering target which realizes increased film deposition rate for improved<br>
productivity, shows high strength upon film deposition, and has high<br>
packing density.<br>
Furthermore, a recordable recording medium containing Bi and B in<br>
the recording layer is disclosed. It is also disclosed that the ratio of the<br>
number of Bi atoms to the number of B atoms, B/Bi, is set to 1.25 or less.<br>
However, as a result of extensive studies made particularly for the recording<br>
layer containing Bi and B, the range of their relative proportions within<br>
which excellent characteristics - particularly archibability — can be obtained<br>
has been established. It has been established that adding B to a recordable<br>
optical recording medium containing Bi and B in the recording layer<br>
improves archibability. Since the appropriate layer structure is different<br>
between a disc for conducting recording and reproduction by allowing light<br>
to be incident thereon from the side of a substrate as seen in so-called HD<br>
DVD and a disc for conducting recording and reproduction by allowing light<br>
to be incident thereon from the side of a cover layer as seen in so-called<br>
Blu-ray disc, the appropriate composition of the recording layer tends to be<br>
different. In consideration of productivity or the like, it is preferable that<br>
the composition of the recording layer be in the same range. Therefore, an<br>
object of the present invention is to provide a recordable optical recording<br><br>
medium which has favorable characteristics in a disc having a different layer<br>
structure and which has particularly improved archibability by causing both<br>
the atomic ratio of Bi to B and the content of O, which have not been<br>
contemplated in the related art, to fall within their optimal ranges.<br>
The sputtering target of the present invention for preparing a<br>
recordable optical recording medium comprises Bi and B.<br>
The method of the present invention for manufacturing a sputtering<br>
target comprising Bi and Bi for preparing a recordable optical recording<br>
medium adopts a sintering method.<br>
The recordable optical recording medium of the present invention<br>
comprises a film which comprises as main components Bi, B and oxygen, the<br>
film being deposited by using a sputtering target comprising Bi and Bi for<br>
preparing a recordable optical recording medium.<br>
The recordable optical recording medium of the present invention<br>
comprises a substrate, and recording layer formed over the substrate, the<br>
recording layer containing at least Bi, B and O as main components, and the<br>
ratio of Bi to B in the recording layer being set to 3/7<bi></bi>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention described above will be explained.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided<br>
a sputtering target containing as main components Bi and B. According to<br>
a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a sputtering target<br>
containing as main components Bi, B and oxygen. Bi and B can assume a<br>
form wherein they are included as a single element, a form wherein they are<br>
included as an oxide, and a form wherein they are included as other<br>
compounds. In the case where the sputtering target is used for the<br>
deposition of a recording layer of a optical recording medium, the sputtering<br>
target is used as an oxide. Consequently, preferably Bi and B are included in<br>
the form of single element or oxide. When Bi and B are each included as a<br>
single element, it is required that oxygen be added upon film deposition to<br>
form an oxide film. When a target including oxygen is used as shown in the<br>
second aspect of the present invention, it is not required to add oxygen at the<br>
time of film deposition. Note that the main component in first aspect of the<br>
present invention and the second aspect of the present invention refer to<br>
inclusion of about 90 atom% or more of the aforementioned elements.<br>
Normally, except for impurity elements and slight amounts of the<br>
component elements in the eighth aspect of the present invention which will<br>
be described later, the sputtering target consists only of the aforementioned<br>
elements.<br><br>
According to the third aspect of the present invention 3, there is<br>
provided a sputtering target which is crystalline. When the target is<br>
amorphous, the target temperature rises in the midst of the film deposition<br>
with the result that the target becomes partially or entirely crystalline.<br>
Since the strength of the atom bond or the like differs between non-crystals<br>
and crystals, a difference is generated in the properties and the composition<br>
of the deposited film. When the target is crystalline, the change with the<br>
lapse of time can be suppressed. Furthermore, crystal particle diameters or<br>
crystal size are made uniform and the crystals are made fine, with the result<br>
that the composition shift and disuniformity of the crystal structure can be<br>
suppressed.<br>
According to the fourth aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a sputtering target in which the atomic ratio of Bi to B is such that<br>
0.6<bi when bi increases in quantity it becomes likely that the></bi>
deposited film undergoes crystallization. Consequently, the recording<br>
characteristics and the archivability are deteriorated and cracking of the<br>
target is likely to occur, with the result that the productivity becomes worse.<br>
On the other hand, when Bi is reduced in quantity, the recording<br>
characteristics become worse. Jitters of optical recording media with a<br>
recording layer deposited by sputtering of the target having the<br>
aforementioned atomic ratio range are favorable (see Example 7 to be<br>
described later). In the case where the atomic ratio is smaller than 0.6, it<br><br>
results in an increase in jitter. In the case where the atomic ratio is larger<br>
than 7.0, it results in a undesirable archivability reduction.<br>
According to a fifth aspect of the present invention, there is provided<br>
a sputtering target including a complex oxide of Bi and B. Assuming a form<br>
of the complex oxide enables stable presence of crystals, thereby increasing<br>
the target strength. Complex oxides include Bi4B2O9, BiBO3, and Bi3B5O12.<br>
Inclusion of the compound comprising three elements of Bi-B-O heightens<br>
the target strength, which is favorable.<br>
According to a sixth aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a sputtering target including Bi4B2O9 as the complex oxide.<br>
Bi4B2O9 offers excellent film deposition rate and strength among other<br>
complex oxides, with the result that an optical recording medium having<br>
favorable recording characteristics after film deposition can be realized.<br>
Judgment as to whether or not Bi4B2O9 is included is made by X-ray<br>
diffraction. In the X-ray diffraction analysis, the lattice constant changes<br>
due to variations in measurement temperature, the inner stress of the film,<br>
variations in the wavelength of the X-ray, or composition shift, and thus shift<br>
is generated in an angle at which the refraction peak is generated. With<br>
respect to known substances, a response to a question as to at which angle<br>
the peak of the X-ray diffraction is generated can be found through the<br>
retrieval of the ASTM (American Society for Testing and Material) card and<br>
the JCPDS. At the time of identifying the peak of the X-ray diffraction by<br><br>
analyzing the specimen, the ASTM card and "JCPDS card chart" are widely<br>
used. Incidentally, the "JCPDS" is an abbreviation for the "Joint<br>
Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards". The JCPDS refers to a chart<br>
of the X-ray diffraction which is distributed by an organization called the<br>
International Centre for Diffraction Data. Currently, the chart of many<br>
standard substances is stored for retrieval. The X-ray diffraction chart of<br>
specimen whose component is not unknown is compared with a chart of the<br>
aforementioned standard substance with the result that it is judged as to<br>
which chart of the standard substance is constituent with or is approximate<br>
to the chart of the substance whose component is unknown and the<br>
specimen is identified in the judgment. An identification method which is<br>
conducted by using the "JCPDS card chart" is a method which is widely<br>
used in the world as shown in the "general rule of the X-ray diffraction" and<br>
an "analysis of the general rule of the X-ray diffraction,"(Japanese<br>
Industrial Standards) and an "X-ray diffraction analysis" of the ceramic<br>
basic standard 3 edited by the Tokyo Institute of Technology. It is<br>
investigated as to whether the specimen whose component is unknown is<br>
consistent with or is approximate to the chart of the standard substance to<br>
identify the substance.<br>
In the identification of the substance, a surface interval is<br>
determined by using the Bragg's Law from each measured peak to identify<br>
the corresponding crystal structure. Furthermore, in a material in which a<br><br>
specific crystal surface is oriented, it is possible to identify the substance<br>
from the peak ratio of a plurality of peaks corresponding to the crystal<br>
surface. In the X-ray diffraction, the lattice constant changes because of<br>
causes such as the measured temperature, the inner stress of the film, an<br>
error of the wavelength of the X-ray, and a composition shift or the like with<br>
the result that a shift is generated in the angle in which the diffraction peak is<br>
generated. Consequently, when the peak is present in the vicinity of the<br>
angle which is generated at the diffraction peak, it is possible to say that the<br>
substance is the corresponding substance.<br>
With respect to a shift is generated in the diffraction peak, for<br>
example, a peak from the peak having a surface interval of 3.101A is<br>
referenced from the standard chart of Bi4B2O9 (reference code: 25-1089)<br>
and the measured result is compared with respect to the other target which is<br>
prepared in the same preparation method. Thus, the surface interval of<br>
reference data is 3.1010A while there is a slight shift in the measurement<br>
result such as 3.1058, 3.0952 and the like. However, such degree of shift is<br>
generated within the scope of error when the measurement is repeated with<br>
the result that it is possible to say that any one includes Bi4B2O9.<br>
According to a seventh aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a sputtering target whose packing density is 72% to 100%.<br>
Increasing the packing density leads to an improvement in the target's<br><br>
strength thereby increasing the film deposition rate. When the packing<br>
density is lowered, the film deposition rate slows down. In addition, the<br>
target itself becomes fragile with the result that many problems such as the<br>
generation of cracking in the formed film or the like occur. Incidentally, the<br>
packing density described herein refers to a value obtained by determining in<br>
calculation a weight when the target volume is occupied by 100% material<br>
substance, and determining the weight as a density in comparison with the<br>
weight of the target which is actually prepared. As shown in Example 8<br>
which will be described later, a favorable sputtering target has a packing<br>
density of 72% or more. Furthermore, the film deposition rate becomes 1.5<br>
times as fast as the case of 72% when the packing density is 93% or more.<br>
Since the packing density becomes still larger in the case of approximately<br>
100%, the advantage is large.<br>
According to an eighth aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a sputtering target including at least one element selected from Li,<br>
Al, Fe, Mg, NA, and Si. By adding these elements, it becomes easy to<br>
increase the packing density. Furthermore, since the connection between<br>
crystals can be made strong, it becomes possible to realize a target of high<br>
strength. It is preferable that the addition amount be as small as possible.<br>
At most, the amount may be about 10 atomic%. When the addition amount<br>
is too large, it results in a lost of property as a sputtering target containing as<br>
main components Bi and B, or Bi, B and oxygen is lost, which is not<br><br>
favorable.<br>
According to a ninth aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a sputtering target in which oxygen is smaller in quantity than the<br>
stoichimetric composition. It is possible to improve recording characteristics<br>
of the optical recording medium by decreasing the oxygen amount than in<br>
the stoichiometric composition. Even when oxygen is small in quantity, it<br>
becomes possible to add oxygen at the time of film deposition by sputtering<br>
using gas including oxygen. Thus, there is no problem. Furthermore,<br>
decreasing oxygen increases the bonding force of crystals thereby providing<br>
an effect of improving a target density, improving target's strength, and<br>
increasing film deposition rate.<br>
According to a tenth aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a sputtering target including at least one of Bi oxide and B oxide.<br>
When the B oxide, particularly, B2O3 oxide exists, the sensitivity at the<br>
recording time can be improved because B2O3 has a low melting point.<br>
Furthermore, when at least one of the Bi oxide and B oxide is contained, it<br>
results in the deposition of a film that contains as main components Bi, B<br>
and oxygen, showing favorable recording characteristics.<br>
According to an eleventh aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a method for fabricating a sputtering target using a sintering<br>
method. Use of the sintering method enables favorable preparation of a<br>
sputtering target having an oxide having a high melting point.<br><br>
According to a twelfth aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a method comprising a step of removing moisture from material<br>
powders in the sintering method. The step of removing moisture refers to a<br>
step of removing moisture from material powders with such a method as<br>
vacuum drying prior to weight measurement. It is also possible to use a step<br>
of heating each kind of the material powders at a temperature lower than<br>
their melting point but at 100°C or higher. In the case of oxide at this time,<br>
the heat treatment in the atmosphere is enabled.<br>
For example, B2O3 absorbs moisture with ease with the result that<br>
the measurement error of the quantity of the materials can be decreased by<br>
adding the step of removing the moisture and the reproduction of the<br>
composition is heightened.<br>
According to a thirteenth aspect of the present invention, mere is<br>
provided a manufacturing method of a sputtering target that involves<br>
sintering of Bi2O3 and B2O3 powders. Since Bi2O3 and B2O3 powders can be<br>
easily obtained, the manufacturing costs are low. Furthermore, since these<br>
powders have relatively low melting points, it is relatively easy to increase<br>
the packing density and to readily provide a target with a high strength.<br>
Since B2O3 has water absorption properties, these powders are smashed by<br>
means of a drying method or in an organic solvent and classified with the<br>
result that powders having a uniform diameter are provided. Subsequently,<br>
the powders are mixed together and molded to have a certain shape, followed<br><br>
by sintering. Sintering is performed by placing the molded article at 420°C<br>
in the atmosphere. It is possible to improve the strength of the target by<br>
repeating the cycle of the step of again smashing, molding, and heating the<br>
sintered article. In the second and subsequent sintering steps, the sintering<br>
temperature can be raised up to about 630°C. When B2O3 is present in the<br>
target, it absorbs moisture, resulting in a high moisture absorption rate and<br>
the quality of the target is deteriorated in some cases. In order to avoid this,<br>
the powders are mixed in the condition where no moisture is absorbed, and<br>
the powders are sintered at a temperature equal to or less than the melting<br>
point of B2O3. The obtained powders are smashed and a target is prepared<br>
by conducting heating and pressing type sintering with the result that a target<br>
having a high uniformity can be obtained and the advantage is large.<br>
Furthermore, the particles may be smashed by sintering particles at a<br>
temperature equal to or less than the melting point of B2O3. In particular, it<br>
is important to provide a step in which no B2O3 is left in the resultant target.<br>
Furthermore, the fact that time for sintering at a low temperature of 420° C<br>
or less is prolonged and complex compound of Bi and B is sintered followed<br>
by raising the temperature to about 630°C for short time sintering has a large<br>
effect.<br>
A sputtering target can be obtained by bonding the target which has<br>
been sintered as described above to an oxygen-free copper backing plate by<br>
means of metal bonding or resin bonding.<br><br>
In an overall flow of the manufacturing process of the sputtering<br>
target, it is possible to use a step of weighing materials, dry type ball mill<br>
mixing, hot pressing, mold processing and bonding. Furthermore, a step of<br>
weighing materials, moisture type ball mill mixing, spray drying, hot<br>
pressing, mold processing and bonding can be used.<br>
According to a fourteenth aspect of the present invention, the<br>
invention relates to an optical recording medium having a film containing as<br>
main components Bi, B and oxygen by using a sputtering target described in<br>
any of the first to the tenth aspects of the present invention. A required film<br>
is formed on a resin substrate such as a polycarbonate substrate to provide an<br>
optical recording medium. A groove or a pit may be formed on the resin<br>
substrate for control of tracking or the like. An argon gas is introduced into<br>
a vacuum and a high frequency power is applied with the result that a film is<br>
formed which contains as main components Bi, B and oxygen. In addition,<br>
a metal film as a reflection layer, or a protection layer for improving<br>
characteristics may be provided.<br>
According to the first to fourteenth aspects of the present invention,<br>
a sputtering target, a manufacturing method thereof and a high density<br>
recordable optical recording medium using the sputtering target can be<br>
provided, the sputtering target being suitable to the realization of a<br>
recordable optical recording medium which has such favorable recording<br>
characteristics as low jitter and which enables high density recording.<br><br>
Furthermore, the present invention can provide a sputtering target which<br>
enables the improvement in the film deposition rate for the improvement of<br>
the productivity and which has a high strength at the time of the film<br>
deposition and has an increased packing density.<br>
According to a fifteen aspect of the present invention, the invention<br>
relates to a recordable optical recording medium wherein a recording layer<br>
containing at least Bi, B and O is provided on a substrate and the atomic<br>
ratio of Bi to B in the recording layer is such that 3/7<bi in the case></bi>
where the atomic ratio Bi/B is larger than 8, the archivability is reduced.<br>
Although the cause thereof is not clear, it is thought that the recording mark<br>
is formed of a Bi single metal, and oxides of Bi and B or the like in the case<br>
of the optical recording medium of the present invention. When the<br>
proportion of Bi becomes too large, it becomes highly likely that the single<br>
metal of Bi is produced and thus it occupies a large area of a recording mark.<br>
With Bi single metal, deterioration such as oxidation or the like is likely to<br>
occur. It is thought that archivability is reduced in the case where the<br>
atomic ratio Bi/B is greater than 8. There is provided an advantage in that<br>
the presence of a large area of Bi single metal becomes rare by the addition<br>
of B and the area of the Bi single metal is divided into small areas. As a<br>
consequence, the recording characteristics and archivability are improved.<br>
It is thought that the archivability of the recordable optical recording<br>
medium is excellent in the case where the atomic ratio Bi/B is smaller than<br><br>
3/7. However, it is thought that the recording sensitivity is lowered and the<br>
recording becomes insufficient because the phase separation such as<br>
separation of Bi occurs with more difficulty. Furthermore, with respect to<br>
the target for the formation of the recording layer, the melting point is<br>
lowered in the composition containing a large amount of Bi, and the target<br>
becomes vulnerable to the thermal change, reducing the target's strength.<br>
In addition, with respect to the compound target of Bi-B-0 added with B or<br>
the like, a ternary compound such as B14B2O9 comprising three elements can<br>
be easily prepared with the result that the connection between atoms<br>
becomes strong and the target's strength is improved. However, since the<br>
boron oxide has a low melting point on the order of 450°C, it becomes<br>
difficult to conduct sintering at a high temperature when B increases.<br>
Consequently, a low temperature sintering is required. In the low<br>
temperature sintering, the connection strength between particles can be<br>
hardly raised with the result that the preparation of the target becomes<br>
difficult and the strength is lowered. The content of Bi, B and O as a whole<br>
is 100%, namely, it is not required to include other element except for<br>
impurities. Furthermore, other clement(s) may be added in amounts up to<br>
10%.<br>
Upon determination of the atomic ratio Bi/B, the amounts of Bi, B<br>
and O are measured under conditions as shown in Tables 1 and 2 by means<br>
of the Rutherford Backward Scattering (RBS) and Nuclear Reaction<br><br>
Analysis (NRA). The composition which is determined with this method<br>
includes an error such that Bi is +0.5 atomic%, B is +2.0 atomic%, and O is<br>
±3.0 atomic%. The atomic ratio Bi/B and the atomic ratio O/B ratio are<br>
measured in the same manner.<br><br><br><br><br>
According to a fifteen aspect of the present invention, a recordable<br>
optical recording medium excellent in recording characteristics and<br>
archiavability can be provided by providing a recording layer containing at<br>
least Bi, B and O on the substrate, and by setting the atomic ratio of Bi to B<br>
in the recording layer such that 3/7<bi></bi>
According to a sixteenth aspect of the present invention, the<br><br>
invention relates to an optical recordable recording medium in which the<br>
ratio of O to B in the recording layer is set such that 2.2
been made clear that the quantity of oxygen in the recording layer largely<br>
affects the recording characteristics. When the quantity of oxygen is small,<br>
the recording sensitivity is heightened. However, since the coefficient of<br>
the thermal conductivity of the recording layer is heightened, the heat<br>
generated by the light application at the recording time is likely to be<br>
widened with the result that it becomes difficult to conduct high density<br>
recording. Furthermore, when the quantity of oxygen is too large, the<br>
recording sensitivity is lowered, and the recording becomes insufficient with<br>
the result that favorable characteristics cannot be easily obtained.<br>
An optimal oxygen amount differs in different atomic ratios Bi/B, so<br>
an optimal value of O/B changes accordingly. For example, in the case<br>
where the atomic ratio Bi/B is 2/1, it is preferable that O/B be larger than<br>
3.8. Furthermore, when O/B exceeds 4.5, sensitivity is lowered.<br>
Therefore, it is preferable that O/Bbe 4.5 or less.<br>
As considered from the atomic ratio Bi/B, sensitivity is improved<br>
with increasing Bi amount, so that there is a tendency that archivability is<br>
deteriorated. Consequently, the composition containing too much Bi is not<br>
favorable. It becomes possible to improve archivability by increasing the<br>
quantity of oxygen even when the atomic ratio Bi/B is the same. That is,<br>
when the value of atomic ratio O/B is large, there is a tendency that<br><br>
archivability is improved. Furthermore, when the quantity of oxygen is too<br>
large, sensitivity is lowered. It is possible to increase sensitivity by<br>
increasing the quantity of Bi.<br>
Furthermore, when the Bi/B=Z is given at the atomic ratio, the case<br>
is preferable in which a relation of 0.8 x (Z+l) x 1.5
is established, For example, each of the characteristics of the specimens is<br>
shown in Table 3 from disc 1 through disc 5.<br><br>
Since the state of Bi, B and Bi2O3 and B2O3 is stable in an ideal state,<br>
the relation of 0=(Bi+B) x 1.5 is established. That is, 0/B=((Bi/B)+l) x<br>
1.5 is set. However, the composition of the actual film depends on the state<br>
of the target, the property of being easily sputtered in respective elements, an<br>
electric power at the time of the film formation, and the flow rate of argon.<br>
There are many cases in which the target composition and the composition<br>
of the formed film are different. It is required to consider the shift of the<br>
composition. Table 4 shows the composition of various Bi-B-0 target and<br>
the composition of the formed Bi-B-O film which is formed at the target.<br><br><br>
As shown above, it is required to consider a shift in composition<br>
resulting from a difference in the condition at the time of the film formation.<br>
As a result of the investigation of the composition of the atomic ratio of<br>
various Bi/B, it has been made clear that the case in which the relation of the<br>
aforementioned equation is set is most preferable in consideration of the<br>
shift in composition from the ideal state of O/B. This consequence is<br>
shown in Table 3. When an ideal value of the atomic ratio of O/B, namely<br>
0/B=((Bi/B)+l) x 1.5 is determined from the measured value of the atomic<br>
ratio of Bi/B from the disc 1 to disc 5, values in the table are provided.<br>
When a disuniformity in values are seen by comparing this value with the<br>
value of the atomic ratio of O/B which is a measured value, the values exists<br>
within the scope between an ideal atomic ratio of O/B x 0.8 and an ideal<br>
atomic ratio of O/B x 1.1. Consequently, the composition scope in which<br>
this relation is set is preferable. From disk 1 to disk 5, the property is<br>
favorable. What corresponds to the scope of the aforementioned equation<br>
ranges from disk 1 to disk 4. The jitter values on all the disks from disk 1 to<br><br>
disk 5 assume a value within the scope of 4 to 6 with the result that a<br>
favorable property is shown. It is shown that when the optimum record<br>
power is high, the sensitivity is inferior; when the optimum power is low, the<br>
sensitivity is high. With respect to disk 5, the sensitivity is the highest.<br>
When numbers are attached thereto in an order from the highest<br>
archiavability to the lowest, the results shown in Table 3 is given.<br>
Furthermore, when the reproduction optical deterioration endurance is<br>
observed, the disk 5 is the worst. When all the disks are generally observed,<br>
the scope from the disk 1 to the disk 4 is the most favorable. The disks 1<br>
through 5 are prepared in the same manner as those in Examples 13 through<br>
20 which will be described later.<br>
According to a sixteenth aspect of the present invention, a<br>
recordable optical recording medium excellent in the recording<br>
characteristics and archivability can be provided by setting the atomic ratio<br>
of O to B in the recording layer to 2.2≤O/B≤13.<br>
According to a seventeenth aspect of the present invention, the<br>
invention relates to a recordable optical recording medium wherein the<br>
proportion of O in the total amount of elements constituting the recording<br>
layer is set to the scope of 50% to 67% at the atomic ratio. It is preferable<br>
that the scope of 50% to 60% in which the quantity of oxygen is on the<br>
smaller side. These facts are apparent from the fact shown in Example 26.<br>
It is thought that the recording layer is in the state of oxygen deficiency in<br><br>
the scope in which the quantity of oxygen is small, particularly in the scope<br>
of less than 60%. In the state of oxygen deficiency, the phase separation is<br>
likely to occur with the result that the recording sensitivity is improved.<br>
Furthermore, the heat conductivity of the recording layer is lowered when<br>
the quantity of oxygen becomes too small because heat tends to expand,<br>
with the result that a small recording mark is formed with difficulty which is<br>
unfavorable for high density recording. In addition, when oxygen is<br>
deficient, Bi is likely to exist in the metal state. Thus, the state becomes<br>
unstable as compared with oxide. Consequently, there is a tendency that<br>
the archiavability becomes worse. In the scope from 50% to 60%, it is<br>
thought that there is almost no problem. When the quantity of oxygen<br>
increases, the archiavability becomes favorable. However, the sensitivity<br>
becomes worse with the result that a favorable recording becomes difficult.<br>
That is, from the aspect of the sensitivity, the case in which the quantity of<br>
oxygen is smaller than 67% is preferable.<br>
According to the seventeenth aspect of the present invention, a<br>
recordable optical recording medium excellent in the recording<br>
characteristics and the archiavability can be provided by optimizing the<br>
occupation ratio of O in the all the quantity of elements constituting the<br>
recording layer.<br>
According to an eighteenth aspect of the present invention, the<br>
invention relates to a recordable optical recording medium provided with a<br><br>
protection layer positioned adjacent to the both surfaces of the recording<br>
layer. Since the recording layer is an oxide, the incoming and outgoing of<br>
oxygen affect the property. In order to suppress the incoming and the<br>
outgoing of oxygen, an attempt can be made to improve the archiavability by<br>
providing a protection layer on both surfaces of the recording layer. As a<br>
protection layer, normally a material is preferable which does not causes<br>
decomposition, sublimation, voids or the like due to heat from the recording<br>
layer during recording. For example, simple oxide type oxides such as<br>
A12O3, MgO, ZrO2, SiO2, SnO2, ZnO, Sm2O3 or the like, and a combination<br>
of these oxides, nitrides such as silicon nitride, aluminum nitride, nitrides of<br>
B and Ti, and the like, carbon-based non-oxides such as SiC, B4C, TiC, WC<br>
and the like, borides such as LaB6 TiB2, ZrB2 and the like, sulfides such as<br>
ZnS, CdS, MoS2, silicides such as MoSi2, amorphous carbon, graphite,<br>
diamond and the like can be used. Furthermore, it is also possible to use<br>
organic materials.<br>
For example, from the viewpoint of the transparency and the<br>
productivity with respect to the recording and reproduction light, the fact<br>
that SiO2 or ZnS-SiO2 are used as main components is cited as a favorable<br>
example. In addition, in order to obtain a sufficient heat insulation effect, it<br>
is preferable to use ZrO2 mainly (as a main component). In addition, since<br>
the stability is high, silion nitrides, aluminum nitrides and aluminum oxides<br>
are also preferable. Furthermore, an oxide comprising ZnS, ZrO2, Y2O3,<br><br>
and SiO2 or an oxide comprising ZrO2, TiO2, SiO2 and X (where X is at least<br>
one species selected from Y2O3, CeO, A12O3 MgO, Nb2O5 and rare earth<br>
oxides) is preferable. Here, the main component refers to approximately<br>
90% or more approximately in terms of the mol ratio. For example, with<br>
respect to ZnS-SiO2, the film can be formed by means of a direct current<br>
sputtering by allowing the material to have conductivity by adding carbon<br>
and transparent conductive material. In addition, such method of adding<br>
ZnO, GeO or the like and mixing oxide and nitride can be used for the<br>
adjustment of heat conductivity.<br>
As a preferable layer structure, in the case of the structure of the<br>
so-call HD DVD or the like for applying light through a substrate from the<br>
side of the substrate, a layer structure can be cited wherein on the substrate a<br>
protection layer (referred to as a first protection layer), a recording layer, a<br>
protection layer (referred to as a second protection layer) and reflection layer<br>
are formed in this order. Furthermore, in the case of Blu-ray disc or the like,<br>
a structure which comprises a substrate, a reflection layer, a protection layer<br>
(a second protection layer), a recording layer, a protection layer (a first<br>
protection layer) and a cover layer in this order is preferable. In addition, in<br>
the case where data items are recorded by using near-field light, a relatively<br>
hard layer with a high index of refraction such as a silicon nitride, a diamond<br>
carbon or the like is provided on the outermost surface on the side on which<br>
light is incident. A layer structure which comprises a substrate, a reflection<br><br>
layer, a protection layer (a second protection layer), a recording layer, and a<br>
protection layer (a first protection layer) is preferable. Preferably a<br>
lubricant layer is provided on the outermost surface.<br>
According to an eighteenth aspect of the present invention, a<br>
recordable optical recording medium excellent in the recording<br>
characteristics and archiavability can be provided by using a configuration in<br>
which a protection layer is adjacent to both surfaces of the recording layer.<br>
According to a nineteenth aspect of the present invention, the<br>
invention relates to a recordable optical recording medium wherein the<br>
protection layer contains as a main component ZnS-SiO2, silicon nitride, or<br>
aluminum oxide. Using as the protection layer ZnS-SiO2, a silicon nitride,<br>
or an aluminum oxide provides a large effect of preventing the incoming and<br>
the outgoing of oxygen and moisture and a large effect of improving<br>
archiavability. Furthermore, with respect to ZnS-SiO2, preferably a stress<br>
of the film becomes approximately zero when the ratio of ZnS to SiO2 is set<br>
to 80mol%: 20mol%. In particular, the optical recording medium having a<br>
layer structure wherein a film is formed only on one surface of the substrate<br>
such as a BD-R or the like is not preferable because the substrate is bent<br>
when a stress applied on the film is large. In addition, in a mutually<br>
deposited type optical recording medium such as HD-R or the like as well<br>
the fact that the stress is small means that the peeling off of the film is caused<br>
with difficulty and archivability is excellent and such recording medium is<br><br>
preferable.<br>
According to a nineteenth aspect of the present invention, a<br>
recordable optical recording medium can be provided which is excellent in<br>
the recording characteristics and archiavability, by allowing the protection<br>
layer to contain as a main component, ZnS-SiO2, silicon nitride or aluminum<br>
oxide.<br>
According to a twentieth aspect of the present invention, the<br>
invention relates to an optical recordable recording medium wherein at least<br>
a first protection layer, a recording layer, a second protection layer, a<br>
reflection layer are sequentially provided on the substrate, the first protection<br>
layer comprising aluminum oxide, the second protection layer comprising<br>
ZnS-SiO2. The first protection layer serves to protect the recording layer<br>
from oxygen and moisture which come in and go out through the substrate.<br>
The archiavability can be improved by sandwiching the recording layer with<br>
the first protection layer and the second protection layer. For the<br>
coexistence of the recording characteristics and the archiavability, providing<br>
a protection layer using an aluminum oxide on the substrate side of the<br>
recording layer, and providing a protection layer comprising ZnS-SiO2 on the<br>
opposite side thereof enables providing optically and thermally an optimum<br>
condition which provides favorable characteristics.<br>
According to a twentieth aspect of the present invention, a<br>
recordable optical recording medium can be provided which is excellent in<br><br>
recording characteristics and archiavability by providing a layer structure in<br>
which at least a first protection layer, a recording layer, a second protection<br>
layer, and a reflection layer are sequentially deposited on the substrate, the<br>
first protection layer comprising an aluminum oxide, the second protection<br>
layer comprising ZnS-SiO2.<br>
According to a twenty-first aspect of the present invention, the<br>
invention relates to a recordable optical recording medium wherein at least a<br>
reflection layer, a second protection layer, a recording layer, a first protection<br>
layer and a cover layer are sequentially deposited, the second protection<br>
layer comprising a silicon nitride, the first protection layer comprising<br>
ZnS-SiO2. As a protection layer on the side of the reflection layer of the<br>
recording layer, silicon nitride is provided. As a protection layer on the<br>
opposite side, ZnS-SiO2 is provided with the result that a recordable optical<br>
recording medium can be realized which shows favorable recording<br>
characteristics and archiavability. Silicon nitride prevents oxygen and<br>
moisture and has a relatively large thermal conductivity with the result that<br>
heat generated at the time of the recording on the recording layer can be<br>
immediately dissipated to the reflection layer. The silicon nitride allows<br>
heat to reside and expand in the recording layer thereby serving to prevent<br>
the generation of troubles in the formation of small recording marks.<br>
Furthermore, ZnS-SiO2 prevents incoming in and outgoing of oxygen and<br>
moisture while serving to prevent the deformation to the side of the cover<br><br>
layer. When the thermal conductivity is too high, the recording becomes<br>
insufficient. Thus, ZnS-SiO2 is preferable which has a relatively low<br>
thermal conductivity.<br>
As to the material of the substrate, there is no particular limitation<br>
thereto as long as the material has thermally and mechanically excellent<br>
property and has an excellent light transmitting property in the case where<br>
recording and reproduction is conducted from the side of the substrate<br>
(through the substrate).<br>
Specific examples include polycarbonate, polymethylmethacrylate,<br>
amorphous polyolefin, cellulose acetate, and polyethylene terephthalate.<br>
However, polycarbonate and amorphous polyolefin are preferable. The<br>
thickness of the substrate differs depending on the usage thereof. There is<br>
no particular limitation thereto.<br>
As a material of the reflection layer, a material having a sufficiently<br>
high reflectance at a wavelength of the reproduction light can be used. For<br>
example, metals such as Au, Al, Ag, Cu, Ti, Cr, Ni, Pt, Ta, Pd and the like<br>
can be used as a single metal or an alloy thereof can be used. Among such<br>
metals, Au, Al and Ag have high reflectance and are appropriate as a<br>
reflective material. Furthermore, the material may contain other elements<br>
while containing the aforementioned metals as a main component. Other<br>
elements include metals and half metals such as Mg, Se. Hf, V, Nb, Ru, W,<br>
Mn, Re, Fe, Co, Rh, Ir, Zn, Cd, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Te, Pb, Po, Sn, Bi and the like.<br><br>
Among such metals and half metals, the material containing as a main<br>
component Ag are particularly preferable from the viewpoint of low cost<br>
and high reflectance. A low diffraction layer and a high diffraction layer are<br>
alternately deposited to each other with materials other than the metal to<br>
form a multi-layer film which can be also used as a reflection layer. For<br>
example, a method for forming the reflection layer includes a sputtering<br>
method, an ion plating method, a chemical vapor deposition method, and a<br>
vacuum vapor deposition method. A preferable thickness of the reflection<br>
layer is 20nm to 300nm.<br>
In addition, for the improvement of reflectance, the improvement of<br>
the recording characteristics, the improvement of the adhesiveness or the<br>
like, a known inorganic species or an organic species an upper coating layer,<br>
a lower coating layer or an adherent layer can be provided on the substrate or<br>
beneath the reflection layer.<br>
A material of an environment endurance protection layer which is<br>
formed on the reflection layer and an interference layer is not particularly<br>
limited as long as the protection layer serves to protect the reflection layer<br>
and the interference layer from an external force. Organic materials include<br>
thermoplastic resins, thermosetting resins, electron beam curable resins, and<br>
UV curable resins. In addition, inorganic materials include SiO2, SiN4,<br>
MgF2, and SnO2. The thermoplastic resin and the thermosetting resin can<br>
be formed by coating and drying a coating liquid which is dissolved in an<br><br>
appropriate solvent. The UV curable resin can be formed by coating a<br>
coating liquid as it is or a coating liquid which is dissolved in a solvent and<br>
applying UV light thereto to cure the resin. The UV curable resin includes<br>
acrylic resins such as urethane acrylate, epoxyacrylate, polyester acrylate or<br>
the like. These materials may be used singly or in combination. Instead of<br>
a single layer, a multi-layer may be formed. As a method for forming the<br>
protection layer, a coating method such as a spin coat method, a cast method<br>
or the like, a sputtering method, and a chemical vapor deposition method<br>
can be used as with the recording layer. Among such methods, the spin coat<br>
method is preferable. The thickness thereof is generally within the range of<br>
O.lµm to 100µm. In the present invention, the range of 3µm to 30µm is<br>
preferable.<br>
In addition, a substrate may be further bonded to the surface of the<br>
reflection layer or the interference layer. In addition, the reflection layer<br>
and the interference layer surface are allowed to be located opposite to each<br>
other with the surfaces thereof being set as inner surfaces with the result that<br>
two optical recording media may be deposited to each other. On the mirror<br>
finished surface of the substrate, a UV curable resin layer, an inorganic layer<br>
may be formed for the surface protection and the prevention of the sticking<br>
of dusts or the like.<br>
The cover layer becomes necessary in the case where a lens with a<br>
high NA is used in an attempt of increasing recording density. For example,<br><br>
when the NA is heightened, it is required to reduce the thickness of a portion<br>
which allows the penetration of the reproduction light. This is because<br>
along with the heightening of the NA an allowed quantity of an aberration<br>
decreases which is generated with an angle (which is proportional to a<br>
square of a product of a so-called tilt angle, a reverse number of a<br>
wavelength of the light source, a numeric aperture of an object lens) at<br>
which the disc surface is shifted from a vertical direction with respect to a<br>
light axis of an optical pickup. This is also because the tilt angle tends to be<br>
affected by an aberration resulting from a thickness of the substrate.<br>
Consequently, the thickness of the substrate is reduced so that the influence<br>
of the aberration with respect to the tilt angle is reduced as much as possible.<br>
Therefore, there is proposed an optical recording medium wherein<br>
dents and projections are formed, for example, on the substrate to form a<br>
recording layer, a reflection layer is provided on the recording layer followed<br>
by providing a light penetration cover layer which allows the penetration of<br>
light on the reflection layer with the result that information on the recording<br>
layer is reproduced by applying reproduction light from the side of the cover<br>
layer; and there is provided an optical recording medium, a recording layer is<br>
formed thereon, and an optically transparent cover layer is provided therein,<br>
wherein the information in the recording layer is reproduced by applying<br>
reproduction light from the side of the cover layer.<br>
By means of such procedure, it is possible to achieve an increased<br><br>
NA of the object lens by thinning the cover layer. That is, it is possible to<br>
achieve a further increase in the recording density by providing a thin cover<br>
layer and by conducting recording and reproduction from the side of the<br>
cover layer.<br>
Incidentally, such a cover layer is generally formed of polycarbonate<br>
sheet and UV curable resin. Furthermore, the cover layer according to the<br>
present invention may include a layer for bonding the cover layer.<br>
According to a twenty-first aspect of the present invention, a<br>
recordable optical recording medium can be provided which is excellent in<br>
the recording characteristics and archiavability by providing a layer structure<br>
in which at least a reflection layer, a second protection layer, a recording<br>
layer, a first protection layer, and a cover layer are sequentially provided on<br>
the substrate, the second protection layer comprising silicon nitride, the first<br>
protection layer comprising ZnS-SiO2.<br>
According to a twenty-second aspect of the present invention, the<br>
invention relates to a recordable optical recording medium wherein the<br>
reflection layer comprises Al alloy. In particular, when the layer structure is<br>
formed in such a manner that the reflection layer and ZnS-SiO2 layer are<br>
located adjacent to each other, Al alloy is preferable for preventing the<br>
deterioration of the reflection layer. The reflection layer preferably<br>
comprises Ag or an Ag alloy in many cases. Although the Al alloy is<br>
inferior to Ag, the Al alloy has a high thermal conductivity and a high<br><br>
reflectance which means that the Al alloy shows a favorable property. Since<br>
Ag has a high thermal conductivity, there is a tendency that the sensitivity<br>
becomes worse. Furthermore, there is also a tendency that the reflectance<br>
also becomes too high, Al alloy is preferable. For example, in the case<br>
where the reflection layer is Ag-In alloy in an optical recording medium<br>
which has a layer structure comprising a cover layer/ a ZnS-SiO2 (10nm)/ a<br>
Bi-B-0 (16nm)/SiN (12nm)/ a reflection layer (35nm)/ a polycarbonate<br>
substrate, the jitter value is 5.8%. However, in the case where AlTi alloy is<br>
used, the jitter value is 5.2%. Since the Al alloy has a higher sensitivity and<br>
the recording characteristics is favorable, the Al alloy is more preferable.<br>
According to a twenty-second aspect of the present invention, a<br>
recordable optical recording medium excellent in the recording<br>
characteristics and archiavability can be provided by limiting the material of<br>
the reflection layer.<br>
According to a twenty-third aspect of the present invention, the<br>
invention relates to a recordable optical recording medium wherein at least a<br>
first protection layer, a recording layer, a second protection layer, and a<br>
reflection layer are sequentially deposited on the substrate, the thickness of<br>
the first protection layer being set to 10nm to 80nm, the thickness of the<br>
recording layer being set to 6nm to 30nm, the thickness of the second<br>
protection layer being set to 8nm to 35nm, the thickness of the reflection<br>
layer being set to 20nm to 100nm. When the thickness of the fist protection<br><br>
layer is not 10nm or more, moisture or oxygen comes in and goes out from<br>
the recording layer through the substrate with the result that archivability is<br>
deteriorated. Furthermore, the sensitivity is improved with an increase in<br>
the thickness thereof. However, when the thickness exceeds 80nm, the<br>
heat radiation becomes worse; the recording mark is widened with the result<br>
that the recording characteristics is deteriorated. With respect to the<br>
recording layer, when the thickness becomes thinner than 6nm, the<br>
sensitivity is deteriorated, and the recording characteristics such as PRSNR<br>
or the like is also deteriorated. When the thickness exceeds 30nm, the<br>
reflection is lowered. Although the sensitivity is improved, the recording<br>
characteristics is deteriorated. When the second protection becomes<br>
thinner than 8nm, the reflection layer is located at a nearer place with the<br>
result that the heat radiation is increased too much and the sensitivity is<br>
deteriorated. In an area thicker than 35nm, the heat radiation becomes<br>
worse and the recording mark is widened. When the reflection layer<br>
becomes thinner than 20nm, the reflectance is lowered and the tracking or<br>
the like becomes precarious. When the thickness becomes thicker than<br>
100nm, the sensitivity becomes worse and the recording characteristics is<br>
deteriorated.<br>
According to a twenty-fourth aspect of the present invention, the<br>
invention related to a recordable optical recording medium wherein at least a<br>
reflection layer, a second protection layer, a recording layer, a first protection<br><br>
layer, and a cover layer are sequentially deposited on the substrate, the<br>
thickness of the first protection layer being set to 7nm to 30nm, the thickness<br>
of the recording layer being set to 6nm to 30nm, the thickness of the second<br>
protection layer being set to 5nm to 30nm, the thickness of the reflection<br>
layer being set to 30nm to 80nm. It has been found that the storage property<br>
is deteriorated in the case where the first protection layer is thinner than 7nm.<br>
When the first protection layer is thicker than 30nm, the heat radiation, and<br>
the recording characteristics becomes worse becomes worse because marks<br>
tend to expand. When the first protection layer is thinner than 6nm, the<br>
sensitivity becomes worse, and the recording characteristics such as PRSNR<br>
or the like also becomes worse. When the thickness of the recording layer<br>
becomes thicker than 30nm, the reflectance is also lowered. Although the<br>
sensitivity of the recording layer is improved, the recording characteristics is<br>
deteriorated. When the second protection layer becomes thinner than 5nm,<br>
the reflection layer is located at a nearer place with the result that the heat<br>
radiation is too good and the sensitivity is deteriorated. When the second<br>
protection layer becomes thicker than 30nm, the heat radiation becomes<br>
worse, and the recording mark is widened. When the reflection layer<br>
becomes thinner than 30nm, the heat radiation effect becomes insufficient<br>
with the result that the jitter values rise and the recording characteristics is<br>
deteriorated. When the reflection layer becomes thicker than 80nm, the<br>
reflectance becomes worse and the recording characteristics is deteriorated.<br><br>
According the twenty-third and the twenty fourth aspect of the<br>
present invention, a recordable optical recording medium can be provided<br>
which is excellent in the recording characteristics and the archiavability by<br>
optimizing the thickness of each layer.<br>
According to a twenty-fifth aspect of the present invention, the<br>
invention relates to a recordable optical recording medium wherein a<br>
recording layer containing Bi, B and O comprises an oxide which is in the<br>
state of oxygen deficiency in which oxygen is smaller in quantity than the<br>
stoichiometric composition. Stoichiometry refers to a theory showing a<br>
quantitative relation of elements in chemical reactions used in the world of<br>
chemistry. Here, stoichiometric composition is defined in the following<br>
manner. Stoichiometry refers to a composition of elements of compounds<br>
which can be formed by stable compounds which each of the constituent<br>
elements constitute. For example, here, it is defined that a composition<br>
which compounds such as Bi2O3, B2O3, Bi4B2O9 which exist in a stable state<br>
at a normal temperature and at a normal pressure will be referred to as a<br>
stoichiometric composition. The oxygen deficiency state in which oxygen<br>
is small in quantity than the stoichiometric composition refers to a case in<br>
which x 
case where there is no state of oxygen deficiency, BiO1.5 is provided. In the<br>
same manner, BiO1.45Bi4B2O8.9 shows a state of oxygen deficiency. In other<br>
words, it can be judged there is no state of oxygen deficiency when Bi exists<br><br>
in the trivalent state. It can be said that there is a state of oxygen deficiency<br>
when the monovalent state or the bivalent state is included. The same thing<br>
holds true for other elements. A state of a mixture thereof, or a state of a<br>
single element which is not an oxide, and a state mixed with the oxide are<br>
also included in the present invention. When the oxide in the state of<br>
oxygen deficiency exists, the oxide either captures oxygen from the outside,<br>
or separates in phase with the result that the oxide will change to a stable<br>
state. When BiO1.45 exists, the phase separation into two phases; Bi2O3 and<br>
Bi is stable. In the state in which the recording layer is sandwiched between<br>
the protective layers to be shielded from the outside, a recording light is<br>
applied and a temperature rises so that the recording layer in the state of<br>
oxygen deficiency is separated in phase, Bi metal is deposited and condensed<br>
to form a recording mark. In the state with no state of oxygen deficiency, or<br>
the state of an excessive quantity of oxygen, the phase separation occurs<br>
with difficulty, and the sensitivity becomes worse with the result that a<br>
favorable recording becomes difficult. In this manner, including oxygen in<br>
the state of oxide deficiency in which oxide is smaller in quantity than the<br>
stoichiometric composition provides a large effect. As a state in which the<br>
recording layer is constituted, any of the following states may be preferably<br>
taken; the state of comprising only oxides in the state of oxygen deficiency,<br>
the state of a mixture of an oxide in the state of oxygen deficiency and an<br>
oxide which is not in the state of oxygen deficiency, or the state of the<br><br>
mixture of oxide in the state of oxygen deficiency and a single element, and<br>
the state of a mixture of an oxide in the state of oxygen deficiency, an oxide<br>
which is not in the state of oxygen deficiency, and a single element.<br>
According to a twenty-fifth aspect of the present invention, a<br>
recordable optical recording medium excellent in the recording<br>
characteristics and the archiavability can be provided by the fact that the<br>
recording layer containing Bi, B and O including an oxide in the state of<br>
oxygen deficiency in which oxygen is smaller in quantity than the<br>
stoichiometric composition.<br>
According to a twenty-sixth aspect of the present invention, the<br>
invention relates to a recordable optical recording medium wherein the<br>
recording layer containing Bi, B and O includes Bi oxide which is in the state<br>
of oxygen deficiency in which oxygen is smaller in quantity than the<br>
stoichiometric composition. Since Bi is likely to be reduced, Bi is likely to<br>
be separated in phase with the result that Bi is preferable for the formation of<br>
the recording mark. It is preferable that the proportion of Bi oxide which is<br>
in the state of oxygen deficiency be 50% to 80% in the total amount of<br>
existing Bi. When the proportion is approximately 100%, an effect is<br>
provided. A judgment on the state of oxygen deficiency can be made by<br>
measuring a vicinity of the energy area of Bi4f in the measurement by<br>
means of the X-ray photoelectron spectral analysis (XPS). For example, an<br>
element in the trivalent state of Bi is considered to be Bi2O3. It can be said<br><br>
that the state is free from the oxygen deficiency. In the case where Bi is<br>
bivalent, it can be considered that there is a state of oxygen deficiency<br>
according to the present invention in the state, the metal state of Bi can be<br>
measured. Since the present invention has the same effect when only two<br>
kinds of the state of single element of Bi and the Bi oxide exist which is not<br>
in the state of oxygen deficiency in which oxygen is smaller in quantity than<br>
the stoichiometric composition such as Bi2O3 or the like, such states can be<br>
included in the present invention.<br>
According to the twenty-sixth aspect of the present invention, a<br>
recordable optical recording medium excellent in the recording<br>
characteristics and the archiavability can be provided by the fact that the<br>
recording layer containing Bi, B and O includes Bi oxide in the state of<br>
oxygen deficiency in which oxygen is smaller in quantity than the<br>
stoichiometric composition.<br>
According to a twenty-seventh aspect of the present invention, the<br>
invention relates to a recordable optical recording medium wherein a<br>
recording mark recorded by light application includes a single element<br>
which is not an oxide. Although the details are not clear, the following<br>
point can be considered as a formation principle of the recording mark.<br>
The recording layer containing elements of Bi, B and O is thought to be in<br>
either of the states; the state in which the recording layer exists all in the<br>
state of oxides in unrecorded state, or the state in which the single state of<br><br>
respective elements excluding oxygen and the state of oxides are mixed. In<br>
the case of this state, the temperature of the recording layer rises when light<br>
is applied at the recording time with the result that the stability of the film<br>
constituting the recording layer decreases. The state of oxide free from the<br>
oxygen deficiency at that time has a high stability so that recording cannot be<br>
conducted in a favorable manner. However, when the unrecorded state<br>
exists in the state of oxygen deficiency, the state is changed to a stable state<br>
by applying recording light. Changing from the state of oxygen deficiency<br>
to a state of mixture of oxide free from oxygen deficiency and a single<br>
element facilitates the formation of recording marks. With respect to this<br>
recording mark, a difference in the optical property with the unrecorded<br>
portion is enlarged by the deposition of the single element thereby enabling<br>
enlarging a difference in the reflectance. As a consequence, the amplitude<br>
of a reproduction signal is enlarged and a more favorable property can be<br>
shown. Furthermore, in the case where the single element and the oxide<br>
exist in the unrecorded state, a rise in the temperature of the recording layer<br>
by the application of the recording light allows the oxide to separate oxygen<br>
with the result that a form of a single element can be provided. At a portion<br>
where the recording light is applied, the oxide decreases and the single<br>
element increases. Alternately, the oxide and the single element are<br>
respectively condensed with the result that a phase separation-like state is<br>
realized. In the state in which fine single elements are mixed in the oxide,<br><br>
recording light is applied with the result that there is provided a state in<br>
which the single element is grown and the single element is condensed in the<br>
oxide and is distributed. This provides a recording mark. With respect to<br>
the recording mark, a difference in the optical property with the unrecorded<br>
portion is enlarged by the deposition of the single element thereby enabling<br>
enlarging a difference in the reflectance. As a consequence, the amplitude<br>
of a reproduction signal is enlarged and a more favorable property can be<br>
shown. In particular, it is preferable that the Bi oxide easily separates<br>
oxygen. It is preferable that in the unrecorded state, the Bi oxide exists in<br>
the state of oxygen deficiency, and application of the recording light serve to<br>
separate in phase the single element of Bi and exists in the recording mark<br>
with the result that the recording mark is formed. In addition, it is also<br>
preferable in the non-recorded state that fine Bi exist as a single entity mixed<br>
with an oxide thereof, and recording marks are formed in such a manner that<br>
Bi is grown and is deposited. It is also preferable that the other oxides be<br>
deposited, and recording marks are formed in the mixed state.<br>
According to the twenty-seventh aspect of the present invention, a<br>
recordable optical recording medium excellent in the recording<br>
characteristics and the archiavability by the fact that the recording mark<br>
recorded by light application includes a single element which is not an oxide.<br>
According to a twenty-eighth aspect of the present invention, the<br>
invention relates to a recordable optical recording medium wherein the<br><br>
recording mark recorded by light application does not show any distinct<br>
crystal structures. Optical recording is made by means of the change in the<br>
optical property such as deformation, a change in a crystal structure or the<br>
like in many cases. However, the present invention is characterized by the<br>
fact that the recording mark does not show any distinct crystal structures,<br>
but is amorphous as determined by X-ray diffraction in the same manner as<br>
the unrecorded state. When the crystal structure of the recording mark is<br>
measured by X-ray diffraction, a crystal peak is not measured and is<br>
amorphous. Although we can only speculate the cause of the crystal<br>
structure in the recording mark, the absence of distinct crystal structures<br>
may enable suppressing of the deformation of the portion of the recording<br>
mark to provide favorable characteristics.<br>
According to the twenty-eighth aspect of the present invention, a<br>
recordable optical recording medium excellent in the recording<br>
characteristics and the archiavability can be provided by the fact that the<br>
recording marks recorded by light application show no distinct crystal<br>
structures<br>
As has been described above, according to the fifteenth to the<br>
twenty-eighth aspects of the present invention, there can be provided a<br>
recordable optical recording medium having excellent recording<br>
characteristics and archivability, in particular, an excellent recordable<br>
optical recording medium which conforms to the HD DVD-R standard, or<br><br>
the BD-R standard.<br>
Examples<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be further specifically<br>
explained with reference to Examples and Comparative Examples.<br>
However, the present invention is not limited by these Examples<br>
(Examples 1 and 2)<br>
Powders of Bi2O3 and B2O3 were weighed in the state free from<br>
moisture adsorption in such a manner that the atomic ratio of B to Bi was set<br>
to 2:1. After dry mixture with the ball mill for one hour, the powders were<br>
sintered for one hour at 420°C (Example 1). Furthermore, in a separate<br>
manner, while conducting a dry mixture for one hour with the ball mill, the<br>
powders were sintered for one hour at 420°C (Example 2). Next, a<br>
sputtering target was prepared by press molding the powders at 100MPa<br>
through 200MPa and sintering the powders for 5 hours at 600°C in the<br>
atmosphere.<br>
The target is formed into a disc-like configuration having a diameter<br>
of 200mm and a thickness of 6mm. These targets were bonded to<br>
oxygen-free copper-made backing plate by means of metal bonding to obtain<br>
sputtering targets 1 and 2. The packing density of these targets was 98%<br>
and 96%, respectively.<br>
(Examples 3 and 4)<br><br>
Recordable optical recording media according to Examples 3 and 4<br>
were prepared by using the sputtering targets 1 and 2 prepared in Examples 1<br>
and 2.<br>
On a polycarbonate substrate (product name: ST3000 manufactured<br>
by Teijin Bayer Polytec Co.Ltd.) having a guide groove (with a groove depth<br>
of 21nm, a groove width of 0.16□ m, and a track pitch of 0.32µm), by the<br>
sputtering method an AlTi alloy (Ti: 10 weight%) film having a thickness of<br>
35nm, a ZnS-SiO2 (80: 20 mol%) film having a thickness of 20nm, and a film<br>
(Bi-B-O film) having a thickness of 15nm and comprising Bi, B and oxygen<br>
were sequentially provided, followed by further laminating thereon a<br>
polycarbonate sheet (manufactured by Teijin Kasei; Pure Ace) to a thickness<br>
of 75µm by using a UV curable resin (manufactured by Nippon Kayaku<br>
DVD0O3) to provide a light transmitting layer with the result that a<br>
recordable optical recording medium (an recordable optical recording<br>
medium that meets the requirement of the so-called Blu-ray standard)<br>
according to the present invention was prepared to a thickness of about<br>
1.2mm.<br>
With respect to these recordable optical recording media, recording<br>
and reproduction are conducted from the side of the light transmitting layer<br>
by using an optical disc evaluation device DDU-1000 (wavelength: 405nm,<br>
NA: 0.85) manufactured by Pulstec Industrial Co., Ltd. to measure jitters at<br>
that time. Example 3 showed a jitter of 5.8%, and Example 4 showed a<br><br>
jitter of 5.9%. These values were favorable. The recording conditions<br>
were given as follows. The reproduction power was set to 0.2mW.<br>
0 Modulation method: 1-7 modulation<br>
□	Recording linear density: shortest mark length 2T=0.149 (µm)<br>
□	Recording linear velocity: 4.9 (m/s)<br>
□	Waveform equalization: limit equalizer<br>
□	Recording power: 6.1mW<br>
(Example 5)<br>
Powders of Bi and B were mixed by wet method for one hour with a<br>
ball mill in such a manner that the atomic ratio thereof became 2 to 1<br>
followed by sintering the powders for eight hours at 250°C in the atmosphere<br>
while pressing and molding the powders at 100 to 200MP with the result that<br>
a sputtering target was prepared by means of hot pressing.<br>
The target was formed into a disc-like configuration having a<br>
diameter of 200mm and a thickness of 6mm. This target was bonded to a<br>
packing plate made of oxygen-free copper by means of metal bonding to<br>
obtain a sputtering target 3. The packing density of this target was 96%.<br>
(Example 6)<br>
Except for the fact that the Bi-B-0 film was prepared in the midst of<br>
mixed gas of argon and oxygen (Ar: oxygen =40:6; by volume) by using a<br>
sputtering target 3 which was prepared in Example 5, a recordable optical<br>
recording medium was prepared in the same manner as Example 3 and<br><br>
jitters were measured to show 4.8%, which was favorable.<br>
(Example 7)<br>
Except for the fact that the atomic ratio of Bi: B in Bi2O3, and B2O3<br>
were changed, the sputtering targets 4 through 10 were prepared in the same<br>
manner as that in Example 1. Except for the fact that the recording layer<br>
was formed into a film by using these targets, the recordable optical<br>
recording medium was prepared in the same manner as that in Example 3.<br>
The result of jitter measurement by conducting recording reproduction is<br>
shown in FIG. 1. Incidentally, the atomic ratio of Bi/B at each point and<br>
jitters (%) in FIG. 1 are shown in Table 5.<br><br><br>
From FIG 1, it can be seen that favorable jitters can be obtained<br>
within the range of 0.6≤Bi/B≤7.0.<br>
(Example 8)<br>
Except for the fact that the sintering conditions were changed, the<br>
sputtering target was prepared in the same manner as that in Example 1, the<br>
packing density, the validity of the preparation, and the film deposition rate<br>
for the sputtering target (the film was formed with the sputtering device<br>
(DVD Sprinter) manufactured by the Unaxis Co. Ltd.) are shown in Table 6.<br>
The DVD Sprinter is used for manufacture of optical recording media.<br>
As can be seen from Table 6, in the case where the packing density is<br>
50% or less, the material is fragile, and the target could not be prepared.<br>
Furthermore, in the case where packing density was 64%, the target was<br>
successfully prepared, but the film deposition rate was insufficient. When<br>
power applied at the time of film deposition was increased, the film<br><br>
deposition rate was improved. However, the target was damaged with the<br>
result that a sufficient film deposition rate was not obtained. In contrast, it<br>
succeeded in obtaining a sufficient film deposition rate in the case where<br>
packing density was 72%.<br><br>
(Example 9)<br>
Powders of Bi2O3 and B were weighed in such a manner that the<br>
atomic ratio of Bi and B were set to 3:1 and the powders are wetted and<br>
mixed with a ball mill for one hour followed by sintering the powders for<br>
eight hours at 420°C in the atmosphere while pressing and molding the<br>
powders at 100 MPa to 200MPa and hot pressing the powders to prepare a<br>
sputtering target. The sputtering target is formed in a disc-like<br>
configuration in such a manner that the diameter is 200mm and the<br>
thickness is 6mm. This target is bonded to a packing plate made of<br>
oxygen-free copper with metal bonding to obtain a sputtering target 11. The<br><br>
packing density of this target was 98%. The present Example corresponds<br>
to a case in which oxygen is smaller in quantity than the stoichiometric<br>
composition.<br>
(Example 10)<br>
Except for the fact that a sputtering target 11 prepared in Example 9<br>
was used to prepare a Bi-B-O film in the midst of mixed gas of argon and<br>
oxygen (Ar: oxygen: 20: 1; by volume), a recordable optical recording<br>
medium was prepared in the same manner as that of Example 3 and jitters<br>
are measured to show 5.1% which means that favorable characteristics can<br>
be obtained.<br>
(Example 11)<br>
Except for the fact that a step of subjecting the powders of Bi2O3 and<br>
B2O3 to vacuum drying for 24 hours at 150°C to remove moisture was added<br>
as a step before the weight measurement, the sputtering target 12 was<br>
prepared in the same step as that in Example 1. The vacuum degree at the<br>
time of vacuum drying was about 10Pa to 100OPa at which the vacuum<br>
drawing is conducted with a normal rotary pump. The packing density of<br>
this target was 99%.<br>
The recordable optical recording medium was prepared in the same<br>
manner as that in Example 3 by using the aforementioned sputtering target<br>
12 to conduct recording and reproduction with the result that jitters was<br>
measured to be 5.3%.<br><br>
(Example 12)<br>
An X-ray diffraction pattern of the sputtering target 12 prepared in<br>
Example 11 was measured. The measurement condition is shown in Table<br>
7. The measurement result is shown in FIG. 2.<br>
Retrieval was made for identifying the position of the diffraction<br>
peak obtained in this measurement to refer to known substance. The upper<br>
stage of FIG. 2 shows a diffraction pattern of the sputtering target 12 while<br>
the lower stage thereof shows with known data items a position where the<br>
diffraction peak of Bi4B2O9. For the X-ray diffraction a database is<br>
constructed which tells where the diffraction line of the known substance<br>
appears and the intensity of that diffraction line. Comparing the peaks of<br>
an analyte with those of the known substance makes it possible to identify<br>
the analyte. As a result of retrieval by means of comparison with the<br>
Bi4B2O9 data items shown in the lower stage and the measured data items<br>
shown in the upper stage, it was confirmed that almost all the peaks were the<br>
peaks for Bi4B2O9 and that this sputtering target primarily comprises Bi4B2O9<br>
compound.<br>
That is, as a result of the X-ray diffraction shown in FIG. 2, a distinct<br>
peak was detected and the peak was consistent with the peak position<br>
calculated at the time when it was supposed that a crystalline substance of<br>
Bi4B2O9 existed, it can be said that a crystal of Bi4B2O9 exists. Thus, it can be<br>
exemplified that the substance is preferable in the case where the target is<br><br>
crystalline.<br><br>
(Comparative Example 1)<br>
Bi2O3 and MoO3 are mixed at 70: 30 (mol ratio) and sintered, and a<br>
sputtering target having a diameter of 76.2mm and thickness of 4mm was<br>
prepared, followed by deposition of a film. BiMoO contains as main<br>
components Bi and Mo and oxygen. An applied power and an intensity of<br>
the target at that time were measured, and a result thereof is shown in Table<br>
8. A case in which the film was normally formed is shown by symbol O.<br>
On the other hand, a case in which the target was damaged is shown by<br>
symbol x.<br><br>
For a comparison purpose, data for an article obtained by mixing Bi2O3 and<br>
B2O3 powders in proportions of 2:1 followed by sintering are shown.<br><br>
(Example 13 through Example 22)<br>
On a polycarbonate substrate (product name: ST3000 manufactured<br>
by Teijin Bayer Polytec Co. Ltd.) having a thickness of 1.1mm and a<br>
diameter of 120mm and having a guide groove (with a groove depth of 21nm<br>
and a track pitch of 0.32pm) by sputtering, an AlTi alloy (Ti: 1.0 weight%)<br>
layer having a thickness of 35nm. a ZnS-SiO2 (80:20mol%) layer having a<br>
thickness of 10nm, a layer comprising Bi, B and O (a Bi-B-O layer) having<br>
a thickness of 16nm, a ZnS-SiO2 (80:20 mol%) layer having a thickness of<br>
10nm are sequentially provided followed by further depositing thereon a<br>
polycarbonate sheet (manufactured by Teijin Kasei; Pure Ace)having a<br>
thickness of 75µm by using a UV curable resin (manufactured by Nippon<br><br>
Kayaku DVD0O3) to form a light transparent layer with the result that a<br>
recordable optical recording medium of the present invention (a recordable<br>
optical recording medium corresponding to the standard of a so-called<br>
Blu-ray disc) was prepared.<br>
With respect to the recordable optical recording in a condition<br>
corresponding to the recordable Blu-ray disc standard (BD-R version<br>
l.l)medium according to Examples 13 through 22 in Tables 9 and 10,<br>
recording is conducted by using an optical disc evaluation device ODU-1000<br>
(wavelength: 405nm, NA: 0.85) manufactured by Pulse Tec Industries Co.<br>
Ltd. to evaluate jitter values.<br><br><br>
FIG. 3 shows evaluation results of Examples 13 through 17 and 21.<br>
Jitter values after conducting the storage test for 100 hours in the<br>
environment at temperature of 80°C and moisture of 85% and an increase<br>
amount of jitter value before and after the storage test are shown. At an<br>
atomic ratio of Bi/B=9, jitter values significantly increased. Incidentally, it<br>
is regulated that the standard values of jitters of BD-R were 6.5% or less.<br><br>
Up to the atomic ratio of at atomic ratio of Bi/B =8, the increase amount of<br>
jitter value was small and favorable characteristics are shown. Up to the<br>
atomic ratio of 0/B=12.7, favorable characteristics are shown, but the jitter<br>
value showed a significant increase at 14.2.<br>
FIG. 4 shows the results of Example 18 through Example 20 and 22.<br>
At the atomic ratio of Bi/B and the atomic ratio of O/B that shows at<br>
Example 22, jitter values significantly increased. In a composition in which<br>
the atomic ratio Bi/B was small, the difference in jitter value before and after<br>
the storage test became small.<br>
In addition, when the atomic ratio Bi/B is smaller than 0.8, the<br>
sensitivity tends to become relatively decrease, with the result that it is<br>
preferable that the atomic ratio Bi/B be 0.8 or more.<br>
(Example 23)<br>
On a polycarbonate substrate having a guide groove (with a groove<br>
depth of 26nm and a track pitch of 0.4µm), by the sputtering method a<br>
ZnS-SiO2 layer with a thickness of 15nm (ZnS:SiO2 = 80:20 mol%), a<br>
Bi-B-0 layer with a thickness of 15nm which serves as a recording layer,<br>
and a ZnS-SiO2 layer with a thickness of 20nm (ZnS: SiO2=80:20mol%) are<br>
sequentially deposited. As the Bi-B-0 layer, a layer having an atomic ratio<br>
of Bi/B of 7.9 and the atomic ratio O/B of 13.2 was used. Then, an AlTi<br>
alloy (Ti:1.0 weight%) layer was provided to a thickness of 40nm by the<br><br>
sputtering method, and an organic protection layer comprising an UV<br>
curable resin (manufactured by San Nopco Co., Ltd.: Nopco Cure 134) was<br>
provided to a thickness to about 5 µm on the AlTi alloy layer by spin coating<br>
followed laminating the layers with a dummy substrate having a thickness of<br>
0.6mm, and the UV-curable resin to provide a recordable optical recording<br>
medium. Recording is conducted in a condition in conformity with the HD<br>
DVD-R standard (DVD specifications for high density recordable disc (HD<br>
DVD-R) version 1.0) by using an optical disc evaluation device ODU-1000<br>
(wavelength: 405nm, NA:0.65) manufactured by Pulstec Industrial Co. Ltd.<br>
with respect to this recordable optical recording medium to measure PRSNR<br>
with the result that a favorable value of 22.0 (standard value: 15 or more)<br>
was obtained. Furthermore, the PRSNR after the storage test for 300 hours<br>
at a temperature of 80 degrees C and a moisture of 85% became 16.0 and a<br>
favorable property was shown.<br>
(Example 24)<br>
On a polycarbonate substrate having a guide groove (a groove depth<br>
of 26nm and track pitch of 0.4pm), by the sputtering method an aluminum<br>
oxide layer (A12O3) layer with a thickness of 15nm, a Bi-B-0 layer with a<br>
thickness of 15nm which serves as a recording layer and a ZnS-SiO2 (ZnS:<br>
SiO2=80:20mol%) layer with a thickness of 20nm were sequentially<br><br>
deposited. As the Bi-B-0 layer, a layer having an atomic ratio Bi/B of 1.75<br>
and an atomic ratio O/B of 4.5 was used.<br>
Next, an AlTi alloy (Ti: 1.0 weight%) layer having a thickness of<br>
40nm was provided by the sputtering method, and an organic protection<br>
layer made of UV curable resin (Sun Nopco Co., Ltd.: Nopco Cure 134) and<br>
having a thickness of about 5□m was provided by spin coating.<br>
Furthermore, the dummy substrate having a thickness of 0.6mm was bonded<br>
to the protection layer to provide a recordable optical recording medium.<br>
Recording was conducted in a condition in conformity with the standard of<br>
HD DVD-R (DVD specifications for high density recordable disc (HD<br>
DVD-R) version 1.0) by using an optical disc evaluation device ODU-1000<br>
(wavelength: 405nm, NA: 0.65) manufactured by Pulstec Industrial CO., Ltd.<br>
with respect to this recordable optical recording medium to measure PRSNR<br>
with the result that a favorable value of 29.0 (standard value: 15 or more)<br>
was obtained. Furthermore, the PRSNR after the storage test for 300 hours<br>
at a temperature of 80°C and a moisture of 85% became 23.0 and a favorable<br>
property was shown. It was made clear that in the case where the<br>
aluminum oxide layer was replaced with the ZnS-SiO2 layer (ZnS:<br>
SiO2=80:20mol%), the value of PRSNR was 24.0, and decreased to 19.0<br>
after the storage test, and the value of the PRSNR in the case of using an<br>
aluminum oxide layer was further higher.<br>
(Example 25)<br><br>
On a polycarbonate substrate (product name: ST3000 manufactured<br>
by Teijin Bayer Polytec Co., Ltd) having a guide groove (with a groove<br>
depth of 21nm and a track pitch of 0.32µm ) and having a thickness of<br>
1,1mm and diameter of 120mm by the sputtering method a AlTi alloy (Ti:<br>
1.0 weight%) layer serving as a reflection layer and having a thickness of<br>
35nm, a silicon nitride layer serving as a second protection layer and having<br>
a thickness of 10nm, a layer (Bi-B-0 layer) comprising Bi, B and oxygen<br>
and having a thickness of 16nm and a ZnS-SiO2 (80: 20mol%) layer of 12nm<br>
thickness were sequentially provided followed by laminating thereon a<br>
polycarbonate sheet (manufactured by Teijin Kasei; Pure Ace) having a<br>
thickness of 75µm by using UV-curable resin (manufactured by Nippon<br>
Kayaku; DVD0O3) to provide a light transmitting layer having a thickness of<br>
1,2mm thereby preparing a recordable optical recording medium of the<br>
present invention (a recordable optical recording medium which<br>
corresponds to the standard of the so-called Blu-ray disc). As the Bi-B-0<br>
layer, a layer having the atomic ratio Bi/B of 1.75 and the atomic ratio O/B<br>
of 4.5 was used. Recording was conducted in a condition in conformity<br>
with the standard of the recordable Blu-ray disc (BD-R version 1.1) by using<br>
the optical disc evaluation device ODU-1000 (wavelength: 405nm, NA:<br>
0.85) manufactured by Pulstec Industrial Co., Ltd. with respect to this<br>
recordable optical recording medium to measure jitter values. The jitter<br>
value before the storage test was 5.1%. The jitter after 300 hour-storage<br><br>
test at a temperature of 80oC and moisture of 85% was 6.1%. It was<br>
established that favorable characteristics could be obtained. Furthermore,<br>
as shown in FIG. 5, it was made clear that with respect to the reproduction<br>
signal after storage, a disc using silicon nitride had a smaller noise and<br>
preferably the silicon nitride was used as the second protection layer.<br>
(Example 26)<br>
Example 26 is an example corresponding to claim 17. On a<br>
polycarbonate substrate (product name: ST3000 manufactured by Teijin<br>
Bayer Polytec Co., Ltd.) having as a guide groove (a groove depth of 21nm,<br>
a track pitch of 0.32µm) and having a thickness of 1.1mm and a diameter of<br>
120mm, by means of the sputtering method, an AlTi alloy (Ti: 1.0 weight%)<br>
serving as a reflection layer and having a thickness of 35nm, a ZnS-SiO2<br>
(80:20 mol%) layer serving as a second protection layer and having a<br>
thickness of 10nm, a layer (Bi-B-0 layer) comprising Bi, B and O and<br>
having a thickness of 16nm, and a ZnS-SiO2 (8.0:20. mol%) layer having a<br>
thickness of 10nm were sequentially provided, followed by laminating<br>
thereon a polycarbonate sheet (manufactured by Teijin Kasei; Pure Ace)<br>
having a thickness of 75 µm by using a UV curable resin (manufactured by<br>
Nippon Kayaku; DVD0O3) to provide a light penetration layer with the<br>
result that a recordable optical recording medium of the present invention (a<br>
recordable optical recording medium which corresponds to the standard of a<br><br>
so-called Blu-ray disc) was prepared. With respect to this recordable<br>
optical recording medium, recording was conducted in a condition<br>
corresponding to the standard of the recordable blue-ray disc (BD-R version<br>
1.1) by using an optical disc evaluation device ODU-1000 (wavelength:<br>
405nm, NA: 0.85) manufactured by Pulstec Industrial Co., Ltd. to evaluate<br>
the recording characteristics. The relationship between the quantity of<br>
oxygen in the Bi-B-0 layer and the optimum recording power is shown in<br>
FIG. 6. When the quantity of oxygen is within this scope, the optimum<br>
recording power was restricted to a scope of the standard value and shows a<br>
favorable power. In a scope less than 60 atomic % of the quantity of<br>
oxygen, a particularly favorable value is shown. Furthermore, a result of<br>
the investigation as to what degree the jitter values increased before and<br>
after storage test is shown in FIG. 7. A variation quantity of the jitter<br>
values before and after the storage test is shown by the ratio of the jitter<br>
values before the storage test. Values after 300 hours storage test were<br>
used. It can be seen that when the quantity of oxygen is 50% or more, the<br>
increase amounts of jitter value were relatively small, which is preferable.<br>
It can be seen that when the quantity of oxygen is 55% or more, virtually no<br>
change was shown, which is more preferable.<br>
Furthermore, the same recording is conducted on the recordable<br>
optical recording medium which is identical to that described above except<br><br>
that an AlTi alloy (Ti: 1.0 weight%) layer serving as a reflection layer and<br>
having a thickness of 35nm, a ZnS-SiO2 (80: 20mol%) layer serving as a<br>
second protection layer and having a thickness of 25nm, and a layer (Bi-B-0<br>
layer of oxygen 68 atom%) layer comprising Bi, B and oxygen and having a<br>
thickness of 16nm are sequentially formed followed by laminating thereon a<br>
polycarbonate sheet (manufactured by Teijin Kasei; Pure Ace) having a<br>
thickness of 75µm by using a UV curable resin (manufactured by Nippon<br>
Kayaku; DVD00O3) to provide a light transmitting layer. At a recording<br>
power of 5.6mW, a jitter of 5.8% was obtained. However, it was made clear<br>
that when the recording linear velocity was doubled (2X recording) the jitter<br>
value became 6.5% or less only in the case where the record light was<br>
7.2mW and the sensitivity decreased and was out of the standard.<br>
(Example 27)<br>
On a polycarbonate substrate having a guide groove (with a groove<br>
depth of 26nm and a track pitch of 0.4pm), by using the sputtering method,<br>
a ZnS-SiO2 layer (ZnS: SiO2=80: 20mol%) serving as the first protection<br>
layer, a Bi-B-0 layer serving as the recording layer, a ZnS-SiO2 layer (ZnS:<br>
SiO2=80: 20mol%) serving as the second protection layer, and a AlTi alloy<br>
(Ti:1.0 weight%) layer serving as the reflection layer were sequentially<br>
deposited. As the Bi-B-0 layer, a layer having a composition of Bi<br>
27.0-B 13. 1-059.9 was used. Next, an organic protection layer comprising<br><br>
a UV curable resin (manufactured by San Nopco Co., Ltd; Nopco Cure<br>
134) and having a thickness of about 5µm was provided on the AlTi alloy<br>
laer by spin coating, followed by further laminating a dummy substrate<br>
having a thickness of 0.6mm and a UV curable resin to obtain a recordable<br>
optical recording medium. Recording was conducted in a condition corresponding to the HD DVD-R standard (DVD specifications for high<br>
density recordable disc (HD DVD-R) version 1.0) by using an optical disc<br>
evaluation device ODU-1000 (wavelength: 405nm, NA: 0.65) manufactured<br>
by Pulstec Industrial Co., Ltd. with respect to this recordable optical<br>
recording medium. Example 27 is an example corresponding to claim 23.<br>
FIG. 8 shows a value of PRSNR of the optical recording medium in which<br>
the recording layer was formed to a thickness of 17nm, the second<br>
protection layer was formed to a thickness of 20nm, and the reflection layer<br>
was formed to a thickness of 40nm by changing the thickness of the first<br>
protection layer serving as a ZnS-SiO2 layer. Values of PRSNR in the<br>
vicinity of 60nm show the highest value. FIG. 9 shows a value of PRSNR<br>
of the optical recording medium in which the ZnS-SiO2 layer serving as the<br>
first protection layer is formed to a thickness of 60nm, the thickness of the<br>
recording layer was changed, the second protection layer was changed to a<br>
thickness of 20nm, and the reflection layer was formed to a thickness of<br>
40nm. Values of PRSNR in the vicinity of 17nm show the highest values.<br>
FIG. 10 shows a value of PRSNR of the optical recording medium in which<br><br>
the ZnS-SiO2 layer serving as the first protection layer is formed to a<br>
thickness of 60nm, the recording layer was formed to a thickness of 15nm,<br>
the thickness of the second protection layer was changed, and the reflection<br>
layer was formed to a thickness of 40nm. Values of PRSNR in the vicinity<br>
of 20nm show the highest values. Furthermore, FIG. 11 shows the values<br>
of PRSNR before the storage test and after 200 hour-storage test. There<br>
was a difference depending on the thickness of the first protection layer. In<br>
the case where the first protection layer was Onm, the reduction in the<br>
PRSNR value was large. However, in the protection layer with a thickness<br>
of 10nm or 30nm, the reduction in the PRSNR value was suppressed; this<br>
means such thickness values were effective. FIG. 12 shows a relationship<br>
between the thickness of the reflection layer and the PRSNR. The<br>
ZnS-SiO2 layer serving as the first protection layer was formed to a<br>
thickness of 60nm, the recording layer was formed to a thickness of 17nm,<br>
and the second protection layer was formed to a thickness of 20nm. Values<br>
of PRSNR in the vicinity of 40nm show favorable characteristics.<br>
