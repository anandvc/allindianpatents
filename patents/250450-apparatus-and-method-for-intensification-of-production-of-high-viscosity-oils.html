				<td>APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR INTENSIFICATION<br>
OF PRODUCTION OF HIGH-VISCOSITY OILS<br>
FIELD OF APPLICATION<br>
[0001] The invention relates to an apparatus and method for intensification of<br>
production of high-viscosity oils. The invention applies to the oil-producing<br>
industry and is intended for the intensification of the processes of increasing the<br>
yield of oil wells used for the production of high-viscosity oils.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] At present, a fairly large number of methods and apparatuses are known<br>
that allow enhancement of production processes for high-viscosity oils. In most<br>
cases, these techniques employ physicochemical methods of influence on a<br>
stratum (well bottom zone) and on transport systems that transport oil from the<br>
stratum to the surface. In particular, it is proposed to add different reagents into a<br>
well and to influence strata by elastic vibrations of different frequency, shock<br>
waves, magnetic and electric fields or combinations thereof. In some cases, the<br>
use of devices that include sources of elastic vibrations and systems of induction<br>
heating are provided.<br>
[0003] A method for intensification of oil production by the excitation of elastic<br>
vibrations in a stratum and the well bottom zone is known (US 5,950,726 A,<br>
published on January 31, 1991). Elastic vibrations are excited by use of a<br>
hydraulic vibration generator, by a cyclic change of pressure in liquid being<br>
supplied. The excitation of elastic vibrations leads to a decrease in the viscosity<br>
of oil, a rise in the permeability of a reservoir and an increase in the output of a<br>
well.<br><br>
[0004] The disadvantage of this method is that it does not provide for the effects<br>
on oil during its transport by oil-well tubing, thus decreasing the efficiency of the<br>
method.<br>
[0005] A prototype of the first object of the proposed invention is a method for<br>
development of oil pool (RU 2184842 C2, published on July 10,.2002), where<br>
stimulation of producing formation with a heat source and source of elastic<br>
vibrations is proposed. A heat source is placed inside an injection well.<br>
Treatment with the heat source is carried out with periodic variation of its power.<br>
A source of elastic vibrations is installed on the surface of the wellhead of the oil<br>
producing well. Heat source and source of elastic vibrations operate at the same<br>
frequency and periodically constant difference of phases. The effect obtained is<br>
the most complete withdrawal of oil due to varying of oil viscosity and phase<br>
permeability of reservoir for oil and water.<br>
[0006] The disadvantage of the method is its insufficient efficiency because it<br>
does not provide for the effect on oil during its transport by oil well tubing<br>
[0007] A device for the production of high-viscosity oils is known (RU 2198284<br>
C2, published on February 10, 2003) that involves the use of an induction well<br>
electric heater. In this device, oil-well tubing (OWT) fitted with metal rings with<br>
slits, is a casing and at the same time a magnetic core. Wires of an induction coil<br>
wound on the external surface of the casing are laid through slits. The use of the<br>
device allows heating of the oil being extracted due to the conversion of electrical<br>
energy into thermal energy.<br>
[0008] The disadvantage of this device is that it does not provide for the<br>
additional effect on the stratum and oil in the well bottom zone, decreasing the<br>
efficiency of the device.<br>
[0009] A prototype of the second object of the proposed invention is a thermo-<br>
acoustic well apparatus (SU 1086131 A, published on April 15, 1984) that allows<br><br>
conducting the simultaneous heating and irradiation of oil stratum in the well<br>
bottom zone with ultrasound using a magnetostrictive radiator, which increases<br>
the inflow of oil into a well.<br>
[0010] The disadvantage of the device is that the treatment is carried out only in<br>
the oil stratum without the heating of OWT, which decreases the efficiency of the<br>
device during oil production. [0011] Acoustic Well Recovery Method and Device<br>
Patent Application US 10/615,230, proposes a method for acoustic stimulation<br>
and the devices for its implementation, characterized because it comprises an<br>
electric generator and a vibratory system placed inside the well. The method<br>
proposed in Patent Application, U.S. 10/615,230, promotes the formation of<br>
shear vibrations in the extraction zone. The disadvantage of said Application in<br>
relation to the production of high viscosity fluids lies in the fact that it does not<br>
consider neither the heat generated in the extraction zone or the stimulation of<br>
recovered fluids during transport to the surface through the oil well tubing.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0012] In the first and second objects of the invention, a technical result is<br>
achieved that lies in increasing the efficiency of production of high-viscosity oils<br>
during the development of wells by conventional methods used in the oil industry<br>
owing to a rise in the permeability of a reservoir and a reduction in the viscosity<br>
of oil and in increasing environmental safety owing to the absence of chemically<br>
active reagents (acids) and steam generators.<br>
[0013] In the first object of the invention - a method for intensification of high-<br>
viscosity oil production, the specified technical result is achieved in the following<br>
way.<br>
[0014] In the method of intensification of production of high-viscosity oils, the<br>
viscosity of oil in the well bottom zone is decreased by the effect of a high- power<br>
ultrasonic field on it. The excited ultrasonic field provides in addition the heating<br><br>
of the well bottom zone. The achieved viscosity of oil is maintained during its<br>
transport to the daylight through the heating of oil-well tubing (OWT) by high-<br>
frequency currents.<br>
[0015] In the second object of the invention - an apparatus for intensification of<br>
high-viscosity oil production, the specified technical result is achieved in the<br>
following way. [0016] An apparatus for intensification of production of high-<br>
viscosity oils contains the unit of ultrasonic excitation of the well bottom zone<br>
which includes a surface ultrasonic generator and at least one ultrasonic<br>
magnetostrictive radiator placed, at the end of oil-well tubing (OWT) insulated<br>
electrically from the casing pipe of a well, which are electrically connected with<br>
each other by two cords of a three-cord electrical cable. The heating unit of the<br>
OWT consists of a daylight surface high-frequency generator and an OWT<br>
heating line, which is distributed along the entire length of OWT and heats by<br>
high-frequency currents, including the third cord of the three-cord electrical cable.<br>
[0017] In one of the cases of the invention implementation, the daylight surface<br>
high-frequency generator of the OWT heating unit is electrically connected by a<br>
grounded wire to OWT. OWT is electrically insulated from the casing pipe of a<br>
well. At the location of the ultrasonic radiator, the surface high-frequency<br>
generator is connected to OWT by the third cord of the three- cord electrical<br>
cable.<br>
[0018] In the other case of the invention implementation, one output of the<br>
daylight surface high-frequency generator of the OWT heating unit is connected<br>
to one of the outputs of the surface ultrasonic generator, and the cord of the<br>
three-cord electrical cable which is connected to this output is a common cord for<br>
both generators. At that, the second output of the surface daylight high-frequency<br>
generator is connected by the third cord of the three- cord electrical cable at the<br>
place of the location of the ultrasonic magnetostrictive radiator to the common<br>
cord of the three-cord electrical cable.<br><br>
[0019] Besides, the OWT heating line, by high-frequency currents, contains in<br>
addition at least two inductors placed on the OWT and connected to the third<br>
cord of the three-cord electrical cable.<br>
[0020] At that, an ultrasonic magnetostrictive radiator is made in the form of a<br>
hollow cylinder, whose inside diameter matches the OWT inside diameter.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
[0025] The invention is illustrated in Figures 1-4, by a schematic drawing in which<br>
an apparatus for the implementation of the method for intensification of<br>
production of high-viscosity oils with different cases for the connection of the<br>
heating line of the OWT heating unit by high-frequency currents is presented.<br>
[0026] Fig. 1 shows the general structure of the oil well and a surface device 20<br>
at daylight level 1 (which contains the surface ultrasonic generator 3 and the<br>
daylight surface high frequency generator 10) and the ultrasonic magnetostrictive<br><br>
radiator 4 at the end of the oil well tubing 5, connected by the three-cord<br>
electrical cable 9.<br>
[0027] The following is shown in Fig. 2: the daylight level 1 , stratum- reservoir 2,<br>
the unit of ultrasonic excitation of the well bottom zone which includes the<br>
surface ultrasonic generator 3 and at least one ultrasonic magnetostrictive<br>
radiator 4 placed at the end of OWT 5.<br>
[0028] The ultrasonic magnetostrictive radiator 4 is made in the form of a hollow<br>
cylinder, whose inside diameter matches the inside diameter of OWT 5. [0029]<br>
The surface ultrasonic generator 3 and the ultrasonic magnetostrictive radiator 4<br>
are electrically connected to each other by two cords 7 and 8 of the three-cord<br>
electrical cable 9.<br>
[0030] The OWT heating unit consists of the surface high-frequency generator 10<br>
and the OWT heating unit line, which is distributed along the entire length of<br>
OWT 5, heated by high-frequency currents, including the third cord 11 of the<br>
three-cord electrical cable 9.<br>
[0031] In one of the cases of the invention implementation (Fig. 2), in the the<br>
heating line of OWT 5 by high-frequency currents one output of the surface high-<br>
frequency generator 10 on the daylight surface 1 is electrically connected to<br>
OWT 5 by a grounded wire 12. The other output of the surface high-frequency<br>
generator 10 is connected directly to OWT 5 by the third cord 11 of the cable 9 in<br>
the well bottom zone at the place of the location of the ultrasonic<br>
magnetostrictive radiator 4. OWT 5 is electrically insulated from the well casing<br>
pipe 6 with the use of insulators 13.<br>
[0032] In the other particular case shown in Fig. 3, in the heating line of OWT 5<br>
by high-frequency currents, one output of the surface high-frequency generator<br>
10 is connected on the daylight surface 1 to one of the outputs of the surface<br>
ultrasonic generator 3, and the cord 8 of the three-cord cable 9 which is<br><br>
connected to this output is a common cord for both generators 3 and 10. At that,<br>
the second output of the surface high-frequency generator 10 is connected by<br>
the third cord 11 of the cable 9 to the common cord 8 of the cable 9 in the well<br>
bottom zone at the place of the location of the ultrasonic magnetostrictive<br>
radiator 4.<br>
[0033] The line of the OWT heating by high-frequency currents for more intensive<br>
heating of OWT 5 and consequently for facilitation of oil transportation can in<br>
addition contain at least two inductors 14 and 15 (Fig. 4) placed on OWT 5 and<br>
connected to the third cord 11 of the cable 9.<br>
[0034] An example of method implementation is as follows. [0035] High-power<br>
ultrasonic vibrations from the surface ultrasonic generator 3 are transmitted<br>
through cords 7 and 8 of the three-cord cable 9 to the ultrasonic magnetostrictive<br>
radiator 4. The power of ultrasonic vibrations induced by the surface ultrasonic<br>
generator 3 depends on the viscosity and amount of oil being produced. By<br>
adjusting the power of ultrasonic vibrations, the optimization of the process of oil<br>
production is achieved.<br>
[0036] Depending on the increase in the thickness of a stratum and the viscosity<br>
and amount of oil being produced, the number of ultrasonic radiators varies from<br>
1 to more, changing towards an increase. At the stratum thickness of more than<br>
20 m, permeability lower than 20 millidarcy, porosity less than 20 %, yield 15-20<br>
tonne/day and viscosity about 50 centipoise, it is necessary to install at least 2<br>
high-power radiators.<br>
[0037] Under the excitation of an ultrasonic field by magnetostrictive radiators,<br>
the following occurs:<br>
• Intensification of the processes of heat and mass transfer in the well bottom<br>
zone in an ultrasonic field, • Decrease of oil viscosity of oil in the ultrasonic field<br>
(by about 30% in free space, and to a substantially greater extent in porous<br><br>
media under sonocapillary effect. The extent of decrease in viscosity is<br>
determined by the features of medium porosity and the parameters of an<br>
ultrasonic field.), ■ Heating of the well bottom zone due to the loss of energy in a<br>
magnetostrictive radiator, because its efficiency does not exceed 50%, and heat<br>
transfer into the well bottom zone, • Use of a magnetostrictive radiator as an<br>
electro-acoustic transducer as a result of a higher Curie point as compared to the<br>
use of piezoceramics allows one to substantially increase the operating<br>
temperatures for carrying out the method.<br>
[0038] From the well bottom zone, oil comes into OWT 5. OWT 5 is heated by<br>
high-frequency currents in the following way. [0039] Both in the first and in the<br>
second case of the connection of the third cord 11 of the cable 9 to OWT 5<br>
directly or via the common cord 8, its induction heating occurs by high-frequency<br>
currents.<br>
[0040] In the first case (Fig. 2), high-frequency currents from the daylight surface<br>
high frequency generator 10 directly via the third cord 11 come into OWT 5 and<br>
heat it. But, at that, the insulation of OWT 5 from the casing pipe 6 with the use of<br>
insulators 13 is necessary. This method can be used in more unfavorable<br>
conditions of oil extraction.<br>
[0041] In the second case (Fig. 3), high-frequency currents from the daylight<br>
surface high frequency generator 10 via the junction of the third cord 11 and the<br>
common cord 8 come into OWT 5 and heat it. In this case the insulation of OWT<br>
5 is not required. This particular case is more easily producible, but then, there is<br>
a limitation on the increase in temperature conditions of oil production by the<br>
temperature stability of the cable, and in this connection it is advisable for use in<br>
less adverse conditions of oil production.<br>
[0042] Under the most adverse conditions of oil production, it is appropriate to<br>
use the additional heating of OWT 5, which is conducted with the use of<br>
inductors 14 and 15.<br><br>
[0043] The oil transported by the tubing heated in this way retains its reduced<br>
viscosity and therefore the efficiency of oil production increases.<br>
[0044] In the proposed invention, a rise in the permeability of a reservoir, a<br>
reduction in the viscosity of oil and, as a consequence, an increase in the<br>
efficiency of oil production, as well as an increase in environmental safety is<br>
achieved owing to the following:<br>
[0045] Decrease in the viscosity of oil in the well bottom zone due to the<br>
combined ultrasonic and thermal treatment,<br>
[0046] Decrease in the viscosity of oil in OWT due to its heating by high-<br>
frequency currents.<br><br>
