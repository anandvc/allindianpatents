				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a novel adaptor. It also relates to medical devices, especially to pediatric breathing circuits for conveying an inspiratory gas from a gas dispensing apparatus to a patient, and release of expiratory gases from a patient. The invention also provides use of adaptor in anaesthetic circuit.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
During surgery or post-operatively and pre-intubation period (when face mask is in use) for therapeutic reasons, Anaesthetic gases are supplied to a patient to paralyse him. Typically, the anaesthetic liquid is a gas. It is stored in a container and vapours of this liquid are administered to the patient. The container may be provided with a outlet port for outflow of gas and is connected preferably via Ayre's T' Piece and corrugated tube to a face mask that conveys gas to a patient. The apparatus, including the reservoir bag, gas flow tube and face mask are popularly known as anaesthesia circuit'.<br>
The anaesthesia circuit popularly used for adults is the MagilPs circuit. It has a flexible corrugated tube, connected at one end to a reservoir bag and fresh gas flow point, the other end is connected to a face mask and expiratory valve used for children more than 1 year age after insert tube in respiration tract, this circuit is changed over by paediatric circuit. To this circuit is changed over by an Ayres T-piece, which allows escape of patients expiratory gases. One encounters several problems when employing two different circuits for children. Only neonatal mask (1 day to 28 days age) can be directly fitted in pediatric circuit.<br>
One of the problems is that for children, masks of different sized are used depending on the age and body weight. Masks of at least four different sizes are available for pediatric use. However, all these masks do not fit into the Ayres' T-piece.<br>
To solve this problem, a separate anaesthesia circuit is attached to the face mask and after intubations a second modified Jackson Ree's Ayres' T-piece is connected to end of tracheal tube. The method is cumbersome and difficult since it involves the use of two circuits. The presence of many joints in the circuit makes the handling thereof difficult and awkward. In fact, two anesthetists are required, one to handle the circuit and the other to administer anaesthesia and monitor the same. Time is too short during anaesthesia and the patient cannot be left unattended even for a second without gas.<br>
To obviate these difficulties, it is desirable to provide a circuit whereby masks of various sized may be comfortably connected in the pediatric circuit and used for children.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide an Anaesthetic circuit including a means that<br>
comfortably connects the T-piece to the mask.<br>
Another object is to provide a single anaesthetic circuit part capable of being used for adults as well as children.<br>

mask.<br>

STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides, a hollow adaptor (60) provided with two opposite ends and characterized in that the adaptor comprises a first open end (61) having a diameter greater than a second end (65), and adapted to accommodate a T-Piece (35) and an adult mask (30); a second open end (65) having a diameter less than the first end (61), and adapted to accommodate a T-Piece (35) and a pediatric mask. The invention also relates to the use of the adaptor (60) in an anaesthetic circuit.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 shows a conventional paediatric circuit having a bag (10) connected to gas flow tube<br>
(20) which is in turn to Ayre's T-piece (35) and FGF to original neonatal mask (30) only.<br>
Figure (4 and 2) shows the adaptor (60) of the invention in shape of an arc or in slight curved<br>
elbow-shape.  It consists a first open end (61) of reduced diameter and fitted with a washer<br>
(62).   The adaptor has a second open end (65) having a diameter greater than the first open<br>
end (61).<br>
Shown in Figure 3, is the improved adaptor of paediatric circuit of the invention, which<br>
consists of a bag (10, gas flow tube (20, a T-piece (35) connected to adaptor (61) which is<br>
further connected to a face mask (30). As mentioned	<br>
earlier, since the adaptor (60) of the invention is provided with ends having different<br>
diameters, it may be used in a pediatric circuit as well as in adult circuits. For use in<br>
pediatric circuits, the T-Piece is connected to that end of the adaptor having reduced<br>
diameter and the face mask is connected to the end having greater diameter. For adult<br>
circuits, the expiratory valve is connected to that end of the adaptor having greater<br>
diameter and the mask is connected to the end with reduced diameter.<br>
In another embodiment as shown in figure 3, the adaptor (50) may be directly attached to<br>
Ayre's T-piece (20) in the improved part of circuit of the invention.<br>
Similarly, when the adaptor is used in adult circuits, the end of the adaptor having greater<br>
diameter is connected to the expiratory valve while the end having reduced diameter is<br>
connected to the face mask. Thus, the adaptor of the<br>
invention may be used in adult as well as pediatric circuits. Since all the parts fit snugly,<br>
the components do not fall off during handling and the need for several anesthetists is<br>
done away. The entire circuit becomes easy to handle and use because no need of use of<br>
two different circuits. Generally, the first end of the adaptor may have a diameter of 2cms<br>
or 20mm to where washer is fitted whereas the second end may have a diameter of 7cms<br>
or 22mm to where washer is fitted.<br>
During its use in adults the above change will not be of any significance and without<br>
washer side can be used when connecting to the expiratory valve or face mask.<br>
During its use in pediatric circuit, the face mask will get attached to the 22 mm male<br>
opening slight change may be effect fitting with Ayre's T piece whereas the internal<br>
diameter of 16 mm will tightly fit on the tapering of either side of Ayre's T-piece, without<br>
producing any change in gas flow resistance.<br>
All international standard face masks have 22 mm female fitting and therefore, the 22<br>
mm male opening on angle connector readily fits on all face masks (Fig. 2). When using<br>
the present day pediatric circuits, the diameter of Ayre's T-piece, which is too small,<br>
cannot be connected to any face mask having 22 mm female opening.<br>
As the face masks have to be changed according to age, this modified adaptor (1) which<br>
is single, has not to be changed each time and liable to be misplaced, thereby creating<br>
hazardous situation for the anaesthesiologist.<br>
With this adaptor, the Ayre's T-piece is connected perpendicular to the child's face and is<br>
liable to kink and cumbersome to use.<br>
In the change recommended by the patentee, if the internal diameter of the angle<br>
connector modified (2) (it is already made by companies) is reduced to 16 mm on anyone<br>
side, it can directly fit on all the Ayre's T-piece.<br>
All face masks will fit on the 22 mm male opening of the opposite side of connector<br>
thereby permitting the angle connector to be used effectively in adults as well as children.<br>
With the use of an angle connector, the Ayre's T-piece is at 900 to the child's face<br>
(in modification No.l) which is a comfortable angle to hold and use the reservoir bag as<br>
used in adults and is according to international standards. This 900 is reduced to 300 to<br>
450 when using modification No.2 and handling the paediatric circuit is easy.<br>
The apparatus now becomes safe and convenient to use in adults and children. As the<br>
tracheal bore is smaller than any part being used in the anaesthesia circuit, the change in<br>
resistance or dead space will not be significant.<br>
This modification will be of great significance during operations of children where safety<br>
of the child is of utmost importance and slight degree of negligence can be life<br>
threatening.<br><br><br><br>
