				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to the field of steam generation system.<br>
The present invention in particular relates to pulverizers, feeding raw coal to the<br>
boilers of steam generation system. More particularly, the present invention<br>
relates to a motor-operated raw coal isolation device to prevent flowing of<br>
ignited raw coal to the pulverizer from the storage bunker.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thermal power plants use Fossil fuels like coal to generate steam for Power<br>
generation. The fuel coal is delivered from coal mines to the power plant through<br>
rail, ship or by road transportation. The coal received at power plant is called raw<br>
coal. This raw coal is stored in storage yards. The raw coal cannot be fired<br>
directly in large capacity boilers / steam generators. The raw coal has to be<br>
pulverized so as to make it burn efficiently in a boiler furnace. In modern utility<br>
steam generating stations, the unit load is directly linked to the pulverizer. The<br>
pulverizer dynamically responds to the load. Hence, the pulverizer operation<br>
necessarily calls for a temporary storage arrangement. This storage arrangement<br>
is called as raw coal bin or raw coal bunker. The raw coal is susceptible to a risk<br>
of accidental ignition. If the coal is accidentally ignited, it will cause to develop a<br>
big fire hazard. With this fire in the bunker, if raw coal is admitted to pulverizer it<br>
will lead to catastrophic accident. To obviate this problem, it is desirable that an<br>
isolation device capable of preventing the flow of burning coal from raw coal<br>
bunker to the pulverizer, is provided. The raw coal bunkers are normally<br>
designed for storage capacity of ten to fifteen hours of boiler operation.<br><br>
As the raw coal is generally stored in a vertical column, any isolation device<br>
when provided needs to move against such vertical column of raw coal. In<br>
addition, monsoon brings more hardships by the way of increased moisture in<br>
the raw coal which results in coal column compaction. Due to such, the existing<br>
isolation devices available in market are suffering with the following setbacks.<br>
i) When the bunker isolation device is operated, arch formulation takes<br>
place which leads to mild to heavy choking of raw coal.<br>
ii) The isolation device cannot be closed to its full capacity (100%) since<br>
the entrapped coal between the isolation device plate (across the<br>
section) and the wall on the opposite end acts as a barrier.<br>
The opening size determines the flowabiiity of raw coal into the down stream.<br>
Bigger the opening, smoother will be the raw coal flow. During monsoon season,<br>
the flowabiiity of coal is very much affected due to increase in surface moisture.<br>
The arch formulation at the bunker outlet is common phenomena which almost<br>
interrupts the coal flow resulting starvation of coal into the pulverizer circuit.<br>
During boiler operation the raw coal flows in to the down stream, therefore<br>
during the normal condition, the isolation device can be easily closed as flowing<br>
raw coal does not pose severe problems in piercing through column of coal.<br>
However, when coal flow is interrupted due to reason beyond control, the<br>
closure of isolation device to its full capacity is impossible. Power station<br>
engineers resort a crude way of operation by manipulating the isolation device to<br>
move forward and backward and there by inching towards complete closure of<br>
the opening. Such a remedy is not reliable, safe and a technical solution.<br><br>
Isolation device is used to Open / Close at the bunker outlet by moving from one<br>
end to another. When the bunker outlet dimensions exceeds certain limit, the<br>
force required to shear the vertical coal column increases exponentially which<br>
may result halting the movement midway. Added to that, if the coal column is<br>
established, it may further aggravate the situation.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a motor-operated improved<br>
raw coal isolation device which eliminates the disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a motor-operated improved raw coal<br>
isolation device which ensures free and smooth flow of moistured raw coal even<br>
in monsoon periods.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a motor-operated improved raw<br>
coal isolation device which moves towards the center from the ends, and having<br>
its moving parts with smaller overlapping such that a full closer of the device is<br>
always ensured.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a motor-operated improved raw<br>
coal isolation device which does not require the coal column to be sheared in the<br>
direction of the opening, thereby allowing a complete closure of the device.<br><br>
A still further object of the invention is to provide a motor-operated improved<br>
raw coal isolation device which prevents flow of burning coal from the raw-coal<br>
bunker to the pulverizer thereby avoiding any catastrophic accident in a steam<br>
generation system.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The motor-operated improved raw coal isolation device comprises:<br>
Corrosion resistant body: As the body of the device comes in contact<br>
with coal, it is made of corrosion resistant steel. The corrosion resistant<br>
steel body prevents rusting and withstands comparatively for a longer<br>
period. The body is made of sufficient thickness to withstand the<br>
corrosion. The isolation device is equipped with two access ports, each<br>
having a molded gasket under a rigid cover, providing a dust-tight closure.<br>
Covers are designed for easy removal. Inside surfaces of the covers flush<br>
with the body, to assure good coal flow. The body of the coal isolation<br>
device is a fabricated steel plate, with all joints in contact with the coal<br>
flow welded inside and out, and ground smooth to eliminate any edges on<br>
which coal could accumulate. The end cover, provided for isolation<br>
removal and interior access, is equipped with molded gasket, assuring<br>
dust-tight integrity of the isolation device. Two hand wheels are provided<br>
for manual operation. Indicators are provided for the wheel to indicate the<br>
'open" and "close" directions.<br><br>
Corrosion resistant Isolator: There are atleast two isolators lined with<br>
corresion resistant steel, The isolators are supported by "L" shaped racks.<br>
The isolator is allowed to overlap each other at the center of the opening.<br>
The isolator by its design keeps the supporting rollers completely away<br>
from coal stream. The isolator edge is beveled so that the coal column is<br>
easily sheared. This design minimizes the potential corrosion from<br>
moisture in the coal, and contributed to reliable operation and long life.<br>
Rack and Pinion: To assure closure of the isolator without choking,<br>
pinions on the operating shaft engage "L" shaped racks which run down<br>
each side of the isolator. As the pinions are located above the racks,<br>
positive tooth engagement is ensured.<br>
Drive systems: There are two actuators to drive the two isolators. The<br>
actuators are synchronized to operate in tandem. The safe torque value is<br>
set on the actuator so that the actuator trips when the torque level<br>
exceeds. The actuators are operable remotely and locally.<br><br><br>
rack (14) which run down each side of the isolator. As the pinions are suitably<br>
located, positive tooth engagement is ensured.<br>
A Drive means (18): The drive means comprises a plurality of actuators (18)<br>
which drive the isolators (12). The actuators (18) are synchronized. Safe torque<br>
value is set on the actuator. The actuator (18) trips when the specific level<br>
exceeds. The actuators (18) are operable by an electric motor (not shown) from<br>
the control room or near to its fixation.<br><br>
