This invention relates to a hot water energy saver.<br>
An object of this invention is to conserve energy and water wasted during daily use.<br>
In the known hot water supply systems, when hot water is required at the utility point end hot water tap is opened, since the boiler is kept in a remote location, the water at the utility end is normally cold when tap is opened after a long delay.<br>
Accordingly, in the known hot water supply systems, the cold water is allowed to drain out till the hot water reaches the tap point After use, when the tap is closed the hot water present in the pipeline from the boiler up to the utility point gets coid and loses heat energy.<br>
This problem of wastage is acutely felt in cold countries where the amount of hot water wasted and consequent wastage of electricity to reheat the water are substantial.<br>
Furthermore, in the known hot water systems, after the hot water in the pipeline gets cold, there is a possibility of the cold water getting frozen in the pipeline and that could damage the pipeline. Besides, it is not possible to get hot water again when the tap is opened.<br>
This invention solves the above problems and considerably reduces water consumption cost and electricity cost.<br><br>
The hot water energy saver, according to this invention, comprises a boiler for making hot water; a pump connected to the boiler, a tap connected to the pump; Ganged two throw valves ; Pressure sensor; Limit switches; Float; Test switch; End Unit ;Microprocessor controller, whereby, on the tap being opened, the pump is switched on to pump hot water from the boiler to the tap and on the tap being closed, the pump is switched off to cease pumping of water to the tap, but switches on thereafter to pump the hot water remaining in the pipe line to a storage tank connected to the boiler; a source of cold water also connected to the boiler; the Controller  operating the pump, the storage tank and the said source.<br>
This invention is a compact, microprocessor controlled system, which ensures delivery of hot water instantly instead of getting cold water for sometime as in the existing system.<br>
Whenever the tap is closed, the hot water in the pipeline is sucked back by a pump to a hot water storage tank and to the boiler again automatically. Because of this, the heat energy in the hot water and the volume of water inside the pipeline is not wasted through the drain while opening the tap again for getting hot water after sometime.<br>
Here there is no possibility of water getting frozen inside the pipeline and there is no need of mixing anti-freezing agents with the water.<br>
This system is very easy to install with the existing pipeline in the house. And it works automatically whenever the tap is opened or closed and there is no need for switching ON the system to get the hot water as in some other existing systems.<br><br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example and not by way of limitation one of possible embodiments of the hot water energy saver proposed heein.<br>
The basic components of the device proposed herein are:<br>
1)	Water pump<br>
2)	Ganged two throw valves (V1 &amp; V2)<br>
3)	Pressure sensor (PS)<br>
4)	Hot water storage tank<br>
5)	Limit switches (LS1 &amp; LS2)<br>
6)	Float<br>
7)	Test switch<br>
8)	End Unit (EU)<br>
9)	Microprocessor controller<br>
Normally in the Ganged two throw valve (V1), Port A is connected with Port C in Chamber 1 (CH1) and Port F is connected with Port E in Chamber 2 (CH2). In Ganged two throw valve V2, Port H is connected with Port G and Port J is connected with Port L. And these valves are operated electrically by a solenoid inside their body.<br>
And the Pressure sensor (PS) is sends the respective status to the controller. The Pump is in OFF position. And assume that there is no water in hot water storage tank.<br>
In normal hot water outlet mode/phase, first the Pump is Switched ON and it sucks the Hot water from the boiler outlet and the hot water passes into the Chamber 1 (CH1) of V1 through Port A and it reaches the pump through Port C. Then it is delivered through Port F to the Chamber 2 (CH2).<br><br>
At the same time the cold water enters into the boiler through the Ganged two through valve V2 continuously.<br>
When the tap is closed after usage of Hot water, the PS will send the signal to the controller. From that the Controller switches OFF the pump immediately.<br>
Now the pipeline is full of Hot water. And after a few minutes (can be adjusted by the user), the controller connects the port C with B and Port F with D in Valve VI. This stage is the hot water recovery mode/phase.<br>
At the same time the controller switches ON the Pump again and the pump starts to suck the hot water from the pipeline through port B and C and delivered to the hot water storage tank through Port F and D in   Valve V1.<br>
Due to sucking of the hot water in the pipeline there will be drop in pressure below the atmospheric pressure level inside the pipeline.<br>
At the same time, the PS will send the signal to the controller about the pressure status inside the pipeline.<br>
While sucking of hot water from the pipeline, the atmospheric air will get into the pipeline through the End unit (EU).<br><br>
The End Unit consists of one compression spring and a flexible plate inside the body and normally the plate is pushed by the spring against the top wall of the body.<br>
When the pressure inside the pump drops equal to or less than 0.9bar, the atmospheric air will enter into the pipeline automatically by overcoming the spring pressure. And that will maintain the pressure inside the pipe at 0.9bar inside the pipeline after closing of the tap.<br>
At the same time, the hot water reaches the Hot water storage tank through Ganged Valve V2. And the hot water from the pipeline gets filled up in the Hot water Storage tank and the float rises as the water gets filled.<br>
When the float touches the Limit Switch (LS1), it will send the signal to the controller and immediately the controller connects the Port I with port G and Port J with Port K in Valve V2. And the excess water coming from the pump is delivered through Drain/Vent<br>
After completion of sucking the hot water from the pipeline, the controller turns OFF the pump and now the pipeline is filled up by the atmospheric air with pressure of 0.9bar. This stage is the standby mode/phase.<br>
At any time the pressure should be maintained between 0.9 to 0.95bar within the pipeline while the tap is in closed condition.<br>
If there is any minute leakage in the pipeline the pressure will<br>
gradually increase from 0.9bar to 0.95bar. Now the pressure sensor sends the<br><br>
signal to the controller and the pump is started by the controller immediately till the pressure reaches to 0.9bar again. After that the controller switches OFF the pump. And this is done repeatedly inside the system till the tap is opened.<br>
The Test in the tank helps to push the float down whenever it gets stuck. And the Vent is there for relieving of air present inside the tank to outside while the hot water fills up the tank.<br>
When we again open the tap for getting hot water, immediately the pressure inside the pipeline gets increased towards atmospheric pressure from 0.9bar by the entering of atmospheric air inside the pipeline through the tap.<br>
And the PS will send the signal to the controller and the controller connects the port C with A and Port F with E. And at the same time switches ON the pump.<br>
When the tap is again opened, this stage is the Turn ON - Recovery water usage mode/phase.<br>
And the hot water from the boiler reaches the tap immediately. And also the hot water from the Hot water storage tank gets filled up the boiler through the Valve V2.<br>
When the float in the tank touches the LS2, the Controller connects    Port G with H and Port J with L and the cold water continuously enters into the Boiler.<br>
Now the hot water continuously comes out from the boiler till required. At the same time the cold water enters into the boiler from the main cold-water tank.<br><br>
The cycle is repeated when the tap is closed and all this happens within a few seconds, to obtain hot water immediately and save energy.<br>
Here the hot water is supplied only to the particular opened tap and not for other utility points, which are filled by air. This system requires no manual operation, is maintenance free and ensures quiet operation.<br>
Benefits:<br>
Get hot water faster!<br>
The device proposed herein has a very powerful motor for its size. Mainly the time taken by the Hot water to reach the tap from the Boiler outlet gets reduced because the pipeline is filled up by the atmospheric air and not by the cold water as in some other existing systems. The device pumps water at about 3 gallons per minute in a typical residential setting.<br>
No need of Anti freezing agents?<br>
Generally in cold countries there is a possibility of the cold water getting frozen in the pipeline and that could damage the pipeline and we can't get the hot water again when the tap is opened. And we have to add the Anti freezing agents with the water to avoid that problem. Here there is no water remaining in the pipeline after usage and the problem is automatically avoided and money is saved.<br>
Save Water<br>
Since no water runs down the drain while you wait for hot water, you save significant amounts of water every time you use the device.<br><br>
Save energy.<br>
If you leave your hot water fixture running and go do something else while you wait for it, and you come back to find it is hot, then any hot water you've run down the drain was wasting energy! And the energy to heat the water is far more expensive than the water itself.<br>
Improve the performance of your dishwasher.<br>
The number one cause of poor dishwasher performance is water that is not hot enough on the first cycle. By using the device before you start your dishwasher you will get full temperature hot water to your dishwasher on the first cycle...and hot water is much better at dissolving detergent and cleaning dishes than cold water.<br>
Reduced sewage output<br>
The water that doesn't get run down the drain doesn't flow into the sewer or septic system either. Often your sewer charges are based on your water consumption...so by saving water you are saving money from your sewage charges...or reducing the load on your septic system-Reduce greenhouse gas emissions<br>
By reducing the amount of water you consume, the amount of water that has to be treated and pumped to you is reduced. Pumping and treating the water requires lots of energy...generating that energy pumps greenhouse gases into our<br><br>
atmosphere. So by reducing the amount of water (and sewage treatment) you use, you help reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants as well.<br><br>
