n:       valency of M.<br>
30     In addition, it relates to a process for hydrocyanating an olefinically unsaturated com¬pound in the presence of such a system.<br>
Processes for hydrocyanating an olefinically unsaturated nitrile, in particular the prepa¬ration of adipodinitrile by hydrocyanating an olefinically unsaturated compound such as<br>
35     2-C1s-pentenenitrile, 2-trans-pentenenitrile, 3-C1s-pentenenitrile, 3-trans-pentenenitrile, 4-pentenenitrile, E-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile, Z-2-methyl-2-butenenitrile, 2-methyl-3-butenenitrle or mixtures thereof, in the presence of a catalyst system comprising a Lewis aC1d and a complex containing a phosphorus compound suitable as a ligand, such as a monodentate, preferably multidentate, in particular bidentate, compound<br>
40     which coordinates to a central atom via a phosphorus atom which may be present as a phosphine, phosphite, phosphonite or phosphinite or mixture thereof, and a central<br>
2-<br><br>
atom, preferably nickel, cobalt or palladium, in particular nickel, more preferably in the form of nickel(O), are known, for example from US 3,496,217, US 3,496,218, US 4,705,881, US 4,774,353, US 4,874,884, US 5,773,637, US 6,127,567, US 6,171,996 B1 and US 6,380,421 B1.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a system which is suitable as a cata¬lyst for the hydrocyanation of olefinically unsaturated compounds and exhibits an im¬proved space-time yield of hydrocyanation products compared to the known systems.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the system defined at the outset and by a process for hydrocyanating an olefinically unsaturated compound in the presence of such a system.<br>
The preparation of Ni(0)-containing catalyst systems is known per se and, for the pur¬poses of the present invention, can be effected by processes known per se.<br>
The system also additionally comprises a compound which is suitable as a ligand for Ni(0) and contains at least one trivalent phosphorus atom, or a mixture of such com¬pounds.<br>
