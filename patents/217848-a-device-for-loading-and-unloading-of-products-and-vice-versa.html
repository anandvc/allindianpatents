				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a device for loading and unloading of products from a lower to an elevated location and vice versa. By way of example and without implying any limitation to the scope of this invention, the loading device may be employed for loading of packed refrigerators.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The loading of packed refrigerators has hitherto been manually effected onto vehicles for transportation of packed refrigerators from the manufacturing location to a distal location. As such refrigerators were loaded manually onto a vehicle and whereby the efficiency of such an operation was reduced considerable. Further, a manual loading of such refrigerators often resulted in a damage to the refrigerators.<br>
Yet another disadvantage by the known manual operation of loading was that by tilting of the packed refrigerator, and whereby oil and refrigerant enters the system.<br>
Instead of a manual operation, a fork lift could be employed, but which is not a continuous operation.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a device for loading and unloading of products such as a refrigerator, from a lower to an elevated location and vice versa.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a device for loading and unloading of products such as refrigerator, from a lower to an elevated location and vice versa and which can be effected as a continuous operation.<br><br>
Still another object of this invention is to purpose a device for loading and unloading of products such a a refrigerator, from a lower to an elevated location and vice versa which is efficient.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a device for loading and unloading of products such as a refrigerator, from a lower to an elevated location and vice versa without causing any damage to the refrigerator.<br>
A further objet of this invention is to propose a device for loading and unloading of products such as a refrigerator, from a lower to an elevated location and vice versa which can be transported to any location.<br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided A device for the loading and unloading of products from a lower to an elevated location and vice-versa particularly loading/ unloading of refrigerator on to a vehicle wherein the device comprises of:-<br>
(i) a first platform (P1) and a second platform (P2) connected to a sprocket chain (SC) driven by sprocket (SP) in such a way that when platform (P1) is in elevated position, the platform P2is in a lowered position and vice-versa;<br>
(ii) a motive means (M) comprising a motor coupled to a reduction gear (RG) which is adapted to drive sprocket (SP) through a clutch (CL);<br>
(iii) a delivery means comprising a plurality of rotatable housings or tubular members ( TM ) each disposed on its fixed shaft (FS) with bearings (B1) being provided at either end;<br>
(iv) a frame (F) having two pillars (F1) and (F2) to rotatably support set of rollers (NR);<br>
(v)      a control member (CM) adapted to control the functions of drive means;<br>
(vi)     a trolley (TR), to support the device.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION   OF  INVENTION   WITH   REFERENCE   TO   ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and wherein:<br>
Fig. 1   shows a front sectional view of the loading apparatus of the present invention; Fig.2   shows the drive system; Fig. 3   shows the delivery system.<br>
Referring to the drawings, the apparatus comprises a first platform P1 and a second platform P2 and such that when platform PI is in an elevated position platform P2 is in a lowered position and vice versa. Thus, in a lowered position of either of platforms P1 or P2, the article or the refrigerator is loaded onto said platform. When the platform P1 or P2 is in a raised or elevated position, the refrigerator is discharged onto a vehicle through the delivery means as particularly illustrated in Fig. 3. The delivery means comprise a plurality of rotatable housings or tubular members TM each disposed on its fixed shaft FS. Bearings BI are provided at other ends.<br>
The apparatus further comprises a frame F having two pillars F1 and F2 to rotatably support rollers NR. Each of platforms P1 andP2 is connected to its respective set of rollers NR. Rollers NR facilitate a raising and lowering of platforms P1 and P2 along stationery F1 and F2.<br><br>
The drive means are illustrated in Fig.3 and comprise a motor M coupled to a reduction gear RG.   Reduction gear RG drives a sprocket SP through a clutch CL. Platforms P1 and P2 are connected to a sprocket chain SC, said chain driven by said sprocket SP. A control member CM controls the function of the drive means, such as the raising or lowering of platforms P1and P2 and the on/off functions. The complete apparatus is supported on a trolley TR1.<br><br><br><br>
We claim<br>
1. A device for the loading and unloading of products from a lower to an elevated location and vice-versa particularly loading/ unloading of refrigerator on to a vehicle wherein the device comprises of:-<br>
(i) a first platform (P1) and a second platform (P2) connected to a sprocket chain (SC) driven by sprocket (SP) in such a way that when platform (P1) is in ekvated position, the platform P2 is in a lowered position and vice-versa;<br>
(ii) a motive means (M) comprising a motor coupled to a reduction gear (RG) which is adapted to drive sprocket (SP) through a clutch (CL);<br>
(iii) a delivery means comprising a plurality of rotatable housings or tubular members ( TM ) each disposed on its fixed shaft (FS) with bearings (Bi) being provided at either end;<br>
(iv) a frame (F) having two pillars (F1) and (F2) to rotatably support set of rollers (NR);<br>
(v)      a control member (CM) adapted to control the functions of drive means;<br>
(vi)     a trolley (TR), to support the device.<br><br>
2. A device for the loading and unloading of products from a lower to an elevated location and vice-versa particularly loading/ unloading of refrigerator on to a vehicle as substantially herein described and illustrated.<br></td>
