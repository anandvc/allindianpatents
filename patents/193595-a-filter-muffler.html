with  a  housing The    invention   relates    to    a    filter   muffler<br>
such    as    is    described    in    the    preamble    of    the    first<br>
claim.<br>
A   filter   muffler   of   this   type   is   known,    for<br>
example,  .from  EP  0,574,605  Al.<br>
Discussion  of  Background	<br>
Filter mufflers of this type are used, for example, on the intake side of a compressor which compresses combustion air and which feeds it to an internal combustion engine. A compressor of this type is driven by the exhaust-gas turbine of an exhaust-gas turbocharger.<br>
In this case, sound waves of undesirably high amplitude occur predominantly in the compressor impeller and are released into the environment through the air intake duct. These sound waves are therefore usually damped by means  of  a  muffler.<br>
For this purpose, ambient air flows through a filter, arranged on the circumference of a muffler, into the muffler interior equipped with dumping elements, subsequently flows past the damping elements, and is deflected by guide elements to the compressor impeller, from . which sound waves emanate in the opposite direction to the airflow. Muffling takes place on the damping elements by dissipation, in that the sound energy is converted directly into heat by means of porous or fibrous absorption materials, of which the damping elements are essentially composed. The abovementioned EP 0,574,605 Al describes a filter muffler which consists of a cast monobloc and in the radiated    ribs    of    witch,    having    grooves,    the    damping<br><br>
elements are arranged. A filter frame, consisting of a removable perforated plate part, surrounds the muffler in such a way that the damping elements are secured against falling out radially. The perforated plate part is arranged annularly around the muffler by means of connecting elements.<br>
A disk-shaped damping element consists of four damping<br>
segments which, when assembled, form an annular surface. An<br>
absorption element is held by two punched perforated plates<br>
and thus forms a damping segment which is introduced<br>
radially into the grooves of the abovementioned ribs of^ the<br>
cast  monobloc.	
The edges of the damping segments punched from perforated plate have an adverse effect on the design of this filter muffler. These edges of the damping segments having the form of ring segments are not treated further after being punched out and therefore have isolated plate webs on account of the plate perforation. These plate webs may break off as a result of mechanical vibrations, to which the filter muffler as a whole is exposed, and the broken-off pieces may subsequently pass, together with intake air, into the compressor and into the combustion space of an internal combustion engine and damage the latter. At the locations where plate webs are broken out, the damping material then swells and consequently impairs the flow properties of the air  inlet  ducts.<br>
The deflection by guide elements on the damping elements have a further unfavorable effect on the flow properties of the air, since compression losses of undesirable magnitude occur  as  a  result  of  said  guide  elements.<br>
SUMMARY  OF  THE   INVENTION<br>
The   object   on  which   the   invention   is   based   is   to<br>
develop   further  a   filter  muffler  of  the   initially  mentioned<br>
type,    to   the   effect   that   the   abovementioned   disadvantages<br>
are    reduced    or    avoided.    At    the    same    time,    the    damping<br><br>
properties of the muffler are to be improved, and the outlay in  terms  of  manufacture  and  of  assembly  is  to  be  reduced.<br>
This object is achieved, according to the invention,   by  means  of  the  features  of  the  first  claim.<br>
The advantages of the invention are to be seen inter alias in that now only damping elements which are of identical type are used and, at the same time, now only consist of two parts, namely a damping plate and an absorption  element.<br>
The reduction in the number of different components is<br>
advantageous particularly with regard to the logistic<br>
outlay.	^<br>
The closed edges of the damping plates are likewise advantageous, said edges extending along the perforated plate webs and therefore having no isolated plate webs.<br>
The coarse filter which surrounds the filter muffler is divided segmentally, and the segments are arranged on the damping plates, so that the coarse filter as an  individual  component  is  dispensed  with.<br>
Advantageous, furthermore, is the arrangement of a cast-in tube as a washing device for the compressor impeller in the housing wall of the connection side of the filter muffler.<br>
This tube is connected to a supply conduit which does not have to be guided round the muffler, as in conventional mufflers, because the connection of said supply conduit to the washing device is arranged on the closing-off side  of  the  filter  muffler.<br>
It is advantageous, furthermore, that the air is guided between adjacent damping plates in muffler ducts of constant cross section, and therefore, during intake, the air experiences a constant velocity, with the result that only  minor  compression  losses  occur.<br>
It is particularly expedient if, on account of the good     damping     properties,     an     open-cell     foam    with     high<br><br>
elasticity is used as an absorption material in the damping elements.   In comparison<br>
»<br>
with wool felt as an absorption material, an appreciable reduction in weight of the filter muffler as a whole is achieved at the same time with this type of foam.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a filter muffler with a housing which is designed as a monobloc and in which a plurality of damping elements consisting of damping plates and absorption elements are arranged, the housing form of the filter muffler having a central axis, wherein a damping element consists of only one damping plate which surrounds only one absorption element, and wherein the damping elements are arranged in radial grooves of the housing walls of a filter muffler housing in a way that air inlet ducts are formed between adjacent damping elements and, at the same time, the damping surfaces of the damping elements are oriented parallel to the central axis of the housing.<br><br>
A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily obtained as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered^ in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein the invention is explained below by means of diagrammatic representations   of  an  exemplary  embodiment.<br>

DESCRIPTION  OF  THE   PREFERRED  EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, in Figure 1 there is a circular-cylindrical filter muffler which is composed essentially of a housing 2, of a number of damping elements 3,   here  thirty  three,   and  of  a  filter  4.<br>
Figure 2 shows the housing 2 which is cast as a monobloc from aluminum and of which the housing wall 5 on the connection side 20 of the filter muffler is connected by means of connecting webs 7 to the housing wall 6 on-i1;he closing-off side 21. Cast in on the insides of the housing walls 5, 6 are grooves 8 in the form of an arc of a circle which narrow towards the inner radius of the filter muffler. The cross sectional area of the connecting web 7 is equal in form and curvature to a groove 8, and the distribution of the thirty three grooves 8 and of the three connecting webs 7 takes place uniformly over the circumference of the housing  in  a   10**   division.<br>
Arranged between adjacent grooves 8 and between grooves 8 and an adjacent connecting web 7 are webs 14 which have a constant width from the outer circumference of the housing 2 to  the  inner  radius  in.<br>
Arranged on the connection side 20 is a connection flange 22, by means of which the filter muffler is mounted on the compressor side of an exhaust-gas turbocharger not shown here.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, a tube 18 with a thread 19 is cast in in the radial direction into the housing wall 5 on the connection side 20, said tube being angled towards the connection side 20 at the end pointing to the central axis 13 of the housing 2. This tube serves as a washing device for the compressor impeller, not shown here, and is connected directly, on the thread 19, to a conduit, likewise not  shown,   on  the  connection  side  20  of  the  filter  muffler.<br><br>
The damping elements 3 are secured against falling out by tightening straps 16 which are closed on the circumference of the housing 2 by means of quick-action fastenings 17. The filter muffler is surrounded on its circumference by an annular filter 4 made of polyurethane foam (PU foam), which filters out particles in ambient intake air. In the unassembled state, the circular circumference of the annular filter 4 is smaller than the outer circumference of the filter muffler, so that the filter 4, which is produced electrometrically from PU foam, is fixed to the circumference of  the  muffler  by  spring  force.<br>
Figures 4 and 5 show the two components of , a damping element 3, namely a damping plate 9 and an absorption  element   10.<br>
During manufacture, the damping plate 9 is punched in the form of a rectangle from perforated plate with square holes along the perforation webs and therefore has no isolated webs. The rectangular perforated plate is subsequently bent in such a way as to form a concave surface 12 which has a convex surface II adjoining it. The convex surface II has adjoining it a plane surface 15 which is bent as a coarse filter segment 15. The concave surface 12 and the convex surface II extend approximately parallel and form an interspace 23, into which the absorption element 10, Figure 5, is inserted. An absorption element 10 is thicker than the interspace 23, so that, when the absorption element 10 is inserted into the interspace 23, the surfaces II, 12 are to be bent apart elastically. After the insertion of the absorption elements 10 into the interspace 23, these are clamped, on account of their thickness, between the surfaces 11,   12.<br>
The material used for an absorption element 10 is an open-cell foam which, whilst having identical decamping properties, has only approximately 6% of the specific gravity of conventional absorption materials, such as wool felt. The absorption    elements     10    shown    in    Figure    5     are    cut    out<br><br>
rectangular   from   foam   boards   and   are   shown   here   merely bent,   as  in  their  installed  state.<br>
Figure 6 shows, by means of a cross sectional segment of a filter muffler, the arrangement of the damping elements 3, consisting of the damping plate 9 and of the absorption element 10, in the circular-cylindrical housing 2 having the central axis 13. The damping elements 3 are pushed radially into the grooves 8 and are arranged in such a way that their damping surfaces 11, 12 extend parallel to the  central  axis  13  of  the  housing  2.<br>
The width of the webs 14 and therefore also the cross sectional area of the air inlet ducts 24 between adjacent damping elements 3 are constant from the outer circumference of the filter muffler towards the central axis 13, thereby guaranteeing a constant velocity of ambient intake air. As a result of this arrangement, compression losses, such as occur in conventional muffler systems, are reduced. On the outer circumference of the housing 2, the coarse filter segments 15 of the installed damping plates 9 are assembled to form a coarse filter ring, so that a coarse filter as an individual component is dispensed with. An arrangement in the form of an arc of a circle of the damping elements 3 in the housing 2 lengthens the air inlet ducts 24 and therefore the path of the sound waves in comparison with air inlet ducts extending purely radially, such as occur in conventional filter mufflers having the same outer circumference. This lengthening of the damping path alone, along with the same dimensions as conventional filter  mufflers,   improves  the  muffling.<br>
Altogether, the reduction in components and the use of masculine foam as an absorption material not only achieve a decrease in the total weight of the filter muffler by approximately 20%, but at the same time reduce the logistic  outlay.<br>
Of course, the invention is not restricted to the exemplary  embodiment  shown  and  described.   Thus,   for  example.<br><br>
the use of damping and filter materials other than those described above is likewise conceivable within the meaning of  the  invention.<br>
Obviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that, within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise  than  as  specifically  described  herein.<br><br>
