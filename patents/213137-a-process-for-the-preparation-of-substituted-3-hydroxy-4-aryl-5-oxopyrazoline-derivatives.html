Depending on the substituents Ro to R5, G and Go, the compounds of formulae I and la may be in the form of geometric and/or optical isomers or isomeric mixtures (atropisomers) and, when G is hydrogen, a metal ion equivalent, or an ammonium, sulfonium or phosphonium cation, they may be in the form of tautomers or tautomeric mixtures.<br>
If the starting materials employed are not enantiomerically pure, the compounds of formulae I and la obtained in the above-described processes are generally in the form of racemates or diastereoisomeric mixtures which, if desired, can be separated on the basis of their physicochemical properties according to known methods, such as, for example, fractional crystallisation following salt formation with optically pure bases, acids or metal complexes, or by chromatographic procedures, such as, for example, high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on acetyl cellulose.<br>
In the present invention, the compounds of formulae I and la are to be understood as both the enriched and optically pure forms of the respective stereoisomers as well as the racemates and diastereoisomers. Unless there is specific reference to the individual optical antipodes, the given formulae are to be understood as the racemic mixtures that have been obtained by the preparation process according to the invention. When an aliphatic C=C double bond is present, geometric isomerism may also occur.<br>
The present invention relates also to the salts that the compounds of formulae I and la are able to form with acids. Suitable acids for the formation of the acid addition salt include both organic and inorganic acids. Examples of such acids are hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acids, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, fumaric acid, organic sulfonic acids, lactic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid and salicylic acid.<br>
In view of their acidity, the compounds of formula I wherein G is hydrogen can readily be converted in the presence of bases (proton acceptors) into the corresponding salts (wherein G is, for example, a metal ion equivalent or an ammonium cation), as described, for example, in EP-A-0 508 126. Any customary proton acceptor may be used as base. The<br><br>
salts are, for example, alkali metal salts, for example sodium and potassium salts; alkaline earth metal salts, for example calcium and magnesium salts; ammonium salts, that is to say, unsubstituted ammonium salts and mono- or poly-substituted ammonium salts, for example triethylammonium and methylammonium salts, or salts with other organic bases or other cations, for example sulfonium or phosphonium cations. Sulfonium cations include, for example, tri(Ci-C4alkyl)sulfonium cations, which can be obtained from the corresponding alkali metal salts, for example, by salt conversion, for example using a cation exchanger.<br>
Among the alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides as salt formers, special mention may be made, for example, of the hydroxides of lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium, but especially the hydroxides of sodium and potassium. Suitable salt formers are described, for example, in WO 97/41112.<br>

The compounds of formulae II and IV, IVa or IVb can be used in equimolar amounts, but an excess of from 5 to 50 mol % of the compound of formula IV, IVa or IVb can be of advantage.<br>
The reaction of compounds of formula II with compounds of formula IV, IVa or IVb is carried out at a reaction temperature of from O' to 200°C, a temperature range of from 80X to 150°C being preferred.<br>
Suitable inert organic solvents for the reaction of compounds of formula II with compounds of formula IV, IVa or IVb are, for example, aromatic, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydro-carbons, for example, benzene, toluene, the xylene isomers ortho-, meta* and para-xylene, cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane; halogenated hydrocarbons, for example chloro-benzene and the dichlorobenzene isomers 1,2-, 1,3-and 1,4-dichlorobenzene; ethers, for example dibutyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether, 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, 1,3-dioxolane and dioxane; nitriles, for example acetonitrile, propionitrile and benzonitrile; dialkyi sulfoxides, for example dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); amides and lactams, for example N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N,N-diethylformamide and N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP); alcohols, glycols (diols) and polyalcohols, for example propanol, butanol, cyclohexanol, ethylene glycol and 2-ethoxyethanol, and also, generally, carboxylic acids, for example acetic acid and propionic acid, or mixtures of those solvents.<br>

Special preference is given to toluene, the xylene isomers ortho-, meta- and para-xylene, methylcyclohexane, chlorobenzene and the dichlorobenzene isomers 1,2-, 1,3- and 1,4-dichlorobenzene.<br>
The reaction according to the invention is preferably carried out in an inert gas atmosphere, for example in a nitrogen or argon gas atmosphere.<br>
The condensation of compounds of formula II with compounds of formula IV can be carried out with or without the addition of a base. The same condensation reaction carried out with compounds of formula IVa or IVb (instead of compounds of formula IV) is advantageously<br><br>
carried out in the presence of a base. Suitable bases in that case include, for example, nitrogen bases generally, for example tertiary amines and pyridines, for example Ci-Ce-trialkylamines, quinuclidine and 4-dimethylaminopyridine, Further suitable bases are, for example, alkali metal alcoholates, for example sodium and potassium methanolate, sodium and potassium ethanolate and sodium and potassium tert-butanolate. It is also possible to use inorganic bases, for example alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydrides, such as sodium, potassium or calcium hydride, hydroxides, such as sodium or potassium hydroxide, carbonates, such as sodium or potassium carbonate, and hydrogen carbonates, such as sodium or potassium hydrogen carbonate, especially in the form of solutions in alcohol. Such bases are used in catalytic amounts or in a molar excess of up to 5 based on the compound of formula II.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention, an aromatic hydro¬carbon having a boiling point &gt; 80°C, for example xylene, is used as the reaction medium in which the reactants of formulae II and IV, IVa or IVb are dissolved. Preferably, the com¬pound of formula IV, IVa or IVb is used in an excess of from 5 to 20 mol % based on the compound of formula II. The reaction mixture is heated at reflux temperature for from 1 to 3 hours in an inert gas atmosphere, with or without the addition of a base when a compound of formula IV is used, and in the presence of an equimolar amount or an up to 5-fold excess of an organic base, such as triethylamine, when a compound of formula IVa or IVb is used. After cooling and the addition of dilute acid, the desired product (G = hydrogen) precipitates in the form of a crystalline solid and can be filtered off directly and washed with a suitable washing agent, for example water and/or hexane.<br>
