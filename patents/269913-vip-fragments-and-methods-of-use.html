				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to compositions and methods for therapeutic or prophylactic<br>
treatment of myocardial fibrosis or associated conditions. In particular this invention<br>
concerns compositions comprising certain active fragments of VIP and their use in the<br>
treatment of myocardial fibrosis.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be<br>
considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common<br>
general knowledge in the field.<br>
In myocardial fibrosis, heart muscle is replaced by fibrous or scar tissue. This can<br>
interfere with the flexibility of the heart muscle. It can lead to a decrease in function<br>
and, eventually, to overt heart failure. Use of VIP and certain fragments of VIP in<br>
therapeutic and prophylactic treatment of myocardial fibrosis and related conditions was<br>
described in PCT/AU2005/000835, incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.<br>
Conventional view of structure/function relationship with respect to VIP activity is<br>
that the N-terminal amino acid residues (1-5) are important and necessary for signal<br>
delivery once VIP binds to its receptor. Further, there are certain key amino acid<br>
residues throughout the VIP molecule, distal to the N-terminus, that are important for<br>
receptor binding. This would suggest that fragments of VIP lacking either the N-terminal<br>
residues or significant portions that encompass the receptor binding residues would not<br>
be fully functional. Earlier studies with two VIP fragments, described in<br>
PCT/AU2005/000835, indicate that such fragments of VIP could be active, at least in the<br>
treatment of myocardial fibrosis.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to identify additional fragments of VIP<br>
that are active in the treatment of conditions such as myocardial fibrosis, that would<br>
overcome certain disadvantages associated with using the entire VIP molecule or large<br>
portions thereof, or at least provide a useful alternative.<br><br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Despite the currently prevailing view, it was surprisingly found that activity of VIP<br>
and its fragments in the treatment and/or prevention of myocardial fibrosis is not<br>
curtailed by either deletion of the N-terminal residues of VIP or the majority of amino<br>
acid residues responsible for receptor binding.<br>
In a broad aspect, the invention relates to compositions for prophylactic or<br>
therapeutic treatment of myocardial fibrosis or an associated condition, such as<br>
hypertension, comprising a pharmaceutically effective amount of one or more functional<br>
vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) fragments. Most preferably, the (VIP) fragments<br>
have as a core sequence amino acid residues 6 to 10 of native VIP, or conservative<br>
substitutions thereof. However, they may also have as a core sequence amino acid<br>
residues 16 to 25 of native VIP, or conservative substitutions thereof.<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect the invention provides a composition for<br>
prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of myocardial fibrosis or an associated condition,<br>
the composition comprising a pharmaceutically effective amount of one or more<br>
functional vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) fragments having as a core sequence<br>
amino acid residues 6 to 10 of native VIP, or conservative substitutions thereof.<br>
The preferred active fragments of VIP are VIP(4-16), VIP(6-16), VIP(6-10),<br>
VIP(6-12), VIP(6-20) and VIP(6-24), with the proviso that fragments VIP (1-12) and<br>
VIP (6-28) are not included. However, the use of VIP fragments, including VIP (1-12)<br>
and VIP (6-28) for the treatment of myocardial fibrosis and other associated conditions<br>
such as hypertension are encompassed by the present invention<br>
The pharmaceutically effective amount of an active VIP fragment will vary<br>
according to the patient and/or with the severity of the disease or condition. These<br>
variables can be ascertained by one skilled in the art by routine experimentation. An<br>
appropriate dosage range, as a starting point, can be derived from dosages administered<br>
in the animal models described herein, or with reference to PCT/AU2005/000835.<br>
Accordingly, in a second aspect the invention provides a composition for<br>
prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of myocardial fibrosis or an associated condition,<br>
the composition comprising a pharmaceutically effective amount of one or more<br>
functional vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) fragments having as a core sequence<br>
amino acid residues 16 to 25 of native VIP, or conservative substitutions thereof.<br><br>
Accordingly, in a third aspect the invention provides a composition for<br>
prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of myocardial fibrosis or an associated condition,<br>
the composition comprising a pharmaceutically effective amount of one or more<br>
functional vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) fragments selected from the group<br>
consisting of VEP(4-16), V1P(6-16), VIP(6-10), VIP(6-12), VIP(10-28), VIP(16-28),<br>
VIP(6-20) and VIP(6-24), or conservative substitutions thereof.<br>
Accordingly, in a fourth aspect the invention provides a composition for<br>
prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of myocardial fibrosis or an associated condition,<br>
the composition comprising a pharmaceutically effective amount of one or more<br>
functional vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) fragments selected from the group listed in<br>
Table 1, or conservative substitutions thereof.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be administered in conjunction with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which may be any of those known in the art or<br>
devised hereafter and suitable for the intended use. As well as carriers, the<br>
pharmaceutical composition of the invention may include other ingredients, including<br>
dyes, preservatives, buffers and anti-oxidants, for example. The compositions of the<br>
present invention may also include other active agents useful in the treatment of<br>
cardiovascular conditions.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may take any suitable form, but<br>
is preferably suitable for administration by oral, intravenous, intramuscular or<br>
subcuticular routes. Other methods of administration such as patches, snuffs, nasal<br>
sprays and the like will be clear to those skilled in the art.<br>
According to a fifth aspect the invention provides a method of therapeutic<br>
treatment of myocardial fibrosis or an associated condition in a subject, the method<br>
including administering to the subject with myocardial fibrosis or an associated<br>
condition, a composition according to the invention.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be used to prevent or slow down<br>
progression of established myocardial fibrosis, as well as to reduce the degree of<br>
established fibrosis.<br>
According to a sixth aspect the invention provides a method of prophylactic<br>
treatment of myocardial fibrosis or an associated condition in a subject, the method<br>
including administering to the subject at risk of developing myocardial fibrosis or an<br>
associated condition, a composition according to the invention.<br><br>
With respect to prophylactic treatment it will be understood that such a treatment<br>
would benefit particularly subjects who are at risk of developing myocardial fibrosis or<br>
an associated condition. As an example of subjects in the risk category are those having<br>
hypertension, diabetes, myocarditis, ischaemic heart disease, drugs such as daunorubicin<br>
and others which are used in cancer chemotherapy, genetic predisposition, other<br>
conditions such as Conn's Syndrome and Phaeochromocytoma, high salt diet and the<br>
like. The prophylactic treatment may be used to prevent or slow down the development<br>
of fibrosis in the at risk group. High proportion of subjects may already have signs of<br>
early heart failure on echocardiography. For example such signs are present in nearly<br>
80% of patients with hypertension. The incidence in diabetics is even higher.<br>
According to a seventh aspect the invention provides a method of prophylactic or<br>
therapeutic treatment of congestive cardiac failure in a subject, the method including<br>
administering to the subject at risk of developing congestive cardiac failure, a<br>
pharmaceutical composition according to the invention.<br>
According to a eighth aspect the invention provides a method of reducing the<br>
levels, inhibiting or reducing the production, of pro-fibrotic mediators in a subject, the<br>
method including administering to the subject a composition according to the invention.<br>
According to an ninth aspect the invention provides a method of reducing<br>
collagen formation or enhancing collagen degradation in the cardiac muscle of a subject,<br>
the method including administering to the subject a composition according to the<br>
invention.<br>
According to a tenth aspect the invention provides a method of therapeutic or<br>
prophylactic treatment of hypertension, the method including administering to the<br>
subject a composition according to the invention.<br>
According to a eleventh aspect the invention provides a method of lowering blood<br>
pressure in a subject, the method including administering to a subject a a composition<br>
according to the invention.<br>
It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the pattern of use of the<br>
compositions of the invention may need to be altered for optimum effect. It may be<br>
necessary to take into account the nature of the disease or condition as well as its<br>
severity.<br>
The associated conditions, which may be subject to prevention or treatment by the<br>
compositions of the invention, may include left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic<br><br>
dysfunction, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, left ventricular dysfunction and congestive<br>
cardiac failure (for which myocardial fibrosis may be an underlying pathology). The<br>
associated condition may also include conditions which give rise to generation of<br>
profibrotic mediators or conditions which predispose a subject to myocardial fibrosis,<br>
such as for example hypertension and/or high salt intake, diseases such as diabetes and<br>
the like.<br>
Further aspect of the invention includes the use of a composition of the invention<br>
in the manufacture of a medicament for the prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of<br>
myocardial fibrosis, or an associated condition.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
It has now been found, quite surprisingly in view of the well accepted views held<br>
in this field, that VIP fragments lacking amino acids and motifs thought to be important<br>
for their function are nevertheless useful therapeutic agents to reverse or delay onset of<br>
myocardial fibrosis, or prevent onset of fibrosis in subjects at risk of developing<br>
myocardial fibrosis. Thus, VIP fragments are also useful in the treatment of congestive<br>
cardiac failure.<br>
The use of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention in the treatment of<br>
myocardial fibrosis or associated conditions represents a new class of therapeutic agents<br>
for these conditions. Existing treatments for myocardial fibrosis or associated conditions<br>
usually target one, or at the most two, of the known causative mechanisms in myocardial<br>
fibrosis. Without wishing to be bound by any particular mechanism of action, it is<br>
believed that the pharmaceutical preparations of the invention may target virtually all the<br>
currently known promoters of myocardial fibrosis.<br>
On the basis of the present studies, and not wishing to be bound by theory, it is<br>
postulated that VIP fragments act as a major regulator to prevent the development of<br>
fibrosis and that the depletion of VIP may unleash the synthesis of a number of<br>
profibrotic mediators, thereby causing myocardial injury. The VIP fragments of the<br>
present invention seem to be able to act in much the same way as the native VIP but are<br>
more suited for therapeutic applications due to smaller size and hence increased stability<br>
and ease of manufacture.<br>
Further, and unexpectedly, a number of fragments lacking certain amino acid<br>
residues and domains commonly thought to be important for its function have been<br>
shown to be active in the present studies. Particularly useful fragments are VIP(6-16),<br>
VIP(16-28), VIP(10-28), VIP(6-12), VIP(6-10), VIP(6-20), VIP(6-24) and VIP(4-16).<br>
Further, fragments listed in Table 1 are also expected to be useful in the methods of the<br>
present invention. Fragments VIP(1-12) and VIP(6-28) have been described earlier and<br><br>
are not included in the present invention. It will be understood that the present invention<br>
also encompasses within its scope certain analogues of the VIP fragments which are<br>
based on conservative substitution of one or more amino acids of the VIP fragments with<br>
amino acids which do not alter the biological activities of the VIP fragments. Such<br>
substitutions would be well known to those skilled in the art and would not require more<br>
than simple trial-and-error using well established techniques. Hence, the term "VIP<br>
fragment" as used in the context of the present invention is intended to encompass such<br>
analogues.<br>
Other useful VIP fragments are listed in Table 1. All the sequences relate to VIP<br>
and fragments of human origin but due to the very high level of amino acid<br>
conservation, VIP and fragments thereof derived from other mammalian species are also<br>
contemplated and encompassed by the present invention.<br>
The present invention also contemplates pharmaceutical compositions which<br>
include active VIP fragments. Such compositions may include any type of dosage form<br>
such as tablets, capsules, powders, liquid formulations, delayed or sustained release,<br>
patches, snuffs, nasal sprays and the like. The formulations may additionally include<br>
other ingredients such as dyes, preservatives, buffers and anti-oxidants, for example.<br>
The physical form and content of the pharmaceutical formulations contemplated are<br>
conventional preparations that can be formulated by those skilled in the pharmaceutical<br>
formulation field and are based on well established principles and compositions<br>
described in, for example, Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 19th<br>
Edition, 1995; British Pharmacopoeia 2000 and similar formulation texts and manuals.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may also include other active agents useful in<br>
the treatment of cardiovascular conditions.<br>
The route and frequency of administration of the compositions of the present<br>
invention will depend on the treatment requirements and the nature of the molecule to be<br>
administered. Thus the formulations may be suitably prepared for administration by<br>
intravenous, intramuscular or subcuticular injection. VIP fragments may also be suitable<br>
for mucosal administration such as oral, sublingual, nasal and the like. These parameters<br>
are easily established by those skilled in the art.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention have been shown to be effective<br>
in preventing or slowing down progression of established myocardial fibrosis, as well as<br>
in reducing the degree (reversal) of established fibrosis and thus important in therapeutic<br><br>
applications. The compositions of the present invention are also useful for prophylactic<br>
or therapeutic treatment of congestive cardiac failure. These are important findings with<br>
respect to the range and severity of conditions which can be treated with the<br>
compositions of the present invention.<br>
Further, the compositions of the present invention may be used prophylactically in<br>
subjects at risk of developing myocardial fibrosis or an associated condition. As an<br>
example of subjects in the risk category are those having hypertension, diabetes,<br>
myocarditis, ischaemic heart disease, drugs such as daunorubicin and others which are<br>
used in cancer chemotherapy, genetic predisposition, other conditions such as Conn's<br>
Syndrome and Phaeochromocytoma, high salt diet and the like. The term "prophylactic"<br>
as used in the context of the present invention is intended inter alia to encompass<br>
treatments used to prevent or slow down the development of fibrosis in the at risk group.<br>
High proportion of subjects which may be given prophylactic treatment may already<br>
have signs of early heart failure on echocardiography.<br>
The term " associated condition" as used in the context of the present invention<br>
and in reference to myocardial fibrosis is intended to encompass, without limitation, left<br>
ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, left<br>
ventricular dysfunction and congestive cardiac failure (for which myocardial fibrosis<br>
may be an underlying pathology). The associated condition may also include conditions<br>
which give rise to generation of profibrotic mediators or conditions which predispose a<br>
subject to myocardial fibrosis, such as for example hypertension and/or high salt intake,<br>
diseases such as diabetes and the like.<br>
By conserving the VIP content of the cardiac muscle in a subject with, or at risk of<br>
developing, myocardial fibrosis or associated condition, through the use of the<br>
compositions of the present invention significant therapeutic benefits can be achieved<br>
including reduction of fibrosis, reduction in the level, production or activity of pro-<br>
fibrotic mediators, reduction in progression of fibrosis, reduction in collagen formation<br>
or enhancing collagen degradation in the cardiac muscle.<br>
The invention will now be described more particularly with reference to non-<br>
limiting examples.<br><br><br>
EXPERIMENTAL<br>
All general methodology and techniques have been described in detail in<br>
PCT/AU2005/000835, incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.<br>
Example 1. — Effect of VIP fragment infusion on fibrosis in animal models of fibrosis<br>
Four animal models of myocardial fibrosis were used (animals obtained from<br>
Australian Animal Resources, Perth, Western Australia, Australia)<br>
i) WKY rat fed a high salt diet<br>
ii) WKY rat fed a high salt diet and given L-NAME (ω-monomethyl-nitro-L-<br>
arginine, Sigma Chemical Co.) 10 mg/kg/day in the drinking water<br>
iii) WKY rats with diabetes induced by streptozotocin injection 60 mg/kg<br>
iv) SHR rat fed a 2.2% salt diet for 4 weeks<br>
In each model the rats were randomised to VIP(4-16) (Ala-Val-Phe-Thr-Asp-<br>
Asn-Tyr-Thr-Arg-Leu-Arg-Lys-Gln), VIP(6-16) (Phe-Thr-Asp-Asn-Tyr-Thr-Arg-Leu-<br>
Arg-Lys-Gln), VIP(4-20)(Ala-Val-Phe-Thr-Asp-Asn-Tyr-Thr-Arg-Leu-Arg-Lys-Gln-<br>
Met-Ala-Val-Lys-), or VIP(4-24) (Ala-Val-Phe-Thr-Asp-Asn-Tyr-Thr-Arg-Leu-Arg-<br>
Lys-Gln-Met-Ala- Val-Lys-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asn), VIP( 16-28) (Gin-Met-Ala-Val-Lys-Lys-<br>
Tyr-Leu-Asn-Ser-IIe-Leu-Asn), VIP(10-28) (Tyr-Thr-Arg-Leu-Arg-Lys-Gln-Met-Ala-<br>
Val-Lys-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asn-Ser-IIe-Leu-Asn), VIP(6-12) (Phe-Thr-Asp-Asn-Tyr-Thr-<br>
Arg), VIP(6-10) (Phe-Thr-Asp-Asn-Tyr), VIP(6-20) (Phe-Thr-Asp-Asn-Tyr-Thr-Arg-<br>
Leu-Arg-Lys-Ghi-Met-Ala-Val-Lys-), or VIP(6-24) (Phe-Thr-Asp-Asn-Tyr-Thr-Arg-<br>
Leu-Arg-Lys-Gln-Met-Ala-Val-Lys-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asn) (All obtained from or<br>
synthesised by Auspep, Australia) or vehicle control (Hartman's Solution, Baxter)<br>
infusion for 4 weeks via Alzet minipump (n=6-8 each experimental group). The dose of<br>
each peptide was 5 pmol/kg/min.<br>
In models i) and ii) 14 week old WKY rats were commenced on high salt diet or<br>
high salt diet plus L-NAME. They underwent operative insertion of an Alzet minipump<br>
for infusion of VIP or vehicle. After 4 weeks the rats were anaesthetised and the hearts<br>
harvested. Myocardial fibrosis levels were quantitated.<br>
In model iii) rats are injected with streptozotocin 60mg/kg at 14 weeks of age.<br>
After 8 weeks the diabetic rats are randomised to peptide infusion (5pmol/kg/min) or no<br>
treatment. The peptides are administered as above. After a further 4 weeks the rats are<br>
anaesthetised and the hearts harvested as above.<br><br>
In model iv) 14 week old SHR rats are commenced on a 2.2% salt diet. They<br>
undergo operative insertion of an Alzet minipump for peptide or vehicle infusion. After<br>
4 weeks the rats are anaesthetised and the hearts harvested. Myocardial fibrosis levels<br>
are quantitated as above.<br>
The degree of myocardial fibrosis is quantitated by two methods in known manner<br>
(refer Ye VZC, Hodge G, Yong JLC &amp; Duggan KA (2002) Early myocardial fibrosis is<br>
associated with depletion of vasoactive intestinal peptide in the heart Exp. Physiol<br>
87:539-546 Ye VZC, Hodge G, Yong JLC &amp; Duggan KA (2003) Myocardial VIP and<br>
myocardial fibrosis induced by nitric oxide synthase inhibition in the rat Acta Physiol.<br>
Scand. 179:353-360. Ye VZC, Hodge G, Yong JLC &amp; Duggan KA (2004)<br>
Vasopeptidase inhibition reverses myocardial VIP depletion and decreases myocardial<br>
fibrosis in salt sensitive hypertension Europ. J. Pharmacol. 485:235-242).<br>
A significant improvement was found in the hearts of the treated rats in that the<br>
myocardial fibrosis index was significantly lower in the treated rats compared to the<br>
control groups (Figure 1).<br>
Example 2 - Effect of VIP fragment treatment on regression of fibrosis in animal<br>
models of fibrosis.<br>
To determine whether VIP (6-16), VIP(6-20) and VIP(6-24). infusion caused<br>
regression of existing fibrosis as well as prevented progression of fibrosis two groups of<br>
studies were performed. The degree of myocardial fibrosis in untreated 14 week old<br>
WKY rats was compared with the degree of fibrosis in 18 week old WKY rats after 4<br>
weeks treatment with a high salt diet or a high salt diet plus L-NAME (10mg/kg/day)<br>
and either VIP (6-16), VIP(6-20) and VIP(6-24) (5pmol/kg/min) or vehicle control<br>
infusion (see Figure 2)<br>
Preliminary results are shown in Figure 2. The data clearly show regression of<br>
myocardial fibrosis following VIP(6-16) infusion. The regression of fibrosis may be due<br>
to either reduction in collagen formation or enhancement of its degradation. Although<br>
not wishing to be bound by any particular mechanism of action, the regression of<br>
myocardial fibrosis is likely to be due to the action of collagenases, which play a part in<br>
collagen resorption.<br>
The importance of the present invention to health care will be immediately<br>
apparent to one skilled in the art upon reading this disclosure. Although the capacity to<br><br>
treat cardiac failure has improved significantly with the advent of angiotensin converting<br>
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, as well as the realisation<br>
that aldosterone antagonists and beta blockers improve outcome in later stage disease,<br>
the addition of the pharmaceutical preparations of the invention, which act to prevent the<br>
progression of the underlying lesion (fibrosis), or even reverse fibrosis, has the capacity<br>
to prevent the escalation of mild to severe disease and hence to substantially reduce the<br>
health care burden. The overall size of certain VIP fragments and their activity makes<br>

hypertension.<br>
To determine whether VIP and fragments were effective in controlling blood<br>
pressure, Spontaneous Hypertensive Rats (SHR) were acclimated to blood pressure<br>
measurement by tail cuff plethysmography and then they were placed on a 2.2% salt diet<br>
for 4 weeks.<br>
The rats were randomized to Control (Hartman's Solution) vehicle-infusion,<br>
VIP(l-28)(His-Ser-Asp-Ala-Val-Phe-Thr-Asp-Asn-Tyr-Thr-Arg-Leu-Arg-Lys-Gln-<br>
Met-Ala-Val-Lys-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asn-Ser-Ile-Leu-Asn),VIP(4-10)(Ala-Val-Phe-Thr-<br>
Asp-Asn-Tyr), VIP(4-12) (Ala-Val-Phe-Thr-Asp-Asn-Tyr-Thr-Arg), VIP(4-16) (Ala-<br>
Val-Phe-Thr-Asp-Asn-Tyr-Thr-Arg-Leu-Arg-Lys-Gln),VIP(4-20)(Ala-Val-Phe-Thr-<br>
Asp-Asn-Tyr-Thr-Arg-Leu-Arg-Lys-Gm-Met-Ala-Val-Lys), VIP(4-24) (Ala-Val-Phe-<br>
Thr-Asp-Asn-Tyr-Thr-Arg-Leu-Arg-Lys-Gln-Met-Ala-Val-Lys-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asn),<br>
VIP(4-28)(Ala-Val-Phe-Thr-Asp-Asn-Tyr-Thr-Arg-Leu-Arg-Lys-Gln-Met-Ala-Val-<br>
Lys-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asn-Ser-IIe-Leu-Asn), VEP(6-10) (Phe-Thr-Asp-Asn-Tyr), VIP(6-12)<br>
(Phe-Thr-Asp-Asn-Tyr-Thr-Arg), VIP(6-16) (Phe-Thr-Asp-Asn-Tyr-Thr-Arg-Leu-Arg-<br>
Lys-Gln),VIP(6-20)(Phe-Thr-Asp-Asn-Tyr-Thr-Arg-Leu-Arg-Lys-Gm-Met-Ala-Val-<br>
Lys), VIP(6-24)(Phe-Thr-Asp-Asn-Tyr-Thr-Arg-Leu-Arg-Lys-Gln-Met-Ala-Val-Lys-<br>
Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asn), VIP(6-28)(Phe-Thr-Asp-Asn-Tyr-Thr-Arg-Leu-Arg-Lys-Gln-Met-<br>
Ala-Val-Lys-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asn-Ser-IIe-Leu-Asn), VIP(16-20) (Gln-Met-Ala-Val-Lys),<br>
VIP(16-24) (Gln-Met-Ala-Val-Lys-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asn), VIP(16-28) (Gln-Met-Ala-Val-<br>
Lys-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asn-Ser-Ile-Leu-Asn),VIP(l-12)(His-Ser-Asp-Ala-Val-Phe-Thr-<br><br>
Asp-Asn-Tyr-Thr-Arg) and VIP(10-28) (Tyr-Thr-Arg-Leu-Arg-Lys-Gln-Met-Ala-Val-<br>
Lys-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asn-Ser-IIe-Leu-Asn),VIP(4-10)(Ala-Val-Phe-Thr-Asp-Asn-Tyr).<br>
Each peptide was infused at 5pmol/kg/min.<br>
Blood pressure was measured by tail cuff plethysmography twice weekly for 4<br>
weeks.<br>
The resultant systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurements are shown in Figures<br>
6-9. Several of the fragments showed a reduction in SPB relative to the control solution.<br>
VIP itself was not seen to have any significant effect in reducing SBP, but a number of<br>
fragments, notably VIP(6-28), VIP(4-24), VIP(4-28), and more particularly VIP(4-16),<br>
VIP(4-12), VIP(4-20), VIP(6-20) and VIP(6-24) achieved significant reductions in SBP.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates to some extent the difficulty in predicting VIP fragment activity from<br>
structure. VIP(4-16) is less efficacious than either VIP(4-12), which has 4AA less, or<br>
VIP(4-20), which is 4AA longer.<br>
VIP(6-28) was disclosed in PCT/AU2005/000835 as being effective for<br>
preventing myocardial fibrosis.<br>
It is to be appreciated that other embodiments and variants of the compositions,<br>
methods and uses of the invention, in keeping with the teaching and the spirit of the<br>
invention described, are contemplated and that these are within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
