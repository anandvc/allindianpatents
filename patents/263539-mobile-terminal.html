DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THF, INVENTION<br>
[0036] Reference will now be made in detail to the exemplary embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Hereinafter, mobile terminals according to the present invention will be explained in more detail.<br>
4<br><br>
[0037] With reference to FIG. 1, a mobile terminal 10 includes a housing 20 having a display 15 disposed on a front surface thereof, and a cover 30 assembled on the housing 20 to form the overall exterior (appearance) of the mobile terminal. The cover 30 has a size and a shape for constituting a front surface of the mobile terminal 10 together with the display 15.<br>
[0038] Preferably, the display 15 is formed as a mirror in order to reflect light when the display 15 is turned off. Namely, an external window of the display 15 is made of a partially reflective material to allow an internal light to pass therethrough and reflect light coming from outside so that a user can use the display 15 as the mirror when the display 15 is in an OFF state.<br>
[0039] The housing 20 includes an upper housing 21 and a lower housing 22 assembled to the upper housing 21. In addition, the housing 20 may include additional members.<br>
[0040] As shown in FIG. 2, input switches 40 are disposed within the cover 30, and the cover 30 is installed to be deformable or movable to press the input switches 40. Accordingly, when the cover 30 is pressed, it is self-deformed or moved in a direction of to press the input switches 40. With reference to FIG. 4, the cover 30 is disposed to be movable and deformable in a pressing direction in a state that it is caught at the housing 20 by stopping portion 35 formed at an edge portion of the cover 30.<br>
[0041] While cover 30 has been called a cover, it is not so limited to just a cover, rather it can also be take the form of a casing, case, or frame and may also be shaped into a plate, a panel, a bracket, a band, or a strip.<br>
[0042] As shown in FIG. 4, the input switches 40 installed within the cover 30 are located on a circuitry supporting substrate 41 having a certain contact pattern and each input switch 40 is formed as a metallic dome 42 installed on the contact pattern such that it can be elastically deformable to contact the contact pattern. As the circuitry supporting substrate 41, a rigid or flexible board can be used, and a fixing sheet (not shown) can be additionally attached on an upper surface of the metallic dome 42 and the circuit board 41 to maintain the state that the metallic dome 42 is fixed on the contact pattern.<br>
[0043] The cover 30 can be made of a thin metallic plate material with certain strength, and light transmission openings 31 are formed to indicate where the input switches 40 are positioned<br>
5<br><br>
beneath the cover 30. A stopping portion 35 is formed at an edge portion of the cover 30. The stopping portion 35 extends in a direction away from the front surface of the mobile terminal from an edge portion of the cover 30 and then outwards to engage an interior surface of the housing 20. Accordingly, because the stopping portion 35 allows the cover 30 to be caught by the housing 20, without being exposed, the exterior of the mobile terminal can be formed fine and smooth.<br>
[0044] As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, pressing protrusions 32 extend toward the metallic domes 42 and are attached within the light transmission openings 31 so that when the cover 30 is pressed by a finger of a user, the input switches 40 can be easily pressed. The pressing protrusions 32 can be attached on the cover 30 by means of an adhesive or in a mating manner. Alternatively, the pressing protrusions 32 can be integrally injection-molded with the cover.<br>
[0045] With reference to FIGS. 2 and 4, light emitters 45 are provided at one side of each of the input switches 40 to provide light to outside through the light transmission openings 31. Preferably, the light emitters 45 are formed as an element to be mounted on the circuit board 41. As the light emitters 45, light emitting diodes (LEDs) or semiconductor lasers can be used. The pressing protrusions 32 are made of a light transmissive material to allow light to pass therethrough so as to be viewable outside the mobile terminal.<br>
[0046] As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, shields 33 made of a light non-transmissive material are formed near the pressing protrusions 32 to prevent a light leakage from the light emitters 45. Either the pressing protrusions 32 or the shields 33 alone, or in combination, can form a light constraining member to direct light from the light emitter 45 towards the light transmission opening 31 and to minimize light emitted from the light emitter 45 from being directed peripherally of the light transmission opening 32. In this manner, the light from the light emitter 45 can be more efficiently utilized. Preferably, the pressing protrusion 32 and adjacent shield 33 can be formed as a unitary member out of a silicone material.<br>
[0047] The shields 33 have a size that can push the cover 30 in an outward direction so that the stopping portions 35 of the cover 30 can be maintained in a state of being elastically engaging the housing 20. Accordingly, when the cover 30 is not pressed from the exterior,<br>
6<br><br>
the cover 30 is maintained to be pressed against the housing 20 by elasticity of the shields 33. The pressing protrusions 32 can also assist in pressing the cover 30 against the housing 20.<br>
[0048] With such a structure, as shown in FIG. 1, the cover 30 is assembled with the housing 20 to form the overall exterior of the mobile terminal 10, and as shown in FIG. 4, when a particular portion of the cover 30 is pressed, the corresponding input switch 40 is pressed to perform an inputting operation. Accordingly, there is no need to use a device having a plurality of buttons, and thus, the exterior of the mobile terminal 10 can be aesthetically improved as well as reducing the number of components.<br>
[0049] With reference to FIG. 5, a mobile terminal 110 according to a second exemplary embodiment of the present invention includes a first body 111 including a first key input unit 112 having a plurality of buttons formed on a surface that is exposed when the mobile terminal 110 is in an open position, and a second body 113 slidably movable to be opened and closed with respect to the first body 111.<br>
[0050] As shown in FIG. 6, the second body 113 includes a housing 120 with a display 115 disposed on its upper surface, and a cover 130 combined with the housing 120 to form the exterior of the mobile terminal 110.<br>
[0051] A light transmission opening 136 is formed at the central portion of the cover 130, through which a second key input unit 150 including pressing buttons 151 and 152 and a scroll button 153 can pass so as to be mounted in the second body 113. Namely, surrounding the second key input unit 150, the cover 130 can form an exterior of the housing and also perform an input function independent of the second key input unit 150. Stopping portions 135 are similar to stopping portions 25 described above.<br>
[0052] Input switches 140,light emitters 145, and light constraining members located within the cover 130 have the same construction and operation as those in the first exemplary embodiment of the present invention, so a description therefore will be omitted. These elements are also the same in the third to fifth exemplary embodiments of the present invention and the light constraining members have not been shown for clarity.<br>
7<br><br>
[0053] In the third exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a cover 230 of a mobile terminal 210 has a size and a shape constituting a front surface of the mobile terminal 210, and the housing 220 forms the other remaining exterior of the mobile terminal 210. A through hole 237 is formed at the central portion of the cover 230, on which a display 215 is disposed, so that the cover 230 surrounds the display 215 and presses input switches 240 mounted at corner positions (indicated by dotted line arrows in FIG. 8) within the cover 230. Light transmission openings 231 are formed in the corner positions of the cover 230 above the input switches 240. Stopping portions 235 are similar to stopping portions 25 described above.<br>
[0054] In a mobile terminal 310 according to the fourth exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a cover 330 is formed as a one body at least partially including two adjacent surfaces of the mobile terminal 310. Each of the adjacent surfaces includes a light transmission opening 331 and input switch 340 associate therewith. Stopping portions 335 are similar to stopping portions 25 described above.<br>
[0055] Accordingly, as indicated by dotted line arrows, the cover 330 can be pressed in at least two directions to performing inputting.<br>
[0056] In the fifth exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the cover is formed as two cover portions 430A and 430B. Each of the cover portions 430A and 430B is formed as one body at least partially including three adjacent surfaces of the mobile terminal. Input switches 440A and 440B are installed at an inner side of each adjacent surface. Accordingly, the cover 330 can be pressed in the three directions as indicated by the dotted line arrows in FIG. 12 to perform an inputting operation. Light transmission openings 431 are provided on the adjacent surfaces, each being associated with corresponding input switches 440A and 440B. Stopping portions 435 are similar to stopping portions 25 described above.<br>
[0057] Accordingly the present invention provides the following effects and advantages.<br>
[0058] Because the cover forming the exterior of the mobile terminal is installed to be deformable or movable to press the input switches disposed within the housing, the cover can replace a general key input unit that has many different contours, and thus, the exterior of the mobile<br>
terminal can be aesthetically enhanced.<br>
8<br><br>
[0059] Because the pressable cover can surround the display or an additional key input unit and can be integrally formed including two adjacent surfaces of the mobile terminal, inputting operations can be performed in various directions and positions.<br>
[0060] The invention thus being described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.<br>
