PYRROLOPYRIMIDINES USEFUL AS INHIBITORS OF PROTEIN KINASE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0100] The present invention relates to compounds useful as inhibitors of Janus<br>
kinases (JAK). The invention also provides pharmaceutically acceptable compositions<br>
comprising the compounds of the invention and methods of using the compositions in<br>
the treatment of various disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0101] The Janus kinases (JAK) are a family of tyrosine kinases consisting of<br>
JAKl,JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. The JAKs play a critical role in cytokine signaling.<br>
The down-stream substrates of the JAK family of kinases include the signal transducer<br>
and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. JAK/STAT signaling has been<br>
implicated in the mediation of many abnormal immune responses such as allergies,<br>
asthma, autoimmune diseases such as transplant rejection, rheumatoid arthritis,<br>
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis as well as in solid and hematologic<br>
malignancies such as leukemias and lymphomas. JAK2 has also been implicated in<br>
myeloproliferative disorders, which include polycythemia vera, essential<br>
thrombocythemia, chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, myeloid metaplasia with<br>
myelofibrosis, chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, chronic<br>
eosinophilic leukemia, hypereosinophilic syndrome and systematic mast cell disease.<br>
[0102] The Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein serine/threonine kinase<br>
(ROCK) family are effectors of Ras-related small GTPase Rho. The ROCK family<br>
includes pl60ROCK (ROCK-1), ROKRho-kinase/ROCK-II, protein kinase PKN,<br>
and citron and citron kinase. ROCK has been implicated in various diseases and<br>
disorders including hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebral<br><br>
WO 2006/096270	PCT/US2006/004019<br>
vasospasm, coronary vasospasm, bronchial asthma, erectile dysfunction, glaucoma,<br>
vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, myocardial hypertrophy, malignoma,<br>
ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury, endothelial dysfunction, Crohn's Disease and<br>
colitis, neurite outgrowth, Raynaud's Disease, angina, Alzheimer's disease,<br>
atherosclerosis, and cardiac hypertrophy and perivascular fibrosis.<br>
[0103] Protein kinase A (PKA; also known as cAMP-dependent protein kinase)<br>
is a tetrameric holoenzyme, which contains two catalytic subunits bound to a homo-<br>
dimeric regulatory subunit (which acts to inhibit the catalytic sub-units). On binding of<br>
cAMP (enzyme activation), the catalytic subunits dissociate from the regulatory<br>
subunits to yield the active serine/threonine kinase. Three isoforms of the catalytic<br>
subunit (C-, C- and C-) have been reported to date, with the C- subunit being the<br>
most extensively studied, primarily because of its elevated expression in primary and<br>
metastatic melanomas. PKA has been shown to regulate many vital functions including<br>
energy metabolism, gene transcription, proliferation, differentiation, reproductive<br>
function, secretion, neuronal activity, memory, contractility and motility.<br>
[ 0104 ] Accordingly, there is a great need to develop compounds useful as<br>
inhibitors of protein kinases, including JAK family, ROCK and PKA kinases. In<br>
particular, it would be desirable to develop compounds that are useful as inhibitors of<br>
JAK2 and JAK3.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0105] It has now been found that compounds of this invention, and<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable compositions thereof, are effective as inhibitors of protein<br>
kinases, particularly the JAK family kinases. In certain embodiments, these<br>
compounds are effective as inhibitors of JAK3 protein kinases. These compounds have<br>
the general formula I:<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/096270 PCT/US2006/004019<br><br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein R1, R2, Z1, Z2, and Z3 are as<br>
defined below.<br>
[0106] These compounds, and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions<br>
thereof, are useful for treating or lessening the severity of a variety of disorders,<br>
including allergic disorders such as asthma and atopic dermatitis, autoimmune diseases<br>
such as SLE lupus and psoriasis, conditions associated with organ transplantation,<br>
myeloproliferative disorders, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and<br>
proliferative disorders such as melanoma.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Compounds and Definitions<br>
[0107 ] Compounds of this invention include those described generally above,<br>
and are further illustrated by the classes, subclasses, and species disclosed herein. As<br>
used herein, the following definitions shall apply unless otherwise indicated. For<br>
purposes of this invention, the chemical elements are identified in accordance with the<br>
Periodic Table of the Elements, CAS version, Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 75th<br>
Ed. Additionally, general principles of organic chemistry are described in "Organic<br>
Chemistry", Thomas Sorrell, University Science Books, Sausalito: 1999, and "March's<br>
Advanced Organic Chemistry", 5th Ed., Ed.: Smith, M.B. and March, J., John Wiley &amp;<br>
Sons, New York: 2001, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
[0108] As described herein, compounds of the invention may optionally be<br>
substituted with one or more substituents, such as are illustrated generally above, or as<br>
exemplified by particular classes, subclasses, and species of the invention. It will be<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/096270	PCT/US2006/004019<br>
appreciated that the phrase "optionally substituted" is used interchangeably with the<br>
phrase "substituted or unsubstituted." In general, the term "substituted", whether<br>
preceded by the term "optionally" or not, refers to the replacement of hydrogen radicals<br>
in a given structure with the radical of a specified substituent. Unless otherwise<br>
indicated, an optionally substituted group may have a substituent at each substitutable<br>
position of the group, and when more than one position in any given structure may be<br>
substituted with more than one substituent selected from a specified group, the<br>
substituent may be either the same or different at every position.<br>
[ 0109 ] As described herein, when the term "optionally substituted" precedes a<br>
list, said term refers to all of the subsequent substitutable groups in that list. For<br>
example, if X is halogen; optionally substituted C1-3alkyl or phenyl; X may be either<br>
optionally substituted alkyl or optionally substituted phenyl. Likewise, if the term<br>
"optionally substituted" follows a list, said term also refers to all of the substitutable<br>
groups in the prior list unless otherwise indicated. For example: if X is halogen, C1-.<br>
3alkyl or phenyl wherein X is optionally substituted by Jx, then both C1-3alkyl and<br>
phenyl may be optionally substituted by Jx. As is apparent to one having ordinary skill<br>
in the art, groups such as H, halogen, NO2, CN, NH2, OH, or OCF3 would not be<br>
included because they are not substitutable groups.<br>
[0110] Combinations of substituents envisioned by this invention are preferably<br>
those that result in the formation of stable or chemically feasible compounds. The term<br>
"stable", as used herein, refers to compounds that are not substantially altered when<br>
subjected to conditions to allow for their production, detection, and preferably their<br>
recovery, purification, and use for one or more of the purposes disclosed herein. In<br>
some embodiments, a stable compound or chemically feasible compound is one that is<br>
not substantially altered when kept at a temperature of 40°C or less, in the absence of<br>
moisture or other chemically reactive conditions, for at least a week.<br>
[0111] As described herein, a bond drawn from a substituent to the center of<br>
one ring within a multiple-ring system (as shown below), represents substitution of the<br>
substituent at any substitutable position in any of the rings within the multiple ring<br>
system. For example, Figure a represents possible substitution in any of the positions<br>
shown in Figure b.<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/096270	PCT/US2006/004019<br><br>
[ 0112 ] This also applies to multiple ring systems fused to optional ring systems<br>
(which would be represented by dotted lines). For example, in Figure c, X is an<br>
optional substituent both for ring A and ring B.<br><br>
[ 0113 ] If, however, two rings in a multiple ring system each have different<br>
substituents drawn from the center of each ring, then, unless otherwise specified, each<br>
substituent only represents substitution on the ring to which it is attached. For example,<br>
in Figure d, Y is an optionally substituent for ring A only, and X is an optional<br>
substituent for ring B only.<br><br>
[0114 ] The term "aliphatic" or "aliphatic group", as used herein, means a<br>
straight-chain (i.e., unbranched) or branched, substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon<br>
chain that is completely saturated or that contains one or more units of unsaturation.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, aliphatic groups contain 1-20 aliphatic carbon atoms. In<br>
some embodiments, aliphatic groups contain 1-10 aliphatic carbon atoms. In other<br>
embodiments, aliphatic groups contain 1-8 aliphatic carbon atoms. In still other<br>
embodiments, aliphatic groups contain 1-6 aliphatic carbon atoms, and in yet other<br>
embodiments aliphatic groups contain 1-4 aliphatic carbon atoms. Suitable aliphatic<br>
groups include, but are not limited to, linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted<br>
alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl groups. Further examples of aliphatic groups include methyl,<br>
ethyl, propyl, butyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, vinyl, and sec-butyl.<br>

[ 0115 ] The term "cycloaliphatic" (or "carbocycle" or "cycloalkyl") refers to a<br>
monocyclic C3-C8 hydrocarbon or bicyclic C8-C12 hydrocarbon that is completely<br>
saturated or that contains one or more units of unsaturation, but which is not aromatic,<br>
that has a single point of attachment to the rest of the molecule wherein any individual<br>
ring in said bicyclic ring system has 3-7 members. Suitable cycloaliphatic groups<br>
include, but are not limited to, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, and cycloalkynyl. Further<br>
examples of aliphatic groups include cyclopentyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexyl,<br>
cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and cycloheptenyl.<br>

"heterocyclic" as used herein means non-aromatic, monocyclic, bicyclic, or tricyclic<br>
ring systems in which one or more ring members are an independently selected<br>
heteroatom. In some embodiments, the "heterocycle", "heterocyclyl",<br>

which one or more ring members is a heteroatom independently selected from oxygen,<br>
sulfur, nitrogen, or phosphorus, and each ring in the system contains 3 to 7 ring<br>
members.<br>

phosphorus, or silicon (including, any oxidized form of nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, or<br>
silicon; the quaternized form of any basic nitrogen or; a substitutable nitrogen of a<br>
heterocyclic ring, for example N (as in 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrolyI), NH (as in<br>

-NRC(O)NR-, -OC(O)NR-, -NRSO2NR-, -SO-, or -SO2-, wherein R is defined herein.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, the optional replacements form a chemically stable<br>
compound. Optional interruptions can occur both within the chain and at either ends of<br>
the chain; both at the point of attachment and also at the terminal end. Two optional<br>
replacements can also be adjacent to each other within a chain. Unless otherwise<br>
specified, if the replacement or interruption occurs at the terminal end, the replacement<br>
atom is bound to an H on the terminal end. For example, if -CH2CH2CH3 were<br>
optionally interrupted with -O-, the resulting compound could be -OCH2CH3,<br>
-CH2OCH3, or -CH2CH2OH.<br>

Uses, Formulations and Administration<br>
[0190] As discussed above, the present invention provides compounds that are<br>
inhibitors of protein kinases, including JAK family, ROCK and PKA kinases,<br>
particularly JAK2 and JAK3 kinases, and thus the present compounds are useful for<br>
the treatment of diseases, disorders, and conditions including, but not limited to,<br>
immunodeficiency disorders, inflammatory diseases, allergic diseases, autoimmune<br>
diseases, proliferative disorders, immunologically-mediated diseases, respiratory<br>
disorders. Accordingly, in another aspect of the present invention, phannaceutically<br>
acceptable compositions are provided, wherein these compositions comprise any of the<br>
compounds as described herein, and optionally comprise a pharmaceuticaUy acceptable<br>
31<br><br>
WO 2006/096270	PCT/US2006/004019<br>
carrier, adjuvant or vehicle. In certain embodiments, these compositions optionally<br>
further comprise one or more additional therapeutic agents.<br>
[ 0191] It will also be appreciated that certain of the compounds of present<br>
invention can exist in free form for treatment, or where appropriate, as a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof. According to the present invention, a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable derivative includes, but is not limited to, pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts, esters, salts of such esters, or any other adduct or derivative which<br>
upon administration to a patient in need is capable of providing, directly or indirectly, a<br>
compound as otherwise described herein, or a metabolite or residue thereof.<br>
[ 0192 ] As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to<br>
those salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in<br>
contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation,<br>
allergic response and the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk<br>
ratio. A "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" means any non-toxic salt of a compound of<br>
this invention.<br>
[0193 ] Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. For<br>
example, S. M. Berge et al., describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in J.<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences, 1977,66,1-19, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include those<br>
derived from suitable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group<br>
formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric<br>
acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic<br>
acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or malonic acid or by using <br>
other methods used in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts include adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate,<br>
bisulfate, borate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate,<br>

phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, stearate, succinate, sulfate,<br>
tartrate, thiocyanate, p-toluenesulfonate, undecanoate, valerate salts, and the like. Salts<br>
derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium<br>
and N+(C1-4alkyl)4 salts. This invention also envisions the quaternization of any basic<br>
nitrogen-containing groups of the compounds disclosed herein. Water or oil-soluble or<br>
dispersible products may be obtained by such quaternization. Representative alkali or<br>
alkaline earth metal salts include sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and<br>
the like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, when appropriate, nontoxic<br>
ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations formed using counterfoils such<br>
as halide, hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, loweralkyl sulfonate and<br>
aryl sulfonate.<br>
[0194] As described above, the pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of<br>
the present invention additionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier,<br>
adjuvant, or vehicle, which, as used herein, includes any and all solvents, diluents, or<br>
other liquid vehicle, dispersion or suspension aids, surface active agents, isotonic<br>
agents, thickening or emulsifying agents, preservatives, solid binders, lubricants and the<br>
like, as suited to the particular dosage form desired. Remington's Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences, Sixteenth Edition, E. W. Martin (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1980)<br>
discloses various carriers used in formulating pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
compositions and known techniques for the preparation thereof. Except insofar as any<br>
conventional carrier medium is incompatible with the compounds of the invention, such<br>
as by producing any undesirable biological effect or otherwise interacting in a<br>
deleterious manner with any other component(s) of the pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
composition, its use is contemplated to be within the scope of this invention. Some<br>
examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include,<br>
but are not limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum<br>
proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine,<br>
sorbic acid, or potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty<br>
acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen<br>
phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica,<br>

as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium<br>
stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening,<br>
flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in<br>
the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator.<br>
[0195] In yet another aspect, a method for the treatment or lessening the<br>
severity of a proliferative disorder, a cardiac disorder, a neurodegenerative disorder, an<br>
autoimmune disorder, a condition associated with organ transplant, an inflammatory<br>
disorder, or an immunologically mediated disorder is provided comprising<br>
administering an effective amount of a compound, or a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
composition comprising a compound to a subject in need thereof. In certain<br>
embodiments of the present invention an "effective amount" of the compound or<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable composition is that amount effective for treating or<br>
lessening the severity of a proliferative disorder, a cardiac disorder, a<br>
neurodegenerative disorder, an autoimmune disorder, a condition associated with organ<br>
transplant, an inflammatory disorder, a psychotic disorder, a viral disease, a bone<br>
disorder or an immunologically mediated disorder. The compounds and compositions,<br>
according to the method of the present invention, may be administered using any<br>
amount and any route of administration effective for treating or lessening the severity<br>
of a proliferative disorder, a cardiac disorder, a neurodegenerative disorder, an<br>
autoimmune disorder, a condition associated with organ transplant, an inflammatory<br>
disorder, a psychotic disorder, a viral disease, a bone disorder or an immunologically<br>
mediated disorder. The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject,<br>
depending on the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the severity of the<br>
infection, the particular agent, its mode of administration, and the like. The compounds<br>
34<br><br>
WO 2006/096270	PCT/US2006/004019<br>
of the invention are preferably formulated in dosage unit form for ease of<br>
administration and uniformity of dosage. The expression "dosage unit form" as used<br>
herein refers to a physically discrete unit of agent appropriate for the patient to be<br>
treated. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and<br>
compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within<br>
the scope of sound medical judgment The specific effective dose level for any<br>
particular patient or organism will depend upon a variety of factors including the<br>
disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific<br>
compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general<br>
health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration,<br>
and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment;<br>
drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed, and<br>
like factors well known in the medical arts. The term "patient", as used herein, means<br>
an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human.<br>
[ 0196] The pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention can be<br>
administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally,<br>
intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops),<br>
bucally, as an oral or nasal spray, or the like, depending on the severity of the infection<br>
being treated. In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention may be<br>
administered orally or parenterally at dosage levels of about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50<br>
mg/kg and preferably from about 1 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg, of subject body weight<br>
per day, one or more times a day, to obtain the desired therapeutic effect.<br>
[0197] liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited<br>
to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions,<br>
syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may<br>
contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other<br>
solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol,<br>
ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn,<br>
germ, olives, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene<br>
glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents,<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2006/096270	PCT/US2006/004019<br>
the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying<br>
and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.<br>
[0198] Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or<br>
oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable<br>
dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation<br>
may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic<br>
parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol.<br>
Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's<br>
solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are<br>
conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any<br>
bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition,<br>
fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.<br>
[0199] The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration<br>
through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of<br>
sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other<br>
sterile injectable medium prior to use.<br>
[0200] In order to prolong the effect of a compound of the present invention, it<br>
is often desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous or<br>
intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of<br>
crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of<br>
the compound then depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon<br>
crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally<br>
administered compound form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the<br>
compound in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming<br>
microencapsule matrices of the compound in biodegradable polymers such as<br>
polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of compound to polymer and the<br>
nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of compound release can be<br>
controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and<br>
poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the<br>
compound in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues.<br>
[0201] Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably<br>
suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with<br>
36<br><br>
WO 2006/096270	PCT/US2006/004019<br>
suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or<br>
a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body<br>
temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active<br>
compound.<br>
[0202] Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets,<br>
pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed<br>
with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium<br>
citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose,<br>
sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example,<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia,<br>
c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium<br>
carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate,<br>
e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as<br>
quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl<br>
alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and<br>
i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene<br>
glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and<br>
pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.<br>
[0203] Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in<br>
soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as<br>
well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage<br>
forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings<br>
and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical<br>
formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a<br>
composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain<br>
part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding<br>
compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid<br>
compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled<br>
gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high<br>
molecular weight polethylene glycols and the like.<br>
[0204] The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one<br>
or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules,<br>
37<br><br>
WO 2006/096270	PCT/US2006/004019<br>
pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings,<br>
release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical<br>
formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with<br>
at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also<br>
comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g.,<br>
tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and<br>
microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms<br>
may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents<br>
and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or<br>
preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner.<br>
Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances<br>
and waxes.<br>
[0205] Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound<br>
of this invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions,<br>
sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions<br>
with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as<br>
may be required. Ophthalmic formulation, ear drops, and eye drops are also<br>
contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Additionally, the present<br>
invention contemplates the use of transdermal patches, which have the added advantage<br>
of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms can be<br>
made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption<br>
enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The<br>
rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing<br>
the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.<br>
[0206] As described generally above, the compounds of the invention are useful<br>
as inhibitors of protein kinases, particularly for the JAK family kinases, ROCK and<br>
PKA. In a specific embodiment, the compounds and compositions of the invention are<br>
inhibitors of JAK2 and JAK3. The compounds and compositions are useful for treating<br>

JAK3 is implicated in the disease, condition, or disorder. When activation of JAK2,<br>
JAK3, ROCK or PKA is implicated in a particular disease, condition, or disorder, the<br>
disease, condition, or disorder may also be referred to as "JAK2-mediated disease",<br>
"JAK3-mediated disease", "ROCK-mediated disease" or "PKA-mediated disease",<br>
respectively. Accordingly, in another aspect, the present invention provides a method<br>
for treating or lessening the severity of a disease, condition, or disorder where<br>
activation of a JAK family kinase, ROCK or PKA, particularly JAK2 or JAK3, is<br>
implicated in the disease state.<br>
[0207] The activity of a compound utilized in this invention as an inhibitor of a<br>
JAK family kinase, ROCK or PKA, particularly JAK2 or JAK3, may be assayed in<br>
vitro, in vivo or in a cell line. In vitro assays include assays that determine inhibition of<br>
either the phosphorylation activity or ATPase activity of activated JAK2, JAK3, ROCK<br>
or PKA. Alternate in vitro assays quantitate the ability of the inhibitor to bind to JAK2,<br>
JAK3, ROCK or PKA. Inhibitor binding may be measured by radiolabelling the<br>
inhibitor prior to binding, isolating the inhibitor/kinase complex and determining the<br>
amount of radiolabel bound Alternatively, inhibitor binding may be determined by<br>
running a competition experiment where new inhibitors are incubated with the kinase<br>
of interest bound to known radioligands.<br>
[0208]	The term "detectably inhibit", as used herein means a detectable<br>
change in JAK2, JAK3, ROCK or PKA activity between a sample comprising said<br>
composition and JAK2, JAK3, ROCK or PKA and an equivalent sample comprising<br>
JAK2, JAK3, ROCK or PKA, respectively, in the absence of said composition.<br>
[0209]	The term "JAK3-mediated disease" or "JAK3-mediated condition",<br>
as used herein means any disease or other deleterious condition in which JAK3 is<br>
known to play a role. A JAK3-mediated condition or disease also means those diseases<br>
or conditions that are alleviated by treatment with a JAK3 inhibitor. Such conditions<br>
include, without limitation, immune responses such as allergic or type I<br>
hypersensitivity reactions, asthma, autoimmune diseases such as transplant rejection,<br>
graft versus host disease, rheumatoid arthritis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and<br>
multiple sclerosis, neurodegenerative disorders such as Familial amyotrophic lateral<br>
sclerosis (FALS), as well as in solid and hematologic malignancies such as leukemias<br>
and lymphomas.<br>

[ 0213 ] It will also be appreciated that the compounds and pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable compositions of the present invention can be employed in combination<br>
40<br><br>
WO 2006/096270	PCT/US2006/004019<br>
therapies, that is, the compounds and phannaceutically acceptable compositions can be<br>
administered concurrently with, prior to, or subsequent to, one or more other desired<br>
therapeutics or medical procedures. The particular combination of therapies<br>
(therapeutics or procedures) to employ in a combination regimen will take into account<br>
compatibility of the desired therapeutics and/or procedures and the desired therapeutic<br>
effect to be achieved. It will also be appreciated that the therapies employed may<br>
achieve a desired effect for the same disorder (for example, an inventive compound<br>
may be administered concurrently with another agent used to treat the same disorder),<br>
or they may achieve different effects (e.g., control of any adverse effects). As used<br>
herein, additional therapeutic agents that are normally administered to treat or prevent a<br>
 particular disease, or condition, are known as "appropriate for the disease, or condition,<br>
being treated".<br>
[0214] The amount of additional therapeutic agent present in the compositions<br>
of this invention will be no more than the amount that would normally be administered<br>
in a composition comprising that therapeutic agent as the only active agent. Preferably<br>
the amount of additional therapeutic agent in the presently disclosed compositions will<br>
range from about 50% to 100% of the amount normally present in a composition<br>
comprising that agent as the only therapeutically active agent.<br>
[0215] The compounds of this invention or phannaceutically acceptable<br>
compositions thereof may also be incorporated into compositions for coating<br>
implantable medical devices, such as prostheses, artificial valves, vascular grafts, stents<br>
and catheters. Accordingly, the present invention, in another aspect, includes a<br>
composition for coating an implantable device comprising a compound of the present<br>
invention as described generally above, and in classes and subclasses herein, and a<br>
carrier suitable for coating said implantable device. In still another aspect, the present<br>
invention includes an implantable device coated with a composition comprising a<br>
compound of the present invention as described generally above, and in classes and<br>
subclasses herein, and a carrier suitable for coating said implantable device.<br>
[0216] Vascular stents, for example, have been used to overcome restenosis (re-<br>
narrowing of the vessel wall after injury). However, patients using stents or other<br>
implantable devices risk clot formation or platelet activation. These unwanted effects<br>
may be prevented or mitigated by pre-coating the device with a phannaceutically<br>
41<br><br>
WO 2006/096270	PCT/US2006/004019<br>
acceptable composition comprising a kinase inhibitor. Suitable coatings and the<br>
general preparation of coated implantable devices are described in US Patents<br>
6,099,562; 5,886,026; and 5,304,121. The coatings are typically biocompatible<br>
polymeric materials such as a hydrogel polymer, polymethyldisiloxane,<br>
polycaprolactone, polyethylene glycol, polylactic acid, ethylene vinyl acetate, and<br>
mixtures thereof. The coatings may optionally be further covered by a suitable topcoat<br>
of fluorosilicone, polysaccarides, polyethylene glycol, phospholipids or combinations<br>
thereof to impart controlled release characteristics in the composition.<br>
[ 0217 ] Another aspect of the invention relates to inhibiting JAK2, JAK3,<br>
ROCK or PKA activity in a biological sample, which method comprises contacting said<br>
