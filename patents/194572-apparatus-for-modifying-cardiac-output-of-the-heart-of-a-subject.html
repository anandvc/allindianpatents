				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for modifying cardiac output of the heart of a subject, and it relates generally to cardiac therapeutic devices, and specifically to invasive devices for enhancing performance of the heart.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cardiac insufficiency, characterized inter aha by a reduction in the cardiac output,1 is a common, well-known and well-documented heart malfunction. It develops as a result of congenital defects or as an end-effect of many diseases Cardiac output, i e., the output of the heart per unit time, is the product of stroke volume and heart rate. Hence, variations in cardiac output can be produced by changes in cardiac rate or stroke volume. The stroke volume can be influenced, for example, by changing the strength of cardiac contraction, by changing the length of the cardiac muscle fibers, and by changing contractility of cardiac muscle independent of fiber length. The heart rate and rhythm influence the cardiac output both directly and indirectly, since changes in the rate and rhythm also affect invocardial contractility<br>
The human body normally regulates the cardiac output in response to body needs by changing the heart rate, as during physical exercise, and/or by adapting the stroke volume. Under pathological conditions, however, some of the normal regulatory mechanisms may be damaged. For example, heart tissue damaged due to myocardial infarct typically cannot sustain normal pumping function, leading to a reduction in stroke volume, and hence of cardiac output. The body may react to such a reduction by increasing the heart rate, thus imposing long term strain on the heart muscles, leading in more severe cases to heart failure. There is thus a need for devices and treatments that can regulate the cardiac output, so as to compensate for the deficiencies in the normal regulation mechanisms<br>
In response to this need, modern cardiology has developed means to control various parameters associated with the heart's operation. Pharmaceuticals, for example, may be used to influence the conduction velocity, excitability, contractility and duration of the refractory period of the heart tissue These Pharmaceuticals are used to treat arrhythmia, enhance cardiac output and prevent fibrillation Pharmaceuticals are generally limited in effectiveness in that they affect both healthy and diseased segments "of the heart, usually, with a relatively low precision. They frequently also have unwanted side-effects<br>
1A<br><br>
A special kind of control can be achieved using implantable electronic devices, which provide excitatory electrical stimulation to the heart to control directly the heart rate and/or rhythm. For example, a pacemaker, an electronic devices which is typically implanted in the heart to support the heart's electrical excitation system or to bypass a blocked portion of the conduction system Another type of cardiac electronic device is a defibrillator, which senses fibrillation in the heart and applies a high voltage impulse to "reset" the heart While electronic pacemakers can control the heart rate, however, they are limited in their capacity to enhance' cardiac output, and they are known to reduce stroke volume in at least some instances. Defibrillators are useful in treating arrhythmia when it occurs (although they are painful to the patient and traumatic to the heart), but they provide no long-term amelioration of cardiac insufficiency<br>
Thus, none of the treatments known in the art allow effective, long-term regulation of cardiac output The electromechanical properties of the heart, as well as methods known in the art for influencing these properties, are more fully described in the "Background of the Invention" section of PCT patent application PCT/1L97/00012, which is assigned to the assignee of the present patent application and is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a device and method for regulation of hemodynamic parameters, and particularly for increasing the cardiac output by enhancing the heart's stroke volume<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention, a cardiac output controller comprises a non-excitatory stimulation probe, including one or more non-excitatory stimulation electrodes; at least one sensor, preferably a sensing electrode, and electronic control circuitry, coupled to the stimulation probe and sensor. The stimulation electrodes and, preferably, the sensor are implanted in the heart of a subject Alternatively, a sensing electrode may be placed on a body surface. The circuitry receives signals from the sensor, indicative of the heart's activity, and responsive thereto, drives the stimulation electrodes to provide non-excitatory electrical stimulation to the heart<br>
The term "non-excitatory electrical stimulation," in the context of the present patent application and in the claims, refers to electrical pulses that do not induce new activation potentials to propagate in cardiac muscle cells. Rather, such pulses generally affect the<br><br>
response of the heart muscle to the action potentials, possibly by modulating cell contractility within selected segments of the cardiac muscle. Specifically, as described in the above-mentioned PCT patent application PCT/IL97/00012 and incorporated herein by reference, the inventors have found that by applying non-excitatory electrical stimulation pulses of suitable strength, appropriately timed with respect to the heart's electrical activation, the contraction of the selected segments can be increased or decreased, thus increasing or decreasing the stroke volume of the heart. This finding forms the basis for the present invention.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention, characteristics of the non-excitatory stimulation are adjusted so as to modify the heart's muscular activity, thus affecting the cardiac output, preferably by increasing the stroke volume, without directly affecting the heart rate. Preferably, the device is used to increase cardiac output substantially continuously for extended periods of time, most preferably to boost cardiac output during those portions of a day for which a patient needs increased blood supply Accordingly, the device is preferably not used at night, to allow the heart muscle to rest<br>
Alternatively, the device may be used to modify the heart's muscular activity in other ways. For example, in some conditions, such as HOCM (hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy), the device may be operated to reduce cardiac output, so as to reduce the workload on the heart, or particularly to reduce cardiac muscle contraction in a hypertrophic region of the heart As another example, the device may be used to increase the heart's contraction efficiency, so that a given level of cardiac output is maintained at a reduced expenditure of energy Such uses of the device are described further in Indian Patent Application No. 1308/CAL/97.<br>
In any case, the effect of the device on cardiac output is preferably regulated by changing the timing of the non-excitatory stimulation pulse relative to the heart's activity, preferably relative to the heart's local electrical activity or ECG signals received by the sensing electrode, and/or by changing other pulse characteristics, such as the voltage, current, duration, polarity, waveform and frequency of the waveform. Preferably, the device senses the heart's sinus rhythm and applies and synchronizes the stimulation pulse relative thereto, preferably with a delay before the onset of the stimulation pulse. Additionally, the circuitry may analyze the signals, for example, to determine the QT interval, so as to adjust the stimulation pulses<br>
3<br><br>
responsive thereto. Alternatively, when the heart's rhythm is irregular, due to ventricular premature beats (VPB's) or other cardiac arrhythmias, the device preferably identifies and analyzes the irregularity, using signal processing methods known in the art, and adjusts or withholds the stimulation pulse accordingly<br>
In some preferred embodiments of the present invention the control circuitry is contained within a console external to the body, and the electrodes are fed percutaneously into the subject's vascular system, for example, through the femoral artery, and are implanted in the heart Such embodiments are useful particularly in short-term therapy to regulate and stabilize the subject's hemodynamics following an insult or trauma, for example, open heart surgery or MI.<br>
In alternative preferred embodiments of the present invention, the electronic control circuitry is contained within a miniaturized, implantable case, similar to pacemaker cases known in the art.<br>
In some preferred embodiments of the present invention, the non-excitatory stimulation electrodes have a large surface area in contact with the heart tissue, by comparison with intracardiac electrodes known in the art, such as pacing or electrophysiology electrodes. Preferably, the stimulation electrodes comprise large-area carbon electrodes, most preferably vitreous carbon, or alternatively, pyro-carbon. Both types of carbon materials are known for their compatibility with heart tissue, in-vivo durability and excellent electrical properties, including high electrical conductivity Thus, they allow a relatively high electrical current to be delivered to a relatively large segment of the heart tissue, without inducing electrical excitation.<br>
Alternatively, the non-excitatory stimulation electrodes may comprise large-area electrodes of other types known in the art, such as platinum or platinum/iridium.<br>
In other preferred embodiments of the present invention, the non-excitatory stimulation electrodes are inserted into one of the blood vessels of the heart, preferably into the coronary sinus, or alternatively, into a coronary artery These preferred embodiments are based on the inventors' experimental findings that cardiac output is most enhanced when the stimulation electrodes are placed in the heart adjacent to the blood vessels. In one such preferred embodiment, the non-excitatory stimulation probe comprises a carbon wire electrode, which is inserted into the coronary sinus and passed therein to a position adjacent the left ventricle.<br>
In some preferred embodiments of the present invention the stimulation probe comprises a plurality of stimulation electrodes Preferably, the probe comprises a stimulation<br>
4<br><br>
net, which includes a plurality of interconnected, individually- and/or collectively- addressable electrodes, covering a substantial segment of the heart wall As described in the above-mentioned '012 PCT application, the inventors have found that the extent of change in cardiac output, especially in left ventricular stroke volume, may be controlled by varying the size of the segment of the heart to which a non-excitatory field is applied. Such size variation is most preferably achieved by varying the number of the electrodes within the net that are to which the non-excitatory stimulation pulse is applied simultaneously.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of this type, different stimulation pulses are applied to respective ones or groups of the plurality of stimulation electrodes Preferably, the different stimulation pulses are applied to the respective electrodes with a predetermined delay between the different pulses. The delay may be varied so as to achieve a desired hemodynamic effect, for example, to maximize the increase in stroke volume<br>
In still other such preferred embodiments, the positions of the plurality of stimulation electrodes and/or characteristics of the stimulation pulses applied thereto are optimized responsive to clinical characteristics of the heart Preferably, before insertion of the electrodes, a map of the heart is produced, for example, an electrophysiological map, as described in U.S Patent 5,568,809, or a phase-dependent geometrical map, as described in PCT Patent Application PCT/IL97/0001 1, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. Preferably, the map includes information regarding the viability of the heart tissue, for example, based on local contractility or electrical activity. The non-excitatory stimulation electrodes are then positioned responsive to the map<br>
Alternatively or additionally, at the time of implantation of the non-excitatory stimulation electrodes, their positions are varied and the results of the variation on hemodynamics are observed, in order to find optimal, fixed positions for the electrodes A similar effect may be attained by implanting the net electrode, as described above, and variably addressing different ones or groups of electrodes in the net so as to optimize the hemodynamic effect.<br>
In alternative embodiments of the present invention, the non-excitatory stimulation probe comprises at least one hybrid electrode The hybrid electrode preferably comprises a sensing core, preferably a platinum or platinum/indium electrode, surrounded by an annular non-excitatory stimulation electrode, preferably comprising a carbon electrode, as described above.<br>
5<br><br>
In still other embodiments of the present invention, a single electrode may serve as both the sensing electrode and as one of the one or more stimulation electrodes<br>
In some preferred embodiments of the present invention at least one non-excitatory stimulation electrode and the sensing electrode are implanted in the same chamber of the heart, preferably in the left ventricle. Preferably, the non-excitatory stimulation electrode is fixed against the wall of the left ventricle, and the sensing electrode is fixed at the septum thereof. Alternatively, the stimulation and sensing electrodes may be implanted in different chambers of. the heart, in either the ventricles or the atria The delay between the heart activity signal sensed by the sensing electrode and the pulse applied to the stimulation electrode is preferably dependent on the relative postions of these electrodes<br>
In some preferred embodiments of the present invention, the non-excitatory stimulation electrodes comprise a bipolar electrode, and the non-excitatory stimulation pulse is provided to the heart tissue between the poles of the electrode. In other preferred embodiments, the non-excitatory stimulation pulse is provided between the one or more stimulation electrode and another electrode, for example, the sensing electrode Alternatively, the pulse may be applied between the stimulation electrodes and the case of the control circuitry, in those embodiments of the present invention in which the case is implanted in the patient's body, as described above<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the control circuitry applies to the stimulation electrodes a square wave stimulation pulse having current up to 50 mA, most preferably between 5 and 10 mA, for a duration that may be nearly as long as the beat-to-beat interval of the heart, most preferably between 30 and SO msec Preferably, the stimulation pulse is followed by a pulse of opposite polarity, to prevent problems of electrode degradation and polarization<br>
In some preferred embodiments of the present invention, an alternating waveform is superimposed on the square wave pulse The waveform is itself preferably a square wave or, alternatively a sinusoidal or a sawtooth wave, having a frequency up to 10 kHz and amplitude less than or comparable to that of the square wave pulse The inventors have found that in at least some cases, such a waveform enhances the hemodynamic effect of the non-excitatory stimulation pulse on the heart muscle<br>
In some preferred embodiments of the present invention, the control circuitry also receives a sensor signal indicative of hemodynamic conditions, preferably indicative of the cardiac output, and adjusts the stimulation pulse responsive to the signal to achieve a desired<br>
6<br><br>
cardiac output level. Alternatively or additionally, physiological sensors may be used to sense other hemodynamic parameters, such as blood pressure or blood oxygenation, so as to provide feedback signals to the control circuitry or to telemetry apparatus associated with the control circuitry Sensors used for this purpose may thus include How rate sensors, pressure sensors, temperature sensors, oxygen sensors, and other types of sensors known in the art. The control circuitry then adjusts the stimulation pulse so that the hemodynamic parameters are maintained within a desired range of values<br>
Although preferred embodiments of the, present invention are described for the most part with reference to sensing electrogram signals in the heart, so the cardiac output controller applies the non-excitatory stimulation pulse in response to and generally synchronized with the<br>
sinus rhythm, cardiac output controllers in accordance with the present invention may also be<br><br>
synchronized by other methods. For example, as described above, the non-excitatory stimulation pulse may be synchronized relative to a body-surface ECG, and may also be synchronised and controlled relative to an arrhythmic heart beat<br>
Alternatively, the pulse may be externally synchronized, for example by an externally-applied trigger pulse or by a pacing pulse that is applied to the heart. These aspects of the present invention are further described in Indian Patent Application No. 2184/CAL/97.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention may also be used in conjunction with suitable drugs, as described in Indian Patent Application No. 131 l/CAL/97, and in conjunction with devices and methods for preventing cardiac fibrillation, as described in Indian Patent Application No. 1309/CAL/97.

Preferably, electrodes 23 and 29 are coated with an anticoagulant, such as heparin, preferably in a time-release form, or elute the anticoagulant into the heart tissue, to prevent clot formation on and around the electrodes. Such electrodes may be produced in a manner similar to steroid-eluting electrodes known in the an, for example, the Medtronic CAPSURE model 4003 electrode, described in The Foundations of Cardiac Pacing, by Sutton and Bourgeois, p. 73, which is incorporated herein by reference<br>
Fig. 2A is a schematic illustration showing electrodes 23 and 29 implanted in a subject's heart 38, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention Electrodes 23 and 29 are implanted in a chamber of the heart, preferably both in left ventricle 34. Most preferably, non-excitatory stimulation electrode 23 is implanted in contact with the wall of left ventricle 34, and sensing electrode 29 is implanted in septum 36, between the ventricles. Electrodes 23 and 29 are connected by wires passing through aorta 39 to either control unit 27 outside the body or to implantable case 32, which is preferably implanted in the patient's chest. When circuitry 22 detects an electrical activation pulse in the electrogram signal received from electrode 29, it generates a stimulation pulse, which is applied to electrode 23, preferably so as to increase the contraction of at least the segment of the wall of ventricle 34 with which electrode 23 is in contact, thus increasing the ventricular stroke volume<br>
Alternatively, stimulation electrode 29 and, optionally, sensing electrode 23 may be implanted surgically, preferably in the epicardium.<br>

Fig. 2B is a schematic illustration showing an alternative preferred embodiment of the present invention, in which non-excitatory stimulation probe 21 comprises a wire electrode 33. The electrode, which preferably comprises carbon material, as described above, is connected by an insulated conductor 43 to circuitry 22. It is preferably implanted in one of the blood vessels of the heart Most preferably, electrode 33 is passed through the right atrium of the heart, into the coronary sinus, using techniques of catheterization known in the art, and is positioned, therein adjacent to left ventricle 34. The electrode is then driven by circuitry 22 to 'deliver the non-excitatory stimulation pulses to the heart wall, as described herein.<br>
Fig 3 is a schematic block diagram of signal generation circuitry 22, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention Circuitry 22 comprises a stimulation section 100, a detection circuit 104 and a sensing unit 110. Unit 110 receives and conditions electrogram signals from sensing electrode 29. Detection circuit 104 senses a local activation wave in the electrogram, preferably by detecting a slope and voltage level corresponding to the rising edge of the wave, as is known in the an, and generates a trigger pulse responsive thereto. The trigger pulse is conveyed to stimulation section 100, which generates the stimulation pulses and applies these pulses to the electrodes of stimulation probe 21<br>
Sensing unit HO includes signal blanking unit 101 and signal blank logic 102 and a differential amplifier and signal conditioning circuit 103 The blanking operates to block the input to detection circuit 104 while the output of stimulation section 100 is active, to prevent the system from generating trigger pulses due to stimulation artifacts.<br>
Stimulation section 100 comprises a trigger divider 105, which generates a modified trigger pulse in response to input trigger pulses from detection circuit 104 or alternatively from external trigger input 30 The trigger divider allows a user of device 20 to select whether the stimulation pulse will be applied at every heart beat or only once in a predetermined number of beats Section 100 further includes signal generators 106 and 107, which generate voltage signals of predefined characteristics, as described below, in response to the modified trigger pulse, and constant current units (CCU) 108 and 109, which convert input voltage signals from the signal generators to output current pulses Two stimulation output channels are shown in Fig. 3, enabling different stimulation pulses to be applied to two or more different stimulation electrodes It will be appreciated, however, that only one of the channels need be used or alternatively, that additional channels may be added to drive additional stimulation electrodes.<br>

Fig 4 is a flow chart, which summarizes a method for regulation of cardiac output using device 20, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Preferably, parameters of the stimulation pulse, such as its level, duration, delay and waveform<br><br>
characteristics, as described below, are preset by the user. Sensing electrode 29 senses electrogram signals, as described above, and signal-generation circuitry 22 receives these signals and inputs them to detection circuit 104, which detects heart activity, preferably the. sinus rhythm, and generates a trigger pulse responsive thereto The trigger pulse drives stimulation section 100 to generate the stimulation pulse, which is applied to the heart by stimulation electrode 23 In an alternative preferred embodiment, an external trigger coupled to input 30 is employed<br>
Optionally, physiological parameters related to the cardiac output are monitored in order to verify the efficacy of the non-excitatory stimulation. For example, flow of blood through aorta 39 may be detected by flow sensor 31, as illustrated in Fig. 2A. Preferably, at least some of the parameters of the stimulation pulse, for example, its amplitude and/or timing, are adjusted responsive to the monitored parameters so as to achieve a desired cardiac output level. Such monitoring and adjustment are preferably carried out on-line, for example, by control unit 27 itself Alternatively or additionally, a separate telemetry unit (not shown in the figures) monitors the parameters and is used to program control unit 27 to vary the parameters of the stimulation pulse accordingly<br>
Fig. 5 is a schematic illustration of a non-excitatory stimulation pulse 51 applied by stimulation electrode 23 to cardiac tissue, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In some preferred embodiments of the present invention the regulation of cardiac output is achieved by varying certain characteristics of pulse 51. Non-excitatory stimulation energy is applied to stimulation electrode 23 in the form of a baseline pulse 53 having a baseline amplitude, indicated by an arrow 54 in Fig 5, of preferably 5 to 10 mA, optionally up to 50 mA The duration of pulse 51, indicated by an arrow 52, preferably ranges between 30 and 80 ms, and optionally up to 500 ms. Pulse 53 is preferably followed by another pulse of opposite polarity (not shown in the figure) to prevent problems of tissue polarization and electrode degradation, as described in the above-referenced '012 PCT application and mentioned above. Preferably, a waveform 58 having a frequency of up to 10 kHz and amplitude, indicated by an arrow 56, up to or comparable to the baseline amplitude is superimposed on the baseline amplitude of pulse 53. Although waveform 58 is shown here as a<br>
15<br><br>
square wave, any other suitable waveform may be used, for example, a sinusoid or sawtooth wave.<br>
Preferably, waveform 51 is triggered upon the detection of the rising edge of the R-wave of the heart's electrical activity by detection circuit 104. Alternatively, signal generators 106 and 107 may be controlled to provide a delay, indicated by an arrow 50 in Fig.1 5, of between 1 and 500 msec between the trigger input and the pulse generation The appropriate delay may depend on whether the trigger is provided by detection circuit 104 or by external trigger 30, as well as on the relative positions of sensing electrode 29 and sensing electrode 23. The delay is adjusted based on the desired increase or decrease of cardiac output that is to be achieved, and the optimal delay will generally vary from patienr to patient<br>
Fig. 6 is a schematic illustration showing an electrode net 40, for use as part of stimulation probe 21, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Net 40 comprises a plurality of stimulation electrodes 35, preferably, interconnected by a conductor network 37. Electrodes 35 are preferably individually and/or collectively addressable, and may operate in either a unipolar or a bipolar mode Net 40 is preferably large enough to cover a substantial segment of the heart wall, preferably at least 1 cm- and most preferably at least 4<br>
cm2. Each individual electrode 35 preferably has an area of at least 5 mm", and is separated<br>
from its neighbors preferably by at least 1 cm.<br>
In this preferred embodiment, cardiac output regulation is preferably achieved through variation of the stimulated area of a segment of the heart wall with which net 40 is in contact, as described in the '012 PCT patent application Preferably, the stimulated area is varied by changing the active area of net 40, i.e., varying the extent of the area of the net over which electrodes 35 are driven to deliver electric stimulation to the heart. The inventors have found, for example, that when the non-excitatory stimulation is applied between pairs of electrodes, selected among a plurality of electrodes placed in the left ventricle, the resultant enhancement of left-ventricular pressure and cardiac output varies responsive to the relative positions of the electrodes in the pair and the distance between them. Electrodes 35 in net 40 may thus be selectably addressed to optimize the hemodynamic results of the stimulation. Moreover, electrodes 50 may also be used as sensing electrodes, to map cardiac electrical activity over the segment of the heart wall so that the stimulation may be applied responsive to the map.<br>

above, surrounding a smaller sensing electrode 42 at the center of the probe, preferably, a<br>
platinum or platinum/indium electrode, most preferably bipolar. It will be understood that the<br>
methods, stimulation waveforms and control electronics described above in relation; to<br>
electrode 23 may be applied using probe 41, as well as any other suitable electrode<br>
configuration. Probe 41 is advantageous in that it reduces the number of separate electrodes<br>
that need to be introduced into and implanted in the heart.	 <br>
