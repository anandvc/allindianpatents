[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"AN ELECTROCHEMICAL CELL ASSEMBLY AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING THEREOF"<br>
INEOS CHLOR ENTERPRISES LIMITED, of PO Box 9, Runcorn Site HQ, South Parade, Runcorn, Cheshire WA7 4JE, England<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
83/MUMNP/2003<br><br>
GRANTED<br>
10-3-2006<br><br>
This invention relates to substrate treatment, particularly treatment of stainless steel components to be incorporated in electrochemical cells. Although th
A fuel cell is an electrochemical device in which electricity is produce without combustion of fossil fuel. In a fuel cell a fuel, which is typically hydrogen, oxidised at a fuel electrode (anode) and oxygen, typically from air, is reduced at a cathode to produce an electric current and form byproduct water. An electrolyte is required which is in contact with both electrodes and which may be alkaline or acid liquid or solid. Heat and water are the only by-products of the electrochemical reaction in fuel cells wherein the fuel is hydrogen. Accordingly, the use of such cell in power generation offers potential environmental benefits compared with power generation from combustion of fossil fuels or by nuclear activity.<br>
In proton-exchange membrane fuel cells, hereinafter referred to for convenience as "PEM" fuel cells, the electrolyte is a solid polymer membrane whicl allows transport of protons from the anode to the cathode and is typically based on perfluorosulphonic acid materials. The electrolyte must be maintained in a hydrated form during operation in order to prevent loss of ionic conduction through the electrolyte.<br>
A PEM fuel cell typically comprises two electrodes, an anode and a cathode, separated by a proton-exchange membrane electrolyte. At the anode,<br><br>
hydrogen fuel catalytically dissociates into free electrons and protons. The free electrons are conducted in the form of usable electric current through the external circuit with which the fuel cell is in electrical contact. The protons migrate through the membrane electrolyte to the cathode where they combine with oxygen from the air and electrons from the external circuit to form water and generate heat. Individual fuel cells may be combined into assemblies which are often referred to in the art as stacks to provide the amount of power required.<br>
Electrochemical cells, such as fuel cells, often incorporate stainless steel components where possible for reasons of economy. In a fuel cell stack for instance, separator plates between adjacent fuel cells and/or current collecting end plates may comprise stainless steel. In electrolytical cells as used for example in the generation of chlorine, electrodes of the cell may comprise a stainless steel substrate.<br>
An important factor in securing good cell efficiency is the interfacial resistance between the surfaces of stainless steel substrates and the surfaces of other components to which the steel substrates are directly or indirectly electroconductively coupled.<br>
While the use of metal plates in fuel cells is seen as having many advantages over other materials, there are concerns over the issue of corrosion which can lead to increased cell resistances. Makkus et al (J. Power Sources, 86 (2000) 274) for instance has reported that the anode side of the fuel cell (i.e. the hydrogen side) containing stainless bipolar plates, gives rise to a greater corrosion of the plate than the cathode (i.e. air ) side. Makkus et al also refers to metal passivation resulting in increased electrical as well as corrosion resistance.<br><br>
The present invention seeks to secure improvements in efficiency of operation of electrochemical cells, particularly fuel cells.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of manufacturing an electrochemical cell assembly in which at least one component, e.g. a plate, which is exposed to the chemical environment during operation of the cell comprises a stainless steel, said method comprising treating a surface of the stainless steel, prior to incorporation in the assembly, with an electrical current while contacted by an electrolyte, preferably an acidic electrolyte, under conditions which reduce the interfacial resistance associated with said surface.<br>
The treatment is typically carried out with the stainless steel as the anode (anodic treatment) using dc current.<br>
A feature of the invention is that it is possible to use a relatively inexpensive stainless steel. We have surprisingly found that it is possible to reduce the interfacial resistance associated with such a stainless steel by a process which would normally be expected to increase it. Conventional wisdom leads to an expectation that subjecting a stainless steel surface to anodic treatment would normally result in the growth of oxides on the surface and hence result in an increased interfacial resistance.<br>
In this specification, interfacial resistance is measured by the method as described hereinbelow.<br><br>
Reduction in interfacial resistance may be obtained by subjecting the stainless steel to an electrical potential or current of substantially constant or variable magnitude. For example, during at least major part of the treatment, the current density or applied voltage may be maintained substantially constant.<br>
The treatment of the stainless steel surface may involve modification of the surface composition of the stainless steel and/or the surface morphology thereof.<br>
The treatment may be such that the ratio of iron content to the chromium within the surface region of the stainless steel is reduced compared with the iron to chromium ratio prevailing prior to such treatment.<br>
Prior to such treatment, the surface or surfaces of the stainless steel may be roughened by physical techniques which are known in the art, e.g. by grit blasting.<br>
The treatment may be applied to two or more surfaces of the stainless steel. The same treatment may be applied at least to each major surface of the stainless steel or the treatment applied to one surface of the stainless steel may be different from that applied to one or more other surfaces of the stainless steel.<br>
The cell assembly may comprise two or more stainless steel components, e.g. plates, treated as aforesaid.<br><br>
The assembly may include bipolar plates, separator plates, flow field plates and/or current collecting plates, at least one of which comprises stainless steel treated as aforesaid.<br>
The acid(s) present in the electrolyte may be selected from one or more of the group comprising sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, chromic acid, oxalic acid and phosphoric acid. The acid may for example be sulphuric acid.<br>
The treatment may be carried out at ambient temperature (e.g. with the electrolyte initially at substantially room temperature). Nevertheless, we do not exclude the possibility of the treatment being carried out out at elevated temperatures. Usually, however, the temperature at least initially will not be greater than about 100°C, typically not greater than about 90 °C and more usually not greater than about<br>
70°C.<br>
The electrolyte may typically have a pH of up to about 6 or less, e.g. less than 5.<br>
The treatment may be such that the interfacial resistance of the stainless steel is reduced by a factor of at least 5%, preferably at least 10% and more preferably at least 15%, less than would otherwise prevail in the case of the untreated surface.<br><br>
Typically said factor is at least 25%, e.g. at least 40% or even at least 50%, less than would otherwise prevail would otherwise prevail in the case of the untreated surface.<br>
The so treated surface of the stainless steel may be coated with an electrically conductive material following treatment to reduce its interfacial resistance, e.g. with a coating of titanium nitride or chromium nitride or an electrocatalytically active material.<br>
Examples of the electrocatalytical coating treatment that may be applied are disclosed in our prior International Patent Application No. WO 00/22689, the entire contents of which are where the context admits incorporated herein by this reference. For example, the electrocatalytically-active material may be selected from the group comprising: one or more platinum group metals or oxides thereof, cerium or or an oxide thereof; ruthenium or an oxide thereof; ruthenium oxide and a non-noble metal oxide; mixtures of RuO2 with at least one of TiO2, SnO2, IrO2, PtO, Sb2O3, Ta2O5, PdO, Ce02, Co3O4.<br>
The stainless steel is preferably an austenitic stainless steel.<br>
The stainless steel may be a 300 series stainless steel such as 316 or 316L stainless steel.<br><br>
The treatment may be carried out while the stainless steel is in the form of a sheet, the treated sheet subsequently being divided to form a number of plates for incorporation in one or more electrochemical cell assemblies.<br>
Alternatively, the stainless steel may initially be in the form of a sheet which is then divided to form a number of plates before the treatment is applied to the individual plates.<br>
Fluid flow channels may be formed in the sheet before such division into plates is effected. Alternatively the fluid flow channels may be formed after division   has been effected.<br>
The electrochemical cell may comprise a fuel cell, e.g. a PEM fuel cell, an alkaline fuel cell, a phosphoric acid fuel cell, a direct methanol fuel cell, a molten carbonate fuel cell or a solid oxide fuel cell.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a fuel cell stack comprising: a) a plurality of fuel cell units each of which contains a proton-exchange membrane separating the cell into anolyte and catholyte chambers and provided with an anode and a cathode on opposite sides thereof; b) a separator plate, flow field plate or bipolar plate disposed between adjacent cell units; c) current-collecting means comprising a pair of plates located one at each end of the stack; d) means for feeding fuel, e.g. hydrogen or methanol, to the anolyte chambers of the stack; and e) means for feeding an oxygen-containing gas to the catholyte chambers of the stack; at least one of said plates being a stainless steel plate, e.g. a 316 or 316 stainless steel plate, a surface of which has been treated with an electrical current<br><br>
while contacted by an acidic electrolyte under conditions which reduce the interfacial resistance associated with said surface.<br>
The invention will now be described further with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>

Interfacial resistance as referred to in this specification is measured using the measurement system illustrated in, and the following procedure described with reference to, Figure 1.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, the system comprises of a tensometer (Lloyd Instruments LRX plus, AMETEK Inc.) which is shown in Figure 1 as a fixed press plate 6 and a moveable press plate 1. The stainless steel sample 4 having an area of about 50 x 50 mm is sandwiched between two pieces of carbon diffuser 5 which may comprise for example carbon paper, made by Toray, or Carbel carbon cloth manufactured by W L Gore and Associates. This composite is then sandwiched between two gold plated copper plates 3 (50x50 mm) with the carbon diffuser layers in contact with the gold plated faces. The copper plates 3 have two sets of leads connected to them, one for use in measuring the voltage drop across the plates 3 and the second set for use in passing current through the system. A constant 5 Amps is applied using a Hewlett Packard HP 6008A DC power supply (not shown). The above assembly 3,4, 5 is isolated from the tensometer itself using two blocks of insulating material 2, for example PTFE. Before the tensometer is operated to apply compressive forces to the assembly, the leads from the gold / copper plates are connected to a voltmeter (e.g.a FLUKE 73 III Multimeter, not shown), and to the Hewlett Packard power supply. The power supply is set to 5Amps and an ammeter (Beckman Industrial T100B) is used to precisely measure the current.<br><br>
Once the stainless steel sample plate 4 has been prepared and assembled as described above, the tensometer is operated in stepwise fashion to apply increasing pressures ranging from 40 to 200Ncm-2. Voltage drops, E, are measured from the voltmeter each time the tensometer reaches a set value stored by the machine. Because this method records the voltage drop over two interfaces, only half the voltage drop is used to calculate the interfaciai resistance, R1 using the formula:<br><br>
where I is the applied current (5 Amps) and A is the area of overlap between the sample 4 and the carbon diffuser, (typically 25cm2).<br>
Figure 2 represents a typical plot in which curve B represents the results obtained using a stainless steel plate which has been treated in accordance with the process of the invention. The anodic treatment in this instance involved a current density of 25 mA.crn'2 for 30 minutes with the plate immersed in an aqueous electrolyte of 0.5M sulphuric acid, initially at room temperature. Curve A represents results obtained using the system and procedure described above in relation to Figure 1 but with an untreated piece of the stainless steel. From Figure 2, it will be seen that curves A and B approach values for Rr which remain substantially constant at pressures of the order of 200Ncm"2 and higher. As used in the specification, interfaciai resistance corresponds to the value obtained at a loading of 200Ncm2. It will be observed that the interfaciai resistance for the treated sample is significantly less than that for the untreated sample, i.e. about 12 mΩcm2 compared to about 65 mΩcm2.<br>
Typically stainless steel plates to be treated for use in an electrochemical cell in accordance with the invention are subjected to the following treatment steps. The stainless steel workpiece is degreased using a suitable solvent (e.g. acetone,<br><br>
isopropyl alcohol, trichloroethylene, caustic agents etc.) and immersed in a bath of electrolyte. The electrolyte is acid based containing one or more of the following: sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, chromic acid, oxalic acid and phosphoric acid. Using appropriate counter electrodes (e.g. platinised Ti), a dc current is passed between the workpiece (as the anode) and the counter electrodes (as the cathode). This current is calculated as a current density and may be from 0.01 mA/cm2 to 500 mA/cm2, preferably in the range 1 to 50 mA/cm2. The current is controlled at the required level for a time between 0.5 and 180 minutes, preferably between 1 and 60 minutes and more preferably between 2 and 7 minutes. At the start of the anodic treatment, the electrolyte is at room temperature (and may increases during the course of the treatment). The particular conditions necessary to secure a reduction in interfacial resistance while maintaining the corrosion resistance properties of the stainless steel substantially unchanged or enhancing the same may be determined experimentally.<br>
The workpiece is removed and rinsed in deionised water or deionised water made slightly alkaline to remove excess acid, and dried, e.g. in air or by passing a warm air current over the workpiece. The workpiece is then installed as a bipolar plate, separator plate, flow field plate and/or a current collecting plate in the electrochemical cell, e.g. a fuel cell.<br>
Optimised conditions appropriate for anodic treatment of the stainless steel in order to reduce interfacial resistance may be established for a given electrolyte and temperature by configuring the sample of the stainless steel to be treated as the anode in a bath of electrolyte, establishing a potential difference between the anode and a counter electrode (as cathode) so as to pass a dc current of substantially constant current density through the electrolyte between the anode and electrode and using a range of current densities and treatment times. From<br><br>
measurements of the interfacial resistance, the corrosion potential Ecorr and corrosion current Icorr, a suitable operating regime can be determined. In practice, a suitable current density can be established by conducting experiments to determine current densities at which the interfacial resistance (as measured using the technique described above) is significantly reduced. For 316 stainless steel for instance, we have found that a marked reduction in interfacial resistance can be achieved using current densities of 20 mA.cm2 and upwards. For efficient energy usage, it is of course desirable to carry out the treatment at as low a current density as can be achieved while securing a significant reduction in interfacial resistance.<br>
For a given electrolyte and temperature, a suitable treatment time may be be established by reference to graphical representations such as that illustrated in Figure 3 which illustrates treatment time against Ecorr and Icorr for treatment of 316 stainless steel carried out at room temperature using a current density of 25 mA.cm-2 and an electrolyte comprising a 0.5M solution of sulphuric acid. The data for the curves in Figure 3 corresponds to that tabulated in Table 1 below in which the samples subjected to a current density of 25 mA.cm2 are identified by SS316(25).<br>
Table 1 also includes measurements for the following samples of the same stainless steel:<br>
SS316(U) - an untreated sample;   .<br>
SS316(UG) - a sample which has been grit-blasted using 60/80 alumina<br>
but otherwise untreated;<br>
SS316(TG) - a sample which has been grit-blasted using 60/80 alumina<br>
and has also been subjected to a current density of the specified<br>
magnitude and time;<br>
SS316(100) - a sample which has been subjected to a current density<br>
100 mA.cm-2 for 20 minutes.<br><br>
Ecorr and Icorr were determined by a DC polarisation technique using the following procedure:<br>
Polarisation was carried out in an EG&amp;G (Elmer Perkin) flat cell containing IN (0.5 mol) H2S04 electrolyte and equipped with a SCE reference electrode and Pt/Rh counter electrode. With the working electrode in place, the cell temperature was set at 60 °C and gently sparged with nitrogen gas and allowed to equilibriate for at least 15 minutes. The voltage drop between the working and counter electrode (open circuit potential) was measured every few minutes until the potential stabilises  between successive readings). Potential scanning was effected from -0.5 to 1.0 V vs SCE at a sweep rate of O.lmV.s-1. From the data obtained, a plot of log current density vs potential, commonly referred to as a Tafel plot, yields the well-known "spiked" polarisation curve, the centre of the spike being the location at which the anodic and cathodic curves meet. This point is treated as the corrosion potential Ecorr. By extrapolation along each part of the curve at a potential not more than 30mV either side of Ecorr, a value for Icorr can be determined from the point of intersection of the tangents - see Principles and Prevention of Corrosion by Denny A Jones, 2nd Edition, published by Prentice Hall, Page 95 for details of the determination of Icorr.<br><br>
All electrolytes specified in Table 2 are 1M aqueous solutions of the acid specified. The mixed acid electrolyte (H3P04/H2S04) comprises 1M aqueous solutions of each acid. Although HC1 exhibits a reduction in interfacial resistance, it is not a preferred acid because of corrosion pitting issues.<br>
As previously mentioned, the use of metal bipolar plates in fuel cells is seen as having many advantages over other materials, for instance: thin plates leading to low volume stacks; ease of pressing a flow field into the plate; and low cost metals and alloys are readily available in large quantities. One concern over the use of metals plates however is the issue of corrosion which can result in metal ions from the metal plates blocking active sites in the membrane in a PEM type fuel cell leading to increased cell resistances. Makkus et al (J. Power Sources, 86 (2000) 274) reported that the anode side of the fuel cell (i.e. the hydrogen side) containing metal bipolar plates, gives rise to a greater corrosion of the plate than the cathode (i.e. air) side. Makkus et al also refers to passivation resulting in increased electrical as well as corrosion resistance.<br>
To examine the effect of treating stainless steel in accordance with the present invention, operation of a PEM fuel cell was simulated by using an electrolyte of 1 mol dm-3 sulphuric acid at 60 °C and polarising a stainless steel test piece at the extremes of the fuel cell operation i.e. 0V vs SHE for the anode side. The simulation was carried out for treated and untreated test samples of the same 316 stainless steel and was operated for a number of hours. After such operation using each sample, the electrolyte was collected for chemical analysis. The treatment used in preparing the one sample for the simulation involved subjecting the sample to a current density of 25 mA.cnr2 for 6 minutes in an aqueous electrolyte of 0.5 mole sulphuric acid per<br><br>
dm3 initially at room temperature. The data from the anode side simulation is shown in Table 3 for the untreated sample (Sample 1) and the treated sample (Sample 2).<br><br>
From Table 3, it will be seen that for the simulated cell using the treated sample there is a substantial reduction in the extent of corrosion, as evidenced by the much lower metal ion presence in the electrolyte.<br><br>
Figure 5 illustrates the benefits derived from the use of anodically treated stainless steel plates in a fuel cell. This Figure is a graphical representation comparing the longer term performance of a single cell PEM fuel cell equipped with treated stainless steel plates and one equipped with untreated stainless steel plates (graphs T and U respectively in Figure 5), the stainless steel plates in both cases being configured as field flow plates located on opposite sides (anode and cathode sides) of the membrane. The treatment applied to the plates involved subjecting them to a current density of 25 mA/cm2 in a solution of 0.5 M sulphuric acid electrolyte for 6 minutes in the case of the anode-side plate and for 60 minutes in the case of the cathode-side plate. In the long term test of Figure 5, the following conditions were used:<br>
hydrogen pressure 3 bar (g) air pressure 3 bar (g) hydrogen utilisation 70% air utilisation 35% cell temperature 50 °C humidification 50°C compaction force 220 N/cm2 current density 0.7 A/cm2<br>
The comparative long term data for untreated stainless steel comes from D. P. Davies, P. L. Adcock, M. Turpin and S. J. Rowen, J. Power Sources, 86 (2000) 237.<br>
From Figure 5, it can be seen that significant improvement is secured in voltage output by using treated stainless steel plates without sacrificing durability.<br><br>
The treatment of the stainless steel may be carried out at constant current or at constant voltage. Figure 6 illustrates interfacial resistance data obtained using the procedure described with reference to Figure 1 for a sample of the same 316 stainless steel as that referred to in Table 2 but treated in 0.5M sulphuric acid electrolyte for 10 minutes at an applied voltage of 1.8V vs SCE, i.e. substantially constant voltage against the reference electrode. At an applied pressure of 200 Ncm"2, the interfacial resistance is approximately 12.5 mΩcm2 compared with 64 mΩ.cm2 for the untreated sample (see SS316(U) in Table 2).<br>
In a typical production process, a number of sheets of stainless steel, e.g. 316 or 316L stainless steel, each has sets of features introduced into one or both major surfaces (e.g. by etching or pressing) in such a way that each set of the features serve as flow distribution channels for fluids in an electrochemical cell assembly such as a fuel cell stack. The fluids may be (but are not limited to) hydrogen, air, oxygen, water and/or methanol. An example of such a flow pattern is shown in Figure 7 to be described below. Once the sheet has been treated in accordance with the invention, it can be cut into smaller pieces each forming a plate provided with a set of fluid flow channels on one or each major face, each plate being dimensioned and configured for use in the fuel cell. In accordance with the invention, the stainless steel sheet is treated in such a way as to enhance the surface conductivity, preferably without reducing the corrosion resistance and, in some cases, increasing the corrosion resistance of the metal.<br>
The treatment process usually comprises the following steps:<br>
1.	The sheet to be treated is first 'cleaned' using a degreasing solvent such as acetone, iso-propanol, trichloroethylene, or an alkaline based aqueous system.<br>
2.	The sheet is introduced into an aqueous treatment bath containing sulphuric acid, e.g. 1 mol dm-3, at room temperature or other desired temperature. The treatment bath is equipped with counter electrodes made of suitable material<br><br>
incorporation in the electrochemical cell. The individual plates so formed can then be individually treated in accordance with steps 1 to 5 above.<br>
In another variation, the opposite faces of the stainless steel sheet or individual plates may be subjected to the treatment to differing extents. For example, each face may be treated with regard to the conditions to which it will be exposed in operation of the electrochemical cell. For example, in the case of a bipolar plate for a fuel cell, one face might be exposed to a fluid comprising hydrogen or methanol (the anode side) and the opposite face may be exposed to a fluid comprising oxygen (the cathode side). By treating the two faces differently, e.g. for different lengths of time, each face may be optimised according to the conditions that it will be exposed to in operation of the fuel cell. Thus, the above process may be modified at step 4 by terminating current flow between one face and the associated counter electrode after a first predetermined time interval appropriate for that face (e.g. the hydrogen or anode side). At mat point, that side is disconnected and isolated whilst currrent flow between the opposite face and its associated counter electrode is continued until lapse of a second predetermined time interval.<br>
Referring now to Figure 7, one application of the present invention is in the production of a fuel cell stack comprising ion-permeable membranes 31 and 32 which have cathode electrodes 33 and 34 respectively and anode electrodes (not shown), bonded to each of their major surfaces. Each membrane 31, 32 and its associated anode and cathode forms a fuel cell unit. A bipolar separator plate 35, provided with surface features 36, is disposed between ion-permeable membranes 31 and 32 in contact with the electrode surfaces thereof. Terminal plates 37 and 38, provided with tabs 39 and 40 for delivering electric current generated in the cell stack to an external circuit, are disposed adjacent membranes 31 and 32 respectively. In the illustrated embodiment, only one bipolar separator plate 35 is shown. In practice, there will<br><br>
usually be a plurality of bipolar separator plates each associated with adjacent pairs fuel cell units.<br>
In the stack, membrane 31 is held firmly between terminal plate 37 and bipolar plate 35 so as to form an oxidant gas chamber 41 and a fuel gas chamber 42. In like manner, membrane 32 is held firmly between terminal plate 38 and bipolar plate 35 so as to form an oxidant gas chamber 43 and a fuel gas chamber 44. Hydrogen fuel is supplied to the anodes in the fuel gas chambers 42 and 44 via fuel gas inlet conduit 45 and by-products removed via conduit 46. Oxidant gas is supplie to cathodes 33 and 34 in the oxidant gas chambers 41 and 43 via oxidant gas inlet conduit 47 and by-products removed via conduit 48. Openings 49 and 50 located in opposite corners of membranes 31 and 32 are aligned with hydrogen gas inlet and outlet conduits 45 and 46 and with openings 51 and 52 in bipolar plate 35 to facilitat passage of hydrogen fuel gas into the fuel chambers 42 and 44 and to remove by-products therefrom.<br>
Openings, not shown, and openings 53 located in opposite corners of membranes 31 and 32 are aligned with oxidant inlet and outlet conduits 47 and 48 an with opening 54 and another not shown in bipolar plate 35 to facilitate passage of oxidant gas into the oxidant chambers 41 and 43 and to remove by-products therefrom.<br>
End plates 37 and 38, membranes 31 and 32 and bipolar plate 35 are each provided with a plurality of openings 55 through which assembly tie-rods 56 (one only of which is illustrated in part) pass and engage with nuts 56A so that the fuel eel units and bipolar separator plates are clamped between the end plates 37 and 38. Though not illustrated, sealing gaskets will be interleaved with the membrane<br><br>
carrying plates 31 and 32, the bipolar plates 35 and the end plates 37 and 38 to seal the active interior of the fuel cell stack.<br>
The end plates 37, 38 and/or the bipolar plate 35 are made of stainless steel which has been treated in accordance with the process of the invention so that the interfacial resistance between these plates and the adjacent membranes 31 is significantly reduced. In addition, the conduits and also the tabs 39 and 40 may be made of stainless steel treated in this way. In the case of the end plates 37, 38 only those faces which are presented towards the interior of the fuel cell stack need be treated in practice. However, for simplicity of treatment, the entire surface of the end plates may be so treated, including the borders which are not actually directly exposed to the interior of the fuel cell stack, and hence the strongly reducing/oxidising and high temperature conditions prevailing during operation of the fuel cell stack.<br>
Although not shown, the stack is desirably provided with cooling means for dissipating at least part of the heat generated during operation. Such cooling means may be implemented by adapting one or more of the separator plates or inclusion of suitable elements within the stack so as to incorporate coolant passageways which are in heat exchange relation with the active interior of the fuel cell stack and through which a coolant fluid such as water or air can be passed, the interiors of the fluid coolant passageways being isolated from the interior of the fuel cell stack.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, a layer of diffusion material which is electrically conducting and porous, for example a carbon-coated paper or a graphite-impregnated polymer film, is disposed in the oxidant gas chambers 41 and 43 and/or in the fuel gas chambers 42 and 44. For example, the layer of diffusion material may be disposed between bipolar plate 35 and the adjacent electrode surfaces<br><br>
