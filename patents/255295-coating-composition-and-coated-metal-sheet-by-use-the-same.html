Title:  Coating Composition and Coated Metal Sheet by Use of the Same Field of the Invention;<br>
The present invention relates to a chrome-free coating composition showing excellent corrosion resistance and a coated metal sheet by use of the coating composition, more particularly to a coating composition effective on improving corrosion resistance of not only non-fabricated flat portion but also fabricated portion and edge face and a coated metal sheet by use of the coating composition. Background of the Art:<br>
A precoated metal sheet such as a precoated steel sheet coated by coil coating has widely been used in the art as housing-related goods, for example, building materials such as roofs, walls, shutters, garage and the like for an architectural structure, various kinds of household appliances, panel boards, refrigerator showcase, steel furniture, kitchen fitments, etc.<br>
The housing-related goods are usually prepared from the precoated metal sheet, for example, by a process which comprises cutting a precoated steel sheet, followed by subjecting to fabrication such as press molding and joining. Consequently, the housing-related goods often have a metal-exposed portion as a cut surface and a crack-developed portion due to press molding.  Corrosion resistance of the metal-exposed portion and the crack-developed portion may be<br>
reduced compared with other portions.  For the purpose of improving corrosion resistance, a primer coating film on the precoated steel sheet generally contains a chrome-based anticorrosion pigment.<br>
However, the chrome-based anticorrosion pigment may contain or produce a hexavalent chrome showing excellent corrosion resistance, resulting in providing problems from the standpoints of health of human body and environmental protection.<br>
Various kinds of chrome-free anticorrosion pigments such as zinc phosphate, aluminum tripolyphosphate, zinc molybdate and the like have been commercially available, and various kinds of primers containing combinations of chrome-free pigments have been proposed. For example, Patent Reference 1 discloses a coating composition prepared by adding an anticorrosion pigment mixture consisting of a combination of calciuin silicate and phosphorus vanadate, or an anticorrosion pigment mixture consisting of a combination of calcium carbonate, calcium silicate, aluminum phosphate and phosphorus vanadate to a vehicle component consisting of epoxy resin and phenol resin. Further, Patent. Reference 2 discloses a coating composition prepared by adding an anticorrosion pigment mixture consisting of a combination of dibasic magnesium phosphate and a calcined product of manganese oxide"vanadium oxide, or consisting of a calcined product of calcium phosphate and vanadium oxide to a polyester resin. However, a coating film formed from the<br>
coating compositions disclosed in Patent References 1 and 2 shows poor corrosion resistance, particularly unsatisfactory corrosion resistance in the fabricated portion and edge face portion compared with a coating composition prepared by use of a chrome based pigment, and further often shows poor chemical resistance such as alkali resistance and acid resistance and poor water resistance when a large amount of the anticorrosion pigment mixture is used. Accordingly, the anticorrosion pigment mixture disclosed in Patent References 1 and 2 is unsatisfactory to be replaced for the chrome based anticorrosion pigment in the preparation of the precoated metal sheet.<br>
Patent Reference 3 discloses a coating composition prepared by adding a silica fine particle having an oil absorption of 30 to 200 ml/100 g and a pore volume of 0.05 to 1.2 ml/g and forming a cured coating film having a glass transition temperature in the range of 40 to 125'C,  However, a coating film formed from the coating composition disclosed in Patent Reference 3 shows some corrosion resistance, but shows poor corrosion resistance and poor chemical resistance, particularly unsatisfactory corrosion resistance in the edge face portion compared with a coating composition prepared by use of a chrome based pigment.<br>
Patent Reference 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 61001/99.<br>
Patent Reference 2; Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 199078/00,<br>
Patent Reference 3: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.<br>
129163/00.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
it is an object of the present invention to provide a chrome-free coating composition capable of forming a coating film showing excellent corrosion resistance in a fabricated portion and an edge face portion in addition to other non-fabricated portions when used in a coated metal sheet, and a coated metal sheet by use of the coating composition.<br>
The present inventors made intensive studies for the purpose of solving.the above-mentioned problems in the prior art to find out that a coating composition prepared by adding an anticorrosion pigment mixture consisting of a specified vanadium compound, a specified silicon-containing compound and a phosphate-based calcium salt in a predetermined amount respectively, or an anticorrosion pigment mixture consisting of a specified vanadium compound, calcium compound and specified phosphate based metal salt in a predetermined amount respectively, to a hydroxyl group containing coating film-forming resin respectively can form a coating film showing excellent corrosion resistance in a fabricated portion and an edge face portion in addition to other non-fabricated flat portion when used in a coated metal sheet, resulting in accomplishing the present invention.<br>
That is, the present invention provides a coating composition containing (A) a hydroxyl group-containing coating film-forming resin, (B) a crosslinking agent, and (C)<br>
an anticorrosion pigment mixture, the corrosion pigment mixture (C) being an anticorrosion pigment mixture (C-l) consisting of a combination of (l) at least one vanadium compound selected from vanadium pentoxide, calcium vanadate and ammonium metavanadate, (2) a metal silicate and (3) a phosphate-based calcium salt, or an anticorrosion pigment mixture (C-2) consisting of a combination of the vanadium compound (1), (4) a calcium compound and (5) at least one phosphate-based metal salt selected from a phosphate metal salt, hydrogen phosphate metal salt and tripolyphosphate metal salt, a metal in respective metal salts being zinc, aluminium or magnesium, the anticorrosion pigment mixture (C) being in the range of 10 to 150 parts by weight, the vanadium compound (1) being in the range of 3 to 50 parts by weight, the metal silicate (2) being in the range of 3 to 50 parts by weight and the phosphate-based calcium salt (3) being in the range of 3 to 50 parts by weight in the anticorrosion pigment mixture (C-l) respectively, the vanadium compound (1) being in the range of 3 to 50 parts by weight, the calcium compound (4) being in the range of 3 to 50 parts by weight and the phosphate-based rnetal salt (5) being in the range of 3 to 50 parts by weight in the anticorrosion pigment mixture (C-2) respectively, per 100 parts by weight of a total solid content of the resin (A) and the crosslinking agent (B) respectively; and a coated metal sheet by use of the coating composition.<br>

In the case where the anticorrosion pigment mixture (C-1) is used as the anticorrosion pigment mixture (C), the coating film formed by coating the coating composition of the present invention onto a metal sheet shows excellent corrosion resistance. This is because a direct formation of a precipitated salt in place of a redox reaction between a metal ion formed by dissolution of a substrate metal due to chloride ion or the like under corrosion environment and pentavalent vanadium ion, i.e., vanadate ion such as V03~ or V043~, and an effective formation of a precipitated salt or compound due to a combination of silicate ion with trivalent vanadium ion formed by redox reaction of pentavanadium ion with the substrate metal ion and the substrate metal ion, results in that exposed surface of a substrate may effectively coated, and further because a corrosion-proceeding portion and surrounding portion may be controlled at a pH range suitable for taking place a redox reaction between pentavalent vanadium ion and the substrate metal due to phosphate ion eluted simultaneously.  In addition, a combined use of the components (1), (2) and (3) constituting the anticorrosion pigment mixture (C-l) makes it possible to effectively conquer respective poor properties in acid resistance, alkali resistance and water resistance of respective components (1), (2) and (3).  Further, calcium ion<br>
has a function to control dissolution of the substrate metal under such a strong alkali atmosphere of a pH higher than 10 that the substrate metal may easily be dissolved, resulting in providing excellent properties in chemical resistance and water resistance. These synergistic functions due to the anticorrosion pigment mixture (C-l) accomplish excellent corrosion resistance,<br>
In the case where the anticorrosion pigment mixture (C-2) is used as the anticorrosion pigment mixture (C), the coating film formed by coating the coating composition of the present invention onto a metal sheet shows excellent corrosion resistance. This is because a direct formation of a precipitated salt in place of a redox reaction between a metal ion formed by dissolution of a substrate metal due to chloride ion or the like under corrosive environment, or the zinc ion or aluminum ion elated from the anticorrosion pigment mixture and pentavalent vanadium ion, i.e., vanadate ion such as VO3~ or VO43~, a function of calcium ion or other metal ion dissolved from the anticorrosion pigment mixture to control an anode dissolution reaction of the substrate metal, or formation of a precipitate due to a combination of phosphate ion with trivalent vanadium ion formed by redox reaction of pentavalent ion with substrate metal and calcium ion results in that a substrate-exposed surface may effectively coated, also because, particularly on the galvanized steel sheet, zinc ion and vanadate ion, in addition to calcium ion migrate to an iron-exposed portion as<br>
a charged body of a corrosion current due to formation of a different kind metal cell, react and form a salt, resulting in providing such effects as to control cathode polarization of an iron portion and to function so as to reduce potential difference between different kind metals, and further because calcium ion and other metal provide such effect as to control a reaction to dehydrolize zinc hydroxide formed around the cathode portion on corrosion under the coating film to form zinc oxide.  In addition, a combined use of the components (1), (4) and (5) constituting the anticorrosion pigment mixture (C-2) makes it possible to effectively conquer respective poor properties in acid resistance, alkali resistance and water resistance of respective components (1), (4) and (5) . Further, calcium ion has a function to control dissolution of the substrate metal under such a. strong alkali atmosphere of a pH higher than 10 that the substrate metal may easily dissolved, resulting in providing excellent properties in chemical resistance and water resistance. These synergistic functions due to the anticorrosion pigment mixture (C-2) accomplish excellent corrosion resistance. Coated Metal Sheet<br>
The coated metal sheet of the present invention has a coating film formed by coating the coating composition of the present invention onto a metal sheet as a substrate, followed by curing.<br>
The metal sheet as the substrate may include cold-rolled steel sheet, hot dipped galvanized sheet,<br>
electroplated galvanized sheet, iron-zinc alloy plated steel sheet (galvanneal steel sheet), aluminum-zinc alloy plated steel sheet ("galvalurne steel sheet" containing about 55% of aluminum in the alloy, "galfan" containing about 5% of aluminum in the alloy, etc.), nickel-zinc alloy plated steel sheet, stainless steel sheet, aluminum sheet, copper sheet, copper plated steel sheet, tin plated steel sheet, etc. These metal sheet may optionally be subjected to conventional metal surface treating process, for example, the phosphating process such as zinc phosphate-treating process, iron phosphate-treating process and the like, composite oxide film-treating process, chrome phosphate-treating process, chromating process, etc.<br>
The coating composition of the present invention may be coated onto the metal sheet by the conventional coating method such as roll coating method, curtain flow coating method, spray coating method, brushing method, dip coating method and the like. A film thickness of the coating film formed from the composition of the present invention may not particularly be limited, but is usually in the range of 2 to 10 µm, preferably 3 to 6 µm.  Drying of the coating film may be carried out under suitable conditions depending on kind of the resin to be used, but in the case where a coating film formed by the coil coating method is continuously heat cured, the heat curing may be carried out, usually at a substrate maximum temperature of 160 to 250"C, preferably 180 to 230°C for 15 to 60 seconds. Heat curing in the batch-wise process<br>
may be carried out, usually at a surrounding temperature of 80 to 200 °C for 10 to 30 minutes.<br>
In the case where heating is unnecessary in the crosslinking reaction on forming a coating film, for example, in the case where a non-blocked polyisocyanate compound is used as the crosslinking agent (B), or in the case where a bisphenol type epoxy resin is used as the resin (A) and an amine compound is used as the crosslinking agent (B), drying may be carried out at room temperature to be cured according to the conventional process.<br>
The coated metal sheet of the present invention may include ones having the coating film only formed from the coating composition of the present invention on an optionally surface treated metal sheet, but may also include ones having a topcoating film on the above coating film. The topcoating film has a film thickness in the range of 8 to 30 µm, preferably 10 to 25 µm.<br>
A topcoating composition forming the topcoating film may include conventionally available ones for use in the precoat metal sheet, for example, polyester resin based, alkyd resin based, silicone-modified polyester resin based, silicone-modified acrylic resin based, fluorocarbon resin based topcoating compositions.  In the case where fabrication properties are of a great importance, use of a topcoating composition having good fabrication properties such as a polyester resin based topcoating composition for use in high fabrication makes it possible to obtain a coated metal plate<br>
having particularly good fabrication properties.  The coated metal sheet having the above topcoatirig film in the present invention shows good film performances in corrosion resistance.<br>
In the case where the galvanized steel sheet and aluminum-zinc alloy plated steel sheet, corrosion resistance in a non-fabricated flat portion has been improved to some extent, but corrosion resistance in a cut edge surface portion and fabricated portion have been unsatisfactory in the art.  In contrast, coating of the coating composition of the present invention makes it possible to obtain excellent corrosion resistance in edge surface portion and fabricated portion.<br>
A coating film from the coating composition of the present invention may be formed on a double-side of the substrate, and optionally the topcoating film may be formed on the coating film from the coating composition of the present invention. Forming the coating film from the coating composition of the present invention on the double-side including the back side of the substrate makes it possible to obtain a coated metal sheet free of a chrome-based ariticorrosion pigment and advantageous from the standpoints of environmental protection and health and showing excellent corrosion resistance.<br>
The coated metal sheet of the present invention is such that a coating film from the coating composition of the present invention may be formed the double-side of the metal<br>
sheet subjected to the optional surface chemical treatment to be used as it is, but for the purpose of improving appearance and durability, a topcoating film may be formed on at least one side of the coating film.<br>
In the case where the topcoating film is formed on one side, a topcoat coating composition may be coated on one side-cured aiiticorrosive coating film, while another side anticorrosive coating film being optionally cured, followed by heating and curing.  In the case where the topcoating film is formed on the double-side, the topcoating film may be cured by a method of coating the topcoat coating composition on one side of double-side cured anticorrosive coating film-having metal sheet and curing, followed by coating the topcoat coating composition on another cured anticorrosive coating film and curing, or a method of coating the topcoat coating composition on double-side of double-side cured anticorrosive coating film-having metal sheet, followed by curing the double-side simultaneously. A film thickness of the topcoat coating film may preferably in the range of 8 to 30 µm, preferably 10 to 25 µm. Example<br>
