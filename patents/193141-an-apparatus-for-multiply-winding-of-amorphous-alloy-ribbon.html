This invention relates to an apparatus for multiply winding of amorphous alloy ribbon and is particularly useful in producing transformer cores.<br>
Transformer cores are formed by winding amorphous alloy ribbons of very low thickness. The stack thickness of a typical distribution transformer core ranges from 30mm to 100nm and a very large number of thin amorphous alloy. Ribbon pieces are required to build up the required stack thickness. Variations in the physical properties of the different pieces that constitute a single ply which is then wound to form a core affect the stacking factor of the core.<br>
The object of this invention is to produce a multiply amorphous alloy ribbon suitable for production of transformer cores. With this object in mind, an apparatus has been developed and designed to produce multiply ribbon which may be further subjected to known steps of cutting, forming and annealing before wound to a core. Amorphous alloy ribbons are uncoiled from a plurality of uncoilers and fed to a common recoiler thus averaging out the physical variation of the incoming alloy ribbon froin different uncoilers. Further, the apparatus of this invention increases the production rate of the multiply ribbon, the production rate depending on the number of ribbons wound at a time which the determined by the uncoilers used in the apparatus.<br><br>
The apparatus consists of a plurality of uncoilers, one recoiler, dancing roller assembles, support tray, shaker, control panel and sensors. Each of these components will be described in detail hereinunder.<br>
Uncoiler:-  Each  uncoiler consists of a gear in a  housing.  The<br>
gear is drivable by a variable speed AC motor which is controiied by an ultrasonic sensor programmable through logic controller. The uncoiler has an expansion and collapsible means operable by hydraulic cylinders. The housing has a slit like opening through which the uncoiled amorphous alloy ribbon is fed to the recoiler. An apparatus may have a plurality of uncoilers, the preferred number being 10.<br>
Recoiler:- The single recoiler consists of a DC motor drivable gear housed in metallic body. Expansion and collapsible means operable by hydraulic cylinder is connected to the recoiler. The recoiler is also provided with pusher means for pushing the recoiled spool. The different plys fed to the recoiler from the uncoiler is recoiled as a multiply ribbon in this unit which is driven by D C motor and controlled by programmable logic controller.  Advantageously 10 plys are recoiled in the recoiler.<br><br>
Dancing Roller Assembly:- The apparatus consists of a number of dancing roll assemblies to control drive of the uncoiler for smooth feeding of plys to the recoiler. Each dancing roll assembly consists of a vertical stand provided with a pulley at the top. This pulley holds the dancing roller which is a rotating roller assembled on free bearings, which in turn is attached to linear bearings supported with counter weights. This assembly swings on the vertical stand and controls the feeding of plys from the respective uncoiler.<br>
Support tray:- The smooth metal structure provided with guides to support the amorphous strip uncoiled from the uncoiler till it reaches the recoiler is termed the support tray or support means.<br>
Shaker:- The shaker or shaking means is an alignment device provided before the recoiler. The shaker consists of a drivable gear, a hydraulic cylinder and a beating roller which is driven to beat the required number of strokes per minute. The shaking or beating aligns the number of plys from the uncoiler before the same are fed to the recoiler.<br>
Control panel:- The control panel operates the total line and has push button stations for starting the hydraulic cylinders which control  the expansion and collapsibie means of  the  uncoilers.<br><br>
The control panel also has means for driving the uncoilers in the forward and reverse directions. Means for selecting auto or manual operation of the apparatus is also provided in the control panel. Means for starting and Slopping the apparatus as well as means for controlling the line are also provided in the control panel. The control panel also has means for emergency stopping of the system.<br>
Sensor :- The sensor is an electronic device consisting of a sensing element and a signal transfer element. The sensors are preferably ultrasonic sensors capable of sensing the diameter and loop height of different plys and send corresponding signals to a programmable logic controller.<br>
The invention provides an apparatus for multiply winding of amorphous alloy ribbon comprising a plurality of uncoilers for uncoiling and feeding spools of amorphous alloy ribbon to a single recoiler, a dancing roller assembly positioned after each of the uncoiler, support means for guiding and supporting the uncoiled amorphous ply form the uncoilers shaking means positioned before the recoiler through which the uncoiled plys enter the recoiler, a plurality of sensing means for sensing the diameter and the loop height of the spools and a control panel with a programmable logic circuit cormected to said uncoilers, recoiler, dancing roller assembly and sensing means.<br>
This invention will now be described with particular reference to the single figure in the accompanying drawing.<br><br><br>
Reference letter A stands for a plurality of uncoilers which are driven by a gear arrangement. Spools of amorphous alloy ribbons are made to uncoil from these uncoilers and are fed to the reooiler represented by letter B. The uncoiled spools are supported and guided by support means D during their passage from the uncoiler to the recoiler. The spools uncoiled from the uncoiler are made to pass through dancing roll assemblies which are located after each uncoiler. The plys from the different uncoilers are passed through a shaking means E consisting of drive means and beating rollers for beating the incoming plys from the uncoilers and aligning them before they enter the recoiler which is represented by the reference letter B. A plurality of sensors represented by reference letter G are positioned after each uncoiler and the recoiler for sensing the diameter and the loop height of the spools. A control panel F having push buttons for controlling the operation of the apparatus is also provided. Means for forward and reverse drive of the recoiiers and uncoilers and means for converting the operations from automatic to manual are also provided on the control panel.<br>
It will be obvious to persons skilled in the art that numerous variations and modifications are possible without departing from the basic inventive concept. All such modifications and variations are to be considered within the scope of the present invention, the nature of which is described hereinabove and claims in the appended claims.<br><br><br>
