				<td>SELF-NAVIGATORY ROOT CANAL IRRIGATION NEEDLE<br>
Field of the present invention<br>
The present invention relates to a self-navigatory root canal irrigation needle more particularly to a root canal irrigation needle having multiple bayonet bends to facilitate easy access during root canal irrigation.<br>
Background of the present invention<br>
In various practices root canal irrigation needle have been used to release the fluid into the root canals. Hence, it is required to first to properly locate the root canal orifice with the help of root canal irrigation needle and release the fluid into the root canal.<br>
The repeated location of the root canals, during RC irrigation, is an important and difficult step for the reasons firstly, that these canal openings are very small and vary in number from 1 to 5 from tooth to tooth. Secondly, these root canal openings lie very close to one another with a variable distance of .25 to 1 mm apart at the base of the tooth. Sometimes there may be a single hole / opening and 2 root canals can be located &amp; approached by directing the reamers in two different directions. The whole process of RCT consists of repetition of use of files/reamers and other root canal instruments by passing these through these openings into the root canals and alternatively irrigating the loosened necrotic material from the root canals with the help of irrigating solution. The configuration of root canals, in majority of cases, is not linear but curved. Each time during the reaming / filing of the canals, the practitioner first very carefully places the tip of these instruments onto the opening of these canals by viewing these indirectly through dental mirror, removes the dental mirror out of the mouth and manipulates the files/reamers slowly into the whole length of the root canals with different motions &amp; techniques with tactile sensation and blindly in an attempt to loosen and extirpate the necrotic or dead pulp tissue. After each maneuver with the file / reamer he very carefully takes the tip of the irrigating needle to the opening of the canal and delivers the solution with intermittent pressure into the canals.<br>
The irrigation of the root canals forms an important step in the root canal procedure because these are carried out very frequently to deliver the irrigating solution, essentially sodium hypochlorite, into the root canals. Different irrigating needle-types have been used for irrigation of root canals. For the root canal irrigations, mostly medical syringes with luer-lock or without luer-lock interchangeable needles of different diameters and lengths are being used by the dentists. The most commonly used are the (i) blunt stainless needles with a single bend ranging about 30 to 90 degrees, (ii) the needles with holes on the sides of the needles so that the irrigating solution can be directly delivered on to the walls of the root canals, (iii) the needles with an additional internal lumen for the aspiration of the irrigated solution (iv) flexible needle made up nickel titanium fitted on angulated shafts so that these can be inserted, without breakage, as far apical as possible in an attempt to deliver the irrigating solution right at near the apices (v) needles with the adjustable stop to prevent its insertion beyond the desired distance, (v) nickel titanium needles with a side bend in the distal end and irrigating needles fitted on adjustable sleeve in which the angle adjustment can be made into this sleeve .<br>
Objects of the present Invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to develop a root canal irrigation needle to facilitate easy access during root canal irrigation.<br>
Another main object of the present invention is to develop a root canal irrigation needle having multiple bends of particular angles.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to develop a method of irrigating root canal using a self-navigatory root canal irrigation specific needle having multiple bends of particular angles.<br>
One another object of the present invention is to develop a method for manufacturing a self-navigatory root canal irrigation needle to ease the root canal irrigations which are carried out many times during the root canal treatment.<br>
Summary of the present Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a self-navigatory root canal irrigation needle with multiple bends of particular angles to facilitate easy access to the orifices of root canals during root canal irrigation.<br>
Statement of invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a self-navigatory root canal irrigation needle with multiple bends.<br>
Brief description of drawing<br>
Figure 1 shows a conventionally used root canal irrigation needle.<br>
Figure 2 shows a self-navigatory root canal irrigation needle of instant invention with three bends.<br>
Description of the present Invention<br>
The present invention is based on the fact that the root canals which may vary in number from two to five lie very close to one another at a variable distance of practically nil to about approx 5mm. It is very tiring for the practitioner to place the tip of the instrument/irrigating needle at the openings of the root canal each time, by looking indirectly through the reflection of the tooth in the dental mirror. Half of the energy of the operating dentists can be saved if the irrigating needle can be placed at the openings of the root canal with a navigational irrigating needle of the present invention, made self-directing with the incorporation of three buoyant bends as in the present invention.<br>
Despite the different types of delivery systems for the root canal irrigating solution available in the market the most commonly used method is of using a blunt / rounded tip needle with the single bend ranging from 30 to 90 degrees.<br>
The present invention incorporates bayonet bends in the range of 2 to 5 in the needle preferably 3 bends as shown in the diagram (example) which can be a little bit adjusted with the help of the grip of the slit of the handle of the tweezers or any holding instrument, to suit a particular tooth and the operator. Similarly, these bends can be also incorporated into any adjustable sleeve or system that will hold the hard or the flexible needle. Since it does not incorporate additional instruments and very less expenditure for the dentists so it is expected that it will readily be taken up in practice by the dentists and help dentist markedly save the working time and also lessen the fatigue to the practitioner.<br>
The multiple-bayonet bend-irrigating needle along with the normal I/M syringe or other delivery systems would be self-navigational and self-directing. The practitioner can locate the opening of the root canal even without looking into the dental mirror. This is a miracle root canal irrigating needle.<br>
