				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(a)	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is related to a	molded depth indicator<br>
for real time display of the stroke of punching cylinder in a punching machine, and more particularly, to one that achieves the real-time display by numeric gear set in decimal mode and linkage to the punching cylinder to help precise readjustment and calibration of the stroke of the punching cylinder.<br>
(b)	Description of the Prior Art:<br>
The molded depth indicator adapted to a punching machine is designed to inspect through an inspection window the stroke of the punching cylinder that drives the upper mold to strike the lower mold and provide real-time numeric display of the depth along with the stroke of the punching cylinder to facilitate setup and calibration of the stroke of the punching cylinder.<br>
Punching machines generally available in the market operate on various types of dies to manufacture products in different profiles through the punch of gravity. The punching stroke varies depending on the type and specification of the dies and the thickness of the material of the work piece. Consequently, the stroke respectively of the upper mold and the lower mold must be readjusted and calibrated whenever the dies is installed or replaced so to secure optimal punching for maintaining consistent operation quality and preventing parts and dies from being damaged due to improper punching.<br>
However, in readjusting the stroke of the punching cylinder, the upper mold as driven by the punching cylinder moves downward for<br>
visual inspection of the resultant length before readjusting its depth.<br><br><br><br>
Even though the distance of the stroke has been measured, it takes trail runs to judge if the finished product meets molding standard and quality requirements. Visual inspection is vulnerable to create errors and it takes longer time to calibrate, and the consistent quality is also frustrated since the quality standard demanded by the individual operator may vary. Furthermore, dies and parts involved on the console may be subject to abnormal tear and wear or damaged due to improper setup of the punching stroke.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary purpose of the present invention is to provide a molded depth indicator that enables the operator of the punching machine to easily read out the stroke of the punching cylinder for a precise readjustment and setup of the upper and the lower limits to protect parts and dies from producing improper punch while maintaining precise calibration of the punching stroke. To achieve the purpose, a decimal numeric display is comprised of a numeric gear set and an number carrying sprocket set; the number of the numeric gear set varies according to the elevation stroke of the punching cylinder in conjunction with the linkage defined by the engagement among a spiral gear disposed on one side of the numeric gear set, a drive a worm gear of the punching cylinder sprocket gear, and a spiral gear on the upper section of a transmission rod of the worm gear.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, a preferred embodiment of the present invention related to a molded depth indicator (1) is mounted to a punching machine (2) at a location preset for an active punching cylinder (5) to drive an upper mold (3) to punch against a lower mold (4) so that a transmission rod (40) of the molded depth indicator (1) is connected to a drive worm gear (6) and a worm (7) of the punching cylinder (5) and thus to enable a numeric gear set (not illustrated) inside the molded depth indicator (1) to synchronously turn for displaying a number indicating the<br><br>
depth of the punching cylinder (5).<br>
As illustrated in Figs. 3 through 11, the preferred embodiment of the pesent invention is essentially comprised of a base (10) accommodated in a casing (11); an inspection window (12) is disposed at the front of the casing (11) to expose an indication panel (13) inserted to inner side of the casing (11). Multiple smaller windows (14) are disposed on the inspection window for numbers of a numeric gear set (20) provided inside the base (10) to display. The numeric gear set (20) is pivoted to a pair of bores (16) provided closer to the front edge on both shorter sides of the base (10) by having an axial rod (15) to penetrate through the axis of the numeric gear set (20). Another pair of bores (18) are provided closer to the rear edge on both shorter sides of the base (10) for an axial bolt (17) to penetrate through and pivot to both bores (18). A number carrying sprocket set (30) penetrates through and pivots to the axial bolt (17). A through hole (19) to receive insertion by a transmission rod (40) is disposed on the bottom of the base (10) at where in relation to the side the numeric gear set (20) is located.<br>
Multiple numeric gear sets (20) are provided as applicable. On one side of each numeric gear (21) is coaxially disposed with a ring gear (21), and each numeric gear (21) and its ring gear (22) are engaged to each other in a decimal pattern for each turn completed. An indention (23) is formed on the peripheral on the other side of each numeric gear (21). The number carrying sprocket set (30) is comprised of multiple rolling sprockets (31) and located between two neighboring numeric gears (21). Multiple teeth of each rolling sprocket (31) are divided into a section of full teeth (32) and a section of rear teeth (33). Only after having completed a full turn of a preceding numeric gear (21), the section of the full teeth (32) is turned by the indention (23) thus to further turn a ring gear (22') from a next numeric gear (21'). Accordingly the next<br><br>
numeric gear (21') is turned to either advance or retreat one scale to complete the decimal turn pattern for each numeric gear (21').<br>
A spiral gear (24) disposed to one end of the axial rod (15) of the numeric gear set (20) meshes with another spiral gear (41) provided on the transmission rod (40) while the transmission rod (40) is linked to the drive worm gear and the worm of the punching cylinder of the punching machine. Accordingly, in the stroke of the punching cylinder to drive the upper mold to punch against the lower mold, the spiral gear (41) of the transmission rod (40) meshes with the spiral gear (24) disposed on one side of the numeric gear (20) to cause each numeric gear (21) to turn in sequence in the decimal pattern. The number of the entire molded depth indicator changes for a real-time display of the actual length between the punching cylinder and the console to enable an operator to achieve easy control of the punching machine while judging the punching stroke of the punching cylinder as displayed by the indicator allowing the operator readjust the punching cylinder to a proper depth. The present invention while effectively maintaining safe and precise operation provides a final solution to flaws and problems including errors due to visual inspection found with the prior art.<br>
Now referring to Figs. 12 through 22, another preferred embodiment of the present invention is essentially comprised of a casing (50) containing a chamber (51); a numeric gear set (60) is pivoted to an axial rod (52) in the chamber; and an number carrying sprocket set (70) pivoted to an axial bolt (53) is provided on one side to the numeric gear set (60). The number carrying sprocket set (70) controls the numeric gear set (60) to change its display number in sequence and in decimal pattern. Two dialing lever sets (80, 80') are respectively disposed on both sides of the numeric gear set (60) to set up the upper and lower limits of the numeric gear set (60). Upon reaching either limit, both dialing lever sets (80, 80')<br><br>
release their contacts from their corresponding limit switches (90, 90') thus to cut off the power supply to the punching machine. A transmission rod (54) penetrating through the casing (50) is disposed at one end of a central axial rod (52) of the numeric gear set (60) and has its lower end connected to the drive worm gear and worm of the punching cylinder of the punching machine. A worm gear (55) is disposed to the upper section of the transmission rod (54) to mesh with a bevel gear (612) of the numeric gear set (60) to enable the display of the numeric gear set (60) varies depending on the stroke of the punching cylinder of the punching machine. The notch of the chamber (51) of the casing (50) is closed up by means of a panel (56) provided with multiple windows, a see-through protection plate (57) and a frame (58).<br>
Wherein, the numeric gear set (60) is comprised in series of multiple numeric gears (62) and a numeric gear (61) of the smallest unit. A rolling shaft (63) connected to a bevel gear (631) is axially disposed on one side of the numeric gear (61). The bevel gear (631) meshes with the worm gear (55) of the transmission rod (54). An auxiliary plate (64) and a dialing plate (641) are disposed to another side of the numeric gear (61). A notch (642) is each provided to the dialing plate (641) and the auxiliary plate (64) in relation to where the number "0" is located on the numeric gear (61). Each numeric gear (62) has on its both sides respectively disposed with setup gears (65, 65'). Two indentions (651, 652) are respectively provided to the peripherals of both setup gears (65, 65'). A ring gear (66) is provided to the outside of the setup gear (65) while an auxiliary plate (67) and a dialing plate (671) are provided to the outside of the setup gear (65'). A notch (672) is each provided to the dialing plate (671) and the auxiliary plate (67) in relation to the numeric gear set (62) at where the number "0" is disposed. The numeric gear designated with the greatest unit is not disposed with the auxiliary plate<br><br>
and the dialing plate. The design of the notch (672) each to the auxiliary plate (67) and the dialing plate (671) allows the numeric gear set (60) working with multiple sprockets (71) of the number carrying sprocket set (70) provided between two neighboring numeric gears (61, 62) take advantage the full section and rear section of sprocket teeth (72, 73) alternatively disposed between those sprockets (71), so that upon complete one turn of the numeric gear (61), both notches (642) of the auxiliary plate (64) and the dialing plate (61) dial the full section of sprocket teeth (72) of the sprocket (71), and further to dial the ring gear (66) of the numeric gear (62) of next place to advance or retreat one scale of that numeric gear (62) for completing the decimal display pattern by the numeric gear set (60).<br>
Both setup dialing lever sets (80, 80') are comprised of dialing lever seat (81) movably pivoted in the chamber (51) of the casing (50) and multiple rolling gears (83) arranged in series with an axial bolt (82). A torsion spring (84) disposed on one side of the dialing lever set (80) provides action inertia and performance for those rolling gears (83) to hold against the circumference of a setup gear (65, 65') of each numeric gear (62) of the numeric gear set (60) while a dialing plate (85) extending from one side of the dialing lever seat (81) maintains holding against a reed (91) of a limit switch (90, 90') to keep the limit switch (90, 90') conducted with the power system of the punching machine. When the setup gears (65, 65') of each numeric gear (62) has their notches (651, 652) aligned with the rolling gear (83) of the setup dialing lever sets (80, 80'), the rolling gear (83) is deprived of its support and is cleared off the limit switch (90, 90') when the torsion spring (84) pushes away the dialing plate (85) of the dialing lever seat (81) to cut off the power supply to the punching machine. Meanwhile, both setup gears (65, 65') respectively disposed on both sides of each numeric gear (62) in relation<br><br>
to both sets of setup dialing levers (80, 80') merely respectively define the upper and the lower limits of the stroke of the punching cylinder. Accordingly, when the number of the numeric gear set (60) reaches either the upper or the lower limit, the power supply to the punching machine is automatically cut off. Limiting the longitudinal travel of the punching cylinder helps avoid parts or dies of the console from being damage or destruction, or even personal injuries due to improper punching; therefore, the numeric gear set (60) of the present invention while displaying the molded depth of the stroke of the punching cylinder provides additional safety protection function.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention of a molded depth indicator by giving real-time display of the depth depending on the stroke of the punching cylinder of the punching machine by taking advantage of a numeric display module comprised of numeric gear set, number carrying sprocket set, and transmission rod in conjunction with linkage of the transmission rod to the drive worm gear and worm of the punching cylinder of the punching machine enables operator easy access to read out and judge the distance and depth of the punching stroke for making proper readjustment and calibration as applicable with extremely precise molded depth indication performance; furthermore, the present invention provides excellent industrial value by providing additional settings of the upper and the lower limits of the punching stroke to avoid damaging parts and dies due to improper punching effectively solves the problems and errors resulted from vision inspection of the depth in the prior art.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
