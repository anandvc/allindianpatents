[See Section 10]<br><br>
"COMPOSITION BASED ON COPOLYCARBONATES"<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a body corporate organised under the laws of Germany., D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention andithe manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
11-3-2003 GRANTED<br><br>
1 <br>
Composition based on Copolycarbonates<br><br>
The invention relates to thermoplastic polycarbonate compositions and moulded parts containing the latter having increased stress cracking resistance and thermal stability.<br>
The stress cracking resistance of moulded parts fabricated from polymers is always important in their production and in the use of the moulded parts if they come into contact with oils, cleaning agents and alcohols. Particularly in automobile construction and other external applications moulded parts that are as resistant as possible to chemicals and that on the one hand are stable at low temperatures and on the other hand exhibit a high thermal stability have been sought for a long time. The object therefore existed of finding a polycarbonate blend that exhibits an improved stress cracking resistance and higher thermal stability compared to polycarbonate blends containing polycarbonate formed from pure 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propane as bisphenol, and that on the other hand retains the advantageous properties of polycarbonate blends such as an excellent low temperature toughness.<br>
Copolycarbonates based on 4,4'-dihydroxydiphenyl and 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propane have already been described as being particularly resistant to chemicals, heat stable and difficultly inflammable (see JP-A 5 117 382, EP-A 0 544 407, US-A 5,470,938, US-A 5,532,324 and US-A 5,401,826), and compared to commercially available polycarbonate formed from pure bisphenol A, have equally good mechanical properties and transparency. However, the prior art does not contain any indication that these copolycarbonates may advantageously be used in polycarbonate blends with retention of the particularly good low temperature properties.<br>
JP-A 03 126 756 describes thermoplastic resin compositions having improved heat resistance, impact strength, and resistance to oil and water. These resins are composed of aromatic polyester resin, aromatic polycarbonate and butadiene rubber.<br>
EP-A 0 403 837 describes thermoplastic polycarbonate moulding compositions based on substituted dihydroxydiphenylcycloalkanes, other aromatic polycarbonates,<br>

Le A 34 674-Foreign<br><br><br>
for example based on bisphenol A, and grafted, particulate diene rubbers, and their use for the production of thermoplastic moulded parts. On account of the dihydroxydipbenylcycloalkanes these moulding compositions have an improved heat resistance while retaining a good notched impact strength.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide themioplastic polycarbonate compositions having an improved stress cracking resistance and improved thermal stability.<br>
This object is achieved by copolycarbonate compositions containing<br>

It has surprisingly been found that even with a small proportion of structural units according to formula (I) in the polycarbonate composition, the stress cracking resistance of moulded parts obtained therefrom is significantly improved.<br>

There may also be used one compound of the formula (IT), with the formation of binary copolycarbonates, as well as a plurality of compounds of the formula (II).<br>
The educts of the formulae (I) and (IT) may obviously contain impurities resulting from the synthesis. A high degree of purity is however desirable and should be aimed for, and accordingly those educts having the highest possible purity are used.<br>
According to DE-A 2 119 779 the production of polycarbonates is carried out under the participation of monomers of the formula (I) preferably in solution, and more Specifically according to the phase boundary process and the homogeneous phase process.<br>
