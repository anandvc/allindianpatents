				<td>SWITCHABLE VALVETRAIN SYSTEM AND METHOD OF OPERATION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to a switchable valvetrain system for an<br>
internal combustion engine and a method of operation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Variable displacement internal combustion engines provide improved<br>
fuel economy and torque on demand by operating on the principle of cylinder<br>
deactivation, sometimes referred to as Active Fuel Management or Displacement on<br>
Demand. During operating conditions that require high output torque, every cylinder<br>
of a variable displacement internal combustion engine is supplied with fuel and air (also<br>
spark, in the case of a gasoline internal combustion engine) to provide torque for the<br>
internal combustion engine. During operating conditions at low speed, low load and/or<br>
other inefficient conditions for a variable displacement internal combustion engine,<br>
cylinders may be deactivated to improve fuel economy for the variable displacement<br>
internal combustion engine and vehicle. For example, in the operation of a vehicle<br>
equipped with an eight cylinder internal combustion engine, fuel economy will be<br>
unproved if the internal combustion engine is operated with only four cylinders during<br>
low torque operating conditions by reduced pumping losses. The cylinders that are<br>
deactivated will disallow the flow of air through their respective intake and exhaust<br>
valves. Since the deactivated cylinders do not allow air to flow, additional losses are<br>
avoided by operating the deactivated cylinders as "air springs" due to the compression<br>
and decompression of the air in each deactivated cylinder. The deactivation of the<br>
valves is typically facilitated by the use of a switchable valvetrain component, such as a<br>
switchable hydraulic lash adjuster.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
[0003]	A switchable valvetrain system is provided having a control unit and a<br>
pressure regulator valve, such as a proportional solenoid pressure regulator valve,<br>
responsive to control signals from the control unit. A pressurized fluid source is<br>
provided in communication with the pressure regulator valve. A switchable valvetrain<br>
component having a latching mechanism and lubrication circuit in selective<br>
communication with the pressurized fluid source through the pressure regulator valve is<br>
also provided. The pressure regulator valve is operable to selectively and variably<br>
communicate fluid pressure from the pressurized fluid source to the latching mechanism<br>
and the lubrication circuit in response to control signals from the control unit.<br>
[0004]	A method of controlling a switchable valvetrain component for an<br>
internal combustion engine is also provided. The switchable valvetrain component<br>
includes a latching mechanism and a lubrication circuit in selective series<br>
communication with a pressurized fluid source. Additionally, the latching mechanism<br>
is responsive to an activation pressure level operable to begin latching of the latching<br>
mechanism and a holding pressure level, higher than the activation pressure level,<br>
effective to maintain the operation of the latching mechanism. The method includes<br>
selectively and intermittently providing fluid pressure to the lubrication circuit of the<br>
valvetrain component at a first fluid pressure level wherein the first fluid pressure is<br>
below the activation fluid pressure required to begin latching of the latching<br>
mechanism. The method may further include providing fluid pressure to the valvetrain<br>
component at a second fluid pressure level wherein the second fluid pressure level is<br>
above the activation pressure level to effect operation or latching of the latching<br>
mechanism. Subsequently, the fluid pressure to the valvetrain component is decreased<br>
to a third fluid pressure level wherein the third fluid pressure level is below the second<br>
fluid level and above the holding pressure level such that the operation of latching<br>
mechanism is maintained. The method may also include reducing fluid pressure from<br>
the third fluid pressure level, below the activation fluid pressure level, to discontinue<br>
operation of the latching mechanism.<br><br>
[0005]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0006]	Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of a switchable valvetrain control<br>
system for use with an internal combustion engine; and<br>
[0007]	Figure 2 is a graphical illustration of a method of controlling the<br>
switchable valvetrain system of Figure 1.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0008]	Referring to the drawings, there is shown in Figure 1 a schematic<br>
depiction of a switchable valvetrain control system, generally indicated at 10. The<br>
switchable valvetrain control system 10 is configured for use with a variable<br>
displacement internal combustion engine (also known as Active Fuel Management or<br>
Displacement on Demand), not shown, and includes a control unit 12, a proportional<br>
solenoid regulator valve 14, a switchable valvetrain component 16, such as a rocker arm<br>
or finger follower, and a lash adjuster 17. The lash adjuster 17 is engageable with the<br>
switchable valvetrain component 16 to account for excess clearance or lash between the<br>
switchable valvetrain component 16 and a poppet valve, not shown. The control unit 12<br>
includes a duty cycle control module 18 operable to determine a duty cycle for a pulse<br>
width modulation driver 20 in response to various inputs 22. The inputs 22 may include<br>
measured or calculated engine oil temperature, engine speed, variable displacement mode<br>
activation flag or signal, etc. A system voltage source 24 provides voltage to enable the<br>
operation of the duty cycle control module 18 and the pulse width modulation driver 20.<br>
Additionally, a system voltage reading circuit 26 is provided to monitor the voltage<br>
provided to the duty cycle control module 18 from the system voltage source 24.<br>
[0009]	The pulse width modulation driver 20 is operable to provide control<br>
signals to the proportional solenoid regulator valve 14. The proportional solenoid<br><br>
regulator valve 14 is in fluid communication with a pressurized fluid source 28. The<br>
proportional solenoid regulator valve 14 is operable to selectively and variably<br>
communicate fluid pressure, indicated by arrows 30, from the pressurized fluid source 28<br>
to the switchable valvetrain component 16, via the lash adjuster 17, in response to control<br>
signals from the pulse width modulation driver 20.<br>
[0010]	The switchable valvetrain component 16 includes lubrication circuits 32<br>
and 32A and a latching mechanism 34. The lubrication circuit 32 is operable to provide<br>
lubrication to the interface between the lash adjuster 17 and the switchable valvetrain<br>
component 16, while the lubrication circuit 32A is operable to provide lubrication to<br>
various valvetrain components, such as camshafts, not shown. The proportional solenoid<br>
regulator valve 14 communicates fluid pressure 30 to each of the lubrication circuits 32<br>
and 32A and latching mechanism 34 via passage 36. As such, the lubrication circuits 32<br>
and 32A and latching mechanism 34 are provided in a series flow relation. The<br>
lubrication circuit 32A receives fluid pressure 30 through an orifice 42 operable to meter<br>
the flow of fluid to the lubrication circuit 32A. The latching mechanism 34 is selectively<br>
operable to effect latching or switching of the switchable valvetrain component 16 to<br>
enable deactivation of the associated valve, not shown, in response to sufficient fluid<br>
pressure 30 supplied through the passage 36. The control strategy or method for<br>
controlling the switchable valvetrain control system 10 is discussed in greater detail<br>
hereinbelow with reference to Figure 2.<br>
[0011]	Referring to Figure 2 and with continued reference to Figure 1, there is<br>
shown a graphical representation of an exemplary control strategy or method 44 for<br>
controlling the switchable valvetrain control system 10 of Figure 1. The control method<br>
44 includes a commanded fluid pressure curve 46 which is plotted as a function of time.<br>
The activation fluid pressure level is the fluid pressure 30, shown in Figure 1, required to<br>
begin operation or latching of the latching mechanism 34, shown in Figure 1, and is<br>
represented by line 48, shown in Figure 2, while the holding fluid pressure level is the<br>
fluid pressure required to maintain the latching mechanism 34 in the latched or<br>
operational state and is represented by line 50. Additionally, line 52 represents the fluid<br>
pressure level of the fluid pressure source 28 or supply pressure level.<br><br>
[0012]	In accordance with the control method 44, at time ti the switchable<br>
valvetrain component 16 is in an activated state or mode and the control unit 12<br>
commands the proportional solenoid regulator valve 14 to provide fluid pressure at a<br>
pressure value Pi to the switchable valvetrain component 16. The pressure value Pi is<br>
below the activation fluid pressure level (line 48) such that fluid pressure is provided to<br>
the lubrication circuits 32 and 32A, but is of insufficient magnitude to effect the latching<br>
of the latching mechanism 34. The proportional solenoid regulator valve 14 discontinues<br>
communication of fluid pressure 30 to the switchable valvetrain component at time t2.<br>
Similarly, at time t3, the control unit 12 commands the proportional solenoid regulator<br>
valve 14 to provide fluid pressure at a pressure value Pi to the switchable valvetrain<br>
component 16 and discontinues communication of fluid pressure 30 to the switchable<br>
valvetrain component 16 at time t4. By selectively and intermittently communicating<br>
fluid pressure 30 from the pressurized fluid source 28 to the switchable valvetrain<br>
mechanism 16, the proportional solenoid regulator valve 14 provides the required fluid<br>
pressure 30 to adequately lubricate the valvetrain, via lubrication circuits 32 and 32A<br>
while minimizing the fluid flow requirements and the losses associated therewith. The<br>
fluid pressure value P1 amd the time intervals (i.e. t4-t3 and t2-t1) may be predetermined to<br>
provide optimal lubrication at various operating conditions such as engine speed,<br>
temperature, engine load, pressure of the pressurized fluid source 28, and fluid viscosity.<br>
[0013]	Upon receipt of the variable displacement mode activation flag or signal<br>
input 22 to the control unit 12, the control unit 12 will command the proportional<br>
solenoid regulator valve 14 to communicate fluid pressure from the pressurized fluid<br>
source 28 at a value of P2. The fluid pressure value P2 is substantially greater than the<br>
activation fluid pressure level (line 48) and is approximately equal to the supply<br>
pressure level. As such, the fluid pressure value P2 is sufficient to enable operation or<br>
latching of the latching mechanism 34 of the switchable valvetrain component 16. By<br>
providing fluid at the relatively high fluid pressure level P2, the switching response of<br>
the switchable valvetrain component 16 is increased and the variation in switching<br>
performance of the switchable valvetrain component 16 is reduced. The control unit 12<br>
will maintain the fluid pressure value P2 until time t6 at which time the fluid pressure<br><br>
level is reduced to a pressure level P3. The pressure level P3 is greater than the holding<br>
fluid pressure level (line 50) and therefore the latching mechanism 34 is maintained in<br>
the latched state. The time interval t6-t5 is predetermined and should provide sufficient<br>
time to effect the latching of the latching mechanism 34. By initially increasing the<br>
fluid pressure value to P2, the speed and reliability of operation of the latching<br>
mechanism 34 is increased and by subsequently reducing the fluid pressure value from<br>
P2 to P3, the fluid pressure and the losses associated therewith is reduced. At time t7 the<br>
operation of the latching mechanism 34 is discontinued by reducing the fluid pressure<br>
value from P3 to zero thereby decreasing the fluid pressure 30 supplied to the<br>
switchable valvetrain mechanism 16 below the holding fluid pressure level (line 50)<br>
such that the switchable valvetrain mechanism 16 is reactivated.<br>
[0014]	An exemplary method of operation is as follows: A) selectively and<br>
intermittently providing fluid pressure 30 to the lubrication circuits 32 and 32A of the<br>
switchable valvetrain component 16 at a first fluid pressure level P1 wherein the first<br>
fluid pressure level P1 is below the activation fluid pressure level (line 48) required to<br>
begin latching of the latching mechanism 34; B) determining whether the latching<br>
mechanism 34 should be latched; C) if so, providing fluid pressure 30 to the switchable<br>
valvetrain component 16 at a second fluid pressure level P2 for a predetermined amount<br>
of time, i.e. the time interval t6-t5, wherein the second fluid pressure level P2 is above<br>
the activation pressure level (line 48) to effect latching of the latching mechanism 34;<br>
D) subsequently, decreasing fluid pressure 30 to the switchable valvetrain component<br>
16 to a third fluid level P3 wherein the third fluid pressure level P3 is below the second<br>
fluid level P2 and above the holding pressure level (line 50) such that the latching of<br>
latching mechanism 34 is maintained; E) determining whether latching of the latching<br>
mechanism 34 should be discontinued; and F) if so, reducing fluid pressure 30 from the<br>
third fluid pressure level P3 below the activation fluid pressure level (line 48) to<br>
discontinue latching of the latching mechanism 34.<br>
[0015]	While the discussion above has focused on a switchable valvetrain<br>
component 16 for use with a variable displacement valvetrain, the switchable valvetrain<br><br>
component 16 may be used within other valvetrain architectures requiring switching<br>
capabilities, such as so-called two-step valvetrain architectures operable to provide two<br>
distinct valve lifts in lieu of an active state and a deactivated state. While the best modes<br>
for carrying out the invention have been described in detail, those familiar with the art to<br>
which this invention relates will recognize various alternative designs and embodiments<br>
for practicing the invention within the scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
