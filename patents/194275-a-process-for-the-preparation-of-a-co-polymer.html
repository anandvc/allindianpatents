				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of (GO)polymers which employs cyclic ketone peroxides and to the use of these cyclic ketone peroxides as initiators in (co)polymerization.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
A wide variety of peroxy compounds is known from the literature as initiators for polymer production. A fairly great number of these are commercially used. See, for example, the product catalogue of Akzo Nobel entitled "Initiators for polymer production", 1992, in which several dozens of initiators for radical polymerization have been mentioned under the trademarks Laurox®, Lucidol®, Perkadox® and Trigonox®. Other examples of commercially available initiators are included in the Akzo Nobel range of products sold under the trademarks Butanox® and Cyclonox®, respectively ^^.<br>
Commercially available initiators for polymer production may be classified in different chemical groups, which include diacyl-peroxides, peroxydicarbonates, dialkylperoxides, peroxyesters, peroxyketals, hydroperoxides, and ketone peroxides.<br>
Various  ketone  peroxides  have  also been described  in  the<br>
polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers.<br>
For example, U.S. Patent 3,149,126 discloses some peroxides derived from the interaction of 1,3- and 1,4-diketones, which<br><br>
are said to be useful inter alia as catalysts in polymerization reactions and in the cross-linking of polymers. The cyclic ketone peroxide identified as Compound VII is only obtained in an analytical amount and described as very volatile, sensitive to shock and exploding with considerable brisance.<br>
U.S. Patent 3,003,000 discloses a group of peroxides which are said to be useful as catalysts in polymerization reactions and as accelerators of diesel fuel combustion. These formulations may include cyclic ketone peroxides which are formed in side reactions leading to cyclic condensations products. However, the compositions disclosed in this reference clearly contain only minor amounts of cyclic ketone peroxides.<br>
U.S. Patent 3,632,606 discloses fluorinated organic cyclic peroxides which are stated to be much more stable thermally than the corresponding hydrocarbon cyclic peroxides, which can be used, besides their utility as oxidants, as polymerization initiators.<br>
German Offenlegungsschrift 21 32 315 discloses trimeric cyclo-ketone peroxides and in particular tricycloalkylidenperoxides are said to be useful as initiators for polymerization. The disclosure merely concentrates on synthetical aspects of preparing these structures.<br>
British Patent 827,511 discloses formulations of ketone peroxides in paraffinic diesel oil. These formulations may include cyclic ketone peroxides though the goal of this publication is to minimize the amount of cyclic peroxide present in the compositions and thus such compositions contain only minor amounts of cyclic ketone peroxides. Moreover, the reference does not suggest the use of these formulations in polymer production.<br>
British Patent 912,061 discloses formulations of ketone peroxides in dimethyl phthalate and paraffinic diesel oil.<br><br>
These formulations may contain minor amounts of cyclic ketone peroxides. No teaching was given with respect to the possible use as initiators for polymerization.<br>
British Patent 1,072,728 discloses stabilized ketone peroxide compositions formulated in safety solvents which are selected from alcohols and glycols. Such compositions optionally contain diluents other than the safety solvents, such diluents being phthalate esters. These ketone peroxide formulations also contain only minor proportions of cyclic ketone peroxides. Again, no teaching was given as to the possible use as polymerization initiators.<br>
International Patent Applications PCT/EP95/02829 and PCT/EP95/ 02830, both filed on July 14, 1995 and not prepublished, disclose transportable, storage stable cyclic ketone peroxide compositions comprising 1.0-90% by weight of one or more cyclic ketone peroxides and 10-99% by weight of one or more diluents selected from the group of liquid phlegmatizers, plasticizers, solid polymeric carriers, inorganic supports, organic peroxides, and mixtures thereof, as well as the use of these cyclic ketone peroxide formulations in the modification of (co)polymers.<br>
Commercial formulations of methylethyl ketone peroxide and methylisobutyl ketone peroxide are known to be mixtures of several different ketone peroxide compounds, among which the non-cyclic ketone peroxides predominate. However, these ketone peroxides do contain some sm^all quantities of cyclic ketone pero-sf-iiioo which result from side reactions during the preparation of the methylethyl and methylisobutyl ketone peroxides. For example, in commercially available methylethyl ketone peroxides about 1-4% of the total active oxygen content is attributable to cyclic ketone peroxides, j Although the aforementioned peroxides are known for use in the initiation of polymerization reactions, their performance in.<br><br>
for example, acrylic (co)polymerization and the curing of unsaturated polyesters at higher temperatures (i.e. above about 100°C), is disappointing and they often cause yellowing of the polymer. Furthermore, many commercially available peroxides generate undesired by-products.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for polymerization initiators which provide improved performance. These and other objects of the present invention will be apparent from the summary and detailed description of the present invention which follow.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
In one aspect, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of (co)polymers of ethylenically unsaturated monomers employing a peroxide composition comprising at least one organic peroxide as an initiator. The process is further characterized in that at least 20%, preferably from about 50%, for example 60%, and most preferably about 70% of the total active oxygen content of the organic peroxide "is attributable to at least one cyclic ketone peroxide selected from peroxides represented by the formulas I-III:<br><br>
wherein  Ri-Re  are  independently  selected  from  the  group<br><br>
consisting of hydrogen, C1-C20 alkyl, C3-C20 cycloalkyl, Cg-Czo aryl, C7-C20 aralkyl and C7-C2o alkaryl, which groups may include linear or branched alkyl moieties; and each of Ri-Rg may be optionally substituted with one or more groups selected from Ci-C20 alkyl, linear or branched, C3-C20 cycloalkyl, Cg-Cjo aryl, C-,-C20 aralkyl, hydroxy, Ci-Cjo alkoxy, Cg-Czo aryloxy, C7-C20 aralkoxy, C^-Cjo alkaryloxy, RiC(0)0-, RiOC(O)-, halogen (in particular chorine and bromine), carboxy, nitrile and amido; or R1/R2, R3/R4 and Rs/Rg each may, together with the carbon atom to which they are attached, form a 3 to 20 atoms membered cycloaliphatic ring which may be optionally substituted with one or more groups selected from C^-Cjo alkyl, linear or branched, C3-C20 cycloalkyl, Cg-Cjo aryl, C7-C20 aralkyl, hydroxy, C1-C20 alkoxy, C6-C20 aryloxy, C7-C20 aralkoxy, C^-Cjo alkaryloxy, RiC(0)0-, RiOC(O)-, halogen (in particular chorine and bromine), carboxy, nitrile and amido.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention also relates to new cyclic ketone peroxides with the formulas I-III wherein Rj-Rg have the meanings defined above, and to compositions containing such new compounds.<br>
In still another aspect, the present invention relates to the use of an organic peroxide composition wherein at least 20%, preferably from about 50%, for example 60%, and most preferably about 70% of the total active oxygen content is attributable to at least one cyclic ketone peroxide selected from peroxides represented by the formulas I-III wherein Rj-Rg have the same meaning as defined above; to prepare (co)polymers.<br>
The peroxides of the formulas I-III provide a performance in polymer initiation processes which is superior to their non-cyclic dialkyl ketone peroxide counterparts and comparable to the performance of other commercially available types of peroxides. They offer the further advantage that the amount of undesirable by-products which are generated by side-reactipns of the peroxides during their decomposition, is considerably<br><br>
reduced.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The word " (co) polymer" as used in this application should be interpreted to mean "polymers and copolymers". The term "ketone peroxide" as used in this application should be interpreted to include peroxides derived from both ketones and aldehydes.<br>
The peroxides of the formulas I-III can be made by reacting a ketone with hydrogen peroxide as is described in U.S. Patent 3,003,000; Uhlmann, 3rd Edition, Vol. 13, pp. 256-57 (1962); the article, "Studies in Organic Peroxides. XXV. Preparation, Separation and Identification of Peroxides Derived from Methyl Ethyl Ketone and Hydrogen Peroxide," Milas, N.A. and Golubovic, A., J. Am. Chem. Soc. . Vol. 81, pp. 5824-26 (1959), Organic Peroxides. Swern, D. editor, Wiley-Interscience, New York (1970) and Houben-Weyl Methoden der Organische Chemie, E13, Volume 1, page 736, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Suitable ketones for use in the synthesis of the present peroxides include, for example, acetone, acetophenone, methyl-n-amyl ketone, ethylbutyl ketone, ' ethylpropyl ketone, methyl-isoamyl ketone, methylheptyl ketone, methylhexyl ketone, ethyl-amyl ketone, dimethyl ketone, diethylketone, dipropyl ketone, methylethyl ketone, methylisobutyl ketone, methylisopropyl ketone, methylpropyl ketone, methyl-t-butyl ketone, isobutyl-heptyl ketone, diisobutyl ketone, 2,4-pentanedione, 2,4-hexane-dione, 2,4-heptanedione, 3,5-heptanedione, 3,5-octanedione, 5-methyl-2,4-hexanedione, 2,6-dimethyl-3,5-heptanedione, 2,4-oc-tanedione, 5,5-dimethyl-2,4-hexanedione, 6-methyl-2,4-heptane-dione, 1-phenyl-1,3-butanedione, 1-phenyl-1,3-pentanedione, 1,3-diphenyl-l,3-propanedione, l-phenyl-2,4-pentanedione, methylbenzyl ketone, phenylmethyl ket-oee, phenylethyl ketone, methylchloromethyl ketone, methylbromomethyl ketone and coupling products  thereof.  Suitable cyclic ketones  include<br><br>
cyclopentanone, 2-methylcyclopentanone, 3-methylcyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, 2-methylcyclohexanone, 3-methylcyclohexanone, 4-methylcyclohexanone, 4-t-butylcyclohexanone, 4-t-amylcyclo-hexanone, 4-methoxycyclohexanone, 3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexanone, 2-chlorocyclohexanone, cycloheptanone, cyclooctanone, 2-chloro-cyclooctanone, cyclononanone, cyclodecanone, cycloundecanone, cyclododecanone, cyclotridecanone, cyclotetradecanone, cyclo-pentadecanone, cyclohexadecanone, cycloheptadecanone, cyclo-octadecanone, cyclononadecanone and cycloeicosanone.<br>
Of course, other ketones having the appropriate R groups corresponding to the peroxides of the formulas I-III can be employed, as well as mixtures of two or more different ketones. Such mixtures also include mixtures of different ketones leading to mixed dimers and mixed trimers, mixtures of dimers of different ketones, mixtures of trimers of different ketones and mixtures of dimers and trimers of different ketones.<br>
Examples of preferred peroxides of the formulas I-III for use ' in accordance with the present invention are the cyclic ketone peroxides derived from acetone, acetylacetone, methylethyl ketone, methylpropyl ketone, methylisopropyl ketone, methyl-butyl ketone, methylisobutyl ketone, methylamyl ketone, methyl-isoamylketone, methylhexyl ketone, methylheptyl ketone, diethyl ketone, ethylpropyl ketone, ethylamyl ketone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, 2-methylcyclohexanone, 3,5,5-trimethylcyclo¬hexanone, cyclododecanone, and mixtures thereof. In the compounds of formula II, preferably no more than one or two cycloaliphatic rings are present.<br>
The peroxides can be prepared, transported, stored and applied as such or in the foi'm of, e.g., powders, granules, flakes, pastes and solutions. These formulations may optionally be phlegmatized, as necessary, depending on the particular peroxide and its concentrati'DTr'in the formulation.<br>
Which of these forms is to be preferred partly depends on the<br><br>
ease of feeding the peroxide into the polymerization process. Also, considerations of safety may play a role to the extent that phlegmatizers may have to be incorporated in certain compositions to ensure their safety. As examples of suitable phlegmatizers may be mentioned solid carrier materials such as inert plasticizers, solvents and inert diluents such as silicone oils, white oils, high boiling hydrocarbons such as isododecane, and water.<br>
The present cyclic ketone peroxides are well suited for use as initiators for polymer production and in particular the preparation of acrylic (co)polymers, polystyrene, polyethylene and the curing of unsaturated polyester resins (by processes such as SMC, BMC, pulltrusion, etc). In styrene polymerization, when using the cyclic ketone peroxides of the present invention, a low residual monomer content is achieved by either suspension or bulk polymerization. Accordingly, in one aspect the present invention comprises a process for the preparation of acrylic (co)polymers, ethylenic (co)polymers, styrenic (co)polymers, and, at higher temperatures (i.e. above about 100°C), unsaturated polyesters, using the cyclic ketone peroxides represented in formulas I, II and III.<br>
In the present invention, polymerization is conducted by any conventional process, except that a specified radical polymerization initiator (or composition) is used. The polymerization processes may be carried out in the usual manner, for example in bulk, suspension, emulsion or solution. In the case of production of ethylene (co)polymers the reaction is usuallv carried out under hiT^ 'OTf^^f^^ivf^-. e.cj. about 1000 to about 3500 bar.<br>
The amount of the initiator, which varies depending on the polymerization temperature, the capacity for removing the heat of polymerization, and, when applicabl'e, the kind of monomer to be used and the applied pressure, should be an amount effective to achieve polymerization. Usually, from 0.001-25% weight of<br><br>
peroxide, based on the weight of the (co)polymer, should be employed. Preferably, from 0.001-20% weight and most preferably from 0.001-15% weight of peroxide is employed.<br>
The polymerization temperature for most reactions within the present invention is usually 50° to 450°C, preferably 120° to 350°C. When it is below 50°C, the polymerization time becomes too long. However, when it exceeds 450°C, the radical poly¬merization initiator is spent in the initial stage of the poly¬merization, making it difficult to attain a high conversion. In order to reduce the amount of unreacted monomer, however, it is also possible to conduct polymerization using a temperature profile, e.g. to perform the initial polymerization at 90°C and then elevate the temperature above 115°C to complete the polymerization. These variations are all known to the man skilled in the art, who will have no difficulty in selecting the reaction conditions of choice, depending on the particular polymerization process and the specific radical polymerization initiator to be used.<br>
In order to clearly distinguish the present cyclic ketone peroxides from prior art ketone peroxides which contained some cyclic ketone peroxides as an impurity therein, it is required that at least 2 0 percent of the total active oxygen content of the peroxide(s) employed in the (co)polymerization process of the present invention be attributable to one or more cyclic ketone peroxide(s). More preferably, the cyclic ketone peroxides provide at least 50 percent of the total active oxygen content of the composition which is employed in the polyme^r-i y.atTon process, for example 60%. Most preferably, at least 70% of the total active oxygen content of the peroxide composition used in the (co)polymerization process is attributable to the cyclic ketone peroxide(s). Comparative examples included herein demonstrate the advantages of these cyclic ketone peroxides over their non-cyclic counterparts.<br>
During (co)polymerization, the formulations may also contain<br><br>
the usual additives and fillers. As examples of such additives may be mentioned: stabilizers such as inhibitors of oxidative, thermal or ultraviolet degradation, lubricants, extender oils, pH controlling substances such as calcium carbonate, release agents, colorants, reinforcing or non-reinforcing fillers such as silica, clay, chalk, carbon black and fibrous materials such as glass fibers, plasticizers, diluents, chain transfer agents, accelerators and other types of peroxides. These additives may be employed in the usual amounts.<br>
Suitable monomers for polymerization using the cyclic ketone derived peroxides according to the present invention are olefinic or ethylenically unsaturated monomers, for example substituted or unsubstituted vinyl aromatic monomers, including styrene, a-methylstyrene, p-methylstyrene and halogenated styrenes; divinylbenzene; ethylene; ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids and derivatives thereof such as (meth)acrylic acids, (meth)acrylic esters, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, 2-ethyl-hexyl methacrylate, and glycidyl methacrylate; ethylenically unsaturated nitriles and amides such as acrylonitrile, meth-acrylonitrile and acrylamide; substituted or unsubstituted ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as butadiene, isoprene and chloroprene; vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate and vinyl propionate; ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acids and their derivatives including mono- and diesters, anhydrides and imides, such as maleic anhydride, citraconic anhydride, citraconic acid, itaconic acid, nadic anhydride, maleic acid, fumaric acid, aryl, alkyl and aralkyl citraconimides and maleiraides; vinyl halides such as vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride; vinylethers such as methylvinylether and n-butyl-vinylether; olefins such as isobutene and 4-methylpentene; allyl compounds such as (di)allyl esters, for example diallyl phthalates, (di)allyl carbonates, and triallyl (iso)cyanurate.<br>
; Unsaturated polyester resins "d^t can be cured by the cyclic ketone peroxides according to the present invention usually include an unsaturated polyester and one or more ethylenically<br><br>
unsaturated monomers. Suitable polymerizable monomers include styrene,   a-methylstyrene,   p-methylstyrene,   chlorostyrenes, bromostyrenes,  vinylbenzyl  chloride,  divinylbenzene,  diallyl maleate,   dibutyl  fumarate,  triallyl • phosphate,   triallyl cyanurate,   diallylphthalate,   diallyl   fumarate,   methyl (met)acrylate,  n-butyl  (met)acrylate,  ethyl  acrylate,  and mixtures  thereof,   which  are  copolymerizable  with  the unsaturated polyesters. The unsaturated polyesters are,  for example,  polyesters as they are obtained by esterifying at least one ethylenically unsaturated di- or polycarboxylic acid, anhydride or acid halide, such as maleic acid, fumaric acid, glutaconic acid,  itaconic acid,  mesaconic acid,  citraconic acid, allylmalonic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid, and others, with saturated and unsaturated di- or polyols, such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 1,2- and 1,3-propanediols, 1,2-, 1,3- and 1,4-butanediols, 2,2-dimethyl-l,3-propanediols,    2-hydroxymethyl-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol,    2-buten-1,4-diol,    2-butyn-l,4-diol,    2,4,4 -trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol, glycerol, pentaerythritol, mannitol, and others. The di- or polycarboxylic acids may be partially replaced by saturated di- or polycarboxylic acids, such as adipic acid, succinic  acid  and  others,  and/or  by  aromatic  di-  or polycarboxylic acids, such as phthalic acid, trimellitic acid, pyromellitic acid, isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid. The acids used may be substituted by groups such as halogen. Suitable halogenated acids include, for example, tetrachloro-phthalic acid and tetrabromophthalic acid.<br>
Finally, the polymerization process of the present invention rR-n be employed to introduce functional groups into (co) -polymers. This may be accomplished by employing a peroxide of the formulas I-III which contains one or more functional "R" groups attached thereto. These functional groups will remain intact in the free radicals formed by the cyclic ketone peroxides and thus are introduced into the (co) polymerT"' Conventional polymerization conditions and equipment may .be used to achieve this object of the present invention.<br><br>
In the case of unsaturated polyester ("UP") resins the application of the cyclic ketone peroxides is confined to temperatures &gt;100°C. For these temperatures the preparation Trigonox C (t-butyl peroxy benzoate; hereinafter also referred to as "Tx C") is commercially used to a large extent, mostly in combination with more reactive peroxides such as t-butyl peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate (Trigonox 21) or bis(4-t-butylcyclo-hexyl peroxydicarbonate (Perkadox 16).<br>
Usually, a temperature of about 100-250°C and more preferably about 100-200°C, is employed. The heating time is generally between 0.1 and 30 minutes and, more preferably, between 0.5 and 5 minutes. The reaction is most preferably carried out in a moulding press or pulltrusion die.<br>
The advantages of cyclic ketone peroxides according to the invention in the UP application area compared with t-butyl peroxy benzoate are the inability of benzene formation and reduction of other volati],es such as t-butanol, which are environmental issues. It has been found that cyclic ketone peroxides provide an improved long term stability of the formulations to be used for HPM or pulltrusion, compared with non-cyclic counterparts such as methyl isopropyl ketone Type 3.<br>

Methods Used in the Examples<br>
Determination of total active oxycren content of the cyclic and non-cyclic peroxides used<br>
The total active oxygen content was measured by placing 50 ml of glacial acetic acid in a 250 ml round-bottomed flask fitted with a ground glass joint, an inlet tube for nitrogen gas, a heating mantle and a 70 cm. long air condenser. Nitrogen gas was then passed over the liquid with heating until the liquid boiled. After 2 minutes of boiling, 5 ml of 770 g/1 potassium iodide solution was added and a sample containing approximately 2 meq of active oxygen was added to the reaction mixture with mixing. The air condenser was then connected and the contents of the flask were heated rapidly to boiling and maintained at moderate boiling for 30 minutes. Water (50 ml) was then added through the condenser and the condenser was removed from the flask. The reaction mixture was then immediately titrated with a 0.1 N sodium thiosulphate solution until the yellow color disappeared. A blank should be run alongside this titration.<br>
The total active oxygen may then by calculated by subtracting the volume in ml of sodium thiosulphate solution used in the blank from the amount used in the titration, multiplying this figure by the normality of the sodium thiosulphate solution and then by 800, and finally dividing by the mass of the peroxide sample in milligrams.<br>
Determination of the active oxygen content of tfle non-cyclic peroxides used<br>
The active oxygen content was measured by placing 20 ml of glacial acetic acid in a 200 ml round-bottomed flask fitted with a ground glass joint and an inlet tube for nitrogen gas.<br><br>
Nitrogen gas was then passed over the surface of the liquid. After 2 minutes, 4 ml of 770 g/1 potassium iodide solution was added and a sample containing approximately 1.5 meq of active oxygen was added to the reaction mixture with mixing. The reaction mixture was allowed to stand for at least 1 minute at 25°C ± 5°C. The reaction mixture was then titrated with a 0.1 N sodium thiosulphate solution to colorless end point adding 3 ml of 5 g/1 starch solution towards the end of the titration. A blank should be run alongside this titration.<br>
The active oxygen is then calculated by subtracting the volume in ml of sodium thiosulphate solution used in the blank from the amount used in the titration, multiplying this figure by the normality of the sodium thiosulphate solution and then by 800, and finally dividing by the mass of the peroxide sample in milligrams.<br>
Analysis of the resulting resins<br>
Solids content: Solids content were determined as percentage non-volatile material (30 min. at 150°C).<br>
Mw and dispersity (D): Molecular weights were determined by Gel Permeation Chromatography using polystyrene standards.<br>
Residual styrene: Residual styrene was determined by GC on a solution of the polymer in dichloromethane using n-butylbenzene or t-butylbenzene as an internal standard.<br>
In the following examples, all amounts are given in percent by weight, based on the amount of monomer employed, unless otherwise specified.<br>

Testing of cyclic ketone peroxides as polymerization initiators<br>
I.  High Temperature Curing (&gt;100'C)<br>
The area of High Temperature Curing consists of Hot Press Moulding (HPM) such as SMC, BMC, ZMC, TMC but also pulltrusion. These techniques are described in the Handbook of Thermoset Plastics, Chapter 4: "Unsaturated Polyester and Vinyl Ester Resins", ed. S. H. Goodman.<br>
Comparative Example A<br>
A BMC formulation was prepared by mixing the ingredients by means of a Z-blade Mixer for 5 min. After a thickening period of 7 days the BMC was pressed at 150°C/75 bar pressure on SMC-Reactomer of SMC Technologie Aachen. The curing performance was measured by changes in displacement, temperature and pressure, measured by senors in the mould cavity. The residual styrene was determined by extraction in dichloromethane followed by GC-analysis.<br>
The BMC formulation consists of:<br>
-	100 parts of resin (e.g. Palatal® P17 ex BASF)<br>
-	200 parts of filler Durcal® 5<br>
75 parts of 6 mm chopped glass fibers 5 parts zinc stearate 5 parts of styrene<br>
1.5 parts Luvatol® MK35 (thickening agent) 1.5 o^rts of Tri<tcnox c></tcnox>
The BMC was pressed at 150°C for 150 seconds. The Maximum Flow Time (MFT) in sec. Minimum Moulding Time (MMT) in sec. and Residual Styrene (RS) in % are mentioned in Table 1 below.<br><br>
Excunple 1<br>
Instead of 1,5% of Trigonox C, the cyclic methylisopropyl ketone trimer (MIPKP cyclic) in Primol 352 (Composition J) was ■used on equal "active oxygen" content compared with Trigonox C. The shelflife of the prepared BMC paste showed to be longer than two months at 30°C. The results are mentioned in Table 1 below.<br>
Comparative Example B<br>
Instead of 1.5% of Trigonox C, the non-cyclic methylisopropyl ketone peroxide (MIPKP T3) in Solvesso® 100 was used on equal active oxygen content compared with Trigonox C. The shelflife of the prepared BMC paste showed to be less than 1 week at 30°C. The results are mentioned in Table 1 below.<br>
Comparative Example C<br>
For application with a Class A surface a L(ow) P(rofile) additive, the Synolite 7233-M-l was used. As binder systems the Palatal P18 (65 parts) and the Synolite 7233-M-l (35 parts) were used instead of Palatal P17. As initiator system a combination of Trigonox C and Trigonox 21 was used in a ratio of 1.25/0.25%. The BMC formulation was prepared in the same way as described in Example 1. The results are mentioned in Table 1 below.<br>
Example 2<br>
Instead of 1.25% of Trigonox C, the cyclic methyl isopropyl ketone (MIPKP-cyclic) in DBP (Composition C) was used on equal active oxygen content compared with Trigonox C. The results are mentioned in Table 1 below.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
.Instead of 1.25% of Trigonox C, the cyclic 2-methyleyelohexan-one peroxide (2-MCHP-cyclic) in styrene (Composition H) was iJsed on equal active oxygen content compared with Trigonox C. The results are mentioned in Table 1 below.<br>
Example 4<br>
Instead of 1.5% of Trigonox C the acetyl acetone cyclic peroxide in dibutylphthalate (Composition I) was used on equal active oxygen content compared with Trigonox C. The results are mentioned in Table 1 below.<br><br>
II.  High solids acirylics<br>
Cyclic ketone peroxides were tested for the production of high solids acrylic resins. The properties of the res iris"'produced using the cyclic ketone peroxides were compared to those pf resins produced using non-cyclic ketone derived peroxides and<br><br>
initiators  currently  used  in  industry  for  this  type  of polymerization.<br>
The  initiators  were  tested  in  polymerization  under  the following conditions:<br>
Monomer mixture 4 0 pbw butyl acrylate 2 8 pbw hydroxyethyl methacrylate 2 0 pbw styrene 10 pbw methyl methacrylate 2 pbw methacrylic acid<br>
+40 pbw solvent<br>
Initiator concentration: As indicated in Table 2 below.<br>
The initiator was added to the monomers in the amount indicated in Table 2 below.- This mixture was added to the solvent kept at the indicated reaction temperature in about 4 hrs. The reaction was continued for about 1 hr after the addition of the monomers/initiator mixture was completed.<br>
Results for the developmental cyclic ketone peroxides and comparative non-cyclic ketone peroxides and initiators currently used in industry are given in Table 2 below.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
From these experiments it can be concluded that the cycxic ketone peroxides according to the invention can be used to prepare clear, colorless low molecular weight acrylic resins, whereas the polymerization initiated by their non-cyclic counterparts is a fierce, heavily refluxing reaction, which jives lower conversion and results in colored, relatively high nolecular weight resins.<br>
III.  Expandable Polystyrene (EPS)<br>
In order to judge its performance in EPS, cyclic methyl-isopropyl-ketone peroxide was tested as second stage initiator (to reduce residual styrene) and compared to other initiators applied to this purpose in expandable polystyrene production.<br>
Conditions of polymerization<br>
The suspension polymerization of styrene was carried out in a one liter stainless steel autoclave equipped with one baffle ., and a three blade impeller.<br>
Recipe<br>
Water	-.260	g<br>
Styrene	:	250	g<br>
Tricalcium phosphate	:	1.25	g<br>
Polyvinylalcohol	:	25	mg<br>
Na-dodecylbenzenesulphonate	:	20	mg<br>
Dibenzoyl peroxide	:	0.98	meq/lOO g styrene<br>
Second stage initiator	:	0.46	meq/lOO g styrene<br>
Temperature	scheme<br>
20-90°C	: 1.56 °C/min. heating rate<br>
90°C	: 4.25 hrs (first stage)<br>
go-lSCC	: 0.66 °C/min. heating rate<br>
130°C	: 3 hrs (second stage)   ~'<br>
At the end of the first stage the reactor was pressurized with<br><br>
nitrogen (5 bars).<br>
After polymerization the reaction mixture was acidified to pH 1 and stirred for approximately 30 min to remove all tricalcium phosphate.<br>
Subsequently the beads were:<br>
-	washed with demineralized water to pH&gt;6<br>
-	washed with water containing 25 mg/kg of Armostat 4 00<br>
-	dried for 5 hours at room temperature.<br>
The results of the evaluation are given in Table 3 below.<br><br>
It can be concluded from these experiments that the cyclic .methylisopropyl ketone peroxide is an effective second stage catalyst to reduce residual styrene in EPS. The resulting residual styrene level is much lower than the level obtained<br><br>
when using non-cyclic methylisopropyl ketone peroxide and similar to that obtained using commercial initiators currently used in industry.<br>
IV.  Styrene butylacrylate copolymers<br>
Certain cyclic ketone peroxides according to the invention were zested as initiators for the mass copolymerization of styrene and n-butyl acrylate. Mass polymerizations were carried out in 3 ml brown glass ampoules. The monomer mixture of styrene (80 parts by weight) and n-butylacrylate (20 parts by weight) was polymerized at 120 °C, using an initiator concentration of 0.75 meq/lOO g of monomer mixture. The results are given in Table 4 below.<br><br>
It can be concluded from these experiments that the cyclic ketone peroxides according to the invention are excellently suited for the high conversion bulk polymerization of styrene acrylic copolymers. The resulting resin has a higher molecular weight than obtained when using commercially available initiators like Trigonox C and Trigonox 22-E75. The non-cyclic<br><br>
ketone peroxide MIPKP-T3 does not provide an acceptable conversion.<br>
V.  Styrene mass-polymerization<br>
To evaluate the effectiveness of cyclic ketone derived per¬oxides as chaser catalyst to reduce residual styrene in the last stages of styrene mass polymerization, a styrene polymer (Mw 260.000, Mn 95.000) was swollen with 20% styrene monomer. To 10 0 g of this polymer/monomer mixture 0.03 meq. initiator was added. Mass polymerizations were carried out in 3 ml brown glass ampoules. These ampoules were put in an oil bath at room temperature. Temperature was increased to 180°C in about 20 min. and kept at 180°C for 4 hrs, after which the ampoules were taken form the oil bath and allowed to cool to room temperature. Residual styrene levels after 4 hrs of polymerization as determined by GC are shown in Table 5.<br><br>
From these experiments it can be concluded that the cyclic ketone peroxide used is more efficient in the reduction of residual styrene trfean the commercial product Perkadox 58.<br><br><br>
