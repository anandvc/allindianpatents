				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compounds which inhibit the release of extracellular inflammatory cytokines said cytokines responsible for one or more human or higher mammalian disease states. The present invention further relates to compositions comprising said compounds and method for preventing, abating, or otherwise controlling enzymes which are understood to be the active components responsible for the herein described disease states.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and Tumor Necrosis Factor- a (TNF-a) are among the important biological substances known collectively as "cytokines". These molecules are understood to mediate the inflammatory response associated with the immunological recognition of infectious agents.<br>
These pro-inflammatory cytokines are suggested as an important mediators in many disease states or syndromes, inter alia, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBS), septic shock, cardiopulmonary dysfunction, acute respiratory disease, cachexia, and therefore responsible for the progression and manifestation of human disease states.<br>
US 3222366 dislcoses l,l-Malonyl-l,2, dihyrdo cinnoline derivatives suggesting these to be therapeutics which can be used as anti-inflamatory, analgesics and antipyretics.<br>
Kakutani M, et al report JTE-607, an N-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine-derived compound, a multiple-cytokine inhibitor which they found that strongly suppress production of proinflammatory cytokines. (Kakutani M, Takeuchi K, Waga I, Iwamura H, Wakitani K. Inflamm Res. 1999 ;48(8):461-8.)<br>
However these compounds suggested report toxicity and causing edema some times. Further, the pharmacological effect of the compounds was clinically not well validated. Hence, their was need of a compound which can block, abate, control, mitigate, or prevent the release of cytokines from cells which produce them and which has been tested for efficacy as well. Therefore, the inventors of the application developed a new compound to inhibit the release of cytokines form cells which produce them and validated it for efficacy.<br>

carbaldehyde. 1, adapted from the procedure of H. Bredereck et al., Chem. Ber., 97, pp 3407-<br>
3417 (1964) included herein by reference.<br>
To a 12 L 3-neck flask under inert atmosphere is charged N,N-dimethyl-formamide<br>
dimethyl acetyl (801 g) and pyruvic aldehyde dimethyl acetal (779 g). The mixture is heated to<br>
reflux for 18 hours during which time the temperature decreases from about 109 Â°C to about 80<br>
Â°C. The solution is cooled and methanol (4 L) is added to dissolve the crude residue. The<br>
solution is then cooled to 20 Â°C and thiourea (892 g, 11.7 mol) is added. After allowing the mixture<br>
to stir about 15 minutes, sodium methoxide (741 g, 13.7 mol) is added in 4 equal portions over 1<br>
hour while maintaining the solution temperature in the range of 18 - 28 Â°C. The mixture is stirred<br>
for 5 hours at room temperature, cooled to 20 Â°C, then methyl iodide (2 kg) is added over 1.25<br>
hours while maintaining the reaction temperature in the range of 17 - 29 Â°C. Stirring is continued<br>
for 18 hours at room temperature. The methanol and unreacted methyl iodide is removed by<br>
heating the solution at 35 Â°C @ 40 torr to produce about 4.46 kg of a dark residue which is<br>
partitioned between 14 L of water and 5 L of ethyl acetate. The water fraction is extracted a .<br>
second time with ethyl acetate, the organic layers combined and concentrated in vacuo too afford<br>
685 g of an oil which is purified over silica to 522 g of 4-dimethoxymethy!-2-methylsuIfanylpyrimidine.<br>
The dimethyl acetal obtained above is then hydrolyzed to the free aldehyde by heating to<br>
60 Â°C for 3 hours in 1 M HCI. Workup for neutral using ethyl acetate to extract the product affords<br>
347 g crude product which is purified over silica to afford 401 g of 2-methylsulfanyll-pyrimidine-4-<br>
carbaldehyde. 1.<br>

The analogs (compounds) of the present invention are arranged in several categories to<br>
assist the formulator in applying a rational synthetic strategy for the preparation of analogs which<br>
are not expressly exampled herein. The arrangement into categories does not imply increased or<br>
decreased efficacy for any of the compositions of matter described herein.<br>
Compounds listed and described herein above have been found in many instances to<br>
exhibit activities (ICso in the cell based assay described herein below or ones which are referenced<br>
herein) at a level below 1 micromolar (jiM).<br>
The compounds of the present invention are capable of effectively blocking the production<br>
of inflammatory cytokine production from cells, which thereby allows for the mitigation, alleviation,<br>
control, abatement, retardation, or prevention of one or more disease states or syndromes which<br>
are related to the extracellular release of one or more cytokines. Inflammatory disease states<br>
include those which are related to the following non-limiting examples:<br>
i) lnterleukin-1 (IL-1): implicated as the molecule responsible for a large number of<br>
disease states, inter alia, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, as well as other<br>
disease states which relate to connective tissue degradation,<br>
ii) Cydoxygenase-2 (COX-2): inhibitors of cytokine release are proposed as<br>
inhibitors of inducible COX-2 expression, which has been shown to be increased<br>
by cytokines. M. K. O'Banion et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 89, 4888 (1998),<br>
iii) Tumor Necrosis Factor-a (TNF-ct): This pro-inflammatory cytokine is suggested<br>
as an important mediator in many disease states or syndromes, inter alia,<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis. inflammatory bowel disease (IBS), septic<br>
shock, cardiopulmonary dysfunction, acute respiratory disease, and cachexia.<br><br>
Each of the disease states or conditions which the fomnulator desires to treat may require<br>
differing levels or amounts of the compounds described herein to obtain a therapeutic level. "Hie<br>
formulator can determine this amount by any of the known testing procedures known to the<br>
artisan.<br>
The present invention further relates to forms of the present compounds, which under<br>
normal human or higher mammalian physiological conditions, release the compounds described<br>
herein. One iteration of this aspect includes the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the analogs<br>
described herein. The formulator, for the purposes of compatibility with delivery mode, excipients,<br>
and the like, can select one salt form of the present analogs over another since the compounds<br>
themselves are the active species which mitigate the disease processes described herein.<br>
Related to this aspect are the various precursor of "pro-drug" forms of the analogs of the<br>
present invention. It may be desirable to formulate the compounds of the present invention as a<br>
chemical species which itself is not active against the cytokine activity described herein, but<br>
instead are forms of the present analogs which when delivered to the body of a human or higher<br>
mammal will undergo a chemical reaction catalyzed by the normal function of the body, inter alia,<br>
enzymes present in the stomach, blood serum, said chemical reaction releasing the parent<br>
analog. The term "pro-drug" relates to these species which are converted in vivo to the active<br>
pharmaceutical.<br>
FORMULATIONS<br>
The present invention also relates to compositions or formulations which comprise the<br>
inflammatory cytokine release-inhibiting compounds according to the present invention. In<br>
general, the compositions of the present invention comprise:<br>
a) an effective amount of one or more bicyclic pyrazolones and derivatives thereof<br>
according to the present invention which are effective for inhibiting release of<br>
inflammatory cytokines; and<br>
b) one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention the term "excipient" and "carrier" are used<br>
interchangeably throughout the description of the present invention and said terms are defined<br>
herein as, "ingredients which are used in the practice of formulating a safe and effective<br>
pharmaceutical composition."<br>
The formulator will understand that excipients are used primarily to serve in delivering a<br>
safe, stable, and functional pharmaceutical, serving not only as part of the overall vehicle for<br>
delivery but also as a means for achieving effective absorption by the recipient of the active<br>
ingredient. An excipient may fill a role as simple and direct as being an inert filler, or an excipient<br>
as used herein may be part of a pH stabilizina svstRm nr r.nating to insure delivery of the<br>
ingredients safely to the stomach. ,ke advantage of the fact the<br>
compounds of the present invention have improved cellular potency, pharmacokinetic properties,<br>
as well as improved oral btoavailability.<br>
The present Invention also relates to compositions or formulations which comprise a<br>
precursor or "pro-drug" form of the inflammatory cytokine release-inhibiting compounds according<br>
to the present invention. In general, these precursor-comprising compositions of the present<br>
invention comprise:<br>
a) an effective amount of one or more derivatives of bicydic pyrazolones according<br>
to the present invention which act to release in vivo the corresponding analog<br>
which is effective for inhibiting release of inflammatory cytokines; and<br>
b) one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
METHOD OF USE<br>
The present invention also relates to a method for controlling the level of one or more<br>
inflammation inducing cytokines, inter alia, interleukin-1 (IL-1), Tumor Necrosis Factor-a (TNF-a),<br>
interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) and thereby controlling, mediating, or abating disease<br>
states affected by the levels of extracellular inflammatory cytokines. The present method<br>
comprises the step of administering to a human or higher mammal an effective amount of a<br>
composition comprising one or more of the inflammatory cytokine inhibitors according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
Because the inflammatory cytokine inhibitors of the present invention can be delivered in a<br>
manner wherein more than one site of control can be achieved, more than one disease state can<br>
be modulated at the same time. Non-limiting examples of diseases which are affected by control<br>
or inhibition of inflammatory cytokine inhibitors, thereby modulating excessive cytokine activity,<br>
include osteoarthritis. rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV)<br>
infection.<br>
PROCEDURES<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be evaluated for efficacy, for example,<br>
measurements of cytokine inhibition constants, Kj, and ICso values can be obtained by any method<br>
chosen by the formulator.<br>
Non-limiting examples of suitable assays include:<br>
i) UV-visible substrate enzyme assay as described by L. Al Reiter, Int. J. Peptide<br>
Protein Res., 43, 87-96 (1994).<br>
ii) Fluorescent substrate enzyme assay as described by Thornberry et al., Nature,<br>

March 20, 2001.<br>
Each of the above citations is included herein by reference.<br>
In addition, Tumor Necrosis Factor, TNF-a, inhibition can be measured by utilizing<br>
lipopolysaccharide (IPS) stimulated human monocytic cells (THP-1) as described in:<br>
i) K. M. Mohler et al., "Protection Against a Lethal Dose of Endotoxin by an Inhibitor<br>
of Tumour Necrosis Factor Processing", Nature, 370, pp 218-220 (1994).<br>
ii) U.S. 6,297,381 B1 Cirillo et al., issued October 2,2001, incorporated by reference<br>
and reproduced herein below in relevant portion thereof.<br>
The inhibition of cytokine production can be observed by measuring inhibition of TNF-a in<br>
lipopolysaccharide stimulated THP cells. All cells and reagents are diluted in RPM11640 with<br>
phenol red and L-glutamine, supplemented with additional L-glutamine (total: 4 mM), penicillin and<br>
streptomycin (50 units/ml each) and fetal bovine serum (FBS 3%) (GIBCO, all cone. Final).<br>
Assay is performed under sterile conditions, only test compound preparation is non-sterile. Initial<br>
stock solutions are made in DMSO followed by dilution Into RPM11640 2-fold higher than the<br>
desired final assay concentration. Confluent THP.1 cells (2 x 106 cells/mL, final cone.; American<br>
Type Culture Company, Rockville, Md.) are added to 96 well polypropylene round bottomed<br>
culture plates (Costar 3790; sterile) containing 125 ^L test compound (2-fold concentrated) or<br>
DMSO vehicle (controls, blanks). DMSO concentration should not exceed 0.2% final. Cell<br>
mixture is allowed to preincubate for 30 minutes at 37 Â°C, 5% CO2 prior to stimulation with<br>
lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 fig/mL final; Sigma L-2630, from E. co//serotype 0111.B4; stored as 1<br>
mg/mL stock in endotoxin screened diluted H2O vehicle at -60 Â°C). Blanks (unstimulated) receive<br>
H2O vehicle; final incubation volume is 250 pL. Incubation (4 hours) proceeds as described<br>
above. Assay is to be terminated by centrifuging plates 5 minutes at room temperature, 1600 rpm<br>
(4033 g); supematants are then transferred to clean 96 well plates and stored at â€”80 Â°C until<br>
analyzed for human TNF-a by a commercially available ELISA kit (Biosource #KHC3015.<br>
Camarillo, Ca.). The calculated ICso value is the concentration of the test compound that caused a<br>
50% decrease in the maximal TNF-a production.<br>
