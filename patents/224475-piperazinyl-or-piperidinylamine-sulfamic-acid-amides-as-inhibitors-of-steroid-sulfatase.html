Steroidal hormones in particular tissues are associated with several diseases, such as tumors of breast, endometrium and prostate and disorders of the pilosebaceous unit, e.g. acne, androgenetic alopecia, and hirsutism. Important precursors for the local production of these steroid hormones are steroid 3-O-sulfates which are desulfated by the enzyme steroid sulfatase in the target tissues. Inhibition of this enzyme results in reduced local levels of the corresponding active steroidal hormones, which is expected to be of therapeutic relevance. Furthermore, steroid sulfatase inhibitors may be useful as immunosuppressive agents, and have been shown to enhance memory when delivered to the brain. Acne is a polyetiological disease caused by the interplay of numerous factors, such as inheritance, sebum, hormones, and bacteria. The most important causative factor in acne is sebum production; in almost all acne patients sebaceous glands are larger and more sebum is produced than in persons with healthy skin. The development of the sebaceous gland and the extent of sebum production is controlled hormonally by androgens; therefore, androgens play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of acne. In man, there are two major sources supplying androgens to target tissues: (i) the gonades which secrete testosterone, (ii) the adrenals producing dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) which is secreted as the sulfate conjugate (DHEAS). Testosterone and DHEAS are both converted to the most active androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), in the target tissue, e.g. in the skin. There is evidence that these pathways of local synthesis of DHT in the skin are more important than direct supply with active androgens from the circulation. Therefore, reduction of endogeneous levels of androgens in the target tissue by specific inhibitors should be of therapeutic benefit in acne and seborrhoea. Furthermore, it opens the perspective to treat these disorders through modulation of local androgen levels by topical treatment, rather than influencing circulating hormone levels by systemic therapies.<br>
Androgenetic male alopecia is very common in the white races, accounting for about 95% of all types of alopecia. Male-pattern baldness is caused by an increased number of hair follicles in the scalp entering the telogen phase and by the telogen phase lasting longer. It is a genetically determined hair loss effected through androgens. Elevated serum DHEA but normal testosterone levels have been reported in balding men compared with non-balding<br><br>
controls, implying that target tissue androgen production is important in androgenetic alopecia.<br>
Hirsutism is the pathological thickening and strengthening of the hair which is characterized by a masculine pattern of hair growth in children and women. Hirsutism is androgen induced, either by increased formation of androgens or by increased sensitivity of the hair follicle to androgens. Therefore, a therapy resulting in reduction of endogeneous levels of androgens and/or estrogens in the target tissue (skin) should be effective in acne, androgenetic alopecia and hirsutism.<br>
As described above, DHT, the most active androgen, is synthesized in the skin from the abundant systemic precursor DHEAS and the first step in the metabolic pathway from DHEAS to DHT is desulfatation of DHEAS by the enzyme steroid sulfatase to produce DHEA. The presence of the enzyme in keratinocytes and in skin-derived fibroblasts has been described. The potential use of steroid sulfatase inhibitors for the reduction of endogenous levels of steroid hormones in the skin was confirmed using known steroid sulfatase inhibitors, such as estrone 3-O-sulfamate and 4-methylumbeHiferyl-7-0-sulfamate. We have found that inhibitors of placental steroid sulfatase also inhibit steroid sulfatase prepared from either a human keratinocyte (HaCaT) or a human skin-derived fibroblast cell line (1BR3GN). Such inhibitors were also shown to block steroid sulfatase in intact monolayers of the HaCaT keratinocytes.<br>
Therefore, inhibitors of steroid sulfatase may be used to reduce androgen and estrogen levels in the skin. They can be used as inhibitors of the enzyme steroid sulfatase for the local treatment of androgen-dependent disorders of the pilosebaceous unit (such as acne, seborrhoea, androgenetic alopecia, hirsutism) and for the local treatment of squamous cell carcinoma.<br>
Furthermore non-steroidal steroid sulfatase inhibitors are expected to be useful for the treatment of disorders mediated by the action of steroid hormones in which the steroidal products of the sulfatase cleavage play a role. Indications for these new kind of inhibitors include androgen-dependent disorders of the pilosebaceous unit (such as acne, seborrhea, androgenetic alopecia, hirsutism); estrogen- or androgen-dependent tumors, such as squamous cell carcinoma and neoplasms, e.g. of the breast, endometrium, and prostate; inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, type I and II diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, myastenia gravis, thyroiditis, vasculitis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease, psoriasis, contact dermatitis, graft versus host disease, eczema, asthma and organ rejection following transplantation. Steroid sulfatase<br><br>
inhibitors are also useful for the treatment of cancer, especially for the treatment of estrogen- and androgen-dependent cancers, such as cancer of the breast and endometrium and squamous cell carcinoma, and cancer of the prostata. Steroid sulfatase inhibitors are also useful for the enhancement of cognitive function, especially in the treatment of senile dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, by increasing the DHEAS levels in the central nervous system.<br>
Activities of compounds in inhibiting the activity of steroid sulfatase may be shown in the following test systems:<br>
Purification of human steroid sulfatase<br>
Human placenta is obtained freshly after delivery and stripped of membranes and connective tissues. For storage, the material is frozen at -70°C. After thawing, all further steps are carried out at 4°C, while pH values are adjusted at 20°C. 400 g of the tissue is homogenized in 1.2 I of buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.4, 0.25 M sucrose). The homogenate obtained is centrifuged at 10,000xg for 45 minutes. The supernatant is set aside and the pellet obtained is re-homogenized in 500 ml of buffer A. After centrifugation, the two supernatants obtained are combined and subjected to ultracentrifugation (100,000xg, 1 hour). The pellet obtained is resuspended in buffer A and centrifugation is repeated. The pellet obtained is suspended in 50 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.4 and stored at -20°C until further work-up. After thawing, microsomes are collected by ultracentrifugation (as descrobed above) and are suspended in 50 ml of buffer B (10 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 % Triton X-100, 0.1 % aprotinin). After 1 hour on ice with gentle agitation, the suspension is centrifuged (100,000xg, 1 hour). The supernatant containing the enzyme activity is collected and the pH is adjusted to 8.0 with 1 M Tris. The solution obtained is applied to a hydroxy apatite column (2.6x20 cm) and equilibrated with buffer B, pH 8.0. The column is washed with buffer B at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The activity is recovered in the flow-through. The pool is adjusted to pH 7.4 and subjected to chromatography on a concanavalin A sepharose column (1.6x10 cm) equilibrated in buffer C (20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.4, 0.1 % Triton X-100, 0.5 M NaCI). The column is washed with buffer C, and the bound protein is eluted with 10 % methyl mannoside in buffer C. Active fractions are pooled and dialysed against buffer D (20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 8.0,1 mM EDTA, 0.1 % Triton X-100, 10% glycerol (v/v)).<br><br>
The retentate obtained is applied to a blue sepharose column (0.8x10 cm) equilibrated with buffer D; which column is washed and elution is carried out with a linear gradient of buffer D to 2 M NaCI in buffer D. Active fractions are pooled, concentrated as required (Centricon 10), dialysed against buffer D and stored in aliquots at -20°C.<br>
Assay of Human Steroid Sulfatase<br>
It is known that purified human steroid sulfatase not only is capable to cleave steroid sulfates, but also readily cleaves aryl sulfates such as 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate which is used in the present test system as an activity indicator. Assay mixtures are prepared by consecutively dispensing the following solutions into the wells of white microtiter plates:<br>
1)	50 ul substrate solution (1.5 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate in 0.1 M Tris-HCI, pH 7.5)<br>
2)	50 pi test compound dilution in 0.1 M Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 0.1 % Triton X-100 (stock solutions of the test compounds are prepared in DMSO; final concentrations of the solvent in the assay mixture not exceeding 1 %)<br>
3)	50 ul enzyme dilution (approximately 12 enzyme units/ml)<br>
We define one enzyme unit as the amount of steroid sulfatase that hydrolyses 1 nmol of 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate per hour at an initial substrate concentration of 500 uM in 0.1 M Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 0.1 % Triton X-100, at 37°C.<br>
Plates are incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Then the reaction is stopped by addition of 100 ul 0.2 M NaOH. Fluorescence intensity is determined in a Titertek Fluoroskan II instrument with Xex = 355 nm and Xem = 460 nm.<br>
Calculation of relative IC50 values<br>
From the fluorescence intensity data (I) obtained at different concentrations (c) of the test compound in the human steroid sulfatase assay as described above, the concentration inhibiting the enzymatic activity by 50 % (IC50) is calculated using the equation:<br><br>
wherein l100 is the intensity observed in the absence of inhibitor and s is a slope factor. Estrone sulfamate is used as a reference compound and its IC50 value is determined in parallel to all other test compounds. Relative IC50 values are defined as follows:<br><br><br>
According to our testing and calculation estrone sulfamate shows an IC50 value of i     approximately 60 nM.<br>
The compounds of the present invention show activity in that described assay (rel IC50 in the range of 0.0046 to 350).<br>
CHO/STS Assay<br>
CHO cells stably transfected with human steroid sulfatase (CHO/STS) are seeded into microtiter plates. After reaching approximately 90% confluency, they are incubated overnight with graded concentrations of test substances (e.g. compounds of the present invention). They are then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature and washed 4 times with PBS, before incubation with 100 |xl/well 0.5 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate (MUS), dissolved in 0.1M Tris-HCI, pH 7.5. The enzyme reaction is carried out at 37°Cfor 30 minutes. Then 50^1/well stop solution (1M Tris-HCI, pH 10.4) are added. The enzyme reaction solutions are transferred to white plates (Microfluor, Dynex, Chantilly, VA) and read in a Fluoroskan II fluorescence microtiter plate reader. Reagent blanks are subtracted from all values. For drug testing, the fluorescence units (FU) are divided by the optical density readings after staining cellular protein with sulforhodamine B (OD550), in order to correct for variations in cell number. IC50 values are determined by linear interpolation between two bracketing points. In each assay with inhibitors, estrone 3-O-sulfamate is run as a reference compound, and the IC50 values are normalized to estrone 3-O-sulfamate (relative IC50 = IC50 compound / IC50 estrone 3-O-sulfamate).<br>
The compounds of the present invention show activity in that described assay (rel IC50 in the range of 0.05 to 226).<br>
Assay Using Human Skin Homogenate<br>
Frozen specimens of human cadaver skin (about 100 mg per sample) are minced into small pieces (about 1x1 mm) using sharp scissors. The pieces obtained are suspended in ten volumes (w/w) of buffer (20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5), containing 0.1 % Triton X-100. Test compounds (e.g. compounds of the present invention) are added at graded concentrations from stock solutions in ethanol or DMSO. Second, DHEAS as the substrate is added (1 uC/ml [3H]DHEAS, specific activity: about 60 Ci/mmol, and 20 uM unlabeled DHEAS).<br><br>
Samples are incubated for 18 hrs at 37°C. At the end of the incubation period, 50 pi of 1 M Tris, pH 10.4 and 3 ml of toluene are added.
