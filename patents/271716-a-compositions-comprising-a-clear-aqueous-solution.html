METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR REDUCING NEURODEGENERATION IN<br>
AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present disclosure is related to compositions<br>
and methods for ameliorating or treating at least one<br>
symptom of a neurodegenerative process or disease.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
At any given time, as many as 30,000 Americans<br>
suffer with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), which is<br>
nearly always fatal. ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's<br>
Disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that<br>
attacks motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord and<br>
results in muscle weakness and atrophy. Early symptoms<br>
include loss of dexterity and gait. As the disease<br>
progresses, patients become paralyzed and require<br>
respiratory support. The life expectancy of ALS patients<br>
is usually 3 to 5 years after diagnosis with the leading<br>
cause of death being loss of respiratory function.<br>
ALS etiology is only partially understood. Familial<br>
(inherited) cases make up only about 5-10% of ALS<br>
patients overall. Within this subset of ALS patients,<br>
one in five carry the only genetic defect identified to<br>
date, a mutation in the SOD1 gene. The mutant allele<br>
leads to production of a protein believed to be toxic to<br>
motor neurons. Most cases, i.e., the remaining 90-95%,<br>
arise seemingly spontaneously and without an identifiable<br>
pattern. Thus, ALS appears to be capable of striking<br>
anyone at any time. Effective therapies are scarce or<br>
non-existent.<br><br>

SUMMARY<br>
Accordingly, a need has arisen for methods and<br>
compositions useful for ameliorating or eliminating-<br>
progression of a neurodegenerative process or disease<br>
including, without limitation, ALS.<br>
The present disclosure relates to compositions and<br>
methods for ameliorating or treating at least one symptom<br>
of a neurodegenerative process or disease. For example,<br>
in some embodiments, the disclosure provides compositions<br>
and methods for ameliorating or eliminating progression<br>
of a neurodegenerative process or disease. In some<br>
embodiments of the disclosure, a clear stable solution of<br>
a bile acid may be administered to a subject having a<br>
progressive neurodegenerative disorder. According to<br>
some embodiments, a bile acid solution may further<br>
comprise another pharmaceutical (e.g., riluzole). In<br>
some embodiments, a bile acid solution of the disclosure<br>
may be administered to a subject having amyotrophic<br>
lateral sclerosis. According to some embodiments,<br>
coadministration of a bile acid with riluzole may result<br>
in a surprisingly-improved outcome over administration of<br>
either pharmaceutical alone. In some embodiments,<br>
coadministration of a bile composition of the disclosure<br>
with riluzole may reduce riluzole toxicity or side<br>
effects in some embodiments.<br>
Compositions of the present disclosure may include<br>
(1) a bile acid, a bile acid derivative, a bile acid<br>
salt, or a bile acid conjugate with an amine, (2) water,<br>
and (3)  a sufficient quantity of an aqueous soluble<br>
starch conversion product such that the bile acid and the<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PCT7US2005/039089<br>
4<br>
starch conversion product remain in solution at any pH<br>
within a selected pH range.<br>
The disclosure also relates to a composition which<br>
comprises (1) a bile acid, a bile acid derivative, a bile<br>
acid salt, or a bile acid conjugate with an amine, (2)<br>
water, and (3) a sufficient quantity of an aqueous<br>
soluble non-starch polysaccharide such that the bile acid<br>
and the polysaccharide remain in solution at any pH<br>
within a selected pH range.<br>
The disclosure further relates to a pharmaceutical<br>
composition which comprises (1) a bile acid, a bile acid<br>
derivative, a bile acid salt, or a bile acid conjugate<br>
with an' amine, (2) water, (3) a pharmaceutical compound<br>
in a pharmaceutically appropriate amount, and (4) a<br>
sufficient quantity of an aqueous soluble starch<br>
conversion product or an aqueous soluble non-starch<br>
polysaccharide such that the bile acid, the<br>
pharmaceutical compound, and the carbohydrate remain in<br>
solution at any pH level within a selected pH range.<br>
According to some non-limiting embodiments, the<br>
pharmaceutical compound may be any drug that has-<br>
beneficial effect when administered to a subject having, a<br>
neurodegenerative disease. According to one non-limiting<br>
embodiment of the disclosure, the pharmaceutical compound<br>
may be riluzole or pharmaceutically active or activatable<br>
metabolites, pro-drugs, derivatives or analogs of<br>
riluzole.<br>
The disclosure further relates to solution dosage<br>
forms of bile acid compositions. Advantages of these<br>
solution dosage forms include improved bioavailability<br>
and absorbability of a bile acid.  Additional advantages<br><br>
WO2006/050165	PCT/US2005/039089<br>
5<br>
of  solution dosage  forms  include  improved bioavailability and<br>
absorbability of a pharmaceutical compound.<br>
In some embodiments of the disclosure, a composition is<br>
provided which comprises (1) a bile acid, a bile acid derivative, a<br>
bile acid salt, or a bile acid conjugate with an amine, (2) water,<br>
and (3) a sufficient quantity of carbohydrate such that the bile<br>
acid component and the carbohydrate remain in solution at any pH<br>
within a selected pH range, wherein the carbohydrate is a<br>
combination of an aqueous soluble starch conversion product and an<br>
aqueous soluble nonO-starch polysaccharide. In embodiments<br>
containing both soluble non-starch polysaccharide and high molecular<br>
eight starch conversion product, the amounts of each are such that<br>
when combined together in the composition they are sufficient to<br>
allow the bile acid component, the high molecular weight starch<br>
conversion product, the soluble non-starch polysaccharide and the<br>
pharmaceutical compound, if any, to remain in solution at any pH<br>
within a selected pH range.<br>
In some embodiments of the disclosure, a combination therapy<br>
composition is provided which may increase the intensity of response<br>
to or efficacy of a pharmaceutical. More specifically,<br>
administration of a composition of the disclosure comprising a bile<br>
acid and riluzole to a subject suffering from a neurodegenerative<br>
disorder may have more than an additive effect of administration of<br>
either compound alone.<br>
In some embodiments of the invention the pharmaceutical<br>
composition which comprises (1) a bile acid, a bile acid derivative,<br>
a bile acid salt or a bile acid conjugate with an amine, (2) water,<br>
(3) a pharmaceutical compound in a pharmaceutically appropriate<br>
amount, preferably riluzole, and (4) a sufficient quantity of an<br>
aqueous soluble starch conversion product or an aqueous soluble non-<br>
starch polysaccharide, is found to show surprising therapeutic<br>
efficacy.  The pharmaceutical composition is therefore synergistic.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
About 85-90% of adult-onset ALS patients have no<br>
family history of the disease. This apparently random or<br>
haphazard occurrence has lead some practitioners to<br>
identify these cases as sporadic ALS (SALS). By<br>
contrast, ALS may be inherited as an autosomal dominant<br>
condition in about 10-15% of patients. These cases have<br>
been identified as familial ALS (FALS) . In about a fifth<br>
of FALS cases, the mutant gene is a cytoplasmic enzyme,<br>
Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD) . More than 90<br>
mutations in Cu/Zn SOD have been identified and are<br>
spread across over 30 sites. These mutations may give<br>
rise to a new adverse function that leads to FALS as<br>
opposed to simply impairing a normal function of the gene<br>
product. For example, in experiments with transgenic<br>
mice that overexpress a mutant human Cu/Zn SOD (A4V,<br>
G93A, G85R, G37R), there was no correlation between loss<br>
of SOD1 activity and the onset or severity of disease.<br>
The symptoms and pathology of FALS patients with<br>
SOD1 mutations closely resemble those of patients with<br>
SALS. The clinical progression and pathologic<br>
alterations in -motor neurons from mice expressing mutant<br>
SOD1 are also strikingly similar to those found in SALS<br>
patients, suggesting that the mechanisms of<br>
neurodegeneration for SALS and FALS may share common<br>
components. Mitochondria play a pivotal role in many<br>
metabolic and apoptotic pathways that regulate the life<br>
and death of cells.  Mitochondria also are the site of<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PCT/US2005/039089<br>
8<br>
initiation of the intrinsic apoptotic cascade, which can<br>
be activated by the release of pro-apoptotic factors that<br>
may act both in a caspase-dependent or caspase-<br>
independent manner. Mitochondrial dysfunction may be<br>
 directly involved in the pathogenesis of ALS.<br>
Mitochondrial dysfunction causes motor neuron death by<br>
predisposing them to calcium-mediated excitotoxicity, by<br>
increasing generation of reactive oxygen species, and/or<br>
by initiating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.<br>
 Mitochondrial dysfunction may result in quantal<br>
releases of pro-apoptotic factors, such as cytochrome c,<br>
apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), and endoG, from<br>
individual mitochondria, perhaps in response to local<br>
calcium mediated toxicity, for example, under excitatory<br>
 synapses. This local toxicity might induce death of<br>
subcellular compartments, e.g., dendritic or axonal<br>
branches. This kind of subcellular compartmental<br>
degeneration might be insufficient to induce the cell to<br>
die immediately, but could spread to the cell bodies over<br>
 a period of time. Consistent with this scenario, in ALS,<br>
axons degenerate from the distal to the proximal<br>
direction (dying back) and dendrites become atrophic<br>
before the final motor neuron death. This mechanism of<br>
cell  death may be unique  for neuronal  degeneration<br>
 because neurons have complex subcellular branches, and it<br>
may progress relatively slowly compared with typical cell<br>
death mechanisms in other cell types. As a consequence,<br>
it may be that at any given time in the course of the<br>
disease, only a small number of cells are actually dying<br>
  of apoptosis.<br>
The motor neuron degeneration by SOD1 mutation may<br>
be investigated in cell culture and in transgenic mice<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PCT/US2005/039089<br>
9<br>
models. In in vitro analyses, the spread and progressive<br>
motor neuronal death may be observed in missense<br>
mutations such as G93A (glycine to alanine at position<br>
93) and A4V (alanine to valine at position 4) in the<br>
human Cu/Zn-super oxide dismutase gene (hSODl) . For<br>
example, viability of cells with wild-type, G93A, and A4V •<br>
hSODl 24 h after the neuronal differentiation was<br>
evaluated by using both the MTT assay and Trypan blue<br>
staining. Viability was significantly reduced over time.<br>
In the wild-type cells, the viability significantly<br>
decreased at 48 h after the neuronal differentiation <br>
(85.91 + 9.08%) (P 
h (P 
(63.71 ± 6.25%) and A4V cells (58.85 ± 7.83%) compared<br>
with wild cells (100 ± 6.97%) at 24 h after the neuronal<br>
differentiation. At 48 h, viability was further reduced<br>
to 23.12 ± 8.96% in G93A cells and 20.79 ± 8.07% in A4V<br>
cells (P 
nearly all dead with viabilities at about 0%. These <br>
results suggest that G93A or A4V mutations in hSODl make<br>
motor neurons more vulnerable. In view of the these<br>
results, analyses performed acco-rding to the instant<br>
disclosure may, in some embodiments, be performed at<br>
about 24 h to avoid the substantially lower viability<br>
that may occur at later time points.<br>
The transgenic mice expressing G93A or A4V develop a<br>
severe motor neuron degenerative syndrome despite normal<br>
or above normal SOD activities. By contrast, these<br>
symptoms may not occur in mice in which Cu/Zn SOD is<br>
knocked out or overexpressed.<br>
Nitric oxide (NO) may play a role in physiological<br>
and pathological processes in the central nervous system<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PCT/US2005/039089<br>
10<br>
and mitochondria may be the primary targets for NO<br>
toxicity in the brain. NO may interact with a superoxide<br>
anion to form reactive peroxynitrites, which may cause<br>
cell death by oxidative damage, disruption of energy<br>
metabolism, calcium homeostasis, and mitochondrial<br>
function. This toxicity may be prevented by an NOS<br>
inhibitor and a nitric oxide scavenger, i.e.,<br>
peroxynitrite and hydroxyl radical scavenger.<br>
S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) may be a useful NO donor<br>
that may slowly and spontaneously re-lease NO under<br>
physiological conditions. GSNO may be a storage and/or<br>
transport vehicle for NO in the body. A metabolic enzyme<br>
for GSNO may be conserved from bacteria to humans. <br>
Endogenous GSNO, which may be generated in endothelial<br>
cells and astroglial cells during oxidative stress, may<br>
be located in the cerebellum in. rats. Thus, GSNO may be<br>
an endogenous NO reservoir and may play one or more roles<br>
in the brain. Interestingly, remarkable apoptosis may be<br>
observed when cells are treated with GSNO.<br>
Some of the FALS mutant Gu'ZnSOD enzymes may induce a<br>
significantly increased peroxidative activity in<br>
comparison to the wild type protein in vitro.<br>
Peroxynitrite, a product of superoxide (O2 ) and nitric<br>
oxide (NO) , reacts with the Cu2+ of mutant SODs, producing<br>
nitronium ions, which lead to nitration of proteins and<br>
subsequent neurotoxicity; motor neurons of ALS patients<br>
exhibit increased immunoreactivity for nitrotyrosine. The<br>
enhanced peroxidase activity may increase production of<br>
hydroxyl radicals, which could damage neurons.<br>
In some embodiments, a bile acid composition of the<br>
disclosure may lack one or more of the disadvantageous<br>
features of existing commercial dosage forms of UDCA.  In<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PCT/US2005/039089<br>
11<br>
addition, a bile acid composition of the disclosure may,<br>
in some embodiments, ameliorate and/or treat at least one<br>
symptom of ALS and/or advanced ALS. Bile acid dosage<br>
forms, according to some embodiments of the disclosure,<br>
may be suitable or adaptable for oral and parenteral<br>
administration. In some embodiments, a bile acid<br>
composition of the disclosure may include an intact<br>
molecule of UDCA and an aqueous soluble starch conversion<br>
product (e.g., a product resulting from hydrolysis of<br>
starch) . A bile acid composition, according to some<br>
embodiments of the disclosure, may be solubilized in<br>
water and may remain in aqueous solution without<br>
precipitation at any pH.<br>
In some embodiments, the solubility of UDCA in a<br>
solution of the disclosure may be about 3,000 times<br>
higher than that of commercialized UDCA (0.15mol vs.<br>
0.05mmol) and may be 300 times higher than that of TUDCA.<br>
A solution of the disclosure may, in some embodiments,<br>
deliver solubilized UDCA to blood, brain, stomach,<br>
duodenum, jejunum, ileum and/or colon. In some<br>
embodiments, an oral and parenteral dosage form may<br>
contain, for example, 500mg of UDCA and may have a Cmax<br>
that is at least 8 times higher than an existing<br>
commercial UDCA form and Tmax that is about 4-6 times<br>
shorter than an existing commercial UDCA form.<br>
Moreover, according to some embodiments, a bile<br>
composition of the disclosure may not contain any<br>
precipitation at any pH and may function as a systemic<br>
drug. A solution, according to some embodiments, may be<br>
administered concurrently with one or more pharmaceutical<br>
compounds (e.g., a pharmaceutical compound that is<br>
therapeutically active against ALS).  Administration of a<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PCT/US2005/039089<br>
12<br>
bile composition of the disclosure with another<br>
pharmaceutical compound may, in some embodiments, (a)<br>
increase the intensity of a response to the<br>
pharmaceutical compound, (b) increase the efficacy of the<br>
pharmaceutical compound, (c) decrease the required dose<br>
of the pharmaceutical compound, and/or (d&gt; decrease the<br>
toxicity of the pharmaceutical compound. Solutions of<br>
the disclosure may also be administered separately, in<br>
terms of both the route and time of administration.<br>
A solution of the disclosure may be used, in some<br>
embodiments, to treat or ameliorate ALS disease and/or<br>
advanced ALS disease.   For example, a solution of the<br>

Hydrophobic bile salts fed to rats may induce<br>
apoptosis in the liver. In addition, coadministration of<br>
ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) may inhibit hepatocyte<br>
apoptosis in vivo. Both in hepatocytes and in nonhepatic<br>
cells apoptosis may be induced with various factors such<br>
as hydrophobic acids, ethanal, transforming growth<br>
factor-a, an agonistic Fas antibody, or okadaic acid.<br>
Surprisingly, UDCA may attenuate apoptosis and display<br>
cytoprotection by modulating mitochondrial membrane<br>
perturbation, Bax translocation and/or cytochrome c<br>
release.<br><br>

Ursodeoxycholic acid (3D-7D-dihydroxy-5D-cholanic<br>
acid; UDCA) is a non-toxic hydrophilic bile acid and<br>
normally present in human bile, albeit in a low<br>
concentration of only about 3% of total bile acids. UDCA<br>
may be used for the treatment of various cholestatic<br>
disorders for which it is the only drug approved by the<br>
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).<br>
A major component of bear bile, UDCA may be useful<br>
as a pharmaceutical agent for the treatment of and the<br>
protection against many types of liver disease. Its<br>
medicinal uses at the present day include the dissolution<br>
of radiolucent - gall stones and various cholestatic<br>
disorders which are primary biliary cirrhosis, primary<br>
sclerosing. cholangitis, intrahepatic cholestasis of<br>
pregnancy, cystic fibrosis-associated liver disease, a <br>
number of, pediatric liver disorders, and chronic graft-<br>
versus-host disease of the liver.<br>
Pharmacological action of UDCA may include<br>
replacement and/or displacement of toxic bile acids<br>
through UDCA in a dose-dependent manner, cytoprotective<br>
effects in a dose-dependent manner,<br>
stabilization/protection of cell membranes in a dose-<br>
dependent manner, antiapoptotic effects in a dose-<br>
dependent manner, immunomodulatory effects due to<br>
activation of the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor<br>
in a dose-dependent manner, antiinflammatory effects due<br>
to repression of NF-kB and inhibition of the induction of<br>
nitric oxide synthase, stimulation of bile secretion in a<br>
dose-dependent manner, Stimulation of exocytosis and<br>
insertion of canalicular membrane transporters in a dose-<br>
dependent manner.<br><br>
WO 2006/050165		PCT/US2005/039089<br>

UDCA is practically insoluble at pH 1 to 8. The<br>
solubility of its protonated form is about 0.05inM. The<br>
solubility of its taurine conjugated metabolite (TUDCA;<br>
0.45mM) is about ten times higher than UDCA solubility.<br>
Moreover, TUDCA is the only bile acid (BA) with<br>
relatively low solubility when protonated. Following<br>
oral administration, approximately 30 to 60% of UDCA is<br>
absorbed along the length of the jejunum and ileum by<br>
nonionic passive diffusion and is absorbed in the ileum<br>
by active transport mechanisms and to a small extent (20%<br>
of an ingested dose) in the colon due to the insolubility<br>
of crys-tal UDCA, which causes extremely slow and<br>
incomplete dissolution due to the low aqueous solubility<br>
of its non-ionized molecules and more lipophilicity than<br>
the ionized bile salt species, and can therefore<br>
partition into biological membranes.<br>
Once taken up by hepatocytes, UDCA may be conjugated<br>
to TUDCA and GUDCA, the latter two being the secreted<br>
bile acids in humans and excreted in bile by hepatic<br>
first-pass clearance. Consequently, its blood levels are<br>
extremely low in the systemic circulation. Bile acids<br>
undergo extensive hepatic recycling, or free UDCA may<br>
also be secreted by hepatocytes in bile, where it may be<br>
actively and efficiently reabsorbed by cholangiocytes.<br>
UDCA and GUDCA are absorbed by both active and passive<br>
transport mechanisms, while tauro-conjugated UDCA (TUDCA)<br>
may be transported actively in the terminal ileum.<br>
In some embodiments, a UDCA dose above 10+12 mg/kg<br>
per day may not further increase its proportion in bile<br>
since a large quantities of UDCA may be biotransformed to<br>
CDCA through 7-keto-lithocholic acid by intestinal<br>
bacteria.  Alternatively, UDCA may be converted to CDCA<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PCT/US2005/039089<br>
17<br>
by epimerization of the 7£-hydroxyl group and further to<br>
lithocholic acid (LCA). Therefore, with increasing doses<br>
of UDCA the absorption of UDCA decreases.<br>
In some embodiments, administration of a composition<br>
of the disclosure may achieve adequate amounts of UDCA in<br>
the liver, in the systemic circulation, and/or in brain<br>
to have a therapeutic effect. A solution of the<br>
disclosure may, in some embodiments, display<br>
significantly increased aqueous solubility of UDCA,-<br>
increased membrane permeability, protection from<br>
epimerization of UDCA to CDCA.<br>
Survival time and quality of life for ALS patients<br>
may be  improved by respiratory  therapy given while<br>
sleeping  during  early  stages  of  the  disease  and<br>
alternative feeding methods that maintain good nutrition<br>
as the disease progresses and swallowing becomes more<br>
difficult.  To date, only one drug, riluzole, has been<br>
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for<br>
treatment of ALS.   However,  the lifespan of patients<br>
receiving riluzole is only extended by a few months.<br>
Research related to stem cells and gene therapy are.<br>
promising  frontiers,  but  have  not  yet  enhanced the-<br>
options available to treating physicians.<br>
Without being limited to any particular mechanism of<br>
action, the present disclosure provides clear, stable<br>
solutions of soluble bile acids that may ameliorate a<br>
neurodegenerative process. In some embodiments of the<br>
disclosure, the compositions comprise riluzole.<br>
Riluzole, the only drug for treating ALS to yet receive<br>
FDA approval may function by reducing the amount of<br>
glutamate released during signal transduction. Riluzole<br>
efficacy has been demonstrated primarily in two principal<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PCT/US2005/039089<br>
18<br>
controlled clinical trials. The drug's most frequent<br>
adverse events were nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea,<br>
asthenia, somnolence, vertigo, circumoral paresthesia,<br>
abdominal pain and dizziness. Of these, vertigo,<br>
diarrhea, nausea, circumoral paresthesia and anorexia<br>
appear more frequently in patients that received higher<br>
doses. Increased serum transaminase levels have<br>
generally been observed within three months of starting<br>
riluzole treatment. however, these levels recede after<br>
two to six months of treatment. Monitoring serum<br>
transaminase levels is suggested during the first year of<br>
riluzole treatment.<br>
Bile acids may act as intracellular signaling<br>
agents, which modulate cellular transport, alter<br>
intracellular Ca2+ levels, and activate cell surface<br>
receptors. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is a hydrophilic<br>
bile acid with proven clinical efficacy in the treatment<br>
of hepatobiliary disorders. UDCA may be rapidly<br>
conjugated with glycine or taurine in vivo to produce<br>
glycoursodeoxycolic and tauroursodeoxycholic (TUDCA) <br>
acids, respectively. UDCA and its derivatives and <br>
conjugates may function as cytoprotective agents by<br>
inhibiting apoptosis.<br>
Since glutamate neurotoxicity may result in cell<br>
death through apoptosis, blocking apoptosis may slow<br>
acute and chronic neurodegenerative processes. In some<br>
embodiments of the disclosure, a bile composition blocks<br>
a toxic effect mediated by p53. In some embodiments of<br>
the disclosure, a bile composition blocks a toxic effects<br>
mediated by an oxidative process.<br>
The present disclosure relates to an aqueous<br>
solution comprising (i) one or more soluble bile acids,<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PCT/US2005/039089<br>
19<br>
aqueous soluble bile acid derivatives, bile acid salts,<br>
or bile acid conjugated with an amine, (collectively<br>
"bile acid") , (ii) water, and (iii) one or more aqueous<br>
soluble starch conversion products or aqueous soluble<br>
non-starch polysaccharides in an amount sufficient to<br>
produce a solution which does not form a precipitate at<br>
any pH within a desired pH range. The composition may<br>
contain a bile acid or a bile acid salt which itself has<br>
pharmaceutical effectiveness. Formulations of the<br>
disclosure may act as a carrier, an adjuvant or enhancer<br>
for the delivery of a pharmaceutical material which<br>
remains dissolved in the composition of the disclosure<br>
across the desired pH range. Alternatively, according to<br>
some embodiments of the disclosure, the composition may<br>
comprise a non-bile acid pharmaceutical that is<br>
incompletely soluble.<br>
In some embodiments, it may be an advantage of this<br>
disclosure that the bile acid and the carbohydrate remain<br>
in solution without precipitation at any pH from acidic<br>
to alkaline. These aqueous solution systems of bile acid<br>
are substantially free of precipitate or particles. A<br>
further advantage of this disclosure is that the aqueous<br>
solution systems demonstrate no changes in physical<br>
appearance such as changes in clarity, color or odor<br>
following the addition of strong acids or alkali even<br>
after several months observation under accelerated<br>
conditions of storage at 50°C.<br>
In some embodiments of the disclosure, an aqueous<br>
solution system of a bile acid is administered orally<br>
whereupon it reaches the intestine through the<br>
gastrointestinal track without precipitation of bile<br>
acids by exposure to acidic gastric juices and alkaline<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PCT/US2005/039089<br>
20<br>
juices of the intestine.   These dissolved bile acid<br>
formulations demonstrate intact solution systems in the<br>
intestine can be effectively and completely absorbed and,<br>
consequently, undergo enterohepatic cycling.  According<br>
to an embodiment of the disclosure, bile acid solubility<br>
(e.g. precipitation and changes in physical appearance)<br>
is affected by whether a carboxylic acid side chain of<br>
certain bile acids can be protonated (non-ionized), is<br>
ionized, or is a simple carboxylic acid.<br>
The ionization state of a bile acid- carboxylic acid<br>
side chain may greatly  affect the hydrophobicity and the<br>
hydrophillicity of the bile acid in some aqueous solution<br>
systems. In some embodiments of the disclosure, that<br>
ionization state is manipulated by adjusting the pH to<br>
control the toxicity, absorption, and amphiphilicity of<br>
bile acids. One or more bile acids may be dissolved in<br>
these aqueous solution ' systems as a therapeutically<br>
active agent, as an adjuvant of a drug, as a carrier of a<br>
drug or as an enhancer of drug solubility. These aqueous<br>
solution systems may be prepared for oral consumption, •<br>
enemas, mouthwashes, gargles, nasal preparations, otic<br>
preparations, injections, douches, topical skin<br>
preparations, other topical preparations, and cosmetic<br>
preparations which have a desired pH without the<br>
disadvantage of precipitation or deterioration in<br>
physical appearance after long periods of time.<br>
Soluble bile acids are any type of aqueous soluble<br>
bile acids. A bile acid salt is any aqueous soluble salt<br>
of a bile acid. Bile salts exhibit greater solubilizing<br>
capacity for phospholipid and cholesterol and are<br>
consequently better detergents. More hydrophobic bile<br>
salts may be more injurious to various membranes, both in<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PC17US2005/039089<br>
21<br>
vivo and in vitro.  Aqueous dissolved salts of bile acids<br>
may be formed by the reaction of bile acids described<br>
above and an amine including but not limited to aliphatic<br>
free amines  such as  trientine,  diethylene triamine,<br>
tetraethylene pentamine, and basic amino acids such as<br>
arginine,  lysine,  ornithine,  and ammonia,  and amino<br>
sugars  such  as  D-glucamine,  N-alkylglucamines,  and<br>
quaternary  ammonium  derivatives  such  as  choline,<br>
heterocyclic    amines    such   as   piperazine,    N-<br>
alkylpiperazine,      piperidine,      N-alkylpiperidine,<br>
morpholine,        N-alkylmorphline,        pyrrolidine,<br>
triethanolamine, and trimethanolamine.  According to the<br>
disclosure, aqueous soluble metal salts of bile acids,<br>
inclusion compound between the bile acid and cyclodextrin<br>
and its derivatives,  and aqueous soluble O-sulfonated<br>
bile acids are also included as soluble bile acid salts.<br>
Soluble bile acid derivatives according to some<br>
embodiments of this disclosure, may be those derivatives<br>
which are as soluble in aqueous solution as or more<br>
soluble in aqueous solution than is the corresponding<br>
underivatized bile acid. Bile acid derivatives include,<br>
but are not limited to derivatives formed at the hydroxyl<br>
and carboxylic acid groups of the bile acid with other<br>
functional groups including but not limited to halogens<br>
and amino groups. Soluble bile acid may include an<br>
aqueous preparation of a free acid form of bile acid-<br>
combined with one of HCl, phosphoric acid, citric acid,<br>
acetic acid, ammonia, or arginine.<br>
Bile acids that may be used in accordance with the<br>
teachings of this disclosure include, without limitation,<br>
ursodeoxycholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, cholic acid,<br>
hyodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid,  7-oxolithocholic<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PCT/US2005/039089<br>
22<br>
acid, lithocholic acid, iododeoxycholic acid, iocholic<br>
acid, tauroursodeoxycholic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic<br>
acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, taurolithocholic acid,<br>
glycoursodeoxycholic acid, taurocholic acid, glycocholic<br>
acid, and their derivatives at a hydroxyl or carboxylic<br>
acid group on the steroid nucleus.<br>
In some embodiments of the disclosure, one advantage<br>
may be that delivery of bile acid in solution achieves<br>
higher in vivo levels of bile acids than existing<br>
commercial preparations. Therefore, the therapeutic<br>
potential of bile acid may be more fully achieved than<br>
previous formulations.  The in vivo levels of bile acids<br>
attainable with existing formulations, in which bile is<br>
incompletely solubilized are lower and require<br>
administration of larger amounts of bile acids. Since<br>
bile acid is completely dissolved in the inventive<br>
formulations, higher in vivo levels of bile acid may be<br>
achieved, even though lower doses are administered.<br>
In some embodiments of the disclosure, a plurality<br>
of bile . acids may be used in a single formulation.<br>
Mixtures of two or more bile salts of differing<br>
hydrophobic activity may behave as a single bile salt of<br>
an intermediate hydrophobic activity. As a result,<br>
detergent properties and the toxicity of mixtures o-f two<br>
bile acids of differing hydrophobic activity often are<br>
intermediate between the individual components.<br>

syrup solid, and MALTRIN® M700, a maltodextrin, may be<br>
used and both of which are manufactured by GPC®, Grain<br>
Processing Corporation of Muscatine, Iowa may be used.<br>
For the purpose of this embodiment, the term "corn syrup"<br>
includes both corn syrup and liquid glucose. If a starch<br>
conversion product is polymeric, the polymer has at least<br>
one reducing end and at least one non-reducing end and<br>
may be linear or branched. The molecular weight may be<br>
from about 100 mass units to over 106 mass units. High<br>
molecular' weight aqueous soluble starch conversion<br>
products are those having a molecular weight over 105.<br>
According to some embodiments of the present<br>
disclosure, aqueous soluble non-starch polysaccharides<br>
may be under various pH conditions by various hydrolytic<br>
or synthetic mechanisms. Non-limiting examples include<br>
to dextran, guar gum, pectin, indigestible soluble fiber.<br>
If polymeric, the polymer has at least one reducing end<br>
and at least one non-reducing end. The polymer may be<br>
linear or branched. The molecular weight is from about<br>
100 mass units to over 106 mass units. Preferably the<br>
molecular weight is over 105 mass units.<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PCT/US2005/039089<br>
24<br>
The amount of high molecular weight aqueous soluble<br>
starch  conversion  product  and/or  soluble  non-starch<br>
polysaccharide used in embodiments of the disclosure is<br>
at least the amount needed to render the chosen bile<br>
acid(s) in the preparation soluble in the concentration<br>
desired and in the pH range desired.  In some embodiments<br>
of the disclosure, the approximate minimal weight ratio<br>
of  maltodextrin  to  UDCA  required  to  prevent  UDCA<br>
precipitation is 6:1 (i.e. 1.2 g for every 0.2 g of UDCA,<br>
6 g for every Ig of UDCA, and 12 g for every 2 g of UDCA<br>
in 100 mL of water) .    In some embodiments of the<br>
disclosure,   the   approximate  minimal   quantity  of<br>
maltodextrin is 30 g for every 200 mg of chenodeoxycholic<br>
acid, 12 g for every 200 mg of 7-ketolithocholic acid, 10<br>
g for every 200 mg of cholic acid and 50 g for every 200<br>
mg of deoxycholic acid.   In some embodiments of the<br>
disclosure,  the approximate minimal  weight ratio of<br>
liquid glucose  (commercial light corn syrup)  to UDCA<br>
required to prevent the precipitation of bile acids from<br>
the aqueous solution dosage forms of the disclosure is<br>
about 25:1 (i.e. 12.5 g for every 500 mg UDCA in 100 mL<br>
water and 25 g for every 1 g ursodeoxycholic acid in 200<br>
mL water) .   In some embodiments of the disclosure, the<br>
approximate minimal quantity of dried powder of liquid<br>
glucose (corn syrup solid, e.g. MALTRIN® M200) required<br>
to prevent the precipitation of bile acids from the<br>
aqueous solution dosage forms of the disclosure is 3 0 g<br>
for every 1 g ursodeoxycholic acid in 100 mL water, and<br>
approximately 60 g for every 2 g of ursodeoxycholic acid<br>
in 200 mL water.  In some embodiments of the disclosure,<br>
the approximate minimal quantity of soluble non-starch<br>
polysaccharide required to prevent the precipitation of<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PCT/US2005/039089<br>
25<br>
bile acids from the aqueous solution dosage forms of the<br>
disclosure is 50 g guar gum for every 500 mg<br>
ursodeoxycholic acid in 100 mL water and 80g of pectin<br>
for every 500 mg of ursodeoxycholic acid in 100 mL water.<br>
The minimal required quantity of high molecular weight<br>
aqueous soluble starch conversion products or soluble<br>
non-starch polysaccharide is primarily determined by the<br>
absolute quantity of bile acids in the solution<br>
formulation rather than the concentration.<br>
In some embodiments of the disclosure, a formulation<br>
may  comprise  cyclodextrin  in  addition  to  a  starch<br>
conversion product and/or a non-starch polysaccharide.<br>
Alternatively, in some embodiments, a composition of the.<br>
disclosure may lack cyclodextrin.<br>
In some embodiments of the disclosure, the<br>
formulation further comprises dietary fiber. Non-<br>
limiting examples of dietary fiber include guar gum,<br>
pectin, psyllium, oat gum, soybean fiber, oat bran, corn<br>
bran, cellulose and wheat bran. .<br>
In some embodiments of the disclosure, the<br>
formulation further comprises emulsifying agents. For<br>
the purpose of the disclosure, the term "emulsifying<br>
agent" includes emulsifying agents and suspending agents.<br>
Non-limiting examples of emulsifying agents include guar<br>
gum, pectin, acacia, carrageenan, carboxymethyl cellulose<br>
sodium, hydroxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose,<br>
methyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, povidone, tragacanth<br>
gum, xanthan gum, and sorbian ester.<br>
The selected pH range for which the formulation will<br>
not precipitate its bile acid, starch conversion product,<br>
soluble non-starch polysaccharide or its pharmaceutical<br>
compound may be any range of pH levels obtainable with an<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PCT/US2005/039089<br>
26<br>
aqueous system. Preferably this range is between about<br>
pH 1 and about pH 14 and more preferably between about pH<br>
1 and about pH 10. Still more preferably the range is<br>
any subset of the range of pH levels obtainable in an<br>
aqueous system sufficient for a pharmaceutical<br>
formulation to remain in solution from preparation, to<br>
administration, to absorption in the body, according to<br>
the method of administration. Thus, the composition may<br>
be used as a pharmaceutical formulation wherein the<br>
pharmaceutical compound remains in solution without<br>
precipitation at prevailing • pH levels in the mouth,<br>
stomach and intestines. In some embodiments of the<br>
disclosure, a bile acid remains dissolved under acidic<br>
conditions as a free bile acid in spite of the general<br>
insolubility of bile acids under acidic conditions.<br>
In  some  embodiments  of  the  disclosure,   the<br>
pharmaceutical is riluzole.   Non-limiting examples of<br>
other pharmaceutical compounds include hormones, hormone<br>
antagonists,  analgesic,  antipyretics,  anti-inflammatory<br>

The stability of dosage formulations of the<br>
disclosure may be evaluated by measuring the<br>
concentration of the relevant bile acid over time in<br>
preparations comprising soluble bile acid, a high<br>
molecular weight aqueous soluble starch conversion<br>
product, and water at various pH and temperature levels.<br>
The retention time (high performance liquid<br>
chromatography) of each bile acid may be adjusted as<br>
needed to permit individual analysis each bile acid<br>
present in complex samples, i.e. a sample having a<br>
plurality of bile acids. Stability tests may also be<br>
performed by assessing the light-scattering properties of<br>
a test solution. In addition, established accelerated<br>
testing conditions may be used.<br>
All stability tests performed on solutions of the<br>
disclosure were satisfactory in that the concentration of<br>
bile acid as measured by HPLC did not change appreciably<br>
over time at various pH levels. Particularly, all bile<br>
acid solution formulations tested showed excellent<br>
results in the stability tests with no precipitation and<br>
no physical appearance changes over the test period.<br>
Some formulations remain stable for over 2 years. The<br>
aqueous solution dosage forms according to this<br>
disclosure that were tested did not change either<br>
physically or chemically at various pH conditions under<br>
the accelerated conditions despite the addition of<br>
therapeutically and chemically active agents that are<br>
stable  and  soluble  in  hydrochloric  acid  solution.<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PCT/US2005/039089<br>
32<br>
Therefore, these aqueous solution systems may be<br>
extremely valuable pharmaceutical dosage forms for the<br>
therapeutically active bile acids preparations, and/or<br>
the drug (pharmaceutical compound) delivery preparations<br>
in which bile acids play roles as the adjuvant of drug,<br>
the carrier of drug, or the enhancer of solubility of a<br>
drug by micelle formation at various pH conditions<br>
without the stability problems, including precipitation<br>
in acidic conditions.<br>
Human neuronal cells were treated with a solution of<br>
the disclosure and 50 μM of hydrogen peroxide and/or<br>
cisplatin. Hydrogen peroxide is strong oxidant.<br>
Cisplatin stimulates production of reactive oxygen<br>
species (ROS), which  interfere with the antioxidant<br>
defense system. Cell viability, cell • proliferation, and<br>
apoptosis were then analyzed by measurement of MTT<br>
reduction. Several studies, using exogenous ROS, and<br>
H2O2, in particular, demonstrate that exposure of human<br>
and rat peripheral vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs)<br>
to relatively low levels of oxidant stress, for short<br>
periods promotes cell growth, whereas prolonged exposure<br>
to higher concentrations leads to cell death, either by<br>
apoptosis or necrosis.<br>
Cell viability for hydrogen peroxide with and<br>
without solution of the disclosure was evaluated by using<br>
the MTT assay. Cells treated with a solution of the<br>
disclosure (0.2 mg/ml solubilized UDCA) and hydrogen<br>
peroxide (50 μM) displayed the highest cell viability<br>
(75% compared to control, 100%). The lowest cell<br>
viability (26% compared to control, 100%) was observed in<br>
cells treated with hydrogen peroxide (50 μM) alone.<br>
These effects were found in a dosage-dependent fashion.<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PCT/US2005/039089<br>
33<br>
Cell viability in the presence of cisplatin was<br>
evaluated in like manner. The highest cell viability<br>
(87% compared to control, 100%) was observed in cells<br>
treated with both cisplatin (20 μM) and a solution of the<br>
disclosure (1mg/ml soluble UDCA), whereas the lowest cell<br>
viability (35% compared to control, 100%) was observed in<br>
cells treated with cisplatin (20 μM) alone. These<br>
effects were also found in a dosage-dependent fashion.<br>
According to the MTT assays, a solution of the disclosure<br>
may block almost completely hydrogen peroxide-induced<br>
oxidative cytotoxicity and may completely block-<br>
cisplatin-induced oxidative cytotoxicity. In conclusion,<br>
solution of the disclosure possess a strong antioxidative<br>
properties and non-cytotoxicity.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Some embodiments of the present disclosure may be<br>
understood in connection with the following examples.<br>
However, one skilled in the art will readily appreciate<br>
the specific materials, compositions, and results<br>
described are merely illustrative of the disclosure, and<br>
are not intended to, nor should be construed to, limit<br>
the scope disclosure and its various embodiments.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of Bile Acid Solutions<br>
A stock solution of bile acid was prepared by first<br>
dissolving UDCA (60 g) in 500 mL NaOH (6.7 g) solution.<br>
Next, to the resulting clear solution, 375 g of<br>
maltodextrin was added, portion by portion with vigorous<br>
agitation. The pH was then adjusted to between 7.0 and<br>
7.2 by the dropwise addition of HCl with high throughput<br>
sonication (750W, 20kHz) .  The volume was then adjusted<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PCT/US2005/039089<br>
34<br>
to 1.0 L with injectable distilled water. Lastly, the<br>
resulting clear solution was filtered with sterilized<br>
using a 0.22 μ GP express plus membrane under aseptic<br>
conditions. (This filtration is important for<br>
sterilization, but not for removing particulate matter<br>
since the solution is already clear.) Dilutions of this<br>
solution to the desired UDCA concentration were prepared<br>
according to standard pharmacy practice.<br>
Example 2: Preparation of Bile Acid Solutions<br>
A stock solution of bile acid was prepared by first<br>
dissolving UDCA (25 g) in 400 mL NaOH (2.7 g) solution.<br>
Next, to the resulting clear solution, 745 g of <br>
maltodextrin was added, portion by portion with vigorous<br>
agitation. To this resulting solution 100 mL of a<br>
preserve solution which contains 0.95g of methyl p-<br>
hydroxybenzoate and 0.3g of sodium hydrogensulfite was<br>
added and then stirred. The volume was then adjusted to<br>
1.0 L with pharmaceutical grade water. Lastly, the<br>
resulting, clear solution was filtered with proper<br>
filtering apparatus. (This filtration is not performed<br>
to remove particulate matter since the solution is<br>
already clear.) Dilutions of this solution to the<br>
desired UDCA concentration were prepared according to<br>
standard pharmacy practice.<br>
Example 3: Animal Test<br>
Transgenic Rat; The transgenic animals used in this<br>
example were heterozygotic hSODl carriers with a<br>
glycine93-alanine mutation (G93A). The strain is<br>
registered as B6SJL-TgN(SODl-G93A)IGur (The Jackson Lab.,<br>
Bar Harbor, ME, USA) containing a reduced copy number of<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PCT/US2005/039089<br>
35<br>
hSODl.were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories.<br>
Transgenic mice, over-expressing the human SOD1 gene with<br>
a mutation identified in ALS patients, develop an adult-<br>
onset, progressive motor deterioration. These transgenic<br>
mice are considered to be a model for the disease and<br>
have been used to test a number of strategies to delay-<br>
disease progression and mortality.<br>
In order to evaluate the potential benefit of<br>
present invention in ALS, 240mg/kg solubilized UDCA in<br>
the present solution were given - by the oral<br>
administration twice per week, beginning when G93A<br>
transgenic mice were 70 days old and continuing until<br>
death.<br>
Life expectancy and its results;  The mean life<br>
expectancy of the control mice (n=8) and the treated mice<br>
(n=8) is shown in Fig. 1. The clear solution (25 mg/kg)<br>
increased the mean survival time from 134.8 days in the<br>
control mice  (n=8)  to 146.6days in the treated mice<br>
(n=8),  a  delay  of  mortality  with  13  days.  This<br>
corresponds to an 8.81% increase in life span of the G93A<br>
mice.<br>
Rotarod Test and its results; A rotarod was used to<br>
evaluate motor performance. Mice were placed on the rod<br>
against the direction of rotation, forcing them to keep<br>
moving forwards to avoid slipping off the rod backwards.<br>
After a learning period of several days, mice were able<br>
to stay on the rotarod rotating at 15 r.p.m. Mice were<br>
tested once a week. Each mouse was given three trials on<br>
each rotarod test and the time they remained on the rod<br>
before sliding off was recorded (latency). The highest<br>
staying time on the rotarod was chosen from among the<br>
three trials as a measure for motor performance.<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PCT/US2005/039089<br>
36<br>
The motor performance of treated mice did improve<br>
greatly as the disease progressed, while the motor<br>
performance of untreated mice declined more and more<br>
rapidly as the disease progressed. Differences in motor<br>
performance between untreated and treated mice was highly<br>
significant on day 112(p=0.01), on day 119(0.001), on day<br>
126(p=0.01), on day 133(p=0.001) and on day 140(p=0.043).<br>
Conclusion; 70 days old, an age at which progressive<br>
cytoskeletal alterations extensively began to demonstrate<br>
in SOD1-G93A rat, has been known as cl-inical onset of<br>
ALS. These data demonstrate that solubilized UDCA<br>
solution significantly prolongs life span, retards the<br>
onset of paralysis and slows the evolution of functional<br>
parameters connected with muscle strength in the ALS-<br>
mouse model. Moreover, the improved motor performance on<br>
older models than 70 days old with administration of<br>
solubilized UDCA has been provided that this invent<br>
solution can treat advanced ALS disease with recovering<br>
motor performance.<br>
Example 4: Cell survival experiments<br>
To evaluate the protective effect of solubilized<br>
UDCA solution on wild type cells, G93A cells, and A4V<br>
cells, these cells were treated with solutions containing<br>
200nM or 20 ΜM of solubilized UDCA after neuronal<br>
differentiation and then, were incubated for 24 h. The<br>
protective effect of solubilized UDCA solution on wild<br>
type cells, G93A cells, and A4V cells was determined by<br>
using both the MTT assay and Trypan blue staining. Cell<br>
viability may be expressed as a percentage of cell<br>
survival as shown in Figure 2.<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PCT/US2005/039089<br>
37<br>
GSNO has been known to be associated with cell<br>
apoptosis. To evaluate the anti-apoptotic effect of<br>
solubilized UDCA against GSNO on wild type cells and<br>
cells containing G93A and A4V mutations in hSODl,<br>
wildtype cells, G93A cells, and A4V cells were incubated<br>
with 500 μM GSNO for 24h in order to induce apoptosis and<br>
then cell viability of was determined. These apoptosis-<br>
induced wildtype cells, G93A cells, and A4V cells were<br>
next incubated with 20 μM of solubilized UDCA for 24h and<br>
cell viability was determined again using both the MTT<br>
assay and Trypan blue staining. Cell viability may be<br>
expressed as a percentage of cell survival as shown in<br>
Figure 3.<br>
Cell culture: VSC 4.1. . (ventral spinal cord 4.1;<br>
motoneuron-neuroblastoma hybrid cells) were maintained in<br>
Dulbecco's modified Eagles'  medium/F-12  growth medium<br>
(Gibco, Grand Island, NY) with Sato's components (Sigma,<br>
St. Louis, MD) and 2% heat-inactivated newborn calf serum<br>
(HyClone,  Logan,  UT).   They were grown in log-phase<br>
growth  on poly-(L-ornithine)-precoated  culture  dishes<br>
(Falcon, Franklin lakes, NJ). After confluency, the cells<br>
were plated in 96-well plates  (NUNC,  Denmark)  at a<br>
density of 1 X 10n (n=4) cells/well.  For immunoblot, 1 X<br>
10n (n=5) cells were seeded in 100 mm dishes (Falcon,<br>
Franklin Lakes, NJ).<br>
Constructs and establishing stable cell line: Wild<br>
type (control) or mutant (G93A, A4V) human Cu/Zn SOD-1<br>
cDNA was cloned into the BamHI and EcoRII sites of pcDNA<br>
3.0. An empty vector that did.not contain the insert was<br>
used for the control. Cells were tranfected (Superfect,<br>
Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and maintained in a medium that<br>
contained G418 at a concentration of 400 mg/ml (Gibco,<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PC1YUS2005/039089<br>
38<br>
Grand Island, NY) . Single or pooled colonies were used<br>
for the experiment after clarifying the expression of<br>
human SOD1 (WT, Mutant) by Western blot analysis using an<br>
anti-human SOD1 polyclonal antibody (Calbiochem, La<br>
Jolla, CA) . These cell lines were grown under the same<br>
conditions as the VSC 4.1 cells.<br>
MTT assay and trypan blue staining to evaluate the<br>
protective   effects   and   its   results;    3-(4,5-<br>
dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium     bromide<br>
(MTT) is absorbed into cells and converted to formazan by<br>
the  action of mitochondrial  succinate dehydrogenase'.<br>
Therefore, accumulation of formazan reflects the activity<br>
of  mitochondria  directly  and  the  cell  viability<br>
indirectly.   Thus, ' neuronally  differentiated  cells<br>
(wildtype cells(control),  G93A cells, A4V cells)  were<br>
plated at a density of 1 X 10n (n=4) cells^well in a 96<br>
well plate.   To evaluate the effect of G93A or A4V<br>
mutations on viability, the plated cells were incubated<br>
with the culture media containing 1 mM dibutyryl cAMP and<br>
0.025 ug^mL aphidicolin, and the viability of wildtype<br>
cells, G93A cells, and A4V cells was evaluated as a<br>
function of concentration.  To evaluate the protective<br>
effect of solubilized UDCA on viability, 200nM and 20 μM<br>
of solubilized UDCA were added into the media. At 24 h of<br>
incubation, 50 μL of 2 mg/mL MTT (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO,<br>
USA) were added after media (200 μL) were added into each<br>
well. Subsequently, 220 μL of the solution were removed<br>
from each well, and 150 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide were<br>
then added back to each well. Finally, optical density<br>
(OD) was read at 540 nm on the ELISA plate reader after<br>
particles in the well were dissolved by a microplate<br>
mixer for 10 min.   Results were calibrated using OD<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PCT/US2005/039089<br>
39<br>
measured without cell culture. For trypan blue staining,<br>
10 μL of trypan blue solution were added to 10 μL of<br>
cells collected from each plate, and the cells were<br>
incubated for 2 min. Unstained live cells were counted on<br>
a haemocytometer. Cell viability was expressed as<br>
percentages of the cell survival.<br>
The viability of the wild type cells, G93A cells,<br>
and A4V cells was 100%, 130% and 115%, respectively,<br>
compared to untreated wild type cells (control; 100%),<br>
when treated with 200 nM of solubilized UDCA. At 100<br>
times higher concentration of solubilized UDCA (20 μM)<br>
than 200 nM, the viability of wild type cells, G93A<br>
cells, and A4V cells were 89%, 133% and 101%,<br>
respectively, compared to untreated wild type cells<br>
(control; 100%). This experimental data showed that<br>
solubilized UDCA has a protective effect on G93A cells<br>
and A4V cells, and is non-toxic to wild type cells, G93A<br>
cells and A4V cells.<br>
DAPI staining to evaluate apoptosis by GSNO and its<br>
results; 4', 6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride<br>
(DAPI) staining was performed to evaluate apoptosis as<br>
follows. After differentiation, the wildtype (control),<br>
G93A, and A4V cells were incubated with/without 500 μM<br>
GSNO for 24 h; the cells were then centrifuged at 265 g<br>
for 2 min, and 4% neutral buffered formalin (100 μL) was<br>
added to the cell pellet. A 50 ΜL aliquot of the cell<br>
suspension was applied to a glass slide and dried at room<br>
temperature. The fixed cells were washed in PBS, air<br>
dried, and stained for 20 min with the DNA-specific<br>
fluorochrome, DAPI (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA). The<br>
adhered cells were rinsed with PBS, air dried, and<br>
mounted with 90% glycerol. The slides were observed under<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PCT/US2005/039089<br>
40<br>
Olympus fluorescence microscopy(pictures). Cell viability<br>
was expressed as percentages of the cell survival.<br>
DAPI staining showed that the percent of apoptotic<br>
cells among the G93A and A4V cells (19% . versus 25%,<br>
respectively) significantly increased compared with the<br>
wild cells (8%). The increased percentage of cells<br>
undergoing apoptosis in G93A and A4V cells provided<br>
evidence that apoptotic effect of GSNO was more<br>
significant on G93A cells and A4V cells than the wild<br>
type cells.<br>
MTT assay and trypan blue staining to evaluate the<br>
anti-apoptotic effects of solubilized UDCA and its<br>
results;	3- (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-<br>
diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) is absorbed into cells<br>
and converted to formazan by the action of mitochondrial<br>
succinate dehydrogenase. Therefore, accumulation of<br>
formazan reflects the activity of mitochondria directly<br>
and the cell viability indirectly. Thus, neuronally<br>
differentiated cells (wildtype cells (control), G93A<br>
cells, A4V cells) were plated at a density of 1 X 10n<br>
(n=4) cells/well in a 96 well plate. The plated cells<br>
were incubated with the culture media containing 1 mM<br>
dibutyryl cAMP and 0.025 ug/mL aphidicolin, and then,<br>
were further incubated for 24h with/without addition of<br>
500 μM GSNO. To evaluate the anti-apoptotic effect of<br>
solubilized UDCA on cells, 200nM and 20 μM of solubilized<br>
UDCA were added into the media. At 24 h of incubation, 50<br>
μL of 2 mg/mL MTT (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) were<br>
added after media (200 μL) were added into each well.<br>
Subsequently, 220 μL of the solution were removed from<br>
each well, and 150 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide were then<br>

was read at 54 0 nm on the ELISA plate reader after<br>
particles in the well were dissolved by a microplate<br>
mixer for 10 min. Results were calibrated using OD<br>
measured without cell culture. For trypan blue staining,<br>
10 μL of trypan blue solution were added to 10 μL of<br>
cells collected from each plate, and the cells were<br>
incubated for 2 min. Unstained live cells were counted on<br>
a haemocytometer. Cell viability was expressed as<br>
percentages of the cell survival.<br>
The decrement of viability by S-nitrosoglutathione-<br>
induced apoptosis was more prominent in G93A cells and-<br>
A4V cells than in wild type cells.   The increment of<br>
viability by solubilized UDCA in GSNO treated (apoptotic).<br>
cells was  significant  in G93A cells  and A4V cells<br>
compared to the wild type cells.   More specifically,<br>
compared to the wild type cells (92%),the viabilities of<br>
G93A and A4V mutations were 81% and 75%, respectively, at<br>
24 h after the incubation with 500 μM GSNO.  After adding<br>
solubilized UDCA and incubating further, the viability of<br>
the wild type cells, G93A and A4V cells increased to 98%<br>
from to 92% in the wild type cells, increased to 100%<br>
from 81% in G93A cells, and increased to 115% from to 75%<br>
in A4V cells.<br>
This experiment demonstrates that soluble UDCA<br>
solution may protect G93A and A4V cell from NO-mediated<br>
apoptosis and may revive apoptosis-mediated damaged cells<br>
of ALS.<br>
As will be understood by those of ordinary skill in<br>
the art, other equivalent or alternative methods, and/or<br>
compositions for ameliorating and/or treating a symptom<br>
of a neurodegenerative disease and/or a motor neuron<br>
disease.  For example, methods and dosages may be scaled<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PCT/US2005/039089<br>
42<br>
to diagnose and/or treat subjects of different sizes<br>
(e.g.,  children and adults),  subjects with additional<br>
allergies or conditions, and/or subjects having varying<br>
severity of  allergy  and/or  symptoms.    In addition,<br>
methods and dosages may be adapted to fluctuations over<br>
time (e.g., monthly or seasonal).  These equivalents and<br>
alternatives along with obvious changes and modifications<br>
are intended to be included within the scope of the<br>
present disclosure.   For example, values and/or range<br>
endpoints provided are not intended to be rigid limits<br>
for all embodiments.  Moreover, one of ordinary skill in<br>
the art will appreciate that no single embodiment, use,<br>
and/or advantage is intended to universally control or<br>
exclude other embodiments, uses, and/or advantages.  For  <br>
example, a medical practitioner may deem circumstances to<br>
warrant giving preference to one over another.  While the<br>
present disclosure includes extensive information about<br>
current perceptions of the genetics, biochemistry, and<br>
cell biology of ALS and bile acid metabolism, future work<br>
may  reveal  that  aspects  of  these  perceptions  are<br>
inaccurate or incomplete.   Accordingly,  as will be<br>
understood by those skilled in the art,  the present<br>
disclosure, whether taken in whole or in part, is not<br>
limited to a particular model or mechanism of action.  In<br>
addition, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize<br>
that other equivalent or alternative compositions and<br>
methods may be used.   For example, while a number of<br>
compounds  have  been  disclosed as  being  capable  of<br>
administration with a bile acid, other compounds may be<br>
included  as  well.     Also,  administration  of  a<br>
pharmaceutical may be performed at the same time as<br>
administration of a bile acid composition or the two may<br><br>
WO 2006/050165	PCT/US2005/039089<br>
43<br>
simply be administered during the same or overlapping<br>
time periods (e.gr., during the same hour, the same day,<br>
or the same week) . Accordingly, the foregoing disclosure<br>
is intended to be illustrative, but not limiting, of the<br>
