				<td>PARTICULATE WOOD PRESERVATIVE AND<br>
METHOD FOR PRODUCING SAME<br>
[0001] This application claims priority to the following U.S. Provisional applications:<br>
60/478,822, 60/478,827,60/478,825, and 60/478,820, all of which were filed on June 17,<br>
2003, and also to U.S. Provisional app ication 60/571,535 filed on May 17,2004, each of<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to wood preservatives, particularly wood preservatives<br>
comprising particles including one or more copper compounds. More particularly, the<br>
invention relates to a wood preservative comprising injectable particles of sparingly soluble<br>
copper salts, as well as methods to prespare the wood preservative, and methods of preserving<br>
wood using the wood preservatives.<br>
[0003] The production of wood which has been treated to inhibit biological decomposition<br>
is well known. Decay is caused by fungi that feed on cellulose or lignin of wood. Such<br>
organisms causing wood decomposition include: basidiomycetes such as Gloeophyllum<br>
trabeum (brown rot), Trametes vers color (white rot), Serpula lacrymans (dry rot) and<br>
Coniophora puteana. Soft rot attacks the surface of almost all hard and softwoods, and it<br>
favors wet conditions. Most of these fungi require food and moisture, e.g., moisture contents<br>
in wood of greater than 20% are conducive to fungal growth. Dry rot is tenacious, as it can<br>
grow in dry wood. Insects are also major causes of wood deterioration. Exemplary<br>
organisms causing wood decomposition include coleopterans such as Anobium punctatum<br>
(furniture beetle), Hylotrupes bajulus (house longhorn) and Xestobium rufovillorum (death<br>
watch beetle); hymenopterans such as termites and carpenter ants; and also by marine borers<br>
and/or wasps. Finally, termites are ubiquitous, and termite damage is estimated in the United<br>
States alone to be about $2 billion per year<br>
[0004] The production of wood based composite products has increased dramatically in<br>
recent years. Oriented strandboard (OSB) production exceeded that of plywood in 2000. The<br>
use of medium density fiberboard and hardboard panel products likewise has increased<br>
dramatically over the last couple of decades. However, these products are typically used in<br>
interior applications where attack from insects or decay fungi is limited, because it has been<br>
found that these products are particularly susceptible to attack by biological agents such as<br>
decay fungi and termites.<br>
[0005] Preservatives are used to treat wood to resist insect attack and decay. The<br>
commercially used preservatives are separated into three basic categories, based primarily on<br>
the mode of application—waterborne, creosote, and oil borne preservatives. Waterborne<br><br>
preservatives include chromated coppe arsenate (CCA), ammoniacal copper quat (ACQ,<br>
which is believed to be Copper-MEA-Carbonate and a quaternary amine), amrnoniacal<br>
copper zinc arsenate (ACZA), and ammoniacal copper arsenate (ACA). Wood treated with<br>
these chemicals sometimes turns green or grey-green because of a chemical reaction between<br>
copper in the preservative and the sun's ultraviolet rays. The preservatives leach into the soil<br>
over time, especially those made without chromium, when exposed to weather. Creosote<br>
does not easily leach into soil, and it is lot corrosive to metals, but it can not be painted and it<br>
leaves a dark, oily surface that has a strong odor. Oil borne preservatives are made of certain<br>
compounds dissolved in light petroleun oils, including pentachlorophenol (commonly known<br>
as "penta"), copper naphthenate, and copper-8-quinolinolate. These preservatives leave a<br>
surface that often is non-paintable, and he surface: of the wood can be dark and unnaturally<br>
colored.<br>
[0006] Modern organic biocides are considered to be relatively environmentally benign and<br>
not expected to pose the problems associated with CCA-treated lumber. Biocides such as<br>
tebuconazole are quite soluble in common organic solvents, while others such as<br>
chlorothalonil possess only low solubility. The solubility of organic biocides affects the<br>
markets for which the biocide-treated wood products are appropriate. Biocides with good<br>
solubility can be dissolved at high concentrations in a small amount of organic solvents, and<br>
that solution can be dispersed in water vith appropriate emulsifiers to produce an aqueous<br>
emulsion. The emulsion can be used in conventional pressure treatments for lumber and<br>
wood treated in such a manner, and can be used in products such as decking where the treated<br>
wood will come into contact with humans. Biocides which possess low solubility must be<br>
incorporated into wood in a solution of a hydrocarbon oil, such as AWPA P9 Type A, and the<br>
resulting organic solution is used to treat wood directly. Wood treated in this way can be used<br>
only for industrial applications, such as utility poles and railway ties, because the oil is<br>
irritating to human skin.<br>
[0007] The primary preserved wood product has historically been southern pine lumber<br>
treated with chromated copper arsenate 
decks, fencing and landscape timbers. There has recently been raised concerns about the<br>
safety and health effects of CCA as a wood preservative, primarily relating to the arsenic<br>
content but also to the chromium content. In 2003/2004, due in part to regulatory guidelines<br>
and to concerns about safety, there has been a substantial cessation of use of CCA-treated<br>
products. A new generation of copper containing wood preservatives uses a form of copper<br>
that is soluble. Known preservatives include copper alkanolamine complexes, copper<br><br>
polyaspartic acid complex, alkaline copper quaternary, copper azole, copper boron azole,<br>
copper bis(dimethyldithiocarbamate), ammoniacal copper citrate, copper citrate, and the<br>
copper ethanolamine carbonate. In practice, the principal criterion for commercial<br>
acceptance, assuming treatment efficacy, is cost. Of the many compositions listed above,<br>
only two soluble copper containing wood preservatives have found commercial acceptance:<br>
1) the copper ethanolamine carbonate manufactured for example according to the process<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,646,147 and 2) copper boron azole. There are, however, several<br>
problems with these new copper-containing preservatives.<br>
[0008] The soluble copper containing wood preservatives are very leachable, compared to<br>
CCA. One study has shown that as much as 80 percent of the copper from a copper amine<br>
carbonate complex is removed in about 10 years under a given set of field conditions. Under<br>
severe conditions, such as the those used for the American Wood Preserving Association's<br>
standard leaching test, these products are quickly leached from the wood. For example, we<br>
found that 77% by weight of a Cu- monoethanolamine preservative was leached from the<br>
preserved wood in 14 days. This leaching is of concern for at least two reasons: 1) removal<br>
of the copper portion of the pesticide from the wood by leaching will compromise the long<br>
term efficacy of the formulation and 2) the leached copper causes concern that the<br>
environment will be contaminated. While most animals tolerate copper, copper is extremely<br>
toxic to certain fish at sub-part per million levels. Common ranges for EC50 for copper are<br>
between 2 and 12 micrograms per liter. Another study reported following the Synthetic<br>
Precipitation Leaching Procedure. The study results showed that the leachate from CCA-<br>
treated wood contained about 4 mg copper per liter; leachate from copper boron azole-treated<br>
wood contained about 28 mg copper per liter; leachate from copper<br>
bis(dimethyldithiocarbamate) treated wood had 7 to 8 mg copper per liter; leachate from<br>
alkaline copper quaternary treated wood had 29 mg copper per liter; and leachate from copper<br>
citrate treated wood had 62 mg copper per liter. However, copper concentrations depend in<br>
part on copper concentration, and CCA had about 7% of total copper leach, the alkaline<br>
copper quaternary preservative had about 12% of the total copper leach, while the copper<br>
boron azole had about 22% of the total copper leach during the Synthetic Precipitation<br>
Leaching Procedure. Copper leaching is such a problem that some states do not allow use of<br>
wood treated with the soluble copper containing wood preservatives near waterways.<br>
f0O09] Another concern with soluble copper preservative products generally is that most<br>
preservative materials are manufactured at one of several central locations but are used in<br>
disparate areas and must be shipped, sometimes substantial distances. The cost of providing<br><br>
and transporting the liquid carrier for these soluble products can be considerable, and the<br>
likelihood of an extreme biological impact is very high if transported soluble copper wood<br>
preservative material is spilled or accidentally released near a waterway.<br>
[0010] Further, unlike CCA, all of these soluble copper containing wood preservatives<br>
require a second organic biocide to be effective against some biological species. Therefore,<br>
wood preserved with these soluble copper containing wood preservatives also contains a<br>
second biocide that is efficacious against one or more particularly troublesome species. Oil-<br>
soluble biocides such as a copper(II)-sulfited tannin extract complex (epicatechins) can be<br>
dissolved in light oils, emulsified in water, and injected into the wood, as is disclosed in U.S.<br>
Patent 4,988,545. Alternatively, the second biocide is often slightly water soluble or<br>
emulsified, and may be composed of a tr iazole group or a quaternary amine group or a<br>
nitroso-amine group, and this biocide can be simply added to the fluid used for pressure<br>
treating the wood.<br>
[0011] One attempt to improve soluble copper containing wood preservatives was to<br>
incorporate other salts. PCT patent application WO 92/19429, published Nov. 12, 1992, in<br>
Example 2, describes a method of treatir g an article of prepared wood by immersing it for 20<br>
minutes in a bath of 180° C linseed oil containing a drying agent, or drier, of 0.07% lead,<br>
0.003% manganese and 0.004% calcium naphthenate, 0.3% copper naphthenate, and 0.03<br>
zinc naphthenates as an insecticide and fungicide. Others have tried alternative metal-<br>
compounds, including silver. None of these have found commercial acceptance.<br>
[0012] Fojutowski, A.; Lewandowski, O, Zesz. Probl. Postepow Nauk Roln. No. 209: 197-<br>
204 (1978), describes fungicides comprising fatty acids with copper compounds, applied by<br>
dipping hardboard heated to 120° C into a bath of the fungicide, also maintained at 120° C.<br>
This is not practicable for a variety of reasons. In "A New Approach To Non-Toxic, Wide-<br>
Spectrum, Ground-Contact Wood Preservatives, Part I. Approach And Reaction<br>
Mechanisms," HOLZFORSCHUNG Vol. 47, No. 3,1993, pp. 253-260, it is asserted that<br>
copper soaps, made with the carboxylic acid groups from unsaturated fatty acids of non-toxic<br>
vegetable oils, rosin, and from synthetic unsaturated polyester resins have effectiveness and<br>
long-term durability as ground contact wood preservatives for use against termites and fungal<br>
attack. These are not yet in widespread use, and are expected to have high leach rates and the<br>
bio-available fatty acids are expected to encourage some molds.<br>
[0013] The solubility of copper preservatives can be controlled by using, for example, an oil<br>
barrier. But these oils can unfavorably change the color, appearance, and burning properties<br><br>
of the wood, and can be strong irritants. Oil-soaked wood containing oil-soluble biocides like<br>
chlorothalonil, e.g., utility poles, are highly resistant to leaching and biological attack, but the<br>
appearance of this wood is not acceptable for moat uses. Japanese Patent Application 08-<br>
183,010 JP, published in 1996, describes a modified wood claimed to have mildew-proofing<br>
and antiseptic properties and ant-proofing properties, made by treating wood with a<br>
processing liquid containing a copper salt and linseed oil or another liquid hardening<br>
composition. U.S. Pat. No. 3,837,875 describes as; a composition for cleaning, sealing,<br>
preserving, protecting and beautifying host materials such as wood a mixture of boiled<br>
linseed oil, turpentine, pine oil, a dryer and 28 parts per million of metallic copper. Feist and<br>
Mraz, Forest Products Lab Madison Wis., Wood Finishing: Water Repellents and Water-<br>
Repellent Preservatives. Revision, Report Number-FSRN-FPL-0124-Rev (NTIS 1978)<br>
discloses preservatives containing a substance that repels water (usually paraffin wax or<br>
related material), a resin or drying oil, and a solvent such as turpentine or mineral spirits.<br>
Addition of a preservative such as copper naphthenate to the water repellent is asserted to<br>
protect wood surfaces against decay and mildew organisms. Soviet Union Patent No. SU<br>
642166 describes a wood surface staining and preservation treatment, carried out by<br>
impregnating wood with an aqueous copper salt solution, followed by thermal treatment in<br>
boiling drying oil containing 8-hydroxyquinoline dye. U.S. published application<br>
20030108759 describes injecting a copper ammonium acetate complex and a drying oil as a<br>
wood preservative. Again, oil is not favored as it can alter burning characteristics of wood,<br>
can be staining and/or discoloring, and can be an irritant. It is also difficult to work with and<br>
to inject into wood. None of the above methods of preserving wood have met commercial<br>
acceptance.<br>
[0014] U.S. Patent 6,521,288 describes adding certain organic biocides to polymeric<br>
nanoparticles (particles), and claims benefits including: 1) protecting the biocides during<br>
processing, 2) having an ability to incorporate water-insoluble biocides, 3) achieving a more<br>
even distribution of the biocide than the pr or art method of incorporating small particles of<br>
the biocide into the wood, since the polymer component acts as a diluent, 4) reducing<br>
leaching with nanoparticles, and 5) protecting the biocide within the polymer from<br>
environmental degradation. The application states that the method is useful for biocides<br>
including chlorinated hydrocarbons, organometallics, halogen-releasing compounds, metallic<br>
salts, organic sulfur compounds, and phenolics, and preferred embodiments include copper<br>
naphthenate, zinc naphthenate, quaternary ammonium salts, pentachlorophenol,<br>
tebuconazole, chlorothalonil, chlorpyrifos, sothiazolones, propiconazole, other triazoles,<br><br>
pyrethroids, and other insecticides, imidichloprid oxine copper and the like, and also<br>
nanoparticles with variable release rates that incorporate inorganic preservatives as boric<br>
acid, sodium borate salts, zinc borate, copper salts and zinc salts. The only examples used the<br>
organic biocides tebuconazole and chlorothalonil incorporated in polymeric nanoparticles.<br>
There is no enabling disclosure relating to any metal salts. While data was presented showing<br>
efficacy of tebuconazole/polymeric nano particle formulations and chlorothalonil /polymeric<br>
nanoparticle formulations in wood, the efficacy of these treatments was not compared to<br>
those found when using other methods of injecting the same biocide loading into wood.<br>
Efficacy/leach resistance data was presented on wood product material, where it was found<br>
that the nanoparticle/biocide treated wood had the same properties as the wood product<br>
treated with a solution of the biocide, i.e., the polymeric nanoparticles had no effect. Finally,<br>
it is known in the art that transport of preservative material is a large cost item, and diluents<br>
will merely exacerbate this problem.<br>
[0015] We have discussed the problems with current systems, e.g., they add undesired oil;<br>
they increase corrosion; they are dilute; they are expensive, especially when the metal-based<br>
biocides must be combined with large quantities of organic biocides; the high copper leach<br>
rates are both a serious environmental problem in itself and will almost certainly decrease the<br>
longevity of treatment below that obtainec with CCA. However, cost is a primary factor in<br>
the selection of a wood preservative. The market is accustomed to the low cost and<br>
effectiveness of CCA, and the market is not ready to bear the incremental costs of large<br>
amounts of expensive biocides and other materials such as polymeric nanoparticles.<br>
[0016] The principal aspect of the invent ion is the copper-based particulate preservative<br>
treatment for wood and wood products. One embodiment of this invention is an effective,<br>
long-lasting, environmentally responsible, non-staining/coloring, inexpensive, non-corrosion-<br>
inducing, injectable, substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble), copper-based<br>
particulate preservative treatment for wood and wood products that is substantially free of<br>
hazardous material. Yet another embodiment of the invention is an effective, long-lasting,<br>
environmentally responsible, non-staining/coloring, inexpensive, non-corrosion-inducing,<br>
injectable, substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble), zinc-based particulate<br>
preservative treatment for wood and wood products that is substantially free of hazardous<br>
material This zinc-based particulate composition can be used independently of the copper-<br>
based particulates, but in preferred embodiments is used in combination with one or more<br>
copper-based particulates. In preferred embodiments;, the substantially crystalline (or<br>
amorphous sparingly soluble) copper- and/or zinc-based particulates are injected in a<br><br>
formulation comprising one or more organic biocides. As used herein, the term "organic<br>
biocide" also includes organometallic biocides.<br>
[0017] One aspect of the present invention relates to a preservative that may be used to<br>
preserve wood and wood products. In one embodiment, a preservative of the invention is a<br>
copper-based preservative. In a preferred embodiment, the copper-based preservative<br>
comprises copper-based particles. Exemplary particles comprise, for example, copper<br>
hydroxide, a copper salt, and a copper oxide.<br>
[0018] In one embodiment, the copper-based particles comprise a substantially crystalline<br>
copper compound. At least about 20%, 30%, 50%, or 75% of the weight of the copper-based<br>
particles may be composed of the substantially crystalline copper compound. In another<br>
embodiment, essentially all of the weight of the copper-based particles is composed of<br>
substantially crystalline copper compound. The substantially crystalline copper compound<br>
may comprise, for example, at least or e of copper hydroxide (such as Cu(OH)2), a copper<br>
salt, and a copper oxide (such as CuO).<br>
[0019] Exemplary copper-based particles of the invention are sufficiently small to be<br>
present within wood without a substan.ial reduction in the original strength of the wood. For<br>
example, substantially all of the copper-based particles may be sized to occupy pores or<br>
vesicles of wood. In one embodiment, wood or a wood product may be impregnated with<br>
copper-based particles of the invention.<br>
[0020] Copper or copper-based particles present within wood or wood products is<br>
preferably less mobile than copper present in a liquid without copper-based particles of the<br>
invention. Preferably, the copper-based particles are sufficiently insoluble so as to not be<br>
easily removed by leaching but are sufficiently soluble to exhibit toxicity to primary<br>
organisms primarily responsible for the decay of the wood. Exemplary copper-based particles<br>
of the invention are sufficiently small to be present within wood without a substantial<br>
reduction in the original strength of the wood. For example, substantially all of the copper-<br>
based particles may be sized to occupy pores or vesicles of wood. In one embodiment,<br>
exemplary wood preservatives comprise copper-based particles having a size distribution in<br>
which at least 50% of particles have a diameter smaller than 0.25 µm, 0.2 µm, or 0.15 µrn. A<br>
preferred particle sizing technique is a sedimentation or centrifugation technique based on<br>
Stoke's Law.<br><br><br>
[0020A]	In view of what has been explained in the preceding paragraph [0020] the expression<br>
"sparingly soluble", used throughout the description and claims, means "sufficiently insoluble so as<br>
to not be easily removed by leaching, but, sufficiently soluble to exhibit toxicity to primary<br>
organisms responsible for the decay of wood".<br>
[0021]	Another embodiment of this invention is an effective, long-lasting, environmentally<br>
responsible, non-staining/coloring, inexpensive, less-corrosion-inducing, injectable, sparingly<br>
soluble copper salt-containing particulate preservative: treatment for wood and wood products<br><br>
that is substantially free of hazardous material. Generally, crystalline salts are preferred<br>
because they have lower rates of dissolution than do their amorphous analogs. However,<br>
amorphous salts are equally effective, and particulates made from amorphous salts can be<br>
treated with one or more coatings, or can be made of a particular size, such that the<br>
amorphous material may easily have release and leach characteristics like the substantially<br>
crystalline salts. Substantially crystalline salts should be considered a preferred variant of the<br>
invention, as the same disclosure is generally equally applicable to amorphous sparingly<br>
soluble copper salts, or substantially amorphous sparingly soluble copper salts. A "sparingly<br>
soluble salt" has, for example, a Ksp less than about 1 E-8, preferably between about 1 E-10<br>
to about 1 E-21.<br>
[0022] The copper-based particulates can comprise or consist essentially of any sparingly<br>
soluble substantially crystalline (or sparingly soluble amorphous) copper salts. In one<br>
embodiment the substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper salts in the<br>
copper-based particulates comprise or consist essentially of one or more copper salts selected<br>
from copper hydroxides; copper carbonates {e.g., "yellow" copper carbonate); basic (or<br>
"alkaline") copper carbonates; basic copper sulfates including particularly tribasic copper<br>
sulfate; basic copper nitrates; copper oxychlorides (basic copper chlorides); copper borates;<br>
basic copper borates; copper ferricyanate; copper fluorosilicate; copper thiocyanate; copper<br>
diphosphate or copper pyrophosphate copper cyanate; and mixtures thereof. In one<br>
embodiment, the copper-based particles comprise a substantially crystalline copper<br>
compound. At least about 20%, 30%. 50%, or 75% of the weight of the copper-based<br>
particles may be composed of the substantially crystalline copper compound(s).<br>
[0023] In a preferred embodiment the substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly<br>
soluble) copper salts in the copper-based particulates comprise or consist essentially of one or<br>
more copper salts selected from copper hydroxides; copper carbonates, basic (or "alkaline")<br>
copper carbonates; basic copper sulfa:es including particularly tribasic copper sulfate; basic<br>
copper nitrates; copper oxychlorides (basic copper chlorides); copper borates, basic copper<br>
borates, and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the copper-based particles comprise a<br>
substantially crystalline copper compound. At least about 20%, 30%, 50%, or 75% of the<br>
weight of the copper-based particles may be composed of the substantially crystalline copper<br>
compound.<br>
[0024] In another embodiment the substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly<br>
soluble) copper salts in the copper-based particulates in a wood preservative formulation can<br>
comprise or consist essentially of a p urality of sparingly soluble substantially crystalline (or<br><br>
amorphous sparingly soluble copper salts selected from copper oxide, copper hydroxides;<br>
copper carbonates, alkaline (or "basic") copper carbonates; alkaline copper sulfates; alkaline<br>
copper nitrates; copper oxychlorides; copper borates, basic copper borates, and mixtures<br>
thereof, with the proviso that at least one of the substantially crystalline (or amorphous<br>
sparingly soluble) copper salts is not a c opper oxide. Of the copper oxides, CU2O is preferred<br>
over CuO. In a variant of this, the copper-based particulate material can comprise or consist<br>
essentially of one or more sparingly soluble substantially crystalline copper salts selected<br>
from copper hydroxides; copper carbonates, alkaline (or "basic") copper carbonates; alkaline<br>
copper nitrates; alkaline copper sulfates, copper oxychlorides; copper borates, basic copper<br>
borates, and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the copper-based particles comprise a<br>
substantially crystalline copper compound. At least about 20%, 30%, 50%, or 75% of the<br>
weight of the copper-based particles may be composed of the substantially crystalline copper<br>
compound(s).<br>
[0025] In any of the above, the substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble)<br>
copper composition can have a substantial amount of one or more of magnesium, zinc, or<br>
both, wherein these cations are either dispersed within the substantially crystalline (or<br>
amorphous sparingly soluble) copper composition or a separate phase within a particulate. In<br>
preferred embodiments of the invention at least some particulates comprise copper<br>
hydroxide, basic copper carbonate, or both. In more preferred embodiments, the copper<br>
hydroxide comprises between 6 and 20 parts of magnesium per 100 parts of copper, for<br>
example between 9 and 15 parts of magnesium per 100 parts of copper. Alternatively, in<br>
another more preferred embodiments, the copper hydroxide comprises between 6 and 20<br>
parts total of magnesium and zinc per 100 parts of copper, for example between 9 and 15<br>
parts total of magnesium and zinc per 100 parts of copper. In some embodiments, the basic<br>
copper carbonate comprises between 6 and 20 parts of magnesium per 100 parts of copper,<br>
for example between 9 and 15 parts of magnesium per 100 parts of copper, or alternatively<br>
between 6 and 20 parts total of magnesium and zinc per 100 parts of copper, for example<br>
between 9 and 15 parts total of magnesium and zinc per 100 parts of copper. Alternatively or<br>
additionally, in a preferred embodiment, the copper hydroxide and/or basic copper carbonate<br>
comprises between about 0.01 and abou: 5 parts of phosphate per 100 parts of copper, for<br>
example between 9 and 15 parts of phosphate per 100 parts of copper.<br>
[0026] In another preferred embodimen, the slurry comprises sparingly soluble copper salt<br>
particulates and also comprises zinc borate particulates. Preferably, at least some of the<br>
sparingly soluble copper salt-based particulates comprise copper borate. It is known to use a<br><br>
two stage process where a zinc or copper salt is injected into the wood followed by a second<br>
step wherein the borax is injected and the insoluble metal borate is formed in situ. Such a<br>
complicated, time-consuming, and therefore expensive process in not sufficiently cost-<br>
effective. As the solubility of copper borate is very pH sensitive, in a preferred embodiment<br>
the sparingly soluble copper salts comprise an alkaline material, e.g., copper hydroxide or<br>
copper carbonate, to reduce the solubility of the copper borate. The zinc borate loading can<br>
range from 0.025% to 0.5%, for example, independent of the copper loading in the wood.<br>
[0027] In any of the above-described embodiments, the substantially crystalline copper<br>
composition in copper-based particulates and/or copper-based particulate material can further<br>
comprise one or more soluble substantially crystalline copper salts, for example copper<br>
sulfate, copper fluoroborate; copper fluoride, or mixtures thereof, where the soluble<br>
substantially crystalline copper salts phf.se is stabilized against dissolution.<br>
[0028] In any of the above-described embodiments, the substantially crystalline copper<br>
composition in copper-based particulates and/or copper-based particulate material can further<br>
comprise the substantially insoluble copper salt copper phosphate, Cu3(PO4)2. In any of the<br>
above-described embodiments, the copper composition in copper-based particulates and/or<br>
copper-based particulate material can further comprise the insoluble copper salt copper 8-<br>
quinolinolate. In any of the above-described embodiments, the composition can further<br>
comprise copper quinaldate, copper oxime, or both in particulate form. If there are copper-<br>
based-particulates substantially comprising Cu3(PO4)2 and/or copper oxide and/or copper 8-<br>
quinolinolate, the particulates should be exceedingly small, e.g., less than about 0.07 microns,<br>
preferably less than about 0.05 microns, to provide maximum surface area to help dissolution<br>
of the particles, and the wood treatment should contain another type of substantially<br>
crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper-based particulates, e.g., basic copper<br>
carbonate, basic copper borate, tribasic copper sulfate, copper hydroxides, and the like.<br>
[0029] The zinc analogs of the above are useful for the zinc-based particulates of the<br>
alternate embodiments of the invention. In one embodiment the copper-based particulate<br>
material can further comprise one or more of crystalline zinc salts selected from zinc<br>
hydroxide; zinc oxides; zinc carbonate; zinc oxychloride; zinc fluoroborate; zinc borate, zinc<br>
fluoride, or mixture thereof. The zinc salts may be in a separate salt phase, or may be mixed<br>
Cu/Zn salts, or combinations thereof. In preferred embodiments the particle comprises at<br>
least about 40%, preferably at least about 60%, and more preferably at least about 80% by<br>
weight of one or more substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper salts,<br>
crystalline zinc salts, or mixtures or combinations thereof.<br><br>
[0030] In one embodiment the copper-based particulate preservative treatment for wood can<br>
further comprise zinc-based particulates comprising one or more of crystalline zinc salts<br>
selected from zinc hydroxide; zinc oxides; zinc carbonate; zinc oxychloride; zinc<br>
fluoroborate; zinc borate, zinc fluoride, or mixture thereof. The preferred zinc-based<br>
substantially crystalline material are zinc hydroxide, zinc borate, zinc carbonate, or mixture<br>
thereof, which may be doped with other cations, e.g., from 0.1 to 10% copper, from 0.1 to<br>
10% magnesium, or both, for example, based on the total weight of the cations in the<br>
substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) material. In preferred<br>
embodiments the particle comprises at least about 40%, preferably at least about 60%, and<br>
more preferably at least about 80% by weight of one or more crystalline zinc salts.<br>
[0031] Preferred embodiments of the invention comprise particles comprising one or more<br>
of copper hydroxide, alkaline copper carbonate, alkaline copper oxychloride, tribasic copper<br>
sulfate, copper borate, or mixtures thereof. The most preferred embodiments of the invention<br>
comprise particles comprising copper hydroxide, alkaline copper carbonate, copper borate,<br>
alkaline copper borate, or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0032] Metal salt-based preservatives require added organic biocides to have the efficacy of<br>
the traditional CCA treatments. It is believed that certain organic biocides are very effective<br>
against most (but not all) undesired bio-organisms, and is also long-lasting. A principal<br>
function of the copper in such a system is to inhibit growth of those bio-organisms that<br>
degrade the organic biocides and/or that are resistant to the organic biocides. The most<br>
preferred embodiments of this invention have copper-based particulates and optionally one or<br>
more of zinc-based particulates and tin-based particulates, and further comprise between<br>
about 0.01% to about 20% by weight total of one or more organic biocides. In addition, in<br>
some embodiments, the particulates provide a carrier to carry the organic biocides into the<br>
wood and help ensure the biocide is well distributed throughout the wood. Preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention are an injectable copper-based particulate preservative<br>
treatment for wood that further comprises one or more injectable organic biocides attached to<br>
particulates.<br>
[0033] Other aspects of this invention include methods to prepare the copper-based<br>
particulates, methods of formulating the injectable wood treatment compositions that<br>
comprise the copper-based particulates and optionally one or more organic biocides, methods<br>
of transporting the injectable wood treatments, methods of mixing and injecting the copper-<br>
based particulate wood preservative composition, and also wood and wood products treated<br>
with the copper-based particulate preservative treatment compositions.<br><br>
[0034] We Believe our combination of manufacture, pretreatment, formulation and injection<br>
into wood of basic ("sparingly soluble") crystalline copper compounds injected as<br>
particulates represent a significant discovery. The slurries of this invention are essentially<br>
unaffected by the use of hard water in the application. The CMC material used in the prior<br>
art precipitates an objectionable residue of calcium and magnesium carbonates onto the<br>
surface of the wood. Injection of the present formulation uses the standard operating<br>
procedure that is commonly practiced in the industry. No changes are needed. The present<br>
formulation eliminates the nitrogen cor tent of the prior art products; and we believe the<br>
nitrogen is associated with the enhanced rate of sapstain growth which presently necessitates<br>
the use of expensive sapstain control agents. Removal of the fraction of particles having a<br>
diameter greater than 1 micron (1000 namometers), accomplished with a component of this<br>
technology, means the slurries are stable - slurry particles settle over the course of days or<br>
even weeks. This is a desirable application feature. The copper should be relatively non-<br>
leachable, being comparable with the rates associated with the CCA products. Due to lower<br>
leach rates, the product should be usable underground, near waterways, and also in marine<br>
applications. The cost per pound of copper is estimated to be between $0.20 to $0.50 less<br>
than present copper-MEA-carbonate products. We believe that corrosivity of the product will<br>
be less than that associated with the copper-MEA-carbonate products. Freight should be only<br>
one third that associated with the copper-MEA-carbonate products.<br>
[0035] Unless otherwise specified, all compositions are given in "percent", where the<br>
percent is the percent by weight based on the total weight of the entire component, e.g., of the<br>
particle, or to the injectable composition. In the event a composition is defined in "parts" of<br>
various components, this is parts by weight, wherein the total number of parts in the<br>
composition is between 90 and 110.<br>
[0036] Effective - By "effective" we mean the preservative treatment is sufficiently<br>
distributable through the wood product, and is sufficiently soluble and available so as to<br>
provide a bio-active concentration of copper ions in the wood matrix. By "bio-active" we<br>
mean the preservative treatment is sufficiently biocidal to one or more of fungus, mold,<br>
insects, and other undesired organisms which are normally the target of copper-containing<br>
wood preservatives such that these organisms avoid and/or can not thrive in the treated wood.<br>
It is known that copper arsenate (Cu3(AsO4)2) injected as a molecular layer is an effective<br>
biocide. Therefore, the particulate preservative treatment should provide a copper<br>
concentration roughly similar (for example, about the same to about two times as high) as<br>
that provided by the chromated copper arsenate (CCA) treatment. Too low a solubility, and<br><br>
the copper is not bioactive. At the same time, the injectable copper-based wood preservative<br>
treatment of this invention is intended to have one or more organic-based biocides<br>
incorporated therewith in amounts the same as are currently being used with soluble copper<br>
preservatives, and efficacy is based or, the combination of the copper (and/or zinc)<br>
component in combination with the organic biocides.<br>
[0037] Long-lasting - By "long-lasting" we mean the preservative treatment has an<br>
effective life of at least about the same as a traditional CCA-treated product, alternatively, the<br>
treatment lasts at least about 20 years under normal outdoor ground-contact use, for example.<br>
Too high a solubility of the particulate;, and the copper is leached out of the wood at too fast<br>
a rate. Such fast leaching creates environmental problems, i.e., the leached copper<br>
contaminates the environment, and also longevity problems, i.e., so much copper may be<br>
leached from the wood that the remaining treatment can no longer provide a bio-active<br>
concentration of copper ions.<br>
[0038] Leaching is a function of particle size and the solubility of the substantially<br>
crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper-containing material. Larger size<br>
particles have lower leach rates, while particles in a size range from 1 to 10 nanometers under<br>
certain circumstances will not have a leach rate much different than that of an injected copper<br>
salt solution. In preferred embodiments of this invention, at least 50% by weight of the<br>
copper-containing particulates have a size greater than 40 nanometers. In more preferred<br>
embodiments, at least 50% by weight of the copper-containing particulates have a size greater<br>
than 80 nanometers. In one preferred embodiment., at least 80% by weight of the copper-<br>
containing particulates have a size between 0.05 microns and 0.4 microns.<br>
[0039] Leaching is not the only mechanism whereby material can be flushed from wood.<br>
Because the material is in particulate form, there is a possibility that particulates will be<br>
flushed from the wood. Evidence suggests that very small substantially spherical<br>
nanoparticles, i.e., spherical particles of size 5 to 20 nanometers, can migrate freely through a<br>
wood matrix. United States Patent Application 20030077219 teaches a variant of the<br>
precipitation method of forming nanopanicles from micro-emulsions, the invention<br>
apparently relating to a block polymer used to stabilize the micro-emulsions. This<br>
publication claims that nanoparticles penetrate more: easily and more deeply into the wood<br>
layers under treatment due to their "quasi atomic size," thus eliminating or reducing the need<br>
for pressure impregnation. Immersion of wood into a copper hydroxide micro-emulsion<br>
showed the copper hydroxide penetrated to a depth of more than 10 to 298 mm. However,<br>
while said particles are easy to inject, they are also clearly easily transported through wood<br><br>
and would be easily flushed from the wood. These wood preservative treatments would not<br>
be long-lasting. Therefore, in preferred embodiments of the invention the material is<br>
substantially free of substantially spherical particulates, wherein the size of the spherical<br>
participates is less than about 20 nanoneters, particularly less than 15 nanometers.<br>
[0040] Generally, the leaching rate from dispersed particulates is controlled by 1) diffusion<br>
and boundary layer effects around the limited surface area available to water; 2) the<br>
activation energy needed to disrupt the crystal and to thereby cause dissolution, and 3) the<br>
absolute solubility of the material. Solubility is not an easy parameter to control; the<br>
solubility of copper itself in compositions containing hydroxyl groups and carbonates is about<br>
0.01 ppm at pH 10, 2 ppm at pH 7, but is 640 ppm at pH 4. Wood itself has a "pH" between<br>
4 and 5, but there is essentially no buffering capacity. Therefore, copper hydroxides are a<br>
component of the preferred substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper<br>
material, as the hydroxides will raise the pH of the water in the wood.<br>
[0041] Leaching will be discussed extensively infra. Advantageously, the particulates of the<br>
present invention provide at 240 hours into an AWPA El 1-97 leach test a total leached<br>
copper value that is within a factor of two above, to within a factor of five below, preferably<br>
within a factor of three below, the total leached copper value obtained by a wood sample<br>
treated with CCA and subjected to the same test.<br>
[0042] Substantially free of hazardous material - By "substantially free of hazardous<br>
material" we mean the preservative treatment is substantially free of materials such as lead,<br>
arsenic, chromium, and the like. By substantially free of lead we mean less than 0.1% by<br>
weight, preferably less than 0.01% by weight, more preferably less than 0.001% by weight,<br>
based on the dry weight of the wood preservative. By substantially free of arsenic we mean<br>
less than 5% by weight, preferably less than 1% by weight, more preferably less than 0.1%<br>
by weight, for example less than 0.01% by weight, based on the dry weight of the wood<br>
preservative. By substantially free of chromium we mean less than 0.5% by weight,<br>
preferably less than 0.1% by weight, more preferably less than 0.01% by weight, based on the<br>
dry weight of the wood preservative.<br>
[0043] Environmentally responsible - By "environmentally responsible" we mean the<br>
wood preservative (including co-biocide) has a bioactive effectiveness that is at least about<br>
one half that of CCA, preferably at least three quarters of that of CCA, for example, about<br>
equal to that of CCA, for specified organism based on the weight percent of the wood<br>
preservative material in the wood. If, for instance, the wood preservative has a bioactive<br>
effectiveness equal to that of CCA, then wood treated with a selected concentration of the<br><br>
wood preservative will have substantially similar bioactivity as wood treated with the same<br>
concentration of CCA.<br>
[0044] Additionally, the environmentally responsible material is substantially free of small<br>
nanoparticles which can be readily flushed from wood. Therefore, in preferred embodiments<br>
of the invention the environmentally responsible material is substantially free of substantially<br>
spherical particulates, wherein the size of the spherical particulates is less than about 20<br>
nanometers, particularly less than 5 nanometers. More preferably, in preferred embodiments<br>
of the invention the environmentally responsible material is substantially free of particulates<br>
having a size less than about 20 nanometers, particularly less than 5 nanometers.<br>
Nanoparticle-sized metal particulates may be toxic to certain aquatic life, though the data is<br>
very preliminary.<br>
[0045] Additionally, environmentally "esponsible wood preservatives are beneficially<br>
substantially free of organic solvents. By substantially free we mean the treatment comprises<br>
less than 10% organic solvents, preferably less than 5% organic solvents, more preferably<br>
less than 1% organic solvents, for example free of organic solvents, based on the weight of<br>
the copper in the wood preservative.<br>
[0046] Injectable — By "injectable" we mean the wood preservative particulates are able to<br>
be pressure-injected into wood, wood products, and the like to depths normally required in<br>
the industry, using equipment, pressures, exposure times, and procedures that are the same or<br>
that are substantially similar to those currently used in industry. Pressure treatment is a<br>
process performed in a closed cylinder that is pressurized, forcing the chemicals into the<br>
wood. Copper loading, also called copper retention is a measure of the amount of<br>
preservative that remains in the wood after the pressure is released. It is given as "pcf," or<br>
pounds of preservative per cubic foot of wood. Retention levels that must be reached are<br>
dependent on three variables: the type of wood used, the type of preservative used, and the<br>
use of the wood after treatment. The sparingly soluble copper-salt particulates of this<br>
invention are typically expected to be added to wood! in an amount equal to or less than 0.25<br>
pounds as copper per cubic foot. In preferred embodiments of the invention incising is not<br>
expected to be required to inject the slurries of the present invention into lumber having<br>
thicknesses of 6 to 10 inches.<br>
[0047] Injectability requires the particulars be substantially free of the size and<br>
morphology that will tend to accumulate and form a filter cake, generally on or near the<br>
surface of the wood, that results in undesirable accumulations on wood in one or more outer<br>
portions of the wood and a deficiency in an inner portion of the wood. Injectability is<br><br>
generally a function of the wood itself, as well as the particle size, particle morphology,<br>
particle concentration, and the particle size distribution.<br>
[0048] The requirements of injectability for substantially round, e.g., the diameter is one<br>
direction is within a factor of two of the diameter measured in a different direction, rigid<br>
particles generally are 1) that substantially all the: particles, e.g., greater than 98% by weight,<br>
have a particle size with diameter equal to or less than about 0.5 microns, preferably equal to<br>
or less than about 0.3 microns, for example equal to or less than about 0.2 microns, and 2)<br>
that substantially no particles, e.g., less than 0.5% by weight, have a diameter greater than<br>
about 1.5 microns, or an average diameter greater than about 1 micron, for example. We<br>
believe the first criteria primarily addresses the phenomena of bridging and subsequent<br>
plugging of pore throats, and the second criteria addresses the phenomena of forming a filter<br>
cake. Once a pore throat is partially ph.gged, complete plugging and undesired buildup<br>
generally quickly ensues.<br>
[0049] However, there are minimum preferred particulate diameters for the wood treatment,<br>
which depend somewhat on the copper salt(s) that are in the particulates. If the salts have a<br>
high solubility, very small particulates having a large surface to mass ratio will result in too<br>
high a copper ion concentration, and too fast a copper leaching, compared to preferred<br>
embodiments of this invention. Further, very small particulates, especially for example small<br>
spherical particles of diameter between about 0.003 to about 0.02 microns, are readily flushed<br>
from the wood. Generally, it is preferred that at legist 80% by weight of the particles be above<br>
0.01 microns in diameter, preferably greater than 0.03 microns, for example greater than 0.06<br>
microns in diameter.<br>
[0050] By injectable, unless otherwise specified, we mean injectable into normal southern<br>
pine lumber. This invention also encompasses injecting the particulates into other woods as<br>
well as into for example heartwood. Selected other woods and heartwood may require a<br>
smaller substantially lower criteria on particle dimensions for injectability, and such<br>
formulations can be made as discussed hsrein, but the formulation most of interest is a<br>
commercially operative formulation developed for normal Southern Pine. Such a<br>
formulationn will typically be useful for all other woods, with the possible exception of<br>
selected heartwood. Such problems with heartwood are normally not a substantial concern,<br>
as the injected particulate material may form a partial protective filter cake around heartwood<br>
that protects the heartwood without causing unsightly accumulations of preservative on the<br>
wood, and also heartwood is naturally substantially resistant to attack by many bioorganisms<br>
and therefore may require less copper to constitute sufficient protection.<br><br>
[0051] We have found three method to improve injectability and/or to maintain<br>
injectability of particulates. These methods improve particle size distribution and/or<br>
morphology by wet milling, and chemically and physically stabilize the participates by<br>
coating the participates with selected materials.<br>
[0052] Non-staining/Non-coloring - By "non-staining/non-coloring" we mean the wood<br>
preservative does not impart undesired color to the wood. Large participates, or large<br>
agglomerations of smaller participates, impose a visible and undesired color to the treated<br>
wood, which is generally bluish or greenish. Surprisingly, coloring is usually indicative of<br>
poor injectability. Individual particles of diameter less than about 1 micron, preferably less<br>
than 0.5 microns, that are widely dispersed in a matrix do not color a wood product to any<br>
substantial degree. Filter cake forms unsightly coloring. An aggregation of particles, similar<br>
to filter-cake, could contribute un-wanted color. Preferably 100% by weight of the particles<br>
have an average diameter of less than 1 micron, where an average diameter is the diameter<br>
measured by Stokes law settling (which may be assisted by centrifugation), or by preferably<br>
by dynamic light (X-ray) scattering or by Doppler light scattering. Even particulates having a<br>
size greater than 0.5 microns can impart very visible color, and agglomerates of similar size<br>
have the same effect as do large particles In a preferred embodiment of the invention, at<br>
least about 95%, e.g., at least about 99% by weight of the particulates/aggregates are smaller<br>
than 0.5 microns in average diameter. More preferably, at least about 95%, e.g., at least<br>
about 99% by weight of the particulates/aggregates are smaller than 0.35 microns in average<br>
diameter. Even more preferably, at least about 95%, e.g., at least about 99% by weight of the<br>
particulates/agreggates are smaller than 0.3 microns in average diameter. Generally, it is<br>
preferred that at least 90% by weight of the particles be above 0.01 microns in diameter,<br>
preferably greater than 0.03 microns, for example greater than 0.06 microns. Certain<br>
compounds, particularly basic copper carbonate, copper hydroxide, and copper oxychloride<br>
are preferred because they impart less color than do other particles of comparable size.<br>
Additionally, the presence of a zinc salt, a magnesium salt, or both either as a separate phase<br>
or as a mixed phase may also reduce color.<br>
[0053] Inexpensive - By "inexpensive" we mean the wood preservative is prepared using<br>
techniques so that the cost of the wood treatment is competitive with, for example, copper-<br>
ethanolamine-complex treatments and other commonly used treatments. As the cost of<br>
copper is substantially constant regardless of the source, inexpensive relates primarily to the<br>
costs of manufacture, separation, sizing, an I preservation of the particulate material. There<br>
are many techniques to create very small nanoparticles, but most of these processes are far<br><br>
too costly to be useful in the mass procuction of a copper-based wood preservative treatment.<br>
Generally, the term "inexpensive" means at a processed cost less than or equal to the current<br>
costs of the soluble copper-co-biocide treatments, alternately within about 20% of the cost of<br>
prior art CCA treatments.<br>
[0054] The preferred method of production is a precipitation process, in the absence of<br>
organic solvents and the like. Preferably the reactants are of standard industrial quality, as<br>
opposed to higher levels of purity. The particles start with certain characteristics including<br>
size distribution and morphology, e.g., at least 2% by weight of the particles have a diameter<br>
greater than 1 micron, usually greater than 1.5 microns, and generally must undergo<br>
subsequent treatment, e.g., milling, to make sure the particle size and particle size distribution<br>
are favorable for injection. Particles made by other processes, particularly emulsion<br>
precipitation processes and fuming processes, are not sufficiently cost effective to<br>
manufacture commercially acceptable copper particulates for wood preservation.<br>
[0055] It is known that nanoparticles can be formed for example by micro-emulsion (or<br>
micelle) precipitation, and the like. The micelle system, where emulsions of small and<br>
uniformly sized micelles are used as nanoreactors in which the deposition of the metal salt is<br>
carried out, are known in the art. For example, it is; known to make nickel and nickel/copper<br>
(7/3) carbonate particles via water in oil hexane/hexanol) microemulsions. Two separate<br>
microemulsions with the metal salt and ammonium bicarbonate, respectively, were prepared<br>
and mixed rapidly to form metal carbonate nanopaiticles of 6 to 7 nm diameter with a small<br>
diameter distribution. Such processes, while useful in forming very small particulates, are<br>
not useful in forming commercially acceptable wood preservative. The associated costs of<br>
adding and removing the solvents used to form the emulsions makes these processes<br>
economically un-usable for the purpose of forming a copper-containing injectable particulate<br>
wood preservation material.<br>
[0056] It is known that nanoparticles can be formed for example by forming fumed copper<br>
salts via a vapor process or an aerosol oxdiation process. The authors of Copper and Copper<br>
Oxide Nanoparticle Formation by Chemical Vapor Nucleation From Copper (II)<br>
Acetylacetonate by Albert G. Nasibulin, P. Petri Ahonen, Olivier Richard, Esko I describe<br>
methods of forming e.g., 2 nm to 20 nm in diameter nanoparticles. Generally, fuming<br>
processes are limited to producing the oxides of copper, as these authors produced. Again,<br>
the cost of obtaining such small size (and narrow particle distribution) is not justified by any<br>
increase in efficacy of the particles for most copper salts of this invention.<br><br>
[0057] The cost of polymeric nanoparticles to act as a carrier for the copper salts is similarly<br>
not justifiable.<br>
[0058] Less-Corrosion-Inducing — The commercial soluble copper containing wood<br>
preservatives often result in increased metal corrosion, for example of nails within the wood.<br>
Preserved wood products are often used in load-bearing out-door structures such as decks.<br>
Traditional fastening material, including aluminum and standard galvanized fittings, are not<br>
suitable for use with wood treated with these new preservatives. Many regions are now<br>
specifying that hardware, e.g., fittings, nails, screws, and fasteners, be either galvanized with<br>
1.85 ounces zinc per square foot (a G-185 coating) or require Type 304 stainless steel.<br>
Generally, the presence of any salt will nduce corrosion. By "less-corrosion-inducing" we<br>
mean the wood preservative has a reduced tendency, compared to a similar concentration of<br>
copper obtained from the soluble copper treatments such as the amine-copper-complex<br>
treatments and alkanolamine-copper-complex treatments in use today, to corrode metal that<br>
contacts the wood. The degree of corrosion will depend in large part on the salts selected, as<br>
well as on adjuvants, in particular amines.<br>
[0059] We believe that the amines present in the treatments used in soluble copper<br>
treatments - alkanolamines, ammonia, and the like — are corrosive to metals. We also believe<br>
that another problem with the new soluble complexed copper preservatives is that they are, or<br>
they eventually turn into, biodegradable material that can encourage certain biological<br>
attacks, particularly mildew. The commonly used soluble copper compounds provide<br>
nitrogen-containing nutrients (amines) which are believed to act as food-stuff and causes an<br>
increase in the presence of sapstain molds, therefore requiring additional biocides effective<br>
on sapstain molds to be added to protect the external appearance of the wood. When there is<br>
also bio-available carbon sources, in addition to bio-available nitrogen, the problem is made<br>
worse. Advantageously, the wood preservative is substantially free of any amines other than<br>
certain selected amines that may be used as a supplemental biocide. By substantially free we<br>
mean the treatment comprises less than 10% amines, preferably less than 5% amines, more<br>
preferably less than 1% amines, for example free of amines, based on the weight of the<br>
copper in the wood preservative. Alternatively, the term means there is less than one amine<br>
molecule or moiety per four copper atoms, preferably less than one amine molecule or moiety<br>
per ten copper atoms. Again, amines that ars used as supplemental biocides, if any, are<br>
excluded from this limitation. While basic copper nitrate is a useful sparingly soluble copper<br>
salt for use in this invention, in most embodiments of the invention the wood preservative is<br>
also substantially free of nitrates.<br><br>
[0060] In other embodiments of the invention an injectable copper-based particulate<br>
preservative treatment for wood that is substantially free of bio-available nitrogen, and even<br>
more preferably substantially free of bio-available nitrogen and bio-available carbon is<br>
provided. By substantially free of bio-available nitrogen we mean the treatment comprises<br>
less than 10% of nitrates and organic nitrogen, preferably less than 5% of nitrates and organic<br>
nitrogen, more preferably less than 1% of nitrates and organic nitrogen, for example less than<br>
0.1% of nitrates and organic nitrogen, tased on the weight of the copper in the wood<br>
preservative. In most of the soluble or complexed copper treatments, there are between 1 and<br>
4 atoms of organic nitrogen that act as a complexer or carrier for one atom of copper. In the<br>
preferred embodiments of this invention, there is less than 0.3 atoms, preferably less than 0.1<br>
atoms, for example less than 0.05 atoms of organic nitrogen per atom of copper in the wood<br>
preservative treatment. Again, organic nitrogen-containing compounds that are used<br>
specifically as supplemental biocides an excluded from this limitation. By substantially free<br>
of bio-available carbon we mean the treatment comprises less than 30% of bio-available<br>
organic material (defined as material tha: is degradable or that will during the lifespan of the<br>
treatment will become degradable), preferably less than 10% of bio-available organic<br>
material, more preferably less than 1% of bio-available organic material, based on the weight<br>
of the copper in the wood preservative. Again, organic compounds that are used as<br>
supplemental biocides, if any, are excluded from this limitation. It is believed that the<br>
presence of bio-available organic carbon may encourage the growth of certain molds.<br>
[0061] In one embodiment, the copper-based particles are substantially free of polymers,<br>
such as organic polymers. For example, copper-based particles of the invention may be<br>
substantially free of one or more of polyvinylpyridine, polymetbacrylate, polystyrene,<br>
polyvinylpyridine/styrene copolymers, polyesters, polyethylene, polypropylene,<br>
polyvinylchloride, blends of the above homopolymers with acrylic acid and the like. By<br>
substantially free, it is meant that the copper-based particles are less than about 50% by<br>
weight polymer. The copper-based particles may be less than about 35% by weight polymer,<br>
for example, less than 25% by weight polymer, such as less than 15% by weight polymer. In<br>
one embodiment, the copper-based particles are essentially free of polymer, by which it is<br>
meant the copper-based particles comprise less than about 5% by weight polymer. In one<br>
embodiment, the copper-based particles comprise less than about 2.5% by weight polymer.<br>
In one embodiment, the copper-based particles are free of polymer.<br>
[0062] In one embodiment of the invention, the copper-based particles may comprise a<br>
polymer. In this embodiment, the ratio of the weight of copper present in the particles to<br><br>
polymer present in the particles may be at least about 1 to 1, for example at least about 2 to 1,<br>
4 to 1, 5 to 1, 7 to 1, or at least about 0 to 1. For example, if ratio of the weight of copper<br>
present in the particles to the weight of polymer present in the particles is at least about 2 to<br>
1, the particles comprise at least about twice as much copper by weight as polymer.<br>
[0063] Substantially crystalline - By "substantially crystalline" we mean, for example,<br>
greater than about 30%, preferably greater than about 50%, by weight of the material of<br>
interest (copper salt, zinc salt, and the like) is crystalline. A material is substantially<br>
crystalline if the material gives the distinctive X-ray diffraction patterns of the crystalline<br>
entity (relating to d spacing, not present in the amorphous material). A convenient technique<br>
for assessing the crystallinity relative to the crystallinity of known crystalline salts is the<br>
comparison of the relative intensities of the peaks of their respective X-ray powder<br>
diffraction patterns. The degree of crystallinity can be determined by, for example,<br>
determining the sum of the X-ray diffraction peak heights (for the same sample size), in terms<br>
of arbitrary units above background, and comparing the summed peak heights of the<br>
substantially crystalline material in, for example, the copper-based particulates with the<br>
corresponding peak heights of the known crystalline material. This procedure utilizes, for<br>
example, only the strongest 4 peaks. Whan, for example, the numerical sum of the peak<br>
heights of the material in a particulate is 50 percent of the value of the sum of the peak<br>
heights of the same known crystalline copper salt, then the product is 30 percent crystalline<br>
and is substantially crystalline. The preferred method for determining crystallinity is by<br>
calorimetry, by measuring the heat of dissolution of the sample in a solvent and comparing<br>
this heat with the measured heats of amorphous and crystalline standard of the same salt,<br>
provided the dissolution of the crystalline salt is substantially different than the dissolution of<br>
the corresponding amorphous salt.<br>
[0064] As crystallinity is difficult to measure, the following exemplary compounds meet the<br>
requirements for substantially crystalline copper compounds: copper(II) borate; copper<br>
boride (Cu3B2); yellow copper(I) carbonate; basic copper carbonate; copper(II) carbonate<br>
dihydroxide (CuCO3 x Cu(OH)2); copper(II) carbonate dihydroxide (2CuCO3 x Cu(OH)2);<br>
copper (I and II) chloride; copper(II) chloride x 2H2O; copper oxychloride (CuCl2 x Cu(OH)2<br>
); copper(I and II) cyanide; copper(I and II fluoride; copper(H) formate; copper(I and II)<br>
oxide; copper phosphate x 3 water; copper([ and II) sulfate; tribasic copper sulfate; and<br>
copper(I) thiocyanate. The term (I and II) means the copper(I) salt and the copper(II) salt.<br>
These salts are considered substantially crystalline with as much as 20% by weight based on<br>
the weight of the copper being substituted with magnesium, zinc, or both. The following<br><br>
exemplary compounds meet the requirements for substantially crystalline zinc compounds:<br>
zinc carbonate; zinc chloride; zinc cyanide; zinc diphosphate; zinc fluoride; zinc fluoride x 4<br>
water; zinc hydroxide; zinc oxide; zinc phosphate; and zinc sulfate. These salts are typically<br>
substantially crystalline with as much is 20% by weight based on the weight of the zinc being<br>
substituted with magnesium, copper, 01 both. The following exemplary compounds meet the<br>
requirements for substantially crystalline tin compounds: tin(II) chloride; tin(II) chloride x 2<br>
water; tin(II and IV) oxide; tin(II) diphosphate (pyrophosphate); tin(II) phosphate<br>
(Sn3(PO4)2); and tin(II) sulfate.<br>
[0065] In preferred embodiments, at least about 20%, 30%, 50%, or 75% of the weight of<br>
the copper-based particles may be composed of the substantially crystalline (or amorphous<br>
sparingly soluble) copper compound. The substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly<br>
soluble) copper compound may comprise, and in preferred embodiments does comprise, one<br>
or more cations in addition to copper, for example, magnesium and/or zinc. In another<br>
embodiment, essentially all of the weight of the copper-based particles is composed of<br>
substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper compound.<br>
[0066] Several of the copper salts described herein are available in crystalline and in<br>
amorphous phases. Generally crystallinity is preferred, as the lattice energy of the crystal is<br>
expected to slow down dissolution. However, amorphous copper salts are useful in the<br>
invention, and for the less soluble salts the amorphous phases may be preferred over<br>
crystalline phases. Phosphate-stabilized copper hydroxide, a preferred sparingly soluble<br>
copper salt used in embodiments of this invention, is: typically substantially amorphous. One<br>
embodiment of this invention is an effective, long-lasting, environmentally responsible, non-<br>
staining/coloring, inexpensive, non-corros on-inducing, injectable, amorphous or<br>
substantially amorphous copper-based, zinc-based, or tin-based particulate preservative<br>
treatment for wood and wood products that is substantially free of hazardous material.<br>
Amorphous sparingly soluble salts are equally effective, and they can be treated with one or<br>
more coatings, or can be made of a particular size, or of more insoluble salts, such that the<br>
amorphous material may easily have release and leach characteristics like the substantially<br>
crystalline salts. Substantially crystalline sparingly soluble salts should be considered a<br>
preferred variant of the invention, as the same disclosure is generally equally applicable to<br>
amorphous material, or substantially amorphous material.<br>
[0067] Copper-Based Particulate -- As used herein, the term "copper-based particulate"<br>
means a particle having a size between about 0.7 microns and about 0.01 microns that<br>
comprises at least one substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper salt.<br><br>
The term particle is used interchangably with the term "paniculate," while the term<br>
"nanoparticle" refers to particles having a size less than about 0.01 microns in diameter. The<br>
term "copper" includes, unless specifically stated otherwise, the cuprous ion, the cupric ion,<br>
or mixtures thereof, or combinations thereof. The term "copper-based" means the particle<br>
comprises at least about 20%, 30%, 50%, or 75% by weight of one or more substantially<br>
crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper compounds. In another embodiment,<br>
essentially all (e.g., more than 95%) of the weight of the copper-based particles is composed<br>
of substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper compound.<br>
[0068] Zinc-Based Particulate - As used herein, the term "zinc-based particulate" means a<br>
particle having a size between about 0.5 microns and about 0.01 microns that comprises at<br>
least one substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper salt. The term<br>
"particle" is used interchangably with the term "particulate." The term "zinc-based" means<br>
the particle comprises at least about 20%, 30%, 50%, or 75% by weight of one or more<br>
substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) zinc compounds. In another<br>
embodiment, essentially all (e.g., more than 95%) of the weight of the zinc-based particles is<br>
composed of one or more substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) zinc<br>
compounds. The preferred substantially crystalline zinc-containing materials are zinc<br>
hydroxide, zinc borate (Zn(BO2)2xH2O), and zinc carbonate. As for the copper-based<br>
particles and the tin-based particles, if the borate is used as the anion, preferably the<br>
composition also comprises one or more salts of carbonate or hydroxide (or hydroxide-<br>
containing) salts to maintain a slightly elevated pH within the wood matrix, to slow<br>
dissolution of the borate salts. If zinc-based particulates are used, they are advantageously<br>
used with copper-based particulates.<br>
[0069] Tin-based particulate - As used herein, the term "tin-based particulate" means a<br>
particle having a size between about 0.5 microns and about 0.01 microns that comprises at<br>
least one substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) tin salt. The term<br>
"particle" is used interchangably with the term "particulate." The term "tin-based" means the<br>
particle comprises at least about 20%, 30%, 50%, or 75% by weight of one or more<br>
substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) tin compounds. In another<br>
embodiment, essentially all (e.g., more than 95%) of the weight of the tin-based particles is<br>
composed of one or more substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) tin<br>
compounds. Generally, tin-based particulates are not preferred because tin does not have the<br>
desired bio-activity. Tin oxides are believed to be particularly inert, though Nanophase<br>
Technologies in February 2004 claimed, in "Nanoteehnology in brief available on<br><br>
www.nanotechweb.org/articles/news/3/2/12/1, making pilot quantities of 30 nm silver-doped<br>
nanocrystalline tin oxide for use in wood preservatives, speciality paints, polymer additives,<br>
conductive coatings, and electronic materials. The: preferred substantially crystalline tin<br>
material are tin hydroxides, Sn(OH)2 and Sn(OH)4. If tin-based particulates are used, they<br>
are advantageously used with copper-ba ;ed particulates.<br>
[0070] It is recognized that some embodiments encompassed by this invention may not<br>
meet all of the objects or characteristics of the preferred embodiments of the invention as<br>
described above. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the injectable material will meet<br>
any and preferably most of the criteria listed above for the effective, long-lasting,<br>
environmentally responsible, non-staining/coloring, inexpensive, non-corrosion-inducing,<br>
injectable, substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble), copper-based<br>
particulate preservative treatment for wood and wood products that is substantially free of<br>
hazardous material.<br>
[0071] In preferred embodiments of the invention, the injectable copper-based particulates<br>
will meet any and preferably most of the criteria listed above for the effective, long-lasting,<br>
environmentally responsible, non-staining/coloring, inexpensive, less-corrosion-inducing,<br>
injectable, substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble), copper-based<br>
particulate preservative treatment for wood and wood products that is substantially free of<br>
hazardous material.<br>
The substantially crystalline copper composition in the copper-based particulates.<br>
[0072] The copper-based particulates can have a substantially homogenous substantially<br>
crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper composition within each particle.<br>
Alternatively, the particles can comprise two or more separate substantially crystalline (or<br>
amorphous sparingly soluble) copper phases. Preferred particles comprise at least 30%,<br>
preferably at least 50%, more preferably at least 70%, for example between about 80% and<br>
about 98% by weight of total of copper hydroxides, copper oxides, basic copper carbonates,<br>
copper carbonates, copper oxychloride, tribasic copper sulfate, alkaline copper nitrate, copper<br>
borate, or mixtures thereof. Most comprise a basic copper salt, with the exception of copper<br>
borate and copper oxides. As a high pH suppresses the solubility of copper borate,<br>
advantageously, treatments that comprise particulates of copper borate also comprise a basic<br>
substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper-containing salts. Copper<br>
carbonate is a most preferred compound, is it is less: visible than some other salts, and has<br>
excellent solubility characteristics.<br><br>
[0073] In another embodiment of the invention, the various particles within a wood<br>
preservative can comprise different substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble)<br>
copper compositions. For example, a treatment may contain particles that comprise<br>
crystalline copper borate, other particle:, that comprise alkaline copper carbonate, and even<br>
other particles that comprise copper oxide. The particles having different phases may in<br>
preferred embodiments be of different sizes, porosity, or morphology, depending on the<br>
crystalline copper material present.<br>
[0074] In one embodiment, exemplary wood preservatives comprise copper-based salt<br>
particles having a size distribution in which at least 50% of particles have a diameter smaller<br>
than 0.5 µm, 0.25 µm, 0.2 µm, or 0.15 µm. A preferred particle sizing technique is a<br>
sedimentation or centrifugation technique based on Stoke's Law. An exemplary preservative<br>
of the invention comprises particles comprising a sparingly soluble copper salt, e.g., copper<br>
hydroxide, having an average particle diameter of less than about 500 nanometers, for<br>
example less than about 250 nanometers, or less than about 200 nanometers. In one<br>
embodiment, the average particle diameter is at least 25 nanometers, for example, at least 50<br>
nanometers.<br>
[0075] Method Of Manufacture of Substantially Crystalline Copper-Containing Particles<br>
[0076] Exemplary copper-based particles comprise one or more of copper metal, a copper<br>
oxide, a copper hydroxide, copper carbonate, and a copper salt that is sparingly soluble.<br>
Preferred wood preservatives comprise copper-based particles that comprise at least about<br>
20%, for example, at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, or 75% by weight copper, based on the<br>
weight of the particle. An exemplary copper-based particle comprises about twice as much<br>
copper by weight as oxygen.<br>
[0077] There are a large number of references describing how to make copper-containing<br>
"nanoparticles." These references generally can not be used to manufacture the particulates<br>
at the desired cost. The formation of 7 nanometer particles of any of CuO, Cu2O, or mixed<br>
phase CuO/Cu2O is described for example in "Copper and Copper Oxide Nanoparticle<br>
Formation by Chemical Vapor Nucleation From Copper(II) Acetacetonate" was described in<br>
Journal of Nanoparticle Research, 3(5-6): 383-398, December 2001. Such particles are, or<br>
course, readily injectable into wood, and if injected they may provide a degree of biological<br>
activity. But they can not be used for the process because such particles are too expensive for<br>
use in wood treatment. R.L. Hamilton and O.K. Cosser described using 35 nm CuO or 10 nm<br>
Cu metal particles to enhance thermal conductivity of antifreeze in "Thermal Conductivity of<br>
Heterogenous Two-Component Systems" Ind. &amp; Engr. Chem. Fund., 1, 187-191 (1962).<br><br>
Such particles would also be expected to be injectable into wood. United States Patent<br>
Application 20030077219 describes a method for producing copper salts from at least one<br>
cupriferous reactant and one additional reactant, where micro-emulsions are prepared from<br>
two reactants while employing at least one block polymer to obtain intermediate products<br>
with a particle size of less than 50 nm, preferably 5 to 20 nm. Material can be adjusted to<br>
specific applications through the appropriate doping of foreign ions. This application teaches<br>
wood treatment applications, stating copper compounds that have been produced pursuant to<br>
the present invention can penetrate more easily and more deeply into the wood layers under<br>
treatment due to their quasi atomic size. These improved properties can eliminate or reduce<br>
the need for pressure impregnation while: ensuring prolonged protection against various<br>
organisms. Agglomerates characterized by a size of about 200 nanometers consist of a<br>
multitude of primary particles characterized by a size range of 5 to 20 nm. Example particle<br>
sizes were between 10 and 50 nm and agglomerate sizes between 100 and 300 nm. During<br>
the immersion of equivalent wood into the copper hydroxide micro-emulsion prepared<br>
pursuant to the invention, the copper hydroxide was not limited to the surface, but instead<br>
penetrated to a depth of more than 10 to 298 mm. The use of solvents makes such processes<br>
generally too expensive for use in wood preservatives, though this process can be useful<br>
provided the solvent serves a subsequent purpose of solvating one or more organic biocides,<br>
to partially bind the organic biocides to the particulate by partially or completely removing<br>
the solvent by evaporation. Modifying the process of this application to make particulates<br>
greater than 50 nanometers in diameter, for example between about 100 and about 200<br>
nanometers in diameter, can be useful provided the solvent serves a subsequent purpose of<br>
solvating one or more organic biocides, to partially bind the organic biocides to the<br>
particulate by partially or completely removing the solvent by evaporation.<br>
[0078] The method of U.S. Patent 6,596,246 which requires rigorous removal of iron to make<br>
a copper hydroxide can be utilized. Such a process increases the cost of the product,<br>
however.<br>
[0079] In one embodiment of the invention, copper-based particles are prepared, such as by<br>
precipitation, from a mixture comprising copper and an amine. The copper and amine may<br>
be present in the form of a copper-amine complex. The mixture may comprise at least one of<br>
copper monoethanolamine, copper diethanolamine, copper-ammonia, and/or copper<br>
ethylenediamine. The copper-amine complex is usually in an aqueous solution. Preferred<br>
precipitates comprise copper hydroxides. The particles may be prepared by modifying a pH<br>
of the mixture comprising copper and the imine. For example, the pH of a mixture<br><br>
comprising copper and an amine may be reduced to value sufficient to precipitate copper-<br>
based particles. In any event, the mixture comprising copper and the amine may be diluted<br>
with water to have a copper concentration of at least about 0.25, for example, at least about<br>
0.5, such as at least about 1% by weight. The copper concentration may be less than about<br>
2%, for example, less than about 1.5%. The pH of the mixture comprising copper and the<br>
amine, such as the diluted mixture, may be reduced using acid to prepare a precipitate<br>
comprising copper-based particles. The particles may comprise copper hydroxide. A<br>
dispersant may be added to the mixture, such as before obtaining the precipitate, upon<br>
obtaining the precipitate, or thereafter. A stable aqueous copper-amine complex solution<br>
may have a pH of 8 to 13. One method for preparing the precipitate comprises adjusting the<br>
pH of an aqueous mixture of the copper-amine complexes. In one embodiment, the pH is<br>
adjusted so that the pH is at least about 4, for example, at least about 5.5. The pH of the<br>
mixture may be adjusted to less than about 8, for example, to less than about 7.5, such as less<br>
than about 7. The pH may be adjusted to about 7. The pH is adjusted by adding an acid to<br>
the mixture. Alternatively, the pH may be adjusted by adding the mixture to acid. The<br>
solution of copper-amine complex may be prepared in the presence of acid. Suitable acids<br>
for adjusting the pH include, for example sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, formic<br>
acid, boric acid, acetic acid, carbonic acid, sulfamic acid, phosphoric acid, phosphorous acid,<br>
and/or propionic acid. The anion of the acid used may be partially incorporated in the<br>
precipitated salt.<br>
[0080] One embodiment of a method for preparing copper-based particles comprises<br>
precipitation of copper-based particles from a solution comprising (a) copper, such as in the<br>
form of a copper salt, and (b) a pH modifying agent, such as a hydroxide. Exemplary<br>
hydroxides may be selected from hydroxides of group 1a and/or group 2a elements, such as<br>
sodium and potassium hydroxide.<br>
[0081] Copper salts useful in preparing copper-based particles of the invention preferably<br>
comprise water soluble salts of copper and another material. An exemplary copper salt may<br>
include at least one of a copper sulfate, a halogen-containing copper salt, such as copper<br>
chloride or copper bromide, a copper nitrate, a copper acetate, a copper formate, and a copper<br>
propionate. The one or more copper salts may be provided in the form of a solution, such as<br>
an aqueous solution, of a liquid and the copper salt.<br>
[0082] U.S. Patent 4,808,406, the disclos are of which is incorporated by reference, describes<br>
a useful method for producing finely divided stable cupric hydroxide compositions of low<br>
bulk density comprising contacting solutions of an alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate and<br><br>
a copper salt, precipitating a basic copper carbonate-basic copper sulfate to a minimum pH in<br>
the range of greater than 5 to about 6, contacting the precipitate with an alkali metal<br>
hydroxide and converting basic copper sulfate to cupric hydroxide. Another method of<br>
manufacturing the copper compounds is the method described in U.S. Patent 4,404,169, the<br>
disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. This patent describes a process of<br>
producing cupric hydroxides having stability in storage if phosphate ions are added to a<br>
suspension of copper oxychloride in an aqueous phase. The copper oxychloride is then<br>
reacted with alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, and the cupric<br>
hydroxide precipitated as a result of the suspension is washed and then re-suspended and<br>
subsequently stabilized by the addition of acid phosphate to adjust a pH value of 7.5 to 9.<br>
The suspended copper oxychloride is preferably reacted in the presence of phosphate ions in<br>
an amount of 1 to 4 grams per liter of the suspension and at a temperature of 20° to 25° C. and<br>
the resulting cupric hydroxide is stabilized with phosphate ions.<br>
[0083] There are numerous methods of preparing very small particles of copper salts, and<br>
the above list is exemplary and not complete. The simplest and by far the least expensive<br>
method of producing small particles is a standard precipitation of admixing two solutions,<br>
one containing soluble copper and one containing the desired anion, and some particles<br>
resulting from slightly modified precipitation processes are of a size that may be injected into<br>
the wood. The most useful modification is simply adding small quantities of anion to a<br>
concentrated solution of the cation, or vice versa, with vigorous stirring. Examples in the<br>
prior art show an average particle size as low as 0.3 microns was obtainable. Such processes<br>
are also desirable because the cost of counter-ions (those ions that form the salts that are<br>
admixed, but that are not incorporated into the substantially crystalline (or amorphous<br>
sparingly soluble) copper material) is negligible. Standard materials such as chlorides,<br>
sulfates, ammonia, and the like are common counterions. Further, the material need not be<br>
ultra-pure. Indeed, it is desirable to have one or more "contaminants" in the precipitating<br>
solutions. Smaller diameters are obtained when the concentration of impurities such as Mg,<br>
Ca, Zn, Na, Al and Fe in the suspension is high. Fe present in the suspension acts especially<br>
strongly to prevent formation of large-diameter cuprous hydroxide particles. Fe<br>
concentration is preferably greater than 70 ppm to obtain smaller particles.<br>
[0084] In one embodiment, copper and a hydroxide are combined to prepare a precipitate<br>
comprising copper. The copper and hydroxide may be combined with the copper in the form<br>
of a copper salt. For example, a solution comprising at least one copper salt and a solution<br>
comprising at least one hydroxide may be combined to precipitate copper-based particles. In<br><br>
One embodment, the method includes precipitating copper-based particles from a solution<br>
comprising at least one other metal, such as a salt of at least one other metal. For example,<br>
copper-based particles of the invention ;nay be precipitated from a solution comprising at<br>
least one of one or more group 2a metal; such as magnesium or salts thereof. The metal or<br>
salt of the metal may be zinc. In one embodiment, (a) a solution comprising a copper salt and<br>
at least one other metal, which may be in the form of one or more salts, and (b) a solution<br>
comprising a hydroxide are combined in amounts sufficient to precipitate copper-based<br>
particles, such as particles comprising copper hydroxide.<br>
[0085] In one embodiment, particles are prepared by adding a copper salt solution to a<br>
hydroxide solution comprising about 20% hydroxide by weight. The copper salt solution is<br>
added until a desired amount of copper-based particles are obtained. For example, the copper<br>
salt solution may be added until the pH of the hydroxide solution falls to at least about 11.5,<br>
11,10.5, or about 10. The precipitate comprising the precipitated copper-based particles may<br>
be used directly to protect wood or wood products, but are beneficially milled to reduce the<br>
fraction of particulates having a diameter above 1 micron.<br>
[0086] Copper hydroxide is not particularly stable. Hydroxides can be changed to oxides<br>
by for example, a quick and exothermic reaction by exposure of the copper hydroxide<br>
particles to aqueous solution of glucose. Copper hydroxide may react with air, sugars, or<br>
other compounds to partially or completely form copper oxide. While this is generally of less<br>
concern with foliar fungicides, the conditions for conversion are highly favored during kiln-<br>
drying treated wood, which contains gluconuronic acids, which are sugar-like molecules, and<br>
heat and a dehydrating condition, create a high probability of such transformation occurring<br>
within the wood.<br>
[0087] However, as taught by U.S Patent 3,231,464, the disclosure of which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference thereto, the presence of magnesium or magnesium and zinc can help<br>
stabilize cupric hydroxide from converting to copper oxide via the loss of a water molecule.<br>
The preferred copper hydroxide particles used in this; invention are stabilized. U.S. Patent<br>
3,231,464 teaches stabilizing the copper hydroxide with added magnesium zinc, or both, at a<br>
Gr.Mg and/or Cu:Zn weight ratio of 8:1. Copper hydroxide prepared in a manner so as to<br>
contain significant magnesium and/or zinc hydroxides are more stable and resistant to<br>
degradation to copper oxides. The preferred copper hydroxide particles comprise between<br>
50% and 90% copper hydroxide, with the remainder comprising zinc hydroxide, magnesium<br>
hydroxide, or both. The process described in U.S. Patent 3,231,464 is inexpensive, and with<br><br>
modifications produces particulates with a particle size distribution with a median particle<br>
size of a few tenths of a micron.<br>
[0088] While such methods can provide small particles of selected substantially crystalline<br>
(or amorphous sparingly soluble) salts, these processes usually have a small fraction of<br>
particles that are unacceptably large. Get erally, however, a few particles from a normal<br>
precipitation process are too big to be injectable. A very small fraction of particles having a<br>
particle size above about 1 micron causes, in injection tests on wood specimens, severely<br>
impaired injectability. Large particles, e.g., greater than about 1 micron in diameter, should<br>
be removed. Removal via filtering is not effective, as a large fraction of injectable particles<br>
will be caught on filters designed to remove the bigger particles. We have surprisingly found<br>
that milling, for example wet-milling, can advantageously modify particle size and<br>
morphology. Particles can be smoothed and large particles removed by continuous-process<br>
centrifuging. Alternately, as described above, we have surprisingly found that substantially<br>
crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper-based particulates that are manufactured<br>
by a precipitation process, using conditions known in the art to produce small particles, can<br>
be readily milled into an injectable material by wet milling with a milling material such as 0.5<br>
mm diameter zirconium silicate in a matter of minutes.<br>
[0089] In another embodiment, the copper-based particulates can have a substantial amount,<br>
e.g., at least 0.5% by weight, for example at least 2% by weight, but less than 50% by weight<br>
based on the weight of copper of one or more other cations, either dispersed within the<br>
substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper composition or substantially<br>
as a separate phase within the particulate In a preferred embodiment, the copper-based<br>
particulates can have a substantial amount of one or more of magnesium, zinc, or both,<br>
wherein these cations are either dispersed within the substantially crystalline (or amorphous<br>
sparingly soluble) copper composition or be a separate phase within a particulate. The<br>
weight ratio of copper to zinc may range between 99.9:0.1 to 1:1, but is preferably between<br>
99.5:0.5 to 90:10, for example between 99:1 and 94:6. The weight ratio of copper to<br>
magnesium may range between 99.9:0.1 to 1:1, but is preferably between 99.5:0.5 to 85:15,<br>
for example between 95:5 and 90:10.<br>
[0090] In one embodiment of the invention, copper-based particles are precipitated from a<br>
mixture of a copper salt solution and a hydroxide (and optionally other anions) in the<br>
presence of at least one group 2a metal or salt thereof, such as magnesium or a magnesium<br>
salt. In one embodiment, the copper-based particles are precipitated from a mixture<br>
comprising at least about 0.05 parts magaesium, for example at least about 0.1 parts<br><br>
magnesium per 9 parts copper. The mixture may comprise at least about 0.25 parts<br>
magnesium per 9 parts copper. The mixture may comprise less than about 1.5 parts<br>
magnesium, for example, less than about 1.0 parts, or less than about 0.75 parts magnesium<br>
per 9 parts copper.<br>
[0091] Copper-based particles prepared in accordance with the present invention will<br>
comprise a group 2a metal or zinc if such materials; (metal ions) were used in preparation 05<br>
the particles. In another embodiment, the copper-based particles are precipitated from a<br>
mixture comprising at least about 0.2 parts magnesium, for example, at least about 0.25 parts<br>
magnesium per 22.5 parts copper. The mixture may comprise at least about 0.5 parts<br>
magnesium per 22.5 parts copper. The mixture may comprise less than about 3.5 parts<br>
magnesium, for example, less than about 2.5 parts magnesium, or less than about 2 parts<br>
magnesium per 22.5 parts copper. The parts here merely reflect weight ratios of the cation;<br>
in the solution to be precipitated, and the parts do not imply concentration.<br>
[0092] Alternatively, or in combination with the group 2a metal or salt thereof, the copper-<br>
based particles may be precipitated from a solution comprising zinc metal or salt thereof. ]<br>
example, the mixture may comprise at least about 0.1 parts zinc, for example, at least abou<br>
0.25 parts zinc, at least about 1.0 parts zinc, or at least about 2.0 parts zinc per 22.5 parts<br>
copper. The mixture may comprise less than about 3.0 parts zinc, for example, less than<br>
about 2.5 parts zinc, or less than about 1.5 parts zinc; per 22.5 parts copper. Preferably, the<br>
mixture additionally comprises at least about 0.25 parts magnesium, for example, at least<br>
about 0.5 parts magnesium, at least about 1.0 parts magnesium, or at least about 2 parts<br>
magnesium per 22.5 parts copper. The mixture may comprise less than about 5.0 parts<br>
magnesium, for example, less than about 2.5 parts magnesium, or less than about 2 parts<br>
magnesium per 22.5 parts copper. Table 1 sets forth exemplary ratios of zinc, magnesium<br>
and copper in accordance with the present invention,<br>
TABLE I Exemplary Formulations To Precipitate Mg/Zn-Stabilized Copper<br>
Hydroxide<br><br>

2	0.75	0.75	22.5<br>

4	2.5	1.0	22.5<br>

[0093] Such mixtures can be used to precipitate copper hydroxides, basic copper carbonate,<br>
copper oxychloride, copper borate, and any of the substantially crystalline (or amorphous<br>
sparingly soluble) salts described herein.<br>
[0094] In alternative embodiments, the particulates can comprise particles that contain a<br>
substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper composition with between<br>
0.001% and 3%, preferably 0.005% to 0 5%, for example 0.01% to 0.1% by weight of silver,<br>
based on the weight of copper, and also optionally the other cations. Silver is expensive but<br>
is efficacious against some bio-oganisms in very small amounts, and therefore silver is a<br>
useful co-cation in a substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper-based<br>
particulate. A wood treatment containing 0.25 pounds copper per cubic foot would comprise,<br>
at a 0.04% silver loading relative to copper, less than 0.2 ounces of silver per one hundred<br>
cubic feet of wood. Generally, if silver is incorporated into the substantially crystalline (or<br>
amorphous sparingly soluble) copper phase, the substantially crystalline (or amorphous<br>
sparingly soluble) copper phase is preferably a copper(I) salt and the silver ions are disposed<br>
homogenously through the substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper<br>
phase, to prevent the minute quantities oi silver from being prematurely leached from the<br>
wood.<br>
[0095] Yet another embodiment of the invention is an effective, long-lasting,<br>
environmentally responsible, non-staining/coloring. inexpensive, non-corrosion-inducing,<br>
injectable, substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble), zinc-based particulate<br>
preservative treatment for wood and wood products that is substantially free of hazardous<br>
material This composition can be used independently of the copper-based particulates, but<br>
in preferred embodiments is used in combination with one or more copper-based particulates.<br>
Modification of the above processes to produce substantially crystalline (or amorphous<br>
sparingly soluble) zinc-containing particulates is within the ability of one of ordinary skill in<br>
the art, and such modifications will not be. described here.<br>
[0096] Similarly, modifications of the above processes to produce substantially crystalline<br>
(or amorphous sparingly soluble) zinc-containing particulates are within the ability of one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art, and such modifications will not be described here.<br>
[0097] Milling - Generally, the simple, inexpensive copper salt precipitation processes<br>
provide particles with a size too great for injection. Even for processes that provide very<br>
small median diameter particles, such as, a few tenths of a micron in diameter, the<br>
precipitation process seems to result in a ;mall fraction of particles that are larger than about<br>
1 micron, and these particles plug up pores and prevent acceptable injectability. The size<br><br>
distribution of the injectable particles must have the vast majority of particles, for example at<br>
least 95% by weight, preferably at least 99% by weight, more preferably at least 99.5% by<br>
weight, be of an average diameter less than about 1 micron, and advantageously the particles<br>
are not rod-shaped with a single long dimension. Average particle diameter is beneficially<br>
determined by Stokes Law to a size down to about 0.2 microns. Smaller sizes are<br>
beneficially determined by, for example, a dynamic light scattering method or laser scattering<br>
method or electron microscopy. Generally, such a particle size and particle size distribution<br>
can be achieved by mechanical attrition of particles.<br>
[0098] Attrition can be obtained for example 1) by use of a pressure homogenizer such as<br>
that manufactured by SMT Ltd. having 400 kg/cm2 of pressure at a flow rate of 1 1/min.,<br>
though such a system often requires the slurry be processed overnight; by processing in an<br>
ultrasonic homogenizer such as is manufactured by Nissei Ltd., though such a method is<br>
energy intensive; by wet milling in a sand grinder charged with for example partially<br>
stabilized zirconia beads with diameter 0 5 mm; alternately wet milling in a rotary sand<br>
grinder with partially stabilized zirconia beads with diameter 0.5 mm and with stirring at for<br>
example 1000 rpm; or by use of a wet-ball mill, an attritor (e.g., manufactured by Mitsui<br>
Mining Ltd.), a perl mill (e.g., manufactured by Asliizawa Ltd.,), or the like. Attrition can be<br>
achieved to a lesser degree by centrifugatton, but larger particles can be simply removed from<br>
the composition via centrifugation. Removing the larger particulates from a composition can<br>
provide an injectable formulation. Said particulates can be removed by centrifugation, where<br>
settling velocity substantially follows Stores law. While this process provides injectable<br>
slurries, a fraction of the copper-containing particulates that are separated thereby include<br>
both large particles as well as a portion of the injectable particles, and generally this material<br>
would be recycled by being dissolved and precipitated. Such a process adds an additional<br>
cost to forming the injectable copper-containing particulate wood treatment.<br>
[0099] The most effective method of modifying the particle size distribution is wet milling.<br>
Beneficially all injectable formulations for wood treatment should be wet-milled, even when<br>
the "mean particle size" is well within the range considered to be "injectable" into wood.<br>
Traditional precipitation techniques are known to produce particles with a median particle<br>
size between about 0.2 and 6 microns, depending on the salts used as well as on various<br>
reaction conditions. For example, a commercially available copper-based particulate product,<br>
a magnesium stabilized form of copper hydroxide (available from Phibro-Tech., Inc.) has a<br>
mean particle size of about 200 nm. However, when this material was slurried and injected<br>
into wood, there was unacceptable plugging on the face of the wood. Careful examination<br><br>
found by Phibro-Tech., Inc. resulted in a few weight percent of<br>
particles with a size over 1 micron, and this small amount of material was hypothesized to<br>
form the start of the plug (where smaller, normally injectable particles were subsequently<br>
caught by the plug). Wet milling with 2 mm zirconium silicate media had no effect - wet<br>
milling for days resulted in only a marginal decrease in particle size, and the material was<br>
still not injectable in commercial quantities.<br>
[0100] However, we surprisingly found that a milling process using 0.5 mm high density<br>
zirconium silicate grinding media provides further efficient attrition, especially for the<br>
removal of particles greater than about 1 micron in the commercially available copper-based<br>
particulate product available from Phibro-Tech., Inc. The milling process usually takes on<br>
the order of minutes to achieve almost complete removal of particles greater than 1 micron in<br>
size. This wet milling process is inexpensive, and all of the precipitate can be used in the<br>
injectable copper-containing particulate wood treatment. The selection of the milling agents<br>
is not critical, and can be zirconia, partially stabilized zirconia, zirconium silicate, and<br>
yttrium/zirconium oxide, for example, recognizing that the more dense materials give faster<br>
particle size attrition. The size of the milling material is believed to be important, even<br>
critical, to obtaining a commercially acceptable process. The milling agent material having a<br>
diameter of 2 mm or greater are ineffective, while milling agent material having a diameter of<br>
0.5 mm is effective typically after 15 minutes of milling. We believe the milling agent is<br>
advantageously of a diameter less than 1.5 mm, preferably is less than 1 mm in diameter, for<br>
example between about 0.1 mm and about 1 mm, or alternately between about 0.3 mm and<br>
0.7 mm.<br>
[0101] The original focus on injeciability focused on the magnesium stabilized copper<br>
hydroxide product available from Phibro-Tech., Inc., as this material started (and ended) with<br>
a material that had a median diameter of 0 2 microns.. While we originally believed that the<br>
milling broke aggregates, possibly fused aggregates, of smaller particles that formed the<br>
"greater than about 1 micron fraction" of the above-described product, the milling process<br>
was surprisingly equally effective on larger mean diameter particles.<br>
[0102] We have surprisingly found that topper-based particulates that are manufactured by<br>
a straightforward precipitation process, using conditions known in the art to produce small<br>
particles, e.g., particles having a size less than 10 microns, can be readily milled into an<br>
injectable material. Therefore, milling other precipitate material with 0.5 mm diameter<br>
zirconium silicate (or any comparable product, e.g., a 0.1 mm to 1 mm sized zirconium<br>
silicate or zirconium oxide) can mill in a matter of minutes a substantially crystalline (or<br><br>
amorphous sparingly soluble) powder material having a larger initial average size into a<br>
product that can be readily injected into wood. Milling with 0,5 mm zirconium silicate media<br>
not only quickly reduced further the magnesium stabilized copper hydroxide product, but this<br>
grinding medium was also found to be effective on other forms of basic copper compounds<br>
such as other stabilized copper hydroxides, copper carbonate, tribasic copper sulfate, copper<br>
oxychloride, and copper oxides. The results of milling of a variety of materials with the 0.5<br>
mm milling material described above for 15 minutes are shown in Table 2. Copper<br>
hydroxide material with an initial median size of 2.5 microns was quickly milled to an<br>
injectable material having a median particle size of 0.3 microns. Additional milling time<br>
would doubtless further reduce the median and average particle size. A copper carbonate<br>
material having a median size of 3.4 microns was milled to a material having a median size of<br>
less than 0.2 microns. Figure 2 of the accompanying drawings shows the face of wood injected with unmilled product and<br>
the face of wood injected with the milled product. In the color photographs the plugging is<br>
especially visible. A tribasic copper sulfate material having a median size of 6.2 microns was<br>
milled to a material having a median size of less than 0.2 microns. A copper oxychloride<br>
material having a median size of 3.3 microns was milled to a material having a median size of<br>
0.4 microns.<br>
[0103] Milling is believed to break up larger particles. It would also break particles having<br>
one large dimension, e.g., rod-like particles, which are know to have injection problems.<br>
Milling can be combined with, for example, centrifugation to create a more uniform product.<br>
Alternatively, milling can be combined with a coating process to form a more stable material.<br>
[0104] Specific substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper-<br>
containing materials and other copper-containing materials useful in embodiments of this<br>
invention will be described below. In each instance, the zinc analog is useful for zinc-based<br>
particulates. Generally, the tin analogs ( an also be useful for tin-based particulates.<br>
[0105] Copper Oxides - In one embediment, the substantially crystalline copper<br>
composition in a plurality of copper-based particulates can comprise one or more copper<br>
oxides. Of the copper oxides, Cu2O is preferred over CuO, as the Cu2O is subject to<br>
oxidation by oxygen dissolved in water which appears to increase the kinetics of dissolution.<br>
If the copper-based particulate material consists essentially of one or more copper oxides,<br>
however, the material will not be sufficiently bioactive. In one variant, the copper oxide<br>
material can have a substantial amount of one or more of magnesium, zinc, or both, wherein<br>
these cations are either dispersed within the substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly<br>
soluble) copper composition or be a separate phase within a paniculate. Generally,<br><br>
magnesium and zinc co-cations can help stabilize copper hydroxide and prevent its natural<br>
transition to copper oxide. We believe if substantial amounts of zinc and especially<br>
magnesium are included in the crystalline copper oxide material, it will partially disrupt the<br>
crystal and therefore encourage solubility. Copper oxides are less preferred than other<br>
substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper compounds, because the<br>
rate of dissolution is so slow. If the crystalline copper in the particles is more than 60%<br>
copper oxide, then preferably the particles have a maximum size of about 50 nanometers, or<br>
have a BET surface area of at least 300 m2/gm, or both. The particulates may need special<br>
treatments and/or properties to provide a bio-active copper concentration, and are more easily<br>
flushed from the wood.<br>
[0106] In any of the below-described embodiments, the substantially crystalline (or<br>
amorphous sparingly soluble) copper composition in copper-based particulates and/or<br>
copper-based particulate material can furtuer comprise one or more copper oxides. Of the<br>
copper oxides, CuO is preferred over Cu2O.<br>
[0107] Copper hydroxides — In a preferred embodiment the substantially crystalline (or<br>
amorphous sparingly soluble) copper composition in a plurality of copper-based particulates<br>
can comprise or consist essentially of copper hydroxides. In a variant of this, the copper-<br>
based particulate material can comprise or consist essentially of copper hydroxides. Of the<br>
copper hydroxides, copper hydroxide including CuOH (usually not stable) and/or Cu(OH)2<br>
can be used, though Cu(OH)2 is preferred over CuOH. In a preferred embodiment of any of<br>
the above, the substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper composition<br>
can have a substantial amount of one or more of magnesium, zinc, or both, wherein these<br>
cations are either dispersed within the substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly<br>
soluble) copper composition or be a separate phase within a particulate.<br>
[0108] Basic Copper Carbonate - In another preferred embodiment the substantially<br>
crystalline copper composition in a plurality of copper-based particulates can comprise or<br>
consist essentially of alkaline (or "basic") copper carbonates. While various compositions<br>
comprising copper hydroxide and copper carbonate are envisioned, typically alkaline copper<br>
carbonate is[CuCO3 x Cu(OH)2]. In a variant of this, the copper-based particulate material<br>
can comprise or consist essentially of alkaline copper carbonate. In a preferred embodiment<br>
of any of the above, the substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper<br>
composition can have a substantial amount of one or more of magnesium, zinc, or both,<br>
wherein these cations are either dispersed within the substantially crystalline (or amorphous<br>
sparingly soluble) copper composition or be a separate phase within a particulate.<br><br>
[0109] Copper Carbonate - In another embodiment the substantially crystalline copper<br>
composition in a plurality of copper-based particulates can comprise or consist essentially of<br>
copper carbonate, e.g., CUCO3. In a variant of this;, the copper-based participate material can<br>
comprise or consist essentially of alkaline copper carbonate. In a preferred embodiment of<br>
any of the above, the substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper<br>
composition can have a substantial amount of one or more of magnesium, zinc, or both,<br>
wherein these cations are either dispersed within the substantially crystalline (or amorphous<br>
sparingly soluble) copper composition or be a separate phase within a particulate. Copper<br>
carbonate is less preferred than basic copper carbonate, as the OH groups in the latter help<br>
keep the pH elevated, thereby reducing copper mobility.<br>
[0110] Tribasic Copper Sulfates — In another preferred embodiment the substantially<br>
crystalline copper composition in a plurality of copper-based particulates can comprise or<br>
consist essentially of basic copper sulfates. In a variant of this, the copper-based particulate<br>
material can comprise or consist essentially of basic copper sulfates. While various<br>
compositions comprising copper hydroxide and copper sulfate are envisioned, typically<br>
alkaline copper sulfate is [CuSO4 x 3Cu(OH)2]. If tribasic copper sulfate is used, the<br>
substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper composition can<br>
additionally advantageously have a substantial amount of one or more of magnesium, zinc, or<br>
both, wherein these cations are either dispersed within the substantially crystalline (or<br>
amorphous sparingly soluble) copper composition or be a separate phase within a particulate.<br>
[0111] Alkaline Copper Nitrates - In another embodiment the substantially crystalline<br>
copper composition in a plurality of copper-based particulates can comprise or consist<br>
essentially of alkaline copper nitrates. In a variant of this, the copper-based particulate<br>
material can comprise or consist essentially of alkaline copper nitrates. While various<br>
compositions comprising copper hydroxide and copper nitrate are envisioned, typically<br>
alkaline copper nitrate is [CU(NO3)2 x 3Cu(OH)2]. If alkaline copper nitrate is used, the<br>
substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper composition can<br>
additionally advantageously have a substantial amount of one or more of magnesium, zinc, or<br>
both, wherein these cations are either dispersed within the substantially crystalline (or<br>
amorphous sparingly soluble) copper composition or be a separate phase within a particulate.<br>
In the most preferred embodiments of this invention, the wood preservative is substantially<br>
free of copper nitrates, as the nitrogen, may during the degradation process, eventually act as<br>
foodstuff for one or more bio-organisms.<br><br>
[0112] Copper Oxychlorides - another preferred embodiment the substantially<br>
crystalline copper composition in a plurality of copper-based particulates can comprise or<br>
consist essentially of copper oxychlorides. In a variant of this, the copper-based particulate<br>
material can comprise or consist essentially of copper oxychlorides. While various<br>
compositions comprising copper hydroxide and copper chloride ate envisioned, typically<br>
copper oxychloride is [CuCl2 x 3Cu(OH)3]. In a preferred embodiment of any of the above,<br>
the substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper composition can have a<br>
substantial amount of one or more of magnesium, zinc, or both, wherein these cations are<br>
either dispersed within the substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper<br>
composition or be a separate phase within a particulate.<br>
[0113] Copper Borate - In another preferred embodiment the substantially crystalline<br>
copper composition in a plurality of copper-based particulates can comprise or consist<br>
essentially of copper borate. Copper borate includes basic copper borate. In a variant of this,<br>
substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper composition can have a<br>
substantial amount of one or more of magnesium, .zinc, or both, wherein these cations are<br>
either dispersed within the substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper<br>
composition or be a separate phase within a particulate. Generally, the copper borate is<br>
advantageously included in a composition that also comprises copper hydroxide or one or<br>
more of the basic copper anion salts, to help moderate pH and reduce solubility of the copper<br>
borate.<br>
[01141 Copper ferricyanate - In any of the above-described embodiments, the<br>
substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper composition in copper-<br>
based particulates and/or copper-based particulate material can further comprise copper<br>
ferricyanate. This embodiment includes less preferably copper ferricyanide. Alternatively,<br>
the substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper composition in the<br>
copper-based particulates can comprise or consist essentially of copper ferricyanate,<br>
Cu2[Fe(CN)6]. In another embodiment, the copper-based particulate material can comprise or<br>
consist essentially of copper ferricyanate.<br>
[0115] Copper Fluorosilicate - The substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly<br>
soluble) copper composition in copper-based particulates and/or copper-based particulate<br>
material can comprise copper fluorosilicate. Alternatively, the substantially crystalline (or<br>
amorphous sparingly soluble) copper composition in the copper-based particulates can<br>
comprise or consist essentially of copper fluorosilicate. In another embodiment, the copper-<br>
based particulate material can comprise or consist essentially of copper fluorosilicate.<br><br>
[0116] Copper Thiocyanate - of the above-described embodiments, the<br>
substantially crystalline copper composition in copper-based participates and/or copper-based<br>
particulate material can further comprise copper thiocyanate, though it is generally difficult to<br>
manufacture crystalline copper thiocyanate. Alternatively, the copper composition in the<br>
copper-based particulates can comprise or consist essentially of CuSCN. In another<br>
embodiment, the copper-based particulate material can comprise or consist essentially of<br>
CuSCN.<br>
[0117] Copper diphosphate or Copper pyrophosphate -- In any of the above-described<br>
embodiments, the substantially crystalline copper composition in copper-based particulates<br>
and/or copper-based particulate material can further comprise copper pyrophosphate,<br>
CU2P2O7. Alternatively, the substantially crystalline; (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper<br>
composition in the copper-based particulates can comprise or consist essentially of copper<br>
pyrophosphate. In another embodiment, the copper-based particulate material can comprise<br>
or consist essentially of copper pyrophosphate.<br>
[0118] Copper Cyanate and/or Copper C yanate - Copper cyanide, Cu(CN)2, and copper<br>
cyanate, Cu(CNO)2, are each a sparingly soluble copper salt, but they are too dangerous to be<br>
useful for copper-based wood preservative treatments. When even a small quantity of copper<br>
cyanate and/or copper cyanide is used, the formulation must be basic, that is, contained in an<br>
alkaline formulation.<br>
[0119] The copper-based particulates can comprise or consist essentially of any of the<br>
above listed sparingly soluble copper compounds. In another preferred embodiment the<br>
substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper composition in the copper-<br>
based particulates in a wood preservative formulation can comprise or consist essentially of a<br>
plurality of sparingly soluble substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble)<br>
copper salts selected from copper oxide, copper hydroxides; copper carbonates, alkaline (or<br>
"basic") copper carbonates; alkaline copper sulfates; alkaline copper nitrates; copper<br>
oxychlorides; copper borates, and mixtures thereof, with the proviso that at least one of the<br>
substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper salts is not a copper oxide.<br>
In a variant of this, the copper-based particulate material can comprise or consist essentially<br>
of one or more sparingly soluble substantially crystalline copper salts selected from copper<br>
hydroxides; copper carbonates, alkaline (or "basic") copper carbonates; alkaline copper<br>
nitrates; alkaline copper sulfates; copper oxychlorides; copper borates, and mixtures theieof.<br>
In any of the above, the substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper<br>
composition can have a substantial amount of one or more of magnesium, zinc, or both,<br><br>
wherein these cations are either dispersed dispersed within the substantially crystalline (or amorphous<br>
sparingly soluble) copper composition or be a separate phase within a participate.<br>
[0120] In preferred embodiments of the invention, at least some particulates comprise<br>
copper hydroxide, basic copper carbonate, or both. In more preferred embodiments, the<br>
copper hydroxide comprises between 6 and 20 parts of magnesium per 100 parts of copper,<br>
for example between 9 and 15 parts of magnesium per 100 parts of copper. Alternatively, in<br>
another more preferred embodiments, the copper hydroxide comprises between 6 and 20<br>
parts total of magnesium and zinc per 100 parts of copper, for example between 9 and 15<br>
parts total of magnesium and zinc per 100 parts of copper. In some embodiments, the basic<br>
copper carbonate comprises between 6 and 20 parts; of magnesium per 100 parts of copper,<br>
for example between 9 and 15 parts of magnesium per 100 parts of copper, or alternatively<br>
between 6 and 20 parts total of magnesium and zinc per 100 parts of copper, for example<br>
between 9 and 15 parts total of magnesium and zinc per 100 parts of copper. Alternatively or<br>
additionally, in a preferred embodiment, t he copper hydroxide and/or basic copper carbonate<br>
comprises between about 0.01 and about 5 parts of phosphate per 100 parts of copper, for<br>
example between 9 and 15 parts of phosphate per 100 parts of copper.<br>
[0121] In another preferred embodiment, slurry comprises a sparingly soluble copper salt<br>
particuiates and also comprises zinc borate particulates. Preferably at least some of the<br>
sparingly soluble copper salt-based particulates comprise copper borate. It is known to use a<br>
two stage process where a zinc or copper salt is injected into the wood followed by a second<br>
step wherein the borax is injected and the insoluble metal borate is formed in situ. Such a<br>
complicated, time-consuming, and therefore expensive process is not sufficiently cost-<br>
effective. As the solubility of copper borate is very pH sensitive, in a preferred embodiment<br>
the sparingly soluble copper salts comprise an alkaline material, e.g., copper hydroxide or<br>
copper carbonate, to reduce the solubility of the copper borate.<br>
[0122] Soluble Substantially Crystalline Copper Salts -- In any of the above-described<br>
embodiments, the substantially crystalline copper composition in copper-based particulates<br>
and/or copper-based particulars material can further comprise one or more soluble<br>
substantially crystalline copper salts, for example copper sulfate, copper fluoroborate; copper<br>
fluoride, or mixtures thereof, where the soluble substantially crystalline copper salts phase is<br>
stabilized against dissolution. Alternatively, the substantially crystalline copper composition<br>
in the copper-based particulates can comprise or consist essentially of one or more soluble<br>
substantially crystalline copper salts, for example, copper fluoroborate; copper sulfate, copper<br>
fluoride, or mixtures thereof, where the soluble substantially crystalline copper salts phase is<br><br>
stabilized against dissolution. Such protection may be provided by encasing the soluble<br>
copper salts in a shell or a matrix of sparingly soluble copper salts or in insoluble copper<br>
salts, such as copper phosphate.<br>
[0123] In another embodiment, the copper-based particles may be essentially free of<br>
halogen, which means that the weight percent of halogen in the particles is less than about<br>
2.5%. Preferably, the weight percent of halogen in copper-based particles that are essentially<br>
free of halogen is less than about 1%. The copper-based particles may be free of halogen.<br>
[0124] Copper Phosphate - In any of the above-described embodiments, the substantially<br>
crystalline copper composition in copper -based particulates and/or copper-based participate<br>
material can further comprise the substantially insoluble copper salt copper phosphate,<br>
Cu3(PO4)2. Alternatively, the substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble)<br>
copper composition in the copper-based particulates can comprise or consist essentially of<br>
Cu3(PO4)2. Generally, in preferred embodiments, if CU3(PO4)2 is present it is a coating over<br>
other sparingly soluble copper salts, whersin the Cu3(PO4)2 provides a fairly inert coating for<br>
a period of time before it dissolves or partially dissolves. If there are copper-based-<br>
particulates substantially comprising Cu3(PO4)2 and/or copper oxide, the particulates should<br>
be exceedingly small, e.g., less than about 0.05 microns, preferably less than about 0.04<br>
microns, to provide maximum surface area to help dissolution of the particles, and the wood<br>
treatment should contain another type of substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly<br>
soluble) copper-based particulates, e.g., basic copper carbonate, copper borate, tribasic<br>
copper sulfate, copper hydroxides, and the like.<br>
[0125] Copper 8-Quinolinolate -- In any of the above-described embodiments, the copper<br>
composition in copper-based particulates a id/or copper-based participate material can further<br>
comprise the insoluble copper salt copper 8-quinolinolate. Alternatively, the copper<br>
composition in the copper-based participates can comprise or consist essentially of copper 8-<br>
quinolinolate. Generally, in preferred embodiments, if copper 8-quinolinolate is present it is<br>
a coating over other sparingly soluble copper salts, wherein the copper 8-quinolinolate<br>
provides a fairly inert coating for a period cf time before it dissolves or partially dissolves. If<br>
there are copper-based-particulates substantially comprising copper 8-quinolinolate, the<br>
particulates should be exceedingly small, e.g., less than about 0.01 microns, preferably less<br>
than about 0.005 microns, to provide maximum surface area to help dissolution of the<br>
particles.<br>
[0126] In any of the above-described embodiments, the composition can further comprise<br>
copper quinaldate, copper oxime, or both in particular form.<br><br>
[0127] In one embodiment, the copper-based particles comprise a substantially crystalline<br>
copper compound. At least about 20%. 30%, 50%, or 75% of the weight of the copper-based<br>
particles may be composed of the substantially crystalline copper compound. In another<br>
embodiment, essentially ai] (e.g., more than 90%, for example more than 95%) of the weight<br>
of the copper-based particles is composed of substantially crystalline copper compound. In<br>
preferred embodiments the particle comprises at least about 20%, preferably at least about<br>
30%, and more preferably at least about 50%, for example at least about 75% by weight of<br>
one or more sparingly soluble copper salts. In another embodiment, essentially all (e.g., more<br>
than 90%, for example more than 95%) of the weight of the copper-based particles is<br>
composed of substantially crystalline copper compound(s).<br>
[0128] In one embodiment of the invention, the copper-based particles are substantially free<br>
of at least one of the halogens, for example, at least one of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and<br>
iodine. Preferably, the weight percent of the at least one halogen in particles that are<br>
substantially free of the at least one halogen is less than about 25%, for example, less than<br>
about 20%, 15%, 10%, or 5%.<br>
[01291 In one embodiment, the copper-based panicles are essentially free of at least one of<br>
the halogens, for example at least one of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Particles<br>
that are essentially free of at least one halogen have less than about 2.5% of the at least one<br>
halogen. Preferred particles have less than about 1% of the at least one halogen. In one<br>
embodiment, the copper based particles are free of at least one of the halogens.<br>
[0130] In another embodiment, the copper-based particles may be substantially free of<br>
halogen. Preferably, the weight percent of halogen in copper-based particles that are<br>
substantially free of halogen is less than about 25%, for example, less than about 20%, 15%,<br>
10%, or 5%.<br>
10131] Again, the zinc analogs of the above are useful for the zinc-based particulates of the<br>
alternate embodiments of the invention. In one embodiment the copper-based particulate<br>
material can further comprise one or more of crystalline zinc salts selected from zinc<br>
hydroxide; zinc oxides; zinc carbonate; zinc oxychloride; zinc fluoroborate; zinc borate, zinc<br>
fluoride, or mixtures thereof. The zinc salts may be in a separate salt phase, or may be mixed<br>
Cu/Zn salts, or combinations thereof. In preferred embodiments the particle comprises at<br>
least about 40%, preferably at least abou: 60%, and more preferably at least about 80% by<br>
weight of one or more substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper salts,<br>
crystalline zinc salts, or mixtures or combinations thereof.<br><br>
[0132] In one embodiment the copper-base-d particulate preservative treatment for wood can<br>
farther comprise zinc-based particulaies comprising one or more of crystalline zinc salts<br>
selected from zinc hydroxide; zinc ox des; zinc carbonate; zinc oxychloride; zinc<br>
fluoroborate; zinc borate, zinc fluoride, or mixtures thereof. The preferred zinc-based<br>
substantially crystalline material are zinc hydroxide, zinc borate, zinc carbonate, or mixture<br>
thereof, which may be doped with other cations, e.g., from 0.1 to 10% copper, from 0.1 to<br>
10% magnesium, or both, for example, based on the total weight of the cations in the<br>
substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) material. In preferred<br>
embodiments the particle comprises at least about. 40%, preferably at least about 60%, and<br>
more preferably at least about 80% by weight of one or more crystalline zinc salts.<br>
[0133] Preferred embodiments of the nvention comprise particles comprising one or more<br>
of copper hydroxide, alkaline copper carbonate, alkaline copper oxychloride, tribasic copper<br>
sulfate, copper borate, or mixtures thereof. The most preferred embodiments of the invention<br>
comprise particles comprising copper hydroxide, alkaline copper carbonate, copper borate, or<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
Coatings For The Copper-Based And Zinc-Based Particulates.<br>
[0134] In any of the above-described embodiments, the substantially crystalline copper<br>
composition in copper-based particulates and/or copper-based particulate material can further<br>
comprise one or more materials disposed on the exterior of the particles to inhibit dissolution<br>
of the underlying substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper material<br>
at least for a time necessary to prepare the formulation and inject the prepared wood<br>
treatment composition. Over time, however, there is unfavorable particle growth via<br>
dissolution and precipitation processes ani also particle growth via agglomeration. Also, the<br>
particulates are very susceptible to premature dissolution if the slurry is formed with an acidic<br>
water. In preferred embodiments, either the particulates containing, for example, alkaline<br>
copper carbonate, copper hydroxide, copper borate, alkaline copper nitrate, copper<br>
oxychloride, tribasic copper sulfate. Additionally or alternatively the acid-soluble particles<br>
are coated with a substantially inert coating, for example a trace outer coating of e.g. copper<br>
phosphate or copper sulfide, or a coating of a polymeric material such as dispersants, or with<br>
a thin hydrophobic coating, or any combination thereof. In one embodiment the particles are<br>
treated with a dispersing material which is substantially bound to the particles.<br>
[0135] The milled copper-based, zinc-based, and/or tin-based particles described above are<br>
readily slurried and injected into wood after the milling process. Generally, however, milling<br>
is done well before the particles are slurried and injected. The particles may be shipped in a<br><br>
dry form or in a wet form. The milled particles may be transported to a site as a dry mix or as<br>
a concentrated slurry, which is then formed into an injectable slurry, and then after some<br>
indeterminate storage time the particles may be injected into wood. Particulates in solution<br>
have a tendency to grow over time by 1) the thermodynamically driven tendency of sub-<br>
micron particles in solution to grow by a dissolution/reprecipitation process, where there is a<br>
greater tendency for small particles to slowly dissolve and for the salts to reprecipitate on the<br>
larger crystals. It is not uncommon, in unstabilized slurries, for the median particle size to<br>
increase by 50% over a period of a day or two. The goal is to simultaneously achieve the<br>
critical particle size, particle size distribution, and particle stability at a cost where the<br>
material can be commercially used and at the point where the material will be commercially<br>
used. Therefore, it is advantageous to have a coa.tmg on the particle to substantially hinder<br>
dissolution of the particle while the particle is shurried. However, the coating should not<br>
overly hinder dissolution of the particle in the wood matrix. Further, no coating to hinder<br>
dissolution is desirable for copper oxides particulates.<br>
[0136] Inorganic Coating — Generally, the discussion focuses on the preferred copper-<br>
based particulates, but the compositions and methods are equally applicable to the zinc-based<br>
and tin-based particulates. The substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble)<br>
copper-based material, zinc-based material, and/or tin-based material can be stabilized by a<br>
partial or full coating of an inorganic salt. The manufacturing process is amenable to the<br>
formation of a substantially inert inorgaric coating on the particle that will be of such low<br>
thickness that the coating will not substantially hinder particle dissolution in the wood. The<br>
preferred coatings are very low solubility metal salts of the underlying metal cations, e.g.,<br>
copper, zinc, or tin. Exemplary very low solubility salts include copper sulfide (Ksp = 6 E-<br>
36), copper(II) phosphate (Ksp = 1 E-37), and copper 8-quinolinolate (Ksp = 2 E-30). The<br>
selection between sulfide, 8-quinolinolate, and phosphate generally depends on which coating<br>
shows the greatest protection for the particular substantially crystalline (or amorphous<br>
sparingly soluble) material, at the particular size distribution and particle morphology that<br>
may exist. A coating of a very low solubility salt can substantially arrest the<br>
dissolution/reprecipitation process by severely limiting the amount of copper that can<br>
dissolve. The coating, however, is mechanical protection only. Exposed portions of the<br>
underlying substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper-, zinc-, or tin-<br>
based particulates are subject to dissolution. Further, the inorganic coating is generally at<br>
most a few atoms to a few nanometers in depth.<br><br>
[0137] An inorganic coating can be formed during and immediately after the participate<br>
precipitation process, for example by adding after admixing the dissolved copper solution and<br>
the dissolved anion solution together to form the "precipitation solution", e.g., after<br>
precipitation of the substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) particulates has<br>
begun. In one embodiment, the admixed copper-anion solution has a small excess of anions.<br>
Precipitation of the desired copper salts is generally fast, but adding a phosphate composition<br>
(as acid phosphate, or as a partially neutralized acid phosphate) in an amount to give a<br>
concentration between a few hundred ppm and a few percent by weight will cause a layer of<br>
copper sulfate to form, for example, between crystals or even over the crystals of the<br>
substantially crystalline copper material, Alternately, a source of sulfide or 8-quinolinolate<br>
can be added to the precipitation solution. The advantage is the newly formed substantially<br>
crystalline (or substantially amorphous) material is fresh and therefore more reactive toward<br>
the added phosphate ions than would be an aged precipitate. This is not a preferred<br>
mechanism, however, because during milling some of the coating will be abraded away, and<br>
some previously unexposed substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble)<br>
material will now be exposed. Additionally, the amount of material used to get the required<br>
concentration of anions in the precipitati on solution is much more than is needed to form a<br>
coating on particulates.<br>
[0138] The particles may be wet-milled using a very fine milling material and a fluid<br>
containing a source of sulfate ions, phosphate ions, or less preferably (because of odor and<br>
handling problems) sulfide ions. In one preferred embodiment, the wet milling process uses<br>
as the milling fluid a composition comprising between a few hundred ppm of phosphate to<br>
about 6% phosphate, for example between 0.1% phosphate to 3% phosphate. Small amounts<br>
of phosphate will take hours or days to form a completely protective coating, while a more<br>
concentrated solution may form a protective coating in minutes. Advantageously the milling<br>
liquid has a pH between about 6 and about 9.5, for example between about 7 and about 8.5.<br>
This high concentration of phosphate is not wasteful because the milling fluid can be re-used,<br>
and also because the milling fluid is a relatively small volume. Such milling in the<br>
phosphate-containing milling fluid, for example for a time ranging from 5 minutes to 4 hours,<br>
typically from 10 minutes to 30 minutes, will promote the formation of a thin coating of<br>
copper phosphate over the substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper<br>
material. As the coating is probably only a few atoms in thickness, the coating will dissolve<br>
in good time within the wood so as not to impair exposure of the underlying substantially<br>
crystalline copper material in the wood. Alternatively, a source of sulfide or 8-quinolinolate<br><br>
can be added to the milling liquid. Sulfide is again not preferred, for safety reasons. If sulfide<br>
is added the pH should be above 8, preferably above 9. The addition of the 8-quinolinolate is<br>
not an inorganic coating, and the adherence of a coating of an organic nature may be<br>
beneficial.<br>
[0139] In another embodiment, the copper-based particles after milling can be exposed to a<br>
rinse solution that contains between a few hundred ppm of phosphate to about 6% phosphate,<br>
for example between 0.1% phosphate to 3% phosphate. U.S. Pat. No. 4,404,169 describes a<br>
process of producing phosphate-stabilized particulates. Phosphate ions are added to a<br>
suspension of copper oxychloride in an aqueous phase. The copper oxychloride is then<br>
reacted with alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, and the cupric<br>
hydroxide precipitated as a result of the suspension is washed and then re-suspended and<br>
subsequently stabilized by the addition of acid phosphate to adjust a pH value of 7.5 to 9.<br>
The suspended copper oxychloride is reacted in the presence of phosphate ions in an amount<br>
of 1 to 4 grams per liter of the suspension and at a temperature of 20 °C to 25 °C. and the<br>
resulting cupric hydroxide is stabilized with phosphate ions in an amount of 3 to 6 grams per<br>
liter of the suspension. Advantageously, the rinse liquid has a pH between about 6 and about<br>
9.5, for example between about 7 and about 8.5. After contacting the particles,<br>
advantageously for at least a minute or more, this rinse solution can itself be rinsed away with<br>
fresh water. Alternatively, a source of sulfide or 8-quinolinolate can be added to the rinse<br>
liquid. If sulfide is added, the pH should be above 8, preferably above 9.<br>
[0140] In another embodiment, the copper-based particles after milling can be exposed to a<br>
rinse solution that contains between a few hundred ppm of phosphate to about 1% phosphate,<br>
for example between 0.1% phosphate to 0.5% phosphate ions (by weight of the rinse). After<br>
contacting the particles, advantageously, for at least a minute or more, this rinse solution can<br>
itself be rinsed away with fresh water, and the particles can be rinsed with a solution<br>
comprising a few hundred ppm of soluble copper to about 1% soluble copper, for example<br>
between 0.1% phosphate to 0.5% soluble copper ions. This copper-containing solution can<br>
be rinsed off with a minimum quantity of water, and the rinsed particulates can be re-exposed<br>
to a rinse solution that contains between a few hundred ppm of phosphate to about 1%<br>
phosphate, for example, between 0.1% phosphate to 0.5% phosphate ions. Advantageously<br>
the fluids have a pH between about 6 and about 9.5, for example between about 7 and about<br>
8.5.<br>
[0141] In some embodiments some copper-containing particulates are stabilized with a<br>
coating, and some particulates are not subject to such stabilization. For example,<br><br>
advantageously only the very small particulates, e.g., smaller than about 0.05 microns in<br>
diameter, are stabilized by a low-solubility covering layer.<br>
[0142] The invention also embraces embodiments where particles are substantially free of<br>
an inorganic coating.<br>
[0143] Organic Coating — Copper-bassd particles (or zinc-based particles, or tin-based<br>
particles, or mixtures thereof) of the invention may be used directly to preserve wood or<br>
wood products. The copper-based, zinc-based, or tin-based particles or mixtures thereof may<br>
additionally comprise an organic coating, e.g., an organic layer that partially or completely<br>
covers the exterior surface area of the particulates. The protective organic layer may<br>
additionally function as one or more other active agents, as discussed infra. This organic<br>
coating can comprise a variety of materials having a variety of functions over and above<br>
being an organic layer acting as a protective layer temporarily isolating the sparingly soluble<br>
salt from the aqueous carrier to slow dissolution of particulates in the slurry, including: 1) an<br>
organic biocide carrier, 2) a dispersing/anti-aggregation/wettability modifying agent, 3) one<br>
or more biocides, or any combinations thereof. The oil coating can comprise for example<br>
light oils, dehydrating oils, polymeric film s, organic biocides, disbursing agents, anti-<br>
coagulating agents, or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0144] In one embodiment, at least some of the paniculates are coated with an organic<br>
protective coating. The particulates may have been previously coated with an inorganic<br>
coating. The organic coating should provide a thin layer of organic material that at least<br>
partially coats the particulate and for a period of time reduces the tendency of the sparingly<br>
soluble copper, zinc, and/or tin salts in the particulates to dissolve in the slurry.<br>
[0145] Generally such coatings are extremely thin, with a particulate comprising, for<br>
example, between about 0.1% to about 50% by weight, more typically from about 0.5% to<br>
about 10%, of the weight of the above-mentioned sparingly soluble salts. The coating may<br>
cover only a portion of the exterior surface area, for example only 50% of the external<br>
surface area of a particulate.<br>
[0146] The hydrocarbon composition can include one or more hydrophobic oils, and/or may<br>
comprise an organic compound having one or more polar functional groups which increase<br>
adherence of, for example, mono- and/or poly-carboxylic acids that may be at least partially<br>
neutralized with a metal such as a fatty acid or a polycarylic polymer, a surfactant and/or a<br>
disbursing agent, amphoteric agents, an organic biocide including an amine, azole, triazole,<br>
or any other organic biocides, a film-forming polymer such as a sulfonated ionomer, or<br>
mixtures thereof. These and other organic and/or organometallic components that form an<br><br>
organic layer will generally be referred to as a "hydrocarbon layer" or "hydrocarbon<br>
composition."<br>
[0147] An organic coating may be formed by contacting particulates with a hydrocarbon<br>
composition containing the materials to be deposited onto the exterior surface of the particle.<br>
The contacting may occur in a slurry or may be done with a paste of water-wetted particulates<br>
or may be done with dried particulates. The less free water, the easier it is to promote<br>
adherence between the hydrocarbon composition to the particulates.<br>
[0148] Heating a mixture of particulates and the hydrocarbon composition will also help the<br>
hydrocarbon composition wet and adhere to the particulates. Advantageously, in one<br>
embodiment most of the solvent of the hydrocarbon composition is volatile and is removed<br>
prior to injection of the particulates into :he wood, This will leave a thin layer of a more<br>
concentrated biocide in heavier oils and/or binders than was found in the hydrocarbon/biocide<br>
composition. The organic coating generally becomes more adherent if the coated particulates<br>
are allowed to age, and/or are subjected to heat, for example, to 35 °C or above for a period<br>
of an hour, for example.<br>
[0149] Incorporating some solvents, typically polar solvents, e.g., at least 10%, for<br>
example, at least 30% or at least 50% by weight of solvents such as one or more of alcohols,<br>
amides, ketones, esters, ethers, glycols, and such into the particulates may help the<br>
hydrocarbon layer composition wet the particulates. and will allow thinner hydrocarbon<br>
layers to be deposited. Solvents are lower molecular weight and higher volatility than oils,<br>
and solvents may be stripped from the organic coating before slurrying the particles or during<br>
kiln drying of the wood. The hydrocarbon composition may therefore comprise optional<br>
solvents and/or diluents, for example, a mixture of an oily or oil-type organochemical<br>
compound and a solvent of low volatility and/or a polar organochemical solvent or solvent<br>
mixture. Organochemical oils which are preferably employed are oily or oil-type solvents<br>
with an evaporation number of above 35 and a flash point of above 30 °C, preferably above<br>
45 °C. Such water-insoluble, oily and oil-type solvents of low volatility which are used are<br>
suitable mineral oils or their aromatic fractions or rnineral-oil-containing solvent mixtures,<br>
preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or alkyl benzene. Mineral oils include those with a<br>
boiling range of from 170 to 220 °C, spindle oil with a boiling range of from 250 to 350 C,<br>
petroleum and aromatics with a boiling range of from 160 to 280 °C, oil of turpentine and the<br>
like. In one embodiment, liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons with a boiling range of from 180 to<br>
210 °C or high-boiling mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons with a boiling range<br>
of 180 to 220 °C and/or spindle oil and/or monochloronaphthalene are used, for example, a<br><br>
monochloronaphthalene. The organic oily or oil-type solvents of low volatility and with an<br>
evaporation number of above 35 and a flash point of above 30 °C, preferably above 45 °C,<br>
can be replaced in part by organochemical solvents of high or medium volatility, with the<br>
proviso that the preferred solvent mixture also has an evaporation number of above 35 and a<br>
flashpoint of above 30 °C, preferably 45 °C, and that the biocides and/or other compounds<br>
are soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent/oil mixture. In one embodiment, aliphatic<br>
organochemical solvents which contain hydroxyl and/or ester and/or ether groups are used,<br>
such as, for example, glycol ethers, esters or the like. Advantageously the hydrocarbon<br>
mixture comprises binders to wet and adhere to the particulate, for example, synthetic resins<br>
binding drying oils including linseed oil, and also binders comprising, an acrylate resin, a<br>
vinyl resin, for example polyvinyl acetate, polyester resin, polycondensation or polyaddition<br>
resin, polyurethane resin, alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin, preferably of medium oil<br>
length, phenol resin, hydrocarbon resin such as indene/coumarone resin, silicone resin, drying<br>
vegetable and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural and/or<br>
synthetic resin. Pertinent agricultural dying oils include linseed, soybean, canola, rapeseed,<br>
sunflower, rung and castor oils.<br>
[0150] This organic coating can comprise a variety of materials having a variety of<br>
functions, including, but not limited to, surface-active agents and organic biocides.<br>
[0151] Surface-Active Agents - Agents improving the suspension of the particulates include<br>
dispersants such as phenyl sulfonates, alkylnaphthalene sulfonates and polymerized<br>
naphthalene sulfonates, polyacrylic acids and their salts, polyacrylamides, polyalkoxydiamine<br>
derivatives, polyethylene oxides, polypropylene oxide, polybutylene oxide, taurine<br>
derivatives and their mixtures, and sulfonated ligmin derivatives. Surfactants include anionic<br>
surfactants, cationic surfactants, nonionis surfactants, or combinations thereof.<br>
Polyethyleneimine can act as a surfactant or a stabilizer and will also chelate copper.<br>
Dispersants can be used at 0.1% to 50%. preferably 0.5% to 20% or 5-10% of the particulate<br>
product.<br>
[0152] Organic Biocides - As previously stated, the particles may be combined with one or<br>
more additional moldicides or more generally biocides, to provide added biocidal activity to<br>
the wood or wood products. Preferred preservative treatments comprise copper-based<br>
particles having one or more additional organic biocide(s) that are bound, such as by<br>
adsorption, to a surface of the particles. Wood and wood products may be impregnated<br>
substantially homogeneously with (a) copper-based particles of the invention and (b) a<br>
material having a preservative function, such as a material bound to the surface of the copper-<br><br>
based particles, By substantially homogeneously we mean averaged over a volume ot at least<br>
one cubic inch, as on a microscopic scale there will be volumes having particulates disposed<br>
therein and other volumes within the wood that do not have particulates therein. Thus, the<br>
distribution of preservative function within the wood or wood product is preferably not<br>
heterogeneous.<br>
[0153] The absolute quantity of organic biocides is very low. In general, the biocides are<br>
present in a use concentration of from 0.1% to 20%, preferably 1% to 5%, based on the<br>
weight of the copper salts. The sparingly soluble copper-salt particulates of this invention are<br>
typically expected to be added to wood in an amount equal to or less than 0.25 pounds as<br>
copper per cubic foot. The organic biocide(s) at a 4% loading relative to the copper are<br>
present at about 0.16 ounces or about 3 to 4 milliliters of biocide per cubic foot. The organic<br>
biocides are often insoluble in water, which is the preferred fluid carrier for injecting the<br>
wood preservative treatment into wood, so getting adequate distribution of the biocide within<br>
the wood matrix is problematic. In prior art formulations, the wood preservative may be, for<br>
example, admixed in a large excess of oil, and the oil emulsified with water and admixed<br>
with the soluble copper for injection into the wood. Problems arise if the injection is delayed,<br>
or if the slurry has compounds which break the emulsion, and the like.<br>
[0154] The greatest benefit is that a portion or all of the organic biocides incorporated into<br>
the wood preservative treatment can advantageously be coated on to the particulates. By<br>
adhering the biocides on particulates, a more even distribution of biocide in ensured, and the<br>
copper is disposed with the biocide and therefore is best positioned to protect the biocide<br>
from those bio-organisms which may degrade: or consume the biocide. Finally, a formulation<br>
with biocide adhering to particulate s does not face the instability problems that emulsions<br>
face.<br>
[0155] Generally, so little of the organic biocide is needed that it is dissolved in and diluted<br>
with sufficient hydrocarbon material to make the phase of appreciable size. The organic<br>
material/biocide mixture can be contacted with particulates in a slurry, though it may be<br>
difficult to have the hydrocarbon phase adhere to the particulates. Pretreating the particulates<br>
with a coating of for example 8-quinolinolate will greatly increase the likelihood of the<br>
biocide absorbing on the particulate. The particulates may be concentrated, for example, to<br>
an at least 40% by weight particulates in water slurry before admixing in with the<br>
hydrocarbon/biocide composition.<br>
[0156] The biocides can be any of the known organic biocides. Exemplary materials having<br>
a preservative function include materials having at least one of one or more: azoles; triazoles;<br><br>
imidazoles, pyrimidinyl carbinoles; 2-amino-pyrimidines; morpholines; pyrroles<br>
phenylamides; benzimidazoles; carbamates; dicarboximides; carboxamides;<br>
dithiocarbamates; dialkyldithiocarbamates; N-halomethyltbio-dicarboximides; pyrrole<br>
carboxamides; oxine-copper, guanidines; strobilurines; nitrophenol derivatives; organo<br>
phosphorous derivatives; polyoxins; p) rrolethioamides; phosphonium compounds; polymeric<br>
quaternary ammonium borates; succinaite dehydrogenase inhibitors; formaldehyde-releasing<br>
compounds; naphthalene derivatives; sulfenamides; aldehydes; quaternary ammonium<br>
compounds; amine oxides, nitroso-amines, phenol derivatives; organo-iodine derivatives;<br>
nitrites; quinolines such as 8-hydroxyquinoline including their Cu salts; phosphoric esters;<br>

dibromo-2,4-dicyanobutane, p-bromo-P-nitrostyrene; and combinations thereof. These are<br>
merely exemplary of a few classes of the known and useful biocides, and the list could easily<br>
extend for pages.<br>
[0158] The preferred biocides are oil-soluble, and include quaternary ammonium<br>
compounds including, for example, didecyldimethylammonium salts; azoles/triazoles<br>
including, for example, N-alkylated tolytriazoles, metconazole, imidacloprid, hexaconazole,<br><br>
azabonazole, propiconazole, tebuconazole, cyproconazole, bromoconazole, and tridemorph<br>
tebuconazole; moldicides; HDO available commercially by BASF, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Biocides such as tebuconazole are quite soluble in common organic solvents, while others<br>
such as chlorothalonil possess only low solubility.<br>
[0159] To apply the biocide to particulates, the biocide/hydrocarbon composition is<br>
admixed, taking care that the biocide is dispersed and preferably solubilized in the<br>
hydrocarbon composition. The biocide/hydrocarbon composition can be prepared in a<br>
manner known per se, for example, by mixing the active compounds with the solvent or<br>
diluent, emulsifier, dispersant and/or binder or fixative, water repellant, and, if appropriate,<br>
dyes and pigments and other processing auxiliaries. Then, the biocide/hydrocarbon<br>
composition is admixed with particulates where the particulates can be suspended in a slurry,<br>
be wet, or be dry. The composition is mixed to aid the wetting of and distribution of the<br>
biocide/hydrocarbon composition to particulates. The composition may be heated, for<br>
example to about 40 °C, and is also beneficially allowed to sit for a period ranging from<br>
minutes to hours. The mixture can then be incorporated into a slurry or be dried or<br>
formulated into a stable concentrated slurry for shipping.<br>
[0160] In an alternative embodiment, the biocide/hydrocarbon composition is applied as a<br>
spray or aerosol onto individual particles, such as particles suspended in a gas stream. These<br>
coated particulates are then treated to prevent coalescence by, for example, drying the oil to<br>
remove tackiness, or coating the particle with other adjuvants such as anticoagulants,<br>
wettability agents, dispersibility agents, an i the like. Such a product can be- stored, shipped,<br>
and sold as a dry pre-mix.<br>
[0161] In another embodiment, the particles are wetted with a light hydrocarbon material,<br>
which may or may not contain biocide, and the hydrocarbon material is then substantially<br>
removed by washing or drying, leaving a very thin layer of hydrocarbon residue that may<br>
range, for example, from 1 to 30 nanometers thick. Such a very thin layer will have<br>
negligible tackiness and negligible weight, but will protect the particulate from dissolution<br>
and will discourage coagulation in the slurry.<br>
[0162] Alternate Organic Biocide Carrier -- In another embodiment, only a fraction of the<br>
particulates, be they copper-based, zinc-based, or tin-based, may be coated with the<br>
hydrocarbon/biocide combination. Some precipitation techniques are known to produce salts<br>
having high porosity, and these high porosity salts can absorb a substantial quantity of the<br>
biocide therein without forming a tacky coaling.<br><br>
[0163] In another embodiment, the organic biocide/hydrocarbon composition is contacted<br>
with a porous inert participate carrier, for example 0,1 micron in diameter high porosity<br>
alumina, silica, zeolites, diatomaceous earth, attapulgite clay, or the like. Such material is<br>
readily available. For example, U.S. Patent 5,527,423 disclosed alumina with a maximum<br>
particle size below 0.3 microns, having high porosity as evidenced by a BET surface area of<br>
several hundred square meters per gram, and shows this material can be made info a stable<br>
stony. Preferred zeolites include Ag, Zn or Cu-containing zeolites, which themselves have a<br>
biocidal activity. These carrier materials are inexpensive, they do not contribute bio-<br>
nourishment as does the polymeric nanoparticles, and the rigid<br>
alumina/silica/zeolite/diatom/clay particilates will hold the biocides within the pores thereof<br>
during preparation of the slurry and injection of the slurry, or for example during admixing<br>
with glue and/or resins to make wood composites. Therefore, such inert carrier/organic<br>
biocide particulates and, additionally or alternatively, biocidal zeolite/organic biocide<br>
particulates would be useful even with the soluble copper wood preservative treatments in<br>
commercial use today. Such particulates advantageously have a solid, typically insoluble,<br>
crystalline structure that is advantageously between about 0.01 to about 0.3 microns in<br>
average diameter, for example, between about 0.05 to about 0.2 microns in average diameter.<br>
A method of manufacturing said particulates is to pull a vacuum on a quantity of dry carrier<br>
material, and then introduce thereto a composition comprising a major portion (eg., 50% to<br>
90%) of solvents), advantageously a minor portion (e.g., 5% to 48%) of oil(s), and including<br>
between 1% and 40% of organic biocides. The composition is mixed with the inert carrier<br>
and pressure may be exerted to fill the pores of the inert carrier material with the<br>
composition. Then, the solvents and optionally some of the oils may be removed by drying,<br>
heat, or by vacuum. Assuming 30% effective porosity in an alumina carrier is filled to one<br>
third with a hydrocarbon/biocide composition having 20% by weight of biocide, the total<br>
amount of biocide carrier material needed to treat 100 cubic feet of wood would be about 1 to<br>
2 cups of alumina. Beneficially, organic biocide is slowly leached from the particulates. The<br>
biocide formulation in an inert particulate carrier advantageously comprises oils to help<br>
transport biocide from the center of the particulate to the exterior of the particulate, and/or<br>
may include binders to increase the tenacity of the biocide to the particulates. These<br>
particulates will protect the biocide dispersed within the pores thereof, and will reduce the<br>
leach rate of the biocide. These particulates are an improvement over emulsions in that they<br>
ensure a stable formulation and uniform dispersion of the organic biocides in wood. The<br>
carrier material, for example alumina, can be milled with the same equipment used to mill the<br><br>
copper salt containing particulates. These biocide-containing polymers can then be slurried<br>
with the copper-based particulates of the current invention and both solids can be injected.<br>
The advantage of this process is that the carrier, for example, alumina, can be separately<br>
prepared and treated so that the alumina will not be tacky, by, for example, driving off the<br>
lighter oils and leaving only a very thin layer of biocide within the pores of the carrier. A<br>
second advantage is that the alumina/biocide can be used as a filler in a premix, thereby<br>
encouraging mixing properties.<br>
[0164] An exemplary preservative of the invention comprises a flowable material<br>
comprising copper-based particles of the invention. Exemplary flowable materials include<br>
liquids, emulsions, slurries, and suspens ons.<br>
[0165] In one embodiment, a preservative of the invention comprises one or more materials<br>
additional to the copper-based particles, the additional materials preferably also providing a<br>
preservative function. For example, an exemplary preservative comprises an emulsion<br>
comprising the copper-based particles, where at least one phase of the emulsion may<br>
comprise one or more materials having a preservative function. Exemplar)' materials having<br>
a preservative function include materials having at least one of one or more triazole groups,<br>
one or more quaternary amine groups, and one or more nitroso-amine group. Mixtures of<br>
these materials may be used. Preferred preservative materials inhibit organisms that may be<br>
resistant to copper-based preservatives, Biocides useful in wood or wood product<br>
preservation are preferred materials. Preferred preservatives comprise copper-based particles<br>
comprising one or more materials having a preservative function that are bound, such as by<br>
adsorption, to a surface of the particles. Wood and wood products may be impregnated<br>
substantially homogeneously with (a) copper-based particles of the invention and (b) a<br>
material having a preservative function, such as a material bound to the surface of the copper-<br>
based particles. Thus, the distribution of preservative function within the wood or wood<br>
product is made more heterogeneous by being absorbed onto the particulates.<br>
[0166] Finally, in one embodiment the wood preservative treatment may comprise a portion<br>
of the organic biocide coated on the copper-based particulates and another portion of the<br>
organic biocide with a particulate inert carrier. The carrier particulates containing organic<br>
biocides and/or the copper-based particulates may be treated to reduce tackiness.<br>
Injectable Slurry<br>
[0167] In a variation of the invention, the slurry comprises: a liquid carrier; injectable solid<br>
particulates comprising one or more organic biocides; and one or more soluble copper salts or<br>
complexes including the soluble copper treatments described in the prior art. The injectable<br><br>
particulates can be copper-based particulates, zinc-based participates, tin-based particulates,<br>
inert carrier-based particulates, bioactive zeolite-based particulates, or mixtures thereof. The<br>
particulates in this variant of the invention are primarily earners for the organic biocides. An<br>
exemplary particle comprises copper hydroxide having an average particle diameter of less<br>
than about 500 nanometers, for example less than about 250 nanometers, or less than about<br>
200 nanometers, as measured by Stokes Law. Preferably, the average particle diameter is at<br>
least 25 nanometers, for example, at leas: 50 nanometers. In one embodiment of the<br>
invention, the particles have a surface area of at least about 10 m2/gram of particles, for<br>
example, at least about 40 nr/gram of particles, for example, at least about 75 m2/ gram of<br>
particles, for example about 80 m2/gram of particles. The particle size distribution of the<br>
particulates in one embodiment is such that at least about 30% by weight of the particulates<br>
have an average diameter between about 0.07 microns and about 0.5 microns, or preferably at<br>
least about 50% by weight of the particulates have an average diameter between about 0.1<br>
microns and about 0.4 microns.<br>
[0168] In another variation of the invention the slurry comprises: a liquid carrier; injectable<br>
solid particulates comprising a slightly soluble copper salt; and particulates comprising<br>
metallic copper and/or zinc. An exemplary particle having an average particle diameter of<br>
less than about 500 nanometers, for example, less than about 250 nanometers, or less than<br>
about 200 nanometers, as measured by Stokes Law, and the average particle diameter is at<br>
least 25 nanometers, for example, at least 50 nanometers. The particle size distribution of the<br>
particulates in one embodiment is such that at least about 30% by weight of the particulates<br>
have an average diameter between about 0.02 microns and about 0.4 microns, or preferably at<br>
least about 50% by weight of the particulars have an average diameter between about 0.05<br>
microns and about 0.3 microns. The metallic copper and/or metallic zinc particulates have<br>
both a minor biocidal effect and also an anti-corrosion effect. The amount of metal, either<br>
copper, zinc, or both, in the anti-corrosion metallic particulates can range from about 1 part to<br>
about 25 parts per 100 parts of particulates comprising slightly soluble copper salts. The<br>
metal-containing particulates in this variant of the invention are primarily anti-corrosion<br>
additives, though they will have some biocidal effect. Further, organic biocides can be<br>
readily coated onto these metal-containing particulates. In one embodiment of this variant,<br>
the slurry comprises: A) a liquid carrier; B) injectable solid particulates comprising metallic<br>
copper and/or metallic zinc and also one or more organic biocides, and either C-1) one or<br>
more soluble copper salts or complexes including the soluble copper treatments described in<br><br>
the prior art, C-2) one or more injectable particulates comprising slightly soluble salts of<br>
copper and/or zinc, or C-3) both.<br>
[0169] The copper-based particulates can comprise or consist essentially of any sparingly<br>
soluble substantially crystalline (or sparingly soluble amorphous) copper salts. In one<br>
embodiment the substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper salts in the<br>
copper-based particulates comprise or consist essentially of one or more copper salts selected<br>
from copper hydroxides; copper carbonates (e.g., "yellow" copper carbonate); basic (or<br>
"alkaline") copper carbonates; basic copper sulfates including particularly tribasic copper<br>
sulfate; basic copper nitrates; copper oxychlorides (basic copper chlorides); copper borates;<br>
basic copper borates; copper ferricyanate copper fluorosilicate; copper thiocyanate; copper<br>
diphosphate or copper pyrophosphate, copper cyanate; and mixtures thereof. In one<br>
embodiment, the copper-based particles comprise a substantially crystalline copper<br>
compound. At least about 20%, 30%, 50%, or 75% of the weight of the copper-based<br>
particles may be composed of the substantially crystalline copper compound(s).<br>
[0170] In a preferred embodiment, the substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly<br>
soluble) copper salts in the copper-based particulates comprise or consist essentially of one or<br>
more copper salts selected from copper hydroxides; copper carbonates, basic (or "alkaline")<br>
copper carbonates; basic copper sulfates including particularly tribasic copper sulfate; basic<br>
copper nitrates; copper oxychlorides (basic copper chlorides); copper borates, basic copper<br>
borates, and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the copper-based particles comprise a<br>
substantially crystalline copper compound. At least about 20%, 30%, 50%, or 75% of the<br>
weight of the copper-based particles may be composed of the substantially crystalline copper<br>
compound.<br>
[0171] In another embodiment the substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly<br>
soluble) copper salts in the copper-based particulates in a wood preservative formulation can<br>
comprise or consist essentially of a plurality of sparingly soluble substantially crystalline (or<br>
amorphous sparingly soluble) copper salts selected from copper oxide, copper hydroxides;<br>
copper carbonates, alkaline (or "basic") copper carbonates; alkaline copper sulfates; alkaline<br>
copper nitrates; copper oxychlorides; copper borates, basic copper borates, and mixtures<br>
thereof, with the proviso that at least one of the substantially crystalline (or amorphous<br>
sparingly soluble) copper salts is not a copper oxide. Of the copper oxides, Cu2O is preferred<br>
over CuO. In a variant of this, the copper-based particulate material can comprise or consist<br>
essentially of one or more sparingly soluble substantially crystalline copper salts selected<br>
from copper hydroxides; copper carbonates, alkaline (or "basic") copper carbonates; alkaline<br><br>
copper nitrates, alkaline copper sulfates; copper oxychlorides; copper borates, basic copper<br>
borates, and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the copper-based particles comprise a<br>
substantially crystalline copper compound. At least about 20%, 30%, 50%, or 75% of the<br>
weight of the copper-based particles may be composed of the substantially crystalline copper<br>
compound(s).<br>
[0172] In any of the above, the substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble)<br>
copper composition can have a substantial amount of one or more of magnesium, zinc, or<br>
both, wherein these cations are either dispersed within the substantially crystalline (or<br>
amorphous sparingly soluble) copper composition, or be a separate phase within a particulate.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, at least some particulates comprise copper<br>
hydroxide, basic copper carbonate, or both. In more preferred embodiments, the copper<br>
hydroxide comprises between 6 and 20 parts of magnesium per 100 parts of copper, for<br>
example between 9 and 15 parts of magnesium per 100 parts of copper. Alternatively, in<br>
another more preferred embodiments, the copper hydroxide comprises between 6 and 20<br>
parts total of magnesium and zinc per 100 parts of copper, for example between 9 and 15<br>
parts total of magnesium and zinc per 100 parts of copper. In some embodiments, the basic<br>
copper carbonate comprises between 6 and 20 parts of magnesium per 100 parts of copper,<br>
for example between 9 and 15 parts of magnesium per 100 parts of copper, or alternatively<br>
between 6 and 20 parts total of magnesium and zinc per 100 parts of copper, for example<br>
between 9 and 15 parts total of magnesium and zinc per 100 parts of copper. Alternatively or<br>
additionally, in a preferred embodiment, the copper hydroxide and/or basic copper carbonate<br>
comprises between about 0.01 and about 5 parts of phosphate per 100 parts of copper, for<br>
example between 9 and 15 parts of phosphite per 100 parts of copper.<br>
[0173] In another preferred embodiment, the slurry comprises a sparingly soluble copper<br>
salt particulates and also comprises zinc borate particulates. Preferably, at least some of the<br>
sparingly soluble copper salt-based particulates comprise copper borate. It is known to use a<br>
two stage process where a zinc or copper salt is injected into the wood followed by a second<br>
step, wherein the borax is injected and the insoluble metal borate is formed in situ. Such a<br>
complicated, time-consuming, and therefore expensive process in not sufficiently cost-<br>
effective. As the solubility of copper borate is very pH sensitive, in a preferred embodiment<br>
the sparingly soluble copper salts comprise an alkaline material, e.g., copper hydroxide or<br>
copper carbonate, to reduce the solubility of the copper borate. The zinc borate loading can<br>
range from 0.025% to 0.5%, for example, independent of the copper loading in the wood.<br><br>
[0174] In any of the above described embodiments, the substantially crystalline copper<br>
composition in copper-based particulates and/or copper-based particuiate material can further<br>
comprise one or more soluble substantially crystalline copper salts, for example copper<br>
sulfate, copper fluoroborate; copper fluoride, or mixtures thereof, where the soluble<br>
substantially crystalline copper salts phase is stabilized against dissolution.<br>
[0175] In any of the above-described embodiments, the substantially crystalline copper<br>
composition in copper-based particulates and/or copper-based particuiate material can further<br>
comprise the substantially insoluble copper salt copper phosphate, Cu3(PO4)2. In any of the<br>
above-described embodiments, the copper composition in copper-based particulates and/or<br>
copper-based particuiate material can further comprise the insoluble copper salt copper 8-<br>
quinolinolate. In any of the above-described embodiments, the composition can further<br>
comprise copper quinaldate, copper oxime, or both in particuiate form. If there are copper-<br>
based-particulates substantially comprising Cu3(PO4)2 and/or copper oxide and/or copper 8-<br>
quinolinolate, the particulates should be exceedingly small, e.g., less than about 0.07 microns,<br>
preferably less than about 0.05 microns, to provide maximum surface area to help dissolution<br>
of the particles, and the wood treatment :,hould contain another type of substantially<br>
crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper-based particulates, e.g., basic copper<br>
carbonate, basic copper borate, tribasic capper sulfate, copper hydroxides, and the like.<br>
[0176] The zinc analogs of the above are useful for the zinc-based particulates of the<br>
alternate embodiments of the invention. In one embodiment the copper-based particuiate<br>
material can further comprise one or more of crystalline zinc salts selected from zinc<br>
hydroxide; zinc oxides; zinc carbonate; zinc oxychloride; zinc fluoroborate; zinc borate, zinc<br>
fluoride, or mixture thereof. The zinc salts may be in a separate salt phase, or may be mixed<br>
Cu/Zn salts, or combinations thereof. In preferred embodiments the particle comprises at<br>
least about 40%, preferably at least about 60%, and more preferably at least about 80% by<br>
weight of one or more substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) copper salts,<br>
crystalline zinc salts, or mixtures or combinations thereof.<br>
[0177] In one embodiment the copper-based particuiate preservative treatment for wood can<br>
further comprise zinc-based particulates comprising one or more of crystalline zinc salts<br>
selected from zinc hydroxide; zinc oxides zinc carbonate; zinc oxychloride; zinc<br>
fluoroborate; zinc borate, zinc fluoride, or mixture thereof. The preferred zinc-based<br>
substantially crystalline material are zinc hydroxide, zinc borate, zinc carbonate, or mixture<br>
thereof, which may be doped with other cations, e.g., from 0.1 to 10% copper, from 0.1 to<br>
10% magnesium, or both, for example, based on the total weight of the cations in the<br><br>
substantially crystalline (or amorphous sparingly soluble) material. In prelerred<br>
embodiments, the particle comprises at least about 40%, preferably at least about 60%, and<br>
more preferably at least about 80% by weigh; of one or more crystalline zinc salts.<br>
[0178] Preferred embodiments of the invention comprise particles comprising one or more<br>
of copper hydroxide, alkaline copper carbonate, alkaline copper oxychloride, tribasic copper<br>
sulfate, copper borate, or mixtures thereof. The most preferred embodiments of the invention<br>
comprise particles comprising copper hydroxide, alkaline copper carbonate, copper borate,<br>
alkaline copper borate, or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0179] In preferred embodiments of this invention the slurry comprises: a liquid carrier;<br>
sparingly soluble (and preferably substantially crystalline) copper based particulates,<br>
sparingly soluble (and preferably substantially crystalline) zinc-based particulates, sparingly<br>
soluble (and preferably substantially crystalline) tin-based particulates, or mixtures thereof;<br>
and optionally the slurry also advantageously contains one or more organic biocides, one or<br>
more corrosion inhibiting agents, and optionally other ingredients including those discussed<br>
herein. The particulates, and the sparingly soluble salts forming the core thereof, have been<br>
previously discussed. The organic biocides can be in the form of a solution with the carrier<br>
(for water-soluble biocides); an emulsion; a coating on the sparingly soluble copper based,<br>
zinc-based, and/or tin-based particulates; a coating on and/or in other injectable solid<br>
particulates; or any combination thereof. In one embodiment substantially all (e.g., greater<br>
than 99% by weight) of the copper-based, zinc-based particulates, and/or tin-based<br>
particulates of preferred preservatives have a diameter smaller than 0.4 microns (400<br>
nanometers). Such particles may be insufficiently large to scatter enough light to discolor<br>
wood or wood products treated with the particles. In another embodiment, exemplary wood<br>
preservatives comprise copper-based particles having a size distribution in which at least 50%<br>
of particles have a diameter smaller than about 0.5 µm, 0.25 µm, 0.2 µm, or 0.15 µm.<br>
[0180] An exemplary preservative of the invention comprises sparingly soluble copper salt<br>
(e.g., copper hydroxide) or sparingly soluble zinc salt particles having an average particle<br>
diameter of less than about 500 nanometers, for example less than about 250 nanometers, or<br>
less than about 200 nanometers. In a preferred embodiment, the average particle diameter is<br>
at least 25 nanometers, for example, at least 50 nanometers. In a most preferred embodiment,<br>
the sparingly soluble (and preferably substantially crystalline) copper based particulates,<br>
sparingly soluble (and preferably substantially crystalline) zinc-based particulates, and/or<br>
sparingly soluble (and preferably substantially crystalline) tin-based particulates<br>
advantageously have a median particle size below about 0.6 microns, preferably between<br><br>
about 0.1 and about 0.4 microns. The particle size distribution of the participates is such that<br>
less than about 1% by weight, preferably less than about 0.5% by weight, of the particulates<br>
have an average diameter greater than 1 micron. Preferably, the particle size distribution of<br>
the particulates is such that less than about 1% by weight, preferably less than about 0.5% by<br>
weight, of the particulates have an average diameter greater than about 0.6 microns. In one<br>
embodiment the particle size distribution of the particulates is such that at least about 30% by<br>
weight of the particulates have an average diameter between about 0.07 microns and about<br>
0.5 microns. In a preferred embodiment, the particle size distribution of the particulates is<br>
such that at least about 50% by weight of the particulates have an average diameter between<br>
about 0.1 microns and about 0.4 microns.<br>
[0181] In preferred embodiments of this invention, the slurry is substantially free of<br>
alkanolamines, e.g., the slurry comprises less than 1% alkanolamines, preferably less than<br>
0.1% alkanolamines, or is totally free of alkanolamines.<br>
[0182] In preferred embodiments of this invention, the slurry is substantially free of amines,<br>
e.g., the slurry comprises less than 1% amines, preferably less than 0.1% amines, or is totally<br>
free of amines, with the proviso that amines whose primary function is as an organic biocide<br>
are excluded.<br>
[0183] In preferred embodiments of this invention, the slurry is substantially free of<br>
ammonium compounds (e.g., ammonium hydroxide), e.g., the slurry comprises less than 1%<br>
ammonia, preferably less than 0.1% ammonia, or is totally free of ammonium compounds,<br>
with the proviso that ammonium compounds whose primary function is as an organic biocide<br>
are excluded. In another embodiment, the composition comprises an amount of ammonium<br>
hydroxide to keep the pH of the liquid carrier between about 7 and about 10, for example<br>
between about 7.5 and 9, or between about 8 and about 8.5.<br>
[0184] In preferred embodiments of this invention, the slurry is substantially free of<br>
solvents, e.g., the slurry comprises less than 1% organic solvents, preferably less than 0.1%<br>
organic solvents, or is totally free of organic solvents.<br>
[0185] The slurry contains sparingly soluble (and preferably substantially crystalline)<br>
copper based particulates, sparingly soluble (and preferably substantially crystalline) zinc-<br>
based particulates, sparingly soluble (and preferably substantially crystalline) tin-based<br>
particulates, or mixtures thereof. The sparingly soluble materials may have a fraction of<br>
additional cations, e.g., zinc and/or magnesium. The particulates may have an organic<br>
coating covering at least a portion of the exterior of at least a fraction of the particulates. For<br>
example, the particles can be wetted with an oil or solvent comprising e.g., linseed oil,<br><br>
turpentine, and/or pine oil, and typically the oil or solvent will include at least a portion of the<br>
organic biocides. In another embodiment, he slurry will alternately or additionally comprise<br>
inert metal oxide carrier particulates having organic biocide associated therewith. The<br>
particulates may have an inorganic coating covering at least a portion of the exterior of at<br>
least a fraction of the particulates. The inorganic coating in one preferred embodiment<br>
comprises copper phosphate formed by having phosphate absorb onto the sparingly soluble<br>
copper salt.<br>
[0186] The loading of the particulates in :he slurry will depend on a variety of factors,<br>
including the desired copper loading in the wood, the porosity of the wood, and the dryness<br>
of the wood. Calculating the amount of copper-based particulates and/or other particulates in<br>
the slurry is well within the skill of one of ordinary skill in the art. Generally, the desired<br>
copper loading into wood is between 0.025 and about 0.5 pounds copper per cubic foot of<br>
wood.<br>
[0187] In a preferred embodiment, the liquid carrier consists essentially of water and,<br>
optionally, one or more additives to aid paticulate dispersion, pH maintenance, interfacial<br>
tension (surfactants), and anticoagulants. In another embodiment, the carrier consists<br>
essentially of water and, optionally, one or more additives to aid particulate dispersion, pH<br>
maintenance, interfacial tension (surfactants), anticoagulants, and oil-in-water emulsion of oil<br>
containing organic biocides dissolved therein.<br>
[0188] Advantageously, the pH of the liquid carrier is between about 7 and about 9, for<br>
example, between about 7.5 to about 8.5. The pH can be adjusted with sodium hydroxide,<br>
potassium hydroxide, alkaline earth oxide;, methoxides, or hydroxides; or less preferably<br>
ammonium hydroxide. The pH of the injectable slurry is typically between pH 6 and 11,<br>
preferably between 7 and 10, for example, between 7.5 and about 9.5. Acidic pH slurries are<br>
not preferred because several of the sparir gly soluble copper salts of this invention have a<br>
higher solubility at lower pH. Therefore, delays in preparing the slurry, injecting the slurry,<br>
and removing the water carrier may result in undesired dissolution of sparingly soluble<br>
material from the particulates. The pH can be adjusted to the desired pH with alkali or<br>
alkaline earth oxides, methoxides, or hydroxides, or less preferably ammonium hydroxide.<br>
Alkaline earth bases are less preferred because if carbon dioxide or carbonates are present in<br>
solution, there is a possibility of precipitation, for example, of calcite. Such precipitation<br><br>
pH modifying agent may be provided in the form of a preferably aqueous solution comprising<br>
at least one hydroxide salt.<br>
[0189] The slurry is beneficially buffered, by, for example, adding phosphoric acid or salts<br>
thereof in an amount sufficient to give a phosphate content of between about 5 ppm and about<br>
500 ppm. An alternative buffer comprises an alkali bicarbonate and alkali carbonate. The<br>
higher concentrations of phosphates may t e beneficial if the particulates do not have any<br>
coatings formed thereon, as the soluble phosphate ions will discourage dissolution of the<br>
copper salts from the particulates into the liquid carrier. The salts of metal phosphates are<br>
extremely insoluble, for example, the solubility product constant of copper phosphate is about<br>
1 E-37, so in pure water this amount of phosphate would limit the copper ion concentration to<br>
a negligible quantity. The phosphate ions would therefore discourage dissolution and re-<br>
precipitation of the copper, zinc, tin, or any combination thereof. This phosphate may also<br>
allow an existing phosphate-based coating to repair after damage by for example abrasion<br>
with other particles or abrasion while being handled. Finally, the presence of phosphate ions<br>
will slow the leach rate of copper from the wood. On the other hand, the bioactive efficacy of<br>
copper phosphate is probably very low, for the same reasons that the efficacy of copper<br>
oxides is low. The solubilized copper ion;, are believed to be bioactive and therefore<br>
contribute to the bioactivity of the formulation, and the solubility of copper phosphate is very<br>
low. Therefore, it is desirable that any copper phosphate coating on the particulates be so<br>
thin as to be short-lived in the wood. Excessive soluble phosphate may not allow the<br>
phosphate coating to readily break down in the wood, and this could impair the bioactivity of<br>
the particulates. Also, if the mixing tank has, for example, a residual salts from previous<br>
injection of soluble materials, then the phosphates can result in unwanted precipitates<br>
forming. For this reason the concentration of phosphates in the liquid carrier is beneficially<br>
kept below 1000 ppm, for example below 500 ppm or below 100 ppm.<br>
[0190] In one embodiment the slurry comprises between 50 and 800 ppm of one or more<br>
scale precipitation inhibitors, particularly organophosphonates. Alternately or additionally<br>
the slurry may contain between about 50 and about 2000 ppm of one or more chelators. Both<br>
of these additives are meant to inhibit precipitation of salts such as calcium carbonate and the<br>
like, where the source of calcium may be from the water used to make up the slurry. The<br>
preferred inhibitors are hydroxyethylidene diphosphonic acid (HEDP), thethylenetriamine-<br>
pentamethylenephosphonic acid (DTPMP), and/or 2-phosphonobutane-l,2,4-tricarboxylic<br>
acid (PBTC). If the preservative is in a slurry concentrate, the slurry should comprise<br>
between 10 mmoles and 100 mmoles/L oi HEDP, or between 30 mmoles and 170 mmoles/L<br><br>
of PBTC or DTPMP. Mixtures of inhibitors are preferred, as concentrates may have more<br>
inhibitor than can readily be solubilized therein. If the preservative is in a solid form, the<br>
preservative should comprise between about 0.1 to about 1 mole HEDP per kg of particulates,<br>
or between about 0.17 to about 2 mole PBTC and/or DTPMP per kg of particulates.<br>
[0191] In one embodiment of the invent on, a precipitate comprising copper-based particles<br>
is prepared in the presence of a material that inhibits precipitation of at least one of calcium<br>
and magnesium. Alternatively, a material that inhibits precipitation of at least one of calcium<br>
and magnesium is added to a mixture comprising copper-based particles of the invention. In<br>
one embodiment, the precipitation inhibitor is a chelator comprising having at least one<br>
ethylene diamine compound, such as an ethylenediamine-tetramethylene compound or<br>
ethylenediaminetetracetate compound. An acid, such as a phosphonic or acetic acid, of the<br>
ethylenediamine compound may be used. Salts of the ethylenediamine compound may also<br>
be used. In one embodiment, the precipitation inhibitor comprises at least one and preferably<br>
at least two phosphonic groups. The precipitation inhibitor may comprise a phosphonic acid<br>
or salt of a phosphonic acid. The precipitation inhibitor may comprise at least one of a<br>
hydroxyethylidene diphosphonic acid and an aceto diphosphonic acid. A suitable<br>
phosphonate may be synthesized from phosphorous acid by reaction with formaldehyde and<br>
either ammonia or amines. A wood preservative of the invention may include at least one of<br>
a ethylenediamine tetra methylenephosphonic acid, a hexamethylenediamine terra<br>
methylenephosphonic acid, a thethylenethamine penta methylenephosphonic acid, and a 1-<br>
hydroxy ethane diphosphonic acid.<br>
[0192] In some embodiments of the invention, the sparingly soluble (and preferably<br>
substantially crystalline) copper based particulates, sparingly soluble (and preferably<br>
substantially crystalline) zinc-based particulates, sparingly soluble (and preferably<br>
substantially crystalline) tin-based particu ates, or mixtures thereof, are used in conjunction<br>
with a liquid carrier comprising soluble copper, for example, any of the soluble copper<br>
formulations discussed in the background, including, for example, a copper<br>
monoethanolamine carbonate complex, copper monoethanolamine borate complex, copper<br>
azole borate, or copper citrate. Advantageously, this soluble copper material is kept separate<br>
from the particulate slurry or paste of this invention until the injectable slurry is formulated.<br>
If such material is admixed into a concentrated slurry or paste for shipping and storage, then<br>
beneficially the particulates have one or more protective coating layers thereon to minimize<br>
copper dissolution of the particulates.<br><br>
[0193] In some embodiments of the invention, the sparingly soluble (and preferably<br>
substantially crystalline) copper based particulates, sparingly soluble (and preferably<br>
substantially crystalline) zinc-based particulates, sparingly soluble (and preferably<br>
substantially crystalline) tin-based particulates, or mixtures thereof, are used in conjunction<br>
with a liquid carrier comprising one or more soluble; borate salts. Soluble borates can be<br>
added in an amount from about 5 ppm to about 2000 ppm in the slurry, where less than 5 ppm<br>
has little effect and more than 2000 ppm s cost-prohibitive. Borates have both a biocidal<br>
activity and a fire-retardant activity.<br>
[0194] In some embodiments of the invention, the sparingly soluble (and preferably<br>
substantially crystalline) copper based particulates, sparingly soluble (and preferably<br>
substantially crystalline) zinc-based parti culates, sparingly soluble (and preferably<br>
substantially crystalline) tin-based particulates, or mixtures thereof, are used in conjunction<br>
with a liquid carrier comprising one or more soluble chromate salts. Soluble chromates can<br>
be added in an amount from about 5 ppm to about 2000 ppm in the slurry, where less than 5<br>
ppm has little effect and more than 200C ppm is cost-prohibitive. Chromates have both a<br>
biocidal activity and may have a corrosion-reducing activity.<br>
[0195] Increased corrosion of metal fillings has been observed in formulations using soluble<br>
copper preservatives, as opposed to the prior art CCA formulations. The slurry, having a<br>
slightly basic pH and having very low amine content, is expected to reduce the corrosion rate<br>
over that seen with soluble copper. There are additional treatment that can help reduce<br>
corrosion. The presence of small quantities of buffered phosphate may further reduce<br>
corrosion. Eliminating certain sparingly soluble salts such as the oxychlorides will remove<br>
chloride, which will reduce corrosion from that source. Finally, some of the injectable<br>
particulates can comprise at least a porion of reduced metallic zinc or copper. The<br>
particulates are advantageously sized about the same as for the injectable particulates<br>
comprising the sparingly soluble, usually substantially crystalline copper salts. Indeed, in<br>
addition to being useful in slurries of this invention, corrosion of metallic fittings may be<br>
somewhat alleviated by incorporating metallic copper and/or zinc particulates in the soluble<br>
copper solution preservatives of the prior art. Metallic zinc and copper are not considered to<br>
be substantially crystalline, nor are they considered to be sparingly soluble salts. The amount<br>
of these anti-corrosion metallic particulates can range from about 1 part to about 25 parts per<br>
100 parts of copper in the sparingly soluble copper salts.<br>
[0196] Contact with air can facilitate oxidation of certain sparingly soluble copper salts, for<br>
example, copper hydroxide (especially in very small particulate form, and especially if not<br><br>
coaled and/or if not containing a stabilizer such as magnesium ions, to form into copper<br>
oxides). This transition is generally not preferred because copper oxide has such limited<br>
solubility that it may not be sufficiently bioactive. The concentrated slurry or paste may<br>
comprise one or more antioxidants. Soluble sulfite salts between 5 ppm and 100 ppm in the<br>
liquid carrier is a useful inexpensive antioxidant.<br>
[0197] If the wood preservative treatment will comprise organic biocides, these biocides<br>
may be partially or fully coated onto the sparingly soluble (and preferably substantially<br>
crystalline) copper based particulates, sparingly soluble (and preferably substantially<br>
crystalline) zinc-based particulates, sparingly soluble (and preferably substantially<br>
crystalline) tin-based particulates, or mixtures thereof. Preferred preservative materials<br>
inhibit organisms that may be resistant to copper-based preservatives. Moldicides useful in<br>
wood or wood product preservation are a so preferred organic biocides. Alternatively or<br>
additionally, these biocides may be partially or fully coated onto the available surface area of<br>
an inert particulate carrier. If the biocides are to be added to the slurries as an emulsion, the<br>
organic biocides are beneficially kept separate from the concentrated slurry or paste is of this<br>
invention until the injectable slurry is formulated.<br>
[0198] The slurry can advantageously contain one or more additives to aid wetting, for<br>
example surfactants. Surfactants may be in solution, or alternatively may bind to the surface.<br>
When bound to the surface these surfactants function as disbursing agents. A dispersing agent<br>
may be combined with the precipitated copper-based particles. Alternatively, copper-based<br>
particles may be formed in the presence of the dispersing agent. Preferred dispersing agents<br>
include a surface active portion that interacts with the copper-based particle and a second<br>
preferably different portion, which operates to inhibit irreversible agglomeration of the<br>
copper-based particles. For example, a polyacrylate dispersing agent may include at least one<br>
carboxyl group capable of associating, such as electrostaticaly, with a copper-based particle<br>
and a second, hydrophobic portion that may operate to inhibit the permanent agglomeration<br>
of the copper-based particles. Exemplary dispersing agents may include at least one of a<br>
surfactant, a polyacrylate, a polysaccharide, a polyaspartic acid, a polysiloxane, and a<br>
zwitterionic compound. Exemplary compounds useful as dispersing agents are disclosed in<br>
for example, Kirk-Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd Edition, Vol. 22<br>
(John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1983); Napper, Polymeric Stabilization of Colloidal Dispersion<br>
(Academic Press, 1983); and Rosen, Surfactants &amp; Interfacial Phenomena, 2nd edition (John<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons, 1989), all of which are incorporated herein by reference. In one embodiment<br>
of the invention, the copper-based particles may comprise a polymer. In this embodiment,<br><br>
the ratio of the weight of copper present in the particles to polymer present in the particles<br>
may be at least about 1 to 1, for example at least about 2 to 1,4 to 1, 5 to 1, 7 to 1, or at least<br>
about 10 to 1. For example, if ratio of the weight of copper present in the particles to the<br>
weight of polymer present in the particles is at least about 2 to 1, the particles comprise at<br>
least about twice as much copper by weight as polymer. Another aspect of the invention<br>
relates to a preservative useful for wood or wood products, the preservative preferably<br>
comprising a preferably aqueous suspension of copper-based particles. If a dispersing agent<br>
is present in the suspension, the ratio of he weight of copper present in the copper-based<br>
particles of the suspension to the weight of dispersing agent present in the suspension may be<br>
at least about 1 to 1, for example at least about 5 to 1,10 to 1,15 to 1, 20 to 1 or at least about<br>
30 to 1.<br>
[0199] In one embodiment, the dispers ng agent is substantially free of phosphate ion. For<br>
example, the dispersing agent may be substantially free of trisodium phosphate. The<br>
dispersing agent may be substantially free of silicates, sodium carbonate and ammonia. By<br>
substantially free of one or more particular dispersing agents, it is meant that the weight<br>
percent of the one or more dispersing agent relatives to the copper-based particles is less than<br>
3%. In one embodiment, the weight percent of the one or more particular dispersing agents<br>
relative to the copper-based particles is less than about 2%, such as less than about 1%, for<br>
example, less than about 0.5%. In one embodiment, the dispersing agent is free of at least<br>
one of phosphate ion, trisodium phosphate, silicates, sodium carbonate, and ammonia.<br>
[0200] Dispersing agents aid particulate dispersion and to prevent aggregation of<br>
particulates. Sub-micron sized particulates have a tendency to form much larger aggregates.<br>
Aggregates as used herein are physical combinations of a plurality of similarly-sized<br>
particles, often brought together by VanDerWaal's forces or electrostatic forces. By<br>
similarly-sized we mean the particles forming the aggregate have diameters that are generally<br>
within a factor of five of each other. Such aggregates are not desired in the compositions of<br>
this invention. If aggregates are allowed to form, they often can age into a stable aggregate<br>
that can not be readily broken up by mechanical agitation, for example by vigorous stirring of<br>
a slurry. Such aggregates may grow to a size where the aggregates are not readily injectable,<br>
or may be of a size to make the aggregates visible, therefor giving undesired color. In<br>
preferred embodiments of the invention at least 30%, preferably at least 60%, more<br>
preferably at least 90% by weight of the substantially crystalline copper-based particulates in<br>
a slurry are mono-disbursed, e.g., are not in aggregates. To prevent particulates from<br>
agglomerating, the concentrated slurry or paste may comprise cationic, anionic, and/or non-<br><br>
Ionic surfactants; emulsifiers such as gelatine, casein, gum arabic, lysalbinic acid, and starch;<br>
and/or polymers, such as polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl pyrrolidones, polyalkylene glycols<br>
and polyacrylates, in quantities of 0.1 to 20% by weight, based on the weight of the<br>
particulates.<br>
[0201] Another aspect of the invention relates to a preservative useful for wood or wood<br>
products, the preservative preferably comprising a preferably aqueous suspension of copper-<br>
based particles. The suspension may be stabilized by a suspension-stabilizing amount of a<br>
dispersing agent. Preferred dispersing agents include a surface active portion that interacts<br>
with the copper-based particle and a second, preferably different portion, which operates to<br>
inhibit irreversible agglomeration of the copper-based particles. For example, a polyacrylate<br>
dispersing agent may include at least one carboxyl group capable of associating, such as<br>
electrostatically, with a copper-based particle and a second, hydrophobic portion that may<br>
operate to inhibit the permanent agglomeration of the copper-based particles. Exemplary<br>
dispersing agents may include at least one of a surfactant, a polyacrylate, a polysaccharide, a<br>
polyaspartic acid, a polysiloxane, or a zwitterionic compound. If a dispersing agent is present<br>
in the suspension, the ratio of the weight of copper present in the copper-based particles of<br>
the suspension to the weight of dispersing agent present in the suspension may be at least<br>
about 1 to 1, for example at least about 5 to 1,10 to 1,15 to 1, 20 to 1 or at least about 30 to<br>
1.<br>
[0202] The slurry formulations mentioned can be prepared in a manner known per se, for<br>
example by mixing the active compounds with the liquid carrier, and including emulsifier,<br>
dispersants and/or binders or fixative, and other processing auxiliaries. Particulates can be<br>
provided in a concentrated slurry, in a very concentrated paste, as dry particulates, as coated<br>
dry particulates, as part of a dry pre-mix, or any combination thereof.<br>
[0203] Slurry Concentrate -- If the wood preservative is to be manufactured, stored, or<br>
transported in a wetted form, it is beneficial that it be in a concentrated form to minimize the<br>
volume and increased handling expense. Preferably the concentrated slurry or paste<br>
comprises between 5% and 80% by weight, for example between about 15% and 40%, of<br>
sparingly soluble (and preferably substantially crystalline) copper based particulates,<br>
sparingly soluble (and preferably substantially crystalline) zinc-based particulates, sparingly<br>
soluble (and preferably substantially crystalline) tin-based particulates, or mixtures thereof,<br>
with the remainder of the concentrated slurry or paste being a fluid carrier. The concentrated<br>
slurry or paste may further comprise solid particulates that are carriers for one or more<br>
organic biocides, solid particulates comprising metallic copper and/or zinc as corrosion<br><br>
inhibitors, or both. The fluid carrier beneficially comprises one or more additives as<br>
discussed for the slurry, including anti-oxidants; surfactants; disbursing agents; other biocidal<br>
salts and compounds; chelators; corrosion inhibitors;, e.g., phosphates or metallic zinc or<br>
copper particulates; pH modifiers and/or buffers; and the like. The concentration of these<br>
additives will depend in part on the degree to which the slurry concentrate is expected to be<br>
diluted to make a commercially useful injectable slurry having the proper copper loading.<br>
[0204] The moisture content of the copper-based particles of the invention may be reduced,<br>
such as by drying. A dispersing agent may be used to inhibit irreversible agglomeration of<br>
reduced moisture particles of the inventio 1. The reduced moisture particles may be diluted,<br>
such as by hydration with water or combination with another liquid. Generally, dilution is<br>
with water, beneficially fresh water.<br>
[0205] Another aspect of the invention relates to an agglomeration comprising a plurality of<br>
copper-based particles and, optionally, a cispersing agent. The agglomeration may also<br>
include one or more materials in addition to the copper-based particles that also provide a<br>
wood or wood product preservative function. The agglomeration may have a liquid content<br>
(excluding any additional preservative material that may be present) of less than about 75%<br>
by weight, for example, of less than about 50%, less than about 25%, less than about 15%, or<br>
less than about 5% by weight. The liquid may be water. The agglomeration may be diluted<br>
and/or dispersed with mixing or agitation, such as mechanically or ultrasonically.<br>
[0206] As in the injectable slurry itself, the particle size distribution of the particulates is<br>
such that less than about 1% by weight, preferably less than about 0.5% by weight, of the<br>
particulates have an average diameter greater than 1 micron. Preferably the particle size<br>
distribution of the particulates is such that less than about 1% by weight, preferably less than<br>
about 0.5% by weight, of the particulates have an average diameter greater than about 0.6<br>
microns. The particle size distribution of the particulates is such that at least about 30% by<br>
weight of the particulates have an average diameter between about 0.07 microns and about<br>
0.5 microns. In a preferred embodiment, the particle size distribution of the particulates is<br>
such that at least about 50% by weight of the particulates have an average diameter between<br>
about 0.1 microns and about 0.4 microns.<br>
[0207] The pH of the wood preservative in the form of a concentrate or paste is in general<br>
between pH about 6 and about 13, preferably between about 7 and about 10.5, for example,<br>
between about 7.5 and about about 9.5. The pH can be adjusted to the desired pH with alkali<br>
or alkaline earth oxides, methoxides, or hydroxides; or less preferably ammonium hydroxide.<br>
The preferred ingredient to increase the pH is an alkali hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide.<br><br>
The concentrated slurry or paste is beneficially buffered, for example, by adding phosphoric<br>
acid in an amount sufficient to give a phosphate content of between about 10 ppm and about<br>
1000 ppm.<br>
[0208] If the wood preservative comprises organic biocides, these biocides may be partially<br>
or fully coated onto the sparingly soluble (and preferably substantially crystalline) copper<br>
based particulates, sparingly soluble (and preferably substantially crystalline) zinc-based<br>
particulates, sparingly soluble (and preferably substantially crystalline) tin-based particulates,<br>
or mixtures thereof. Alternatively, or additionally, these orgnanic biocides may be partially<br>
or fully coated onto the surface area of an inert particulate carrier. If the organic biocides are<br>
to be added to the slurries as an emulsion, the organic biocides are beneficially kept separate<br>
from the concentrated slurry or paste of this invention until the injectable slurry is<br>
formulated.<br>
[0209] Dry Particulates and Dry Mix For Slurrv -- The particulates are preferably sold as a<br>
dry component. The dry component can be simply the copper-based, zinc-based, and/or tin-<br>
based particulates, which may be coated or uncoated. If coated, the coating can be inorganic,<br>
organic, or both. The particulates advantageously comprise one or more additives such as are<br>
described as being present in the slurry, including, for example, inert particulates having<br>
organic biocides thereon; anti-oxidants; surfactants; disbursing agents; other biocidal salts<br>
and compounds; chelators; corrosion inhibitors, e.g., phosphates or metallic zinc or copper<br>
particulates; pH modifiers; and/or buffers, such as carboxylic acid salts, or inorganic salts,<br>
such as phosphate salts and the like. The additives can be coated onto the sparingly soluble<br>
copper-based particulates and/or can be a second particulate.<br>
[0210] The dry-mix material advantageously has, in addition to dry particulates discussed<br>
above, all necessary components in a single mix, and each component is present in a range<br>
that is useful when the dry mix is forned into an injectable slurry. The dry-mix material may<br>
optionally, but preferably, incorporate a granulating material, which is a material that, when<br>
wet, holds a plurality of particulates ogether in the form of a granule, but that dissolves and<br>
releases the individual particulates on being admixed with the liquid carrier. Granules are<br>
preferred over sub-micron-sized particulates because of dust problems and also the ease of<br>
measuring and handling a granular mixture. Granulating agents can be simple soluble salts,<br>
for example alkali carbonates, that are sprayed onto or otherwise admixed with the particulate<br>
material. Several additives to a shiny can be also used as granulating agents.<br>
[0211] One embodiment of the invention relates to a dry-mix material having a copper<br>
content of at least about 8% by weight. A preferred material includes a plurality of copper-<br><br>
based particles, which may be in the form of granules. The material may be shipped, such as<br>
in granular form, to a location where the material will be prepared for use as a wood<br>
preservative. The dry-mix material may also comprise at least one of a wetting agent; a<br>
dispersing agent; a diluent, which may be a particulate comprising organic biocides thereon;<br>
an antifoaming agent; and an additional material having a biocide function.<br>
[0212] One embodiment of the invention relates to a dry-mix material having a copper<br>
content of at least about 15% by weight. A preferred dry-mix material includes a plurality of<br>
copper-based particles, which may be in the form of granules. The dry-mix material also<br>
comprises at least one of a wetting agent, a dispersing agent, a diluent, an antifoaming agent,<br>
or an additional material having a biocide function. In one embodiment, the dry-mix material<br>
is a granular material comprising about 50% to about 70%, for example about 58%, copper<br>
hydroxide or other sparingly soluble copper salts, about 10% to about 25%, for example<br>
about 18%, of a dispersing agent, such as Borresperse NA, about 1% to about 8%, e.g., about<br>
4%, of a wetting agent, such as Morvet EP, and about 10% to about 30% filler, e.g., about<br>
20% attapulgite clay, such as Diluex A.<br>
[0213] In one embodiment, the dry mix material is a granular material comprising about<br>
40% to about 80% by weight of a sparingly soluble copper salt, e.g., copper hydroxide, about<br>
5% to about 30% of a dispersing agent, such as Borresperse NA, about 1% to about 10% of a<br>
wetting agent, such as Morwet EP, and about 5% to about 30% of a inert particulate filler<br>
which may additionally comprise organic biocides absorbed thereon, e.g., attapulgite clay,<br>
such as Diluex A. In one embodiment, the dry-mix material is a granular material comprising<br>
about 58% copper hydroxide, about 18% of a dispersing agent, such as Borresperse NA,<br>
about 4% of a wetting agent, such as Morwet EP, and about 20% attapulgite clay, such as<br>
Diluex A.<br>
[0214] Another aspect of the invention relates to dry-mix material comprising a copper<br>
content of at least about 15%, for example, at least about 20%, such as at least about 30% by<br>
weight. In one embodiment, the dry-mix material may have a copper content of about 35%<br>
by weight. The dry-mix material has a copper content of less than about 50%, for example,<br>
less than about 45%, such as less than about 40% by weight. The dry-mix material may<br>
comprise a plurality of granules each comprising a plurality of copper-based particles. The<br>
copper-based particles may be associated with a dispersing agent.<br>
[0215] In one embodiment, the dry-mix material comprises A) about 30% to about 70% by<br>
weight of a slightly soluble copper salt, e.g.. copper hydroxide, for example, about 35% to<br>
about 65%, such as about 38% to about 61% of the slightly soluble copper salt; B) about 10%<br><br>
to about 35% by weight, such as about 15% to about 30% of at least one dispersing agent,<br>
e.g., lignosulfonates or polyacrylates; C) about 2.5% to about 20% by weight, such as about<br>
5% to about 15% of at least one wetting agent, for example, a surfactant, e.g., Morwet EP<br>
available from Barton Solvents, Inc.; D) about 5% to about 25% by weight, such as about<br>
10% to about 20% of at least one diluent for example soluble and insoluble diluents, such as<br>
those used in agricultural products, e.g., clay, such as an attapulgite clay, or particulate carrier<br>
particles comprising organic biocide; E) about 0.05% to about 7.5% by weight, such as about<br>
0.1% to about 5%, of at least one antifoam agent; and optionally F) about 2.5% to about 25%,<br>
alternatively less than about 7.5%, such as less than about 5% by weight, of water.<br>
[0216] The dry-mix material may be shipped in granular form. The dry-mix material of the<br>
invention offers reduced shipping costs and improved ease of handling compared to known<br>
preservative materials. A user may receive the dry-mix material as a flowable material<br>
comprising a plurality of copper-based particles. The dry-mix material may be diluted, for<br>
example, with water or another liquid. The copper-based particles of the dry-mix material<br>
may be injected into wood and/or wood materials as a preservative. Mechanical agitation<br>
and/or mixing may be used to disperse the granules in the liquid. Upon dispersing the<br>
material, wood or wood products may be treated with the dispersed material, such as by<br>
subjecting the wood or wood products to vacuum and or pressure in the presence of the<br>
dispersed material. Upon dispersing granules of the material, dispersed copper-based<br>
particles preferably remain suspended for at least about 30 minutes without further agitation,<br>
preferably, even in standard hard water having a hardness of about 342 ppm. Once dispersed,<br>
about fifty percent of the dispersed copper-based particles may have diameters less than<br>
about 1 micron, for example, less than about 0.5 micron, such as less than about 0.25 micron.<br>
In one embodiment, about 50% of the dispersed copper-based particles have diameters less<br>
than about 0.2 micron, for example about 50% of the dispersed copper-based particles have<br>
diameters of about 0.1 micron.<br>
[0217] The copper-based material may comprise additional material providing a wood<br>
preservative and/or biocide function. For example, in one embodiment, the additional<br>
material comprises a plurality of copper-based particles and a co-biocide. Exemplary co-<br>
biocides may include, for example, one or more of a triazole compound, a quartemary amine,<br>
and a nitroso-amine.<br>
Leaching Data<br>
[0218] One object of the inventi an is to provide an effective, injectable copper-based<br>
particulate preservative treatment that has leaching characteristics similar to CCA. It is<br><br>
known that copper arsenate (Cu3(AsO4)2) injected as a molecular layer is effectiveas a<br>
preservative. Therefore, the participate preservative should provide a copper concentration<br>
roughly similar (for example, about the same to within a factor of three times) to that<br>
provided by copper arsenate treatment. Generally, leach rate tests involve high leaching<br>
medium flow rates so the leaching medium can not easily dissolve the sparingly soluble salts,<br>
and therefore measured leach rates of paniculates are expected to be low compared to leach<br>
rates from more soluble salts. By "leach rate similar to CCA," we mean the leach rate using<br>
the AWPA Standard Method El l-97( .997), determined as percent of copper leached per<br>
hour. For a particulate inhibitor injected into wood is within a factor of about 2 above,<br>
preferably within a factor of about l.5 above, to within a factor of 5 below, preferably within<br>
a factor of about 3 below, more preferably within a factor of about 2 below, the percent of<br>
copper leached from CCA-treated wood at 240 hours using the AWPA Standard Method<br>
El 1-97 (1997), by using a test extencing to at least 300 hours duration. Another object of the<br>
invention is to provide an effective, injectable copper-based particulate preservative treatment<br>
that retains more than 94% of the injected copper in a 14 day standard leach test.<br>
[0219] Advantageously the copper based particulate is an effective preservative. To be<br>
effective, the copper-based particles comprise one or more sparingly soluble copper salts that<br>
release a small but effective concentration of soluble copper when wetted with water. If the<br>
copper salts have too high a solubility, the copper is quickly leached out of the wood and<br>
contaminates the environment rathe: than protecting the wood. If the copper salts have too<br>
low a solubility, the copper salts (and copper oxides) are not bioactive. The dissolution<br>
rate/leach rate of the sparingly soluble copper salts used in the particulates will be a function<br>
of 1) the solubility of the sparingly soluble copper salt(s) in the leaching medium; 2) the<br>
surface area of the sparingly soluble copper salts available to contact the leaching medium; 3)<br>
the lattice energy of the crystal which must be overcome to dissolve the crystal; and 4) the<br>
flow characteristics of the leaching medium in the wood matrix, especially boundary layer<br>
effects. Each of these properties plays a role in every flowrate scenario, but some are more<br>
dominant than others at certain times. We believe the leach rates will be governed primarily<br>
by the solubility of the sparingly soluble salts and by boundary layer effects of the copper and<br>
counterions diffusing from the particulates in regimes where the leaching medium is moving<br>
extremely slowly, e.g., less than a few millimeters per day. At intermediate leachant flow<br>
rates, we believe the leach rate of copper will depend primarily on the available surface area.<br>
At higher rates, such as found in the standard test methods typically used by industry, the<br><br>
each rates will be governed more by the available surface area of the sparingly soluble salts<br>
and by the lattice energy of the crystal.<br>
[0220] Generally, surface area is known be an important factor. This is because, as the<br>
sparingly copper salts exist as approximate point sources within the wood matrix, the<br>
leaching medium typically does not contact a sufficient amount of particulates for a sufficient<br>
time to become saturated with the sparingly soluble copper salts. Dissolution is a function<br>
not only of the pH of the water within the wood and the solubility product of the particular<br>
salts in water, but also of dynamic conditions. Since the copper is present in the wood as<br>
particulates, dissolution of copper will also be restricted by the low surface area of the<br>
particles. Larger particulates will reduce the leaching rate in most leaching regimes. The<br>
dissolution of larger particulates is more dependent on surface effects than is the dissolution<br>
of smaller particulates, in part because the available surface area is lower for larger<br>
particulates. At low flow rates, boundary layer effects may multiply the effects of lower<br>
surface area, but at typical leaching regimes boundary layer effects may be minimized if the<br>
flow of the leaching medium through the wood matrix is turbulent.<br>
[0221] The easiest way to alter surface area is to change particle size. In a simplistic model,<br>
reducing the average particle size by one half will increase the available surface area by about<br>
a factor of 2. If the particulates become too small, e.g., below about 0.02 microns (20<br>
nanometers) in diameter or below about 10 nanometers in diameter, for many of the sparingly<br>
soluble copper salts, we believe the leaching medium will always approximate being<br>
saturated by the sparingly soluble copper salts and the available surface area will approach<br>
that of a monolayer, giving leaching properties of an injected soluble copper. The crystals<br>
may then dissolve too quickly if sub ected to a high leaching regime for an extended period<br>
of time. Further, we believe that high leachant flow rates may dislodge and remove from the<br>
wood matrix very small particulates For this reason in preferred embodiments of the<br>
invention at least about 30% or more of the sparingly soluble salts are present as particulates<br>
having a diameter greater than about 0.1 microns.<br>
[0222] Generally, the available surface area can be further reduced by the presence of one<br>
or more coatings, be they organic, inorganic, or both. The coatings must be designed to have<br>
a coverage and efficiency such that at least a bioactive amount of copper is leached from the<br>
sparingly soluble copper salts in the particulates. In some embodiments, the coating is<br>
dissolved over a period of time, thereby allowing the available surface area of the sparingly<br>
soluble copper salts to increase with time. This is advantageous because newly-installed<br><br>
wood generally does not need biocides to be released until the bio-organisms invade or<br>
contact the wood, and this usually takes some time.<br>
[0223] The solubility of the sparingly soluble copper salts can be estimated based on values<br>
of the solubility product constant. However, the presence of ions such as phosphate in the<br>
wood matrix will reduce solubility, while the presence of acids in the leachant will greatly<br>
increase solubility of most of the preferred sparingly soluble salts. At low flow rates, the pH<br>
of the leaching medium will be modified by the dissolution of the copper hydroxides and the<br>
copper carbonates. The isoelectric point of copper hydioxide is at about pH 11, making<br>
copper hydroxide a very effective base. The presence of other salts, for example phosphate<br>
ions, can further hinder leach rates by temporarily holding the solubilized copper, reducing<br>
the flow rate of copper through the wood matrix. At high leaching medium flow rates,<br>
however, such as are used in standard leaching tests, the flow rates are such that the presence<br>
of hydroxides, phosphates, and the like are minimized.<br>
[0224] Generally, the leach rate of copper from particulates of sparingly soluble copper<br>
salts disposed in a wood matrix is dependent on particle size (and hence particle size<br>
distribution), leaching medium flow rates through the wood matrix, and a variety of other<br>
factors. The copper-based particulates oi the invention advantageously have a low leach rate<br>
at both relatively high leaching medium ;Tow rates and at relateively low leaching medium<br>
flow rates, because the copper-based particulates have 1) a wide distribution of particle sizes,<br>
2) sparingly soluble salts of differing solubilities, or 3) both.<br>
Examples<br>
[0225] We have successfully injected slurries comprising sub-micron-sized particles of<br>
various sparingly soluble copper salts into standard 1 inch cubes of Southern yellow pine.<br>
Copper development by colorimetric agents (dithio-oxamide/ammonia) showed the copper to<br>
be fully penetrated across the block in the sapwood portion. Figure 3 shows the penetration<br>
of injected particulate copper hydroxide developed with dithio-oxamide in the third picture.<br>
The stain corresponds to copper. Subsequent acid leaching and quantitative analysis of the<br>
copper from two blocks showed that loadings of 95% and 104% of expectation, or essentially<br>
100% average of expectation had occurred. At 100% loading, values of 0.22 lbs of copper<br>
per cubic foot would be obtained.<br>
[0226] Leaching data from wood preserved with a prior art soluble solution of copper MEA<br>
and from a slurry of injected copper hydroxide particulates of this invention was measured<br>
following the AWPA Standard Method El 1-97. The total copper leached from wood<br>
preserved with copper-MEA-carbonate is 5.7% at 6 hours, 8.5% at 24 hours, 11% at 48<br><br>
hours, 22% at 96 hours, 36% at 144 hours, 49% at 192 hours, 62% at 240 hours, 69% at 288<br>
hours, and 76% at 336 hours. The amount of copper leached from copper hydroxide<br>
particulates was 0.4% at 6 hours, 0.6% at 24 hours, 0.62% at 48 hours, 1.0% at 96 hours,<br>
1.6% at 144 hours, 2.1% at 192 hours, 3.2% at 240 hours, 3.4% at 288 hours, and 3.7% at 336<br>
hours.<br>
[0227] Leaching data from wood was measured using the AWPA Standard Method E11 -97<br>
for the following preservative treatments, where unless specified the tebuconazole (TEB)<br>
concentration was added as an emulsion at 3% of the weight of the added copper: A) TEB<br>
and injected basic copper carbonate particulates; B) traditionally CCA-treated wood (as a<br>
control); C) TEB and copper methanolamine carbonate (as a control, believed to approximate<br>
the currently available Wolman E treatment); D) TEB and injected basic copper carbonate<br>
particulates with sodium bicarbonate buffer; E) injected basic copper carbonate particulates;<br>
F) TEB and injected copper hydroxide particulates modified with zinc and magnesium; G)<br>
about 5% TEB and injected copper hydroxide particulates modified with phosphate coating;<br>
and H) TEB and injected tribasic copper sulfate particulates; I) TEB and injected copper<br>
oxychloride particulates. The leaching data for the various particulate slurries and from two<br>
controls are shown in Figure 1. of the accompanying drawings.<br>
[0228] Using the copper leach rate of CCA as a standard, and viewing the total leached<br>
copper at 96 and 240 hours as representative, the leach rate ratios given by the "total leached<br>
copper to total CCA-leached copper" is given in Table 3 below:<br><br><br><br>
[0229] Of the sparingly soluble salts used, the leach rate in decending order is copper MEA<br>
carbonate (comparative) &gt;&gt; copper oxychloride &gt; tribasic copper sulfate and/or copper<br>
hydroxide with phosphate &gt; basic copper carbonate &gt; copper hydroxide with Zn and Mg.<br>
The isoelectric point of copper oxychloride is about 5 to 5.5, and the isoelectric point of<br>
tribasic copper sulfate is about 6 to 6.5. As these materials are very poor bases, the higher<br>
leach rates from the materials is consistent with expected higher solubility at lower pH<br>
values.<br>
[0230] The presence of TEB reduced leach rates from basic copper carbonate by about<br>
20%, most likely due to TEB partially coating particulates.<br>
[0231] A buffering system, sodium bicarbonate, reduced the leach rates from TEB/basic<br>
copper carbonate by about 10% relative to a preservative without the buffer.<br>
[0232] Surprisingly, the phosphate material in the copper hydroxide did not appear to show<br>
any protective value at all. The reasor for this is not clear. Copper hydroxide with<br>
magnesium and zinc ions showed the owest leach rates.<br>
Method Of Preserving Wood<br>
[0233] Another aspect of the invention relates to wood or a wood product comprising<br>
copper-based particles and, optionally, one or more additional materials having a preservative<br>
function, injected into the wood or wood product. An exemplary piece of wood comprising<br>
copper-based particles has a volume of at least about 6 cm3, for example, at least about 100<br>
cm3, such as at least about 1,000 cm3<br>
[0234] The material of this invention is useful for wood, and also for wood composites.<br>
Preferred wood composites have the preservatrive of this invention either mixed with the<br>
wood particles before bonding, or preferably injected into the wood particulates and dried<br>
prior to bonding. Exemplary wood products include oriented strand board (OSB), particle<br>
board (PB), medium density fiberboard (MDF), plywood, laminated veneer lumber (LVL),<br>
laminated strand lumber (LSL), hardboard, and the like.<br>
[0235] In one embodiment, the wood or wood product has a surface, a thickness, a width,<br>
and a length. Preferably, the wood or wood product comprises a homogenous distribution of<br>
copper-based particles of the invention. In one embodiment, the volume number density of<br>
the copper-based particles 5 cm from the surface, and preferably throughout the interior of<br>
the wood or wood product, is at lea it about 50%, for example, at least about 60%, at least<br><br>
about 70%, or at least about 75% of the volume number density of the copper-based particles<br>
about 1 cm from the surface.<br>
[0236] Wood or wood products comprising copper-based particles in accordance with the<br>
present invention may be prepared by subjecting the wood to vacuum and/or pressure in the<br>
presence of a flowable material comprising the copper-based particles. A pre-injection of<br>
carbon dioxide followed by vacuum and then injection of the slurry is a preferred method of<br>
injecting the slurry into wood. Injection of particles into the wood or wood product from a<br>
flowable material comprising the particles may require longer pressure treatments than would<br>
be required for liquids free of such particles. Pressures of, for example, at least about 75 psi,<br>
100 psi, or 150 psi may be used. Exemplary flowable materials include liquids comprising<br>
copper-based particles, emulsions comprising copper-based particles, and slurries comprising<br>
copper-based particles.<br><br>

A wood preservative includes injectable particles comprising one or more sparingly soluble copper salts. The copper-<br>
based particles are sufficiently insoluble so as to not be easily removed by leaching but are sufficiently soluble to exhibit toxicity<br>
to primary organisms primarily responsible for the decay of the wood. Exemplary particles contain for example copper hydroxide,<br>
basic copper carbonate, copper carbonate, basic copper sulfates including particularly tribasic copper sulfate, basic copper nitrates,<br>
copper oxychlorides , copper borates, basic copper borates, and mixtures thereof. The particles typically have a size distribution in<br>
which at least 50 % of particles have a diameter smaller than 0.25 µm, 0.2 µm, or 0.15 µm. At least about 20 % and even more than<br>
75% of the weight of the particles may be composed of the substantially crystalline copper salt. Wood or a wood product may be<br>
impregnated with copper-based particles of the invention.</td>
