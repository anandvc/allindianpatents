COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
DETERGENT COMPOSITION OR COMPONENT THEREFOR<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
WO 2004/085588<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/001512<br><br>
DETERGENT COMPOSITION OR COMPONENT THEREFOR TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a particulate detergent composition or component therefor which comprises a bi- or tri- valent metal ion carboxylic acid salt.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Modern particulate detergent composition contain a wide variety of ingredients. At the same time the consumer requires a particulate detergent composition which has acceptable physical characteristics such as, for example, being flowable and pourable in the case of powders and having good dispensing and dissolution properties in the case of tablets. The physical properties must remain acceptable even after storage for a number of weeks in the supply chain.<br>
Many ingredients which provide a useful benefit to the detergent composition are difficult to include because they are liquid.  However, liquid ingredients are not in themselves a problem as long as sufficient liquid carrying capacity is present in the solid portion of the detergent. Of more difficulty are the ingredients which are hygroscopic, which may be either liquid or solid. Hygroscopic materials are difficult to handle since they absorb atmospheric moisture over time during storage and can lead to a deleterious effect on physical properties such as undesired caking and subsequent reduction in flowability at<br><br>
WO 2004/085588<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/001512<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
the point of use or a reduction is dispensability, dispersability or dissolution rate.<br>
US 4,196,095 (Church &amp; Dwight) discloses a carbonate based <br>
5  detergent composition which comprises magnesium stearate in order to reduce insoluble lump formation in cold water.<br>
US 2,589,330 (Swift &amp; Co) discloses a cleansing composition comprising trisodium phosphate and silica.  A magnesium <br>
10  compound is added to prevent caking.<br>
The present inventors have found that specific carboxylic acid salts are especially effective at reducing the negative effects on physical properties of particulate detergent <br>
15   compositions or components therefor due to moisture uptake.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a free-flowing particulate detergent composition or component therefor which comprises a bi- or tri- valent metal ion carboxylic <br>
20  acid salt which, without the salt being present, has a hygroscopicity value of greater than 25%.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
25  The bi- or tri- valent metal ion carboxylic acid salt<br>
The carboxylic acid salt preferably has a metal ion selected from magnesium, calcium, zinc, aluminium, lead, iron or mixtures thereof, preferably magnesium.<br>
30 <br>
WO 2004/085588<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/001512<br><br>
-   3   -<br>
Preferably the carboxylic acid salt has from 10 to 22, preferably from 14 to 20 carbon atoms, more preferably 18 carbon atoms. Most preferably the salt is magnesium stearate having 18 carbon atoms. <br>
5<br>
The carboxylic acid salt is preferably in particulate form. If so it preferably has a number average particle size of from 0.1 to 500 micrometres, preferably from 1 to 200 micrometres, more preferably from 2 to 100 micrometres, most<br>
10  preferably from 3 to 50 micrometres, or even from 3 to 20           micrometres.<br>
The carboxylic acid salt may be present substantially homogeneously throughout the composition or component. <br>
15  Alternatively the carboxylic acid salt may be present at the surface of the particles at a higher concentration than the average concentration in the composition or component.  In a preferred embodiment the carboxylic acid salt is present on the surface of the particles, and this is often referred to<br>
2	0  in the art as layering.<br>
The carboxylic acid salt is preferably present at a level of from 0.1 to 10 wt%, preferably from 1 to 8 wt%, more preferably from greater than 2 to 6 wt%, or even from 2.5 to <br>
25  5 wt%, based on the weight of the composition or component before addition of the carboxylic acid salt.<br>
The carboxylic acid salt may simply be added to a previously manufactured particulate detergent composition or component.<br>
3	0  Preferably the carboxylic acid salt is particulate and is<br><br>
WO 2004/085588<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/001512<br><br>
-   4   -<br>
layered onto the surface of the detergent composition or component.<br>
The Composition or Component Therefor <br>
5<br>
The present invention applies equally to detergent compositions and to components of detergent compositions which are designed to be added to an already manufactured detergent composition.  For example the invention applies to<br>
10  detergent base powder particles made by spray-drying or<br>
granulation as well as adjunct components such as bleach or enzyme granules, perfume granules, effervescent granules etc.  Preferred perfume granules comprise maltose and Polybutylmethylacrylate.<br>
15<br>
The term "hygroscopicity value", as used herein, means the level of moisture uptake by the composition or component, as measured by the percent increase in weight of the particles under the following test method.  The hygroscopicity value<br>
20  is determined by placing 2 grams of particles (approximately 500 microns in size) in a closed container of volume 0.01m3 under conditions of 25°C and 70% relative humidity for a period of 2 days.  The percent increase in weight of the particles at the end of this time is the particles"<br>
25  hygroscopicity value as used herein.<br>
Since the carboxylic acid salt reduces the negative effects of moisture uptake, the invention relates to compositions or components which are hygroscopic.  It is not known whether <br>
30  the carboxylic acid salt reduces the amount of water uptake or whether it prevents caking without reducing water uptake.<br><br>
WO 2004/085588<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/001512<br><br>
-   5   -<br>
In any case the invention applies to detergent compositions or components which,  without carboxylic acid salt being present, have a hygroscopicity value of at least 2%, preferably greater than 5%, preferably greater than 10%, <br>
5  	more preferably greater than 20%, or even greater than 30%, or even greater than 40% or even greater than 50%.<br>
