				<td>The present invention relates to a closed battery. The battery is capable of bursting at a prescribed pressure, especially at a low pressure, to rapidly release the internal pressure and at the same time to break a current, when the batten7 temperature or the battery internal pressure is elevated.<br>
Recently, with increasing requirement of electronic devices that are made into much smaller size and lighter weight with high performance, the use of non-aqueous batteries with high energy density has become popular. Batteries which use an alkaline metal such as lithium, sodium, or potassium as an active material for negative electrode thereof employ battery container of completely closed structure since the alkaline metal easily acts with water.<br>
Such a completely closed battery has a merit of reasonable storability, but in reverse,, its high sealability sometimes causes rupture of the battery itself due to the abnormally elevated internal pressure thereof in a case where the battery is exposed to high temperature, or a short circuit is formed inside or outside of the battery to cause a large flow of the current, or a hydrogen gas is generated in the battery due to water contamination penetrated in the<br><br>
batter is deposited manually withthe help of a ladle on to the pan cradle or moving pans and steam cooked to produce idlis.<br>
With the growing demand for breakfast foods, the need for large scale production of idlis is faced by many catering institutions like Defense, Railways, Industrial canteens and Restaurants. In order to meet the large scale production of idlis, batch type units are readily available in the market.<br>
In our patent application No. 950/DEL/94. We have described and claimed a Device for Continuous Production of Idlis capable of producing 1000-1200 idlis/hr.<br>
Large scale production of idlis with these machines is facing a major constraint in depositing the idli batter on to the pans cradle or moving pans manually, that is a predetermined quantity at right place, at right time and in hygienic manner. This poses many problems like the operator tires quickly, un-hygienic due to manual handling, inconsistent deposition, time consuming and the shape of the final product may not be as desired.<br>
There are a number of depositing machines commercially available on the market for volumetric filling/depositing of liquids/ masses such as milk, edible oils, bakery products. One such example is the single drop depositor. Reference may be made to Dominic Man , 1990, Prcess Engineering in the Food Industry, edited by R.W. Field &amp; J.A. Howell, published by Elsevier Applied Science, New York. Vol-2, pp 75-87. These machines are basically operated and controlled pneumatically. The machine essentially consists of a cylinder and piston for measuring deposit, and a mechanically operated rotary valve and accommodation for adjusting the speed and stroke length of the piston.<br><br>
Reference may be made to US. Patent No. 4494920, Positive Displacement Volumetric Depositor and A New Universal Depositor (Ann\on, 1989) suitable for fruits, nuts, chocolate and minced meat and automatic butter dispenser (US patent No. 3437238).<br>
Though the above machines can be used for idli batter, some of the drawbacks encountered are as follows:<br>
1.	Machines are complicated, presence of pneumatic system and cylinder and piston<br>
arrangements.<br>
2.	Presence ofrotary 'valve and Gliding parts in the system may lead to food<br>
contamination due to metal to metal contact, though it is made out of food grade<br>
material.<br>
3.	Dis-assembling and cleaning of the system is difficult due to their complicated<br>
design.<br>
4.	Consumes more electrical energy and the cost is also high.<br>
5.	Presence of suck-back arrangement to the system for avoiding the trailing has made<br>
the machine costlier.<br>
6.	Occupies more space.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a device useful for continuous dispensing of idli batter and like materials; which obviate the above noted drawbacks.<br><br>
Another objective of the present invention is to eliminate the complicated design such as pneumatic system and suck-back arrangement and to provide a simple device for deposition.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an economically cheaper device for deposition of idli batter and similar materials.<br>
Still another objective is to provide continuous and consistent operation of the unit for on line production.<br>
In the drawings accompanying this specification, Fig-1 depicts the front view and Fig 2 shows the side view of an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a device useful for continuous dispensing of idli batter and like materials, which comprises: a horizontal trough (1) having a plurality of vertical conical chambers at its lower end, the trough being connected by means to a feed hopper (7) through inlet (11), each of the said vertical conical chambers being provided at the conical bottom end with a knife edged opening and characterised in that with a plurality of valves (3) connected by a valve stem (4) passing through a valve stem guide sleeve (5) to a horizontal strap (6), the said horizontal strap being connected by means to a vertical movement control system consisting plunger type electromagnetic solenoid(2), solenoid plunger(9) with time-delay-relay unit and a spring (10) between the solenoid and the main strap, the said control system (2,9,10) is fixed on to the top cover of the said horizontal trough (1).<br>
An embodiment of the present invention provides a volumetric depositor for depositing idli batter continuously which comprises of four conical chambered stainless steel trough (1) of 6 litres capacity. And a built on feed hopper (7) a reservoir surge tank (8) with batter intake regulating valve (13) for holding idli batter in bulk for continuous operation,<br><br>
which is just above the main unit. With the help of this arrangement, batter may be replenished to the main trough through an entry (11) made on the trough. Apex of the each cone is made of knife edged opening with a valve seater, on which the valve (3) will be regulating the quantity of material to flow and avoids tailing during deposition. A built in electromagnetic system is provided with a plunger type solenoid (2) and a time-delay-relay unit (not shown). The solenoid plunger (9) is connected with horizontal strap (6) with a hook joint, with which all valves with valve stems (4) are fitted for simultaneous operation. A spring (10) is provided between the solenoid and the main strap for avoiding excessive damage, for cushioning action during upward stroke and also to arrest noise. These valve stems further runs inside the main vessel through individual valve sleeves (5). A glass window (12) is provided on the body of the main trough for observing the level of the idli batter inside the trough.<br>
The main unit is made of four conical chambered stainless steel trough, in which valves are to be operated smoothly. The top portion of the trough is firmly covered with a stainless steel cover, which also acts as a guide for valve stem. On the main trough, an entry is provided throughout its length for replenishing the idli batter from feed hopper.<br>
Apex of each of the cones are made of knife edged opening with valve seater for accommodating the valve. In this arrangement, during the upward stroke of the valve stem an annular space is created between the valve and the valve seater and the material is dispensed. The valve shuts off the dispensing of the material during the down stroke of the valve stem and eliminates the droppings and tailing due to the knife edged bottom opening.<br><br>

The main unit is made of four conical chambered stainless steel trough, in which valves are to be operated smoothly. The top portion of the trough is firmly covered with a stainless steel cover, which also acts as a guide for valve stem. On the main trough, an entry is provided throughout its length for replenishing the idli batter from feed hopper.<br>
Apex of each of the cones are made of knife edged opening with valve seater for accommodating the valve. In this arrangement, during the upward stroke of the valve stem is create an annular space between the valve and the valve seater and the material is<br>
^<br>
dispensed. The valve shuts off the dispensing of the material during the down stroke of the valve stem and eliminates the droppings and tailing due to the knife edged bottom opening.<br><br>
The feed hopper and a reservoir surge tank for holding batter in bulk is provided. Around 60-80 kg of batter can be stored at a time in the tank, which can supply batter continuously for about 2-3 hrs of continuous operation.<br>
Pear shaped valves may be made out of food grade plastic material such as Teflon and they are fixed to the bottom of the valve stem, top end being connected to the main horizontal strap with lock nuts. These valve stems smoothly reciprocates up and down with the help of the valve sleeves during operation. The valve sleeve keeps the valve stem in position and avoids buckling action during down.strake,of the valve.<br>
The valve movement is operated by the help of a built in electromagnetic system. Since the device is used for continuous operation, a plunger type tractive magnet is selected, which consists a solenoid and a plunger which is connected to the main horizontal strap with a hook joint.<br>
A glass window is also provided on the main trough to observe the constant level of the idli batter inside the vessel.<br>
After, preliminary adjustments like stroke length annular space between the valve and the valve seater, both solenoid and the main trough are firmly fixed on to the idli machine before the machine is put in operation.<br>
The operation of the device of the present invention is as follows:<br>
The fermented batter of standard compositions is filled to the surge tank in bulk(60-80 kg) with required quantity for 1-2 hours operation.<br><br>
The stroke length of the valve stem and time of opening is adjusted with the help of time-delay-relay unit and lock nut arrangement in the valve attachment. The material level in the unit is maintained constantly by operating the valve which is provided between the feed hopper and the surge tank. The speed of the moving idli pans and the time of opening of the depositor valve is suitably synchronized to deposit pre-determined quantity of material at right place. And the feed point at which the deposition starts on the pan is identified and switched on the main unit and time-delay-relay unit simultaneously. Lastly care should be taken in avoiding air locking, which may affect the consistency in deposition. This problem can be avoided by frequent check on the air vents.<br>
The main advantages of the device of the present invention are :<br>
1.	The unit is suitable for continuous operation.<br>
2.	The amount of deposition can be suitably varied by adjusting the stroke length of the<br>
valve stem and annular space between the valve and valve seater.<br>
3.	The unit is simple to operate and deposits continuously a pre-determined quantity of<br>
material.<br>
4.	The unit is cheap and hygienic.<br>
5.	No tailing and droppings during deposition throughout the process.<br>
6.	The unit can also be used for other products similar to the idli batter.<br>
7.	Easy dismantling system, easy to clean.<br>
8.	Occupies less space.<br><br><br>
