				<td>Description<br>
Optically ignited spark gap<br>
The invention relates to overvoltage protection having a spark<br>
gap which has mutually opposite electrodes, with a light source<br>
for production of an ignition light as a function of initiation<br>
signals from a control unit, with the ignition light being<br>
designed for direct ignition of the spark gap.<br>
Overvoltage protection such as this is already known from<br>
DE 197 18 660 Al. The overvoltage protection described there<br>
has a spark gap which comprises two mutually opposite<br>
electrodes. A pulsed nitrogen laser is provided in order to<br>
ignite the spark gap, whose laser pulses, which are in the UV<br>
range, are guided in a gas area which is bounded by the<br>
electrodes. A window which is permeable to UV light and is<br>
composed of quartz glass is provided for injection of the<br>
ignition light into the spark gap, which is surrounded by a<br>
housing. In order to reduce the energy of the light pulses that<br>
is required to ignite the spark gap, a metal aerosol is<br>
provided between the electrodes, so that ignition electron can<br>
be produced by photoemission.<br>
DE 198 03 636 Al discloses an overvoltage protection system<br>
with a spark gap which can be ignited via an ignition<br>
electrode. An ignition circuit is used to trigger the spark gap<br>
and comprises a capacitive voltage divider with an ignition<br>
capacitor, as well as an ignition switching element, across<br>
which a smaller voltage is dropped than across the main<br>
electrodes of the spark gap, owing to the capacitive voltage<br>
divider. If the voltage which is applied to the ignition<br>
switching element<br><br>
exceeds a threshold value, it is moved from a blocking<br>
position, in which current flow is interrupted, to its<br>
current-carrying on position,' so that the ignition capacitor is<br>
discharged, causing a spark discharge between the ignition<br>
electrode and one of the main electrodes, and thus initiating<br>
the ignition of the main spark gap.<br>
Spark gaps which can be actively ignited are also used as<br>
overvoltage protection for components which are arranged on<br>
high-voltage platforms that are designed to be isolated.<br>
Overvoltage protection such as this is already known from the<br>
common prior art. Figure 1 shows overvoltage protection such as<br>
this, which has a main spark gap 2 with main electrodes 3. The<br>
main electrodes are connected in parallel with series<br>
capacitors, which are connected to a three-phase DC voltage<br>
electrical power supply system at high-voltage potential.<br>
Bridging by means of the spark gap protects the capacitor<br>
against excessively high voltages. The series capacitors or<br>
other electronic components to be protected are arranged on a<br>
platform 4, which is designed to be isolated, and is supported<br>
on a substrate, that is at ground potential, via supporting<br>
mounts which are in the form of pillars but are not illustrated<br>
in the figures. By way of example, the main electrode 3 that is<br>
shown at the bottom in Figure 1 is thus at a high-voltage<br>
potential which corresponds to that of the platform 4, while<br>
the main electrode 3, which is shown at the top in Figure 1, is<br>
at the high-voltage potential of the three-phase power supply<br>
system. A voltage of between about 60 kV and 160 kV is dropped<br>
between the main electrodes, so that the components which are<br>
arranged on the platform 4 are designed for this voltage drop.<br><br>
An ignition circuit 5 with an ignition electrode 6 is provided<br>
for active ignition of the spark gap 2, with the ignition<br>
circuit 5 having a capacitive voltage divider with a first<br>
capacitor 7 and an ignition capacitor 8. The ignition capacitor<br>
8 can be bridged by a parallel path, in which an initiation<br>
spark gap 9 and a non-reactive resistor 10 connected in series<br>
with it are arranged. The initiation spark gap 8 can be<br>
triggered by control electronics 11, which allow current to<br>
flow via the parallel path, thus bridging the ignition<br>
capacitor 8 . The bridging changes the ignition electrode 6 to<br>
the potential of the lower main electrode 3, which, however, is<br>
arranged physically closer to the upper main electrode 3 than<br>
the lower main electrode 3. This results in a spark discharge,<br>
which jumps over to the lower main electrode 3. The control<br>
electronics 11 can be supplied with the power required to<br>
initiate the initiation spark gap 9 via a power supply 12.<br>
The initiation spark gap 9 is actively ignited. In this case, a<br>
protective device 13 monitors electrical measurement variables<br>
of the three-phase electrical power supply such as the<br>
alternating current in each phase of the three-phase electrical<br>
power supply, and/or the voltage which is dropped across the<br>
electronic components on the platform 4. If initiation<br>
conditions occur, such as a threshold voltage being exceeded on<br>
the component, the protective device 13 produces an initiation<br>
signal, which is transmitted to a semiconductor laser 14 which<br>
then produces an optical initiation signal which is supplied<br>
via an optical waveguide 15 to the control electronics 11. On<br>
reception of an optical initiation signal, the control<br>
electronics cause electrical initiation of the spark gap 2. The<br>
spark gap 2 is thus initiated only indirectly by means of an<br>
optical signal whose light intensity<br><br>
is thus matched only to the sensitivity of the optoelectrica 1<br>
transducer for the control electronics.<br>
The protective device 13 as well as the semiconductor laser 14<br>
are at a ground potential, thus making it easier to access and<br>
service them when required. The optical waveguide 15 allows<br>
safe guidance of the ignition light, while at the same time<br>
maintaining the isolation between the platform 4, which is at a<br>
high-voltage potential, and the components 13 and 14, which are<br>
at ground potential, of the overvoltage protection 1.<br>
Because of the electronics that are required with the power<br>
supply on the platform, the already known overvoltage<br>
protection is costly and complex to maintain.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide overvoltage<br>
protection of the type mentioned in the introduction, which<br>
allows reliable ignition of the spark gap.<br>
The invention achieves this object by means of an optical-<br>
waveguide for guiding the ignition light to the spark gap.<br>
According to the present invention, the ignition light is<br>
guided reliably from the light source via an optical waveguide<br>
to the spark gap. For this purpose, it is necessary for the<br>
material of which the optical waveguide is composed to have<br>
sufficiently high optical transparency for the ignition light,<br>
and for light absorption with dissipative heat development as a<br>
consequence to be largely avoided. The light power which is<br>
required to ignite the spark gap is, according to the<br>
invention, so high that, after the ignition light emerges from<br>
the optical waveguide an adequate number of free charge<br>
carriers are produced by photoemission<br><br>
and/or: multiple photon absorption or other effects, which free<br>
charge carriers are accelerated by the electrical field between<br>
the electrodes of the spark gap, forming an arc.<br>
For the purpose of the invention, one of the electrodes of the<br>
spark gap, for example, is grounded, while in contrast the<br>
other main electrode is at a higher potential than this.<br>
However, this situation is not relevant in practice.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the main<br>
electrodes are, however, arranged on a platform which is<br>
designed to be electrically' isolated, is at a high-voltage<br>
potential and is provided for components to be mounted on,<br>
which can be connected to a high-voltage three-phase electrical<br>
power supply system, and in that the light source is grounded.<br>
In other words, the light source is not arranged on the<br>
platform but in the surrounding area, which is grounded and to<br>
which the light source is electrically conductively connected.<br>
In this case, the overvoltage protection is used for protection<br>
of components arranged on the platform, such as capacitors,<br>
coils and the like. The optical waveguide, which has an<br>
isolating effect, extends between the platform and the grounded<br>
light source, so that this allows the spark gap to be<br>
controlled while at the same time maintaining the isolation<br>
between the platform and ground potential.<br>
The light source expediently has a pump laser which is designed<br>
for optical pumping of a fiber laser, with an active medium of<br>
the fiber laser being formed in one section of the optical<br>
waveguide. Said section of the optical waveguide is doped with<br>
an optically active material which absorbs the pump light, so<br>
that<br><br>
a population invasion is made possible if the pump power is<br>
sufficiently high. In this case, the material of said secTion<br>
of the opt.i ca 1 waveguide assists the laser process. Complex<br>
injection of the ignition light into the optical waveguide is<br>
avoided by means of the fiber laser. The light furthermot <br>
propagates info the optical waveguide itself after emergin <br>
from the laser resonator of the optical waveguide, so that high<br>
ignition light powers can be produced in the optical waveguide,<br>
as a function of the pump power.<br>
Any desired pump lasers, which are known best of all to these<br>
skilled in the art, are suitable for use as pump lasers. The<br>
pump laser is therefore, for example, a solid-state laser such<br>
as an Nd-YAG laser or a semiconductor laser, which have an<br>
emission wave length in the absorption range of the optically<br>
active particles of the fiber laser.<br>
Optics are advantageously provided for focusing of the ignition<br>
light. According . to this advantageous further development,<br>
optics are provided on the platform between the spark gap and<br>
the outlet end of the optical waveguide and, after appropriate<br>
alignment, result in focusing of the ignition light in the gas<br>
area, which is bounded by the main electrodes. The focusing of<br>
the ignition light results in the light intensity in the focus<br>
area becoming so high that free electrons, or in other words a<br>
laser-induced optical breakdown, are or is produced in the<br>
spark gap as a result of non-linear interactions between the<br>
gas molecules and the laser light, for example by means of<br>
multiple photon absorption. The electrical field between the<br>
main electrodes accelerates the free electrons so that an arc<br>
is formed between the electrodes because of the resultant<br>
avalanche effect, and this<br><br>
results in a voltage drop across the component to be protected.<br>
The ignition light is advantageously guided on a surface of tui<br>
electrode which faces the opposite electrode. In this expedient<br>
further development, the so-called photoemission is used for<br>
spark initiation. In this case, the ignition light interacts<br>
with the surface material of the electrode. This interaction<br>
results in electrons being released from the electrode<br>
material, leading to initiation of the spark gap. Focusing of<br>
the ignition light is also possible in this case'.<br>
In contrast to this, the optical waveguide is chosen to be<br>
aligned such that the surface of the main electrode is located<br>
in the path of the ignition light that emerges from the optical<br>
waveguide. In this case, by way of example, unfocused ignition<br>
light strikes the surface of the electrode at right angles or<br>
at an acute angle. The critical factor with both variants is<br>
that the interaction between the electrode material results in<br>
the production of a sufficient number of free charge carriers<br>
for initiation of the spark gap. This avoids melting of the<br>
optical waveguide end in the ignited spark gap.<br>
In a further refinement of the invention, the ignition light is<br>
incident between the main electrodes transversely with respect<br>
to the electrical field, with the ignition light being guided<br>
along the surface of one main electrode, and in the process<br>
resulting in electrons emerging from the surface material. In<br>
this case as well, the photoemission effect initiates the spark<br>
discharge.<br><br>
That free end of: the optical waveguide remote from the light;<br>
source is advantageously arranged in one electrode. According<br>
to this advantageous further development, the light beam<br>
emerges from the optical waveguide parallel to the field lines<br>
of the electrical field between the main electrodes. In order<br>
to protect the optical waveguide against being melted away, the<br>
outlet end of the optical waveguide is arranged recessed in a<br>
main electrode, so that the optical waveguide remains at a<br>
distance from the ignition arc.<br>
In one preferred exemplary embodiment, the spark gap is part of<br>
an ignition circuit for ignition of a main spark gap. The main<br>
spark gap is, for example, connected in parallel with a<br>
component to be protected against overvoltages. In this case,<br>
in order to increase the withstand voltage, the spark gap may<br>
have a plurality of spark gap elements, which are arranged<br>
connected in series with one another and only one of which is<br>
directly ignited by light. The ignition of only one or of some<br>
of the series-connected spark gap elements increases the<br>
voltage which is dropped across those spark gap elements which<br>
have not yet been ignited, so that they are likewise ignited.<br>
This applies in a corresponding manner to spark gaps which are<br>
connected in series and are not part of an ignition circuit,<br>
but are arranged directly in parallel with the component to be<br>
protected. In other words, any desired connections of spark<br>
gaps are possible according to the present invention.<br>
Further expedient refinements and advantages of the invention<br>
are the subject matter of the following description of<br>
exemplary embodiments of the invention with reference to the<br>
figures of the accompanying drawing, in which components having the same<br>
effect are provided with the same reference symbols, and in<br>
which:<br><br>
Figure 1 shows one exemplary embodiment of overvoltage<br>
protection according to the prior art, and<br>
Figure 2 shows one exemplary embodiment of overvoltage<br>
protection according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows an already known exemplary embodiment of<br>
overvoltage protection 1 according to the prior art, as has<br>
already been described further above.<br>
Figure 2 shows one exemplary embodiment of overvoltage<br>
protection 1 according to the invention, which is connected in<br>
parallel with a component which is arranged on the platform 4<br>
but is not illustrated in the figure, such as a high-voltage<br>
capacitor. In this case, the high-voltage capacitor is<br>
connected in series in one phase of a high-voltage three-phase<br>
electrical power supply system. In order to avoid high<br>
potential differences, the components which can be coupled to<br>
the high-voltage line of the three-phase electrical power<br>
supply system are arranged on the platform 4, which is held in<br>
an isolated manner on a substrate that is at ground potential,<br>
for example via supporting mounts composed of ceramic, cast<br>
resin or the like.<br>
In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the overvoltage<br>
protection 1 has a main spark gap 2, which comprises the main<br>
electrodes 3 and can be ignited by means of the ignition<br>
electrode 6. The ignition circuit 5 is used for initiation, is<br>
arranged - like the ignition electrode - on the platform 4, and<br>
is thus at a high-voltage potential. The ignition circuit 5<br>
comprises a capacitive voltage divider, which comprises the<br>
capacitor 7 and the ignition capacitor 8, which are connected<br>
in series with one another. The ignition capacitor 8 can be<br>
bridged by a bridging path in which the<br><br>
non-reactive resistor 10 and an initiation spark gap 9, as the<br>
spark gap, are arranged in series.<br>
In contrast, the protective device 13 as well as a pump laser<br>
16 are at ground potential. In contrast to the laser 13 shown<br>
in Figure 1, the pump laser 16 is not used to produce an<br>
ignition light which can be injected into the optical waveguide<br>
15, but to pump a fiber laser 17 which is in the form of a<br>
section of the optical waveguide 15 and is composed of a host<br>
crystal which is doped with optically active particles. The<br>
host crystal, through which the pump light from the pump laser<br>
16 can pass, assists the optically active particles to produce<br>
the population inversion, thus allowing laser operation of the<br>
fiber laser 17.<br>
The protective device 13 is connected to measurement sensors<br>
such as voltmeters, which are not illustrated in the figures,<br>
so that the voltage which is. dropped across a component to be<br>
monitored can be supplied to the protective device 13.<br>
The overvoltage protection 1 shown in Figure 2 acts as follows:<br>
The protective device 13 compares the voltage values supplied<br>
from the voltmeter with, for example, a threshold value. In<br>
contrast to this, the protective device derives a voltage value<br>
from current values from the measurement devices. If the<br>
voltage values exceed the threshold value, the protective<br>
device 13 initiates an electrical initiation pulse, which is<br>
supplied to the pump laser 16. After reception of the<br>
initiation pulse, the pump laser 16 produces pump light, which<br>
releases a laser pulse in the fiber laser 17 . The laser pulse<br>
in the fiber laser 17 is referred to as the ignition light. The<br>
ignition light, which originates from the fiber laser 17 is<br>
passed via the optical waveguide 15 to the initiation spark gap<br>
9,<br><br>
which is sealed by a housing that is not illustrated. The<br>
housing is filled with a gas. In this case, the free end of the<br>
optical waveguide is arranged in the housing such that the<br>
ignition light which emerges from the optical waveguide 15<br>
enters the gas area, which is bounded by the electrodes,<br>
transversely with respect to the electrical field that is<br>
produced by the electrodes of the initiation spark gap 9. The<br>
laser light from the fiber laser 17 is so intensive that it<br>
produces an optical breakdown in the initiation spark gap 8,<br>
thus igniting the initiation spark gap 8. The breakdown of the<br>
spark gap 3 is produced by the circuitry that has already been<br>
described in conjunction with Figure 1, thus protecting the<br>
component connected in parallel with it against excessively<br>
high voltages.<br>
In one exemplary embodiment, which is not illustrated in the<br>
figures and differs from this, the optical waveguide or<br>
waveguides is or are passed directly to the main spark gap. The<br>
main spark gap can thus be ignited optically. This means that a<br>
costly ignition circuit has become superfluous. The cost<br>
advantages obtained from this compensate for the costs for the<br>
pump laser and the fiber laser.<br><br>
