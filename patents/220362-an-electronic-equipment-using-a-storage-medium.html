				<td>BACKGROUND 1. Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to an electronic<br>
equipment employing a storage medium, a recording medium<br>
recording and/or reproducing apparatus, and a recording and/or<br>
reproducing apparatus employing a disk cartridge. Particularly,<br>
the present invention relates to an electronic equipment<br>
employing a storage medium having a lid "body;/ a recording medium<br>
recording and/or reproducing apparatus, and a recording and/or<br>
reproducing apparatus employing a disk cartridge.<br>
2. Background of the Invention     <br>
Generally, an electronic equipment shown in FIG. 1 has been known as that using a disk cartridge housing a disk-like recording medium as a storage medium. The electronic equipment shown in FIG. 1 is a disk recording and/or reproducing apparatus and has a substantially rectangular box-shaped casing 1 and a front panel 2 fitted to a front side of the casing 1. This front panel 2 closes a front surface opening portion of the casing 1.<br>
The front panel 2 has a storage medium insertion portion 3 formed therethrough and formed of a slot-shaped • rectangular opening portion,  the disk cartridge is inserted into and ejected from an outside of the equipment through the storage medium insertion portion 3.  The storage medium insertion portion 3 of the front panel 2 can be opened and<br><br>
closed by a lid body 5 disposed on the inner side thereof.<br>
The lid body 5 has a shutter portion 5a which can close the whole storage medium insertion portion 3 and a pair of left and right rotation shaft portions 5b projectingly provided at upper portions of both longitudinal-direction sides of the shutter portion 5a.  Both of the rotation shaft portions 5b are rotatably engaged with shaft holes provided in the front panel 2 and are biased by coil springs (not shown) toward in the direction in which the storage medium insertion portion 3.<br>
The storage medium insertion portion 3 of the front panel 2 is usually closed by a lid body 5 by a spring force of a coil spring. When the lid body 5 is pushed backward by the disk cartridge 4 against the spring force of the coil spring and then rotated backward by about 90° with the rotation shaft portion 5b being employed as a rotation center, the storage medium insertion portion 3 is completely opened, thereby an insertion path of the disk cartridge 4 being established.<br>
However, in the disk recording and/or reproducing apparatus as described above, the lid body 5 closing the storage medium insertion portion 3 serves as a shutter rotated inward in the casing 1 and is rotated inward by the disk cartridge 4 when the disk cartridge 4 is inserted, thereby a path where the disk cartridge 4 is loaded onto the equipment being established.<br>
Accordingly, when the disk cartridge 4 is inserted and reaches a predetermined position in the electronic equipment, the lid body 5 is kept in a state that it is lifted up, which permits a mechanism, pats and so on housed in the<br><br>
casing 1 to be exposed. Therefore, in this state, dusts and so on may enter the casing 1 from the opened storage medium insertion portion 3, which may cause any troubles.  Although the inside of the storage medium insertion portion 3 is usually closed by the lid body 5, the storage medium insertion portion 3 itself is always exposed, which lowers a degree of freedom in design and tends to unify an appearance of the equipment.<br>

the side portions of the upper surface plate 9b.  The front surface plate 9a is positioned at the substantially same plane as the front surface of the front panel 8 in a state that the opening portion 14a is closed.  The upper surface plate 9b is~ positioned at the substantially same plane as the upper surface<br>
'•-«.<br>
of the casing 7 in a state that the lid body 9 closes the opening portion 14a.  A lid-body side inclined guide portion 19 formed as a curved surface slanting to the back is provided on an outer side of the front surface plate 9a -of the ;lid body, 9&gt; i.e., on a side opposed to the disk cartridge 5£ to be inserted. Depth-direction and width-direction lengths of the inclined guide portion 19 are set substantially the same as those of the panel side inclined guide portion 16. When the disk cartridge 50 is inserted, the inclined guide portion 19 is brought in contact with the insertion-side upper end edge of the disk cartridge 50 and lifted up by a pressing force of the disk cartridge 50, thereby the opening-portion 14a serving as the recording medium insertion portion being opened.<br>
As described above, as shown in FIG. 8(A), the  inclined guide portion 19 of the lid body 9 and the inclined guide portion 16 of the front panel 8 serving as a casing-side member respectively have S-shaped cross sections so as to be continuous from each other in the vicinity of the boundary where<br><br>
both of the inclined guide portions 19, 16 are in contact with each other. When the disk cartridge 50 is inserted, the inclined guide portion 16 and the inclined guide portion 19 cooperatively act, thereby an opening operation of the lid body 9 described later on being automatically carried out in accordance with an insertion opetation of the disk cartridge 50.<br>
Arm portions 20a, 2Ob projected downward are provided " at both lower-surface side "portions of the upper surface plate -9b of the lid body 9.  The arm portions 20a&gt;- 20b are biased inward so as to avoid the inclined-surface receiving portions 8b, 8b of the front panel 8 and bent backward from their middle portions.  The one arm portion 20a has a cylindrical shaft portion 21a at its tip end portion, and *the other arm portion 20b has a bearing aperture 21±&gt; at its tip end portion.<br>
Of the cylindrical portion 2 la and the bearing<br>
aperture 21b, the one rotation shaft 18a of the front panel 8 is rotatably engaged with a hole of the cylindrical portion 2la, and the other rotation shaft I8b of the front panel 8 is rotatably engaged with the bearing aperture 21b.  Rotation portions of these cylindrical shaft portion 21a and the bearing aperture 21b are employed as a rotation center of the lid body 9.  A lid-body moving mechanism is formed of a pair of the arm ; portions 20a, 20b, the cylindrical shaft portion 21a and the bearing aperture 21b respectively provided thereat, and a pair of the rotation shafts 18a, 18b provided on the front panel 8. The lid-body moving mechanism moves the lid body 9 in the direction in which the lid body 9 is opened outward relative to<br><br>
the casing 7, by rotating the lid body 9 with employing the rotation shafts 18a, 18b pivotally supported by the cylindrical shaft portion 2la and the bearing aperture 21b, respectively.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, ribs 22, 22 for lifting the lid body 9 up are provided between both of the arm portions 20a, 20b.  When the disk cartridge 50 is inserted, the ribs 22, 22 are brought onto the upper surface of the inserted disk cartridge 50 and then serve to reduce the friction of the lid body 9 resulting from its sliding on the disk cartridge 50 to thereby permit the lid body 9 to easily rotate.  Accordingly, when the disk cartridge 50 is inserted and ejected, only tip end portions of the ribs 22, 22 are brought in contact with the disk cartridge 50.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, a torsion spring 23 for biasing the lid body 9 toward the front panel 8 is fitted between the lid body 9 and the front panel 8.  The torsion spring 23 has a coil portion 23a at its center portion and two spring pieces 23b, 23c projected from both ends of the coil portion 23a. The cylindrical shaft portion 2la at the tip end of the arm portion 20a of the lid body 9 is inserted into the coil portion 23a of the torsion spring 23.  The one spring piece 23b is engaged with and stopped at a spring receiving piece 20c of the arm portion" 20a, and the other spring piece 23c is engaged with and stopped at a spring receiving piece 8e provided on an inner surface of the front panel 8.  Thus, the lid body 9 is biased toward the front panel 8 side, i.e., in the direction in which the opening portion 14a is closed.<br><br>
In a state that the front panel 8 is fitted to the lid body 9, a spring force of the torsion spring 23 keeps the lid body 9 biased toward the front panel 8.  At this time, as shown in FIG. 8(A), lower end portions of the front surface plate 9a and the both side surface plates 9c of the lid body 9  &gt; are brought in contact with the plane receiving portion 8a and the inclined-surface receiving portions 8b, 8b of the front panel 8 from the upper side.  Since the lid body 9 is positioned at one of the four corners of the casing 7, the lid body 9 and the casing 7 integrally form the facing body. Since the lid body 9 is formed so that its external shape and an external shape of the casing 7 should be continuous, thereby the facing body having the whole external shape which can be regarded as that of a unit being formed.      <br>
The facing body having the above arrangement houses therein a disk loading mechanism 30 and a disk rotating mechanism 40 which are mounted on a chassis 28 shown in FIGS. 6 and 7.  THe disk loading mechanism 30 is a mechanism for lifting a cartridge holder 31 for holding the disk cartridge 50 inserted through the above recording medium insertion portion 14a up and down in the vertical direction with keeping the same in its horizontal state. When the disk loading mechanism 30 carries out its lift-down operation, a magneto-optical disk 53 as a disk-like recording medium housed in the disk cartridge 50 is loaded onto a spindle motor 41 of the disk rotating mechanism 40 provided below the disk loading mechanism 30.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 6 and 1, the disk loading mechanism<br><br>
30 has the cartridge holder 31 supported by the chassis 28 so as to be lifted up and down in the vertical direction, a slide member 32 supported by the chassis 28 so as to be movable in the forward and backward direction, and a holder locking member 33 for locking the cartridge holder 31 upon the loading operation. The chassis 28 is formed of a flat casing having a laterally-inclined-U-shaped cross section with openings at its upper, front and rear surfaces, and a front surface thereof is opposed to the front panel 8.  The sliding member 32 is provided so as to be movable linearly in the forward and backward direction relative to the chassis 28.<br>
The cartridge holder 31 and the sliding member 32 can be relatively moved by a holder lifting and lowering mechanism in the directions perpendicular to each other, respectively. The holder lifting and lowering mechanism is formed of a lifting and lowering mechanism for restricting the horizontal direction movement of the cartridge holder 31 to thereby lift the cartridge holder 31 up and down only in the vertical direction, a horizontal movement mechanism for restricting the vertical-direction movement of the sliding member 32 to thereby move the sliding member 32 only in the horizontal direction, and a direction changing mechanism for converting the horizontal-direction movement of the sliding member 32 into the lifting and lowering of the cartridge holder 31.<br>
The disk rotating mechanism 40 provided below the disk loading mechanism 30 has a turntable 43 for magnetically chucking the magneto-optical disk 53 and the spindle motor 41<br><br>
fitted with the turntable 43 at a tip end of its rotation shaft.<br>
The spindle motor 41 is mounted on the chassis 28 at the center<br>
of its front side with its rotation shaft being faced upward,<br>
and also fixed on the chassis 28 by a plurality of fitting<br>
screws pierced through flange portions of a fixing member 42<br>
provided on a lower side of the spindle motor 41.  A ring-shaped<br>
magnet, not shown, is provided at the center of the turntable<br>
43, and this magnet chucks the magneto-optical disk as will be <br>
described later on.	<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the disk cartridge 50 for use in the disk reproducing apparatus 6 has a pair of upper shell 51 and a lower shell 52, and a magneto-optical disk 53 rotatably housed in a disk chamber portion provided between the both of the shells 51, 52. A metal hub, not shown, is fitted to;a center portion of the magneto-optical disk 53. A lower surface of the metal hub is opposed to an opening portion formed through a center portion of the lower shell 52. The turntable 43 of the spindle motor 41 is inserted through this opening portion, and then the ring-shaped magnet provided on the turntable 43 magnetically absorbs and chucks the magneto-optical disk 53.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the upper and lower shells 51, 52 have opening portions 54, 54 provided therethrough so as to be extended outward from the center of the magneto-optical disk 53. In FIG. 2, the opening portion 54 formed through the lower shell 51 is not shown in FIG. 2 in order to avoid complication of the figure.  The magnetic head of the recording and/or reproducing mechanism is inserted into the opening portion 54 of the upper<br><br>
shell 51, and an optical head of the recording and/or reproducing mechanism is opposed to the opening portion 54 of the lower shell 52.  These opening portions 54, 54 can be opened and closed by a shutter 55.  The shutter 55 of the disk cartridge 50 is opened by a shutter opening and closing mechanism (not shown) provided in the cartridge holder 31, and in a state that the shutter 55 is opened, the magnetic head or the optical head is opposed to the magneto-optical disk 53. When the disk cartridge 50 is ejected from the disk reproducing apparatus 6, the shutter opening and closing mechanism moves the disk cartridge 50 to a position there the shutter 55 thereof closes the opening portions 54, 54.<br>
An opening and closing operation of the lid body 9 in the disk reproducing apparatus 6 having the above arrangement will be described.  As shown in FIG. 2, an insertion-side end of the disk cartridge 50 is positioned so as to be opposed to the recording-medium insertion portion of the disk reproducing apparatus 6.  The disk cartridge 50 is moved toward the lid body 9 with being positioned substantially in parallel to the upper and lower surfaces of the casing 7, and as shown in FIG. 8(A), an insertion-side lower end edge of the disk cartridge 50 is brought in contact with the guide included portion 16 of the front panel 8, At this time, an insertion-side upper end edge of the disk cartridge 50 may be brought in contact with the inclined guide portion 19 of the lid 9.<br>
When from this state a. force F is applied to the disk cartridge 50 and thereby the disk cartridge 50 presses the front<br><br>
panel 11, a counterforce R the front panel 8 is linked with and fixed on the casing 7.  Since, as shown in FIG. 8(A), the inclined guide portion 16 is formed as a plane inclined upward in the depth direction, a diagonally upward force S toward the lid body 9 located above the disk cartridge 9 is applied to the disk cartridge 50 in response to balance of forces applied to a contact point of the inclined guide portion 16 and the disk<br>
j<br>
cartridge 50.<br>
Since the lid body 9 is rotatably and pivotally<br>
supported on the casing 7 side by the lid-body moving mechanism<br>
and the rotation shafts 18a, 18b serving as rotation fulcrums<br>
therefor are located below a movement locus of the disk<br>
cartridge 50 by a length T. A clockwise-direction rotation<br>
moment M is produced in the lid 9 as shown in FIG. 8(A). At<br>
this time, since the lid body 9 is constantly biased toward the<br>
front panel 8 by the torsion spring 23, while a moment which<br>
rotates the lid body 9 by a spring force of the torsion spring<br>
23 is larger than the rotation moment M, the lid body 9 is not<br>
moved.  However, if the rotation moment M becomes larger than<br>
the moment resulting from the torsion spring 23, as shown in<br>
FIG. 8(B), the lid body 9 is rotated in the clockwise direction<br>
with the rotation shafts 18a, 18b being employed as the rotation<br>
center O.	<br>
At this time, since the inclined guide portion 19 of the lid body 9 brought in contact with the insertion-side upper end edge of the disk cartridge 50 is formed as a arc-shaped, curved surface having a large concave in the depth direction on<br><br>
its lower side, it is possible to secure a rotation of the lid body 9 in response to a horizontal-direction movement of the disk cartridge 50.  Since the rotation center 0 of the lid body 9 is positioned on the inner side of the casing 7, a distance between the rotation center 0 and the inclined-surface receiving portion 8b provided at the upper portion of the front panel 8 becomes the shortest at the middle portion of the inclined-surface receiving portion 8b.  Therefore, if the inclined-surface receiving portion 8b is linearly extended from its lower end to its upper end, then it becomes impossible for the lid body 9 to be rotated at the upper portion with respect to the portion where the above distance becomes the shortest, because the extended portion on the upper side of the inclined-surface receiving portion 8b interferes with the rotation of the lid body 9.  According to the first embodiment, since, as shown in FIGS. 8(A) to 8(C), the upper side portion, with respect to the position where the above distance becomes the shortest, of the inclined-surface receiving portion 8b is formed so as to be arc-shaped and the above distance is set equal to or shorter than the shortest distance, it is also possible to secure the rotation of the lid body 9 in view of this arrangement.       :<br>
When the above-mentioned actions of the upper and lower inclined guide portions 19, 16 and the disk cartridge 50 move the lid body 9 in the direction in which the casing 7 is opened toward the outside and then the insertion-side tip end portion of the disk cartridge 50 is brought into the opened opening portion 14a as the recording medium insertion portion,<br><br>
•-as shown in FIG. 8(C), the lid body 9 is brought onto t nil .{disk<br>
cartridge 50.  Then, since there is no bar to prevent the5disk cartridge from entering the disk reproducing apparatus 6-ethead of the disk cartridge 50 in its movement locus direct ion/f= the-disk cartridge 50 can be inserted into the disk reproducing apparatus 6.<br>
At this time, while the disk cartridge 50 is inserted with being guided by the plane receiving portion 8a while being sandwiched by the front panel 8- and the lid bodji 9,, only^ the lower end portions of the ribs 22, 22 provided at the lid body 9 are slidably in contact with the upper surface eft the disk cartridge 50 and hence the frictional drag caused by the rigs 22, 22 is not very large. ALthough the biasingforce of the torsion spring 23 is still applied from the Idclgbody the disk cartridge 50, the disk cartridge 50 can be easily inserted.<br>
Since the cartridge holder 31 supported by the chassis 25 is positioned on the movement locus of the disk cartridge 50 and an insertion opening of the cartridge holder 31 is provided in the vicinity of the inner side of the lid body 9, when the disk cartridge 50 passes by the lid body 9, its insertion side enters the cartridge holder 31. As shown in FIG. 9(A), when the disk cartridge 50 is completely inserted into the casing 7 side, the disk cartridge 50 is completely brought into the cartridge holder 31, and then the cartridge holder 31 is brought in a state shown in FIG. 6. At this time/ the shutter 55 of the disk cartridge 50 is opened by an operation of the shutter opening and closing mechanism. The lid-body 9 is<br><br>
brought onto the disk cartridggirSOo and the dp.ekinarp.onit35en5E4and  the opt is  brought  in  its  opened stat&amp;iougivt  in itrs  opened  state.<br>
When the disk cartridge  SOwfcanbtfaegtrisisa cartridge 50 is brouc predetermined position of £he-eaetiddd Jxstd&amp;io&amp; pfttondrairtridqe  loading mechanism 30 operatesaioMlfflwecafeliencartDptVwilder &amp;fcer the ca vertically.

In this case,  when the dislcncafalLEid§se5,Ovd3snldrfoerdisk cartric to the predetermined position and then the magneto-optical disk 53   is  chucked by the turntable 43,   a force applied  from the disk cartridge  50 to the lid body 9 for lifting the lid body 9 up is released and hence the  spring force of  the torsion spring 23 serves to rotate the lid body 9 toward the front panel 8.    As shown in FIG.   9(B),   consequently,   the lower surface of the front surface plate  9a of the  lid body 9  isbrdmght ihecdodadiiis trou-g!it the plane receiving portion 8a of theo.f r-6ntnganel"ta.pnaS etfcfchaf f rc-nt- p.-the  lower surfaces of the side  surf ace plates ~9rr;J~9cr is brought in contact with the plane receiving portion 8a and the inclined-surface receiving portion 8b.     The  lid body 9  and the front panel  8a are brought  in entire contact with each other,  thereby the opening portion 14a being completely closed.<br><br>
Since, as shown in FIG. 9(B), the opening portion 14a as the recording medium insertion portion 14a is closed in a state that the disk cartridge 50 is completely inserted, the dusts and so on are prevented from intruding into the disk reproducing apparatus 6 through the opening portion 14a. Therefore, it is possible to prevent inconvenience such as a trouble resulting from intrusion of dusts and so on. Since the opening portion 14a is not-exposed to the outside relative to the front panel 8 in a state that the disk cartridge 50 is inserted, degree of freedom in design of the whole apparatus is increased, which can lead to realization of more creative (i.e., not uniform) design.<br>
A modified example of employing a rotary type disk loading mechanism 60 as a recording medium loading mechanism will be described with reference to FIG. 11 and the succeeding figures.  The disk loading mechanism 60 is a mechanism for rotating a front side of the cartridge holder for holding the disk cartridge 50 inserted through the opening portion as the recording medium insertion portion, in the vertical direction with employing a rear side thereof as a rotation center. When the front side of the cartridge holder is rotated upward and hence the cartridge holder is inclined, this disk loading mechanism 60 is brought in its unloading state. When the front side of the cartridge holder is rotated downward and hence the cartridge holder is brought into its horizontal state, this disk loading mechanism 60 is brought in its loading state.  In the loading state, the magneto-optical disk 53 housed in the disk<br><br>
cartridge 50 is loaded onto a turntable, not shown, of the spindle motor 41 of the disk rotating mechanism 40.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 10 and 11, the disk loading mechanism 60 has a chassis 611 fixed on the casing 7, a cartridge holder 62 provided on the chassis 61 so as to be ratable in the vertical direction, and an eject lever 63 supported by the chassis 61 so as to be slidable in the forward and backward direction.<br>
The chassis 61 has a shallow gutter having a rectangular cross section and formed of a lower surface plate 61a having a plane slightly larger than the disk cartridge 50, and left and right side surface plates 61b, 61b formed so as to be erected upward on the both lateral-direction sides of the lower surface plate 61a. The spindle motor 41 of the disk rotating mechanism 40 is fixed on a front-side center portion of the lower surface plate 61a of the chassis 61.  An optical head 58 of an information reproducing mechanism 57 is disposed on one side of the spindle motor 41 so as to be movable in the radius direction of the magneto-optical disk 53.<br>
The cartridge holder 62 has an upper surface plate 62a covering an upper surface of the chassis 61, left and right side surface plates 62b, 62b formed on both lateral-direction sides of the upper surface plate 62a so as to be erected downward, and holding plates 62c, 62c continuously formed on lower portions of the side surface plats 62b, 62b by bending the lower portions of the side surface plates 62b, 62b inward by proper widths. A space surrounded by the chassis 61 and the<br><br>
cartridge holder 62 forms a disk cartridge loading portion, and a cartridge insertion portion 62e is provided on one side of this space as shown in FIG. 12.  Pressing springs 62d, 62d are fitted to rear-side both side portions of the upper surface plate 62a of the cartridge holder 62 so as to correspond to the holding plates 62c, 62c.  The pressing springs 62d, 62d serve to bias the inserted disk cartridge 50 toward the holding plates 62c, 62c to thereby position the disk cartridge 50 in the height direction thereof.<br>
The cartridge holder 62 and the chassis 61 are rotatably linked by pivots 64, 64 at both left and right rear end portions.  The cartridge holder 62 is rotated in the vertical direction with the pivots 64, 64 being employed as a rotation center. Guide pins 65, 65 projected to sides are provided on forward-and-backward-direction front and rear portions of the chassis 61, and a guide shaft 66 projected to the side is provided on a forward-and-backward-direction middle portion of the cartridge holder 62.  The eject lever 63 is disposed on the outer side of the chassis 61 at the side in which the guide pins 65, 65 and the guide shaft 66 are projected, in parallel to the side surface plate 61b thereof.<br>
Guide apertures 67, 67 linearly extended in the forward and backward direction are provided through the forward-and-backward-direction front and rear portions of the eject lever 63, and a cam aperture 68 is provided through a forward-and-backward-direction middle portion thereof.  The guild pins 65, 65 provided on the chassis 61 are slidably pierced through<br><br>
the guide apertures 67, 67, and flange-shaped head portions provided at tip ends of the respective guide pins 65, 65 prevent the eject lever 63 from being detached.  The guide shaft 66 provided on the .cartridge holder 62 is slidably pierced through the cam aperture 68 of the eject lever 63,<br>
This cam aperture 68 has a horizontal cam portion 68a linearly extended in the forward and backward direction and an inclined cam portion 68b extended continuously from a rear end portion of the horizontal cam portion 68a diagonally downward. As will be described later on, when the guide shaft 66 is      positioned at a lower end portion of the inclined cam portion 68b, the cartridge holder 62 is kept in its horizontal state, and when the guide shaft 66 is moved to the horizontal cam portion 68a, the cartridge holder 62 is lifted up at the front side thereof and then inclined.<br>
A tensile coil spring 69 which is an example of a biasing means is stretched between the ejected lever 63 and the chassis 61.  The coil spring 69 is stopped by and engaged with an engagement piece 63a provided at the rear end portion of the chassis 61 at its front end, and a spring force of the coil spring 69 constantly biases the eject lever 63 forward. A tip end portion of the eject lever 63 is provided as an eject input portion 63b so as to be projected to thefront of the eject lever 63.  A button similar to the above-mentioned eject button 24 is fitted to the eject input portion 63b and used for an eject operation of the disk cartridge 50.<br>
The disk loading mechanism 60 having the above<br><br>
arrangement is housed in a facing body having the casing 7, the front panel 8 and the lid body 9 as described above. An operation of the disk loading mechanism 60 housed in the facing body will be described with reference to FIGS. 12 through 14. In order to facilitate contents of the figures, FIGS. 12 through 14 do not show the chassis 61 fixed on the casing 7 but show the cartridge holder 62 and the eject lever 63 which move in respective predetermined manners relative to the chassis 61. The opening and closing operation of the lid body 9 is the same as that described with reference to FIGS. 8(A) to 8(C), 9(A) and 9(B) and hence need not to be described.<br>
Until the disk cartridge 50 is inserted into a predetermined position of the cartridge holder 62 as shown in FIG. 12, the eject lever 63 is located at a rear-side position against the biasing force, and consequently the guild shaft 66 of the cartridge holder 62 is positioned in the horizontal cam portion 68a of the cam aperture 68.  Therefore, the front side of the cartridge holder 62 is kept in its lifted state, and in this state, the cartridge holder 62 is held by a holder locking member, not shown.<br>
At this time, a cartridge insertion slot of the cartridge holder 62 is opposed to the opening portion as the recording medium insertion portion opened in accordance with the movement of the lid body 9 in the direction in which the lid body 9 is opened outward. Accordingly, the disk cartridge 50 passed by the opening portion 14a of the disk reproducing apparatus 6 is inserted into the cartridge insertion slot 62e of<br><br>
the cartridge holder 62 as it is and then brought in the disk cartridge loading portion. When the disk cartridge 50 is pushed and inserted into a predetermined position, the ribs 22, 22 of the lid body 9 are brought onto the disk cartridge 50 and the lid body 9 is rotated by the spring force of the torsion spring 23 toward the front panel 8 side, i.e., in the direction in which the opening portion 14a is closed.  As .a result, the lid body 9 is brought onto the 'front panel 8, thereby the opening portion 14a being closed.<br>
When the disk cartridge 50 is inserted into the predetermined position of the cartridge holder 62, the locking operation of the holder locking member for locking the cartridge holder 62 is released in accordance with the operation of the disk cartridge 50. As a result, the spring force of the coil spring 69 starts to affect the eject lever 63, and hence the tensile force of the coil spring 69 biases the eject lever 63 forward.  Since the guide apertures 67, 67 of the eject lever 63 are slidably engaged with the guide pins 65, 65 of the chassis 61, only the eject lever 63 is moved forward.<br>
As a result, the cam aperture 68 of the eject lever 63 is relatively moved forward, and consequently the guide shaft 66 positioned in the horizontal cam portion 68a of the cam aperture 68 is moved backward and then brought in the inclined cam portion 68b as shown in FIG. 13.  In accordance with this movement of the guide shaft 66, the front side of the cartridge holder 62 is lowered.  Further, when the guide shaft 66 reaches the lowermost end portion of the inclined cam portion 68b, as<br><br>
shown in FIG. 14, the front side of the cartridge holder 62 is lowered to its lowermost position, the cartridge holder 62 is brought in its horizontal state.<br>
At this time, the disk cartridge 50 held by the cartridge holder 62 is brought close to the spindle motor 41 of the disk rotating mechanism 40 and then the magneto-optical disk 53 is chucked by the turntable, not shown. As a result, the magnetic head and the optical head are opposed to the magneto-optical disk 53 through the opening porions 54, 54 off the disk cartridge 50, thereafter the operation of recording or  reproducing the magneto-optical disk 53 becoming ready.<br>
The present invention can also be applied o a disk recording and/or reproducing apparatus 70 having an arrangement shown in FIGS. 15, 16(A) and 16(B). The disk recording and/or reproducing apparatus 70 according to a second embodiment of the present invention has a facing body for housing a disk loading mechanism mounted on a chassis and other mechanisms. The facing body is formed of a casing 71 and a lid body 72.  An inclined guide portion 73 is provided only on the lid body 72.  The lid body 72 is slidably formed relative to the casing 71 and a sliding movement of the lid body 72 opens and closes a recording medium insertion portion 74 of the casing 72.<br>
The casing 71 is rectangular-box-shaped such that the casing 7 and the front panel 8 of the above first embodiment are formed of one member, and has the recording-medium insertion portion 74, into and from which the disk cartridge 50 is inserted and ejected, by diagonally cutting an upper corner<br><br>
portion on the front side thereof.  Concave notch portions 75, 75 for housing side surface plates 72c, 72c of the lid body 72 are provided on both side portions, beside the recording-medium insertion portion 74, of the casing 71.<br>
The lid body 72 has such a shape that the front surface plate 9a of the lid body 9 of the first embodiment is enlarged in the downward direction, and has a front surface plate 72a, an upper surface plate 72b continuously formed from an upper end portion of the front surface plate 72a, and side surface plates 72c, 72c continuously formed from both side portions thereof.  An inclined guide portion 73 having a v-shaped cross section projected backward, i.e., a concave-shaped inclined guide portion having a V-shaped cross section is provided on an outer side of the lid body 72, i.e., on its surface opposed to the disk cartridge 50 to be inserted.  A left and right direction length of the inclined guide portion 73 is set substantially the same as a lateral-direction length of the disk cartridge 50. When the disk cartridge 50 is inserted, an insertion-side end surface portion of the disk cartridge 50 is brought in contact with an upper surface of the inclined guide portion 73, and an insertion-side lower-surface tip end portion of the disk cartridge 50 is brought in contact with a lower surface of the inclined guide portion 73.<br>
The lid body 72 is fitted to a font end portion of the casing 71 so as to cover the whole recording medium insertion portion 74, and the both end side surface plates 72c, 72c thereof are housed on the left and right concave notch<br><br>
portions 75, 75 of the casing 71.  Each of the concave notch portions 75, 75 has a lower restriction surface 75a for being brought in contact with a lower surface of the side surface plate 72c and an upper restriction surface 75b fur being brought in contact with a rear surface of the side surface plate 72c. An upward arc-shaped relief surface 75c is formed between the both restriction surfaces 75a, 75b in order to prevent the concave notch portion 75 fr-ora being brought in contact with the side surface plate 72c. A guide convex portion 76 projected in the side direction is provided in the vicinity of the recording insertion portion 74 on the upper side of each of the concave notch portions 75, 75.<br>
An arc-shaped guide aperture 77 with which the guide convex portion 77 is slidably engaged is provided through each of the side surface plates 72c, 72c of the lid body 72 so as to correspond to the guide convex portion 76.  The guide aperture 77 sets a range within which the lid body 72 can be moved.  As shown in FIGS. 15 and 16(A), when the lid body 72 closes the recording medium insertion portion 74, the guide convex portion 76 positioned at an upper end edge of the guide aperture 77. When the lid body 72 is lifted and then the recording medium insertion portion 74 is opened, the guide convex portion 76 is positioned at a lower end edge of the guide aperture 77.<br>
An opening and closing operation of the lid body 72 according to the second embodiment having the above arrangement will be described.  An insertion side of the disk cartridge 50 to be inserted into the disk recording and/or reproducing<br><br>
apparatus 70 is brought close to the inclined guide portion 73 of the lid body 72 and then inserted thereinto from the diagonally downward direction , and then a pressing force is applied to the disk cartridge 50 in the diagonally backward direction.  At this time, the lid body 72 is guided by the guide convex portion 76 slidably engaged with the guide aperture 77 and gradually raised thereby.  The lid body 72 is positionally changed from a state shown by a broken line in FIG. 16(A) through a state shown by one-dot chain line to a state shown by a two-dot chain line.  Then, the recording medium insertion portion 74 is opened, and it becomes possible to insert the disk cartridge 50 into the cartridge holder 31.<br>
When the disk cartridge 50 is completely inserted into the cartridge holder 31 and then a rear end portion of the disk cartridge 50 is inserted beyond a lower end edge of the front surface plate 72a of the lid body 72, nothing supports a front side of the front surface plate 72a thereof but a rear side thereof is supported by an upper surface of the casing 71. As a result, the front surface plate 72a side of the lid body is rotated downward due to its weight.  This rotation of the lid body 72 automatically closes the recording medium insertion point 74.  The lid body 72 may be constantly biased in the direction in which it is closed by a spring force of a spring provided between the casing 71 and the lid body 72.<br>
Having described above, the present invention is not limited to each of the above embodiments. While in the above embodiments the magneto-optical disk housed in the disk<br><br>
cartridge is employed as the recording medium, it is needless to say that a disk-shaped recording medium such as other recordable optical disk, a read-only optical disk, a magnetic disk or the like can be employed as the recording medium and the present invention can be applied to a recording medium such as a cassette housing a magnetic tape, a card-shaped medium having a semiconductor memory sealed therein or the like. While in the above embodiments the present invention is applied to the disk reproducing apparatus, the present invention can be applied to a recording and/or reproducing apparatus as well as a recording or storage apparatus dedicated for the recording or the storage.<br>
While in the first embodiment the inclined guide portions 16, 19 are provided as an inclined guide portion used for moving a lid body toward a portion of a casing where _the casing is opened to the outside so that the front panel 8 as a casing-side member and the lid body 9 are continuously connected to each other in the vicinity of the contact boundary there between and while in the second embodiment the inclined guide portion 73 is provided as such inclined guide portion used for the movement only on the lid body 72, the inclined guide portion may be only on a lid-body-side or casing-side member or the lid body may open and close the whole opening portion for the casing body.  While in the first embodiment the inclined guide portion 19 of the lid body 9 is formed as a curved surface and the inclined guide portion 16 of the casing body 7 is formed as a plane, contrary the inclined guide portion 19 and the inclined guide portion 16 may be formed as a plane and a curved surface,<br><br>
respectively, or both inclined portions 16, 19 may be formed as a curved surface and a plane.<br>
While in the above embodiments the disk cartridge 50 is used to rotate the lid bodies 9, 72, it is needless to say that the present invention is not limited thereto and an operation can directly open the lid bodies 9 and 72 by hand. While in the above embodiments the torsion spring 23 is employed as a springy means of the lid body moving mechanism, it is     needless to say that the present invention is not limited thereto and a spring member such as a rubber elastic body or the like as well as other springy member such as a coil spring or a plate spring may be employed.<br>
Having described preferred embodiments of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the above-mentioned embodiments and that various changes and modifications can be effected therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention as defined in the appended claims.<br><br>
